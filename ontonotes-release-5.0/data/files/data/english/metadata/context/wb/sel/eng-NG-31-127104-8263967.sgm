Ok, so the old GI has left now who I have been seeing since I was 16
(23 now). He wasn't the best, but the new guy....he's even worse!
Great, that's all I need! (Feel like smacking my head against a wall!)

Anyway, I mentioned to him that I wondered if this 'suspected' fissure
could be fungal or something. And he just said &quot;I highly doubt that&quot;
and that was it. Great! Btw, I must admit, he did offer to take a look
at it, but I said to him there's no point. Like I said, usually it's
just an irritating itch with nothing to see. When it gets bad and sore
then it's a shiny red path. When that gets even worse, then it looks
like a paper cut. So, there was nothing there to see, and I could do
without another Dr (especially on first meeting) deciding that it's
all in my head.

Also (Vanny, you'll find this interesting!) early January I had two
sets of test. One was a glycocholate test (which tests that amount of
bacteria in your bowel, if large bowel bacteria is spilling into the
large bowel etc) and the other was a bile absorption rate test. So I
asked for the results of them and he gave me the bile absorption rate
test results. He said they were abnormal, which he said means my ileum
is not re-absorbing the bile. So, I gather now all this time of the
yellow diarrhea (and them telling me it's irritable bowel, or normal,
or I worry too much) it was in fact me not absorbing the bile. So I'm
so glad to find that out, even though it's not so positive. So, then I
said &quot;and what about the glycocholate test results?&quot; and he said &quot;oh I
don't have them&quot; and I thought &quot;oh for goodness sake!&quot; And he started
talking about something else. Anyway, I said again later &quot;are you sure
you don't have the glycocholate test results?&quot; and he started looking
through some letters in my file and then started talking about my
results. I asked one more time later and he started looking through
these letters again and actually started reading something and said
&quot;hmmm....interesting...&quot; and then started talking about something
else. I couldn't ask again, that would have been 4 times! It was
ridiculous!

He really was an idiot! That's all I need after all these years of
being treated by an idiot! I'm going to give him one more chance
though, and if it's rubbish again then I'm going to get a referral.
I'm so sick and tired of these stupid Dr's.

Can you explain to me what a fissue is? I am a newly diagnosed Crohn's
patient after having it for 23 years. But I had a problem right by my
anus and I went to the doctor and he put me on 2 different kinds of
antibiotics it was like a hard knot and then it started to drain.
Gross I know, but hey when you have an IBD nothing embarasses you
anymore. =)
Thanks,

Well, I really do empathise with your struggle to find a good doctor. It is
incredible how many MD ingnoramuses there are around. I really don't know
what you are going to have to do - apart from treat yourself.

However, at long last a result. I am sure that I said the yellow liquid was
bile aeons ago and I am sure that yellow is more the colour of liver bile,
with the stored bile in the gall bladder more a green or brown colour. The
bile resorption problem means that you are highly likely, well more or less
fated, to get gall bladder stones and the ensuing problems - just wait for
your first bout of colic. This also means that you have fat absorption
issues, which you knew and your diet might be squewed to compensate for
this - cravings for fatty foods. However, this will exacerbate the high
output situation and he should have made some suggestions to you with
respect to your diet. For example, trying MCT fats, which are easier to
absorb if you are losing weight rapidly, but I think that your weight is OK,
but you probably have malnutrition despite being a nice jolly size. Go for
oils like olive oil, fish oil, linseed and walnut oil. Keep the latter two
in the fridge, buy small bottles, do not cook with them and use them up
rapidly. You can drizzle oil on bread instead of margarine and butter.

Cut down on saturated fats - cakes, biscuits, fast food, fish and chips,
etc. This will help control the diarrhoea somewhat. Basically, the more fat
you eat, the more your liver and then gall bladder will churn out bile. The
gall bladder stores about 30 ml of bile that is squirted out into the
duodenum as the stomach releases its contents. If more is needed then the
liver will send another batch through. I can't remember now the results of
your gall bladder tests, but when it starts to act up you will know about
it. Classical symptoms are RHS chest and shoulder pain, nausea, but also
abdominal pain and other strange things can occur. In the end, prior to
having mine out in May last year, I was having pains every single time I ate
something - low fat or otherwise. The stone was a single 2 cm round mass and
the wall showed signs of inflammation and thickening, neither of which
showed up on ultrasound (story of my life). The stones can get as big as
golf balls and not all stones cause problems.

Your doc. should also keep an eye on the levels of the fat-soluble vitamins
(A, D, E, K - aka ADEK), which may/will eventually drop. Vitamin B12 is also
absorbed at the terminal ileum and the levels in the liver will eventually
drop especially if you are still on PPIs for GERD, which prevents the
binding of vitamin B12 to intrinsic factor in the stomach. It is only in
this bound form that it is absorbed at the terminal ileum. However, the
liver stores 2-3 years worth of vitamin B12, although in your case it is
likely that the stores are lowish. If you ever start to have mouth ulcers, a
swollen tongue and perhaps vision problems you will most likely have vitamin
deficiencies.  Vitamin B12 deficiency and folic acid can go hand in hand, so
the levels of both must be tested for. I inject with folic acid once every
two weeks now and then receive monthly ADEK shots and daily sublingual
vitamin B12 (due to anaphylactic shock on the third shot). Keep in mind that
nerve damage due to vitamin B12 deficiency is irreversible, so keeping an
eye on this is extremely important. I know you know this. My new internist
is also my GP, so two in one. He was a bit sceptical about the sublingual
vitamin B12 bit, but my test results from June show a healthy almost middle
of the road B12 level. So it is working.

Questran is the medicine for mopping up bile entering the colon. When bile
enters the colon it irritates the colon and causes/exacerbates diarrhoea.
They should have given you this in hospital. However, Questran can also
result in reducing the ADEK levels and a side-effect of the medication can
be deficiencies of the fat-soluble vitamins.

Well that's the theory. I hope that you manage to whip him into shape to
apply it and address your quality of life. Who knows how much of your
tiredness, etc., is due to malnutrition due to fat absorption issues - and
no, you don't have to have anorexia to be malnourished.

All the best,

Vanny

You're certainly being generous...if a doctor won't talk to you, you
need another one, IMO...

I've seen four GIs now from the west coast to the midwest, and I'm still
not sure which one I &quot;trust&quot; either...certainly not the first two.  I
was bleeding six years ago when the first one scoped me (my first one),
and all he had to say was &quot;as long as it's red blood we don't get
worried&quot;.  Next time anyone tells me that I'll offer to gut-shoot them
and tell them the same...

Wow, Vanny, that's one hell of a reply! Thanks! Lots of details there.
Where do I start.....

I have definitely more taken to the idea of treating myself over the
past years or so. If it kills me, then it kills me. I suppose I'll
only go into hospital when I'm unconscious, and if not, then I'll
probably die. Whatever lol!

Yes I do remember you saying about the bile and ileum absorption. I
even said to my Mum straight after &quot;remember Vanny said that? And it
took the Dr's how long?&quot; Needless to say, me and Mum both had a joint
appointment and she was told the same thing as me, so we've both been
prescribed the bile salts. I think I'm taking after my Mum very much
so. But you know what, she's had this since she was a child and never
been bothered with, and she's still standing. I wonder how much of her
exhaustion is the vitamin deficiency too, from all these years. She
also knows she's got heart problems, but no one will take any notice
of her. I've learned a lot of my Mum how to be tough without the Dr's
help, because they're never going to help. We kid ourselves really
believing that anyone else gives a shit about us, when we've only got
each other to rely on. I said to the Dr about vitamin deficiencies for
us both, but he is only checking for one....I think it was B12 he
ticked on the blood card (bloods again, wooohooo!) I can't keep going
on to them, I'm sure it's all over my file me being a hypochondriac.
So whatever, they'll be sorry when I collapse or die, that's all I
think. With Mum though, her ileum is practically shut. The 6mp has
kept her going though. But what I don't get though is she has
extremely high cholesterol. Really, me and her are overweight, so how
comes? And we're always the same weight which is strange. And we go up
and down with weight exactly the same. I was underweight and too thing
when I was younger, but then the steroids got me and I've been
overweight ever since. But I can honestly say to you I really don't
eat much, definitely not enough to be this size. I'm now 12 1/2 stone
which is ridiculous. I eat two slices of toast for breakfast with
butter. Then usually I don't eat anything until super at 6pm, which is
usually some meat with potato (and I've found out I can eat tinned
asparagus now hahaha!) and a mushroom. Or a pizza. Or salmon with
potato and asparagus. Or a jacket potato with tuna fish. Then I might
have a packet of crisps and a mini chocolate bar for an evening snack.
So that's it. Not the best diet, but that's what I can do.

I don't actually have diarrhea since 6mp. I have it when my womb plays
up, but that's it. Needless to say, my BM's are usually quite pale in
colour which is most likely the bile. Actually, the GI (the one I
liked who was the registrar who is now gone = female!) suspected I may
have endometriosis when I told her about my gynai problems and what
they do to my bowel. So I went to the GP and explained my symptoms,
and explained the endo runs in the family as does ovarian cancer and
she's referred me to the gynai. My appointment is Thursday. I saw the
gynai at my regular hospital, and they were as rubbish as the gastric
department. I sat in the waiting room for 6 hours being ignored, and
then I said something just before the clinic was going to close, and
so they had so little time for me they just recommended me changing my
contraceptive pill. Which hasn't worked! I take it constantly because
the pain it causes me and f***s up my bowel, I can't handle it. But I
have breakthrough bleeding. I get incredible pain too and then I
bleed. I also can't orgasm because it hurts so much to do so. And I
bleed after sex. At the moment I'm having an episode. I'm in
sooooooooo much pain (that I even risked taking an Ibuprofen!!!).
Started bleeding too and I was like &quot;oh, here we go&quot;. Had diarrhea,
and incredible pain on passing motions. I can't cough, laugh or sneeze
etc because it hurts too much in that area. The area it hurts so bad
to press is just above my pubic bone and below my belly button and is
central. Anyway, I hope I don't have to have ANOTHER ultrasound (which
shows nothing) on Thursday because I can't cope with my bladder being
full right now or the instrument being pressed on my belly. I will
tell them that.

Anyway, I take flax seed oil on a daily basis so I'm glad to hear
linseed oil is a good idea. And like I said I eat salmon. I don't
think I could stomach oil on bread, even the thought of that makes me
want to retch.

As for my gall bladder....well, Mum's not had a problem there ever and
she's had this problem longer than me and untreated. She's 50 next
year. Mind you, she is having raised liver enzymes again so they've
had to reduce the 6mp back down to 25 mg's again. She also has that
terrible bile choking at night. She says though it's her own fault, it
happens when she over eats, so when she doesn't over eat it doesn't
happen. Anyway, if I get gall bladder problems I'm sure I'll know
about it. I've had an ultrasound to check my gall bladder and it looks
fine apparently. But you and me with tests.....grrrr lol!

Anyway, I still wonder why I'm so fat.....I put it on with the
steroids, but it never seems to go away when I've stopped them!

&gt; abdominal pain and other strange things can occur. In the end, prior to
&gt; having mine out in May last year, I was having pains every single time I ate
&gt; something - low fat or otherwise. The stone was a single 2 cm round mass and
&gt; the wall showed signs of inflammation and thickening, neither of which
&gt; showed up on ultrasound (story of my life). The stones can get as big as
&gt; golf balls and not all stones cause problems.

&gt; Your doc. should also keep an eye on the levels of the fat-soluble vitamins
&gt; (A, D, E, K - aka ADEK), which may/will eventually drop. Vitamin B12 is also
&gt; absorbed at the terminal ileum and the levels in the liver will eventually
&gt; drop especially if you are still on PPIs for GERD, which prevents the
&gt; binding of vitamin B12 to intrinsic factor in the stomach. It is only in
&gt; this bound form that it is absorbed at the terminal ileum. However, the
&gt; liver stores 2-3 years worth of vitamin B12, although in your case it is
&gt; likely that the stores are lowish. If you ever start to have mouth ulcers, a
&gt; swollen tongue and perhaps vision problems you will most likely have vitamin
&gt; deficiencies.  Vitamin B12 deficiency and folic acid can go hand in hand, so
&gt; the levels of both must be tested for. I inject with folic acid once every
&gt; two weeks now and then receive monthly ADEK shots and daily sublingual
&gt; vitamin B12 (due to anaphylactic shock on the third shot). Keep in mind that
&gt; nerve damage due to vitamin B12 deficiency is irreversible, so keeping an
&gt; eye on this is extremely important. I know you know this. My new internist
&gt; is also my GP, so two in one. He was a bit sceptical about the sublingual
&gt; vitamin B12 bit, but my test results from June show a healthy almost middle
&gt; of the road B12 level. So it is working.

&gt; Questran is the medicine for mopping up bile entering the colon. When bile
&gt; enters the colon it irritates the colon and causes/exacerbates diarrhoea.
&gt; They should have given you this in hospital. However, Questran can also
&gt; result in reducing the ADEK levels and a side-effect of the medication can
&gt; be deficiencies of the fat-soluble vitamins.

&gt; Well that's the theory. I hope that you manage to whip him into shape to
&gt; apply it and address your quality of life. Who knows how much of your
&gt; tiredness, etc., is due to malnutrition due to fat absorption issues - and
&gt; no, you don't have to have anorexia to be malnourished.

&gt; All the best,

&gt; &gt; Also (Vanny, you'll find this interesting!) early January I had two

&gt; &gt; bacteria in your bowel, if large bowel bacteria is spilling into the
&gt; &gt; large bowel etc) and the other was a bile absorption rate test. So I
&gt; &gt; asked for the results of them and he gave me the bile absorption rate
&gt; &gt; test results. He said they were abnormal, which he said means my ileum
&gt; &gt; is not re-absorbing the bile. So, I gather now all this time of the
&gt; &gt; yellow diarrhea (and them telling me it's irritable bowel, or normal,
&gt; &gt; or I worry too much) it was in fact me not absorbing the bile. So I'm
&gt; &gt; so glad to find that out, even though it's not so positive. So, then I

&gt; &gt; don't have them&quot; and I thought &quot;oh for goodness sake!&quot; And he started

&gt; &gt; you don't have the glycocholate test results?&quot; and he started looking

&gt; &gt; these letters again and actually started reading something and said
&gt; &gt; &quot;hmmm....interesting...&quot; and then started talking about something
&gt; &gt; else. I couldn't ask again, that would have been 4 times! It was
&gt; &gt; ridiculous!

&gt; &gt; He really was an idiot! That's all I need after all these years of

It's an odd sort of daydream, but I'm starting to wish I could find a GI
that actually had the disease...not that I'd want to wish the disease on
anyone...but I'm starting to gather that that's the only way to actually

If you have been prescribed the bile salts (Ursofalk aka Ursodiol, Urso,
Actigall, Ursodeoxycholic acid, UDCA, etc.)
http://www.drugs.com/cons/ursofalk.html then you must be prescribed
Questran (aka Cholestyramine) http://www.drugs.com/cons/questran.html , which
you take after a meal to mop up the bile as it hits the colon. The good
thing with Ursofalk is that it actually may prevent the formation of
gallstones. If you notice increase diarrhoea on taking the medication then
that is the time to discuss Questran with the doc. Keep an eye out for the
side-effects of Ursofalk. Questran would also be a good idea for your mum
because it lowers blood cholesterol. However, do not forget that there is
good cholesterol in the form of HDL (high density lipoprotein) and bad
cholesterol in the form of LDL (low density lipoprotein) and in order to
find out if your mum is at risk of artherosclerosis the actual amounts and
ratios of HDL to LDL must be calculated.
http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=14631

Don't forget that the pill also causes water retention and because your are
unable to move around actively there is probably no way that you can shed
weight, although your crisps and chocolate in the evening could be
sacrificed. However, I will not take your comfort food from you. After all
you have to have some enjoyment in your life, but you might like to think
about moving them to earlier in the day and cutting down to every second day
or so ;-)  I would also suggest that you do eat at least three to five times
a day with at least three different colours on your plate at each meal.
Somebody here told us how she puts low fibre vegetables, such as, carrots,
sweet potatoes, parsnips in the oven and then snacks on them cold for a
couple of days. It is a good idea because it means that you are getting
valuable antioxidants, which lower the risk of cancer. Eating during the day
prevents the breakdown of muscle should you exert yourself and your body go
into starvation mode because you have nothing in your stomach.

I know that it is taking a long time and I know that it is draining, but you
are definitely getting somewhere. This comes from someone who does remember
how it was for you when you first started posting here. I think that you
have accepted that a lot of it is DIY, and gently educating and manipulating
the doctors to do what you want them to do. It is really good that you and
your mum go to the docs together because moral support is very important
especially when the doctors are not as competent as they should be.

A real challenge is that the doctors are usually good at treating acute
illness and also get rewarded by relatively instantaneous results and a
happy patient in a few days or weeks. Treating chronically ill patients is
as not rewarding and is usually exasperating for both the patient and the
doctor.

It is very difficult to convey to the doctors how one is feeling. I have
come to the conclusion that there are over 100 types of tiredness alone.
After having a good (read better) 4 days in the third week of June I have
since then been suffering from real fluey-like symptoms and have been
sleeping a really sick sleep - sort of Gulf War Syndrome as a descriptor. I
have also been fighting lying down during the day to try and increase the
quality of my nighttime sleep, but now I feel as though I could quite
happily sleep all day, but don't. I have obviously been a lot more tired and
sick, but that doesn't help me when I am still living in the aftermath of
the move at the end of March and there is still so much to do.

Pleased to here that your mum has no problems with her gall bladder. My
problems were largely due to the ileostomy, which results in an even lower
reuptake (recycling) of bile at the terminal ileum, plus Crohn's at the
terminal ileum, which eventually resulted (textbook stuff) in gall stones.
Tell your mum that I am 48 next and convey my best wishes to her.

For the side-effects of your medicines I refer you to www.drugs.com and
www.rxlist.com

All the best,

Vanny

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Wow, Vanny, that's one hell of a reply! Thanks! Lots of details there.
&gt; Where do I start.....

&gt; I have definitely more taken to the idea of treating myself over the
&gt; past years or so. If it kills me, then it kills me. I suppose I'll
&gt; only go into hospital when I'm unconscious, and if not, then I'll
&gt; probably die. Whatever lol!

&gt; Yes I do remember you saying about the bile and ileum absorption. I
&gt; even said to my Mum straight after &quot;remember Vanny said that? And it
&gt; took the Dr's how long?&quot; Needless to say, me and Mum both had a joint
&gt; appointment and she was told the same thing as me, so we've both been
&gt; prescribed the bile salts. I think I'm taking after my Mum very much
&gt; so. But you know what, she's had this since she was a child and never
&gt; been bothered with, and she's still standing. I wonder how much of her
&gt; exhaustion is the vitamin deficiency too, from all these years. She
&gt; also knows she's got heart problems, but no one will take any notice
&gt; of her. I've learned a lot of my Mum how to be tough without the Dr's
&gt; help, because they're never going to help. We kid ourselves really
&gt; believing that anyone else gives a shit about us, when we've only got
&gt; each other to rely on. I said to the Dr about vitamin deficiencies for
&gt; us both, but he is only checking for one....I think it was B12 he
&gt; ticked on the blood card (bloods again, wooohooo!) I can't keep going
&gt; on to them, I'm sure it's all over my file me being a hypochondriac.
&gt; So whatever, they'll be sorry when I collapse or die, that's all I
&gt; think. With Mum though, her ileum is practically shut. The 6mp has
&gt; kept her going though. But what I don't get though is she has
&gt; extremely high cholesterol. Really, me and her are overweight, so how
&gt; comes? And we're always the same weight which is strange. And we go up
&gt; and down with weight exactly the same. I was underweight and too thing
&gt; when I was younger, but then the steroids got me and I've been
&gt; overweight ever since. But I can honestly say to you I really don't
&gt; eat much, definitely not enough to be this size. I'm now 12 1/2 stone
&gt; which is ridiculous. I eat two slices of toast for breakfast with
&gt; butter. Then usually I don't eat anything until super at 6pm, which is
&gt; usually some meat with potato (and I've found out I can eat tinned
&gt; asparagus now hahaha!) and a mushroom. Or a pizza. Or salmon with
&gt; potato and asparagus. Or a jacket potato with tuna fish. Then I might
&gt; have a packet of crisps and a mini chocolate bar for an evening snack.
&gt; So that's it. Not the best diet, but that's what I can do.

&gt; I don't actually have diarrhea since 6mp. I have it when my womb plays
&gt; up, but that's it. Needless to say, my BM's are usually quite pale in
&gt; colour which is most likely the bile. Actually, the GI (the one I
&gt; liked who was the registrar who is now gone = female!) suspected I may
&gt; have endometriosis when I told her about my gynai problems and what
&gt; they do to my bowel. So I went to the GP and explained my symptoms,
&gt; and explained the endo runs in the family as does ovarian cancer and
&gt; she's referred me to the gynai. My appointment is Thursday. I saw the
&gt; gynai at my regular hospital, and they were as rubbish as the gastric
&gt; department. I sat in the waiting room for 6 hours being ignored, and
&gt; then I said something just before the clinic was going to close, and
&gt; so they had so little time for me they just recommended me changing my
&gt; contraceptive pill. Which hasn't worked! I take it constantly because
&gt; the pain it causes me and f***s up my bowel, I can't handle it. But I
&gt; have breakthrough bleeding. I get incredible pain too and then I
&gt; bleed. I also can't orgasm because it hurts so much to do so. And I
&gt; bleed after sex. At the moment I'm having an episode. I'm in
&gt; sooooooooo much pain (that I even risked taking an Ibuprofen!!!).
&gt; Started bleeding too and I was like &quot;oh, here we go&quot;. Had diarrhea,
&gt; and incredible pain on passing motions. I can't cough, laugh or sneeze
&gt; etc because it hurts too much in that area. The area it hurts so bad
&gt; to press is just above my pubic bone and below my belly button and is
&gt; central. Anyway, I hope I don't have to have ANOTHER ultrasound (which
&gt; shows nothing) on Thursday because I can't cope with my bladder being
&gt; full right now or the instrument being pressed on my belly. I will
&gt; tell them that.

&gt; Anyway, I take flax seed oil on a daily basis so I'm glad to hear
&gt; linseed oil is a good idea. And like I said I eat salmon. I don't
&gt; think I could stomach oil on bread, even the thought of that makes me
&gt; want to retch.

&gt; As for my gall bladder....well, Mum's not had a problem there ever and
&gt; she's had this problem longer than me and untreated. She's 50 next
&gt; year. Mind you, she is having raised liver enzymes again so they've
&gt; had to reduce the 6mp back down to 25 mg's again. She also has that
&gt; terrible bile choking at night. She says though it's her own fault, it
&gt; happens when she over eats, so when she doesn't over eat it doesn't
&gt; happen. Anyway, if I get gall bladder problems I'm sure I'll know
&gt; about it. I've had an ultrasound to check my gall bladder and it looks
&gt; fine apparently. But you and me with tests.....grrrr lol!

&gt; Anyway, I still wonder why I'm so fat.....I put it on with the
&gt; steroids, but it never seems to go away when I've stopped them!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;all in my head.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Also (Vanny, you'll find this interesting!) early January I had two
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;sets of test. One was a glycocholate test (which tests that amount of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;bacteria in your bowel, if large bowel bacteria is spilling into the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;large bowel etc) and the other was a bile absorption rate test. So I
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;asked for the results of them and he gave me the bile absorption rate
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;test results. He said they were abnormal, which he said means my ileum
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;is not re-absorbing the bile. So, I gather now all this time of the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;yellow diarrhea (and them telling me it's irritable bowel, or normal,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;or I worry too much) it was in fact me not absorbing the bile. So I'm
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;so glad to find that out, even though it's not so positive. So, then I
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;said &quot;and what about the glycocholate test results?&quot; and he said &quot;oh I
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;don't have them&quot; and I thought &quot;oh for goodness sake!&quot; And he started
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;talking about something else. Anyway, I said again later &quot;are you sure
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;you don't have the glycocholate test results?&quot; and he started looking
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;through some letters in my file and then started talking about my
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;results. I asked one more time later and he started looking through
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;these letters again and actually started reading something and said
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;hmmm....interesting...&quot; and then started talking about something
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;else. I couldn't ask again, that would have been 4 times! It was
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;ridiculous!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;He really was an idiot! That's all I need after all these years of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;being treated by an idiot! I'm going to give him one more chance
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;though, and if it's rubbish again then I'm going to get a referral.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I'm so sick and tired of these stupid Dr's.

Just spoke to my Mum and she said that the bile salts haven't been
prescribed to her, but she's to take it if she feels bad. That's a
shame though, because I read the link to the Ursofalk and it sounded
like it would be good for her liver, with what 6mp is doing to it. I
don't know if Mum should take something like Questran because she
suffers more so from constipation than diarrhea (we're totally
different there!) and I reckon the Questran would make that worse for
her. The constpation hurts her ileum. But she manages. The side
effects of Ursofalk worried me a bit. I always get side effects and
those ones sound pretty annoying to say the least! I could do without
them. But I am printing up everything you've said on this matter and
will snip it all into what I am going to talk to him about next
appointment. Mum too.

It's strange, because Mum's last reading of her cholesterol (at the
GP) was 8. Not good! But then again the Dr never said anything about
HDL and LDL. Ridiculous, once again! And Mum said &quot;shouldn't something
be done for this, shouldn't I take something?&quot; and the GP said &quot;well,
you're ok, you don't have any pointers towards heart disease&quot;. So Mum
said &quot;actually, my father has had heart disease from the age of
37&quot;.....it's the one where the arteries narrow. And the GP just said
&quot;oh&quot; and that's it. I think at this moment in time, me and Mum feel
like buying a shotgun and blowing the heads off of all these
incompetent Dr's lmao! Oh well, my Mum always says to me &quot;My
grandparents were tough! They got on with all of these things without
any Dr's, and they lived to a ripe old age!&quot; My Mum's grandmother
wouldn't go near a hospital, because as far as she's concerned you go
to a hospital to die. Maybe we should think more like these people of
the old days. Because they just got on. Even my own grandad! You know,
he was bleeding out his bum for 2 years, non-stop. And it was a heavy
fresh blood flow, he had to wear sanitary towels. Anyway, he did get a
colonoscopy, which showed.....nothing! There ya go again! So they said
&quot;I think you should concentrate on this more&quot; whilst patting at his
heart area. And left him. So seems like my whole family get treated
the same by these Dr's. I think him and my Grandma have IBD btw. My
Grandma has been diagnosed with microscopic colitis, but was told it's
just an old age thing, lmao, bullshit! And my Grandad was diagnosed
way back in the day as having diverticulitis, but me and Mum think his
symptoms are much more like Crohn's. He's even got a fistula at the
top of his bum crack! But you know what? I think he's better off
thinking that he's got diverticulitis.

Oh, and on top of that, I have an aunt (on Mum's side) who has
Ulcerative Colitis, and Mum's got a cousin with Crohn's. My dad's side
all seem to suffer from what they think is irritable bowel, but mainly
GERD. I've seen my dad in terrific pain in his upper stomach, rolling
around on the floor. He's even been known to pass black diarrhea. So,
there seems to be something going on on both sides of my family. My
brother seems to have gotten away with it all, although he's only 26.
He's nuts though lmao! He does seem to have strange bowel movements
though. He only goes about twice per week! And the stench he leaves
behind, it's like raw sewage! That can't be right!

Hmm...the weight thing. Well, am I mad in thinking that that could be
genetic also and no matter what, I can't avoid it? There's not one
slim person in my family. And actually, my brother has been overweight
since a little boy. I got away with it until 19! I do wonder if it's
water. My best friend suffers from bad water retention in her legs,
and she was showing me the difference between fat and water. She said
that fat makes the 'cellulite' look when you crumple it up, but water
doesn't. And water ripples when you slap it. If I slap my chest, it
ripples down to my belly lmao! I ripple everywhere! Even my face!
Maybe I should talk to the GP and try water pills or something.

I try my best with my food, but I can honestly say that I'm not a big
eater and could no way fit in me the amount that you suggest. It'd
just come straight back up because I'm so full! I forgot to say that I
do eat roasted carrots, so that's an added bonus. I'm doing better
than before, I couldn't eat any veg before 6mp and now I'm on potato's
(no skins), mushrooms, asparagus and carrots. I want to try broccoli
some time, but I'm in trouble gynaecologically at the moment so I
don't want to spark my Crohn's off on top of that if I can help it.
Needless to say, I'm in less pain now and bleeding heavier.
Strange.... I try to eat honey due melon for fruit, but that does
upset me a bit. But it's the easiest fruit on me. I can't touch the
other options. The crisps and chocolate...I don't think it's that bad,
because like I said it's one funsize bar per day. That's about as long
as my thumb. And sometimes I don't have the chocolate. I'm more of a
crisp person haha! Oh yeah, I forgot to say, I eat olives a lot too.
Yes, they're my nibbles through the day. Just plain pitted olives. I
don't want to give up my crisps, but maybe you've got something in
getting it to every other day. I shall try that!

When I feel a bit better I do want to get into swimming. I think
that's less impact on the body than my usual weight training, bag
work, exercise bike and treadmil. It'll support my body weight. And
I'm not going to go into it like a mad woman, just stay nicely calm
and not be so competitive with myself. I was going to start aqua
aerobics lite with my best friend, but then we both got ill haha! She
said that there's all old ladies in her class and everyone goes at
their own pace and it's dead easy. She's going for her water retention
too, plus her pelvis...well, she was in a bad car accident quite a
while ago, but they've found out now that her pelvis is completely out
of line, causing the water retention in her legs. So through the aqua
aerobics and pilates it's hoped her pelvis gets helped.

Yes you are right, there is improvement with my circumstances than
there was when I first started posting here. But my oh my, hasn't it
been a long process, and we're still not there! Which does lead me to
believe we'll never get there so it is about DIY. You're born into
this world alone, and you go out alone! I'm hoping that when we move
and start this self sufficient/sustainable community things will get
better too. I think a lot has to do with the way we're living. There
was a recent research article (don't have any links I'm afraid) that
said that they tested all the organic fruit and veg (and regular fruit
and veg) on every one of our supermarket shelves, to see what was in
them.....the outcome was f**k all was in them! So I'm looking forward
to growing my own fruit and veg and herbs in a permaculture way, and
raising, keeping and slaughtering my own meat, on top of hunting too
(which includes fishing). We have so lost touch with nature, but
really, nature provides everything we need. And it's not about going
back to being cavemen, it's about taking the best of old and new and
intertwining them without corruption.

Yes it is good that me and Mum go in together. I know more medically
and anatomy than she does, and she understands what they're saying
better than I do, so we help each other. They don't like it though
that I need her with me because of my learning difficulties. Because
they can't see my learning difficulties, they believe I should be on
my own with it all. But if my Mum isn't there, I don't understand
what's going on. And if I'm not there for her, then she doesn't ask
the right questions, and question the things they want to do to her.

Oh god, the tiredness thing! I can't get my body clock right, no
matter how hard I try. I fall asleep around 2am, and wake up about
midday. It's not practical! I try to wake up earlier so I fall asleep
earlier, but then I just fall asleep during the day, or I still fall
asleep at 2am still. Mum is asleep from about 7.30pm though, after
she's got in and had dinner. Then she gets up around 11.30pm and takes
herself off to bed, where she wakes up around 5.30am. We're all out
lol!

I will send my Mum your wishes, thanks for that! I'd love her to join
here but she just doesn't have the time and/or energy. She's a hard
worker my Mum, I wish I was as tough as her. I've never known someone
to be so ill, but to juggle so much and so many people all at once.
Remember she works 2 jobs, is going through a divorce, trying to sell
the house, two sick elderly parents, a sick daughter and her work is
helping people (addictions counselor). Mind you, at the moment she's
so stressed out at work because of this July 1st smoking ban in public
places. She works for Bolton NHS quit smoking team. And what she hates
is that everyone thinks she's anti-smoking, but she's not, she just
helps people quit who want to quit. But her boss is driving the whole
team mad with &quot;no time off, targets, this and that, we're going to be
so busy this month and the following months!&quot;

Anyway, I'll leave it there. Sorry for all that! I really can go on!

Yes, you're right about the Questran. It would be a very bad idea for your
mum's ileum. I had to stop taking it last year because I was getting
blockages and ileus from the Creon 20 (pancreatic enzymes).

Well, IBD is definitely in your family. I have a theory about people with
similar energy levels coming together and with similar energy levels come
similar diseases. The more I think about it, the more I believe that my dad
had psoriasis and, as I have mentioned, the Crohn's and GERD are on my
mother's side with an aunt having Crohn's and my grandmother popping Rennies
and clutching her chest all the time.

I know that you are going to find this difficult to believe, but your
brother's bowels are well within the normal range. This article explains the
variations from person to person very well
http://www.familydoctor.co.uk/htdocs/BOWELS/BOWELS_specimen.html

Older people have had to be tougher, but they ate better when they were
younger and moved around more so were healthier and fitter. Their
expectations from the health system were also a lot lower as your
grandmother's statement shows. I can't believe that the high sugar and the
artificial stuff that is found in food is really not good for us. I do try
and eat as much organic food as possible, but my current finances are
tighter than they were in the past and the organic shop is a lot further
away.

I would steer you away from the water pills because IBD patients are at a
high risk of thromboses (strokes, pulmonary embolism, etc.) and you have
further increase to this risk taking the pill. I think that you will just
have to accept that you will have water retention until you can start karate
chopping people again and getting back to your drumming.

I am pleased that you are snacking on vegetables. I love olives and they
don't seem to cause me any major problems, possibly because they are so full
of oil that they do not get stuck. A tip would be to also try avocado. I
make a Crohn's guacomole with yoghurt and vitamin C (because of my GERD I
can't use lemon or eat tomatoes). They are very nutritional as a snack with
wholewheat bread or as a meal with rice and salmon. I never realised that
they were an ingredient of sushi until I started making it a few weeks ago.
Unfortunately, it does exacerbate my GERD so I am going to have to find a
way of making sticky rice without using any sugar or rice wine vinegar.
Baked marrow or courgettes might also introduce some variety into your diet
without hurting your gut. I love melon, but it causes me tremendous problems
so I have to do without. With respect to the mars bar and crisps, perhaps I
am just jealous because I cannot eat either of them due to GERD.

Your plans for growing your own food sound like far too much hard work for
me, but a very commendable enterprise. A lot of people had vegetable patches
in their gardens, but this is virtually a thing of the past. It would
certainly be a good thing to rekindle.

I hope that you and your mum are planning a holiday soon to get those stress
levels down. I will not be going on holiday this year because the finances
are a bit tight (I still have outstanding bills) and there is nowhere I
could go to be ill in comfort. However, my new doctor said that there is a
fair chance that I would be permitted to spend three weeks at a convalescent
clinic again. I completed the forms and took them to his office yesterday.
If I don't get permission then I won't be that upset because they do make us
work and I will have to pack two suitcases, but if I do then it will be my
holiday this year and I think a spell out of the flat will do me good. If I
do go it will be back to the same clinic as last year and to the same doctor
or nothing. The clinic did put me on the correct treatment for short bowel
syndrome (after 20 odd months of suffering from it) and thanks to them I am
hovering around my normal weight of 55 kg at 164 cm tall.

It is freezing here and my neighbour downstairs asserted herself at the
weekend and had the heating put back on. I wish that I had known that and I
would have put the radiators on in my flat. I was shivering so much that I
thought I was ill(er) - that combined with the medication fever and/or hot
flashes make for an interesting time. I have become so dopey that I don't
seem to be able to recognise cold anymore.

I find writing very cathartic, purging out all the bad vibes and it helps me
sort out problems and I see things a lot clearer afterwards, especially with
input from others. I think that it does everyone good to write things down.
So keep on writing!

All the best,

Vanny

&gt; prescribed to her, but she's to take it if she feels bad. That's a
&gt; shame though, because I read the link to the Ursofalk and it sounded
&gt; like it would be good for her liver, with what 6mp is doing to it. I
&gt; don't know if Mum should take something like Questran because she
&gt; suffers more so from constipation than diarrhea (we're totally
&gt; different there!) and I reckon the Questran would make that worse for
&gt; her. The constpation hurts her ileum. But she manages. The side
&gt; effects of Ursofalk worried me a bit. I always get side effects and
&gt; those ones sound pretty annoying to say the least! I could do without
&gt; them. But I am printing up everything you've said on this matter and
&gt; will snip it all into what I am going to talk to him about next
&gt; appointment. Mum too.

&gt; It's strange, because Mum's last reading of her cholesterol (at the
&gt; GP) was 8. Not good! But then again the Dr never said anything about
&gt; HDL and LDL. Ridiculous, once again! And Mum said &quot;shouldn't something
&gt; be done for this, shouldn't I take something?&quot; and the GP said &quot;well,
&gt; you're ok, you don't have any pointers towards heart disease&quot;. So Mum
&gt; said &quot;actually, my father has had heart disease from the age of
&gt; 37&quot;.....it's the one where the arteries narrow. And the GP just said
&gt; &quot;oh&quot; and that's it. I think at this moment in time, me and Mum feel
&gt; like buying a shotgun and blowing the heads off of all these
&gt; incompetent Dr's lmao! Oh well, my Mum always says to me &quot;My
&gt; grandparents were tough! They got on with all of these things without
&gt; any Dr's, and they lived to a ripe old age!&quot; My Mum's grandmother
&gt; wouldn't go near a hospital, because as far as she's concerned you go
&gt; to a hospital to die. Maybe we should think more like these people of
&gt; the old days. Because they just got on. Even my own grandad! You know,
&gt; he was bleeding out his bum for 2 years, non-stop. And it was a heavy
&gt; fresh blood flow, he had to wear sanitary towels. Anyway, he did get a
&gt; colonoscopy, which showed.....nothing! There ya go again! So they said
&gt; &quot;I think you should concentrate on this more&quot; whilst patting at his
&gt; heart area. And left him. So seems like my whole family get treated
&gt; the same by these Dr's. I think him and my Grandma have IBD btw. My
&gt; Grandma has been diagnosed with microscopic colitis, but was told it's
&gt; just an old age thing, lmao, bullshit! And my Grandad was diagnosed
&gt; way back in the day as having diverticulitis, but me and Mum think his
&gt; symptoms are much more like Crohn's. He's even got a fistula at the
&gt; top of his bum crack! But you know what? I think he's better off
&gt; thinking that he's got diverticulitis.

&gt; Oh, and on top of that, I have an aunt (on Mum's side) who has
&gt; Ulcerative Colitis, and Mum's got a cousin with Crohn's. My dad's side
&gt; all seem to suffer from what they think is irritable bowel, but mainly
&gt; GERD. I've seen my dad in terrific pain in his upper stomach, rolling
&gt; around on the floor. He's even been known to pass black diarrhea. So,
&gt; there seems to be something going on on both sides of my family. My
&gt; brother seems to have gotten away with it all, although he's only 26.
&gt; He's nuts though lmao! He does seem to have strange bowel movements
&gt; though. He only goes about twice per week! And the stench he leaves
&gt; behind, it's like raw sewage! That can't be right!

&gt; Hmm...the weight thing. Well, am I mad in thinking that that could be
&gt; genetic also and no matter what, I can't avoid it? There's not one
&gt; slim person in my family. And actually, my brother has been overweight
&gt; since a little boy. I got away with it until 19! I do wonder if it's
&gt; water. My best friend suffers from bad water retention in her legs,
&gt; and she was showing me the difference between fat and water. She said
&gt; that fat makes the 'cellulite' look when you crumple it up, but water
&gt; doesn't. And water ripples when you slap it. If I slap my chest, it
&gt; ripples down to my belly lmao! I ripple everywhere! Even my face!
&gt; Maybe I should talk to the GP and try water pills or something.

&gt; I try my best with my food, but I can honestly say that I'm not a big
&gt; eater and could no way fit in me the amount that you suggest. It'd
&gt; just come straight back up because I'm so full! I forgot to say that I
&gt; do eat roasted carrots, so that's an added bonus. I'm doing better
&gt; than before, I couldn't eat any veg before 6mp and now I'm on potato's
&gt; (no skins), mushrooms, asparagus and carrots. I want to try broccoli
&gt; some time, but I'm in trouble gynaecologically at the moment so I
&gt; don't want to spark my Crohn's off on top of that if I can help it.
&gt; Needless to say, I'm in less pain now and bleeding heavier.
&gt; Strange.... I try to

My ex-wife was treated poorly by the GYN at her doctor's clinic.  After 2 visits in which this
doctor didn't look at her, but chastised her for questioning her previous GYN -and- talked about
how great her previous GYN was.

She filed a complaint against this GYN with the clinic and the clinic responded by cutting her
as a patient because she was &quot;hostile&quot; to the doctor.

She is not alone, and sadly this clinic has been buying up the independent offices in the area,
forming a large operation/network.  Which means if you have been dropped by the clinic, there
are very limited alternatives.  I know she isn't the only one this has happened to because I
have heard this same story from others at the office she now goes to, and have been with other
people who went to the clinic and were chastised for &quot;harrassing the nurses&quot; because they had
been sitting for over 20 minutes in the waiting room and had come to the desk to find out how
much longer (there are signs on the wall that say if you have been waiting for over 20 minutes,
talk to a nurse).

I have my own issues with this same clinic, but those don't have anything to do with the
hostility toward/from the doctors.

In fact, Mum wishes she could eat more fiber but she can't. It's
weird, because before she was diagnosed with Crohn's, they done the
irritable bowel thing on her and had her on Fibogel for a long time.
And she felt well with it! Until her Crohn's started saying &quot;NO
FIBER!!!&quot; It's weird how things change. Me and Mum go on about it all
the time, how different our diet is even from a year ago. It's always
changing. I'm happy now that I can eat a bit more varied diet because
I'm on some medication now. But I do miss spaghetti bolognaise the
most! I can eat the bolognaise, so it's not that for sure, but it's
something to do with the spaghetti. I tried gluten free spaghetti and
still the same. I get terrible cramps and need the toilet a lot after
it.

Yes I think you're right about people of similar energy levels attract
to each other. I see that quite often. And I believe that counts on
the spiritual side of things too. It's how we're resonating/vibrating,
because we're all made up of energy. But then they go and have
children and we become a genetic dustbin haha! That's what I call
myself.

Oh god, my brother's bowel movements are normal! You wouldn't say that
if you smelt the room and the corridor to the bathroom afterwards
lmao! But I believe you. He doesn't tend to get any pains or anything.
Although, he also had an intolerance to spaghetti bolognaise. He used
to throw it up instantly. But my brother being the typical Phil
Mitchel type of guy, he'd come back and say &quot;oooh, room for more now&quot;
hahaha! He seemed to grow out of that with age and he's ok with SB
now. He does have a dodgy knee too which makes me wonder if he's got
tendencies. But he is a heavy weight guy, so I'm not surprised his
knee's hurt carrying that weight!

Oh I can tell you, my Mum's grandmother didn't move around! Her
husband done everything. She just sat at home all day long listening
to the radio and eating etc! Although being a cockney, she wasn't
adverse to getting into a street brawl with her broom or rolling pin!
What a woman lol! But I do think you're right, people in those days
lived completely different, and dare I say the food was a hell of a
lot more natural and healthier, even if they were eating dripping on
bread! And my grandmothers food having fag ash mixed in with it too,
because she used to have a fag hanging out of her mouth (cigarettes
btw to my American friends) whilst cooking. The food now days is
totally wrong. Even the organic (or fake organic) foods. And yes, I
have the same problem with budgeting, organic foods are too
expensive.

Ok, I'll steer away from water pills. I'll just have to deal with my
size. I'd love to get back into Jujitsu, I want nothing more (well
apart from the community) in life.

I don't like avocado. Hmm, we still have my fussiness issues on top of
having IBD. Besides, my Mum looooooooves avocado and she can't touch
it now days. She was naughty and touched it a little while ago and was
in terrible trouble. Pain, diarrhea, gas! I can't eat wholemeal bread
either, nothing brown (apart from chocolate). Anything like that hurts
me bad. I wouldn't eat marrows or courgettes either because of my
fussiness. I'm so fussy that even putting them in my mouth makes me
retch. It's terrible! But I'm a lot better than when I was younger. I
can't believe I eat mushrooms, I always used to think &quot;how could
anyone eat that, it's fungus!&quot;

Yes this community will be hard work, but that's why you have other
people involved because not everyone is capable of certain tasks. I
mean, I have to see on a day to day basis there, some days I can dig
and plant, other days I can't. But then again, I'd be good at the diy
tasks i.e. building a compost toilet etc. I've also already been
allocated doing the security there too, and the hunting. That's my
forte. So yeah, I'm up for that. And those things aren't too strenuous
for me. If they are one day, then I'll peel potatoes or teach the
children on the community. I think it's going to be a wonderful place
for children to grow up in. I was meant to grow up in a community when
I was a child, because my Mum has always wanted to do this, but the
last group fell apart. We do have other families involved. And you
mention holidays. Well me, Mum and two other ladies are going up to
Scotland in August to have a look at specific areas etc. So that'll be
our holiday. I'm looking forward to it. I just hope that I don't have
an episode like I've just had where I can't sit on my bum hole because
it feels like I've got a red hot poker up there, and I can't stand up
for more than a minute either because it feels like I'm going to give
birth to my womb and bowel! But I think that's gynaecological because
I get that whenever I get a period. Funnily enough, I started bleeding
two days after the pain set in. Mum also gets this. Ahhhhh genetics!

I remember the days when I was 55kg's......lol, I'm around 80kg's now.
But I must admit I did feel the cold a lot then. I suffer from
terrible hot flashes these days and I have a terrible sweating
problem. I soak my clothes through every day. And I look outside and
it's raining and windy, so why am I soaking through my clothes? Can't
stand the central heating on too. I have to say (back to genetics) my
dad and brother have exactly the same thing too. I used to think my
dad had something really weird wrong when he was burning up, but now I
know how it feels!

&gt; blockages and ileus from the Creon 20 (pancreatic enzymes).

&gt; Well, IBD is definitely in your family. I have a theory about people with
&gt; similar energy levels coming together and with similar energy levels come
&gt; similar diseases. The more I think about it, the more I believe that my dad
&gt; had psoriasis and, as I have mentioned, the Crohn's and GERD are on my
&gt; mother's side with an aunt having Crohn's and my grandmother popping Rennies
&gt; and clutching her chest all the time.

&gt; I know that you are going to find this difficult to believe, but your
&gt; brother's bowels are well within the normal range. This article explains the
&gt; variations from person to person very well http://www.familydoctor.co.uk/htdocs/BOWELS/BOWELS_specimen.html

&gt; Older people have had to be tougher, but they ate better when they were
&gt; younger and moved around more so were healthier and fitter. Their
&gt; expectations from the health system were also a lot lower as your
&gt; grandmother's statement shows. I can't believe that the high sugar and the
&gt; artificial stuff that is found in food is really not good for us. I do try
&gt; and eat as much organic food as possible, but my current finances are
&gt; tighter than they were in the past and the organic shop is a lot further
&gt; away.

&gt; I would steer you away from the water pills because IBD patients are at a
&gt; high risk of thromboses (strokes, pulmonary embolism, etc.) and you have
&gt; further increase to this risk taking the pill. I think that you will just
&gt; have to accept that you will have water retention until you can start karate
&gt; chopping people again and getting back to your drumming.

&gt; I am pleased that you are snacking on vegetables. I love olives and they
&gt; don't seem to cause me any major problems, possibly because they are so full
&gt; of oil that they do not get stuck. A tip would be to also try avocado. I
&gt; make a Crohn's guacomole with yoghurt and vitamin C (because of my GERD I
&gt; can't use lemon or eat tomatoes). They are very nutritional as a snack with
&gt; wholewheat bread or as a meal with rice and salmon. I never realised that
&gt; they were an ingredient of sushi until I started making it a few weeks ago.
&gt; Unfortunately, it does exacerbate my GERD so I am going to have to find a
&gt; way of making sticky rice without using any sugar or rice wine vinegar.
&gt; Baked marrow or courgettes might also introduce some variety into your diet
&gt; without hurting your gut. I love melon, but it causes me tremendous problems
&gt; so I have to do without. With respect to the mars bar and crisps, perhaps I
&gt; am just jealous because I cannot eat either of them due to GERD.

&gt; Your plans for growing your own food sound like far too much hard work for
&gt; me, but a very commendable enterprise. A lot of people had vegetable patches
&gt; in their gardens, but this is virtually a thing of the past. It would
&gt; certainly be a good thing to rekindle.

&gt; I hope that you and your mum are planning a holiday soon to get those stress
&gt; levels down. I will not be going on holiday this year because the finances
&gt; are a bit tight (I still have outstanding bills) and there is nowhere I
&gt; could go to be ill in comfort. However, my new doctor said that there is a
&gt; fair chance that I would be permitted to spend three weeks at a convalescent
&gt; clinic again. I completed the forms and took them to his office yesterday.
&gt; If I don't get permission then I won't be that upset because they do make us
&gt; work and I will have to pack two suitcases, but if I do then it will be my
&gt; holiday this year and I think a spell out of the flat will do me good. If I
&gt; do go it will be back to the same clinic as last year and to the same doctor
&gt; or nothing. The clinic did put me on the correct treatment for short bowel
&gt; syndrome (after 20 odd months of suffering from it) and thanks to them I am
&gt; hovering around my normal weight of 55 kg at 164 cm tall.

&gt; It is freezing here and my neighbour downstairs asserted herself at the
&gt; weekend and had the heating put back on. I wish that I had known that and I
&gt; would have put the radiators on in my flat. I was shivering so much that I
&gt; thought I was ill(er) - that combined with the medication fever and/or hot
&gt; flashes make for an interesting time. I have become so dopey that I don't
&gt; seem to be able to recognise cold anymore.

&gt; I find writing very cathartic, purging out

I'm very sorry you're having such a difficult time with your doctor.
One thing I've learned from my doctor is not to second guess.  I am
not a doctor, I don't know what test results mean or how to interpret
them.  I do know that doctors will take the whole picture into
account.  There are various test results which, when interpreted
together will indicate, or contraindicate medical conditions.  Your
doctor may be very correct when he/she says not to worry about a
specific &quot;symptom&quot;.  Sometimes medicine is not clear-cut.  Sometimes
doctors have ambiguous results and have to take a guess ( a well
educated guess but none the less, a guess) at what the problem is and
the correct treatment.  Unless you've had medical training I would not
attempt to interpret your own test results.  That doesn't mean you
shouldn't seek out 2nd and maybe even 3rd opinions.  In my case, I
have mild hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol) which in itself is not
necessarily a danger.  The high cholesterol coupled with my weight and
family history DOES indicate potential problems.  Therefore, after
considering all of the elements, my doctor put me on a statin drug
(zocor).  I'm fortunate because there are 100s, if not 1000s of good
doctors to pick from in the area where I live.

I would kill for a bowl of spaghbol, but it just is not worth it. In the
supermarkets I find myself putting forbidden things in my shopping trolley
and then having to put them back on the shelves because I know that I will
be ill. It just isn't worth it, I have learnt. I think that watching me
shopping must be a little Mr Beanesque. I know what you mean about the
organic food, because if you grow produce next to industries or motorways
how can you call it organic? Shame about the avocados, but I will eat some
for you tomorrow. I had a real craving for stuffed marrow today, but I
haven't seen any in the local supermarkets here. It is probably too down
market food for we 'Germans' and we send them over to England. However, I
have a courgette in the fridge and will have a bash at stuffing that
tomorrow - perhaps, with couscous and olives and yoghurt.

I hope that the gynae sorts you out. I frequently ask myself how ill must I
be before anyone helps me and I am trying my best to look after myself
properly, although it is tough with the much reduced energy levels. You
might have to buy yourself an inflatable ring to sit on to relieve your
nether regions. Perhaps, you could get one on the NHS??? Anyway, please make
sure that you site your community somewhere where you and your mum can get
to the hospital in good time in an emergency.

Your great grandmother sounds very energetic to me - regular street brawling
must have required a lot of stamina. My grandmother on my father's side was
a similar type - very assertive and forthright - she was Scottish. If your
brother is so big, he is an obvious candidate for osteoarthritis, which is
degeneration of the joints due to excessive wear and tear. It is very common
in fat and especially obese people. I very frequently look at apparently
healthy people and think that if I had their body it would look a lot better
than it does now. However, my track record is not good as I have always
tried to look after this one properly and all it has done is to steadily
fall to bits. Such is my karma. I was talking to a friend last week and she
explained to me that her Buddhist faith explained illness, etc., as
punishment for one's behavious in a previous life. I think that was what she
was trying to convey to me. I was trying to imagine what I could possibly
have done and laughed out loud at a few pictures that sprang to mind. I
think that I hurt her feelings, so I am going to have to patch that one up.
I am not very spiritual - more of a heathen actually, but have not danced
around stone circles recently (well never actually).

Doc,

She complained to the wrong person.  The complaint should be filed with the State.  And, any retaliatory action should be filed as an additional complaint.

&gt;&gt;Oh I've heard all kinds of crap like that too! And they're allowed to
&gt;&gt;piss you off beyond belief, but all over our hospital there's posters
&gt;&gt;saying abuse towards staff will not be tolerated. So we're allowed
&gt;&gt;abuse, but it doesn't work both ways.

&gt; My ex-wife was treated poorly by the GYN at her doctor's clinic.  After 2 visits in which this
&gt; doctor didn't look at her, but chastised her for questioning her previous GYN -and- talked about
&gt; how great her previous GYN was.

&gt; She filed a complaint against this GYN with the clinic and the clinic responded by cutting her
&gt; as a patient because she was &quot;hostile&quot; to the doctor.

&gt; She is not alone, and sadly this clinic has been buying up the independent offices in the area,
&gt; forming a large operation/network.  Which means if you have been dropped by the clinic, there
&gt; are very limited alternatives.  I know she isn't the only one this has happened to because I
&gt; have heard this same story from others at the office she now goes to, and have been with other
&gt; people who went to the clinic and were chastised for &quot;harrassing the nurses&quot; because they had
&gt; been sitting for over 20 minutes in the waiting room and had come to the desk to find out how
&gt; much longer (there are signs on the wall that say if you have been waiting for over 20 minutes,
&gt; talk to a nurse).

&gt; I have my own issues with this same clinic, but those don't have anything to do with the
&gt; hostility toward/from the doctors.

I disagree in not second guessing your doctor.  If you GI will not discuss your results, what they mean and the various implications you better RUN to the exit and find a GI whose ego won't get in the way of your treatment.

Peter, whilst I understand what you are saying, am I right in thinking
that you do not live in the UK, thus do not have the same kind of
health system as the UK does? Let me explain...in the UK we have
something called the NHS. Now, I don't want to go into great detail of
what that is or how it works (I'm very tired right now), but to cut a
long story short, the NHS is totally corrupted, and behind the scenes
there are specific rules and targets set to the consultants and his
team in each department. And it spread out further than that actually.
But you'd be very lucky if you got one team (say gastroenterology and
gynaecology) to correspond with another. They do not do this, and as
far as they are concerned each part of your body is a separate issue.
Also, there are strict perameters set for the guidelines of test
results that if you are within (which doesn't necessarily mean you're
test results were positive) you are told your test results are
positive. It has come to air especially through incorrect diagnosis of
thyroid problems within the NHS system. This is all to cut back on
money. Basically, if you die, you cost the system less money. I know
this must sound crazy to you, but that's how it is. So through all of
this, I have had to educate myself on my own conditions, medication
and anatomy, because no one will care about you as much as you care
about yourself. And also, on the NHS, there are targets that one must
get a certain amount of patients per year off their books, no matter
how they go about that. If they do not meet their targets, then
they're in trouble.

Oh gosh I can't stand all these scare tactics that are rammed into
religions. I can explain to you about the true essence of karma, which
is not as we think it is. Oh, us humans have to dramatise everything
don't we, and find reasons to blame for things. So, the way it goes is
this....Yes, we have past lives. We take physical lives as the
physical plane is that of a school, so to speak. We take physical
lives for reason of progression. We are seeded from the source as a
perfect being. But we must go through a process of re-joining back
with the source, but this time with all the knowledge that can
possibly be accumulated. So through physical lives, we go through a
progression of experiences. We eventually must have experienced
everything, and understood it fully. This takes many thousands of
physical years, thus leading to many thousands of lives. Now,
karma....many people think it is &quot;you killed my son in that past life,
so now I must kill your son to make up for it&quot;, no, not at all. The
fact that you experienced the death of your son is one experience that
you have...well, experienced! And the same goes for every other party
involved. Now things come back on us in lives that maybe we didn't
fully get through in a previous life. For instance and to use myself
as an example, I've had many lives where I was tremendously physically
fit and healthy, and always escaped what I went through
psychologically through the use of my physical abilities. This means I
never had to deal with the psychological shit. Now, in this life, I am
disabled for a way for me to get to grips with this psychological
stuff. And remember, nothing is giving to you that you can't handle.
And if you commit suicide because you can't handle it, then it was
your tapestry to commit suicide. We all choose our tapestry before we
take a life (yes, I know, hard to believe we chose this, right?) for
the lessons that we feel we need to experience. But we are not
punished for things we have done in a past life. No, not at all. When
we go back Home, we have no one to answer to but ourselves. And when
we go back Home after a physical life has ended, we end up in a place
called The Halls of Healing. And here we heal to get over the life we
have just finished. So, all is settled then and there. No debts to
pay! But like I said, most religions like to use fear tactics into
making us a good person in this life. The true essence of being good
is because we choose to be good, not because we're scared to not be
good!

Anyway, onto my gynae experience today lol!

I really liked this hospital and the gynaecology department there. I'm
glad my GP was right in her recommendation
to me to go there. Anyway, basically he said that everything I'm
presenting to him does indeed indicate towards endometriosis. And he
said that if I didn't have Crohn's, then he's have no qualms in
booking me in right now for a laparoscopy, which would find it, or not
if endometriosis is not the case. But he's worried about the risks
associated with my Crohn's (i.e. adhesions building up). So he wants
to talk it over with his team and see what they all come up with
together. In the meantime he's also told me to get a smear test at my
GP's and get them to send it on to him, and also the next time I bleed
(on the 2nd-5th day) I have to go along and get my bloods taken to
check my hormones, ovaries etc. He also wants to look at my thyroid
functioning, because he thinks that's in the running of suspicions
too. Especially to do with my hot flushes all the time and terrible
hot sweats. It's awful, I soak my clothes through when everyone else
thinks it's cold! Anyway, at the end of it all, if they do find it's
endometriosis, then I need to have this injection (Zo-something lol)
which is a medical way of technically killing the ovaries (although
they'll come alive again if I stop the injections lol), which will
unfortunately put me into menopause. But, if I get too many side
effects of menopause symptoms, then I can take a small combined
hormone pill which will combat that. So, all very daunting to say the
least! But I like how he's not just brushing me off, he's working by a
series of elimination, and I'm set to see him again in 6 weeks to see
what the whole team has to say. I told him I'm up for a laparoscopy
(sp?) if they are. He said the breakthrough bleeding isn't his main
concern, because he said that can be quite typical on the pill
continuously, but it's the tremendous pain that concerns him. Like I
said, he said it does all point towards endometriosis, especially
noting the family history on both my mother and father's side. But
they were a very nice and good department. I'm not used to that! I
wonder what their gastric department is like......lol!

&gt; Your great grandmother sounds very energetic to me - regular street brawling

&gt; degeneration of the joints due to excessive wear and tear. It is very common
&gt; in fat and especially obese people. I very frequently look at apparently

&gt; than it does now. However, my track record is not good as I have always

&gt; In fact, Mum wishes she could eat more fiber but she can't. It's
&gt; weird, because before she was diagnosed with Crohn's, they done the
&gt; irritable bowel thing on her and had her on Fibogel for a long time.
&gt; And she felt well with it! Until her Crohn's started saying &quot;NO
&gt; FIBER!!!&quot; It's weird how things change. Me and Mum go on about it all
&gt; the time, how different our diet is even from a year ago. It's always
&gt; changing. I'm happy now that I can eat a bit more varied diet because
&gt; I'm on some medication now. But I do miss spaghetti bolognaise the
&gt; most! I can eat the bolognaise, so it's not that for sure, but it's
&gt; something to do with the spaghetti. I tried gluten free spaghetti and
&gt; still the same. I get terrible cramps and need the toilet a lot after
&gt; it.

&gt; Yes I think you're right about people of similar energy levels attract
&gt; to each other. I see that quite often. And I believe that counts on
&gt; the spiritual side of things too. It's how we're resonating/vibrating,
&gt; because we're all made up of energy. But then they go and have
&gt; children and we become a genetic dustbin haha! That's what I call
&gt; myself.

&gt; Oh god, my brother's bowel movements are normal! You wouldn't say that
&gt; if you smelt the room and the corridor to the bathroom afterwards
&gt; lmao! But I believe you. He doesn't tend to get any pains or anything.
&gt; Although, he also had an intolerance to spaghetti bolognaise. He used
&gt; to throw it up instantly. But my brother being the typical Phil
&gt; Mitchel type of guy, he'd come back and say &quot;oooh, room for more now&quot;
&gt; hahaha! He seemed to grow out of that with age and he's ok with SB
&gt; now. He does have a dodgy knee too which makes me wonder if he's got
&gt; tendencies. But he is a heavy weight guy, so I'm not surprised his
&gt; knee's hurt carrying that weight!

&gt; Oh I can tell you, my Mum's grandmother didn't move around! Her
&gt; husband done everything. She just sat at home all day long listening
&gt; to the radio and eating etc! Although being a cockney, she wasn't
&gt; adverse to getting into a street brawl with her broom or rolling pin!
&gt; What a woman lol! But I do think you're right, people in those days
&gt; lived completely different, and dare I say the food was a hell of a
&gt; lot more natural and healthier, even if they were eating dripping on
&gt; bread! And my grandmothers food having fag ash mixed in with it too,

What I like is a doctor that will talk to me as if I'm another
doctor...tell me everything, in detail, and in clinical language.  If I
don't understand I'll ask, and he'd better be ready to give me an answer
I understand.  Because I'm gonna keep asking until he does.

Used to know a military Flight Surgeon like that...really liked him,
though he couldn't actually treat me.

&gt;&gt;In fact, Mum wishes she could eat more fiber but she can't. It's
&gt;&gt;weird, because before she was diagnosed with Crohn's, they done the
&gt;&gt;irritable bowel thing on her and had her on Fibogel for a long time.
&gt;&gt;And she felt well with it! Until her Crohn's started saying &quot;NO
&gt;&gt;FIBER!!!&quot; It's weird how things change. Me and Mum go on about it all
&gt;&gt;the time, how different our diet is even from a year ago. It's always
&gt;&gt;changing. I'm happy now that I can eat a bit more varied diet because
&gt;&gt;I'm on some medication now. But I do miss spaghetti bolognaise the
&gt;&gt;most! I can eat the bolognaise, so it's not that for sure, but it's
&gt;&gt;something to do with the spaghetti. I tried gluten free spaghetti and
&gt;&gt;still the same. I get terrible cramps and need the toilet a lot after
&gt;&gt;it.

&gt;&gt;Yes I think you're right about people of similar energy levels attract
&gt;&gt;to each other. I see that quite often. And I believe that counts on
&gt;&gt;the spiritual side of things too. It's how we're resonating/vibrating,
&gt;&gt;because we're all made up of energy. But then they go and have
&gt;&gt;children and we become a genetic dustbin haha! That's what I call
&gt;&gt;myself.

&gt;&gt;Oh god, my brother's bowel movements are normal! You wouldn't say that
&gt;&gt;if you smelt the room and the corridor to the bathroom afterwards
&gt;&gt;lmao! But I believe you. He doesn't tend to get any pains or anything.
&gt;&gt;Although, he also had an intolerance to spaghetti bolognaise. He used
&gt;&gt;to throw it up instantly. But my brother being the typical Phil
&gt;&gt;Mitchel type of guy, he'd come back and say &quot;oooh, room for more now&quot;
&gt;&gt;hahaha! He seemed to grow out of that with age and he's ok with SB
&gt;&gt;now. He does have a dodgy knee too which makes me wonder if he's got
&gt;&gt;tendencies. But he is a heavy weight guy, so I'm not surprised his
&gt;&gt;knee's hurt carrying that weight!

&gt;&gt;Oh I can tell you, my Mum's grandmother didn't move around! Her
&gt;&gt;husband done everything. She just sat at home all day long listening

OMG to coin a phrase. This might lead to a higher quality of life. Are you
ready for it after so many years of suffering?

It is good that you are strong, otherwise the 'it's all in your head'
psychobabble from the other docs. might have sent you over the edge. Pains
from endometriosis are also meant to be amongst the worse.

I will keep my fingers crossed that they come up with a solution. I also
think that the doctor's appraisal of the risks of laparoscopic examination
is absolutely correct. I bet that you have loads of adhesions on top of
everything else.

The doc. sounds like a breath of fresh air after all you have had to put up
with. The previous experience is part of the Karma associated with being
born female - we are far too complicated for the average doctor.

Wouldn't it be lovely if they could sort you out before you go on your
scouting trip to Scotland.

Oh gosh I can't stand all these scare tactics that are rammed into
religions. I can explain to you about the true essence of karma, which
is not as we think it is. Oh, us humans have to dramatise everything
don't we, and find reasons to blame for things. So, the way it goes is
this....Yes, we have past lives. We take physical lives as the
physical plane is that of a school, so to speak. We take physical
lives for reason of progression. We are seeded from the source as a
perfect being. But we must go through a process of re-joining back
with the source, but this time with all the knowledge that can
possibly be accumulated. So through physical lives, we go through a
progression of experiences. We eventually must have experienced
everything, and understood it fully. This takes many thousands of
physical years, thus leading to many thousands of lives. Now,
karma....many people think it is &quot;you killed my son in that past life,
so now I must kill your son to make up for it&quot;, no, not at all. The
fact that you experienced the death of your son is one experience that
you have...well, experienced! And the same goes for every other party
involved. Now things come back on us in lives that maybe we didn't
fully get through in a previous life. For instance and to use myself
as an example, I've had many lives where I was tremendously physically
fit and healthy, and always escaped what I went through
psychologically through the use of my physical abilities. This means I
never had to deal with the psychological shit. Now, in this life, I am
disabled for a way for me to get to grips with this psychological
stuff. And remember, nothing is giving to you that you can't handle.
And if you commit suicide because you can't handle it, then it was
your tapestry to commit suicide. We all choose our tapestry before we
take a life (yes, I know, hard to believe we chose this, right?) for
the lessons that we feel we need to experience. But we are not
punished for things we have done in a past life. No, not at all. When
we go back Home, we have no one to answer to but ourselves. And when
we go back Home after a physical life has ended, we end up in a place
called The Halls of Healing. And here we heal to get over the life we
have just finished. So, all is settled then and there. No debts to
pay! But like I said, most religions like to use fear tactics into
making us a good person in this life. The true essence of being good
is because we choose to be good, not because we're scared to not be
good!

Anyway, onto my gynae experience today lol!

I really liked this hospital and the gynaecology department there. I'm
glad my GP was right in her recommendation
to me to go there. Anyway, basically he said that everything I'm
presenting to him does indeed indicate towards endometriosis. And he
said that if I didn't have Crohn's, then he's have no qualms in
booking me in right now for a laparoscopy, which would find it, or not
if endometriosis is not the case. But he's worried about the risks
associated with my Crohn's (i.e. adhesions building up). So he wants
to talk it over with his team and see what they all come up with
together. In the meantime he's also told me to get a smear test at my
GP's and get them to send it on to him, and also the next time I bleed
(on the 2nd-5th day) I have to go along and get my bloods taken to
check my hormones, ovaries etc. He also wants to look at my thyroid
functioning, because he thinks that's in the running of suspicions
too. Especially to do with my hot flushes all the time and terrible
hot sweats. It's awful, I soak my clothes through when everyone else
thinks it's cold! Anyway, at the end of it all, if they do find it's
endometriosis, then I need to have this injection (Zo-something lol)
which is a medical way of technically killing the ovaries (although
they'll come alive again if I stop the injections lol), which will
unfortunately put me into menopause. But, if I get too many side
effects of menopause symptoms, then I can take a small combined
hormone pill which will combat that. So, all very daunting to say the
least! But I like how he's not just brushing me off, he's working by a
series of elimination, and I'm set to see him again in 6 weeks to see
what the whole team has to say. I told him I'm up for a laparoscopy
(sp?) if they are. He said the breakthrough bleeding isn't his main
concern, because he said that can be quite typical on the pill
continuously, but it's the tremendous pain that concerns him. Like I
said, he said it does all point towards endometriosis, especially
noting the family history on both my mother and father's side. But
they were a very nice and good department. I'm not used to that! I
wonder what their gastric department is like......lol!

&gt; a similar type - very assertive and forthright - she was Scottish. If your

&gt; degeneration of the joints due to excessive wear and tear. It is very
&gt; common
&gt; in fat and especially obese people. I very frequently look at apparently

Well seems like you like the feedback I've given you on this Dr and my
condition, and his plans and workings. And when you give it the thumbs
up, then I feel much better about it, because I trust your judgment.
You've always shown a great deal of knowledge, and a great deal of
experience from these things that go on. And you know how things
should be working (with the body, with the medical system, with Dr's)
and how they shouldn't be working. So, I'm happy that you've given
this the thumbs up.

The only part I find daunting is this medical menopause being a
possibility if this is indeed endometriosis. Although, I think I
should weigh it up a bit here - the problems and discomfort I'm going
through, or menopausal symptoms (which I can be helped with too) and
the heightened risk of heart disease (or that of being at an equal
risk to a man anyway). I suppose enough ladies my age have to make
this kind of choice, so I'm not on my own.

Anyway, yes, if they can sort me out then I do very much look forward
a heightened quality of life! Although it'll feel very harsh and like
I've been thrown into deep water, as I'll have to come off of
disability benefits and find a job which can keep me, when all I'm
really qualified at is being a musician. Not a lot of work out there
in music that pays enough to be able to keep you! Maybe I'll be lucky
like my friend Luke (who's also a musician, we were at college
together) who got himself a job in a bacon factory, and then got
promoted to working on the computer side of things at the factory, and
is now brining in over £20,000 per annum. That being very good for a
22 year old lad who lives with his Mum and doesn't have to pay one
single bill because all the bills get paid for by his Mum's benefits!
So all that £20,000 per annum goes straight into his pocket. Very nice
indeed haha!

Right, I'm off to bed now. Just got back from my Grandma's birthday
and my throat is wrecked. I have a very loud cockney family, so it's
hours of shouting trying to be heard instead of nicely talking lol!

I'm also wondering when my knuckle is going to get better. A while ago
I got in a seriously bad temper and punched a door twice, full force.
It jarred up my little finger and the one next to it, couldn't move
them, very painful. Thought it was broken. But the next day they were
moving, but a terrible bruise took over my hand. It's all mobile now
(this was all about 2 weeks ago) but that part between my two knuckles
is still painful to touch. Do you think I've probably cracked the bone
or something? Don't want to bother with A&amp;E when they'll take one look
at it (with full mobility and no bruising now) and tell me off for
wasting hospital time!

Good night,
Musashi

&gt; Oh gosh I can't stand all these scare tactics that are rammed into
&gt; religions. I can explain to you about the true essence of karma, which
&gt; is not as we think it is. Oh, us humans have to dramatise everything
&gt; don't we, and find reasons to blame for things. So, the way it goes is
&gt; this....Yes, we have past lives. We take physical lives as the
&gt; physical plane is that of a school, so to speak. We take physical
&gt; lives for reason of progression. We are seeded from the source as a
&gt; perfect being. But we must go through a process of re-joining back
&gt; with the source, but this time with all the knowledge that can
&gt; possibly be accumulated. So through physical lives, we go through a
&gt; progression of experiences. We eventually must have experienced
&gt; everything, and understood it fully. This takes many thousands of
&gt; physical years, thus leading to many thousands of lives. Now,
&gt; karma....many people think it is &quot;you killed my son in that past life,
&gt; so now I must kill your son to make up for it&quot;, no, not at all. The
&gt; fact that you experienced the death of your son is one experience that
&gt; you have...well, experienced! And the same goes for every other party
&gt; involved. Now things come back on us in lives that maybe we didn't
&gt; fully get through in a previous life. For instance and to use myself
&gt; as an example, I've had many lives where I was tremendously physically
&gt; fit and healthy, and always escaped what I went through
&gt; psychologically through the use of my physical abilities. This means I
&gt; never had to deal with the psychological shit. Now, in this life, I am
&gt; disabled for a way for me to get to grips with this psychological
&gt; stuff. And remember, nothing is giving to you that you can't handle.
&gt; And if you commit suicide because you can't handle it, then it was
&gt; your tapestry to commit suicide. We all choose our tapestry before we
&gt; take a life (yes, I know, hard to believe we chose this, right?) for
&gt; the lessons that we feel we need to experience. But we are not
&gt; punished for things we have done in a past life. No, not at all. When
&gt; we go back Home, we have no one to answer to but ourselves. And when
&gt; we go back Home after a physical life has ended, we end up in a place
&gt; called The Halls of Healing. And here we heal to get over the life we
&gt; have just finished. So, all is settled then and there. No debts to
&gt; pay! But like I said, most religions like to use fear tactics into
&gt; making us a good person in this life. The true essence of being good
&gt; is because we choose to be good, not because we're scared to not be
&gt; good!

&gt; Anyway, onto my gynae experience today lol!

&gt; I really liked this hospital and the gynaecology department there. I'm
&gt; glad my GP was right in her recommendation
&gt; to me to go there. Anyway, basically he said that everything I'm
&gt; presenting to him does indeed indicate towards endometriosis. And he
&gt; said that if I didn't have Crohn's, then he's have no qualms in
&gt; booking me in right now for a laparoscopy, which would find it, or not
&gt; if endometriosis is not the case. But he's worried about the risks
&gt; associated with my Crohn's (i.e. adhesions building up). So he wants
&gt; to talk it over with his team and see what they all come up with
&gt; together. In the meantime he's also told me to get a smear test at my
&gt; GP's and get them to send it on to him, and also the next time I bleed
&gt; (on the 2nd-5th day) I have to go along and get my bloods taken to
&gt; check my hormones, ovaries etc. He also wants to look at my thyroid
&gt; functioning, because he thinks that's in the running of suspicions
&gt; too. Especially to do with my hot flushes all the time and terrible
&gt; hot sweats. It's awful, I soak my clothes through when everyone else
&gt; thinks it's cold! Anyway, at the end of it all, if they do find it's
&gt; endometriosis, then I need to have this injection (Zo-something lol)
&gt; which is a medical way of technically killing the ovaries (although
&gt; they'll come alive again if I stop the injections lol), which will
&gt; unfortunately put me into menopause. But, if I get too many side
&gt; effects of menopause symptoms, then I can take a small combined
&gt; hormone pill which will combat that. So, all very daunting to say the
&gt; least! But I like how he's not just brushing me off, he's working by a
&gt; series of elimination, and I'm set to see him again in 6 weeks to see
&gt; what the whole team has to say. I told him I'm up for a laparoscopy
&gt; (sp?) if they are. He said the breakthrough bleeding isn't his main
&gt; concern, because he said that can be quite typical on the pill
&gt; continuously, but it's the tremendous pain that concerns him. Like I
&gt; said, he said it does all point towards endometriosis, especially
&gt; noting the family history on both my mother and father's side. But
&gt; they were a very nice and good department. I'm not used to that! I
&gt; wonder what their gastric department is like......lol!

A caveat about your new doctor: I have good doctors, but they also get my
back up occassionally. After all we are all human and we all make mistakes.
So don't be surprised if the new doctor also pisses you off occasionally
despite all his good qualities ;-)

From what I have read about endometriosis most severe cases end up in
hysterectomy and oophrectomy even very young patients. I hadn't heard about
medical menopause as an option until you mentioned it, probably because it
was not an option in my case. I have read up on this subject because there
was suspicion of endometriosis in my case and I did have a small
grapefruit-sized endometrial cyst that they removed along with polyps and a
fluid fibroid when I was surgically castrated at the age of 42. Every item
removed was also coated with adhesions and the womb had to be removed in two
parts because it was so heavily embedded in adhesions, which [probably]
meant that I would never have been able to carry a child to term anyway.
However, the endometrial tissue had not leaked out into the body cavity. Do
you remember last year we had a visitor here who had anal bleeding and was
then found to have a fistula between the womb and the rectum with
endometriosis in the rectum? I have forgotten her name, but I believe that
it began with a G.

With the right hormonal treatment, I bet that your artificial menopause will
be an absolute walk over compared to everything else that you have gone
through. Let's face it you are a veteran of this lark.

Whatever happens, based on my experience, I do not recommend that anyone has
surgery until it is the only option left. Each surgery that I have had has
been a great short-term solution, but has always led to long-term problems,
even if it is only (!) adhesions.  I have 9 surgeries behind me - well some
of them involved my behind ;-)

With heightened quality of life I don't mean that you will necessarily be
able to come off the disability benefits. Let us not run before we can walk.
I would relax and see how it goes. Only when you can really get through your
days with no major problems, start pursuing your hobbies again and build up
your level of fitness will you then be able to think about jobs and job
hunting. You really need 6 months in which your health is totally stabilised
with no major setbacks prior to any trips to the job centre. With everything
that you currently have on your plate I think that you should not worry
about that aspect. I came off disability far too soon in early 1995 and I
was in a lot better shape than you are now. However, I was desperate to
kick-start my life again - it was hard, but I managed it of sorts, although
the daily grind was not as easy to deal with compared to my healthy
colleagues and lots of evening I crashed into bed at 20:30 or so. You could
end up making yourself extremely ill by trying to do too much too soon. I
know that you have your mother as a shining example of persevering in the
face of adversity, but your illness is  anonother level and because you have
proven pan-intestinal Crohn's the possibility of you going into real
remission at any given time is more remote. Sorry, I don't want to burst any
bubbles here, but I also don't want to see you worrying about work and
making yourself sicker. Take one day at a time.

If, after the next lot of treatment, you start to feel well enough to do a
little work, then what about finding a study course in, for example, music
that you can do as distance learning - CBT - computer based training. What
about African drumming or some other drumming techniques or mediaeval music
theory? I would like to do the latter, but I have never managed to get my
head around music theory. This will act as a trial and will see if you can
build up to working increasing numbers of hours per week without it having
any detrimental effects on your health. If you are upfront with the college
or Uni about your disability then you will be able to negotiate increasing
the length of the course for the same price. There might also be reduced
prices and other benefits for disabled students.
http://www.nacc.org.uk/downloads/factsheets/GoingToUniversity.pdf

I finished my MBA as a distance learning project while I was recovering from
the massive flare and three operations in 1992/93/94 this enabled me to
close the gap on my CV. I had to stop studying fulltime in March 1992
because it was no longer possible for me to concentrate or travel to the
university. The university was really good to me, they waived the rest of my
fees (they were paid from the Uni charity) and they said I could take as
long as I wanted to finished. I was extremely grateful to them for this as I
didn't have to apply for anything - the business manager organised
everything - he had known me by name and we had met in person over a period
of six months. I did supply him with a letter from my GP describing my
illness and this leaflet from the NACC will help
http://www.nacc.org.uk/downloads/factsheets/LecturersCanHelp.pdf I did the
exams in a room on my own with my table piled high with food and drink to
get me through. I can't find a doctor's letter, but here is a bullet point
letter (scroll down) to an insurance company here
http://www.ccfc.ca/English/info/brochures/insurance.html you can draft one
for your doctor based on this should you wish to study.
http://www.ccfc.ca/English/info/brochures/insurance.html Before you do
anything check that studying a couple of hours a week is not going to have
any adverse effect on your disability benefit - I doubt it, but you should
check just do make sure. I have just read that there is normally a
disability officer at the Uni and full time students can apply for a
disabled students allowance and can get financial support for buying
computers, etc. I had a friend, who in 1992, went to Uni for the firsttime
and he was about 38 with dyslexia. He ended up with a computer and a lot of
other support from his establishment.

Perhaps, this document found on the NACC pages will help you not worry about
work http://www.nacc.org.uk/downloads/disability/pca.pdf . I don't think
that you should think about work this year and probably not next year. At
the moment your condition is not controlled by treatment, although your
doctors are slowly getting there.

With respect to your hand it is possible that you might have chipped the
bone, but as it was wood and not concrete it might be more likely a ripped
muscle or strained tendon. I suggest that you stick to pillows and beating
your bed up in future or drive off to a deserted field and scream your lungs
out. I would keep an eye on it and ask your GP to look at it the next time
you see him, but as it is not broken there is probably very little they
would be able to do anyway. I remember that I ripped a muscle in my leg in
1989 or so, overdoing it in my weight training session, and it took
absolutely ages to heal, perhaps 6 months or so (my memory is hazy here).
Bones usually take a couple of months to heal, but muscles and tendons can
take several months or even years to get sorted out.

All the best,

Vanny

Well seems like you like the feedback I've given you on this Dr and my
condition, and his plans and workings. And when you give it the thumbs
up, then I feel much better about it, because I trust your judgment.
You've always shown a great deal of knowledge, and a great deal of
experience from these things that go on. And you know how things
should be working (with the body, with the medical system, with Dr's)
and how they shouldn't be working. So, I'm happy that you've given
this the thumbs up.

The only part I find daunting is this medical menopause being a
possibility if this is indeed endometriosis. Although, I think I
should weigh it up a bit here - the problems and discomfort I'm going
through, or menopausal symptoms (which I can be helped with too) and
the heightened risk of heart disease (or that of being at an equal
risk to a man anyway). I suppose enough ladies my age have to make
this kind of choice, so I'm not on my own.

Anyway, yes, if they can sort me out then I do very much look forward
a heightened quality of life! Although it'll feel very harsh and like
I've been thrown into deep water, as I'll have to come off of
disability benefits and find a job which can keep me, when all I'm
really qualified at is being a musician. Not a lot of work out there
in music that pays enough to be able to keep you! Maybe I'll be lucky
like my friend Luke (who's also a musician, we were at college
together) who got himself a job in a bacon factory, and then got
promoted to working on the computer side of things at the factory, and
is now brining in over £20,000 per annum. That being very good for a
22 year old lad who lives with his Mum and doesn't have to pay one
single bill because all the bills get paid for by his Mum's benefits!
So all that £20,000 per annum goes straight into his pocket. Very nice
indeed haha!

Musashi,

Wow, I hope things turn around for you. Sorry I have not been around
too much lately, life is finally starting to get back to &quot;normal&quot;
since Dad died (I really miss him). I can't believe it has been almost
6 months.

I don't really have any recommendations for you... just wanting to
offer some support and encouragement. I hope that you either find a
new Dr or this one starts to tune into you better.

Hang in there!

Yes, my aunt who had endometriosis had a hysterectomy. I think she was
in her 30's, although not sure where in her 30's. But I know she had
always wanted children, and she finally met a man, and got married,
and as soon as she was married she had to have a hysterectomy. She
kinda has been loopy ever since really, what that done to. But then
again, she is my dad's sister, and loopiness runs in that family haha!

Oh no, no, no, don't get me wrong, I really don't want to get back to
work yet! I'm definitely not well enough. In fact, when I was working,
I felt a thousand times better than I do now, and I still always had
to quit my jobs because they'd make me sick. So in no way am I ready
to work again. But what I mean is the minute that your Dr's say you're
not disabled (remember, they think that being disabled and being sick
are two different things) anymore, you lose your disability benefit.
That doesn't mean to say I'd lose my incapacity (sickness) benefit
though. But it was hard enough getting disability benefit (they denied
me, I had to go to appeal) even though I was in a wheelchair at the
time. Even if you can read a recipe, they deny you disability benefit!
It's really silly. But when I was denied, all they could keep saying
to me &quot;we're not denying that you're sick, we're denying that you're
disabled&quot;. As far as I'm concerned, they both go hand in hand. And
there are hundreds of different ways of being disabled. We don't all
have to be a vegetable to be disabled! But I only got it because my GI
wrote a letter about me being in a wheelchair etc. Now days, I
wouldn't get it, because I'm not in the wheelchair and so no one would
write that. And if I lost my disability benefit, I couldn't afford to
live. I get disability and incapacity right now, but that only leaves
me with £10 per month for myself for any extras. So if I lost
disability, then I'd probably be on the streets. Well, if Mum's
marital home wasn't sold. She helps me out as much as she can (because
I can't afford my rent and every bit of my bills - plus she lives with
me full time too now) but she also has to pay half the bills back at
the marital home. We could manage if the marital home sold though and
I lost my disability benefit.

But all I'm trying to say if whether you can work or not means nothing
to whether you're disabled or not. So if I lost my disability now, I'd
have to work even if that killed me. I'd have to become a prostitute
lmao, although that'd be difficult too now because of the endo lmao!
Oh god, isn't life fun?

As for the studying....I couldn't afford to study. I've been
desperately wanting to do a distance herbal medicine diploma, but I
can't afford it. So I'm teaching herbal medicine to myself, from
books. Then on the community I can have my own little herb patch and
learn through the practical side too. But yes, I'd love to study, but
it's so expensive to study here now. Most uni students now come out in
£20,000 worth of debt, if they're not lucky enough to have their
parents support. I wouldn't have any support. Even a lesser course
(like the herbal medicine is £450) is still money I can't afford. I'd
love to learn little things here and there, like wicker basket making
etc. But so expensive! The last course I did was a 10 week counselling
skills course, run by my Mum's ex colleague. Mum also taught there,
but I couldn't have my Mum teach me, so I went for her colleagues
class.

And yes, I do sort of remember that woman who came here with the endo/
rectal issue. I can't remember her name either. Didn't it also cause a
kink in her sigmoid colon? Crohn's and women's problems have so much
to answer for, and they're so ignored it's terrible!

Thanks for the advice on my hand. I think it's the tendon. I'll just
leave it then and hopefully after a long wait it'll get better. My
best friend (the martial artist) said it'll hurt for a long time too
lol! And I don't think I'd be satisfied with punching the bed or
pillow, I need something hard. I would have taken it out on my punch
bag but I had locked myself in my bedroom haha!

&gt; long as I wanted to finished. I was extremely grateful to them for this as I
&gt; didn't have to apply for anything - the business manager organised
&gt; everything - he had known me by name and we had met in person over a period
&gt; of six months. I did supply him with a letter from my GP describing my
&gt; illness and this leaflet from the NACC will help http://www.nacc.org.uk/downloads/factsheets/LecturersCanHelp.pdf I did the
&gt; exams in a room on my own with my table piled high with food and drink to
&gt; get me through. I can't find a doctor's letter, but here is a bullet point
&gt; letter (scroll down) to an insurance company here http://www.ccfc.ca/English/info/brochures/insurance.htmlyou can draft one
&gt; for your doctor based on this should you wish to study. http://www.ccfc.ca/English/info/brochures/insurance.htmlBefore you do
&gt; anything check that studying a couple of hours a week is not going to have
&gt; any adverse effect on your disability benefit - I doubt it, but you should

Thanks for the wishes :o)

Good to see you around again. It's shocking that it has been 6 months
since your father died. Time truly does go fast! I hope that things
feel a little easier for you, although I understand they'll never be
totally easy.

I have heard of people successfully adopting children if they have not been
able to have their own. Has your aunt considered this? Mind you, if she is
loopy then she will not have much of a chance being considered for adoption.

I am pleased that I made a concious decision not to have children when I was
eight. It meant that I surrendered my innards without a second thought. I am
quietly hoping that both sets of neighbours have insolvable problems
conceiving because those opposite me and those below me are all of
childbearing age, but are currently childless. We just have one four-year
old child in the top flat, but not in the flat over me. There are six flats
in the building. It will be hell if the three families all have children.
The other three flats are occupied by single females, of which I am one.

When are you coming up for your next disability assessment? I understand
that it is about every 2 years. The disability pension should be coming
through for me in August as Newcastle has said that they are doing the
calculation at the moment. My disability pension will be backdated to the
beginning of October 2005 and valid for a period of three years and assessed
after 2 years, which means that I will only have just over one year of peace
and quiet before they are on my case again. As I understand it disability
per se is an assessment of what you can do compared to what the average
healthy person can do at your age. I have had 90% disability grading since
2003 and prior to that I would have had 50% (for the ileostomy) if I had
know that I could get it - in Germany. Since Feb. 2005 I have been given
100% disability grading. The thing is that being disabled does not mean that
you cannot work. I worked as a disabled person up until the 12 Feb. 2005
with nobody really noticing at work that I was disabled. I certainly didn't
tell them anything because I would probably have got bullied and had people
try to lever me out like at a previous company when I made the mistake of
telling a single colleague about my illness and ileostomy.

I have a friend who is on disability benefit with depression and slight
damage to his left hand due to blood poisoning - he is left handed. From
what I understand, he had relatively no problems getting disability benefit
and he is physically OK except for the side-effects of his medication - high
blood pressure, tremoring, water retention, memory lapses, etc. He has
received disability benefit for aeons now and has passed each reassessment.
It helps that he is completely out of it due to the meds, and can hardly
speak as a result and tremors like a Parkinson's patient to boot. It always
impresses the doctors when they see anything like that. If they can't see
anything they think that you are not ill.

I wouldn't lose hope with respect to studying. The NACC has a fund for
helping patients and it might stretch to helping people with respect to
studying. It might be worth inquiring about that. However, they might only
fund members of the NACC. I suggest that you also get in touch with a few
disability officers from various establishments and see if there are welfare
funds that might result in support for such as yourself. You might be able
to win a scholarship, who knows. Having said that I am eternally grateful
that I got a full student grant when I was younger. The good old days! The
only course I had to pay for was my MBA, but that was a personal decision
and I had got the capital, in the form of my own house, at the time.

Yes, my aunt who had endometriosis had a hysterectomy. I think she was
in her 30's, although not sure where in her 30's. But I know she had
always wanted children, and she finally met a man, and got married,
and as soon as she was married she had to have a hysterectomy. She
kinda has been loopy ever since really, what that done to. But then
again, she is my dad's sister, and loopiness runs in that family haha!

Oh no, no, no, don't get me wrong, I really don't want to get back to
work yet! I'm definitely not well enough. In fact, when I was working,
I felt a thousand times better than I do now, and I still always had
to quit my jobs because they'd make me sick. So in no way am I ready
to work again. But what I mean is the minute that your Dr's say you're
not disabled (remember, they think that being disabled and being sick
are two different things) anymore, you lose your disability benefit.
That doesn't mean to say I'd lose my incapacity (sickness) benefit
though. But it was hard enough getting disability benefit (they denied
me, I had to go to appeal) even though I was in a wheelchair at the
time. Even if you can read a recipe, they deny you disability benefit!
It's really silly. But when I was denied, all they could keep saying
to me &quot;we're not denying that you're sick, we're denying that you're
disabled&quot;. As far as I'm concerned, they both go hand in hand. And
there are hundreds of different ways of being disabled. We don't all
have to be a vegetable to be disabled! But I only got it because my GI
wrote a letter about me being in a wheelchair etc. Now days, I
wouldn't get it, because I'm not in the wheelchair and so no one would
write that. And if I lost my disability benefit, I couldn't afford to
live. I get disability and incapacity right now, but that only leaves
me with £10 per month for myself for any extras. So if I lost
disability, then I'd probably be on the streets. Well, if Mum's
marital home wasn't sold. She helps me out as much as she can (because
I can't afford my rent and every bit of my bills - plus she lives with
me full time too now) but she also has to pay half the bills back at
the marital home. We could manage if the marital home sold though and
I lost my disability benefit.

But all I'm trying to say if whether you can work or not means nothing
to whether you're disabled or not. So if I lost my disability now, I'd
have to work even if that killed me. I'd have to become a prostitute
lmao, although that'd be difficult too now because of the endo lmao!
Oh god, isn't life fun?

As for the studying....I couldn't afford to study. I've been
desperately wanting to do a distance herbal medicine diploma, but I
can't afford it. So I'm teaching herbal medicine to myself, from
books. Then on the community I can have my own little herb patch and
learn through the practical side too. But yes, I'd love to study, but
it's so expensive to study here now. Most uni students now come out in
£20,000 worth of debt, if they're not lucky enough to have their
parents support. I wouldn't have any support. Even a lesser course
(like the herbal medicine is £450) is still money I can't afford. I'd
love to learn little things here and there, like wicker basket making
etc. But so expensive! The last course I did was a 10 week counselling
skills course, run by my Mum's ex colleague. Mum also taught there,
but I couldn't have my Mum teach me, so I went for her colleagues
class.

And yes, I do sort of remember that woman who came here with the endo/
rectal issue. I can't remember her name either. Didn't it also cause a
kink in her sigmoid colon? Crohn's and women's problems have so much
to answer for, and they're so ignored it's terrible!

Thanks for the advice on my hand. I think it's the tendon. I'll just
leave it then and hopefully after a long wait it'll get better. My
best friend (the martial artist) said it'll hurt for a long time too
lol! And I don't think I'd be satisfied with punching the bed or
pillow, I need something hard. I would have taken it out on my punch
bag but I had locked myself in my bedroom haha!

&gt; A caveat about your new doctor: I have good doctors, but they also get my
&gt; back up occassionally. After all we are all human and we all make
&gt; mistakes.
&gt; So don't be surprised if the new doctor also pisses you off occasionally
&gt; despite all his good qualities ;-)

&gt; From what I have read about endometriosis most severe cases end up in
&gt; hysterectomy and oophrectomy even very young patients. I hadn't heard
&gt; about
&gt; medical menopause as an option until you mentioned it, probably because it
&gt; was not an option in my case. I have read up on this subject because there
&gt; was suspicion of endometriosis in my case and I did have a small
&gt; grapefruit-sized endometrial cyst that they removed along with polyps and
&gt; a
&gt; fluid fibroid when I was surgically castrated at the age of 42. Every item
&gt; removed was also coated with adhesions and the womb had to be removed in
&gt; two
&gt; parts because it was so heavily embedded in adhesions, which [probably]
&gt; meant that I would never have been able to carry a child to term anyway.
&gt; However, the endometrial tissue had not leaked out into the body cavity.
&gt; Do
&gt; you remember last year we had a visitor here who had anal bleeding and was
&gt; then found to have a fistula between the womb and the rectum with
&gt; endometriosis in the rectum? I have forgotten her name, but I believe that
&gt; it began with a G.

&gt; With the right hormonal treatment, I bet that your artificial menopause
&gt; will
&gt; be an absolute walk over compared to everything else that you have gone
&gt; through. Let's face it you are a veteran of this lark.

&gt; Whatever happens, based on my experience, I do not recommend that anyone
&gt; has
&gt; surgery until it is the only option left. Each surgery that I have had has
&gt; been a great short-term solution, but has always led to long-term
&gt; problems,
&gt; even if it is only (!) adhesions.  I have 9 surgeries behind me - well
&gt; some
&gt; of them involved my behind ;-)

&gt; With heightened quality of life I don't mean that you will necessarily be
&gt; able to come off the disability benefits. Let us not run before we can
&gt; walk.
&gt; I would relax and see how it goes. Only when you can really get through

Just got my prescription yesterday. It is Questran that I'll be
taking. Have just taken my first dose. Half a sachet mixed with water
before eating my breakfast, and the other half after my breakfast. So
I have just had it. It's annoying though because as soon as I wake up,
I have to take my Pariet (proton pump inhibitor) then wait and hour
before I can take my other morning meds (6mp &amp; Mebevarine) and then
now I have to wait another hour before my Questran and breakfast.
Isn't it all such a palaver! I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I
don't get so constipated that I get a blockage! That always scares me
with things like this. I needed to take it though because Monday I was
back to the yellow diarrhea again. Yesterday was about 7 times. I know
that doesn't sound much actually, but it's a lot to my anus squirting
out pure bile lol!

My disability is up in 3 years, so that's ok. The first time I was
awarded it was for 2 years, this time it was for 5 years. Sometimes
you get awarded it for life. Although I'm thinking they won't give me
a life award because I'm only 23. It's a lot of stress though when you
need to re-apply and fight. Stress that we could do without.

Yes, I think you can work still on disability benefit, but not on
incapacity benefit. If I worked (which I couldn't do anyway) then I'd
lose my incapacity benefit. Again, I can't live without one or the
other. Disability on it's own is not enough to live on, neither is
incapacity benefit on it's own. Even still, with them both, it's
impossible to live. And with it all, it's a choice between losing half
of your disability benefit (the mobility section) for a motability
car, or not getting a motability car and having that mobility benefit
coming in. But I need a car, otherwise I wouldn't be able to get
around. I can't get to and wait at bus stops or train stations etc. I
don't know how you do it! I remember before I had a car, I often had
to stand waiting for 2 hours in the snow for a bus. Just can't do that
anymore. The bus services aren't reliable enough here. Plus I don't
relish sitting on a bus being coughed and sneezed on, as it seems that
most people in the UK have totally lost all manners and basic hygiene
skills. Even yesterday in the shop, Mum bought something and the lady
got her change out of the till but then decided to sneeze into her
hand with the change, and give the change to Mum. Lovely! But I get
sneezed and coughed on even if I go to the supermarket. Everyone's
walking around in their own worlds, only thinking about themselves.

I'll look into that NACC grant. Thanks for letting me know. I am a
member with the NACC, needed my get to the toilet quick card haha! So,
shall look into that. I'd love to study something, but I wonder if the
grant goes for home courses.

Yes, it is annoying juggling one's life around medication. I hope that the
Questran helps you. It should but perhaps you also need something else like
Loperamide (aka Imodium) or Lomotil or Tincture of Opium to help when the
diarrhoea gets too bad. However, I agree that blockages can easily occur and
I would wait and see what a few days on Questran does - keep the fluid
intake nice and high - around 2 litres per day.

I have just received the notification of disability benefit and the good
news is that it is for a period of 3 years. The bad news is that they have
backdated it to 1st Sept. 2005. So I will have to reapply, unless some sort
of miracle occurs in the intervening time, at the beginning of next year
because it expires on the 30th June 2008. They advise reapplying at least 4
months prior to the expiration date. This whole illness is a massive work
creation project for me. I am not fated to have any rest. I hope that the
application for another 3-week stay in a clinic is approved this year. If it
isn't then I will apply for the beginning of next year to coincide with
needing to reapply for disability.

With respect to using public transport, don't forget that I am in a big
German city and the transport infrastructure in Germany is excellent - aided
by the fact that someone destroyed the entire thing in the first third of
the last century. So everything here is relatively new compared to UK public
(or private) transport. I also pay for an annual ticket, which is at a much
reduced price and gets me around town. If I do have problems when I am
travelling in the city I can always get a taxi home - something which my
Scottish ancestry makes difficult. However, it is always an option. If you
are living in the sticks where the transport is really bad and the distances
long, you just don't have the same options open to you. At the same time I
cannot drive in my current state because I am too tired and unfocused and
would as sure as eggs are eggs cause an accident. In 1992 when I had a
massive flare I would just sit down where I was - in shops outside, etc.
There have been times when I have done that here, but now I don't tend to go
out if I am feeling that bad. I certainly would not go out if I knew that I
might have to wait 2 hours at a busstop. That would certainly be the end of
me.

I have just had a really really bad couple of weeks and I am sure that it
was because I was fighting some infection or another. I am afraid that I
forget about the 6-MP most of the time. I am careful about washing my hands
after I come back in from a trip out, but it does state in the literature
that some patients should wear a mask - I am assuming that this means cancer
patients who are on a higher dose than us. I try and sit as far away from
people as possible and keep away from children when I am out and about. I
was in the underground one day and this lady was almost leaning on me she
was so close. I didn't actually understand because we were virtually the
only people there at the time, anyway I feigned a nasty coughing fit and she
moved away quite quickley. It was a very effective strategy.

I have had a fairly OK day today relatively speaking and actually managed to
get out to the shops around the corner with my granny trolley and bought
some disinfectant spray and some dead sea salts and did some food shopping,
without keeling over. I made a banana cake the weekend before last and am
gearing up to doing the same this week except I want to try an apricot
upside down cake and then a carrot cake. The banana cake was absolutely
delicious straight out of the oven. I try and reduce the sugar in it to be
Crohn's friendly.

I know that the NACC has a welfare grant system, I am only assuming that
they have some provision for supporting students. Anyway, I will keep my
fingers crossed for you perhaps you can have a chat to someone there about
the possibilities.

is now available under the name colestipol.  it works pretty well at
absorbing the bilesalts.  i usually take around 6 a day along with imodium.
it doesn't shut the big d completely down, but makes it so that i can go

Just got my prescription yesterday. It is Questran that I'll be
taking. Have just taken my first dose. Half a sachet mixed with water
before eating my breakfast, and the other half after my breakfast. So
I have just had it. It's annoying though because as soon as I wake up,
I have to take my Pariet (proton pump inhibitor) then wait and hour
before I can take my other morning meds (6mp &amp; Mebevarine) and then
now I have to wait another hour before my Questran and breakfast.
Isn't it all such a palaver! I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I
don't get so constipated that I get a blockage! That always scares me
with things like this. I needed to take it though because Monday I was
back to the yellow diarrhea again. Yesterday was about 7 times. I know
that doesn't sound much actually, but it's a lot to my anus squirting
out pure bile lol!

My disability is up in 3 years, so that's ok. The first time I was
awarded it was for 2 years, this time it was for 5 years. Sometimes
you get awarded it for life. Although I'm thinking they won't give me
a life award because I'm only 23. It's a lot of stress though when you
need to re-apply and fight. Stress that we could do without.

Yes, I think you can work still on disability benefit, but not on
incapacity benefit. If I worked (which I couldn't do anyway) then I'd
lose my incapacity benefit. Again, I can't live without one or the
other. Disability on it's own is not enough to live on, neither is
incapacity benefit on it's own. Even still, with them both, it's
impossible to live. And with it all, it's a choice between losing half

&gt; Yes, my aunt who had endometriosis had a hysterectomy. I think she was
&gt; in her 30's, although not sure where in her 30's. But I know she had
&gt; always wanted children, and she finally met a man, and got married,
&gt; and as soon as she was married she had to have a hysterectomy. She
&gt; kinda has been loopy ever since really, what that done to. But then
&gt; again, she is my dad's sister, and loopiness runs in that family haha!

&gt; Oh no, no, no, don't get me wrong, I really don't want to get back to
&gt; work yet! I'm definitely not well enough. In fact, when I was working,
&gt; I felt a thousand times better than I do now, and I still always had
&gt; to quit my jobs because they'd make me sick. So in no way am I ready
&gt; to work again. But what I mean is the minute that your Dr's say you're
&gt; not disabled (remember, they think that being disabled and being sick
&gt; are two different things) anymore, you lose your disability benefit.
&gt; That doesn't mean to say I'd lose my incapacity (sickness) benefit
&gt; though. But it was hard enough getting disability benefit (they denied
&gt; me, I had to go to appeal) even though I was in a wheelchair at the
&gt; time. Even if you can read a recipe, they deny you disability benefit!
&gt; It's really silly. But when I was denied, all they could keep saying
&gt; to me &quot;we're not denying that you're sick, we're denying that you're
&gt; disabled&quot;. As far as I'm concerned, they both go hand in hand. And
&gt; there are hundreds of different ways of being disabled. We don't all
&gt; have to be a vegetable to be disabled! But I only got it because my GI
&gt; wrote a letter about me being in a wheelchair etc. Now days, I
&gt; wouldn't get it, because I'm not in the wheelchair and so no one would
&gt; write that. And if I lost my disability benefit, I couldn't afford to
&gt; live. I get disability and incapacity right now, but that only leaves
&gt; me with £10 per month for myself for any extras. So if I lost
&gt; disability, then I'd probably be on the streets. Well, if Mum's
&gt; marital home wasn't sold. She helps me out as much as she can (because
&gt; I can't afford my rent and every bit of my bills - plus she lives with
&gt; me full time too now) but she also has to pay half the bills back at
&gt; the marital home. We could manage if the marital home sold though and
&gt; I lost my disability benefit.

&gt; But all I'm trying to say if whether you can work or not means nothing
&gt; to whether you're disabled or not. So if I lost my disability now, I'd
&gt; have to work even if that killed me. I'd have to become a prostitute
&gt; lmao, although that'd be difficult too now because of the endo lmao!
&gt; Oh god, isn't life fun?

&gt; As for the studying....I couldn't afford to study. I've been
&gt; desperately wanting to do a distance herbal medicine diploma, but I
&gt; can't afford it. So I'm teaching herbal medicine to myself, from
&gt; books. Then on the community I can have my own little herb patch and

Here is the relevant page you require from the NACC. Unfortunately, the
highest grant would appear to be 900 UKS in a five year period and not more
than 300 UKS in any given year, but they might be able to give you some
information as to how you could study. You need to hurry up because the
vocational grant is only for those up to 25 years old.

&gt; Yes, it is annoying juggling one's life around medication. I hope that the
&gt; Questran helps you. It should but perhaps you also need something else
&gt; like Loperamide (aka Imodium) or Lomotil or Tincture of Opium to help when
&gt; the diarrhoea gets too bad. However, I agree that blockages can easily
&gt; occur and I would wait and see what a few days on Questran does - keep the
&gt; fluid intake nice and high - around 2 litres per day.

&gt; I have just received the notification of disability benefit and the good
&gt; news is that it is for a period of 3 years. The bad news is that they have
&gt; backdated it to 1st Sept. 2005. So I will have to reapply, unless some
&gt; sort of miracle occurs in the intervening time, at the beginning of next
&gt; year because it expires on the 30th June 2008. They advise reapplying at
&gt; least 4 months prior to the expiration date. This whole illness is a
&gt; massive work creation project for me. I am not fated to have any rest. I
&gt; hope that the application for another 3-week stay in a clinic is approved
&gt; this year. If it isn't then I will apply for the beginning of next year to
&gt; coincide with needing to reapply for disability.

&gt; With respect to using public transport, don't forget that I am in a big
&gt; German city and the transport infrastructure in Germany is excellent -
&gt; aided by the fact that someone destroyed the entire thing in the first
&gt; third of the last century. So everything here is relatively new compared
&gt; to UK public (or private) transport. I also pay for an annual ticket,
&gt; which is at a much reduced price and gets me around town. If I do have
&gt; problems when I am travelling in the city I can always get a taxi home -
&gt; something which my Scottish ancestry makes difficult. However, it is
&gt; always an option. If you are living in the sticks where the transport is
&gt; really bad and the distances long, you just don't have the same options
&gt; open to you. At the same time I cannot drive in my current state because I
&gt; am too tired and unfocused and would as sure as eggs are eggs cause an
&gt; accident. In 1992 when I had a massive flare I would just sit down where I
&gt; was - in shops outside, etc. There have been times when I have done that
&gt; here, but now I don't tend to go out if I am feeling that bad. I certainly
&gt; would not go out if I knew that I might have to wait 2 hours at a busstop.
&gt; That would certainly be the end of me.

&gt; I have just had a really really bad couple of weeks and I am sure that it
&gt; was because I was fighting some infection or another. I am afraid that I
&gt; forget about the 6-MP most of the time. I am careful about washing my
&gt; hands after I come back in from a trip out, but it does state in the
&gt; literature that some patients should wear a mask - I am assuming that this
&gt; means cancer patients who are on a higher dose than us. I try and sit as
&gt; far away from people as possible and keep away from children when I am out
&gt; and about. I was in the underground one day and this lady was almost
&gt; leaning on me she was so close. I didn't actually understand because we
&gt; were virtually the only people there at the time, anyway I feigned a nasty
&gt; coughing fit and she moved away quite quickley. It was a very effective
&gt; strategy.

&gt; I have had a fairly OK day today relatively speaking and actually managed
&gt; to get out to the shops around the corner with my granny trolley and
&gt; bought some disinfectant spray and some dead sea salts and did some food
&gt; shopping, without keeling over. I made a banana cake the weekend before
&gt; last and am gearing up to doing the same this week except I want to try an
&gt; apricot upside down cake and then a carrot cake. The banana cake was
&gt; absolutely delicious straight out of the oven. I try and reduce the sugar
&gt; in it to be Crohn's friendly.

&gt; I know that the NACC has a welfare grant system, I am only assuming that
&gt; they have some provision for supporting students. Anyway, I will keep my
&gt; fingers crossed for you perhaps you can have a chat to someone there about
&gt; the possibilities.

Training

There are an increasing number of training schemes being set up, including
those available

through the New Deal for the Disabled. They vary hugely in quality, so you
need to do some

research first. If possible, try to find schemes that have some external
qualification, such as

an NVQ, attached to them rather than schemes that just have an in-house
certificate at the

end. Some schemes allow you to carry on receiving all your benefits whilst
you train, others

pay you a training allowance instead of some of your benefits, but allow you
to go back onto

your old benefits when the training finishes. Try to get advice from a
Disability Employment

Adviser about which training might suit you best.

&gt;&gt; Yes, it is annoying juggling one's life around medication. I hope that
&gt;&gt; the Questran helps you. It should but perhaps you also need something
&gt;&gt; else like Loperamide (aka Imodium) or Lomotil or Tincture of Opium to
&gt;&gt; help when the diarrhoea gets too bad. However, I agree that blockages can
&gt;&gt; easily occur and I would wait and see what a few days on Questran does -
&gt;&gt; keep the fluid intake nice and high - around 2 litres per day.

&gt;&gt; I have just received the notification of disability benefit and the good
&gt;&gt; news is that it is for a period of 3 years. The bad news is that they
&gt;&gt; have backdated it to 1st Sept. 2005. So I will have to reapply, unless
&gt;&gt; some sort of miracle occurs in the intervening time, at the beginning of
&gt;&gt; next year because it expires on the 30th June 2008. They advise
&gt;&gt; reapplying at least 4 months prior to the expiration date. This whole
&gt;&gt; illness is a massive work creation project for me. I am not fated to have
&gt;&gt; any rest. I hope that the application for another 3-week stay in a clinic
&gt;&gt; is approved this year. If it isn't then I will apply for the beginning of
&gt;&gt; next year to coincide with needing to reapply for disability.

&gt;&gt; With respect to using public transport, don't forget that I am in a big
&gt;&gt; German city and the transport infrastructure in Germany is excellent -
&gt;&gt; aided by the fact that someone destroyed the entire thing in the first
&gt;&gt; third of the last century. So everything here is relatively new compared
&gt;&gt; to UK public (or private) transport. I also pay for an annual ticket,
&gt;&gt; which is at a much reduced price and gets me around town. If I do have
&gt;&gt; problems when I am travelling in the city I can always get a taxi home -
&gt;&gt; something which my Scottish ancestry makes difficult. However, it is
&gt;&gt; always an option. If you are living in the sticks where the transport is
&gt;&gt; really bad and the distances long, you just don't have the same options
&gt;&gt; open to you. At the same time I cannot drive in my current state because
&gt;&gt; I am too tired and unfocused and would as sure as eggs are eggs cause an
&gt;&gt; accident. In 1992 when I had a massive flare I would just sit down where
&gt;&gt; I was - in shops outside, etc. There have been times when I have done
&gt;&gt; that here, but now I don't tend to go out if I am feeling that bad. I
&gt;&gt; certainly would not go out if I knew that I might have to wait 2 hours at
&gt;&gt; a busstop. That would certainly be the end of me.

&gt;&gt; I have just had a really really bad couple of weeks and I am sure that it
&gt;&gt; was because I was fighting some infection or another. I am afraid that I
&gt;&gt; forget about the 6-MP most of the time. I am careful about washing my
&gt;&gt; hands after I come back in from a trip out, but it does state in the
&gt;&gt; literature that some patients should wear a mask - I am assuming that
&gt;&gt; this means cancer patients who are on a higher dose than us. I try and
&gt;&gt; sit as far away from people as possible and keep away from children when
&gt;&gt; I am out and about. I was in the underground one day and this lady was
&gt;&gt; almost leaning on me she was so close. I didn't actually understand
&gt;&gt; because we were virtually the only people there at the time, anyway I
&gt;&gt; feigned a nasty coughing fit and she moved away quite quickley. It was a
&gt;&gt; very effective strategy.

&gt;&gt; I have had a fairly OK day today relatively speaking and actually managed
&gt;&gt; to get out to the shops around the corner with my granny trolley and
&gt;&gt; bought some disinfectant spray and some dead sea salts and did some food
&gt;&gt; shopping, without keeling over. I made a banana cake the weekend before
&gt;&gt; last and am gearing up to doing the same this week except I want to try
&gt;&gt; an apricot upside down cake and then a carrot cake. The banana cake was
&gt;&gt; absolutely delicious straight out of the oven. I try and reduce the sugar
&gt;&gt; in it to be Crohn's friendly.

&gt;&gt; I know that the NACC has a welfare grant system, I am only assuming that
&gt;&gt; they have some provision for supporting students. Anyway, I will keep my

&gt;&gt; Just got my prescription yesterday. It is Questran that I'll be
&gt;&gt; taking. Have just taken my first dose. Half a sachet mixed with water
&gt;&gt; before eating my breakfast, and the other half after my breakfast. So
&gt;&gt; I have just had it. It's annoying though because as soon as I wake up,
&gt;&gt; I have to take my Pariet (proton pump inhibitor) then wait and hour
&gt;&gt; before I can take my other morning meds (6mp &amp; Mebevarine) and then
&gt;&gt; now I have to wait another hour before my Questran and breakfast.
&gt;&gt; Isn't it all such a palaver! I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I
&gt;&gt; don't get so constipated that I get a blockage! That always scares me
&gt;&gt; with things like this. I needed to take it though because Monday I was
&gt;&gt; back to the yellow diarrhea again. Yesterday was about 7 times. I know
&gt;&gt; that doesn't sound much actually, but it's a lot to my anus squirting
&gt;&gt; out pure bile lol!

&gt;&gt; My disability is up in 3 years, so that's ok. The first time I was
&gt;&gt; awarded it was for 2 years, this time it was for 5 years. Sometimes
&gt;&gt; you get awarded it for life. Although I'm thinking they won't give me
&gt;&gt; a life award because I'm only 23. It's a lot of stress though when you
&gt;&gt; need to re-apply and fight. Stress that we could do without.

&gt;&gt; Yes, I think you can work still on disability benefit, but not on
&gt;&gt; incapacity benefit. If I worked (which I couldn't do anyway) then I'd
&gt;&gt; lose my incapacity benefit. Again, I can't live without one or the
&gt;&gt; other. Disability on it's own is not enough to live on, neither is
&gt;&gt; incapacity benefit on it's own. Even still, with them both, it's
&gt;&gt; impossible to live. And with it all, it's a choice between losing half
&gt;&gt; of your disability benefit (the mobility section) for a motability
&gt;&gt; car, or not getting a motability car and having that mobility benefit
&gt;&gt; coming in. But I need a car, otherwise I wouldn't be able to get
&gt;&gt; around. I can't get to and wait at bus stops or train stations etc. I
&gt;&gt; don't know how you do it! I remember before I had a car, I often had
&gt;&gt; to stand waiting for 2 hours in the snow for a bus. Just can't do that
&gt;&gt; anymore. The bus services aren't reliable enough here. Plus I don't
&gt;&gt; relish sitting on a bus being coughed and sneezed on, as it seems that
&gt;&gt; most people in the UK have totally lost all manners and basic hygiene
&gt;&gt; skills. Even yesterday in the shop, Mum bought something and the lady
&gt;&gt; got her change out of the till but then decided to sneeze into her
&gt;&gt; hand with the change, and give the change to Mum. Lovely! But I get
&gt;&gt; sneezed and coughed on even if I go to the supermarket. Everyone's
&gt;&gt; walking around in their own worlds, only thinking about themselves.

&gt;&gt; I'll look into that NACC grant. Thanks for letting me know. I am a
&gt;&gt; member with the NACC, needed my get to the toilet quick card haha! So,
&gt;&gt; shall look into that. I'd love to study something, but I wonder if the
&gt;&gt; grant goes for home courses.

&gt;&gt;&gt; When are you coming up for your next disability assessment? I understand

I took the Questran that one day and stopped it the next day! That
evening my colon was spasming, painful and really windy! And I felt so
ill and nauseas! So I stopped the Questran and felt fine. How odd is
that? Another medication intolerance. I have tried to tell Dr's in the
past that anything that causes constipation does this to me. Imodium
used to put me in incredible pain actually, so painful that I couldn't
move. So I never took that one again. Painkillers that constipate
(really any of them apart from paracetamol) does this to me too so I
can never take pain killers. It's terrible, I don't know why I have
this reaction to these kind of things. I think the Questran would be
really good for me if it didn't do this! I'll have to talk to the Dr
about it, but I know they'll just roll their eyes at me again.

I'm sorry to hear about your disability benefit. I can't believe they
backdated it 2 years! How unfair! I'm sure they do these things on
purpose, hoping that most people can't be bothered to reapply so soon.
Just keep fighting. I know it's horrible, it's always a fight for
people like us, all day every day!

Yes, I suppose I would get around better if I lived in town or in a
city, regarding public transport. I do get worried about germs though.
I don't stop catching things. That's funny about the lady near enough
leaning on you waiting for the train! People do things like that to
me, I think I have a sign on my head saying &quot;please everyone, come
share your germs with me&quot;. Everywhere I go now people are coughing,
sneezing, and it's always as I walk past them. There's something wrong
in Britain at the moment though, I don't know what is going on but I
remember a time (look, old age is setting in already with me!) when
people would catch the common cold and flu's in the winter, and summer
was ok. Like seasonal viruses. Lately there's new bugs and viruses
constantly. Maybe it's to do with the weather being so unpredictable.
We need the cold to get some fresh air here, but it's always muggy
now, even when it's raining (constantly). I haven't been able to wear
a jumper in years, it's ridiculous! But it's strange though....June
was a heatwave, we thought because of that we were in for a sizzler of
a summer. Now in July it's constant rain, dark, windy, thunderstorms
and I guess you've heard on the news of our flooding. Summer has
disappeared. We don't have seasons anymore at all. And I think that's
part of the problem why there's so many bugs rotating and mutating
here.

But something is wrong with the general public too. They almost act
like they're in a zombi-fied state. Honest, I am not exaggerating
here. And things like general manners have gone, because they're in
this state. It's not even a generation thing, because the elderly,
middle aged, youth and children all are like this. I'm pretty sure
there's poisoning in our food now jellyfying our brains. Strange....I
liked the film 28 Days Later, it reminded me of now days civilization
lmao!

But yes, I always remember I'm on 6mp because the amount of bugs and
viruses I keep catching. I'm surprised I'm still alive actually, it's
one after the other. I am very good with my general hygiene too, and
always remember to wash my hands when I've been out. And I carry
around an anti-bacterial hand gel wash too. I was really frightened
not so long ago (which proves the flu jab worked) because my best
friend came down with flu, which turned into pneumonia. But I saw her
the day before she got laid up in bed with the flu. A week later I
came down with a relatively mild cold, and that's it. She was in
terrible trouble though. She's not really over it fully yet either,
but on Tuesday starts touring with the Commitments for 6 weeks as a
backing singer.

I've always caught bugs and viruses really easily though, even before
I touched medication. But my immune system worked overtime with wounds
and anti bodies. Strange. My Mum on the other hand has always had a
great immune system, before 6mp she never caught anything really. I
would have flu and colds and all sorts, and she'd be looking after me
(even with gastric flu's she'd take the sick bowl away and empty it
etc). And all those times as a kid when I was sick and I'd go sleep
next to her in bed, or she'd put up a camp bed in her bedroom. My dad
too really, he never caught anything. I've never known my dad to be
ill up until now days. Even my brother. No one caught things off me in
the household. But now Mum's on 6mp she's just as bad as me lol!

I'm not feeling too bad at all today. Me and Mum were naughty
yesterday and decided to get and Indian takeaway. I always get a
chicken korma, and usually it's nice and smooth and creamy, but we
went to a different place yesterday and it had tons of coconut fiber
in it! So did Mum's, she got a passanda which isn't even meant to have
coconut in it. Anyway, we just took the risk because we felt like
being naughty, and I feel fine. That's not to say it hasn't reached my
ileum or colon yet though hahaha! So, when Mum gets home from work we
might go out to Bury town center and have a look around. A few of my
favourite places (Next clothing shop and Game computer game shop) have
the sales on at the moment.

I hope you have a good day.

Thanks for that. Yes, I have read this page before in the past. What
took my eye previously, and did again, is the new clothing one.
Because my weight is so up and down because of the steroids, I can't
keep affording the new size clothes. At the moment I hardly have any
clothes, and even worse is that I have a terrible sweating problem now
(since the last course of steroids) that I soak all my clothes through
in one wearing. So I can't keep up!

I will get in touch however to ask about an at home study course. I
don't know if they'd consider that though as &quot;a need arising from your
IBD&quot;. It's not really a need, it's more a want lol!

&gt; &gt; awarded it was for 2 years, this time it was for 5 years. Sometimes
&gt; &gt; you get awarded it for life. Although I'm thinking they won't give me
&gt; &gt; a life award because I'm only 23. It's a lot of stress though when you
&gt; &gt; need to re-apply and fight. Stress that we could do without.

&gt; &gt; Yes, I think you can work still on disability benefit, but not on
&gt; &gt; incapacity benefit. If I worked (which I couldn't do anyway) then I'd
&gt; &gt; lose my incapacity benefit. Again, I can't live without one or the
&gt; &gt; other. Disability on it's own is not enough to live on, neither is
&gt; &gt; incapacity benefit on it's own. Even still, with them both, it's
&gt; &gt; impossible to live. And with it all, it's a choice between losing half
&gt; &gt; of your disability benefit (the mobility section) for a motability
&gt; &gt; car, or not getting a motability car and having that mobility benefit
&gt; &gt; coming in. But I need a car, otherwise I wouldn't be able to get
&gt; &gt; around. I can't get to and wait at bus stops or train stations etc. I
&gt; &gt; don't know how you do it! I remember before I had a car, I often had
&gt; &gt; to stand waiting for 2 hours in the snow for a bus. Just can't do that
&gt; &gt; anymore. The bus services aren't reliable enough here. Plus I don't
&gt; &gt; relish sitting on a bus being coughed and sneezed on, as it seems that
&gt; &gt; most people in the UK have totally lost all manners and basic hygiene
&gt; &gt; skills. Even yesterday in the shop, Mum bought something and the lady
&gt; &gt; got her change out of the till but then decided to sneeze into her
&gt; &gt; hand with the change, and give the change to Mum. Lovely! But I get
&gt; &gt; sneezed and coughed on even if I go to the supermarket. Everyone's
&gt; &gt; walking around in their own worlds, only thinking about themselves.

&gt; &gt; I'll look into that NACC grant. Thanks for letting me know. I am a
&gt; &gt; member with the NACC, needed my get to the toilet quick card haha! So,
&gt; &gt; shall look into that. I'd love to study something, but I wonder if the
&gt; &gt; grant goes for home courses.

&gt; &gt;&gt; When are you coming up for your next disability assessment? I understand

&gt; &gt;&gt; beginning of October 2005 and valid for a period of three years and
&gt; &gt;&gt; assessed

Thanks again for this. I'm not sure about it though. I don't want to
start messing with my benefits. Being able to live is more important
than studying for anything. If I was to lose some of my benefit due to
studying, then I really wouldn't be able to live and would be on the
street. I also don't want to start agents snooping around my file, I'd
rather it was just left alone.

&gt; Training

&gt; There are an increasing number of training schemes being set up, including
&gt; those available

&gt; through the New Deal for the Disabled. They vary hugely in quality, so you
&gt; need to do some

&gt; research first. If possible, try to find schemes that have some external
&gt; qualification, such as

&gt; an NVQ, attached to them rather than schemes that just have an in-house
&gt; certificate at the

&gt; end. Some schemes allow you to carry on receiving all your benefits whilst
&gt; you train, others

&gt; pay you a training allowance instead of some of your benefits, but allow you
&gt; to go back onto

&gt; your old benefits when the training finishes. Try to get advice from a
&gt; Disability Employment

&gt; Adviser about which training might suit you best.

&gt; &gt; Here is the relevant page you require from the NACC. Unfortunately, the
&gt; &gt; highest grant would appear to be 900 UKS in a five year period and not
&gt; &gt; more than 300 UKS in any given year, but they might be able to give you
&gt; &gt; some information as to how you could study. You need to hurry up because
&gt; &gt; the vocational grant is only for those up to 25 years old.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, it is annoying juggling one's life around medication. I hope that
&gt; &gt;&gt; the Questran helps you. It should but perhaps you also need something
&gt; &gt;&gt; else like Loperamide (aka Imodium) or Lomotil or Tincture of Opium to
&gt; &gt;&gt; help when the diarrhoea gets too bad. However, I agree that blockages can
&gt; &gt;&gt; easily occur and I would wait and see what a few days on Questran does -
&gt; &gt;&gt; keep the fluid intake nice and high - around 2 litres per day.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have just received the notification of disability benefit and the good
&gt; &gt;&gt; news is that it is for a period of 3 years. The bad news is that they
&gt; &gt;&gt; have backdated it to 1st Sept. 2005. So I will have to reapply, unless
&gt; &gt;&gt; some sort of miracle occurs in the intervening time, at the beginning of
&gt; &gt;&gt; next year because it expires on the 30th June 2008. They advise
&gt; &gt;&gt; reapplying at least 4 months prior to the expiration date. This whole
&gt; &gt;&gt; illness is a massive work creation project for me. I am not fated to have
&gt; &gt;&gt; any rest. I hope that the application for another 3-week stay in a clinic
&gt; &gt;&gt; is approved this year. If it isn't then I will apply for the beginning of
&gt; &gt;&gt; next year to coincide with needing to reapply for disability.

&gt; &gt;&gt; With respect to using public transport, don't forget that I am in a big
&gt; &gt;&gt; German city and the transport infrastructure in Germany is excellent -
&gt; &gt;&gt; aided by the fact that someone destroyed the entire thing in the first
&gt; &gt;&gt; third of the last century. So everything here is relatively new compared
&gt; &gt;&gt; to UK public (or private) transport. I also pay for an annual ticket,
&gt; &gt;&gt; which is at a much reduced price and gets me around town. If I do have
&gt; &gt;&gt; problems when I am travelling in the city I can always get a taxi home -
&gt; &gt;&gt; something which my Scottish ancestry makes difficult. However, it is
&gt; &gt;&gt; always an option. If you are living in the sticks where the transport is
&gt; &gt;&gt; really bad and the distances long, you just don't have the same options
&gt; &gt;&gt; open to you. At the same time I cannot drive in my current state because
&gt; &gt;&gt; I am too tired and unfocused and would as sure as eggs are eggs cause an
&gt; &gt;&gt; accident. In 1992 when I had a massive flare I would just sit down where
&gt; &gt;&gt; I was - in shops outside, etc. There have been times when I have done
&gt; &gt;&gt; that here, but now I don't tend to go out if I am feeling that bad. I
&gt; &gt;&gt; certainly would not go out if I knew that I might have to wait 2 hours at
&gt; &gt;&gt; a busstop. That would certainly be the end of me.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have just had a really really bad couple of weeks and I am sure that it
&gt; &gt;&gt; was because I was fighting some infection or another. I am afraid that I
&gt; &gt;&gt; forget about the 6-MP most of the time. I am careful about washing my
&gt; &gt;&gt; hands after I come back in from a trip out, but it does state in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; literature that some patients should wear a mask - I am assuming that
&gt; &gt;&gt; this means cancer patients who are on a higher dose than us. I try and
&gt; &gt;&gt; sit as far away from people as possible and keep away from children when
&gt; &gt;&gt; I am out and about. I was in the underground one day and this lady was
&gt; &gt;&gt; almost leaning on me she was so close. I didn't actually understand
&gt; &gt;&gt; because we were virtually the only people there at the time, anyway I
&gt; &gt;&gt; feigned a nasty coughing fit and she moved away quite quickley. It was a
&gt; &gt;&gt; very effective strategy.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have had a fairly OK day today relatively speaking and actually managed
&gt; &gt;&gt; to get out to the shops around the corner with my granny trolley and
&gt; &gt;&gt; bought some disinfectant spray and some dead sea salts and did some food
&gt; &gt;&gt; shopping, without keeling over. I made a banana cake the weekend before
&gt; &gt;&gt; last and am gearing up to doing the same this week except I want to try
&gt; &gt;&gt; an apricot upside down cake and then a carrot cake. The banana cake was
&gt; &gt;&gt; absolutely delicious straight out of the oven. I try and reduce the sugar
&gt; &gt;&gt; in it to be Crohn's friendly.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I know that the NACC has a welfare grant system, I am only assuming that
&gt; &gt;&gt; they have some provision for supporting students. Anyway, I will keep my
&gt; &gt;&gt; fingers crossed for you perhaps you can have a chat to someone there
&gt; &gt;&gt; about the possibilities.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Just got my prescription yesterday. It is Questran that I'll be
&gt; &gt;&gt; taking. Have just taken my first dose. Half a sachet mixed with water
&gt; &gt;&gt; before eating my breakfast, and the other half after my breakfast. So
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have just had it. It's annoying though because as soon as I wake up,
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have to take my Pariet (proton pump inhibitor) then wait and hour
&gt; &gt;&gt; before I can take my other morning meds (6mp &amp; Mebevarine) and then
&gt; &gt;&gt; now I have to wait another hour before my Questran and breakfast.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Isn't it all such a palaver! I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I
&gt; &gt;&gt; don't get so constipated that I get a blockage! That always scares me
&gt; &gt;&gt; with things like this. I needed to take it though because Monday I was
&gt; &gt;&gt; back to the yellow diarrhea again. Yesterday was about 7 times. I know
&gt; &gt;&gt; that doesn't sound much actually, but it's a lot to my anus squirting

I can well understand that you don't want to alter the status quo at the
moment. Just having to deal with these people makes me sicker. Well, you
know that it is there when you need it in the future should your health
stabilise. I did ask my contact person at the unemployment office who is
responsible for disabled people about funding for me, but the response was
that as I was sick, I was not available to them for work and thus they could
not help me by providing financial support for distance learning, etc. I
told him that I was not thinking about doing anything at the moment, but was
planning ahead should my condition stabilise enough to allow me to study a
couple of hours a week. I also saw the clothing thing - I have size 6, 8 and
10 clothes, but need to think about size 12 trousers because they must not
be too tight due to the ileostomy. Now that I wear the maxi bag, which
reaches down to mid-thigh I should change my wardrobe to long shirts over
trousers. I have a couple of maternity shirts, which do the trick, but I
cannot iron without feeling as though I am going to keel over, so I haven't
worn them this year. I can't go back to wearing the smaller bags because I
would be forever running to the loo and it is bad enough already. My hands
are wizened from washing them so much.

Wow, you are living dangerously - a korma, what I wouldn't give to be able
to eat a curry. My GERD will not allow it, although it has not been that bad
over the last couple of days. However, I don't think that I will try pushing
that particular envelope.

I am having a particularly bad day today. I was so thirsty yesterday and
went to bed dehydrated despite having drunk over 3 litres including my ORS
(oral rehydrate solution) and weighing a grand 56.5 kg yesterday evening. It
is now nearly 14:00 and I have drunk nearly 2 litres. I don't know what is
happening because although it is hot outside, it is lovely and cool inside
and I am wearing shorts and a light shirt - my working shirt. Not that I
have done any work recently, but I was hoping to repot some seedlings today.
It looks as though I will have to postpone that until tomorrow.  Today, I
just don't seem to be able to reach my metabolic equilibrium and have the
associated flu-like symptoms and extreme lassitude. If I don't do any
physical activity I can generally find some sort of metabolic equilibrium in
front of my computer, so long as I just play computer games or watch videos
;-) I also slept really well because the lady who lives above me is
apparently on holiday and I was able to sleep through without being woken up
at 06:30 by her getting up and slamming doors and similar. I have spoken to
her once about it and will do so again and if that does not work then I will
write a letter to the building's administrator. I will also tell her that
when she comes back. There is a definite increase in my quality of life when
I can sleep through to 08:00 or so, given that I have to get up at least
once in the night anyway and do not obtain a full 6-8 hours on the stretch
sleep like most other mortals. The law is also on my side because no
disturbance is allowed between 23:00 and 07:00 at night.

With respect to infections, I am amazed at how I have managed to avoid
really major infections over the past couple of years, although I have had
all the required jabs and live in happy isolation. I have been bitten a
couple of times recently by mosquitos or something because I have not got
around to putting up the window fly netting, yet. I will have to wait for a
better day. Anyway, I am so immunosupressed that I am not reacting to the
bites, so no itching, which is great - no bites would be better though for
aesthetic reasons.

I am thinking of baking a banana cake or making some drop scones now. I
haven't made up my mind yet and, indeed, it could well remain just a thought
today. However, I am hungry so I have to do something without delay.

Have a good day for me.

&gt; &gt;&gt; because we were virtually the only people there at the time, anyway I
&gt; &gt;&gt; feigned a nasty coughing fit and she moved away quite quickley. It was
&gt; &gt;&gt; a
&gt; &gt;&gt; very effective strategy.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have had a fairly OK day today relatively speaking and actually
&gt; &gt;&gt; managed
&gt; &gt;&gt; to get out to the shops around the corner with my granny trolley and
&gt; &gt;&gt; bought some disinfectant spray and some dead sea salts and did some
&gt; &gt;&gt; food
&gt; &gt;&gt; shopping, without keeling over. I made a banana cake the weekend before

Lol, my Grandad was getting really cranky at me yesterday because I
mentioned that before I got sick I had a business plan to get a van
and do removals and odd-jobs for the lesbian/women's community. A lot
of these women don't want men in their house so would feel much more
comfortable employing a woman to do this stuff. Anyway, so I said that
I couldn't do it because I got too sick, and I'd also get in trouble
working whilst being on benefits. Anyway, he nearly had a heart attack
he got so angry at me for being so scared of the system. Lmao, btw, my
Grandad is nuts so I just let him babble on at me. He never
understands anything.

So yeah, no altering the status quo just yet! But the above business
idea would be one I'd pursue if by miracle I got better or they found
a cure.

My clothes size alters between size 34&quot; waist (men's clothing for me
remember lol) and size 36&quot; waist. 36&quot; is what steroids do to me, and
34&quot; is when they get out of my system eventually. And I wear medium to
large t-shirts. But when I've been in hospital for the constant
diarrhea and not being able to eat, then all my clothes swamp me. But
that's ok, because they usually put me on steroids in those
circumstances and it's not long before I've puffed up again haha!

I can understand your clothing choices due to your bag. Those are good
ways around it. Mum has to wear similar clothing because of pressure
on her tummy from trousers, and tops needing to flow over her popped
out belly. A lot of people still come up to her and say &quot;when's it
due?&quot; How rude! But she's had to wear elasticated waist trousers for a
long time. I don't have that problem and I'm always in jeans. We have
a different shape belly. Mine's more like a man's where it's high up,
and then stops about 2 1/2 inches above my pubic bone, where it's nice
and flat lol! So I wear my jeans under my belly lmao! Mum's is just a
full over belly.

Me and Mum were absolutely fine from the Indian takeaway the other
night! We were so impressed. It's stupid though how that didn't cause
us any problems, but we can't even taste a few spoonfuls of porridge
without trouble! I would have problems with GERD if it was very spicy,
but korma is so mild it doesn't bother me. Sometimes the cream in it
can give me bad wind though.

I'm sorry to hear you're having a bad day. I hope you feel better
soon. It's strange that you feel so dehydrated under those
circumstances. Shouldn't be so! Let me know how things go.

I know what you mean about noisy neighbours! Before this house I was
in my flat, and it was just a converted house. My flat was upstairs,
and there was a guy living below me. He made so much noise! I started
to think he had a fetish for opening and closing draws as that's what
it sounded like he was doing all the flippin' time. Needles to say I
heard everything as well when his girlfriend popped over haha! Now I
live in a terraced house, and it's better but not perfect. I have an
old lady with a dog to my left, and that dog does not shut up.
Especially at 8am when the postman or people walk past their window.
8am is my middle of the night because I don't tend to fall asleep
until 4am. And I have an old man to my right who has his two sons
living with him. One of them likes to play with his kit car early on
Sundays, and the other one comes in from work at 12.30am and seems to
have a fetish for slamming doors. So, I think neighbours are a pain
wherever you live.

Lol that 6mp works well at allergic reactions doesn't it! You with
your mosquito bites no reacting. I have been off my antihistamine
tablets for ages now and I'm loving it! I can breathe without
medication! A strange thing though concerning mosquito's and other
biting insects.....I never get bitten! Everyone around me gets bitten,
but most of my life I just never get bitten. Even when we went to
Turkey, everyone was walking around with mosquito bites, but I was
free of any. I don't get it. I wonder if there's something about my
blood (white blood cells?) that they don't like.....strange....

Right, I must clean the oven from our delicious roast lamb dinner the
other night!

&gt; I can well understand that you don't want to alter the status quo at the
&gt; moment. Just having to deal with these people makes me sicker. Well, you
&gt; know that it is there when you need it in the future should your health
&gt; stabilise. I did ask my contact person at the unemployment office who is
&gt; responsible for disabled people about funding for me, but the response was
&gt; that as I was sick, I was not available to them for work and thus they could
&gt; not help me by providing financial support for distance learning, etc. I
&gt; told him that I was not thinking about doing anything at the moment, but was
&gt; planning ahead should my condition stabilise enough to allow me to study a
&gt; couple of hours a week. I also saw the clothing thing - I have size 6, 8 and
&gt; 10 clothes, but need to think about size 12 trousers because they must not
&gt; be too tight due to the ileostomy. Now that I wear the maxi bag, which
&gt; reaches down to mid-thigh I should change my wardrobe to long shirts over
&gt; trousers. I have a couple of maternity shirts, which do the trick, but I
&gt; cannot iron without feeling as though I am going to keel over, so I haven't
&gt; worn them this year. I can't go back to wearing the smaller bags because I
&gt; would be forever running to the loo and it is bad enough already. My hands
&gt; are wizened from washing them so much.

&gt; Wow, you are living dangerously - a korma, what I wouldn't give to be able
&gt; to eat a curry. My GERD will not allow it, although it has not been that bad
&gt; over the last couple of days. However, I don't think that I will try pushing
&gt; that particular envelope.

&gt; I am having a particularly bad day today. I was so thirsty yesterday and
&gt; went to bed dehydrated despite having drunk over 3 litres including my ORS
&gt; (oral rehydrate solution) and weighing a grand 56.5 kg yesterday evening. It
&gt; is now nearly 14:00 and I have drunk nearly 2 litres. I don't know what is
&gt; happening because although it is hot outside, it is lovely and cool inside
&gt; and I am wearing shorts and a light shirt - my working shirt. Not that I
&gt; have done any work recently, but I was hoping to repot some seedlings today.
&gt; It looks as though I will have to postpone that until tomorrow.  Today, I
&gt; just don't seem to be able to reach my metabolic equilibrium and have the
&gt; associated flu-like symptoms and extreme lassitude. If I don't do any
&gt; physical activity I can generally find some sort of metabolic equilibrium in
&gt; front of my computer, so long as I just play computer games or watch videos
&gt; ;-) I also slept really well because the lady who lives above me is
&gt; apparently on holiday and I was able to sleep through without being woken up
&gt; at 06:30 by her getting up and slamming doors and similar. I have spoken to
&gt; her once about it and will do so again and if that does not work then I will
&gt; write a letter to the building's administrator. I will also tell her that
&gt; when she comes back. There is a definite increase in my quality of life when
&gt; I can sleep through to 08:00 or so, given that I have to get up at least
&gt; once in the night anyway and do not obtain a full 6-8 hours on the stretch
&gt; sleep like most other mortals. The law is also on my side because no
&gt; disturbance is allowed between 23:00 and 07:00 at night.

&gt; With respect to infections, I am amazed at how I have managed to avoid
&gt; really major infections over the past couple of years, although I have had
&gt; all the required jabs and live in happy isolation. I have been bitten a
&gt; couple of times recently by mosquitos or something because I have not got
&gt; around to putting up the window fly netting, yet. I will have to wait for a
&gt; better day. Anyway, I am so immunosupressed that I am not reacting to the
&gt; bites, so no itching, which is great - no bites would be better though for
&gt; aesthetic reasons.

&gt; I am thinking of baking a banana cake or making some drop scones now. I
&gt; haven't made up my mind yet and, indeed, it could well remain just a thought
&gt; today. However, I am hungry so I have to do something without delay.

&gt; Have a good day for me.

Well, I think the 'without a second thought' was really for the loss of the
female bits. I do get very edgy prior to surgery and after 9 times, have a
routine of either going out for a movie or watching a DVD and having my last
supper, as I call it. I am well aware that any surgery can result in death
and I do not enjoy the prospect of the hospital stay and the associated pain
and temporary incapacity. I hope that I am not giving the impression that I
go in singing and dancing, because that is far from it. Although, I do
remember going in for that surgery and a doctor took my blood pressure and
she was very surprised that it was 90/60 or so. She told me that it should
be way higher because of the stress of coming into hospital. I told her that
I would try harder next time - I have low blood pressure due to my problems
with dehydration and in a fasted state I start collapsing very quickley. I
generally spend the weeks running up to the operation worrying and generally
organising my will, living will, power of attorney, etc., and then am really
calm when I get into hospital. In this case there was a slight suspicion
that it could be cancer, although the surgeon said that he did not think
that I had cancer. Whatever, he did recommend that I had everything out
because I was in a real gynaecological mess - just like a lot of Crohn's
ladies end up being. Eight weeks after the operation I flew from Germany to
Australia on a business trip on my own to Sydney and Singapore so I
recovered relatively quickly.

As an aside, everybody: whatever you do try and hang on to as many bits of
you that you can. Surgery should really only be the very last option and
remember to go for those routine check-ups.

I think all of you who have had ops are brave! I would worry and panic
so much that I'd bring a Crohn's flare on anyway! I get anxious very
easily, my heart races a lot lol! I'm even terrified of my up-coming
tonsillectomy! How stupid is that? When people like you have had real
major surgery! I'm just scared because the throat is such an awkward
place, talking, swallowing, breathing, eating, drinking....And the
surgeon and people who have had it all remind me of how tremendously
painful it's going to be. And I was there when my friends artery
ruptured in her throat a week after her tonsillectomy!

The nose surgery doesn't bother me because it's not an awkward place
(apart from I like sleeping on my side and front!) They'll only be
breaking my septum, burning my airways to open them up, and draining
my sinuses.

Vanny,

Actually, I wasn't referring to the stress of surgery but rather the ramifications of loosing those &quot;female parts&quot;, i.e. ovaries and the hormones they produce.

I know when I had my surgery I was too sick to be that nervous.  And, in retrospect, after learning how bad my insides were, it was definitely the right decision.
