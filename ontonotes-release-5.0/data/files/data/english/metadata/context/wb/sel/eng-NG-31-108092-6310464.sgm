Hello,

I enjoy camping and I am more and more concerned with being able to
wash myself and my things in the outdoors and not horribly pollute the
environment. I have heard and read that Ivory Bar Soap is
biodegradable and safe for the environment. What about Ivory Liquid
Soap? Or do you have other suggestions for liquid soap (besides
Castile) to be used for body and/or other cleaning other things?

Whatever soap you use, remember to dump it out on the ground well away
from any water source that's around.  It'll soak in and biodegrade.  I
believe Ivory soap and any of the castile soaps will biodegrade
easily.  Dr. Bonners is advertised as biodegradable.  I'd think any of
the usual liquids used for dishwashing by hand should be harmless to
most of the environment.

Almost entirely harmless. Really.

The original poster stipulated "not castile".  You'd have to ask them
why they said that.
