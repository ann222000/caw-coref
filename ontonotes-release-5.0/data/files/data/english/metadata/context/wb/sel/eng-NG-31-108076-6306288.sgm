But in all seriousness, given this, you have to ask yourself if you
are willing to contract Hep B and possibly scarring/cirrhosis of the
liver in order to continue practicing. Is it worth it? Hmm.

The study was done with Olympic wrestlers, but as the report says, the
conclusions (and they are tentative) refer to any contact sport. The issues with
contact sports/blood/HIV have been well addressed, but sweat is kinda
different....exertion leads to sweat, virtually everyone sweats.

Martial arts or sports that require little or no contact should be ok, so you
have nothing to worry about, Oliver.

You'd be suprised how wrong you can be when you talk about stuff you
have no experience - at all - with. Case in point. In my art beyond
the beginner's stage there's a contact exercise and there is in fact a
risk posed by sweat, albeit on a much smaller scale because the
contact is not full body as in grappling.

I think the real reason I wouldn't have anything to worry about is
because we generally wouldn't continue to train if there was blood
flowing (just a mental experiment - never been in that situation while
training push hands). Anyways yeah there is a risk but it is less than
what you're exposed to.

So yeah is this a risk you're willing to take? Hep B to continue with
BJJ? It's an interesting point. If 10% of all olympic wrestlers
exhibit Hep B in their sweat, what do you suppose the percentage is in
bjj/grappling today? Did you get tested yourself? These are serious
questions. Even at 3% vs. 10%, it poses a serious risk, if it indeed
does transmit this way it could explode in the MMA community. There is
the serious risk that a strain could develop which more easily
transmits via this channel as well.

Another reference, "Infection by bodily fluids such as saliva, sweat,
tears or urines is highly unlikely (in casual contact) " (from
http://health.shiawassee.net/STD/std.htm ). They're talking about HIV
and casual contact. Highly unlikely in personal contact means likely
to a degree, and also implies "more likely" in a full contact
environment such as grappling with speedos.

Hmm, this seems like a question for a specialist on STDs.

There's a lot of work to be done before anyone should get worried. To the best of
my knowledge there are no known cases so far.

Arts which have active training and sparring have many other, more likely risks
and we live with those, so this one is no biggie.

Hi 你好.

I must admit I find it hard to understand what you're talking about.
Care to point out this ignorance you speak of? You're the one that
brought up the subject about STDs transmitting via sweat, I'm just
asking an honest question and you seem to have a chip on your
shoulder. Maybe you could clarify this situation by explaining to
everyone here exactly what this chip consists of. Are you looking for
another deathmatch challenge? If so go ahead and propose one. Now,
back to the discussion at hand:

Here's something which may justify future work. According to NWHIC
there are estimated around 1.5 million Hep B carriers in the U.S. The
CDC in 2001 said there are 417,000 infected people. 750,000 people in
the United States from NIAID (all figures taken from
wrongdiagnosis.com).

So taking some more round numbers, let's assume a million infected
people in the USA and a population of 250 million.

This would mean the prevelance rate is less than one percent, 0.4% to
be exact. Incidentally this figure is almost exactly the same as the
worldwide hep B prevalence rate - 360 million / 6 billion. We now see
the concern behind the article. The rate in olympic wrestlers can be
as high as thirty times the national or worldwide average.

The question now becomes why. It is not known how much viable Hep B
there is in sweat compared to blood. Seeing as how it is not logical
to propose that wrestlers (or grapplers for that matter) generally
live unhealthy lifestyles compared to anyone else, we are left with a
mystery. What is it exactly about wrestling or grappling in general
that causes such a high incidence rate?

I bet we could dig up some more numbers on the net and do a study on
this. It's obvious that not everyone who wrestles (or grapples) is
going to "get aids". But if there is a solid observation behind this I
think someone more qualified than myself should take a deeper look
inside.

No chip, chump. I was simply pointing out that your reference to me re ignorance
applies most aptly to you.

Are you looking for
another deathmatch challenge? If so go ahead and propose one. Now,
back to the discussion at hand:

Why should I? You disappeared and ran like a frightened chicken when I called you
last time. Have you found your testicles since then?

If you have, make an offer...make it worth my while. Canada is a long way for me
to go to beat a up a muggins like you.

I'd estimate it would equate to many thousands of towels being wrung, so you'd
better put in some overtime, eh?

A crock, ehh? That's not what the medical profession says. Remember,
we are not talking about *casual contact* here. We're also not talking
about taking a bath in sweat from someone who has aids. I think you
can recognize that. We're talking about something in the middle. It's
definately not a crock, as the new evidence we're talking about seems
to imply that the link is through non-casual contact with sweat and
blood during wrestling/grappling/whatever.

It'd be a real shame to see this get buried with pointless flames,
there might be something to this after all. The report said that the
incidence in wrestlers was thirty times the national average. That's

Well it's hep b we're talking about here - not aids. I don't think it
kills you straight out :) However the report does seem to indicate
that 5% of those who contract hep B develop serious problems. To quote
the article we're discussing (you did read it, right?) "The Hepatitis
B virus attacks the liver and causes a lifelong infection in
approximately 5% of adults who catch it."

You're the one bringing up ignorance. One problem sir. It's not

&gt; &gt; Why don't you hold that thought and work with me here and come up with

&gt; &gt; the national average.

&gt; I'm not at all sure it is. Bear in mind how closed this study was..who's to say
&gt; the incidence is not similar among other contact sports.

&gt; I posted it out of general interest, not because I thought it was 100% accurate.

Right. It was a survey of something like 70 wrestlers. A very small
sample, too. There are a lot of unknowns. I guess for now there isn't
any other information on this available but if some comes up it's
definately on my list of things to do.

Sure, you wanna talk some more about that? No problem. Did I make a mistake? Yes,
I did. A curious mistake too, as I have a 1985 copy of Kimura's book right here
and should have looked at it first. But let's get down to the nub. Why did Kimura
train like that? To be a good striker? Nope. He was a rotten striker. He did it
to toughen his hands for Judo. References to this technique by you are
disingenuous as it's best known practitioner was a karateka with a similar name.
I'm human, I make mistakes, and when I do, I admit them.

Fine. Tai Chi is good exercise, I liken it to Yoga. But as a ma, well, despite
what some say here, I just can't see it. And even *if* one could construe it as
one, I would not rank it highly.

This is all quite separate from a discussion re whether 'Chi' exists. One can
obtain positive, verifiable results from something yet still be utterly wrong
about *why* those results were gained.

All this "Ooooh I'm feeling my Chi rise..." is so much bullshit. Chi is not a
force separate from any of the well known biophysical forces within the human
body. If it *is* some undetectable force then we have nothing to say about it,
any more than we have to say about invisible pink unicorns.

Only when GDS and Fu come together could a thread about hep B and
sweat end up as a discussion about Tai Chi as a martial art.

GDS, I remember an excellent post you made about six months ago, aug
22 to be precise. I'll quote the main points of your message:

"This is said, but hundreds of millions of Chinese practice it and the
ma
applications are never evident to them. Go there ask them if you don't
believe me."
"...Or could it be that Tai
Chi really is a ma, but never shows this aspect to the world? Sounds
like
poor PR to me...."
"I think you're confusing have focus or a peaceful mind with combat
effectiveness. The 'real' Tai Chi teacher would not be capable of any
kicking anyone's ass if he did not train in effective techniques.
"Power of
working from one's center" is just a slurry of words that makes
grammatical
sense and nothing more. "

I would have to say that the general public (this includes those old
people in the park too) is completely in the dark with respect to Tai
Chi. It is really all about people's pride. People don't like to be
told that they don't know stuff, especially after their friends have
told them they know a great deal. The truth about tai chi takes a long
time to explain and is of little practical value, and is rather
surreal the first time you hear it. Plus everyone has a slightly
different spin on the same kernel I would guess.

As for that couple you knew.. I believe you've inherited the public's
misinformation that old people in the park practice tai chi. They
don't. It may look the same, but only to someone who has never seen
the real thing. Those old people - they are doing chi kung, not tai
chi. There is a very real difference, it is not a semantic defenition
at all. And it's also an important distinction to make, because if I
were to open a school or try to sell a book about Tai Chi, I don't
want a lot of old people coming to my door. I want people who want to
learn how to defend themselves. the misinformation has extended to the
old people telling you they do tai chi, i.e. they are using buzzwords
they don't understand. Seriously, thats how bad it is nowadays. People
have no clue whatsoever. And, some people like it that way. It's
amusing in a sick sort of way. But it is their choice - they have no
interest in the truth at all. They just want to make themselves
healthier. A noble goal.

Those old people - I know fifty of them offhand. They're beginner
level most of them and will be until the day they die. They're honest
and kind and dedicated and what not, sure, but I wouldn't listen to
them if they tried to teach me anything about tai chi. This is what
you have to understand, there are a lot of barriers to really getting
to know what tai chi is about. A lot. Many of them insurmountable by
choice of the person involved.

Since you didn't tell me what you learned from that couple I will be
generous to you and assume you learned at least part of the "yang long
form" (don't get me started) and some warm up exercises. Given that
scenario I am completely confident in saying you are just as must in
the dark with respect to tai chi as the general population. You
couldn't possibly know what you are talking about with respect to tai
chi as a martial art, because you have never seen it or been exposed
to it. Am I right? So while I can understand and agree with you that
what those people in the park do isn't really useful in martial arts,
you have to understand that what they do is not a martial art and it
never really was intended to be.

There was the odd aficionado who would stop by the park once in a
while, i.e. a couple of times a year, and give some instruction to
some of the more dedicated people in the park but it was few and far
between and nothing on the level to actually teach anyone anything
they could use to defend themselves. I'd have to say that what you see
in the park and even in most yang style based mctaichi dojos is so far
removed from what you are supposed to do that.. well.. I don't even
know how to convey it. It's mind boggling. I sat down once to try and
go over one small aspect of the truth about tai chi and it came up
over ten pages of fourteen point courier new. Furthermore it's
unpublishable because it comes to several conclusions which violate my
personal code of ethics :) Sometimes I so dearly want to spill the
beans on tai chi but I likely never will, except one day if I open a
school about it. I'll probably have to (open a school that is), or
I'll die crumpled with a terrible weight on my chest - a fate worse
than death itself.

Hmmm. Perhaps it's just me, but someone who was born in China who has been doing
Tai Chi for 70+ years...why would I think they are beginners? Why would I believe
an occidental would have a greater grasp than they?

Look Ollie....there's plenty of reasons why people do a martial art. Some do it
because of their desire to dominate others (Trav). Some do it for physical
fitness, others for some spiritual enlightenment thing. Some do it for
self-defence, some do it as a sport if it has any sports aspect to it. So at a
personal level, to criticise someone's martial art is kinda nonsensical.

But at another level it is not. Few people I've met in my experience think that
their martial would be useless if they were assaulted in some way, after all,
it's 'martial', right?

At this level we *can* make comparisons as to efficacy. The average mall McDojo
stuff, where soccer moms learn death-touches and their 8 year olds have black
belts, well imho these people are being given a false sense of security that
borders on the criminal. Or Yellow Bamboo as an extreme example...and you know
what pisses me off about that lot? It's lazy. People looking for a silver bullet.
Forget years of hard work, conditioning, discipline and training...just shake and
wiggle and watch 'em fall.

But there are ways and means to assess efficacy, and one of them is to walk into
a cage or a ring with few rules, or no rules if you prefer, there are places
where all rules can be waived if you wish. The Gracies were not the first to do
this, but they were the pioneers in the modern era, and any art that wants to
make a claim as to its efficacy has an opportunity to do so.

So maybe Tai Chi has been given short shrift and its PR is poor. They know what
to do, the door is open. Wrestlers, Judoka, Karateka and many others have stepped
up. Let them do the same.

If it's just about getting healthy, fine and good. But if it's about
fighting.......

First of all, you're assuming a lot with the 70+ year comment. Most
older chinese folk who practice in the part didn't start until post-40
or 50. Proof? None of them are under 50. Sometimes it comes down to a
get together of an existing social club - there are many reasons how
and why such groups come into being.

If you're talking about the couple you met then it's certainly
impressive. Yet still.. the only glimmer of hope in that situation
would be if that couple were indoor students of the yang family*. Not
bloody likely i'm afraid. This is just the way it works. It's been
watered down too much, the lines of transmission gouged out as much as
possible without allowing them to break.

Why would you trust an occidental like me? Well lets see. I started
Tai Chi at 16. I've studied every major style, however the majority of
my time has been spent with Yang style and Chen style in that order
(although shortly Chen style will become #1 in time spent practising
^^). I studied and practiced in asian run and american run dojos. I
practiced in the park with seniors, several different groups and
several different parks. In short because I'm serious about it. If you
can't see why that qualifies me over a couple of gents in the park who
are doing it for health and exercise I'm afraid nothing will.

Thats why I am saying they're not doing tai chi, they're doing chi

fight. If not, then how is it a martial art? Right?

Jogging isn't a martial art but may help you more often than not if

Yeah thats my major complaint with the taoist tai chi folks and the
majority of yang style mcdojos out there. Many of these schools will
teach the yang long form and tell you that if you practice it twice a
day for 20 years or until you're old and weak you will magically be
able to defend yourself in a fight. Or some will even say it's just
for health and they don't practice the fighting aspect yet insinuate
that tai chi is the "grand ultimate fist" and the ultimate martial art
ever. Poppycock. Yet it is supported by no end of rumors and stories
about old masters or the sifu's grandfather or whatever.

They don't see the need. Frankly I am not sure I do either. It's a bit
of a double standard I admit. From the outside looking in it is easy

As I have begun to understand more and more, In Chinese martial arts,
the number one quality is morality. Only when wu de (martial arts
morality) had been tested extensively would a student be granted
access deeper and deeper into martial science. I must admit I am
forced to agree and that I am struck by the romantic nature of this
system. It's a function of Chinese culture. I decided to value it
enough that I moved to asia in order to further my study of tai chi.
As a logical consequence you can assure yourself the vast numbers of
people who learned tai chi from books and magazines and in large
groups led by assistant instructors, that these people don't have the
real deal and probably never will. And furthermore they don't even
care, they're just thrilled to be doing what they're doing.

Fighting hmm. Yes my goal personally is combat effectiveness. I'll let
you know how it goes. But don't expect any deathmatch challenges or
for me to alter my life to somehow attempt to prove tai chi in the
ring. I'm just not that kind of guy, it's not really my disposition
you know. Sure I spar with people I meet when I can, but frankly I
have much more useful things to do with my time than sportfighting. I
guess it's simply fate.

deny my assumption that you learned yang style from them).

mostly because you don't understand the history, nor the difference between
qigong and taiji.
*Most* tiechee is practiced as a qigong- no intent of martial application.
It would be very unusual if they actually had the Chen Mechanism- most
'transmissions' were incomplete in that regard.
It's similar to 'pentjak &amp; silat'- the practice of the choreography may be
entirely seperate from studying the martial application, and also the

No.
The term is simply too generic to make any real conclusions from it. The
fact that qigong practice can be loosely subsumed under 'martial arts'
doesn't say anything about either it's intent or application. Same can be
said for 'temple dancers'.

&gt; But there are ways and means to assess efficacy, and one of them is to

Most people who go to a school to learn to fight, at all, don't ever want to
apply it- they're interested in probabilities. The system being 'tested' has
to have the same goals as the test protocol, or it's impertinent.

&gt; The Gracies were not the first to do this, but they were the pioneers in

Mostly, they brought it to mass-media entertainment.
Remember that it was illegal in most States- Colorado was chosen for the
first UFC because we have a long history of nhb-fighting- and they *still*
had to set rules in order to do it publicly. What went on underground came
'up', that's all.

I still want someone to answer the question- if you could punch a hole in
somebody, would you do it to win a prizefight?

&gt; If it's just about getting healthy, fine and good. But if it's about

If it's about fighting, there's a reason that taiji was respected in a
completely different class than other martial arts- and that it was confined
to only one family/village. It's similar to the Okinawan/Japanese practice
of what they thought they saw the Chinese doing- just because it looks
similar means nothing.

Thats an interesting question Chas. Think of this... A famous chinese
weapon is the sleeve arrow. Would you sneak a sleeve arrow into a
ringfight? This is the problem. The mentality of the whole thing is
completely different. The ring is a different kind of game
unfortunately. It's not that the techniques are too deadly to be used
in the ring. It's that the great and romantic thing about traditional
arts is how few assumptions they make. Sleeve arrows? watch out, maybe
he has em. That's why you will see in movies where they kneel and
brush their sleeves. To show they don't have any sleeve arrows. You
could say, it's kind of like tipping your hat. There are many
traditions revolving around this principle.

So I propose many of the people who COULD punch a hole in someone
wouldn't prizefight because they wouldn't see the point in such an
endeavour. The point of the endeavour is that a smaller or weaker
person can defeat a stronger and bigger person through skill. Thats
what judo says, BJJ, and even tai chi. And when you have the skills to
show it, there is little point to going out and destroying someone
with less skills. Think of a pro chess player. What use does he have
for amateurs? Or to go back to the sleeve arrow thing. Lets say you
could literally punch a hole in someone. Where would the fun be if you
did? The audience would be shocked too. It's not what they wanted to
see. But it works. So now you're standing there with a seriously
injured man, regardless of how he became that way, lets say it
happened to be through superior skill. Are you happy that you injured
him? What was the ultimate goal? I just don't get it. It's not a
training exercise. It is divisive and it actually lowers the overall
quality of martial arts since the other guy won't be able to train for
weeks or perhaps months or perhaps ever.

When you remove these so-called devastating moves, it allows you to concentrate

The gracies are newbies in the martial arts world. I don't mean their
skill. I mean their attitude.

I refer you to the story of Huo Yuanjia. An undefeated fighter of
british hong kong in the 20th century, he founded perhaps the second
most popular and influential martial arts organization in world
history. He defeated MANY foreign boxers and wrestlers. This is all
well documented, albeit mostly in Chinese. Most of the English stuff
is from movies.

He was assassinated - poisoned. Apparently his enemies couldn't beat
his version of the "gracie challenge" so he was murdered in his sleep.
Cowardly? Yes. Realistic? Yes. Could it happen to you or me? YES. I
wouldn't issue a "gracie challenge" even if I had the skills, even if
it meant I had to nutritionally starve to death locked in a cage full
of twinkies.

This isn't the only such story. There are many accounts of
undefeatable martial artists who were betrayed, poisoned, killed in
their sleep, etc. It is not CULTURALLY or MORALLY ACCEPTABLE to issue
such standing challenges in China. That is why they don't exist, not
because your worldview tells you that they're weak "Sick men of
martial arts". No one wants to step up because it's people like you
that resort to violence to prove your point when friendly debate turns
against you. True or not that is the perception.

Furthermore... everyone in your average mma school (trav, gi, grap240
are all prime examples) has this "come get some" mentality which
doesen't make logical sense. They are NOT top fighters. They're middle
of the road fighters. You included, GDS.

I mean lets be honest if you were ALL world champion fighters that
wouldn't make sense. No one is going to defeat you and then claim to
be the world's best fighter, it just doesen't work that way no matter
how good you are. You're not that important and neither am I. Really
such things as the superiority of one art or another will be decided
by people other than you or me, and us talking about it is like dogs
trying to answer math questions.

Well guess what. The perception is that people "like you" i.e. people

when debate turns against you. To you the ring is the ultimate proving

would want to walk into a MMA school when the perception is that
anyone who practises or believes anything other than the BJJ/MMA party

for what they believe, that theyre the new peice of meat thrown to the

calling me a clueless boofhead and a clown, by denigrating me for my

Difference is, I don't shout about my accomplishments, even when idiots like
Dobson demand I do so. I could, and they are not inconsiderable, but it would
just seem like a wank, so I don't.

My goals nowadays are to learn more and to help others. I don't claim huge
knowledge about Chinese ma's, but I have had quite some exposure and for the most
part I have been less than impressed. Others may have had different
experiences...good for them.

What you don't get, is that you can disagree without being disrespectful. Chas
and I disagree about truckloads of things, as an example. Ronnie does too, but at
the heart of that disagreement is a mutual respect that no amount of vigorous
debate will dislodge.

So, let's have another look then...."No one wants to step up because it's people
like you that resort to violence ...."

See what I mean? PEOPLE LIKE ME???

How can I 'work together' with you when you say stuff like that? Hmmm? Think
about it.

Think about the story of Huo Yuanjia. Anyways I've already said as
much in my last post so i'll say it yet again. My intention was to
refer to Huo Yuanjia's enemies and not you specifically. People like
you was mentioned, as was "if this is true or not, it is the

your feelings okay? man. If you want an apology, then I'm sorry to

Particularly, and send you to someone who could demonstrate the mechanism?
I've mentioned the cultivation of body-weapons for years; nothing new about

Your position is/was that it's impossible, and you've never known anyone who
practiced it anyway.

Nope- met a number of them that wished they hit as hard as internal stylists

Like I say; easily proven.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's why you condition your hands if you want to do startling things.
Or did you assume that I meant a guy wearing boxing gloves- or even using
his hand, for that matter?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I notice none of you guys has a report on your actual visit to one of the
&gt;&gt; recognized adepts.
&gt; They're not putting up a challenge, are they? Maybe in the dim past, but
&gt; recently? Aren't you the one saying that challenging *them* is
&gt; disrespectful? But if we don't then we can't speak about their amazing
&gt; feats? You can't have it both ways, Chas.
">

You have an opinion about internal strength- you've been invited to
investigate it. You've not done that- but still give voice to an opinion
that can be easily refuted at your leisure.
'Challenge'?
An invitation to experience something outside your previous understanding
isn't a 'challenge'- it's a positive refutation of your skepticism.
I certainly wouldn't sign anybody up to fight- if you want to jump on them,
that's on you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You always wondered why people didn't go visit the Gracies.......?
&gt; People did, and of course the Gracies were the ones who advertised the
&gt; challenge so the disrespect thing didn't arise.
">

People go visit the Chen folks as well- and are uniformly persuaded. I've
never heard of anyone, not one single one, who remained unconvinced-
Of course, actual experience trumps anything-
I'd love to see you actually post some evidence that one of your
associates/trusted witnesses had the experience and reported it's
invalidity- just one would be sufficient to give any indication at all of
fraud, or actual 'science'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Yeah- I've had a touch of it, and seen the more powerful expression from
&gt;&gt; a number of people.
&gt; So you've said. It seems like a rather closed arrangement though, not a
&gt; public challenge.
">

Nope- several people have stepped forward as public exponents of the skill.
My reticence has always been to sign someone else up for anything- I still
haven't challenged anybody to do anything but feel a little tap from someone
who advertises his skills.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I've also boxed with world-class competitors; Ronny Lyle as an example (I
&gt;&gt; didn't do well). I've been hit by boxers all my damned life, bud.
&gt; Me too...and I've never met anyone who could punch a hole in someone.
">

My point precisely.
That posits an entire range of experiences that you don't share- which means
that your opinion exists only in the vacuum of your information.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And, the hole-punching guys aren't taiji- they're 'internal'
&gt;&gt; practitioners, but not taiji.
&gt; I dispute that anyone can do this. Is there any record of it happening, or
&gt; is it just a metaphor? I suspect the latter.
">

I have no idea about 'records'-
not at all a metaphor; punch a hole in you- starting from 'stark nekkid'; no
blades.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; When you remove these so-called devastating moves, it allows you to
&gt; concentrate on getting to where you could use them. They're just the icing
&gt; on the cake, and of course, guys like Gene LeBell are experts in such
&gt; nasties, and gee whiz, he's a grappler. I know as many or more nasties as
&gt; anyone I've ever met, cos I've trained with guys who developed the basics
&gt; first.
">

You seem to assume that 'tricks' are the entire curriculum- they're not.
And, one of Gene's best friends is Victor de Thouars- that's where I met
him. Their association has been because of the grappling aspect of serak- a
major component of the system.
And, Gene's a phenom- you can't measure anyone by him. He's unique; perfect
body for it, perfect time/place for early instruction, personal motivation
to excel.
The difference is in the range of techniques, not the preference in lieu of
'basics'. For us, it's more natural to include that body of information
rather than work in some fantasy that excludes it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If you're so breathlessly brash as to weather a hole-in-you,

">

What 'details'?
'Names, dates and places' wouldn't do you any good- you don't know (them). I
don't care to detail to you what's necessary to do it, because it's
complicated and needs be done under supervision. I also don't care to give
you personal information, because that's their information to reveal, not
mine.
Loosely; it was in the thigh; cqb in a smallish room- fighting with a drug
cartel enforcer; a very strong fighter. I knew both the guys- one better
than the other, admittedly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  you just mean 'capable of' then that means something else. No one hit
&gt; harder than Ernie Shavers, Foreman was a monster and Marciano P4P probably
&gt; was the hardest of all.
">

Yeah; Bill de Thouars was in Marciano's camp- I think a lot of Marciano's
strategies came from that source- same as the Cassius Clay influence, and
the BLee influence. Each of them had an 'epiphany' that coincides with their
exposure to him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Were they also 'capable of'? I'd say so. But if you're saying some
&gt; internal guy could hit harder than Foreman, Shavers or Marciano and indeed
&gt; did punch a hole in someone, you have some evidence?
">

What 'evidence'?
Do you expect that I would tattle on someone, just to attend your idle
curiosity- particularly when you won't do the slightest thing to address an
actual experience?
By the way- in the direct example, I was using 'punch' as opposed to
'drill'/cut/stab- in fact, it's done with the foot. The other people I know
would 'punch' as means 'with the hand'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's not compelling when I have no info from you as to who it was that did
&gt; this remarkable feat.
">

You're already clear that it 'can't be done', never has been done- with the
corollaries that conditioning does nothing useful, internal strength is
impossible, and you have no intention of actually finding out.
What possible information could 'his name' add to that? Do you expect a url
with a story from some authority you might/might not accept anyway?
After all, your disbelief is immaterial to anyone with an actual experience.

&gt; &gt; have stepped up. Let them do the same.

&gt; The PR is just fine.  Why do you think the names of the moves are
&gt; non-descriptive?

&gt; &gt; If it's just about getting healthy, fine and good. But if it's about
&gt; &gt; fighting.......

&gt; Then you need to learn from someone who can fight.

That's an interesting take on it all, Wayne. I'm impressed.

I think it leads into a discussion about wu de. But maybe I'll leave
that for it's own thread, someday :p

&gt; No one wants to step up because it's people like you
&gt;&gt; that resort to violence to prove your point when friendly debate turns
&gt;&gt; against you. True or not that is the perception.

&gt; Go fuck yourself. I don't 'resort to violence' you FUCKTARD. Anyone who
&gt; knows me knows I'm a peaceful guy, the LAST person to initiate violence.

&gt; I try to treat you kindly and you come out with unprovoked shit like
&gt; this.Well truce over, Oliver. When I rain shit down on you, just remember
&gt; who drew first blood.

&gt; &quot;I speak peace when peace is spoken,
&gt; But I speak war when your when your hate is provoking
&gt; The season is open 24-7-365
&gt; Man up, your time to ride...are we clear? If you step in my 'hood, it's
&gt; understood...it's open season&quot;

&gt; But you call me, now...it's open season on you, Oliver Richman, master of
&gt; fuck-all.
