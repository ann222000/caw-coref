I have to laugh that Geoff beat me to the internet with the pictures.
I've crossposted this to rbb as well, as there  may be those there who
have some construction suggestions.

Today I'll take copious pictures of the real damage - inside, where
we'll have to take the boat apart.

I also want to add a non-damage discussion point WRT all the marvelous
offers of help which have been arriving, including overwhelming the
phone lines at KBW (we arrived after hours on Friday, so have no
knowledge of what happened other than a yardie commented about the
office phone ringing off the hook; they're out until Tuesday, at which
point I'll learn more).  We have put our interior back together, and
if you didn't know where to look, you'd not know anything had
occurred.  So, until the insurance company takes it from us, we have a
place to live - one less hurdle to address.

We're also creeping up on possibilities of transportation.  We have
two offers, both from people far away, of loans of a vehicle, both of
which require TLC from a mechanic to be functional, so we don't yet
have a resolution on that.  Practically speaking, given the realities,
if Flying Pig is to be saved, it will be because we take over the
refit work.  That will involve all the sorts of things we did in our
initial work, including hauling lots of stuff.  We did that in the van
we gave away the day we left, so have nothing to use for that
purpose.  So, a truck, van or SUV, the more beat-up (representing
little risk of compromise) but mechanically reliable, the better.  One
of those offered is 1000 miles away, so making this happen is
challenging at very best; a local benefactor would be much more
effective.

Physically, we're still exhausted, because, despite having "nothing
to do" we're not getting nearly enough sleep in regular terms, let
alone trying to catch up with the shortfall.  Otherwise, we're sound
of body ...

... Of mind, we're oscillating between optimism and despair.  The
despair part will be more clear below; the optimism is my usual mode,
including the troubleshooting (focus on the solution, not the problem,
but identify the problem before charging off in all directions) of our
situation.  I'm happiest when solving problems, so I should have
plenty to keep me entertained for a while.

On to the damage report:

The exterior of the boat I could easily (if time-consumingly) do
myself, having just done much more than the equivalent in blister
repair.  For that matter, so could Lydia, as she's done a great deal
of the repair which photos will show survived the abuse.  I'll save a
detailed discussion until I have the pix up.

The other fiberglass work is very straightforward, too.  However...

Virtually all the starboard bulkheads from the galley bulkhead aft are
detabbed now.  Only a little of what I can see came loose from the
hull, but the bulkheads moved substantially (but remained intact; we
lost only one tile on the head/ER bulkhead over the tub, e.g.).  It's
a simple process to cut away the old, grind the hull to make a bonding
point, and do it over again.

What's not so easy is the removal of the settee to get to the sole,
removing that to get to the forward, Vee shaped with "frog legs"
extensions, water tank which butts up against the bulkhead between the
galley sink and settees.  I presume the water tank has also
delaminated from the hull; it goes across the entire salon, requiring
removal of the other settee, and all the sole, as well.  It's intact,
more testimony to how stout this boat is.  Of course, it's far bigger
than any of the exits, so will have to be propped up somewhere while
we work. And, in any event, it would have to be removed in order to
access the bulkhead at the hull behind where it was placed.

Under/aft of the salon water tank, is the mast well.  The crotch of
the "frog legs" is the majority of the mast well.  Support for the
mast step has been compromised.  Perhaps it's sound - and could be
addressed with the mast in place.  However, when you pull the tank,
you pull most of the mast well (only the back of it, the bulkhead,
remains).  Oops. Gotta redo the entire step assembly, probably, and
certainly at a minimum, pull the mast.  Rigger Fee Ouchies, followed
by the electrical realities of the fact that it appears this mast
hasn't been removed since it left the factory, as a great number of
the wires up the mast are solid and will have to be cut and then
remade on restoration of the mast

But wait - there's more.  On the galley side, much the same exists.
It took us nearly a year of work to build that galley; much of it will
have to be redone after we saw it out.  The reefer is integral to the
engine room bulkhead, and aside from the cooling part, won't be
salvageable. It will have to be custom built, all over again, a *very*
fiddly piece of work. To get to the engine room tabbing, and the other
side of the settee mentioned above, the entire galley and starboard
water tank will have to come out.

The only good news in that is the new sole will be done right, instead
of just the extra layer of (very beautiful) teak and holly laid over a
rot stabilization from the prior icebox drain leaking, done in some
prior owner's repairs/maintenance.  That tank, too, is intact.  We'll
have to saw out the reefer which was custom built from the ground up
(see postings from a couple of years ago) to get to the ER tabbing.

It gets better. The starboard motor mount stringers were heaving in
the pounding, too, as was the battery box, in the location commonly
where the genset would be.  That area was the only one where I saw
hull-bulkhead detabbing, as one of the stringers we'd rebuilt, aft,
had pulled off the hull.  However, the ER sole will have to come out
in order to get to the tabbing on the galley bulkhead, and it will
take further examination, but I see the distinct possibility for
having to pull the engine (not out, just up, through the hole provided
in the sole of the cockpit) in order to address the likely detabbing
of the mounts stringers.

Aft, the tub will have to come out - an interesting project, I'm sure,
and perhaps destroying the expensive tiling job that was done just
before we left, as well as the custom molding into which the
plexiglass custom dividers are set (though, perhaps, given that it's
only a couple of weeks old, the caulk might release the plastic - but
the plastic, too, might be destroyed in the attempt), and at least
part of the sole (installed under the tub in the original building
process) will have to be cut out, and later, custom shimming done to
support it and the tub structure as it's replaced.

So, it's all very straightforward - but intensely expensive to have
done, and nearly inconceivable that the insurance company won't total
it.  I have no doubt that at quality contract rates, even if I do the
contracting myself (thus saving some money over the yard being general
contractor), our remaining 100K (after paying for the salvage and
midnight emergency haul first) won't begin to cover it.

Yet, it can't not be done, if the boat is to sail again, as it's
integral to the strength of the hull.  In fact, in talking with my
surveyor, now a friend (whose brother's M462 I found an owner for
after the insurance company totaled it following a galley fire), who
was the QC and Service Manager at Morgan during the entire production
run of our boat, he suggests that due to the flexing the hull's had,
more rather than less bulkhead strength is advised.  Once it's apart,
that will be pretty easy to accomplish, so I'm not concerned, but it's
very good information to have.  He also told me exactly what materials
were used in the tabbing, so, I'm sure it can be done properly.

I've done nearly all of what's needed for access other than pulling
out the tanks, already, in the course of our refit. I have no
illusions of simplicity or ease.  I have no doubt that with as many
people as could fit into all the spaces, working simultaneously
(which, of course, can't happen in realistic terms), it would take
many hundreds of manhours to accomplish, but still would take not less
than a month, more likely two, of multiple crews treating each area
(saloon, galley, engine room, aft head) as a separate project.  At
typical yard rates, that would instantly kill our insurance policy.

Of course, in addition to all the fiberglass, paint, epoxy, bottom
paint and the like outside, there's the replacement of the rudder, a
significant cost in itself.  Even in that, I have a clear idea of
what's needed, as I was able to visit a sistership, the single 463
built, in which the rudder and support at the bottom was removed
during his refit.  All very straightforward, all very expensive...

That doesn't address the mayhem topsides; nearly all of our running
rigging is toast, flogged to a nice fuzz, or, stripping the outer
coating leaving the core either exposed or compromised further, or
knotted in a basketball-sized agglomeration, the KISS generator was
ripped from its pole, leaving nothing but a blackened stump and a
wire, the VHF antenna broke its mount, requiring unfishing and
refishing of the antenna line to remount, bimini stitching failed in a
couple of places, the propane system went south (maybe a connection?
solenoid? kinked line?), the genoa is shredded in its furling (now I
understand how it works in hurricanes with furled gennies), the main
has a tear in the leech, the staysail cover is tattered, the toe rail
is shattered where the salvor's line gave way and ripped both chocks
out, the hailer is gone, blown away or shaken loose during the
pounding, and probably other things I'll discover later when I go out
in the cold light of the day.

At the moment I wrote this before proofing, dealing with visitors,
going outside to take pictures and discussing reality with Lydia, I
was trying to regain consciousness with a cup of microwaved coffee (no
stove, remember), before I headed into damage assessment and photos
and uploads later today.

This seems to be the best thread in which to insert this...

George Huffman, of "The Dinghy Dock" newsletter, made a post in
Renegades, offering his help as soon as his own vehicular challenges
are resolved...

Hi, George, and onlookers,

It keeps getting better...

The transportation issue isn't yet resolved - but there's a distinct
possibility in the area.

I just got a mail from my surveyor, ex-QC and Service Manager for
Morgan during the entire time of building our boats.

The short story is that if the detabbing is at the bulkhead and the
bulkhead hasn't been compromised with oil products (fuel, oil, etc.),
just wedging it open, flowing in epoxy and then screwing it down will
rebond and, as my wife, and England-raised lady, sez, "Bob's your
uncle!"

I'm going to follow up to see if one *must* screw it back down (vs,
e.g., wedging i.e. are the screws necessary for structural integrity,
or just used to pull it tight?) to make it happen.  If wedging will
suffice, likely we won't have to pull the tanks, minimizing an already
labor intensive project into something far more manageable.

I'm already into project management mode, but Lydia's still in full
depression, as the enormity of the elephant she has to eat is still
too close to analyze.  She doesn't do patience, or methodical long-
term results.  "Lord, give me patience - and I want it *right now!!!*
- funny, but unfortunately true for her generally, let alone under
these circumstances.

Yet, all this will pass, and we'll have the most amazing stories to
tell around the potlucks out in the Caribbean, or to the BoyScouts we
might do charters for on their Extreme Adventure series "Sail the
Keys" once this is all settled.

Not quite Robinson Cruso, or the other which escapes me about the
swiss family, but still entertaining, if you don't have to deal with
the pain of the real possibility of losing your home and every one of
your possessions.

Yet, I'm struck by how fortunate we are in comparison, for example, of
some of the Rita/Katrina/Wilma/Ivan survivors.  We're truly blessed,
including by such as you all.

Love to all of you kind souls, most of whom we don't even know exist,
having never even corresponded, let alone met...

Skip,

Regarding the "pulling it apart and flowing-in epoxy" -- yes, that will work
with certain caveats: How clean is the material on either face which will be
epoxied together? Oil-free is good, of course, but if the two surfaces
pulled cleanly away from each other, leaving little glass on the wood or
wood on the glass, they weren't bonded strongly-enough to begin with. Trying
to rebond them with epoxy won't be very strong, and eventually that joint
will fail again. New epoxy won't form a primary bond with old polyester
resin.

If, in pulling apart, plenty of glass was left in the wood or visa-versa,
then the glue joint was as strong as it could have been. But in either case,
rebonding without mechanical fasteners will be weaker than the original
joint which failed.  You might want to consider, rather than screws through
the glass into the bulkheads, using through-bolted hardwood battens at least
half an inch thick to help spread the load and reinforce that joint. If at
all possible, I would want to laminate those battens into place, making a
"wood-glass-wood-glass-wood" sandwich bolted and epoxied together.

If it were my boat and the joint were structurally important, i'd gain
access to the loose tabbing,  cut away the separated leaf of tabbing, grind
both sides of the joint and lay up new tabbng with epoxy.

I suspect it's like doing glue &amp; nail in woodworking: The nails are
really there only to get a good bond; you could pull them after it's set
up. But you want a really good bond....

Agreement with KLC's assessment on the "cleanness" of the break. Rough
is better, polyester probably your best bet, fortified with something
strong that you can shoot in with, say, a caulk gun.

It does keep sounding better and better.

Just a thought that you might toss around: to get pressure on the
joints, you might intentionally put jackstands at those areas,
intentionally a bit too "tight"; the hull will probably flex outward
afterwards, pulling the bulkheads back in place.

That sounds reasonable if as you say the bond area has not been
contaminated.  If the gap is large, consider "Plexus" a thick gap
filling adhesive widely used in new boat construction.

If the gap is thin, temporarily wedging the tabbing open and pouring
in liberal amounts of epoxy, and temporarily screwing the tabbing back
to the bulkheads will do it.

On our 30' last boat, the survey noted a few instances of de-bonded
tabbing.  In my inexperience, I took an angle grinder and got in
lockers, closets, and under bunks and ground out almost all the
tabbing and re-tabbed with new material.  Lots of work but it didnt'
take that long- about 1 month working most evenings after work.

If you do have to re-tab some areas, use epoxy; the fumes alone from
polyester in close quarters will be unpleasant to say the least.

The outside pics don't seem that bad, and retabbing bulkheads etc.
don't sound that bad, except for the areas of limited access like the
refrigerator.  In those areas where you can get at one side, lots of
tabbing on the one side is nearly as good as both sides and is
probably quite acceptable.

If you think the boat is still worthwhile don't let the insurance
company scrap her on you.   Negotiate, bargain, etc!

Good luck to you,

Evan Gatehouse

Excellent thought. So far what iI can see (pictures, soon, I promise!)
suggests it's already tight, as there's not a gap top/bottom of the
line where it used to be attached.

As to KLC's comment about reinforcement, if I could get to them all
the way, the discussion of shims/wedges wouldn't be necessary.  And,
if I could get to them all the way, I'm enough of a belt and
suspenders man that I'd likely grind it off and put on new, building
up in exactly the same form as original (Pete provided me with the
type of cloth used). I can't see how adding wood over an existing tab,
and then going over it with FG/resin would improve matters; you're
relying on the existing part, and not connecting the new to the

&gt; As to KLC's comment about reinforcement, if I could get to them all
&gt; the way, the discussion of shims/wedges wouldn't be necessary.  And,
&gt; if I could get to them all the way, I'm enough of a belt and
&gt; suspenders man that I'd likely grind it off and put on new, building
&gt; up in exactly the same form as original (Pete provided me with the
&gt; type of cloth used). I can't see how adding wood over an existing tab,
&gt; and then going over it with FG/resin would improve matters; you're
&gt; relying on the existing part, and not connecting the new to the

Skip,

My outline may have left out steps that I have clearly in mind, but didn't
translate into dots on the screen. The way I see it, yes -- you could grind
off all the old tabbing and install it new, but then you would have TWO
secondary/mechanical bonds, rather than the one secondary (tabbing to
bulkhead) and one primary (tabbing to hull, laid-up when the resin was still
fresh and molecularly active.

My method does rely upon glue (epoxy) between the bulkhead and old tabbing,
clamped together with the bolts and battens, all laminated together into one
thick tabbing. Unfortunately, if you don't have the access, you don't have
the access. So now the question becomes, can you ever make it strong enough
without that access?

In addition to using epoxy resin (instead of polyester), I recommend
thickening the resin with chopped glass fibers to improve its
strength.

This is a difficult repair without having full access on at least one
side of the bulkhead.

How could you ever know how strong it was?

You'll never reach 100% new as-built strength. But even if you did by some
chance, you'll never be able to KNOW exactly  how strong the repair is.
You'll have to take her out in progressivly more stressful conditions and
each time there will be that knot in your gut. Will it take 5' seas? 6'
seas? 7' seas pounding for day after day?  Even if it does, you'll not
know if the next wave will be the one. You'll crawl around in the bildge
after each short trip looking for problems that really can't be seen.
This is not what the dream was about.

No, it will never be a Morgan again. Not so that you can trust her just
because there is a long history of Morgans that are built just like her
that have proven themselves countless times. That was why you bought a
Morgan in the first place. The confidence that she'll be able to handle
anything the sea throws at her. That's gone for good now. There will
always be a nagging doubt.  You'll live in fear of every new set of
conditions, only trusting her if conditions are just perfect, and they
never are.  Over time your love for her will turn to hate just from this
nagging mistrust. You'll find more and more excuses to leave her at the
dock. Afraid each and every time you leave a port.

No, even a horse you dearly love should be put down when the time comes.
Do it swiftly and without regrets.

Good luck,

Charlie,

Ignorance I'll always admit to.

But repairing a boat was not the issue.
Restoring your confidence and trust in the boat after a repair like this
was the point.

At what precise moment in time will you be able to declare that it is now
"all fixed" and is "better than it ever was"?
And right up until this magic point in time, how exactly will you feel
about your life on the boat?
Confident and secure, or cautious and worried?
Which way do you want to feel when you sail?
These things would be on my mind if my life was on the line.

We're not talking about fixing a leaky head here.  Nor was this the last
good old boat left in the world.
Go find another with a sound hull and get on with enjoying life.
This whole "get back on the horse" bullshit don't cut it when the horse is
stone cold dead.

BTW, do you fix multiple popped bulkheads often ?
I know, you guarantee all work done or my money &amp; life back right. ;-)

Sweet dreams,
Paul

Of little interest to most, I'm sure, but I, of the curious mind,
wonder:

What, indeed, were the winds out there that night? In the harsh light
of day I see:

The Davis wind indicator has lost one leg entirely, and the tab from
the other.
The hailer horn, newly installed, blew off.
The KISS wind generator, also newly installed, left behind only a
blackened stump and a length of wire.

What sort of speed is required to cause those departures?

Surely, based on experience of those in the know, not enough to blow
us off course, but enough to do some damage, apparently.

I'm sure glad the radar antenna didn't follow the horn mounted below
it - apparently it was more aerodynamic and/or more stoutly
mounted...

Meanwhile, the yard has had its first look; it appears as though - if
they care to bid on it at all - it will be strictly time and
materials.

While they and the insurance company figure out what to do, the yard
bill clicks along at $500 a week just to sit still on the stands.

I'm beginning to consider a tow back to the yard where we were, as, if
this is to be saved, it nearly certainly won't be by the yard here
doing the work - I have little doubt the policy limits would be
exceeded very quickly, and besides, I expect the insurance company
will require firm quotes, which, to protect themselves, the yard will
make astronomical.

Where we were, we can be stored and worked on for less than 1/6 the
yard cost here. If it turns out to be many months, that's many
thousands difference in what will inevitably be out-of-pocket expenses
- which we currently have no concept of how to find.

And, at least up there, we have some "community" having worked on the
boat for the last three years there.

I'm going to make a concerted effort tomorrow, following conversations
with a surveyor who is also a morgan owner, and has recommended
various tradespeople to us, to get individual contractors' opinions
about the method of attack, as well as the anticipated end cost. If it
can possibly be done here, in the parameters of the insurance
coverage, we'll go for it.

If it's way over, but, say, less than double, likely we'll pull it
back to St. Pete, as I am confident we can find competent tradespeople
there at comparable or less cost, but save 5k every three months in
yard bills, money sorely needed to make repairs...

Wish us luck (I know, you already do - we're overwhelmed with support,
for which we are without words, as they're simply inadequate,
including, today, another morgan owner giving us his suburban he no
longer needed, for us to haul the inevitable huge amount of supplies
for our refit)...

Agreement. I replaced our primary bulkhead a few seasons back. It's
stronger, better protected, and prettier than the original, which gave
out after only 30 years. Helps when you get advice from the people who
built the boat.

Some boats are designed and built to be handed down to the grandkids
despite the wear and tear of decades of use and abuse.

That is NUTS!  What the hell kind of shit is this?

Call a boat hauler, talk to someone who has a yard ( not boatyard, just a
yard, yard ) and get the boat hauled over to that yard.

If I lived nearby, I would let you use my yard to get that boat back on its
feet.

You really need to get off your A.. and get that boat out of where it is.

The Keys, especially in the winter are horribly expensive.  They hired
a HS principal for the Marathon HS and he turned the job down because
at the salary they could pay, he couldn't afford housing for his
family.  They charge because they can.  Key's Boatworks is actually
one of the less expensive ones.  It might be cheaper by the month.

In 2003 we paid $18/ft (for the month when you included taxes because
the published rate was $16) for a slip in Marathon which included 2
pumpouts a month and electric was 10 cents/kwh and water was 3 cents a
gallon and there is a minimum monthly charge for both water and
electric.  So the basic slip charge was $900 for the month plus water
and electric.  And that was 3 years ago.

I can't find out what the costs are in the Marathon Boatyard (in Boot
Key Harbor)

Incidentally, we were going to buy a car (a conch cruiser) but all the
upfront costs (they charge extra if you've not registered a car in
Florida before) added so much to the cost that it was cheaper to rent.
Otherwise, we used bikes.  Marathon is pretty flat and easy to ride a
bike in.

&gt; doing the work - I have little doubt the policy limits would be

&gt; Where we were, we can be stored and worked on for less than 1/6 the
&gt; yard cost here. If it turns out to be many months, that's many
&gt; thousands difference in what will inevitably be out-of-pocket expenses
&gt; - which we currently have no concept of how to find.

&gt; And, at least up there, we have some &quot;community&quot; having worked on the
&gt; boat for the last three years there.

Skip,

You should strongly consider having the boat
trucked back to your original yard.  I've got an
acquaintance here in Texas who has a truck and
special trailer for hauling sailboats.  I was
quite surprised how inexpensive it would be to
have our 38' sailboat trucked the three hour drive
from the coast to Austin.  Check around to see who
does it in Florida.

If they are charging you $500/week to sit on the
hard, I'd get that sucker out of there the day
after tomorrow!!

A month of that will pay the trucking costs to get
you back where you were, or to some other yard
that is reasonable.

If you don't want to go back to where you were,
here is a link to other Florida yards.

Truck it out, get it on blocks somewhere
reasonable, and then figure out what else to do.

Good luck,

Don W.

&gt; &gt;&gt;So now the question becomes, can you ever make it strong enough
&gt; &gt;&gt; without that access?

&gt; &gt;How could you ever know how strong it was?

&gt; &gt;You'll never reach 100% new as-built strength. But even if you did by some
&gt; &gt;chance, you'll never be able to KNOW exactly  how strong the repair is.
&gt; &gt;You'll have to take her out in progressivly more stressful conditions and
&gt; &gt;each time there will be that knot in your gut. Will it take 5' seas? 6'
&gt; &gt;seas? 7' seas pounding for day after day?  Even if it does, you'll not
&gt; &gt;know if the next wave will be the one. You'll crawl around in the bildge
&gt; &gt;after each short trip looking for problems that really can't be seen.
&gt; &gt;This is not what the dream was about.

&gt; &gt;No, it will never be a Morgan again. Not so that you can trust her just
&gt; &gt;because there is a long history of Morgans that are built just like her
&gt; &gt;that have proven themselves countless times. That was why you bought a
&gt; &gt;Morgan in the first place. The confidence that she'll be able to handle
&gt; &gt;anything the sea throws at her. That's gone for good now. There will
&gt; &gt;always be a nagging doubt.  You'll live in fear of every new set of
&gt; &gt;conditions, only trusting her if conditions are just perfect, and they
&gt; &gt;never are.  Over time your love for her will turn to hate just from this
&gt; &gt;nagging mistrust. You'll find more and more excuses to leave her at the
&gt; &gt;dock. Afraid each and every time you leave a port.

&gt; &gt;No, even a horse you dearly love should be put down when the time comes.
&gt; &gt;Do it swiftly and without regrets.

&gt; &gt;Good luck,
&gt; &gt;Paul

&gt; Sorry, but that's just plain ignorance talking. The boat could be repaired to be
&gt; stronger than original. I rarely &quot;repair&quot; anything on a boat without making it
&gt; better than it ever was.

No doubt BB... with that cracked smiling C&amp;C design defect you have,
you have to fix it better than it ever was.

I bet every C&amp;C owner on earth would agree with you.
