A minor smattering of this week's conservative news. This edition is brought
to you by the letters D, U, M and B.

1. I don't care what reality is, I knows what my peepers  peeped.
Via _Sadly, No!_ ( http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/7228.html ) ,  conservative
bloggers were up in arms over a supposed Code Pink banner that said  &quot;We
support the murder of the American troops.&quot; It's outrageous! Scandalous!  And...
never happened, of course. It was a year-old photoshop job, and  one that the
photoshopper directly copped to, as well.
But that didn't stop wingnuts from asserting it really, really happened. One
of the commenters from &quot;Gathering of Eagles&quot; (yes, the same group that beat
the  crap out of a father after snatching the picture of his fallen son away
from  him) says forcefully &quot;I was there and hundreds of us saw it.&quot;
Ah, mass hallucinations. That would indeed explain a lot about  Gathering of
Eagles.

2. The Islamo-Fascist menace now has matinee  performances.
Also via _Sadly, No!_ ( http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/7259.html ) ,  on a
roll, ubernut David Horowitz (he of the exposing the insidious plot to  brainwash
our children by teaching them stuff) is promoting  Islamo-Fascism Awareness
Week. According to Horowitz, a photo which  &quot;shows a teenage girl being buried
before being stoned to death for alleged  sexual offenses, will serve as the
poster for the protest Week. The stoning took  place in Iran.&quot;
Only problem? The photo's not from a stoning. It's a still from  a 1994 Dutch
film. The girl depicted is an actress. In a film. A  film.
So the poster for &quot;Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week&quot; is based on a still from a
fictional (foreign!!!) film. And Horowitz is truly a poster child for
something, but it's probably not what he intended. And sorry: nobody ever got an
Oscar for pulling one over on David Horowitz. And Horowitz could not be reached
for comment, as he is out attempting to solicit Bat Boy for donations.

3. Support the troops! But not that one.
Via pretty much everywhere, conservative bloggers and representatives are
very, very up in arms over David Shuster pressing Republican Rep. Marsha
Blackburn for the name of the last soldier killed in her district. But the  person
Shuster named wasn't from her district, they asserted! Liar!  Liberal! Fire
him! Boycott! Tuna Salad! MSNBC general manager Dan Abrams even  forced Shuster
to apologize on air.
You know where this is going, right? Yep. Shuster was right, and the
_wingnuts  were wrong_ ( http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2007/sep/28/e28gotcha/ ) .
So Blackburn got a retraction affirming that  this dead soldier wasn't from
her district at all, when in fact the DOD, the  soldier himself (Pvt. Jeremy
Bohannon, for the record), and the person at whose  home he was staying all had
affirmed otherwise.
Nice going. No, really -- what a class act, that Blackburn. You can tell she
really cares about the troops. And good job, conservative blogs.

4. Yeah, Bill O'Reilly is a liar. He works for Fox. What else  is new?
Bill O'Reilly isn't a conservative blogger, but he certainly plays one on TV.
So it shouldn't exactly be news, at this point, that he lies through his
teeth  even about very provable things. Is it sickness? Is it endemic to
conservatism?  Or does Fox just have absolutely no ethical standards whatsoever,
thereby  elevating the most dishonest and incompetent to the somewhat underwhelming
&quot;pinnacles&quot; of what they roundly insist to be journalism?
The latest flat lie Bill has been caught in, in this whole mess of  &quot;golly
gee, those black people sure are sivilized!&quot; racist drivel, is that he's  been
saying he didn't get a single complaint about that show, despite the big  deal
all the mean, cruel, out-to-get-him actual journalists have been making it
into.
Oh, let's just end this quickly. Yep. He got a complaint. It was on  his
show. He answered the damn call. _It's on  friggin' tape._
( http://mediamatters.org/items/200709280006?f=h_latest )
Good God. This guy is in serious need of an intervention. Perhaps he can go
to whatever clinic it was that fixed up Mark Foley -- I hear they do bang-up
work.

You know, they really should turn being  uncannily, compulsively, comically
wrong into an Olympic sport: I'd put the  abilities of our conservative friends
right up there with the best the world  could offer. We could make it like
Thunderdome, except with more nacho cheese  flavoring. Two lies enter, eight
lies leave.
What's most hilarious is that these people get really, really angry when we
don't take them seriously. Hell, I'd consider not taking them  seriously to be
the kindest possible response.

&quot;When Fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag  and carrying
a cross.&quot; --Sinclair Lewis
