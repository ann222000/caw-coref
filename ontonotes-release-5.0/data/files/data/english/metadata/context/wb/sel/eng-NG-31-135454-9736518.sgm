Hello all!

Here's a printout a user put on my desk:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----
OpenOffice.org requires a Java runtime environment (JRE) to perform
this task. THe selected JRE is defective. Please select another
version or install a new JRE and select it under Tools - Options -
OpenOffice.org - Java.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----

Any idea when and why that would appear?

We are running OpenOffice 2.0/2.1/2.2 on a variety of OpenSuSE 10.x
machines.

Thanks.

Boris.

&gt; Did you by chance try to open a .docx file?  I recently opened a .docx file
&gt; trying several ways of translating it, and got that dialog box.  Then I
&gt; discovered that Novell has a plugin to handle these new .docx documents.

&gt; The next version of OpenOffice will already include the plugin, but if this
&gt; is what you're dealing with, it's pretty easy to find the plugin at Novell.

I don't even know what a .docx file is... No, I doubt the user what
doing that when the problem occured.

But thanks for your help anyways:)

Boris.

Something in 10.3 is preventing Java from working no matter what you do or
which version you install. This is bad.

Has anyone tried it with AppArmor turned off?

Definitely! Personally, I feel that AppArmor and SELinux are both piles of
crap and remind me of programs for Windows that give you a warm and fuzzy
feeling about being more secure. More like a solution looking for a
problem. They only make sense in environments where permissions need to
change a lot for certain executables which sounds more like a server tool
to me. I uninstalled AppArmor completely as well as Beagle related programs
shortly after my 10.3 install. Beagle and the related programs sit there
and thrash your drive constantly while building up index after index in
your home directory. The db in /var with the locate program is plenty for
me.

Now, on the Java issue, I looked and it would appear that it affects GTK
apps more than anything. Java actually DOES work for me in Konqueror. I
found a response here about a fix that should be here very shortly.
