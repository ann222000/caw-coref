Mr. Bush, Put Your Presidency Where Your Mouth Is

Dear President Bush,

So many politicians, respondents, reporters, pundits, and bloggers have
chimed in on your new "Surge" strategy, including yours truly. Just after
your speech on Wednesday night I published my blog articulating my vision of
what will be happening over the next two years [1], the culmination of which
will be the Democrats taking the White House in 2008 after Sen. John
McCain's reputation is further tarnished by being associated with this plan.

Instead of just reaching out to my readers, I'd like to take an opportunity
to reach out to you directly. Here's my message.

Mr. Bush, everyone in this country and abroad knows that you've leveraged
your presidency on your conquest of Iraq. After nearly 4 years of the
initial shock-&amp;-awe and subsequent occupation, after losing over 3,000
American lives, after spending nearly one half trillion dollars we don't
have, and after losing countless hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives,
you've finally admitted that your strategies thus far have failed. However,
you expect us to trust you for yet another ill-advised decision. A decision
which will essentially escalate the conflict in Iraq. A decision which has &amp;
will most assuredly escalate the conflict in America as well.

What are the benchmarks?

I've heard it said so many times that the mission must have a clearly
defined objective. But thus far, all I've really heard of your objective is
to succeed, win, obtain victory, and avoid defeat. When asked of your
definition of success, you've essentially articulated that success entails:

"...a free Iraq [2] which can defend itself [3]..."

So here's what I don't get. Firstly, how are you working towards a "free
Iraq" by essentially declaring Martial Law in Baghdad? Do you really think
that after nearly 4 years of this American occupation, the people of Iraq
are free?

And secondly, the country of Iraq able to defend itself, by definition,
means that if U.S. troops were not there, Iraq's own defense and police
could maintain order. How does sending tens of thousands more troops into
Iraq lead to that country able to defend itself? Seems to me you're making
them more dependent on US.

Mr. Bush, you've hedged your presidency on your conquest of Iraq, and you've
hedged your conquest of Iraq on this escalation of the conflict. As
Commander-In-Chief you've already started the troop build-up, and I'm sure
you'll get the 'surge' you're asking for. At the same time, I'm hoping the
Democratic-controlled Congress will deliver a vote of no-confidence. You and
your right-wing, neo-con shills will be all alone on this.

Impeachment or Resignation - it's up to you

Let's revisit this in November. Let's take a look then at the frequency of
violence, the casualty count, and the ability of Iraq to "govern itself,
sustain itself, and defend itself [4]". Let's take a look at what a
difference this 'surge' decision has made over all the other disastrous
decisions you've put us through.

If by November this situation has not shown signs of improvement, I expect
you to hand in your resignation. Between now and then, I anticipate the
Senate and House of Representatives will be holding all sorts of hearings to
ferret out the origins of this conflict, as well as many other questionable
decisions you've made to subvert the U.S. Constitution.

Some have suggested Congress should cut off funding as a means of ending
this senseless conflict. I'd rather see a regime change.

Sincerely,

Scott Shuster
