The Industrial Revolution is the name given to the massive social,
economic and technological change in 18th century and 19th century
Great Britain. It commenced with the introduction of steam power
(fuelled primarily by coal) and powered automated machinery (primarily
in textile manufacturing). The technological and economic progress of
the Industrial Revolution gained momentum with the introduction of
steam-powered ships, boats and railways. In the 19th Century it spread
throughout Western Europe and North America, eventually impacting the
rest of the world.

Causes
The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complex and remain a topic
for debate, with some historians seeing the Revolution as an outgrowth
of social and institutional changes wrought by the final end of
feudalism in Great Britain following the English Civil War in the 17th
century. The Inclosure movement and the British Agricultural Revolution
made food production more efficient and less labor-intensive, forcing
the surplus population who could no longer find employment in
agriculture into the cities to seek work in the newly developed
factories. The colonial expansion of the 17th century with the
accompanying development of international trade, creation of financial
markets and accumulation of capital is also cited as a set of factors,
as is the scientific revolution of the 17th century.

The presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an
important catalyst of the Industrial Revolution, particularly
explaining why it occurred in Britain. In other nations (e.g. France),
markets were split up by local regions often imposing tolls and tariffs
on goods traded among them. The restructuring of the American domestic
market would trigger the second Industrial Revolution over 100 years
later.

Effects

The application of steam power to the industrial processes of printing
supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing,
which reinforced rising literacy and demands for mass political
participation. Universal white male suffrage was adopted in the United
States, resulting in the election of the popular General Andrew Jackson
in 1828 and the creation of political parties organized for mass
participation in elections. In the United Kingdom, the Reform Act 1832
addressed the concentration of population in districts with almost no
representation in Parliament, expanding the electorate, leading to the
founding of modern political parties and initiating a series of reforms
which would continue into the 20th century. In France, the July
Revolution widened the franchise and established a constitutional
monarchy. Belgium established its independence from the Netherlands, as
a constitutional monarchy, in 1830. Struggles for liberal reforms in
Switzerland's various cantons in the 1830s had mixed results. A further
series of attempts at political reform or revolution would sweep Europe
in 1848, with mixed results, and initiated massive migration to North
America, as well as parts of South America, South Africa, and
Australia. The mass migration of rural families into urban areas saw
the growth of bad living conditions in cities, long work hours with
none of the traditional agricultural breaks (such as after harvest or
in mid winter), and the rise of nationalism in most of Europe.

Textile manufacture
See main article Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution
In the early 18th century, British textile manufacture was based on
wool which was processed by individual artisans, doing the spinning and
weaving on their own premises. This system is called a cottage
industry. Flax and cotton were also used for fine materials, but the
processing was difficult because of the pre-processing needed, and thus
goods in these materials made only a small proportion of the output.

Use of the spinning wheel and hand loom restricted the production
capacity of the industry, but a number of incremental advances
increased productivity to the extent that manufactured cotton goods
became the dominant British export by the early decades of the 19th
century. India was displaced as the premier supplier of cotton goods.

Step by step, individual inventors increased the efficiency of the
individual steps of spinning (carding, twisting and spinning, and
subsequently rolling) so that the supply of yarn fed a weaving industry
that itself was advancing with improvements to shuttles and the loom or
'frame'. The output of an individual labourer increased dramatically,
with the effect that these new machines were seen as a threat to
employment, and early innovators were attacked and their inventions
wrecked. The inventors often failed to exploit their inventions, and
fell on hard times.

To capitalize upon these advances it took a class of entrepreneurs, of
which the most famous is Richard Arkwright. He is credited with a list
of inventions, but these were actually the products of such as Thomas
Highs and John Kay; Arkwright nurtured the inventors, patented the
ideas, financed the initiatives, and protected the machines. He created
the cotton mill which brought the production processes together in a
factory, and he developed the use of power - first horse power, then
water power and finally steam power - which made cotton manufacture a
mechanised industry.

The Second Industrial Revolution

The insatiable demand of the railroads for more durable rail led to the
development of the means to cheaply mass-produce steel. Steel is often
cited as the first of several new areas for industrial mass-production,
which are said to characterize a &quot;Second Industrial Revolution,&quot;
beginning around 1870. This &quot;second&quot; Industrial Revolution gradually
grew to include the chemical industries, petroleum refining and
distribution, electrical industries, and, in the twentieth century, the
automotive industries, and was marked by a transition of technological
leadership from Great Britain to the United States and Germany.
The introduction of hydroelectric power generation in the Alps enabled
the rapid industrialization of coal-starved northern Italy, beginning
in the 1890s. The increasing availability of economic petroleum
products also reduced the relation of coal to the potential for
industrialization.

By the 1890s, industrialization in these areas had created the first
giant industrial corporations with often nearly global international
operations and interests, as companies like U.S. Steel, General
Electric, and Bayer AG joined the railroads on the world's stock
markets and among huge, bureaucratic organizations.
Why Europe?
One question that has been of active interest to historians is why the
Industrial Revolution occurred in Europe and not in other parts of the
world, particularly China. Numerous factors have been suggested
including ecology, government, and culture. Benjamin Elman argues that
China was in a high level equilibrium trap in which the non-industrial
methods were efficient enough to prevent use of industrial methods with
high capital costs. Kenneth Pommeranz, in the Great Divergence, argues
that Europe and China were remarkably similar in 1700, and that the
crucial differences which created the Industrial Revolution in Europe
were sources of coal near manufacturing centres and raw materials such
as food and wood from the New World which allowed Europe to
economically expand in a way that China could not. Indeed, a
combination of all of these factors is possible.

Why Great Britain?
The debate around the concept of the initial startup of the Industrial
Revolution also concerns the thirty to hundred year lead the British
had over the continental European countries and America. Some have
stressed the importance of natural or financial resources the United
Kingdom received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from
the British slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel
industrial investment.
Alternatively, the greater liberalisation of trade from a large
merchant base may have been able to utilise scientific and
technological developments emerging in the UK and elsewhere more
effectively than other states with stronger monarchies, such as China's
Emperors and Russia's Tzars. The UK's extensive exporting cottage
industries also ensured markets were already open for many forms of
early manufactured goods. The nature of conflict in the period resulted
in most British warfare being conducted overseas, reducing the
devastating effects of territorial conquest impacting much of the rest
of Europe.
Another theory believes that Great Britain was able to succeed in the
Industrial Revolution due to its dense population for its small
geographical size, and the availability of natural resources like
copper, tin and coal, giving excellent conditions for the development
and expansion of industry. Furthermore, the stable political situation,
in addition to the greater receptiveness of the society (as compared to
other European countries) are reasons that add to this theory,
enhancing its plausibility.

The &quot;Protestant work ethic&quot;
Another theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of
an entrepreneurial class which believed in progress, technology and
hard work. The existence of this class is often linked to the
Protestant work ethic and the particular status of so-called Dissenter
Protestant sects that had flourished with the English revolution.
Reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law, which followed the
establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in Great
Britain in the Glorious Revolution of 1689, and the emergence of a
stable financial market there based on the management of the National
Debt by the Bank of England, contributed to the capacity for, and
interest in, private financial investment in industrial ventures.

The Dissenters found themselves barred or discouraged from some public
offices when the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership
in the official Anglican church became, once more, an important
advantage. Historians sometimes consider this social factor to be
extremely important, along with the nature of the national economies
involved. While members of these sects were excluded from certain
circles of the government, they were considered as fellow Protestants,
to a limited extent, by many in the middle class, such as traditional
financiers or other businessmen. Given this relative tolerance and the
supply of capital, the natural outlet for the more enterprising members
of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies
created in the wake of the Scientific revolution of the 17th century.

This argument has, on the whole, tended to neglect the fact that
several inventors and entrepreneurs were rational free thinkers or
&quot;Philosophers&quot; typical of a certain class of British intellectuals in
the late 18th century, and were by no means normal church goers or
members of religious sects. Examples of these free thinkers were the
Lunar Society of Birmingham (which flourished from 1765 to 1809). Its
members were exceptional in that they were among the very few who were
conscious that an industrial revolution was then taking place in Great
Britain. They actively worked as a group to encourage it, not least by
investing in it and conducting scientific experiments which led to
innovative products.

The transition to industrialization was not wholly smooth, for in
England the Luddites - workers who saw their livelihoods threatened
- protested against the process and sometimes sabotaged factories.

Industrialization also led to the creation of the factory. One of the
earliest reformers of early factory conditions was Robert Owen. Josiah
Wedgwood was another prominent early industrialist. The factory system
was largely responsible for the rise of the modern city, as workers
migrated into the cities in search of employment in the factories.

Intellectual paradigms
Capitalist
The advent of The Enlightenment provided an intellectual framework
which welcomed the practical application of the growing body of
scientific knowledge - a factor evidenced in the systematic
development of the steam engine, guided by scientific analysis, and the
development of the political and sociological analyses, culminating in
Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations.

Marxism
Karl Marx saw the industrialization process as the logical dialectical
progression of feudal economic modes, necessary for the full
development of capitalism, which he saw as in itself a necessary
precursor to the development of socialism and eventually communism.
According to Marx, industrialization engenders the polarization of
societies into two classes, the bourgeoisie - those who own the means
of production, i.e. the factories and the land, and the much larger
proletariat - the working class who actually perform the labor
necessary to extract something valuable from the means of production.
Marx asserts that the relationship between the two classes is
fundamentally parasitic, insofar as the proletariat are always
undercompensated for the true value of their labor by the bourgeoisie
(according to the labor theory of value), which allows the bourgeoisie
to grow absurdly wealthy through nothing more than the wholesale
exploitation of the proletarians' labor.

Rapid advancements in technology left many skilled workers unemployed,
as one agricultural and manufacturing task after another was
mechanized. The flight of millions of newly unemployed people from
rural areas or small towns to the large cities, and thus the
development of large urban population centers, led to unprecedented
conditions of poverty in the slums that housed workers for the new
factories. At the same time, the bourgeois class, at only a small
fraction of the proletariat's size, became exceedingly wealthy.

Marx says that the industrial proletariat will eventually develop class
consciousness and revolt against the bourgeois, leading to a more
egalitarian socialist and eventually Communist state where the workers
themselves own the means of industrial production. See Marxism.
