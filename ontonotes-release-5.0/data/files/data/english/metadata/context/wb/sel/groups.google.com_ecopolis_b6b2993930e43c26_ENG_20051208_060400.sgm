WORRIES FOR AN ICE AGE WONDER
**********************************************************
The battle to protect one of the world's last great salmon rivers
resonates all the way to the dinner table.

It's almost midnight in the Far North, but the summer sun still
hovers in a peerless glow, and the temperature is unseasonably mild. We
are gathered around a campfire listening to the primordial thunder of
glaciers splintering apart far downriver. Wading barefoot into the
Copper River's Ice Age flow, Glen &quot;Dune&quot; Lankard, an Eyak Indian,
pulls at the strands of a gillnet and harvests a glittering talisman
from the current. With tender respect, he extracts the sockeye salmon,
then whispers a prayer before fileting the fish for dinner and leaving
the remains for hulking brown bears to scavenge.

A salmon's pink flesh, saut√©ed with wild mushrooms and onion, is
Alaska's ambrosia for mortals. &quot;Copper River salmon are a gourmet
delicacy. When you see where they come from, you realize they are the
products of a remarkable place,&quot; Lankard says. &quot;What makes the fish so
full of flavor? I believe the secret to their taste resides in the
midst of all this wildness.&quot;

His words carry a poetic ring, though in his native Eyak tongue his
name Jamachakih translates loosely to mean &quot;The Little Bird That
Screams a Lot and Won't Shut Up.&quot; Lankard is among a group of
American conservationists who refuse to be quiet. As guardians of the
Copper, they are sounding an alarm.

For thousands of years, coastal natives like the Eyak have inhabited
the lands encircling Prince William Sound. Their culture derives from
the sea and the rain forest-a seamless topography that harbors one of
the richest functioning ecosystems left on Earth. From pods of orcas
and humpback whales plying marine kelp forests beneath the swells, to
epic flocks of migratory birds making pit stops in the Copper River
delta, to moose, half-ton grizzlies, and wolves prowling the muskeg and
alder hinters, skyward toward mountain goats and sheep traversing the
lofty crags and bald eagles riding the thermals, this corridor is a
conduit. And the annual return of millions of spawning salmon is its
lifeblood.

Four days earlier, Lankard and I lifted off from an airstrip in
Cordova, a fishing village along the Gulf of Alaska, bound for Chitina,
an Athabascan outpost 90 miles upriver. Our plan was to rendezvous with
three boats of rafters on a weeklong navigation of the Copper at the
height of its sockeye run.

In the air, as we sailed through cloud bellies high above the snaking
river plain, passing over the tallest line of chiseled peaks in coastal
America and juggernauts of ice fields half a mile deep that flared out
like white interstates in all directions, it became clear why the
Copper is a geologic portal into the Pleistocene past. Scientists say
this bioregion, which holds the largest concentration of major glaciers
(five) beyond the polar ice caps and gathers ten rivers that move 38
million acre-feet of water each day, assumes an even more
prominent-and ominous-profile in the modern world: It is a
bellwether in this troubling age of global warming.

Tracing the Copper's 300-mile journey, we began with an aerial view
of its terminus in the sea. The river is a legendary, prodigious
nursery of wild anadromous salmon, but it commands equal distinction
for birders. At its mouth, the river fans across 700,000 acres of
shallow estuary-a stopover for at least 16 million migratory
shorebirds and waterfowl. The biggest continuous wetland along the
Pacific Coast, the delta is home to the entire population of dusky
Canada geese and the largest population of nesting trumpeter swans.

At 17 million acres, the delta sits at the northern end of temperate
rain forest that begins half a continent away in California. The health
of this mixing zone of fresh- and saltwater is linked, experts say, to
everything that lies in the labyrinth above it. The eastern bank of the
Copper straddles the 13.2 million-acre Wrangell-St. Elias National
Park, the largest park in the U.S. Meanwhile, the other side of the
river is girded by more than one million acres owned by the Eyak and
Chugach Alaska Native Corporations and 5.5 million more within our
second largest national forest-Chugach National Forest, which is
arguably the wildest national forest in the U.S. because it has no
roads.

Indeed, there is not a single major highway spanning the length of the
Copper from its origins in the Copper Glacier on the north side of
Mount Wrangell. Yet, history is littered with attempts to tame the
river's rugged heart. As you read this, a new storm of development
proposals are gathering that could transform this watershed forever.

&quot;Native people have a nurturing relationship with the Copper that goes
back thirty-five hundred years. We could lose the sanctity of the river
in a short time if we don't think carefully about what we are doing,&quot;
Lankard says in the Cessna cockpit, pointing to the locations of
looming natural resource battlefronts: a massive coal mine proposed by
Korean investors, millions of acres up for leasing for oil and gas
development, entire hillsides of old-growth forests targeted for
clear-cutting, and riverside venues eyed for construction of a
deepwater port and large tourist hotels that would cater to cruise-ship
passengers and bring hundreds of thousands of visitors into a landscape
with only 5,000 permanent residents.

Lankard is worried. Demonstrating the kind of resolve that inspired
Time magazine to proclaim him a &quot;hero for the planet,&quot; he modestly
insists it is not he who deserves recognition. &quot;Let the river tell its
story,&quot; he says as we begin our descent.

The Eyak Preservation Council (EPC), the grassroots group founded by
Lankard and a few friends, is a ragtag band of conservationists
dedicated to defending the river. They operate on a shoestring, yet
have helped to raise the Copper's profile in Congress and cultivated
key allies in the conservation movement, among them Republican
capitalist Theodore Roosevelt IV (Teddy's great-grandson), Jane
Goodall, Native American activists Winona LaDuke and Sarah James, and
young leaders like famed tree-sitter Julia Butterfly Hill.

The Copper's protectors believe the fight to save this river is as
pivotal as the efforts to spare the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
from oil drilling. Most Americans will never set foot in the Arctic
Refuge, Lankard says, but many will encounter Copper River salmon in a
restaurant or on their dinner table. &quot;Healthy food is the product of
healthy ecosystems,&quot; he explains. &quot;Americans are connected to this
river in ways they don't even realize.&quot;

After landing at Chitina and shoving off into the Copper's milky wash
roaring white with glacial silt, it doesn't take long to grasp the
scientific community's concern. Paddling in a raft next to us is
David Orr, a renowned environmental policy expert from Oberlin College
in Ohio.

At the start of the Bush Administration, Orr and other conservation
biology gurus, along with concerned business people, delivered a white
paper to the White House detailing the most serious environmental
threats of our time. Karl Rove, George W's chief political advisor,
dismissed their concerns about global warming. Orr believes that given
the pace of climate change and the likelihood that it will accelerate
over the next half-century, science will need to have intact ecosystems
that serve as baselines for assessing impacts.

Good information is sorely lacking, and will be vital if humans are to
have a chance of protecting quality of life for people and wildlife,
Orr adds. He has brought along his two grown sons so they can
experience this wildness before it disappears.

The physical character of the Copper is rapidly changing in subtle and
not so subtle ways. In less than 100 years, the legendary Miles Glacier
has receded between four and five miles. Across Alaska, a balmier
climate is imposing greater stress on wildlife. But the double whammy
confronting the Copper is the coming invasion of its rare isolation.

Between two million and three million adult wild Copper River sockeyes
(also known as reds), chinooks (kings), and cohoes (silvers) are
harvested annually, generating millions of dollars in profits and
anchoring the native culture. &quot;Salmon are as important to the Eyaks as
caribou are to the Gwich'in in the Arctic and as buffalo were to
indigenous people on the Great Plains,&quot; Lankard says. &quot;Without
sustaining ourselves on the fish and their unique natural history, we
no longer have our way of relating to nature.&quot;

As part of an expanding network, the Wildlife Conservation Society has
joined a foresighted approach to salmon stewardship that stretches back
decades. At the dawn of the twentieth century, in 1907, President
Theodore Roosevelt created the Chugach National Forest, largely to
safeguard salmon and wildlife habitat. His action, prompted by the
collapse of animal populations in the West due to market hunting and
habitat loss, came in response to development pressures that
foreshadowed today's conflicts.

Wild salmon-once ubiquitous in northern coastal areas but declining
in Russia, Britain, and Scandinavia-are both hardy and fragile. After
hatching in freshwater lakes and streams, fingerlings are flushed to
the open ocean where they spend much of their lives before returning,
full grown, to spawn in their ancestral birthplace.

Every salmon run is different and specially adapted to the terrain. A
fish's homing instinct is a marvel of evolution. Copper River salmon
are prized for their flavor, enhanced by their high oil content. Stout
and hydrodynamic, sockeyes, chinooks, and cohoes are engineered to swim
great distances against the river's strong, cold current. The ability
to detect subtle changes in water temperature and chemistry guides them
back to their natal spawning streams.

Recent studies show that salmon from Alaskan waters contain the lowest
levels of contaminants of the world's seafood. At least 45 U.S.
states have posted warnings for pregnant women and children about
mercury levels in seafood. WCS marine ecologists, who have helped
devise a conservation-friendly menu of healthy, sustainable seafood
choices, recommend Copper River salmon (for more on seafood choices,
log on to  ).

&quot;I get tingles in my spine every time I come down the river,&quot; says
David Titcomb, an oarsman with a long scraggly beard in the style of
blues-rock trio ZZ Top. &quot;Doctors say it takes between seven and ten
days for a person's blood to move completely through the body. I
believe it takes the same amount of time before people begin to feel
the rhythm of this river.&quot;

Titcomb has instructed us to put away our wristwatches. He is proud to
be a Copper River swashbuckler, and is regarded by Lankard as a
&quot;conservation angel&quot; who exudes an inconspicuous presence yet has a
stunning family resume.

A fifth-generation heir to the Weyerhaeuser timber empire, Titcomb grew
up in a privileged life in the Pacific Northwest, netted through the
spoils of logging. &quot;As a kid, we lived in old-growth forests along the
Northwest coast,&quot; he says. &quot;Every time we moved to a new place, an
old-growth forest was there, but every time we left, it was gone.&quot;

Today, less than 10 percent of America's aboriginal forest still
stands outside of Alaska. Titcomb bore witness to rain forests and
giant trees being toppled. He says, &quot;It dawned on me that my family was
responsible for destruction of the environment and of the native
cultures that evolved along with it.&quot; The revelation prompted him to
devote his adult years to landscape protection.

He became smitten with Prince William Sound when he spent nine weeks
paddling there in a kayak. Titcomb and Lankard met in 1989, after the
Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef and spilled 11 million gallons
of crude oil that reached 1,300 miles of shoreline and affected more
than 250,000 wild animals. Lankard, David Grimes (another EPC charter
member and captain of our raft), and marine ecologist Rick Steiner
helped save 700,000 acres of land following the Valdez disaster by
using damage payments imposed upon Exxon to acquire tracts around the
sound.

Today, Titcomb gives generously to keep EPC afloat and helps pay for
Lankard's lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C. He assists in guiding
elected leaders, corporate CEOs, prominent scientists, and interested
citizens down the river. &quot;In the lower 48 we're either fighting to
put fragmented ecosystems back together, or trying to prevent wild
lands, like those in Greater Yellowstone, from unraveling even more,&quot;
he says. &quot;That work is important, but if we want to have any places
left on Earth that are truly wild, we need to protect the ones that
have not been despoiled. We should have learned our lesson with what we
did to the Columbia, once one of the most productive salmon systems in
the world. I challenge anyone to spend a week on the Copper, and tell
me that their perception of nature has not been transformed.&quot;

The Copper corridor has never suffered from a lack of human ambition,
fueled by desires of getting rich. A century ago, when industrialists
extracted huge deposits of copper and other precious metals from the
Kennicott Mine in the mountains above McCarthy, the Copper River
Railroad was built literally across glaciers to ferry out the ore.

Kennicott Mine, controlled by J.P. Morgan and the Guggenheim family,
provided the copper that brought electricity to homes around the globe.
By the 1930s, the mine was played out and the railroad abandoned.
Portions of the dilapidated line are still visible along the river. In
this millennium, engineers aren't looking to resurrect the tracks.
With Alaska Governor Frank Murkowski's encouragement, developers want
to blaze a highway to open the interior to several kinds of resource
extraction and commercial tourism.

The key to the Copper's wild salvation has been its limited access,
says Peter Lavigne, president of the Rivers Foundation of the Americas,
which is trying to restore the badly compromised Columbia and Colorado
River systems. He is one of the many who say stakeholders along the
Copper River should embrace a coordinated watershed approach to
management. A handful of federal and state resource experts, who want
to remain anonymous for fear of losing their jobs, say they are
disturbed not only by pressure to develop the Copper, but also by Bush
Administration efforts to streamline and weaken the environmental
review process for mining.

&quot;If a network of roads is punched into the Copper River backcountry,
then our ability to stop damaging resource development could become
futile,&quot; Lavigne says. &quot;We're afraid that the kinds of natural values
that are now in the Copper and make it globally superlative could fall
like dominoes. Once that kind of destruction starts, it can't be
mitigated because it takes a cumulative toll.&quot;

As an extension of his crusade to bust corporate monopolies, President
Theodore Roosevelt, along with U.S. Forest Service founder Gifford
Pinchot, prevented the Kennicott Company from mining a half-billion-ton
coal deposit near the Bering River, fed by the massive Bagley Ice
Field, which also drains into the Copper. Roosevelt's successor,
President William Howard Taft, fired Pinchot, after Pinchot exposed
corrupt dealings by Interior Secretary Richard Ballinger to give the
coalfield to industry.

For decades, the coal controversy lay dormant. But in the early 1990s,
interest in those seams was renewed by a group of foreign investors
with the Korean Alaska Development Corporation (KADCO), which acquired
the subsurface mineral rights from the Chugach Alaska Native
Corporation. To access the coal, KADCO envisions a gargantuan strip
mine. Three mountaintops would be leveled, and the coal exported to
markets in Asia. And KADCO would like nothing better than to have U.S.
taxpayers foot the bill to construct a road at least part of the way to
its mine.

In his State of the State Address in 2003, Governor Murkowski minced no
words, &quot;Alaska tourism provides countless business opportunities for
thousands of Alaskans. With improved access and new world-class
destinations, our tourism potential is without limits,&quot; he said, also
recognizing the Copper's potential for resource extraction that could
piggyback on roads leading to guest lodges, motels, campgrounds, and
boat landings.

&quot;We should remember that access to Alaska's largest park-the
Wrangell-St. Elias-was built first for mineral exploration, via the
Copper River Railroad. We who enjoy the park today are the
beneficiaries of our pioneer ancestors who had the grit and the
gumption to carve that access out of the wilderness.&quot;

The governor depicted preservationists as elitists who want wild places
all to themselves and do not want to share them with the outside world.
Lankard counters that it is precisely the solitude of the Copper that
makes it special.

The political gamesmanship being played with the Copper is most visible
in a recent debate over wilderness that flew under the radar of most
Americans. In 2002, I visited Dave Gibbons, then Chugach Forest
Supervisor, at his office in Anchorage. We were looking over maps.
Chugach administrators were about to release an updated version of the
ten-year management plan, with recommendations for what part of the
forest should be granted special status as federal wilderness. This
most aggressive classification of federal land protection bars
mechanized intrusion.

Gibbons indicated the eastern side of the Copper River delta and said,
&quot;If any place in the forest deserves wilderness status, this is it.&quot;
Gibbons wasn't expressing his personal opinion; he was reciting
federal statute and reflecting the sentiments of an overwhelming
majority of citizens from Alaska and across America who had submitted
comments as part of the Chugach planning process.

When Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation
Act (ANILCA) a quarter century ago, it again directed the Forest
Service to manage the Copper River delta for &quot;the conservation of fish
and wildlife and their habitat.&quot; The Forest Service received more than
30,000 cards, letters, and faxes supporting wilderness
designation-99.8 percent of them asked for strict safeguarding of the
delta. Yet, within months, Mark Rey, an undersecretary with the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, and Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth
overruled local Chugach officials and declared that no lands would be
designated as wilderness.

Rey, a former timber industry lobbyist and former advisor to Murkowski,
then a U.S. senator, has promoted the idea of logging portions of the
Chugach under the guise of preventing wildfires. He and Murkowski have
been vocal proponents of using federal lands for the full gamut of
natural resource extraction and believe that wilderness designation is
too restrictive.

In response to the decision, five national and local conservation
groups filed an administrative appeal, which the Bush Administration
rejected. In a letter sent on behalf of the groups, Patrick Lavin, the
National Wildlife Federation's expert on Prince William Sound, noted
that three-quarters of the delta is already open to oil and gas
drilling and mining. &quot;The Copper River is a treasure shared by all
Americans. It does not matter whether one fishes for a living or drives
a taxi in New York City, we all have a stake in the way this
spectacular area is managed,&quot; Lavin wrote. &quot;The Forest Service's
abrupt and surprising decision not to recommend any wilderness in the
Delta is a sad departure from the rational proceedings we had come to
expect.&quot;

Lavin noted that the real motivation for denying wilderness status
appears to be the interest that industry has in building a road across
the delta and up the Copper. Roads and the associated bridges,
culverts, soil erosion, and pollution have been the bane of natural
salmon reproduction up and down the Pacific Coast. Of the estimated 244
culverts documented within the Copper watershed, at least 64 percent
block passage of fish and only 4 percent were deemed adequate by the
Alaska Department of Fish and Game.

The Copper River Highway project fits within a pattern of asking U.S.
taxpayers to shell out enormous sums to underwrite Alaska's zeal for
taming the frontier. For every $1 the U.S. Treasury collects from
Alaska in tax receipts, it spends roughly $5, making Alaska the most
heavily subsidized state in the nation-even though Alaska has a
multi-billion-dollar trust fund generated by oil-drilling revenues and
every citizen gets a sizable annual dividend check.

Despite a record federal budget deficit, Governor Murkowski and the
three members of Alaska's congres-sional delegation want to build at
least four new highways-costing billions of dollars-that would have
huge negative implications for wild ecosystems. Taxpayers for Common
Sense, a non-partisan budget watchdog, portrays construction of the
Copper River highway as a public subsidy to private resource extraction
industries that have balked at building and maintaining access roads
themselves. Why? Because the roads are too expensive.

If constructed, the 55-mile road across the delta to the Bering River
Coalfield would also be used by the Chugach Alaska Corporation to log
thousands of acres of slow-growing spruce and hemlock on the rolling
slopes near the mine site. Chugach Corporation also has interest in
opening a gold mine, and has advocated extending the Bering River Road
another 25 miles so that oil drilling can be restarted at the abandoned
village of Katalla.

Wildcatters, including the Anchorage-based Cassandra Energy
Corporation, have eyed Katalla for years. The first oil strike in
Alaska occurred there in the early 1990s. Reportedly, 154,000 barrels
were pumped out of the ground before the town disappeared, after its
refinery burned in 1933.

Lankard says it isn't worth the risk to resurrect oil drilling at
Katalla, though the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is planning
to lease a wide section of the Chugach Forest on the west bank of the
Copper for energy exploration. Bruce Rogers, with the BLM in
Glennallen, says his agency proposes to lease 5.5 million acres for oil
and gas exploration. Yet, he adds, without easy access, few energy
companies are willing to invest in development.

In the wake of the Valdez disaster, oil development along the rim of
Prince William Sound is an especially touchy subject. Promises by
industry to be good stewards are not always met with trust from
commercial fishermen and other local people who suffered economic
losses.

Rogers says that fragmented land ownership means that a coordinated
plan for protecting the watershed will not be easy to implement.
&quot;Climate change is having an incredible effect up here. You cannot deny
it,&quot; he says. &quot;On top of that is the frontier attitude that the kind of
damage caused to ecosystems elsewhere in the world ain't gonna ever
happen here. But such thinking is delusional. I really believe that
promoting the health of anadromous fisheries provides a way for people
to gather around common goals.&quot;

Like federal, state, and private efforts in the lower 48 that have come
together to manage the 20-million-acre Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem,
the same approach is needed with the Copper, says David Orr, along with
the millions of dollars to cover the cost of scientific investigation.

Protection of the drainage is further complicated by the mandates of
the Eyak and Chugach Native Corporations. In Alaska, natural resource
assets found within native homelands are ostensibly managed to deliver
a financial return to tribal members who are the shareholders. There
have been notorious instances in which native corporations liquidated
assets on tribal lands, such as huge tracts of forests through
clear-cut logging. Not only did environmental devastation result from
bad decision-making, but shareholders realized few monetary rewards.
&quot;We've gone from being Indians who found direction through our
traditions to becoming corporate Indians who are losing our
perspective,&quot; Lankard says. &quot;There's a way to create jobs and wealth
and prosperity for Indian people, but sullying the land is not the
answer. You do not lift people out of poverty by impoverishing their
surroundings.&quot;

Guiding us down the last stretches of river is David Grimes, a musical
troubadour, witty Renaissance man, former commercial fisherman, and
part-time whale researcher. Grimes joined the first scientists
responding to the Valdez spill. He watched futilely as the devastating
oil sheen spread southward across Prince William Sound, leaving behind
lingering, wide-ranging consequences for the food chain.

The Valdez disaster was a valuable lesson about the cost of human
hubris and the assurances from the oil industry that a spill would
never happen-and if it did, it would cause minimal harm. Grimes sees
the latest wave of resource development proposals along the Copper
River as tests of whether land managers have learned from past
mistakes.

For Grimes, a lingering icon is the Alyeska pipeline, far upriver
behind us, which traverses the Copper watershed for 150 miles and
carries crude oil-17 percent of the U.S. domestic production-south
from Prudhoe Bay. No one knows, he adds, what would happen if a major
earthquake should shake Alaska and break the pipe, allowing crude to be
flushed into the Copper system. No one knows how pollution from coal
mining or clear-cutting or new highways or thousands of tourists on jet
boats and in helicopters might affect the Copper, its wildlife, and its
water quality.

We enter what Grimes calls &quot;the Big Room,&quot; a colossal open space rimmed
by primeval rock and cleared out by glaciers that pushed through and
melted. On one side of the raft are the Bremner Dunes, a giant mass of
sand that rises up like a slice of the Sahara. On the other is the
confluence of the Bremner and Tasnuna rivers that double the volume of
the Copper. We look downstream toward the arcing sun, and we can see
the curve of the Earth on the water.

Although we are still dozens of miles inland from the ocean, we see the
bobbing heads of seals that have followed the salmon run. At
Abercrombie Rapids, a pinch point of river, dozens of bears gather to
lunch on salmon as seals bark from the eddies. In recent years, the
Chugach Alaska Corporation (CAC) advanced a plan to erect a viewing
tower for aspiring wildlife photographers, who would be ferried on jet
boats upriver from cruise ships anchored on the coast. &quot;[The cruise
ship industry] would like to commodify everything, but they do not live
with their impacts,&quot; Lankard says. &quot;Once you put a price tag on the
experience, the value becomes lost. This place cannot sustain much
population pressure.&quot; As a shareholder in CAC, Lankard recently
acquired a 99-year lease for lands at Abercrombie, but instead of
cashing in, he has retired the idea of raising the bear-viewing tower.

Later, when I speak with Spencer Beebe, president of Ecotrust, he draws
an hourglass. The top part represents the river drainage; the bottom
part, the ocean; and in between, at the pinch points where the sand (or
in this case, salmon) pour through, are the lower stretches of the
Copper, the hub of industrial activity. &quot;If you could pick any place in
the world where it's idiotic to gamble with an irreplaceable river
system and not know what the outcome of development will be, this is
it,&quot; he says. &quot;The state, the federal agencies, and the tribes are
proposing risky development right in the heart of the hourglass, and
they don't have a bloody clue if it will be good or bad for the river
and the salmon. Never have all of the wrong forces been so aligned
against a place so priceless.&quot;

Ecotrust was created in 1991. Its mission is to build Salmon Nation, a
place where people and wild salmon thrive. The group is working with
native communities to help them benefit from what economists call the
&quot;triple bottom line&quot;-sustainable development that imparts economic,
ecological, and social dividends. The developments on the Copper, Beebe
says, threaten to undermine all three.

In 2004, Beebe and Lankard met with KADCO executives in Seoul, South
Korea. Beebe says that most of the board members had no notion of how
sacred or special the Copper River is. &quot;It would be an outrage to
despoil this place for a drivel of coal,&quot; he adds. &quot;The Koreans need to
know that rather than being looked upon as a source of pride, taking
out the coal and leaving behind a mess would be a source of
international shame, not only for them, but for the Americans who are
allowing it to happen.&quot;

In an unblighted realm like this, there is, perhaps, a single landmark
that serves as a reminder of human desires and, paradoxically, the
power of nature to repel its conquerors. Built long ago at a cost of
seven figures, the Million Dollar Bridge is the linchpin in the debate
over access into the Copper. Four decades ago, the bridge was rocked
off kilter and rendered impassable after the infamous earthquake that
struck Alaska on Good Friday in 1964. Damage to the bridge impeded
plans for the Copper River highway. But following years of sitting idle
and millions of dollars recently spent to fix it, the Million Dollar
Bridge has been reopened to vehicular traffic, and conservationists say
it represents a cornerstone of Governor Murkowski's big dream.

Dwarfing Million Dollar Bridge is the blue-green face of Childs
Glacier, which leans precariously over the river. Every so often,
without warning, a piece the size of a small skyscraper breaks away,
causing a mini-tsunami to race across to the other side of the river.
Over the years, people have died during such events.

Paddling beneath the glacier, with no way to proceed but forward, we
pass through its shadow and exit unharmed. Grimes suggests the
Copper's future faces a similar test, though against tougher odds.
Referring to the writings of mystical author Caroline Casey, Grimes
says what's needed is &quot;Jetino,&quot; the powerful magic that comes when
humans confront dangerous times in the world. &quot;This place needs us as
much as we need it,&quot; he says.

Lankard turns to the wisdom of Marie Smith-Jones, the elder leader of
the Eyak tribe who gave him his Indian name and challenged him to live
up to it. Smith-Jones, the last native speaker in her tribe, says the
survival of the Copper and the Eyak way of life are permanently
tethered. &quot;As long as the land remains healthy, the language will be
preserved,&quot; she says. &quot;I also know that you cannot have a wild river if
you don't have its salmon. I have faith that people will recognize
that.&quot;
