It has been interesting to see the xflop fanbitches twitching in their
soiled knickers, going through their typical, and oh-so-old, gyrations
to try to draw attention away from the Warhawk launch in a couple of
weeks. Warhawk looks like it will be defining online multiplayer for
the next several months ahead. Too bad for Gheylo 3 with its extremely
archaic, outdated, has-been pathetic attempt at online MP.  Warhawk
has 2, 3 and 4-way split screen online and offline, the PS3 can be a
Warhawk server in the background, it upscales to 1080i (oh, didn't the
xflop fanbitches keep insisting this was impossible for the PS3?), has
clan support, up to 32 players with virtually no lag on a high speed
connection, world-wide matching, simultaneous US and UK launch, and
gobs of other features. Not only that, it is tons of fun with very,
very positive beta reviews. Oh, and here is just one of many sponsored
Warhawk server clusters located in several places around this planet.

In an effort to try and answer as many questions as I can about
Warhawk, I've compiled this Q&amp;A. Fair warning, it's very long, but I
know a lot of you guys have questions, so I hope this helps!

QUESTION: Is the headset a limited time kinda thing?
ANSWER: Not to my knowledge...it's something that we feel adds a lot of
value to the retail version of the game. But to be honest, this is a
Marketing decision and at the end of the day it will depend on things
like the contract with Jabra, Sales, etc. You know, Marketing stuff.

QUESTION: Who are the top 100 BETA testers?
ANSWER: Ok...you ready for this? Click, CastleKingSide, Catalytic,
Gergination, Aeaas, Merovee, II6FUII-wHaM, Filth_Flannigan,
PlayerBeyond, SolidC213, DBWsGreatOne, Taisch, Hakoom, ROYA, ph8al,

QUESTION: Does the game have Split-Screen Online?
ANSWER: Yes - 2, 3 and 4 way online and off-line. We also provide a
server option that admins can set that controls whether or not players
can be connected via split screen and yet another server admin option
that controls whether or not split-screen players can be on opposing
teams. If you are hosting a competitive game or clan match or
something, you may want to make sure that your players aren't &quot;screen-
hunting&quot;. And yes, these options are available if you host your own
player, dedicated or ranked dedicated server.
QUESTION: Can multiple PSN accounts be logged-in at the same time
during split-screen gameplay?
ANSWER: No...When you engage split-screen, the Warhawk real-time creates
a temporary guest account and adds a little circle with a number
inside it for which player you are. For example, if you jumped in on
my PS3 for split screen action, I'd be &quot;TheGoatAss&quot; and you would be
&quot;(2)TheGoatAss.&quot;

QUESTION: Will there be future downloadable content in the future?
ANSWER: The technology behind Warhawk was designed from the ground up
with expandability in mind - very &quot;data-drive&quot; for those uber-tech
enthusiasts. We have nothing to announce right now but rest assured
that if the player-community wants new content, we'll be develop it!

QUESTION: Does Warhawk support Keyboard or Mouse?
ANSWER: Nope...not for game control anyway, just the keyboard for text
input and stuff like that.

QUESTION: If I run a Warhawk server on my PS3 is it independent of the
SONY servers?
ANSWER: Yes...the only connection that is maintained is for your PSN
buddies, incoming messages, stuff like that. As an interesting bit of
trivia, the first few days of the public BETA we didn't have a single
SONY server running - but it didn't matter because there were soooo
many players hosting their own servers!

QUESTION: Can you play on your PS3 while you host a game server on the
same PS3?
ANSWER: Yes...we call this a &quot;player server&quot; and this mode supports 24-
players *and* up to 4-way split.

QUESTION: If I host my own server, how many players can I support?
ANSWER: Short answer is it depends on your connection speed/bandwidth.
When you choose to host a game or set of games, Warhawk first &quot;pings&quot;
out to what we call bandwidth servers around the globe (which one you
test to depends on which country you live in). Anyhoo, it is at that
point we then do a really quick series of bandwidth tests to determine
how many players you will be able to handle. We spent quite a bit of
time looking at the bandwidth requirements to make sure that the games
that you host are not out of your league with regard to the bandwidth
needed. We got a lot of comments during the BETA about players that
were hosting 24 or 32 player games when they didn't have the bandwidth
to do so ... this resulted in a pretty crappy game experiences
sometimes. Our updated bandwidth requirements should resolve a lot of
this and we'll be monitoring it and changing them if we need to.

QUESTION: Thanks Dylan, but that didn't really answer the questions...
how many players??
ANSWER: Ok, that was a bit of a ramble but it at least lets you know
what's going on behind the scenes. For me at home, I have a standard
cable modem with Comcast and I was hosting 24 player games. If you're
at school (college dorm or something) on a network you'll probably be
hosting up to 32 players ... but the net is what the net is and you all
know how it can change like the weather. If you have a really bad
connection, then you will be hosting 8 or 16 players. Sorry ... we have
to protect the player community from people hosting slow servers that
just piss players off. That said, if you connection is bad, you'll
still be able to *play* in a 24 or 32 player game, just not host one
of that capacity.
QUESTION: How many of the maps support 32 players?
ANSWER: All maps...we worked really hard to make sure that the game
would support the MAX player count in all levels - not just a subset.

QUESTION: I work for an ISP...can we host a Warhawk Server?
ANSWER: Sure...when you setup the server, you can give it your vendor
name and tag it with a server message ... in case you want to
gratuitously promote that &quot;Penetrode's ISP now features 43% more
awesomeness&quot; There is of course a max character length on the server
message so please no manifestos.

QUESTION: Does Warhawk support the XMB buddy list?
ANSWER: OMG...Yes, thank you for asking but you didn't really have to J.
Of course any &quot;buddy&quot; that you have in the XMB, will show up in your
&quot;Warhawk Buddy Page&quot;. From there, you will see if they are online, and
what game they are in. We also added a quick join from the buddy list
so you can instantly hop into any game your buddy is in. Or, you have
the option of linking directly to the stats server from your buddy
list. This way you can always keep tabs on which weapons your friends
are using, which maps they play the most, etc.

QUESTION: Does Warhawk Support Clans?
ANSWER: Yes...you can form a clan, give your clan a prefix tag [4
characters], your clan can have a motto, leader...and yes the leader
must make invites into the clan, you have access to a separate clan
mail/message that can be used to coordinate practices or matches, and
lastly you can use your clan list just like the XMB buddy list to jump
right into their game or retrieve their statistics.

QUESTION: Does the game support more than 1 head set connected to the
same console?
ANSWER: No... you can only bind 1 headset in the XMB and Warhawk uses
whichever headset you have active.

QUESTION: If I buy the retail version, do I have to have the Blu-ray
in my PS3 to run Warhawk?
ANSWER: Yes...&quot;Reluctant Hero&quot; asked about this Wednesday but sorry man...
but hey, one of the many advantages of the BD is that when you power-
up your PS3, you can boot directly into the game.

QUESTION: Can you turn the HUD off?
ANSWER: No ... sorry &quot;MrCamo&quot;.

QUESTION: How is Chaff deployed?
ANSWER: &quot;TTP&quot; asked about a conversation that we had at E3 regarding
chaff. Right now, you must select Chaff from the WeaponCross and then
press L1 to deploy...just like in the BETA. We have toyed around with
changes to this, one of which you and I discussed at the show. Nothing
has been decided though. I will say this, and this came up during some
of our review sessions with the long-lead media, and that is that we
have greatly enhanced the way missile scrubbing and the aerobatics
system works so that Chaff is not primarily used for defending
yourself when in hover mode. When you are in the air, you can now
perform your aerobatics more easily than you could in the beta. So ...
this ends up being the preferred method of defense. Think of chaff as
a get out of jail free card, especially when you are hovering in a
Warhawk.
QUESTION: Does Warhawk support VOIP channels?
ANSWER: Not exactly...I will say the 'subscription' method in Resistance
is pretty **** slick though. What you do get is a per player control
as to whether or not the voice is transmitted from that player - think
of it as a kind of patch board. If you are the leader of a squad with
Bob, Jimmy and Bruce, then you can just patch them in and turn
everyone else off. Additionally, lets say that your

Wow, must chap your ass that everyone is talking about Bioshock... you
know, a game that people can actually play RIGHT NOW.

Don't worry though, I'm sure there will be 1 or 2 days where people
stop talking about Bioshock and Metroid Prime 3 and can squeeze in
word or two about Warhawk before Halo 3 comes out.

Ummm, why, Jackass?  I am getting Bioshock for the PC and will be
playing it in higher rez, faster frame rate, and additional features
for $10 less. Your attention-span challenged dorkiness did see the
topic was about Warhawk?  I always thought you were a total dork the
way you have come across all this time. You judge video game graphics
quality on the basis of a 1930's retro TV, make all of these brain-
dead ignorant assumptions about how 1080p didn't really do anything,
even though you have had it described to you a thousand times, then
one day you actually see 1080p and are totally dumbstruck. Here you
are, approaching 40 and you can't afford even a down payment on a
house and are struggling to make ends meet at the &quot;charity&quot; car lot
you work at and you are supposed to have the slightest inkling of any
credibility? Again, look at the topic line and see the topic is about
Warhawk. Can your dorky little mush brain focus on that? Or are you
just admitting that you are one of those shit-hole xflop fanbitches
that have to change the subject every time they become uncomfortable
with it? Yeah, I thought so, just like I pointed out in my first
sentence of the OP.

It's the same pattern Blig always goes through... he posts a lot of
crap then when things don't pan out (Lair getting delayed because the
early reviews suck, Madden getting killed on the PS3) he starts
posting about the next game that's not out yet. Typical troll

Warhawk... you mean the game that Sony didn't think was good enough to

Considering Halo redefined online multiplayer and has more longevity
that any other multiplayer game on any platform except maybe Half-Life
2, and that Halo 2 was still the number online multiplayer game almost
3 years after its release, I'd say that's a pretty good pedigree.

With your track record, Warhawk will bomb before it even becomes
available.

&gt; In an effort to try and answer as many questions as I can about
&gt; Warhawk, I've compiled this Q&amp;A. Fair warning, it's very long, but I
&gt; know a lot of you guys have questions, so I hope this helps!

&gt; QUESTION: Is the headset a limited time kinda thing?
&gt; ANSWER: Not to my knowledge...it's something that we feel adds a lot of
&gt; value to the retail version of the game. But to be honest, this is a
&gt; Marketing decision and at the end of the day it will depend on things
&gt; like the contract with Jabra, Sales, etc. You know, Marketing stuff.

&gt; QUESTION: Who are the top 100 BETA testers?
&gt; ANSWER: Ok...you ready for this? Click, CastleKingSide, Catalytic,
&gt; Gergination, Aeaas, Merovee, II6FUII-wHaM, Filth_Flannigan,
&gt; PlayerBeyond, SolidC213, DBWsGreatOne, Taisch, Hakoom, ROYA, ph8al,

&gt; PriViTePyLe, sonofa2
&gt; QUESTION: Does the game have Split-Screen Online?
&gt; ANSWER: Yes - 2, 3 and 4 way online and off-line. We also provide a
&gt; server option that admins can set that controls whether or not players
&gt; can be connected via split screen and yet another server admin option
&gt; that controls whether or not split-screen players can be on opposing
&gt; teams. If you are hosting a competitive game or clan match or
&gt; something, you may want to make sure that your players aren't &quot;screen-
&gt; hunting&quot;. And yes, these options are available if you host your own
&gt; player, dedicated or ranked dedicated server.
&gt; QUESTION: Can multiple PSN accounts be logged-in at the same time
&gt; during split-screen gameplay?
&gt; ANSWER: No...When you engage split-screen, the Warhawk real-time creates
&gt; a temporary guest account and adds a little circle with a number
&gt; inside it for which player you are. For example, if you jumped in on
&gt; my PS3 for split screen action, I'd be &quot;TheGoatAss&quot; and you would be
&gt; &quot;(2)TheGoatAss.&quot;

&gt; QUESTION: Will there be future downloadable content in the future?
&gt; ANSWER: The technology behind Warhawk was designed from the ground up
&gt; with expandability in mind - very &quot;data-drive&quot; for those uber-tech
&gt; enthusiasts. We have nothing to announce right now but rest assured
&gt; that if the player-community wants new content, we'll be develop it!

&gt; QUESTION: Does Warhawk support Keyboard or Mouse?
&gt; ANSWER: Nope...not for game control anyway, just the keyboard for text
&gt; input and stuff like that.

&gt; QUESTION: If I run a Warhawk server on my PS3 is it independent of the
&gt; SONY servers?
&gt; ANSWER: Yes...the only connection that is maintained is for your PSN
&gt; buddies, incoming messages, stuff like that. As an interesting bit of
&gt; trivia, the first few days of the public BETA we didn't have a single
&gt; SONY server running - but it didn't matter because there were soooo
&gt; many players hosting their own servers!

&gt; QUESTION: Can you play on your PS3 while you host a game server on the
&gt; same PS3?
&gt; ANSWER: Yes...we call this a &quot;player server&quot; and this mode supports 24-
&gt; players *and* up to 4-way split.

&gt; QUESTION: If I host my own server, how many players can I support?
&gt; ANSWER: Short answer is it depends on your connection speed/bandwidth.
&gt; When you choose to host a game or set of games, Warhawk first &quot;pings&quot;
&gt; out to what we call bandwidth servers around the globe (which one you
&gt; test to depends on which country you live in). Anyhoo, it is at that
&gt; point we then do a really quick series of bandwidth tests to determine
&gt; how many players you will be able to handle. We spent quite a bit of
&gt; time looking at the bandwidth requirements to make sure that the games
&gt; that you host are not out of your league with regard to the bandwidth
&gt; needed. We got a lot of comments during the BETA about players that
&gt; were hosting 24 or 32 player games when they didn't have the bandwidth
&gt; to do so ... this resulted in a pretty crappy game experiences
&gt; sometimes. Our updated bandwidth requirements should resolve a lot of
&gt; this and we'll be monitoring it and changing them if we need to.

&gt; QUESTION: Thanks Dylan, but that didn't really answer the questions...
&gt; how many players??
&gt; ANSWER: Ok, that was a bit of a ramble but it at least lets you know
&gt; what's going on behind the scenes. For me at home, I have a standard
&gt; cable modem with Comcast and I was hosting 24 player games. If you're
&gt; at school (college dorm or something) on a network you'll probably be
&gt; hosting up to 32 players ... but the net is what the net is and you all
&gt; know how it can change like the weather. If you have a really bad
&gt; connection, then you will be hosting 8 or 16 players. Sorry ... we have
&gt; to protect the player community from people hosting slow servers that
&gt; just piss players off. That said, if you connection is bad, you'll
&gt; still be able to *play* in a 24 or 32 player game, just not host one
&gt; of that capacity.
&gt; QUESTION: How many of the maps support 32 players?
&gt; ANSWER: All maps...we worked really hard to make sure that the game
&gt; would support the MAX player count in all levels - not just a subset.

&gt; QUESTION: I work for an ISP...can we host a Warhawk Server?
&gt; ANSWER: Sure...when you setup the server, you can give it your vendor
&gt; name and tag it with a server message ... in case you want to
&gt; gratuitously promote that &quot;Penetrode's ISP now features 43% more
&gt; awesomeness&quot; There is of course a max character length on the server
&gt; message so please no manifestos.

&gt; QUESTION: Does Warhawk support the XMB buddy list?
&gt; ANSWER: OMG...Yes, thank you for asking but you didn't really have to J.
&gt; Of course any &quot;buddy&quot; that you have in the XMB, will show up in your
&gt; &quot;Warhawk Buddy Page&quot;. From there, you will see if they are online, and
&gt; what game they are in. We also added a quick join from the buddy list
&gt; so you can instantly hop into any game your buddy is in. Or, you have
&gt; the option of linking directly to the stats server from your buddy
&gt; list. This way you can always keep tabs on which weapons your friends
&gt; are using, which maps they play the most, etc.

&gt; QUESTION: Does Warhawk Support Clans?
&gt; ANSWER: Yes...you can form a clan, give your clan a prefix tag [4
&gt; characters], your clan can have a motto, leader...and yes the leader
&gt; must make invites into the clan, you have access to a separate clan
&gt; mail/message that can be used to coordinate practices or matches, and
&gt; lastly you can use your clan list just like the XMB buddy list to jump
&gt; right into their game or retrieve their statistics.

&gt; QUESTION: Does the game support more than 1 head set connected to the
&gt; same console?
&gt; ANSWER: No... you can only bind 1 headset in the XMB and Warhawk uses
&gt; whichever headset you have active.

&gt; QUESTION: If I buy the retail version, do I have to have the Blu-ray
&gt; in my PS3 to run Warhawk?
&gt; ANSWER: Yes...&quot;Reluctant Hero&quot; asked about this Wednesday but sorry man...
&gt; but hey, one of the many advantages of the BD is that when you power-
&gt; up your PS3, you can boot directly into the game.

&gt; QUESTION: Can you turn the HUD off?
&gt; ANSWER: No ... sorry &quot;MrCamo&quot;.

&gt; QUESTION: How is Chaff deployed?
&gt; ANSWER: &quot;TTP&quot; asked about a conversation that we had at E3 regarding
