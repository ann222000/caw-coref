From Ynetnews, 5/9/07, by Yaakov Lappin:Former Mossad director : IDF
has wide range of options to tackle QassamsThe IDF must stop responding
defensively to the daily rocket attacks terrorizing Sderot, and take up
an offensive posture, former Mossed chief, and Chairman of the
International Institute for Counter-terrorism (ICT) Shabtai Shavit told
Ynetnews on Wednesday. &quot;The way to deal with this is to talk less about
defense and go towards attack. Without going into details. I can say
with certainty that the IDF has a very wide selection of options to
activate, enabling it to go from a state of defense to attack, where
terrorists will be forced to hide,&quot; Shavit declared........and also
from Ynet news, 5/9/07, by Neta Sela:Former Chief of Staff Yaalon says
Israel should cut off water and electricity, saying it is unacceptable
that a nation supply such things to an enemyFormer IDF Chief of Staff
Moshe Yaalon called Wednesday for increased pressure on Gaza, following
continued rocket fire on Israeli community in the vicinity, noting at
conference for strategic thinking that Israel does not have the ability
to influence the area using soft power.......When asked his opinion of
whether electricity and water should be cut to Gaza in reaction to the
Qassam attacks (a question that arose at a Wednesday cabinet meeting),
Yaalon answered in the affirmative, stating &quot;it's unacceptable that we
are supplying these things to the enemy.&quot;The question is, how is it
that we disengaged from Gaza and are still responsible for its fate?&quot;
he continued. &quot;I fear that this ambiguity is caused by ethical
confusion, as well as a practical misunderstanding of the situation. We
disengaged, but did not. For some reason, the occupation did not end.&quot;
According to Yaalon, if Israel disconnects electricity and water from
Gaza, the finger of blame should be pointed at Hamas. &quot;Hamas, not
Israel, is the one who is causing Palestinians to go without their
daily bread,&quot; he said.......and from Ynet news, 5/9/07, by Ron
Ben-Yishai:Strike Gaza nowOnly wide-scale IDF operation will curb
rocket fire....a large-scale military operation. That is, overtaking
the entire Gaza Strip or large parts of it for a limited time. Such an
operation would allow the IDF to destroy Hamas' existing infrastructure
pertaining to manufacturing the Qassam rockets and its general combat
capabilities.We would also be able, through wide-scale arrests and
interrogations, to create an intelligence infrastructure that would
enable us to quickly hit Qassam cells even after the soldiers leave
Gaza. We would also block smuggling above and below the Philadelphi
Route through a deep-water tunnel that would be dug from the sea to the
Rafah Crossing.Later, we would go in and out of the Gaza Strip again,
utilizing relatively small units, in order to maintain the achievements
of the initial large-scale operation.They're scaredThe advantages of
such an operation are clear: It would not completely curb the rocket
fire, but would significantly minimize the ability to manufacture and
launch rockets and boost the price tag for every rocket attack. Still,
the government is not quick to order the IDF to enter the Strip. Even
the defense minister and army chief are not recommending a large-scale
operation at this time. Why?Barak and Ashkenazi are concerned that
taking over the Gaza Strip or large parts of it would also light the
touchpaper on the northern front and lead Israel into an all-out war on
three fronts before it's ready for such war.They are concerned that an
operation in Gaza would result in the suspension of contacts with
Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and would weaken his status on the
Palestinian street, which is currently being boosted at great
effort.They are also scared of heavy IDF losses at a time when the
country is still licking the wounds of the Second Lebanon War. They
don't want to force the IDF to invest another two divisions in the
Strip – including both regular and reserve forces – for a period of
months, which will exact a high casualty toll. There are also fears
over the fate of abducted IDF soldier Gilad Shalit.Yet mostly, top
security and cabinet officials are concerned about a further blow to
the IDF's image and the State of Israel's deterrent power should the
Qassam fire be renewed during or after the operation.Despite these
considerations, it is completely clear that out of all the options, a
large-scale military operation is the most effective way to minimize
the rocket fire and attacks originating from the Strip. In the long
run, this is also the way to minimize the overall Hamastan threat on
Israel or possibly topple the entire Hamas regime, on all this
entails.Moreover, if it doesn't embark on a large-scale Gaza operation
now, Israel may end up doing it in the near future, but under much
worse conditions. This could happen because of a lethal attack on
Sderot that would force the IDF to embark on such operation hastily,
for example, or because winter weather conditions will disrupt the Air
Force's ability to assist such operation. Also, the international
conditions, during the international peace conference or after it,
would portray Israel as the party attempting to disrupt Washington's
peace efforts.In light of all this, we should start getting the move
underway. First, submit an ultimatum to Hamas that includes an
unequivocal demand to stop immediately the rocket fire on western Negev
communities. Such an ultimatum would also prompt the international
community to act and exert pressure on Iran and Syria, which instruct
Hamas.If the ultimatum is rejected and Qassams continue to fall, the
government should order the IDF to enter the Gaza Strip. The initial
incursion must be undertaken with very large forces and utilize a modus
operandi that would split Hamas' ability to defend against such attack.
Developments in the first few days would determine the operation's
success over time and shorten the IDF's stay in the Strip.
