To Van Hale, the Michael Nifong of Mormondom:

You are an extremely duplicitous individual. I have heard you lie apparently
without blinking an eyelash. ( You say Brigham Young did not say the penalty
under the law of God is death on the spot for mingling with the Black race
of Cain, for instance, that &quot;this will always be so&quot;.) I heard you deny that
Brigham ever said such a thing three or four times to the apostate Dwayne
Anderson, I think his name is on the air. Your evil corruption of doctrine
without blinking an eye, no fear of God at all, belies a shady, beguiling
depravity that is astounding. But what else to expect from Darwinist
situational ethics cultural Mormons in denial with no conscience, but being
a viper?

16 Cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed,
saith the Lord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned before
me, saith the Lord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and
which I commanded them.
17 But those who cry transgression do it because they are the servants of
sin, and are the children of disobedience themselves.
18 And those who swear falsely against my servants, that they might bring
them into bondage and death--
19 Wo unto them; because they have offended my little ones they shall be
severed from the ordinances of mine house.
20 Their basket shall not be full, their houses and their barns shall
perish, and they themselves shall be despised by those that flattered them.
21 They shall not have right to the priesthood, nor their posterity after
them from generation to generation.
22 It had been better for them that a millstone had been hanged about their
necks, and they drowned in the depth of the sea.
23 Wo unto all those that discomfort my people, and drive, and murder, and
testify against them, saith the Lord of Hosts; a generation of vipers shall
not escape the damnation of hell.
24 Behold, mine eyes see and know all their works, and I have in reserve a
swift judgment in the season thereof, for them all;

(D&amp;C 121:16-24)

31 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy [against] the [Holy] Ghost shall not be
forgiven unto men.
32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be
forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be
forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the [world] to come.
33 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree
corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by [his] fruit.
34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for
out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good
things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall
give account thereof in the day of judgment.

(Matt 12:31-36)

Therefore to conclude that the characteristic three second delay due to
satellite when you ask &quot;Do you want to go on the air&quot; and I always say &quot;Yes,
please&quot; and other tell-tale signatures which Mills Crenshaw would pick up on
in an instant, for instance, stretches my credulity. Who else calls in with
a three second or longer delay in responding to your question? But perhaps
you do not have the perspecacity to pick up on this when I call, therefore
if I am in error on this, I am sorry, since I do not mean to judge, only
according to that which is true. But you have a demonstrated lying nature,
and have proven yourself a viper many times, when anyone but a sycophant
calls in. Besides this is nothing but a deflection not dealing with my email
at all, but a vain attempt to capitalize on some character flaw.

Art,

You state, &quot;You started the name-calling and hijacking the microphone by
hectoring and insults.&quot; You can go to my podcast site
(mormonmisc.podbean.com) where the whole program can be heard. You falsely
accused me of orchestrating when I would take your call; that I purposely
kept you on hold for 45 minutes. If you had been some other caller (I did
not know you were on hold) I would have taken the call precisely as I did.
Your accusation was false, and you would not allow me to explain, eventhough
you said you would. Now I must ask you to tell me how I insulted you. What
names did I call you? What threats did I make? I have listened to the
podcast. All I was asking, or demanding was that I be allowed to rebut your
false statement.

If you cannot go to the recording and support you allegation, you might
consider offering your apology for your false allegations, rudeness,
physical threats and name calling.

Van,

Aaron was kind enough to forward to me a copy of your accusations. You
started the name-calling and hijacking the microphone by hectoring and
insults. How am I supposed to behave? Your whole effort has been to deny and
discredit the work in which I am engaged, breathing out wraths and strifes
against the work of the Lord. You say there is no Priesthood outside of the
Church. This is a lie, not historically accurate, not true in the present
tense. We have evidence (testimony) which you cut off whenever stated. And
whenever we would call in with a quote from BH Roberts, for instance, you
would say primarily that he was guilty of speculation (to Aaron when he
first used the quote). When someone quotes you, you say routinely that you
did not say that (whatever the quote is) which are obfuscations and lies.
Then you praised Roberts on another occasion for being a leading light in
Mormonism! This shows a lying and corrupt nature and spirit. Duplicity. I
have a recording of you stating on one occasion that the Twelve are not
apostles! You said this two or three times. Also House of Israel, House of
God, means building of Israel, building of God, according to you!
Outrageous. We are keenly aware of your hypocrisy and unrighteous dominion
regarding your program. You routinely hector and interrupt when you
encounter something that does not agree with the welder's-hood slit-viewed
perspective of cutural Mormonism which is not the Gospel, saith the Lord.
This you regard as your right, believing yourself the arbiter of scholarly
accuracy and truth. You are hardly objective. Here is what the Lord says
concerning cultural Mormons, cultural Baptists, Catholics, cultural Jews,
etc:

100 These are they who say they are some of one and some of another--some of
Christ (and some of Joseph Smith) and some of John, and some of Moses, and
some of Elias, and some of Esaias, and some of Isaiah, and some of Enoch;
101 But received not the gospel, neither the testimony of Jesus, neither the
prophets, neither the everlasting covenant.
102 Last of all, these all are they who will not be gathered with the
saints, to be caught up unto the church of the Firstborn, and received into
the cloud.
103 These are they who are liars, and sorcerers, and adulterers, and
whoremongers, and whosoever loves and makes a lie.
104 These are they who suffer the wrath of God on earth.
105 These are they who suffer the vengeance of eternal fire.
106 These are they who are cast down to hell and suffer the wrath of
Almighty God, until the fulness of times, when Christ shall have subdued all
enemies under his feet, and shall have perfected his work;
107 When he shall deliver up the kingdom, and present it unto the Father,
spotless, saying: I have overcome and have trodden the wine-press alone,
even the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God.
108 Then shall he be crowned with the crown of his glory, to sit on the
throne of his power to reign forever and ever.
109 But behold, and lo, we saw the glory and the inhabitants of the
telestial world, that they were as innumerable as the stars in the firmament
of heaven, or as the sand upon the seashore;
110 And heard the voice of the Lord saying: These all shall bow the knee,
and every tongue shall confess to him who sits upon the throne forever and
ever;
111 For they shall be judged according to their works, and every man shall
receive according to his own works, his own dominion, in the mansions which
are prepared;
112 And they shall be servants of the Most High; but where God and Christ
dwell they cannot come, worlds without end.

(D&amp;C 76:100-112)

The Kingdom of God is a separate organization, presided over by a more
general authority than President of the Church. See
http://www.artbulla.com/zion/Andrus%20Kingdom%20of%20God.html for textual
proof of this. BY wore two hats, as did Joseph. One independent of the voice
of the people (Church) and one dependent. BY was the Lord's anointed
independent of their voice as am I. He was also chosen by the voice of the
Church to be their President, I have not, nor do I claim that office as you
have lied and said.

The Lord says you will go down to hell if you do not repent of your
depravity. You have a false faith which leads you to fight against Zion and
kick against the pricks. You are a beguiling and unstable soul as per the
following:

10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness,
and despise government. Presumptuous [are they], selfwilled, they are not
afraid to speak evil of dignities.
11 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing
accusation against them before the Lord.
12 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak
evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in
their own corruption;
13 And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, [as] they that count it
pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots [they are] and blemishes, sporting
themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;
14 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling
unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed
children:
15 Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way
of Balaam [the son] of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
16 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice
forbad the madness of the prophet.
17 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to
whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.
18 For when they speak great swelling [words] of vanity, they allure through
the lusts of the flesh, [through much] wantonness, those that were clean
escaped from them who live in error.
19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of
corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in
bondage.
20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the
knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled
therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.
21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
righteousness, than, after they have known [it], to turn from the holy
commandment delivered unto them.
22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog [is]
turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing
in the mire.

(2 Pet 2:10-22)

I need to remind you that evil-speaking of the Lord's anointed (not the
President in this case, and there is only one at any one time on the earth
(not the President)) is an unholy and impure practice. But it is the
heritage of the servants of the Lord to condemn any voice that rises against
them in judgment:

17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue
[that] shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This [is] the
heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness [is] of me,
saith the LORD.

(Isa 54:17)

I know that you conspire with others to accuse me of threats. This is a
fabrication. What I said to you was, that if you said those things
(scurrulous attacks, libel, slander, distortions, lies) concerning me to my
face I would give you a boxing lesson. That is what I said. Then you put
words in my mouth that I was challenging you to a duel or a fistfight. More
bitter accusatory fruit from an apostate.

Disclaimer:

&quot;The Wicked Flee When No One Pursueth.&quot; &quot;The world when rejecting true
prophets always compares them with the basest of men&quot;, I continually have
had to fear for my liberty, and life, almost daily because of unreasoning
fear among the disobedient and rebellious (my not always being able to
restrain the Spirit of might) as to my motives, stability and plans, indeed
all of the sons of God have been slain and imprisoned at the hands of the
wicked because of this fear, the most notable being Jesus the Christ, hung
between two thieves, because of his perceived threat to the priestly
hegemony of his day. Therefore I declare hereby, that I pose no threat to
any individual or government but leave you in the great and terrible hands
of Israel's God at the last day for &quot;Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, and
I will repay&quot;. Neither do I harbor any malice or vengeance against any
person or group of persons, or race, nor advocate any overthrow of any
established order or government by force of arms, or otherwise, but I
reserve the right to fight my battles in the name of Jehovah against all
comers, great or small, with truth, diamond truth, which I wield by the pen,
as a sword.

The Lord says this concerning you:

16 Cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed,
saith the Lord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned before
me, saith the Lord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and
which I commanded them.
17 But those who cry transgression do it because they are the servants of
sin, and are the children of disobedience themselves.
18 And those who swear falsely against my servants, that they might bring
them into bondage and death--
19 Wo unto them; because they have offended my little ones they shall be
severed from the ordinances of mine house.
20 Their basket shall not be full, their houses and their barns shall
perish, and they themselves shall be despised by those that flattered them.
21 They shall not have right to the priesthood, nor their posterity after
them from generation to generation.
22 It had been better for them that a millstone had been hanged about their
necks, and they drowned in the depth of the sea.
23 Wo unto all those that discomfort my people, and drive, and murder, and
testify against them, saith the Lord of Hosts; a generation of vipers shall
not escape the damnation of hell.
24 Behold, mine eyes see and know all their works, and I have in reserve a
swift judgment in the season thereof, for them all;
25 For there is a time appointed for every man, according as his works shall
be.

(D&amp;C 121:16-25)

Regarding not praying. The devil teacheth a man not to pray. You should pray
about everything. But you think you are above this, being a Darwinist
scholar and aloof and &quot;above it all&quot;. The Lord says this:

21 And their hearts are corrupt, and full of wickedness and abominations;
and they love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil;
therefore they will not ask of me.

(D&amp;C 10:21)

4 And my vineyard has become corrupted every whit; and there is none which
doeth good save it be a few; and they err in many instances because of
priestcrafts, all having corrupt minds.

(D&amp;C 33:4)

See you at the last day when my tesimony shall be bright against you:

After speaking of authorities in the church or kingdom of God, he (Joseph
Smith) observed that apostles in the primitive age of Christianity were
first made witnesses to all the nations of the earth. They were afterwards
made judges of that same people. Hence the saying of the Apostle, know ye
not that the saints shall judge the world? That is the generation or people
to whom they were sent as witnesses. (See 1st Cor. 6:2,3) Indeed they were
competent to sit in judgment upon them, having had an experimental knowledge
of their course of conduct and barbarous treatment towards the servants of
God that were sent to establish peace among them. Many of whom they did not
only reject, but tortured and slew them in a cruel manner. This was the fate
of the Prophets and Apostles who vainly attempted to restore them from their
wickedness, assuring them, to use the language of the scripture: As you mete
out to others, so shall be it measured to you again. (Times &amp; Seasons, Vol.
6, p. 795-796)

Aaron,

I am not sure what your point is. Art called my program and made a false
statement about how I operate my program. He claimed that I orchestrated it
such that he had to wait for 45 minutes until it was almost time for the
news. He claimed that I did this so that he could not make his point. This
was false. I did not know that he was on hold as a caller and I take my
calls in chronological order. I frequently take a call a few minutes before
the news. It all depends upon how things are going. I do not orchestrate my
program as to what calls I take and when. I tried to explain this to him but
he simply would not allow me to rebut his false allegation. I was not going
to allow him to go on to any other point until he allowed me to comment. He
kept interrupting me and would not let me speak. He is a bully. To prove
that he went on to call me a string of names and challenged me to a fist
fight. I had not insulted him in any way. I was merely insisting on
correcting him. It is all recorded and available on the internet.

You called me and faulted me for not praying to God for confirmation that he
was acting for God. If this helps, I have not prayed and asked God if Osama
Bin Laden is His prophet, and I do not intend to.

You insisted that he was acting for God in his challenge for me to meet him
in a fist fight. In this he was threatening to harm me physically because I
wanted to answer his false allegation. He is an aggressively violent person.
Often threats of physical violence and harm result in the perpetrator
killing his victim. What possible guarantee do you have that if I met him
for this fight, that he would not kill me? Use a little common sense. You
say &quot;Art is not a harm to anyone&quot; and yet you know that he threatened to
harm me with his fists in an act of physical violence. And, yet you defend
him and assert that he was only acting for God. He did in fact threaten my
life in 1987 on the radio. You know nothing of this, and have no basis for
denial. Ask God if I am telling the truth, I doubt that Art will.

Then you turn to a parable of Jesus about a stern king who calls for those
who do not want him to be king to be brought forward and killed. I can not
see how a rational person, in this context, would not see that as a veiled
threat. Either accept Art as king or you will, in harmony with scripture, be
liable to be killed.

You turn for support to Joseph Smith. He was a phyical person with like
passions as other men, as he frequently declared. To demonstrate that there
were occasions when his temper got the best of him is very different than
your claim that Art was only doing what God directed him when he threatened
me with physical violence. JS never made any such absurd defense for those
occasions when his behavior was not becominig of a prophet. Nothing that you
have presented in any way supports your outrageous defense.

Van, this is Art's associate, Aaron. Last Sunday, I called your show and you
were upset because you thought that Art threatened you. First, Art is not a
harm to anyone. He means no threat to you or anyone else. However, you have
provoked the Lord. It has been plainly shown to you the reason is because
you distort the doctrines of Mormonism which confuses the faiths of Mormons
listening to your program. You believe in Darwinism, you believe that the
Bible and Book of Mormon are not true records of history, you doubt the
validity of the Adam God doctrine, you doubt the One Mighty and Strong
doctrine, the literal gathering of Zion, and the giving of revelations in
this present age. In fact, it almost seems like there is little of Mormonism
that you really believe in! Like Art has asked you to, some month ago, you
did not pray about any of these key issues. You're like the typical
sectarian minister, like the Baptist preacher that won't pray about the Book
of Mormon to test its authenticity. I know Art is a true prophet. I have it
by the Holy Spirit and if you will pray about it with a sincere heart, you
will know too. If Joseph Smith were alive today, he would not have been
pleased with you either.

A Fighting Prophet

Joseph Smith was a man of great physical strength. He enjoyed wrestling and
other sports where he could display his strength. Under the date of March
11, 1843, we find this entry in the History of the Church, (vol. 5, p.302).
&quot;In the evening, when pulling sticks, I pulled up Justus A. Morse, the
strongest man in Ramus, with one hand.&quot; Two days later we find this
statement: &quot;Monday, 13. - I wrestled with William Wall, the most expert
wrestler in Ramus, and threw him&quot; (p.302). On June 30, 1843, Joseph Smith
gave a speech in Nauvoo in which he was supposed to have stated:&quot;I feel as
strong as a giant. I pulled sticks with the men coming along, and I pulled
up with one hand the strongest man that could be found. Then two men tried,
but they could not pull me up ...&quot; (p.466).

Mrs. Mary Ettie V. Smith reports in her book Mormonism: Its Rise, Progress,
And Present Condition: &quot;It appears the Prophet Joseph had one day broken the
leg of my brother Howard, wwhile wrestling ... by an unlucky pass, Howard
fell with a broken leg. It was immediately set by the 'Prophet,' ... Howard
to this day claims he experienced no pain of any amount, and believes yet
that Joseph healed it&quot; (p.52).

John D. Lee related that one day Joseph Smith and some of his men were
wrestling. Because it was &quot;the Sabbath day&quot; Sidney Rigdon tried to break it
up. Joseph Smith &quot;dragged him from the ring, bareheaded, and tore Rigdon's
fine pulpit coat from the collar to the waist; then he turned to the men and
said: 'Go in, boys, and have your fun' &quot; (Confessions of John D. Lee,
pp.76-78).

Jedediah M. Grant, a member of the First Presidency under Brigham Young,
recounted a humorous incident:

I am aware that a great many have so much piety in them, that they are like
the Baptist priest who came to see Joseph Smith.... and folding his arms
said, &quot;Is it possible that I now flash my optics upon a man who has
conversed with my Savior?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; says the Prophet, &quot;I don't know but you
do; would not you like to wrestle with me?&quot; That, you see, brought the
priest right on to the thrashing floor, and he turned a summerset right
straight. After he had whirled round a few times, like a duck shot in the
head, he concluded that his piety had been awfully shocked, even to the
centre, and went to the Prophet to learn why he had so shocked his piety
(Journal of Discourses, vol. 3, pp.66-67).

Benjamin F. Johnson recalled how Joseph Smith sometimes lost his temper and
resorted to physical violence: And yet, although so social and even convival
[sic] at times, he would allow no arrogance or undue liberties. Criticisms,
even by his associates, were rarely acceptable. Contradictions would arouse
in him the lion at once. By no one of his fellows would he be superceded. In
the early days at Kirtland, and elsewhere, one or another of his associates
were more than once, for their impudence, helped from the congregation by
his foot.... He soundly thrashed his brother William.... While with him in
such fraternal, social and sometimes convivial moods, we could not then so
fully realize the greatness and majesty of his calling. But since his
martyrdom, it has continued to magnify in our view as the glories of this
last dispensation have more fully unfolded to our comprehension (Letter by
Benjamin F. Johnson, 1903, as printed in Testimony of Joseph Smith's Best
Friend, pp.4-5).

Calvin Stoddard once testified that &quot;Smith then came up and knocked him in
the forehead with his flat hand-the blow knocked him down, when Smith
repeated the blow four or five times, very hard - made him blind - that
Smith afterwards came to him and asked his forgiveness...&quot; (Conflict at
Kirtland, p.132).

Mormon writer Max Parkin quotes Luke Johnson as saying that when a minister
insulted Joseph Smith at Kirtland, Ohio, Smith &quot;boxed his ears with both
hands, and turning his face towards the door, kicked him into the street
...&quot; (Ibid., p.268).

In Joseph Smith's history for the year 1843, we read of two fights which he
had in Nauvoo: &quot;Josiah Butterfield came to my house and insulted me so
outrageously that I kicked him out of the house, across the yard, and into
the street&quot; (History of the Church, vol. 5, p.316).

&quot;Bagby called me a liar, and picked up a stone to throw at me, which so
enraged me that I followed him a few steps, and struck him two or three
times. Esquire Daniel H. Wells stepped between us ... I told the Esquire to
assess the fine for the assault, and I was willing to pay it. He not doing
it, I rode down to Alderman Whitney, stated the circumstances, and he
imposed a fine which I paid ...&quot; (Ibid., p.524).

According to the History of the Church, Joseph Smith admitted that he had
tried to choke Walter Bagby: &quot;I met him, and he gave me some abusive
language, taking up a stone to throw at me: I seized him by the throat to
choke him off&quot; (Ibid., p.531).

The reader will remember also that some material appears in Joseph Smith's
diary that has been suppressed in the History of the Church. Under the dates
January 1 and 2, 1843, Joseph Smith related that he had &quot;whipped&quot; seven men
at once and on another occasion had &quot;whipped&quot; a Baptist minister &quot;till he
begged.&quot;

Brigham Young once made this evaluation of Joseph Smith: &quot;Some may think
that I am rather too severe; but if you had the Prophet Joseph to deal with,
you would think that I am quite mild.... He would not bear the usage I have
borne, and would appear as though he would tear down all the houses in the
city, and tear up trees by the roots, if men conducted to him in the way
they have to me&quot; (Journal of Discourses, vol. 8, pp. 317-18).
