The Saga of Polly Nomial

Once upon a time, pretty Polly Nomial was skipping through a field of
vectors when she came to the edge of a singularly large matrix.  Now
Polly was convergent, and her mother had made it an absolute condition
that she never entered such an array without her brackets on.  But
Polly had changed her variables that morning and had been feeling
particularly badly behaved, she ignored her mothers's condition on the
grounds that it was insufficient, and made her way in among the complex
elements.

Rows and columns enveloped her on all sides.  Tangents approached her
surface.  She grew tensor and tensor.  Quite suddenly, three branches
of a hyperbola touched her at a single point, she oscillated wildly and
lost all sense of directrix.  She tripped over a square root protruding
from the erf, and tumbled headlong down a steep gradient.  When she was
once again in possesion of her variables, she found herself apparently
in a non-euclidean space.  She was being watched, however:  that smooth
operator, Curly Pi, was lurking inner product.  As his eyes devoured
her curvilinear coordinates, a singular expression crossed his face.
Was she convergent?  He wondered.  He decided to integrate improperly
at once.  Hearing an improper fraction behind her, Polly rotated and
saw Curly approaching with his power series extrapolated.  She could
tell at once from his degenerate conic and his dissipative terms that
he was bent to no good.

&quot;Eureka!&quot;  she gasped.

&quot;Ho, ho,&quot; said our operator.  &quot;What a symetric little asymptote you
have.  I bet your angles are just dripping with secs.&quot;

&quot;Stay away from me!&quot;  she said.  &quot;I haven't got my brackets on.&quot;

&quot;Calm yourself, my dear,&quot; he said.  &quot;Your fears are purely imaginary.&quot;

&quot;I, I,&quot; she thought, &quot;Maybe he's not normal..Maybe he's even a
homomorphism.&quot;

&quot;What order are you?&quot;  the brute demanded.

&quot;Seventeen,&quot; she replied.

Curly leered.  &quot;Enough of this idle chatter.  Lets go to a decimal
place I know, and I'll take you to the limit.&quot;

&quot;Never!&quot;  she gasped.

&quot;Arcsinh!!!&quot;  He swore the vilest oath he knew.  Coshing her over the
coefficient with a log until she was powerless, Curly removed her
discontinuities.  He stared at her significant places and began
smoothing out her points of inflection.  Poor Polly.  She could feel
his hand tending towards her asymptotic limit.  The algorithmic method
was now her only hope.  Her convergence would soon be gone forever.

Curly's radius squared itself.  Polly's loci quivered.  He intergrated
by parts.  He intergrated by partial fractions.The complex beast even
went all the way around and did a contour intergration.  Curly went on
operating until he was completely and totally exhausted of all his
primitive roots.

When Polly arrived home that night, her mother noticed that she had
been truncated in several places.  But it was too late to differentiate
now.  Nine transformations later, she went to L'Hopital and generated a
small but pathological function which left zeros and residues all over
the place and drove poor Polly to deviation.

The moral of this story is:  If you want to keep your expressions
convergent, keep them well differentiated from complex operators.
