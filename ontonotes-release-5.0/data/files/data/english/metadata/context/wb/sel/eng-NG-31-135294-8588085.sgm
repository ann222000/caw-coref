I followed the recipe for adding MoinMoin to a controller as a WSGI
callable and, after a little work, have everything working but the
authentication.  I can create accounts but each time I try to log in,
MoinMoin says my password is invalid.  My wiki.py controller looks
exactly like it does in the recipe. Do I have something wrong in my
controller or in my MoinMoin installation?  A point in the right
direction would be appreciated.

There were two places where I had to deviate from the instructions.
I'm new to Pylons so I'm not sure if I handled this correctly but I
had to move the wikiconfig.py file to the root of my project and I had
to change line 11 in the appauth method in the wikiconfig.py file from
username = request.get('auth_username', '') to username =
request.env.get('auth_username', '').

I'm using Pylons 0.9.6rc2 on Windows with Python 2.5.1.

Thanks
