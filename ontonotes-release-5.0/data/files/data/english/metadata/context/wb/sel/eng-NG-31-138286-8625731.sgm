NATIONAL SECRETARY POLITICAL NOTES

Uyabhadla uTerror!

Many organisations, including the YCLSA, COSATU, SACP and the ANC YL
responded to the statements made by ANC National Chairperson, Terror Lekota,
on the singing of certain songs given the epoch that we find ourselves in.

Lekota has since arrogantly refused to apologise and insisted that he
operates and speaks for a collective. What utter garbage. This is not the
same collective that sings Umshini wam in rallies and mass meetings of the
ANC. It is not the same collective that have Umshini wam as their ring
tones. It is not the collective that sings this song in funerals of cadres
who were victims of crime, police brutality or the scourge of HIV/AIDS.

I guess the collective that Lekota refers to is the same collective that he
sits with in smoke-filled cigar bars drinking cognac and making the masses
their laughing stock for being backward.

His initial statement on struggle songs and the subsequent arrogance in his
refusal to apologise says more about him than it says about the people who
sing these revolutionary songs. He displays how he has moved faster than the
masses so much so that he sings a tune that is not in sync with them on what
1994 means. His statements are testimony to what happens when leaders allow
the luxury of power to go to their head and capture their mind, body and
soul.

Through these statements, Lekota has shown how condescending he views the
people who continuously remain on the alert and advance the course of the
National Democratic Revolution. It is also clear that he is part of the crop
that demobilized the people by declaring that we have our freedom, therefore
there is no longer a need to struggle. This has been done with the intention
to keep the people far from governance and from ensuring that our
post-Apartheid society is a better one and of the people instead of it being
what the new leaders wish.

As Marx insists, it is not the being (man) who determines consciousness, but
it is their consciousness which determined whom they are. In the mind of the
Lekota, all is well and he has arrived. Many South Africans, whom because of
this or that, they are still on a daily basis exposed to the Apartheid past
conditions, which have not changed since 1994; they find solace and
revolutionary morale in songs and praises. Therefore, the terrible
conditions that the people find themselves will be in synch with the songs
that they sing, so much so that Lekota will vilify their song and impose a
particular form of thinking and song because these songs do not speak to his
conditions.

What are revolutionary songs?

Under Apartheid, beyond stones and sticks the people were armed with their
revolutionary songs as the spark of hope that guarantees liberations. They
kept the morale high and became the impetus to rekindle the zeal needed. It
is true that each song was developed within the context of the epoch within
which the struggle was fought, and the nature of the struggle that was
engaged into. But this did not mean the negation of the older songs, but an
expression of the development of revolutionary struggles from one phase to
another.

The essence of the struggle was to defeat Capitalism. Therefore the usage of
the armed struggle was a tactic, having abandoned it does not mean the
struggle to defeat Capitalism is over, thus the relevance of the struggle
songs.

Today, a revolutionary song also forms part of our heritage. For the younger
folk like me, they teach the history of struggle, and tell a tale of what
the people went through at different times. On a daily basis we see
struggles by communities for quality service delivery and demanding
accountability of the elected representatives. They sing these songs because
under the Apartheid regime this is what kept them going. Songs such as
Senzeni na keeps the fire going in the community struggle of Khutsong. Songs
such as impimpi siyay' shisa are renditions that bellow when workers are on
strike for wages whilst their fellows are hell-bent on continuing with work.

African songs, including traditional songs, are not individual songs but are
songs of the community and properties of the revolution. Vuyisile Mini
composed a lot of songs, many of which were made popular by the revolution,
and sang by pop stars who acted as revolutionaries in their own right. Nansi
indoda emnyama Verwoerd, for instance, was composed in a particular epoch of
our struggle. It symbolized the nature and form of the struggle at the time
and sought to expose the racial tensions in our country. We remember Mini
for the song, but it serves to remind us of the collective memory and
passion that we share as a nation. Our hatred for Mini, or our indifference
towards his views and perspectives, does not mean that we should castigate
the songs that he composed. Similarly, Umshini wam is not a song by or for
Jacob Zuma. In fact, I have personally seen Lekota on two occasions joining
in chorus when the song was sang, and it was not only led by Zuma. We may
hate the song, but we should not make the mistake of hating the individuals
who sing these songs.

For us, revolutionary songs are also a form of political education. They are
a means on articulating, in simpler forms, what the organisation stands for.
They are also used to articulate who the enemy is, and what it look like.
Some of these songs were used in order to advance the strategies and tactics
within which these enemies will be fought. If we are to forget about our
songs, we might as well forget about our history. And if we are to forget
about our history, we may as well forget about ourselves as a people.

Aluta Continua (not Discontinua)

Lekota belongs to a group of people we referred to as coconuts and snobs who
post 1994 saw anything that was related to the struggle against Apartheid as
a nuisance and nauseating. They see those who continue to chant
revolutionary songs which overthrew the Apartheid regime as primitive and
uncivilized. It all belongs to the dustbin of history. But it also shows the
lack of confidence he has on the stability or fragility of this democracy.
To believe that people may break into his official arms cache and steal
umshini wam to spray bullets randomly is naivety of the highest form.

What Lekota fails to understand is the fact that revolutions are not static,
but are revolving in continuous and complementary circles. This is why
revolutionaries like him may be dented and demented in their revolutionary
perspective, and seizes to become revolutionaries at all, but the revolution
will remain. Lekota has also merely collapsed the entire National Democratic
Revolution into the removal of white minority rule.

The fact that, for instance, we can continue to hunt down those who defended
the unjust system of Apartheid and committed atrocities in defence of this
system shows that 1994 was not merely a date, but part of a process.

In song, sync with the masses, we will continue the revolution. Lekota must
just join the Pop Idols and test his vocal prowess, and let's see what jury
will come out of that. In the mean time, I will await the day when I rise
with (and not from) the rank and file to the moonhoney that the terrible
terror finds himself today, singing non other than Umshini wam. That's the
Bottomline cos the YCL said so!

[&lt;Guest Article: Catro Ngobese&gt;]

In the name of God, Dali must go

The SABC has become an incomprehensible mess since the appointment of
Adv.Dali Mpofu as Group Chief Executive Officer and Dr. Snuki Zikalala as
its Head of News. This pair of juggernauts have trashed on a whole range of
principles that were established to protect the public broadcaster from
political abuse and interference.

Amongst a collection of litanies under their belts includes, loosing the
rights to broadcast PSL matches; withdrawing from the South African National
Editors Forum (SANEF), the controversial canning of President Mbeki's
Documentary, Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka's Women's Day
footage, Off the record briefing attended by a senior political journalist
from SABC in relation to the rape trial verdict of the ANC Deputy President,
and last but not least the banning of a song by Izingane Zuma.

Some of these decisions were obviously taken as a result of the SABC's
political agenda and those in its higher echelons having &quot;(familiarised)
themselves with the chains of bondage, and (you are) preparing your own
limbs to wear them&quot;. There may not have been an instruction, but the action
may have depended on previous instructions to resolve future problems.

The blacklisting of certain senior journalists and political analysts, a
decision apparently directed by Zikalala and was taken forward by some of
the News and Current Affairs programme personnel, is one point in question.
The SABC obviously denied having done this, but the perception that the
scandal left will remain engulfing the SABC for years to come, as an
intolerant broadcaster that was supposed to have covered the body politic of
our society. The decision, whether perceived or real, made the SABC
vulnerable towards accusation of political alignment and factional
allegiance with and within the ruling party.

Immediately after the appointment of Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka as Deputy
President, she went to address a Women's Day rally in KwaZulu Natal. This
occasion was unfortunately distracted by women protestors who expressed
dissatisfaction not towards her appointment, but towards the disappointment
of then incumbent, Jacob Zuma. The fact that this was an unfortunate
incident does not give the SABC the right to disallow the women affected
from having aired their views, whether this contradicted with the editorial
view or not. The event was shown on rival E-news (which has its own bad
habits as a news department).

The fact of the matter here is not whether you agree or condone actions
which are done by a certain section in society, but whether you are able to
express news in a balanced fashion, especially as a public broadcaster. We
may not agree with the battering of the ruling party by the opposition in
parliament. We may not agree with Orlando Pirates loosing 10-0 to FC AK. But
it does not mean that we need to suppress these events as they happen. In
the same vein, the SABC had in 2005 June 16 suppressed a footage where the
Premier of KZN, S'bu Ndebele, was hauled at and had to be escorted out of
the stadium during that year's celebrations. It was embarrassing that again
the rival E-news had the video footage and the SABC had to do a quick job on
it.

Loosing the rights to broadcast PSL soccer matches was a deep blow on the
millions of South Africans whom rely on free to air channels to view soccer
matches. Besides alleged greed and crooking on the part of some of the PSL
negotiators, the Office of the SABC GCEO clearly displayed incompetence and
a lackadaisical approach towards matters that affects the public by an
institution that is owned by the public.

The recent decision by the SABC to withdraw its membership from the South
African National Editors Forum displays the extent within which the SABC has
chosen political loyalties rather than looking into the public interest and
the advancement of the rights of freedom of expression. In as much as we
agree with the judgment that the Sunday Times was wrong in accessing
information that could have been acquired through criminal and illegal
means, but the judgement goes further to express the right for the public to
know. It cannot be the public broadcaster that keeps the public at bay in
terms of information that it should legitimately acquire.

ANC Deputy President Jacob Zuma has always expressed dissatisfaction about
the way in which he has been handled, and how his personal life has been
splashed in the public eye sometime with undue consideration of humane
standards. Did the SABC decided to withdraw from SANEF. No. Instead the SABC
became part of the entire chorus that drummed up the right of the public to
know. There has been so many stories published, so many speeches made, so
many statements made about the conduct of the Minister of Health (both in
her Botswana youth and SA adult days), all that the SABC did was to present
the stories in a sanitized fashion. Does it mean that the personal life of
the Minister of Health is more private than that of the ANC Deputy
President? Does it mean that the SABC has taken sides between the two? Does
it mean that even after SANEF said that they accept the judgement, the SABC
will choose to align itself with their political masters?

There is a thin line between perception and fact. There is even a much finer
line between the tax payer and the tax administrators. The SABC has in most
instance chose to align itself with those who appoint the Board, and
effectively appoint the GCEO and the Group Executives and so on and so on.

They confuse the public with the public purse holders.

We expect that all media institutions should conduct themselves in such a
way that they do not compromise themselves and their credibility, but we
expect that the SABC itself should uphold these principles even more because
it is held in trust by few individuals on behalf of the rest of us. The
tendency to confuse public mandate, the public and those who represent and
are the face of the public should come to an end.

As they say, Freedom of the Press is only limited to those who own one
(Henry Mencken), so what happens in the case of the SABC? The SABC is
ideally owned by the public, and should be controlled by the public.

Cheers SASCO on the Occasion of your 16th Birthday: You have achieved so
much; Yet so young!

The Young Communist League of South Africa wishes to congratulate and salute
the South African Students' Congress (SASCO) on its 16th anniversary, 6
September 2007. The role of SASCO was determined 16 years ago by its
founding fathers to be a revolutionary students resevoir of the mass
democratic movement, and a beacon of hope to the struggling and poor working
class students in institutions of higher learning and further education and
training in our country.

Celebrating the 16th anniversary of SASCO must be about posing questions
around the role that is played by this organisation in the current political
and transformation discourse of our country, particulalry as it relates to
to the advancement and consolidation of the National Democratic Revolution
(NDR) project. SASCO is principly and constitutional commited to the
construction of a society free of exploitation and national oppression&quot;.
Ending exploitation entails ending of private ownership of the means of
production, such that few capitalists do not extract surplus value out of
workers' production.

Born in 1991 as a 'non-racial, non-sexist, democratic, working class
led/biased, and revolutionary&quot; student movement, the South African Students'
Congress was predestined to espouse the true notion of working class biased
and led non-racialism. This was to connect to a continuous and revolutionary
task of advocating for students' aspirations, rights and interests. Distinct
about SASCO was a conscious programme to transform society as a whole
through the National Democratic Revolution, which the Strategic Perspective
on Transformation (SPOT) admits is linked to the emancipation of labour from
exploitation.

The 2007 SACP Red October Campaign will be focusing on the Public Health
system, this will be a very interesting campaing which the YCL will be part
and parcel of. There will also be a lots of rattles and flies in the process
to undermine this revolutionary campaign of the working class and the poor.
The majority of our students in institutions of Higher Learning are in dire
need of an effective, preventive and responsive healthcare system. These
dire needs are a manifestation of the conditions that most students find
themselves in, the scaring HIV/AIDS pandemic that continues to rob us of the
studying youth, the vulnerability to bacterial infections and other related
deseases.

The fact that these realities persist in our institutions, therefore the
struggle continues for SASCO and the YCL for better health facilities in
institutions of higher learning and communities at large.

The YCLSA takes this opportunity to salute SASCO, our ally on this important
occassion. We call on all Young Communists and the students at large to
partake in the celebrations of what was intentioned to be a gigantic student
movement, as part of deepening the unity and relations amongst the
progressive youth formations.

The YCL is part of the struggles towards the provision of Free, Quality and
Compulsory Education as enshrined in the Freedom Charter. This will only
happen if we have a strong student movement and a strong YCLSA, and the
Progressive Youth Alliance (PYA).

The YCLSA is content to be allied to the student movement–whose contribution
to the struggle is engraved in the annals of our liberation history. For us
this occassion we need to use it to celebrate our achievements and reflect
on the new challenges posed the new democratic dispensation.

Cheers SASCO! We wish you a Happy 16th Birthday!
