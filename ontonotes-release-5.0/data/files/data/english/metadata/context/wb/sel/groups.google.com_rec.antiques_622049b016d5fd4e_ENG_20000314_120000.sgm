Hi! Collectors. Sorry, I haven't been on for awhile been painting &amp; restoring
our bathroom.

Talking about houses &amp; baths. You should have seen the look on my face a few
months back when I had the privilage of walking through a old 1933 antique
house.

They had reconstructed alot of it all ready to later stuff like 40s &amp; 50's
cause 30's stuff to restor it around here is very hard to find. I volenteered
on weekends to help fix up &amp; restore these old pieces of history.

The best part was when you walked in each room you could actually picture some
of the old rooms layouts. This house was a 2 story so there were lots of rooms.

Down stairs in the kitchen still had it's old Merit Okieff stove still attached
to the wall. All it needed was a door latch replaced, cleanup &amp; burners blown
out. In one of the far left corners where there was a furnace, you
could still see the stove pipe in the ceiling that lead to a old iron wood
burning stove that use to be there.

The kitchen cupboards are still there with all there glory &amp; the one in the far
right corner still had it's old original lazy susan intacted ready to use.
There was also on the side wall far to the left of the susan cabinet a old
china hutch that that had been built way back. It still intacted &amp; with it's
original paint job &amp; knobs. I wanted it so bad.

Leading off from the kitchen was a long room that almost looked like a hallway
bur when you opened the door it was a long bathroom. Inside I just died &amp; went
to heaven. Right when you open the door was a original pull chain toilet still
in use. Right next to that on the right upper wall was a original metal cabinet
in exceptional condition. Then on the left side of the tiolet was a 4 FT
clawfoot tub still in use. Faucsets &amp; all. Above the tub was a flip out window
on pull henges. You know the old windows that had poles that slid to make them
open &amp; close.

These windows venting system was all through the house over every door way.
Then off shoot from the kitchen &amp; bathroom was a walkway on the other side of
the bath &amp; another door leading to a guess sitting room. You could tell almost
exactly were everything sat by the closer area. Off in the right hand corner of
that guess room there was a closet under a staircase where if you were a child
back then you could hide while play hide &amp; seek. Also there are still the
original coat hooks to hang things. Right next to it on the outside of the
closet was a hook up for a old heater.

The venting system in this house was also original you could walk through every
room and find where someone had covered up the floor vents. I thought I was
seeing things cause they were all covered. Then walked into another room that
shot off from that guess room &amp; the kitchen &amp; found looking for vents a loose
board in that master bedroom a floor vent, actually placed in the floor not the
bottom side of the wall like my grandmother had.

That's when I asked the person who bought it to see the papers on the house. It
was difiniately a 1933 House. I calked it up as early 30s to begin with.

Well, gotta get my kids to school. Will tell you more when I return.

Sincerely Paula PS. Just a oldie but, goodie memory of such a wonderful time in
my antique life to share with all. It's not off topic either. Cause it's 1933
house &amp; everything still left in it is antique. Get ready for more treats
ahead.

Paula, My mother-in-law's house was built around 1935. The rooms are
also small, they did building around the house as the family got
larger(6 kids) but the center of the house is still the original part. I
was
amazed a few years back when we were
knocking out walls to make fewer but larger rooms and saw the studding.
I asked for a tape measure and sure enough REAL 2x4's. They looked huge
in comparison to the shit we get today. I had to measure them cause I
didn't believe anyone when they said they really were 2x4's. They ae
still in the walls, waiting for the next remodeling. Thanks for the
discription of the house you saw, looking forward to more.

Paula,

A house from the 30's can't be considered antique by any stretch of the
imagination.

I live in a very cute 30's bungalow with some original fixtures. It is fun
to look and see what is original, where the original walls were and when
the additions took place and in what order. It's interesting and amusing,
but not antique (even by US standards).

Hi,

Call it a vintage 1930's house! :-)

Considering how easily American's tear down and turn their
architectural history into rubble I would be a little more
appreciative of the fact that a house has lasted for 70 years
especially with its original fittings, appliances etc.

I think we Americans need to adopt the Swedish system of &quot;K&quot; culturally
marking buildings or houses so that we can preserve more of
what we have left. I was about to join an organization in the
USA that gathered funds for preservation of old sites and houses
but it wasn't clear if the money was going to private owners of
the real estate or to government owned property. And they didn't
seem to have any rules about what can be changed or what can't
be changed.

I just recently visited the American Ambassador to Sweden's residence
and his wife was restoring the 1930's house that was the ambassadors
residence. I saw many pictures from before the restoration and the
house was run down and looked like no one had painted or touched it
for 70 years. The kitchen hadn't been restored and it looked really
bad, not at all like the residence of an American ambassador overseas.
Parts of it looked filthy and torn and not taken care of. I really do
believe
that our ambassador got the worst choice of houses compared to that of
other ambassadors. But I am glad that despite the relatively young age
of the house that one ambassadors wife is finally taking the time to
care for it and she is really turning it into a respectable looking
residence. She is even writing a book about the history of the house.
I doubt her book will be truly appreciated until 30 more years or so
have passed but at least she documented some of the houses history
otherwise much os this knowledge would have been lost. What she is
doing can only be a positive thing.

I have friends who just bought an 18th century farm with house, guest
house and barn in Dalarna Sweden and their getting ready to fix it up
and take off the wallpaper that is presently on the walls because there
is supposed to be original folk painted walls underneath the layers of
wallpaper. They want it to be as original as possible.

So I think the moral of this story is whether a house if 70 or 200
years old it deserves being cared for and respected.

Regards,

Kathleen

are just old house.

Then our government calls buildings that are original &amp; still stand in use land
marks.

But, we are on a re.antique newsgroup are we not.

We are decuss things as 50 years old or older. You all have said you consider
something a antqiue at 50 to decuss.

Well, this one is 70 years old &amp; my grandfather lived in a house like this and
he also called it a antique.

Now, let's get back to the house &amp; it's wonders. Not decussing it's name or
years.
It's old okay!

"/> The 2 rooms I was sharing. The guess bedroom &amp; the master are link to each
other.

The master bedroom has a arch area but, no other beams or structures in the way
leading to the other room.

Now on the left hand side of the master bedroom wall at the far end there is a
small wall about less then 5 foot &amp; in that corner there is toilet plumbing
were a old toilet stood. Plumbing were a very small sink use to be. The out
lines of where they were are still imbedded into the wall, plus old wallpaper
still stuck to the wall area. It was z yellow rose flower print of some sort.
It probably looked great in it's day. But, now it's faded &amp; turning yellow.

There is also a small child's like metal towel bar still attached in it's
rightful place on the wall not to far up the wall either.

That towel bar came to my waste &amp; I'm only 5 foot 7 inches. Looks like a child
could reach it. Also walking backwards about 10 steps there was a door that had
it's old knob &amp; locks still on it.

I used tools to open this one cause it was very struck. Looked like it hadn't
been open in years. To my surprise when opened. It dhot off to 2 ajoining
rooms. The first room wash like a wash center. You could also get to this room
from the back door &amp; porch area.

The room still held the old medicine cabinet. Pinted yellow with it's mirror
still intacted. A nice original sink with light blue tiles not a piece missing.

wood floor were in great shape in this area for their age. The walls also had
the old wallpaer stuck to them but, in alot better condition. That's when I
thought WOW that was a nice wallpaper back them.

This one wall with the medicine cabinet also held other shelves that had not
been touched. A little cupbroard that still had a old man's razor sitting in
it.

That's when my mind wondered if this area wasn't where after a hard days work,
the husband parked his car at the back street came in throught the back door to
take off shoes &amp; wash up instead of coming through the front &amp; messing up a
clean house with dirt from work.

Cause here why, I told you this had to a jointinh rooms. The 2 room was a bath.
It had the pull chain toilet still in great shape &amp; use. I flushed it to make
sure. Man! Those old tiolets made a rucus when you flush them don't they.

The tub was another clawfoot 4 foot tub in eceptional condition. Old towel
racks &amp; here's the kicker. All th tiles were still on the floor in there in
great shape. Wallpaper &amp; all. The whole bathroom was just a sight to see. I
jsut wanted to pick the whole thing up &amp; bring it home as was.

Now, you walk back through that bathroom, back out to the wash room &amp; round a
corner to a hallway then you could see into the other bathroom I described
earlier with the flip up window, then keep walking &amp; your back in the guess
bedroom or sitting room, turn &amp; there's the master bedroom.

Now, shot off from the master bedrrom was a original door, room whoich I
beleive was the front living room. You could see the old fire place in it's
usable glory. Red brick with a original pull screne that still had those nut
shaped pull knobs on them.

Over the fire place was the original mantel made of marbel stone that had a big
crack going from one corner to the other &amp; a small chip off one of the corners
but, tugging on it still strong as a stone piece should be.

Walking throught the living room you could picture or at least I could a big
over stuffed chair where the husband sat smoking his pipe &amp; reading his
newpaper after a hard days work &amp; afetr supper. dishes were done and kids all
in bed. I pictured where the wif's rocking chair would have sat in that room.
Then it dawned on me to look at the wood floor closer.

There angled not to close but not to far from the fire place was rocking chair
marks indented in the wood floor. Then went to the other side of the fireplace
&amp; looked at the floor, there were indents of a chair and also the best inprint
of a chairs long foot.

Well, collect got to get my daughter from school, more to come.

Paula PS. Remebr I still have the front room &amp; upstairs to share.

Honest Ronnie....you CAN believe it.....in this day of prefab homes, nearly
ANYTHING over fifty years old, and permanently attached to the ground, is
considered an antique.....I, myself, live in a 100 year old house, (built in
January 1900) called a &quot;vintage&quot; antique......which is a fancy way of
saying, &quot;an old fixer-upper&quot;. Unfortunately, one of the three people who
helped build my house had NO IDEA what a square or level was......(for
guest's amusement, we have been know to show how a marble can seemingly roll
uphill in the kitchen)....and then there was that disaster in the back of
the house when my husband temporarily forgot where we lived and actually
leveled the siding we were putting on....we now have a small section of
siding that looks like it's running downhill.....
So believe it honey!!!

My 1894 house (the front rooms, anyway, before the several additions
over the years) may have had some work done by the Three Stooges, also.
We set out to repair the front porch roof, a rather odd curved roof
line. As we got into it, it was clear it had to be torn off and rebuilt
from scratch. The curve was apparently created by someone hacking away
with an axe, and not very carefully, at that.

On the other hand, we have a new old structure added to the lot. The
church next door decided to build a new youth hall and gym. The old 24
by 28 foot circa 1915 Sunday school building (used as a Boy Scout hit
the past 50 years) had to go. We bought it for $1,500 and had it moved
across the line for another $2,500. God knows what it would cost to
have this thing built today, even if you could get the kind and quality
of woods used in it. The space is divided into two rooms by a pull-down
wall (ala roll-top desk) that still works as smoothly as when it was
new. They put a tremendous amount of trim work into it and 15 windows.
The deteriorated linoleum fortunately was laid with water-soluble
adhesive, so the never-walked-on 4 inch long-leaf pine floors will now
be the floor. Wonderfully built. We quickly found that we need only
measure one part of any opening, as they are all perfectly square. It's
a gem, about 3/4 restored now, and I wouldn't take for it.

Have to get some photos up one day, along with the newly restored
courthouse they're just finishing up with.

And no, Ronnie, around this part of the country I've never heard anyone
refer to an &quot;antique&quot; house. But then, it's been far less than
two-hundred years since were were part of the Mexican State of Cohuilla
and Texas, and there weren't that many houses then and few left of them
today.

In my northern area homes are not referred to as an &quot;antique&quot; house. They
are usually called historical, turn of the century, Victorian, Arts &amp; Crafts
era, or whatever architectural style it is. A house built in the 1930's
would not be considered vintage. Those terms do not apply to real estate
that I know of.

That's 2 inches x 4 inches! It was the standard measurements in the US.
Thank goodness we haven't been corrupted into metric yet! These days a

When we were shown anything after the turn of the century I don't believe it
was ever referred to as &quot;antique.&quot;
Some of the homes we saw were on the Historic register and could not be
altered in any significant way. Others were decidedly decrepid so I suppose
their age alone qualified them as &quot;antique.&quot; One house that I particularly
liked had seven fireplaces (one in each of the rooms!) and had a marker in the
front to show it was designated as historic and you could have a tour of it if
you called ahead. My husband got a good laugh thinking of me dressed up in
colonial clothing and giving tours of my home.
Currently my shop windows face an Historic courthouse (dated 1756, I
believe). There was another courthouse on that spot before a fire wiped out
the town.
See ya!

&gt; and Bristol in the West.

&gt; I think that the survival of these buildings is mostly thanks to the

&gt; Living here, you tend not to notice that the buildings are particularly

&gt;Subject: Re: 1933 House I help restore. Good Golden oldie to decuss.

"/> Okay! Let's nip this opinion in the house it belongs in.

There are so many opinions on what a antique is.

In some countries it has to be this or has to be that.

The word antique is use in varies ways by everyone in very race &amp; country.

But, like I said in another post this is what my grandfather taught me.

Antique is any thing that is over 100 years of age. This house is 70 years old.
Okay it's old.

Vintage is a object or building for that matter that is over 100 or more years
&amp; has all it's originality to it.

So, this house is old cause it's not 100 let alot some of it's original
fixtures &amp; items had been removed like the wood or coal burning potbellied
stove.

Okay! Collectors. I didn't want to get into a debate over what year, age or
whether or not it was a antique or vintage house.

Just wanted to share a part of what my eyes got to have the privilage of
seeing.

My feet got the privilage of walking on in years since my grandfathers old
house.

My hands got the privilage or working on &amp; restoring such a beutiful piece of
history.

That's all please let's not argue over who's right on something &amp; who's wrong.
Who cares.

I made this post to enjoy. Also to decuss all the wonders of the place. Like
answering qustions on what I might have also seen but, forgot to put in this
post. Like light fixtures, what ever you can think of in a old house better
then I can I might have forgotten.

Now, remember I worked on this house 6 months ago. So, it might take time to
remember alot of things. But, doing my best to put them into what I remeber of
the place.

I'm thinking about going around to other houses sometime to help other people
put there old homes back together, just for the enjoyment of seeing these
beautiful pieces of past history.

There are lot around Texas that people don't even realize are there. My husband
drives by alot of them everyday. That are either being destroyed by company's
for the land to build new build's on.

Board up to be destroyed or have homeless people living in them &amp; the city
wants them destroyed to to the fact they are living in them. That's pretty sad.

These beauiful pieces of History can be saved by the right people. The Lady I
worked with bought several of these old homes to restore, and is given
homeless, mentally ill, and people that have lost there jobs to get back on
there feet a place to live until they can make it.

Our people &amp; government don't realize that it's not only cost saving to restor
these places but, helpful to others in the long run.

That's what this woman has done. She has 7 going on buying another one. Take
time &amp; lots of patients to make these old houses useful again.

I worked on 5 out of the seven for 30 weekends to see them finished along with
lots of other volenteers. This is the gift I have been given since doing so.
Sharing what I have seen &amp; done to help these historcial pieces live again &amp;
knowing I've help someone off the streets in the long run.

So, let's not get into a what's what match. Just read, enjoy &amp; ask about the
house if I can answer anything.

Paula PS. Words are just words no matter how there used, wheather right or
wrong. You have your way I have mine. Let it go at that. Now, back to the house
fun.

"/> Doris is right on one aspect you can find treasures inside these old houses.

I pulled a few nice blown glass pieces out of some wals at the house we were
working on. But, since we were volenteers we didn't keep anything.

That was didhonest. Man! 2 of the glown glass pieces where wrapped in dress
cloth &amp; prserved for heaven only knows how long. Just beautiful.

They were blown glass perfume bottles in a child's bedroom wall that had been
cut to hide all kinds of treasures of there childhood. A glass doll made of
blown glass. Green type tint. The hands, feet &amp; body of it were just perfect.
Her head can off like a stopper for putting liquid in. I would have loved to
brought it home.

In the kitchen wall that was damaged there was a dinner set I think we counted
at least 50 pieces all matching. Metlock was on the bottom of every piece, off
white color &amp; no design what so ever. But out of very piece there was only one
coffeecup that had a slit crack in it. Then when all was pulled out &amp; checked
for anything more we started reconstructing the wall with it's original
materials that were still salvagable.

Turned out pretty good. Found some old mags &amp; books under the stair case shoved
way to the back. Lady's home journel &amp; something called zippy's news. Never
heard of it.

When I can remember all me &amp; 2 others working beside me found, I'll share
those. Okay.

Ronnie might have been pondering the 12 inch x 18
inch oak beams he's probably got in his 18th
Century &quot;hovel&quot; (Anglo-Saxon for a peasant's hut,
I believe).

There is a serious side to your comments because
there is a difference between sawn and planed
dimensions. Timber is always costed on sawn
dimensions e.g. 2 x 4, but up to one-eighth of an
inch is lost ON EACH SIDE as it is planed so your
2 x 4 becomes 1 3/4 x 3 3/4 inches. Sometimes
significant, if tolerances and measurements are
critical.

Most construction work uses sawn timber. It also
is frequently seen on the backs or underneath
early furniture - never on later factory-made
reproductions.

We could get into a discussion about the finer
points of dating old furniture by noting the
different sorts or saw marks, use of the adze,
scribing lines, thickness and type of timbers and
veneers, etc

But if Ronnie &quot;plunges&quot; in (modern routers are
out, plough planes are in) please change the
thread to &quot;Timber!!!!Tools!!!Timing&quot;

Build on your knowledge. Have fun.

&gt;&quot;antique&quot; house. Please see:
&gt; http://members.aol.com/esengo/private/antiquehouse.jpg

&gt; And since we're talking about real estate. Newspaper also states that our good
&gt; and dear friend, Martha Stewart, has purchased a little estate (137 acres) here
&gt; for about 15 million. HOOboy! Am I ever glad I've stood up for her all
&gt; these years. Nice to get along with your neighbors.
&gt; Anyhow, the estate consists of 137 acres of the most beautiful land in
&gt; the area. The summerhouse was built in 1764, is a 3,236 squ. foot colonial
&gt; with chestnut floors and six fireplaces. The winter house was built the same
&gt; year and has farmer's quarters. The cottage was built in 1897 (1,496 sq.
&gt; feet), and there is a 2,400 ft. contemporary on the property.

&gt;Oh come off it!! .. nobody really refers to their house as &quot;antique&quot;

"/> Guess some of us do - real estate agents, those trying to increase the
cachet of merely being &quot;old&quot; (even if it's a house from the early 1900's),
or those with a different idea of what classifies an antique.

Antiques go in the house, on the house, or around the house. The house
itself isn't an antique. Even a house with historical significance (my
1930's house has absolutely NO historical significance, my grandfathers 1940
Ranch Style home (with original sales contract) doesn't even have
archictecural merit) isn't an antique. It might have antiques in it though.

There is a serious side to your comments because there is a difference
between sawn and planed dimensions. Timber is always costed on sawn
dimensions e.g. 2 x 4, but up to one-eighth of an inch is lost ON EACH
SIDE as it is planed so your 2 x 4 becomes 1 3/4 x 3 3/4 inches.
Sometimes significant, if tolerances and measurements are critical.
&lt;snip&gt;

Roy , I'd love to find a 2&quot;x4&quot; that measured that big. Take another
1/4&quot; off
each measurement and you'll have our standard. I was told by a lumber
man
the reason is they now start with 2x4 and then plane to get all the bark
off. Yeah
I haven't seen bark on my lumber in almost 2 weeks. they do it to get
more board feet out of the same log, Duh!
And it's no different for 1x12 or anything else EXCEPT 5/4 this is not
too much smaller. Each year when you buy lumber here it can be a whole
new experience.

"/> It's not dead where I live..... Country is the poor man's antiques. Out in
the rural northern US people decorate with all kinds of country furnishings
mixed with antiques. Almost an electic mix and match if you will, some of it
works and some doesn't..lol The longer you collect , or the more money you
have , the more high end you pay to furnish. They buy the large furniture
pieces and then change the accessories as the country fad changes. Folk Art
is big with many right now.
Country pine and golden oak seem to be affordable for most country style
amatuer decorators. Victorian style is a diehard for some, although it's
slowing dying in my rural area.....too fru fru and ornate. Arts and crafts
style is now hot, hot, although not appealing to everyone. The minute a
piece comes into the antique shops it's sold. Shaker is another simple look
for many homes out here.
I know you'll get a broad outlook across the states. I'll be interested to
see what the others say about the style in the cities.

Actually Doris, I'm so glad you brought this up...When we decided to put in
new windows, (we thought it would be a novel idea if, when the wind blew, it
didn't blow stuff off the walls on the INSIDE of the house), we found the
walls stuffed with old, 1904 newspapers. One of the stories was about Joseph
Smith Jr....the son of the original founder of the Church of Latter Day
Saints.....coming to lecture at the &quot;new&quot; Whitman College. Another was the
story of a ....ahem....lady, who had gone to Alaska, made her fortune, (I'm
guessing she was a...um....waitress?), took a lover, threw him over....took
another lover and sailed away to Seattle with him. First lover tracked them
down to a hotel and (I'm quoting) &quot;In a fit of jealous pique&quot; tried to shoot
the pair!! But after five shots, the pair overpowered him, took his gun and
pistol-whipped him. All it told, in the most breathless of terms.
In another wall, we found some ice ration cards from WW1, (who knew ice was
rationed?), a set of silver scissors from a ladies sewing basket, and a set
of ice tongs, (for the purloined ice, I guess, but why would they hid them
in the wall?), with the manufacturing logo from company of Tausik and
Kaufman, (prominent business here in Walla Walla that dissolved in the 70's)
Under the floorboards, in what is now my boy's rooms, we found a little
leather-bound book.....it is a girls health book, written by a Doctor. The
publishing date is 1912.....this book talks about girls bodies as they
&quot;Blossom Into Womanhood&quot;, and the &quot;Duties Expected of Them&quot;.....that's all
it says about sex ed....just &quot;Duties&quot;....not a word about sex.....I guess
that happened by osmosis, but it goes on and on about air baths, (run around
naked....but away from prying eyes)....and the worst......&quot;The Secret Sin&quot;
!!! Now this sin is soooo secret, that the good doc never comes out and says
what it is either....it took a little figuring to realize that the sin was
&quot;touching yourself&quot; ....wink wink.............
The motherlode came when we pulled up the 1945 linoleum in our room,(under
some funky shag carpet from the 60's or 70's)......under that linoleum what
a complete, pristine, newspaper. The headlines read....US Flyers Trap Jap
Fleet...with pictures!! My favorite parts of the paper are the
ads....Because we had no way to preserve the paper from getting brittle, we
donated it to the historical society at the college. Also stuck between the
wall and floor were some mint and rare baseball cards...rare enough, that
after taking them to a trusted appraiser, we were able to put the money away
for our daughter's college fund.
........for people who say, I wish this old house could
talk......well.....ours does.
We aren't done with all the restoring and renovations yet, but every once in
a while we still find stuff. Our house doesn't have any historical value,
and actually very little vintage or even historical style.....it was just a
little shotgun house for the common man, but it's a quirky little
place......perhaps like the families who have lived there?

closer step towards a higher end of decorating . I haven't seen a &quot;Period
Homes&quot; mag, but we do have our dream magazines we drool over ( not MS!). To
have a home fully decorated in that provincial country style would be a goal
many strive for. You just don't see much of it in the shops over here.
Since I moved 8 months ago, I have been looking for a long harvest or
English tavern style table for my kitchen. I will have to leave the state
and look elsewhere this summer. I just walk in and right out of
stores/estate sales any more, because all they are selling are 1920-30's
pieces. I would love to find a 18th or 19th century pine table. I will keep
searching. I know I'm just not looking in the right spot.

To follow up my own post, (yes, tacky...I know....Martha Stewart would never
approve), we did find something that was very neat about our house. After we
moved in, we noticed that there were no bugs, no insects, and not even many
spiders in our house. Now in a farming community, that's just flat strange!
After we started taking out old windows and exposing walls, we discovered
that our house is built with double-walled, 1 x 12 inch, cedar boards. So
basically, we live in a big cedar chest, but we don't have to worry about
fleas on any of the animals....or the boys either!!

You forgot florins = 2 shillings, crowns = 5
shillings, groats = 4 old pennies, silver joeys =
3 old pennies, farthings = a quarter penny and 960
to the pound.

The shapes are interesting - the threepenny bit
you mentioned was brass, or at least a very yellow
cupro-nickel alloy, and of 12 sides. We now have
the seven-sided 50 pence and 20 pence pieces

But then the Yanks had nickels, dimes, quarters -
and what were those 3-dollar notes I kept reading
about&lt;g&gt;

I spent 5 1/5 years in Canada and apart from the
basic culture shock, we were advised not to
convert pounds to dollars (it was 3 Canadian
Dollars to the pound then: 1 dollarC = 6 shillings
and 8 old pennies), but to estimate how long you
worked to afford something.

I remember it took six months of average earnings
to buy an average car in the UK and only three
months to buy an average Canadian (US) model.

Lovejoy fans will know that's how he values
antiques.

Ronnie,

Be aware that I am on your side of the pond now! At least
the upper most Northern part ie: Sweden.

My definitions:

Antique = 100 years
Vintage = less then 100 but more then 50.

&gt;the suburbs. But it is a more sophisticated country. Cleaner and leaner.
&gt;Your dining area (which you posted once) fits the bill quite nicely.

"/> Judy mentioned in her respond ... &quot;Country is the poor man's antiques&quot;
and whilst I see her point within a certain context, at the same time
I disagree. It's not all pine, cheapo painted rubbish, blue and white,
and chintzy drapes. Country extents to a much wider field, when we
move up-market, or at least when we do so over here, it extents into
&quot;provincial&quot; made furniture. That can mean furniture that within its
time frame followed the city fashion very closely but was made by the
provincial cabinetmaker in a simpler country form, and that can be any
wood, country fruit woods right through to mahogany. It can also mean
any style, for example, there was country made Chippendale and country
made Sheraton and it can be 18th century or 19th century. And not made
for the peasant population but for the rich and well to do country
land owner of the village dandy. When we extent into this form of
country furniture it most certainly is not cheap. Another mag we have
over here is &quot;Period Homes&quot; that is full of country furniture and all
mainly or at least 18th century stuff.

I must say, I like country furniture, although I much prefer to use
the term provincial furniture and in the provincial style. I would
specialize in this type of furniture, especially the mid to late 18th
century country style, alas I don't have the capital to do so, but I
will always buy pieces when I can. I don't believe we discriminate
enough when we use the term country, many times it's all lump
together, from peasant cottage furniture, to home made country pieces,
right through to the Gentleman's country residence, and the term
PRIMITIVE is totally and utterly abused and bastardized. The wall
shelf that my uncle Ben made out in his back-yard garden shed during
WW11 is hardly primitive, more like a piece of shite. ;)

If you have a bandsaw/benchsaw and possibly a
power planer and you do not want huge amounts of
any one size it is cheaper to buy the biggest
dimension sawn timber you can and dimension each
piece to your own exact requirements.

Another tip, again if you do not require huge
amounts or long lengths, is to seek out
alternative sources of supply - coffin makers,
stairway manufacturers, etc. Their off cuts are
usually very cheap or even given a way free.

The workshop technician at college obtained stacks
of short off-cuts of 8 x 2 well-seasoned oak,
mahogany (well the modern sapele), elm, beech and
maple, all suitable for turning or small projects,
for free - the factory was just going to burn it.

Roy

PS: You can use the sawdust and shavings for
hamster or rabbit litter or even work it into your
garden compost. Burn any chunks as kindling to
keep you warm in winter.

Might be something to do with modern standard
building regulations - ceiling heights usually
have to be 7 foot 3 inches or more.

You couldn't get planning permission for Ronnie's
money pit today - mind you, if it's a listed
(historic, not antique) building you would not be
allowed to increase the ceiling height either!

Its a funny old world.

spending 8 years, all his savings, bank loans and more. When the
project was complete, one morning out of the blue a formal letter

Lois E. , My parents bought a house in 1959 that was built in 1920's.
When I was doing some remodeling for them I also found newspapers as
insulation. The ads were great I want that brand new car for
the $200.00 advt. price. But I decided to
leave my signature for future remodelers.
I put stuff from that year back in the wall
along with my name,name of owner and
any info about the house that I knew. Eg.
it was a Sears build it yourself house. And
the house next door was the very same
Sears model. Since then the new owners
of both houses have done remodeling, they don't even look like twins any
more.
I am a bit of a show-off so when I put my name in the wall,I painted it
on the outside wallboards so if they want to get rid of it
they have to take the outside walls off.
FOR THE GUYS HERE. One thing I remember about this house, one year
on
FEB. 14 my dad took a very large mirror
down from the wall and painted in red
a large heart with his initials and my moms inside it. Even after
repainting the walls many times you could still see the
heart. On FEB.15 he just put the mirror
back up until the next year. We figured it
was like the Christmas lights. I never thought of my parents as being
&quot;in love&quot;.
until then. I don't know if your women would like this , but my mom
did.
Lois, Thanks for the great story keep them coming. Anyone else have
some neat discoveries? Perhaps a new thread.

"/> Absolutely, I agree completely. It is also my opinion (and you know what
that's worth) that your home is a very important extension of *you*. I do
not really think that income (or lack of it) is neccessarily and excuse for
poor living (and now I'm preaching Martha). If you have small means you are,
of course, forced to be more creative and enterprising. But more that the
worth of each individual piece I think a &quot;true&quot; home (as opposed to a &quot;false&quot;
one) has a sense of harmony and comfort that is apparent. I'm sure you have
been in homes that are decorated for &quot;presentation&quot;. I have a big problem
with that. If there is a room in my house that doesn't feel &quot;true&quot; I just
don't go into it. :-D
In a sense it is like your own private painting and evolution is not only
inevitable, it is part of the pleasure. I just love when married couples
come into my shop and are so obviously enjoying the adventure of &quot;antiqueing&quot;.
For every man that stands outside and taps his toes and looks at his watch and
barks at his wife to &quot;hurry up&quot; I wish I could smack 'em. They are really
sabbatoging their own needs, aren't they? Don't we all want a lovely place to
come home to and rest our weary selves?
Alrighty....back to that discussion of two by fours y'all. I've gotta go
look at some furniture. (I wonder who's going to name the price this morning?)

See ya!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Subject: Re: 1933 House I help restore. Good Golden oldie to decuss.

"/> Okay! The front room of the Old 1933 House.

Here we go. Walk across the wood floor from the fireplace &amp; there's a Huge
front window. The frame around the window was just strange. Never seen this
design before.

The frame had been carved all the way round it. Like someone at one point in
it's days had it custome made for the window.

Now, that must have cost a pretty penny. But, the big window when I was there
was sitting up against a wall at the time. They siad that the wood around where
it sat into the wall was rotting. Which by looking they were right, that whole
wall was bad.

The insulation was looking like a mouse had stayed there. We pulled tons of
insulation out of that area but, did find anything.

On that same wall about 3 feet over was the original front door in very nice
condition.
Beautiful carvings in the door. Looked like a spring senery of some sort. A few
trees, birds. That's about it. Then the top part of the door had a window that
opened in like the others over the top of every door wall in the house.

Turned around and there was the staircase leading to the up stairs. It allso
had at the button leading all the way up nice curved posts. The bottom wood
ball knob of those stairs didn't come off either, like I have seen them do many
of times.

The wood stair case needed to boards replaced out of about 25 boards. Not bad.
Walked the stairs &amp; half way up there was this light fixer hanging from the
ceiling.

It looked like a old fashioned miniture crystel chandler with dangling prisums.
Beautiful when it caught the light of the window at the half flat floor in
between the stair case. The window of the stair case was more long then wide.
Really tall. It also had the original curtains at the top. There was a old roll
shade at the top that wasn't rolled down. To me it had to be the original
window cause I remember seeing on like this in one of this womans other houses
&amp; she was having it removed for repair to the wall &amp; told us to be very careful
cause it was very old.

Then proceded up the stairs to the second floor. Turned to my left &amp; there was
a room that you could tell by the brown paint that it had to be the husbands
den, reading, or get away from everything room. There incased in a wall was a
tall bookcase. Just filled with books. I looked at some. They were mainly
medicial books. Found one that looked like a regular hardbound book but, when I
slowly opened it I was surprized at the content. The husband had written what
he had done over his life time.

Like a biography. His childhood, how he got his first car, who his parents &amp;
grandparents were &amp; all. Also lot about how he came about getting the old house
&amp; what he had to fix to make it livable.

So, took it to the new owner &amp; she sat on the stairs reading it. Her eys just
awed at what I had discovered. She siad after I read this &amp; see what has been
done. Then I'm taking this book to the musieum of history.

Come to find out the gent &amp; his family were very welthy black folk who had
purchase this house to long ago.

He had 7 children &amp; all were stairstep chilren in age. The oldest was 21 when
he wrote the book on his family.

That's alot of kids let alone alot of history.
After the 20th weekend being there, the owner took me with her to drop off the
book. I told her I wanted to make sure it got in safe hands cause the pages
were yellowing &amp; so old. Plus! Just between us collectors. I didn't want the
new owner to sell it which after a few weekends she was thinking about it.
That's not right. We could have lots that history for ever.

So, I told her how fast books can fall apart &amp; she agreed for me to go with
her.

Then went back upstairs in that same room &amp; there was a huge closet. Inside the
closet was all kinds of hoofs for everything. It's like they didn't have hangs
back then. Also this closet had cubby holes for things.

All thw wood in thew house was old oak or maple. This room had oak everything.
2 big windows with no shades or curtains. No wallpaper either. Looked at the
floor and you could see the history. There were indents of a chair with rounded
feet.

You could still find in the floor were a long piece of furniture use to be not
a bed. Maybe a couch or something. Then walking out of that room by the stairs
there was annother open door to another room.

This on was longer instead of wide. It had a old fashioned heater still hooked
up &amp; working in it. You know the ones that you could lay you socks, gloves or
scarfs from winter to get them warm &amp; dry. It had 2 tall but wide windows in
it. With roll down sades. No closet or anything. Just a long room. But, there
were sights of where the baby's crib use to be. On one wall there was wallpaper
with little lambs &amp; a hook right in the middle of that paper. Then about 10
inches below the paper was paint in very light faded pink color. I looked at
the floor again in that room &amp; you could see where something small with feet
had been.

I'm guessing a baby basinet maybe. There about a foot in the floor from that
were rocking chair marks, we all know what those look like. I'm guess the baby
to to the pink paint was a girl.

Then walked out of there into a open area that looked like to rooms in one.
Wide but long. Found where the heat ducts where in the floor &amp; all the original
wallpaper was on the walls. The ceiling had squared felt like cardboard pieces
that had been put up there. Bunches of the cause they were so browned &amp;
yellowed in spots they were coming down. So, we got a ladder &amp; started pulling
the ones left off the ceiling.

That's when we found out how the ceiling structure was made. Tons of 2X4's with
notches in all the ends arranged to fit each other to make the ceiling strong.
I got my flashlite out to see them better &amp; noticed they were put together so
well, there were no staples, nails or old wood nails holding them together.
Just themselves. That was scarey. Never seen such a sight. Tugged on one and it
was strong. WOW!

Alot of the ceiling were tall &amp; wide in this house. Not compared to the ones
today. Very nice heating &amp; air system back then too.

Couldn't tell you nwhat rooms these were. No tell tasles sights of anything.
Not even in the floors. Just empty space. But walking into another room you
could see the back of the house. This room had to be another child's room. Very
short closet not big like the others. Hooks low enough on 3 walls to hang
something at a 3 to 4 years olds height. Wallpaper that had horses on it. Left
in that room was a very small wood sitting chair in dark blue.

The windows had curtains of light blue hanging from them &amp; a design on them
I've not seen before. The cuetains also like like they were made of piloow case
material.

There was another door to this room but, it was locked &amp; I tried to get it
opened but, no such luck. Walk out of there &amp; down the long rooms &amp; rounded a
corner &amp; this is when I found out where that door lead too.

The back door to the top floor &amp; another wash room except in this wash room
right as I rounded the corner was a old Wood washmachine. Man! was it ever old.
It even had the old wood wringer still attched. I ran down the backhouse stairs
&amp; talk to the lady that bought the house. She ask me to find out where it came
from &amp; what it was worth. I told her I wouldn't sell it. It might belong to the
history of this house.

So, after work I went home. Then the 22 weekend I came &amp; it was still sitting
there. I scratch my head at it &amp; then started slowing seeing if it worked
right. It did.

She came to me before everyone else got there &amp; said that week she called the
museium about the book &amp; found out the husband purchased this machine on there
5 anniversary for her. That it was 1927 machine. The sericial numbers stamped
on the bottom of the tub proved it. Old machine &amp; still usable. The new owner
got paid some good cash money to put it in the museium. Because it went with
the history in that book. It even told when she got it &amp; the details of there
aniversary that year &amp; described how excited the wife was getting her first
washing machine. Now, that's nice.

So, that machine is sitting in Texas museium right now. Old washcloth &amp; all.

I'll tell you more later this week. I got some trim to finish on the outside of
my sons room &amp; the rest of the trim around out bathroom &amp; then a garage to
clean out.

Let alone a dead tree in our front yard to get rid of.

Keep on reading collectors &amp; enjoy.

&gt; Doris PS How did this happen?

&gt; Please do not read if squeamish!!

&gt; I have broken the same toe twice before and was told it would probably not set
&gt; properly. The first time was when a heavy and tall bookcase toppled over and
&gt; the top edge landed exactly right across the bridge of my big toe, snapping it
&gt; cleanly (I was wearing sandals at the time). I believe I said &quot;bother&quot; or
&gt; something similar.

&gt; The second time, I kicked a heavy oak sideboard (not on purpose, I was trying
&gt; to kick a support under one edge and missed.)

&gt; This time was crazy. I was glueing a table at floor level, so crouched right
&gt; down (sitting on my heels) to look at it. I overbalanced forward and pushed my
&gt; toes right back on themselves....and the big one broke again.

&gt; It was really painful but I went to work yesterday with it strapped up and
&gt; didn't say a word to anyone. However by lunchtime it had swollen so huge that
&gt; I realised that I would not get my shoe back on or be able to use the brake
&gt; pedal on the car.

&gt; Christopher can't believe how big it is and it looks so daft because I keep
&gt; sticking my foot in one of those wine bottle chillers you keep in the freezer
&gt; (very effective by the way). We then had an interesting discussion on
&gt; elephantitis, incidentally.

&gt; It will go down soon I hope, but it is pretty painful to move around on.

&gt; BTW doctors and hospitals will do nothing in the UK for a broken toe, even a
&gt; big one. They just tell you to bind it to the next one to minimise movement.
&gt; (Mind you, one doctor did seriously suggest amputating it when I did the first
&gt; break!)

&gt; Considering everything else, this is a mere fleabite...but thanks for the
&gt; comments!

&gt; Jon

&gt; PS I can't do my 30 minute daily walk now...so I'll have to eat even less this
&gt; week!

&gt; PPS Anyone else injured themselves with furniture or similar??

"/> Yes, in the latest case I pulled all the muscles in my lower back
unloading a bunch of old pine doors back in October. I bent down too far
with too big a load and bang! I couldn't walk without hanging onto the
wall for a week and it was two weeks before I could move anything
without a stab of pain. No lasting damage though, my GP says I have the
bones of an ox;~))

"/> I'm looking forward to responses on this one. I've fallen, crushed fingers,
and stretched muscles....but never anything that required medical attention.
More noteable is the furniture that was injured while being moved.
My H. once took a crowbar to a mantel that wouldn't fit into our van (it
was rather full of other furniture, but the mantel was a good deal!) and
damaged it.....When I returned the crowbar to the auctioneer's wife she asked
if I had been breaking and entering. I said no, But I was thinking about
clubbing someone to death. ;-)
See ya!

Jon, You do have all the luck. I did injure
myself that I'll tell you about( the rest of
the times I injured myself are too stupid
to tell anyone) My SO and I were putting
a cement form in one time and he wanted
me to hold the stake while he hit it with the 4lb. sledge. Ha my parents
didn't have any stupid kids, so I said i'll hit it you hold it. I guess
he didn't trust my swing cause he moved just a little and the sledge
slid off and came to rest against my shin. It
took 5sec. for that sucker to make an egg
and I hobbled all the way home while he
first asked if I was ok then began
ROTGLHAO. We've been called sick people many times so I got even with
him
probably not that long after, knowing how often he injures himself, not
intentionally,
I think. We can call Jon Bluto.

style and so things don't die off as soon, IMHO. The Victoria look, Marthas Shabby
Chic, the whole Country Living thing, each of those are keep going by the big
flashy mags.
On the other hand, if you fix up your whole place based on the ideas in a mag,
you don't want the style to get outdated next season.

Lois is from EASTERN Washington which is really far away from me. Those
of us in WESTERN Washington don't claim any Kenniwick guys, we don't mess with
Psudo Druids or any other wackos.
Everybody on my side of the mountains are sane regular folks who don't take
off their clothes, get drunk, or behave like eejets...unless there is a good
reason. Like the Hydro Races. ;-)

When we built our house ( 7 years ago ) after our fire we left lots of
stuff in the walls...there are drawings the kids did, cartoons and one very
drunk poem that the architect left there one night. There are some photos and
other stuff....someday somebody is going to be suprised, and confused!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Actually Doris, I'm so glad you brought this up...When we decided to put in
&gt; new windows, (we thought it would be a novel idea if, when the wind blew, it
&gt; didn't blow stuff off the walls on the INSIDE of the house), we found the
&gt; walls stuffed with old, 1904 newspapers. One of the stories was about Joseph
&gt; Smith Jr....the son of the original founder of the Church of Latter Day
&gt; Saints.....coming to lecture at the &quot;new&quot; Whitman College. Another was the
&gt; story of a ....ahem....lady, who had gone to Alaska, made her fortune, (I'm
&gt; guessing she was a...um....waitress?), took a lover, threw him over....took
&gt; another lover and sailed away to Seattle with him. First lover tracked them
&gt; down to a hotel and (I'm quoting) &quot;In a fit of jealous pique&quot; tried to shoot
&gt; the pair!! But after five shots, the pair overpowered him, took his gun and
&gt; pistol-whipped him. All it told, in the most breathless of terms.
&gt; In another wall, we found some ice ration cards from WW1, (who knew ice was
&gt; rationed?), a set of silver scissors from a ladies sewing basket, and a set
&gt; of ice tongs, (for the purloined ice, I guess, but why would they hid them
&gt; in the wall?), with the manufacturing logo from company of Tausik and
&gt; Kaufman, (prominent business here in Walla Walla that dissolved in the 70's)
&gt; Under the floorboards, in what is now my boy's rooms, we found a little
&gt; leather-bound book.....it is a girls health book, written by a Doctor. The
&gt; publishing date is 1912.....this book talks about girls bodies as they
&gt;&quot;Blossom Into Womanhood&quot;, and the &quot;Duties Expected of Them&quot;.....that's all
&gt; it says about sex ed....just &quot;Duties&quot;....not a word about sex.....I guess
&gt; that happened by osmosis, but it goes on and on about air baths, (run around
&gt; naked....but away from prying eyes)....and the worst......&quot;The Secret Sin&quot;
&gt; !!! Now this sin is soooo secret, that the good doc never comes out and says
&gt; what it is either....it took a little figuring to realize that the sin was
&gt;&quot;touching yourself&quot; ....wink wink.............
&gt; The motherlode came when we pulled up the 1945 linoleum in our room,(under
&gt; some funky shag carpet from the 60's or 70's)......under that linoleum what
&gt; a complete, pristine, newspaper. The headlines read....US Flyers Trap Jap
&gt; Fleet...with pictures!! My favorite parts of the paper are the
&gt; ads....Because we had no way to preserve the paper from getting brittle, we
&gt; donated it to the historical society at the college. Also stuck between the
&gt; wall and floor were some mint and rare baseball cards...rare enough, that
&gt; after taking them to a trusted appraiser, we were able to put the money away
&gt; for our daughter's college fund.
&gt; ........for people who say, I wish this old house could
&gt; talk......well.....ours does.
&gt; We aren't done with all the restoring and renovations yet, but every once in
&gt; a while we still find stuff. Our house doesn't have any historical value,
&gt; and actually very little vintage or even historical style.....it was just a
&gt; little shotgun house for the common man, but it's a quirky little
&gt; place......perhaps like the families who have lived there?

It was Roy, not Ronnie - please don't blame him
for everything.

We have an odd sense of humour. I've probably been
watching too many American Civil War movies. I
also live in East Anglia where there are a lot of
USAAF bases. Treat it as a form of endearment and
possibly less patronising that &quot;Our American
cousins&quot;.

I picked up the phrase &quot; as genuine as a 3-dollar
bill&quot; when I was in Canada. It never existed, so
it was a fake or forgery - or just a joke.

There is also the phrase &quot;funny money&quot; denoting
forgeries.

I did hear that the Japanese produce glass fibre
thatch, fire-proof and indistinguishable from the
real thing.

There is a small village near to were I live,
mostly owned by the local Lord of the Manor. It's
conservation area and development is extremely
limited. However a local developer got planning
permission for &quot;executive homes&quot;. They are all
built to identical visual simulation of the
existing (mostly 17th/18th Century) cottages and I
have to admit, look pretty good. I think they sold
in the quarter to half-million pounds range.

The development won a heritage award of some kind.
A definite step up from the rows of &quot;Georgian&quot;
town houses and bungalows that sprang up in the
70s and the hideous pseudo-Victorian monstrosities
that infest most 90s estates.

I do find that the mock &quot;Tudorbethan&quot; styles from
the 1890s - 1930s are now achieving a more mature
charm. Perhaps, like me, they are just mellowing
with age?

"/> I believe in the ROI one can get grant-aid for the reinstatement of a
thatch, however, I think this must be a traditional handmade/handcut
thatch before aid will be approved. The modern system down in the ROI
seems to be the installation of a main independent roof first, which
appears to be made from a sort of aluminium (aluminum) decking, looks
rather like a large carpet grip, the pre-cut thatch is then placed
over and attached to the decking. Perhaps, in this case, the thatch is
not the real material but this Japanese product, I don't really know.
On the West coast (Galway/Clare etc) it's now not all that uncommon to
see new housing developments with the thatch roof, all looks like
something out of bleedin' Disneyland ... way, way over the top.

LeAnne,

hehe! I loved your story! The native Americans in the Southwest
also took Spanish names since many a Franciscan was out to convert
the natives. My Stepmother is a full blooded native american from the
Santa
Ana Reservation in Northern New Mexico and her maiden name is Sanchez.
When
I asked her why she said because the Spanish priests gave the Native
Americans
Spanish surnames.

Spain was after all in the USA with established settlements before
England.

The latest news (a couple of weeks ago) is that they are going
to run DNA tests on Kennewick Man and compare the DNA to the
Native and other groups that claim him. Anyone who's interested
can get the entire update and all previous press releases and
related information at the website:
http://www.cr.nps.gov/aad/kennewick/

I live in Western Washington too (Everett) and have been keeping
a pretty close eye on this story, having been a Physical
Anthropology (human evolution) major in college. Also one of the
guys who found it was the cousin of a woman who worked for my
husband. They actually found him before the hydro races but
didn't want to be late, so they went back later, after the races

$139,000? here in the north where I live, you'd add another $130,000 to the

In my neck of the woods, tin rooves are historically correct in certain
Cracker-style (don't ask) homes. Tin also lasts nearly forever.
However, the major federal subsidizer (wrong word-somebody help me here)

Our house is 30 years old and an on-the-cheap homage to 50s modern
architecture. Also very obviously the first house of an architect who
did a lot of the work himself without quite knowing how (sand-textured
paint does not nearly hide the drywall tape!)

So, not &quot;historic&quot; at all, but the house will be here forever (per my
brother the engineer, upon inspection of the steel I-beam structure).
Since it will be here forever :-), I have made the steel pillar of the
spiral staircase into an ad hoc time capsule (as no one ever put a
proper steel cap on it). I have dropped old coins, a few pens, anything
small my simple mind thinks of, down into the pillar for a future
generation to discover. Thanks to this thread, I pledge to become more
organized and thoughtful about what I throw in there :-). Any
suggestions?

Nevermind old houses. Where I am at houses start out at 250,000
no matter what age they are.

I am hoping to find a deal on a 17/1800's house when we are
ready to purchase an old house.

"/> We have a subscription to Country living at my house. It's part of the
wacky collection of mags we read. I don't know if these magazines have
real influence here. I haven't noticed it. Country style may have more
staying power in.. the country.&lt;g&gt;, seriuosly , though I think it's
probably regional. There's more of a country influence in say, the
midwest, or the more rural areas of the south or new england, then in
the urban/suburban areas of midatlantic northeast ( which I call home).

The Barnes &amp; Noble hear has a bunch of home decorator magazines with
&quot;country&quot; in the title and some with &quot;victorian&quot; as well. It's all an
abstract concept, though. I think most people who read these magazines
see this stuff as a &quot;dream house&quot; idea. If I could afford a house in the
country and fill it with antiques, stuff. They do sell the British
Country Living here along with a couple of other home and craft
magazines.

Is country dead in my region? Who knows. Trends seem to change by the
hour. People here who have more money then brains (it's always that
way, itsn't it?) read these magazines, go to antique shows, hire
interior decorators, then wind up buying stuff from Ethan Allen, Bombay
Company or just fill their house with contempoary cookie cutter stuff
from Levitz or Seamens anyway.

&gt;and has anyone heard of Kennewick Man?

"/> PBS had a show about Kennewick man recently. I think it was a episode of
NOVA.
His discovery is stirring up a lot of controversy in regards to NAGPRA.
The Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act, where all
bodies of Native Americans that are now in Museums and Universities
along with Native American Artifacts must be returned to the tribes. The
problem with Kennewick man is that he is a ancestor of some Native
Americans who emigrated to the Americas at a different time and from a
different part of Asia as most Native Americans. This wreaks havoc with
the various migration pattern theories, especially the concept that
there was an area along the coast of Alaska down to the pacific
northwest that actually was uncovered by the big glacier during the last
ice age.
Kennewick man isn't bilogically related to the descendants of the Native
Americans in the area he was found. But the local tribe is fighting for
his remains. Scholars still want to research his skeleton along with a
similar tribesman found in Nevada, but the Nevada person has been
returned to the local tribe, already.
The ultimate fate of Kennewick man is still in the courts.
