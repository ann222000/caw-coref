Hi gang,
I'm moving to a new house and just had a 60a  sub panel installed in the
garage and I'm in need of a VFD to replace my rotary phase converter. It's
just going to run my Bridgeport and possibly a CNC (If the bank robbery goes
off as planned) Anyone have one for sale? I left space on the wall for it,
right next to the panel for a professional appearance. The mill is going to
be right near it (less than 10')  I don't have much to spend but I figured
I'd do it now while it's still bare walls.  2hp BP motor.  Shipping is to
Joliet IL. 60431 I have DHL accounts so I can cover pickup costs.

Thanks fellas,

Rob

You can't run a complete CNC machine from a VFD.  It produces
340 V square pulses that make a motor pretty happy, but will
wreak havoc on anything else, especially electronics.  It will
run just the AC induction spindle motor on a CNC machine just
fine, of course.

Thanks Jon!  I guess that sort of keeps the RPC around! and lowers the needs
on the VFD.  I don't even know what CNC I will wind up with but I'm sure
it's not going to be a real big one. A home shop size used cheap-o is most
likely to find itself at my place..

Rob....you can run individual machines with VFDs, or even several,
running one at a time, but you wont be able to run a CNC anything off
a VFD.   If there is a VFD incorporated in the CNC machine..fine.  But
dont try to run a VFD from a VFD...bad things happen then the magic
smoke comes out.

Same with DC drives on OD grinders that use one leg for the live
spindle....blush...

A RPC has a definate place in the shop.  A VFD is an individual
replacement for them, but not a mass replacement.  You can run
multiple machines at the same time, turning various ones off and on
while others are running. Doing the same with a VFD may well let out
the magic smoke.

A VFD on a step pully Bridgeport is a marvelous thing. Makes it even
more versitile than a varible speed Bridgeport.

On the other hand...I have a Larios horizontal mill. Nice 40 taper
machine. 3hp on the spindle, 2 hp on the power feed(s) and a 3ph
coolant pump.

Where do I put the VFD? &lt;G&gt;

As I said....RPCs have a definate place.

Your motor is 1 HP, right? I have a lot of drives right now and will
be happy to set you up with one. I will give you a price much better
than I get for them on eBay. (like 40% off)

Running CNC machines on drives depends on what machine, some need real
3 phase.

I would speculate that you could do a little electronic work on a smaller
CNC and make it happy with single phase power - would take looking at the
specific unit though.

Rob...I think most folks would be well served with a 5hp RPC at the
biggest.

5hp 3ph motors are dirt cheap, 3hp are free (how many do you want?
&lt;G&gt;)

I was impressed by one a friend purchased off Ebay a few years ago.
The seller was putting them in nice metal cabinets and you used your
own motor.   About $150 or so as I recall.  Guy was in California IRRC

If I get a CNC I'll upgrade the RPC I have now. It's on it's last leg ( Pun
intended)  I wanted the VFD for the Bridgeport, now knowing I'll nuke a CNC
with it. It's the only three phase gear I presently own.  I think it's 2hp.
Ebay prices are all over on both RPC's and VFD's   I was looking at the
speed flexblility for the mill really. The CNC is in the future and I can
get a item such as Ebay auction 330179518433 for the RPC. I have to spin up
mine by hand now and all the heaters are jumpered.

Thanks guys,

You must have changed the motor, then!

You can either use the digital panel/keypad for control, or use a
potentiometer. I have different drives also. I will include

Three VFD's, the one for the coolant pump can be an itty bitty.  A

I have run computers on VFD's without any problems! There was a time when HP
made floppy disk drives driven by synchronous motors. Different pulleys were
fitted for markets with different mains frequencies. We didn't know this until
we took our UK (50Hz) sold HP 9845 computer to a power station in (60Hz) South
Korea. HP couldn't source a 60Hz set of pulleys in time, so I bought an
invertor and ran the computer and disk drives from that.

Remember that virtually all electronic power supplies have been switch mode
for the last couple of decades. The only item that is likely to cause problems
are the filters on the mains inlet of the electronics (if they are fitted). It
is possible that the ground leakage currents from these will cause the VFD to
trip!

&gt; intended)  I wanted the VFD for the Bridgeport, now knowing I'll nuke a CNC
&gt; with it. It's the only three phase gear I presently own.  I think it's 2hp.
&gt; Ebay prices are all over on both RPC's and VFD's   I was looking at the
&gt; speed flexblility for the mill really. The CNC is in the future and I can
&gt; get a item such as Ebay auction 330179518433 for the RPC. I have to spin up
&gt; mine by hand now and all the heaters are jumpered.

If you can split the spindle motor (which needs three phase)
from the rest of the electronics for the CNC (which can *perhaps* be run
from 120 VAC or 240 VAC single phase, then it is mostly a trick of where
to mount the VFD and how to replace the motor switching with commands to
the VFD.

What would be particularly nice would be if you can get the CNC
to make use of the VFD for controlling motor speed as well as
start/stop/reverse operations.  Note that most VFDs can accept a 0-5VDC or
0-10VDC signal from the CNC's computer to command a specific spindle
speed.  The trick may be whether you can convince an existing CNC
controller to produce that signal.  And *some* CNC machines which can
do this may already have a VFD in the collection of electronics just for
controlling the spindle motor speed.

Good Luck,
DoN.

Paul,

I'm here now... Been here since moving back from Chicago. Just have a
shop there.  Moving from River Glen to Timberline..... Neighbors there are
NOT gonna like the funny car getting fired up in that prissy neighborhood!
You close?  I was born and raised here.

&gt; Thanks Jon!  I guess that sort of keeps the RPC around! and lowers the needs

&gt; it's not going to be a real big one. A home shop size used cheap-o is most
&gt; likely to find itself at my place..

Many of the off-brand (Bandit, Centroid, and a few others whose
names escape me at the moment) ran off single phase power except
for the spindle motor.  Bridgeport ran their BOSS stepper drive
off a huge 3-phase transformer.  If you do a retrofit, then you
can select your own power source, and set up a VFD for the spindle.

&gt; Hey Iggy

&gt; I'm thinking about a VFD for my step pulley BP, don't remember motor
&gt; size.  I'll check in a few days and maybe we can work something out.

I run mine on a VFD. Works great. I would put  VFD on it even if I had
real three phase.

&gt; -  Funny! I used to make deposits, not withdrawals!  I was a cop here for
&gt; 10 or so years.  Worst job I ever had. I went to work for the Fed's after
&gt; the local stuff got to me.... Even worse... Went into the private sector
&gt; while working on my MBA at night.  The one good thing about a 3rd shift
&gt; govt. job. Paid study hall!!

Fairly close, over off Midland Ave.  I've lived in the area all my life.
Some of your neighbors can use some rattling anyway, and what the hey
you're just up the road from the strip.

Your non-guest status is a good thing. And big cities (Joliet or
Chicago) are like that. Full of &quot;whatever you need NOW&quot; but oppressive
as hell.
