Making a Hard-Life Story Open a Door to College
===============================================

By SARA RIMER

WASHINGTON — Antoine Tate, 16, was sitting in a courtyard at Howard
University in the heat of a July morning. He was holding a pen, and
staring at the blank page on the step beneath him.

He began to write: “Do you ever wonder about where you may end up in the
future? At least I know I have. I thought about the worst and best
things. I have worried about living half my life in jail. I worried about
having a child at a young age. I have worried about living life in
poverty, but worst of all, I have thought about accidentally giving my
life to God at a young age.”

Antoine, who is African-American, will begin his senior year in September
at his large, predominantly black and low-income high school just outside
Washington. He had come to Howard for an intense four-day workshop in the
complex process he will have to master if he is to fulfill his
aspirations of upward mobility: applying to college.

“I have dreamed about lending my ideas to people and inspiring many
people, especially the youth, through my life,” Antoine wrote. “And
through my writing.”

“College is the key,” he wrote, “as well as hope.”

These first words were the germ of what would become, after hours and
hours of soul-searching, coaching, writing and rewriting, his college
application essay.

The essay has become such an important part of applying to college that
affluent students may turn to $200-an-hour writing coaches to help them
produce the 500 perfect words that they hope will separate them from the
pack.

One staple of the affluent students’ essays is the service trip to Latin
America. “It’s the first time they’ve seen this wrenching poverty,” said
Lee Coffin, the director of undergraduate admissions at Tufts University.
After a while, however, the trips sound the same.

“My colleagues nod and say, ‘It’s the typical Costa Rica essay,’ ” Mr.
Coffin said.

But the lives of Antoine and the other 36 students at the workshop, which
is run by College Summit, a nonprofit organization, are defined by
struggle.

The workshop is intended to help them discover — and prove to college
admissions officials — that their life stories can be as powerful as high
SAT scores and stellar grades.

The essay is where they get to shine.

“I will not become a stereotype/statistic because many African/Black
Americans proved that we can achieve greater heights,” Antoine wrote.
“Richard Wright is a great, black American writer. Have you read his
famous book, “Black Boy.” I have, and if you have read it, you should
know that he defeated the odds. Same with Martin and his dream.”

“Just like these incredible men,” he wrote, “I, too, want to defeat the
stereotypes.”

Antoine is a B student at struggling Crossland High, in Prince George’s
County, Md., where most of the 1,700 students are black and more than a
third are living in poverty. He is a youth leader in his church, but he
is not an academic star. He is not one of the handful of students from
high schools like his whose numbers attract the attention of
diversity-minded college admissions officials. The other seniors with him
at Howard had B and C averages.

But his high school’s selection of him for the College Summit program,
which teams up with both high schools and colleges, substantially
increases his odds. The workshops, which 1,500 low-income seniors across
the country will attend this summer, are part of College Summit’s effort
to extend the college-going culture beyond the middle class.

The colleges that play host to the workshops and are eager for more
low-income applicants get a first look at the portfolios of the students.

These are the “better-than-their-numbers students,” said J. B. Schramm,
the Harvard Divinity School graduate who founded College Summit 14 years
ago. They have talent and academic potential not revealed by their SAT
scores and grades, Mr. Schramm said. Seventy-nine percent of students who
go through the workshops enroll in college, he said, while nationally
fewer than 50 percent of low-income students do.

With the application process itself one of the biggest obstacles, he
said, many students do not even apply to college. Their parents cannot
help them navigate the process because for the most part, like Antoine’s
parents, they did not go to college themselves.

For Antoine, the first assignment from his writing coach was “Free write
for 10 minutes; write about anything you want.” The words, the first of
thousands he would write and rewrite over the next few days, seemed to
just flow out of him, he said.

Later, Antoine read what he had written to the other three members of his
writing group, who, as it happened, were all girls. Encouraged by their
writing coach, Tony Askew, the group offered feedback about words,
phrases and ideas they liked and things they wanted to know more about.

Mr. Askew, a former college admissions official now with College Summit,
wrote down the key points with a blue marker on a huge sheet of white
paper on the ground while the group waited for classroom space to open
up: “College is the key. Wants to inspire people by writing. Did not want
to be another statistic.”

The writing coaches — except Mr. Askew, they are all volunteers — are not
there to tell students what to write or to polish their sentences. They
are trained to treat the students’ work as if it were the text of a
published writer. “To find the themes, the images, the narratives, the
conflicts,” explains Keith Frome, the educator who developed College
Summit’s writing curriculum.

“Gold mining,” Mr. Frome calls it.

Antoine’s writing group was gold mining his text.

“I do not want to become another African American/Black stereotype,”
Antoine wrote as he began his second 10-minute free write. “Most of us
men are labeled as thugs, because of our long hair, dreads, dark clothing
and the music we listen to. If we are driving a luxurious car most people
assume that we either bought it with illegal money or we stole.”

In small groups, the other students were beginning to tell their stories.
They were writing about being homeless, about their families being “dead
broke,” about the deaths of friends, sisters and mothers.

They were writing about how much they loved their mothers, about their
anger over absent fathers, about a father who drives a cab at all hours
of the night and is “the backbone of our family.” They were writing about
their aspirations: to become doctors, computer engineers, singers, social
workers.

As the second full day of writing began, Mr. Askew told the students: “I
want you to dig deeper. Tell me more. Show me.” Antoine, slightly
exasperated, asked, “You mean I got to write more?” Then he started
digging deeper.

“I want to enter college showing that young black men from Ward 8 can
make it to college,” he wrote.

Ward 8 is southeast Washington, the poor neighborhood where Antoine lived
with his parents until several years ago, when he moved with his father
to nearby Prince George’s County. Antoine’s mother still lives in Ward 8,
and he visits frequently.

Ward 8 is where 17-year-old William Newman, who was in Antoine’s global
history class last year, was shot in the back and killed on June 28. He
died five days after he got home from a College Summit workshop in
Towson, Md. He had come back telling friends he wanted to go to college.

Antoine wrote, “I don’t want to be added to someone’s death statistic.”

His writing was great, Mr. Askew told Antoine. But he had to dig deeper
still.

By Saturday afternoon, with a list of possible colleges in hand — Howard,
Penn State, Virginia Tech, Morehouse, among others — Antoine was in the
computer lab, typing a final draft of his essay, one and a half pages,
single spaced.

“My mind races 75 miles per hour and many things explode in my head,” he
wrote. “Will I just be another young black male stereotype no matter how
hard I try to avoid it?”

He went on for several hundred more words, focusing on his drive to prove
that he “can be brilliant and hardworking,” to rise above the
stereotypes, his feeling that Richard Wright, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. and Tiger Woods “are rooting me on as my personal fans.”

He dreams of becoming a rapper or entrepreneur or children’s book author.

“I believe that once I break the statistic hold,” he concluded, “a
brighter path will open and my golden bricks will be laid.”

Teachers to board: Developmental Research School 'in a crisis'
By Angeline Taylor
DEMOCRAT STAFF WRITER

The school that shares [historically Black college] Florida A&amp;M
University's name is beginning to share its fate.

FAMU's Developmental Research School - the kindergarten through 12th
grade school that neighbors its parent university - is being reviewed by
a task force due to concerns.

High teacher turnover, complaints from parents and teachers and the final
disgrace - a grade of F for the first time in the school's history -
surround FAMU DRS.

&quot;We've graduated so many excellent people,&quot; Barbara Barnes, FAMU's
interim provost and vice president for academic affairs, said of the high
school's past. &quot;We should be setting the model for the world.&quot;

Instead of setting that model, the school drew negative comments from
FAMU President James Ammons on his first day at the university.

&quot;Our own lab school is an underachieving school,&quot; Ammons said when he
addressed faculty. &quot;We have a responsibility to do something about that.&quot;

The troubling news about the school comes at a time when prep work has
begun on a new campus at Orange Avenue and Wahnish Way.

His prescription was to include the DRS in his 100-day plan. He submitted
that plan to FAMU's board of trustees.

&quot;An F - a D - those grades are unacceptable,&quot; the Rev. R.B. Holmes Jr.,
vice chairman of FAMU's board of trustees, said in detailing the school's
record. The school earned a C during the 2005-06 school year and a D for
the previous year. It has never performed above the C level.

Parent Katisa Donaldson said she drives by two A schools to take her son
to FAMU DRS. She told trustees her heartfelt story. She enrolled him in
the school after he came to her saying he knew that a black man could do
more then push a garbage can. In the past year, she and her husband had
to pay tutors to get him up to par in math.

&quot;His math teacher was not even certified in math,&quot; she said. &quot;If you ever
want to see a hurricane, Katrina's right across the street.&quot;

Other parents also feel torn about enrolling their children in the
school.

&quot;I have a child at FAMU High, and I work here on campus,&quot; Arthur Ingram
said to the board of trustees. &quot;I'd love to see improvements, but I've
got to put my child first.&quot;

Two teachers spoke to the board of trustees at its last meeting.

&quot;The DRS is in a crisis, one that's getting worse daily,&quot; DRS teacher
Charles Lyles said about the school created to teach future educators.

Lyles offered an inside look at the school. He said 16 out of 37 teachers
resigned to go to other teaching positions after the 2005-06 school year.
Ten teachers left this year.

&quot;Novice to veteran teachers leave,&quot; he said.

Fellow DRS educator Hope William joined Lyles. Each said part of the
problem is that the leader of the school is not given support. The
school's interim director, Cheryl Jennings, recently resigned.

&quot;The (director) is handicapped by an outdated governing system,&quot; Lyles
said. &quot;She left us for the same reasons others have in the past.&quot;

In a letter dated May 8, Jennings resigned after a year as director. Her
resignation was given to former College of Education Dean Scott Dantley,
who resigned last week. Jennings cited her anxiousness to enter into
retirement as her reason for leaving. Jennings said she was proud of her
association with FAMU, the College of Education and the faculty and staff
of the DRS.

&quot;Even though we were challenged many times this year, the faculty
remained focused on teaching and learning while striving to maintain the
highest standards for our district,&quot; she said in her resignation letter.

Barnes said the university is not taking reports of the school's problems
sitting down - it is doing something about it. The task force, which is
made up of university scholars and administrators, will be meeting within
the next two weeks. It will honor the mandate from the Department of
Education to turn the school around, she said.

&quot;The school has great education potential,&quot; Barnes said. &quot;The purpose of
the task force is to develop a blueprint to develop the lab school.&quot;

The group will have a firm plan in place by January, she said. In the
meantime, it will review DRS history to determine what may have gone
wrong.

How do FAMU DRS's grades compare to those of its sister schools?

Florida A&amp;M University Developmental Research School -- F

Redundancy testing
==================

Charles Murray, erstwhile champion of the SAT, has changed his mind about
the test -- and says it's time to scrap it
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

By Christopher Shea  |  July 29, 2007

Charles Murray has turned against the SAT. Yes, that Charles Murray.

The author of the controversial 1994 book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; and champion
of IQ tests might be the last person in the world you'd expect to object
to a test that boils academic aptitude down to a couple of numbers burned
into students' memories for life.

Yet Murray has just invigorated the anti-SAT cause with a manifesto
titled &quot;Abolish the SAT&quot; in The American, a magazine published by the
American Enterprise Institute, where he's a senior scholar. That the SAT
is superfluous -- worse, outright bad for American education -- is &quot;a
conclusion I resisted as long as I could,&quot; Murray writes, partly for
biographical reasons: He assumed his SAT scores carried him from his
podunk Iowa high school into Harvard.

Now, however, he's convinced that the SAT provides little information
about high school students not already provided by their grades and
scores on so-called achievement tests, exams that are tied to specific
academic subjects. And dumping the SAT would have numerous benefits:
scuttling what he sees as a deceptive test-prep industry, undercutting
the unproductive smugness that comes from thinking one's high SAT score
reflects personal glory (he views it as the luck of the genetic draw),
and short-circuiting the contention that the SAT amounts to a conspiracy
against low-income students.

&quot;If the SAT had not acquired the role in American culture that it has,
I'd say, 'Take the SAT, take the achievement tests, and who cares?'&quot;
Murray said in an interview. But the popular perception of the SAT as
unfair and coachable -- even if that view is wrong -- &quot;has a very
corrosive effect.&quot;

There have long been complaints about the test, but Murray's turnabout
coincides with a surge in criticism of the SAT and its use by colleges. A
University of California researcher, on whose earlier work Murray draws,
released a study in June affirming that the SAT provides little
additional information in California's admissions process. Meanwhile, an
article in the newest American Sociological Review argues that admissions
officers -- despite some assertions to the contrary -- are putting more
weight on the SAT than ever. Murray's intervention could make a
difference, given his reputation and his status in some conservative
circles.

&quot;The phrase that comes to mind is, 'Nixon going to China,'&quot; said Howard
Gardner, a professor of cognition and education at Harvard and a longtime
SAT critic.

. . .

Murray's road-to-Damascus moment arrived when he came across research
conducted in 2001 by the Office of the President of the University of
California, when then-president Richard Atkinson floated the idea of
ditching the SAT. Researchers Saul Geiser and Richard Studley found that
the SAT, by itself, was not a bad predictor of freshman-year college
grades. But if you considered high school GPA and three achievement-test
scores -- and then looked at the extra predictive value added by the SAT,
the SAT explained only an additional 0.1 percent of student performance
differences.

Wayne Camara, the top researcher at the College Board, which administers
the SAT, said that's a somewhat rigged way of looking at things: If you
started with the SAT and GPA, and then looked at the achievement tests,
they would appear to add relatively little value, too; College Board
studies affirm that, on balance, SAT scores and achievement-test numbers
are largely interchangeable.

But that's not true for all students -- or all achievement tests. On
average, 30 percent of students will have statistically significant
differences between their two sets of scores, Camara said. Colleges may
want to know which students -- and by how much. And, he added, there are
other confounding issues, as when native Spanish speakers take the
Spanish-language achievement test.

(The College Board seemingly changes the names of its tests every few
years, a fact that Murray and I both choose to ignore for the sake of
clarity: What he calls the SAT and the achievement tests the College
Board today calls the SAT Reasoning Test and the SAT Subject Tests.)

In 2001, the UC researchers found that achievement tests and high school
GPA were powerful predictors of freshman-year college performance at even
the weakest California high schools -- which sealed the deal for Murray.
Last month, Geiser, now a fellow at Berkeley's Center for Studies of
Higher Education, and co-author Maria Veronica Santelices, of Berkeley's
Graduate School of Education, released a follow-up report showing that
the 2001 findings were confirmed by the students' grades throughout their
college years.

Prodded by the University of California, the College Board in 2005 made
changes to the SAT. There is now a writing test and more upper-level
algebra, and the infamous verbal-analogies section (the most IQ-like part
of the test) has been dropped. Murray argues that the closer the SAT
moves toward being an achievement test -- exactly what UC wanted -- the
more superfluous it becomes.

Despite the concerns about the test, the American Sociological Review
study identifies a major shift, from the 1980s to the 1990s, in how
selective colleges evaluated applicants. Formerly, GPA mattered more than
the SAT in admission, conclude Sigal Alon, of the University of Tel Aviv,
and Marta Tienda, of Princeton. By the '90s, at the most selective
colleges, the SAT was given more weight than GPAs, and the SAT's relative
importance increased almost everywhere. And recent surveys suggest the
trend continues.

Can one man's change of heart shift the SAT debate? Plenty of
psychologists, including David Lohman of the Univerity of Iowa, continue
to maintain that tests measuring &quot;fluid reasoning&quot; unconnected to
specific curriculums are better than achievement tests at identifying
smart kids in bad schools (though Lohman doesn't think the current SAT is
a very good test of fluid reasoning). And numerous widely ignored studies
have shown that SAT-like tests are not as coachable as test-prep
companies claim they are.

If the SAT were abandoned, it's possible that test-coaching mania and the
overall anti-testing brouhaha would simply shift to the achievement
tests. But expensive cram-style courses, Murray writes, would be less
alienating to low-income students than current beat-the-SAT boot camps,
which give students who can't afford them &quot;the sense of being shut out of
mysteries.&quot;

Is this a never-ending debate? Maybe not, Murray said: If Harvard dropped
the test, &quot;the SAT would disappear almost instantly.&quot;

Still Lagging, Paterson Schools Stay Under New Jersey Control
=============================================================

By WINNIE HU

New Jersey education officials said yesterday that the Paterson public
schools would remain under state control after a new state report found
continuing problems with the district’s academic instruction and school
board operations.

The 28,000-student Paterson district, which has been under state control
since 1991 because of fiscal mismanagement and poor academics, failed to
show satisfactory progress over the last year in any of the five main
areas being evaluated: instruction and programs, school board operations,
personnel, building maintenance and school safety, and budgetary issues.

State education officials said they would work with Paterson’s
state-appointed superintendent and nine-member elected school board,
which serves in an advisory capacity, to come up with a plan for
improving the district’s performance.

Last week, the state education commissioner, Lucille E. Davy, said the
two other state-run districts, Jersey City and to a lesser extent Newark,
had shown enough improvement to be allowed to take back some of their
fiscal and management operations as a first step toward regaining local
control. Newark has been under state control since 1995, and Jersey City
since 1989.

In contrast, Commissioner Davy said Paterson was “not getting anything
back at this stage.” She said that the district had just finished
updating its curriculum to meet state standards, and that in February the
state had appointed a fiscal monitor after an audit found poor financial
oversight and questionable expenditures.

The Paterson superintendent, Michael E. Glascoe, declined to comment
until he could review the report, said Laura Constable, a district
spokeswoman. She said the district received the report yesterday
afternoon.

The Paterson students are among the poorest in the state, with 75 percent
qualifying for free or reduced-cost lunches. About 57 percent are
Hispanic and 35 percent are African-American. The students, many of whom
are immigrants, speak more than 37 languages, school officials said.
“This makes Paterson one of the most diverse school districts in the
state, as well as one of the largest,” Ms. Constable said.

Andre Sayegh, who became president of the Paterson Board of Education two
months ago, said the district has been using an outdated curriculum in
its schools and suffered from a high turnover among administrators, who
have included three different superintendents and four business
administrators in three years.

He said the district was now poised to make progress following recent
changes like the adoption of a new curriculum and new academic strategies
for its schools. In addition, the school board developed a mission
statement for the first time last month and is working on a range of
school policies that will be recommended to the superintendent. “We
received our school report card and we’re looking to improve our grades,”
he said.

A Teacher Grows Disillusioned After a ‘Fail’ Becomes a ‘Pass’
=============================================================

By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN

Several weeks into his first year of teaching math at the High School of
Arts and Technology in Manhattan, Austin Lampros received a copy of the
school’s grading policy. He took particular note of the stipulation that
a student who attended class even once during a semester, who did
absolutely nothing else, was to be given 45 points on the 100-point
scale, just 20 short of a passing mark.

Mr. Lampros’s introduction to the high school’s academic standards proved
a fitting preamble to a disastrous year. It reached its low point in late
June, when Arts and Technology’s principal, Anne Geiger, overruled Mr.
Lampros and passed a senior whom he had failed in a required math course.

That student, Indira Fernandez, had missed dozens of class sessions and
failed to turn in numerous homework assignments, according to Mr.
Lampros’s meticulous records, which he provided to The New York Times.
She had not even shown up to take the final exam. She did, however,
attend the senior prom.

Through the intercession of Ms. Geiger, Miss Fernandez was permitted to
retake the final after receiving two days of personal tutoring from
another math teacher. Even though her score of 66 still left her with a
failing grade for the course as a whole by Mr. Lampros’s calculations,
Ms. Geiger gave the student a passing mark, which allowed her to
graduate.

Ms. Geiger declined to be interviewed for this column and said that
federal law forbade her to speak about a specific student’s performance.
But in a written reply to questions, she characterized her actions as
part of a “standard procedure” of “encouraging teachers to support
students’ efforts to achieve academic success.”

The issue here is not a violation of rules or regulations. Ms. Geiger
acted within the bounds of the teachers’ union’s contract with the city,
by providing written notice to Mr. Lampros of her decision.

No, the issue is more what this episode may say about the Department of
Education’s vaunted increase in graduation rates. It is possible, of
course, that the confrontation over Miss Fernandez was an aberration. It
is possible, too, that Mr. Lampros is the rare teacher willing to speak
on the record about the pressures from administrators to pass marginal
students, pressures that countless colleagues throughout the city
privately grumble about but ultimately cave in to, fearful of losing
their jobs if they object.

Mr. Lampros has resigned and returned to his home state, Michigan. The
principal and officials in the Department of Education say that he missed
24 school days during the last year for illness and personal reasons. He
missed two of the three sets of parent-teacher conferences. He also had
conflicts with an assistant principal, Antonio Arocho, over teaching
styles. Mr. Lampros said all of this was true.

Still, Mr. Lampros received a satisfactory rating five of the six times
administrators formally observed him. He has master’s degrees in both
statistics and math education and has won awards for his teaching at the
college level.

“It’s almost as if you stick to your morals and your ethics, you’ll end
up without a job,” Mr. Lampros said in an interview. “I don’t think every
school is like that. But in my case, it was.”

The written record, in the form of the minutely detailed charts Mr.
Lampros maintained to determine student grades, supports his account.
Colleagues of his from the school — a counselor, a programmer, several
fellow teachers — corroborated key elements of his version of events.
They also describe a principal worried that the 2006 graduation rate of
72.5 percent would fall closer to 50 or 60 percent unless teachers came
up with ways to pass more students.

After having failed to graduate with her class in June 2006, Miss
Fernandez, who, through her mother, declined to be interviewed, returned
to Arts and Technology last September for a fifth year. She was enrolled
in Mr. Lampros’s class in intermediate algebra. Absent for more than
two-thirds of the days, she failed, and that grade was left intact by
administrators.

When second semester began, Miss Fernandez again took the intermediate
algebra class, which fulfilled one of her graduation requirements.
According to Mr. Lampros’s records, she missed one-third of the classes,
arrived late for 20 sessions, turned in half the required homework
assignments, failed 11 of 14 tests and quizzes, and never took the final
exam.

Two days after the June 12 final, Miss Fernandez told Mr. Lampros that
she had a doctor’s note excusing her from school on the day of the exam,
he said. On June 18, she asked him if she had failed the class, and he
told her she had. The next day, the principal summoned Mr. Lampros to a
meeting with Miss Fernandez and her mother. He was ordered, he said, to
let her retake the final.

Mr. Arocho, the assistant principal, wrote in a letter to Mr. Lampros
that Miss Fernandez had a doctor’s note, issued March 15, permitting her
to miss school whenever necessary in the spring. Mr. Arocho did not
respond to telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment.

There is such a note, issued by Dr. Jason Faller, but it excused absences
“over the last three months” — that is, the period between mid-December
and mid-March. In a recent interview, Dr. Faller said he saw Miss
Fernandez only once, in March, and confirmed that his excuse note covered
absences only before March 15.

For whatever reason, school administrators misinterpreted the note and
told Mr. Lampros that Miss Fernandez would be allowed to retake the final
— and to retake it after having two days of one-on-one tutoring by
another math teacher, an advantage none of Mr. Lampros’s other students
had, he said.

Mr. Lampros, disgusted, did not come to school the next two days. Miss
Fernandez meanwhile took the test and scored a 66, which still left her
far short of a 65 average for the semester. Nonetheless, Mr. Arocho tried
to enter a passing mark for her. When he had to relent after objections
by the teachers’ union representative, Mr. Lampros was allowed to put in
the failing grade. Ms. Geiger promptly reversed it.

Samantha Fernandez, Indira’s mother, spoke on her behalf. “My daughter
earned everything she got,” she said. Of Mr. Lampros, she said, “He needs
to grow up and be a man.”

From Michigan, Mr. Lampros recalled one comment that Mrs. Fernandez made
during their meeting about why it was important for Indira to graduate.
She couldn’t afford to pay for her to attend another senior prom in
another senior year.

The 'atypical' dilemma: Skyrocketing numbers of kids are prescribed
powerful antipsychotic drugs. Is it safe? Nobody knows.
===================================================================

By ROBERT FARLEY, Times Staff Writer
Published July 29, 2007

------------------------------------------------------------------------

More and more, parents at wit's end are begging doctors to help them calm
their aggressive children or control their kids with ADHD. More and more,
doctors are prescribing powerful antipsychotic drugs.

In the past seven years, the number of Florida children prescribed such
drugs has increased some 250 percent. Last year, more than 18,000 state
kids on Medicaid were given prescriptions for antipsychotic drugs.

Even children as young as 3 years old. Last year, 1,100 Medicaid children
under 6 were prescribed antipsychotics, a practice so risky that state
regulators say it should be used only in extreme cases.

These numbers are just for children on fee-for-service Medicaid,
generally the poor and disabled. Thousands more kids on private insurance
are also on antipsychotics.

Almost entirely driving this spiraling trend is the rise of a class of
antipsychotic drugs called atypicals.

These drugs emerged in the 1990s and replaced the older, &quot;typical&quot;
antipsychotics like Haldol or Thorazine, which are often associated with
Parkinson-like shakes.

The atypicals were developed to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
in adults. But once on the market, doctors are free to prescribe them to
children, and for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

There is almost no research on the long-term effects of such powerful
medications on the developing brains of children. The more that
researchers learn, the less comfortable many are becoming with atypicals.

Initially billed as wonder drugs with few significant side effects,
evidence is mounting that they can cause rapid weight gain, diabetes,
even death.

They're also expensive. On average last year, it cost Medicaid nearly
$1,800 for each child on atypical antipsychotics. In the last seven
years, the cost to taxpayers for atypical antipsychotics prescribed to
children in Florida jumped nearly 500 percent, from $4.7-million to
$27.5-million.

Medicaid and insurance companies have fed the problem, encouraging the
use of psychiatric drugs as they reimburse less and less for
labor-intensive psychotherapy and occupational therapy.

Another factor: Doctors have been influenced by pharmaceutical companies,
which have aggressively marketed atypicals.

Whatever the reasons for the soaring use of psychiatric drugs in
children, things have gotten out of whack, according to Dr. Ronald Brown.
Last year he headed an American Psychological Association committee that
looked into the issue.

&quot;The bottom line is that the use of psychiatric medications far exceeds
the evidence of safety and effectiveness,&quot; Brown said.

&quot;What people need to do is what's in the best interest of children
instead of what's in the best interest of people's pocketbooks. But
children don't vote.&quot;

The ever-increasing number of kids who come through the doors of
pediatrician Esther Gonzalez's office lead chaotic lives. There's more
divorce and more drug use, more domestic violence and physical and sexual
abuse. Working parents are overwhelmed.

&quot;Some parents are so stressed out, they come in seeking a pill,&quot; Gonzalez
said. It is easy to medicate kids; &quot;it is very hard to change
environment.&quot;

At her practice in Crystal River, she starts with a thorough screening. A
child might need occupational, physical or speech therapy. Sometimes, it
takes psychiatric drugs.

Despite her concerns about prescribing such medications, Gonzalez has no
doubt they have saved many a child from juvenile detention.

Not prescribing drugs to a child who needs them, she said, &quot;it's like
seeing someone dying and not giving them CPR.&quot;

Among her patients is 7-year-old Matthew Peck of Brooksville. His
13-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister show scars on their arms and
legs where he has bitten them. He flies into rages, kicks, scratches and
pulls hair. He destroys furniture and punches holes in the wall.

His mom, Cathy Peck, said Matthew's doctors are &quot;leaning toward&quot; a
diagnosis of oppositional defiance disorder. And he has attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Matthew has taken a 5 mg dose of the atypical Abilify for over two months
now. He says &quot;the blue pill&quot; makes him feel like a different person,
someone nice.

Peck, a single mother on disability from the Army National Guard, says
she worries the drugs may become addictive. And diabetes runs in the
family, so that's a concern. Then again ... a few months ago Matthew got
hold of a steak knife and destroyed a chair.

&quot;Am I afraid of what the medications might do to him? Yes,&quot; Peck said.
&quot;But I am also afraid of what his life would be like without them.&quot;

Matthew and his brother are playing. Suddenly Matthew raises a hand to
hit him.

&quot;Gather!&quot; Cathy Peck yells, the trigger word to help Matthew calm
himself.

He lowers his hand, shambles over to his mother, curls up behind her.
Crisis avoided.

Matthew's 13-year-old sister, Marradith, said the Abilify works. &quot;He's a
different person. He's more fun to be around. He doesn't attack me
anymore.&quot;

The meds help, Mom says, but therapy is integral to Matthew's treatment.
She was taking him to eight sessions a week of occupational, speech and
language therapy.

Matthew recently had his last occupational therapy session - but not by
choice. After six years, Sensations Pediatrics Therapy in Brooksville
closed shop on June 15.

That last day of business, Sensations owner Jeff Leonbruno lamented how
hard it is for therapists to stay afloat. Particularly with pediatric
therapy sessions, he said, there is a high cancellation and no-show rate,
often four or five a day. If they don't show, he can't charge.

&quot;It's difficult to make a living at it,&quot; Leonbruno said.

Insurance companies and Medicaid don't pay enough for therapy, he said.
They do, however, pay to reimburse for psychiatric medications.

Over the years, he said, Medicaid priorities have shifted toward the
elderly in nursing homes. That has put a pinch on services like
occupational therapy for children with behavioral disorders.

&quot;There's no AARP for kids,&quot; he said.

Before the FDA approves a new drug, pharmaceutical companies must
demonstrate its safety and efficacy. The trials generally are done on
adults.

But once the drugs are on the market, doctors are free to prescribe the
drug &quot;off label,&quot; outside the scope of the FDA's indicated use. They also
can prescribe it to children.

Except for Risperdal, none of the antipsychotics is FDA-approved for
children. The overwhelming majority are prescribed &quot;off label.&quot;

&quot;It is alarming how frequently that is being done,&quot; Brown said. &quot;It's of
concern that it is being done at all.&quot;

A child's brain and central nervous system are still developing, so drugs
work differently on kids than adults, Brown said. &quot;There are no studies
that have shown they (atypicals) are safe, or for that matter, that they
are effective for children.&quot;

Drug companies have little incentive to invest in such studies, given
that their products already are widely prescribed to children off label.

The antipsychotics are FDA-approved for adults with schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder, which used to be known as manic depression. But a study
by the University of South Florida found that just 8 percent of Florida
children prescribed antipsychotics last year had a primary diagnosis of
schizophrenia, and 8 percent had major depression. The most common
diagnosis, 38 percent, was ADHD.

Even with bipolar disorder, there is considerable debate in the mental
health community about whether it is overdiagnosed, particularly in
younger children.

Dr. Mark Olfson of Columbia University studied the use of antipsychotics
in children and concluded that only a small percentage had psychotic
disorders. Most were used to treat mood disorders, depression, anxiety
and ADHD - by families and doctors who have tried everything else and are
ready to step outside the well-established treatments and take more
risks.

&quot;Most child psychiatrists would probably tell you it does work,&quot; Olfson
said. &quot;But there is a real need for research, clinical experiments, to
determine whether in fact it does work. Given the number of young people,
it is a matter of urgency.&quot;

Mental health practitioners say they use more antipsychotics now in part
because they are better able to identify some mental illnesses, including
autism.

Never mind that the National Autism Association warns against the overuse
of atypicals for children with autism. Last year, when Risperdal became
the first and only atypical approved for use in children - specifically
for irritability associated with autism - the association warned against
potentially serious side effects, including lactation in boys, weight
gain and development of an often irreversible movement disorder.

Rita Shreffler, the autism association's executive director, said
antipsychotics should be used only for dangerously aggressive children,
and even then only for a short &quot;leveling off period.&quot;

Dr. Randall Stafford, an associate professor of medicine at Stanford
Prevention Research Center, says off-label prescribing allows doctors the
latitude to innovate.

But Stafford was the lead author of a study that concluded that most
off-label medication occurs without enough scientific support.

Some prescriptions have become so common, he said, &quot;You have to ask,
'Where is the data to support this use of the drug?' It's not that these
off-label uses are dangerous. It's that we just don't know.&quot;

Kate Malloy knows what people will think: Every kid throws tantrums;
parents just need to discipline their children.

But with 10-year-old Ryan, she said, the outbursts were beyond
aggressive. He seemed outside himself.

A psychologist diagnosed bipolar disorder and recommended they see a
psychiatrist.

&quot;You are under the impression that when you go to the doctor you'll be
fixed,&quot; she said. &quot;And that isn't how it works. They don't, by any means,
have all the answers.&quot;

The ADHD medication Ryan was prescribed only inflamed things, and therapy
fell flat. They tried atypicals, first Risperdal. Then Zyprexa. Then
Seroquel.

&quot;In the beginning, when the meds weren't working, I hated them,&quot; she
said. &quot;I hated that they were the only option.&quot;

She took Ryan off all the medications and tried an alternative doctor,
who recommended dietary supplements. That worked, but only for a while.

She went to Dr. Mark Cavitt, medical director of pediatric psychiatry at
All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg.

He says mental health practitioners operate in gray areas. The unknowns
of the long-term effects of psychotropic drugs have to be balanced
against the risk of not treating.

Studies show that atypicals can be effective in modifying aggressive
behavior, he said, and that kids who are treated for depression and
schizophrenia are less likely to fall prey to pitfalls like drug abuse
and teen pregnancy. Then again: &quot;We have to be concerned. There is no
such thing as a benign psychiatric medication.&quot;

Dr. Cavitt prescribed Risperdal for Ryan. He couldn't tell when he was
full and gained 15 pounds. When Risperdal stopped working, they switched
to Abilify.

Mom hates to think about the possible long-term effects but has more
immediate concerns, like, &quot;Will he jump out of a moving car?&quot;

&quot;There are certainly downsides to medications,&quot; she said. &quot;But when
medications don't work, we are pretty much screwed. There are not a lot
of options.&quot;

* * *

At the Suncoast Center for Community Health in Clearwater, the focus is
on therapy. Drugs are a last resort.

Renee Kilroy, the clinical director, said the sharp increase in
psychotropic medications to children is unsettling. &quot;It's not my belief
we need to put more kids on medications. They are still growing and
changing.&quot;

Therapy costs more in the short term, she said, but a lifetime of
medications is costlier. Suncoast can afford to take the longer view
thanks to subsidies it gets from the county's Juvenile Welfare Board.

More and more, she said, they get referrals from the school system for
disruptive kids. Parents tell her that the school has told them their
children need to be put on psychiatric medication before they can come
back - even though state law specifically forbids that.

* * *

Children younger than 6 generally should not be given psychotropic drugs.
According to guidelines from the Florida Agency for Health Care
Administration, it should &quot;only be considered under the most
extraordinary of circumstances.&quot;

Last year, 1,111 Florida Medicaid children younger than 6 were prescribed
antipsychotics.

There is no recommendation for the use of antidepressants in children
younger than 6 - yet 629 children were prescribed antidepressants last
year.

Using stimulant medications for ADHD should be &quot;rare&quot; for kids younger
than 4, the guidelines state, &quot;and only after a failed behavioral
intervention such as parent training.&quot; Last year, 367 toddlers 3 and
younger were prescribed ADHD medications.

Cavitt said 3-year-olds put on psychotropic medications typically are
autistic, mentally retarded or brain injured. They are extremely
self-injurious or physically aggressive to others, he said.

Robert Whitaker, a journalist and author of the book Mad in America, says
there is no circumstance where it makes sense to prescribe an
antipsychotic drug to a 3-year-old.

&quot;It is not a scientific use of drugs,&quot; Whitaker said. &quot;It is an
experiment. There is no data showing that they are helpful in a
3-year-old kid. None. Zero. Zip.&quot;

Rather, he said, it is using medication as a controlling device. Whitaker
blames a system of &quot;assembly line medicine,&quot; where psychiatrists are
afforded less and less time with patients. Atypicals provide a shortcut
to dealing with unruly children.

&quot;It mutes your ability to respond to the world, emotionally and
physically,&quot; he said. &quot;They make them easier to manage, to others.&quot;

The pharmaceutical companies also help to shape the prescribing patterns,
he said. The law forbids them from openly marketing to children
off-label, but as any child psychiatrist will tell you, pharmaceutical
reps for the atypicals are regular visitors.

Psychiatrists like Cavitt say the reps know the line: They are there only
to provide company research and to solicit feedback on the use of their
medications.

But Whitaker said it's clear why the reps for atypicals are in the
offices of child psychiatrists: &quot;They do it because they know it's
effective in promoting off-label uses of their drugs.

&quot;They are publicly traded companies trying to maximize their revenues. It
increases off-label use, and doctors should quit pretending otherwise.&quot;

Minnesota is the only state that requires public reports of all drug
company marketing payments to doctors. A recent New York Times analysis
of those records found that doctors who took the most money from makers
of atypicals tended to prescribe the drugs to children the most.

The support group for people whose relatives have committed suicide was
unveiling a quilt with squares in memory of each person.

Kathy Pingleton was seated in a plastic chair in the back row when her
son's name was called.

&quot;Brandon Lee Pingleton.&quot;

Her husband, Ken, put his arm around her and they made their way to the
front.

Kathy stole a glance at the section of quilt she made in honor of
Brandon, a 15-year-old sophomore at Largo High School.

She worried that she made the square too busy. Lots of pictures and
buttons to show Brandon's love of football, soccer and karate.

Kathy reached out a hand to light a candle in his memory. On one finger
was a ring made of a guitar string that Brandon used. It reminds her of
his artistic side.

Nearly four years ago she and Ken found Brandon hanging in his bedroom,
just feet from where they were.

Diagnosed with ADHD, Brandon had landed in a county crisis center after
he overdosed on Robitussin and told authorities he was depressed.

When he was released from the center, mom remembers taking him to a
psychiatrist. After 5 minutes of evaluation - &quot;How are you sleeping? How
is school?&quot; - the doctor doubled his dosage of the atypical antipsychotic
Seroquel.

She remembers wondering why he was taking the drug when the Web site said
it was for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

She hated what the drugs did to him, as did Brandon. He said it made him
feel like a zombie.

Seroquel now carries a black box warning that antidepressants may
increase the risk of suicidal thoughts in children and teenagers, and
that patients should be watched closely.

Those warnings didn't come until 2004. Brandon hanged himself in 2003.

Alan Levine ran the state's Agency for Health Care Administration in
2005. He became so alarmed by the spike in antipsychotics prescribed to
children that he contracted with USF to study the trend.

The study found that from mid 2002 to mid 2004, the cost of psychotropic
drug prescriptions for kids increased 60 percent. Pacing that increase
was an 82 percent jump in spending on atypical antipsychotics.

&quot;It has very quietly grown as a problem,&quot; Levine said.

He wanted to reel it in, but not in a knee-jerk way that might hurt kids
who need medications. &quot;There needs to be a more sane and evidence-based
approach when prescribing these drugs to children.&quot;

The use of antidepressants and ADHD medications dropped and the growth of
antipsychotics slowed over a two-year period, starting in April 2004.

By then, said Robert Constantine at USF's Louis De La Parte Mental Health
Institute, any psychiatrist would have been aware of the metabolic side
effects of the new antipsychotics, and, for those taking antidepressants,
the dangers of suicidal feelings.

As part of the $3-million state grant, USF was charged with sending out
letters to physicians who were regularly prescribing outside the accepted
guidelines.

For example, in the first quarter of this year, 315 children on Medicaid
got antipsychotics at higher-than-recommended dosage levels.

Another common problem, Constantine said, was the practice of prescribing
more than one antipsychotic at a time. Some doctors swear it works, but
there isn't much scientific evidence to back that up. The first three
months this year, 274 children were prescribed two or more antipsychotics
for an extended period.

Joanne Mills' 12-year-old son was on 16 medications. At the same time.

&quot;At the time we decided to put him on each one of them there was a good
reason for it, or else we wouldn't have done it,&quot; said Mills, a mother of
six in Homosassa.

In the last year, by integrating therapy, she said they have cut her
son's 16 medications to three, including the atypical Seroquel.

He has been diagnosed with ADHD and occasionally explosive behavior. For
three years, she had to hold him for three hours a night so he could
sleep.

Frustrated to the nth degree, she says you walk into the doctor's office
with a bubble of hope, and walk out 15 minutes later with a handful of
prescriptions, for drugs you've tried before without any lasting benefit.

&quot;The doctors throw their hands up in the air and say, 'I don't know what
else to try.' &quot;

About the numbers

Most of the statistics in this story are derived from Medicaid data
provided by Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration.

The agency provided the same data to the University of South Florida,
which was contracted by the state to study prescribing patterns. As a
public service, USF prepared an analysis of the state's data for the St.
Petersburg Times.

The numbers include only children on fee-for-service Medicaid. They do
not include children in Medicaid HMOs or those with private insurance.

Some 720,000 children were in the fee-for-service Medicaid program last
year, out of some 4.5-million children in Florida. That means the
statistics in this story vastly underestimate the entire picture of
antipsychotic medications prescribed to children.

The Medicaid numbers were used because the program is taxpayer-funded and
the information is public.

The atypicals

A new class of drugs emerged in the 1990s, touted as a better and safer
way to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Here are the atypicals
now on the market.

Trade name Drug name Marketed by

Clozaril Clozapine Novartis

For schools, what does progress mean? Nevada has one idea, the feds
another
===================================================================

By Emily Richmond &lt;em ... @vegas.com&gt;
Las Vegas Sun

It makes all the sense in the world that poorly performing students
should be rewarded when they start doing better. But let's say a good
student also improves. What kind of reward should he get?

That question goes to the heart of a philosophical debate between the
state's school bosses and the federal government.

Nevada says: Give kudos to a school where all the students score higher
than last year's crop, even if last year's test results were
satisfactory.

The feds say: Credit for &quot;adequate yearly progress&quot; should go just to
those schools where the lowest-performing students do better and start
closing in on the higher achievers.

That's the basic law as it stands. Nevada wants to get an exception but
hasn't had any luck. And now it is about to take matters into its own
hands.

&quot;The goal for Nevada's educators is to take every student, regardless of
their current level of achievement, and move them forward,&quot; said Paul
LaMarca, the state education department's top administrator for research
and accountability. &quot;It's important to move a student who is struggling
for proficiency. At the same time it's very important to move a student
who is proficient beyond that point, to exceeding our standards.&quot;

The federal education department is allowing eight states to do what
Nevada wants - to use alternative assessments to measure student
progress, known as a &quot;growth model.&quot; But none is going as far as Nevada
is proposing: to add points for schools where already-proficient students
improve.

Schools would receive credit for making substantial progress, even if
minimum test score requirements were not met. But the U.S. Education
Department said no.

&quot;The feds apparently felt that we would be enabling schools to compensate
for students that did not meet standards by giving those schools credit
for the higher achievers,&quot; LaMarca said. &quot;That's just a difference of
opinion.&quot;

U.S. Education Secretary Margaret Spellings says the states being allowed
to join the growth model pilot program were still meeting &quot;the
bright-line principles of the law to strengthen accountability.&quot;

Nevada educators, resigned to the federal government's refusal to cut the
state any slack, have come up with a solution that, if nothing else,
could boost morale. It will measure student progress two ways - the feds'
way and Nevada's way.

At issue is the Bush administration's education reform law, which took
effect in 2002 - the No Child Left Behind Act.

Its underlying goal is to close the achievement gap dividing the nation's
poor and minority students from their more affluent white peers.

No Child Left Behind requires public schools to show adequate yearly
progress on standardized tests, with 100 percent of students
demonstrating proficiency in reading, writing and math by the 2013-14
academic year.

Schools must show gains overall and by subgroups of students, including
those in special education, those with limited English proficiency, and
those in particular ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Nevada educators
have long argued that the goals, though admirable, are unrealistic in a
state with a fast-growing student population that includes thousands of
English language learners.

The switch to the growth model has been approved for just eight states -
Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, North Carolina and
Virginia.

Although &quot;there are many different routes for states to take ... all must
lead to closing the achievement gap and every student reaching grade
level by 2014,&quot; Spellings said. &quot;We are open to new ideas, but when it
comes to accountability, we are not taking our eye off the ball.&quot;

This year, Nevada's public schools will still be measured the way they
don't like. And next time around, schools will have to show even better
performance, because the achievement benchmarks are set to increase.

Individual states were given some leeway in figuring out how to get all
their students to meet the benchmarks.

Some states opted for raising the bar in small annual increases. Others,
including Nevada, gave schools several years to adjust to the new
standards - and will demand big improvements down the road.

For example, next summer, the percentage of elementary school students in
Nevada who must be proficient in reading and writing will move to about
52 percent, up from nearly 40 percent this year. And 56 percent of those
students will have to be proficient in math, up from 45 percent.

Results from the most recent round of testing in Clark County, and the
resulting school rankings, will be released today. Charlene Green,
associate superintendent of student support services for the School
District, said she fully supports the switch to a growth model for
assessment, the one the feds won't allow for Nevada.

&quot;We should get credits for all of our students who succeed,&quot; Green said.
&quot;Kids at the top who are striving to be exemplary are working just as
hard as the kids who are trying to move out of the bottom quartile.&quot;

No Child Left Behind has resulted in a stigma of sorts for schools that
continually fail to meet the objectives. After two years of low test
scores a school is designated as &quot;needs improvement.&quot; The same label is
assigned whether the performance shortfall was in all areas, or solely
because a handful of students were absent on test day and a statistical
requirement for student participation was not met.

State education officials know that such labels have become a source of
consternation. And to compensate, or at least provide another assessment
of performance, Nevada plans to hand out two sets of results for the
2007-08 academic year.

The first set will be based on the requirements set down under No Child
Left Behind. The second set will use a more flexible growth model that
takes into account a variety of factors, such as changes in student
population.

&quot;Measuring growth is probably a better reflection of school effectiveness
than just measuring status,&quot; LaMarca said.

That's not to say that the list of needs improvement schools will be
dramatically shorter using the growth model, LaMarca said.

&quot;The growth model is not a panacea for schools,&quot; LaMarca said. &quot;If
anything, it's more rigorous. Moving kids forward is hard to do.&quot;

The federal education department's rejection is the latest blow to
Nevada's public schools. In June the state learned it would receive $2
million less in funding for its English language learners, based on the
feds' calculations that fewer students qualified than in prior years.
That decision attracted the attention of Rep. Jon Porter, R-Nev., who
said he is asking for a meeting with state and federal education
officials to get the money back - and get the feds to reexamine how they
make such decisions.

As for Nevada's desire to revise how it assesses student progress, Porter
noted that &quot;now is the perfect time to look into that,&quot; because the
federal education law is up for reauthorization.

Turmoil at Another Progressive College
======================================

Another progressive college is in a crisis. After the Western Association
of Schools and Colleges placed the college on probation in July, some at
New College of California, founded in 1971 and “committed to education in
support of a just, sacred, and sustainable world,” are undertaking the
process of upturning the entire leadership – with supporters seeing the
shake-up as their best opportunity to save the San Francisco college.

“The administration at New College and specifically the president have
been needing to go for a very long time,” said Richard Heinberg, who
teaches in the Culture, Ecology and Sustainable Community Program.

“Potentially, this action by WASC is a very good thing as long as we can
survive the process of transition. The difficulty is that the publicity
is going to make it difficult to recruit students in the meantime and
since we have no endowment, we really are living for tuition. If
enrollments fall significantly, that could endanger the college right
there.”

New College of California, which, according to its president, depends on
tuition for 95 percent of its budget, finds itself at this crossroads as
the closure of Antioch College’s main undergraduate institution focuses
attention on the particular vulnerability of progressive colleges, which
tend to feature small enrollments, individualized instruction and a
commitment to producing alumni engaged in socially responsible, if not
fiscally rewarding, careers. With a historic focus on non-traditional
education, New College’s graduate and undergraduate program offerings
today include women’s spirituality, teacher education, activism and
social change, and experimental performance.

The college has repeatedly tangled with its accreditor in the past, with
this month’s action coming a year, its president said, after it was
removed from warning. A July 5 letter from the Western Association to the
college’s president of seven years, Martin J. Hamilton, documents an
ongoing financial crisis about as old as the college itself and a
“pervasive failure” in proper recordkeeping. WASC also notes concerns
about academic integrity at the college, including a “routine” reliance
upon independent study that operates outside of published criteria or
oversight. The accrediting body indicates that it found “substantial
evidence of violations” of its first standard, that an institution
“function with integrity.” (The letter is available on the San Francisco
Bay Guardian’s blog).

“The commission found that underlying the matters explored in the special
investigation is a lack of effective leadership and required governance
structures,” the letter reads, describing a lack of faculty oversight and
a governance system “rife with unilateral assertions of authority by the
president and others. Persons that should be empowered to oversee the
integrity of matters within their domains, including such matters [as]
student tuition payment, international student status reporting and
admission processing, have been undermined by persons in higher-level
positions who have usurped their authority.”

“The basic criticisms that they made to us, which are that our
administration needs a drastic overhaul…we agree with that view,” said
Adam Cornford, a 21-year faculty veteran who teaches poetics and one of
two elected faculty representatives to a transition team approved by the
Board of Trustees. Both a newly forming Core Faculty Council and Adjunct
Faculty Council have endorsed a change in leadership, including at the
trustee level.

“The commission would not be satisfied with simply an expansion of the
board, nor with the current president staying on for any significant
length of time. The bulk of the old board, which they said had been
extremely negligent, and also the president, should step down at once,
and we should begin to search for an interim president,” Cornford said.
He added a new interim vice president for academics also should be named
and empowered to hire a new registrar, financial aid director and
admissions director.

“There’s probably going to be a clean sweep of the administration and all
but four or five members of the board. That’s what we’re expecting and
that’s what we support,” said Cornford.

“The board is really trying to take more control of the whole situation,
and it’s very tense and upsetting to everybody because the college has
been a ‘came from the 60s,’ community-based organization,” President
Hamilton said Tuesday. “That’s part of what the criticism is really
about, that we didn’t build the proper systems that would allow more
regularized activity to support and [provide] oversight of different
functions.”

“A lot of it is a lack of money. We just don’t have reserve funds. We’ve
never had reserve funds. It’s really been built one year at a time.” The
1,000-student college has about a $16 million operating budget.

Hamilton, who has been at the college for 30 years, since arriving at age
26, intends to step down within the year pending the appointment of an
interim leader. The board has already named an interim chief financial
officer: Up until now, Hamilton has essentially assumed both the
presidential and CFO duties. The board also moved to double its size at a
recent meeting, form a presidential search committee and acknowledge and
work with the new Faculty Council.

“The college is going to change, and it’s going to change dramatically.
My role is already changing very quickly,” Hamilton said. “Historically
this community has kept the college going.”

What’s at stake, he said, is “how to preserve the best elements that make
New College so beautiful and at the same time share the responsibilities
more. Certainly, there was way too much responsibility on my shoulders.”

“I’ve virtually controlled the college for many years and have tried to
do the best I can.”

Yet, it’s precisely that cloud of long-term, near-unilateral control that
student and faculty leaders say is what most needs lifting. “The people
who are most prominent in governance of the school have been around for a
long time and have a very clear sense of what the school should be and
it’s been difficult for faculty particularly, but people who are not
members of the inner circle [more generally] to get other points of view
into it,” said Harry Britt, a faculty member in the interdisciplinary
studies program.

“The same people who presided over all these problems happening, we don’t
think they can solve it,” added Jeremy Zimmer, a master’s student in the
activism and social change program and one of the organizers of an
“Interim Independent Student Council” forming in response to the WASC
action.

“Many of us, despite being severely underpaid, and working in difficult
conditions, have stayed here because we believe in the mission of the
college,” said Cornford. “We have an enormous amount of human capital to
draw on as soon as we can get the kind of leadership and support that we
need.”

“It is a unique institution and we should solve these problems… There are
people standing by to help the college, financially and otherwise — to
join the board, to help us raise funds and donate funds — as soon as they
have confidence in the leadership and the trusteeship.”

‘Play It Smart’ High School Program Is Putting Some Players on Track
====================================================================

By PETE THAMEL

Ray Rice is a punishing tailback for Rutgers who earned his prep
reputation at New Rochelle High School outside New York City.

DeSean Jackson is an explosive wide receiver at California who went to
Berkeley from the powerhouse program at Long Beach Polytechnic High
School in the Los Angeles area.

They are being cited as leading contenders for the Heisman Trophy this
college football season and, despite being opposite coasts, they are
bound in another way.

Both are graduates of Play It Smart, a nonprofit program sponsored by the
National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame to help football
players in inner-city schools with their studies.

“It helped me out a lot,” Rice said. “It helped me balancing academics
and school work at the same time. It’s one of those things that every
high school program should have. If a kid is going to go Division I, they
need to be guided.”

Since being founded in 1998, Play It Smart has expanded to 136 high
schools throughout the country. There are more than 200 Play It Smart
graduates in Division I-A football, including seven at Rutgers.

Rice and Jackson said that Play It Smart offered them a taste of college
life before they walked on campus. They were introduced to academic
counselors and tutors, and were taught time-management skills.

“The Play It Smart program definitely helped me manage my time,” Jackson
said. “We had practice at a certain time. We couldn’t practice until we
had our study hall out of the way. It was like being a freshman in
college.”

At New Rochelle High School, the Play It Smart program is based in a team
room 10 feet from the office of the football coach, Lou DiRienzo. Since
the Play It Smart program began at New Rochelle in 2004, its office has
served as a gateway to the football field.

Any student who wants to play for New Rochelle has his classwork tracked
by Andy Capellan, a retired principal at the school with a low tolerance
for nonsense.

If football players cut class, they sit out practice. If they are
struggling in a subject, an honors student tutors them. The results at
New Rochelle have transcended simply helping star athletes like Rice and
his Rutgers teammates Glen Lee and Courtney Greene receive Division I
scholarships.

“Last year’s team, we didn’t lose one kid on the varsity to eligibility,”
Capellan said. “We used to get clobbered in terms of eligibility.”

Capellan said that the program had helped send five New Rochelle players
to Division I universities since 2004.

He said that before this run of players, he could not recall a football
player from New Rochelle accepting a Division I-A scholarship for nearly
20 years.

“Most of them weren’t even graduating,” Capellan said. “And it’s not that
we didn’t have anyone stellar or outstanding.”

At New Rochelle, a school of 3,200 students, Capellan said that the
counselors did not have a lot of time to sit and explain to student
athletes what the N.C.A.A. academic minimums were in order to earn
college scholarships.

Capellan meets with the students in Play It Smart and their parents
before the start of each season to lay out the specific classes and
grades needed. The results of those talks and the subsequent academic
support and preparation for the SAT through the program have been
apparent.

“There’s not just kids going Division I and becoming Heisman Trophy
candidates,” DiRienzo said. “There’s kids going to Division II and
Division III schools because of the emphasis put on academics through
athletics.

“There’s more kids not just settling for high school diplomas and moving
on.”

The program is paid for by a $30,000 grant to each school, although that
number can be tailored to fit the needs of a school. Capellan, who also
coaches girls track and cross country, said he was supposed to work 12
hours a week to earn his $10,000 salary from Play It Smart as an academic
coach.

But with meetings with players, teachers and parents, running study halls
and tracking academics, he said that he worked close to 30 hours. (The
other money goes to resources like computers and SAT prep.)

Steve Hatchell, the president and chief executive of the National
Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame, said that it was
the consistent presence and dedication of people like Capellan in schools
that had helped make Play It Smart so successful.

“In 10 years, we’ve proven that this works,” Hatchell said. “There’s no
in-between. We don’t just come in and say, ‘Hello, we hope you’re doing
well.’ We’re there and we care about you and we want you to graduate.”

The program’s sponsors include a $1.1 million annual donation from the
N.F.L. and the N.F.L. Players Association, and $800,000 from the
Department of Justice. The Chick-fil-A Bowl announced last week that it
would give $180,000 annually to provide all the public high schools in
Atlanta with the program. N.C.A.A. Football and the New Balance
Foundation each give $100,000 a year.

Hatchell said spreading the word about the program’s success was nearly
as important as financing, but there is a long list of high schools
hoping to receive a grant to establish the program.

“You wish you could get to Oprah and others just to make people aware of
the program,” Hatchell said.

As for how the program translates on the field in college, Rice and
Jackson said they went to college prepared for the academic rigors. That
helped each player focus on the field, where they contributed
significantly as freshmen.

California Coach Jeff Tedford and Rutgers Coach Greg Schiano said they
were pleased with how each player handled their studies as soon as they
arrived on campus.

“Ray got his work ethic from his mother, Janet, and his upbringing,”
Schiano said. “You take a guy like Ray and then you give him some
organizational skills and time-management skills to go along with it, you
get a really productive student athlete. That’s what he is.”

Rice has committed to giving back to the program. Markell Rice, Ray’s
brother, is a senior at New Rochelle and in the Play It Smart program.
Capellan said Markell Rice struggled early in high school, cut classes
and was not focused academically.

Ray Rice went back to New Rochelle from Rutgers as part of a sit-down
meeting to help focus his brother in school.

Capellan said Markell Rice had overcome his early problems and was in
line for a scholarship, probably from a midmajor school.

“I definitely see myself giving back to Play It Smart,” Ray Rice said.

“Whatever I can do. Even if I can go back now and talk to the kids, I’d
do what I can to help them.”
