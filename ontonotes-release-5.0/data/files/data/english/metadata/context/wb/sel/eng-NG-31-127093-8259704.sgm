&gt; Gay Couple Guilty of Child Sex Crimes

&gt; http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/188974.php

&gt; (Hartford, Michigan) In June 2007, two former foster parents and
&gt; same-sex couple, Kurt Alfred Amundson, 42, and Robert George Shafer, 43,
&gt; were indicted by a federal grand jury for alleged sexual exploitation of
&gt; a child and possession of child pornography.

&gt; Both were charged with exploiting a child by producing images of a young
&gt; boy engaged in sexually explicit conduct. It seems the boy, described as
&gt; under 13 years old, was a foster child of Amundson and Shafer.

&gt; In the latest development, both Amundson and Shafer have pleaded guilty
&gt; in U.S. District Court in Grand Rapids to producing images of a minor
&gt; engaging in sexually explicit conduct.

&gt;      Investigators found several images of child pornography, including
&gt; images of a child befriended by the two men, on computers, cameras, CDs
&gt; and floppy disks seized from the Hartford men's residence in June 2006,
&gt; according to a news release.

&gt;      Authorities said the two were licensed as foster-care providers and
&gt; were in the process of adopting a child for whom they were serving as
&gt; foster parents. The foster child and the child befriended by the two men
&gt; alleged that Shafer and Amundson sexually assaulted them, according to
&gt; the news release.

Notably, Amundson was heralded as a homosexual foster parent in a 2003
article, &quot;The Changing Face of the American Family.&quot;
When asked about his role as a same-sex foster parent he said
mentoring children was not satisfying enough for him.
&quot;It was helpful, but I wanted to carry the relationship beyond
that,&quot; he said in the article.
Apparently, he did.

&gt; Shafer and Amundson are scheduled to be sentenced, respectively, in
&gt; October and November. They each face a mandatory minimum 15 years in
&gt; prison with a maximum 30 years. Fines of up to $250,000 are also possible.

Why such a light sentence?  15-30?
Are there a bunch of STATE charges waiting to be prosecuted as well?

The number of Foster PEDERASTS is overwhelming!

The &quot;social worker mentality&quot; that gays are safer parents is melting
away.
