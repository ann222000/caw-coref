How tied to Michael is Ralf? Is his future soon to be done in F1 with the
retiring of his brother? Did Michael bring Ralf in?

Ralf SUCKS!!! Ralf is the Christian Fittipaldi of F1.
Using family coattails to get into the sport and produce no results.
Christian Fittipaldi. 1997-2001 same team ? I believe 2 wins?
How many did Michael and Da Matta rack up in that same time period?

I've always thought Christian Fittipaldi was the Christian Fittipaldi of F1
(BTW - hauling the lemon that was the '94 Footwork to two 4th places wasn't
too shabby).

Does Ralf really suck? On his day he's one of the better drivers - he's
certainly one of the quickest. The trouble is his days seem to tend to
happen between races.

I'm no fan of Ralf's but I think he's done enough - wins, places etc in cars
that weren't that great - for the 'only in on his brother's coattails'
accusation to be laid to rest. His only real problem is consistency - or the
lack of it, and that is probably what's going to cost him in the end.

I think that is right. He is not as good as Michael, nobody would
seriously claim that he is, which makes it very difficult for him, but
he is certainly easily good enough to justify being in F1.

Wasn't my angle. My question was in regards to the teams' view of Ralf being
tied to Michael's talent and name.

He has done as well or better than most midfielders at least.
Certainly, Michael had a big part in Ralf being able to extort a
ridiculous amount of money for his services, but that's just business.
The name sells, it will still sell for a while and as the M.Schumacher
name fades from memory so will his contract power, but Ralf is no
slouch and now seems to enjoy himself at Toyota, so IMO, he will be
retained for a while yet.

Still a name recognition bait and switch for the sponsors, but with
Michael no longer providing the marketing capital Ralf will surely
suffer.
