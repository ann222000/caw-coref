I see Mark and Roger have turned rrap into a cesspool once again. These
birds-of-a-feather deserve one another and are obviously like-minded and of
similar intellect.

Wow Markie, you did have a post or two, but it was under "an old
friend", not under an_old_friend, so as I said another variable sock,
therefore, no apology is necessary.  However, how does posting once or
twice equate to being a "frequent poster".  You are a frequent post
here, even excessive, but I would not say that you a frequent poster
on the moderated group, there are people posting far more than you.
How come you can control yourself on the moderated group but you can't
seem to do so here?  Or are they controlling your posting behavior?
Based on your past posting patterns, I would say that you are probably
being kept in check by the moderators.

Have to make a correction, Markie you have posted a total of three

The likelihood is You are more than 99.9% correct.

If Mark didn't thread-hijack, and spam this newsgroup with "yet another
stalking post" every 15 seconds, RRAP would be a remarkably quiet place. The
beauty of the moderated group is it prevents him from spamming the newsgroup
with nonsense.

Naturally, there are mechanisms in place to prevent him from doing that here
too. For example, someone with a linux box could run a robo-moderation
program and automatically inject cancellation control messages into the
USENET newsstream whenever one of his postings appears. This is commonly
referred to as a "USENET Kiss Of Death".

Occasionally Mark can make some coherent, even useful, postings worth
discussing. Unfortunately these seem to be few and far between, for reasons
that elude most of us.

&gt;Won't work.  Cancel messages are ignored by the great majority of news
&gt;servers these days, due to past abuse of them by Usenet warriors.  Most
&gt;of the remaining news servers require that a cancel message be
&gt;cryptographically signed with a pre-approved private key before the
&gt;messages will be removed.  Even in those cases, the verification

&gt;messages still don't get canceled.
