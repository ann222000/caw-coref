-- Proverbs 3:5-6 --
Trust in the LORD with all your heart
and lean not on your own understanding;
in all your ways acknowledge him,
and he will make your paths straight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----
We commonly mistake our personal emotions, feelings and sensations for God's
will, but ultimately it is God's will that is done. In the end, true faith
acknowledges that and rejoices in it! Bring your decisions to God in prayer; use
the Bible as your guide; and then follow God's leading. He will make your paths
straight by both guiding and protecting you.

September 2nd - St. William of Roskilde B (AC)

Died 1067.

An Anglo-Saxon priest named William became court chaplain to King Canute of
England (1016-1035) and Denmark. Journeying to Denmark with the king, he was
shocked by the ignorance, idolatry, and superstition he found. He decided that
the missionary needs of that land were enormous, and stayed there for the rest
of his life. Eventually William was named bishop of Roskilde, Zeeland, upon the
recommendation of Canute. To live on terms of great friendship with the royal
family was no easy task for a bishop who wished also to witness to the demands
of the Christian Gospel, for Canute's successor, King Sweyn Estridsen, in spite
of many good qualities, was a headstrong, willful man who several times greatly
offended against Christian virtue.

William managed to rebuke the king-once risking his own life in doing so-and to
remain in the end the king's good friend. Sweyn Estridsen stoned to death a
number of men who, whether guilty or not, should have been granted first a fair
trial. To add to his sin, Sweyn had done this in a church, violating its
sanctuary. Saint William decreed that a person who had shed blood unjustly could
receive no sacrament of the church until he had done public penance.

King Sweyn came to the saint's cathedral with armed men. William stood at the
door, armed only with his crozier, and refused the king entry. The armed men
drew their swords, at which the saint offered them his neck, ready to sacrifice
himself for the Christian faith. Sweyn asked forgiveness, offering property to
the church as a token of his great shame.

In his private life the king infringed the moral laws of the church by marrying
his own stepdaughter. Repeatedly William remonstrated. He sought and received
the public support of the archbishop of Hamburg. But only after both pope and
Holy Roman Emperor had also censured the king did Sweyn put aside his unlawful
wife.

Yet the two men clearly loved each other, in spite of differences. Sweyn died
first (1070). As his body was being carried to Roskilde cathedral from its first
buried site in Ringsted Abbey, the saint, clearly heart-broken, met the cortege
and himself fell dead. The bodies of both men were then buried together in
Roskilde cathedral (Benedictines, Bentley, Farmer).

Quote:
All perfection is founded upon only two principles, by means of which, with due
attention to the daily actions suited to our state, we shall certainly arrive at
the summit and fullness of it.  The first principle is a very low esteem for all
created things, but, above all, for ourselves.  This low esteem should show
itself, in practice, by renouncing ourselves and all creatures; in our hearts,
by a firm resolution; and in our lives, in such ways as may be suitable,
especially by manifesting contentment and cheerfulness when the Lord takes from
us any good.  The second principle is a very high esteem of God, which may be
easily acquired by the light of faith, as He is Omnipotent, the Supreme Good and
our End; as also because He has loved us so much, and is ever present with us,
and guides us in all things, both as to nature and grace, and, in particular,
has called us and leads us by a special vocation to a lofty perfection.
-Fr. Achille Gagliardi

Bible Quote
Save us, O Lord, our God: and gather us from among nations: That we may give
thanks to thy holy name, and may glory in thy praise.  (Psalms 105:47)

Gospel Canticle

Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;
He has come to His people and set them free.
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,
born of the house of His servant David.
Through His holy prophets He promised of old
that He would save us from our enemies,
from the hands of all who hate us.
He promised to show mercy to our fathers
and to remember His holy covenant.
This was the oath He swore to our father Abraham:
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,
free to worship Him without fear,
holy and righteous in His sight
all the days of our life.
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;
for you will go before the Lord to prepare His way,
to give His people knowledge of salvation
by the forgiveness of their sins.
In the tender compassion of our God
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,
to shine on those who dwell in darkness
and the shadow of death,
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.
- Luke 1:68-79
