Pastor charged with 11 counts of sexual exploitation of children
.: posted ::: by .:webmaster:. :::

Camden SC - Northgate Colonial Baptist Church members say they need their faith
now more than ever.

The church is trying to hold itself together while its popular pastor, the Rev.
Kevin Ogle, sits in jail in Walton County, Ga., charged with 11 counts of sexual
exploitation of children.

&quot;We're a family,&quot; said Mike Clifton, head of the church's board of deacons. &quot;We
are there for each other. We keep each other lifted up.&quot;

The 42-year-old Ogle is accused of sending pornographic messages and pictures of
himself over the Internet to a police officer posing as a teenage girl.

Ogle's congregation is praying for their leader and have organized meals for his
wife and young children. Members say there hasn't been a time since the case
broke Feb. 20 that they lost hope.

&quot;We felt like we could go forward at once, that the Lord was on our side,&quot; said
Evora Price, a member for nearly 20 years.

The night Ogle was arrested, Price and other members were called to the church
for an emergency meeting. &quot;As a congregation, and as Christians, we have to
focus on what God wants us to focus on,&quot; Clifton said.

Clifton has become &quot;the rock of the church,&quot; Margaret Sowell said.

&quot;A lot of them are hurting, and hurting very deeply, and it is just going to
take time,&quot; Clifton said. Healing &quot;is not going to happen overnight.&quot;

Experts say a pastor's missteps of any kind shake a congregation's trust.

It's a kind of &quot;a betrayal of sacred trust,&quot; said the Rev. Tony Everett, a
professor of pastoral care at the Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary in
Columbia.

Everett has worked with congregations to heal after such conflict. The most
successful churches, he said, ask hard questions and work through the roller
coaster of denial, anger, grief and sadness.

The ones that just &quot;want to put it behind them&quot; rarely succeed, he said.
Complete healing &quot;may take a generation.&quot;

Clifton hopes his church can emerge from the adversity stronger.

&quot;I think an event like this, if it is handled in the right way, will make us
more cohesive and stronger than we were before,&quot; Clifton said. &quot;I think it shows
how weak we can get sometimes if we don't stay part of the group and rely on
everybody - and especially God.&quot;

&quot;He's a fucking race traitor.  Kill him, his spic pet, and the
demon spawn they created.&quot;
-- jonez/vox/ultra/whatever

&quot;Kent Wills married a spic named Joquina Cruz.  They have two
half-breed children.  All of them should be put to death.  First the
race traitor Kent, then the genetic misfits they produced, then the
pet spic.

&quot;Kent has committed the greatest crime imaginable.  He
betrayed his own race!&quot;

FYI, dullard, Lindsay's real name isn't Joquina.

&quot;Death to Kent Wills and all race traitors!&quot;

Exodus 20:16 &quot;Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.&quot;

PART THREE - LIFE IN CHRIST

SECTION TWO - THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

CHAPTER TWO - ARTICLE 8

THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT

You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.253
It was said to the men of old, &quot;You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform
to the Lord what you have sworn.&quot;254

The eighth commandment forbids misrepresenting the truth in our relations with
others. This moral prescription flows from the vocation of the holy people to
bear witness to their God who is the truth and wills the truth. Offenses against
the truth express by word or deed a refusal to commit oneself to moral
uprightness: they are fundamental infidelities to God and, in this sense, they
undermine the foundations of the covenant.

&quot;Each one deceives the other, no one speaks the truth. They have accustomed
their tongues to lying, and are perverse, and cannot repent.&quot; [Jer. 9:5 [4]]

2476 False witness and perjury. When it is made publicly, a statement contrary
to the truth takes on a particular gravity. In court it becomes false
witness.276 When it is under oath, it is perjury. Acts such as these contribute
to condemnation of the innocent, exoneration of the guilty, or the increased
punishment of the accused.277 They gravely compromise the exercise of justice
and the fairness of judicial decisions.
2477 Respect for the reputation of persons forbids every attitude and word
likely to cause them unjust injury.278 He becomes guilty:

- of rash judgment who, even tacitly, assumes as true, without sufficient
foundation, the moral fault of a neighbor;

- of detraction who, without objectively valid reason, discloses another's
faults and failings to persons who did not know them;279

- of calumny who, by remarks contrary to the truth, harms the reputation of
others and gives occasion for false judgments concerning them.

2482 &quot;A lie consists in speaking a falsehood with the intention of
deceiving.&quot;281 The Lord denounces lying as the work of the devil: &quot;You are of
your father the devil, . . . there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks
according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.&quot;282

2483 Lying is the most direct offense against the truth. To lie is to speak or
act against the truth in order to lead someone into error. By injuring man's
relation to truth and to his neighbor, a lie offends against the fundamental
relation of man and of his word to the Lord.

2484 The gravity of a lie is measured against the nature of the truth it
deforms, the circumstances, the intentions of the one who lies, and the harm
suffered by its victims. If a lie in itself only constitutes a venial sin, it
becomes mortal when it does grave injury to the virtues of justice and charity.

2485 By its very nature, lying is to be condemned. It is a profanation of
speech, whereas the purpose of speech is to communicate known truth to others.
The deliberate intention of leading a neighbor into error by saying things
contrary to the truth constitutes a failure in justice and charity. The
culpability is greater when the intention of deceiving entails the risk of
deadly consequences for those who are led astray.

2486 Since it violates the virtue of truthfulness, a lie does real violence to
another. It affects his ability to know, which is a condition of every judgment
and decision. It contains the seed of discord and all consequent evils. Lying is
destructive of society; it undermines trust among men and tears apart the fabric
of social relationships.

Dictum vel factum vel concupitum contra legem æternam

This two-fold pain in punishment of mortal sin is eternal (1 Corinthians 6:9;
Matthew 25:41; Mark 9:45). One mortal sin suffices to incur punishment. (See
HELL.) &lt;= Kent Wills, take note!
