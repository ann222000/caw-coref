Memorial Exhibit of the Week

MILESTONES TO RECOVERY ***1/2 (out of four)
Historic Battery Park
Through September 30
Admission: free
http://www.nyc.gov
Daily News photographer and native New Yorker Susan Watts documents Lower
Manhattan¹s recovery from the events of 9/11 in &quot;Milestones to Recovery,&quot;
thirty large-scale photographs that run along the fence aroundthe Battery
Park lawn. Billed as a &quot;photographic celebration of the rebirth and
revitalization of Lower Manhattan&quot; and sponsored by the Alliance for
Downtown New York, the exhibit shows how tourists, people from the
neighborhood, and other city residents got together and proved that life
goes on, even in the face of such death and devastation. In these
four-foot-by-six-foot works, businesspeople cut deals in the back of cars,
couples get married, kids turn cartwheels, friends gather for expensive
meals, silhouetted figures wave American flags, expectant mothers practice
Yoga for Two, seniors swim in a pool, parents read to their children, a man
gets his shoes shined, and a baby gets examined by a doctor, new life rising
in the midst of such horror. Watts doesn¹t focus on the tragedy, although it
is always evident, lurking in the background ­ in one photo, a family sits
down to dinner, Ground Zero eerily seen through the window, but the future
is bright, especially for one of the sons, who is appearing in a Broadway
musical.

HISTORIC BATTERY PARK
Lower tip of Manhattan
http://www.thebattery.org
http://www.bpcparks.org/bpcp/parks/parks.php
In 1626, the Dutch built Fort Amsterdam in what is now Battery Park, an
event that is commemorated on the flagpole that stands near the corner of
Battery Pl. &amp; Greenwich. Walk around the pole to see depictions of the
purchase of Manhattan from the Indians and a map of Fort Amsterdam, which
became Fort James after the British captured it in 1664, then was recaptured
by the Dutch nine years later and went through a series of names, including
Fort Willem Hendrick, Fort Anne, and Fort George, before being demolished in
1790. Continue toward the water and stop by Fritz Koenig¹s battered
&quot;Sphere,&quot; which used to reside on Austin J. Tobin Plaza at the World Trade
Center and was moved here exactly six months to the minute after the WTC
attacks. Next comes the colorful Hope Garden, which was dedicated in 1988 to
those with HIV/AIDS. Next to Castle Clinton is Luis Sanguino¹s spectacular
bronze statue &quot;The Immigrants,&quot; portraying men, women, and children arriving
in New York with dreams of a new life. From 1807 to 1811, the South-west
Battery was built, a round fortification with twenty-eight guns on one tier.
It protected the tip of Manhattan Island during the War of 1812 but never
saw battle; it was renamed in 1815 after former NYC mayor DeWitt Clinton. It
later became a performance venue and an aquarium. In the northwest corner of
the park is the granite stele dedicated to the Belgian Huegenot Walloon
Settlers, by Henry Bacon, who also designed the Lincoln Memorial.
To the west you¹ll come upon Jonathan Scott Hartley¹s 1903 statue of John
Ericsson, the Swedish engineer who designed the Monitor warship. Ericsson is
holding out a boat in one hand while the other grasps engineering plans;
walk around the statue to see bas relief of the Monitor in battle and other
inventions by Ericsson. Continue around the circle north of Castle Clinton
to see the stunning Korean War Veterans Memorial, designed by Mac Adams. At
the center of this monument is a fifteen-foot-high black granite stele with
the Universal Soldier cut out of it; he is surrounded by a list of countries
involved in the Korean conflict and how many people were killed, injured, or
MIA from each. On July 27, at ten in the morning, the exact time the
fighting stopped in Korea, the sun shines through the Universal Soldier and
onto the commemorative plaque. Be sure to walk to the water next to see the
incredible American Merchant Mariners Memorial near Pier A. The 1991
sculpture, by Marisol depicts a merchant marine vessel sinking, having been
attacked by a Nazi U-boat. Three men stand on top of the ship, one reaching
down, desperately trying to save one of his fallen comrades, who is in the
water. The sculpture was based on a German photograph of an actual event. On
the other side of Castle Clinton stands a memorial plaque dedicated to the
Supreme Being by General William Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army.
Because of massive construction in the southeast corner of the park, where
the city will be building food kiosks, an aquatic carousel, and a bosque
that were originally scheduled to be completed by now, they¹ve taken down
some sculptures, including that of Giovanni da Verazzano, who sailed through
New York Bay in the early sixteenth century and has a suspension bridge
named after him; he¹s memorialized in a 1909 sculpture by Ettore Ximenes.
Don¹t miss the two interactive sound sculptures on the ground, including
Alfons van Leggelo¹s Dance Chimes, not far from the dancing water fountain.
Continue on along through the blooming Gardens of Remembrance by the water
and toward the ferry terminal and stop by the largest memorial in the park,
the East Coast Memorial, in the southern end, featuring an angry, mournful
eagle sculpted by Albino Manca. The eagle looks out on nineteen-foot granite
blocks that contain the names of those military men and women who &quot;sleep in
the American coastal waters.&quot; Next, outside of Battery Gardens restaurant,
was Norman M. Thomas¹s 1947 Coast Guard Memorial, featuring two men helping
a shirtless third man, a sculpture that, along with the merchant marine
memorial at the north end of the park, encapsulates the overall feeling of
the remarkable statuary that line this historic area, even with some of the
pieces currently not on view.

ROBERT F. WAGNER JR. PARK
http://www.olinptr.com/pdf/wagnerpark.pdf
http://www.bpcparks.org/bpcp/events/calendar.php?mo=07
Just outside the Museum of Jewish Heritage to the north of Battery Park is
this beautiful oasis overlooking the Hudson River. The park is named after
Bobby Jr., son of the former mayor; Jr. served on the City Council and
headed the City Planning Commission and the Board of Education. Walk along
the riverside and you¹ll first come upon Jim Dine¹s &quot;Ape &amp; Cat (At the
Dance),&quot; in which the two large bronze animals are enjoying a spin together.
Continue along the river¹s edge and gaze into Louise Bourgeois¹s &quot;Eyes,&quot; two
large eyeballs ­ which look more like breasts ­ that are peering out into
the water. Bear left and wander through Lynden Miller¹s fabulous series of
gardens, where lots of flowers are in bloom. Walk up the brick pavilion
built by Olin Partners and Machado Silvetti and take a seat on the
wooden-slatted benches. Walk under the arch and get lost in the view. On the
left side of the pavilion, study the timeline of New York harbor and read
about the ships that have sailed there. Walk through the lower arch back
down to the street to check out Tony Cragg¹s two &quot;Resonating Bodies,&quot; one
looking like a guitar/whale, the other a trumpet/elephant foot. The park is
a great place to take the family; check the BPC Parks Web site above for a
list of such events as preschool plays, Elements of Nature Drawing, Go Fish,
birdwatching, public art tours, and more.

Last Chance Museum Exhibit of the Week

THE SCULPTURE OF LOUISE NEVELSON: CONSTRUCTING A LEGEND **** (out of four)
The Jewish Museum
1109 Fifth Ave. at 92nd St.
Through September 16
Closed Friday
Admission: adults $12, children under twelve free (free Saturdays)
212-423-3337
http://www.jewishmuseum.org/site/pages/onlinex.php?id=150&amp;live;_stat=n...
Born Leah Berliawsky in Kiev, Louise Nevelson lived and worked in New York
City for more than fifty years, using scraps of wood, bits of furniture, and
other discarded objects -- her father was a woodcutter and junk dealer -- to
create remarkable, unique works of art. Her abstract Cubist structures (with
a little Surrealism, Dada, and Minimalism thrown into the mix) were painted
either all black or all white ­ in two different studios, one for each color
­ forming fascinating objects that breathe with life. &quot;The Sculpture of
Louise Nevelson: Constructing a Legend&quot; contains more than sixty works,
including painted wood installations, photographs, drawings, etchings,
Plexiglas sculptures, steel pieces, and silkscreens, displaying her depth
and range. Many of her works are like sliced-open souls, revealing the
complexities inside, abstract conglomerations in small boxes that are both
heartbreaking and life-affirming. &quot;Black Moon&quot; is like a grandfather clock,
evoking the passage of time. The re-created &quot;Dawn¹s Wedding Feast&quot; is a
room-size installation that includes the bride and groom and various guests,
all painted white in celebration of their matrimony.
&quot;Homage to 6,000,000 I&quot; is long and horizontal, two primary pieces of
painted black wood seemingly pulled open to reveal the hearts and souls lost
during the Holocaust, with dozens of small boxes filled with varying
objects, emphasizing the loss of each individual. &quot;Mrs. N¹s Palace&quot; is a
self-contained room unto itself, with a mirror, as if Nevelson has opened up
her own soul. Themes such as royalty and matrimony, day and night, nature
and the environment, and religion are evident in such pieces as &quot;Sky
Cathedral Presence,&quot; &quot;Rain Forest Column XVIII,&quot; and &quot;Royal Tide I&quot; (one of
several works painted in gold). The vertical &quot;Dream House XXXII&quot; is almost
like a person, with some hinged doors open, some closed, as if revealing
only certain parts, hiding others. One of the most telling works is &quot;First
Personage,&quot; in which a flat front section, with a knot in the wood that
almost looks like a mouth trying to open up and say something, stands in
front of a second section that has sharp edges shooting out of one side,
unable to hold in what it contains, as if the artist herself is about to
explode. The exhibit also includes the short film &quot;Louise Nevelson: A
Conversation with Six Artists,&quot; in which archival of footage of Nevelson at
work in her studio and talking about her career is combined with a half
dozen modern artists discussing Nevelson¹s influence on them.

Sunday, September 9        Second Sundays: Nevelson¹s World, including live
performance, workshops, gallery tours, and more, for children five to twelve
and their families, free with museum admission, 11:15 am

ALSO AT THE JEWISH MUSEUM **** (out of four)
http://www.thejewishmuseum.org
Whenever we go to the Jewish Museum, we always walk through the fascinating
permanent exhibition &quot;Culture and Continuity: The Jewish Journey.&quot; Near the
end, we take our time in the always changing &quot;Realizing a Future:
Contemporary Voices&quot; room, which currently includes Nona Orbach¹s &quot;Incessant
Mezuzah,&quot; a video in the wall where the mezuzah would normally go; Hannah
Wilke¹s &quot;Venus Pareve,&quot; nine brightly colored hand-painted plaster of Paris
figures of herself, but without arms or legs; and several other conceptual
works, in addition to George Segal¹s remarkable, heartbreaking sculpture
&quot;The Holocaust&quot; (on permanent view), in which a shriveled man is behind
barbed wire looking out, a pile of dead victims strewn about behind him.
Through October 14 in the Media Center, &quot;Love and Loss: A Video Trilogy by
Neil Goldberg&quot; features the short works (totaling seventeen minutes) &quot;My
Parents Read Dreams I¹ve Had About Them&quot; from 1998, &quot;My Father Breathing
into a Mirror&quot; from 2006, and &quot;A System for Writing Thank You Notes&quot; from
2001. In each video, the camera remains in its place as the actions
described in the title occur onscreen. They are bittersweet, as all three
deal either directly or indirectly with death.

Sunday, September 9        Funky Monkeys concert, for children two to six,
adults $15, kids $10, 2:00

In the Thematic Neighborhood

LOUISE NEVELSON IN NEW YORK
Multiple locations
http://www.saintpeters.org
http://www.louisenevelsonfoundation.org
Louise Nevelson left her mark on New York City in more ways than one, with
several public sculptures still standing, a wonderful gift to the people.
Just a few blocks from the Jewish Museum, Nevelson¹s &quot;Night Presence IV&quot;
stands in the Park Ave. median at 92nd St., facing south. Originally
installed in 1973 on 60th St. at Fifth Ave., the Cor-Ten steel work was
presented to the city by Nevelson in celebration of her fiftieth anniversary
of living and working in New York.
Not many people are familiar with Saint Peter¹s Church on Lexington Ave. at
54th St., a small, modern-looking structure built in 1977 that hides some
treasures inside and outside its hallowed halls. Nearly every inch of the
Erol Beker Chapel of the Good Shepherd, an airy five-sided room of
natural-colored and white-painted wood, frosted glass, and an abstract white
cross on a gold background (&quot;Cross of the Resurrection&quot;), was designed by
Nevelson, who entitled the east wall &quot;Frieze of the Apostles&quot; and the west
wall &quot;Sky Vestment -- Trinity.&quot;
Also in 1977, Nevelson installed &quot;Shadows and Flags&quot; in the newly renamed
Louise Nevelson Plaza in Legion Memorial Square, at the intersection of
Maiden Ln. and William and Liberty Sts. &quot;Shadows and Flags&quot; contains seven
pieces, several of which are set on a long, narrow pedestal, resulting in
works that look like they¹re blowing in the wind. Finally, one piece we can
no longer see is &quot;Sky Gate ­ New York,&quot; which used to hang in the lobby of 1
World Trade Center, a black-painted wood relief that looked like a flying
ship with circles and square and rectangular &quot;doors&quot; throughout and was
destroyed on 9/11.

Born in Vienna in 1890, Fritz Lang became one of the most successful German
filmmakers with such influential classics as M, METROPOLIS, and the Dr.
Mabuse and Die Nibelungen films. When he came to Hollywood, he brought his
expressionist sensibility with him, crafting thrilling noirs ­ as well as
disappointing melodramas -- working with many of the greatest actors of
their time. The Museum of the Moving Image is mixing in a few of the early
works with his major Hollywood output; we¹ve always been suckers for Edward
G. Robinson¹s gentle performance in SCARLET STREET, but it¹s hard to go
wrong with Glenn Ford and Lee Marvin in THE BIG HEAT, Henry Fonda in YOU
ONLY LIVE ONCE, or Spencer Tracy in FURY.

When media magnate Amos Kynes (Robert Warwick) dies, his son Walter (Vincent

gets a scoop on the Lipstick Killer will become his number two man, so the
backstabbing race is on among sleazy wire service chief Mark Loving (George
Sanders); managing editor Jon Day Griffith (Thomas Mitchell), who¹ll do just
about anything for a story; and Harry Kritzer (James Craig), who thinks the
best way to get the job is from the bed of Walter¹s wife (Rhonda Fleming).
Throw in cynical television journalist Ed Mobley (Dana Andrews) and
hot-to-trot columnist Mildred Donner (Ida Lupino) and you have another one
of Hollywood¹s terrific newspaper pics. Director Fritz Lang pulls no
punches; the film is filled with plenty of sexual undertones (and
overtones), and Kynes himself is a take-off of Charles Foster Kane, the
glistening K atop his New York City skyscraper reminiscent of the K atop
Xanadu¹s front gate.

Poor Bernard Chanticleer (Peter Kastner). His mother (Geraldine Page) sends
him locks of her hair and pays a prudish landlord (Julie Harris), aided by a
tough cop (Dolph Sweet), to make sure no girls visit him in his new
apartment. Bernard's father (Rip Torn) rules over him with an iron fist in
the basement of the New York Public Library. A nice, innocent young woman
(Karen Black in her first major role) is interested in him, but he wants a
psycho go-go dancer/actress (Elizabeth Hartman). Meanwhile, he is getting
all the wrong advice from his best friend (Tony Bill). Francis Ford
Coppola¹s little-known romantic comedy earned Page an Academy Award
nomination, Kastner a BAFTA nomination as Most Promising Newcomer, and a
Palme d¹Or nomination at Cannes. Coppola uses the New York City settings to
perfection, whether Bernard is chasing a kite across the Sheep Meadow,
wandering through the Times Square peep shows, or being chased through the
New York Public Library. The Lovin¹ Spoonful supplies the fabulously sixties
soundtrack.

THE HUNTING PARTY (Richard Shepard, 2007) ***1/2 (out of four)
Opens Friday, September 7
http://www.thehuntingpartymovie.com
Fearless reporter Simon Hunt (Richard Gere) and his trusty cameraman, Duck
(Terrence Howard), have circumnavigated the globe, flying in the face of
danger as they report on brutal wars in Iraq, El Salvador, Somalia, and
other international hotspots. But when things hit too close to home in
Bosnia, Hunt suffers a major meltdown, disappearing into the ether.
Meanwhile, Duck settles into a comfy network studio gig. Five years later,
covering the anniversary of the end of the war in Bosnia with smooth-talking
anchorman Franklin Harris (James Brolin), Duck is suddenly visited by Hunt,
who has a plan to track down and interview the Fox (Ljubomir Kerekes), a
wanted war criminal who is still revered in some parts of the country. They
are joined on the impossible mission by young reporter Benjamin (Jesse
Eisenberg), the Harvard-educated nephew of a network VP who has no idea what
he¹s getting himself into. Together they travel deep into Serb territory,
risking their lives for a story that is much more complicated than any of
them imagined. Inspired by an Esquire article based on actual events, THE
HUNTING PARTY, written and directed by Richard Shepard (THE MATADOR), is an
exciting ­ and very funny ­ political thriller, featuring excellent
performances by the three leads in addition to an entertaining supporting
cast of oddball characters. Gere is particularly outstanding, on quite a
roll following this year's earlier fine turn as Clifford Irving in Lasse
Hallström¹s THE HOAX.

SHOOT ¹EM UP (Michael Davis, 2007) ***1/2 (out of four)
Opens Friday, September 7
http://www.shootemupmovie.com
Clive Owen might not have been chosen as the next James Bond, but he gets to
play quite the hero ­ nearly the opposite of 007 -- in Michael Davis¹s
riotously funny and hysterically violent SHOOT ¹EM UP. Owen stars as Mr.
Smith, a haggard, homeless dude who unwittingly finds himself in a rather
bloody mess, on the run with lactating hooker DQ (Monica Bellucci) trying to
protect a baby from the villainous Hertz (a scenery-chewing Paul Giamatti)
and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of hired assassins.
Smith constantly munches on carrots ­ not only to preserve his eyesight but
to convert them into weapons as necessary ­ and uses guns in wild and wacky
ways, not just to shoot the bad guys. Paying homage to the spaghetti
Westerns of Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood, Sam Peckinpah¹s THE WILD BUNCH
and STRAW DOGS, the Bond films, Quentin Tarantino¹s KILL BILL, Joel and
Ethan Coen¹s RAISING ARIZONA, John Woo¹s HARD-BOILED, and even Alfonso
Cuarón¹s CHILDREN OF MEN (in which Owen protected the world¹s first pregnant
woman in a generation), Davis creates some of the most inventive, remarkable
shootouts ever filmed, one following another in an endless parade of bullets
­ more twenty-five thousand, according to the production notes, resulting in
fifteen gallons of blood. The plot makes little sense, but that doesn¹t
really matter; the action¹s the thing, and it¹s a thing of beauty.

3:10 TO YUMA (James Mangold, 2007) ** (out of four)
Opens Friday, September 7
http://310toyumathefilm.com
James Mangold¹s remake of Delmer Daves¹s 1957 Western 3:10 TO YUMA starts
out promising but ultimately delves into the wholly ludicrous. Christian
Bale stars as Ben Evans, a hobbled Civil War vet who is about to lose his
ranch ­ and the respect of his wife (Gretchen Mol) and kids (Logan Lerman
and Benjamin Petry). Desperate for money, he signs on to help transport
vicious killer Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) on a dangerous three-day journey
from Bisbee to Contention, where Wade will be sent straight to prison on the
3:10 train to Yuma. But even handcuffed, Wade is a dangerous criminal and a
more-than-worthy adversary; meanwhile, his villainous crew, led by the
brutally evil Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), has set out to rescue him,
killing all who get in their way. Based on an Elmore Leonard story, the film
gets muddled quickly, with far too much of the action beyond belief. Why
don¹t they just tie up Wade¹s arms and legs, or at least cuff him behind his
back? How many hundreds of bullets does it take to miss easy targets? By
choosing to focus more on the transporting of Wade ­ which was not the
center of the 1957 original, which starred Glenn Ford as Wade, Van Heflin as
Evans, and Richard Jaeckel as Charlie -- director Mangold (HEAVY, WALK THE
LINE) has turned the film into an annoying chase flick lacking in real
drama. But it¹s always fun seeing Peter Fonda, here playing grizzled
Pinkerton detective Byron McElroy.

THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS by Paul Auster (Henry Holt, 2002) ***1/2 (out of four)
http://www.henryholt.com/holt/bookofillusions.htm
After losing his wife and kids in a plane crash, David Zimmer has just about
given up on life. Living in a self-described &quot;blur of alcoholic grief and
self-pity,&quot; the Vermont professor considers ending it all until he sees a
clip of little-known silent-comedy star Hector Mann on television. He
suddenly becomes obsessed with seeing all twelve of Mann¹s films, which are
available only in the collections of several museums in the U.S. and Europe.
He also writes a book about the films of Mann, who mysteriously disappeared
in 1929 and was never heard from again. And then he gets a strange letter
one day, supposedly from Mann¹s wife, asking him to come out to New Mexico
to meet the man himself. Although he doubts the veracity of the letter,
Zimmer soon is on his way out west, not only seeking the master comedian but
a new reason for living. Auster (LEVIATHAN, CITY OF GLASS, THE MUSIC OF
CHANCE) spends much of THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS detailing the work of Hector
Mann, from his dapper suit to the subtle twisting of his mustache, creating
a compelling character who seemingly exists only on celluloid. Part
detective story, part pseudo-biography, part psychological drama, THE BOOK
OF ILLUSIONS is one of Auster¹s best forays into the inner mind of an artist
and the creative process.
In addition, Auster has written and directed THE INNER LIFE OF MARTIN
FROST, a feature-length film (opening September 7) based on an unreleased
Hector Mann film vividly described in THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS. Picador has
also released the screenplay, complete with an interview with Auster about
the making of the film. In the interview, conducted by Céline Curiol, Auster
discusses how THE INNER LIFE OF MARTIN FROST was initially meant to be part
of producer Regina Ziegler¹s Erotic Tales series, comprising short works by
such directors as Hal Hartley, Susan Seidelman, Ken Russell, and others, but
after financing couldn¹t be agreed upon, Auster set the project aside ­
resurrecting it as a film within a book and, now, turning it into a film in
its own right, starring David Thewlis, Irene Jacob, Michael Imperioli, and
Sophie Auster.

Monday, September 10    Paul Auster and Michael Imperioli in conversation
about the making of THE INNER LIFE OF MARTIN FROST, Barnes &amp; Noble Union
Square, 33 East 17th St., free, 7:00

GREAT WORLD OF SOUND (Craig Zobel, 2006) ***1/2 (out of four)
Opens Friday, September 14
http://magpictures.com/profile.aspx?id=70f3c322-970b-4be6-9f0b-fd9faf...
Craig Zobel¹s debut feature film is a smart, subtle comedy set in the
somewhat shadier corners of the music industry. Desperately in need of money
and jobs, soft-spoken Martin (Pat Healy) and rambunctious Clarence (Kene
Holliday) become traveling salesmen for GWS, a small music company that
auditions wannabes, then asks them to pay (up front) upwards of thirty
percent of the cost of producing their own CD. As Martin and Clarence get
better and better at their sales pitch, they become more and more suspicious
of the whole endeavor as they are ordered by company founder Layton (Robert
Longstreet) and his right-hand man, Shank (John Baker), to sign up the
hopefuls regardless of their talent level. Using the Maysles brothers¹
outstanding documentary SALESMAN (1969) as a point of departure, Zobel adds
the public¹s seemingly insatiable demand for reality-show stardom ­ all of
the musical performers in the film believed they were auditioning to make
records, not appearing in a fiction film, resulting in a series of wonderful
unscripted scenes. (The filmmakers revealed their true intentions at the end
of each audition.) Healy (UNDERTOW) and Holliday (who starred in such TV
shows as MATLOCK and CARTER COUNTRY and is now an evangelical minister) make
a great team, both in good times and bad, as they each attempt to better
their life -- much the way the wannabe musicians try to as well. GREAT WORLD
OF SOUND is a terrific sleeper of a film that has been a film festival hit
all over the world.

ONE CITY BOOK LAUNCH

Saturday, September 15
Admission: free
http://www.rmanyc.org/programs/calendar

http://www.onecitybook.com
http://www.theidproject.com
Meditation teacher Ethan Nichtern, founder of the Interdependence Project,
will be reading from and discussing his book, ONE CITY: A DECLARATION OF
INTERDEPENDENCE (Wisdom Publications), at two locations this weekend, first
at the Rubin as part of the free K2 Lounge party, then at OM Yoga. In ONE
CITY, Nichtern, an FOT (friend of twi-ny), sees everyday life as the real
internet, where all things are connected, both physically and mentally. Some
of the molecules in a breath exhaled in New York City might end up being
inhaled on the other side of the world, directly linking two strangers. He
talks about such complex concepts as egolessness, interdependence,
enlightenment, and spirituality, often working in Buddhist philosophy, but
he writes in a breezy, entertaining style that doesn¹t go over the reader¹s
head. Whether you¹re an expert meditator or a novice ­ or, like us, you have
no desire to ever cross your legs, free your mind, and chant -- ONE CITY is
a fun and fascinating look at who we are, who we can be, and how every
individual can make a difference.

http://katemcgarry.com
Kate McGarry grew up in Hyannisport, Massachusetts, where she and her
siblings would put on shows for their parents. Mixing her Irish Catholic
routes with jazz and her love of performing, she¹s spent much of the last
ten years honing her craft, playing with such musicians as Fred Hersch,
Bobby McFerrin, and Clark Terry and releasing such well-received albums as
SHOW ME (2001) and MERCY STREETS (2005). Her latest album, THE TARGET
(Palmetto, April 2007), features a wide range of material, from songs by
Sting, Lerner and Lowe, Bobby Troup, and Rodgers and Hammerstein to
originals by McGarry and her husband, guitarist Keith Ganz, to an
instrumental by Miles Davis to which McGarry has added poetic lyrics. On
such tunes as &quot;The Target (Miracles Like These),&quot; &quot;She Always Will,&quot; and &quot;It
Might as Well Be Spring,&quot; McGarry¹s voice is as light and airy as spring
itself, backed by Gary Versace on organ, Reuben Rogers on bass, Greg
Hutchinson on drums, and Ganz on guitar, with Donny McCaslin adding
occasional tenor sax. She¹ll be in New York for a weekend of different
shows, beginning on September 14 at the Stone and September 15 at 55 Bar
with Ganz and percussionist Clarence Penn; on September 16 she and Ganz will
be playing a free show in Stuyvesant Cove Park. In addition, McGarry will
also begin teaching jazz this semester at the Manhattan School of Music.

Taiwanese heavy metal band Chthonic is having one heckuva time on their
current international tour. The airline in Frankfurt screwed up, so their
instruments never made it to a gig in Hamburg and they had to use borrowed
ones. Their RV broke down on the way to Boston, but instead of canceling any
shows, they continued on in a van lent to them by &quot;Taiwanese Madams&quot;
(according to their online diary). Their driver was robbed at knifepoint in
Philly. They had to stop a show in Cleveland because of severe monitor
problems. And in Indiana, they were bombarded with Ghost Money, celebrating
one of their biggest hits. So who knows what might happen when they come to
the Highline Ballroom, ready to take on New York.

Expect huge crowds that will slow you down and drive you crazy, and try not

impossible-to-win games. In addition to more than three hundred vendors for
this eightieth annual event, there will be live music, a cannoli-eating
contest, and religious processions from the Most Precious Blood Church on
Mulberry. San Gennaro (Saint Januarius) himself was an Italian bishop who
was martyred in 305 under the rule of Roman emperor Diocletian. Januarius is
buried in Naples; he is associated with the gooey red liquid because the
blood from his severed head was stored in a vial and is believed to liquefy
and bubble at certain times of the year. In addition to the below special
events, there will be free live entertainment nightly from 7:30 to 11:00 at
the Feast Stage at Grand &amp; Baxter Sts.
