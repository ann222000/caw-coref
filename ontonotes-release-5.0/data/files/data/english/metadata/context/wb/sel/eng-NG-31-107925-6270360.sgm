The fastest move Toyota could make would be to get away from Michael
Waltrip.   Underachiever his whole career and wont be any different going
forward.

Yep.  They have to be questioning why they hitched their wagon to Waltrip.
What a disaster.

True, but who of the credible teams was willing to ditch there branding in
the earlier stages when Toyota was making plans.  If Penske was as smart as
they say he is, then he should have taken on Toyota.  And speaking Michael,
what has Bill Davis done lately?

Yeah.  But what is killing Mikey is he doesn't have what his brother had to
pull him through.  Past Champion Provisonals!  I am a bit concerned though
now with Dale Jarrett using 3 already this year.  There is a max of 6.
Vickers has got to be worrying too.  With no starts in races, there is no
money coming in, and they keep getting deeper and deeper in points and
further away from that top 35.

No need to worry.  Once his provisionals are up he'll join Mikey and have
alot more time to spend with his family on Sunday's.  God damn shame to see
one of the good guys go out like he's going out.  He was never in DW's class
as a driver but there are some similarities on how they exited the sport.
As back markers.

Yeppers...Mikey owns the 44, Buffy owns the 55.  Owner gets some(?) points for
attempting to Qual...Driver gets zippo for a DNQ.

http://www.jayski.com/stats/2007/standings/3lvms2007points.htm

I notice the 44 is actually tied with the 41 for 31/32nd...267 points out.

Gonna be a long season for MWR.

Yes.  If I remember correctly, Mikey owns Reutimann's and
Jarrett's cars, and Buffy owns Mikey's.

Owner's points are alloted the same as driver's points, based
on finishing position, except that points are also awarded to
drivers who don't start the race based on where they end up in
the qualifying (thus the guy who was 44th after qualifying gets
31 points, the guy 45th gets 28 points, etc, down to 1 pt,
which is what everyone from 54th back gets).  (this is why
Mikey still has negative driver points, while the Buffy is
back to positive numbers for owners points).

Because Jarrett can get in the first 6 races on the champs
provisional, he's building more points than the guys who aren't
starting, even with mediocre finishes.  But if Kahne, Riggs,
Blaney, and Menard get their acts in gear and stop crashing
or breaking, Jarrett is in trouble.  A top 10 finish or two
by any of those guys will lift them above Jarrett in the
standings.
