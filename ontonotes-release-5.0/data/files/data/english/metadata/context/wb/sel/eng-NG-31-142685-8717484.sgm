Anyone who teaches in a racially mixed school knows that children will
instinctively self-segregate based on race (especially in the school
cafeteria).  The lefties must be besides themselves and horrified!!!
So they create these dumb little social engineering projects to force
students to racially mix together (of course this goes against human
nature, but lefties don't know much about that).

Is self segregation racism or just cultural?

I think these socialist are trying to make something of nothing, like usual.

No racial comment intended but that is just the way it is.
Multiculturalists and Big Business are intent on forcing us to be of one
culture. They continue to insist on forcing us to accept Islam and
Hispanic anti American cultures into our lives. These cultures and
others are not coming here to become Americans. They want to force us
into chang to their culture. they stay in their house and we will stay
in ours. We and they can visit but I don't want them moving in. We are
full and we don't need the introduction of strife into our lives.

Your attempt at humor is not well founded.
Did you know that the three cities most involved in the slave trade were
New York City, Boston, and Charleston.
Did you know that there were 65,000 free Blacks serving in the
Confederate Army with the same rations, pay and privileges as their
white counterparts.
Did you know that the Union Army did not let Blacks serve, as they
thought they were not equal to the whites, until Lincoln was brought up
to political realities of what was happening in the Confederate Army and
Union Position didn't look good.
Did you know that Grant kept Slaves until 8 months after the Civil War
ended.
Did you know why all the Salves ended up in the South? Remember the
potato famine in Ireland? Northerners saw that it was cheaper to pay 10
cents a day to Irish Immigrants than to keep Slaves. They sold them to
the South. When an Irishman was worked to death they simply hired
another one. Keeping Slaves was costly.
The Civil War was not about abolishing Slavery. Grant states that very
effectively on a number of occasions.
When you study history get back and insert the real reason here.
Did you know there were 14 Union of the Confederate States of America
and 2 territories?
I suggest you study history and get the story not just what politically
correct text books have in them as I'm not inclined to write further here.
The Flag that the History Channel proclaimed as the Stars and Bars was not.

It's a fact that higher life forms tend to want to overcome their base
tendencies and live in a more civilized manner.  Of course, there's
always the knuckledraggers like you who yearn to return to their simian
origins.  I'm sure you long for the days when dating was much simpler.
If you want a wife, just go out clubbing.  If you want a divorce, just
club a little harder.  Those goddamn politically correct liberals are

We are talking about children, not higher life forms.

When we are taking about higher life forms, how do you explain white
flight?  Do you still live in your formally white neighborhood?

I think most of the poor don't have a real political identity. However
the failed attempt to kill tens of thousands of blacks by stranding
them in New Orleans will surely get out the vote. That act alone
will get 10s of thousand of new black Democratic voters to vote
Democrat for decades to come.

johnny,

You'd appear a lot smarter if you would learn to separate cultures
from skin color. I've worked and associated with every race and many
different ethnic groups in my lifetime. The reason that you detest
blacks is that you've only knowlingly had experience with the ghetto
trash manufactured by the leftists in this country. In the same
manner, you can find Vietnamese ghetto trash in the slums of the bay
area. At the same time, you can find professionals from both ethnic
groups that you couldn't distinguish from any other professional if
you were speaking to them via telephone.

Look at it this way. Trash comes in every color, but so do good
people. I would't trust trash like Ramon or the LA gangbangers unless
I had them right in front of me and was wearing a gun. However, I have
hispanic and Amerindian friends and associates that I can (and have)
trusted with my life, and in one instance with the lives of my family.

&gt;Big Business are intent on forcing us to
&gt;be of one culture. They continue to
&gt;insist on forcing us to accept Islam and
&gt;Hispanic anti American cultures into our
&gt;lives. These cultures and others are not
&gt;coming here to become Americans.
&gt;They want to force us into chang to their
&gt;culture. they stay in their house and we
&gt;will stay in ours. We and they can visit
&gt;but I don't want them moving in. We are
&gt;full and we don't need the introduction
&gt;of strife into our lives.

No matter how hard they try to make everyone one big happy family....it
will never happen.

The Multiculturalists and Big Business has as much chance of changing
people as they would getting an elephant to breed with a duck.

I think there are two groups at play:

1) Those who naively believe in a future world in which everyone,
regardless of ethnicity, gets along harmoniously and hence there is
love and peace on the planet (no war).

2) The left elite pupettmasters (ie. those who fund the &quot;love/peace&quot;
useful idiots).  These global elites know the reality and devasting
consequences of ethnically mixed societies ie. the break apart
eventually, which is precisely their goal  ----&gt; to wreck the West and
in particular the USA since it acts as the #1 barrier to global
Marxism.  The &quot;teaching tolerance&quot; programs are really for whites.
They should instead be called, &quot;teaching whites to be tolerant of
their non-white replacements&quot;.  Why target whites?  Because whites
dominate the Western world in every category and thus they must be
marginalized in order for the West to fall.

Seems to me the buttfuck Bush admin  said they didn't know that there
were 20,00 people
at the superdome. Were they really that fucking incompetent? When any
American could
turn on the television and see what's happening.

I've been very close to the Christian conservative communities and
this had been the game plan.

After all the black they don't work, they live on welfare, and if they
don't listen to the government to evacuate they deserve what they get.
There are few places to exist New Orleans, just block their escape
with law enforcement and confiscate peoles guns.

The only thing needed was a president who would actually do it. How is
Bush doing?? Not very well huh?

Also was a popular idea within the wacko christian communities was
overthrowing the leader of Iraq and spreading Demorocy in the Middle
east. By killing all those who oppose us, because if they if they
oppose us they oppose Democracy. Hows that going dumbfuck? Just a
massive bloodbath of suffering, huh? We break into peoples houses in
the nighttime and take their guns also. Sounds
familiar to me.

Whatever the case is the Bush government has a SEVERE indifference to
humanity both here and abroad.

I'm well aware of what the Southern Poverty Law Center is. The issue
isn't them. The issue is that there's a program referenced by you that
is race-neutral and quite useful in every public school in the country
to promote inclusivity and understanding among diverse groups of ALL
types, whether they be racially, religiously, linguisticly, economicly,
fashion, academicly or activity based. You crticize that very useful
program solely because it's sponsored by an institution you disagree
with. You lie about it being solely about race relations.

Besides, so what if it's sometimes used to promote greater understanding
among diverse racial, ethnic and linguistic groups? The fact that you
view that as bad says a lot about you.  You are a small person, with a
small mind, who is afraid to be exposed to diversity, so your range of
experience must be quite small. I wonder you do not find life
exceedingly boring.

I &quot;lie&quot; about it????
You may want to click on this link:
http://www.tolerance.org/teens/what.jsp
and then look for the part in the upper right hand corner &quot;Mix It Up
Slideshow&quot;.  After looking at these slides you will get the idea
(clearly) that it's about getting difference races to mingle due to,
obviously, self-segregation in public schools based on race.  Anyone
who follows scholarship on public schools in multiethnic districts
knows that students typically self-segregate based on race.  I'm not
stating anything new.

Multicultural societies don't work.  A cursory look at 5,000 years of
human history shows this to be true (at least 1/2 of all wars are
based on clashes of ethnic groups, religions, cultures, etc).  Hence,
pushing for a multicultural society is akin to pushing for &quot;forced
eventual balkanization&quot; in said country.
Society works best when public policy leans towards homogeneousness
(racial, cultural, religious).  People like to mingle with their own
kind, accept it.
If you are white and you have children, you surely would rather your
children marry another white person.  Don't lie.  You know this is
true.  This makes you a racial separatist to some degree just like
everyone else.
The multicultural agenda is about one thing --------&gt; reducing whites'
numbers by saturating American society with nonwhites.  The
&quot;tolerance&quot; docrtine is really aimed at whites to have &quot;tolerance&quot; for
their nonwhite replacements.

I like different cultures and trying my hand at different languages.
I often say that Japan and the Japanese people are the highest evolved
people/culture on Earth.  I'd say that Germans are second.  Koreans
are good too.  And Asian students often surpass whites, it's a fact,
simply because of their culture.
Regardless of all this, racial separation is the best policy for any
country (if at all possible).  Just look at Japan - the most racially
homogenous country on Earth and look at how supreme they are.

You have my blessings to pay tuition to send your kids to any sort of
segregated school you want, whether it be religious, racial, cultural or
whatever. Don't ask for government support or vouchers for your endeavors.

In public schools, I expect the staff to use whatever tools or programs
they can find to break down barriers of understanding and promote the
synthesis of the many cultures that wind up in the US. I don't want
there to be ethnic or religious conflicts in the future, and programs
like this help to break down the kinds of barriers, mistrust, hatred and
resentment that lead to violence in our schools.

Decades ago, the Irish, Italians and Jews were separated by neighborhood
or otherwise. There was intense rivalry (including youth gangs and
organized crime) and suspicion between them and WASPs and among the
minorities themselves. Many spoke different languages and the immigrant
parents often never did learn or master English. The US is essentially a
single society today largely because of the mixing, the integration of
WASP with Irish, Italian, German, Eastern European and other diverse
immigrant groups that occurred in our public schools. The US is a better
and stronger society today because of that integration and synthesis of
cultures.

After every human migration in history, there's been an eventual mixing
of culture and genetic stock. Go to India today and try to determine who
is descended from Indo-European or Mongol invaders. Go to Normandy and
find a pure-blooded Norseman. For that matter, go to England and find a
Norman. I'm Swedish, German, French, English, Scot, Irish and a dash of
Heaven knows what -- rumor is either Spanish, Indian or maybe even
African, possibly a combination of all three. That in the mere 350 years
since Thomas Rood immigrated to New England. Your descendents will be a
mixture of European, African, Asian and Latin American. It's inevitable.
Yes, they are your replacements, and the world will be a better, more
peaceful place for it. It's human nature. Deal with it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyone who teaches in a racially mixed school knows that children will
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; instinctively self-segregate based on race (especially in the school
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cafeteria).  The lefties must be besides themselves and horrified!!!
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So they create these dumb little social engineering projects to force
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; students to racially mix together (of course this goes against human
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; nature, but lefties don't know much about that).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Hmm I sat with the black kids. Hell we played on the same football
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;team.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Must be a southern thing where white kids hand nooses on trees where
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;black kids sit under.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It's also a thing from the urban jungles, where the left wing do their
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; best to keep blacks poor, ignorant, and fearful -- thus chaining them
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; forever to the leftist voter plantation.

&gt;&gt; &gt;I think most of the poor don't have a real political identity. However
&gt;&gt; &gt;the failed attempt to kill tens of thousands of blacks by stranding
&gt;&gt; &gt;them in New Orleans will surely get out the vote. That act alone
&gt;&gt; &gt;will get 10s of thousand of new black Democratic voters to vote
&gt;&gt; &gt;Democrat for decades to come.

&gt;&gt; Your tin foil hat is on a little too tight, halfwit.

&gt;Seems to me the buttfuck Bush admin  said they didn't know that there
&gt;were 20,00 people
&gt;at the superdome. Were they really that fucking incompetent? When any
&gt;American could
&gt;turn on the television and see what's happening.

&gt;I've been very close to the Christian conservative communities and
&gt;this had been the game plan.

&gt;After all the black they don't work, they live on welfare, and if they
&gt;don't listen to the government to evacuate they deserve what they get.
&gt;There are few places to exist New Orleans, just block their escape
&gt;with law enforcement and confiscate peoles guns.

&gt;The only thing needed was a president who would actually do it. How is
&gt;Bush doing?? Not very well huh?

&gt;Also was a popular idea within the wacko christian communities was
&gt;overthrowing the leader of Iraq and spreading Demorocy in the Middle
&gt;east. By killing all those who oppose us, because if they if they
&gt;oppose us they oppose Democracy. Hows that going dumbfuck? Just a
&gt;massive bloodbath of suffering, huh? We break into peoples houses in
&gt;the nighttime and take their guns also. Sounds
&gt;familiar to me.

&gt;Whatever the case is the Bush government has a SEVERE indifference to
&gt;humanity both here and abroad.

The last time I looked it was the MAYOR of that worthless slum that

flooded parking lot? They were just one example of how that left wing
halfwit screwed up.

But all those groups became American in culture - they did NOT impose their
native culture, or their parent's culture, on Americans at all.  They spoke
English.

That culture, by the way, is diametrically opposed to the so-called &quot;black
culture.&quot;  The culture of ALL these people was very much like &quot;Leave it to
Beaver.&quot;  The blacks like to call that &quot;acting white.&quot;  Well, Hispanics also
ACT WHITE - they are supremely Leave it to Beaver people.  Mexicans in the
USA miss their families, they send half the money earned back to their
families.  Contrast that to black fathers that think fatherhood ends after
the sperm is out - who - find me one, don't pay alimony to wives or support
their kids. Contrast it.  WE collectively, via taxation without
representation, WE support them and their kids.  Today, a lot of WASPS and
Jews too, are leftist radical 60s leftovers.  Meanwhile, Mexican fathers are
Ward Cleaver, Mexican mothers are June Cleaver - and the big families with
the kids are like the Waltons.  They work, they help out.  They aren't
useless or spoiled at all.   Think about that.  That might explain WHY so
many conservatives are in favor of illegals getting amnesty.  It's a
possibility.

Think about this too - if the Mexicans did what the KKK would love to do
regarding the blacks, no one would call them nazis or KKK for doing it.  HA

Lots of Mexicans look a lot like Russians - seriously.  I've also met quite
a lot of people who were Polish and Mexican, Czech and Mexican, Russian and
Mexican.  They are - WHITE.  They are also PRETTY!!  Never confuse Mexicans

send HALF their wages home to the family.  They are nothing like the blacks.
Black is not just skin color.  It's a whole set of features and behaviors.
Skin color is the least of it.

You make some pretty big assumptions there. In fact, I lived and taught

we were married, we lived on the Virginia Peninsula for 3 years. When we
moved there, I was afraid of how we might be received, but we made a lot
of friends there. In general, folks there aren't nearly as bigoted as
you are. My kids are biracial, and my daughter especially has been

&gt; &gt;&gt; You have my blessings to pay tuition to send your kids to any sort of
&gt; &gt;&gt; segregated school you want, whether it be religious, racial, cultural
&gt; &gt;&gt; or
&gt; &gt;&gt; whatever. Don't ask for government support or vouchers for your
&gt; &gt;&gt; endeavors.

&gt; &gt; Then I want my property tax back, the portion for public schools (or I
&gt; &gt; want vouchers to send my kids to segregated schools).  It's my money
&gt; &gt; afterall.

&gt; Indeed, I do not want to pay for anyone's health care except my own.  I do
&gt; not want to pay for someone else's kid's education or anything else.  I no
&gt; longer wish to be a defacto GUARDIAN of unwanted babies, either, with no
&gt; say
&gt; in what happens to these defacto wards I'm paying for.  And so forth.
&gt; Yes,
&gt; the person you wrote to is an idiot that just doensn't quite get it.
&gt; Allen
&gt; Bloom detailed the whole &quot;race thing&quot; in his &quot;Closing of the American
&gt; Mind.&quot;
&gt; Blacks on one side, everyone else on the other side of the cafeteria.
&gt; That's just the way IT IS.  It's freedom of choice.  Freedom of
&gt; association.
&gt; Free will.  IF there was true freedom in this country, we'd have the
&gt; freedom
&gt; to integrate OR segregate.  At least where I live, there are 55 and older
&gt; ONLY communities.  No one else can buy a home or live there.  People have
&gt; the freedom to associate in the USA - and that's what resulted, a 55 and
&gt; older community.   THAT IS freedom.  Forced integration, the social
&gt; experiment by those that never integrated themselves (married other races
&gt; is
&gt; integation) has FAILED.  It's not gonna happen.

&gt; I often wonder if the extreme right wing is so pro illegal alien,
&gt; especially
&gt; Mexicans, because they are seeing that Mexicans are the &quot;answer&quot; to the
&gt; &quot;black problem.&quot;  Watts used to be a black city . It's Hispanic now.
&gt; Where
&gt; did the blacks go?  No one seems to know, heh.  How many blacks are in
&gt; Mexico?  None.  There is no black brown alliance, either.  There IS a
&gt; black
&gt; brown war going on.  There you have it.  Maybe that's WHY these
&gt; conservatives are in favor of open borders.  Just a hunch.  It's something
&gt; to think about.  Mexicans,  Hispanics in general, have VERY &quot;Leave it to
&gt; Beaver&quot; family values.  Blacks do not.  Mexican cantina music is European
&gt; music - it's the same stuff.  It's nothing like black music.  And so
&gt; forth.
&gt; Do the math.  If that is the plan, it surely is diabolical!

&gt; &gt;&gt; In public schools, I expect the staff to use whatever tools or programs
&gt; &gt;&gt; they can find to break down barriers of understanding and promote the
&gt; &gt;&gt; synthesis of the many cultures that wind up in the US. I don't want
&gt; &gt;&gt; there to be ethnic or religious conflicts in the future, and programs
&gt; &gt;&gt; like this help to break down the kinds of barriers, mistrust, hatred
&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; resentment that lead to violence in our schools.

&gt; &gt; You are so ridiculous and naively idealistic.  People are tribal, they
&gt; &gt; like to be with those who are similar.  Accept this reality.  Your
&gt; &gt; dumb 1960's social experiment hasn't worked out after 40+ years.
&gt; &gt; Accept this reality.

&gt; Many wiser blacks are definitely understanding all of that failed
&gt; experiment, with them as the guinea pigs.  The liberal leftists DESTROYED
&gt; the black economy, the black moral fibre, the black family, the black
&gt; religious cohesion - and are directly responsible for duping them into a
&gt; situation where they live in inner city hell holes with no hope of escape.
&gt; After all, blacks do NOT manufacture guns or machine guns.  They do NOT
&gt; grow
&gt; the plants that make the drugs.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Decades ago, the Irish, Italians and Jews were separated by
&gt; &gt;&gt; neighborhood
&gt; &gt;&gt; or otherwise. There was intense rivalry (including youth gangs and
&gt; &gt;&gt; organized crime) and suspicion between them and WASPs and among the
&gt; &gt;&gt; minorities themselves. Many spoke different languages and the immigrant
&gt; &gt;&gt; parents often never did learn or master English. The US is essentially
&gt; &gt;&gt; a
&gt; &gt;&gt; single society today largely because of the mixing, the integration of
&gt; &gt;&gt; WASP with Irish, Italian, German, Eastern European and other diverse
&gt; &gt;&gt; immigrant groups that occurred in our public schools. The US is a
&gt; &gt;&gt; better
&gt; &gt;&gt; and stronger society today because of that integration and synthesis of
&gt; &gt;&gt; cultures.

&gt; But all those groups became American in culture - they did NOT impose
&gt; their
&gt; native culture, or their parent's culture, on Americans at all.  They
&gt; spoke
&gt; English.

&gt; That culture, by the way, is diametrically opposed to the so-called &quot;black
&gt; culture.&quot;  The culture of ALL these people was very much like &quot;Leave it to
&gt; Beaver.&quot;  The blacks like to call that &quot;acting white.&quot;  Well, Hispanics
&gt; also
&gt; ACT WHITE - they are supremely Leave it to Beaver people.  Mexicans in the
&gt; USA miss their families, they send half the money earned back to their
&gt; families.  Contrast that to black fathers that think fatherhood ends after
&gt; the sperm is out - who - find me one, don't pay alimony to wives or
&gt; support
&gt; their kids. Contrast it.  WE collectively, via taxation without
&gt; representation, WE support them and their kids.  Today, a lot of WASPS and
&gt; Jews too, are leftist radical 60s leftovers.  Meanwhile, Mexican fathers
&gt; are
&gt; Ward Cleaver, Mexican mothers are June Cleaver - and the big families with
&gt; the kids are like the Waltons.  They work, they help out.  They aren't
&gt; useless or spoiled at all.   Think about that.  That might explain WHY so
&gt; many conservatives are in favor of illegals getting amnesty.  It's a
&gt; possibility.

&gt; Think about this too - if the Mexicans did what the KKK would love to do
&gt; regarding the blacks, no one would call them nazis or KKK for doing it.
&gt; HA
&gt; HA......  Ironic, ain't it?

&gt; &gt; They SELF-segregated, primarily.  And the U.S. education policy pushed
&gt; &gt; strict assimilation.

&gt; Exactly.  They did eventually assimilate, even if they did keep some of
&gt; their culture.  That part of their culture BECAME part of American
&gt; culture -
&gt; like pizza, capucino, etc - Mario Lanza....  .

&gt;  Nobody catered to these immigrants re.

&gt; &gt; preserving their language and culture.

&gt; Correct - that is now a leftie agenda, even if it's racist to expect
&gt; people
&gt; TO keep all that!  It's segregationist to keep all that and refuse to
&gt; assimilate!  The left is promoting segregation when they promote that
&gt; shit.
&gt; The lefties do that AGAINST the so-called &quot;white&quot; culture.  Example:  La
&gt; Razi  = Nazis.  But La Raza is OK.

&gt; Further, most 19th and early

&gt; &gt; 20th century immigration was all white, and for good reason.  When
&gt; &gt; everyone is white, the only differences are primarily language and
&gt; &gt; culture (initially).  Within one generation, those differences were
&gt; &gt; largely erased.  When you throw nonwhites into this equation, you
&gt; &gt; still have the race issue with each succeeding generation.  It never
&gt; &gt; goes away.  Hence problems arise.

&gt; Mexican + any other kind of European = white.   Most Hispanics ARE white.
&gt; If I'm white, they are MORE white.  I remember when Italians were not
&gt; white.
&gt; Now they are white.  Jewish people didn't really assimilate at all because
&gt; the society was basically Christian, as documented by Kevin MacDonald in
&gt; &quot;Culture of Critique.&quot;  You ought to read that IF you want to know what
&gt; was
&gt; behind the 60s cultural revolution:  Frankfurt School, Boas  School, all
&gt; that shit.

&gt; The only problem race in the USA is the blacks.  Even Ambrose Bierce knew
&gt; that!

&gt; &gt;&gt; After every human migration in history, there's been an eventual mixing
&gt; &gt;&gt; of culture and genetic stock. Go to India today and try to determine
&gt; &gt;&gt; who

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, they are your replacements, and the world will be a better, more
&gt; &gt;&gt; peaceful place for it. It's human nature. Deal with it.

&gt; Not so.  If that was the case, there wouldn't be Asian, European and
&gt; African
&gt; people today, right now . Hispanics in S. America &quot;marry up&quot; - that is,
&gt; they
&gt; marry white.  They do not favor the African look - those features - at
&gt; all.

&gt; &gt; The world will be a better place for it?????  I suggesst you move to

You may want to visit East L.A.  It's 90% Mexican-American and has
