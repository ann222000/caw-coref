The first thirty-four chapters of DH are brilliant, breath-catching,
emotionally-charged, full of struggles between beliefs and doubts,
moral choices between personal and social values, and Orwellian
terror.  As I read it, I was deeply delighted that Rowling had
finally created a novel that transcends what appeared to be a
recreational reading for young kids.  However, after Harry walked
into his self-sacrifice and fell, the following chapters suddenly
changes to a totally different tone.  The final three chapters of
DH are simply a farce!

Piecing evidences from many sources, DH skillfully portrays Dumbledore
as a flawed patriarch, and Harry was left with nothing but his own
moral compass to make his ultimate decision.  That was an existential
moment.  And the end of the chapter is the climax of the whole
book.  But the subsequent King's Cross scene, seemingly a cheap
rip-off of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; simply flushes the quality of
the book down the tube.  Once again, everything was either as
planned or as predicted.  The long boring chats are redundant,
verbose, and simply unbearable.  But that is nothing compared with
next chapter's hour-long debates between Harry and Voldemort while
they circle each other before launching the final blow to kill each
other!  Who cares which side the late Snape was on--we are dueling
to kill now!  That wand succession rule was also contrived and
borderline nonsensical.  What's wrong with the British authors?
Look at action scenes from other cultures: In American Westerns,
two gunmen staring each other silently and unemotionally, quick
draw and firing, and the fight concluded; in Japanese samurai
movies, two swordsmen gazing each other intensely with hands on
the handles of the blades, thunder-like fast withdrawal and slashing,
and the loser tumbled.  Then we have the qunitessential British
action movies--the 007 series, the worst example of the talking
villain syndrome.  Disgusting.

If you don't feel the final battle is a farce, consider this: Molly
Weasley defeated and killed Bellatrix while all other Order members
couldn't even beat her?  Come on!  And what is the stupid scene of
getting everyone rushing to Hogwarts to participate the last battle?
This is like a 1950 Hollywood production in which the calvary or
whatever came at the end to trample the bad guys (and the audience
applaud in the theatre).  That Kreacher scene was particularly
indicative of the fact that the tone of the ending has turned into
a farce.  Oi, it's the grand finale--shop keepers, student parents,
everyone--get on stage, now!   Well at least she didn't throw the
Dudleys or the Muggle Prime Minister into the fight, thank goodness!
Maybe she hurried to finish the book, maybe she ran out of ideas,
or maybe this was her intention--a comical ending.  A would-be
great novel was ruined.  What a shame.

I wouldn't go so far as that. But yes, the Battle of Hogwarts was a messy
read indeed.

I also thought Molly finishing of Bellatrix was, even if emotional, less
than believable.

The King's Cross chapter is essential, otherwise crucial explanations and
clarifications become impossible.

More than anything else, the entire Harry Potter series is a complex tale of
how Dumbledore planned the destruction of Voldemort. The foreground story
is of Harry studying, playing Quidditch, etc., but meanwhile, silently,
Dumbledore has been researching the secret behind Voldemort's apparent
immortality, hunting for the Horcruxes, teaching Harry crucial lessons,
recruiting Snape and supporting him in his double-agent role, reforming the
Order and a myriad other things, all with the aim of helping Harry fulfill
the Prophecy.

In this sense, the King's Cross chapter is, so to speak, Dumbledore's &quot;final
explanation&quot;.

Actually I was more disappointed in the epilogue than in any of the actual
chapters of the book.

I'll disagree here.

The whole point of Harry's win is that he chose not to fight.

Am I the only one who finds movies with American soldiers repellent?
They are carrying so much artillery they can hardly stand. I have always
found this incongruous in the otherwise excellent Stargate shows. The US
soldiers are *always* holding machine guns, even when they are just
visiting people.

Of course in the real world there have to be people who fight, but the
point of this book is that peace is better. And all those readers who
desire awful endings for Umbridge and others have not got the point of
the series.

Are you a deatheater?  LOL lighten up.  Those who want Umbridge to
suffer is just a joke. If it came down to it, none would kill her if
she were real.  They are merely expressing angst for Harry and want a
little justice.  I have this feeling that people all over the world
have the wrong ideas of Americans and you are expressing that here. I
think you have developed a predjudice (sounds so). I find that very
disheartening and sad.  I am American and proud of it.  Do not judge
everything so surfacely.  We are human beings who take the art of
&quot;freedom&quot; so seriously that some people carry it to extreme; mostly
with the &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot; that we enjoy.  We are EXPRESSING only.
that is not ACTION.  Please remember that?  I would appreciate it
personally if you did the next time you read something along those
lines... ask yourself if you know the individual enough to think they
are evil enough to want someone dead. I think not.  Ask our men and
women in the service.... I live in the military area (we are the
largest military area I believe in the US or second).  I was in the
Air Force and my husband retired Air Force.  His dad was Retired Navy,
his brother in the Marines, his other brother in the Army; my nephew
is in the Army in Iraq right now, My brother in law in the Navy and my
own son did a short while in the Reserves.  NONE of us would want to
kill anyone!  We may say that out of frustration, but we don't mean
it.  So lighten up!~

Actually, they weren't order members who couldn't beat her. They were
DA members, and unqualified wizards.

Molly Weasley, on the other hand, is a complete badass, such that all
the men in her family were scared of her.  There's a reason the phrase
&quot;mother-bear&quot; is in existance.  I'm curious as to why you think a

to Voldemort's first war, and had just lost one of her sons in the

been practicing for the eventuality that she will need to protect her
children.

Most people found this scene to be superficially similar to
a scene from The Matrix series.  Upon slightly deeper
reading, it's obviously allegorical.  But there's something
of a twist, in that it's actually all in Harry Potter's mind.
It's not really Dumbledore in Harry's dream, but Rowling
makes this unobvious in order to plant one last misdirection.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Once again, everything was either as
&gt; planned or as predicted.
">

No, there was literally a &quot;flaw in the plan&quot;.  At the time
of King's Cross, Harry's subconscious incorrectly guessed
at what the flaw was--and this was reflected in what
Dumbledore of his dream said.  But Harry figured out
the truth by the time of his final confrontation with
Voldemort.

You totally missed the point of Harry's debate with
Voldemort.  It had nothing to do with Snape, or even
the details of Elder Wand succession.  Regardless of
the Elder Wand, Harry Potter had already won.
Voldemort, who had already been horribly afraid of
Harry Potter, knew he was defeated and trapped,
and it was all he could do to keep up a brave face.
He didn't really need to know all the details--he knew
that he had just failed to kill Harry Potter even with
the most powerful wand in history and with a helpless
Harry Potter who didn't even try to fight back.  He
KNEW he was beaten, and he KNEW Harry Potter
was about to kill him, and he was utterly terrified
of it!  From his perspective, Harry Potter was just
toying with his prey--as he himself had done so many
times in the past.

But Harry Potter wasn't just toying with Voldemort.
Harry Potter was trying to save Voldemort's soul,
to whatever extent was possible.  THAT was the
point of his lengthy debate.  Harry Potter wanted
Voldemort to show some remorse--the only thing
which could at least bind his rendered soul back
together.

You might protest, as Ron did, that it's not much
of a consolation that your soul is whole if you're
dead anyway.  Hermione's retort can be taken
as the final word on that question.

Dueling is a sophisticated skill, and as such requires a lot of high-
level practice. Would an enraged mother defending her child suddenly
become capable of playing championship tennis? An emotional surge can
provide certain primitive abilities (temporary fearlessness, increased
strength, or indifference to pain), but not learned, complex skills.

There is no evidence or suggestion of that in the novels. All we saw
was a Molly Weasley whose anxieties for her family prevented her from
even dispatching a boggart properly.

December 8, 1941.  All the service recruiting offices in the US had
lines in front of them.  It's not only Americans who do this.

I do think that in the end JKR was in a bit of a hurry to get done with
the series.  Certainly the Epilogue shows this.
I don't believe she really planned to write one, but the editors
insisted.  It stinks, badly.

One should never underestimate a mother protecting her child.  There are
documented cases of superhuman efforts in this situation.  In addition,
there is every indication that Molly is a pretty powerful witch.  Even
Dumbledore expresses some fear about getting her angry.
I have little doubt that anger, and a desire to protect one's child
would give a woman extreme power for just that situation..  Bella was
fighting three young witches, and was likely pretty much at the end of
her strength.

IIRC the Prewetts, Molly´s brothers, were great duellers and were
bested only by having 5 DEs against them. So maybe her duelling
abilities predate her marriage (she was in the original OotP,

And as for the rest appearing... don't forget they now had a clearly
defined target. Hogwarts and it's students had risen up on the side of
all that's good in a final battle to rid the world of evil.

Suddenly instead of not knowing who was a DE and who was a friend...
all was revealed. Voldemort was there with an army and the children
were fighting to the death to finish him off!! Powerful stuff.

In some ways it was almost like the Christian prophecy of Armageddon

Don't know where you got that from... an AJ can be blocked with
'Protego' a shield charm... and in Harry's case at least... by the
disarming charm 'Expelliarmus'. :)

Can you *really* see Julie Walters bounding around walls like Yoda?? I

&gt;&gt;&gt; hard to picture her going &quot;ape-shit&quot; believably in battle. The movie
&gt;&gt;&gt; Weasleys have always been kindly/comic characters for the most part.

Let me tell you a story here: (a true one).
When I was in high school, I was riding the school bus home, and we
stopped to let several people off who all lived on the same dead-end
street, and the bus just stopped at the end.  We were on a highway, and
the people getting off the bus had to cross the highway to reach their
street.  I was looking into the bus mirror and saw a car come past the
bus, and then a body went flying over the car, to land on the street.  A
few seconds later, I watched a very obese woman do a 9 second 100 yards.
No lie, that woman was running faster than I have ever seen ANYONE run
to get to her son who was lying in that street, bleeding, with compound
fractures of both legs, and a head injury.
I KNOW from experience what a mother's love can make possible!  BTW, I
NEVER get impatient about waiting for a school bus unloading children.
That image of the boy flying over the car is one of those things I would
rather never have seen.

&gt; Harry certainly seems able do perform much better under extreme duress,
&gt; so why not Molly Weasley?
">

Harry becomes more *powerful* when he's agitated and puts his emotions
behind a spell, but he doesn't become more *skilled*. Power is largely
a matter of strength of will and ability to focus, whereas skill
depends more on intelligence (to learn spells correctly) and dedicated
practice. When Harry was desperate to save Sirius at the end of
&quot;Prisoner of Azkaban,&quot; he was able to cast a whopper of a Patronus
Charm -- a single spell that he had already learned how to do -- by
putting the full force of his will and emotions behind it. Harry has a
powerful will, and hence can be a powerful wizard whose magic has huge
effects. However, emotional agitation doesn't help him learn spells or
perform more skillfully in complicated situations. When he needed to
use the summoning charm to fight the dragon in &quot;Goblet of Fire,&quot; he
had to learn it from Hermione and practice it painstakingly. His
emotions about the task didn't help him. Similarly, when he was
enraged at Snape at the end of &quot;Half-Blood Prince,&quot; his dueling
performance was poor. His heightened emotions didn't help him shoot
straight or cast a nonverbal spell successfully; if anything, they
hindered him.

Yes, but as I've tried to point out several times in this thread, the
effects of an epinephrine flood are primitive. You might be able to
perform unexpected feats of strength, run extra fast, or ignore a
painful injury, but you won't be able to play chess better, beat a
tennis champion, or win a fencing match against an expert.

&gt; &gt; potentially violent witch.

&gt; She could be highly skilled.  And very bright and quite clever.  Just
&gt; because her duelling practice or whatever wasn't shown, doesn't mean
&gt; it didn't happen.  People rise to the occasion.  Would you say that
&gt; Ripley in the Alien movies couldn't have been a badass? She was a
&gt; worker, not a fighter when the first movie came out.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There's a reason the phrase

&gt; &gt; strength, or indifference to pain), but not learned, complex skills.

&gt; Yes, and Molly Weasley, in the 16 years since the death of the Potters
&gt; had LOTS and LOTS more time to practice that than Bellatrix did.
&gt; Bella spent, what 15 of those years in Azkaban, and was certainly not
&gt; practicing then.  So how did SHE get to be such a badass?  It suggests
&gt; to me that it's not *necessarily* high-level practice thing, but
&gt; perhaps something else. Being a fast thinker and having fast
&gt; reflexes, and being creative and flexible might be more important.  We
&gt; have zero evidence either way that Molly did or didn't have those
&gt; abilities.  And fearlessness is absolutely something she does have.
">

You are making a circular argument. Your claim is that because Molly
is depicted as a &quot;badass&quot; in the duel with Bellatrix, there must be a
good explanation for her abilities, so it's reasonable to infer that
she must have been secretly practicing for years or otherwise
developing her skills. However, the debate in this thread (at least
the one I've sort of been trying to have) is whether the depiction of
Molly as formidable in battle is plausible in the first place. You
can't demonstrate its plausibility by just assuming the badass ability
exists and then reasoning backward to a source for it.

Obviously, it's impossible to prove that Molly was *not* privately
honing her dueling skills by practicing for years, since so little of
her life is described in the novels. So if you prefer to assume that
training was going on behind the scenes, fine. I'm just saying that
there is no direct textual support for such an assumption, because
there isn't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; &gt; There is no evidence or suggestion of that in the novels. All we saw
&gt; &gt; was a Molly Weasley whose anxieties for her family prevented her from
&gt; &gt; even dispatching a boggart properly.

&gt; There's a BIG difference between dispatching a relatively harmless
&gt; boggart, than being in the line of fire of one of the more powerful
&gt; witches in the world.

So because Molly failed at the easy task, she was more likely to
succeed at the difficult task? :)

&gt; Ok looks like I missed something... what was the 'flaw' that his
&gt; subconscious got wrong??
">

Based on what Voldemort said just before killing Snape,
Harry incorrectly thought that Snape was the master
of the Elder Wand, and that when Voldemort killed Snape
he became the new master of the Elder Wand.  This would
make sense to Voldemort, because for him defeating
someone always means killing him.  Snape killed
Dumbledore, therefore Snape defeated Dumbledore,
therefore Snape was the master of the Elder Wand.
He killed Snape, therefore he defeated Snape, therefore
he was now the master of the Elder Wand.

Harry's peek into Snapes memories revealed a new
piece of evidence--that Dumbledore conspired with
Snape for Snape to kill him.  Harry put two and two
together and figured that if Dumbledore meant for
Snape to kill him, that therefore Dumbledore meant
Snape to become the new master of the Elder Wand.

Thus, the dream Dumbledore admitted that his plan
was for Snape to become master of the Elder Wand.
This is something the real Dumbledore wouldn't have
admitted, of course, because it wasn't true.  But that's
what Harry's slow-witted brain figured at the time
(this theory actually makes no sense for several
reasons, but Harry never was quick on the uptake).

According to this false premise, the flaw in the plan
was that Voldemort might figure it out and kill
Snape.  This line of thinking directly leads into
questions which reveal how stupid the false premise
was.  To wit:

If Dumbledore meant Snape to become the master
of the Elder Wand, then surely he would have at least
told Snape something about the Elder Wand.

If Snape knew something about the Elder Wand, then
surely he would have taken at least some minimal
measures to prevent Voldemort from getting his
hands on it.  He had months as Headmaster of
Hogwarts during which he could have planted a fake,
just like the fake Griffindor sword.

No, the theory that Dumbledore meant Snape to
become master of the Elder Wand falls apart upon
anything beyond the most superficial examination.
Still, Harry's kind of dumb, so it usually takes him
months to figure out this sort of thing.  It's
uncharacteristically clever of him to work it out
in such a short time.

&gt;Most people found this scene to be superficially similar to

I disagree.  I think the setting simply follows one particular concept
of the afterlife, namely, the idea that the afterlife will be
customized to fit the individual's thoughts and desires. The idea is
that the heaven (and perhaps hell) would be mutable, reflecting what
the individual prefers. Remember the film &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; (with
Robin Williams) ?  Same concept. As Dumbledore says to Harry, &quot;It's
your party.&quot;

In a spiritual realm, without a body, after all, everything _would_ be
in your mind, so to speak.  It's all in your mind, but it's all very
real.  Just a different form of reality than what we're used to here
in this life.  Which is what Dumbledore said to Harry at their
parting:

“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on
earth should that mean that it is not real?”

In part, the everyday people entering the fray was a matter of
practical survival.  The parents and shopkeepers and other &quot;civilians&quot;
realized that this was it, the turning point -- if Voldemort won, they
would spend the rest of their lives being ruled and tortured by this
sadistic maniac.  Almost all of them are mixed blood.  They couldn't
afford to sit on the sidelines. If there was a way to help, they had
to help, if only for their own selfish interests.  Add to that a mob
psychology (people always feel braver when they're part of a group),
and a bit of public shame over sitting on the sidelines, and I don't
see it as all that unbelievable...

Yes, to stop other curses, not to shield against the AK.  Actually,

Sad situation though. I did see my cousin get hit by a car (he was
alright); I was about 9 I think.  We were walking to the store, he ran
across the street without looking and the car hit him.  He went into
the air and it was like slow motion....till he hit the car then the
ground.  The person got out of the car, took him and raced off.  We
freaked out and myself and his brother ran home and said &quot;dennis got
hit by a car and they stole him&quot;.  Our parents were so confused.
Anyway, he just had two broken ribs and some bruises etc.  He was
lucky.  Later at 21, his brother not so lucky.  Hit a tree while
chasing his girlfriend on a motocycle.  Super sad.  Hope the boy you
mentioned lived.

I don't think so.  From the HP Lexicon:

&gt; &gt;Most people found this scene to be superficially similar to

&gt; &gt;It's not really Dumbledore in Harry's dream, but Rowling

&gt; I disagree.  I think the setting simply follows one particular concept
&gt; of the afterlife, namely, the idea that the afterlife will be
&gt; customized to fit the individual's thoughts and desires. The idea is
&gt; that the heaven (and perhaps hell) would be mutable, reflecting what
&gt; the individual prefers. Remember the film &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; (with
&gt; Robin Williams) ?  Same concept. As Dumbledore says to Harry, &quot;It's
&gt; your party.&quot;

I'm not sure which part of what I said you're disagreeing with.
If we take the concepts from &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;, then
we can note that just because someone looks like Dumbledore
doesn't mean that he actually is Dumbledore.  But that just
opens up an unnecessary can of worms.

The simplest explanation is that the &quot;Dumbledore&quot; of Harry's
dream/vision is something conjured up whole cloth from
Harry's own mind.  Whether this is a simple dream or something
more spiritual isn't obvious, of course.  But it's a little
disappointing that the &quot;Dumbledore&quot; Harry sees and talks
to can't be the &quot;real&quot; Dumbledore.

&gt; &gt; Yes, and Molly Weasley, in the 16 years since the death of the Potters
&gt; &gt; had LOTS and LOTS more time to practice that than Bellatrix did.
&gt; &gt; Bella spent, what 15 of those years in Azkaban, and was certainly not
&gt; &gt; practicing then.  So how did SHE get to be such a badass?  It suggests
&gt; &gt; to me that it's not *necessarily* high-level practice thing, but
&gt; &gt; perhaps something else. Being a fast thinker and having fast
&gt; &gt; reflexes, and being creative and flexible might be more important.  We
&gt; &gt; have zero evidence either way that Molly did or didn't have those
&gt; &gt; abilities.  And fearlessness is absolutely something she does have.

&gt; You are making a circular argument. Your claim is that because Molly
&gt; is depicted as a &quot;badass&quot; in the duel with Bellatrix, there must be a
&gt; good explanation for her abilities, so it's reasonable to infer that
&gt; she must have been secretly practicing for years or otherwise
&gt; developing her skills. However, the debate in this thread (at least
&gt; the one I've sort of been trying to have) is whether the depiction of
&gt; Molly as formidable in battle is plausible in the first place. You
&gt; can't demonstrate its plausibility by just assuming the badass ability
&gt; exists and then reasoning backward to a source for it.
">

Well, I *do* think she's a badass prior to the duel, but you brushed
my reasons aside (everyone's scared of her, even, to some extent
dumbledore, and she's clever etc., and she's very protective). Even if
she's merely a domineering &quot;force of nature&quot;, I'm not sure that
matters. I also demonstrated that she had a lot of motivation - the
loss of her brothers, and the loss of one of her sons. She has 8
people she'd die to protect, and Bella only 1.

You on the other hand, basically suggested that she couldn't possibly
be a good duellist because she's just a housewife.  You also suggested
that duelling was a highly skilled sport, but you fail to demonstrate
how Bellatrix got so good given that she just spent 15 years in prison
without a wand or the ability to practice.  So that suggests to me
that there's a LOT more to it than &quot;skill&quot;.

Since neither of us can demonstrate with any certainty where EITHER
woman would have picked up their skills (though from a logical
standpoint, if practice *is* important, it seems to me that Molly is
more likely to have been motivated to practice over the years, given
her protectiveness and children, and assumption that V would come back
some day, whereas Bella was in prison for most of it, plus had a sense
of hubris that would have made her think she didn't need to practice
as she already knew she was a badass). And if being a good duelist
isn't solely from practice and skill, then well, Molly's force of
nature personality and protective mother-bearishness might be enough
to make her better. Plus she wasn't crazy, or had a sence of hubris.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Obviously, it's impossible to prove that Molly was *not* privately
&gt; honing her dueling skills by practicing for years, since so little of
&gt; her life is described in the novels. So if you prefer to assume that
&gt; training was going on behind the scenes, fine. I'm just saying that
&gt; there is no direct textual support for such an assumption, because
&gt; there isn't.
">

True. But neither is there textual support that Bellatrix could have
gotten good either. Like Molly, she just *was* good, and you don't
seem to have trouble believing that.  The first time she dueled, you
accepted that she was a badass, with no textual support for that,
either.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; There is no evidence or suggestion of that in the novels. All we saw
&gt; &gt; &gt; was a Molly Weasley whose anxieties for her family prevented her from
&gt; &gt; &gt; even dispatching a boggart properly.

&gt; &gt; There's a BIG difference between dispatching a relatively harmless
&gt; &gt; boggart, than being in the line of fire of one of the more powerful
&gt; &gt; witches in the world.

&gt; So because Molly failed at the easy task, she was more likely to
&gt; succeed at the difficult task? :)
">

Well, yes, actually, but not in the way you just stated it. When you
KNOW you are dealing with a harmless boggart that can't hurt you in
the least, then it's OK to break down and cry when you see the bodies
of your sons, especially when you know that it's not real.  In other
words she had nothing to lose in that situation.

On the other hand, when your life and the lives of your children
REALLY ARE threatened, you are much more likely to actually ACT.
Because the alternative is devestating.

Here's a real life example that I think might demonstrate what I
mean.  I'm a mother. I have a 5 year old daughter.  When I see stories
about parent's losing their children, I cry.  Totally weepy.  Kind of
embarassingly so.  When my husband and I wrote our will, I cried.  On
the other hand, when I think she's in danger, I ACT.  I hear a big
thump from upstairs, I don't start crying, I dart up the stairs and go
see if she needs help.  When I held her up so she could see over the
railing, I do it, but clutch her tight, so she won't fall.    One
time, I saw a baby (not my own) start to fall off a chair in the
waiting room at the doctor's office, and I dived across the aisle,
bruised up both knees, but caught the little girls before she hit the
floor.  When my stepson was a toddler, he fell off a coffee table and
bit his tongue and had blood POURING out of his mouth. My husband
broke down slightly in his panic, but I didn't. I made the decision
that we were heading to the hospital, got them into the car and drove
like a bat out of hell to the ER.  So despite my being an emotional
wreck at the IDEA of children dying or suffering, when push comes to
shove, I rise to the occasion when need be. I think this is a common
phenomenon.

Either way, I think you've decided that it was unrealistic of Molly
Weasily to be good enough to defeat Bellatrix, and I doubt that
anything I have to say will change your mind.  Correct?

There should be *lots* of nasty ways to kill somebody other than with an
AK.  Accio Aorta, Levintestine, Rectumsempra...

But I do wonder...why do the Death Eaters waste so much time &quot;duelling&quot;
or exchanging curses with opponents when they could just be AK'ing
everybody, no need for finesse since it can't be blocked.  (Except by
characters absolutely essential to sales of the book.)

Possibly because the magical effort involved is too much to be doing
constantly. It would be easier to stun someone or full body bind them than
it would be to kill them.
