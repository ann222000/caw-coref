For the last week or so, I've been having a problem with one or two incoming
calls a day where the phone doesn't ring and the call is dumped directly to
voicemail.

My phone was on, not in use and I'm in a strong signal area.

Is this a phone issue or a system issue?

Happens to me too.  I'll be sitting right next to the phone or have
it in the car and it's on.  Then all of a sudden I get a notification that
I have voicemail.

There are 832 freqs available to the cellular companies but they don't
get all of them, they all share.  Also all cell sites don't have all the
freqs
available so, if the particular site your near is busy, it will forward the
call to voicemail.  You will always get a signal but that's just coming
from the control channel.

Hope this helps

It happened to me for the first time on my 8300 2 nights ago. Just a glitch
I guess.

Most likely system but there isn't any thing that can be done abou it.
If there is any probem between the wired phone system and the cellular
network,the call goes to voice mail. If the Location Register loses your
phone, straight to voice mail.  No traffic channel available? Voicemail.
Serving cell hosed? Voicemail. Software being downloaded? You might have a
pilot channel here for bars but calls are going to voicemail.  Why you have
a pilot channel during software loads is stupid but that's the way it is
setup.
On the phone side if the reverse link isn't working right, interference
phone doesn't responed in time, you'll get voice mail.
In your case, I'll bet on cell problems. Verizon knows there is a problem
and will fix it. They don't make money if it's broke.

Thanks for all the info. Let's call it a system issue...

I've had this happen quite often too. It seems that it happens more often if
someone is calling from another VZW phone. Someone can make multiple
attempts to call me from their cell phone and constantly get dumped to my
voicemail. But if in the middle of it all, I call my number from a landline,
it goes right through. I suspect that "In-network" calls get lower priority
during busy times because VZW can't make money on them. Others have told me
that they can't possibly do that. I don't normally go in for conspiracy
theories, but I think I want to nurture this one a little while longer.

I hadn't though of that but connecting the dots, I bet they control it from
those black helicopters I often see hovering nearby when this happens..

The reason I no longer work at Lucent is that when my Tech Manager asked my
opinion about training someone to do the sam job as I did but in China. I
gave him my opinion in no uncertain terms.
