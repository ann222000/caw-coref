Bought Tesco barbecue Mini chicken breast fillets £2.99 for 350g,
2 for £5. Eating it tonight, I thought something wasn't quite right,
they tasted too soft. Further examination on rear of packaging revealed
that the chicken content is 56%. The rest is potato starch, wheat
and rice flour. What a let down. Doh!

That is revolting, not only because I am vegetarian, but it's reconstructed
meat.  Meat eaters are ripped off by supermarkets.  The meat you are eating
is what is washed off the bones with high pressure water and scooped off the
floor before moulding in to shape and adding salt.  You're lucky to get
other additives, fat and flavour enhancers.
You're better off buying a roasted chicken from Tesco and taking it home.
Reconstructed meat is terrible and I will not even tell you what is in black
pudding and sausage.

That was my thought. The front clearly said &quot;chicken breast fillets&quot;.
With only 56% chicken, this seem a bit misleading. I feel cheated for £5.

That was my thought. Such products are usually labelled &quot;reformed meat&quot;,
and I always avoid it. No such labelling on this package. So I examined
the meat, and it did have some structure of chicken meat. But in the mouth
it felt soft like reformed meat. I think Tesco must be sailing close to
the wind with this one.

I've just sent an email to Kavli (makers of Primula Cheese) about their
'Primula spring onion dip' - it was awful, had little taste and
was..plain and simple yuck!

While looking for their contact details on the box, I noticed the list
of ingredients:

#1 Water
#2 Hydrogenated Sunflower Oil

Eww.

I normally make my own dips from a base of cream cheese and Greek
yoghurt but was feeling lazy - that taught me!

It's a cheapo line for lower or lower-middle class demographics, chicken
fillets coated in ***Barbeque*** 'slime'.

Chicken is chicken, is sold as such, and looks like chicken at the point of
sale. Coated chicken, as anyone can clearly see in the clear package via the
online store, is always going to be inferior.

So I think you're being misrepresentative of the product, although
disappointed nonetheless.

Next time, just buy 'chicken fillets' that look like chicken, not
***Barbeque*** chicken fillets that looks like they have a coating.

I've just read the Which? report on bbq food, about burgers and
sausages. A 'sausage' need only contain only 30% meat, and 'meat' may
contain 30% fat and 25% 'connective tissue'. So the real meat content
may be about 15%. Nice.

I can see your point, although I'm surprised that this particular range of
products is such a world away the Finest range.
Tesco mid-market meals used to be just that, but I do think they have made a
mistake in lowering their output if your experience is typical.

It's the kind of product that I would expect to buy at ASDA, which is
generally lower quality IMHO.

Tesco's share price has been hit by about 18% mark down in the last month,
due to poor sales growth, and people have leess spare change.
I think they are looking for profits by lowering some standards in some
places, which I think will have a compounding effect on their bottom line.

I think we often buy automatically when there is attractive packaging and
a 'buy two' offer. We inherently trust supermarkets &quot;It can't be that bad,
surely they must have expertise...&quot;. I thought that as long as i avoided
reformed products, it would be OK. But it this was £5 down the drain. I'm
seriously thinking going back to the shop with the second packet and
complain, just for the hell of it. Of course it will cost me more in
time and petrol.

That's the trouble with the Germans so literal they seem to think you
should be getting what you paid for and not just something that contains
a bit of what you paid for. Its like when you buy proper German Bier
they don't add a ruck of chemicals to make it behave like proper Bier
Like their  smoked sausage as well.

the slurry coming off the line before its dried  spun and mixed with
nasties. I've seen the bleached bones after the high pressure treatment

I absolutely love proper black pudding.

Unfortunately, Holiday Inn have decided that black pudding should
contain huge amounts of oatmeal and too many spices. Ruined my breakfast
this morning, that did.

To be honest, I think you get a massively varying quality of product at all
the big supermarkets now. Even M&amp;S produces some really dire stuff now,
which is equalled, or surpassed by the likes of JS, Tesco etc. I'm not
saying that M&amp;S isn't better across the board, but the label is no

I generally shop at Asda first, then JS. Tesco I often go into at

I agree wholehearted with that. I often buy German meats and other stuff
from LIDL. They have unusual brand names but it's quite good.

The supermarket I dislike the most is Morrison, as I have been misled
a few times. The worst case was when they clearly sign posted 33% extra
free for frozen scampi, but the bag didn't contain 33% extra weight.
When complaining, they said the sign was up because they expected a
delivery next week!!! Probably, many customers were just fooled.

&gt; Morrison is the supermarket I like the most I judge places by quality

LIDL does not have a full product range, so I also shop in other places.
But their cooked meats from Germany are quite good. Its a store where you
can stock up for basic items.

Take the packaging (or the original receipt) back to Tesco and get a
refund. Most of the supermarket's do this.
