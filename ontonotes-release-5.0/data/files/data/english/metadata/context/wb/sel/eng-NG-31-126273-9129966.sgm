On the morning following my release from Brixton Prison, I
proceeded to the House of Commons at my usual hour of 10.15 a.m.; an
action which appeared to cause no little surprise. It was not long
before Jews and their friends were on my trail, and that of the Right Club.

A string of provocative questions soon appeared on the Order Paper;
but, like Gallio who, when the Jews took Sosthenes, and beat him before
the Judgment seat, &quot;cared for none of these things,&quot; I gave no sign of
interest. The reporters in the Press Galleries were then turned on, to
endeavour to extract from me some, at least, of the names in 'the Red
Book' of the Right Club membership.

Now the names in the Red Book of members of the Right Club were, as
the newspapers have shrieked aloud, kept strictly private, with the sole
object of preventing the names becoming known to the Jews. The sole
reason for this privacy was the expressed wish of the members themselves.

To me, personally, the keeping of the names secret was only a
disadvantage. It facilitated misrepresentation of every kind by my
enemies; the publication of the names would have been of great
assistance to me in every way. The sole reason for this stipulation on
joining by so many members was the well-grounded fear of Jewish
retaliation of a serious nature.

I remember in particular the conversation on this subject with one
of these reporters from the Press Gallery of the House of Commons. He
was an engaging young man, and particularly importunate. Would I not let
him have just a few of the names? I said to him:

&quot;Supposing your name had been amongst those in the Red Book; and
supposing that in disregard of my promise to you not to reveal it, I
proceeded to communicate it to the press; and supply that definite
evidence that you were a member of a society to fight against Jewish
domination over Britain: you would not keep your job with your paper
for six months.&quot;

&quot;I shouldn't keep it for six minutes,&quot; was the prompt reply.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; I answered. Â &quot;Now you can see why I can't give you the
name of even one member of the Right Club from the Red Book. You
yourself confirm their worst fears.&quot;

Many hundreds of poor fellows find themselves in such a position
today; indeed, hundreds is merely a matter of expression. The real
number must be prodigious. How many, one might ask, can afford to run
the risk to their livelihood, which is involved in letting it be known
that they are aware of the Jewish grip and prepared to oppose it.

Even the wealthiest and most influential magnates of the land dare
not brave the wrath of organised Jewry as the story regarding the
*/Daily Mail /*controlling shares on pp. 6 and 7 of my statement to the
Speaker shows. (See Appendix I.)

Not only in Britain has this been the case, but perhaps even more
noticeably in the U.S.A., as the diaries of the late Mr James Forrestal
prove.

The Forrestal Diaries published by the Viking Press, New York,
1951, only reach me as this book goes to press. Coming from a man of
high integrity, who was U.S. Navy Under Secretary from 1940, and
Secretary for Defence from 1947 until his resignation and suspicious
death a few days later in March 1949, they are of the utmost
significance. The most important revelation therein is dated the 27th
December, 1945 (pages 121 and 122):

&quot;Played golf today with Joe Kennedy (Joseph P. Kennedy, who was
Roosevelt's Ambassador to Great Britain in the years immediately
before the war). I asked him about his conversations with Roosevelt
and Neville Chamberlain from 1938 on.

He said Chamberlain's position in 1938 was that England had nothing
with which to fight and that she could not risk going to war with
Hitler.

Kennedy's view: That Hitler would have fought Russia without any
later conflict with England if it had not been for Bullitt's
(William C. Bullitt -- a half-Jew -- then Ambassador to France)***
urging on Roosevelt in the summer of 1939 that the Germans must be
faced down about Poland; neither the French nor the British would
have made Poland a cause of war if it had not been for the constant
needling from Washington.

Bullitt, he said, kept telling Roosevelt that the Germans wouldn't
fight, Kennedy that they would, and that they would overrun Europe.
Chamberlain, he said, stated that America and the world Jews had
forced England into the war.&quot;

If Mr. Forrestal's information regarding the impulses behind the
recent war needed any confirmation, they have already had it from the
outspoken statements of Mr. Oswald Pirow, former South African Defence
Minister, who told the Associated Press on the 14th January, 1952, in
Johannesburg that

&quot;Chamberlain had told him that he was under great pressure from
World Jewry not to accommodate Hitler.&quot;

A second most important revelation in the Forrestal Diaries
concerns Zionism. It is clear from the entries, that by December, 1947,
Mr. Forrestal was becoming greatly concerned by the intervention of the
Zionists into American politics. He records conversations with Mr.
Byrnes and Senator Vandenberg, Governor Dewey and others, in attempts to
lift the Palestine question out of party politics. From this time on he
would seem to have made continuous efforts with that end in view.

The Diary records on the 3rd Feb., 1948 (pages 362 and 363):

&quot;Visit today from Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., who came in with strong
advocacy of a Jewish State in Palestine, that we should support the
United Nations 'decision', I pointed out that the United Nations had
as yet taken no 'decision', that it was only a recommendation of the
General Assembly and that I thought the methods that had been used
by people outside of the Executive branch of the Government to bring
coercion and duress on other nations in the General Assembly
bordered closely onto scandal . . .

I said I was merely directing my efforts to lifting the question out
of politics, that is, to have the two parties agree that they would
not compete for votes on this issue.

He said this was impossible, that the nation was too far committed
and that, furthermore, the Democratic Party would be bound to lose
and the Republicans gain by such an agreement.

I said I was forced to repeat to him what I had said to Senator
McGrath in response to the latter's observation that our failure to
go along with the Zionists might lose the states of New York,
Pennsylvania and California -- that I thought it was about time that
somebody should pay some consideration to whether we might not lose
the United States.&quot;

After a short note by the Editor of the Diaries the entry for the
3rd Feb., 1948, continues (page 364):

&quot;Had lunch with Mr. B. M. Baruch. After lunch raised the same
question with him. He took the line of advising me not to be active
in this particular matter, and that I was already identified, to a
degree that was not in my own interest, with opposition to the
United Nations policy on Palestine.&quot;

It was about this time that a campaign of unparalleled slander and
calumny was launched in the United States press and periodicals against
Mr. Forrestal.So greatly did this appear to have affected him that in
March 1949, he resigned from the U.S. Defence Secretaryship; and on the
22nd of that month was found dead as a result of a fall from a very high
window.
