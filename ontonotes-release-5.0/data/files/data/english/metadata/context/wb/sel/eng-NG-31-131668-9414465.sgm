Everyone wants to be successful in life. But without knowing what is
success, you want to be successful. What are the signs of success? Just
having a lot of money, is that success? Why do you think money means
success? Because money gives you freedom so that you can do whatever you
want. You may have a big bank balance but, you have stomach aches,
ulcers, you may have to go for bypass surgery; can't eat this, can't do
this, can't do that. We spend half our health t o gain wealth and spend
half our wealth to gain back the health. Isn't that funny? Is this
success? It is very bad mathematics.

Look at all those who claim to be successful - are they successful? No,
they are miserable. Then, what is the sign of success? The sign of
success is overwhelming joy, right? It is confidence, compassion,
generosity and a smile that none can snatch away, being really happy and
being able to be more free. These are the signs of a successful person.
