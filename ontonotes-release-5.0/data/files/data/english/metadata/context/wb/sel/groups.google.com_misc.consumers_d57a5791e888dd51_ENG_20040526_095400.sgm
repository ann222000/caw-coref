1. Put all large SUV drivers in the slam house and throw away the keys.
2. Take public transportation when ever possible.
3. Stop buying products that are made in China - if all possible. The
reasons are obvious.
4. Remove Bush from any government office ASAP.
5. Walk to work if it's less than 2 miles. This would be endorsed by your
doctors as well.
6. Become an Amish.
7. Push your congressidiots to promote alternative fuel development.
8. Take appropriate actions against the evil petroleum cartel.
9. Sell your gas guzzling vehicles.
10.Stage protests by stop buying gasoline for at least 2 days. This
requires EVERYONE (excluding emergency service folks) in the country to do
at the same time. While this option is impractical, if only 60% of drivers
join in, this would put a bit of pressure on the greedy scums in the
petroleum business.

What does Bush have to do with it?

Bush has fought regulation intended to protect We The People. We can
all blame OPEC all we want but a good part of the blame goes to the
refiners who have cut back production in order to increase demand.
Bush will never intervene because he and Cheney are more interested in
the welfare of that industry than they are about us. Keep in mind that
this administration has advocated the opposite of conservation. Cheney
told us to turn your heat up, drive whatever you desire regardless of
the consequences. Environmental concerns, conservation and regulation
are jokes to them. If we allow the fox back into the hen house for
another 4 years we deserve what we get.

"/> Refineries in this country are running at over 90% of capacity.

There are only about half as many refineries running in the US as
there were just 25 years ago. But total refinery production is higher
now. That should tell that only the most efficient refineries are
still running.

We could use more refining capacity, but where will we put new
refineries? Will your community welcome a refinery?

suppose a chorus of replies will lay the blame for that on Bush... but
the turmoil goes back much further than he or his dad.)

&gt;&gt;11. Don't buy high-octane gas. Only the most exotic cars need it.
&gt; Yup, including my exotic Mazda. ;}

"/> What Mazda's require it?

As for Mr. Morrisettes suggestion. There are plenty of cars that
require high octane fuel which most people would never consider &quot;most
exotic&quot;... or even somewhat exotic for that matter.

Just about any supercharged car will specify a need for premium fuel.
Supercharging is not reserved for exotic cars.

I will tend to agree with your general suggestion. Don't buy
high-octane fuel. Attention all soccer mom's - your minivans, and
most SUVs don't need premium. Even if your husband tells you to &quot;only
use the good stuff.&quot;

The &quot;good stuff&quot; is a quality fuel that meets the octane requirements
specified by the vehicle manufacturer, not your software developing
husband that thinks he's a car expert because he kicks butt on racing
video games.

If the book says use 87 octane - use it. If the car doesn't run right
- there is probably something wrong with the car, not the octane you
have selected. The ONLY thing that octane ratinsg tell you is the
fuel's resistance to knock (engine pinging). That is the ONLY thing
measured when cctane ratings are calculated. If the car doesn't ping
on 87, you don't gain anything but going to 91. If the car is
supposed to run on 87, but pings, get the car fixed.

Almost all new cars todays are fuel injected. (I can't think of any
that aren't at the moment.) Dirty injectors cause reduce performance
and gas mileage. ALL fuels have cleaning additives - its' required by
law. The additives have to meet minimum standards. Up to that
minimun standard, all brands of gas are the same. But some gasoline
producers have better additives that keep your injectors and fuel
system cleaner.

Higher octane gas will not keep your fuel injectors any cleaner -
that's not what octanes do.

Note that some producers put a little extra cleaning additive in their
premium grades as an marketing incentive. But it isn't the octane
that is cleaning anything.

Repeat after me - In 90% of cars on the road, you will NOT get more
power from your engine or any measurable increase in efficiency by
using 91/92 instead of 87/88. With computer controlled fuel mixture
and ignition timing, you might get 1%-5% better mileage, but you will
be spending 10%-20% more for the gas.

Shell announced in November 2003 that it would be closing the facility

“Since so many people have questioned if the refinery is for sale, I

If it was in my power, I'd gather a global scientific consensus on
estimated oil reserves. Estimates keep getting more accurate and only
fools think oil is infinite (lots of fools out there driving gas
guzzlers).

After each nation had signed a scientific treaty on oil reserves to
include environmental and economic &quot;futures&quot; in the price, oil could
be priced like a precious metal, getting incrementally more costly as
the known supply was depleted. There would of course be slack for an
imperfect market. I don't think even 10% of the public has a clue
about how much oil is out there and how it keeps getting harder to
find. An example is people who think ANWR drilling would make any real
difference. With finite resources, increasing the _supply_ will never
solve the real problem.

Under the watch of a scientific plan, gas &amp; diesel prices would
consistently rise several cents per gallon per year (in addition to
market factors) instead of see-sawing on economic whims that have
little relation to future supplies. We'd have a much better handle on
where oil comes from, how much of it is left and what we need to do to
get off it. The public is too greedy to make smart decisions if the
price doesn't reflect actual scarcity, and that's exactly the case
with oil. An agreement to let _scientists_ ration oil instead of
economists and driving enthusiasts is badly needed.

&gt; I think the idea of letting experts ration oil is a bad idea. If

&gt; market pressures would ration oil more effectively than scientists could.

&gt; In this situation, the speed limit issue would largely become moot because

seriously doubt they have been, as I have been able to find no record of

my observations.

Let's say someone decides that nobody should drive faster than 25mph
because they want the interstate usable for bicycles. Just as good as
carl picking 70mph out of his ass and being a control freak about it.

Not my fault you lack the intelligence to realize that letting control
freaks decide, even when you agree with them, is a bad idea. But that's
no surprise.

See, if carl chose 100mph, I'd still oppose his view. It's fundamentally
flawed. (although, one thing would be different, since it's better to
overpost a speed limit than underpost one generally, it would be safer
to argue for a higher speed limit that is pulled out of one's ass than a
lower one)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think the idea of letting experts ration oil is a bad idea. If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;subsidies were removed, the price would rise to about $15 per gallon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and market pressures would ration oil more effectively than scientists
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;could.

&gt;&gt;&gt; what subsidies do you mean?

&gt;&gt;Let's start with Iraq.

"/> I guess I had this foolish notion that if the US had not intervened in
Iraq in 1991 and kept on intervening to the present that either: (a)
Saddam would have taken over Saudi Arabia and most of the world's oil, and
then he would set the prices; or (b) the Saudis would have developed a
significantly bigger army and they would have passed on the costs to their
customers. Of course the conflict that occurs with either a or b would
probably also reduce oil supply, raising prices.

I also had this foolish notion that nobody would have cared much except
Saddam, the Saudis, and their customers.

But you set me straight. We went over there for WMD, the UN, human
rights, etc.

The problem with diesel right now is retail distribution. Around here
only about 1 in 4 gas stations have it. For the retail consumer (car

it a boutique fuel. Most of the stations that carry diesel near me
charge as much for it as premium unleaded. But the mileage advantge of
a diesel still make the high priced fuel more economical.

make 91 octane gasoline than it does to make 87. It's a couple of
pennies difference - but that is currently translating to $.25 or more

high sulfur diesel fuel in US and emission regulations. I'm guessing there's

"/> I drive a diesel Mercedes, and diesel is definitely the way to
go. They're inexpensive to operate and maintain, they're
reliable as hell, they'll last practically forever with proper
care, and in California at least, they're exempt from smog
checks. No longer having to engage in that silly biennial
ritual was worth making the switch, right there; everything
else is gravy. And newer, turbocharged diesels actually have
decent power.

Unfortunately there's a lot of resistance to diesel passenger
cars in this country. For one thing, they're simply not on
most people's mental radar. And a lot of those who do know
about them reject the idea of driving one because they think
of diesels as being noisy, smellly, sooty, underpowered, and
hard to find fuel for. The GM diesel debacle of the late '70s
didn't help matters.

than regular gasoline. The earliest set of fuel prices that I
remember was from the late Sixties: $.32/gal for premium, $.25/gal
for regular, and $.19/gal for diesel. The prices stayed in that
approximate proportion even as prices went up over the years --
until recently.

Nowadays diesel can still be found priced below regular, but at
least as often it's priced between mid-grade and premium. There
are even a few stations that really gouge you for it, charging
the same price as for high-test. It's a mystery to me why the
relative cost has gone up. It isn't as though there's been a
sudden increase in demand for the stuff or anything. I'd think
that if anything, demand has lessened due to the fact that new
diesel cars haven't been sold in California for several years
now.

summer during high school and a lot of customers, especially

"/> Diesel #1 and #2 are both intended for use in engines. #1 is slighly
thinner, slightly lower lubricating qualities, a lower cetane number
and has a little less energy per pound than D2. #1 is often used in
winter blends of #2 for easier starting. You can probably use #1 or
#2 for heating oil, but they are intended to be engine fuels.

Heating oil is probably closer to kerosene - in fact it may be
kerosene of some type. There are different numbers for kerosene (#1,
#2..). I am not familair with home heating oil as I don't have any
experience using it, nor read much about it.

Kerosene is close, but different than diesel. It's lubricating
qualities are measurably lower but it burns about the same way, IIRC.
Most diesel engines can *run* on kerosene (such as jet fuel) in an
emergency, but a lot of these engines may require the addition of lube
oil in order to avoid damage to fuel pumps, etc.

I used to have a good publication from a major oil company on diesel
that explained the uses all the way up to #6. Locomotives, marine
applications, large generators... I can't find it.

Taxes are determined by the use of the diesel, not the type. Diesel
for non-highway use, such as in boats, farm equipment, power plants,
does not have highway taxed applied. It is dyed red to show that it
wasn't taxed. You cannot use dyed diesel fuel for highway use (in a
truck or car) - well - you can - but if your fuel is inspected and
found to be dyed, the fines start in four digits.

"/> Oh, come on. Diesel exhaust doesn't have an inherently
offensive odor. People only notice it at all because
its different from the odor of the exhaust of gasoline-

My first diesel Mercedes had a device called a trap oxidizer
for collecting and burning off soot in the exhaust. For
whatever reason, this gizmo made the exhaust smell downright
pleasant, with subtle overtones of baking bread. (Too bad
the car was totalled in a hit and run by an uninsured, un-

It's time to put a stop to this ever-tightening spiral

I've not heard whether, if and when smog checks for diesels
are instituted in California, older diesels will even be
affected; there's not much to adjust on them. They might
just be grandfathered in. When new ones are sold here
again, they'll probably be designed with smog checks in
mind and have easy ways to adjust various engine parameters.

What I love about driving a diesel, apart from the practical
aspects already enumerated, is that it allows me to have
things both ways: I can get great mileage _and_ piss off
liberals and the olfactorily hypersensitive.

&gt;I've actually seen the case made that the alaska oil pipe line was
&gt;so well designed with regards to the environment (and the time and
&gt;effort was taken to those ends) that the wildlife is actually aided
&gt;by the pipeline. If I recall correctly the pipeline was a source of
&gt;warmth that critters rather liked... but my memory might be incorrect.

"/> I've seen a number of people on Usenet say that. I have no idea
who gave them the idea though. It is *not* true.

I lived for 20 years just more than a stone's throw from the
pipeline just south of Fairbanks. It is *well* insulated, and
there simply is no heat coming from it. However, the idea that
it was well designed is in fact very true! Construction was
held up for several years while various things were worked out,
and part of that was just exactly what a pipeline design should
be. It wasn't really known at the time what the effects would
be, so of course there were a full range of claims that it would
have no effect or it would be a disaster.

As it turned out, the efforts to accommodate wildlife were well
based, and the effects have been minimal. The elevated portions
are high enough that most animals will go under it. Of course
the buried part is not a problem.

The only negative effect that I know of has to do with pregnant
and calving caribou cows. They won't go near it, and the result
has been a split in the calving of the Central Arctic herd.
However, just as with other oil infrastructure around the
Prudhoe Bay industrial complex, there is a *lot* of room for the
Central Arctic caribou herd, and it is a very small herd. The
coastal plain at Prudhoe is something like 100-150 miles deep,
and the Central Arctic herd peaks at about 30,000 animals.

Compare that to ANWR, where the Porcupine herd calves. First,
there are a minimum of 120,000 animals, and second the coastal
plain is only an average of 25 miles wide on the coastal plain
of ANWR. While at Prudhoe there is room for the caribou to go
elsewhere, at ANWR that is not true.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;As far as ANWR is concerned I really think that oil should be left
&gt;untouched from a practical viewpoint. If we have a real problem (and $2/gal
&gt;gasoline isn't) there will be oil to use. And this applies even if
&gt;a totally environmentally safe way of extracting it is used.

"/> Thank you! My grandchildren and great grandchildren will
appreciate that. When oil hits $200 a barrel, *they* can decide
if it's worth it for them to sell it. I've already spent my
share... ;-)

&gt;&gt;That is not really true. You aren't referring to the term &quot;continental

&gt;&gt;Alaska, but that is for legal purposes. It does not in anyway reflect
&gt;&gt;on the meaning of &quot;continental US&quot;.

&gt;As defined by the US Department of State:
&gt;http://www.state.gov/m/a/als/1722.htm

"/> Like &quot;CONUS&quot;, they are talking about a /legal term/ as used in
various laws and regulations that were being written prior to
Alaska becoming a State. Originally, it was precisely correct.
It became precisely incorrect in 1959, but rather than try to
re-write every law an regulation on the books that used the
term, they just defined it, for the purposes of US Law, to mean
something other than what the words themselves mean, and continued
to use it.

If you look at law, you'll find many terms like that, though
usually for other reasons. If a court sets a precident that a
particular phrase means something in a given context, then for
the purposes of law, that is what it means. Contracts are full
of legalese that fits that description. If you use the legal
term in common conversation, you'll be misunderstood. And if
you use vernacular in a legal contract, a court will rule you
are wrong when there is a conflict with a legal term.

That's why you hire a lawyer to look at contracts, but typically
not to read a Usenet post.

http://www.alaska.com/about/facts/faq/plan/v-include/story/4834395p-4...

&quot;Alaska is part of the continental United States.

Everything on the North American land mass is &quot;continental.&quot;
That includes all of Alaska except for the islands. And even
in the island-packed Inside Passage, Juneau, Hyder, Haines
and Skagway are on the mainland.

The 48 states between Washington, California, Maine and
Florida are &quot;contiguous,&quot; meaning they have common borders.

The only state not in the continental United States is
Hawaii.&quot;

&gt;term applied prior to Alaskan statehood? Specific cites would help.

"/> It was commonly in use. Particularly by the military, but also
by the FAA and other Federal agencies, because while Alaska and
Hawaii were not states, they were owned by the US and yet they
were considered as &quot;overseas&quot; postings for pay and benefit
purposes. That is where &quot;CONUS&quot; came from, and it was in use
prior to 1959. &quot;Continental states&quot; excluded Alaska when Alaska
was not a state.

The IRS code used that term at least as far back as 1954, and
both the Alaska Omnibus Act and the Hawaii Omnibus Act
specifically redefined the term to exclude Alaska and
Hawaii... because otherwise all of the IRS code would have had
to be re-published using a different term.

See

Alaska Omnibus Act, PL 86-70;  73 Stat. 141
[H.R. 7120], Sec. 22, para b.;

Hawaii Omnibus Act, PL 86-624; 74 Stat. 411
[H.R. 11602], Sec. 18, para b.

Here is a short discussion, though they don't actually quote
the above laws nor give references, but both are fairly easy
to find with google.

http://www.fact-index.com/c/co/continental_united_states.html

I'm not sure just how old the term is, but it no doubt goes back
*much* farther than the 1950's, and probably was used prior to
1900.

&gt;&gt;It was commonly in use. Particularly by the military, but also

&gt;&gt;prior to 1959. &quot;Continental states&quot; excluded Alaska when Alaska
&gt;&gt;was not a state.

&gt;&gt;The IRS code used that term at least as far back as 1954, and
&gt;&gt;both the Alaska Omnibus Act and the Hawaii Omnibus Act
&gt;&gt;specifically redefined the term to exclude Alaska and
&gt;&gt;Hawaii... because otherwise all of the IRS code would have had

&gt;&gt;I'm not sure just how old the term is, but it no doubt goes back

&gt;&gt;&gt;Why is it that developmentally challenged people feel the use of

&gt;&gt;&gt;speaking people?

&gt;&gt;He is exactly correct about &quot;informal forums&quot;.

&gt;No he is not. Not bothering to spell, using all caps, all lower case,
&gt;not understanding how to communicate - all of those mean you should
&gt;shut up and spend your time finishing first grade.

"/> It might be, and might not. You snipped everything that I
previously said about that, as if the above sentence was the
only part you need to deal with if your point is right. I don't
think you should ignore it...

We *can* communicate on Usenet with people who are college
graduates but have never spent a day in a classroom where
English was used, much less taught. We shouldn't care one iota
whether they know how to spell or understand use of caps and
lower case. Perhaps they speak Korean, Chinese or Russian, for
instance.

I talk to Korean people every day, and at least one fits the
above description; she has a college degree but has very little
idea how the English language works in a formal sense. But,
please trust me, this lady could teach you about communications!
She can read Chinese characters as well as Korean, and she has
spent 30 years living where we speak a foreign language. She
writes *wonderful* business letters in &quot;English&quot;, as only a
person who can barely speak the language can... and of course
they are _technically_ horribly incorrect!

At little story about that... She was called for Jury Duty
a bit over a year ago. She asked me what to do, and I basically
told her she doesn't belong on a jury. I wrote a letter to the
court system, pointing out that she does not speak English well
enough to be a juror. She got no reply. I told her to just
ignore the summons (and if they come get here, just throw a fit
in Korean). Fine... But a year later and she gets *another*
jury duty notice. I told her to write her own letter this time.
In Korean, it should just say &quot;I don't understand fucking English.&quot;
She changed it, of course. In Korean, she wrote that she couldn't
read the letter they'd sent, and would like a copy in Korean.

This time they sent her an official notice that she was excused.

(I probably should admit that I'm retired, but spent more than 3
decades in the communications field, and just happen to very
much enjoy the broad topic of &quot;communications&quot; as a point of
discussion.)

I'll say it again, &quot;He is exactly correct about &quot;informal forums&quot;.

That is *not* to say that well formatted, correctly structured
text with correct spelling and grammar is not more effective
than articles which do not have those attributes. But it does
mean that we don't need to hire a proof reader to go over our
text, nor do we expect someone to totally ignore the ideas
communicated simply because the mechanism was not perfect.

However, when people do that, I tend to ignore them...

, I actually think english is defined by usage over time.
So, if enough people use a word a certain way, even if
that was a bad usage, it becomes accepted.

Governments do that in very specific ways, like the word
&quot;pacify&quot; it doesn't mean what it once did. It used to mean
to mollify, or calm but I think the last thing you would
want is the army rangers to come and &quot;pacify&quot; your hometown.

&gt;I believe that you are wrong and refer to the following from

"/> However, nothing in what you have quoted denies what I've said.

What it address is what CONUS means today, not what it meant
when first used or where the term was derived from. Technically
the legal term CONUS is the same as the legal term &quot;Continental
United States&quot;, which in plain language does not mean all of the
continental states, but instead today means only to contiguous
states. In plain language, &quot;continental states&quot; includes Alaska
but the /legal term/ &quot;Continental States&quot; does not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;...The continental United States refers (except sometimes in U.S.
&gt;federal law and regulations) to the largest part of the U.S. that is
&gt;delimited by a continuous border, also referred to as the conterminous
&gt;states, the coterminous states, or the contiguous states, and
&gt;in various specialized contexts, as &quot;CONUS&quot;,

"/> It does *not* say (read the sentence carefully) that &quot;CONUS&quot; is
referenced to &quot;contiquous&quot;, but rather to &quot;continental&quot;. It
says what that means is indeed contiguous, even if that isn't
what it says in plain language. As I've previously noted, in
plain language &quot;continental US&quot; includes Alaska but the *legal
term* used by the Federal government means contiguous simply
because the Alaska Omnibus Act of 1959 redefined it rather than
force republication of the IRS regulations.

Hence, your cite does not support what you are saying. Likewise
there are *many* references available from google that make it
clear that CONUS originated from &quot;Continental US&quot;:

http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1542.pdf
&quot;within the continental United States (CONUS)...&quot;

http://policyworks.gov/org/main/mt/homepage/  mtt/perdiem/perd02d.html
&quot;official travel within CONUS (the continental United States)&quot;

With the Federal regulations filled with such references, you can see
why Congress simply redefined the meaning of the term for purposes of
law when they admitted Alaska as a state.

But the term &quot;continental Europe&quot; does describe something

Did you know that Greenland and Iceland are part of Europe? You
are saying that Greenland, Iceland, England, and Germany are all
on the same continental land mass, and it just isn't so.

If you don't like the Korean example, I can redo it with another

Nobody that has been part of this discussion was unable to spell
their own name. In fact, nobody was unable to correctly do the
things you listed previously (quoted above). You are
manufacturing a scenario which does not fit the circumstances,
any article or any person in this thread.

And, clearly you are dead wrong. Usenet is an informal forum,
and no it is not particularly necessary for everyone to be
precisely correct in every detail of language usage.

What is necessary is that the *point* they make, the *evidence*
they present, and the *logic* of the argument be impeccable.
*Those* are the items that should be the target of critical
analysis in followup articles. The use of English might be
noted, but it should only be for humor or just in passing; it
should *never* be essential to a rebuttal.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And England is not connected to any of those seven land masses.

&gt; Not so. Look it up.

Grænlandssund (also known as Denmark strait, between Iceland and

"/> You mean like this? Google: Greenland continent
http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/gl.htm
Description

Claimed by Denmark in 1380, Greenland is geographically considered
part of the North American continent, and is the world's largest
(non-continent) island, approximately 85% of it covered with ice.

Greenland was granted self-government in 1978 by the Danish
parliament, but Denmark still controls Greenland's foreign affairs,
and the island officially remains a territory of Denmark.

Or like this:

Wich continent does Greenland belongs to?
Is Greenland a Continent itself?
Thanks, Pablo from Buenos Aires!

1. &quot;Continent&quot;

Greenland is part of the North American continent

What he has pointed out is *precisely* the reason there are
those who say Greenland is part of Europe rather than part of
North America, and equally there are those who say the opposite.

There is of course a *vast* difference between that definition
and the business with &quot;continental states&quot;, simply because
Alaska is physically part of the North America continent, while
Greenland is not. The political decision made in the case of
Greenland doesn't fly in the face of physical facts the way the
one with Alaska does.

(I'm willing to admit that the first time I came across the
Greenland is Europe claim, I just about fell out of my chair
at the idea. Of course, the difference is that it took time
measured in seconds to understand... as opposed so some here
that are simply *never* going to catch on.)
