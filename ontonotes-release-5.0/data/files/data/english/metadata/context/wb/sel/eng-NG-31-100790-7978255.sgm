Who's Winning the Console Wars

S&amp;P's Clyde Montevirgen says the Xbox 360 leads in total sales, but
Nintendo's Wii showed the strongest launch numbers.

Just like gamers, holders of video-game stocks should be prepared for battle
and adventurous twists and turns. Last year's wild ride, when the group got
crushed in July and then soared in the fall as Sony's (SNE) PlayStation 3
and Nintendo's Wii were released, left the S&amp;P Home Entertainment Software
index with a small gain of 3.7%, vs. 13.6% for the S&amp;P 500. So far this
year, the group has stayed on a higher path, gaining 2.7% through Jan. 12,
vs. a 0.9% rise in the S&amp;P 500 index. One boost came Jan. 11, when key
player THQ (THQI) hiked its sales and earnings outlook.

Given lofty valuations after the recent price runup, along with some
uncertainty about the timing of launching hit titles, Standard &amp; Poor's
Equity Research analyst Clyde Montevirgen has a neutral outlook for home
entertainment software stocks (see BusinessWeek.com, 12/21/06, &quot;Part 2:
S&amp;P's 2007 Tech Sector Outlook&quot;). He has a buy recommendation on one stock:
Activision (ATVI).

BusinessWeek.com's Karyn McCormack spoke with Montevirgen on Jan. 12 about
the game-console wars and the companies he believes have an edge. Edited
excerpts from their conversation follow.

So far, which company is winning the console war: Sony, Nintendo, or
Microsoft (MSFT)?

Right now, the leader in terms of units sold is Microsoft's Xbox 360-it has
sold 10.4 million units as of the end of 2006. However, the Xbox 360 was
released in November, 2005, so it has had a one-year advantage over the
others. It's a solid base, so that's why it's the leader.

But if you look at who won the launch wars by comparing the launch sales,
the Xbox 360 sold 607,000 units from November, 2005, to yearend 2005. That
comes in third, behind No. 1 Nintendo Wii, which sold 1.1 million units from
its release in November, 2006, to yearend 2006, and second place PlayStation
3, which sold 687,000 units from its November, 2006, launch to yearend 2006.

So the leader in units sold and winner of the launch war are two different
things. Nintendo Wii won the launch war.

What feature makes that console the leader?

I have five things that I look at that I think will determine the winner in
the long run (they aren't listed in order of importance). The first one is
graphics. Once developers unlock the potential of the PS3, I think that it
will have the lead in graphics compared to the other two consoles.

The second feature is game play. I think the Nintendo Wii will win that
because of the interactive gameplay with its motion-sensing controllers. No.
3 is Internet capability. So far, the Xbox 360 has the lead in that, with
Xbox Live. No. 4 is game selection for the consoles, or how many games are
available. Right now, Xbox 360 has the most titles available.

The last is the price. This is why the Nintendo Wii is the leader, because
the price is very attractive. The Wii sells for $250, which is half the
price of the PS3.

What are the outlooks for the PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360 for 2007?

Right now, it's wide open-it's hard to tell. I think we could have two
winners. In the past, PS2 was dominant. This time, it could be wide open
because it's a wider demographic. The hardcore gamers are a little bit
older, and now we have the younger audience and more casual gamers that may
not pay attention to the hardcore features. So we could have two different
winners because the consoles do different things now.

THQ raised its earnings and sales outlook for its fiscal third quarter
(ended Dec. 31) and for fiscal year 2007 on Jan. 11 (sending its stock to a
52-week high). Do you see more good news for the sector?

Yes, we see good news for the sector. Last year, the industry faced a lull
because a lot of gamers were postponing game purchases in anticipation of
the new consoles. The new consoles-the PS3 and Wii-came out in November. As
the installed base grows, you should see a positive effect on the stocks.

I [advise] caution because the stocks have made a substantial runup since
the summer of 2006 and valuations have gotten lofty. I think the release
schedule of video game hit titles and lineups for future titles will help
the shares moving forward. In the meantime, when there's a small user base,
there's a slower release schedule because it costs money to develop the
games and it also depends on which console the games are developed for.

Where does each company stand with releasing titles?

Electronic Arts (ERTS) has a big exposure to PS3. Now that PS3 has had
subpar unit sales results, that might affect EA stock in the near term. It
also affects the timing of the release of games-usually they want to release
games when the console install base gets larger.

For THQ, I believe they did well because of releases for the Wii. They also
have a strong market share lead for the younger audience. THQ makes Cars and
WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007-they both did well, which is why they upped their
outlook.

Activision's franchises include Tony Hawk's Project 8 for PS3 and Xbox 360
and Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam for the Wii. Call of Duty 3 is for all
consoles, and Guitar Hero 2 is out only for PS2 but they will probably
release it for other consoles because of its success on PS2.

What are the hot games coming out this year?

One of the biggest games this year is Take-Two Interactive's (TTWO) Grand
Theft Auto IV. Although details are under wraps, it should be out on
multiple consoles in late 2007.

The other game is Halo 3, which Microsoft produces-that's exclusively for
the Xbox 360, and should help sales of that console.

There is a huge following for those two games.

What are your recommendations on the stocks?

I have a buy on Activision because they have a really strong library of hit
games.

I have a hold on Electronic Arts. They also have a strong library of games,
but their valuation is relatively high.

I also have a hold on THQ, because I think their lineup for 2008 looks
weaker compared with their peers.

And I have a sell on Take-Two Interactive because I think they have the
least hit titles among their peers. Also, the stock's valuations are
equivalent to some of their peers that have more hit titles.

That article is hardly objective, and rather subjective. So many
contingencies comparing the three consoles, it's easy to determine that you
can get any scenario on which is doing well (or not) at any given time. I
can say this; at the end of 2006, MS stated (and had been pretty much
confirmed) that it had sold 10.4 million 360s.

The Wii had 1.1 mil at that point, and it is a safe bet that the PS3 had at
least a million. But if you look at today's numbers, the Wii is pushing 9
million, the PS3 close to 4 million, and the 360 is around 11.5 million
(more or less). That said, the 360 has only sold around (more or less) 1
million units from January 07 through June 07. I think most can do the math
on what the other consoles did, the 360 is doing badly the past 6 months.

The Wii is selling because its novelty is still strong, but won't last more
than another year (my guess only). The PS3's price and total lack of games
is what is killing it. Now, the 360 has had mainly crappy games (except for
a few good ones) since the beginning of the year and the hradware issues are
finally coming to reality. It's hard to say what has slowed the 360 sales to
a crawl, but having a combination of crappy game releases (en mass) this
year with the hardware bullshit cover-up from MS, you can see why.

If MS had taken care of the garbage out units with better builds and
released some better games, they may have hit their predicted 15 million
sold by this past June, but we know the numbers now. I got a feeling this
may bite them in the ass, only if Sony doesn't pick up the ball with getting
the great exclusives out.

I'm bummed really! I have to admit, other than having my first 360 replaced
after a year of having it, with a new one, this unit has been flawless
(knock on wood). But the games are really lacking. The thing that keeps me
going is XBL, and I find the replay value of some of my games still there
because of that (RSV[the newer maps in RSV are big and complex too], PD0 {I
am still addictied to its MP gaming] COD3 MP and the GRAWs MP).

If the PS3 had the games (have to be exclusives) and a decent price drop, I
am there. I will say this, had Sony (they fucked up here IMHO more than the
high price and lack of games) come out with their own version of an XBL type
format (as was touted falsely!), with at least the same quality, I would buy
it right now. XBL is just too fun, or I would have given up on my 360 after
GRAW2.

I will say this also; with Halo3 and Mass Effect (I am dying for that f'ing
game NOW!!!) coming around soon, as well as some other good ones, MS had
better hope this helps push around an addition 3 million units BEFORE the
Xmas season, or they'll be in trouble. I can't see them maintaining the
current console sales (even with H3 and MM coming about), and then expect
the newer model (still named Elite?) with the better, smaller, cooler
chipsets in them for $479, to sell as well.

&gt; So the leader in units sold and winner of the launch war are two different
&gt; things. Nintendo Wii won the launch war.
">

Just looking at pure numbers can be somewhat misleading. The Wii is
definitely the clear winner because it almost doubled the units sold
by either competitor at launch.

Microsoft sold less units from launch to year end than Sony did but
the more telling data is that Microsoft sold every single unit they
shipped during that period of time whereas Sony shipped, just in the
U.S., over 1 million units and sold less than 700,000 of them.

Throughout the spring following the Xbox 360's launch, gamers were
still trying to find systems to purchase whereas PS3s have been
collecting dust on shelves for pretty much this entire year.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The only problem with this assessment is that the PS3 actually doesn't
have a graphical advantage over the Xbox 360. The PS3 has a more
powerful processor but its graphics bandwidth is actually
bottlenecked... it technically cannot pump out better graphics than
the Xbox 360 because its graphical technology is inferior to that of
the 360.

Take note that there isn't a single game that exists on both the Xbox
360 and the Playstation 3 that looks even equal on both systems... the
360 versions are ALWAYS better-looking than the PS3 versions even
though the PS3 versions are ports that the developers had about 1 year
to work on.

The big question with gameplay right now is whether the innovative
feel of the Wii can be sustained for a long period of time. Right now,
the Wii is still riding on the buzz factor. I love the gameplay
features and I think the potential is awesome here, but it is a
legitimate concern that people may quickly lose patience in waiting
for games that truly take advantage of the system's technology.

I think Microsoft will keep the lead in the online sector for the
forseeable future. They just have way too much of a headstart there
that it's pretty much impossible for either competitor to catch up.

Microsoft has been developing this service over the past 7 years. Sony
just started a year or so ago, Nintendo as well. Nintendo still
doesn't even think online multiplayer against more than just your
personal real life buddies is important. Sony thinks that all people
want is a Second Life clone. Those two companies have a LONG way to go
to even get to where Xbox Live was when it first came out for the
original Xbox.

Yep... it will be a while before Nintendo feels any pressure to drop
their pricing. Even with their costs going down at a comparable rate
with the other two companies, they can still keep their price for as
long as the Wii sells like crack hotcakes and keep rolling in the
dough (since they've enjoyed good profits on each system from day 1
while Gates and Kutaragi were losing money hand over fist on their
systems).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What are the outlooks for the PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360 for 2007?

&gt; Right now, it's wide open-it's hard to tell. I think we could have two

For 2007, it's not very hard to tell at all. The Wii will continue to
dominate sales through this holiday season although sales for both
competitors will pick up dramatically during the holiday season
(probably more so for the PS3 since there are so many people who are
waiting for the PS3 to become &quot;worth it&quot; and the price drops and some
good games in the next few months will help that cause).

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; For THQ, I believe they did well because of releases for the Wii. They also
&gt; have a strong market share lead for the younger audience. THQ makes Cars and
&gt; WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007-they both did well, which is why they upped their
&gt; outlook.
">

Smackdown vs. RAW 2007 was not a title for the Wii.

Cars sold like a$$.

The reason they made out okay on the Wii was because development for
the Wii is MUCH easier and MUCH cheaper than development on the other
systems.

Release date is October 16 in North America... and within the

The big advantage of Microsoft here is that the 360 version will have
exclusive content for download on Live. Sony customers will not get
this episodic content anytime soon as it is exclusive to Xbox 360.

Sales of the Xbox 360 will go through the roof when that game comes
out...

&gt; &gt; Who's Winning the Console Wars

&gt; Owning all the consoles makes the question irrelevant. And there is no
&gt; &quot;winner&quot; just a sales leader. There's room for multiple consoles out there
&gt; &amp; if you base your buying decision PURELY on how many units are sold then
&gt; you're not very clever. Take the Wii for example, millions of units sold
&gt; yet the game offerings are lackluster, not to mention once you've played
&gt; with HD graphics the Wii looks very primitive.
">

You're right that looking purely at numbers is meaningless to an
extent but assuming that HD graphics are important to the majority of
the &quot;expanded&quot; consumer base is also pointless.

The overwhelming majority of Wii consumers are not hardcore gamers
that care about having HD graphics. They're dishing out $250 so they
can pretend to play baseball, box and bowl.

I own both the 360 and the Wii and I also care a lot about graphics,
but when I play the Wii, I have a completely different mindset. It
doesn't really bother me much that the graphics are only slightly
improved from the Game Cube. Do I wish that the graphics were better?
Sure. Does it really bother me? Not really.

Microsoft certainly could have handled things better but I don't think

about are games (which has become pretty obvious with the complete
meltdown of the once invulnerable Playstation brand). Just like the
PS3 has been floundering without enough great games, the Xbox 360 has
also been floundering as of late.

I don't think Sony will really have a chance to hold onto the ball
that Microsoft dropped in the first half because by the time their big
exclusives come out, new 360 exclusives will have already come out for
the 360.

BioShock hits in less than 2 months. GTA IV follows pretty soon after
that. Granted, GTA is on both platforms but I think if the average
consumer had to decide between getting a 360 with LOTS of great games
in the library to play GTA IV or getting a PS3 with maybe 1 or 2 great
games in the library to play GTA IV, they'll go with the proven
system.

Halo 3 soon after that. Mass Effect by year's end as well.

Sony has maybe 1 or 2 good exclusives coming out this year but their
really big guns aren't coming out until mid 2008. What they needed to
do was get more exclusives much earlier on, but the time for that has
already passed.

Sony still has a chance to recoup some of their lost fans but such
severe brand damage is often impossible to repair.

Well Mass Effect has been put off twice now, so I won't hold my breath for
the November release (they state November, but I remember the Halo 2
experience all too well from that point). GTA IV comes after Halo 3 (from
what I read anyway) as not to be in competition. Most Xbox-ers will buy Halo
well before they would GTA. GTA is supposed to come out 3 weeks after the H3
release.

Another game I really want and it is still a long way off is &quot;Alan Wake&quot; and
that has been put off more than a year,  and possibly 2 years beyond its
original &quot;purported&quot; release date.

That's just a few, and I don't know if you've played Ninja Gaiden Sigma

And if Sony gets their game and price situation happening, how do you think
Xbox fans, the way they have been treated to one of the worst hardware
releases for quality ever, will react? I've never owned anything Sony, not
because I don't like them, but the original Xbox sold me with good hardware,
better graphics and XBL. They didn't have the games, but the ones they did
were really good.

Now with the shit you see now with the 360 hardware issues, repairs (the
term &quot;repair&quot; being used loosely considering the many have had mulitple
repairs resulting in the same hardware crap after getting their boxes back
again and again), long return times and no major multiple good game releases
since really last November. What do you think now, isn't that severe brand
damage?

Consider since January, MS has sold just over a million units of the 360,
guess why. Sony has sold over 3 million PS3s since then, and that is with
way less games and terrible pricing. Now seeing the sales numbers the last
six months, what again, is severe brand damage? I would jump to a PS3 right
now, if they had a good online service, but it sucks the same as it did with
the PS2, and XBL is why I still love my 360 so much, otherwise, it wouldn't
have been turned on for a few months now.

I've been reading about stuff for all the systems on IGN's websites
but I haven't watched any videos... too busy (plus no speakers here at
work).

Which exclusive titles coming out this year do you think are really
good? The big guns (MGS and FF) are coming out in mid-to-late 2008.

Lair is coming out this year but I'm reading more and more posts about
it not being as impressive as people thought it would be from a
graphics *and* gameplay standpoint. I'm not sure if Haze is coming out
this year but that's not even one of the hotly anticipated titles.

I don't remember if Ratchet &amp; Clank is coming out this year...

What else are you interested in?

One good thing about BioWare is that they're willing to delay if it

Mass Effect comes out this year unless I hear otherwise.

If Halo 3 is coming out before GTA IV, isn't it logical to assume that
Xbox 360 owners will buy it before GTA IV? :-D

I don't agree that most 360ers will buy Halo 3 over GTA IV. GTA was
the main title on the competition that Xbox owners wanted back in the
day. GTA as a gaming franchise is as big as Halo, if not bigger. I
think it will do extremely well on both systems although I'm guessing
Halo will probably etch it out for game of the year.

SOCOM could be pretty good. I've never played any version of it (not
even the PSP one) but a few of my Sony fan friends loved it.

Ratchet &amp; Clank could be hit or miss. It's one of their mascot titles
that traditionally sells decently but isn't really a system seller on
its own. Of course, we didn't limit the discussion to system sellers
so I guess we can throw that one in there.

Heavenly Sword doesn't look half-bad but it's a genre title that might
not appeal to a broad audience.

I beat Ninja Gaiden on the Xbox and tried (but failed) to play the

If Sony starts pulling in a lot more exclusives, they'll start to turn
things around. I think the $100 &quot;price drop&quot; (see RMZ's analysis of
how this isn't REALLY a price drop) is a tiny first step but the
console is still way too expensive to justify the lack of games.

Sony needs to very quickly catch up to the library of the Xbox 360 in
order to start justifying its price. It's still $100 more than the
premium system (the Elite is a new SKU that's only now starting to
become accessible to most consumers so I'm trying to compare what most
people can buy). Granted, you get Blu-Ray but for a person who's
simply looking for a game system, it's a travesty to have to pay that
much more for that much less.

It's definitely damaging to the Xbox 360 brand but that brand wasn't
nearly as powerful as the Playstation brand. Both have fallen but Sony
has fallen MUCH further.

I do concede that a lot of consumers could still be worried with the
now national news of Microsoft's hardware issues, but I'm sure there
are plenty of people like me who have never personally dealt with a
return. I've never had a hardware failure and only 1 person I know
(not even personally, just an online friend I play with occasionally)
had to send their system back (albeit twice).

HOWEVER, the brand damage might have been curbed before it got way too
out of control. Their announcement of the 3 year warranty and repair
reimbursement is half-decent damage control... and news that the new
systems are using the smaller and more reliable chips can help assuage
a lot of concern.

On the other hand, Sony still doesn't have any good exclusives right
now. Games are coming soon but the big ones aren't coming for almost
another year. Once some of those exclusives are actually in stores,
Sony will be in a better place. However, their console is still too
expensive by almost everyone's standards.

By the holiday season, the question for consumers will be: Do you want
to spend $400 on a likely now stable console on which you can play
Halo 3, GTA IV, BioShock, possibly Mass Effect, plus all the good
games that came out before like Gears of War (droughts don't matter to
people who haven't yet bought the system) and the Xbox Live service
with tons of great games there... or do you want to spend $500 on a
console that allows you to play Blu-Ray movies as well as Lair,
Ratchet &amp; Clank, Heavenly Sword, and SOCOM?

Who knows?

Sony has only sold 1.4 million PS3s in North America since launch as
of July 7. Microsoft sold almost 1 million Xbox 360s in North America
in that same timeframe. Most of Sony's sales were to early adopters
and people looking for a cheap Blu-Ray player. All of Microsoft's
sales were to actual gamers.

If Sony suddenly pulled an equal online service out of their
collective butts, I still would buy the Xbox 360 if I didn't already
have one because the common Xbox 360 configuration is still $100
cheaper than the common PS3 configuration and the game library is
drastically larger, fuller and higher quality on the 360 side.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If MS had taken care of the garbage out units with better builds and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; released some better games, they may have hit their predicted 15
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; million
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sold by this past June, but we know the numbers now. I got a feeling
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; may bite them in the ass, only if Sony doesn't pick up the ball with
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; getting
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the great exclusives out.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Microsoft certainly could have handled things better but I don't think
&gt;&gt; &gt; that has been a significant factor. At this point, what people care
&gt;&gt; &gt; about are games (which has become pretty obvious with the complete
&gt;&gt; &gt; meltdown of the once invulnerable Playstation brand). Just like the
&gt;&gt; &gt; PS3 has been floundering without enough great games, the Xbox 360 has
&gt;&gt; &gt; also been floundering as of late.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't think Sony will really have a chance to hold onto the ball
&gt;&gt; &gt; that Microsoft dropped in the first half because by the time their big
&gt;&gt; &gt; exclusives come out, new 360 exclusives will have already come out for
&gt;&gt; &gt; the 360.

&gt;&gt; &gt; BioShock hits in less than 2 months. GTA IV follows pretty soon after
&gt;&gt; &gt; that. Granted, GTA is on both platforms but I think if the average
&gt;&gt; &gt; consumer had to decide between getting a 360 with LOTS of great games
&gt;&gt; &gt; in the library to play GTA IV or getting a PS3 with maybe 1 or 2 great
&gt;&gt; &gt; games in the library to play GTA IV, they'll go with the proven
&gt;&gt; &gt; system.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Halo 3 soon after that. Mass Effect by year's end as well.

&gt;&gt; Well Mass Effect has been put off twice now, so I won't hold my breath
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; the November release (they state November, but I remember the Halo 2
&gt;&gt; experience all too well from that point). GTA IV comes after Halo 3 (from
&gt;&gt; what I read anyway) as not to be in competition. Most Xbox-ers will buy
&gt;&gt; Halo
&gt;&gt; well before they would GTA. GTA is supposed to come out 3 weeks after the
&gt;&gt; H3
&gt;&gt; release.

&gt; One good thing about BioWare is that they're willing to delay if it
&gt; means they'll get out a higher quality product. I'm going to assume
&gt; Mass Effect comes out this year unless I hear otherwise.

&gt; If Halo 3 is coming out before GTA IV, isn't it logical to assume that
&gt; Xbox 360 owners will buy it before GTA IV? :-D

&gt; I don't agree that most 360ers will buy Halo 3 over GTA IV. GTA was
&gt; the main title on the competition that Xbox owners wanted back in the
&gt; day. GTA as a gaming franchise is as big as Halo, if not bigger. I
&gt; think it will do extremely well on both systems although I'm guessing
&gt; Halo will probably etch it out for game of the year.

&gt;&gt; Another game I really want and it is still a long way off is &quot;Alan Wake&quot;
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; that has been put off more than a year,  and possibly 2 years beyond its
&gt;&gt; original &quot;purported&quot; release date.

&gt; I heard very little about it except it's supposed to be pretty damn
&gt; good. It's too far in the future for me to worry about now, though.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Sony has maybe 1 or 2 good exclusives coming out this year but their
&gt;&gt; &gt; really big guns aren't coming out until mid 2008. What they needed to
&gt;&gt; &gt; do was get more exclusives much earlier on, but the time for that has
&gt;&gt; &gt; already passed.

&gt;&gt; Huh?

&gt;&gt; Lair
&gt;&gt; Heavenly Sword
&gt;&gt; Ratchet and Clank
&gt;&gt; SOCOM: Confrontation

&gt; Lair is one game I really wanted to play but after hearing
&gt; increasingly negative word about it, I'm not so sure anymore...

&gt; SOCOM could be pretty good. I've never played any version of it (not
&gt; even the PSP one) but a few of my Sony fan friends loved it.

&gt; Ratchet &amp; Clank could be hit or miss. It's one of their mascot titles
&gt; that traditionally sells decently but isn't really a system seller on
&gt; its own. Of course, we didn't limit the discussion to system sellers
&gt; so I guess we can throw that one in there.

&gt; Heavenly Sword doesn't look half-bad but it's a genre title that might
&gt; not appeal to a broad audience.

&gt;&gt; That's just a few, and I don't know if you've played Ninja Gaiden Sigma
&gt;&gt; (just came out last week), but that game looks totally awesome. My buddy
&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt; it, and it plays to the ratings it got on IGN and Gamespot; it is
&gt;&gt; freaking
&gt;&gt; awesome.

&gt; I beat Ninja Gaiden on the Xbox and tried (but failed) to play the
&gt; update on Xbox. I'm on the fence about considering this a major
&gt; exclusive because it's really just a twice upgraded port of a 3-year-
&gt; old Xbox game.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Sony still has a chance to recoup some of their lost fans but such
&gt;&gt; &gt; severe brand damage is often impossible to repair.

&gt;&gt; And if Sony gets their game and price situation happening, how do you
&gt;&gt; think
&gt;&gt; Xbox fans, the way they have been treated to one of the worst hardware
&gt;&gt; releases for quality ever, will react? I've never owned anything Sony,
&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt; because I don't like them, but the original Xbox sold me with good
&gt;&gt; hardware,
&gt;&gt; better graphics and XBL. They didn't have the games, but the ones they
&gt;&gt; did
&gt;&gt; were really good.

&gt; If Sony starts pulling in a lot more exclusives, they'll start to turn
&gt; things around. I think the $100 &quot;price drop&quot; (see RMZ's analysis of
&gt; how this isn't REALLY a price drop) is a tiny first step but the
&gt; console is still way too expensive to justify the lack of games.

&gt; Sony needs to very quickly catch up to the library of the Xbox 360 in
&gt; order to start justifying its price. It's still $100 more than the
&gt; premium system (the Elite is a new SKU that's only now starting to
&gt; become accessible to most consumers so I'm trying to compare what most
&gt; people can buy). Granted, you get Blu-Ray but for a person who's
&gt; simply looking for a game system, it's a travesty to have to pay that
&gt; much more for that much less.

&gt;&gt; Now with the shit you see now with the 360 hardware issues, repairs (the
&gt;&gt; term &quot;repair&quot; being used loosely considering the many have had mulitple
&gt;&gt; repairs resulting in the same hardware crap after getting their boxes
&gt;&gt; back
&gt;&gt; again and again), long return times and no major multiple good game
&gt;&gt; releases
&gt;&gt; since really last November. What do you think now, isn't that severe
&gt;&gt; brand
&gt;&gt; damage?

&gt; It's definitely damaging to the Xbox 360 brand but that brand wasn't
&gt; nearly as powerful as the Playstation brand. Both have fallen but Sony
&gt; has fallen MUCH further.

&gt; I do concede that a lot of consumers could still be worried with the
&gt; now national news of Microsoft's hardware issues, but I'm sure there
&gt; are plenty of people like me who have never personally dealt with a
&gt; return. I've never had a hardware failure and only 1 person I know
&gt; (not even personally, just an online friend I play with occasionally)
&gt; had to send their system back (albeit twice).

&gt; HOWEVER, the brand damage might have been curbed before it got way too
&gt; out of control. Their announcement of the 3 year warranty and repair
&gt; reimbursement is half-decent damage control... and news that the new
&gt; systems are using the smaller and more reliable chips can help assuage
&gt; a lot of concern.

&gt; On the other hand, Sony still doesn't have any good exclusives right
&gt; now. Games are coming soon but the big ones aren't coming for almost
&gt; another year. Once some of those exclusives are actually in stores,
&gt; Sony will be in a better place. However, their console is still too
&gt; expensive by almost everyone's standards.

&gt; By the holiday season, the question for consumers will be: Do you want
&gt; to spend $400 on a likely now stable console on which you can play
&gt; Halo 3, GTA IV, BioShock, possibly Mass Effect, plus all the good
&gt; games that came out before like Gears of War (droughts don't matter to
&gt; people who haven't yet bought the system) and the Xbox Live service
&gt; with tons of great games there... or do you want to spend $500 on a
&gt; console that allows you to play Blu-Ray movies as well as Lair,
&gt; Ratchet &amp; Clank, Heavenly Sword, and SOCOM?

&gt; Who knows?

&gt;&gt; Consider since January, MS has sold just over a million units of the 360,
&gt;&gt; guess why. Sony has sold over 3 million PS3s since then, and that is with
&gt;&gt; way less games and terrible pricing. Now seeing the sales numbers the
&gt;&gt; last
&gt;&gt; six months, what again, is severe brand damage? I would jump to a PS3
&gt;&gt; right
&gt;&gt; now, if they had a good online service, but it sucks the same as it did
&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt; the PS2, and XBL is why I still love my 360 so much, otherwise, it
&gt;&gt; wouldn't
&gt;&gt; have been turned on for a few months now.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; Sony has only sold 1.4 million PS3s in North America since launch as
&gt; of July 7. Microsoft sold almost 1 million Xbox 360s in North America
&gt; in that same timeframe. Most of Sony's sales were to early adopters
&gt; and people looking for a cheap Blu-Ray player. All of Microsoft's
&gt; sales were to actual gamers.
">

I agree with some of your points, they are well stated, but:

If you look at the numbers, MS stated at the end of 2006, they sold 10.4
million consoles by that time, as total since its 2005 release. Since then
(end of 2006) through June, they have sold 11.4 million. Think about it, in
14 months, 10.4 million, in the following 6, 1.4 million. Do the math, in
the first 14 months, the 360 averaged almost 750k in monthly sales. Since
the beginning of this year, they have averaged just over 230k; that's pretty
shitty, and most know why.

Sony has sold 2.5 million since the beginning of the year. Now those are not
great numbers, but almost double, considering the price and total lack of
games, and mediocre online gaming service, it makes one take pause. Also
consider that neither system has put out any great multitude of games since
the beginning of the year too.

No, the numbers above are worldwide sales, not just one region or continent.
Do the math, the PS3 has doubled the sales worldwide over the 360 since the
beginning of this year. When MS posted their 10.4 million number last Jan.
it was worldwide sales, so I thought as I posted the above, everyone would
know that what that was WW. Sorry if I didn't specify.

Yes, but the 360 has been equally weak, if not weaker, and add in my thought
about the hardware fiasco that has been going on since November of 2005,
(and that is totally unacceptable to allow to happen), and I think you see
the point.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't think Sony will really have a chance to hold onto the ball
&gt;&gt; &gt; that Microsoft dropped in the first half because by the time their big
&gt;&gt; &gt; exclusives come out, new 360 exclusives will have already come out for
&gt;&gt; &gt; the 360.

&gt;&gt; &gt; BioShock hits in less than 2 months. GTA IV follows pretty soon after
&gt;&gt; &gt; that. Granted, GTA is on both platforms but I think if the average
&gt;&gt; &gt; consumer had to decide between getting a 360 with LOTS of great games
&gt;&gt; &gt; in the library to play GTA IV or getting a PS3 with maybe 1 or 2 great
&gt;&gt; &gt; games in the library to play GTA IV, they'll go with the proven
&gt;&gt; &gt; system.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Halo 3 soon after that. Mass Effect by year's end as well.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Sony has maybe 1 or 2 good exclusives coming out this year

&gt;&gt; Did you watch &quot;any&quot; of the E3 coverage at all?
&gt;&gt; 1 or 2 good exclusives coming out you say?

&gt;&gt; &gt; but their
&gt;&gt; &gt; really big guns aren't coming out until mid 2008. What they needed to
&gt;&gt; &gt; do was get more exclusives much earlier on, but the time for that has
&gt;&gt; &gt; already passed.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; Which exclusive titles coming out this year do you think are really
&gt; good? The big guns (MGS and FF) are coming out in mid-to-late 2008.

&gt; Lair is coming out this year but I'm reading more and more posts about
&gt; it not being as impressive as people thought it would be from a
&gt; graphics *and* gameplay standpoint. I'm not sure if Haze is coming out
&gt; this year but that's not even one of the hotly anticipated titles.

I am interested in so many games for both the 360 (more so the 360 then PS3.
shhh don't tell jojo and Jonah. They wouldn't believe you or me anyway ;-))
PS3 I really don't even know where to begin.

Warhawk
Lair
Heavenly Sword
Hot Shots Golf 5
Rathet &amp; Clank: TOD
Uncharted: Drakes Fortune
Unreal Tournament 3
Socom
Haze
Infamous
Wipeout HD
Pain
Time Crisis 4
Tekken 6

Halo 3 (A-DUH!)
Too Human
Mass Effect
Halo 3 (joke I added it twice but I want to give it a go that much.  I
always get caught up in the Halo hype!)
PGR4
Bioshock

Most of the cross platform titles I will probably pick up on the 360 because
of LIVE
Call of Duty 4 (by far my most anticipated title this year!)
Need for Speed: Pro Street
Burnout Paradise
Turok
Sega Rally
GTA IV
devil may cry
Assassins
EA football pro and ncaa, basketball, hockey
2K8 football, basketball, hockey

Oh and 1 PC game: Gears of War.

When you consider that many of the PS3s sold were to people who just

The PS3 has failed to even keep up with the monthly sales the 360 is
seeing even at its highly reduced rate, resulting in the PS3/360 gap
widening every month.

Yes, Sony will hopefully be getting some good games in the coming months,
but it remains to be seen if they'll be any good or not, much less the
heavy-hitting system sellers that the PS3 so desparately needs at this
time.  The $100 drop helps a little but still leaves the PS3 as the most
expensive console out there even against the Elite.

When you say many wanted a cheap BR player, you have reliable polling

Doug, read my post, this concerns worldwide sales, not the numbers NPD puts
out every month that reflects NA sales. Worldwide, the PS3 has doubled what
the 360 sold since the beginning of the year. I am not interested in the PS3
for the reasons I have listed earlier, probably won't until a big price drop
and some exclusives that catch my eye (namely Warhawk, Ninja Gaiden Sigma
[which is already out] and especially MGS4). If the PS3 even had a XBL type
similar service with live enabled games like XBL, I would have bought it
right away probably, this was the primary reason why I didn't think of
getting it, and why I got the 360.  I am an online gaming junkie, and
haven't played PC online gaming since I got the 360, honestly.

XBL right now is the only reason I didn't put down my 360 4 months ago,
because the games have been shit since March and really nothing since after
last holiday season. Since the big releases of last November, I have bought
only one game, GRAW2.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yes, Sony will hopefully be getting some good games in the coming months,

I agree, it needs to be at least $200 dollar cheaper. But, with the garbage
that the 360 has been with hardware quality, and now a &quot;way too late
admittance&quot; by MS that it has problems and what they will do, I would bet
that some may be weary about getting the newer revision of the Eltie this
fall with the cooler, cheaper and smaller chipsets.

Can you imagine paying for a console that is only $20 cheaper than the price
dropped PS3 60g version, and the RROD happens again. I think MS sales have
tanked because of this bad news and the lack of games (I think evenly
between the two). Remember, MS stated 10.4 million 360s sold worldwide at
2006 end, but they only have a little over 11.4 million sold up until the
end of June now; they predicted 15 million would be sold by now, right after
their 10.4 mil sold benchmark claim; that's over a 72% drop in sales if they
wanted to go by their prediction. That said too, the PS3 has faired poorly
in sales since its release considering the name brand.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; getting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the great exclusives out.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Microsoft certainly could have handled things better but I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; that has been a significant factor. At this point, what people care
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; about are games (which has become pretty obvious with the complete
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; meltdown of the once invulnerable Playstation brand). Just like the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; PS3 has been floundering without enough great games, the Xbox 360 has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; also been floundering as of late.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't think Sony will really have a chance to hold onto the ball
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; that Microsoft dropped in the first half because by the time their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; big

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the 360.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; BioShock hits in less than 2 months. GTA IV follows pretty soon after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; that. Granted, GTA is on both platforms but I think if the average
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; consumer had to decide between getting a 360 with LOTS of great games
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; in the library to play GTA IV or getting a PS3 with maybe 1 or 2
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; great

I know but I put it in the PS3 list because they will have it first and
there is a good chance I'll get it on the PS3.
If it's good enough (the game in general) I will most likely pick it up on
the 360 so I can play with my friends that don't own a PS3.

COD4 is my pick for game of the year and E3.
It looks simply stunning (better then Killzone 2, Halo 3 and GOW) and
appears that the gameplay will equal the visuals.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Who's Winning the Console Wars

&gt;&gt; Owning all the consoles makes the question irrelevant. And there is no
&gt;&gt; &quot;winner&quot; just a sales leader. There's room for multiple consoles out there
&gt;&gt; &amp; if you base your buying decision PURELY on how many units are sold then
&gt;&gt; you're not very clever. Take the Wii for example, millions of units sold
&gt;&gt; yet the game offerings are lackluster, not to mention once you've played
&gt;&gt; with HD graphics the Wii looks very primitive.

&gt;That article is hardly objective, and rather subjective. So many
&gt;contingencies comparing the three consoles, it's easy to determine that you
&gt;can get any scenario on which is doing well (or not) at any given time. I
&gt;can say this; at the end of 2006, MS stated (and had been pretty much
&gt;confirmed) that it had sold 10.4 million 360s.

&gt;The Wii had 1.1 mil at that point, and it is a safe bet that the PS3 had at
&gt;least a million. But if you look at today's numbers, the Wii is pushing 9
&gt;million, the PS3 close to 4 million, and the 360 is around 11.5 million
&gt;(more or less). That said, the 360 has only sold around (more or less) 1
&gt;million units from January 07 through June 07. I think most can do the math
&gt;on what the other consoles did, the 360 is doing badly the past 6 months.

&gt;The Wii is selling because its novelty is still strong, but won't last more
&gt;than another year (my guess only). The PS3's price and total lack of games
&gt;is what is killing it. Now, the 360 has had mainly crappy games (except for
&gt;a few good ones) since the beginning of the year and the hradware issues are
&gt;finally coming to reality. It's hard to say what has slowed the 360 sales to
&gt;a crawl, but having a combination of crappy game releases (en mass) this
&gt;year with the hardware bullshit cover-up from MS, you can see why.
">

IMHO, i think the 360 is reaching critical mass. nearly anyone who was
interested in picking one up has already. This happened also with the original
Xbox. Microsoft probably cant find the 100 million buyers that Sony did with
its PS2.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; million
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sold by this past June, but we know the numbers now. I got a feeling
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; may bite them in the ass, only if Sony doesn't pick up the ball with
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; getting
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the great exclusives out.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Microsoft certainly could have handled things better but I don't think
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that has been a significant factor. At this point, what people care
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; about are games (which has become pretty obvious with the complete
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meltdown of the once invulnerable Playstation brand). Just like the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; PS3 has been floundering without enough great games, the Xbox 360 has
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; also been floundering as of late.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't think Sony will really have a chance to hold onto the ball
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that Microsoft dropped in the first half because by the time their big
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; exclusives come out, new 360 exclusives will have already come out for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the 360.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; BioShock hits in less than 2 months. GTA IV follows pretty soon after
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that. Granted, GTA is on both platforms but I think if the average
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; consumer had to decide between getting a 360 with LOTS of great games
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the library to play GTA IV or getting a PS3 with maybe 1 or 2 great
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; games in the library to play GTA IV, they'll go with the proven
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; system.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Halo 3 soon after that. Mass Effect by year's end as well.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sony has maybe 1 or 2 good exclusives coming out this year

&gt; &gt;&gt; Did you watch &quot;any&quot; of the E3 coverage at all?
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1 or 2 good exclusives coming out you say?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but their
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; really big guns aren't coming out until mid 2008. What they needed to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; do was get more exclusives much earlier on, but the time for that has
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; already passed.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; Which exclusive titles coming out this year do you think are really
&gt; &gt; good? The big guns (MGS and FF) are coming out in mid-to-late 2008.

&gt; &gt; Lair is coming out this year but I'm reading more and more posts about
&gt; &gt; it not being as impressive as people thought it would be from a
&gt; &gt; graphics *and* gameplay standpoint. I'm not sure if Haze is coming out
&gt; &gt; this year but that's not even one of the hotly anticipated titles.

&gt; &gt; I don't remember if Ratchet &amp; Clank is coming out this year...

&gt; &gt; What else are you interested in?

&gt; I am interested in so many games for both the 360 (more so the 360 then PS3.
&gt; shhh don't tell jojo and Jonah. They wouldn't believe you or me anyway ;-))
&gt; PS3 I really don't even know where to begin.

&gt; Warhawk
&gt; Lair
&gt; Heavenly Sword
&gt; Hot Shots Golf 5
&gt; Rathet &amp; Clank: TOD
&gt; Uncharted: Drakes Fortune
&gt; Unreal Tournament 3

Are all those games coming out this year?

&gt; &gt; Unreal Tournament 3 is not an exclusive.

&gt; I know but I put it in the PS3 list because they will have it first and
&gt; there is a good chance I'll get it on the PS3.
&gt; If it's good enough (the game in general) I will most likely pick it up on
&gt; the 360 so I can play with my friends that don't own a PS3.

&gt; &gt; As far as your list below, did you see the actual gameplay of COD4, looks
&gt; &gt; awesome and I am stoked for that game. Glad to see WWII is finally over
&gt; &gt; after nearly 70 years :-)

&gt; COD4 is my pick for game of the year and E3.
&gt; It looks simply stunning (better then Killzone 2, Halo 3 and GOW) and
&gt; appears that the gameplay will equal the visuals.
">

The question is whether it will be more epic than Halo 3 or GTA IV.
The gameplay looks great but it's still just a first-person shooter
when you boil it down. Graphics are important, but better graphics
doesn't equal game of the year...

I still think it will be a close race between Halo 3 and GTA IV.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; system.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Halo 3 soon after that. Mass Effect by year's end as well.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Well Mass Effect has been put off twice now, so I won't hold my breath
&gt; &gt;&gt; for
&gt; &gt;&gt; the November release (they state November, but I remember the Halo 2
&gt; &gt;&gt; experience all too well from that point). GTA IV comes after Halo 3 (from
&gt; &gt;&gt; what I read anyway) as not to be in competition. Most Xbox-ers will buy
&gt; &gt;&gt; Halo
&gt; &gt;&gt; well before they would GTA. GTA is supposed to come out 3 weeks after the
&gt; &gt;&gt; H3
&gt; &gt;&gt; release.

&gt; &gt; One good thing about BioWare is that they're willing to delay if it
&gt; &gt; means they'll get out a higher quality product. I'm going to assume
&gt; &gt; Mass Effect comes out this year unless I hear otherwise.

&gt; &gt; If Halo 3 is coming out before GTA IV, isn't it logical to assume that
&gt; &gt; Xbox 360 owners will buy it before GTA IV? :-D

&gt; &gt; I don't agree that most 360ers will buy Halo 3 over GTA IV. GTA was
&gt; &gt; the main title on the competition that Xbox owners wanted back in the
&gt; &gt; day. GTA as a gaming franchise is as big as Halo, if not bigger. I
&gt; &gt; think it will do extremely well on both systems although I'm guessing
&gt; &gt; Halo will probably etch it out for game of the year.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Another game I really want and it is still a long way off is &quot;Alan Wake&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; that has been put off more than a year,  and possibly 2 years beyond its
&gt; &gt;&gt; original &quot;purported&quot; release date.

&gt; &gt; I heard very little about it except it's supposed to be pretty damn
&gt; &gt; good. It's too far in the future for me to worry about now, though.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sony has maybe 1 or 2 good exclusives coming out this year but their
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; really big guns aren't coming out until mid 2008. What they needed to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; do was get more exclusives much earlier on, but the time for that has
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; already passed.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Huh?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Lair
&gt; &gt;&gt; Heavenly Sword
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ratchet and Clank
&gt; &gt;&gt; SOCOM: Confrontation

&gt; &gt; Lair is one game I really wanted to play but after hearing
&gt; &gt; increasingly negative word about it, I'm not so sure anymore...

&gt; &gt; SOCOM could be pretty good. I've never played any version of it (not
&gt; &gt; even the PSP one) but a few of my Sony fan friends loved it.

&gt; &gt; Ratchet &amp; Clank could be hit or miss. It's one of their mascot titles
&gt; &gt; that traditionally sells decently but isn't really a system seller on
&gt; &gt; its own. Of course, we didn't limit the discussion to system sellers
&gt; &gt; so I guess we can throw that one in there.

&gt; &gt; Heavenly Sword doesn't look half-bad but it's a genre title that might
&gt; &gt; not appeal to a broad audience.

&gt; &gt;&gt; That's just a few, and I don't know if you've played Ninja Gaiden Sigma
&gt; &gt;&gt; (just came out last week), but that game looks totally awesome. My buddy
&gt; &gt;&gt; has
&gt; &gt;&gt; it, and it plays to the ratings it got on IGN and Gamespot; it is
&gt; &gt;&gt; freaking
&gt; &gt;&gt; awesome.

&gt; &gt; I beat Ninja Gaiden on the Xbox and tried (but failed) to play the
&gt; &gt; update on Xbox. I'm on the fence about considering this a major
&gt; &gt; exclusive because it's really just a twice upgraded port of a 3-year-
&gt; &gt; old Xbox game.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sony still has a chance to recoup some of their lost fans but such
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; severe brand damage is often impossible to repair.

&gt; &gt;&gt; And if Sony gets their game and price situation happening, how do you
&gt; &gt;&gt; think
&gt; &gt;&gt; Xbox fans, the way they have been treated to one of the worst hardware
&gt; &gt;&gt; releases for quality ever, will react? I've never owned anything Sony,
&gt; &gt;&gt; not
&gt; &gt;&gt; because I don't like them, but the original Xbox sold me with good
&gt; &gt;&gt; hardware,
&gt; &gt;&gt; better graphics and XBL. They didn't have the games, but the ones they
&gt; &gt;&gt; did
&gt; &gt;&gt; were really good.

&gt; &gt; If Sony starts pulling in a lot more exclusives, they'll start to turn
&gt; &gt; things around. I think the $100 &quot;price drop&quot; (see RMZ's analysis of
&gt; &gt; how this isn't REALLY a price drop) is a tiny first step but the
&gt; &gt; console is still way too expensive to justify the lack of games.

&gt; &gt; Sony needs to very quickly catch up to the library of the Xbox 360 in
&gt; &gt; order to start justifying its price. It's still $100 more than the
&gt; &gt; premium system (the Elite is a new SKU that's only now starting to
&gt; &gt; become accessible to most consumers so I'm trying to compare what most
&gt; &gt; people can buy). Granted, you get Blu-Ray but for a person who's
&gt; &gt; simply looking for a game system, it's a travesty to have to pay that
&gt; &gt; much more for that much less.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Now with the shit you see now with the 360 hardware issues, repairs (the
&gt; &gt;&gt; term &quot;repair&quot; being used loosely considering the many have had mulitple
&gt; &gt;&gt; repairs resulting in the same hardware crap after getting their boxes
&gt; &gt;&gt; back
&gt; &gt;&gt; again and again), long return times and no major multiple good game
&gt; &gt;&gt; releases
&gt; &gt;&gt; since really last November. What do you think now, isn't that severe
&gt; &gt;&gt; brand
&gt; &gt;&gt; damage?

&gt; &gt; It's definitely damaging to the Xbox 360 brand but that brand wasn't
&gt; &gt; nearly as powerful as the Playstation brand. Both have fallen but Sony
&gt; &gt; has fallen MUCH further.

&gt; &gt; I do concede that a lot of consumers could still be worried with the
&gt; &gt; now national news of Microsoft's hardware issues, but I'm sure there
&gt; &gt; are plenty of people like me who have never personally dealt with a
&gt; &gt; return. I've never had a hardware failure and only 1 person I know
&gt; &gt; (not even personally, just an online friend I play with occasionally)
&gt; &gt; had to send their system back (albeit twice).

&gt; &gt; HOWEVER, the brand damage might have been curbed before it got way too
&gt; &gt; out of control. Their announcement of the 3 year warranty and repair
&gt; &gt; reimbursement is half-decent damage control... and news that the new
&gt; &gt; systems are using the smaller and more reliable chips can help assuage
&gt; &gt; a lot of concern.

&gt; &gt; On the other hand, Sony still doesn't have any good exclusives right
&gt; &gt; now. Games are coming soon but the big ones aren't coming for almost
&gt; &gt; another year. Once some of those exclusives are actually in stores,
&gt; &gt; Sony will be in a better place. However, their console is still too
&gt; &gt; expensive by almost everyone's standards.

&gt; &gt; By the holiday season, the question for consumers will be: Do you want
&gt; &gt; to spend $400 on a likely now stable console on which you can play
&gt; &gt; Halo 3, GTA IV, BioShock, possibly Mass Effect, plus all the good
&gt; &gt; games that came out before like Gears of War (droughts don't matter to
&gt; &gt; people who haven't yet bought the system) and the Xbox Live service
&gt; &gt; with tons of great games there... or do you want to spend $500 on a
&gt; &gt; console that allows you to play Blu-Ray movies as well as Lair,
&gt; &gt; Ratchet &amp; Clank, Heavenly Sword, and SOCOM?

&gt; &gt; Who knows?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Consider since January, MS has sold just over a million units of the 360,
&gt; &gt;&gt; guess why. Sony has sold over 3 million PS3s since then, and that is with
&gt; &gt;&gt; way less games and terrible pricing. Now seeing the sales numbers the
&gt; &gt;&gt; last
&gt; &gt;&gt; six months, what again, is severe brand damage? I would jump to a PS3
&gt; &gt;&gt; right
&gt; &gt;&gt; now, if they had a good online service, but it sucks the same as it did
&gt; &gt;&gt; with
&gt; &gt;&gt; the PS2, and XBL is why I still love my 360 so much, otherwise, it
&gt; &gt;&gt; wouldn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; have been turned on for a few months now.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; Sony has only sold 1.4 million PS3s in North America since launch as
&gt; &gt; of July 7. Microsoft sold almost 1 million Xbox 360s in North America
&gt; &gt; in that same timeframe. Most of Sony's sales were to early adopters
&gt; &gt; and people looking for a cheap Blu-Ray player. All of Microsoft's
&gt; &gt; sales were to actual gamers.

&gt; I agree with some of your points, they are well stated, but:

&gt; If you look at the numbers, MS stated at the end of 2006, they sold 10.4
&gt; million consoles by that time, as total since its 2005 release. Since then
&gt; (end of 2006) through June, they have sold 11.4 million. Think about it, in
&gt; 14 months, 10.4 million, in the following 6, 1.4 million. Do the math, in
&gt; the first 14 months, the 360 averaged almost 750k in monthly sales. Since
&gt; the beginning of this year, they have averaged just over 230k; that's pretty
&gt; shitty, and most know why.

&gt; Sony has sold 2.5 million since the

&gt; &gt;&gt; great numbers, but almost double, considering the price and total lack of
&gt; &gt;&gt; games, and mediocre online gaming service, it makes one take pause. Also
&gt; &gt;&gt; consider that neither system has put out any great multitude of games
&gt; &gt;&gt; since
&gt; &gt;&gt; the beginning of the year too.

&gt; &gt; When you consider that many of the PS3s sold were to people who just
&gt; &gt; wanted a cheap blu-ray player and have no intentions of playings games on
&gt; &gt; it, ever, that number looks even worse.

&gt; When you say many wanted a cheap BR player, you have reliable polling
&gt; results that reflect that; saying &quot;many&quot; ( which seems indicative of a
&gt; majority) is a stretch to be honest.

&gt; &gt; The PS3 has failed to even keep up with the monthly sales the 360 is
&gt; &gt; seeing even at its highly reduced rate, resulting in the PS3/360 gap
&gt; &gt; widening every month.

&gt; Doug, read my post, this concerns worldwide sales, not the numbers NPD puts
&gt; out every month that reflects NA sales. Worldwide, the PS3 has doubled what
&gt; the 360 sold since the beginning of the year.
">

Sony definitely benefited from strong launch support in Europe. They
also have an advantage in worldwide sales with Japan since nobody
expects the Xbox 360 to ever really take off there.

I think North American sales are much more telling than worldwide
sales since the North American market is hands down by far the biggest
one for the video game industry.

I don't think you can discount the European and Japanese markets
entirely but those two combined are still not equal to the North
American market.

In any case, one would normally expect the PS3 to be doing
phenomenally better than the Xbox 360 in terms of sales this year
because it's a brand new system. Granted, it's still selling decently
despite its issues but it's trailing the 360 in terms of sales at
equal points in their lives.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I am not interested in the PS3
&gt; for the reasons I have listed earlier, probably won't until a big price drop
&gt; and some exclusives that catch my eye (namely Warhawk, Ninja Gaiden Sigma
&gt; [which is already out] and especially MGS4). If the PS3 even had a XBL type
&gt; similar service with live enabled games like XBL, I would have bought it
&gt; right away probably, this was the primary reason why I didn't think of
&gt; getting it, and why I got the 360.  I am an online gaming junkie, and
&gt; haven't played PC online gaming since I got the 360, honestly.

&gt; XBL right now is the only reason I didn't put down my 360 4 months ago,
&gt; because the games have been shit since March and really nothing since after
&gt; last holiday season. Since the big releases of last November, I have bought
&gt; only one game, GRAW2.

I won't argue with you on that. I think my only purchases this year
have been GRAW 2, Guitar Hero II and Crackdown.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Yes, Sony will hopefully be getting some good games in the coming months,
&gt; &gt; but it remains to be seen if they'll be any good or not, much less the
&gt; &gt; heavy-hitting system sellers that the PS3 so desparately needs at this
&gt; &gt; time.  The $100 drop helps a little but still leaves the PS3 as the most
&gt; &gt; expensive console out there even against the Elite.

&gt; I agree, it needs to be at least $200 dollar cheaper. But, with the garbage
&gt; that the 360 has been with hardware quality, and now a &quot;way too late
&gt; admittance&quot; by MS that it has problems and what they will do, I would bet
&gt; that some may be weary about getting the newer revision of the Eltie this
&gt; fall with the cooler, cheaper and smaller chipsets.
">

Fall isn't as important as November and December. I think once that
Elite has been out a couple of months and Microsoft releases reports
on (hopefully) how few repairs have to be made, people will be willing
to go for it, especially with games like Halo 3, GTA IV and BioShock
available.

&gt; Can you imagine paying for a console that is only $20 cheaper than the price

&gt; tanked because of this bad news and the lack of games (I think evenly
&gt; between the two). Remember, MS stated 10.4 million 360s sold worldwide at
&gt; 2006 end, but they only have a little over 11.4 million sold up until the
&gt; end of June now; they predicted 15 million would be sold by now, right after
&gt; their 10.4 mil sold benchmark claim; that's over a 72% drop in sales if they
&gt; wanted to go by their prediction. That said too, the PS3 has faired poorly

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If MS had taken care of the garbage out units with better builds and

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; million
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sold by this past June, but we know the numbers now. I got a feeling
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; may bite them in the ass, only if Sony doesn't pick up the ball with
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; getting
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the great exclusives out.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Microsoft certainly could have handled things better but I don't think
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that has been a significant factor. At this point, what people care
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; about are games (which has become pretty obvious with the complete
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meltdown of the once invulnerable Playstation brand). Just like the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; PS3 has been floundering without enough great games, the Xbox 360 has
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; also been floundering as of late.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't think Sony will really have a chance to hold onto the ball
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that Microsoft dropped in the first half because by the time their big
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; exclusives come out, new 360 exclusives will have already come out for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the 360.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; BioShock hits in less than 2 months. GTA IV follows pretty soon after
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that. Granted, GTA is on both platforms but I think if the average
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; consumer had to decide between getting a 360 with LOTS of great games
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the library to play GTA IV or getting a PS3 with maybe 1 or 2 great
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; games in the library to play GTA IV, they'll go with the proven
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; system.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Halo 3 soon after that. Mass Effect by year's end as well.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Well Mass Effect has been put off twice now, so I won't hold my breath
&gt; &gt;&gt; for
&gt; &gt;&gt; the November release (they state November, but I remember the Halo 2
&gt; &gt;&gt; experience all too well from that point). GTA IV comes after Halo 3 (from
&gt; &gt;&gt; what I read anyway) as not to be in competition. Most Xbox-ers will buy
&gt; &gt;&gt; Halo
&gt; &gt;&gt; well before they would GTA. GTA is supposed to come out 3 weeks after the
&gt; &gt;&gt; H3
&gt; &gt;&gt; release.

&gt; &gt; One good thing about BioWare is that they're willing to delay if it
&gt; &gt; means they'll get out a higher quality product. I'm going to assume
&gt; &gt; Mass Effect comes out this year unless I hear otherwise.

&gt; &gt; If Halo 3 is coming out before GTA IV, isn't it logical to assume that
&gt; &gt; Xbox 360 owners will buy it before GTA IV? :-D

&gt; &gt; I don't agree that most 360ers will buy Halo 3 over GTA IV. GTA was
&gt; &gt; the main title on the competition that Xbox owners wanted back in the
&gt; &gt; day. GTA as a gaming franchise is as big as Halo, if not bigger. I
&gt; &gt; think it will do extremely well on both systems although I'm guessing
&gt; &gt; Halo will probably etch it out for game of the year.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Another game I really want and it is still a long way off is &quot;Alan Wake&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; that has been put off more than a year,  and possibly 2 years beyond its
&gt; &gt;&gt; original &quot;purported&quot; release date.

&gt; &gt; I heard very little about it except it's supposed to be pretty damn
&gt; &gt; good. It's too far in the future for me to worry about now, though.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sony has maybe 1 or 2 good exclusives coming out this year but their
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; really big guns aren't coming out until mid 2008. What they needed to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; do was get more exclusives much earlier on, but the time for that has
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; already passed.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Huh?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Lair
&gt; &gt;&gt; Heavenly Sword
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ratchet and Clank
&gt; &gt;&gt; SOCOM: Confrontation

&gt; &gt; Lair is one game I really wanted to play but after hearing
&gt; &gt; increasingly negative word about it, I'm not so sure anymore...

&gt; Well I'd like to hear your sources because everything I have heard has that
&gt; as the IT game for the not to distant future PS3 realeases.  Its release
&gt; will probably be the day I pick one up.  I am going to have to DJ a couple
&gt; of extra weddings but so be it.- Hide quoted text -

I've read some posts on either alt.games.video.xbox or the PS sister
group of people stating that the visuals aren't as impressive as they
thought they would be, which surprised me because I saw the running
demo on the PS3 and it looked pretty good to me.

The latest issue of EGM (or maybe the previous one) states that the
visuals are not as good as they were expected to be.

I can try to dig up the other negative blurbs I read.

Everything I've read has shown Unreal Tournament 3 to be the &quot;it&quot; game
of the end of the year for the PS3.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; yet the game offerings are lackluster, not to mention once you've
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; played
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with HD graphics the Wii looks very primitive.

&gt; &gt;&gt; That article is hardly objective, and rather subjective. So many
&gt; &gt;&gt; contingencies comparing the three consoles, it's easy to determine that
&gt; &gt;&gt; you
&gt; &gt;&gt; can get any scenario on which is doing well (or not) at any given time. I
&gt; &gt;&gt; can say this; at the end of 2006, MS stated (and had been pretty much
&gt; &gt;&gt; confirmed) that it had sold 10.4 million 360s.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Wii had 1.1 mil at that point, and it is a safe bet that the PS3 had
&gt; &gt;&gt; at
&gt; &gt;&gt; least a million. But if you look at today's numbers, the Wii is pushing 9
&gt; &gt;&gt; million, the PS3 close to 4 million, and the 360 is around 11.5 million
&gt; &gt;&gt; (more or less). That said, the 360 has only sold around (more or less) 1
&gt; &gt;&gt; million units from January 07 through June 07. I think most can do the
&gt; &gt;&gt; math
&gt; &gt;&gt; on what the other consoles did, the 360 is doing badly the past 6 months.

&gt; &gt; The 360 has been outselling the PS3 month after month in 2007.  If the
&gt; &gt; 360 is doing badly, what do you consider the PS3 doing?  Do you have
&gt; &gt; sales figures for Europe?

&gt; No, the numbers above are worldwide sales, not just one region or continent.
&gt; Do the math, the PS3 has doubled the sales worldwide over the 360 since the
&gt; beginning of this year. When MS posted their 10.4 million number last Jan.
&gt; it was worldwide sales, so I thought as I posted the above, everyone would
&gt; know that what that was WW. Sorry if I didn't specify.

&gt; &gt;&gt; If MS had taken care of the garbage out units with better builds and
&gt; &gt;&gt; released some better games, they may have hit their predicted 15 million
&gt; &gt;&gt; sold by this past June, but we know the numbers now. I got a feeling this
&gt; &gt;&gt; may bite them in the ass, only if Sony doesn't pick up the ball with

&gt; &gt; Better builds are one issue, but Sony has been weak on the release
&gt; &gt; front also.

&gt; Yes, but the 360 has been equally weak, if not weaker, and add in my thought
&gt; about the hardware fiasco that has been going on since November of 2005,
&gt; (and that is totally unacceptable to allow to happen), and I think you see
&gt; the point.- Hide quoted text -

It has indeed if you only count this year. However, for a new consumer
trying to choose between the 2 systems, the releases for the Xbox 360
are MUCH stronger than the releases for the PS3... a new consumer
doesn't care WHEN the games were released, just that they're sitting
on the shelves available for them to purchase then and there.

&gt; &gt;is what is killing it. Now, the 360 has had mainly crappy games (except for
&gt; &gt;a few good ones) since the beginning of the year and the hradware issues are
&gt; &gt;finally coming to reality. It's hard to say what has slowed the 360 sales to
&gt; &gt;a crawl, but having a combination of crappy game releases (en mass) this
&gt; &gt;year with the hardware bullshit cover-up from MS, you can see why.

&gt; IMHO, i think the 360 is reaching critical mass. nearly anyone who was
&gt; interested in picking one up has already. This happened also with the original
&gt; Xbox. Microsoft probably cant find the 100 million buyers that Sony did with
&gt; its PS2.
">

Doubtful. The gaming industry is as strong as ever from a sales
standpoint and it's highly unlikely that the PS3 will suddenly draw in
millions and millions of gamers while the 360 flounders...

This holiday season will be a big one for all involved and I think the
360 releases are stronger. You can't compare a game like Heavenly
Sword to Halo 3 as far as universal appeal goes.

There are TONS of people out there who own neither the Xbox 360 nor
the PS3 and I don't think any reasonable person can say that most of
those people won't be interested in getting into Halo 3 and the like.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you're not very clever. Take the Wii for example, millions of units
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sold
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; yet the game offerings are lackluster, not to mention once you've
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; played
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with HD graphics the Wii looks very primitive.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That article is hardly objective, and rather subjective. So many
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; contingencies comparing the three consoles, it's easy to determine
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; can get any scenario on which is doing well (or not) at any given
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time. I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; can say this; at the end of 2006, MS stated (and had been pretty much
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; confirmed) that it had sold 10.4 million 360s.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The Wii had 1.1 mil at that point, and it is a safe bet that the PS3
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; had
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; least a million. But if you look at today's numbers, the Wii is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pushing 9
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; million, the PS3 close to 4 million, and the 360 is around 11.5
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; million
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (more or less). That said, the 360 has only sold around (more or less)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 1
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; million units from January 07 through June 07. I think most can do the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; math
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; on what the other consoles did, the 360 is doing badly the past 6
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; months.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The 360 has been outselling the PS3 month after month in 2007.  If the
&gt;&gt; &gt; 360 is doing badly, what do you consider the PS3 doing?  Do you have
&gt;&gt; &gt; sales figures for Europe?

&gt;&gt; No, the numbers above are worldwide sales, not just one region or
&gt;&gt; continent.
&gt;&gt; Do the math, the PS3 has doubled the sales worldwide over the 360 since
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; beginning of this year. When MS posted their 10.4 million number last
&gt;&gt; Jan.
&gt;&gt; it was worldwide sales, so I thought as I posted the above, everyone
&gt;&gt; would
&gt;&gt; know that what that was WW. Sorry if I didn't specify.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If MS had taken care of the garbage out units with better builds and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; released some better games, they may have hit their predicted 15
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; million
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sold by this past June, but we know the numbers now. I got a feeling
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; may bite them in the ass, only if Sony doesn't pick up the ball with
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; getting
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the great exclusives out.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Better builds are one issue, but Sony has been weak on the release
&gt;&gt; &gt; front also.

&gt;&gt; Yes, but the 360 has been equally weak, if not weaker, and add in my
&gt;&gt; thought
&gt;&gt; about the hardware fiasco that has been going on since November of 2005,
&gt;&gt; (and that is totally unacceptable to allow to happen), and I think you
&gt;&gt; see
&gt;&gt; the point.- Hide quoted text -

&gt;&gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; It has indeed if you only count this year. However, for a new consumer
&gt; trying to choose between the 2 systems, the releases for the Xbox 360
&gt; are MUCH stronger than the releases for the PS3... a new consumer
&gt; doesn't care WHEN the games were released, just that they're sitting
&gt; on the shelves available for them to purchase then and there.
">

Then consider that the 360, having all those games already released, and yet
they only sell just more than a million since January, while the PS3 has
sold over 2.5 million in the same time frame worldwide (for both consoles).
I think the hardware bug is well known now, and that may have squelched
sales.

There were plenty of things contributing to the slower sales of the
Xbox 360 this year but all of that will be inconsequential in a few
months when the retail shelves explode with new software.

Why even buy a 'hardcore' gaming system when I can use that money to
upgrade my PC to do a million other things and still look better then
any console? Why buy one when the controls are far less efficient then
a keyboard and mouse? Why buy one when I am totally screwed when a
small piece of it breaks and support is horrible?

The only reason I even bought a console (Wii of course) was to have
another thing to do when friends come over, it is the only console
that has things mine and my friend's PC's don't, thus making it novel
and appealing. Is playing Wii sports nearly as fun as the mass carnage
of Supreme Commander? Or is exploring a dungeon in Twilight Princess
half as fun as getting server first kills in Blackwing Lair and Ahn'
Qiraj? Is shooting people in Red Steel as fun as having my minions
kill peasants in Overlord?

Hell NO. But it's different. A welcome break that I sometimes need,
and a moderately acceptable way to get some cardio.

You are here why?
Yah know there are plenty of PC and Wii groups out there for yah to share
your love of gaming on those particular systems.  Most people purchase
&quot;hardcore gaming systems&quot; because of cost, friends not having those deeps
pockets, headset communication with friends and people you meet online, or
having to constantly stay on the cutting edge or updating specs to play new
games or squeeze extra performance out of current titles, constantly
tweaking the hardware to play the software, fixing problems, viruses,
compatibility issues, another words PC's are nothing but headache and
expense.

Hardcore gaming consoles (as you call them) are plug and play friendly at a
fraction of the cost of a good gaming PC.
A-FREAKING-DUH!

And please don't start debating what I said because I was a hardcore PC
gamer for years and I was always on the cutting edge while I was into it. PC
gaming isn't as relaxing and trouble free and console gaming. And although
you can hook up a gaming PC to a widescreen and sound system,  I found that
also wasn't practical for me.  I moved my old gaming PC out of my theater a
year ago and I will never have another replace it.  If I ever go back to PC
gaming it will be as an alternative to console gaming.

Pathetic argument. A PC equal to a PS3 or 360 runs for about $1000
starting from nothing. Upgrading you're current PC would probably be
more like $400-$500 dollars if you have a decent motherboard, as in
one that isn't three years old.

I guess I can't blame you for not knowing the numbers... Sony and
Microsoft obviously didn't pay attention to them.

Nice try with the 'why are you here', but it falls to shreds when I
point out this this is a merely a group about Xbox's (pro or con not
being dictated) and a thread about console wars. Get as unnecessarily
defensive as you want, but do a little research next time.

It all depends on the types of games that you want to play. There are
plenty of games that you just can't play on the computer because
nobody makes them for the computer.

If you want to play the newest Halo game, for instance, you have to
buy an Xbox 360 or you have to wait until they port it to the PC which
can take years (and the quality of the port sucks).

The PC gaming industry was never even close to as strong the console
gaming industry. You can pose such questions from your own personal
viewpoint but I'm talking from a general mass consumer viewpoint.

$1000 as compared to $400 for an Xbox 360...

The argument that the PC can do &quot;a million other things&quot; doesn't
really hold water in this discussion because we're talking about a

Funny, you 360 geeks seem to go crazy over spending the additional
money to get a 'better gaming system' when it gets compared to the
Wii. Why not spend the extra money for the convenience of being able
to upgrade and take warranties into your own hands? It's called

Building spreadsheets and surfing the web? You have got to be kidding
me. I'm talking about the ability to make MODs for games if you want
to (ever heard of Counter Strike?) or totally overhaul a game and make
a different one with the same code structure (Alien Swarm from
UT2004). Games that come out for PC's have map editors, scenario

Dude, you either plug in more RAM or a new video card. In the case of
the latter, you then put in a CD that completely walks you through
installing drivers. Difficult maybe for a monkey. Compatibility could
be a problem but that's why you do a little research and make sure
before you buy, hell you don't even have to research, just ask the
place you buy it from.

Notice how I only named two companies that didn't pay attention? I'll
reiterate. The Wii is currently and will continue to make more money
then any of the other systems. As a matter of fact, it is the only
system to have even made money thus far, being cheap to make and easy
to play. At this point, winning a console war has nothing to do with
being the most popular, (even though the Wii is) it is about making
money.

gaming industry. You can pose such questions from your own personal
viewpoint but I'm talking from a general mass consumer viewpoint. &quot;
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

I left this for last. You have got to be the biggest idiot in the
world if you honestly think that. Have you been living in a cave? Tell
me one console game that has over 50,000 games of it being played
right now, with 25+ players in each game? Connect to steam, search for
Counterstrike, filter as necessary. Tell me a console game that has a
million people paying $14.99 a month to play it. Ever hear of World of
Warcraft? There are hundreds of other MMO's with hundreds of thousands
of players all paying. Oh no! PC users can't play shitty Halo 2!?
Heaven forbid! We are stuck with the ability to play strategy games
instead. Halo 2 is actually being ported right now anyways, so the
three fanboi's who wanted it will be happy. I love how you throw in
'general mass consumer viewpoint' as though you actually believe most
people think as you do.

I'll say it again again (no typo, again is in there twice) Sony and
Microsoft failed to realize a large portion of the market is so
fascinated with PC gaming that they would never in a thousand years
buy a system that would cost them as much as a PC upgrade and give
them less then an upgrade would. Hell, most people are content NOT
upgrading and just playing CS and Starcraft (Korea) and saving the
money. People like us do, however, buy novelty, and the numbers show
it.

You are an idiot plain and simple.
A PC that will run games like Crysis at an acceptable rate will cost quite a
bit more then $1000.  A freaking Geforce 8800 Ultra 768 alone runs 725 to
800 +tx +shipping.  This card is a waste of money without 2 gigs of ram and
a newer motherboard.  Not some freaking 2 or 3 year old board.  I would love
to see your 3D mark 06 scores with an older mother board with some beefed up
ram and a decent video card.

Don't come on here rambling like an idiot about the ease of use of PC's with
gaming and trying to compare it to consoles.  You're making a complete ass
out of yourself and wasting our time. I wish I knew you presonally because I
would love to see you run the newer games with DX10 and Vista and watch you
only spend a couple hundred bucks to make it all happen.  You're full of
shit.  PC gaming is nothing but a headache with each passing year, newer DX,
newer video drivers, sound compatibility and oh yeah, how's that voice chat
with every game out there on the PC?

My son is a PC gamer and I just got done throwing a PC together for him. I
spent $1200 dollars and I knew going in I was going to have to shell out for
a high end video card when it comes out.

I love to see a 2 or 3 year old motherboard with old ass memory (regardless
of the amount) go against a 2.9g\Ghz (quad Core) Asus Extreme Striker or
even a Asus Crosshair nForce 590 SLI MCP Chipset using a AMD Athlon 64 X2
6000+ dual core cpu.  Stop talking out your ass comparing PC gaming vs
console gaming.

A gaming console last 5 years with developers pushing the hardware a little
further each year. With a PC you either constantly upgrade or try to be
satisfied with tired hardware trying to run the latest and greatest.  Sure
most PC games don't require constant upgrades but they are usually not the
games most PC gamers want to play. The UT series being one of the only
exceptions.

&gt; You are an idiot plain and simple.
&gt; A PC that will run games like Crysis at an acceptable rate will cost quite a
&gt; bit more then $1000.  A freaking Geforce 8800 Ultra 768 alone runs 725 to
&gt; 800 +tx +shipping.  This card is a waste of money without 2 gigs of ram and
&gt; a newer motherboard.  Not some freaking 2 or 3 year old board.  I would love
&gt; to see your 3D mark 06 scores with an older mother board with some beefed up
&gt; ram and a decent video card.

Reading comprehension &gt; you. I said as long as you DIDN'T have a three
year old motherboard it would be fine. I say that because Socket A/1
boards, PCI-E slots and DDR ram became mainstream back then, and are
still in use today. Other than that, a motherboard doesn't really have
much to do with speeds.

CRYSIS? Are you kidding me? First off you are talking about a game
that has yet to have a release date, pretty much in pre-alpha right
now. 7950's used to be $800 too, then a few years went by and you can
get them for $200, and a 7950 will handle Crysis, not well but it can.
Secondly, you are talking about a PC only game that will be a million
times more graphically appealing and hardware intensive then any
console game out there, and more then any console will be able to
handle for many years to come. If I ever decide to buy the game, I
will upgrade my video card to the current market $200-$300 range card
and possibly throw in a PCI physics card to handle the zero-g. Only a
moron buys bleeding edge technology, it depreciates in value so fast
it's not even funny.

I always run the latest 3DMark tests, and usually end up in the high
middle with about 8500 marks. Maybe someday I'll go crazy and buy a
quad proc motherboard and get the 15000 mark scores, but once again
this is all beside the point.

All I was ever trying to say is that for a console to succeed you need
to tap into a previously untapped market, or do something incredibly
crazy. Nintendo did both and managed to get hardcore PC gamers to stop
playing their MMO's every now and then and made a system that parents
buy their kids because they think it's an alternative to exercising,
and they are reaping the profits.
