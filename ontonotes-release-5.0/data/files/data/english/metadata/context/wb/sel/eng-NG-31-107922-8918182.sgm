Another quote about the ccws from an article. It doesn't sound too
good if you believe this writer.

&quot;But motoring sources say the Champ Car World Series is on its knees
financially and will be lucky to survive beyond the final event of the
14-race season in Mexico City on November 11.

Australian-born billionaire and series boss Kevin Kalkhoven has kept
the series afloat but there's increasing speculation he may bail.&quot;

And I am going to speculate that the IRL 500 may be in danger because
its not selling out.  Tony George might sell and the new owners are
likely to put a gasp stock car race on during the month of May.

Now sarcasm and specuation mode off.  Both series are hurting.  Both
series are existing only because the owners have deep pockets.  Both
series can last as long as those deep pockets desire.  IF either
series were to fail, it will do absolutely nothing to help the

You are only slightly wrong. Champ Car exists because the owner has deep
pockets. The IRL exists because of the Indy 500. That is a big difference.

Announcement or not, watch the last two.  Never know what will happen.

I traveled to California a few years ago to see the CART race at
Fontana.  I expected it to be the final CART race.  That was the one
that was cancelled because of brush fires all over the region.

It never got rescheduled.  Various reasons given at the time, but I
think it really came down to CART being in financial trouble and not
having the resources to deal with it.  They filed bankruptcy in the
off season, so I never got to see the last CART race...which was the
one before.

I won't be able to travel to the final CCWS races, but I'm sure going
to watch them on TV.  I hope Tracy sweeps them.

I strongly disagree with you there.  First the last real Indy 500 ran
in May of 1995.  The IRL 500 has never shown any growth with the
possible exception of purse (and that would have to be adjusted for
inflation) but everything else is way way down for the IRL 500.  Is it
still a money maker?  For now, but not nearly as much as it once was.
Maybe its paying the bills for the rest of the year, but I doubt it.
The Brickyard maybe filling the gap, but it doesn't matter.

The Hulman Company, the real income source makes a number of products
including Clabber Girl Baking Powder.  Tony has the resources to put a
field of 33 cars in place for the IRL 500 for the rest of his life
should he choose to do so with not a cent from anything other than the
other businesses.  The way open wheel racing is going he might be
looking at a bill for fielding all 33 cars at the IRL 500 in the not
too distant future.

All he had to do was nothing, and open wheel would have far far better
off.  He couldn't even seem to do nothing right.

Over the long term, Champ Car has a better shot than most realize
going international.  It just doesn't include me.  In time it could
once again challenge F1 if F1 can't get itself together.  With the
loss of the Indy 500, the spec IRL 500 just hasn't had the life
support turned off.  Ego can be a powerful thing.  I doubt it will
anytime soon, but I could see any of several events happening that
could trigger events that could put the IRL 500 at risk.

CART and ChampCar are one in the same.  I don't care what their &quot;legal&quot;
name
is or was.  CART still exists but it's now called ChampCar.  ChampCar
existed
in the 1980's and was called CART.  CART is ChampCar.  ChampCar is CART.

You'd think they were the same, but somehow it's different.  Different
ownership does that.  Ever have a favorite restaurant go belly-up and
re-open with a new owner?  Even with the same waiters, it's just not
the same.

Anyway, watch the final races, if only to not miss the end of a
management era.

Ken you can't know that unless you see the books.   I believe I read
Fred Nation has admitted the IRL hasn't made money but wouldn't put
figure on the amounts.  If it isn't coming from the IRL then its
coming from somewhere.  Yes the Brickyard was and option but it also
had to make up for the F1 race as well.  Maybe it could do it, but it
really is inmaterial.  Tony has the resources to pay for any amount of
racing he wants for as long as he wants whether its a good business
move or not.  Rahal in particular was a part of the last minute, buy
the teams attempt to shut down Champ Car right before Long Beach.  I
thought Penske and Ganassi were the problems.  Wasn't Chip among the
earliest to bring in the young foreign drivers instead of those heros
of the short tracks???    Roger is how old now?  He has to be getting
close to retirement.  He enjoys the racing experience, but will the
team continue when he retires?

Fact is they are both just spec series.  Fact neither is growing yet.
Fact the 500 has lost much of what made it special.  No inovation.  No
new technology.  No records.  No different engines. Not all the best
open wheel talent participating.   Opinion the real Indy 500 died in
95 to be replaced by the IRL 500 that is just a shell of its former
self.  That shell just hasn't broken yet.  It will.

IF its all about the 500, than its all about 1995 the year the racing
died.  IF its all about the IRL 500 then its much ado about nothing.
They barely get a full field and the number of real bumps can be
counted on one hand.  Here selling tickets to the IRL event is done
bundling the tickets with the Nascar event.  Yeah Tony fixed it.  He
turned back the clock to 1960 where no one cared about anything but
the 500, no one could make any money, and the real racers were
struggling to even pay the most basic of bills.  The only thing that
isn't like the 60s is that drivers actually expect to survive their
careers.

It's coming out of the Speedway.  For the 500, multiply the 300,000 or
so seats by ticket prices, add something for general admission and
concessions, and they're grossing well over $30 million.  Purse is
about $10 million from the Speedway, plus more from sponsors.  The
Speedway has about 100 employees.  Even if they get paid generously,
there's still a pile of money left.  Certainly enough to account for
the continuing improvements to the facility.

Add the Brickyard 400, and IMS is awash with money.

F1 track was originally budgeted at $25 million.  I'm sure they went
over, but probably not double.  By the time they built it they would
have had a ton of money put away from the excess Brickyard profits.

If it died, it was seriously wonded before then.  1995 was the year
the 500 winner was clearly running Indy cars as a stepping stone to
F1.  CART was already a place where retired F1 drivers could go to
keep on making a living.

Yes, they had lots of entries (not as many as in the 60s) and a good
crowd.  But if you cut the head off a chicken it runs around pretty
vigorously before it keels over.

It's not.  Like I said before, Tony did get too wrapped up in his
hammer and lost some of the vision.

But there is some consolation in that Formula 1 has also become a
ticket to NASCAR, so it's not like IRL is alone.  In fact, if you look
at it that way, IRL is a step above CCWS because IRL stars go directly
to NASCAR, while CCWS stars have to work their way up through F1.

&gt; &gt;coming from somewhere.  Yes the Brickyard was and option but it also
&gt; &gt;had to make up for the F1 race as well.

&gt; [snip]

&gt; It's coming out of the Speedway.  For the 500, multiply the 300,000 or
&gt; so seats by ticket prices, add something for general admission and
&gt; concessions, and they're grossing well over $30 million.  Purse is
&gt; about $10 million from the Speedway, plus more from sponsors.  The
&gt; Speedway has about 100 employees.  Even if they get paid generously,
&gt; there's still a pile of money left.  Certainly enough to account for
&gt; the continuing improvements to the facility.

&gt; Add the Brickyard 400, and IMS is awash with money.
">

The first number I would question is the 300,000 seats.  Nascar.com
lists the seating capacity at IMS as 250,000.  For years IMS wouldn't
release how many seats there were, so someone from the Star hired
someone to basically go count them.  It is pretty clear the 250,000 is
a rounded off number, but its also clear there are not 300,000 seats
in the place.  Second is the place wasn't even close to being sold
out.  Yeah there were some general admission but that is the lowest of
the ticket prices and the lowest revenue generators.  Someone likely
said that there were 450-500,000 people attending this year.  Some
political hack trying to get their name in the paper, but also having
no clue that the place doesn't even hold close to that many seats and
they aren't sold out.

Second is sponsors.  The series has no title sponsor.  No revenue
there.  Any other revenue generated would be generated as a track
owner not as a series.  How they handle the sanction fee the IRL gets
for hosting the IRL 500 would be one for the accountants.  You also
haven't factored in the high cost of insurance, not only the
structures but the fans themselves that attend.  The 100 employees
sounds about right for full time employees, but May there are likely
many many more that are temporary.  Not nearly as many as were needed
in the past, but some still needed.  Why?  No one for all practical
purposes shows up for anything other than the race anymore so you
don't have to go pick up after them.  Look at the tapes of pole day
and bump day in 95 and compare them with last year.  The mess has to
be cleaned up and I would doubt they would keep them on the payroll
year round for a few weeks a year.

Next thing is to consider is taxes.  What's the old saying.  Don't
spend your gross income.  Though they likely get some state and local
tax breaks, I doubt there are any federal ones and I think you can
safely deduct about a 1/3 off the top for federal taxes.

&gt; F1 track was originally budgeted at $25 million.  I'm sure they went
&gt; over, but probably not double.  By the time they built it they would
&gt; have had a ton of money put away from the excess Brickyard profits.
">

Brickyard maybe profitable, but Nascar may have gotten a sweet heart
deal to get the IRL on ISC tracks.  It may be the source of the
income, but who really knows.  It could also be more of a &quot;I'll let
you run our tracks if you let us run yours type of deal&quot;.   Nascar may
be getting more of the pie than we know.

One thing is for sure.  The only person that ever made a nickel from
the F1 race there is Bernie E.    You know the same guy that referred
to the IRL's greatest personality as a kitchen appliance.  Even though
IMS got a big break in the sanctioning fee, F1 like it usually does
let politics get in the way of sound business.  The infamous US grand
prix will be remembered and it will be a very long time before any US
venue will have a decent shot at success.  It likely will not happen
till after Bernie and Max are totally out of the picture.  If they did
anything with F1, at best it was break even.

He didn't forget anything.  The main vision he ever had was who was in
control.  Pre Cart  it was USAC correct?  And who ran USAC???  Who
still runs USAC???  He now has the same amount of control as grand
dad.  He had his vision the day the IRL was founded.  He was not a
track owner anymore but a series owner.  USAC makes an awful training
ground for modern open wheel race cars. Front engine, high hp, short
tracks, non aero  has a great deal more in common with a stock car
than the rear engined, winged, aero, high downforce, car of the IRL.
USAC never adapted so they were left behind.  Even Tony, after a few
people in methodist, realized that the skills needed to run the two
different cars were just too different to co exist without a training
ground.  IPS.  No way it will ever go back unless USAC changes.  PJ
Chesson might be good in a sprint car, but he has no more business
being in a formula aero car on a road course than I do.  Better off in

New and different cars every year.  The ability to build your own if

there were some F1 drivers coming over, but for some very good
reasons.  Unlike now, it wasn't the back markers that were coming over
but the stars.  Why?  They could make good money, with far less
hassle, far less travel, far less back biting and politics and get
back to enjoying racing.  Guess it was ok when Graham Hill and Jimmy
Clark would come over and cherry pick the 500, but not ok when Emmo
and Nigel came over an ran the full series as a part of the group.
None of the F1 guys had lost their skills when they made the switch.
Talent should always be welcome where ever it comes from and no one
should question whether or not those guys had talent.

Compare that to the talent in the early days of the IRL that saw the
likes of Dr. Jack, Racin Gardner, 00 Joe, Brad Murphy, Scott
Harrington, Greg Ray and any of a host of people that got to drive the
500 that had absolutely no business out there.  Nothing changed at the
back.  To illstrate my point I present the lovely Milka Duno.  From
everything I have seen and read she is a lovely lady that is smart,
personable and has absolutely no business in a race car at that level.

An most of those entries in the sixties were poorly funded, poorly

around, though there were some that struggle, most that made the field

things needed to field a race car.  Now I won't disagree with you

The Indianapolis Star a couple of years ago had a reporter walk and
count every seat at IMS and came up with a number of around 260,000.
It has been reported many times that IMS has never sought tax
abatement or any direct government subsidy (unlike our Colts) so if
they are getting any tax breaks, I would argue they are getting the
same ones open to any business under the tax codes. Clearly open wheel
is suffering and I doubt anyone would say it's in better shape now
than in 95 before the split, but I saw more empty seats at the
Brickyard this year than at the 500 for the first time. I think racing
in all forms is hurting as the economy limps along, jobs are
disappearing overseas and foreclosures are at an all-time high. So TG
is an easy target for all that ails top level US open wheel racing,
but the bottom line IMO is that nothing will change until unification
occurs, and maybe not even then. The casual fan doesn't know the dif
between a Dallara, Panoz or a Williams, and until they start going to
the track for the racing (not the hype ala WWSprintcup) open wheel is
arguably reduced to a niche sport with diehard fans like the people on
this forum who are passionate about it and willing to spend time and
money to support their favorite series. It's all good, whatever series

The tale I remember is of some Penske crewmen whiling away a rainy day

The number of seats does change from year to year, and I think even
from one event to another.  The F1 garage cost some of the Terrace
seats, and they had to accomodate those customers with seats
elsewhere.  Seats inside the turns come and go.  Is that grandstand

I had eight Paddock tickets for the Brickyard 400.  About a third of
the way up in the lower deck, right near the S/F line.  Excellent
seats.  For quite some time I had no trouble selling the extras, just
word of mouth among friends

Then one year - coincidentally (or maybe not) the year Winston Cup
became Nextel Cup - none of my friends had any interest in the 400.
Finally moved them on e-bay at about 90% of face.  Watching the
auctions in the final hours, there were a lot of good seats that went
unsold.

A couple of years earlier I probably could have retired on an e-bay
auction of those seats.

Watched a little bit of this past Sunday's NC race.  The empty seats
were pretty noticable.

Hate to think of OW as a niche sport, beyond the niche status that
auto racing has always had.  But the split is definitely hutring
things.  Another thing that hurts, IMHO, is that there are more than
just a handful of ride buyers in both series.  How can anyone get
excited over a driver if they know the team owner doesn't think he's
worth a salary?

What Tony Hulman set as a goal decades ago doesn't impact  or IMHO
effect Tony George now at all.  Its just ancient history.  They may be
getting some tax breaks that are long running but maybe not.  That you
likely could find out with a public record search, but I frankly don't
care.

Yes the number of seats have gone up and down, but until 95 they were
always able to fill the perament seats.  Yes they occasionally built
temporary seats (no more) and yes the F1 garages took up some seats,
which may account for the difference on the Nascar.com website and the
260,000 and change number I seem to recall.  Google it and see what
you come up with but there is no way there is 300thou there now.
Either way there is no way it can be awash with money.

The Brickyard attendance really is more of a statement of the mistakes
Nascar has made than anything about the economy.  The Chase, locked in
top 35 spots have chased away more loyal long time fans than Carter
has liver pills.

Curt Cavin said he counted all of them circa 2003/2004 (it's a big
place) and came up with 257,325.

Even at 257,000 seats (I'll believe Cavin) by the time you mulitply by

35/8.  Not good.  They did that without even being in a war.  Didn't a
10th fastest qualifier recently wind up on the trailer because he
wasn't in the 35?  The IRL never actually went through with bumping a
faster qualifier in favor of one of their 25.

But my recollection is that the year my BY tickets tanked was before
35/8 or the Chase.  Something was already slipping.

Chase should be getting even worse soon.  I expect them to have a
separate point structure among the chasers.  If they finish 1, 10, 15,
etc., instead of getting the customary 1st, 10th, 15th place points,
they'll get 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.  That will compress the championship
into even more of a random event.  But it will ensure a multi-driver
shootout in the final race.

An amusing aspect of that is that, while Bill and Bill Jr. actively
managed NASCAR (rather well, as we know), Tony George is the first
member of the Hulman family to actively manage the Speedway.  One of
Tony Hulman's conditions on saving it was that Wilbur Shaw would run
the place.  Hulman took a more active role after Shaw died, but he
still relied on hired hands.  After Mr. Hulman died, control was in
the hands of a group of ladies, who also paid others to run the place.

And an amusing aspect of Tony's mismanagement of OW racing is that he

That doesn't take into so many huge expenses like insurance, cost of
capital, taxes ect   I would be shocked if they are swimming in dough,
though the event is profitable for now.

No they never actually went through with it and bumped anyone for the
25/8.  What they did was just as bad or worse.  They just let people
think they were going to be bumped and go out and try to qualify on a
questionable track.  Scott Harrington wound up in Methodist trying to
bump his way into the field with the rules in place and ended up
having to pay for a race car.  He was faster than the 25th locked in
spot, but not in the field as the way the rules were written at the
beginning of the month.  Then they just decided to add two car so they
could say they started the fastest 33.  The traditional field of 33
cars was protected by adding two cars (and should have been a third
and probably would have been if he hadn't been hurt.) so everything to
them was fine.

A little of it was likely the new wearing off the race and Indy is
more or less a flat track to the stockers and stockers typically like
high banks.  The chase and 35/8 are the biggest mistakes Nascar ever
made.  Instead of protecting its series, Nascar was protecting its
sponsors.  Both equally bad.

I would not be surprised to have another level of the chase added to
make sure there won't be a runaway.  This is something others have
predicted from its onset.  I frankly expect that soon you will see X
number of cars totally even like a football playoff with a winner take
all at the final race.  Makes luck even more apart of it but Nascar
won't have a say in what they do.  Tv will tell them how they want it
done and if they want the TV money, Nascar will do what they tell
them.

I am not so sure how well Nascar was managed or if its just taken a
while for it to grow enough for the problems to surface.  Now you
don't have race fans.  You have Jeff Gordon fans.  You have Dale Jr.
fans.  The most loyal fan is a fan that will watch a race regardless
of who is in the car.  The quick way was to sell the driver.  The
smart way is to sell the racing and competition.

Sometimes the best management is to find the right people, give them a
task, give them to tools they need to do a job, then leave them alone
and let them do it.  Mr. Hulman had other things going taking his
time.  Tony would have been well served to follow his example and
likely the split never would have happened.  Now that it has, he name
is personally attached to it and will forever be a polarizing name.
Either you like him or not, but he will never be able to put the fan
base back together.  Neither will anyone that works for him.

I think NASCAR has always had fans pulling for a favorite driver.
Used to be for a favorite car, but all the cars are the same now.

I've had my favorite NASCAR drivers through the years.  Fireball
Roberts.  Marvin Panch.  Cale Yarborough.  Nowadays I seem to get more
kicks out of certain drivers (either Busch) losing.

IMHO, favorite drivers is generally a good link with local racing,
where everyone does have their favorite.  In Pennsylvania Sprints I
always rooted for Cris Eash, and against Judi Bates.  I have a friend
who roots for Bob Bennett, and has been sky-high after Bennett
actually won a feature.

But you're right - NASCAR is piling onto that way more than they
should.  Those Kasey Kahne commercials are downright embarrassing.
