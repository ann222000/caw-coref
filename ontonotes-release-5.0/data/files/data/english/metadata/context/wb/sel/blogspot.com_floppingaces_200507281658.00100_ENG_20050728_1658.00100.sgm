LAPD Shooting's Update
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>Thanks to Warren at UpsideUSA for giving me the heads up that some
new information has come out about two recent shootings I have blogged
about recently. Apparently Chief Bratton is allowing some outside
experts to come into the investigation of the shootings involving Jose
Pena and his daughter plus the Devin Brown shooting where the 13 year
old gangster tried to run into the police: LAPD Chief William Bratton
said Tuesday he will invite outside experts to join an internal review
of the police shooting of Jose Raul Pena and his toddler daughter, an
unusual move he said reflects the "exceptional' nature of the case. ...
Unlike most boards, the chief said, this one will include law
enforcement experts unaffiliated with the Los Angeles Police Department.
While specific members have yet to be named, the chief cited the
National Tactical Officers Association as an example of a group that
could be tapped. "It warranted the department making every effort to
determine what happened, what we can learn from it, and how we can make
sure it never happens again," he said, adding that 19-month-old Suzie
Pena was the first hostage killed by police gunfire in the SWAT team's
four-decade history. The board will be overseen by Assistant Chief
Sharon Papa, who said she will look for "a good cross-section of people'
to take part. He also spoke about the re-enactment of the Devin Brown
shooting: Police will turn over the results of their investigation into
the February shooting death of 13-year-old Devin Brown to the District
Attorney's Office on Aug. 1, Bratton said. Police have determined that
an officer fired 10 shots at the teen as he backed a car into a police
cruiser and hit him seven times. In investigating the incident at 83rd
Street and Western Avenue, the department re-created the scene, complete
with paving and painting, in a vacant field in the San Fernando Valley,
said Deputy Chief Michael Berkow. With observers from numerous outside
agencies present, police studied ballistics and trajectories using
lasers and other technology. "A lot of what we learned on the Devin
Brown re-enactment will be applicable to the SWAT shooting," Bratton
said. The chief said he does not think there was criminal conduct by
officers in either case, though the decision is the domain of the
district attorney. The one thing not unsurprising about the is their
ability to stir the pot with the slightest bit of information. Take this
photo the LAPD released showing the re-enactment of the Devin Brown
shooting: And here we go with the media who jump in with their monday
morning quarterbacking : An elaborate re-creation of the fatal police
shooting of 13-year-old Devin Brown, staged on a vacant lot in Granada
Hills by the LAPD with help from Hollywood experts, casts doubts on a
central justification for the shooting: that the officer was standing in
the path of the teenager's oncoming car when he opened fire. The Feb. 6
shooting unfolded at the end of a brief chase in which Devin drove onto
a sidewalk, then backed the stolen car toward officers at 83rd Street
and Western Avenue in South Los Angeles. Ever since, police
investigators have been trying to determine whether the officer was
standing directly in the path of the car or off to the side. Police
Chief William J. Bratton said Tuesday that by painstakingly reenacting
the shooting, detectives had concluded that Officer Steve Garcia was
standing to the side of Devin's red Toyota Camry when he fired 10 rounds
into the vehicle, hitting Devin seven times. The finding is potentially
crucial, because Garcia has told investigators that he felt in danger as
Devin backed the car toward him, leaving him no choice but to shoot, law
enforcement sources say. LAPD rules allow an officer to fire at a moving
vehicle if he believes his life or the lives of bystanders are in
jeopardy. ... The reenactment showed that although Garcia was not behind
Devin's vehicle when he fired, he had been within the car's path a few
seconds earlier. Several LAPD sources said detectives were examining the
possibility that Garcia drew his gun while behind the car but fired
seconds later after moving to the side. Critics of the shooting,
however, said the findings underscored their belief that Garcia shot at
Devin unnecessarily and that the officer's life was not in jeopardy. "If
the officer is not in the path of the vehicle, it will be very difficult
to sell this as a clean shooting, and that's just physics," said Brian
Dunn, an attorney representing the Brown family in a civil suit against
the city. "A car does not move sideways. It moves forward and backward."
Yup, according to Dunn the only real justification would have been if
the officer dug his feet into the ground while the car is speeding
towards him and to only shoot then. Far be it for the officer to move
out of the path while ending the deadly threat that this idiot posed.
Maybe he could have shot the gas tank and then blew the whole car up
also, just like the movies....which most of these idiots have obviously
seen way to often. The fact is that if a 3,000lb piece of metal is
coming at a officer driven by a suspect who had already tried to elude
him, he will get out of the way while firing his weapon to make sure
that if he does get out of the way successfully, that the driver is not
able to turn the vehicle and attempt to kill him again.... This officer
along with the Jose Pena shooting officers will not have charges filed
against them. They did nothing wrong and hopefully the system works the
way it should, but...you never can tell in LA. Everything is ruled by
the PC police. My favorite statement was by Devin Brown's family lawyer:
"What we are not seeing are specific facts that go to the heart of
whether this was a justified shooting," Dunn said. "It will boil down
to: Where was the officer standing when he fired all 10 rounds? Why did
he not stop to assess the situation after firing one round?" Oh boy
thats rich. We should now fire one round, see if it hit the guy and if
he is still going, if he still trying to kill me then I will fire
another round. Not working yet? Ok, one more round. Freakin retards.
