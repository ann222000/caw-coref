Misfired Patriot missile hits farm in Qatar
Tue Oct 16, 2007 11:54am EDT

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. forces in Qatar accidentally fired a
Patriot missile at a farm in the Gulf Arab state, but caused no
injuries, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.

The U.S. military is investigating the missile launch, first reported
by Al Jazeera television. The Patriot system is an anti-missile
system.

&quot;Those things are not supposed to accidentally discharge,&quot; said
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman. &quot;It was not supposed to happen.&quot;

Whitman said the missile was fired into an unpopulated farm area.

Al Jazeera said the missile was fired from Assayliyah base.

U.S.-allied Qatar was a launch pad for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq
in 2003.

Well, in defense of the Patriot missile system, it does have the ability to
act in defense of itself should it feel something is a threat.  But it has
to be placed into that mode.

If the farm were approaching in a certain profile the system could have
decided to take it out.

Keep in mind, however, that the last time I worked inside a Patriot ECS
shelter was late-2003 so the system has probably changed some.

Debate flies over 'sex play' in kindergartens
A specialist in early childhood education in Oslo is giving new meaning
to the term &quot;sexual games,&quot; and stirring widespread debate.

&quot;The only thing that is absolutely certain is that children, sooner or
later, will play sexual games and examine each other...&quot; claims
pre-school specialist Pia Friis.

PHOTO: TOR RICHARDSEN/SCANPIX

Family therapist Jesper Juul, who writes a popular column in
Aftenposten's weekly magazine, agrees that children's sexuality
shouldn't be stifled.

PHOTO: AFTENPOSTEN

Norwegians woke up Tuesday morning to news that a respected Oslo
pre-school teacher, backed by child psychologists, thinks children
should be allowed to openly express their own sexuality, not least
through sex play and games in the local day care centers known as
barnehager, or kindergartens.

The vast majority of Norwegians send their children from the age of one
to the kindergartens, where they spend their days until they begin
school at age six.

Pia Friis, leader of the popular Bjerkealleen Barnehage in Oslo and a
well-known pre-school educator, told newspaper Dagbladet on Tuesday that
children should be allowed to express their own sexuality at day care
centers. She doesn't want to stifle what comes naturally.

Children, she said, should be able &quot;to look at each other and examine
each other's bodies. They can play doctor, play mother and father, dance
naked and masturbate.

&quot;But their sexuality must also be socialized, so they are not, for
example, allowed to masturbate while sitting and eating. Nor can they be
allowed to pressure other children into doing things they don't want to.&quot;

Friis said there's a lot of uncertainty around how day care center
employees should handle children's sexuality.

&quot;The only thing that is absolutely certain is that children, sooner or
later, will play sexual games and examine each other at the
kindergarten,&quot; she told Dagbladet. &quot;When the personnel are uncertain,
that passes on to the children, and it can be negative.&quot;

The issue is the topic of an article in the latest edition of the
magazine published by Norway's industry association for privately owned
kindergartens, PBL-nytt, and Friis thinks it's important. So do child
psychologist Thore Langfeldt and family therapist Jesper Juul.

&quot;Children must learn about sexuality, otherwise things can go very
wrong,&quot; said Langfeldt. &quot;Children can't object to something they don't
know about, and children can more easily and readily report assaults if
they already are aware of their own sexuality.&quot;

Juul conceded that &quot;many are disturbed by children's sexuality, but I
think it's important to put it on the agenda. That, in fact, is what
we're doing.&quot;

While Norwegians are known for being liberal and tolerant, the issue
already has sparked heated debate on radio programs and in online
opinion forums. And some politicians are outraged, not least those on
the conservative side.

&quot;I thought at first that this was a joke,&quot; said Karin Ståhl Woldseth, a
spokesman on family issues for the Progress Party.

&quot;Sexual games don't belong in a kindergarten,&quot; she declared. &quot;Children
don't need more exposure to this in kindergartens. We think it will
damage their health.&quot;
