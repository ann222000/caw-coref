~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Not necessarily, Ray.
Casey wasn't dashed on the rocks. Casey inherited a monumental
piece of mismanagement and left the ship in better shape than
it was when he arrived. And he was rewarded for his effort.

Problem with the Iraqis is that they have no heroes (oops. "military
celebrities") like MacArthur, Nimitz, Sheridan, Patton, etc.  The
closest thing to a hero for them is Saddam whose troops are STILL
fighting the Shia majority.

The Iraq nation needs an heroic general bigtime.  Remember it was
a Kurd general who whipped the Crusaders.  Kurds come in handy
because they don't engage in sectarian bullshit.  They go after the
enemies of the secular state with a vengeance. Especially the ones who
mess with the oil fields.

As a trivia point in WWII, Lieutenant Colonel Creighton Abrams was a tank
battalion commander in Patton's Third Army when his units tanks were blown
up by mines in the road.  His answer was to send his tanks down each side of
the road, taking out any, and all, German buildings.

Adolph Hitler, in a speech called him, "Roosevelt's Jewish butcher."  Abrams
wasn't Jewish, but when Patton heard that Abrams had been "mentioned in
dispatches" - even though they were the enemies dispaches - he promptly went
to Abram's unit and awarded Abrams a medal.

Gotta go now, and make dinner.

Really!  I didn't think of "Abrams" as a variant of  "Abraham."
The People of the Book are everywhere, aren't they ?
I am rather impressed by the Islamic militant in Indonesia
who has spoken out against the bombing of innocents.
Why?  Indonesia is the largest Muslim country on Earth.
I have always thought that Javanese Muslims are a special
breed, like the Muslim French. Sumatera is another horse
altogether.  They are inclined to the sharia hardline. They
have no love lost for the Sundanese of Java.

'Peanuts' for Petraeus
Everybody's a General in the Army called Congress.

Saturday, March 17, 2007
The Wall Street Journal

To understand why the Founders put Presidents in charge of war fighting,
look no further than the supplemental war spending bill now moving through
the House.

Everybody's a four-star in Congress's Army, and every general
wants his own command, especially if it includes cash for the troops, er,
campaign contributors. Too bad none of this bears any relation to what real
General David Petraeus is trying to accomplish in Iraq.

Spot On! -- DSH
---------------------------------

Not that we don't sympathize with Defense Secretary Nancy Pelosi.

She won the majority in part by riding antiwar sentiment, and now her
antiwar ranks are demanding satisfaction.

That's about 70 Democrat members of the House. -- DSH

So she's moved beyond the political evasion of "non-binding" resolutions and
is trying to attach binding legal restrictions in spending bills on
President Bush's ability to conduct the war.

This is the strategy she and General Jack Murtha have worked out.

BINGO!  The Democrat Political Strategy concerning Iraq is all focused on
the premise that "The War Is Lost" [as Pogue Bush keeps telling us] and
"Bush is leading us over a cliff". -- DSH

They hope to get all the credit for their abject cowardice in 2008 and
thereby reap the benefits.  Pogue Gans is firmly in this camp with his
fellow Donkey Democrats.  Pogue Gans tells us repeatedly that Iraq is like a
broken egg and Humpty Dumpty cannot be put back together again. -- DSH

Trouble is, some of her sincere antiwar Members don't think even this goes
far enough and want to cut off funding for the war immediately. (Wisconsin
Democrat David Obey recently referred to this crowd as "idiot liberals," a
phrase we've often longed to use but thought a tad unsubtle.)

Yes, and Obey was caught on videotape using that phrase.  He was referring
to the 70 "Cut &amp; Run Right Now" Democrats. -- DSH

And double trouble is, Speaker Pelosi also has more-moderate Members from
swing districts who wouldn't be caught dead voting to de-fund the troops.

They don't want to be seen "micromanaging" the war either, to quote
Tennessee Democrat Jim Cooper's apt word. This angst was also on display
this week in the Senate, which rejected similar stop-the-war-now language as
all but one Republican held and three Democrats defected.

Yet the Pogue Gans Democrats continue to insist they can support the
troops -- without supporting what they are DOING in Iraq -- the MISSION --
an utter nonsense of  a position.  -- DSH

So what's a leader of Congress to do to get a majority? You know the answer:

Let the vote-buying begin!  Thus has Mr. Bush's request for $100 billion to
fund the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, plus $3 billion to replenish the
disaster-relief fund, devolved into a $124.6 billion logrolling
extravaganza.

CONGRESSIONAL PORK! -- DSH

You can get the flavor from the bill's very first words on page two: "Title
I -- Supplemental Appropriations for the Global War on Terror Chapter 1
Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service."

Forget the Marines; send in the meat inspectors.

This bill has everything the modern military doesn't need.

There's $25 million for spinach, designed to attract the vote of Sam Farr, a
California farm-region liberal.  Perhaps spinach growers who lost business
due to last year's E. coli scare need this taxpayer bailout, but it won't
intimidate the Taliban unless Mr. Farr plans to draft Popeye.

&lt;G&gt; -- DSH

Other lowlights include $20 million to restore farmland damaged by freezing
temperatures, and $1.48 billion for livestock farmers. And don't forget the
$74 million "to ensure proper storage for peanuts," an urgent
national-security need.

This happens to be about the same amount that House Democrats propose to
increase spending for operations of the Army Reserve, so it's good to see
Congress has its priorities in order.

Then there are the provisions to raise the minimum wage, at one pace for the
continental U.S. but at a separate, slower pace for the Northern Mariana
Islands.  And $500 million for "urgent wildland fire suppression"--that's
forest fires, not weapons fire.

That one is VERY succulent PORK for Nancy Pelosi -- the California
Democrat -- and will serve to SOCIALIZE RISKS for home-builders who want to
perch themselves up some forested canyon, far from any Fire Department --
and brush-infested throughout.  -- DSH

There's so much more, if only the press corps would take the time to look.

This pork-barrel blowout is grounds enough for a Presidential veto.

But the vote-buying is more important for what it says about Congress and
the way it wants to micromanage the war.  Any legislature is essentially a
committee of special interests, each of which wants to be massaged.

This is true of war strategy as much as farm policy. The goal isn't victory
in Iraq, but "victory" on Capitol Hill, which means cobbling together a
majority of 218 in the House and 51 in the Senate.

Logrolling and micromanagement are two sides of the same coin of the
legislative Pentagon.

In any case, Democrats still aren't taking any real war responsibility.

Instead of cutting off funds right now, which would at least be a policy,
they kick the issue down the road by imposing "benchmarks." So unless the
Iraqis meet certain conditions set by Congress by July 1 and October 1 of
this year, U.S. troops will have to redeploy at once and finish within 180
days.  And even if these earmarks -- sorry, benchmarks -- are met, all U.S.
troops must begin to retreat by March 2008.

All of this is flatly unconstitutional, but far worse it is an insult to the
troops in the field.  If Iraq's parliament somehow gets bogged down -- like
Congress? -- on de-Baathification or dividing up oil revenues, American
troops have to end their mission.

So General Petraeus's war strategy is made hostage to TWO legislatures, in
Baghdad and the Beltway.

BINGO! -- DSH

Once the U.S. retreats, American forces would then be permitted only to
fight al Qaeda and "other terrorist organizations with global reach."

So the Army Colonel leading a strike brigade would have to think twice, or
consult his lawyers, about just what constitutes "global reach."

BINGO! -- DSH

Did Abu Musab al-Zarqawi qualify since he merely called his outfit "al Qaeda
in Iraq"?

Democrats are trying to appease their antiwar left by attaching a thousand
bureaucratic and legal strings, rather than being accountable with an
up-or-down funding vote. As Mr. Obey told those "idiot liberals" in a moment
of candor caught on camera, he believes this "bill ends the war."  Just not
honestly.

Meanwhile, on the Baghdad battlefield, General Petraeus is moving ahead and
signs of tentative progress are visible. Shiite death squads are laying low
or leaving town, so casualties are down.  The new oil law looks like a
political breakthrough that would share revenues with all parts of Iraq
based on population.  Success isn't certain, but the Democratic Congress's
only contribution is to make victory more difficult.

Because they don't BELIEVE in VICTORY for the TROOPS and want to saddle the
Republicans with an ALBATROSS LOSS.
