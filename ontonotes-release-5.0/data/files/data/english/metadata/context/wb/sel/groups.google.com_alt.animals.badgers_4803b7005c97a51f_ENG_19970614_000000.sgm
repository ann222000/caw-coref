Anthony,

If this is a serious post, here is a serious answer: Get him to the
vet as soon as possible. He may need nothing more than antibiotics,
but even the flu can be serious if untreated.

Most vets will have never seen a badger before, but any good vet will
be able to help you. Vets see enough ferrets these days and, though we
are loath to admit it, they are our cousins.

In the meantime, it's critical that Barry has all the fresh water he
wants.
