***********************************************************

A Christian who lived sixteen hundred years ago, Saint Augustine, left
behind some words that open wide the gates of the Gospel. He struggled a
great deal to come to God. He suffered from his behavior as a young man.
He was so honest with himself that at times he must have despaired of
his own self. Then one day, he was able to write down these words: &quot;If
you desire to know God, you already have faith.&quot;  --From the book: Peace
of Heart in All Things

Be a God pleaser not a people pleaser.

God offers us joy even when life seems fruitless.

God is with us even when we don't feel God's presence.

Everything we do for Christ is valuable.

Consistently studying the Bible and seeking God adds depth and harmony
to our lives. When we listen for all the notes and hear God's call on
our life, we can enjoy the fullness of the music and the depth of God's
love.

God sees us as we are and loves us through and through.

***********************************************************

Are You Selfish?
The more we only think of ourselves, we become selfish. Being selfish is
when we refuse to share ourselves with others, and expect others to
share themselves 100% with us.
Selfishness is rampant. I conducted my own little test in 2002 in
various settings and found so much selfishness. I obsevered Christians
only talking about themselves, what happened during their day, and what
happened at their work. I see selfishness in my own life, and the Holy
Spirit has not only helped me see it, but also has helped me to do
better. You too?
Do you treat others like you want to be treated? Just as we are bent on
looking out after our own interest, we must turn that around and apply
the same to other people. Treat them like we want to be treated.
Be honest. Think about how you have treated others. Have you treated
them like you'd want to be treated? Or have you been only thinking of
your stuff? Have you been so caught up in doing &quot;your things&quot; that
you've left someone in a bind? Have you taken advantage of someone's
kindness and not paid the full price that you should have?
Often our loneliness, sadness and emotional turmoil is rooted in us only
being concerned about ourselves. When we treat others like we want to be
treated it not only blesses others but we are blessed.
What has happened to sound judgment? When we become selfish, we are
unable to make sound judgments because selfishness makes us think only
of ourselves. Good judgment always considers the well-being of others.
A good test for being selfless is how long can you treat others as you'd
like to be treated even when they are not returning it? Even if they
despise your selflessness, can you keep it up for a week, a month or
years? You can't without the help of the Holy Spirit. It is only the
power of Christ in you that enables you to be Christ-like when you are
being treated badly.
Maybe you've failed at the Golden Rule due to a lack of dependency upon
the Holy Spirit. Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal to you when you miss the
mark and think only of yourself. Then, ask the Holy Spirit to lead you
into selflessness, so you can treat others like you'd want to be treated.
No enemy will ever become a friend so long as they are treated like an
enemy. No friend will ever become an enemy so long as they are treated
like a friend. Do you want others to be your enemy or friend? Treat them
like friends!
Dear Heavenly Father, help us to treat others like we want to be
treated. In Jesus' Mighty Name, AMEN!  --David Burns

Priceless Treasure
Proverbs 15:6 In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the
revenues of the wicked is trouble.
The house of the diligently and uncompromisingly righteous, built upon
the foundation of Jesus Christ, stands firm and is filled with precious
treasure. I'm not speaking solely of material treasure, for all the
things we need, God provides us with when we seek first His kingdom
(Matthew 6:33). Rather, I'm speaking more about spiritual treasures such
as peace, unity, harmony and safety. Is your dwelling filled with
compassion, forgiveness and unconditional love? Do you feel serene and
at ease in your home? Or do you live among strife, stress and anxiety?
The Scripture says that the earnings of the wicked are trouble. If
you're living a life apart from God and His ways, you may be filling
your house with material possessions, but you'll have plenty of trouble,
disharmony and discord to be sure. It would be better to have less, but
to lead your life pleasing to God with respect for Him:
Better is little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and
trouble therewith.  Proverbs 15:16
Do you want to fill your house with &quot;much treasure&quot;? Seek God's
principals and instruction for godly living in His Word, the holy Bible,
and your house will be filled.
Father, As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord! Amen!  --Week in
the Word

CHOOSING YOUR WAY
Victor Frankl wrote, &quot;We who lived in concentration camps can remember
the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their
last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer
sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing:
the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given
set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.&quot;
Think of all the things you can't control: how many show up on Sunday,
who comes to Christ, the decisions your children make, your health, your
income, among others. You may have some influence over these things, but
not complete control.
The one thing you can control is how you will respond to the situations
you face. With anger, doubt, and self-pity ... or with faith, hope, and
love.
Again and again in the Psalms we encounter David in difficult situations
-- surrounded by enemies, struggling with sin, sinking in despair -- and
again and again we see his absolute resolve to think right: Why are you
so downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in
God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God. (Psalm 43:5)
You and I can't control what happens today, but we can control our
actions. Don't let your situations get the best of you today; no matter
what you face, you can choose your own way.
--Steve May

Examine Your Ways!
Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD.
Lamentations 3:40
A guy rushed into a service station one day and asked the manager if he
had a pay phone. The manager nodded, &quot;Sure, over there.&quot; The guy
inserted a couple of coins, dialled and waited for an answer. Finally
someone came on the line. &quot;Uh, sir,&quot; he said in a deep voice, &quot;could you
use an honest, hard-working young man?&quot; The station manager couldn't
help overhearing the question. After a moment or two the guy said, &quot;Oh,
you already have an honest, hard-working young man? Well, okay. Thanks
all the same.&quot; A broad smile stretched across his face. He hung up the
phone and started back to his car, obviously elated. &quot;Hey, just a
minute,&quot; the station manager said, &quot;I couldn't help but hear your
conversation. Why are you so happy? I thought the man said he already
had someone and didn't need you?&quot; The guy smiled. &quot;Well, you see, I am
that honest, hard-working young man. I was just checking up on myself!&quot;
If you're serious about walking with God, examine yourself regularly.
Are you praying, reading God's Word and renewing your mind daily? How
about your attitudes? Are they slipping? Your attitudes send a signal
before you've said a word. They're like traffic lights. Sometimes they
flash red, which means 'stop, don't get in my way, I'm too busy to love,
help, or care.' Sometimes they flash yellow, which means 'I'm touchy and
out-of-sorts, I could go either way.' Sometimes they flash green, which
means, 'it's go, I'm with you, you can count on me.' The Bible says,
&quot;Let us examine our ways... and... return to the Lord.&quot; What needs to be
examined regularly? &quot;Our ways!&quot;  --The Word For Today

What Ifs
An old sea captain once asked a naval student how he'd handle a sudden
storm. &quot;I'd throw out an anchor, sir,&quot; he replied. &quot;But what if another
storm approached?&quot; asked the captain. &quot;Then I'd throw out another
anchor,&quot; he said. &quot;And what if storms just kept coming?&quot; the old man
asked. &quot;I'd keep throwing out anchors,&quot; said the student. &quot;Hold on,
son,&quot; said the captain, &quot;where are you getting all those anchors?&quot; &quot;From
the same place you keep getting all those storms, sir,&quot; came the reply!
When you're in the thick of things, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the
storm that's raging inside you and start listening to the 'what ifs'.
What if the check doesn't come on time... or the stock loses value... or
your mate walks out... or the test results are bad. The list is endless.
And because Satan knows that &quot;fear involves torment&quot; (1 John 4:18 NKJV),
he'll keep pouring it on. If he can't get you puffed up through pride,
he'll try to bring you down through fear. It's his best tool. But you
don't have to take it! Paul says, &quot;Leave no room... for the devil [give
no opportunity to him]&quot; (Ephesians 4:27 AMP). Jesus told us not to be
&quot;fearful... intimidated... and unsettled&quot; (John 14:27 AMP). Remember,
&quot;The days of the... afflicted are made evil [by anxious thoughts and
forebodings], but he who has a glad heart has a continual feast
[regardless of circumstances].&quot;
Here's the bottom line: God is &quot;utterly trustworthy... He will...
[fulfill His call by hallowing and keeping you]&quot; (1 Thessalonians 5:24
AMP). So, no matter how big your problem is today, keep trusting God --
and He will bring you through!  Author Unknown

Run and Don't Burn Out! by Bill Sherrill
Do you ever have a day when you just feel you are used up? Have you ever
hit a time when you realize that there is just nothing more to give? One
of the current words used to describe that feeling is &quot;burn out.&quot; In
other times it was just called being spiritually exhausted, tired or
weary. There are a myriad of camps and retreat centers which address
nothing else.
Why do you suppose we have fallen prey to this particular malady so
frequently today?
My best guess is that many of us have lost sight of the real goal. Human
beings often need to be able to have an end in sight if we are to retain
our enthusiasm. The work of service is never easy. It is often filled
with disappointment and hardship. Without a clear view of a finish line,
the race becomes too difficult. The Apostle Paul could speak of
finishing the race as he neared the end of his life because he knew
where the finish line was. He had continued to run, in good times and in
bad, because the goal was never in doubt.
Paul also knew how difficult the race could be. So the determined
apostle also encouraged the runners with words like, &quot;But as for you,
brethren, do not grow weary of doing good&quot; (2 Thessalonians 3:13). He
also encouraged the Christians of Galatia with these words: &quot;Let us not
lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow
weary&quot; (Galatians 6:9).
Jesus spoke of being &quot;weary and heavy-laden&quot; with sin and teachings that
exhausted and defeated them; he promised his followers relief and
blessing (Matthew 11:28). Paul wrote to those who were worn out doing of
good. We will reap in due time if we do not exit the race. The light at
the end of the tunnel, the finish line, the reward for continuing, are
all more than phrases to be quoted; they are also promises from God
Himself. The writer of Hebrews continues this same encouragement with
these words: &quot;For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners
against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart&quot;
(Hebrews 12:3). Keep Jesus before you as an antidote against that
weariness and the resultant hopelessness of forgetting your goal.
While looking to the finish and contemplating the reward is certainly
motivating, we must never forget that the deeper motive of our &quot;doing
good.&quot; That cardinal motive of all good things must be love. Revelation
calls us to &quot;perseverance and endurance.&quot; Jesus also reminds us in his
message to the churches in the book of Revelation that perseverance and
endurance are not enough. God's Son reminded the church in Ephesus of
this truth: &quot;...you have perseverance and have endured for My name's
sake, and have not grown weary. But I have this against you, that you
have left your first love. Therefore remember from where you have
fallen, and repent and do the deeds you did at first; or else I am
coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place -- unless
you repent' (Revelation 2:3-5).
Perseverance and endurance are not enough!
When we are motivated out of guilt, competitiveness, fear, or anger, we
burn out more quickly and more completely. This is especially true when
we feel like we didn't get the &quot;big pay off&quot; for doing what we did. We
forget that such motivation is based on our power and our motives and
not God's grace and power. Like Paul, we need to be compelled by the
love of Christ -- love for Christ and love like Christ's (2 Corinthians
5:14). So &quot;not losing heart&quot; is an integral part of the journey;
however, unless it is motivated by love, &quot;it profits nothing&quot; (1
Corinthians 13:3).
Run the race with perseverance.
Run and do not lose heart.
Run in expectation of the finish.
Run always compelled by love!

Being Happy on the Job
&quot;The Lord will command the blessing on... all to which you set your
hand.&quot; -- Deuteronomy 28:8
Happiness involves feeling good about yourself. It's based on your
relationships and achievements. When your gifts and abilities are fully
developed and utilized through your life's work, you grow in confidence
and strength. Here are seven keys to being happy on the job:
1. See work as God's gift, not punishment. &quot;When God gives any man
wealth and possessions, and enables him to enjoy them, to accept his lot
and be happy in his work -- this is a gift of God&quot; (Ecclesiastes 5:19 NIV).
2. Recognize God as your true employer. &quot;Serve wholeheartedly, as if you
were serving the Lord, not men, because you know that the Lord will
reward everyone for whatever good he does&quot; (Ephesians 6:7-8 NIV).
3. Pursue work compatible with your gifts. &quot;If anyone serves, he should
do it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be
praised&quot; (1 Peter 4:11 NIV).
4. Learn everything possible about your job. &quot;Let the wise listen and
add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance&quot; (Proverbs
1:5 NIV).
5. Use criticism to your advantage. In fact, make it work for you; ask
for suggestions and correction: &quot;Poverty and shame will come to him who
disdains correction: but he who regards reproof will be honored&quot;
(Proverbs 13:18).
6. Do more than is expected of you. &quot;And whosoever compels you to go one
mile, go with him two&quot; (Matthew 5:41). Be an extra-miler!
7. Make Jesus your work partner. Stay Christ-conscious throughout the
day as you perform your duties faithfully: &quot;You will keep him in perfect
peace, whose mind is stayed on You: because he trusts in You&quot; (Isaiah
26:3).  --Word for Today

RELYING ON GOD
The following two news stories come from Reuters:  &quot;A Ukraine
businessman who bought a pager for each member of his staff as a New
Year gift was so alarmed when all 50 of them went off at the same time
that he drove his car into a lamp post.  The unnamed businessman was
returning from the pager shop when the accident happened,&quot; the Fakty
daily newspaper reported.  &quot;With no more than 100 metres to go to the
office, the 50 pagers on the back seat suddenly burst out screeching.
The businessman's fright was such that he simply let go of the steering
wheel and the car ploughed into a lamp post.  After he had assessed the
damage to the car, the businessman turned his attention to the message
on the 50 pagers.  It read: 'Congratulations on a successful purchase!' &quot;
&quot;Normally accidents like this shouldn't happen,&quot; reasoned a Caputh,
Germany, police spokesman.  &quot;A motorist following driving instructions
on the satellite navigation computer in his
BMW drove down a ferry ramp into the Havel River without realizing the
only way he could cross the river was to wait for the ferry.  The
57-year-old driver was not injured.  This sort of thing can happen when
people rely too much on technology.&quot;
We do rely a lot on technology, don't we?  From pagers and satellite
navigation systems to cell phones and fax machines, we have become more
and more dependent upon our world of technology.  It is important,
though, that we step back every now and then and remind ourselves, &quot;We
can survive without all these gadgets, but we cannot survive without God.&quot;
In Psalm 20, David expressed it this way: &quot;Some trust in chariots, and
some in horses; But we will remember the name of the LORD our God.&quot;
(Psalm 20:7)
Chariots and horses were certainly not wrong; no more so than modern
gadgets.  But it was necessary to reinforce the truth that our faith in
not in such things, but in God Almighty.
Have a great day!  --Alan Smith

Small Straws In A Soft Wind by Marsha Burns
Beloved, I see your dilemma; that you seem to be between a rock and a
hard place, but I say to you this is the time that you need to come into
My rest.  Rest in My presence, for when you have done that you know to
do then you must release the situation to Me and rely on Me for help.
Do not despair and do not be afraid, for I am with you wherever you go.
Trust Me to bring you through to complete victory, and do so in
confidence that I have heard and answered your prayers, says the Lord.
Psalms 37:7 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for Him; do not fret
because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who brings
wicked schemes to pass.

I have indeed opened a door before you.  You have been on the threshold
and have now stepped through into a new dimension.  There is no going
back, ever!  I have set before you revelation and life, life in the
Spirit.  Come through, come through the door.  Come up, come up higher.
Do not be afraid.  Do not look behind you.  Do not fall back into
remorse or regret over the things you are leaving behind because I'm
bringing you to new life, says the Lord.
Isaiah 62:10 Go through, Go through the gates! Prepare the way for the
people; build up, build up the highway! Take out the stones, lift up a
banner for the peoples!

Again, My chosen vessels, I am opening your eyes so that I can show you
how to achieve greater efficiency through establishing a higher level of
divine order in, around and through you.  Simplicity is the operative
word, for certainly you will find the supernatural wisdom necessary to
unclutter and simplify every process.  Be alert to the leading of My
Spirit as I bring you through this procedure, and rejoice in the freedom
that it brings, says the Lord.
Psalms 18:33 He makes my feet like the feet of deer, and sets me on my
high places.

I am sifting you as if to separate the wheat from the chaff in you, My
people.  I will indeed sort out and make a distinction between that
which accelerates life and order and that which brings chaos and hinders
your spiritual growth.  I alone know exactly what will prepare you to
fulfill My plans and purposes in your life, and I alone will lead, guide
and direct your steps.  Yield your will to accept what I am doing
whether you understand it or not.  I am with you for your good, and you
will bring glory to My name, says the Lord.
Luke 3:17  &quot;His winnowing fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly
clean out His threshing floor, and gather the wheat into His barn; but
the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire.&quot;

Beloved, I have set you on a fast track to fulfilling My purposes on the
earth.  Watch for the enemy to interfere with the pace that has been set
by creating complacency or laziness in you.  Resist with all your heart
this work of the devil against you.  You must not lose your momentum.
Do whatever is necessary to stay awake and alert in the spirit realm.
Yield to the working of My Spirit as I hone and fine tune your
discernment, says the Lord.
Proverbs 2: 3-5  Yes, if you cry out for discernment, and lift up your
voice for understanding, if you seek her as silver, and search for her
as for hidden treasures; then you will understand the fear of the LORD,
and find the knowledge of God.

My Heart Will Trust
I'll walk closer now
On the higher way
Through the darkest night
Will You hold my hand
Jesus guide my way
O You mourn with me
And You dance with me
For my heart of hearts
Is bound to you
Though I walk through valleys low
I'll fear no evil
By the waters still my soul
My heart will trust in You
My heart will trust in You
O You counsel me and You comfort me
When I cannot see You light my path
My heart will trust in You
My heart will trust in You

GOD'S SPECIAL GRACE
At times I feel I'm all alone
In the trials that I face.
Then Jesus whispers peace to me
And fills my life with grace.
I know how very much He loves me.
He shows that every day.
I could not go on without Him;
He leads me all the way.
It is reassuring to feel His presesnce
In each new moment of each year.
He enfolds me to His bosom
And wipes away each tear.
May I be found faithful
To the path He chose for me.
I live with that blessed hope
Until His dear face I see.
as seen in TimeWithGod

***********************************************************

But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not &quot;Yes&quot; and
&quot;No.&quot; 19For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by
me and Silas[b] and Timothy, was not &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No,&quot; but in him it has
always been &quot;Yes.&quot; 20For no matter how many promises God has made, they
are &quot;Yes&quot; in Christ. And so through him the &quot;Amen&quot; is spoken by us to
the glory of God. 21Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm
in Christ. He anointed us, 22set his seal of ownership on us, and put
his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.  2
Corinthians 1:18-22

I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the
glory that will be revealed in us.  Romans 8:18

Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about
itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.  Matthew 6:34

You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to
indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love.  Galatians
5:13

The LORD said to him, &quot;Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or
mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD ?
Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.&quot;  Exodus
4:11-12

Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business
and to work with your hands, just as we told you, so that your daily
life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be
dependent on anybody.  1 Thessalonians 4:11-12

Trust in the LORD forever, for the LORD, the LORD, is the Rock eternal.
Isaiah 26:4

&quot;TANGLED HAIR &quot;
Knoxville Airport - waiting to board the plane:  I had the Bible on my
lap and was very intent upon what I was doing. I'd had a marvelous
morning with the Lord. I say that because I want to tell you it is a
scary thing to have the Spirit of God really working in you. You could
end up doing some things you never would have done otherwise. Life in
the Spirit can be dangerous for a thousand reasons not the least of
which is your ego...
I tried to keep from staring, but he was such a strange sight.  Humped
over in a wheelchair, he was skin and bones, dressed in clothes that
obviously fit when he was at least twenty pounds heavier.  His knees
protruded from his trousers, and his shoulders looked like the coat
hanger was still in his shirt.  His hands looked like tangled masses of
veins and bones.  The strangest part of him was his hair and nails.
Stringy grey hair hung well over his shoulders and down part of his
back.  His fingernails were long.  Clean, but strangely out of place on
an old man.
I looked down at my Bible as fast as I could, discomfort burning my
face. As I tried to imagine what his story might have been, I found
myself wondering if I'd just had a Howard Hughes sighting. Then, I
remembered reading somewhere that he was dead. So this man in the
airport... an impersonator maybe? Was a camera on us somewhere?....
There I sat trying to concentrate on the Word to keep from being
concerned about a thin slice of humanity served on a wheelchair only a
few seats from me. All the while my heart was growing more and more
overwhelmed with a feeling for him. Let's admit it. Curiosity is a heap
more comfortable than true concern, and suddenly I was awash with aching
emotion for this bizarre-looking old man.  I had walked with God long
enough to see the handwriting on the wall.  I've learned that when I
begin to feel what God feels, something so contrary to my natural
feelings, something dramatic is bound to happen. And it may be embarrassing.
I immediately began to resist because I could feel God working on my
spirit and I started arguing with God in my mind.  &quot;Oh no, God please
no.&quot;  I looked up at the ceiling as if I could stare straight through it
into heaven and said, &quot;Don't make me witness to this man.  Not right
here and now. Please. 'I'll do anything. Put me on the same plane, but
don't make me get up here and witness to this man in front of this
gawking audience.  Please, Lord!&quot;...
There I sat in the blue vinyl chair begging His Highness, &quot;Please don't
make me witness to this man.  Not now.  I'll do it on the plane.&quot;  Then
I heard it...&quot;I don't want you to witness to him. I want you to brush
his hair.&quot;
The words were so clear, my heart leapt into my throat, and my thoughts
spun like a top. Do I witness to the man or brush his hair? No brainer.
I looked straight back up at the ceiling and said, &quot;God, as I live and
breathe, I want you to know I am ready to witness to this man. I'm on
this Lord. I'm you're girl!  You've never seen a woman witness to a man
faster in your life.  What difference does it make if his hair is a mess
if he is not redeemed?  I am on him. I am going to witness to this man.&quot;
Again as clearly as I've ever heard an audible word, God seemed to write
this statement across the wall of my mind.  &quot;That is not what I said,
Beth.  I don't want you to witness to him.  I want you to go brush his
hair.&quot;  I looked up at God and quipped, &quot;I don't have a hairbrush.  It's
in my suitcase on the plane, How am I suppose to brush his hair without
a hairbrush?&quot;
God was so insistent that I almost involuntarily began to walk toward
him as these thoughts came to me from God's word: &quot;I will thoroughly
finish you unto all good works.&quot; (2 Tim 3:7)  I stumbled over to the
wheelchair thinking I could use one myself.  Even as I retell this story
my pulse quickens and I feel those same butterflies. I knelt down in
front of the man, and asked as demurely as possible, &quot;Sir, may I have
the pleasure of brushing your hair?&quot;
He looked back at me and said, &quot;What did you say?&quot;  &quot;May I have the
pleasure of brushing your hair?&quot;   To which he responded in volume ten,
&quot;Little lady, if you expect me to hear you, you're going to have to talk
louder than that.  At this point, I took a deep breath and blurted out,
&quot;SIR, MAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF BRUSHING YOUR HAIR?&quot;
At which point every eye in the place darted right at me.  I was the
only thing in the room looking more peculiar than old Mr. Longlocks.
Face crimson and forehead breaking out in a sweat, I watched him look up
at me with absolute shock on his face, and say, &quot;If you really want to.&quot;
Are you kidding? Of course I didn't want to.  But God didn't seem
interested in my personal preference right about then. He pressed on my
heart until I could utter the words, &quot;Yes, sir, I would be pleased. But
I have one little problem. I don't have a hairbrush.&quot;
&quot;I have one in my bag,&quot; he responded.  I went around to the back of that
wheelchair, and I got on my hands and knees and unzipped the stranger's
old carry-on hardly believing what I was doing.  I stood up and started
brushing the old man's hair.  It was perfectly clean, but it was tangled
and matted.  I don't do many things well, but I must admit I've had
notable experience untangling knotted hair mothering two little girls.
Like I'd done with either Amanda or Melissa in such a condition, I began
brushing at the very bottom of the strands, remembering to take my time
not to pull.
A miraculous thing happened to me as I started brushing that old man's
hair. Everyone else in the room disappeared.  There was no one alive for
those moments except that old man and me.  I brushed and I brushed and I
brushed until every tangle was out of that hair.  I know this sounds so
strange but I've never felt that kind of love for another soul in my
entire life.  I believe with all my heart, I - for that few minutes -
felt a portion of the very love of God.  That He had overtaken my heart
for a little while like someone renting a room and making Himself at
home for a short while.  The emotions were so strong and so pure that I
knew they had to be God's.
His hair was finally as soft and smooth as an infant's. I slipped the
brush back in the bag, went around the chair to face him.  I got back
down on my knees, put my hands on his knees, and said, &quot;Sir, do you know
my Jesus?&quot;  He said, &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;  Well, that figures.
He explained, &quot;I've known Him since I married my bride.&quot;  &quot;She wouldn't
marry me until I got to know the Savior.&quot;  He said, &quot;You see, the
problem is, I haven't seen my bride in months.  I've had open-heart
surgery, and she's been too ill to come see me. I was sitting here
thinking to myself. What a mess I must be for my bride.&quot;
Only God knows how often He allows us to be part of a divine moment when
we're completely unaware of the significance.  This, on the other hand,
was one of those rare encounters when I knew God had intervened in
details only He could have known.  It was a God moment, and I'll never
forget it.  Our time came to board, and we were not on the same plane.
I was deeply ashamed of how I'd acted earlier and would have been so
proud to have accompanied him on that aircraft.
I still had a few minutes, and as I gathered my things to board, the
airline hostess returned from the corridor, tears streaming down her
cheeks.  She said, &quot;That old man's sitting on the plane, sobbing.  Why
did you do that? What made you do that?&quot;  I said, &quot;Do you know Jesus?
He can be the bossiest thing!&quot;  And we got to share.
I learned something about God that day.  He knows if you're exhausted
because you're hungry, you're serving in the wrong place or it is time
to move on, but you feel too responsible to budge.  He knows if you're
hurting or feeling rejected.  He knows if you're sick or drowning under
a wave of temptation.  Or He knows if you just need your hair brushed.
He sees you as an individual. Tell Him your need!
I got on my own flight, sobs choking my throat, wondering how many
opportunities just like that one had I missed along the way... all
because I didn't want people to think I was strange.  God didn't send me
to that old man. He sent that old man to me.
John 1:14 &quot;The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have
seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father,
full of grace and truth.&quot;  --Beth Moore In &quot;Further Still&quot;

Prayer for the Work Day
Almighty God, thank Thee for the job of this day. May we find gladness
in all its toil and difficulty, its pleasure and success, and even in
its failure and sorrow. We would look always away from ourselves, and
behold the glory and the need of the world that we may have the will and
the strength to bring the gift of gladness to others; that with them we
stand to bear the burden and heat of the day and offer Thee the praise
of work well done. Amen.  --Bishop Charles Lewis Slattery

Read Through The Bible
Genesis 50
1 Joseph threw himself upon his father and wept over him and kissed him.
2 Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his
father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him, 3 taking a full forty
days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians
mourned for him seventy days. 4 When the days of mourning had passed,
Joseph said to Pharaoh's court, &quot;If I have found favor in your eyes,
speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him, 5 'My father made me swear an oath
and said, &quot;I am about to die; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in
the land of Canaan.&quot; Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will
return.' &quot; 6 Pharaoh said, &quot;Go up and bury your father, as he made you
swear to do.&quot; 7 So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh's
officials accompanied him---the dignitaries of his court and all the
dignitaries of Egypt- 8 besides all the members of Joseph's household
and his brothers and those belonging to his father's household. Only
their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen. 9
Chariots and horsemen also went up with him. It was a very large
company. 10 When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the
Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph observed a
seven-day period of mourning for his father. 11 When the Canaanites who
lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said,
&quot;The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning.&quot; That is why
that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim. 12 So Jacob's sons
did as he had commanded them: 13 They carried him to the land of Canaan
and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which
Abraham had bought as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite, along with
the field. 14 After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt,
together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to
bury his father.
Joseph Reassures His Brothers
15 When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said,
&quot;What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the
wrongs we did to him?&quot; 16 So they sent word to Joseph, saying, &quot;Your
father left these instructions before he died: 17 'This is what you are
to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the
wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.' Now please forgive the
sins of the servants of the God of your father.&quot; When their message came
to him, Joseph wept. 18 His brothers then came and threw themselves down
before him. &quot;We are your slaves,&quot; they said. 19 But Joseph said to them,
&quot;Don't be afraid. Am I in the place of God? 20 You intended to harm me,
but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the
saving of many lives. 21 So then, don't be afraid. I will provide for
you and your children.&quot; And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them.
The Death of Joseph
22 Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father's family. He lived
a hundred and ten years 23 and saw the third generation of Ephraim's
children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at
birth on Joseph's knees. 24 Then Joseph said to his brothers, &quot;I am
about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out
of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob.&quot; 25 And Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath and said,
&quot;God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up
from this place.&quot; 26 So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And
after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.

O precious and righteous Father, I need your help to learn to slow down
and tend to my own responsibilities instead of running around out of
control and without purpose. Please grant me not only the wisdom that I
have been praying for, but also the patience and quietude that I need
for that wisdom to change my heart and mind.  In Jesus' name I ask it. Amen.

Wherever you are in life, whatever you've done, you can begin again. If
you do not have Jesus in your life and wish to ask Jesus into your life
