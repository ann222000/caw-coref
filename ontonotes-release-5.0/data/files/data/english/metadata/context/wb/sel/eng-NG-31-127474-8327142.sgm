Hello! I'm new to the board and am going to be posting for awhile,
hopefully we can both learn from each other about the nature of
theology and moral philosophy.

I wanted to make a post to explain to people why I am a Christian and
why faith is a good thing. I see a lot of posts here about faith being
bad because some people use it to do bad things. Well, nothing can be
further from the truth. Faith leads us to do good works, to care for
the sick, and to rehabilitate the convicted. It leads us to a fuller
relationship with ourselves because we're more aware of our
limitations. And most importantly, it allows us to enter God's grace.

To enter God's grace, rationality can only take us so far. We must
then trust in God and make the &quot;leap of faith&quot; in order to trust in
Him and receive the fullest blessings in life. Kierkegaard, in 1844,
argued that such a leap is necessary for us to accept Christianity.
Reason is unable to pursue this argument, it's quarry venturing into
the realm where reason fails and does not apply.

Many disagree with this, and that rationality is sufficient to
understand God. For instance, C.S. Lewis argued that the supernatural
must exist to explain our ability to reason. He argues that the
universe is so precisely tuned to allow humans the ability to ponder
our own existence, it cannot be possible by pure chance. While this
argument is convincing to many, I personally see the flaws, that
perhaps it DID happen by pure chance. There is a principle in science
called the &quot;anthropic principle&quot; that &quot;we should take account of the
constraints that our existence as observers imposes on the sort of
universe that we could observe&quot;. That is, since we're here to discuss
the question at all, conditions must be such to allow us to do this,
because we're already here. It could have come about through pure
luck. It's not distinguishable from the work of God. And this is why
we must resort to the leap of faith to understand God.

Countless tales of those that have accepted faith in their hearts are
told over the centuries. Can they be all wrong? This is a personal
choice we all must make, to take the leap of faith, receiving the
blessings in life, or to remain afraid and ashamed of ourselves,
thinking we are not worthy to make such a leap. But we are all worthy
and in need of such a leap. I am here to testify that this is true.

Well, you lost credibility right there, because there are recorded
instances of Christians doing bad things using faith.  Crusades, The
Inquisition, persecuting atheists...any of these ring a bell?

Now, you can deny these being bad things using faith, or you can be
honest.

You have one chance to show yourself capable of honesty.  Do not waste
it by rationalizing the &quot;bad things&quot;.

If that is true, why do so many claim that in the final day what we
believe in will be the test for eternal damnation or joy?
Does it seem fair to you to judge a man according to things he can't

Also, if a great leap is needed, how come each time in the Bible God
wanted something, he also performed miracles to prove his existence?

Actually, fear and shame are not the reasons I don't take this leap.
I don't take this leap because I don't find any reason, even not an
intuitive reason to believe the truth is beyond that jump.
The &quot;leap of faith&quot; is just a nice way of saying &quot;if you ignore logic,
you might believe it is real&quot;, but this is true to ANY faith, and
religion.

It leads some to do these, even to an extraordinary extent as in the

A leap of faith is necessary for you to accept any religion. The

require leaps of faith.

A couple of things.

(1) Proslogion or Proslogium or whatever your name is ... I'm guessing
your name is a referrence to Anselm's work.  If so, please recognise
Anselm was writing to convince christocrotheists that their
brainwashing was good.  So I'm guessing from post one that you're a
ϑ'rd.  Please, feel free to show me that you are not.

(2) you wrote &quot;I see a lot of posts here about faith being bad because
some people use it to do bad things. Well, nothing can be further from
the truth.&quot;  There you go, you made it to your third sentence and
you're already spinning shit.  Try googling &quot;bootcamp jesus dragging&quot;
and see what 'backsliding' really means.

However, first of all, faith is not NECESSARY to do these things...
people can do good works, care for the sick, and rehabilitate the
convicted without resorting to a need for the supernatural. They are
beneficial in their own right because they better our species.

Second of all, faith doesn't ALWAYS lead to good things. It can also
lead to horrific things. How do you tell one person that their
unreasoned motivations for their actions are good, and tell another
that their unreasoned motivations for their actions is bad. It's
hypocritical and a falsehood. And there is no way to distinguish
between the two cases. Sometimes faith happens to lead to the same
conclusions as our humanism dictates. But that doesn't make it okay.

Exactly the point. There is no REASON to leap into any particular
faith. Why is a leap into Christianity better than a leap into
fundamentalist Islam? You'll tell me that fundamentalist Islam is bad
and tells you to do bad things. But how do you know that? Because of

&gt; Now, you can deny these being bad things using faith, or you can be

&gt; You have one chance to show yourself capable of honesty.  Do not waste

No, those things are horrible. But they misconstrue the message of
faith... to get closer to God. God is loving and wants us to be happy.
God doesn't want us to kill each other (especially not in His name!).
You see, God's message is one of peace, love, and forgiveness. The
abominations that occur in His name are a blight on the rest of us.

&gt; &gt; the sick, and to rehabilitate the convicted. It leads us to a fuller
&gt; &gt; relationship with ourselves because we're more aware of our
&gt; &gt; limitations. And most importantly, it allows us to enter God's grace.

&gt; I'm guessing that if you do all this stuff you mention here, you'd
&gt; still do it even without faith that God exists.

&gt; &gt; To enter God's grace, rationality can only take us so far. We must
&gt; &gt; then trust in God and make the &quot;leap of faith&quot; in order to trust in
&gt; &gt; Him and receive the fullest blessings in life. Kierkegaard, in 1844,
&gt; &gt; argued that such a leap is necessary for us to accept Christianity.
&gt; &gt; Reason is unable to pursue this argument, it's quarry venturing into
&gt; &gt; the realm where reason fails and does not apply.

&gt; If that is true, why do so many claim that in the final day what we
&gt; believe in will be the test for eternal damnation or joy?
&gt; Does it seem fair to you to judge a man according to things he can't
&gt; confirm?
&gt; Also, if a great leap is needed, how come each time in the Bible God
&gt; wanted something, he also performed miracles to prove his existence?

&gt; &gt; Many disagree with this, and that rationality is sufficient to
&gt; &gt; understand God. For instance, C.S. Lewis argued that the supernatural
&gt; &gt; must exist to explain our ability to reason. He argues that the
&gt; &gt; universe is so precisely tuned to allow humans the ability to ponder
&gt; &gt; our own existence, it cannot be possible by pure chance. While this
&gt; &gt; argument is convincing to many, I personally see the flaws, that
&gt; &gt; perhaps it DID happen by pure chance. There is a principle in science
&gt; &gt; called the &quot;anthropic principle&quot; that &quot;we should take account of the
&gt; &gt; constraints that our existence as observers imposes on the sort of
&gt; &gt; universe that we could observe&quot;. That is, since we're here to discuss
&gt; &gt; the question at all, conditions must be such to allow us to do this,
&gt; &gt; because we're already here. It could have come about through pure
&gt; &gt; luck. It's not distinguishable from the work of God. And this is why
&gt; &gt; we must resort to the leap of faith to understand God.

&gt; &gt; Countless tales of those that have accepted faith in their hearts are
&gt; &gt; told over the centuries. Can they be all wrong?

&gt; Yes.
&gt; We don't doubt Christianity (or Theism in general) is popular, we
&gt; doubt it's true.

&gt; &gt; This is a personal
&gt; &gt; choice we all must make, to take the leap of faith, receiving the
&gt; &gt; blessings in life, or to remain afraid and ashamed of ourselves,
&gt; &gt; thinking we are not worthy to make such a leap. But we are all worthy
&gt; &gt; and in need of such a leap. I am here to testify that this is true.

&gt; Actually, fear and shame are not the reasons I don't take this leap.
&gt; I don't take this leap because I don't find any reason, even not an
&gt; intuitive reason to believe the truth is beyond that jump.
&gt; The &quot;leap of faith&quot; is just a nice way of saying &quot;if you ignore logic,
&gt; you might believe it is real&quot;, but this is true to ANY faith, and
&gt; religion.
">

Yes, I suppose you're right that it doesn't require faith to do good
works, but the faith gives meaning to the good works. Otherwise, why
do them?

I also suppose you could construe the leap of faith as ignoring logic.
But that misses the point. The point is that the faith that one
attains makes that person complete, and whole in the eyes of the Lord.
The Lord wants us all to love Him, because He loves us. So without
acknowledging the love of God, we have no meaning in our lives. I
don't like to think that our lives have no meaning.

&gt; It leads some to do these, even to an extraordinary extent as in the

&gt; &gt; Kierkegaard, in 1844,
&gt; &gt; argued that such a leap is necessary for us to accept Christianity.

&gt; A leap of faith is necessary for you to accept any religion. The

&gt; require leaps of faith.

&gt; &gt; Countless tales of those that have accepted faith in their hearts are

&gt; Since we can see people accepting faith today, there's no reason to
&gt; disbelieve tales that people have accepted faith over the centuries.
">

As I've mentioned to Simpleton, the abominations of faith that people
do in spite of God's will are a horrible blight on us. I certainly
hope that God's true love finds them and gives them hope and the
courage to make the right decisions. George W. Bush is a person of
immense faith, I'm sure that if God told him that he should go to war
with Iraq that there must have been a good reason. I'll ask you... has
there been a nuclear attack from Iraq? No. Would there have been if we
didn't go in? Maybe, if our intelligence reports were true. So isn't
it better to err on the side of safety?

Oooo, you're good! I was hoping someone would catch the reference in
my name. I have been greatly influenced by Anselm's work, and the work
of other apologists.

I have heard about the &quot;Jesus camp&quot; incident. I hope those people are
judged to the fullest of God's vengeance. God's will is not for us to
intimidate each other and commit horrific acts of unspeakable
violence, but to love each other and understand each other. That is my
point, that when we have faith, we experience God's love and without
God's love our lives are empty and devoid of meaning.

&gt; Welcome.

&gt; &gt; I wanted to make a post to explain to people why I am a Christian and
&gt; &gt; why faith is a good thing. I see a lot of posts here about faith being
&gt; &gt; bad because some people use it to do bad things. Well, nothing can be
&gt; &gt; further from the truth. Faith leads us to do good works, to care for
&gt; &gt; the sick, and to rehabilitate the convicted.

&gt; However, first of all, faith is not NECESSARY to do these things...
&gt; people can do good works, care for the sick, and rehabilitate the
&gt; convicted without resorting to a need for the supernatural. They are
&gt; beneficial in their own right because they better our species.

&gt; Second of all, faith doesn't ALWAYS lead to good things. It can also
&gt; lead to horrific things. How do you tell one person that their
&gt; unreasoned motivations for their actions are good, and tell another
&gt; that their unreasoned motivations for their actions is bad. It's
&gt; hypocritical and a falsehood. And there is no way to distinguish
&gt; between the two cases. Sometimes faith happens to lead to the same
&gt; conclusions as our humanism dictates. But that doesn't make it okay.

&gt; &gt; It leads us to a fuller
&gt; &gt; relationship with ourselves because we're more aware of our
&gt; &gt; limitations.

&gt; Also doesn't require the supernatural.

&gt; &gt; And most importantly, it allows us to enter God's grace.

&gt; There is no evidence for God and no demonstrated need for God's grace.
&gt; People get along without it just fine.

&gt; &gt; To enter God's grace, rationality can only take us so far. We must
&gt; &gt; then trust in God and make the &quot;leap of faith&quot; in order to trust in

&gt; &gt; Reason is unable to pursue this argument, it's quarry venturing into
&gt; &gt; the realm where reason fails and does not apply.

&gt; Exactly the point. There is no REASON to leap into any particular
&gt; faith. Why is a leap into Christianity better than a leap into
&gt; fundamentalist Islam? You'll tell me that fundamentalist Islam is bad
&gt; and tells you to do bad things. But how do you know that? Because of
&gt; application of reason and humanism to the situation.

&gt; &gt; Many disagree with this, and that rationality is sufficient to

&gt; &gt; we must resort to the leap of faith to understand God.

&gt; Yes, this is true... there is no demonstrated need for God,
&gt; teleologically, ontologically, or cosmologically.

&gt; &gt; Countless tales of those that have accepted faith in their hearts are
&gt; &gt; told over the centuries.

&gt; The same can be said for other faiths. And also for other horrific
&gt; acts of violence.

&gt; &gt; Can they be all wrong?

&gt; Yes.

&gt; &gt; This is a personal
&gt; &gt; choice we all must make, to take the leap of faith, receiving the
&gt; &gt; blessings in life, or to remain afraid and ashamed of ourselves,

&gt; Most people aren't afraid. They just feel it's unnecssary to do so
&gt; because there is no demonstrated need.

&gt; &gt; But we are all worthy

&gt; You don't know this is true, and can't demonstrate it's use at all.

Thank you for welcoming me, I appreciate it.

I think you're missing the point here. Without faith in God, our lives
are empty. There is no meaning to them if we do not have God's love.
We take the leap of faith because otherwise our lives are devoid. The
fullest happiness we can have is to bask in the glory of God's love. I
suppose good works are possible without believing in God, but those
good works are meaningless without God! God gives us love and life,
and to experience all of love and life, we must recognize this.

I suppose you're right that there is no demonstrated need, but it's
like trying a new food... you won't know whether you like it unless
you try it! You could be missing out on something that is delicious.
And in this case, you're missing out on something that fulfills our

of faith. Really, I can't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; hopefully we can both learn from each other about the nature of
&gt; &gt; &gt; theology and moral philosophy.

&gt; &gt; Are you _really_ going to stick around? Why do I doubt this?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I wanted to make a post to explain to people why I am a Christian and
&gt; &gt; &gt; why faith is a good thing. I see a lot of posts here about faith being
&gt; &gt; &gt; bad because some people use it to do bad things. Well, nothing can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; further from the truth. Faith leads us to do good works, to care for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the sick, and to rehabilitate the convicted.

&gt; &gt; If theists are great people why would they need it? Yeah, I'm sure
&gt; &gt; faith has caused some people to do good things. But do the pros
&gt; &gt; outweigh the cons? Not a chance.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It leads us to a fuller
&gt; &gt; &gt; relationship with ourselves because we're more aware of our
&gt; &gt; &gt; limitations.

&gt; &gt; That just isn't true. Faith takes you into your delusions and that is
&gt; &gt; all. Delusions seperate you from other parts of yourself.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And most importantly, it allows us to enter God's grace.

&gt; &gt; And here's the meat of any theist post: completely unsubstantiated
&gt; &gt; assertions. The crappy attempts at logic are the icing, and the big
&gt; &gt; nothing blah blah assertions are the cake.

&gt; This about sums everything up quite nicely. There's nothing
&gt; substantiated proslogion's post. There really is no justification to
&gt; make a leap of faith. There's no need, and it can lead to disastrous
&gt; consequences.

&gt; &gt; &gt; To enter God's grace, rationality can only take us so far.

&gt; &gt; Correct. It can take you right up to something stupid, then it fails.
&gt; &gt; Stupid rationality, failing when you come across something stupid.
&gt; &gt; Grrrr.

&gt; &gt; &gt; We must
&gt; &gt; &gt; then trust in God and make the &quot;leap of faith&quot; in order to trust in
&gt; &gt; &gt; Him and receive the fullest blessings in life.

&gt; &gt; More cake.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Kierkegaard, in 1844,
&gt; &gt; &gt; argued that such a leap is necessary for us to accept Christianity.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Reason is unable to pursue this argument, it's quarry venturing into
&gt; &gt; &gt; the realm where reason fails and does not apply.

&gt; &gt; Reason does not apply to the completely unreasonable. Take this,
&gt; &gt; reason: raping babies will make Martian Jesus come back!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Many disagree with this, and that rationality is sufficient to
&gt; &gt; &gt; understand God. For instance, C.S. Lewis argued that the supernatural
&gt; &gt; &gt; must exist to explain our ability to reason. He argues that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; universe is so precisely tuned to allow humans the ability to ponder
&gt; &gt; &gt; our own existence, it cannot be possible by pure chance.

&gt; &gt; Oh, you have so much to _learn_ man. The whole concept of the
&gt; &gt; &quot;supernatural&quot; is that we can't explain shit, and yet here you are
&gt; &gt; trying to explain it. There is no &quot;supernatural&quot; that is
&gt; &gt; substantiated. It's just a term for made up crap that explains shit
&gt; &gt; that people don't understand. There is no evidence for anything
&gt; &gt; &quot;supernatural&quot; because if something can be verified it is a part of
&gt; &gt; nature, not &quot;suuuupernature!&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; While this
&gt; &gt; &gt; argument is convincing to many, I personally see the flaws, that
&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps it DID happen by pure chance.

&gt; &gt; Maybe _God_ happened by pure chance. Wheeeee.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a principle in science
&gt; &gt; &gt; called the &quot;anthropic principle&quot; that &quot;we should take account of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; constraints that our existence as observers imposes on the sort of
&gt; &gt; &gt; universe that we could observe&quot;. That is, since we're here to discuss
&gt; &gt; &gt; the question at all, conditions must be such to allow us to do this,
&gt; &gt; &gt; because we're already here. It could have come about through pure
&gt; &gt; &gt; luck. It's not distinguishable from the work of God. And this is why
&gt; &gt; &gt; we must resort to the leap of faith to understand God.

&gt; &gt; Atheists don't usually believe in luck, or fate, or whatever. They
&gt; &gt; just believe in learning what we don't understand honestly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Countless tales of those that have accepted faith in their hearts are
&gt; &gt; &gt; told over the centuries.

&gt; &gt; Heil Hitler! Osama Bin Laden is really great, too!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Can they be all wrong?

&gt; &gt; Of course. Why could they _not_ all be wrong? One reason why it's
&gt; &gt; impossible--sock it to me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a personal
&gt; &gt; &gt; choice we all must make, to take the leap of faith, receiving the
&gt; &gt; &gt; blessings in life, or to remain afraid and ashamed of ourselves,

&gt; &gt; If you weren't afraid you wouldn't be a theist. You _should_ be
&gt; &gt; ashamed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking we are not worthy to make such a leap. But we are all worthy
&gt; &gt; &gt; and in need of such a leap. I am here to testify that this is true.

&gt; &gt; Good goddamned luck.

&gt; &gt; A leap of faith is necessary for you to accept any religion. The

&gt; &gt; require leaps of faith.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Countless tales of those that have accepted faith in their hearts are

&gt; &gt; Since we can see people accepting faith today, there's no reason to
&gt; &gt; disbelieve tales that people have accepted faith over the centuries.

&gt; As I've mentioned to Simpleton, the abominations of faith that people
&gt; do in spite of God's will are a horrible blight on us. I certainly
&gt; hope that God's true love finds them and gives them hope and the

Abominations of faith are caused by faith, so they are a horrible
blight on faith, not a horrible blight on us. Abominations are
committed by people who think they are doing God's will. Saul's
soldiers killed babies because they had faith that God issued such
orders to Samuel. Without faith (if they had found that Samuel was
just making it up), would they have engaged in such killing?

&gt; &gt; Does it seem fair to you to judge a man according to things he can't
&gt; &gt; confirm?
&gt; &gt; Also, if a great leap is needed, how come each time in the Bible God

&gt; &gt; &gt; Many disagree with this, and that rationality is sufficient to

&gt; &gt; Yes.
&gt; &gt; We don't doubt Christianity (or Theism in general) is popular, we

&gt; &gt; &gt; and in need of such a leap. I am here to testify that this is true.

&gt; &gt; Actually, fear and shame are not the reasons I don't take this leap.
&gt; &gt; I don't take this leap because I don't find any reason, even not an
&gt; &gt; intuitive reason to believe the truth is beyond that jump.
&gt; &gt; The &quot;leap of faith&quot; is just a nice way of saying &quot;if you ignore logic,
&gt; &gt; you might believe it is real&quot;, but this is true to ANY faith, and
&gt; &gt; religion.

&gt; Yes, I suppose you're right that it doesn't require faith to do good
&gt; works, but the faith gives meaning to the good works. Otherwise, why
&gt; do them?

you to be good. You get promises of reward, and threats of punishment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I also suppose you could construe the leap of faith as ignoring logic.
&gt; But that misses the point. The point is that the faith that one

&gt; acknowledging the love of God, we have no meaning in our lives. I

But the need for the meaning of life from God, can come only AFTER the
leap of faith.
Without faith in God, there is also no faith that there is an
objective ultimate goal and that it's the only way to define a meaning

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello! I'm new to the board and am going to be posting for awhile,
&gt; &gt; &gt; hopefully we can both learn from each other about the nature of
&gt; &gt; &gt; theology and moral philosophy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I wanted to make a post to explain to people why I am a Christian and
&gt; &gt; &gt; why faith is a good thing. I see a lot of posts here about faith being
&gt; &gt; &gt; bad because some people use it to do bad things. Well, nothing can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; further from the truth. Faith leads us to do good works, to care for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the sick, and to rehabilitate the convicted.

&gt; &gt; It leads some to do these, even to an extraordinary extent as in the
&gt; &gt; case of Father Damien. It leads others to do other things. Dubya says
&gt; &gt; faith led him into war. Has he also done good works, cared for the
&gt; &gt; sick and rehabilitated the convicted?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Kierkegaard, in 1844,
&gt; &gt; &gt; argued that such a leap is necessary for us to accept Christianity.

&gt; &gt; A leap of faith is necessary for you to accept any religion. The
&gt; &gt; religion might be Buddhism, Christianity or Moloch worship; they all
&gt; &gt; require leaps of faith.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Countless tales of those that have accepted faith in their hearts are
&gt; &gt; &gt; told over the centuries. Can they be all wrong?

&gt; &gt; Since we can see people accepting faith today, there's no reason to
&gt; &gt; disbelieve tales that people have accepted faith over the centuries.

&gt; As I've mentioned to Simpleton, the abominations of faith that people
&gt; do in spite of God's will are a horrible blight on us. I certainly
&gt; hope that God's true love finds them and gives them hope and the

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello! I'm new to the board and am going to be posting for awhile,
&gt; &gt; &gt; hopefully we can both learn from each other about the nature of
&gt; &gt; &gt; theology and moral philosophy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I wanted to make a post to explain to people why I am a Christian and
&gt; &gt; &gt; why faith is a good thing. I see a lot of posts here about faith being
&gt; &gt; &gt; bad because some people use it to do bad things. Well, nothing can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; further from the truth. Faith leads us to do good works, to care for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the sick, and to rehabilitate the convicted. It leads us to a fuller
&gt; &gt; &gt; relationship with ourselves because we're more aware of our
&gt; &gt; &gt; limitations. And most importantly, it allows us to enter God's grace.

&gt; &gt; I'm guessing that if you do all this stuff you mention here, you'd
&gt; &gt; still do it even without faith that God exists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; To enter God's grace, rationality can only take us so far. We must
&gt; &gt; &gt; then trust in God and make the &quot;leap of faith&quot; in order to trust in
&gt; &gt; &gt; Him and receive the fullest blessings in life. Kierkegaard, in 1844,
&gt; &gt; &gt; argued that such a leap is necessary for us to accept Christianity.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Reason is unable to pursue this argument, it's quarry venturing into
&gt; &gt; &gt; the realm where reason fails and does not apply.

&gt; &gt; If that is true, why do so many claim that in the final day what we
&gt; &gt; believe in will be the test for eternal damnation or joy?
&gt; &gt; Does it seem fair to you to judge a man according to things he can't
&gt; &gt; confirm?
&gt; &gt; Also, if a great leap is needed, how come each time in the Bible God
&gt; &gt; wanted something, he also performed miracles to prove his existence?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Many disagree with this, and that rationality is sufficient to
&gt; &gt; &gt; understand God. For instance, C.S. Lewis argued that the supernatural
&gt; &gt; &gt; must exist to explain our ability to reason. He argues that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; universe is so precisely tuned to allow humans the ability to ponder
&gt; &gt; &gt; our own existence, it cannot be possible by pure chance. While this
&gt; &gt; &gt; argument is convincing to many, I personally see the flaws, that
&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps it DID happen by pure chance. There is a principle in science
&gt; &gt; &gt; called the &quot;anthropic principle&quot; that &quot;we should take account of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; constraints that our existence as observers imposes on the sort of
&gt; &gt; &gt; universe that we could observe&quot;. That is, since we're here to discuss
&gt; &gt; &gt; the question at all, conditions must be such to allow us to do this,
&gt; &gt; &gt; because we're already here. It could have come about through pure
&gt; &gt; &gt; luck. It's not distinguishable from the work of God. And this is why
&gt; &gt; &gt; we must resort to the leap of faith to understand God.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Countless tales of those that have accepted faith in their hearts are
&gt; &gt; &gt; told over the centuries. Can they be all wrong?

&gt; &gt; Yes.
&gt; &gt; We don't doubt Christianity (or Theism in general) is popular, we
&gt; &gt; doubt it's true.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a personal
&gt; &gt; &gt; choice we all must make, to take the leap of faith, receiving the
&gt; &gt; &gt; blessings in life, or to remain afraid and ashamed of ourselves,
&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking we are not worthy to make such a leap. But we are all worthy
&gt; &gt; &gt; and in need of such a leap. I am here to testify that this is true.

&gt; &gt; Actually, fear and shame are not the reasons I don't take this leap.
&gt; &gt; I don't take this leap because I don't find any reason, even not an
&gt; &gt; intuitive reason to believe the truth is beyond that jump.
&gt; &gt; The &quot;leap of faith&quot; is just a nice way of saying &quot;if you ignore logic,
&gt; &gt; you might believe it is real&quot;, but this is true to ANY faith, and
&gt; &gt; religion.

&gt; Yes, I suppose you're right that it doesn't require faith to do good
&gt; works, but the faith gives meaning to the good works. Otherwise, why
&gt; do them?

&gt; I also suppose you could construe the leap of faith as ignoring logic.
&gt; But that misses the point. The point is that the faith that one
&gt; attains makes that person complete, and whole in the eyes of the Lord.
&gt; The Lord wants us all to love Him, because He loves us. So without
&gt; acknowledging the love of God, we have no meaning in our lives. I
&gt; don't like to think that our lives have no meaning.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; Well, you lost credibility right there, because there are recorded

&gt; &gt; Now, you can deny these being bad things using faith, or you can be
&gt; &gt; honest.

&gt; &gt; You have one chance to show yourself capable of honesty.  Do not waste
&gt; &gt; it by rationalizing the &quot;bad things&quot;.

&gt; No, those things are horrible. But they misconstrue the message of
&gt; faith... to get closer to God. God is loving and wants us to be happy.
&gt; God doesn't want us to kill each other (especially not in His name!).
&gt; You see, God's message is one of peace, love, and forgiveness. The
&gt; abominations that occur in His name are a blight on the rest of us.

The point is, you cannot distinguish who's &quot;faith&quot; is right based on
anything that &quot;faith&quot; has to offer... you must apply reason, and in
that case, what point is faith have to begin with?

&gt; &gt; Welcome.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I wanted to make a post to explain to people why I am a Christian and
&gt; &gt; &gt; why faith is a good thing. I see a lot of posts here about faith being
&gt; &gt; &gt; bad because some people use it to do bad things. Well, nothing can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; further from the truth. Faith leads us to do good works, to care for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the sick, and to rehabilitate the convicted.

&gt; &gt; However, first of all, faith is not NECESSARY to do these things...
&gt; &gt; people can do good works, care for the sick, and rehabilitate the
&gt; &gt; convicted without resorting to a need for the supernatural. They are
&gt; &gt; beneficial in their own right because they better our species.

&gt; &gt; Second of all, faith doesn't ALWAYS lead to good things. It can also
&gt; &gt; lead to horrific things. How do you tell one person that their
&gt; &gt; unreasoned motivations for their actions are good, and tell another
&gt; &gt; that their unreasoned motivations for their actions is bad. It's
&gt; &gt; hypocritical and a falsehood. And there is no way to distinguish
&gt; &gt; between the two cases. Sometimes faith happens to lead to the same
&gt; &gt; conclusions as our humanism dictates. But that doesn't make it okay.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It leads us to a fuller
&gt; &gt; &gt; relationship with ourselves because we're more aware of our
&gt; &gt; &gt; limitations.

&gt; &gt; Also doesn't require the supernatural.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And most importantly, it allows us to enter God's grace.

&gt; &gt; There is no evidence for God and no demonstrated need for God's grace.
&gt; &gt; People get along without it just fine.

&gt; &gt; &gt; To enter God's grace, rationality can only take us so far. We must
&gt; &gt; &gt; then trust in God and make the &quot;leap of faith&quot; in order to trust in
&gt; &gt; &gt; Him and receive the fullest blessings in life. Kierkegaard, in 1844,
&gt; &gt; &gt; argued that such a leap is necessary for us to accept Christianity.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Reason is unable to pursue this argument, it's quarry venturing into
&gt; &gt; &gt; the realm where reason fails and does not apply.

&gt; &gt; Exactly the point. There is no REASON to leap into any particular
&gt; &gt; faith. Why is a leap into Christianity better than a leap into
&gt; &gt; fundamentalist Islam? You'll tell me that fundamentalist Islam is bad
&gt; &gt; and tells you to do bad things. But how do you know that? Because of
&gt; &gt; application of reason and humanism to the situation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Many disagree with this, and that rationality is sufficient to
&gt; &gt; &gt; understand God. For instance, C.S. Lewis argued that the supernatural
&gt; &gt; &gt; must exist to explain our ability to reason. He argues that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; universe is so precisely tuned to allow humans the ability to ponder
&gt; &gt; &gt; our own existence, it cannot be possible by pure chance. While this
&gt; &gt; &gt; argument is convincing to many, I personally see the flaws, that

&gt; &gt; &gt; luck. It's not distinguishable from the work of God. And this is why
&gt; &gt; &gt; we must resort to the leap of faith to understand God.

&gt; &gt; Yes, this is true... there is no demonstrated need for God,
&gt; &gt; teleologically, ontologically, or cosmologically.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Countless tales of those that have accepted faith in their hearts are
&gt; &gt; &gt; told over the centuries.

&gt; &gt; The same can be said for other faiths. And also for other horrific
&gt; &gt; acts of violence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Can they be all wrong?

&gt; &gt; Yes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a personal
&gt; &gt; &gt; choice we all must make, to take the leap of faith, receiving the
&gt; &gt; &gt; blessings in life, or to remain afraid and ashamed of ourselves,
&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking we are not worthy to make such a leap.

&gt; &gt; Most people aren't afraid. They just feel it's unnecssary to do so
&gt; &gt; because there is no demonstrated need.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But we are all worthy
&gt; &gt; &gt; and in need of such a leap. I am here to testify that this is true.

&gt; &gt; You don't know this is true, and can't demonstrate it's use at all.

&gt; Thank you for welcoming me, I appreciate it.

&gt; I think you're missing the point here. Without faith in God, our lives
&gt; are empty. There is no meaning to them if we do not have God's love.
&gt; We take the leap of faith because otherwise our lives are devoid. The
&gt; fullest happiness we can have is to bask in the glory of God's love. I
&gt; suppose good works are possible without believing in God, but those
&gt; good works are meaningless without God! God gives us love and life,
&gt; and to experience all of love and life, we must recognize this.- Hide quoted text -

Ultimately you're not actually saying anything other than &quot;have faith
because.... just because!&quot; People's lives seem to be fine without
divine intervention. What reason can one give to bother with assuming
it's true?

&gt; &gt; If theists are great people why would they need it? Yeah, I'm sure
&gt; &gt; faith has caused some people to do good things. But do the pros
&gt; &gt; outweigh the cons? Not a chance.

&gt; I disagree. I think that a world without faith would be empty of
&gt; meaning... what's left in the world if we don't have a purpose? What
&gt; kind of world would we live in?

&gt; &gt; &gt; It leads us to a fuller
&gt; &gt; &gt; relationship with ourselves because we're more aware of our
&gt; &gt; &gt; limitations.

&gt; &gt; That just isn't true. Faith takes you into your delusions and that is
&gt; &gt; all. Delusions seperate you from other parts of yourself.

&gt; Well, you call it a delusion, but that means you know it's false. You
&gt; don't know it's false. So it's faith!

&gt; &gt; &gt; And most importantly, it allows us to enter God's grace.

&gt; &gt; And here's the meat of any theist post: completely unsubstantiated
&gt; &gt; assertions. The crappy attempts at logic are the icing, and the big
&gt; &gt; nothing blah blah assertions are the cake.

&gt; God's grace is not an assertion. Jesus came to earth to save us from
&gt; sin and told us this in person. Why wouldn't we believe Him?

&gt; &gt; &gt; To enter God's grace, rationality can only take us so far.

&gt; &gt; Correct. It can take you right up to something stupid, then it fails.
&gt; &gt; Stupid rationality, failing when you come across something stupid.
&gt; &gt; Grrrr.

&gt; Yes, but it doesn't ONLY take us into things that are stupid. More
&gt; often than not, it takes us into benefits for us.

&gt; &gt; &gt; We must
&gt; &gt; &gt; then trust in God and make the &quot;leap of faith&quot; in order to trust in
&gt; &gt; &gt; Him and receive the fullest blessings in life.

&gt; &gt; Reason does not apply to the completely unreasonable. Take this,
&gt; &gt; reason: raping babies will make Martian Jesus come back!

&gt; I don't understand what you mean.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Many disagree with this, and that rationality is sufficient to

&gt; &gt; &gt; our own existence, it cannot be possible by pure chance.

&gt; &gt; Oh, you have so much to _learn_ man. The whole concept of the
&gt; &gt; &quot;supernatural&quot; is that we can't explain shit, and yet here you are
&gt; &gt; trying to explain it. There is no &quot;supernatural&quot; that is
&gt; &gt; substantiated. It's just a term for made up crap that explains shit
&gt; &gt; that people don't understand. There is no evidence for anything
&gt; &gt; &quot;supernatural&quot; because if something can be verified it is a part of
&gt; &gt; nature, not &quot;suuuupernature!&quot;.

&gt; I'm not trying to explain the supernatural, I'm saying exactly the
&gt; opposite! That we can't explain the supernatural, so we must just
&gt; trust in what God wills us to do. It's part of God's plan, you see. We
&gt; must have faith to experience the fullness of God's love!

&gt; &gt; &gt; While this
&gt; &gt; &gt; argument is convincing to many, I personally see the flaws, that
&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps it DID happen by pure chance.

&gt; &gt; Maybe _God_ happened by pure chance. Wheeeee.

&gt; God is eternal. God is the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the
&gt; last.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a principle in science
&gt; &gt; &gt; called the &quot;anthropic principle&quot; that &quot;we should take account of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; constraints that our existence as observers imposes on the sort of
&gt; &gt; &gt; universe that we could observe&quot;. That is, since we're here to discuss
&gt; &gt; &gt; the question at all, conditions must be such to allow us to do this,
&gt; &gt; &gt; because we're already here. It could have come about through pure
&gt; &gt; &gt; luck. It's not distinguishable from the work of God. And this is why
&gt; &gt; &gt; we must resort to the leap of faith to understand God.

&gt; &gt; Atheists don't usually believe in luck, or fate, or whatever. They
&gt; &gt; just believe in learning what we don't understand honestly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Countless tales of those that have accepted faith in their hearts are
&gt; &gt; &gt; told over the centuries.

&gt; &gt; Heil Hitler! Osama Bin Laden is really great, too!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Can they be all wrong?

&gt; &gt; Of course. Why could they _not_ all be wrong? One reason why it's
&gt; &gt; impossible--sock it to me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a personal
&gt; &gt; &gt; choice we all must make, to take the leap of faith, receiving the
&gt; &gt; &gt; blessings in life, or to remain afraid and ashamed of ourselves,

&gt; &gt; If you weren't afraid you wouldn't be a theist. You _should_ be
&gt; &gt; ashamed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking we are not worthy to make such a leap. But we are all worthy
&gt; &gt; &gt; and in need of such a leap. I am here to testify that this is true.

&gt; &gt; Good goddamned luck.

LL: By the same token, you refuse to try the new food of atheistm. You
don't know whether you'd like it unless you try it. You could be

I can't think of any better reason to make the leap to atheism.
Really, I can't!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello! I'm new to the board and am going to be posting for awhile,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hopefully we can both learn from each other about the nature of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theology and moral philosophy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Are you _really_ going to stick around? Why do I doubt this?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wanted to make a post to explain to people why I am a Christian and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; why faith is a good thing. I see a lot of posts here about faith being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bad because some people use it to do bad things. Well, nothing can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; further from the truth. Faith leads us to do good works, to care for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the sick, and to rehabilitate the convicted.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If theists are great people why would they need it? Yeah, I'm sure
&gt; &gt; &gt; faith has caused some people to do good things. But do the pros
&gt; &gt; &gt; outweigh the cons? Not a chance.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It leads us to a fuller
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relationship with ourselves because we're more aware of our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limitations.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That just isn't true. Faith takes you into your delusions and that is
&gt; &gt; &gt; all. Delusions seperate you from other parts of yourself.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And most importantly, it allows us to enter God's grace.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And here's the meat of any theist post: completely unsubstantiated
&gt; &gt; &gt; assertions. The crappy attempts at logic are the icing, and the big
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing blah blah assertions are the cake.

&gt; &gt; This about sums everything up quite nicely. There's nothing
&gt; &gt; substantiated proslogion's post. There really is no justification to
&gt; &gt; make a leap of faith. There's no need, and it can lead to disastrous
&gt; &gt; consequences.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To enter God's grace, rationality can only take us so far.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Correct. It can take you right up to something stupid, then it fails.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Stupid rationality, failing when you come across something stupid.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Grrrr.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We must
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then trust in God and make the &quot;leap of faith&quot; in order to trust in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Him and receive the fullest blessings in life.

&gt; &gt; &gt; More cake.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kierkegaard, in 1844,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argued that such a leap is necessary for us to accept Christianity.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reason is unable to pursue this argument, it's quarry venturing into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the realm where reason fails and does not apply.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Reason does not apply to the completely unreasonable. Take this,
&gt; &gt; &gt; reason: raping babies will make Martian Jesus come back!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many disagree with this, and that rationality is sufficient to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand God. For instance, C.S. Lewis argued that the supernatural
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; must exist to explain our ability to reason. He argues that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; universe is so precisely tuned to allow humans the ability to ponder
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our own existence, it cannot be possible by pure chance.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, you have so much to _learn_ man. The whole concept of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;supernatural&quot; is that we can't explain shit, and yet here you are
&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to explain it. There is no &quot;supernatural&quot; that is
&gt; &gt; &gt; substantiated. It's just a term for made up crap that explains shit
&gt; &gt; &gt; that people don't understand. There is no evidence for anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;supernatural&quot; because if something can be verified it is a part of
&gt; &gt; &gt; nature, not &quot;suuuupernature!&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argument is convincing to many, I personally see the flaws, that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps it DID happen by pure chance.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe _God_ happened by pure chance. Wheeeee.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a principle in science
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called the &quot;anthropic principle&quot; that &quot;we should take account of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constraints that our existence as observers imposes on the sort of
