Pediatric specialists lured  to U.S.
WRHA trying  to recruit replacements
Mon Oct 15  2007
By Jen Skerritt
WINNIPEG is losing two of its top pediatric specialists after they were
lured by a lucrative offer south of the border, health officials confirmed  last
week.
Dr. Abhay Divekar, a pediatric cardiologist, and his wife, Dr. Charuta
Joshi, a pediatric neurologist, will be leaving the Children's Hospital  for job
positions in Iowa.
Divekar and Joshi came to Winnipeg in 2001.
Divekar is renowned as one of the best pediatric cardiologists in  Canada and
worked alongside the province's only other pediatric  cardiologist, Dr. Reeni
Soni.
He is credited with saving the lives of multiple children who likely  would
have died before they could be transferred to Edmonton for  sophisticated
pediatric heart surgery.
Health officials denied more children will have to be sent to Edmonton  for
pediatric heart surgery because of Divekar's departure.
&quot;There's no reason this (expertise) shouldn't continue,&quot; said Dr.  Cheryl
Rockman-Greenberg, medical director of child health for the  Winnipeg Regional
Health Authority.
&quot;There's definitely more people who we want to recruit and we're  recruiting
more people in many subspecialties. Not only because there's a  need but we
also have to plan for the future.&quot;
Statistics from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba show  that
between April 2006 and April 2007, eight Manitoba doctors have left  for the
U.S. -- down from 15 the previous year. Overall between 2006 and  2007, the
province gained 54 physicians.
Rockman-Greenberg said she learned Divekar was considering a job offer
earlier this spring and that it was a difficult decision for him to make.  She said
Soni and the medical team in the pediatric cardiology unit will  be able to
sustain some of the advances and expertise Divekar brought to  Winnipeg.
In the meantime, she said the WRHA is currently trying to recruit two  other
pediatric cardiologists and will know within the next few weeks if  there's a
deal.
&quot;I'm very, very hopeful that in fact, they'll come,&quot; Rockman-Greenberg  said.

Last year, Divekar broke new medical ground when he arranged for a
manufacturer to modify a heart defibrillator for a baby suffering from a  serious heart
problem. The device was loaned out to a local family who  used it to send an
electrical jolt through their daughter's heart when it  stopped beating.
In January, Divekar saved a newborn suffering from extreme respiratory
distress by creating a makeshift lung bypass machine. He fused a lung-like
membrane from a heart-lung bypass pump with catheters from a kidney  dialysis unit.
And in August, Divekar implanted the first dissolvable plug in a
10-year-old's heart. Divekar was the only pediatric cardiologist in the  world to have
the plug's Boston-based manufacturer allow him to use the  device on a child.
Rockman-Greenberg said although Winnipeg has been able to offer  specialists
like Divekar and Joshi competitive salaries, so are other  major centres
across North America.
