Without fossil fuels?

I can guarantee you, with one exception, Milligan (who is probably legally
not allowed to drive), that we are all fossil fuel addicts. Both Liberals
and Conservatives and Bushbots. Even though I mostly ride fuel efficient
motorcycles. I have 4 cars that all get TERRIBLE mileage, one way or
another.

I once pulled alongside a Papyrus in my XJS V12 Jag. The driver commented on
how beautiful my car was. I asked him what kind of mileage he got? He
replied that he got between 60 and 70 miles to the gallon. I replied that I
got 6!. Thankfully the Jag rarely runs and is always in the shop for some
catastrophic malady. But I digress.

I am still terrified by the eventuality of not being able to run my babies
on good old gasoline. I buy racing fuel for them, whenever I can.

Also, I don't think my Brits' would run well on corn juice. They HATE
unleaded fuel as it is.

Any comments?

We?  You and me and western civilization? Or we, human kind?

I guess it all depends on how fast available oil declines.

I'd say a sudden significant drop would be very hard on the West, perhaps
lots of suffering and unrest.  Only the ripple effect would reach 3rd world
people.

A slow decline would just be percieved as "change".

But more importantly, are you going use any of that fossil fuel and come to

If driving a 6 mpg car is that important to you, you'll just pay
whatever it costs.  I think it's already pretty outrageous.

Fossil fuels are not just going to dissapear, like you'll wake up some
morning and find they're all gone.  We'll fight more and more wars to
keep the tank full on your Jag.  We'll extract fuel from tar sands in
Canada, or even from coal--we have plenty of that!  It'll just be a
little dirtier and more expensive (well, okay, a LOT dirtier and more
expensive)

Where it will affect you is not just driving your own car but in
everything you buy that comes from a long way away.   In the case of
us Americans, that's just about -everything-.  Think if Wal-Mart had
to double or triple the price on everything that came from China!

We should have been anticipating this long ago and working feverishly
on the next big source of fuel.  But hey, that's not how Capitalism
works!  8^)  Every barrel of oil we pull out of the ground makes the
remaning stocks just that much more valuable.

Don't sweat it. Since they took the Zinc out of engine oil (SM rating) the
cams will go flat long before we run out of oil.
Using diesel rated oils (Delo, Rotella) will prevent that, until they ruin
it too.

Zinc has been used as an anti-wear addititve for a long time. It is bad for
catalytic converters, so no more zinc. Too bad about those of us who have
pre-catalytic engines, we don't buy enough oil to matter. I haven't read any
studies on the effects to gearboxes as we have on our bikes which share the
oil, but the vintage British racers are eating cams like crazy.
Diesels have no cats, so the zinc hasn't been cut from the oil. Yet.

ABATE of Wisconsin printed a letter to the editor of their newsletter
last month concerning filling up with gasohol right behind an SUV that
has dispensed E85 at a pump equipped with only one nozzle.  It turns
out you can dilute the gasohol in your tank.  (FULL DISCLOSURE: I've
never seen a pump set up this way.)

Common gasohol is E10 (10% ethanol, 90% gasoline).  If you pump 4.5
gallons, you've filled your tank with 0.45 gallons of ethanol and 4.05
gallons of gasoline.

... but the hose at the pump isn't empty when you start.  The above
formula works if and only if the guy in front of you pumped the very
same mixture.

Suppose he pumped E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline).  Then the fuel in
the hose has a lot more ethanol in it than what you want and can
safely use.

The hose contains about 0.33 gallon, so, when you're through, your
tank contains:

o ethanol = 0.33 * 0.85 + 4.17 * 0.10 = 0.70 gal

o gasoline = 0.33 * 0.15 + 4.17 * 0.90 = 3.80 gal

... which is about 18% ethanol, not 10%.

This formula works if and only if your tank is bone dry to begin with.

When I was a kid, in the 1950s, I once went for a ride in a fairly
comfortable car, though rather old, even then. It was capable of using
fossil fuels, but did not actually require them. It was capable of
modern freeway speeds, even triple digit speeds, although the owners
weren't up for that, they being older than their car.

The only real nuisance was that it took about 20 minutes to get the
Stanley's boiler hot...

Given that gasoline can be created from coal and from oil derived from tar
sands, there will very probably be gasoline available for many hundred
years, depending upon how much you want to pay for it.

On top of that, in truth, butanol fuel works in internal combusion engines
for the most part (don't quote me on old ones specifically) and can be
created from biomass.  In some sense given this fact we could possibly
never run out of "gasoline" although how much could be made available is
not entirely clear or how much it would cost.

My prediction is that prices will start rising and (hopefully) road use
will start dropping and (sadly, in a way) those old cars will start
falling to bits long before gasoline becomes available.

In other words, the cars and their owners will be gone before the gas.

Uh, it's not fossil fuels that we are addicted to.  It's "stored energy"

fossil fuels represent a form of energy that Mother Nature has done most
of the work to -concentrate-  This is the real problem.

Sure, you can replace gasoline with biodiesel or ethanol or some such.
Or, gasoline-from-coal or tar sands or whatnot.

The problem is that in all of these other forms of energy, you are merely
converting energy from one form to another - so they take an order of
magnitude greater amount of energy to do the conversion than what
you get out of it.

It's like, for every barrel of oil you pump out of the ground, you get a
barrel of oil.  But, to get the same barrel of oil from coal, you need
10 barrels of coal, or 15 barrels of tar sands, or 50 barrels of corncobs,
etc. etc.

This is why I see once the oil runs out, we are going to have a large
shift to the electric economy.

Right now, since we are mainly generating electricity by burning oil
and coal, it is always more expensive to do things like heat a home,
power a vehicle, etc. from electricity, than just from the oil itself.  It
is
because the energy from the electricity had to go through an extra
conversion process.

When the oil runs out, though, it won't be available to power electric
generators.  So the power company is going to get their electricity
elsewhere - and it is almost certainly going to be from wind energy
and coal.

At that time, to get gasoline your going to have to take coal through
an energy conversion process - which is going to make it either a
break even with, or more expensive, then just powering what your
trying to power directly from electricity.  This is particularly true when
the vehicle is rail - since you don't have to store the electricity for
the vehicle, in the vehicle.

For a lot of reasons I just don't see any incentive to shift stuff like
running locomotives, or home heating, back to coal energy.  And
coal in a vehicle like a car is even more unbelievable.

Obviously, the energy/weight/cost densities of battery technology
today makes something like an electrically powered interstate semi-truck,
or a motorcycle, a non-starter.  So for those vehicles we will will
see liquid fuel, probably biodiesel for the large heavy trucks and
alcohol for the motorcycles, lawnmowers, chainsaws, and other small
engines.

But for everything else, it's sure to be electrically powered by batteries.

&gt; I once pulled alongside a Papyrus in my XJS V12 Jag. The driver commented on
&gt; how beautiful my car was. I asked him what kind of mileage he got? He
&gt; replied that he got between 60 and 70 miles to the gallon. I replied that I
&gt; got 6!. Thankfully the Jag rarely runs and is always in the shop for some
&gt; catastrophic malady. But I digress.

&gt; I am still terrified by the eventuality of not being able to run my babies
&gt; on good old gasoline. I buy racing fuel for them, whenever I can.

Nobody uses significant amounts of oil to generate electricity.
A better trick would be to figure out how to free up the methane
currently used for power generation and begin running methane
as a motor fuel.

A little harder to handle than oil because it's a compressed
gas, but capable of running any otto cycle engine you can name.
One of the most ubiquitous gases in the solar system, with very large
reservoirs of oceanic methane hydrates. Also less of a greenhouse
gas source as it's got a way better H to C ration than petroleum.

It's been a while since I looked at storage. My recollection is about
70 % efficiency for both batteries and large scale stuff like pumped
water. Over the last few decades, storage technology has moved
ahead only very slowly and painfully.

Another candidate might be coal with CO2 sequestration. Coal
plants produce mostly baseload. If you could come up with
a reasonable gasification method to drive turbines for peak
power, that'd be interesting. Pure speculation on my part without
much knowledge of this field.

Yup.  I flew from Alaska to the great Los Angeles last week, then drove a

A single blade on one of those seemed so large that the tractor-trailers
