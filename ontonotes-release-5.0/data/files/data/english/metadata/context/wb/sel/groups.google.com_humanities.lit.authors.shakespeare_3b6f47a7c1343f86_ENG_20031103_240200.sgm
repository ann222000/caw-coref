Jersey, England. Refugees arrived in Jersey from France, after the coup
d'etat of 1851 when Louis Napoleon seized power. Many were distinguished
and some were already Freemasons. The best known was Victor Hugo.
A Warrant was granted, for a Lodge to be called Les Amis de L'Avenir.

Hugo wrote _The Man Who Laughs_ during this Jersey Exile.
This work told of a secret association, in Spain, of nomads, named
the Comprachicos, who existed in the 14th and 15th Centuries.

They would kidnap children, or buy children from people forced
into a life of poverty. They would take these children and,
through body manipulation &amp; psychological torture, turn them into
circus ODDities, for the benefit of the Nobility. Like fellow Grand
Master of the Priory of SION, Jean Cocteau, in the 20th Century,
Hugo based part of this story on Beauty and the Beast.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;&quot;The Man Who Laughs is Victor Hugo's best novel. (Curiously
enough it was the one least understood by his contemporaries.)

The DROESHOUT/HERODOTUS 'anagram' involves a
&quot;sparagmos(dismemberment) and resurrection.&quot;

The Martin Droeshout portrait of Shakespeare
with it's two right eyes &amp; two left shoulders
qualifies as well. In fact,
Droeshout's portrait appears to be a

&quot;sparagmos &amp; resurrection&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------
(1939) Encyclopedia Britannica on &quot;Drama&quot;

HERODOTUS had a lot to say
about TRAGEDY (i.e., a goat-song) being
a PATHOS (i.e., the violent death of Dionysus/Osiris
by &quot;SPARAGMOS&quot; or dismemberment):

&lt;&lt;. . .we have the express testimony of HERODOTUS that the ritual
worship of Dionysus (the god of Drama) was the same as the ritual
worship of Osiris such that it involved a &quot;sparagmos&quot;
(dismemberment), mourning, search, discovery and resurrection.&gt;&gt;

However, HERODOTUS avoided directly mentioning
Dionysus OR Osiris in this regard:

&quot;When the Egyptians lament the god
whom I may not name in this connection&quot;
&quot;They lament but whom they lament I must not say&quot; -- HERODOTUS

For in the manner of ancient religion, it was always necessary
that Dionysus or Osiris be represented by some surrogate.

In fact, ALL TRAGIC HEROS are simply surrogates of Dionysus/Osiris:

&lt;&lt;We find a frequent sparagmos of beings who have committed some sin:

Pentheus by MAENADS
Orpheus by MAENADS
Lycurgus by horses
HYPPOLYTUS by horses
Dirce by a bull
Actaeon by hounds. . .

This use of a surrogate was made easier by the fact that both
at Eleusis and in the Osiris rite the myth was conveyed
by *tableaux* (i.e., 'things shown') rather than by words.

Thus the death of Pentheus, wearing Dionysiac dress,
would be shown by exactly the same tableau as that of Dionysus.

THE TRUTH COULD BE SHOWN TO THE WISE
AND AT THE SAME TIME VEILED FROM *THE UNKNOWING*

Such facts help to explain the charge of
&quot;profaning the mysteries&quot; brought against AESCHYLUS.&gt;&gt;

The Tin Woodman of Oz by L. Frank Baum
Chapter Eighteen. The Tin Woodman Talks to Himself

The Tin Woodman had just noticed the CUPBOARDs and was curious to know
what they contained, so he went to one of them and opened the door.
There were shelves inside, and upon one of the shelves which was about
on a level with his tin chin the Emperor discovered a Head -- it looked
like a doll's head, only it was larger, and he soon saw it was the Head
of some person. It was facing the Tin Woodman and as the CUPBOARD door
swung back, the eyes of the Head slowly opened and looked at him. The
Tin Woodman was not at all surprised, for in the Land of Oz one runs
into magic at every turn.

&quot;Dear me!&quot; said the Tin Woodman, staring hard. &quot;It seems
as if I had met you, somewhere, before. Good morning, sir!&quot;

&quot;You have the advantage of me,&quot; replied the Head.
&quot;I never saw you before in my life.&quot;

&quot;Still, your face is very familiar,&quot; persisted the Tin Woodman.
&quot;Pardon me, but may I ask if you -- eh -- eh -- if you ever had a Body?&quot;

&quot;Yes, at one time,&quot; answered the Head, &quot;but that is so long ago I can't
remember it. Did you think,&quot; with a pleasant smile, &quot;that I was born
just as I am? That a Head would be created without a Body?&quot;

&quot;No, of course not,&quot; said the other.
&quot;But how came you to lose your body?&quot;

&quot;Well, I can't recollect the details; you'll have to ask Ku-Klip about
it,&quot; returned the Head. &quot;For, curious as it may seem to you, my memory
is not good since my separation from the rest of me. I still possess
my brains and my intellect is as good as ever, but my memory
of some of the events I formerly experienced is quite hazy.&quot;

&quot;How long have you been in this CUPBOARD?&quot; asked the Emperor.

&quot;I don't know.&quot;

&quot;Haven't you a name?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said the Head; &quot;I used to be called NICK Chopper,
when I was a woodman and cut down trees for a living.&quot;

&quot;Good gracious!&quot; cried the Tin Woodman in astonishment.
&quot;If you are NICK Chopper's Head, then you are Me -
- or I'm You -- or -- or -- What relation are we, anyhow?&quot;

&quot;Don't ask me,&quot; replied the Head. &quot;For my part, I'm not anxious to
claim relationship with any common, manufactured article, like you. You
may be all right in your class, but your class isn't my class. You're
tin.&quot;

The poor Emperor felt so bewildered that for a time he could
only stare at his old Head in silence. Then he said:

&quot;I must admit that I wasn't at all bad looking before I became tin.
You're almost handsome -- for meat. If your hair was combed,
you'd be quite attractive.&quot;

&quot;How do you expect me to comb my hair without help?&quot; demanded the Head,
indignantly. &quot;I used to keep it smooth and neat, when I had arms, but
after I was removed from the rest of me, my hair got mussed, and old
Ku-Klip never has combed it for me.&quot;

&quot;I'll speak to him about it,&quot; said the Tin Woodman. &quot;Do you remember
loving a pretty Munchkin girl named Nimmie Amee?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; answered the Head. &quot;That is a foolish question. The heart in my
body -- when I had a body -- might have loved someone, for all I know,
but a head isn't made to love; it's made to think.&quot;

&quot;Oh; do you think, then?&quot;

&quot;I used to think.&quot;

&quot;You must have been shut up in this CUPBOARD for years and years. What
have you thought about, in all that time?&quot;

&quot;Nothing. That's another foolish question. A little reflection will
convince you that I have had nothing to think about, except the boards
on the inside of the CUPBOARD door, and it didn't take me long to think
of everything about those boards that could be thought of. Then, of
course, I quit thinking.&quot;

&quot;And are you happy?&quot;

&quot;Happy? What's that?&quot;

&quot;Don't you know what happiness is?&quot; inquired the Tin Woodman.

&quot;I haven't the faintest idea whether it's round or square, or black or
white, or what it is. And, if you will pardon my lack of interest in it,
I will say that I don't care.&quot;

The Tin Woodman was much puzzled by these answers. His traveling
companions had grouped themselves at his back, and had fixed their eyes
on the Head and listened to the conversation with much interest, but
until now, they had not interrupted because they thought the Tin Woodman
had the best right to talk to his own head and renew acquaintance with
it.

But now the Tin Soldier remarked:

&quot;I wonder if my old head happens to be in any of these CUPBOARDs,&quot; and
he proceeded to open all the CUPBOARD doors. But no other head was to be
found on any of the shelves.

&quot;Oh, well; never mind,&quot; said Woot the Wanderer; &quot;I can't imagine what
anyone wants of a cast-off head, anyhow.&quot;

&quot;I can understand the Soldier's interest,&quot; asserted Polychrome, dancing
around the grimy workshop until her draperies formed a cloud around her
dainty form. &quot;For sentimental reasons a man might like to see his old
head once more, just as one likes to revisit an old home.&quot;

&quot;And then to kiss it good-bye,&quot; added the Scarecrow.

&quot;I hope that tin thing won't try to kiss me good- bye!&quot; exclaimed the
Tin Woodman's former head. &quot;And I don't see what right you folks
have to disturb my peace and comfort, either.&quot;

&quot;You belong to me,&quot; the Tin Woodman declared.

&quot;I do not!&quot;

&quot;You and I are one.&quot;

&quot;We've been parted,&quot; asserted the Head. &quot;It would be unnatural for me
to have any interest in a man made of tin. Please close the door and
leave me alone.&quot;

&quot;I did not think that my old Head could be so disagreeable,&quot; said the
Emperor. &quot;I -- I'm quite ashamed of myself; meaning you.&quot;

&quot;You ought to be glad that I've enough sense to know what my rights
are,&quot; retorted the Head. &quot;In this CUPBOARD I am leading a simple life,
peaceful and dignified, and when a mob of people in whom I am not
interested disturb me, they are the disagreeable ones; not I.&quot;

With a sigh the Tin Woodman closed
and latched the CUPBOARD door and turned away.

&quot;Well,&quot; said the Tin Soldier, &quot;if my old head would have treated me as
coldly and in so unfriendly a manner as your old head has treated you,
friend Chopper, I'm glad I could not find it.&quot;

&quot;Yes; I'm rather surprised at my head, myself,&quot; replied
the Tin Woodman, thoughtfully. &quot;I thought I had
a more pleasant disposition when I was made of meat.&quot;

But just then old Ku-Klip the Tinsmith arrived, and he seemed surprised
to find so many visitors. Ku-Klip was a stout man and a short man. He
had his sleeves rolled above his ELBOWS, showing muscular arms, and he
wore A LEATHERN APRON that coVERED all the front of him, and was so long
that Woot was surprised he didn't step on it and trip whenever he
walked. And Ku-Klip had a gray beard that was almost as long as his
apron, and his head was bald on top and his ears stuck out from his head
like two fans. Over his eyes, which were bright and twinkling, he wore
big spectacles. It was easy to see that the tinsmith was a kind hearted
man, as well as a merry and agreeable one. &quot;Oh-ho!&quot; he cried in a joyous
bass voice; &quot;here are both my tin men come to visit me, and they and
their friends are welcome indeed. I'm very proud of you two characters,
I assure you, for you are so perfect that you are proof that I'm a good
workman. Sit down. Sit down, all of you -- if you can find anything
to sit on -- and tell me why you are here.&quot;

So they found seats and told him all of their adventures that
they thought he would like to know. Ku- Klip was glad to learn
that NICK Chopper, the Tin Woodman, was now Emperor of the Winkies
and a friend of Ozma of Oz, and the tinsmith was also
interested in the Scarecrow and Polychrome.

He turned the straw man around, examining him curiously,
and patted him on all sides, and then said:

&quot;You are certainly wonderful, but I think you would be more durable and
steady on your legs if you were made of tin. Would you like me to --&quot;

&quot;No, indeed!&quot; interrupted the Scarecrow hastily;
&quot;I like myself better as I am.&quot;

But to Polychrome the tinsmith said:

&quot;Nothing could improve you, my dear, for you are the most beautiful
maiden I have ever seen. It is pure happiness just to look at you.&quot;

&quot;That is praise, indeed, from so skillful a workman,&quot; returned the
Rainbow's Daughter, laughing and dancing in and out the room.

&quot;Then it must be this boy you wish me to help,&quot;
said Ku-Klip, looking at Woot.

&quot;No,&quot; said Woot, &quot;we are not here to seek your skill,
but have merely come to you for information.&quot;

Then, between them, they related their search for Nimmie Amee, whom the
Tin Woodman explained he had resolved to marry, yet who had promised to
become the bride of the Tin Soldier before he unfortunately became
rusted. And when the story was told, they asked Ku-Klip
if he knew what had become of Nimmie Amee.

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; replied the old man, &quot;but I know that she wept bitterly
when the Tin Soldier did not come to marry her, as he had promised to
do. The old Witch was so provoked at the girl's tears that she beat
Nimmie Amee with her crooked stick and then hobbled away to gather some
magic herbs, with which she intended to transform the girl into an old
hag, so that no one would again love her or care to marry her. It was
while she was away on this errand that Dorothy's house fell on the
Wicked Witch, and she turned to dust and blew away. When I heard this
good news, I sent Nimmie Amee to find the Silver Shoes which the Witch
had worn, but Dorothy had taken them with her to the Emerald City.&quot;

&quot;Yes, we know all about those Silver Shoes,&quot; said the Scarecrow.

&quot;Well,&quot; continued Ku-Klip, &quot;after that, Nimmie Amee decided to go away
from the forest and live with some people she was acquainted with who
had a house on Mount Munch. I have never seen the girl since.&quot;

&quot;Do you know the name of the people on Mount Munch,
with whom she went to live?&quot; asked the Tin Woodman.

&quot;No, Nimmie Amee did not mention her friend's name, and I did not ask
her. She took with her all that she could carry of the goods that were
in the Witch's house, and she told me I could have the rest. But when I
went there I found nothing worth taking except some magic powders
that I did not know how to use, and a bottle of Magic Glue.&quot;

&quot;What is Magic Glue?&quot; asked Woot.

&quot;It is a magic preparation with which to mend people when they cut
themselves. One time, long ago, I cut off one of my fingers by accident,
and I carried it to the Witch, who took down her bottle and glued it on
again for me. See!&quot; showing them his finger, &quot;it is as good as ever it
was. No one else that I ever heard of had this Magic Glue, and of course
when NICK Chopper cut himself to pieces with his enchanted axe and
Captain Fyter cut himself to pieces with his enchanted sword, the Witch
would not mend them, or allow me to glue them together, because she had
herself wickedly enchanted the axe and sword. Nothing remained but for
me to make them new parts out of tin; but, as you see, tin answered
the purpose very well, and I am sure their tin bodies are a great
improvement on their meat bodies.&quot;&quot;VERY TRUE,&quot; said the Tin Soldier.

&quot;I quite agree with you,&quot; said the Tin Woodman. &quot;I happened to
find my old head in your CUPBOARD, a while ago, and certainly
it is not as desirable a head as the tin one I now wear.&quot;

&quot;By the way,&quot; said the Tin Soldier,
&quot;what ever became of my old head, Ku-Klip?&quot;

&quot;And of the different parts of our bodies?&quot; added the Tin Woodman.

&quot;Let me think a minute,&quot; replied Ku-Klip. &quot;If I remember right, you two
boys used to bring me most of your parts, when they were cut off, and
I saved them in that barrel in the corner. You must not have brought me
all the parts, for when I made Chopfyt I had hard work finding enough
pieces to complete the job. I finally had to finish him with one arm.&quot;

&quot;Who is Chopfyt?&quot; inquired Woot.

&quot;Oh, haven't I told you about Chopfyt?&quot; exclaimed Ku- Klip. &quot;Of course
not! And he's quite a curiosity, too. You'll be interested in hearing
about Chopfyt. This is how he happened:

&quot;One day, after the Witch had been destroyed and Nimmie Amee had gone
to live with her friends on Mount Munch, I was looking around the shop
for something and came upon the bottle of Magic Glue which I had brought
from the old Witch's house. It occurred to me to piece together the ODDs
and ends of you two people, which of course were just as good as ever,
and see if I couldn't make a man out of them. If I succeeded, I would
have an assistant to help me with my work, and I thought it would be a
clever idea to put to some practical use the scraps of NICK Chopper and
Captain Fyter. There were two perfectly good heads in my CUPBOARD, and a
lot of feet and legs and parts of bodies in the barrel, so I set to work
to see what I could do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Antony and Cleopatra Act 3, Scene 13

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS The itch of his affection should not then
Have NICK'd his CAPTAINship; at such a point,
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&quot;First, I pieced together a body, gluing it with the Witch's Magic
Glue, which worked perfectly. That was the hardest part of my job,
however, because the bodies didn't match up well and some parts were
missing. But by using a piece of CAPTAIN Fyter here and a piece of NICK
Chopper there, I finally got together a very decent body, with heart
and all the trimmings complete.&quot;

&quot;Whose heart did you use in making asked the Tin Woodman anxiously.
the body?&quot;

&quot;I can't tell, for the parts had no tags on them and one heart looks
much like another. After the body was completed, I glued two fine legs
and feet onto it. One leg was NICK Chopper's and one was Captain Fyter's
and, finding one leg longer than the other, I trimmed it down to make
them match. I was much disappointed to find that I had but one arm.
There was an extra leg in the barrel, but I could find only one arm.
Having glued this onto the body, I was ready for the head, and I had
some difficulty in making up my mind which head to use. Finally I shut
my eyes and reached out my hand toward the CUPBOARD shelf,
and the first head I touched I glued upon my new man.&quot;

&quot;It was mine!&quot; declared the Tin Soldier, gloomily.

&quot;No, it was mine,&quot; asserted Ku-Klip, &quot;for I had given you another in
exchange for it -- the beautiful tin head you now wear. When the glue
had dried, my man was quite an interesting fellow. I named him Chopfyt,
using a part of NICK Chopper's name and a part of Captain Fyter's name,
because he was a mixture of both your cast-off parts. Chopfyt was
interesting, as I said, but he did not prove a very agreeable companion.
He complained bitterly because I had given him but one arm -- as if it
were my fault! -- and he grumbled because the suit of blue Munchkin
clothes, which I got for him from a neighbor, did not fit him
perfectly.&quot;

&quot;Ah, that was because he was wearing my old head,&quot; remarked
the Tin Soldier. &quot;I remember that head used to be VERy particular
about its clothes.&quot;

---------------------------------------------------------------------
&quot;As an assistant,&quot; the old tinsmith continued, &quot;Chopfyt was not a
success. He was awkward with tools and was always hungry. He demanded
something to eat six or eight times a day, so I wondered if I had fitted
his insides properly. Indeed, Chopfyt ate so much that little food was
left for myself; so, when he proposed, one day, to go out into the world
and seek adventures, I was delighted to be rid of him. I even made him a
tin arm to take the place of the missing one, and that pleased him very
much, so that we parted good friends.&quot;

&quot;What became of Chopfyt after that?&quot; the Scarecrow inquired.

&quot;I never heard. He started off toward the east, into the plains of the
Munchkin Country, and that was the last I ever saw of him.&quot;

&quot;It seems to me,&quot; said the Tin Woodman reflectively, &quot;that you did
wrong in making a man out of our cast-off parts. It is evident that
Chopfyt could, with justice, claim relationship with both of us.&quot;

&quot;Don't worry about that,&quot; advised Ku-Klip cheerfully; &quot;it is not likely
that you will ever meet the fellow. And, if you should meet him, he
doesn't know who he is made of, for I never told him the secret of
his manufacture. Indeed, you are the only ones who know of it,
and you may keep the secret to yourselves, if you wish to.&quot;

&quot;Never mind Chopfyt,&quot; said the Scarecrow. &quot;Our business now is
to find poor Nimmie Amee and let her choose her tin husband.

&gt; Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery
&gt; (later Earl of Pembroke; 1584 - 1650)
&gt; Married 27 December 1604 Susan de Vere. With his brother William, he is
the
&gt; dedicatee of the First Folio. In 1618 Jaggard, the publisher of the First
&gt; Folio, dedicated Archaio-Ploutos to him and his wife Susan. After his
&gt; brother's death in 1630, Philip Herbert became Earl of Pembroke.

&gt; Quoted from  http://www.compapp.dcu.ie/~humphrys  , a family genealogy by
Dr.
&gt; Mark Humphrys:

&gt;&quot;The Herbert family had numerous connections with Shakespeare, and also,
&gt; interestingly, with Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, who some claim is
&gt; the real Shakespeare:

&gt; 1. De Vere's unhappy wife Anne Cecil had once been intended for Lady
&gt; Pembroke's brother Sir Philip Sidney. Anne married de Vere in 1571, and he
&gt; treated her badly.
&gt; 2. Sidney (still then unmarried) and de Vere had a famous quarrel in
1579..
&gt; 3. It is reputed that Shakespeare and his players first performed
&gt; As You Like It (1600) and perhaps Twelfth Night (prob. 1601) at Wilton
&gt; (although note that nearby Salisbury town, Wiltshire, also claims
&gt; a particular spot as the place where As You Like It was first performed).
&gt; http://www.dlroper.shakespearians.com/true_swan_of_avon.htm

&gt; 4. The 3rd Earl of Pembroke was engaged to de Vere's daughter Bridget
&gt; at some time, before marrying another in Nov 1604.
&gt; 5. The 4th Earl of Pembroke married de Vere's daughter Susan in Dec 1604.
&gt; 6. Shakespeare's sonnets were dedicated to &quot;Mr. W. H.&quot; in 1609.
&gt; This has been identified with William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke
&gt; 7. The first folio edition of Shakespeare's plays (pub posthumously 1623)
&gt; is dedicated to the 3rd and 4th Earls of Pembroke.&quot;

&gt;&lt;&lt;The only St.Paul's monument to have survived the Great Fire:
&gt; a carving of poet John Dunne, by Nicholas Stone.&gt;&gt;
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; From M. H. Spielmann, &quot;Shakespeare's Portraiture,&quot; in
&gt; *Studies in the First Folio* (Oxford University Press, 1924):

&gt;&quot;The mantling about the shield is contemporary in style, and the whole
&gt; exactly what we are accustomed to find from the tomb-makers of the
&gt; period, among whom Nicholas Stone, working in conjunction with Bernard
&gt; Janssen -- probably a kinsman of Garratt -- is a noteworthy example.
&gt; The same details reappear constantly in their work, both Bernard's and
&gt; Garratt's, in a whole series of tombs and monuments, and we need go no
&gt; farther than the Charterhouse and look there at the tomb of the pious
&gt; founder, Thomas Sutton, to recognize that such details, both
&gt; architectural and sculptural, were, as it were, stereotyped in the work
&gt; of these leaders of their craft -- stock designs used by the three men.

&gt;&lt;&lt;In 1621, a gift of £250 from Henry, Lord Danvers (later Earl of Danby)
&gt; allowed the University of Oxford to take out the lease from Magdalen
&gt; College of a five-acre tract of meadowland, on a bend of the river
&gt; Cherwell beyond the East gate of the city, in order to set up a physic
&gt; garden there. Danvers' gift, together with the benefaction made by Sir
&gt; Henry Savile to found professorships of geometry and astronomy, promised
&gt; to transform the teaching of natural philosophy at Oxford. By 1632, the
&gt; buildings of what is now the University's botanical garden had been
&gt; erected by Nicholas Stone, a mason who had acted for INIGO JONES, and
&gt; work had begun to stock it with plants, following the model of earlier
&gt; physic gardens on the Continent. An attempt to persuade the elder John
&gt; Tradescant to accept the post of gardener failed in 1637, but, by 1641,
&gt; Jacob Bobart(c.1596-1680), a native of BRUNSWICK, had been appointed to
&gt; the post, with a lease on the garden of ninety-nine years, and the right
&gt; to sell fruit and vegetables from it. Bobart's tasks were 'to dresse
&gt; manure preserve and keepe the said Garden and from tyme to tyme sett
&gt; and plant the same with such herbes settes trees and plants as shall be
&gt; thought requesit and necessarie' (Vines and Druce, p.xvi), for which
&gt; Danby contracted to pay him £40 a year. Following Danby's death and the
&gt; sequestration of his lands during the Civil War, Bobart's salary went
&gt; unpaid for several years, and he lived from the sale of the Physic
&gt; Garden's produce while the University petitioned Parliament to have his
&gt; annuity restored. Bobart continued as gardener until his death, and was
&gt; succeeded in the post by his son, also called Jacob. His care for the
&gt; Physic Garden won the admiration of many visitors to Oxford, who were
&gt; impressed by the rare trees and plants which Bobart grew, by his
&gt; extraordinary topiary, and, increasingly, by the gardener's own bizarre
&gt; appearance (see  http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/gatt/garden/catalog.asp?CN=22 ).
&gt; In Bobart's hands, the Physic Garden recreated Eden, in which all
&gt; the plants of the world had flourished.&gt;&gt;
