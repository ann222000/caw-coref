Does anyone out there know how iridium was/is put on nib tips? I find a
reference in The Complete Metalsmith (a jewelers reference book) that
lists platting pen nibs as a use of the platinum group.

Does anyone remember Frank Dubiel speaking of this?

So they still shear the slit, as in the old steel dip-pen days, and
then cut the pellet?  I would have thought they'd cut it all at once.
I guess the extra precision needed costs less than more-frequent blade
changes.

Thanks for the great post!

Considering the number of nibs made by the big nibmakers it is a
tremendous industrial process. From what I remember of the Bock
article, the only thing they don't do themselves is roll the blank
gold stock themselves. A foundry supplies rolls of 18K and 14K gold
that has been cold-rolled into a thin triangular cross section.
Because the nib tapers in thickness from the section (thin) to the
point (thick) it is more economical to have the supplier provide gold
in a form which Bock can immediately load the blank stampers. These
are large machines, looks like they are about 12' H x 8' W x 15' D and
each has one operator. The Bock factory floor is dotted with these,
each of which can turn out a large number of blanks or finished nibs.

Remember, Bock does not make pens or sell nibs retail. Many of their
stamping machines are dedicated to different pen manufacturers and
have all of their names and trademarks ready to go. New pen companies
like Bexley and the new Conklin enter into agreements with Bock (or
other nibmakers like Namiki) for relatively short-run nib manufacture.
Because of a lot of automation this is economically feasable.

The big nibmakers can be compared to the Swatch Group and Swiss
watches -- very few watcmakers make their own movements as it is
extremely expensive to do so. When Swatch reorganized the Swiss
watchaking industry they consolidated most of the movement
&quot;manufactures&quot; to one company, ETA. ETA movements are found in
everything from Swiss Army quartz watches to Omega, Breitling,
TAG/Heuer and many many more mechanical watches. ETA provides
assembled or unassembled &quot;ebauches&quot; (French for &quot;watch movement&quot;) with
or without manufacturer's markings etc. This lets the watch companies
design and build the visible part of the watch -- many also make
adjustments, additions, and other operations on the ebauche. Pelikanyo
Paul is the guy to ask about the differences between, for example, an
Omega and a Breitling using the same ETA movement.

Outsourcing is the key, whether pen nibs or watch movements, keeps
prices reasonably in check. The difference is that Swiss law mandates
that a watch marked &quot;Made in Switzerland&quot; or &quot;Swiss&quot; must have at
least 80% of the watch's content actually made in Switzerland. Bock is
based in Germany and provides nibs to most European pen companies with
a few notable exceptions such as Pelikan.

If anyone knows more about Namiki's nibmaking operations I'd surely
love to hear about them.
