There are also  live virtual support group meetings, thur evenings and
friday am's thru the www.mybrainconnections.com website.  I'm going to
forward an email reminder about the group which will hopefully give you
enough info to check it out if you want to.  also, there are some
conversations on the website as well.

We are 'chatting' via the email, I guess.  I bet we could do better with that if we moved to
www.mybrainconnections.com Isn't that right Michael::
Did you get registered at that site yet Tina?  I'm so glad you're getting re hooked up.  I'm just getting back on line, too.

Hey look people, Michael;s e mail google group is about to hit 1000.  WOW we are at 980 Joanne

It looks like the email is the chat house,  Mybrainconnections.com  I think
to me at least is a site to share information also I wish we could copy a
lot of the conversation on the emails over to the mybrainconnections site,
Is that possible Michael , I know you are busy working on that site but is
it possible to have a space on mybrainconnections to past and copy some very
good emails.  let us know,

And if you want your email to be able to post to the site, maybe like a code
word to say ok or not ok, remember some of us do not know how to cut and
paste or copy  to be able to do it, like me , i just learned how to cut and
paste or copy and view, so as for me michael anything that i write in our
email you can transfer to the mybrainconnections.com and if i do not wish it
to go over i will say do not copy to site.

well if you have an article that looks worthy enough to cut and past
and continue the conversation on the website, just go and find an
appropriate message forum copy and past it and the inform the
participants and author of the email that the discussion is moving
over to the website and them if there are any objections to that then
we will cross that bridge when it comes up.

well, i believe that if you reply to the message in the google group
that you are moving the discussion over to mybrainconnections.com
alone should be sufficient and if there are any objections noted as a
result of that email then we will take actions and not move the
conversation over to the website. if not copying and basting the
messages, you should paraphrase the information and not disclose
personal information from the email and there should be no problem.

Hi to all,
We're staying at our SECOND HOME this weekend.  *(translation-house in Indiana, we can't sell and needs regular maintenance which takes up our time and money) I have serious INTERNET problems here so I wont be able to Moderate my pages on mybrainconnections.com over the weekend.  I'll be back in HiSpeedLand on Tues.

Planning Planning Planning  Make your routine-routine.
Driving out here yesterday (3 hours door to door) with my elderly pets and elderly car, it's assumed something will give out over the 180 miles.  We take turns.  Some times I can hear the cat throwing up in her carrier.  Sometimes, when the dog shifts positions, well, she could benefit from those leakage undergarments sold on TV, if she was one of those dogs who wears clothes. I always thought that was a humiliation but I'm reconsidering that. I was doing OK yesterday so it was the car's turn at the 1/2 point which also was between cell towers.  Nice place for a murder, I mused.

Now that I've made this trip with them for 6 months, I'm starting to figure out what I need and I try to keep all the items together and just plop them in the car.  That way I don't have to re-think, everything or go and round it up.  Tina M has spoken about a key way to not forget something important is to put it in your path so that you have to go right over it ego, you can't forget it.  Of course, if you live with someone who doesn't appreciate our trail of breadcrumbs which can resemble a debris field of a cyclone, it's a sore point.
My husband the surgeon is a tidy, sew up the edges nice and neat, leave no extra junk in the trunk or someone’s incision.  You know, they really do have nurses who count each gauze pad, and instrument during a surgery and reconcile the numbers at the end of the case. In 99.99999999% of the cases, the count comes out right, (we all see the rare but very unfortunate person who gets an item left behind on the news.)  So unless my husband is bringing home a circulating nurse from the OR, he's going to have a meltdown over the &quot;condition&quot; of my car.  To him, it seems disorderly, with signs of character flaws, to me, my car is like my purse-with an engine.
So I try to leave certain &quot;things&quot; in the car so I don't have to repack each time, like one of the dog's leashes,  2 servings of cat &amp; dog food, a plastic bowl and bottled water, in case we get stranded, and some books on tape because 3/4 of the drive doesn't get AM radio.

I pack up the car, yesterday with the last minute stuff and off we go.  Within the first mile, I reach for my tapes and they're not there in the designated spot.  Hmmm.  He's been here!
I recognize the signs. (I'm watching way too much LAW &amp; ORDER)

To minimize the sound of the cat puking, I try to tune into a local station which is playing some blue/grass/country and the song was, &quot;I WISH MY NOSE WAS RUNNIN' MONEY but IT'S SNOT&quot;  The reception is so bad that I was out of radio range before I learned if the sweethearts or Buger Buddies make it.  I drive along for 90 miles and the car quits, just plain quits.  I look at the gas gauge, 1/3 of  a tank.  I notice the mileage, 92K and the sticker on the window claims it's been about 8K since i changed the oil.  Ooops.  I still had steering and breaks so I pull off, way off to the side and popped the hood and checked the oil fearing the worst.  There was oil in it, a little bit dirty but oil enough.  (that's my new environmental effort save oil, in my car!)  I limp it into a gas station off the highway and by this time the dog wants out of the car. I reach for her leash and IT'S GONE.  Dang the dastardly, obsessive nature of the man.  HIM again, cleaning out my car is
cause me no end of problems.  If he wants to mess with my car, Change the OIL!

For some reason, the dog was obedient enough and stayed close to me in the field next to the gas station before I could fashion a makeshift leash from my bathrobe belt. For some other mysterious reason, the car fires up again and we were off and made it to Indiana in one piece.

With no radio or books on tape to distract me, I was able to contemplate the day. Although I was foiled over and over again on my little excursion, it reinforced a couple of things.

1. We've got to take note of our performance and behavior and recognize the conflict it stirs
up. No judgments about who's right or wrong, just observation and willingness
to accept other people's personal performance quirks. We want acknowledgement
and acceptance but we have to bestow it, too.

2. We've got to keep communicating with those we share space so that we can work
together to be organized and regain the &quot;executive function&quot; we lost from a TBI.
Bob's an anal surgeon but I was the really organized one at home.  I went into the
accident as Martha Stewart and came out as Roseanne Barr.

3. We have to Make our Routines Routine. So many of our activities can be broken down
into task with us laying out all the parts, equipment and our behavioral component.
It's mostly predictable, what we're going to do and when. Let's borrow the Operating
Room style or do a Pilot's check list of organizing tasks. Line up what you need, even
if you nearly TRIP over, like Tina M says.

Bob's operating room experiences make him intolerant of &quot;mess&quot;, which is a good thing in your surgeon.  But I also pointed out to him that when he does a case, the instruments he uses are all pre-packaged and waiting for him, all lined up in the order that he'll be using them.
I explained that I want to have my life to run that smoothly, too. There are some activities that I do that are so predictable that I can Pre-package them..
LIKE MY ROAD TRIPS WITH THE PETS!!!!!   tapes, leash, water, food-

He saw a mess of stuff in my car, got annoyed and cleaned it out for me since I wasn't taking care of it myself. From my point of view, I didn't have a mess in the car.  I had an organizational strategy going on that made me and the pets able to have a safe journey with most contingencies covered.  When he dismantled it, we were really in a bad way.

Compromise was found and hopefully Bob can look at my little trail of stuff and piles as I am breaking down the tasks that need to be done, I'll just try to be more considerate about the SPRAY and GIRTH of my piles.

So I'll pre-package my Road Trips and put most of the gear in an old shoe box so it doesn't look messy to him and I know it's all there for me.

You know, outside of the brain injury community, many groups, disciplines and professions evaluate and tackle tasks in an effort to improve performance and safety.  The operating room, airplane cockpits and organizational gurus like Steven Covey even market paper or electronic planners.  Folks with TBI could take a page from a Franklin Planner and adopt it in many places.

Remember Bugs Bunny’s great philosophy when he said, &quot;If ya can't beat 'em, join ‘em.&quot;

I gotta go pack me a shoe box while waiting for my high speed again.

Joanne,

Thanks for the wonderful story. I could relate so well to much of what you said including the cat throwing up -- sorry folks, don't mean to get too graphic here; and also the putting stuff we need right in front of our faces so there is little chance we'll forget it. That is my strategy for leaving the house each day. I put everything i need to teach my class or everything i'll need depending on where else i might go, right there. my father thinks i'm really &quot;bad,&quot; that is, here's an example of a comment he might make, &quot;Geez, I knew you needed help, but I didn't have any idea you were so bad.&quot; Yeah, gee thanks, dad, that really helps contribute to my already soaring self-esteem level.&quot; That's what I said to him. People are such bastards. Sorry again there people, I know I shouldn't swear.

organized chaos :) Is there some sort of rubber maid containers that
you can use like you do with the shoe boxes to organize your chaos and
maybe use a sharpie on them to label them for the particular reason
for organizing the box like &quot; long road trip&quot; or &quot;cats must haves&quot;
this way the clutter is masked and if you do do this you should also
limit what goes into the gases and how many cases you do use. i think
a good television show to watch is mission organization or something
where they discuss the underlying factors of why people hold on to
their clutter. Also this is an update to my therapy rehab trip to
california, i am scheduled to leave early early at the but crack of
dawn on the 5th. eek!

&gt; I recognize the signs. (I'm watching way too much LAW &amp; ORDER)

&gt; To minimize the sound of the cat puking, I try to tune into a local
&gt; station which is playing some blue/grass/country and the song was,
&gt; &quot;I WISH MY NOSE WAS RUNNIN' MONEY but IT'S SNOT&quot;  The reception is
&gt; so bad that I was out of radio range before I learned if the
&gt; sweethearts or Buger Buddies make it.  I drive along for 90 miles
&gt; and the car quits, just plain quits.  I look at the gas gauge, 1/3
&gt; of  a tank.  I notice the mileage, 92K and the sticker on the window
&gt; claims it's been about 8K since i changed the oil.  Ooops.  I still
&gt; had steering and breaks so I pull off, way off to the side and
&gt; popped the hood and checked the oil fearing the worst.  There was
&gt; oil in it, a little bit dirty but oil enough.  (that's my new
&gt; environmental effort save oil, in my car!)  I limp it into a gas
&gt; station off the highway and by this time the dog wants out of the
&gt; car. I reach for her leash and IT'S GONE.  Dang the dastardly,
&gt; obsessive nature of the man.  HIM again, cleaning out my car is
&gt; cause me no end of problems.  If he wants to mess with my car,
&gt; Change the OIL!

&gt; For some reason, the dog was obedient enough and stayed close to me
&gt; in the field next to the gas station before I could fashion a
&gt; makeshift leash from my bathrobe belt. For some other mysterious
&gt; reason, the car fires up again and we were off and made it to
&gt; Indiana in one piece.

&gt; With no radio or books on tape to distract me, I was able to
&gt; contemplate the day. Although I was foiled over and over again on my
&gt; little excursion, it reinforced a couple of things.

&gt; 1. We've got to take note of our performance and behavior and
&gt; recognize the conflict it stirs
&gt;     up. No judgments about who's right or wrong, just observation
&gt; and willingness
&gt;     to accept other people's personal performance quirks. We want
&gt; acknowledgement
&gt;     and acceptance but we have to bestow it, too.

&gt; 2. We've got to keep communicating with those we share space so that
&gt; we can work
&gt;     together to be organized and regain the &quot;executive function&quot; we
&gt; lost from a TBI.
&gt;     Bob's an anal surgeon but I was the really organized one at
&gt; home.  I went into the
&gt;     accident as Martha Stewart and came out as Roseanne Barr.

&gt; 3. We have to Make our Routines Routine. So many of our activities
&gt; can be broken down
&gt;     into task with us laying out all the parts, equipment and our
&gt; behavioral component.
&gt;     It's mostly predictable, what we're going to do and when. Let's
&gt; borrow the Operating
&gt;     Room style or do a Pilot's check list of organizing tasks. Line
&gt; up what you need, even
&gt;     if you nearly TRIP over, like Tina M says.

&gt; Bob's operating room experiences make him intolerant of &quot;mess&quot;,
&gt; which is a good thing in your surgeon.  But I also pointed out to
&gt; him that when he does a case, the instruments he uses are all pre-
&gt; packaged and waiting for him, all lined up in the order that he'll
&gt; be using them.
&gt; I explained that I want to have my life to run that smoothly, too.
&gt; There are some activities that I do that are so predictable that I
&gt; can Pre-package them..
&gt; LIKE MY ROAD TRIPS WITH THE PETS!!!!!   tapes, leash, water, food-

&gt; He saw a mess of stuff in my car, got annoyed and cleaned it out for
&gt; me since I wasn't taking care of it myself. From my point of view, I
&gt; didn't have a mess in the car.  I had an organizational strategy
&gt; going on that made me and the pets able to have a safe journey with
&gt; most contingencies covered.  When he dismantled it, we were really
&gt; in a bad way.

&gt; Compromise was found and hopefully Bob can look at my little trail
&gt; of stuff and piles as I am breaking down the tasks that need to be
&gt; done, I'll just try to be more considerate about the SPRAY and GIRTH
&gt; of my piles.

&gt; So I'll pre-package my Road Trips and put most of the gear in an old
&gt; shoe box so it doesn't look messy to him and I know it's all there
&gt; for me.

&gt; You know, outside of the brain injury community, many groups,
&gt; disciplines and professions evaluate and tackle tasks in an effort
&gt; to improve performance and safety.  The operating room, airplane
&gt; cockpits and organizational gurus like Steven Covey even market
&gt; paper or electronic planners.  Folks with TBI could take a page from
&gt; a Franklin Planner and adopt it in many places.

&gt; Remember Bugs Bunny’s great philosophy when he said, &quot;If ya can't
&gt; beat 'em, join ‘em.&quot;

&gt; I gotta go pack me a shoe box while waiting for my high speed again.

Michael:  I love the rubbermade suggestion.  That's what I have in my car.
Also, I have a list on the computer (so I can change it, add it it etc) of
what I need to pack when I go away so I don't have to reinvent the wheel

&gt;  Hi to all,
&gt; We're staying at our *SECOND HOME *this weekend.  *(translation-house in
&gt; Indiana, we can't sell and needs regular maintenance which takes up our
&gt; time and money) I have serious INTERNET problems here so I wont be able to
&gt; Moderate my pages on mybrainconnections.com over the weekend.  I'll be
&gt; back in HiSpeedLand on Tues.

&gt; Planning Planning Planning  Make your routine-routine.
&gt; Driving out here yesterday (3 hours door to door) with my elderly pets and
&gt; elderly car, it's assumed something will give out over the 180 miles.  We
&gt; take turns.  Some times I can hear the cat throwing up in her carrier.
&gt; Sometimes, when the dog shifts positions, well, she could benefit from those
&gt; leakage undergarments sold on TV, if she was one of those dogs who wears
&gt; clothes. I always thought that was a humiliation but I'm reconsidering that.
&gt; I was doing OK yesterday so it was the car's turn at the 1/2 point which
&gt; also was between cell towers.  Nice place for a murder, I mused.

&gt; Now that I've made this trip with them for 6 months, I'm starting to
&gt; figure out what I need and I try to keep all the items together and just
&gt; plop them in the car.  That way I don't have to re-think, everything or go
&gt; and round it up.  Tina M has spoken about a key way to not forget something
&gt; important is to put it in your path so that you have to go right over it
&gt; ego, you can't forget it.  Of course, if you live with someone who doesn't
&gt; appreciate our trail of breadcrumbs which can resemble a debris field of a
&gt; cyclone, it's a sore point.
&gt; My husband the surgeon is a tidy, sew up the edges nice and neat, leave no
&gt; extra junk in the trunk or someone's incision.  You know, they really do
&gt; have nurses who count each gauze pad, and instrument during a surgery and
&gt; reconcile the numbers at the end of the case. In 99.99999999% of the
&gt; cases, the count comes out right, (we all see the rare but very unfortunate
&gt; person who gets an item left behind on the news.)  So unless my husband is
&gt; bringing home a circulating nurse from the OR, he's going to have a meltdown
&gt; over the &quot;condition&quot; of my car.  To him, it seems disorderly, with signs of
&gt; character flaws, to me, my car is like my purse-with an engine.
&gt; So I try to leave certain &quot;things&quot; in the car so I don't have to repack
&gt; each time, like one of the dog's leashes,  2 servings of cat &amp; dog food, a
&gt; plastic bowl and bottled water, in case we get stranded, and some books on
&gt; tape because 3/4 of the drive doesn't get AM radio.

&gt; I pack up the car, yesterday with the last minute stuff and off we
&gt; go.  Within the first mile, I reach for my tapes and they're not there in
&gt; the designated spot.  Hmmm.  He's been here!
&gt; I recognize the signs. (I'm watching way too much LAW &amp; ORDER)
