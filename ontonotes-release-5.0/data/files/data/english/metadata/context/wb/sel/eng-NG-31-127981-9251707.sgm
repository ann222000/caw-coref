For many years I have wanted to drive the med, Switzerland, France, Spain and Portugal in something special, primarily it was going to be a classic car, then as the years passed it was going to be a sports car or coupe so I settled on buying a fiat coupe 20v turbo for the trip, (some Italian passion) I have in the past owned several of the fiats, Alfas and lancias and enjoyed everything about them. However I have been told by the fiat coupe guru straight out that these cars are rubbish and too much hassle, which I appreciate as I was about to buy one from him. (Good honest guy heh?).
I now am looking at Mercedes Sl's, they all seem to start at £5k which is more than I want to spend just for a 3 week trip, then I looked at ToyotaMR2 turbos, I think a little too chav but apparently a very good car to drive.
We actually own a Volvo 2.5 turbo v70 which would be a fantastic and maybe perfect car for the trip, but it is hardly a part of the dream I had in mind!
Any suggestions for someone who wishes he could  do the trip in a Ferrari superamerica but has less than £5k to spend (More like 2.5k tops ha ha) I have looked and looked again and no I don't want to take a GTO!! any car suggestions appreciated. thanks

A big diesel would be my choice.

Possibly a 156 2.4 JTD.

Diesel is stupidly cheap on the continent, so you'll save hundreds of
pounds in fuel costs.

You'd get a very good low mileage Toyota Celica ST185 GT4 turbo for under
£2500, but maybe that has the same drawbacks as an MR2
Same engine as the MR2 turbo though and a bit thirsty.

For something completely different, how about a late E34 BMW 5 series. You
could get one with all the bells a whistles for under 2.5k. Then for another
£k or so more you could think about a BMW E36 328i coupe.

Tatra 805.

Well, that's what I'm doing a trip across Europe in.

Best cars I've found for cross Europe travel have been

Alfa 164 Q4
Range Rover Vogue
Porsche 993 Turbo

Fiat Seicento
Skoda Favorit
BMW Z3

***************************************************

14 years ago we drove from Preston, Lancashire, to what was then
Czechoslovakia, fell in love with the country and have been back every year
since, but we've expanded our horizons slightly since then and regularly
include Poland and/or Hungary as well - even been to Transylvania in
Romania.

Over that time we've owned, and done the trips in, a Granada 2.8 Ghia X, a
Rover 800 Sterling, a Honda Legend, and finally, the past 4 years have been
in our Nissan QX 3.0 SEL. Each one of them has done it effortlessly and
comfortably but then I've never wanted to do it in a Ferrari  :o)

Lol, when I was in Florida I made a left one time when 'UK mode' kicked
in and I automatically headed for the left hand lane. The near head-on I
had with a Dodge Ram ensured I didn't make the same mistake twice.

Ho yuss, I used to do that regularly when I used to hire cars at Schipol.
I've nearly totalled a few of Avis' small car fleet just leaving the

Most confusing drive I've had was from Liverpool &gt; Ancona in a LHD Range
Rover, then using a RHD Range Rover over there as my &quot;wheels&quot;.

Well, in the 14 years we've been going we've toured around most of the
country. Prague used to be excellent but the rowdy brit stag and hen culture
is taking the edge off it for us these days. Favourite places are Karlovy
Vary, Marianske Lazne, Cesky Budejovice (where they brew Budvar, the
original Budweiser) Liberec (well worth the visit just to stay at the Hotel
Jested http://www.jested.cz/web2005/hot-1-0-en.php ), the area around Lake
Lipno, Kromeriz and many more places but our absolute favourite place (maybe
we would even live there) is Cesky Krumlov.

&gt; I'm going back in January.

Oh yeah, know it well. We stayed there for three nights a couple of years
ago. The decor is pure 1960's (not surprising as it was built in the latter
half of the 60's) and brilliant, the food and drink are superb and cheap,
and the views are spectacular. Never stayed anywhere like it - it's quite
unique  :o)

Didn't know about the Russians buying the buildings - it doesn't really
surprise me but it is a great shame. We've seen a hell of a lot of changes
over the last 14 years and not all of them for the better, but that's
&quot;progress&quot; I suppose.

When my mam died a couple of years ago we inherited her house and we very,
very seriously considered selling both houses and moving to Cesky Krumlov
but, &quot;managing&quot; with the language but certainly nowhere near proficient
enough to live and work there, and being the wrong side of 50 with one or
two health issues, we realized that it just wasn't going to work. Maybe one
day though, because we truly do love the country and the people.

The Jested tower in Liberec, Czech Republic.

It's a TV transmitter, but it looks cool.

It's the Hotel Jested in Liberec, Czech Republic - but it's also a TV
transmitter as well. Have a look here
http://www.jested.cz/web2005/hot-1-0-en.php and look in the photo gallery
for the rooms and restaurant etc - brilliant place  :o)
