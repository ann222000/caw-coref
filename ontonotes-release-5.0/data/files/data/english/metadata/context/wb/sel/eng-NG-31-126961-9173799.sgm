Hi Viatologists,

Just a few moments ago, the Worldwide Highway Library was updated w/ this
video of California State Route 58:

http://worldwide-hwys.calrog.com/ca-58.wmv

Footage includes a sleepy two-lane stretch on a sunny afternoon.  This route
is helpful for central California motorists en route to southern Nevada.
The video's location is near Santa Margarita, and less than one kilometre
from US Federal Route 101.  Enjoy!

Cheers,

Carl Rogers

A few years ago I had several occasions when I had to be in the
Central Coast region of California. I drove to/from my Los Angeles
area home via CA-166, CA-58, CA-41, and CA-46 (and I-5, of course).

Of the four, CA-58 is the one that least deserves to be a state
highway.  It begins at a truly unimportant place, Santa Margarita; if
CA-58 didn't begin there, the place might not even have a name.  In a
rare bit of Truth in Advertising, Caltrans warns truckers that this
road is 'Not Advised'.  The portion of road (Calf Canyon Hwy) from
Santa Margarita to Wilson Corner (La Panza Road) is a narrow, winding
road that should never have been designated a state highway.  The next
portion of road (Carrisa Hwy) is a pleasant enough road that provides
access to the north end of the Carrizo Plain National Monument (which
includes Soda Lake).  Beyond the micro-town of Simmler, the highway
includes a series of switchbacks and hairpin curves crossing from San
Luis Obispo county to Kern county, then back to SLO before ending up
in Kern county on its way to its intersection with CA-33 near the
micro-town of McKittrick.

CA-46 is the straightest and fastest, except for the lack of passing
opportunities due to steady traffic.  CA-41 slants the wrong way for
me (in Los Angeles) but works fine for a Sacramento - San Luis Obispo
journey.

CA-166 is clearly my favorite of the four.  There are very few areas
where the Speed Limit 55 can't be driven safely or where the posted
speed limit is less than 55.  There are one or two places where you
could stop for a bathroom break before CA-33 (I didn't find any on
CA-58), and then a gas station or two in Maricopa at the northeast end
of the 14-mile CA-166/CA-33 multiplex before the 22-mile straightaway
to I-5.

IMHO, San Luis Obispo, as the county seat and the most important city
in SLO county, deserves more direct access to I-5 than CA-58 (9 miles
north) or CA-166 (28 miles south).  In my imaginary world, CA-223
(Bear Mountain Blvd) would be extended west across the moutains to
eventually intersect with CA-227 just south of San Luis Obispo.

I love it.  His narration is so tedious and banal he cuts himself off in the
editing process.  And his frame rate is so bad it's hard to watch.

Well, it *does* serve one important purpose, connecting to I-40 and I-15
just outside Barstow. But then, I think they should just extend I-40 all the
way to I-5.

Who's currently planning I-14?  Routing it eastward using FM 1960 won't
happen.  That corridor is saturated with retail business all the way from FM
529 to the Hardy Toll Road, and land costs east of US 59 in Humble wouldn't
be cheap...and that's before you try to route it around Dayton and Liberty,
let alone try and hook it up to I-10 in west Beaumont, which would require a
few major dislocations...going the other way, you'll need to rebuild the
expressway portion around the south side of Brenham, and route it around
Giddings and Elgin (keeping in mind the current widening of 290 to a dual
roadway between Elgin and Paige).  Then, you'll need to complete the
directional interchange at I-35 on the north side, and add some extra
capacity on I-35 through Austin down to Ben White Boulevard, which has the
north half of the stack complete at 35.  After that, some parts of 290
westward can be upgraded to freeway, but will need new alignments around
Dripping Springs, Johnson City, and Fredericksburg.  It's a nice idea, but if
it was started tomorrow, it wouldn't be completed before 2030, with all the
obstacles in the way.

Mind you, my IH 14 is a total fabrication, as is the rest of the page. Those

threw together a bunch of stuff I'd like to see.

Adobe Illustrator, mostly; though Inkscape will produce similar results.

In that case, no problem.  (Even if the I-14 AA Roads site mentions the
possibility of extensions to the speculated I-14 corridor that would take it
all the way west to El Paso, which would be a bit of overkill considering the
lack of inhabitants along the last 400 miles or so of the corridor. ;-)
