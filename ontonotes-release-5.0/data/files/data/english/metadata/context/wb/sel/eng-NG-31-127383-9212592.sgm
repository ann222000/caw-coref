Is the process of communicating through ASL analogous to a
translation? Let me give you an example.

Assume that I have a text T in English. A person A, conversant in
ASL, reads the text and communicates it to another person B on the fly in
ASL. B commits it to writing in English, producing a text T'.

My question is, How similar are T and T' likely to be? If we do
the same thing with, say, English and Russian, the final English text can
comically differ from the original English text - I guess you guys are
familiar with the story (apocryphal, but illustrative anyway) about &quot;The
spirit is strong but the flesh is weak&quot; being changed into &quot;The vodka is
good but the meat is rotten&quot; after following the English -&gt; Russian -&gt;
English route.

Is something like that possible in English -&gt; ASL -&gt; English?

Certainly. English and ASL are grammatically about as different as
languages can get -- they're practically at the extreme ends of
various typological continua.

Yes. But don't use &quot;effectively&quot;. ASL and English are two different
languages. They have different grammars, different ways of expressing
things, different idiomatic expressions. Different cultural background
too, because ASL is mostly used among the deaf, who are, well, _deaf_
and have for that reason a culture that is very different from that of
hearing people.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; language, right? How come that ASL is a totally different language?

Because ASL has developed among deaf people independently. It is not a
code for English, in the sense that written English is a kind of code
for spoken English.

Would

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; it not have been possible to map written English on to some sign system,
&gt; just as it is done with spoken English?
">

Of course it would have been possible, and such schemes have been
devised. In Finland, for example, we do have something that is called
&quot;viitottu suomi&quot;, i.e. &quot;signed Finnish&quot;. This is not the same as the
Finnish sign language, but a sign-language shorthand for spoken
Finnish, which follows the word order and grammar of Finnish.
According to the information I have had access to, it is perceived as
a stilted and unnatural language, but understood by deaf people
familiar with the Finnish sign language and having some knowledge of
Finnish. However, it is very different from the Finnish sign language
as used in spontaneous utterances among Finnish deaf people. In this
pure and native form, the Finnish sign language is entirely
independent of the Finnish language and not related to it at all.

(Update: such schemes as &quot;viitottu suomi&quot; are technically called
&quot;manually coded languages&quot; in English. And yes, there are manually
coded forms for English, too.)

I know that the mapping is in the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; reverse direction (spoken language precedes written language) but since
&gt; ASL is an artificial language, I wonder why the mapping as not done?

You are so wrong. ASL is not an artificial language. It is a natural
language which evolves naturally. It originated in a school for deaf
which was founded by Thomas H. Gallaudet, an American clergyman and a
pioneer educator of the deaf in the United States. His school taught
the French sign language as a standard sign language for all the deaf,
because Gallaudet had some sort of French connections. When all the
spontaneously originated sign languages that were brought by the
pupils from all around the United States were mixed with the French
sign language, a new sign language, the ASL, was created. This was a
spontaneous process and there is nothing whatsoever that is artificial
about it.

ASL is still to some extent mutually intelligible with the French sign
language. On the other hand, ASL is entirely unrelated to the British
Sign Language.

Is

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; there something in speech vs. signs that prevents it?
">

No, there is something in one language vs. another language that
prevents it. ASL and English are different languages. A manually coded
English is essentially not the same language as ASL proper.

I think it much less likely.

As for the example above, it is not so odd.

I have heard of a Hungarian poet producing a series of
successive &quot;translations&quot; between Hungarian and German.

Because ASL has nothing to do with English. It developed out of French

Wikipedia (I know, the bad word) suggests that French Sign Language
evolved naturally among the deaf in Paris, and was then adopted by
French deaf educators and standardized for educational purposes.

Of course it is wrong. ASL started to develop when an American school
for deaf people taught its pupils French sign language. This was mixed
among the pupils with their natural sign languages - such as the one
which naturally evolved in Martha's Vineyard, where there was a big
community of deaf people, because one of the founders of the place
happened to be deaf - for genetic, hereditary reasons. The sign
language which naturally evolved from this mixture is called ASL.

FSL was a natural growth among Parisian deaf. A pioneer of deaf
education, abbé Charles Michel de l'Épée, noted its existence and
started to teach it in his influential schools for the deaf. He seems
to have influenced the language to some extent, because he had his own
ideas about how to &quot;refine&quot; it into a cultural language, which
influenced the language to the extent that modern FSL is probably
somewhat different from the natural growth that was recorded by him.

ASL is certainly not artificial in the sense Esperanto is. It was not

It has been done, but it is a thing that is different from sign
language proper. Native &quot;speakers&quot; (or native signers) of ASL make use
of that sort of alphabet in order to insert English words into their
colloquial discourse very much in the same way as speakers of other
languages might use English or other outlandish words for special
effects. This sort of Anglicisms can then be telescoped into new
gestures, which will be &quot;English loanwords&quot; in ASL, or maybe slang

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; languages can get -- they're practically at the extreme ends of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; various typological continua.

&gt; &gt;&gt;         So, a person who uses ASL for communicating, instead of
&gt; &gt;&gt;         ordinary

&gt; &gt; No, they _are_ using two different languages.

&gt; &gt;&gt;         If I speak English and write in English, I am using the same

You are correct that it is a complicated situation. When deaf children
learn to write English, they are typically learning it as a foreign
language. But as you've seen earlier in the thread, the development of
ASL was not as a solution-by-committee to a problem, &quot;Let's give deaf
people a language they can use that will be an encoding of English.&quot; SEE
was the attempt to do that; native ASL speakers have no interest in it,
because they already have a language.

Well, that is an entirely different discussion, and we have had it
already. But you are essentially right that when a committee-devised
language &quot;goes native&quot; among a community of speakers  and starts to
develop in its own direction, it will soon be as natural as they come
- at least in the course of a couple of generations of native speakers.

Oh, you want a difference with no distinction!

Clearly, the two are different.  Neither Zamenhof nor Okrand had a
need to communicate: Zamenhof was apparently multilingual.  The
absence of a universally knowl language didn't in any practical sense
impede him communicating.  Okrand already spoke fluently one of the
most widely spoken languages in the universe (he certainly hadn't met
any Klingons).  Klingon was created from resources Okrand knew of as a
linguist in a matter of months.  How long did the English speaking
community take to get to Modern English?  Where did they start from?

I don't know why you want to say that constructed languages aren't
artificial and then set up a contrast between &quot;real&quot; and artificial.
In linguistics the relevant contrast is _natural_ vs artificial.
Klingon, Esperanto and Lojban etc are not natural languages.  To
conflate the natural and artificial languages you just gloss over the
difference between the process by which some linguist (amateur or
otherwise) makes up a language out of whole cloth and the
extraordinarily social process by which language develops (and we just
don't know about the very earliest moments of that process).  If you
want to say that what Zamenhof and Okrand have done is anything like
what goes on in the long process of unplanned and undirected
development of natural languages then I don't think you'll understand
either process in the end.

The &quot;committee&quot; does not know all of the characteristics of human
language (neither do the linguists), so whatever they come up with
will not have all the characteristics of human language.

Moreover, the &quot;committee&quot; usually knows little or nothing of the
characteristics of human language, so what they come up with will have
very few of the characteristics of human language.

Whereas, when an infant recreates a human language in its mind, it
can't help doing it right!

Well, as far as I know, the Parisian sign language that was

As I understand it, it is happening with Esperanto. There being native
speakers among the community for whom what to me is a marginally
interesting constructed auxlang is actually their perfectly natural
mother tongue.

&gt;Oh, you want a difference with no distinction!

&gt;Clearly, the two are different.  Neither Zamenhof nor Okrand had a
&gt;need to communicate: Zamenhof was apparently multilingual.  The
&gt;absence of a universally knowl language didn't in any practical sense
&gt;impede him communicating.  Okrand already spoke fluently one of the
&gt;most widely spoken languages in the universe (he certainly hadn't met
&gt;any Klingons).  Klingon was created from resources Okrand knew of as a
&gt;linguist in a matter of months.  How long did the English speaking
&gt;community take to get to Modern English?  Where did they start from?

&gt;I don't know why you want to say that constructed languages aren't
&gt;artificial and then set up a contrast between &quot;real&quot; and artificial.
">

I never said they weren't artificial -- only positing that there is no
real distinction between natural and artificial languages. Both come
from the same place in the human mind, the one that desires to
communicate with others and that can do this via spoken language. Or
signed language, as the case may be.

The only distinction to be made is that some languages developped
&quot;naturally&quot; over a period of time, while the others were created, in
whole cloth, out of the linguistically imaginative portions of a
single creator. Given that individuals and committees also influence
natural languages, to the extent that they may become _unnatural_,
argues against there being a pure dichotomy. Many major languages have
Academies that oversee language use and lexical development. Latin is
a good example of a language that has been artificially preserved.
Sanskrit and ancient Greek, too. Anyone who uses these languages is
_not_ using a pure naturally evolved language.

What I am saying is that there is a continuum, ranging from totally
free range languages to entirely laboratory grown languages.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In linguistics the relevant contrast is _natural_ vs artificial.
&gt;Klingon, Esperanto and Lojban etc are not natural languages.  To
&gt;conflate the natural and artificial languages you just gloss over the
&gt;difference between the process by which some linguist (amateur or
&gt;otherwise) makes up a language out of whole cloth and the
&gt;extraordinarily social process by which language develops (and we just
&gt;don't know about the very earliest moments of that process).  If you
&gt;want to say that what Zamenhof and Okrand have done is anything like
&gt;what goes on in the long process of unplanned and undirected
&gt;development of natural languages then I don't think you'll understand
&gt;either process in the end.
">

I understand quite well, thank you. The result is the same: a vehicle
for human communication. Of course, not all constructed languages are
_designed_ to be human languages. You brought up Klingon, and that is
an example of an artist creating a language he thinks is alien in
nature. Esperanto is a perfectly mundane human language. It is
certainly artificial, and the process of its creation is certainly not
like the process that has led to English. No conlanger can afford to
spend several millenia tweaking here and there. He has to cram those
millenia of changes and developments into the space of a couple
decades. It can be done very well.

Well, in this newsgroup other people than Padraic have repeatedly
suggested that &quot;natural language&quot; means the uncultivated dialect of a
monolingual (probably even illiterate) speaker, and that only the
study of this kind of language can be called linguistics. This

The corollary is, that written, literary and standardized languages

I hadn't thought to address the question of whether it can be done

to point out that they have a very different ontogenisis than natural
languages.  Since you don't believe there's any difference we won't

exist.  Why not?  Their parents talked to them in a certain language,
so of course they learned it.  Did they then reach out to share a more
natural Esperanto?  That could certainly happen, but there doesn't
seem to be a record of it.  I don't know why.  Others known to use
Esperanto, not  denaskuloj at all, have in their tiny, perhaps
diminishing, worldwide numbers continued to polish it.  (They polish
it; I just sort of smudge it.)

Esperanto is artificial (as ASL, by the way, emphatically is not). But
all language is to some extent artificial and to some extent natural.
Anything distinctive that I do with language, in any language, is
artificial in the sense that one identifiable person has done it.  And
anyone who purports to invent an artificial language is only building
on the inherited human ability to make language.  That's why Esperanto
seems so familiar to those who learn it, especially to speakers of
Indo-European languages.  It's just a language, with to be sure an
unusual history and unusual claims attached to it.

All spelling affects is the spelling. It doesn't alter anything about
the way the language is used and how it develops. Linguists aren't all

The parents, by definition, were not native speakers of Esperanto, and
presumably their native languages differ (otherwise, why would they be
forced to resort to Esperanto?) Thus the input available to the infant
is both inconsistent (being affected differently by the different
native languages), incomplete (being a second language), and imperfect
(being an artificial language, thus by definition not a perfect analog
of human language, simply because we do not have an adequate

What an infant does when its environment contains only imperfect,
incomplete input (typically a pidgin) is create a creole, and creoles
have typical features that presumably represent the features of human
language &quot;out of the box&quot; without any of the idiosyncrasies of
existing languages.

(The reason the child of immigrants to, say, the US whose parents
speak only heavily accented English doesn't speak accented English is
that the child is surrounded by an environment of native speakers,
which becomes the primary input into its language acquisition process.
Presumably there is no significant Esperanto-speaking environment for
the child to grow up in.)

Every time you open your mouth and say something you didn't memorize
from somewhere else, you are engaged in &quot;linguistic creativity&quot; --
you're saying something that was never said before. That is not
artificial; that is natural -- one of the essential properties of
human language.

Now when you sit down to compose a poem, carefully choosing your words
and structures, planning them in advance, maybe even writing them
down, or to write persuasive prose, or dialogue that won't seem
artifical on the page, then _that's_ artificial.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; With due respect to the wee folk, I think denaskuloj (from-birth guys)
&gt; are not necessary to explain Esperanto, at least not necessary in the
&gt; same way that leprechauns are needed to explain Ireland and menehune
&gt; to explain Hawaii. It shouldn't be surprising that some denaskuloj
&gt; exist.  Why not?  Their parents talked to them in a certain language,
&gt; so of course they learned it.
">

Children usually get to understand their parent's way of speaking (if
they are not adopted), but the speech of other children is more
important for the way they choose to express themselves. Children
often do not learn to speak language the way their parents do, even if
they understand each other.

You can't assume that there are different languages, just because
Human language is diverse enough to be mutually incomprehensible at
times. At first glance, it looks as if there are lots of different
languages on Earth, but if &quot;looks as if&quot; is a good argument, then the
Earth is flat.

What does it mean to &quot;polish a language&quot;? It it what Shakespeare did
to English and Goethe to German? In that case the creation of artistic
works proceeds by exploring the potentials of Human language, not by
creating language.

No, it's usually not defined that way. Natural language is part of any
sane person, whether or not his specific ways of using it has been
described. Artificial languages (note the plural) must be described
before they can be used, and they are used for other purposes than
natural language (note the singular). Esperanto is a specific way of
using Human language, and so is ASL. There might be two closely
related natural languages, spoken and signed, but it's safer to assume
that they are essentially the same in the brain and only diverge at
spell-out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And anyone who purports to invent an artificial language is only

A normal Homo sapiens does not have the ability to live _without_
language. He doesn't make it, he is born with it and may use his time
exploring it deeper than biology demands. You cannot really make a
distinction between a dialect of Human and the other things that the
speakers of that dialect have in common.

It's less than a language, it's one name for language among thousands.
And it's more than language; Esperanto is like all other speech
communities in actually _being_ its history and the claims and customs
that go with it. If you reduce Esperanto (or English, Irish or
whatever) to the pure language part, then nothing specific remains;
only the Human language is left. On the other hand, if you want to add
anything specific in order to delimit Esperanto (or English, Irish...)
from other languages, then something non-linguistic will inevitably
creep in.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;ASL is certainly not artificial in the sense Esperanto is. It was not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;devised by a person or a committee, it was created by the community of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;deaf people in America.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kind of stretches the borders of both &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;artificial&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lannguage. What's the real difference between a &quot;committee&quot;, which
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; produces an &quot;artificial language&quot;, and a &quot;community&quot;, which produces a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;natural language&quot;? I'd posit that there's no real difference.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, that is an entirely different discussion, and we have had it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; already. But you are essentially right that when a committee-devised
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; language &quot;goes native&quot; among a community of speakers  and starts to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; develop in its own direction, it will soon be as natural as they come
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; - at least in the course of a couple of generations of native speakers.-

&gt;&gt; &gt;That's what might happen, but do you have an example?

&gt;&gt; As I understand it, it is happening with Esperanto. There being native
&gt;&gt; speakers among the community for whom what to me is a marginally
&gt;&gt; interesting constructed auxlang is actually their perfectly natural
&gt;&gt; mother tongue.

&gt;Now you'll have Peter Daniels and Chris Culver all over you insisting
&gt;that Esperanto is not, cannot, will never be anybody's mother tongue,

So? They're entitled to their opinion.

A sad attitude, indeed. It would be like musicologists flat out
refusing to even consider computer gereated / electronic music as real
music. I'm sure there are such dinosaurs around, but they are missing
out on a whole fascinating aspect of music. Same here. Sure, Esperanto
is not a natural language -- but it _is_ a language, is used as a
language and is learned as a native language by at least some people.
Also, it must come from somewhere. The whole idea of language
creation, and the products of that endeavour, should be highly
interesting to linguistics.
