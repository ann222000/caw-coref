It seems that almost all galaxies spin counter-clockwise. What forces in the visible universe caused this uniformity? No
god or other supernatural responses please.

If you go around to the other side, they are turning counter
clockwise.

You mean clockwise.  So how does this answer my
question? Are we only viewing from one side in most cases?
Why? Is it like a hurricane that spins depending on
its hemisphere?

The last time I looked at the back of a clock the hands were turning
counter-clockwise.
It seems you are dreaming.

Where did you get that information?  The last I'd
heard, galaxy orientation was essentially random.

They found one that spins opposite from most according

Well now, by the IR light  M 106 is clearly going counter-clockwise
and by the X-ray light it is going clockwise.

It depends from which side you look at them. The true question is where
does the spinning come from?

It would be a lot more surprising if they weren't spinning ;-)

Okay, I looked at the blurb at:

http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2002/03/

It doesn't state that galaxies mostly turn
counterclockwise (whatever that would mean,
since direction of rotation depends upon the
location of the observer).  What it says is
that its direction of rotation happens to
coincide with the direction in which the
ends of the outer spiral arms are pointing.

I suppose that intuitively people might assume
that a galaxy would rotate in a direction that
would wrap the arms about the center so that the
arms would 'tighten' inwards.  This would roughly
correspond to the way water spirals down a drain.
As the arms are thought to be density waves, I
don't think that such a restriction would
necessarily apply.

Thank you for the clarification. It is good to see
an astronomy question directly answered. What
density wave characteristics cause the standard
rotation and what force could change that
in rare  cases?(if we can surmise)

The wave doesn't cause the rotation, that remains
from the angular momentum of the material that
formed the galaxy. The wave moves round the galaxy
and can move in the opposite direction to the
rotation. Throw a pebble in a stream and ripples
can move upstream as well as down.

I can't help with what causes the difference, I
think that is still being studied.
