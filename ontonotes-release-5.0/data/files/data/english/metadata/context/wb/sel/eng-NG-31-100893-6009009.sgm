The word socialism is derived from 'society'.

Society

1. an organized group of persons associated together for religious,
benevolent, cultural, scientific, political, patriotic, or other purposes.

2. a body of individuals living as members of a community; community.

Societies come in many flavors.  No particular monetary system or
economy is associated with 'society'.

Socialism

1. a theory or system of social organization that advocates the vesting
of the ownership and control of the means of production and
distribution, of capital, land, etc., in the community as a whole.

2. procedure or practice in accordance with this theory.

3. (in Marxist theory) the stage following capitalism in the transition
of a society to communism, characterized by the imperfect implementation
of collectivist principles.

And so, we can see that socialism is the attempt to intertwine
the customs, traditions and values of a society with an
autocratic governing structure resulting in a sort of atheistic
theocracy.

Capitalism? Capitalism is not a social system nor is it a government.
It is a means and method of structuring a monetary and
banking system that relies on private capital and investment.

Capitalism is adaptable to various types of societies and governing
structures.

You're welcome.

Capitalism consists mostly of private ownership of the means of
production and lightly regulated or unregulated markets for exchanging
the items (and services) produced. Capitalism is totally at odds with
the collective ownership of land and the means of production. Capitalism
is totally at odds with the Command Economy. Goods and services are
produced when and where there are the means of production and the
opportunity to profit.

The only issues with capitalism are the production of public goods,
where a good or service is necessary but making a profit is difficult or
impossible. Example: Light houses. How do you charge the captain of a
ship at sea for using the light from your lighthous. Answer: you can't.
The other issue is regulating markets to prevent fraud and misleading
practices. How stringent shall that regulation be? This is both an
economic and a political issue.

Here's another way of looking at it: Socialism operates in the plane
of politics and marketing; Capitalism operates in the plane of
economics and finance. They don't even use the same variables (or language).

Show me an example of a society "governing itself" on anything larger
than the village-scale. You'll find that your definition of socialism
collapses into statism in short order when going upscale.

Besides, a "society governing itself" would be anarchism, but it could
be both anarcho socialism and anarcho capitalism. The first is a
fleeting dream, the latter volatile and rather unstable, if historic
evidence is an indication.

Although a society may be capitalist, such a
society is not self-governed; but rather, a
capitalist society is governed by capital, or by a
political state that is influenced by capital.

Socialists believe that a society which is under
the authority of capital, or under the dominion of
the state, is a poor and faulty society, weak and
lame, frail and fragile, powerless and spiritless,
disabled and deformed, etc.  Also, socialists
believe that a class-divided society is not a
genuine, natural society.

&gt; that advocates the vesting of the ownership and

&gt; community as a whole. . . .

Ron Allen answers:
Please notice that socialism is about vesting
ownership and control of the means of production
and of distribution in the community as a whole.
In other words, capitalism is about vesting
ownership and control of the means of production,
etc., in a class within the community, a class of
proprietors, a minority class, a capitalist class.
In a socialist society, capital no longer has the
attribute of being private property, and so it is
usually said by socialists that capital as private
property ceases to exist.  In other words, capital
ceases to exist, because by definition capital is
private property.  What was capital under the rule
of capitalism will not longer have the peculiarity
of capital under capitalism.  When capital as
private property is socialized, capital as private
property ceases to exist.  Socialized capital is
not private capital, and so there are those who
prefer to say that capital no longer exists in a
socialist society.  Some do not see private
property as an essential property of capital, and
so they have no problem calling socialized and
democratized capital "capital".

There are other aspects of capital that are seen
as essential to the meaning of capital.  For
example, capital has the attribute of producing an
income for the proprietor.  As labor earns a wage,
so capital is seen to generate an income -- i.e.,
a profit, which is not an income earned by labor,
but an unearned income generated by ownership.
Another attribute of capital, under a capitalist
régime, is that capital employs labor; whereas
under a socialist system, labor employs capital.

The expression "community as a whole" points to
the democratic aspect of socialism.  In other
words, a socialist believes that democracy is
the socialization of the means of government, and
that a true democracy can only exist when both
industry and government are socialized and
democratized.  For the socialist, socialization
and democratization are equivalent expressions for
the same social relations.  Unless politics are
democratic, economics cannot be; and unless the
economy is democratic, politics cannot be truly
democratic.

Thank you.

However, not everyone can agree with your
assertion that capitalism is not a social system,
or that capitalism is not a government.  If the
capitalist system is a means and method of
structuring money and banking, of managing and
directing capital and investment, then surely
capitalism is a social system governed by a
national state.  Really-existing capitalism is
what socialists condemn; just as really-existing
socialism is what capitalists condemn.

Capitalist models of libertarian anarchism see
freedom as both anti-democratic and anti-
egalitarian, and this agrees with the existing
status quo.  Libertarian and anarchist capitalists
dislike democracy and politics.  These capitalists
believe that producers ought to be excluded from
political power, and this is seen as a good thing,
an ideal arrangement.

Ron Allen answers:
Selfishness is not the only nature or attribute of
human beings.  We tend to be selfish for two basic
reasons.  The first reason for human selfishness
is material scarcity.  When there is scarcity, we
compete and we skirmish for what we need, or for
what we think we need.  The struggle to survive is
a dogfight.  The other reason for human greed and
selfishness is a combination of habit and of hope.
For so long now we have been contesting and
quarreling for scarce resources, and we have been
taught to hope for nothing better than scarcity.
The dominance of selfishness is not our first
nature; it is our second nature.  Our first
nature, our true nature, our human essence, is
both freedom and fellowship, both freedom and
friendship.  When we enjoy material abundance,
when we expect material abundance, then we have a
tendency to curtail selfishness and greed, and we
have a tendency to enlarge those graces, habits,
and manners which promote a more sociable and
amiable life.  When we can afford to be generous,
we tend to be less greedy.  When we can afford to
be more altruistic, we tend to be less avaricious.

Ron Allen answers:
I do not agree with this appraisal of things.

We need to figure out a good way to do democratic-
socialism.  We need to find a better way, the best
way, to do democratic-socialism right.  If we seek
the better way, I believe that we can find it.  We
are social animals; we are political animals; and
we are problemsolving animals.

We are social beings, and we are social creatures.
We are the creations of the society we live in.
If we live in a selfish and greedy society, then
we will be the selfish creatures, the greedy
creations of such a society.  If we seem to be
more selfish than selfless, then we are the
creations of a selfish social environment.  We
have adapted ourselves to a selfish milieu.  We
have adapted to this milieu in order to survive
and prosper.

Ron Allen answers:
We already have a material solution to the problem
of material scarcity, thanks to capitalism's own
encouragement of industrial development and of
technological progress.  Of course, capitalism can
not, and will not solve the problem of material
scarcity, largely because scarcity is itself the
very backbone of profiteering capitalism.  In
other words, the material productive forces of
modern society already exist, thanks in part to
capitalism, but largely thanks to the unique human
ability to both see and solve problems.  However,
the existing capitalist relations of production
have become the fetters acting to curb the
material forces of production.  Capitalism creates
both prosperity and poverty.  It is because
capitalism has stimulated the creation of massive
industry and large-scale production that the very
existing of poverty has now become an artificial
hold over from previous times.  The solution has
been offered, and that solution to the capitalist
relations of production is called democratic-
socialism.  If we socialize and democratize the
material productive forces of modern technological
society, then we will have removed the capitalist
relations of production which have served both to
expand, and to retard the forces of production.
The profiteering capitalist class harnesses the
forces of production, managing these forces so as
to tame productivity in order to maximize profits.

If capitalism cannot solve the problem of scarcity
and poverty, then capitalism ought to be made to
move out of the way, and let socialism solve these
problems.  Capitalism solved the problem of
creating surplus wealth; but, capitalism has not
solved the problem of scarcity and poverty.  This
is why capitalism has always appeared hand in hand
both with extreme wealth and extreme want.  This
antipodal reality is an aspect of capitalism's
manifold and manifest contradictions.

Human evolution has been as much an evolution of
human society as it has been an evolution of the
human species.  We associate precisely because we
need food, shelter, and security.  Because we must
associate, we also have evolved those necessary
attributes and gregarious virtues which make for
social unity.  Mutual respect and mutual regard
are important sociable qualities, serving to unite
us together.  We live together because we must
work together in order to survive and prosper.
We survive and prosper as individuals because we
survive and prosper as communities; and vice
versa.  Socialism is all about bringing back the
social virtues; socialism is all about exercising
and cultivating those social virtues which have
been repressed by life in class-divided societies,
in societies that have been all but dissolved by
internal competition and external warfare, by the
war of all against all (bellum omnium in omnes).

What you call "brainwashing" is what I call self-
education, moral edification, social development,
etc.  Besides, the brain needs to be washed from
all the idiocies we have been told and taught to
believe.  Samuel Langhorne Clemens ("Mark Twain")
once said that education "consists mainly in what
we have unlearned."  I suppose that Twain's
unlearning could be called a kind of brainwashing.
It seems to me that the word "brainwashing" does
not have to always connote or suggest something
that is mischievous or villainous.  Brainwashing
is itself a neutral word.  A moral education can
be as much a brainwashing as an immoral education.

If unregulated capitalism encourages corruption

and crime are so rampant in unregulated, laissez-
faire capitalism.  The liberal capitalist state
has evolved into an interventionist state, because
regulation and intervention are deemed necessary
in order to better settle and stabilize really-
existing liberal capitalism.

Corruption are crime are not natural or connatural
to human existence; but they are congenital and

It is your (mis)reading of what I believe that

The ideological capitalist anthropology is very
close to the calvinist anthropology in its belief
in the total depravity of human nature.  The
philosophical capitalist sees altruism, for
example, as if it were a supernatural, superhuman
grace.  As a philosophical humanist, the socialist
and the democrat sees altruism as a very natural
generosity, a very human attribute.

Although my concept of human moral freedom is
augustinian, my concept of human nature is more
pelagian.

&gt;&gt;Ron Allen answers:
&gt;&gt;We already have a material solution to the problem
&gt;&gt;of material scarcity, thanks to capitalism's own
&gt;&gt;encouragement of industrial development and of
&gt;&gt;technological progress.

&gt;   Bullshit, we do not live on Big Rock Candy Mountain
&gt; and never will.  Do you really think that we can all afford
&gt; space trips, the finest chocolate, the best computers
&gt; etc.?  Clearly we can't and the reason we can't isn't that
&gt; capitalism is not distributing the goods, it's been
&gt; distributing the goods more and more for a couple of
&gt; centuries.

&gt;&gt; Of course, capitalism can
&gt;&gt;not, and will not solve the problem of material
&gt;&gt;scarcity, largely because scarcity is itself the
&gt;&gt;very backbone of profiteering capitalism.  In
&gt;&gt;other words, the material productive forces of
&gt;&gt;modern society already exist, thanks in part to
&gt;&gt;capitalism, but largely thanks to the unique human
&gt;&gt;ability to both see and solve problems.

&gt;  And yet when the &quot;material productive forces&quot; are
&gt; seized somehow they don't create the prosperity
&gt; capitalism did, and you don't know how to make them.

&gt;&gt; However,
&gt;&gt;the existing capitalist relations of production
&gt;&gt;have become the fetters acting to curb the
&gt;&gt;material forces of production.  Capitalism creates
&gt;&gt;both prosperity and poverty.  It is because
&gt;&gt;capitalism has stimulated the creation of massive
&gt;&gt;industry and large-scale production that the very
&gt;&gt;existing of poverty has now become an artificial
&gt;&gt;hold over from previous times.  The solution has
&gt;&gt;been offered, and that solution to the capitalist
&gt;&gt;relations of production is called democratic-
&gt;&gt;socialism.

&gt;   Which you cannot even describe let alone implement.
&gt; Pretending that the resources availible to man are infinite
&gt; or would be in your paradise is not a convincing argument.
&gt; particularly when you yourself have argued that people will
&gt; need to limit their &quot;needs&quot; in it.

&gt;&gt; If we socialize and democratize the
&gt;&gt;material productive forces of modern technological
&gt;&gt;society, then we will have removed the capitalist
&gt;&gt;relations of production which have served both to
&gt;&gt;expand, and to retard the forces of production.
&gt;&gt;The profiteering capitalist class harnesses the
&gt;&gt;forces of production, managing these forces so as
&gt;&gt;to tame productivity in order to maximize profits.

&gt;&gt;If capitalism cannot solve the problem of scarcity
&gt;&gt;and poverty, then capitalism ought to be made to
&gt;&gt;move out of the way, and let socialism solve these
&gt;&gt;problems.  Capitalism solved the problem of
&gt;&gt;creating surplus wealth; but, capitalism has not
&gt;&gt;solved the problem of scarcity and poverty.

&gt;   It has for a great number of people, the fact that it
&gt; hasn't done it for everybody is due to the time factor
&gt; and the intervention of ruthless and clueless States.

&gt;&gt;This is why capitalism has always appeared hand in hand
&gt;&gt;both with extreme wealth and extreme want.

&gt;   And yet there is less extreme want and less extreme wealth
&gt; in Capitalism than in any other industrialised system I know
&gt; of and far less than under absolutist monarchy.

&gt;&gt; This antipodal reality is an aspect of capitalism's
&gt;&gt;manifold and manifest contradictions.

&gt;&gt;Human evolution has been as much an evolution of

&gt;&gt;associate, we also have evolved those necessary
&gt;&gt;attributes and gregarious virtues which make for
&gt;&gt;social unity.  Mutual respect and mutual regard
&gt;&gt;are important sociable qualities, serving to unite
&gt;&gt;us together.  We live together because we must
&gt;&gt;work together in order to survive and prosper.
&gt;&gt;We survive and prosper as individuals because we
&gt;&gt;survive and prosper as communities; and vice
&gt;&gt;versa.  Socialism is all about bringing back the
&gt;&gt;social virtues; socialism is all about exercising
&gt;&gt;and cultivating those social virtues which have
&gt;&gt;been repressed by life in class-divided societies,
&gt;&gt;in societies that have been all but dissolved by
&gt;&gt;internal competition and external warfare, by the
&gt;&gt;war of all against all (bellum omnium in omnes).

Homo Sapien Sapien (that is us) has been around may 250,000 years. Some

improved reproductive fitness. In fact universal altruism will render
the species ripe for destruction if a more rapacious species would
interact with us.

Rabbi Hillel summed it up elegantly:

If I am not for myself who is for me?
If I am only for myself, what am I?
If not now, then when?

Our survival and prosperity has come from a balance of kin altruism and
individual adventure and selfishness. That is how we have progressed
from living in caves to living in tall buildings.

That is kin altruism at work. The early hunters were related to each
other. And I believe I addressed the matter of kin altruism. Read what I
wrote again. Then hum to yourself -- We are Family--.

When people are mostly strangers to each other, they are not as likely
to co-operate. However there are notable exceptions. During the 1988
earthquake in Oakland, perfect strangers immediately started to form
teams to help people trapped by the collapse of the I880 freeway. That
was a remarkable display of selfless teamwork. It was glorious. But it
takes an earthquake to make it happen. In normal life, people are a bit
reluctant to trust strangers and co-operation usually comes mixed with a
good payoff for co-operating. It is not altruistic co-operation, rather
it is calculated.

Of course nobody is willing to work into a cooperative just for fun, as

than working for an owner. People will be more motivated, as mater of fact
business owners working for themselves are much more motivated than any of
their employees. This is actually what I am advocating. A strong
encouragement, including incentives and some protection for people to get
in business for their own.

I know many independent consultants that dropped out from consulting and

state of economy make many to consider the healthcare and 401k they get as
employee to be quite important to keep them from taking the risk again.
In meantime, they stay into a job they dislike, are severely underworked
(produce much less) and severely underpayed compared with their real value.
They waste their time and talent sitting 9 to 6 into a job where they are
demotivated.
Many may consider to go back in consulting if an universal healthcare and
retirement system were implemented so they get all the benefits
continuously even if they are not under a contract, and pay for them as
taxes when they get a good contract. In the end, an obsolete system is
hurting them, the companies and the economy as a whole. The issue must be

That's not
a good argument for subsidising something because the thing isn't worth
doing.

What issue?  That people are employed in a manner you don't think

&gt; When has anarchism been unstable in Somalia (or

Ron Allen answers:
Would someone please tell me where and when an
American experiment in anarcho-capitalism took
place?

In my opinion, an anarchist (not an anarcho-
capitalist) experiment cannot be stable or secure
if it is surrounded by a militaristic and
expansionist capitalist state.  Anarchism in one
solitary community cannot succeed or endure as
long as it is bound and besieged by a larger
authoritarian and confrontational society.

Unregukated capitalism is tantamount to anarcho capitalism. Since
corruption is commonly defined as private individuals or organisatios
that affect politicisn ith their money and interests, we can conclude
that there will me NO corruption in a society of unregulated capitalism.

"Regulated capitalism" is a eufemism for a state corrupted my special

What do I misread? You propose a severely redistributionist no-state
society. IOW; you cant the percieved advantages of a socialist state,

Funny, that is the typical Socialist schtick against capitalism, free
markets and free choice. Individuals are, according to socialists,
basically flawed and corrupt, and this we need the enlightened
socialists to force us to be nice to each other. :p

No, I don't. There is clearly a degree of altruism in our evolved
