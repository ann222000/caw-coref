* RSS - The &quot;Sangh&quot;
* *What is it, and what is it not?*
**
by Partha Banerjee

&quot;Jesus is junk. It is high time for Hindus to learn that Jesus Christ
symbolizes no spiritual power, or moral uprightness. He is no more than an
artifice for legitimizing wanton imperialist aggression. The aggressors have
found him to be highly profitable so far. By the same token, Hindus should
know that Jesus means nothing but mischief for their country and culture.&quot;1
*The above was recently said by a prominent leader and theorist of RSS or
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteer Corps), in a treatise on
Jesus Christ.*

Dr. K. B. Hedgewar floated the organization in 1925 on the Hindu holy day
of Vijaya Dashami (the triumphant tenth day of the moon) in the
Maharashtrian city of Nagpur. According to Hindu mythology, this is the day
when in a holy war, Lord Rama, the God king, triumphed over Ravana &quot;the
demon king&quot;. The Sangh and its offspring organizations such as the BJP have
successfully used the name of Rama as a ploy to garner Hindu votes and drum
up anti-Muslim hatred. In addition to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi,
the RSS, Jana Sangh (now known as BJP), and VHP or Vishwa Hindu Parishad
have been implicated in numerous communal riots all over India.2 RSS now has
two other important offshoots Bajrang Dal (a militant auxiliary of VHP) and
Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram, the organization targeted to include the tribals in
its fold.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the parliamentary leader of BJP, is a lifelong member
of RSS, more commonly known as the &quot;Sangh&quot;. Most leaders and active members
of BJP are products of the Sangh and steeped in its Hindu supremacist
doctrine. Vajpayee was a full-time RSS worker before he was &quot;released&quot; for
BJP (formerly Jana Sangh) activities. In one of his Hindi poems, Vajpayee
proclaims: &quot;Hindu Hindu mera parichay&quot;-my only identity is Hindu. This may
remind us of his campaign speeches during the recent Indian elections, &quot;Is
it a crime to be a Hindu in this country?&quot;3 One can perceive the same Hindu
Vajpayee only with refined rhetoric and a display of moderation-very similar
to the recently toned-down functioning style of BJP itself.
The meteoric rise of BJP is now all but certain to usher in an era of more
social and political pressures for the traditionally oppressed-the
&quot;untouchables&quot;, the religious minorities, and women. BJP's ally Shiv Sena
(SS) and its leader Bal Thackeray have been openly supportive of racist and
oppressive social codes. Thackeray said that democracy is not for India and
what Indians need is a &quot;benign dictatorship.&quot; BJP's important home minister
Advani is now actively touting a presidential form of government replacing
the present prime ministerial system-an alarming proposition that
foreshadows an authoritarian rule.

BJP leaders like Vijaya Raje Scindia, the queen-mother of the royal family
of Gwalior favor the now-outlawed &quot;sati&quot; system (&quot;sati&quot; was a horrible
practice where the widow was burnt along with her dead husband) and the
degenerate Hindu caste system where Brahmans and other upper castes remain
the leaders of the society, keeping the lower castes and &quot;untouchables&quot; in
abject poverty, subservience, and death. Even though M. S. Golwalkar and
Balasaheb Deoras, the second and third supreme leaders of the RSS, spoke
against the caste system in its &quot;degenerate form&quot;, they did not espouse its
abolition.4 The theory and practice of caste differences is very much in
vogue in RSS and its offshoot bodies, although, in order to bring together
Hindus of all castes under its artificially-created &quot;unity platform&quot;, a
unifying theme of hatred for Islam and other &quot;foreign&quot; religions has been
deliberately brought in. &quot;Lower caste&quot; legendary heroes such as Birsa have
recently been included in the RSS Ekatmata Stotra (the verse of unification)
to garner support among the dalits, &quot;forest-dwellers&quot;, and other oppressed
classes of the society.5
In order to learn about the BJP, the rising star of Indian politics, one
must examine the RSS with an open mind. Most secular and progressive
Indians, and those who do not have any particular political faith, either do
not know much about the RSS and its modus operandi or because of a
preoccupied mind, refuse to recognize them. To me, this ignorance or
rejection is the very thing that has allowed the rapid growth of the Sangh
organizations. We must defeat the RSS in its own game-its
supremacist-divisive Hindutva doctrine must be countered with the secular
and all-inclusive version of Hinduism which is the religion of Sri
Chaitanya, Ram Mohan Ray, Ramakrishna Paramhansa, and Bhakt Kabir. The Sangh
Parivar's doctrine of separatism and supremacy must be exposed by drawing
parallels between them and other social-religious fundamentalist groups that
fiercely fight with each other. Only then, their global bigotry and deceit
can be truly assessed and dealt with.

*Mahatma Gandhi was murdered by an RSS member-and that is the common belief*

On the 30th of January 1948, within less than a year of the Indian
independence, Nathuram Godse, a Hindu zealot from the western Indian state
of Maharashtra, shot and killed Mahatma Gandhi at a prayer meeting in Delhi.
Nathuram Godse was a prominent member of the RSS and a close associate of
its founder Dr. K. B. Hedgewar. Just before the assassination, however,
Godse &quot;left&quot; the RSS and joined another Hindu supremacist group Hindu
Mahasabha.

*So, why was the Sangh not convicted in Gandhi assassination?*

RSS was never officially implicated and convicted in the murder of Mahatma
Gandhi because, among other reasons, Nathuram Godse could not conclusively
be proven to be an RSS member. This apparently bizarre conclusion was
possible because of RSS' non-existent membership roster and the absence of
any internal documented proceedings of Sangh activities or meetings. At the
time of the assassination, the Sangh did not even have a constitution-this
was after twenty three years of its public existence! 6

RSS mobilizes workers into its different fronts. Other than the BJP, the
Sangh mentors its cadres for its education front Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi
Parishad (ABVP). Industry-based cadres are sent to organize the labor front,
Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), and the more gray-haired and often rich
workers from the business world move into the powerful well-financed
religious wing, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) or the World Hindu Council.
Although very much in the fray of capturing unions through electioneering
(and hooliganism), both ABVP and BMS claim to be non-political.7

*RSS, Shiv Sena, and their admiration of fascism*

Dr. Hedgewar, the RSS founder, propounded the idea that national unity would
only come about if it was declared that all non-Hindus in India, such as
Muslims and Christians, do not form a part of the nation. This was because,
in his opinion, non-Hindus deny Hindu traditions, ideals, and culture.
Hedgewar indoctrinated this idea into his hand-picked protégé Madhavrao
Sadasivrao Golwalkar (more commonly known as Guruji-&quot;the teacher&quot;), again
from Nagpur.

The most comprehensive statement of this exclusionary idea was made in Mr.
Golwalkar's book &quot;We or Our Nationhood Defined&quot; published in 1938 8. The
pamphlet-like book has so many laudatory references to Hitler and his
theories of racial supremacy that it became embarrassingly uncomfortable for
the RSS to continue its publication and was soon withdrawn from circulation.
It would be worthwhile to cite a few excerpts here:

&quot;German race pride has now become the topic of the day. To keep up the
purity of the race and its culture, Germany shocked the world by her purging
the country of the Semitic races-the Jews. Race pride at its highest has
been manifested here. Germany has also shown how well-nigh impossible it is
for races and cultures, having differences going to the root, to be
assimilated into one united whole-a good lesson for us in Hindusthan (i.e.,
the land of Hindus) to learn and profit by.&quot;

This is the lesson the &quot;Guruji&quot; wants Sangh volunteers to learn: &quot;From this
standpoint sanctioned by the experience of shrewd old nations, the non-Hindu
peoples in Hindusthan must either adopt the Hindu culture and language, must
learn to respect and hold in reverence the Hindu religion, must entertain no
idea but the glorification of the Hindu race and culture, i.e., they must
not only give up their attitude of intolerance and ungratefulness towards
this land and its age-old traditions, but must also cultivate the positive
attitude of love and devotion instead; in one word, they must cease to be
foreigners or may stay in the country wholly subordinated to the Hindu
nation claiming nothing, deserving no privileges, far less any preferential
treatment, not even citizen's rights.&quot; 9

The Hindu Mahasabha leader Savarkar, a much-respected personality in RSS
circles, proclaimed,

&quot;If we Hindus grow stronger in time Moslem friends ...will have to play the
part of German Jews.&quot;10

&quot;We or Our Nationhood Defined&quot; was replaced by Golwalkar's &quot;Bunch of
Thoughts&quot;, now the Sangh &quot;Bible&quot;, in which an attempt has been made to
clothe the RSS's fascistic concept of nationhood in a religio-cultural garb.
11

The RSS and Hindu Mahasabha have always been fiercely anti-Muslim and
anti-Christian. Golwalkar went as far as to raise an objection when Abdul
Hamid and the Keelor brothers were honored by the Indian government for
their patriotism and gallantry during the Indo-Pak war. Golwalkar did not
want any non-Hindu soldiers to be honored however much they might have
sacrificed for India.12

The fiercely anti-Muslim attitude of the RSS goes to the extent of dubbing
even Urdu as a foreign language. &quot;The import and significance of the word
'Urdu' is so derogatory to national self-respect that it suppresses all
emotional upsurge in favor of the language. How and why should we own a
language the very name of which constantly reminds us of our political
subjugation? Hindu ancestors passed on Sanskrit and Hindi to their
descendants. They had nothing to do with the transmission of Urdu&quot;.13

The Sangh family's political ally Shiv Sena even today hail Hitler and Nazi
Germany. Shiv Sena's godman Bal Thackeray often eulogizes Hitler at public
gatherings and in interviews. In its quest for political power, the Sangh
naturally does not want to be a part of this &quot;nuisance&quot; any more. However,
it is yet to come out with a censure of Thackeray.

*First RSS, Jana Sangh, then BJP-then a turn of luck*

In 1951, RSS floated the Jana Sangh, its political wing, now known as the
BJP, to counter the rising public hatred resulting as a fallout of RSS'
involvement in Gandhi's assassination. It also wanted to have its voice
heard in the first Indian elections of 1952. M. S. Golwalkar put Dr. Shyama
Prasad Mukherjee, an ultra-nationalist and famous orator from the Bengal
Hindu Mahasabha, in charge of the Jana Sangh. Dr. Mukherjee was allegedly
murdered by the Congress Party or Sheikh Abdullah's14 party in a jail in
Kashmir, and later, Sangh activist Deendayal Upadhyay became the president
of the Jana Sangh. The unassuming and mild-mannered Upadhyay 15 was also
assassinated, again, allegedly by political rivals. Atal Bihari Vajpayee
then took over as the Jana Sangh president and carried the mantle for a long
and lonely decade. Jana Sangh came close to obliteration during the heydays
of Congress under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru and subsequently his
daughter Indira Gandhi. It was only the proclamation of the totalitarian
Emergency rule by Indira Gandhi in 1975 that gave a second breath of life to
Jana Sangh through its opportunistic alliance with other national opposition
parties. Imprisonment of forgotten personalities like Vajpayee and L. K.
Advani on Indira Gandhi's orders elevated them to national stardom. Indira
Gandhi, under the mistaken impression that her popular support was strong,
called for general elections in 1977. She and her Congress party were nearly
wiped out, largely due to a massive people's movement led by socialist
leader Jaya Prakash Narayan, and a hodgepodge coalition formed the
government. Vajpayee and Advani assumed important portfolios of the foreign
affairs and information-broadcasting ministers, respectively (a third
unknown BJP person Brijlal Verma assumed the important communication
ministry portfolio-even to many Sangh workers' surprise-this happened when
another Sangh stalwart Nana Deshmukh 16 declined the offer). Until then, few
could dream of such a turn of luck for these two career politicians and for
the BJP the new incarnation of the Jana Sangh.

*&quot;Guru-Dakshina&quot;, and tons of soft money too!*

Other than the enormous amount of money collected at the Guru-Dakshina
(charity for the guru, in this case, the saffron flag) day every year (which
goes largely unreported, and hence untaxed), RSS also reportedly generates
huge sums of money from its members and sympathizers abroad 17. Other than
contributing to election funds of BJP, they say, immigrant Sangh
sympathizers pay their &quot;Guru-Dakshina&quot; at various branches of the Hindu
Swayamsevak Sangh (HSS), the overseas version of RSS 18. Money is also
reportedly pumped in and out by other organizations such as the Overseas
Friends of BJP (OFBJP), VHP of America, and the Hindu Student Council or HSC
of America. Traditionally conservative but apolitical Hindu temples in USA
and Europe are now targeted by the Sangh in order to mobilize
second-generation Indian-American youth through organization of
VHP-sponsored Hindu summer camps and various religious conventions of HSC.
Under the guise of cultural education, a whole generation is being
indoctrinated to be blind, separatists, and bigots. Many Indian immigrants,
ignorant of the relationship of the VHP and HSC with BJP and RSS, are being
used to further the fascist-like sociopolitical agenda of the Sangh Parivar.

*The Rama Movement of the 90's-Vajpayee still wants the temple*

Unlike many other religious fundamentalist movements across the globe that
have a well-defined vision of the society they want to build, the Sangh's
vision of the Hindu Rashtra (nation) is purposefully vague. As RSS seeks to
extend its reach, its Hindu revivalist mission finds itself tangled with a
number of serious obstacles. The RSS' brahminical version of Hinduism has
little support among the poor and the lower castes, and its assertion of
Hindu supremacy ignores deep-rooted caste, class, ethnic, linguistic, and
regional loyalties. Against the backdrop of these difficulties, the Sangh
came up with two objectives to forge its ambitious Hindu nationalism: (1)
the tenet of hatred toward the Indian government and (2) drumming up hatred
toward the minority Muslim population in India. The Rama Janmabhoomi
campaign and the concurrent nationwide communal riots orchestrated by Sangh
militants (where Muslims were the victims of murders, rapes, and destruction
of property in overwhelmingly disproportionate numbers) fulfilled these two
objectives. The Sangh Parivar now depicts itself as a nationalist movement
besieged and confronted by a &quot;socialistic and atheistic&quot; state that pampers
the minority communities-although the Sangh knows well how Muslims and other
minorities in India have traditionally suffered as second-class citizens in
political and economic life. 19

Thus, in the nineties, RSS, VHP, and BJP forged the strong Hindu revivalist
Rama platform that dwelled on the issue of the &quot;historic&quot; birthplace of Lord
Rama in Ayodhya in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Their contention was that the
mosque, known as Babri Masjid (after the Islamic ruler Babar) was built upon
the ruins of a Hindu temple that was supposedly been demolished by &quot;Muslim&quot;
invaders. This temple, the Sangh says, was built to mark the holy birthplace
of Rama, the God king. The Sangh contends that a temple with pillars had
indeed been there since the eleventh century.

However, even an avidly pro-BJP Belgian columnist Koenraad Elst, in his book
argues, 20

&quot;When that building (the temple) was destroyed, we do not know precisely,
there are no descriptions of the event extant anywhere. Mohammed Ghori's
armies arrived there in 1194, and they may have destroyed it. It may have
been rebuilt afterwards, or it may only have been destroyed by later Muslim
lieutenants. So it is possible that when Mir Baqi, Babar's lieutenant,
arrived there in 1528, he found a heap of rubble, or an already aging
mosque, rather than a magnificent Hindu temple.&quot;

Other archeologists plainly assert that there has not been a single piece of
evidence for the existence of a temple of either brick, stone or both. 21

The fact is, Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) also has the largest number of
parliamentary seats and is important enough to sway the outcome of the
elections for one party or another. BJP has long concentrated to carry the
state. The Rama movement of 1990-92 culminated in the forcible demolition,
by Sangh militants, of the mosque on December 6, 1992, and consequent
massive communal riots that claimed thousands of lives all over
India-especially in North India and Bombay. 22 Repercussions followed in
adjoining Pakistan and Bangladesh, where reactionary Muslim fanatics
gathered strength out of this incident, and destroyed Hindu temples, lives
and property.

The BJP managed to worm its way into a short-lived coalition government in
U.P. in 1995, paving the way for a big win in the 1996 elections. In early
1997, after a long impasse, BJP and Mayawati-Kansiram's Bahujan Samaj Party
(BSP, a splinter party of &quot;lower castes&quot;) forged another coalition
government in the state where a power sharing deal was cut-the small
contingent of Mayawati's party would be given the chief ministership for the
first six months, BJP would then have its own chief minister, and so on. In
late 1997, however, BSP withdrew its support but the BJP managed to hang on
to power in U.P. by means of massive &quot;horse-trading&quot; and use of muscle-power
and money. The &quot;new inductees&quot; were subsequently rewarded with ministerial
portfolios. The BJP chief minister had to create numerous portfolios to
appease the &quot;disgruntled&quot; lawmakers. RSS, for its part, blessed these
practices from its Nagpur headquarters.

Vajpayee and other BJP leaders still support the long-promised Rama temple
on the demolition site. This is a centerpiece of the Sangh pledge to the
conservative upper caste Hindus. Does Vajpayee want to ignore the RSS whip
from the Nagpur headquarters? Not very likely. 23 Viswa Hindu Parishad (VHP)
is also keen to create another bloody movement to &quot;free&quot; Mathura in U.P.,
the so-called site of Lord Krishna's birth an objective Mayawati-Kansiram's
party (the BSP) does not favor.

*BJP government's nuclear tests create new tension*

On May 11, 1998, the Indian state conducted three nuclear tests in
Rajasthan. Prime Minister Vajpayee affirmed the position he took in the
parliament in March that &quot;our party feels India should have the bomb since
it will place the country in a strong position vis-a-vis the outside world.&quot;
It appears that this action by the BJP government is intended to send a
jingoistic message to China, Pakistan, and to the entire world. 24 By most
accounts, Pakistan is on the verge of having nuclear weapons, and Vajpayee
government's above actions will only expedite it. Is a nuclear war brewing
in the Indian subcontinent? The CIA reported, truly or falsely, that one
such serious threat was averted only recently. 25 Nevertheless, after the
May 11 incident, a subcontinental nuclear war is no longer an unlikely
scenario.

*Is RSS really fascist?*

Why is the RSS labeled as fascist by some circles and how much justification
is there? Why call anybody a fascist? Before RSS or BJP is called fascist,
we need to describe their ideas. Let's explain what fascism is, and compare
these ideas with what the &quot;Sangh Parivar&quot; practices. 26

The word &quot;fascism&quot; describes a set of overlapping and sometimes
contradictory beliefs that first became fashionable in continental Europe in
the 1920s. According to Dr. Mark Trisch of Johannes Gutenberg Universitaet,
Germany 27, the following set of ideas (in varying combinations) fostered by
a party or organization would brand it fascist:

(1) Calling for a return to the &quot;ancient traditions of the race&quot;
(2) A hierarchical, militaristic, corporate social organization

(3) A cult of leadership
(4) Calls for national self-reliance
(5) Calling for &quot;full employment&quot;
(6) Aggressively nationalistic foreign policy.

According to Dr. Trisch, although it is the combination of all these that
makes for trouble, the first three seem to be the most important.

Do the RSS, and its sister organizations such as the BJP or VHP foster these
ideas? Unfortunately, they do. A return to the ancient so-called &quot;glorified
Bharatiya traditions&quot; of the Hindu race is their number one creed. Every
single day, RSS, in its militaristic shakhas or gatherings, preaches to its
workers and sympathizers that the &quot;oldest nation of Bharatvarsha&quot; was the
&quot;greatest&quot; on earth and that its inhabitants were &quot;happy, prosperous, and
religious&quot;. The Sangh leaders never forget to mention that all the ills of
India began when, due to the &quot;disunity of the Hindu race&quot;, Muslim and then
British aggressors invaded and took over this &quot;holy land&quot;. The long term
goal of the Sangh Parivar is of course to bring back that &quot;past era of
glory&quot; by creating an &quot;Akhand Bharat&quot; (i.e., an Undivided India ranging from
&quot;Himalaya to Kanyakumari&quot; and &quot;Gandhar to Brahmadesh&quot; (i.e., from Tibet in
the north to the southern tip of India, and from Afghanistan in the west to
South East Asia including Burma, Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia)-culturally
and politically. This dream of &quot;unity&quot; is to be reached by organizing Hindus
from all around the globe.

The RSS is indeed a hierarchical, militaristic organization that actively
practices regimentation. 28 RSS has a &quot;Sarsanghchalak&quot; (Supreme Leader) who
is never elected (for that matter, no other leaders are elected-there is no
system of internal elections in the organization)-the supreme leader's
commands are obeyed without question. Further, Dr. Keshavrao Baliramrao
Hedgewar, the founder of the Sangh and Madhavrao Sadasivrao Golwalkar, the
second and most well-known supreme leader of RSS, are remembered in Sangh
circles with a sense of divinity and admiration that reaches the level of
God-worshipping. Indeed, these two men are officially given the status of
Avatars (reincarnation of God) by the RSS. Pictures of these two
Sarsanghchalaks are distributed and sold by RSS offices and bookstores and
decorate walls of workers' homes. Stories, often exaggerated, about their
lives are discussed at RSS camps and gatherings on a regular basis, essays
are written on their lives and works and the best ones are awarded prizes.
29 Portraits of the present Sarsanghchalak Rajendra Singh (&quot;Rajju Bhaiya&quot;)
is now promptly posted on RSS' Internet homepage by active workers in the
USA. 30 Similarly, Shiv Sena's new official homepage, on its title page, now
has the picture of its supremo, Balasaheb Thackeray.

This is what the Shiv Sena homepage declares about its leader: &quot;People from
all parts of Hindustan have only one hope. &quot;Hon'ble Shivsenapramukh Shri
Balasaheb Thackeray is our only hope. He is our national Leader&quot; they say.&quot;

National self-reliance is preached by the RSS: the Sangh has now actively
taken up the issue of self-reliance and put forth a program called the
&quot;Swadeshi Jagaran Manch&quot;-a platform to champion the idea of total economic
self-reliance. They decry the US investments in India and pro-US fiscal
treaties such as the GATT and NAFTA-RSS' opposition to American investment
might well have been a headache for the US government (and the) CIA in
deciding between the faltering Congress or rising BJP to be covertly pushed
as the next ruling party of India. 31

But the international investors can now breathe a sigh of relief as this
call for national self-reliance has proved to be just a politically
expedient move without any real will behind it as evident by what the BJP in
fact did vis-à-vis the multinational Enron power project.

Full employment for labor (but without any real power or control over the
workplace) has been a centerpiece of RSS and BJP actions implemented through
the activities of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh or BMS, one of the largest labor
organizations in India. BJP's ultra-right ally Shiv Sena has come up with
plans to support the Hindu labor force in the state of Maharashtra. The
irony here is that the Shiv Sena was originally floated by national and
international vested-interest groups to crush the once-powerful trade unions
of Bombay back in the 1980's and has operated a protection racket ever
since. In recent months, American pop-singer Michael Jackson and eminent
Indian film playback singer Lata Mangeshkar and actor Dilip Kumar
participated in huge Shiv Udyog Sena 32 -sponsored concerts purportedly to
raise funds for the Hindu laborers of Bombay.

An aggressively nationalistic foreign policy has always been at the
forefront of RSS propaganda. Much toned-down by the BJP now, during the Jana
Sangh days, it was much more overt. America was never well-liked by Sangh
members-the United States has always been portrayed as the very image of
immorality and profanity on earth. However, a previous Jana Sangh president
and one of its most famous orators Balraj Madhok was an ardent pro-American
who had a small but powerful following in his days. But he could not make
RSS, and consequently Jana Sangh, openly pro-American. This was largely due
to the opposition of the all-powerful Golwalkar and leaders like Vajpayee
the latter being a supporter of non-alignment with a less vociferous
objection against the then USSR (this was however a strategy for them to
internationally undermine and isolate China-the Sangh's one main enemy).
RSS' and Jana Sangh's (and now BJP's) foreign policy stands on the dictum of
anti-Pakistan and anti-China hatred-and for that matter, hatred against any
Islamic or socialist countries or alliances. George Fernandez, an important
minister in the current BJP government, has proclaimed China to be India's
number one enemy (May 1998). Israel now has become a hot favorite of the
Sangh Parivar-Vajpayee, Advani, and other BJP leaders have frequented the
country to show their support for the ferociously anti-Arab nation. Attempts
have often been made, allegedly, to iron out the Sangh's previously bitter
relationships with USA via the mediation of Israel. Note the irony here-a
Hitler-admiring organization is having a mutual love-fest with the one
nation that has the most reason on earth to despise anything that even
remotely seeks of Hitler and the Nazi party.

4 During the seventies, I remember the socialist leader Jaya Prakash Narayan
calling all Brahmans to give up their &quot;holy threads&quot; a symbol of their
so-called superiority. However, the then Sarsanghchalak Balasaheb Deoras
opposed this call -- Deoras said that all non-Brahmans should wear holy
threads instead. Obviously, he knew that the Hindu Brahman would never
accept that measure.

6 What is the truth about Godse's RSS connection? ... Godse himself had
stated before the Court: &quot;I have worked for several years in RSS and
subsequently joined the Hindu Mahasabha...&quot; (Godse, Gopal: &quot;May it Please
Your Honour: Statement of Nathuram Godse&quot;). The most significant is the
revelation by his brother about the last moments of his life: &quot;On reaching
the platform they recited a verse of devotion to the Motherland: &quot;Namaste
sada vatsale matribhume...&quot; [This is the RSS prayer sung even today -
author]. The above is quoted from D. R. Goyal: Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh .

9 This rhetoric reminds us of the anti-immigrant decree of Pat Robertson,
the leader of the Christian Coalition of USA a personality much despised by
the RSS and VHP people of America. The Republican governor of California,
Pete Wilson, won the recent elections in the state upon this anti-alien,
anti-immigrant plank known as Proposition 209-a measure that denies all
human rights to illegal immigrants and their children and some benefits even
to legal immigrants.

15 Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay was one of the most intelligent, scholarly, and
ethical leaders RSS has ever produced. My father knew him well. I remember
how shocked he was when Upadhyay was brutally murdered on a train he was
traveling by himself. Among others who paid tribute after Upadhyay's death,
the eloquent Communist Party leader Hiren Mukherjee called him &quot;ajatashatru&quot;
the one with no enemies.

16 Nana Deshmukh, popularly known as Nanaji, is another Sangh leader much
respected for his organizational skills and little personal ambitions.
Nanaji knew me through my father. I even ran into him during my 1997 trip to
New Delhi. Once he asked me to write a paper on Rabindranath Tagore's social
views (The Nobel-laureate poet Tagore was a skilled and benevolent zamindar
or land owner. He also established two great universities named Shanti
Niketan and Sri Niketan the latter being a vocational school). Nanaji paid
me for the essay. My father translated it from Bengali to Hindi.

Hindu temples, teaching of Sanskrit to youngsters, private gatherings, etc.

23 Vajpayee has some history of defying orders from RSS. In the sixties, he
defied RSS' Golwalkar's insistence that an unknown Bachhraj Vyas be selected
as the Jana Sangh chief instead of the popular leader Deendayal Upadhyay.

Moreover, RSS and BJP have also been linked with Ranabir Sena, a private
army for big landowners that has most recently been responsible for the
killing of sixty-one poor people in Lakshmanpur-Bathe village of Bihar's
Jehanabad district on Dec. 1, 97. The angry people in the village recently
did not allow Vajpayee to visit the killing fields.

29 I too was once awarded a first-prize for an essay I wrote about the
founder of the Sangh. The prize was another biography of Dr. Hedgewar!

30 A meeting of prominent RSS workers was held on November 9 and 10, 1929.
It decided against the 'cumbersome clap-trap of internal democracy' and
opted for a centralized authority-based structure... The principle was
called &quot;Ek Chalak Anuvartitva&quot; (following one leader) and was explained to
the swayamsevaks by V. V. Kelkar who told them that it was on the lines of
the traditional Hindu joint family system and was most appropriate for an
organization wedded to reviving and rejuvenating the Hindu way of life. It
is rather difficult to distinguish this arrangement from what has been
called the &quot;Fuehrer Principle&quot; followed by the Fascists in Italy and Nazis
in Germany in the decade leading up to WWII. Quoted from D. R. Goyal:
Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh . Radha Krishna Prakashan, New Delhi. 1979.

Recently, in an interview carried in the Panchjanya, a magazine with close
RSS connections, Ms Uma Bharati, the BJP MP from Khajuraho and president of
the party's Yuva Morcha, has quoted the RSS chief, Professor Rajendra Singh,
to say that despite the number of police stations in the country, and
thousands of policemen, Muslims cannot be safe if they have enmity with the
Hindus. Source: The Hindu, January 18, 1998.

32 Shiv Udyog Sena is the commerce front of the Shiv Sena.

33 Vajpayee became the Indian prime minister in 1996 for 13 days his
minority government resigned rather than face a vote of confidence on the
floor of the parliament. The only legislation the BJP government managed in
those days were some silly but nonetheless chilling restrictions on the
broadcast media. The current BJP govt. is now extending the task by
manipulating with the Prasar Bharati.
