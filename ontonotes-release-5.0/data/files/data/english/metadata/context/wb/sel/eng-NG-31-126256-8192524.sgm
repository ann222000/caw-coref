Abundance- How To Live With It

In order to have 'more' of anything (or everything) we need to stretch
our boundaries and our imagination. I invite you to adopt Abundance
rather than Prosperity as an idea, as this aligns you with the
possibility of having so much more.

When you embrace and understand Abundance as inclusive of prosperity,
having 'more' means having more financial freedom, greater wellbeing,
relationships that enhance your life, and abundant opportunities for
expanding your joyful expression.

So begin by honouring the Abundance that is always readily available
to you - your breath. It's free, and life-giving. The breath infuses
us with Life and creates an abundant flow as a life-giving stream.

With awareness, we are able to draw more from the breath and,
therefore, more from our lives. So I suggest you now take a few slow
breaths as this will assist you to assimilate this bigger idea and
anchor it deeply in your Being.

Infusing new information more deeply into your consciousness via the
breath allows you to hold it more deeply. As you inhale, you enliven
all your cells which expands your capacity to think. So - breathe,
infuse, allow, use.

Then take a 'wide-angle lens' view of Abundance. This means speaking
to your inner-knowing to support you to arrive at your understanding
of Abundance which then paves the way for you to enjoy increasingly
greater Abundance in every area of your life.

Abundance is the stage of integral wholeness where we are satiated
with our own delight. It is the stage in our evolution as human beings
where life ceases to be about external creation, and is about internal
rapture - existing in an increasingly spacious container where we
create worlds, within and without, that deeply nourish our spirit and
make our hearts sing; where we live gloriously with ourselves and
others. We are Abundant.
