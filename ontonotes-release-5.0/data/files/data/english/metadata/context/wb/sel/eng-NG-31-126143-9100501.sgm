Unfortunately, it is true.

Tell me, exactly what manner did i discuss it, that you claim no
one would, other than to mention it in passing. Its the single
most horrible thing to ever happen in my life, my wifes, my
sons, and i feel the pain every single day as do they.

You have absoulutely no clue how an event like this can totally
ruin lives.

But, that doesnt prevent you from making bold declarations as
you have above. You should thank God every single day that your
offspring are alive. Ask your love ones what they think of your
post. Do you really think they would condone your making these
writings?

Yet, you continue to post poisonous statements, like above. I
guess you admire Fred to the point of imitation.

You are no better than pus mouth. Actually, you're worse. Why
worse? Because you impugn, then you hide. Then you trot out your
pledge, and say &quot;see how good I am here&quot; I dont respond to
attacks. I made a pledge. everyone here should take my pledge.
You even have dentalfloss agreeing. How blind and viscious can
you all be?

Now, you'll continue to post shit about me, to me, and make
totally unfounded and unwarranted attacks, to the point of
totally diminishing the memory of a wonderful 15 year old girl,
who was unfortunate enough to perish in a horrible auto
accident.

I hope you are proud of yourself.

Now, trot out your pledge, about how you wont respond to attacks
once again.

When assholes like you make statements like you have above, it
only shows to the world what an insensitive miserable little man
you actually are.

I truly feel sorry for you.

You have deluded yourself into thinking you are something
special, when in fact you are the exact opposite.

PS Its really nice to see people like Todd and Scarlotti and
Bruce weigh in with disgust at these types of writings.

Those that remain silent are de facto supporters.

Its really funny, I get attacked for cursing, and calling folks
asswipe and fucking idiots (which is fine with me, I did say
those things, and probably will again), but others can talk
about the dead, to the point of discussing necrophelia (actually
fucking my daugthers corpse, as happened the first time), and no
one says a thing.

Remember, i proposed the last time that a standard of behavior
be adoped here. No one gave a shit, so resign yourselves to put
up with this nonsense ad infinitum.

You ALL bring it on yourself through your silence.

Only Ed has found a solution that works for him.

Keep on bemoaning the loss of your friends and contributors, and
as long as you continue to remain silent while Fred writes the
most horrible things, and folks like Bugge echo them, you are
doomed to see this saga replay itself over and over again.

Well put, Rocket.

It's astonishing how these folks overlook the horrible things that
people who they like have done, but comdemn you and I for using curse
words that most of America uses casually every day. Bugge is the
typical conservative who rails against profanity and pornography while
condoning much worse activities.

He won't even see this because he's had me killfiled for a long time

&quot;In passing?&quot;  My God, Little Roxie, there are archives here.

You initially used it to excuse what you referred to as your own

Then, as if that wasn't offensive enough, you said you would bet you
could prove the circumstances surrounding her &quot;death.&quot;  Go back and
check the posts from the last week of January, 2006.  It's all there.

As I said at the time, anyone who would wager on something like that

Or the bold declaration you were a magistrate in Virginia?

And a scientist?

Or the bold declaration you were issuing subpoenas for the RIAA?

You see, Roxie, your life here has been one bold declaration after
another, with absolutely nothing to back any of them up.  There comes
a time when all those empty declarations begin to blend into one
another in a swamp of bottomless chickenshit.

When you excused your rude behavior in the group because your
&quot;daughter had died,&quot;  it came off as more chickenshit.  It was
extraordinarily insensitive, but it was clearly chickenshit.

But when you were willing to bet you could prove she &quot;died,&quot; that
managed to set a new low for human behavior, Usenet Division.  You
stopped being a troll and became a breathing cancer.  You were willing
to &quot;put up&quot; proof of her death to score points in a newsgroup.  There
is no way to justify that behavior before God or man.

Do you think your family, whatever it may be, would be proud of the
way you defended her memory by making threats?

Did it honor her &quot;memory&quot; when you never followed through on them?

Did it honor her when you were willing to make a bet about her death?

Don't be a hypocrite and ask if our families would condone our

Oooooh.  Ghetto Style Forever!

As I recall, someone else made the pledge, and you tried to make it
your own after a week or so of scorched earth posts.  I called you a
hypocrite then because you weren't going to take the pledge unless
everyone else agreed.  Once again, someone else was going to be
responsible for your conduct.  First it was your daughter, then it was
going to be the group.  If you broke you word, it was going to be
someone else's fault.  That's almost as weak as the name calling
you've been reduced to.  If you had been serious about that pledge,
you would have never have started things up again here.

&gt;&gt; Tell me, exactly what manner did i discuss it, that you claim
no
&gt;&gt; one would, other than to mention it in passing.

&gt; &quot;In passing?&quot;  My God, Little Roxie, there are archives here.

&gt; You initially used it to excuse what you referred to as your
own
&gt; &quot;nasty&quot; posts in the group.  Hardly &quot;in passing.&quot;

&gt; Then, as if that wasn't offensive enough, you said you would
bet you
&gt; could prove the circumstances surrounding her &quot;death.&quot;  Go
back and
&gt; check the posts from the last week of January, 2006.  It's all
there.

&gt; As I said at the time, anyone who would wager on something
like that
&gt; is either lower than pond scum or lying.  No one who was
actually a
&gt; father would have done that.

&gt; And now, anyone who would claim that these comments were just
&quot;in
&gt; passing&quot; is delusional.

&gt; Its the single
&gt;&gt; most horrible thing to ever happen in my life, my wifes,

&gt; You never mentioned you were Mormon, or illiterate.

&gt;  my
&gt;&gt; sons, and i feel the pain every single day as do they.

&gt; Did you tell them you were going to bet you could prove she
died so
&gt; you could score some points in a flame war on Usenet?  I bet
they were
&gt; real proud of you that day.  I bet all the pain went away when
they
&gt; realized there was no better way to remember her than for you
to
&gt; invoke her as an excuse for being &quot;nasty.&quot;  Way to go, Dad..

&gt;&gt; You have absoulutely no clue how an event like this can
totally
&gt;&gt; ruin lives.

&gt; It ruined yours so badly you consistently return to her death
as an
&gt; excuse for what you called &quot;nasty&quot; behavior on Usenet.  That
is just
&gt; tasteless and crass.

&gt;&gt; But, that doesnt prevent you from making bold declarations as
&gt;&gt; you have above.

&gt; You mean like bold declarations you were coming to my house?

&gt; Or the bold declarations you were going to call me?

&gt; Or the bold declarations you were going to mail all that stuff
to my
&gt; wife?

&gt; Or the bold declaration you were a magistrate in Virginia?

&gt; And a scientist?

&gt; Or the bold declaration you were issuing subpoenas for the
RIAA?

&gt; You see, Roxie, your life here has been one bold declaration
after
&gt; another, with absolutely nothing to back any of them up.
There comes
&gt; a time when all those empty declarations begin to blend into
one
&gt; another in a swamp of bottomless chickenshit.

&gt; When you excused your rude behavior in the group because your
&gt; &quot;daughter had died,&quot;  it came off as more chickenshit.  It was
&gt; extraordinarily insensitive, but it was clearly chickenshit.

&gt; But when you were willing to bet you could prove she &quot;died,&quot;
that
&gt; managed to set a new low for human behavior, Usenet Division.
You
&gt; stopped being a troll and became a breathing cancer.  You were
willing
&gt; to &quot;put up&quot; proof of her death to score points in a newsgroup.
There
&gt; is no way to justify that behavior before God or man.

&gt; You should thank God every single day that your
&gt;&gt; offspring are alive. Ask your love ones what they think of
your
&gt;&gt; post. Do you really think they would condone your making
these
&gt;&gt; writings?

&gt; You had a chance to find out.  You were going to mail my wife
all my
&gt; posts.  You failed.  Just another chickenshot &quot;bold
pronouncement&quot;
&gt; from a fraud.

&gt; Do you think your family, whatever it may be, would be proud
of the
&gt; way you defended her memory by making threats?

&gt; Did it honor her &quot;memory&quot; when you never followed through on
them?

&gt; Did it honor her when you were willing to make a bet about her
death?

&gt; Don't be a hypocrite and ask if our families would condone our
&gt; conduct.  Tell us about yours, since you were the one that
dragged
&gt; them into this.

&gt; You're lucky you really don't have a daughter, because if you
did, you
&gt; would fry in Hell for your conduct.

&gt;&gt; Yet, you continue to post poisonous statements, like above. I
&gt;&gt; guess you admire Fred to the point of imitation.

&gt;&gt; You are no better than pus mouth. Actually, you're worse. Why
&gt;&gt; worse? Because you impugn, then you hide. Then you trot out
your
&gt;&gt; pledge, and say &quot;see how good I am here&quot; I dont respond to
&gt;&gt; attacks. I made a pledge. everyone here should take my
pledge.
&gt;&gt; You even have dentalfloss agreeing. How blind and viscious
can
&gt;&gt; you all be?

&gt; Wow.  All those nasty names.  I guess you shouldn't be held
&gt; responsible for all that juvenile language.  All that fatherly
pain
&gt; and anguish is causing you to act this way, right?

&gt; You seem to forget that no one mentioned your daughter after
your last
&gt; meltdown until YOU brought her up again.  Do you really think
anyone
&gt; believes in her existence more now than they did last year?

&gt;&gt; Its really funny, I get attacked for cursing, and calling
folks
&gt;&gt; asswipe and fucking idiots (which is fine with me, I did say
&gt;&gt; those things, and probably will again), but others can talk
&gt;&gt; about the dead, to the point of discussing necrophelia
(actually
&gt;&gt; fucking my daugthers corpse, as happened the first time),

&gt; You are probably confusing that with your stated intention to
rape my
&gt; family.  That's understandable.  I'm sure the loss of your

Why would I do that?  When it comes to looks which side of the family
do you favor the Lubinskys or Grossbergs?

I know that.

I also know she gets to see what I say when you cut and paste my posts
in your responses to me.  And you always respond, putz.

So, after all that, thanks to your complicit stupidity, what I get is
Diane having to pretend she doesn't know what I say, even though you
make sure she does.  Really silly reasoning, don't you think?

Of course, I guess she could say that when she reads your posts that
quote mine, she squints real hard and only reads what you say.  That
would be believeable.

This recent fascination of yours with what I wipe my ass with is a tad
strange.  I'd respond in kind, but as long as Dennis is around, I
already know how you keep your ass clean.

I may use more words than you simply because I know more words than
you. Shit, your average parrot knows more words than you.

(Why do I suspect I'm now going to told to wipe my ass with an average
parrot?)

You do have another advantage over me.  Making stuff up and posting
bad information is a lot faster than sticking to the facts.

You're a regular stud muffin, Bruce.

All those 60+ woman clamouring for you. I saw in the DDF thread where
Diane said she thinks Denny is delectable. Does she think you are
delectable? Does she love you?
