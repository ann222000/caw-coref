I'd like to (eventually) install Tiger on my 450 B&amp;W G3 Smurf.  This
machine is on it's third or more owner.  I've 3 HDs for it: 12 GB from
an iMac, 15 GB from a PC, and 250 GB from an external case.  Running
with 256 MB RAM.

The 15 GB makes clicking noises, assume it's bad.  The 250 GB is my
backup drive for another system-not going to mess it up.  Also, the
250 GB won't work on Smurf's built-in ATA channel.  This post is
referring to the Quantum Apple branded 12 GB.  So far, I've been
unsuccessful even installing OS 9.  There's no files to save on the
HD.  Some rec'd that the HD be partitioned, the first partition
containing OS X, the second OS 9.

Just tried to reformat with Drive Setup on OS 9.2.1 retail CD.  Set CD
drive jumper from master to cable select.  When open Drive Setup,
error message &quot;Drive Setup has unexpectedly quit, because an error of
type 3 occurred.  You should save your work in other open applications
and restart the computer.&quot;

Also have set HD to cable select (far as I can tell) &amp; put on end of
ATA cable.

If I can get some feedback on jumpers &amp; cables, I think I'll be
farther along the road to success.  Also, what should I look for on
this machine, as it's been reconfigured many times, possibly over-
clocked?  The jumper block is set at 450 Mhz, mobo is Rev 2, CPU
apparently 450 Mhz.  The sticker on rear indicates SCSI from the
factory-no SCSI card installed.  I wonder if PCI video card is OK/
adequate.  Image is not centered on screen, various images flash by
when booting.  Don't know how to ID card without stable OS installed
on HD.

Please help me focus here...  :&gt;)

Now set to master, according to &lt; http://tinyurl.com/29mkhj &gt;.  Using
settings in the second box from the top on Segate's site.  Looks like
my model is not listed.  Sticker says 13.0 GB FBLA 655T0018
*MF002013LH6FA* Fireball 1ct 3.5 series F/W A03A900 P/N 655-0806

On end of IDE cable (master position, according to &lt; http://tinyurl.com/
23e34v&gt;).

Boots with OS 9.2.1 retail CD.  Desktop shows CD &amp; HD.  Open Utilities
folder (to partition) &amp; it locks up.  Utilities folder does not
display.  Menu bar goes blank, desktop icons disappear.  All I had was
desktop pattern with blank menu bar &amp; cursor movement with mouse.  A
few seconds later, cursor not responsive.

Force reboot with reset switch (no Power key).  Before Mac OS 9.2
splash screen, a brief flash of the CD desktop pattern.  As soon as
desktop appears, try to open Utilities folder.  Menu bar, desktop
icons, &amp; CD folder stay visible.  &quot;Sorry, a system error occurred.
&quot;Finder&quot; error type 10.  Restart&quot;  (bomb message) Click Restart.

This time, successful in opening Utilities folder.  Open Drive Setup.
Briefly shows up, then crashes.  Same error type 3 as in OP.
Special&gt;Restart.

Another exact repeat of last paragraph, except after error 3, opened
Disk First Aid.  Repaired disk, no problems (HD disappear from
desktop).

Sorry about aborting last post (hit spacebar &amp; it sent to list
prematurely).

After successful DFA repair, tried to again repair, got error type 1 &amp;
DFA crash.

Open Drive Setup (no HD icon on desktop since 1st/successful DFA
repair).  Only CD shows up.  No change with rescan bus.  Close DS-
first time I recall that DS didn't crash.  Open DFA, no HD shows up.
System locks up, DFA shows CD only, cursor moves, no keyboard response
except to force quit, which is successful in getting back to Finder.
Special&gt;Restart.

At boot, HD icon shows up on desktop.  Successfully open DS.  &lt;happy
dance&gt;  While setting up 1 Mac Extended (HFS+, I assume) partition,
bomb message-type 10, &quot;Drive Setup&quot;  Click Restart.

At boot, CD &amp; HD show up on desktop.  Open Utilities, DS.  &quot;Searching
for drives connected to this computer...&quot;  Spinning black &amp; white
ball.  Cursor moves, can't click desktop or menus.  Cmd+Q= nothing.
After 2+ mins (menu bar clock not updating time), successfully force
quit DS.  HD icon still shows on desktop.

Open DFA, HD shows up.  Options&gt;Erase Disk.  (Never done that in
DFA).  Locks up, force quit.  Menu bar shows [L to R]: Apple, File,
greyed out Edit, Options highlighted, Help, clock (stalled), DFA with
icon.  Force quit dialog box partially showing.  Cursor movement.
Attempt to again force quit, displays properly (DFA), totally locks up
(no movement) when click force quit.  Reset button.

At boot, DS crashes while loading-error type 2.  Special&gt;Shut Down.
No response, cursor movement.  Try force quit, empty diag shows.
Reset button.  Shut down via Open Firmware command.

Now will post this &amp; try to get Apple System Profiler (may have wrong
name-the app that shows OS 9 machines what's in them) on external FW/
USB HD.  Then, see if can boot Smurf from 9.2.1 CD &amp; load external HD
&amp; see what Profiler says.

Little update:

Popped HD into FW case, formatted with one partition using Disk
Utility on another Tiger machine.  Installed OS 9 drivers, HFS + (not
journaled).  Shows up correctly as internal HD in Smurf.  Boot from 9
CD, open OS installer-crash, error type 2.  Open Drive Setup, locks up
system.  Drive Setup shows 3 volumes: Mac OS 9.2.1 [CD] ATAP1, Bus 0,
ID 0, LUN 0; &lt;not supported&gt;, ATAP1, Bus 0, ID 1, LUN 0; Quantum [HD]
ATA, Bus 1, ID 0, LUN 0.  Reset.

Tried DFA at boot.  Locks up as soon as start Repair.

Seems to me that it's better to format the drive in Classic before
installing OS 9.  Maybe format on Tiger system (FW), then install OS 9
from CD on the Tiger system.  Makes me nervous, as it seems that
Classic &amp; Tiger have nothing in common.

How I miss single-user mode: memtest &amp; applejack esp!

Redundant, btw.  A B&amp;W *is* a Smurf.

Check your boot rom firmware.  Make sure you're updated to version

The built-in ATA interfaces on the Smurf *do not* support Cable
Select.  You must use either a Master-Alone (single drive), or
Master-and-Slave (two drives) configuration.

Good.  But re-check the drive's configuration.  See if it as a

First, you're not formatting the drive - you're erasing and
initializing.   Both operating systems use the same HFS+ file system.
That's the fundamental thing they have in common.  As long as you add
the OS 9 drivers to the disk when you initialize it, you're all set.
You DO NOT need to do the init in Classic or OS 9.  Disk Utility is
preferred.

That your OS 9 CD is locking up/crashing on the Smurf is another
issue entirely.  Could be the master-alone issue or it could be a ram
problem or it could be some other hardware issue.  What else is
plugged in?

If you can clone your Tiger system onto that drive on the other
Mac... Hook it into the Smurf then boot with the shift key held down.
That will force it into Single-User mode, which will clear and
rebuild the system caches.

yea, it is, but more and more of the OS depends on fast graphics

The visible /System and /Library and System Folder folders are just a
drop in the bucket.  The core of OS X is invisible to Finder.  &quot;ls
-al /&quot; from Terminal will show you what's there.  What's more, unlike
the classic OS, OS X depends on a lot of pseudo linkages.  So you
cannot simply copy the folders and expect things to work.  Use Carbon
Copy Cloner or SuperDuper to make the clone.  Grab everything,
including your admin account in /Users as well as /Users/Shared.  You
can leave the other users off.

Once you have a clone ready, you can boot on it.  If it won't boot

Both machines were purchased used, and the 32 and 64 MB &quot;sticks&quot;
where present when purchased. Machines worked fine for well over a
year in OS 9 with that memory.  Never had any problem with them until
I upgraded the machines  to OSX.

I no longer have the machines, or the lower MB RAM to give you brand
names and such.  Both were Revision 2 motherboards.  One was a G3/400
and the other was originally a G3/350 that I put a G4/400 ZIF in. The
one with the G4 upgrade was particularly picky about memory.  It even
rejected some of the 128MB sticks that worked fine in the other
machine.  RAMometer (OS 9 program) indicated the sticks were good.  I
ran Jeff Walther's RAM-sandwich test on them for over 1000 passes.

&gt; machine regularly refused to boot if there was anything like a 32 or
&gt; 64MB chip installed.

Interesting.  I'll soon be adding a Digital Audio to my fleet &amp; so
might try to swap in some of DA's PC133 stick into the Smurf.

Will eventually look for help on how to interpret verbose mode.

Here's a thought- Install Tiger from the system-specific (machine #2)

via FW.  Init &amp; install basic Tiger (10.4) on FW/Smurf HD.  Have
10.4.11 Combo update on CD; the DVD installs 10.4 with no suffix.

Worth trying?  Are there system-specific files the Tiger installer
won't put on Smurf HD?  Or files from #2 (G4) that will mess up
Smurf?
Seems to me this would be easy (relatively) way to get Tiger on Smurf
HD- I think it's like 2 GB for basic install, with iApps.

Did that.  Cloned boot volume expect for: Applications, Developer.

After cloning, booted #2 fine from FW/Smurf drive.  At boot, all 3

All looked good until login screen.  At the top of screen, below Mac

Booted #2 from Tiger DVD.  Format &amp; install basic Tiger onto FW/Smurf
HD.  Booted #2 from Smurf HD.  Setup 1 admin.  Applied 10.4.11 Combo
update to Smurf HD.  Restart.  Verbose  mode notes KeyLargoATA has no
kernel dependency.  Stalls in verbose, something at end about
hanging.  Auto-restarted from verbose.  Start up from Smurf HD,
holding down shift for Safe Mode.  Boots &amp; runs fine.  Shut down, then
start up from Smurf HD (normally) hangs, then circle with line through
it appears.  Cmd + Ctrl + Pwr.  At boot, Opt.  Smurf HD does not
appear.

Boot #2 from it's HD.  Disk Utility on #2 (10.4.10) repair permissions
on Smurf HD.  &quot;Group differs on ./private/etc/authorization, should be
80, group is 0.  Owner and group corrected on ./private/etc/
authorization.  Permissions corrected on ./private/etc/
authorization&quot;    Repair disk.  No repairs necessary.  Install
Applejack with memtest.

Re-install Smurf HD into Smurf, using different IDE cable (from FW
enclosure).  Single-user.  HeathrowATA &amp; CMD646ATA have no kernel
dependency.  Applejack auto restart (not deep cleaning mode that
crashed before).  No HD repairs necessary.  Repairing permissions does
not lock up this time.  Applejack restarts machine.

Looks good-locks up when Mac OS X splash screen starts to load
progress bar.  Reset.  Verbose.  Matching service count =0,1,1, etc.
On #2, those #'s are bigger in verbose.  No stalling verbose.  When
exit verbose, locked up with blue screen &amp; stuck cursor visible.
Reset.  Shift key.  Progress bar loads about 1/4, then freezes.

Reset from frozen progress bar.  Shut down with Open Firmware.  Remove
CD-ROM &amp; Zip (&amp; caddy).  Install HD on master (CD-ROM) position.  Boot
single-user, applejack auto restart.  No disk errors.
BMacEnet:monitorLinkStatus : Link down.  Removed system cache &amp; VM.
Applejack auto. restarts.  Verbose.  HeathrowATA &amp; CMD646ATA have no
kernel dependencies.  Boots to blue screen.  Boots to full OS X
desktop!  Pull down About this Mac &amp; black screen with a line of white
text (looks like verbose mode) appears for a moment, then locks up-to
blank blue screen with stuck cursor.  Reset.

Single-user.  HeathrowATA &amp; CMD646ATA no kernel.  Applejack, not auto-
menu items sequentially &amp; manually.  No disk errors.  Same Enet link
down message.  By manually running AJ, cleaned out user files
individually at prompts.  Restart from AJ.  Hold Shift.  About 1/2 way
through progress bar, black screen with white text appears.  Looks
like single-user.  &quot;Darwin/BSD (admins-ibook-g4.local) (console)&quot;
Then a blank line, followed by &quot;login:&quot; with white box for text entry,
like single-user.  Note that machine #2 is an iBook G4.  &quot;admin&quot; is
name of the only user.  &quot;admin&quot; has no password.  Attempt to hit enter
(like I would to boot HD if FW on #2).  No response.  Reset.

Hold down Cmd + V at boot.  When grey screen with Apple logo appears,
release &amp; hold Shift.  Normal verbose mode follows.  Blank blue
screen, then black with white text entry box.  Reset.

Single-user.  Applejack AUTO for deep cleaning caches.  Restart.

Single-user.  Turned off Spotlight using info at &lt; http://tinyurl.com/
23mcb2&gt;  Verbose, boot until login screen; shows &quot;admin&quot; &amp; password
field.  This is exactly how the drive appears on #2 at boot.  Move
cursor to click Log In (no password) &amp; locks up.  Reset.

Single-user, applejack manually run.  No disk errors.  Repairing
permissions locks up after about 2&quot; of &quot;...&quot; appear; counted 18 dots.
Reset.

Single-user.  Ran fsck with no issues.  Mounted file system with /sbin/
mount -uw /.  Applejack manually-skipping option 1 to repair disk &amp;
running permissions repair.  Ran fine, no lockup this time.  Cleanup
cache, not for user-specific.  Check prefs file; fine, not user-
specific.  VM clear.  Reboot.

Verbose.  Boots to login screen, as before.  Press Return (no
password).  Desktop with open folders appears-like once before!
Windows close fine, open About this Mac.  Shows correct 256 MB RAM,
10.4.11.  Open System Profiler from there.  Look at tabs.  ATA looks
fine, OS 9 drivers.  DIMM0/J19 Empty, DIMM1/J20 128 MB, DIMM2/J21 &amp;
DIMM 3/J22 64 MB.  All are unknown type &amp; speed, OK status.  Network
shows Airport info (Tiger installed from iBook).  Also modem info (no
modem in Smurf).  Loading tabs takes a few seconds longer than on G4.
Extensions shows everything OK-including Heathrow &amp; CMD646 (verbose
noted errors, no kernel).  Various logs-from 11/19, 1 PM &amp; 9 PM.  Just
noticed menu bar clock shows Mon 9:30 PM (it's 3:30 AM Tues 20th as I
write this).  Close Profiler &amp; go to System Preferences.  Open Date &amp;
Time.  Click on time to set, window closes &amp; system locks up.  Reset.

Single-user.  fsck with no error, then mount file system.  Applejack
auto restart.  Disk repair aborted since disk has already been mounted
to write access.  No permissions repaired.  Cache cleaned.  As always,
nothing in prefs.  VM cleaned.  Auto. restart.

Single-user.  applejack auto restart.  Seems like single-user prompt
loaded more quickly this time than last time.  Disk repair shows
nothing.  Permissions fine.  Nothing in cache.  Prefs OK.  VM empty.
Auto. restart.

Verbose.  Still no kernel for Heathrow &amp; CMD646 ATA.  Logs in fine,
single user with no password, needs OK/Return.  Windows open in
Finder.  They close fine.  System &amp; cursor locks up when opening
System Prefs from Apple menu (last time, opened, but locked up in Date
&amp; Time).  Reset.

Option while booting (can I boot OS 9?), no effect.  Splash screen
loads about 1/5, then locks up.  Reset, shut down with Open Firmware.

Clarifying last post:

Removed Spotlight with rm command in single-user; not chmod as
described in linked page.  Seems removing SL &amp; putting HD on CD-ROM
IDE bus are key getting this to work.

I will be out of town/away from email &amp; my fleet until next Mon 26th
(a week from last post).  Plan to check email before leaving Wed 21st,
but no time to try new techniques.

---new--
Memtest passed.  Played around in single-user trying to get ssh
started.  Ethernet connects #2 &amp; Smurf now-remains that way throughout
remainder of this post.  A noted effect of this- Applejack permissions
repair now shows full duplex eNet. Unknown if successful &amp; IDK how to
use ssh.  Thought would be a way to get Smurf out of frequent
freezes.  Via Applejack advanced mode, setup as new computer.  This is
the app that loads after you first install Tiger.  Now, the machine is
called something powermacg3series.  Created user &quot;steve&quot; with simple
password.  Set time correctly via this process.

Opened Dashboard prefs to disable any keys from displaying Dashboard.
Show All, Startup Disk-crashes, loading only Network Startup.  Reset.
Applejack auto restart.

Progress bar loads 1/2, stalls with no cursor movement.  Reset.
Verbose.  Nice pace, then the Darwin console noted yest. &quot;login:&quot; with
white text box.  No response from kybd.  Reset.  Applejack AUTO
restart.  Verbose, some missed errors at end; boots to desktop.
Looking at logs in System Profiler, Save As; locks up when saving
extensions part of system profile.  Reset, verbose.  No noted errors
at end this time, freezes at blue screen with stuck cursor.  Applejack
auto restart, then verbose.  Missed text at end of boot, looked like
the prev. missed &quot;errors&quot;.  Freezes at blue screen.  Reset, applejack
AUTO shutdown.

Just an update before leaving town.

Applejack locked up (first time that's happened).  Completed disk
repairs, permissions, cache.  While starting to validate preference
files, &quot;Bus error&quot;.  Command prompt responds.  Applejack AUTO
restart.  Disk repair aborted, already mounted for write access.

Versbose.  Note Got boot device line includes reference to
HeathtowATA.  Errors like before at end of boot process, missed
contents.  Desktop appears, freezes when loading Disk Utility.  Open
Firmware shut down.
