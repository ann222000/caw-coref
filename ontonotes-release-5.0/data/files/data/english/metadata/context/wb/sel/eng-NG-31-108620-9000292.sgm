In 1996 I wrote in these newsgroups about an idea I had worked out
about using thin film reflectors inflated on orbit to concentrate
sunlight onto a solar pumped laser.  That laser beam would be beamed
to receivers on the ground which would convert the power to
electricity and thermal energy for industrial use.  Overall efficiency
would be 40%

I was roundly attacked by all - and so, it was with great interest
that I read the following on yahoo news service in 2007;

I am fully justified in my earlier statements - and all those who
mercilessly attacked me have been proved dead wrong in their negative
assessments of my ideas.

But that's exactly what this mostly Yiddish anti-think-tank of a
Usenet from naysay hell is good at doing, is their topic/author
stalking and bashing with everything they can muster. (I believe it's
one of their born again faith-based things that's pretty much naysay
to anything off-world, especially naysay if you're not a fellow Yid)

I happen to agree that an interactive and thus fully controlled set of
laser cannon beams from space to multiple terrestrial receiving
stations is perfectly doable, especially if tether deployed away from
the LSE-CM/ISS that's parked in the moon's L1 would get those fully
solar illuminated SBLs situated as close to Earth as you'd like, or
dare, along with the tether dipole itself offering teraWatts of energy
to spare.

Your 40% overall energy transfer efficiency wasn't even all that far
off.  Even a solar farm of reflectors merely giving a focused narrow
beam of the full solar spectrum isn't all that insurmountable,
although a solar pumped tight laser beam of mostly IR is perhaps best
suited for the task, whereas system robotics would avoid most any
unfortunate encounters with items not suited for surviving such beams
of raw energy.

Space Laser to Transmit Solar Power to Earth, By Hank Green (why the
hell not?)

I bet Willie Moo could do this rather nicely, starting off small and
growing along with the required expertise for making it happen in a
very big and clean enery way.

You've mischaracterized the active control system to make what I've
proposed seem outlandish and to force a negative conclusion.

4-wave mixing systems that use active holographic  techniques to
control a powerful laser have allowed lasers to penetrate sputtering
vapor and maintain focus on a target by avoiding the sputtered
particles.  The same techniques have been used to track targets.
These systems are easily adapted to controlling beams from space and
having the beams avoid unwanted targets while at the same time
illuminating desireable targets.

Furthermore, you are not clear about what constitutes a powerful beam
and what constitutes a dangerous beam.  These can be distinctly
different.

Proponents of microwave systems have promoted microwave beams that
1/10th to 1/100th as powerful as sunlight.  The great advantage is
that these sytems can operate 24/7 and deliver electricity as
efficiently as solar panels without the need for storing energy.

So, a powerful beam is something that's more powerful than 1/10th
solar intensity.  Also, the color of the beam is an important factor.
Invisible beams can pose far less risk at a given intentisity than
visible beams for example

So, details count.  The right details make a safe reliable system.
The wrong ones are easily shown to be infeasible, dangerous or
expensive.  Willfully choosing the wrong details and from that arguing
that the whole idea is ludicrous - is a maddening and dispiriting
exercise - and leaves any advance open to others who are not so narrow
minded and mean.

For the record, I have proposed large central solar collector arrays
in sunny regions of low cost silicon solar panels.

A laser operating at 1 micron would be nearly perfectly converted to
electricity - since the bandgap wavelength is 1.1 micron for silicon.
1 micron is also in one of the low dispersion atmospheric 'windows'
that permit the energy to travel largely unaffected.  1 micron is
invisible.

Sunlight falls on the Earth at about 1,000 watts per sq m.  Silicon is
about 18% efficient at converting sunlight to electricity.  So, 180
watts per sq m ELECTRICAL is produced.

Laser light at 1 micron can fall on the Earth at any power density we
design.  Looking at the solar spectra,we can see that the sun emits
about 380 watts per sq meter in the infrared portion of the spectrum.
Shining an infrared laser at this intensity causes no harm in to the
environment, since its what the environment has adapted to.

But 1 micron laser energizes silicon with about 85% efficiency after
passing through the air.  so,that 380 watts IR becomes 323 watts per
sq m ELECTRICAL.  Since the satellite operates 24/7 - the ground
system does too, with the exception of the occasional weather
interruption and that's minimized if the proper site is chosen.

The advantage of the satellite is easily seen.

Lets say we build a 8 million acre (32.4 billion sq m) solar collector
array 5 miles wide and 2,500 miles long along our Southern border, in
the high Sonoran desert there.  This is exposed to about 1,600 hours
of sunlight per year.  At 180 Watts per m2 this array produces 9.332
trillion kWh per year.  Used to desalinate seawater drawn from the
oceans near the border and decompose it into hydrogen and oxygen, this
solar panel array from sunlight alone would produce 186.6 million tons
of hydrogen gas each year.  This has a heat value of  1.2 billion tons
of coal.  So, by piping hydrogen gas made in this way to coal fired
power plants, those plants can immediately be converted to hydrogen
gas eliminating pollution from this source.  In fact,using 123 million
tons of hydrogen to displace 800 million tons of coal and then using
62.6 million tons of hydrogen to hydrogenate the stranded coal,
produces 5.6 billion barrels of liquid fuels each year (gasoline,
diesel fuel, jet fuel) - largely severing our reliance on foreign
sources of oil.  In fact this amount of oil plus the oil produced in
the US, provides for ALL US needs for liquid fuels - while reducing
our carbon emissions by half.

But lets add solar powersats to the picture - as described.

We add light-weight inflatable powersats to the picture that beam
energy reliably and safely to the 8 million acre ground site.  Another
323 Watts per sq meter electrical is produced by the same solar panel
array - IN ADDITION to the solar influx - and this is available 24/7
with only slight interruptions due to weather in some spots on rare
occasion.  So, this 323 watts is available 8766 hours a year - so each
square meter has added to the 288 kWh/year, 2.83 MWh/year - a 10 fold
increase!!!  Which is well worth the cost of the satellites, if
they're made and launched cheaply enough.

With no increase in the 32.4 billion sq m array footprint (merely
designing the entire system to operate at 3x nominal solar output)
total energy output is 101 trillion kWh per year.  This is enough to
create 2.02 billion metric tons of hydrogen gas.

Now, a ton of hydrogen has the same energy value when burned as;

4.5 tons anthracite
6.0 tons bituminous
10.2 tons lignite
23.4 barrels crude
1,190.0 gallons gasoline

Humanity currently uses 30 billion barrels of crude oil each year.  So
converting the heat value of this hydrogen to barrels of oil
equivalent - obtains 47.2 billion barrels equivalent.

This means that the US following this sort of program would not only
become energy independent with completion of the ground station
portion of this program, but would rise to dominate the world's energy
markets with completion of the space portion of this program - at
first by hydrogenating low rank carbon sources, and later, by selling
liquid hydrogen throughout the world.

Later still, advances in laser control could lead to direct beaming of
energy from space to users on the ground, stationary users at first,
and later mobile users.  Finally, lasers could power large spacecraft
and space propulsion systems, as well as space based factories.

I proposed this more than a decade ago - and have been ignored or
ridiculed while at the same time others have developed elements of
what I proposed without seeing the larger potential.  Too bad we
haven't jumped onto this more agressively.  A (Japanese) sociologist
told me once at a conference that a culture in decline, will avoid any
possibility for growth - he felt the US, and Europe generally were in
decline, whilst Asia was rising.  It need not be that way I replied.
But I'm not a sociologist.

Brad,

They may have told Edison he was nuts when he  tried to send high-
speed morse code across the Atlantic, or when he wanted to perfect the
lightbulb and mass produce it

They may have laughed at Ford's horseless carriage.

People may even have arrested Bell when he demonstrated his telephone
in Philadelphia.

But, that doesn't mean EVERY person they say was nuts is NOT nuts.

Sometimes, Brad, sometimes, the ridicule some receive is well
deserved.

Rarely, sometimes not.

In your case, Brad, in case there is any doubt in your mind (because
there is no doubt in anyone else's mind reading this) the ridicule
heaped upon you and your ideas, that ridicule is richly deserved.

I must also say that on occasion - I am sad that on that rare
occsasion - when you have been especially maddening, - I am sad that I
cannot reach through the monitor and do you serious bodily harm or
inflict lasting deep pain to you - preferably in a way that leaves you
physically disabled to match in some poetic way your obvious mental
disability.

I will finally say, that this resopnse by you to my commentary, though
not unexpected, is one of those rare times you are rather lucky I
cannot reach through the internet and slap you in the face.

Gee whiz, and here I'd been promoting most of everything you've got to

Silly old me for being 100% in support of what your supposed talent

since your proving that you can't tell the good guys from the bad, not
take the heat of this Usenet anti-think-tank of such a swarm like

&gt; diesel fuel, jet fuel) - largely severing our reliance on foreign
&gt; sources of oil.  In fact this amount of oil plus the oil produced in
&gt; the US, provides for ALL US needs for liquid fuels - while reducing
&gt; our carbon emissions by half.

&gt; But lets add solar powersats to the picture - as described.

&gt; We add light-weight inflatable powersats to the picture that beam
&gt; energy reliably and safely to the 8 million acre ground site.  Another
&gt; 323 Watts per sq meter electrical is produced by the same solar panel
&gt; array - IN ADDITION to the solar influx - and this is available 24/7
&gt; with only slight interruptions due to weather in some spots on rare
&gt; occasion.  So, this 323 watts is available 8766 hours a year - so each
&gt; square meter has added to the 288 kWh/year, 2.83 MWh/year - a 10 fold
&gt; increase!!!  Which is well worth the cost of the satellites, if
&gt; they're made and launched cheaply enough.

&gt; With no increase in the 32.4 billion sq m array footprint (merely
&gt; designing the entire system to operate at 3x nominal solar output)
&gt; total energy output is 101 trillion kWh per year.  This is enough to
&gt; create 2.02 billion metric tons of hydrogen gas.

&gt; Now, a ton of hydrogen has the same energy value when burned as;

&gt;       4.5 tons anthracite
&gt;       6.0 tons bituminous
&gt;      10.2 tons lignite
&gt;      23.4 barrels crude
&gt; 1,190.0 gallons gasoline

&gt; Humanity currently uses 30 billion barrels of crude oil each year.  So
&gt; converting the heat value of this hydrogen to barrels of oil
&gt; equivalent - obtains 47.2 billion barrels equivalent.

&gt; This means that the US following this sort of program would not only
&gt; become energy independent with completion of the ground station
&gt; portion of this program, but would rise to dominate the world's energy
&gt; markets with completion of the space portion of this program - at
&gt; first by hydrogenating low rank carbon sources, and later, by selling
&gt; liquid hydrogen throughout the world.

&gt; Later still, advances in laser control could lead to direct beaming of
&gt; energy from space to users on the ground, stationary users at first,
&gt; and later mobile users.  Finally, lasers could power large spacecraft
&gt; and space propulsion systems, as well as space based factories.

&gt; I proposed this more than a decade ago - and have been ignored or
&gt; ridiculed while at the same time others have developed elements of
&gt; what I proposed without seeing the larger potential.  Too bad we
&gt; haven't jumped onto this more agressively.  A (Japanese) sociologist
&gt; told me once at a conference that a culture in decline, will avoid any
&gt; possibility for growth - he felt the US, and Europe generally were in
&gt; decline, whilst Asia was rising.  It need not be that way I replied.
&gt; But I'm not a sociologist.- Hide quoted text -

You would do well to listen to it until the words sink in.

There is a concept called LOCUS OF CONTROL.  Children for example,
have their locus of control external to themselves.  So, they whine
and moan and complain about their situation and what others are doing
to them.  Adults generally speaking have their locus of control
inside.  So, they actually do things and take effective action in
response to challenges.  Statements such as the one you make above
clearly delineate you as the sort of person who hasn't really matured
as an adult, and has their locus of control firmly fixed up someone
else's ass.

The point is Bruth, is ITS ALL IN YOUR MIND.  Change your mind and
your problems will go away - and with it - all the effects of your
mental difficulties.

Well, sometimes things just won't work - there's always that to
consider.  And if anyone has a bright idea, its up to that person to
answer the negatives.  In a selling or management situation I've
always found that those who are the most critical of a new idea, are
the one's that are the most open minded.  They're actually considering
what it being told them and they're OBJECTING.  Any manager and
salesperson worth their salt knows that objections are but the first
step to closing a sale, or making a change in the way things are
done.  Any change agent knows that objections are positive results on
the path to creating the change they seek.  They also know that if
they're stuck, its due to their inability to usefully address specific
objections.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The earlier &quot;attacks&quot; were not casting aspersions on the technical
&gt; &gt; &gt; feasibility of space-based laser power beams.

&gt; &gt; Yes they were.

&gt; &gt; &gt; They were bringing up
&gt; &gt; &gt; legitimate concerns about the ability to send beams of high power
&gt; &gt; &gt; density through the air without risking damage to anything passing
&gt; &gt; &gt; through the beam.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (By the way, Hank Green's blog isn't a &quot;news service&quot;.)- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; You've mischaracterized the active control system to make what I've
&gt; &gt; proposed seem outlandish and to force a negative conclusion.

&gt; &gt; 4-wave mixing systems that use active holographic  techniques to
&gt; &gt; control a powerful laser have allowed lasers to penetrate sputtering
&gt; &gt; vapor and maintain focus on a target by avoiding the sputtered
&gt; &gt; particles.  The same techniques have been used to track targets.
&gt; &gt; These systems are easily adapted to controlling beams from space and
&gt; &gt; having the beams avoid unwanted targets while at the same time
&gt; &gt; illuminating desireable targets.

&gt; &gt; Furthermore, you are not clear about what constitutes a powerful beam
&gt; &gt; and what constitutes a dangerous beam.  These can be distinctly
&gt; &gt; different.

&gt; &gt; Proponents of microwave systems have promoted microwave beams that
&gt; &gt; 1/10th to 1/100th as powerful as sunlight.  The great advantage is
&gt; &gt; that these sytems can operate 24/7 and deliver electricity as
&gt; &gt; efficiently as solar panels without the need for storing energy.

&gt; &gt; So, a powerful beam is something that's more powerful than 1/10th
&gt; &gt; solar intensity.  Also, the color of the beam is an important factor.
&gt; &gt; Invisible beams can pose far less risk at a given intentisity than
&gt; &gt; visible beams for example

&gt; &gt; So, details count.  The right details make a safe reliable system.
&gt; &gt; The wrong ones are easily shown to be infeasible, dangerous or
&gt; &gt; expensive.  Willfully choosing the wrong details and from that arguing
&gt; &gt; that the whole idea is ludicrous - is a maddening and dispiriting
&gt; &gt; exercise - and leaves any advance open to others who are not so narrow
&gt; &gt; minded and mean.

&gt; &gt; For the record, I have proposed large central solar collector arrays
&gt; &gt; in sunny regions of low cost silicon solar panels.

&gt; &gt; A laser operating at 1 micron would be nearly perfectly converted to
&gt; &gt; electricity - since the bandgap wavelength is 1.1 micron for silicon.
&gt; &gt; 1 micron is also in one of the low dispersion atmospheric 'windows'
&gt; &gt; that permit the energy to travel largely unaffected.  1 micron is
&gt; &gt; invisible.

&gt; &gt; Sunlight falls on the Earth at about 1,000 watts per sq m.  Silicon is
&gt; &gt; about 18% efficient at converting sunlight to electricity.  So, 180
&gt; &gt; watts per sq m ELECTRICAL is produced.

&gt; &gt; Laser light at 1 micron can fall on the Earth at any power density we
&gt; &gt; design.  Looking at the solar spectra,we can see that the sun emits
&gt; &gt; about 380 watts per sq meter in the infrared portion of the spectrum.
&gt; &gt; Shining an infrared laser at this intensity causes no harm in to the
&gt; &gt; environment, since its what the environment has adapted to.

&gt; &gt; But 1 micron laser energizes silicon with about 85% efficiency after
&gt; &gt; passing through the air.  so,that 380 watts IR becomes 323 watts per
&gt; &gt; sq m ELECTRICAL.  Since the satellite operates 24/7 - the ground
&gt; &gt; system does too, with the exception of the occasional weather
&gt; &gt; interruption and that's minimized if the proper site is chosen.

&gt; &gt; The advantage of the satellite is easily seen.

&gt; &gt; Lets say we build a 8 million acre (32.4 billion sq m) solar collector
&gt; &gt; array 5 miles wide and 2,500 miles long along our Southern border, in
&gt; &gt; the high Sonoran desert there.  This is exposed to about 1,600 hours
&gt; &gt; of sunlight per year.  At 180 Watts per m2 this array produces 9.332
&gt; &gt; trillion kWh per year.  Used to desalinate seawater drawn from the
&gt; &gt; oceans near the border and decompose it into hydrogen and oxygen, this
&gt; &gt; solar panel array from sunlight alone would produce 186.6 million tons
&gt; &gt; of hydrogen gas each year.  This has a heat value of  1.2 billion tons
&gt; &gt; of coal.  So, by piping hydrogen gas made in this way to coal fired
&gt; &gt; power plants, those plants can immediately be converted to hydrogen
&gt; &gt; gas eliminating pollution from this source.  In fact,using 123 million
&gt; &gt; tons of hydrogen to displace 800 million tons of coal and then using
&gt; &gt; 62.6 million tons of hydrogen to hydrogenate the stranded coal,
&gt; &gt; produces 5.6 billion barrels of liquid fuels each year (gasoline,
&gt; &gt; diesel fuel, jet fuel) - largely severing our reliance on foreign
&gt; &gt; sources of oil.  In fact this amount of oil plus the oil produced in
&gt; &gt; the US, provides for ALL US needs for liquid fuels - while reducing
&gt; &gt; our carbon emissions by half.

&gt; &gt; But lets add solar powersats to the picture - as described.

&gt; &gt; We add light-weight inflatable powersats to the picture that beam
&gt; &gt; energy reliably and safely to the 8 million acre ground site.  Another
&gt; &gt; 323 Watts per sq meter electrical is produced by the same solar panel
&gt; &gt; array - IN ADDITION to the solar influx - and this is available 24/7
&gt; &gt; with only slight interruptions due to weather in some spots on rare
&gt; &gt; occasion.  So, this 323 watts is available 8766 hours a year - so each
&gt; &gt; square meter has added to the 288 kWh/year, 2.83 MWh/year - a 10 fold
&gt; &gt; increase!!!  Which is well worth the cost of the satellites, if
&gt; &gt; they're made and launched cheaply enough.

&gt; &gt; With no increase in the 32.4 billion sq m array footprint (merely
&gt; &gt; designing the entire system to operate at 3x nominal solar output)
&gt; &gt; total energy output is 101 trillion kWh per year.  This is enough to
&gt; &gt; create 2.02 billion metric tons of hydrogen gas.

&gt; &gt; Now, a ton of hydrogen has the same energy value when burned as;

&gt; &gt;       4.5 tons anthracite
&gt; &gt;       6.0 tons bituminous
&gt; &gt;      10.2 tons lignite
&gt; &gt;      23.4 barrels crude
&gt; &gt; 1,190.0 gallons gasoline

&gt; &gt; Humanity currently uses 30 billion barrels of crude oil each year.  So
&gt; &gt; converting the heat value of this hydrogen to barrels of oil
&gt; &gt; equivalent - obtains 47.2 billion barrels equivalent.

&gt; &gt; This means that the US following this sort of program would not only
&gt; &gt; become energy independent with completion of the ground station
&gt; &gt; portion of this program, but would rise to dominate the world's energy
&gt; &gt; markets with completion of the space portion of this program - at

sympathy for your parents - and want nothing to do with you.  And if I
could, I would kick you in the nuts whenever you thought of reading my
shit - that way I wouldn't have to deal with you at all.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Brad,

&gt; &gt; &gt; They may have told Edison he was nuts when he  tried to send high-
&gt; &gt; &gt; speed morse code across the Atlantic, or when he wanted to perfect the
&gt; &gt; &gt; lightbulb and mass produce it

&gt; &gt; &gt; They may have laughed at Ford's horseless carriage.

&gt; &gt; &gt; People may even have arrested Bell when he demonstrated his telephone
&gt; &gt; &gt; in Philadelphia.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But, that doesn't mean EVERY person they say was nuts is NOT nuts.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes, Brad, sometimes, the ridicule some receive is well
&gt; &gt; &gt; deserved.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Rarely, sometimes not.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In your case, Brad, in case there is any doubt in your mind (because
&gt; &gt; &gt; there is no doubt in anyone else's mind reading this) the ridicule
&gt; &gt; &gt; heaped upon you and your ideas, that ridicule is richly deserved.

&gt; &gt; In other words, deep down in your little black heart you really don't
&gt; &gt; give a hockypuck about salvaging our environment, nor do you believe
&gt; &gt; in the regular laws of physics, or in utilizing the best available
&gt; &gt; science.  Now I understand, fully.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I must also say that on occasion - I am sad that on that rare
&gt; &gt; &gt; occsasion - when you have been especially maddening, - I am sad that I
&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot reach through the monitor and do you serious bodily harm or
&gt; &gt; &gt; inflict lasting deep pain to you - preferably in a way that leaves you
&gt; &gt; &gt; physically disabled to match in some poetic way your obvious mental
&gt; &gt; &gt; disability.

&gt; &gt; Gee whiz, and here I'd been promoting most of everything you've got to
&gt; &gt; offer (though no one is perfect, including Einstein or yourself),

&gt; I never claimed perfection - and I never asked for or sought your
&gt; support.  haha..  C'mon - this is the oldest trick in the book.  The
&gt; opposition pays all the whores pimps drug dealers to come to a meeting
&gt; and disrupt it with their foolishness, and then they complain loudly,
&gt; fight and generally tear up the place when they're asked to leave -
&gt; and THAT becomes the story at 11...

&gt; The only way to deal with that is to have strong capable bouncers scan
&gt; everyone as the approach the meeting hall, and 'persuade'
&gt; 'undesireables' to move along...  without a publc outcry - again a
&gt; swift kick to the groin to the baddest of these is generally
&gt; sufficient - but alas, you cannot do this on internet!  haha..

&gt; So, don't cry alligator tears to me Bruth  - I know your game - and
&gt; you feel yourself immune.  You gotta know exactly what you're doing.

&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; just as I'd said that if I were ever put in charge, whereas apparently
&gt; &gt; I'd be the only one forking out a nifty 50/50 worth of R&amp;D matching
&gt; &gt; funds on your warm and fuzzy behalf.

&gt; You have never given me funds for anything, you have never offered
&gt; funds to me, you have never been asked for funds from me, you most
&gt; likely have no funds to give to anyone anyway - it all being in your
&gt; head.  So, I gotta ask - WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.   You
&gt; either say things because it gives you a hard on for the moment to
&gt; imagine they're true - so, its all mental masturbation - or you are
&gt; fond of saying things that are damable lies.

&gt; &gt; Sorry, my mistake,

&gt; Yes.  I don't want need or value your support.  If you'd like to earn
&gt; by gratitude and lasting admiration there is one thing and  ONE THING
&gt; only you can do.  Commit yourself to not posting writing or even
&gt; reading anything online for a year.  Do, that and then we can talk
&gt; AFTER.

&gt; &gt; as I'd rather
&gt; &gt; stick with those ENRON/Exxon types that get loads of stuff
&gt; &gt; accomplished, though spendy, polluting and even somewhat lethal as all
&gt; &gt; get out.

&gt; Enron got nothing done and they ended up in jail and the poorhouse -
&gt; so this makes no sense.  Exxon is a respected and quite capable
&gt; company that produces a goodly precentage of all the energy used on
&gt; Earth.  They have no idea of what sort of strategy will secure their
&gt; survival and dominance for the next 30 years.  Their behavior shouts
&gt; this from the tree-tops.  This is actually a quite hopeful sign to
&gt; those who DO have a workable strategy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I will finally say, that this resopnse by you to my commentary, though
&gt; &gt; &gt; not unexpected, is one of those rare times you are rather lucky I
&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot reach through the internet and slap you in the face.

&gt; &gt; Face slapping?

&gt; Or groin kicking yes.  Preferably when you read my stuff, rather than
&gt; after you post.  That way, the message is clear.  Don't read Mook's
&gt; shit Bruth - you'll get a pain in the nuts if you do.  and you move
&gt; on.  See?   If there is anything in the usenet universe that would
&gt; bring me everlasting joy and happiness - it isthat.  Whenever you
&gt; THINK about reading my shit, you get a pain in your nuts, and decide
&gt; differently.

&gt; So, to that extent, I would like to kick you in th enuts.  I get an
&gt; alert that you've pulled up a post of mine, I reach through the
&gt; monitor with my boot, and kick you in the nuts.  I do that until you
&gt; stop reading my shit.  See?

&gt; After that, I don't care what the hell you do!  haha..

&gt; &gt; Silly old me for being 100% in support of what your supposed talent
&gt; &gt; and expertise has to offer,

&gt; Yeah, well, like Huey Long's kicking the whores and whatnot out of his
&gt; meetings - I didn't ask you to attend in the first place.  Move
&gt; along!  lol.

&gt; &gt;  on behalf of your intentions of improving
&gt; &gt; our global environment

&gt; Since I would actually like to do  something of value - I would like
&gt; not to have to deal with you AT ALL!

&gt; &gt; on such a grand scale, and for the greater good
&gt; &gt; of humanity to boot.  I'll see what I can manage in order to return
&gt; &gt; the warm and fuzzy favor with all the &quot;face slapping&quot; love and
&gt; &gt; affection that I can muster.

&gt; Like I said, I don't even read your shit, unless its in response to
&gt; something I've said, and then I generally ignore it.  But since you
&gt; took the trouble to say something nice about me - I wanted to make it
&gt; clear to anyone who reads this that I have nothing but the deepest
&gt; sympathy for your parents - and want nothing to do with you.  And if I
&gt; could, I would kick you in the nuts whenever you thought of reading my

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They may have laughed at Ford's horseless carriage.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; People may even have arrested Bell when he demonstrated his telephone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Philadelphia.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, that doesn't mean EVERY person they say was nuts is NOT nuts.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes, Brad, sometimes, the ridicule some receive is well
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deserved.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rarely, sometimes not.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In your case, Brad, in case there is any doubt in your mind (because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is no doubt in anyone else's mind reading this) the ridicule
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heaped upon you and your ideas, that ridicule is richly deserved.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In other words, deep down in your little black heart you really don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; give a hockypuck about salvaging our environment, nor do you believe
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the regular laws of physics, or in utilizing the best available
&gt; &gt; &gt; science.  Now I understand, fully.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I must also say that on occasion - I am sad that on that rare
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occsasion - when you have been especially maddening, - I am sad that I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot reach through the monitor and do you serious bodily harm or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inflict lasting deep pain to you - preferably in a way that leaves you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physically disabled to match in some poetic way your obvious mental
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disability.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Gee whiz, and here I'd been promoting most of everything you've got to
&gt; &gt; &gt; offer (though no one is perfect, including Einstein or yourself),

&gt; &gt; I never claimed perfection - and I never asked for or sought your
&gt; &gt; support.  haha..  C'mon - this is the oldest trick in the book.  The
&gt; &gt; opposition pays all the whores pimps drug dealers to come to a meeting
&gt; &gt; and disrupt it with their foolishness, and then they complain loudly,
&gt; &gt; fight and generally tear up the place when they're asked to leave -
&gt; &gt; and THAT becomes the story at 11...

&gt; &gt; The only way to deal with that is to have strong capable bouncers scan
&gt; &gt; everyone as the approach the meeting hall, and 'persuade'
&gt; &gt; 'undesireables' to move along...  without a publc outcry - again a
&gt; &gt; swift kick to the groin to the baddest of these is generally
&gt; &gt; sufficient - but alas, you cannot do this on internet!  haha..

&gt; &gt; So, don't cry alligator tears to me Bruth  - I know your game - and
&gt; &gt; you feel yourself immune.  You gotta know exactly what you're doing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; just as I'd said that if I were ever put in charge, whereas apparently
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd be the only one forking out a nifty 50/50 worth of R&amp;D matching
&gt; &gt; &gt; funds on your warm and fuzzy behalf.

&gt; &gt; You have never given me funds for anything, you have never offered
&gt; &gt; funds to me, you have never been asked for funds from me, you most
&gt; &gt; likely have no funds to give to anyone anyway - it all being in your
&gt; &gt; head.  So, I gotta ask - WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.   You
&gt; &gt; either say things because it gives you a hard on for the moment to
&gt; &gt; imagine they're true - so, its all mental masturbation - or you are
&gt; &gt; fond of saying things that are damable lies.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, my mistake,

&gt; &gt; Yes.  I don't want need or value your support.  If you'd like to earn
&gt; &gt; by gratitude and lasting admiration there is one thing and  ONE THING
&gt; &gt; only you can do.  Commit yourself to not posting writing or even
&gt; &gt; reading anything online for a year.  Do, that and then we can talk
&gt; &gt; AFTER.

&gt; &gt; &gt; as I'd rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; stick with those ENRON/Exxon types that get loads of stuff
&gt; &gt; &gt; accomplished, though spendy, polluting and even somewhat lethal as all
&gt; &gt; &gt; get out.

&gt; &gt; Enron got nothing done and they ended up in jail and the poorhouse -
&gt; &gt; so this makes no sense.  Exxon is a respected and quite capable
&gt; &gt; company that produces a goodly precentage of all the energy used on
&gt; &gt; Earth.  They have no idea of what sort of strategy will secure their
&gt; &gt; survival and dominance for the next 30 years.  Their behavior shouts
&gt; &gt; this from the tree-tops.  This is actually a quite hopeful sign to
&gt; &gt; those who DO have a workable strategy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will finally say, that this resopnse by you to my commentary, though
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not unexpected, is one of those rare times you are rather lucky I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot reach through the internet and slap you in the face.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Face slapping?

&gt; &gt; Or groin kicking yes.  Preferably when you read my stuff, rather than
&gt; &gt; after you post.  That way, the message is clear.  Don't read Mook's
&gt; &gt; shit Bruth - you'll get a pain in the nuts if you do.  and you move
&gt; &gt; on.  See?   If there is anything in the usenet universe that would
&gt; &gt; bring me everlasting joy and happiness - it isthat.  Whenever you
&gt; &gt; THINK about reading my shit, you get a pain in your nuts, and decide
&gt; &gt; differently.

&gt; &gt; So, to that extent, I would like to kick you in th enuts.  I get an
&gt; &gt; alert that you've pulled up a post of mine, I reach through the
&gt; &gt; monitor with my boot, and kick you in the nuts.  I do that until you
&gt; &gt; stop reading my shit.  See?

&gt; &gt; After that, I don't care what the hell you do!  haha..

&gt; &gt; &gt; Silly old me for being 100% in support of what your supposed talent
&gt; &gt; &gt; and expertise has to offer,

&gt; &gt; Yeah, well, like Huey Long's kicking the whores and whatnot out of his
&gt; &gt; meetings - I didn't ask you to attend in the first place.  Move
&gt; &gt; along!  lol.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  on behalf of your intentions of improving
&gt; &gt; &gt; our global environment

&gt; &gt; Since I would actually like to do  something of value - I would like
&gt; &gt; not to have to deal with you AT ALL!

&gt; &gt; &gt; on such a grand scale, and for the greater good
&gt; &gt; &gt; of humanity to boot.  I'll see what I can manage in order to return
&gt; &gt; &gt; the warm and fuzzy favor with all the &quot;face slapping&quot; love and
&gt; &gt; &gt; affection that I can muster.

&gt; &gt; Like I said, I don't even read your shit, unless its in response to
&gt; &gt; something I've said, and then I generally ignore it.  But since you
&gt; &gt; took the trouble to say something nice about me - I wanted to make it
&gt; &gt; clear to anyone who reads this that I have nothing but the deepest
&gt; &gt; sympathy for your parents - and want nothing to do with you.  And if I
&gt; &gt; could, I would kick you in the nuts whenever you thought of reading my
&gt; &gt; shit - that way I wouldn't have to deal with you at all.

&gt;Subject: Solar powered lasers in space

&gt;In 1996 I wrote in these newsgroups about an idea I had worked out
&gt;about using thin film reflectors inflated on orbit to concentrate
&gt;sunlight onto a solar pumped laser.  That laser beam would be beamed
&gt;to receivers on the ground which would convert the power to
&gt;electricity and thermal energy for industrial use.  Overall
&gt;efficiency would be 40%

&gt;I was roundly attacked by all - and so, it was with great interest
&gt;that I read the following on yahoo news service in 2007;
&gt; http://green.yahoo.com/index.php?q=node/1521

&gt;I am fully justified in my earlier statements - and all those who
&gt;mercilessly attacked me have been proved dead wrong in their negative
&gt;assessments of my ideas.

There's no question that your entro topic was 100% correct.

However, notice that I haven't attacked but always fully supported the
use of SBLs and of those being solar energy pumped or tether dipole
energy pumped.  The very basis of my LSE-CM/ISS within the moon's L1
and of its tether dipole element that'll reach and sustain such SBLs
to within 2r of Earth was entirely promoted as an array of 100 GW
class of such laser cannons.

Notice that you're the one as having been continually attacked by
those I and others would claim to be Third Reich supporters and
Yiddish to boot, and they are still the ones continually attacking in
ways of Usenet topic/author stocking, bashings and/or banishment,
because it's what they do best to outsiders like yourself.  You could
even be Jesus Christ as one of their own kind, and for another PR
stunt they'd allow your butt to being put on a stick, so there's
really nothing they wouldn't do for their next buck or whatever PR
support they can drum up, and it's also why they are in charge of most
everything that counts.  Like most of us village idiots, you're just
to far snookered and dumbfounded past the

&gt; &gt; I agree, but why are you so afraid to name names,

&gt; smart enough to take responsibility for your own miserable life you

&gt; &gt; that are in charge of our mainstream media
&gt; &gt; and public education none the less?

&gt; If I can't change YOUR behavior talking DIRECTLY TO YOU in the most

&gt; AT ALL?  Its all mental masturbation douchebag - GIVE IT UP AND LEAVE
&gt; ME THE FUCK ALONE

&gt; Don't even think of reading my shit, let alone commenting on it or
&gt; arguing with me you worthless puke.

&gt; &gt; &gt; While such systems are successful in the short term, in the long term,
&gt; &gt; &gt; such disinformation campaigns undermine the very powers that seek

Thank you.  You understand.  I gave this example to illustrate the
power of adaptive optics properly set up.  There are two factors, you
got one of them - time - the other is resolution.  This is easily
computed by using the Rayleigh Criterion for Optics.

Yes the ability to penetrate dust and fog may be somewhat limited
because say from LEO - an altitude of say 300 km, response times are
milli-seconds, So, if a 10 micrometer particle moves 100 microns in 2
milliseconds, the adaptive optics will cast a shadow where it was a
millisecond ago.  If particle separatoin is 500 micron - this may not
be a problem - all we're trying to do is project energy through the
dust and fog - we don't have to be perfect.  So, in this instance -
defocusing the shadow by adjusting the optics a little, to create a
larger shadow centered on where the particle was - can work - up to a
certain particle speed and density.

So, if you go through all the calculations, it might be possible to
penetrate light haze and fog - but not heavier stuff.  from LEO.  From
GEO you just have to accept that you're going to be scattered by haze
and fog of any amount.

But that's okay - because you can operate in regions where haze and
fog are generally not an issue - high deserts for example.

The important thing is that even in GEO - where the altitude gives you
quarter second response times - you can accurately trace a receiver
and deliver power to it, and interrupt it if there's a large object
between the receiver and transmitter faster than most fuses work

The systemwill automatically cut off if fog or haze grows too thick.
The defocusing trick I just described, to penetrate light fog from low
altitude, will actually cut off power altogether at higher altitudes!
That is, if the shadows through a trick of optics cover the whole
beam, the beam is shut off.

Which combined with finding the target, cutting off the beam if
conditions weren't perfect is all you really need to do to have a safe
realiable service.

So, while I gave the ability to penetrate sputtering particles as an
example of the speed and accuracy possible with adaptive optics, I am
not saying we'll be able to deliver power from GEO through fog or
clouds - but the system properly adapted to the task is certainly fast
enough for tracking a target even if its moving, and interrupting
service to a panel that happens to have an object in the beam.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yep.   At GEO 36,708 km - round trip travel times 244.72 milliseconds
- 122x longer still.  I envision a system of satellites in GEO beaming
1 micron energy to the high desert to large centralized arrays
originally put up to collect solar energy.  The energy density is 323
watts/m2 - which is no more than what the sun puts out during the day
in the IR.  A 1/4 second response time means that a square meter of
surface will recieve a total of 81 joules before it cuts out.  That's
8 millijoules per square cm.  In a quarter second,8 milli-joules per
sq cm.

323 watts of IR energy fully absorbed by an object would be heated at
1/3 the rate at which the sun heats an object in broad daylight.

Is this dangerous?  I don't think so.  A 2,000 watt portable hair
dryer has a nozzle about 20 cm2 in area - that's 100 watts per sq cm -
and in 1/4 second it will deliver 25 joules per sq cm. -

So, I did this experiment - hold your hand in front of a hair dryiery
for 1/4 second at full blast.  You'll feel it, but it won't be
dangerous.

Now, radiant energy is different than convection - which is how the
hair dryer works. But, that effects the rate and efficiency of the
heating - not the total amounts we're talking about.  We're saying the
transfer is 100% in both cases.  In actuality, if your hand, or
whatever is in the beam, reflects IR - then, heating will be far less
than in the case of convection. (air moving against your hand)

Yes, but even if there was no shadowing at all (which there is) and
your hand received the full brunt of the beam - it would recieve about
2 millijoules per square cm - compare this to 25 joules per sq cm you
get from a hair drying at full blast.  You'll feel it - but it won't
damage you - much like tripping a fuse.

Remembrer fuses operate by limiting the amount of total energy that
gets discharged in a body.    This works the same way.

You are defining edge heating of a moving object in an extended beam.
Wave your hand quickly through a small beam and the leading and
trailing edges of your hand  (in a perfectly focused system) would be
warmed but wouldn't get too hot before it left the beam.  It takes
time for a given power level to deliver energy to your hand.  That's
why you can flick a coal out of a hot fire back into the fire. That's
why you can get a jolt of electricity until the fuse kicks in - and
survive.

Hold you hand steady in the beam for a quarter second, and the beam
even if it originates at GEO will shadow your hand.  Change the
optical setup slightly on the satellite, and you'll find the shadow in
the beam of your hand is magnified say 3x  - and you will find that
even while moving you won't get edge heating.

All we need is a fuse, and the 4-wave mixing delivers that.

&gt; How b A
&gt; bird flying into the beam at a sedate ten miles per hour would have the
&gt; leading half inch of its head and wings exposed to the full strength of
&gt; the beam.
">

Yes edge effects.  And the beam delivers a whopping 1/30th watts per
square cm around the edges of the bird.  1/3 full solar intensity,
1/3000th hair dryer intensity.

And he would get that heating effect for the entire time he flew
through the beam.  Say the beam is 8 feet wide - so,at 10 mph the bird
is travelling 14.5 ft per second.  He gets this heating effect for
about 55 milliseconds -

Now here's an interesting point..

A small beam, delivered at high intensity, is as safe as a big beam
delivered at low intensity.

A beam of 323 watt per sq m (1/3 watt/cm2) delivering 10 kW would have
an area of about 30 sq m. and be 6.2 m wide - about 20 feet.  Our bird
would be in the beam 1-1/4 seconds.  He would recieve 1/3 watts per sq
cm.  So, he'd get less than 1/2 joule per sq cm.

A beam of 1,000,000 watts per sq m (100 watts/cm2 = hair dryer)
delivering 10 kW would have an area of 1/100h sq m and be 11.3 cm wide
- about 4-1/2 inches in diameter.  Our bird would be in the beam 40
milliseconds.  He would get zapped with 100 watts/cm2 - a total of 4
joules per sq cm.

If he landed on the reciiever and perched there - it would take 1/4
second for the beam to cut off.  In the first case he'd recieve 1/12th
joule per sq cm.  In the hypothetical hair dryer case - ultra high
intensity (not being considered for actual construction) he'd get no
more than 25 joules per sq cm.  Again, hold your hand in front of a
2,000 watt hair dryer for 1/4 second and feel the effects.

And by putting a slight magnification in the beam optics - he'd be
safe there until he decided to leave.  And the power would come on
about 1/8th second later.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A small aircraft flying at 200 knots would travel more than
&gt; 20 cm in the time it takes for the active holographic technique to
&gt; respond.
">

Yes.  There are edge effects that get progressively worse as speed and
distance increases.  By careful design of the optical path, shadows at
the ground are magnified by a given factor, which eliminates those
effects within 1/8th second -

Which is my point.

Time and intensity determine how much energy is deposited on an
object.  The system I describe can reduce that energy to safe levels -
allowing a safe relaible energy transfer method.

A large centralized array covering millions of acres would have well
defined corridors air traffic would fly over.  There are actually
regions of the US where overflight is prohibited,and that happens to
be in some of the sunniest regions of the country.  Those would be
ideal collector sites.

But even to an aircraft off course - it would be shadowed by the
satelite - even if located in GEO - in 1/8th second by casting a
magnified shadow back around the aircraft.  At 323 Watts/m2 - it would
recieve 1/3 the energy of sunlight - for 1/4 second.  At 1,000,000
watts/m2 - the same intensity as a hair dryer - the aircraft would
receive an IR heat load of 250 kJ per m2 - the same amount of energy
it would recieve sitting 4 minutes in the sun.  A slight temperature
rise, but nothing destructive.

I'm not proposing 1,000,000 w/m2 - I'm proposing 323 W/m2 - but even
at the higher figure, heating effects are acceptable with a properly
engineered adaptive optics..

A smaller receiver for home or industrial use - would only be a few
meters wide - or at the higher level, a few cm wide - and an

Your warm and fuzzy naysayism is noted.  Is it also Yiddish?

No-fly zones could also be surrounded by low energy visible laser
beams at a safe enough distance from each primary IR beam of high
energy, say given as much as a good km in all directions should be
sufficient in case anything important was getting too close to the
primary beam of highly concentrated energy.

Even within a 100 meter radius of a no-fly zone would be sufficient,
whereas the detections of small aircraft is certainly not a problem,
whereas birds and us mere humans are always getting into such places
we're not supposed to be, such as drifting our crap into those high
voltage transmission lines and/or falling off of tall places or
drowning ourselves along with any number of other dumbfounded methods
of causing our own demise, seems to be a human genetic mutation
disorder that far too many of us have to live with, or at least die
while trying to live.

There's no such thing as 100% safe energy, as not even mother nature's
energy is safe or sane enough to take for granted.  You could even be
in trouble if you fart and light a match.

40% seems a very high efficiency for a laser, but even if this figure
is accepted there is one overiding problem. At noon in a desert you
have about 1kw/m^2 coming in through solar power anyway. The obvious
question to me is why not have solar power in the desrt and be done
with it. Lets generate power and split water into hydrogen and oxygen
in the desert using the energy that comes from the Sun anyway. Why
have a space laser as an intermediate stage?

Is it to get power 24/7? Well you have to be above LEO to effectively
extend the desert day.

The usual version of a space energy system is a microwave system. This
has the advantage that it could be beamed fairly close (close enough
for high voltage transmission lines to be practical) to where it is
consumed. Would be at MEO and operating 24/7. Phased arrays would
ensure the correct location and the correct amount at each location.

There again the system would have to be economical with regard to
alternative concepts. My pet concept is in fact a biological system
for generating hydrogen.

In fact the niche a laser system would occupy is in fact that of
providing intense energy for space launches and possibly for other
types of transportation.

Let us think for a moment about optical systems, phase arrays etc.
Some time ago I contributed to a thread on a space telescope

http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sci.space.policy/browse_frm/thread/8...

and came to the conclusion that in space diffraction limited optics
could be made extremely large. Suppose our laser system (it is
important to have a system not just a sinle laser) is 1km across, we
wish to focus on an area 1.22m in diameter, we are 10,000km away, and
our wavelength is 1 micron. How large? 1.22 lambda/d = 1,000,000 and
we are 10^7 m away. We need a mirror approx 10m across. 100m would be
quite easy to build.

The talk in another posting was about velocities and reaction times.
In fact the criteria is unanticipated acceleration. The velocity can
be anticipated. Lasers are capable of giving hundreds of MW/m^2 if
focussed. That is their forte. Not in power generation systems.

Lasers could help with deep space probes and also with supersonic and
hypersonic aviation. I understand that NASA has in fact performed
tests using a ground based system.

You add the satellite to lower costs...  that's the point.  You lower
costs by increasing the capital utilization of the equipment.

BACKGROUND - SOLAR PANELS

PHYSICS
The sun is a thermal source emitting all colors.  Silicon has a
specific bandgap energy at 1,108 nm which absorbs all wavelengths
shorter than that bandgap color, and converts each color with an
efficiency of  the ratio of the wavelength absorbed relative to the
bandgap wavelength.  So, 1,100 nm is almost perfectly absorbed.  550
nm is converted to electrical action at 50% efficiency  275 nm is
converted to electrical action at 25% efficiency - because the bandgap
energy is fixed.   ALL the energy of wavelengths longer than 1108 nm
is lost - its converted with 0% efficiency.  Summing across all the
wavelengths in a real system - you get about 180 watts electrical for
each 1000 watts solar put in.

UTILIZATION
Now in a desert region we have in North America the equivalanet of
1,600 hours of sunlight per year.  That's because of seasonal
variation and cosine effects.  The sun at dawn and dusk illuminates
the terrain at an angle.  Its only at noon at certain times of the
year that you get peak power.  All other times light comes in at an
angle and is lower intensity.  So, you have an effective peak power
output of 1,600 hours.

OUTPUT AND COSTS
Energy is measured in kWh.  So, each kW of panel from sunlight
produces in this scenario 1,600 kWh.

The cost of this system is lets say $1,000 per peak kilo-watt - and it
has a lifetime of 20 years.  That means you're paying $50.00 a year
for the equipment.  If you borrowed the money and paid it back over 20
years, you'd pay more like $100.00 a year for the equipment.  Lets say
there are no other costs to keep it simple - since these are the main
costs.  Then you're paying $100 for 1,600 kWh - that's 6.25 cents per
kWh.

BACKGROUND LASER POWER SAT

LASER POWER PHYSICS

Lets ADD a powersat that beam laser energy at 1,000 nm (1 um) onto
this same panel array.  The laser energy is converted by the silicon
with nearly perfect efficiency.  1,0000 nm / 1,108 nm = 90.25% -
scattering in the air subtracts another 5% -   So, for each 1,000
watts of laser you get 850 watts electrical.

INTENSITY
If we decide to emit the same 1,000 watts per square meter the sun
produces, using a solar pumped laser in space, then we obtain 850
watts electrical per square meter on the ground.  This adds to the 180
watts electrical each square meter produces from sunlight.

COST OF PEAK WATT ON THE GROUND
This is the first advantage of a power sat.  We said it cost $1 per
peak watt for the solar panel installation in our example above.  This
is $180 per square meter of panels.  Reusing the same installation for
a solar power receiver at the intensity described above means that
$180 per square meter is spread across 850 watts electrical output
from the satellite.  So, the ground station costs are reduced from $1
per peak watt to ,

$180/850 = $0.212

21.2 cents per peak watt - for the ground statoin side - or $212 per
peak kW.

UTILIZATION

The solar pumped laser is at GEO - hovering stationary above the panel
array.  The laser satellite illuminates the panels nearly all the time
and totals.nearly 8,766 hours per year - except for a few minutes when
Earth's shadow eclipses the satellite.

.
OUTPUT AND COSTS
Like the solar panels, the energy is kWh, so each kW of panels and
satellite  produces a total of 8,766 hours of satellite power per
year.

Lets say that each kilowatt of solar laser power on orbit costs
$6,000.  A satellite is mostly thin film highly reflective plastic
focusing sunlight onto a special device called a fabrey-perot cell -
filled with materials that lase at 1,000 nm.  This laser beam passes
through a window of special adaptive optical window that adjusts the
beam in response to a controlling pilot beam from the panel array on
the ground so that the power safely and reliably falls on the panels
and nowhere else.

Launch costs are approximately $10,000 per kg and construction costs
in the aerospace business are around $2,500 per kg.  The costs of raw
materials are nil compared to these costs. The bulk of the weight of
the satellite is the thin film material - and so knowing the thickness
of this the efficiency of converting sunlight to laser light - we can
compute the area of the film and its weight - and add a correction to
estimate what the laser and controls would weigh - and multiply by the
figures above to get a preliminary estimate of satellite costs - and
see that $5 per watt is accurate.

Conversion efficiencies of sunlight to laser light at 1,000 nm can
exceed 22% The solar constant on orbit is 1,366 watts per sq m.  So,
each kilowatt of laser energy requires;

1,000 / (1,366 x 0.22) =   3.33 sq m per kW laser

Now GBO (Giant birefringent Optical) material very efficiently
reflects light in thicknesses of 50 microns.  The same material
without birefringent layering - is highly transparent.  It is a thermo
plastic.  So, it can be welded and formed quite easily.  A reflective
disk bonded to a transparent front encircled by a transparent 'tire'
and inflated at low pressure - creates a large concave surface.

By controlling the thickness of the reflective surface, from 100
microns to 25 microns - with an average of 50 - the normally spherical
cavity - can be made parabolic.

The thermoplastic has a density of 1,200 kg per cubic meter.  Two
sheets 50 microns thick, covering 3.33 sq m amounts to  199.8
milligrams!

The cost as we said above is $12,500 per kg to build something and put
it into space.  So, each kilowatt is $2.50 -

Now, this is the cost to LEO - low earth orbit.  To get the system up
to GEO doubles the mass on LEO - because we need a kick stage - and
that's where we get $5.00 per watt of laser energy.

Investing in reusable launchers to cut the cost of launch to $500 per
kg - and in production systems to reduc the cost of hardware to $500
per kg - would cut these costs to $1,000 per kg - and cost of laser
energy from space accordingly.

Now, the large film that concentrates the laser light is by far the
most massive part of the system.  The laser and control window account
for no more than 10% of the mass on orbit... lets add another 10% for
hardware to help the system deploy - principally gases to inflate the
20,000 to 1 concentrator..

We're up to $6.00 per peak kilowatt now.

Wait a minute, we just showed how we could produce a powersat on orbit
for $6 per peak kilowatt - NOT $6,000 per peak kilowatt!!!!   how
could that be?  It could be because we are not constrained by the
safety concerns we are on Earth.  We don't have environmental impact
around the satellite, and we can operate at very high power densities
- so, we can design an optimal system.

But to make my original point about the cost efficiency of powersats -
lets just arbitrarily multiply everything by 1,000 for the space
system...  That makes our cost for the laser system equal to $6,212
per peak watt.

Lets say this system has the same 20 year lifespan as the receiver on
the ground.  And lets say we have the same cost of capital - so we
take the $100 per year per kW and multiply it by the same factors as
in the solar panel case - and voila - we have $621.20 per year per kW.

But, we're getting 8,766 kWh out of each kW installed - so that means
our cost per kWh has become;

$621.20 / 8,766 = $0.07 per kWh

But since we're counting the ground system cost twice, we can subtract
this out to obtain;

$600 per year / 8,766 kWh per year = $0.0684 per kWh.

For the space based system.

If we use our original figures - we have

$27.20 / 8,766 = 0.31 cents per kWh

Reducing costs on the ground to $18 per square meter

$8.12 / 8,766 = 0.21 cents per kWh

Reducing launch and production costs of powersat and ground costs to
$18 per square meter

$2.65 / 8,766 = 0.03 cents per kWh

So, we can see that we can build low cost solar panels and then update
them with solar pumped laser sats in space - and even if the costs of
the space system are exorbitantly high, we'll produce power at a
competitive rate.  Meeting the costs of existing systems will
dramatically reduce costs - and that will promote expansion - and
investment to cust costs of powersat construction launch and
deployment - and that will reduce costs further - and expand the use
of beamed energy from space.

There are things called pipelines - that can carry water long
distances from places where there IS water, to places where there is
no water.  The same rights of way that allow you to build a rail line
to carry all the shit to the desert to build the stuff, can be used to
carry a pipeline to carry hydrogen away.  That same right of way can
be used to carry water to the site.

Obviously this truism applies to you - since no one said the water
being used to make hydrogen originated in the desert.  And you falsely
assumed that was a requirement.

Actually, the systems I am designing are built on old strip mines near
lignite deposits in semi-arid regions.  Here we reclaim land, and have
a ready supply of lignite.  Lignite we use is 45% water by weight and
50% carbon by weight.  (which is why its still there!)

The water is 11% hydrogen by weight, so that means 5% by weight
hydrogen.  So, for each metric ton of carbon we have locked in the
lignite 100 kg of hydrogen.  Using 10 kg of hydrogen to power a
dewatering and coking operation and combining 90 kg of hydrogen with
1,000 kg of coked lignite produces 7 barrels of gasoline.

So, the only pipe needed is the one to take the gasoline away from the
site. (along the rail line needed to bring the stuff and people to the
site)

As per usual it looks great, except you've excluded the usual ENRON/
Exxon 10X factor, making that 0.03 cents per kWh into at least 0.30
cents per kWh, but lo and behold at least it's clean and renewable, as
well as usable for many other life and Earth saving things.

Have you figured out which significant group of topic/author stocking
naysayers is in charge of your private parts, and why your research
and best of intentions are not getting Usenet or any other group net
supported?

Too bad that I'm not in charge, as your space based laser cannon
energy would have been 50/50 public funded as of a dacade ago, as will
as any terrestrial applications of converting solar energy into wussy
hydrogen or good old robust h2o2.

BTW, even if ISS were 100% converted into a viable platform of hosting
those IR laser cannons, and outfitted along with those multiple km2
solar collectors, it wouldn't become nearly as affordable as you've
suggested, as for the cost and extremely negative environmental impact
of keeping such technology up and running isn't cheap, nor without
human risk.

I have a fix or two for that, which includes utilizing our moon's L1
and a tether dipole element that'll give your laser cannons access to
97.6% solar and loads of other than solar renewable energy to boot
(I'm talking teraWatts of continuous clean energy).

You do realize that our corrupt government that's faith-based
puppeteered and in total denial of their being in denial, will soon
enough require us to pay $1/kwhr, don't you?

If a certain little faith-based group were trying to dominate Earth
for all it's worth, why would they allow public access to clean and
affordable energy, and especially if it were renewable?

Clue No.1) those that are currently rich and powerful don't actually
give a tinkers damn as to how spendy, polluting or lethal our energy
can be made, because where do you think they obtain their loot that's
stuffed into those nifty offshore bank accounts, as is.

Until you realize whom is in charge of your private parts, and
subsequently of how badly snookered you've been, there's no way in any
hell on Earth that anything 'Willie Moo' is ever going to fly.

BTW, do you even realize what number of our homes are 50% or more
heated with wood, corn and even coal, because they simply can't afford
their local energy grid or other alternatives as is?

Of course, thanks to our corrupt government, many have lost their
homes and are living on the streets, or if lucky they live in some god
forsaken dump of a place with minimal or w/o energy.  The American
system has badly failed to take care of its own kind from the bottom
up, and there's simply not the resources available as long as those
Cheney/ENRON/Exxon types and of their fiath-based puppeteers are in
charge.  But then you and others of your pathetic kind don't think
there's any such problems to begin with.

">

Well, I had 3 out of 5 starts before I got back from seeing Doug
Stanhope - haha - and then let loose on your sorry ass!   And I shot
up a star.  So, I don't know if that had anything to do with it or
not.

Fact is, we're all one of 'them' in your mind.  Think about it Brad.
Let your imagination soar!  How many of of US could be THEM?   Now, to
most people this wouldn't make sense.  But to YOU?   It makes perfect
sense.  And I would bet a dollar to a donut (noting that donuts these
days cost more than a dollar! haha) so lets make it a fin to a donut -
that in your darker moments you might well believe EVERYONE is one of
'them' - ooooo...

Which is a measure of your insanity Brad.

Its really very simple.  YOU control your mind.  No one else.  No one
else is reponsible for what you decide to do think believe feel..
Now, you can decide to feel a certain way.  You can decide - to not do
something you usually do.  OR to do something you usually don't do.
Now, when you break out of old habits.  Say if you drink a cup of
coffee every morning, or smoke a cigarette after sex..  you can decide
NOT to do it.  When you make this sort of decision - you can begin to
see how tricky your mind can be to get you to do what IT wants.
haha..  Especially if there are powerful positive associations with
the act, or if it involves an addictive substance, like nicotine or
caffeine.  Its actually a growth experience.

So, that's all I'm suggesting you consider.  You spend a helluva lot
of time online.  You likely do so because of a large number of
positive associations you have with being on line.  Maybe you get
attention from people who would normally not give you attention.
Maybe you can imagine that what you say is vastly more important than
saying the same thing off-line lets you imagine.  Maybe you feel self
concious about your age, the way you dress, or your bad teeth, or bad
breath, or how you look, or how you come across, or how your body
smells - and being online allows you to hide away in some dark little
hole while you spout your blather releasing you from that negative
tension.  And so you don't have that self-concious feeling - which in
your universe might be like the second coming of Christ in terms of
the weight it takes off your slender shoulders.  All these things can
get wrapped up in a big ball of feeling to make being online a sort of
addictive experience.  Like that cup of coffee in the morning, or that
third beer with your buddies at the bar, or breaking that second pack
of cigs open when you're working construction...  well, I'm just
giving you my experiences with addictive stuff...  you have your own
I'm sure.

Well, all I'm suggesting - to raise your level of conciousness just a
little - is to shut your computer down, and not read, or post, or get
online at all - for a period of time.  A year is a good period of
time.  Its not so short as to be like holding your breath - and its
not so long that you can't pick it up again before you die.

If you stay offline for a year - your life WILL change - for the
better.

I gaurantee.

Even if you fail.

Because you will learn something about YOURSELF - which is the only
thing you can change.

And its a way to bring your locus of control INSIDE - to give you a
little pride, a little sense of accomplishment, and a little sense of
achievement.

Once you start down this path its hard to stop.

Make a commitment to yourself, to stay offline for 6 months.  How
about that?

Now to be successful, you've got to do something else to substitute
for it.  When trying to quit smoking - people often put a lollipop in
their mouth, or a toothpick - to substitute - at first- then its
easier to quit doing that.

So, you've got to give this a little thought... if you want to be
successful and not be immediately a failure...

One thing is to figure out something else to do.  Rather than sit on
line and blather... and don't blather in hard-copy notebooks, or on
the telephone, or talking to anyone.  Make a commitment to put away
all that shit for six months to a year - you decide to do it - and
then see what it looks like after.

Its amazing.  I got a new Mercedes convertible one year.  It was a car
I always wanted.  And I worked hard to afford it.  And so, when I got
it, it was the first thing people knew about me. haha..  Bright red
camel interior - anyway - some people started not liking me very
well.  They thought I was being uppity about my car - it turns out. I
was just enthusiastic!  But after a few arguments with people that I
considered friends, I talked to other friends and they said, yeah, I
was being pretty much of an asshole about that damned car!  haha..
So, I made a commitment to myself NEVER to mention that car again
(well, here I am talking about it years after!  see how hard these
things can be?)  - and it WAS difficult - and it was even more
difficult apologizing for something I never did - but which people
perceived me doing.  See?  But I stopped being an asshole about my car
Brad.  And if you make a commitment to not talk about Venus and the
other shit your go on about for a year - you'll stop being an asshole
too!

Here are some things you might want to consider doing for a year or
six months;

1) Go to the library and read a book while at the library - until the
feeling of getting online passes (leave the free terminals alone!)

2) Volunteer at a homeless shelter, or food bank, or a hospice

3) Learn to play a musical instrument - nothing can really help build
your self confidence like playing a musical instrument and learning
something about music.  I was in choir in College and can carry a
tune.  It being the age it was, i also started a garage band with my
buds - and even though we never really booked the kind of gig we
wanted - we were only a cover band - we did go to some hallacious frat
parties - and have some fun - even though we weren't in fraternities -
haha..   I still carry a harmonica sometimes, and when the mood
strikes have been known to break it out and play some muddy waters for
my grandkids!  haha..  Its something that will bring lasting joy to
your life, and to others in your life - and if there are not others in
your life - it will draw them to you.

4) Learn a craft or trade or sport - I skydive.  I love it.  Its
exciting.  Its something I decided to do against my fear of heights.
I conquered that fear - and now I enjoy it.  I also fly VFR light
aircraft an old Cessna 152 - haha - is the only type rating I have.
But both these skills - acquired in six months - give me a new
appreciation of my life and my career.  You can learn to swim if you
don't know how.  You can hire a trainer an learn to lift weights like
Arnold.  You can SCUBA - I went to a resort with a lovely lady who
knew how to SCUBA and she was apalled that I didn't.  So, I took the
'resort' course - in an afternoon they had me certified - and I was
diving with the turtles down Mexico way - and enjoying the Dox Equis
on the beach after ...  it was great!   Ever learn to weave?  I never
thought I would, but I did.  Haha.. I volunteered at a hospice after
my father died there - and ran into a wonderful old lady.  She taught
me!  haha.  We both had a great time, and while I've never made more
than one tea-cozy under her tutelidge- it was a great time learning
from one of the pros of the 20th century!

5) Learn a language.  There are a lot of good CDs out there. Pimsleur
is best in my book.  Then immerse yourself by going to where its
spoken!  Haha.. My youngest daughter is 4 yo.  She lives in
Switzerland.  Her mom is a 30 yo interpreter who works for the Swiss
Parlaiment.  She speaks 5 languages.  Two of the most beautiful women
in my life.  Luckily one of them speaks English.  I visit my daughter
every 6 weeks or so. when I'm in Europe.  But at my age I never
thought I'd be trying to pick up a new language!  haha..  Now, despite
our best efforts, it seems that the my youngest daughter doesn't take
well to English!  haha..  She like every other Swiss citizen - will
speak French, Italian and German..  So, with her mom's help, I'm
learning German and French - we tried Italian but when I couldn't even
hear the difference between que'   and que - haha - we focused on
German and French - despite my love of Italian.  My daughter is
impatient with me - and I cannot say anylonger to her Ich furstein neu
ein bischen deutche, or je ne parle pas francais!  haha..  Its hard to
learn a language when you're older, but in a culture that speaks the
language you can pick it up quick enough.  I spent 6 months on a
project in Taiwan in the 1980s - and I learned a passable amount of
Mandarin - just to get by - even though I had trouble with rising and
falling tones at the end of words .. haha..  which leads me to;

6) Travel - take the money you're not spending online and buy an
airline ticket to somewhere you've always wante to go.  An island in
the Carribean, a cruise of Alaska's glaciers, London, Paris, Madrid,
Tokyo, Sydney, Denver, LA, New York, Chicago!  God, I love Chicago - I
guess its my mid-western upbringing.  Find a

Enron still exists as an assetless shell corporation emerging from

Prior to its 2001 bankruptcy, Enron had 21,000 employees and Fortune
magazine voted it the most innovative company for six consecutive
years, and claimed revenues of $111 billion.  It turned out that these
revenues were arrived at through massive accounting fraud, which
ultimately caused the dissolution of Arthur Anderson, and the arrest
of key individuals and suicide of others.

Exxon replaced Esso in 1973 as a brandname, which was derived from S-O
after the 1911 breakup of Standard Oil. Anti-trust settlement.  In
areas where the Esso brand was blackballed by consumers, the name was
changed to Humble Oil - haha..  These were all absorbed and integrated
by the New Jersy company Exxon.

Exxon no longer exists, it became part of ExxonMobil in 1999 - and is
one of the largest integrate oil companies in the world.  A direct
descendant of John D. Rockerfeller's Standard Oil.  It has $377.6
billion in revenue, and $517.9 billion in market capitalization.
ExxonMobil actually produces 6.5 million barrels of oil per day and
distributes it at thousands of retail locations throughout the world -
employing 82,000 people directly and hundreds of thousands indirectly
to create the fuels it sells.

Well, can you name anyone anywhere that garners support through
usenet?  I can't think of a soul. So, I don't understand your

with little or no expectation of response.  I do value some responses,
and rarely, I get pissed off at especially dumbass responses.

I can imagine you get a little thrill of excitement thinking that you
have such power - but you don't.  So, what's the point?   I don't want
public funding anyway.  So, I wouldn't have accepted it.  Our tax
dollars should go to educating our kids and paying police and fire and
stuff like that, so that companies have halfway intelligent workers
and everyone has a decent job and lives in a safe community.

&gt; as will
&gt; as any terrestrial applications of converting solar energy into wussy
&gt; hydrogen or good old robust h2o2.
">

Your comments about H2O2 make no sense. H2O2 is an explosive.  Its use
in Russian torpedoes caused the famous sinking of the Kursk.  Gasoline
doesn't do this.  Neither does hydrogen.

For stationary applications - pipeline delivery of gaseous hydrogen
under high pressure is adequate and cost-effective.  For mobil
applications using hydrogen to convert coal into gasoline by direct
hydrogenation is the easiest way to go at present, with a strong R&amp;D
into using liquid hydrogen directly as a gasoline replacement.

Check it out - The US burns 1.1 billion tons of coal each year - 880
million tons to make electricity in coal fired power plants.  This 880
million tons of coal can be replaced by 142 million tons of hydrogen
made from 1.28 billion tons of deionized water - via solar/laser
electrolysis.  It takes 50 MWh of solar/laser electricity to make a
ton of hydrogen this way.  So, this is 810 GW of laser energy - beamed
24/7 to Earth.

Now, .0.03 cents per kWh, is $0.30 per MWh, so, 50 MWh is  $15.00 -
that's the cost of each ton of hydrogen.  So, 142 million tons is
$2.13 billion per year.

This eliminates 2.7 billion tons of CO2 each year - and strands 880
million tons of coal.

If the 880 million tons of coal each year is taken in trade for the
hydrogen, and an additional 80 million tons of hydrogen (costing $1.2
billion and requiring 456 GW more satellite capacity) is combined with
that coal, a total of 6.16 billion barrels of gasoline worth $544
billion may be produced each year.

When this total is combined with domestic production, the US now
becomes an exporter of liquid fuels - re-establishing the geopolitical
and economic conditions of the 1950s and the gogo 60s...

If the US would do this along with attempting to power share and share
costs with its allies in a true war against terrorism - the reduction
in costs combined with improved income - would re-establish US
economic leadership in the world.

Since I'm going down this path, haha, I would also humbly suggest that
the US reverse the anti-union campaigns began by Eisenhower.  The US
got rid of its manufacturing business in part due to Eisenhower's
observation that liberal and Democratic support stemmed mostly from
the manufacturing sector.  So, it was no surprise that during the
Eisenhower administration that overseas manufacturing skyrocketed,
which was combined with union busting in the 1950s.  Nixon in his
detente with China completed what Eisenhower started, and by the
1980s, unions and domestic manufacturing was history in the US.

Our inability to manufacture the bulk of what we consume, has made us
very weak in certain areas, while it has solidified certain
conservative norms.  We have routinely ignored this weakness - as for
example - China accumulates US mortgage debt and US dollars.  We are
fools to believe they will not exercise their growing economic
influence in years to come.

I urged a reversal of this policy.  This is rather simple.  A thorough
house cleaning of unions - which JFK/RFK tried to do before he was
shot.  Then, adopting legislation making it easier to unionize.
Finally, placing fair wage requirements for imports.  Forget about
taxing or otherwise limiting trade.  Free trade is king.  But make
sure that people who work to make things, can - as Henry Ford
envisioned - the people who make the stuff are paid a wage that allows
them to buy the stuff.  There is something fundamentally immoral about
a barefoot ignorant 12 yo child spending 12 hours a day making $100
Nike's in a sweatshop for $2 per day so that Phil Knight can increase
his stock value by a few cents!  Now, I'm not saying Phil Knight is a
bad guy, or that he doesn't deserve to be a billionaire.  What I am
saying is that there are third party effects to every decision and it
is the proper role of government to look at these and do what is best
for society.

Now, this gets a little complex, but in the US, we're all the same
community.  So, its clear that if we pay someone starving wages,sure,
if we can get away with it, we'll do it because it makes us a little
richer - that's the way most people think.  But if too many people are
starving, then they'll do something about it!  They'll engage in
crime, or they'll organize a revolution and kill the bastards who are
enslaving them.  So, it pays to be a little clever about this.  It
pays to have a little decency.  Henry Ford created mass-production
techniques as an answer to this problem.  And increased wages enough
so that the people who made the cars, could buy the cars.  This
created the middle class.  And that's what we did in America.  And
there was a big turn to the left, as formerly downtrodden folks, began
to participate more fully in the politics of the 1920s through the
1950s.- and the greatest increase in economic well-being of any nation
in history..

Now J Edgar Hoover and others would have us believe that the Commies
took over the labor movement throughout this time period and THEY were
responsible for liberal ideas that were accepted at that time.  I
question that.  But this was part of the reason in the 1950s the US
government began undermining the unions - first by subverting them
with organized crime (by indirect means)- and then, by promoting
foreign manufacturing.(direct subisdy) - this tied in nicely with the
idea that the US should maintain a huge disparity of income to avoid
being attacked again.  This approach to safety failed on 9/11 -
something we have yet to realize.  It was the poorest nation that
attacked the richest - in part because of the disparity - no matter
how much we demonize radical muslims.

The thing is, the poor little barefoot 12 yo girl in Indonesia
laboring away 12 hours a day to make thousands of pairs of Nike shoes
that are sold at over $100 retail - deserves more than $2 - and if the
US demanded of Nike that they follow wage, hours, and age laws applied
in the US - throughout the world - before the US allowed imports to
enter the US - it would do many things.  First, it would raise
everyone's boat.  Second, since labor costs are second or third or
sometimes even fourth in the list of costs of running a business -
increasing wages will make only a small difference in the total profit
picture - so it won't hurt the companies involved (the service
companies that organize this labor are something else).  Third, the
tendency toward radicalism would be greatly diminished - as the
tendency toward crime and revolution was diminished in the US during
fulfillment of Henry Ford's vision.  Fourth, the folks who made the
shoes, and whatever else, would become buyers of the shoes and
whatever else - and global demand - and the global marketplace - would
increase by a factor of 11x.

Now this leads to the deepest darkest rationale for US policies abroad
- there isn't 11x the stuff to go around.  And by stuff I mean - oil,
black gold, texas tea - and that's an issue.  Except we have a
solution.  Low cost powersats in space beaming energy to Earth.

Things take time.  It takes time to implement a fundamental shift in
policy.  It takes time to build up

Global Terrorism Question(s) of the day:
Our butts are being summarily kicked about by that extremely nasty
'sleeper cell' called mother nature, so what's not perfectly rational
about our fully utilizing or moon and of its L1 for all it's worth?
or for that matter of relocating that entire GW responsible moon out
to Earth's L1 where it'll at least start paying its own way.

Here's a irrefutable fact: our moon is simply not nearly as robust nor
as solid to its salty core, or otherwise nearly as passive to cosmic
and solar energy as you and your NASA/Apollo suck-ups would like to
think.  Somewhat unrelated (meaning off-topic), this is my latest
edited version of what I've recently contributed to another lost soul
of Usenet, that I'm sure you'd just as soon topic/author stock, bash
and/or simply apply as much banishment as you and those of your naysay
swarm can muster.

Even though existing terrestrial surface alternatives of renewable
clean energy exist that are far better off than nuclear energy
(including those of Willie Moo's), here's one somewhat spendy GW
counter terrorism tactic that could actually work on our behalf.

Willie Moo's space based IR laser cannons and terrestrial IR/PV
receiving stations by the dozens: of &quot;Solar powered lasers in space&quot;
and hundreds of those spendy terrestrial receiving stations that are
each +/- 100 meters off-limits to all forms of life as we know it, but
at least we'd have yet another clean resource of energy for producing
h2o2 and processing raw earth into aluminum or whatever else makes you
a happy camper.

Here's my fifth gold star for his topic (*****)
http://groups.google.com/group/sci.space.policy/browse_frm/thread/064...
As per usual it all looks and sounds perfectly nifty, except for his
having excluded the usual ENRON/Exxon 10X markup factor, making that
potential of &quot;03 cents per kWh&quot; into at least a wholesale worth of
$0.30 per kWh (end user at perhaps $0.50/kwhr), but lo and behold at
least it's clean and renewable, as well as directly usable for many
other life and Earth saving things, like burning a nice hole through
our resident warlord's butt and those more than deserving butts of his
possy.

My question to the likes of Willie Moo is;  Have you figured out which
significant group of topic/author stocking and infomercial spewing
naysayers is in charge of your private parts, and subsequently as to
why your research and best of intentions are not getting Usenet or any
other group net supported?

Too bad that I'm not in charge, as your space based laser cannon
energy as well as those nifty terrestrial applications of solar
extracted energy would have been 50/50 public funded as of a dacade
ago, including those subsequent terrestrial applications of converting
solar energy directly into wussy hydrogen or good old robust h2o2.

BTW, even if ISS were donated and 100% converted into a viable
platform of hosting those IR laser cannons, and outfitted along with
those multiple km2 solar collectors, it wouldn't become nearly as
affordable as you've suggested, as for the cost and extremely negative
environmental impact of keeping such substantial technology up and
running isn't cheap, nor without human risk, not to mention each of
those off-limit terrestrial receiving stations and of each laser knife
of no-fly air and/or satellite space in between.

As my having offered before, I have a perfectly viable fix or two for
that, which includes utilizing our moon's L1 and a tether dipole
element that'll give such laser cannons access to 97.6% of direct
solar and loads of other than solar renewable energy to boot (I'm
talking multiple teraWatts of continuous clean energy), and the
combined solar and secondary IR photon cache is in fact rather
impressive.

However, if a certain little faith-based group were trying to dominate
Earth for all it's worth, why would they or their minion friends allow
or much less fund public access on behalf of your clean and affordable
energy, and especially if it were renewable?

You do realize that our corrupt government that's extensively faith-
based puppeteered and in total denial of their being in denial, will
soon enough require us to pay $1/kwhr, don't you?

Clue No.1) those that are currently rich and powerful don't actually
give a tinkers damn as to how spendy, polluting or lethal our energy
can be made, because where do you think they obtain their loot that's
often stuffed into those nifty offshore/(tax avoidance) bank accounts
or international investments, as is.

Until you folks realize whom is in charge of your private parts, and
subsequently of how badly snookered you've been, there's no way in any
hell on Earth that anything of 'Willie Moo' is ever going to fly.

BTW, do you even realize what number of our American homes are 50% or
more heated with the likes of wood, corn and even scavenged coal,
because they simply can't afford their local energy grid or other
alternatives as is?

Of course, thanks to our corrupt and/or incompetent government, many
have lost or are in the process of losing their cozy homes and are
soon enough if not already living on the streets, or if lucky they
live in some god forsaken dump of a place with minimal or w/o energy.
The American system has badly failed to take care of its own kind from
the bottom up (meaning honest education), and there's simply no longer
the resources available for the likes of Willie Moo as long as those
Cheney/ENRON/Exxon types and of their faith-based puppeteers are in
charge of our private parts.  But then you and others of your pathetic
kind don't think there's any such past or current problems to begin
with, and therefore history needn't be revised.

Now that I can 100% relate and agree with your analogy of where we've

our WWIII could become a darn good sign of better times ahead, of the
&quot;rejection of the dead old ways and embracing of life&quot;, or at least on

I do believe Earth would become a whole lot better off if there were
but 10% of the human species to deal with, especially if those
surviving came from within the bottom half rather than from the phony
baloney top of the stack that worships greed, arrogance and their own
cultivated bigotry above any real or imagined God.

So, what we need is perhaps 10% of the global population and at most

Will, I must say that we've been at peril of insuring our own demise
for quite some time, and it's not exactly looking any better down the
road.  The more we base our present day and thereby our future upon
our lies of our faith-based skewed past, the more than likely we'll be
making those same mistakes as well as allowing the same old lethal and/
or collateral damaging actions that'll keep putting us further and
further behind where humanity could have been.

At some near future point, our terrestrial energy resources of fossil
and yellowcake fuel simply is not going to affordably cut it, and the
likes of your terrestrial and space based conversions of solar energy
may simply become of what's too little too late to salvage the
remainders of our environment, that's also going to have to deal with
a failing magnetosphere by way of evolution or via intelligent design
mutating us on behalf of all the above surface life into having rad-
hard DNA, or die trying.

My LSE-CM/ISS based alternative is not all that insurmountable, any
more so than the daunting task of our eventually having to relocate
our moon out to Earth's L1, or else once again die while trying
because, if that big old salty moon sticks so nearby and our sun keeps
getting nastier, and humanity keeps badly burning up everything in
sight, thus unavoidably contributing more CO2 and loads of NOx along
with a few extra hundred teratonnes of h2o sustained within our sooty
atmosphere, as such isn't going to make most of us into happy campers,
especially those of us that can't afford to pay the $10/kwhr or
otherwise afford that of any services, foods or products that required
such spendy energy in the first place.

Earth needs those multiple terawatts worth of clean spare/surplus
energy as of yesterday, not put off for decades or much less another
century from now, as well as otherwise we'll be caught with our pants
down by not having sufficient resources for orchestrating our WWIII,
WWIV and WWV that'll become necessary tools for keeping Earth's
populations of us pathetic humans down to a dull roar.

&gt; &gt; Where there is life there is change.  Birth conquers death and feeds
&gt; &gt; on the remains of the dead.  The first step toward death is separation
&gt; &gt; from what is and embracing what is not.  The second step, loss of
&gt; &gt; vitality of the affected parts.  The third step cessation of growth.
&gt; &gt; Next a falling away of deceased portions.  Finally regrowth.

&gt; &gt; We a culture in decline.  Hstory will show that this decline begam
&gt; &gt; when as a culture, we embraced what was not true - in the 1940s.  Our
&gt; &gt; decline will be traced to our loss of vitality in the 1960s and our
&gt; &gt; lack of growth in the 1980s.  The 2000s opened with the beginnings of
&gt; &gt; our actual destruction.  Finally, in 2020s - there will be rebirth and
&gt; &gt; rejection of the dead old ways and embracing of life.

&gt; Now that I can 100% relate and agree with your analogy of where we've

&gt; &quot;rejection of the dead old ways and embracing of life&quot;, or at least on
&gt; behalf of whatever mutated remainders of human life as we know it.

&gt; I do believe Earth would become a whole lot better off if there were
&gt; but 10% of the human species to deal with, especially if those
&gt; surviving came from within the bottom half rather than from the phony
&gt; baloney top of the stack that worships greed, arrogance and their own
&gt; cultivated bigotry above any real or imagined God.

&gt; So, what we need is perhaps 10% of the global population and at most
&gt; 1% of all those complex religious groups.

">

All species that are constrained to a new range tend to grow in
numbers until that range's carrying capacity is reached.  When that
happens there is a die off since the carrying capacity of the new
range erodes under excessive numbers of the species, and the numbers
collapse to the new lower level.  This new lower level is the degraded
carrying capacity at which the animals set in fierce competition with
one another for resources, survive.

In the human context, humanity is the only species who extended its
range by technical means.  That is, when humans reached the carrying
capacity of whatever range they found themselves in, this created
pressure to innovate to extend and expand this range.  So, the rare
naked low-land ape at Olduvai Gorge by this means over a two million
year period became the super-successful highly technical species
spanning the globe you see today.

We have reached the ends of the Earth, and are poised to reach beyond
the Earth to encompass the solar system using nuclear power and high
technology, much as in earlier times, we reached beyond the African
low-lands with clothing shelter and fire.

But right at the moment of our greatest success we tarried.  We failed
to innovate and lied to ourselves about our capacity to do what should
havve come naturally to us humans.  Just long enough to bring about
our collapse and the emergence of a post-human species.

The characteristic feature of humanity is its cooperative nature.
There is an irriitable competitive nature to be sure in humans.  But
there is a cooperative aspect as well.  And that cooperative aspect
overlays the competitive aspect.  This is reflected in the structure
of the human brain.  The triumvirate brain its called.  The reptilian
brain,so called which is competitive, the mammalian brain, so called,
which is inquisitive and cooperative - but this is actually unique to
humans - due to their ability (formerly) to expand their range on
demand - and finally the so called human layer - which is actually our
ability with numbers and symbols which gave rise to technology and
modern civilization.

What has happened in the modern age, is that our ability with symbols
and to organize ourselves in response to the logic of symbols - has
given rise to powerful social forms that have judged the normal human
development path toward life - to be too risky or impossible.  The
natural human response - that has served humanity for millions of
years - has been circumvented.  Lack of action has been rationalized.
And the die-off that humans forestalled for millions of years by
adhering to their natural instincts of wonder, courage, hope, and  a
healthy natural regard for one another - has become a nearly
guaranteed outcome - due to a handful of self-appointed experts in the
guise of national security.

The problem with the US approach to maintaining US hegemony throughout
the die-off, is that the carrying capacity of Earth undergoes a
massive shift downward if we are to allow this die-off to occur.  And
the survivors remaining after the die off - will compete with one
another to survive in the wasteland left behind - for all eternity.

The conditions will have changed.  The range will be forever
constrained.  And the conditions under which industry was created on
Earth, will never be repeated.  We will become a post-human and post-
technical species that will be quite different than the people we take
for granted today.

The light of human-kindness will have been extinguished from the
world.

And we will no longer BE human.

So, this fantasy that the controlling elite tell themselves in secret
about a post-apocolyptic America surviving in idyllic peace is nothing
more than mental masturbation.  America will be the first industrial
center to be decimated in the coming conflicts (as 9/11 proves) as it
becomes clear this is no hope, there is no savior, and there is no fix
forthcoming - and human hope, and human courage, and human faith - is
decimated under the weight of survival - as we enter the new age. -
with the old age, once dead, never to arise again.

The only time we had to live, was when we were alive.  And we chose
death.  We chose death for the must ludicrous of reasons - we were
afraid of death.  And so, we drew it to us by our fear.

Of course, being one of the last humans around, I hope and work for,
life - for the possibility that we can even at this late stage, set
things right, and undo,through great foolishness and hubris, what we
have unleashed on the world, and ourselves.

Using our intelligence community to reduce conflict rather than manage
conflict to our advantage.

Using our intelligence and military might in the service of liberty
and freedom throughout the world..

Using our intelligence community to end organized international crime,
including the drug trade - rather than exploiting relations with
organized crime to pay for intelligence operatoins, gain control, and
provide muscle.

Establish wage, hours of work, and worker age laws among manufacturers
that are allowed to import to the US.

Modify international banking practices (especially transfer pricing)
to enrich nations rather than impoverish them.

Use monetary policy to promote growth worldwide rather than disparity
of income worldwide.

Establish ...

well  I could go on - but what does it matter?  Its mookie talking to
guthball.

We have the technical means to do whatever we want in the solar
system.
We have the technical means to end these energy shortages - sure it
will disrupt the oil providers, just as the development of oil
disrupted the coal providers, and the development of coal disrupted
the wood providers - so what?  It will be the best course for humanity
- no matter what self-serving lies we tell ourselves today.

With the ability to make productive use of off-world resources, and
access to adequate power and raw materials at reasonable prices,
humanity will continue to grow wealthier - but will not continue to
grow in numbers.

At the extreme edges of wealth, the wealthiest societies have
undergone a reversal of population growth.  That's why all the
wealthiest nations import foreign labor.  Europe, the US, Japan, Saudi
Arabia - all import labor from less developed regions.

So, if we were to allow the expansion of industry to occur - making
use of off-world resources and energy - standards of living would
rise, and population growth rates would reverse.

The big problem facing THIS 21st century population is where to get
laborers when the whole world has reached the late-sensate phase of
development?

The answer is - robots.  This phase would have occurred, and quite
possibly still could occur - around 2030 to 2040 time frame.

Human numbers grow at about 3/4% per year - 1.0075 - and human
industry grows when under no constraints, about 10% per year 1.1000 -
so industrial growth dominates - if there are no constraints - like
energy shortages.

Humani numbers are at present around 6.8 billion.   Human income is
$65 trillion.  That's a little over $9,500 per year.  Population
growth rate is positive.

In the US, numbers are 300 million and income $13 trillion.   That's a
little over $43,000.  Without immigration, population growth rate is
negative.

So, the ratio of 43,000 / 9,500 = .4.52

The world economy growing by this factor in a short period of time
would reverse the growth in human numbers;

Therefore,   LN(4.52) / LN(1.1) = 15.84

In about 16 years - if our economy grew at 10% per year. - 2023

China knows this.  India knows this.  That's why they have it as their
goal to grow very fast.  And by and large despite huge difficulties -
they have achieved these growth targets.   And this is when these
nations will reach ZPG and begin importing labor from surrounding
regions to maintain their standard of living.

Outside these areas, growth is less.  The global average is around 4%
- 1.040 so lets plug that in...

LN(4.52) / LN(1.040) = 38.46

around 39 years - or 2046

With Asia, North America and Europe in population decline - we can

&gt; &gt; Is it to get power 24/7? Well you have to be above LEO to effectively
&gt; &gt; extend the desert day.

&gt; You add the satellite to lower costs...  that's the point.  You lower
&gt; costs by increasing the capital utilization of the equipment.

&gt; BACKGROUND - SOLAR PANELS

&gt; PHYSICS
&gt; The sun is a thermal source emitting all colors.  Silicon has a
&gt; specific bandgap energy at 1,108 nm which absorbs all wavelengths
&gt; shorter than that bandgap color, and converts each color with an
&gt; efficiency of  the ratio of the wavelength absorbed relative to the
&gt; bandgap wavelength.  So, 1,100 nm is almost perfectly absorbed.  550
&gt; nm is converted to electrical action at 50% efficiency  275 nm is
&gt; converted to electrical action at 25% efficiency - because the bandgap
&gt; energy is fixed.   ALL the energy of wavelengths longer than 1108 nm
&gt; is lost - its converted with 0% efficiency.  Summing across all the
&gt; wavelengths in a real system - you get about 180 watts electrical for
&gt; each 1000 watts solar put in.
">

Could I say at once as a general preamble that I feel we should keep
an open mind on all possible systems. In talkinf avout 1108nm you are
assuming two things - Photovoltaics &amp; Silicon for photovoltaics. If
that is true then you are correct. There are however alternatives.

1) Biological - Here yellow is the wavelength for photosynthesis, just
over 500nm.
2) Raise steam &amp; drive a turbine- Here wavelength is unimportant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; UTILIZATION
&gt; Now in a desert region we have in North America the equivalanet of
&gt; 1,600 hours of sunlight per year.  That's because of seasonal
&gt; variation and cosine effects.  The sun at dawn and dusk illuminates
&gt; the terrain at an angle.  Its only at noon at certain times of the
&gt; year that you get peak power.  All other times light comes in at an
&gt; angle and is lower intensity.  So, you have an effective peak power
&gt; output of 1,600 hours.
">

This is true. You are now thalking about GEO. Some earlier postings
mentioned LEO. At GEO utilisation is indeed 24/7 (almost) there is an
eclipse season. At the equinoxes this is about 1hr 10min per night
around midnight. Away from equinoxes you have 24/7.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; OUTPUT AND COSTS
&gt; Energy is measured in kWh.  So, each kW of panel from sunlight
&gt; produces in this scenario 1,600 kWh.

&gt; The cost of this system is lets say $1,000 per peak kilo-watt - and it
&gt; has a lifetime of 20 years.  That means you're paying $50.00 a year
&gt; for the equipment.  If you borrowed the money and paid it back over 20
&gt; years, you'd pay more like $100.00 a year for the equipment.  Lets say
&gt; there are no other costs to keep it simple - since these are the main
&gt; costs.  Then you're paying $100 for 1,600 kWh - that's 6.25 cents per
&gt; kWh.

&gt; BACKGROUND LASER POWER SAT

&gt; LASER POWER PHYSICS

&gt; Lets ADD a powersat that beam laser energy at 1,000 nm (1 um) onto
&gt; this same panel array.  The laser energy is converted by the silicon
&gt; with nearly perfect efficiency.  1,0000 nm / 1,108 nm = 90.25% -
&gt; scattering in the air subtracts another 5% -   So, for each 1,000
&gt; watts of laser you get 850 watts electrical.

&gt; INTENSITY
&gt; If we decide to emit the same 1,000 watts per square meter the sun
&gt; produces, using a solar pumped laser in space, then we obtain 850
&gt; watts electrical per square meter on the ground.  This adds to the 180
&gt; watts electrical each square meter produces from sunlight.

&gt; COST OF PEAK WATT ON THE GROUND
&gt; This is the first advantage of a power sat.  We said it cost $1 per
&gt; peak watt for the solar panel installation in our example above.  This
&gt; is $180 per square meter of panels.  Reusing the same installation for
&gt; a solar power receiver at the intensity described above means that
&gt; $180 per square meter is spread across 850 watts electrical output
&gt; from the satellite.  So, the ground station costs are reduced from $1
&gt; per peak watt to ,

&gt;   $180/850 = $0.212

&gt; 21.2 cents per peak watt - for the ground statoin side - or $212 per
&gt; peak kW.

&gt; UTILIZATION

&gt; The solar pumped laser is at GEO - hovering stationary above the panel
&gt; array.  The laser satellite illuminates the panels nearly all the time
&gt; and totals.nearly 8,766 hours per year - except for a few minutes when
&gt; Earth's shadow eclipses the satellite.

&gt; .
&gt; OUTPUT AND COSTS
&gt; Like the solar panels, the energy is kWh, so each kW of panels and
&gt; satellite  produces a total of 8,766 hours of satellite power per
&gt; year.

&gt; Lets say that each kilowatt of solar laser power on orbit costs
&gt; $6,000.  A satellite is mostly thin film highly reflective plastic
&gt; focusing sunlight onto a special device called a fabrey-perot cell -
&gt; filled with materials that lase at 1,000 nm.  This laser beam passes
&gt; through a window of special adaptive optical window that adjusts the
&gt; beam in response to a controlling pilot beam from the panel array on
&gt; the ground so that the power safely and reliably falls on the panels
&gt; and nowhere else.
">

This is quite interesting. I feel that this concept should be extended
further. A set of lasers such as you describe can be made much more
capable with a few changes. These changes are quite compliocated and
perhaps a little bit difficule to understand but they would not add
greatly to the cost. What you weant on your window is a piezoelectric
system capable of putting a delay of half a wavelength in or out.

If you take a pattern at infinity (in fact the Earth will still be in
the Fresnel region - not quite infinity) and take a Fourier Transform
you get the pattern that has to transmitted. One thing - The radiation
intensity is real (we are not worried about the phase (angle in Argand
diagram). Our laser outlets are only capable of varying phase angle
not intensity. However by giving freedom to phase we can achieve a
general pattern by varying phases alone. This means.

1) The system is capable of being focussed either into a very small
region or into a more diffuse region.

2) The system will focus on a number of spots simultanously some
diffuse some points.

Thought - Could an asteroid be moved by concentrating laser light onto
it?

http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sci.space.policy/browse_frm/thread/4...

Lasers were not mentioned in the NASA report, perhaps they should have
been. I think too it was a great pity that Rand Simberg saw fit to
hijack the discussion.

Personally I am not sure I like the idea of nuclear bombs, where there
is an alternative.

Actually the concepts of LISA, the concept of a large space
(fragmented) telescope and the concept of laser arrays are very much
bound up. With active phase control you can always reach the
diffraction limit and you can work out with 1.22lambda/d just what
that is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Launch costs are approximately $10,000 per kg and construction costs
&gt; in the aerospace business are around $2,500 per kg.  The costs of raw
&gt; materials are nil compared to these costs. The bulk of the weight of
&gt; the satellite is the thin film material - and so knowing the thickness
&gt; of this the efficiency of converting sunlight to laser light - we can
&gt; compute the area of the film and its weight - and add a correction to
&gt; estimate what the laser and controls would weigh - and multiply by the
&gt; figures above to get a preliminary estimate of satellite costs - and
&gt; see that $5 per watt is accurate.

Launch costs is again an interesting one. If you have an energy system
it will (I presume) go from LEO to GEO using ion drive.

&gt; &gt; each 1000 watts solar put in.

&gt; Could I say at once as a general preamble that I feel we should keep
&gt; an open mind on all possible systems. In talkinf avout 1108nm you are
&gt; assuming two things - Photovoltaics &amp; Silicon for photovoltaics. If
&gt; that is true then you are correct. There are however alternatives.

&gt; 1) Biological - Here yellow is the wavelength for photosynthesis, just
&gt; over 500nm.
&gt; 2) Raise steam &amp; drive a turbine- Here wavelength is unimportant.

&gt; &gt; UTILIZATION
&gt; &gt; Now in a desert region we have in North America the equivalanet of
&gt; &gt; 1,600 hours of sunlight per year.  That's because of seasonal
&gt; &gt; variation and cosine effects.  The sun at dawn and dusk illuminates
&gt; &gt; the terrain at an angle.  Its only at noon at certain times of the
&gt; &gt; year that you get peak power.  All other times light comes in at an
&gt; &gt; angle and is lower intensity.  So, you have an effective peak power
&gt; &gt; output of 1,600 hours.

&gt; This is true. You are now thalking about GEO. Some earlier postings
&gt; mentioned LEO. At GEO utilisation is indeed 24/7 (almost) there is an
&gt; eclipse season. At the equinoxes this is about 1hr 10min per night
&gt; around midnight. Away from equinoxes you have 24/7.

&gt; &gt; OUTPUT AND COSTS
&gt; &gt; Energy is measured in kWh.  So, each kW of panel from sunlight
&gt; &gt; produces in this scenario 1,600 kWh.

&gt; &gt; The cost of this system is lets say $1,000 per peak kilo-watt - and it
&gt; &gt; has a lifetime of 20 years.  That means you're paying $50.00 a year
&gt; &gt; for the equipment.  If you borrowed the money and paid it back over 20
&gt; &gt; years, you'd pay more like $100.00 a year for the equipment.  Lets say
&gt; &gt; there are no other costs to keep it simple - since these are the main
&gt; &gt; costs.  Then you're paying $100 for 1,600 kWh - that's 6.25 cents per
&gt; &gt; kWh.

&gt; &gt; BACKGROUND LASER POWER SAT

&gt; &gt; LASER POWER PHYSICS

&gt; &gt; Lets ADD a powersat that beam laser energy at 1,000 nm (1 um) onto
&gt; &gt; this same panel array.  The laser energy is converted by the silicon
&gt; &gt; with nearly perfect efficiency.  1,0000 nm / 1,108 nm = 90.25% -
&gt; &gt; scattering in the air subtracts another 5% -   So, for each 1,000
&gt; &gt; watts of laser you get 850 watts electrical.

&gt; &gt; INTENSITY
&gt; &gt; If we decide to emit the same 1,000 watts per square meter the sun
&gt; &gt; produces, using a solar pumped laser in space, then we obtain 850
&gt; &gt; watts electrical per square meter on the ground.  This adds to the 180
&gt; &gt; watts electrical each square meter produces from sunlight.

&gt; &gt; COST OF PEAK WATT ON THE GROUND
&gt; &gt; This is the first advantage of a power sat.  We said it cost $1 per
&gt; &gt; peak watt for the solar panel installation in our example above.  This
&gt; &gt; is $180 per square meter of panels.  Reusing the same installation for
&gt; &gt; a solar power receiver at the intensity described above means that
&gt; &gt; $180 per square meter is spread across 850 watts electrical output
&gt; &gt; from the satellite.  So, the ground station costs are reduced from $1
&gt; &gt; per peak watt to ,

&gt; &gt;   $180/850 = $0.212

&gt; &gt; 21.2 cents per peak watt - for the ground statoin side - or $212 per
&gt; &gt; peak kW.

&gt; &gt; UTILIZATION

&gt; &gt; The solar pumped laser is at GEO - hovering stationary above the panel
&gt; &gt; array.  The laser satellite illuminates the panels nearly all the time
&gt; &gt; and totals.nearly 8,766 hours per year - except for a few minutes when
&gt; &gt; Earth's shadow eclipses the satellite.

&gt; &gt; .
&gt; &gt; OUTPUT AND COSTS
&gt; &gt; Like the solar panels, the energy is kWh, so each kW of panels and
&gt; &gt; satellite  produces a total of 8,766 hours of satellite power per
&gt; &gt; year.

&gt; &gt; Lets say that each kilowatt of solar laser power on orbit costs
&gt; &gt; $6,000.  A satellite is mostly thin film highly reflective plastic
&gt; &gt; focusing sunlight onto a special device called a fabrey-perot cell -
&gt; &gt; filled with materials that lase at 1,000 nm.  This laser beam passes
&gt; &gt; through a window of special adaptive optical window that adjusts the
&gt; &gt; beam in response to a controlling pilot beam from the panel array on
&gt; &gt; the ground so that the power safely and reliably falls on the panels
&gt; &gt; and nowhere else.

&gt; This is quite interesting. I feel that this concept should be extended
&gt; further. A set of lasers such as you describe can be made much more
&gt; capable with a few changes. These changes are quite compliocated and
&gt; perhaps a little bit difficule to understand but they would not add
&gt; greatly to the cost. What you weant on your window is a piezoelectric
&gt; system capable of putting a delay of half a wavelength in or out.

&gt; If you take a pattern at infinity (in fact the Earth will still be in
&gt; the Fresnel region - not quite infinity) and take a Fourier Transform
&gt; you get the pattern that has to transmitted. One thing - The radiation
&gt; intensity is real (we are not worried about the phase (angle in Argand
&gt; diagram). Our laser outlets are only capable of varying phase angle
&gt; not intensity. However by giving freedom to phase we can achieve a
&gt; general pattern by varying phases alone. This means.

&gt; 1) The system is capable of being focussed either into a very small
&gt; region or into a more diffuse region.

&gt; 2) The system will focus on a number of spots simultanously some
&gt; diffuse some points.

&gt; Thought - Could an asteroid be moved by concentrating laser light onto
&gt; it?

&gt; http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sci.space.policy/browse_frm/thread/4 ...

&gt; Lasers were not mentioned in the NASA report, perhaps they should have
&gt; been. I think too it was a great pity that Rand Simberg saw fit to
&gt; hijack the discussion.

&gt; Personally I am not sure I like the idea of nuclear bombs, where there
&gt; is an alternative.

&gt; Actually the concepts of LISA, the concept of a large space
&gt; (fragmented) telescope and the concept of laser arrays are very much
&gt; bound up. With active phase control you can always reach the
&gt; diffraction limit and you can work out with 1.22lambda/d just what
&gt; that is.

&gt; &gt; Launch costs are approximately $10,000 per kg and construction costs
&gt; &gt; in the aerospace business are around $2,500 per kg.  The costs of raw
&gt; &gt; materials are nil compared to these costs. The bulk of the weight of
&gt; &gt; the satellite is the thin film material - and so knowing the thickness
&gt; &gt; of this the efficiency of converting sunlight to laser light - we can
&gt; &gt; compute the area of the film and its weight - and add a correction to
&gt; &gt; estimate what the laser and controls would weigh - and multiply by the
&gt; &gt; figures above to get a preliminary estimate of satellite costs - and
&gt; &gt; see that $5 per watt is accurate.

&gt; Launch costs is again an interesting one. If you have an energy system
&gt; it will (I presume) go from LEO to GEO using ion drive.

If all goes well, within the first decade of the full operation of
those Willie Moo laser cannons will start to pay their own way in
clean energy for their R&amp;D and deployment, and if still working after
that first spendy decade is when Earth will start to obtain whatever's
the energy that's no longer going into sustaining his space based
platform of lasers and otherwise of those multiple receiving stations.

The all-inclusive energy that such R&amp;D, deployment and servicing is
going to demand is rather significant, and that's only if nothing goes
all that terribly wrong or wares out.  Whereas the LSE-CM/ISS tether
dipole element deployed platform of multiple laser cannons, that'll if
need be reach to within 2r of mother Earth is also doable, and being
far more capable of delivering clean energy to his battery of laser
cannons that'll offer much greater combined energy density.  If I were
in charge, I would gladly provide this tether extended platform and
the spare teraWatts of energy.

His terrestrial based solar energy conversions (mostly applied
directly into creating LH2) are actually a whole lot more doable as
is, at not 1% the R&amp;D or much less of any spendy fly-by-rocket and
subsequent pollution factors.  However, for some silly reason the
notions of using solar or any renewable energy in order to produce
those nifty energy products of h2o2 and aluminum is Willie Moo taboo.
Go figure (I guess in Willie's world we'll have to keep forever using
nukes, as well as burning off coal, oil
