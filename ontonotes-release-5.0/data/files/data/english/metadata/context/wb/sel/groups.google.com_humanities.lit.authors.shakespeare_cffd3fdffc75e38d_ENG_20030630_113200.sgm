Below is a copy of the Manchester Guardian's revealing essay, part
interview with Michael Wood a few days before the airing of the first segment
of his In Search of Shakespeare documentary on BBC on June 28. I highlight a
few passages which I consider revealing. There is a lot of food for thought
here, especially the open admission that seeing Shakespeare as a &quot;sly Catholic
dissident&quot; may not go down well in many quarters in Britain. I am amazed with
this claim that 35,000 were executed during Elizabeth's reign. That would
average out to more than two executions every day...day in and day...out for 45
years. It seems far too high but perhaps some historian can illuminate from
documentation. Certainly, many were Catholics...those who...unlike the Strat
man...failed to escape the clutches of what Wood regards as the Elizabethan
Police State.
It is too bad that the Queen behead the secret Catholic Strat man which would
have eliminated the Shakespeare authorship problem. Ha Ha.

Meet Mr. Shakespeare

Do we need to know who the bard really was to understand his work? Lyn Gardner
talks to Michael Wood about his new BBC series

Monday June 23, 2003
The Guardian

Michael Wood: 'We have this image of Shakespeare as a ruddy man quaffing ale. I
wanted to show that it's much more complicated'

In the recent Great Britons series, the legendary theatre director Peter Brook
suggested that the biography of Shakespeare didn't matter one jot, it is only
the plays that count. The film-maker and life-long Shakespeare fan Michael Wood
thinks that is rubbish. Well, he would wouldn't he, because he has just
completed a four-part BBC2 series called In Search of Shakespeare, which
attempts to put flesh on the bare bones of Shakespeare's life and show that the
world's greatest playwright was very much a product of his time - a society in
a state of revolution split between an old-world Catholic sensibility and the
Protestant new order, the medieval and the modern. The contemporary poet and
playwright Ben Jonson declared that Shakespeare was &quot;not of an age, but for all
time&quot;. Wood sets out to prove that although Johnson was right in the second, he
was wrong in the first: Shakespeare - and the plays that he wrote - were in
fact very much a product of the turbulent era in which he lived. Amazingly,
while Shakespeare's plays have been regularly shown on television and there
have been dramas and documentaries speculating on their authorship, there has
never been a full-blown television biography of the national icon. Perhaps it
is not so surprising, because so little is actually known about his life,
particularly the early years. When Wood first posited the idea, one TV
executive sniffed that it would be rather dull as you would only be able to
film in Stratford-upon-Avon and at the Globe, while an eminent history scholar
pointed out that it was going to have to be a very short series given the
paucity of solid facts known about Shakespeare's life. That certainly hasn't
stopped Wood, whose series Conquistadors and In the Footsteps of Alexander the
Great have not only been classy popular TV that never let a lack of facts get
in the way of the spectacular scenery, but have also been acclaimed by scholars
for their historical accuracy. Even so, Wood admits that the first episode of
In Search of Shakespeare in particular, which takes Shakespeare up to the age
of 19 and his marriage to Anne Hathaway, presented &quot;a huge technical challenge
because we only have three facts about his early life&quot;. So Wood turned
detective and the result is a history series with a touch of Inspector Morse, a
racy, pacy investigation which uses primary sources often ignored by
Shakespearean scholars to uncover information about a shadowy figure and the
world he lived in, and to tell a story of family disgrace, personal tragedy and
retrieval of reputation. There will be some who say there is too much
speculation and not enough fact, and sometimes it does indeed seem like chasing
shadows, but Wood suggests that perhaps Shakespeare had good reasons for being
so guarded and private, in an era when spies were everywhere and any dissent
from the ascendant Protestantism was ruthlessly wiped out. During the reign of
Elizabeth I, more than 35,000 people were sent to the scaffold. Shakespeare and
his family were not untouched. The style of In Search of Shakespeare may be
lush and romantic, more Shakespeare in Love than The World at War, but what
makes it radical is the way it rescues Shakespeare from the heritage industry.
&quot;Of course it's lush,&quot; says Wood. &quot;It is a series about England. Shakespeare is
about Englishness and the national narrative, but in this case the narrative is
not quite what we think it is. The cunning when making this kind of series is
to make people feel warm and good and then take them somewhere unexpected, into
a world that's different from the one they thought they were in.&quot;&quot;We have this
image engraved on the national consciousness of William Shakespeare as a ruddy
man quaffing his ale above a half-timbered cream-tea shop in the Midlands in
the reign of Good Queen Bess. I wanted to show that it was much more
complicated than that.&quot; Much, much more complicated: there will almost
certainly be plenty of people unwilling to incorporate into the national
narrative the idea of Shakespeare as a quietly sly Catholic dissident, whose
plays reflected a loyalty to the traditions of his parents and grandparents at
a time of cultural revolution, when a great mass of the population were being
forced to wipe their memories. If In Search of Shakespeare approaches history
sideways on, offering a history of an era told as a portrait of the artist as a
leading representative of his time, it is also unusual for the TV history genre
in that it completely eschews the historical re-enactments that have become the
staple of such series. Instead of actors dressed in big ruffs, Wood offers us
real-life, modern-day commentators who offer a direct conduit between our own
age and Shakespeare's. When a glover talks about his trade, the same one
carried out by Shakespeare's own father, and when Stratford-upon-Avon's town
councillors point out the similarities in the governance of the town to
Shakespeare's day, it is as if the years have melted away. At its very best, In
Search of Shakespeare makes you feel that you can reach through your TV screen
and touch history. Of course, in many ways Peter Brook is right, it is
Shakespeare's plays that are important, not the life story of the man himself,
and there is something a little curious about a series about a playwright that
for the first two episodes makes very little mention of the plays themselves.
Wood entirely accepts that we can watch Twelfth Night without having any need
to know about the contemporary allusions or why Shakespeare wrote the plays,
but argues that it can be a richer experience if we do. &quot;It makes Shakespeare
more understandable,&quot; he says. &quot;If we know that he came from a Catholic family,
we can understand why he rewrote anti-Catholic plays such as King John, and how
Lear could be understood by its contemporary audience as a spiritual commentary
and Pericles as a spiritual allegory.&quot; Wood also dismisses the argument that In
Search of Shakespeare represents the respectable face of our celebrity-obsessed
culture, which makes us more interested in the writer's life than the plays he
wrote. &quot;I don't think there is anything wrong in trying to locate the writer in
his own time. Omnibus and Arena used to do that kind of thing a lot. Of course,
there is a pressure when making a series like this not to talk about the
influence of Puritanism on Measure For Measure, but about the dark Lady of the
Sonnets. The truth is that the average punter probably just wants to know
whether Shakespeare loved his wife and whether he was gay or straight.&quot; And he
concludes: &quot;To a certain extent, you have to go with that. I am the first
person to accept that TV history is primarily entertainment. But that doesn't
mean that you can't dig deeper too, surprise yourself and the viewer.&quot; Â· In
Search of Shakespeare begins on Saturday June 28, 9.10pm, BBC2

I don't remember this figure from the TV programme, and can't find it in the
book, at least by a quick search. It is certainly wrong for Roman Catholics:
far fewer were killed in Elizabeth's reign (1558-1603) than Protestants were
in Mary's (1553-58) - and that was not quite 400, even if we add those who
died in prison. The Catholic Encyclopedia web site says

&quot;The total number of Catholics who suffered under her [sc. Elizabeth I] was
189, 128 of them being priests, 58 laymen, and three women. To them should
be added ... 32 Franciscans who were starved to death.

&quot;Notwithstanding the severities of Elizabeth, the number of Catholic clergy
on the English missions in her time was considerable. It has been estimated
that at the end of the sixteenth century they amounted to 366, 50 being
survivors of the old Marian priests, 300 priests from Douai and the other
foreign seminaries, and 16 priests of the Society of Jesus.&quot;

Perhaps 35,000 includes those executed for *all* crimes during the 45 years,
which would give us about 780 a year over the whole kingdom. Considering the
range of crimes for which the penalty was death, that would be a large but
not incredible total.

I have found a figure for executed Catholics after 1581 at somewhat over
200 but less than 300. Even if one added those executed prior to 1581 when the
regime was less harsh, the figure would probably not reached 400. 35,000
executions for all offenses over a 45 year period? Well that is a most
interesting question. I believe that some debtors were actually executed. The
Tudor regime was vicious in its treatment of families from which a person had
committed suicide...with the corpse being hacked to bits...almost like a
retroactive or ex post facto execution. The emphatic treatment of the issue of
suicide is one of the things that pushes the Bard beyond the parameters of
Christian Doctrine generally and categorically wipes out the secret Catholic
Strat man as the real Bard. I will double-check to confirm if Wood avoids or
sidesteps the suicide issue which I believe he does. He almost has to avoid
it.

Dante. Cato.

And, on the other hand, Christian suicides are uncommon in Shakespeare.
Romeo and Juliet are constrained to it by the plot. Othello is the
only other I can think of.

And suicide is as just as great a sin to Protestants.

As Hamlet recalls: The Everlasting has &quot;fix'd His canon 'gainst
self-slaughter&quot;. Suicide was in Sh's day still a crime, and the offender's
body regarded as unfit for Christian burial: &quot;Such as kill themselves are
buried in the field [unconsecrated ground] with a stake driven through their
bodies&quot; (Harrison's 'Description of England' 1557/8]. Ophelia's death is
&quot;doubtful&quot; (suicide or accident?), and &quot;but that great command o'ersway[ed]
the order&quot; she should therefore, at best, have been buried in an
unconsecrated part of the graveyard. Even with Claudius' intervention to
permit her burial in consecrated ground, she is granted only &quot;maim'd rites&quot;.

This is a non-starter as a discriminator between Catholic and Protestant.

The suicide issue is not a non-starter for determining whether the Bard was a
Christian dramatist and/or secret Catholic as some have tried to argue...a line
of argument which Roland Frye refuted in his landmark work, Shakespeare and
Christian Doctrine (1963) by exploring the suicide issue in the dramas.

As I recall, suicide wasn't decriminalized in England until about the middle of
the 20th century. Until then, a failed suicide could be (and sometimes was) put
on trial.
