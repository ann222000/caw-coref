Further to previous shameless advertising (what other type is there? :) ...

Looks like a nice set! Finally glad to see some new Columbia releases and
with lovely extras too.

If you mean the 1955 version, it's already out. If you mean the 1942,
it will hopefully be part of a screwball comedy collection next year.
If you mean the TV series, I'm tryin' really hard.

Mike - You've got to pair MY SISTER EILEEN with A NIGHT TO REMEMBER.
Even the pressbook for NIGHT heralds the fact that it takes place in
the &quot;Eileen&quot; apartment.  Two great Columbia classics.

I knew one of them was married to Nathanael West but I had no idea
they sank the Titanic, too!

Yes, I was talking about the Rosalind Russell version (but mentioning that
would have ruined my awful joke, and I can't resist an awful joke). Thanks
very much for the information.

The screwball set is greatly welcome. In fact, given the fame of the
Screwball genre, I wonder why another classic-library company hasn't put out
one out. I guess Warner's 'CLASSIC COMEDIES' set comes closest, but it does
have DINNER AT EIGHT ... which although it doesn't have any fast-talking
newspaper men or dither-headed millionaire's daughters, features that other
famed screwball standby - the washed-up actor's suicide! This, Oscar Jaffe,
is the final irony.

John.

(and William Ferry gets the cigar - a 2-for-a-nickel Perfecto Royale. They
were good enough for George Burns.)

It'd be great, but we don't own it; I believe CBS does.
