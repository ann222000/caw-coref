POLICE have appealed for witnesses to a car crash which left a
nine-year-old and her grandmother in hospital with serious injuries.
Natasha Jacobs from Manchester was with Sandra Chester, 64, when their
Peugeot 207 collided with another car on Bury Old Road, Prestwich, two
weeks ago.
It is believed that the driver of a Hyundai Coupe, travelling along the
same road, lost control on a bend and smashed into the pair. The
Hyundai then crashed into another parked car.
Both Natasha and Mrs Chester were taken to hospital and the road was
closed by police for around two hours.
Natasha, a pupil at Bury and Whitefield Jewish Primary School, was
taken to Pendlebury Children’s Hospital. After a few days in the
hospital’s high dependency unit, she has now been transferred to a
general ward.
A hospital spokesman said this week: “Natasha is stable and doing OK.”
This week, Mrs Chester was still in the intensive care unit at North
Manchester General Hospital.
Her condition was said to have deteriorated over the past few days and
she was reported at the time of going to press as being in a serious
condition, suffering from life-threatening injuries.
The 19-year-old male driver of the Hyundai broke his leg in the
accident. He and his three passengers, who suffered minor injuries,
were all taken to North Manchester General Hospital.
