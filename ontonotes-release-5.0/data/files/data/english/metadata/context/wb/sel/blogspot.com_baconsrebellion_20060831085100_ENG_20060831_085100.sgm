As a follow-up to our recent articles about Prince William County
transporation and land use planning...

Prince William County, much to its credit, surveys its citizens every
year to gauge their satisfaction with county amenities and services
ranging from public safety to help for the elderly, waste management to
voter registration. The 2006 telephone survey of 1,439 randomly selected
individuals is overseen by a third party, Dr. Thomas M. Guterbock, a
University of Virginia sociology professor. ( View the report .)

The overall picture is very positive. States the 2006 report: "Prince
William County residents are on the whole very satisfied with their
County government and quality of life." On most items, changes since the
baseline survey of 1993 have been positive. Among the critical
indicators, satisfaction with the county's "value for tax dollars" is up
11 percentage points since 1993.

(As an interesting aside, blacks and Hispanics consistently gave
higher rankings to the County's quality of life than did whites. Income
was not a significant variable in influencing opinions.)

However, there are two major exceptions to the happy picture: land
use and transportation. States the report: "Satisfaction with how the
County is doing in planning how land will be used and developed ... is
down 9 points." As a generality, the longer residents have lived in
Prince William, the more dissatisfied they are with the way growth was
outpacing the County's ability to accommodate it.

Remarkably, only half the residents pronounced themselves
dissatisfied with traffic conditions; half actually declared that they
were "satisfied" or "very satisfied." There were pockets of deep
discontent, however, in North County, Gaineville/Linton Hall and
Brentsville.

The Prince William Conservation Alliance drew these conclusions in a
press release commenting on the survey:

This years' survey reports that only 39.6% of citizens say they are
satisfied with in-county travel conditions. This is an 18 point drop
since 2002, and a 23 point drop since 2000.

This steady and statistically significant decline in citizen
satisfaction with in-county travel is perhaps especially troubling
because it coincides with the time period during which Prince William
invested substantial amounts of local tax dollars to construct new and
improved roads.

Prince William's 2006 Citizen Satisfaction Survey continues to show
declining citizen confidence in land use planning, growth and
transportation processes. This information echoes the visible and
growing consensus that we cannot build our way out of traffic
congestion.

We can't build our way out. We can't build our way out. We can't
build our way out.

Nonsense. Not relevant.

Even if the new construction does not actually ease congestion, it
will still service more people before the congestion occurs. The
congestion may still exist because more people leave later than they
might have before. The existence of congestion doesn't mean that the
service is worse.

Same goes for Metro. It has not reduced congestion, but that doesn't
mean it doesn't provide an additional usefuls service. What it does mean
is that in both cases we should evaluate what the additional service
actually provides with respect to its cost.

In PW some of their construction projects have not been completed
yet. Some may be inadequate when they are completed, like Linton Hall
Road. It is hard to imagine how the number of homes that have been
constructed in that area can be serviced by what is essential one main
Boulevard.

Here is a situation where the county built a new place and didn't
complete the job, so it's no wonder people are dis-satisfied. PW has
more people, and more density, so it is no surprise they are more people
unhappy, especially with transportation.

But there is another side to the coin: how unhappy would they be if
they had no place to live? How unhappy would they be if they were priced
out of the market by an even greater run up in home values caused by
local officials who deny or delay building permits?

I'm not sure the county is doing me a favor if they save me some
money on roads and it winds up costing me more for my house.

It is hardly surprising that newer residents would express higher
satisfaction that long-time residents. The former have recently made the
decision to move into PWC, and therefore should be expected to express a
high level of satisfaction. The latter have the advantage of the longer
view, and have experienced rising taxes and worsening transportation.

Of course, so long as both groups vote, politicians will only care
about the views of those constituting the majority. So long as
immigration remains high, and there is a one-third annual turnover in
the voting roles, don't expect the long-term views to receive much
regard from the politicians.

That's an interesting point. I never heard it expressed that way.

I wonder where the immigration is FROM? Could it be that the
newcomers are more satisfied because they came from someplace even
worse?

re: "they came from someplace even worse?"

that's what the folks who move down to Fredericksburg from NoVa
say....

:-)

Seriously.... people who have lived here for 20-30-40 years will tell
you how bad things have gotten ...but those 5000 folks who moved down
here in the last few years.. think our congestion is just wonderful
compared to where they lived in NoVa (except for the I-95 commute).

We've also had folks who moved here from Chicago and New York and
L.A. who say they can't understand what all the bellyaching is about...
cause it's nirvana compared to where they came from....

so a couple of questions for today:

1. can anyone tell me of a time/place where there is truly gridlock
as a normal daily event - as opposed to a bad wreck or similiar?

2. is there a certain level of population verses existing lane miles
of road where adding more population will lead to daily gridlock? Got an
example?

There are some analyst type folks out there who claim that you'll
never see true gridlock.. because people will change their driving
behavior and/or where they live.. once it gets "bad enough".. so
congestion is a normal progression... that ultimately results in changes
... where folks adapt to the congestion - not without much whining
though. :-)

.. let me know.. when folks start moving away from Virginia because
of the congestion.. and I'll take notice!

You should note the reason why the County does this survey: it is
part of its budget process.

The County finds out from the users of its services, e.g., its
citizens, how they view the services they receive. These results are
then used to re-allocate funds and change budget priorities to ensure
that service levels remain high and/or to address problem areas. This is
Performance Based Budgeting in action.

Imagine if the State Government did this!

I wonder where the immigration is FROM? India, Pakistan, El Salvador,
Bolivia, Mexico, Korea, Vietnam, Liberia, Ghana...

Could it be that the newcomers are more satisfied because they came
from someplace even worse?

I would think so...

An abundance of in-laws leads me to spend substantial time in PW.
It's difficult to sort out how much congestion is caused by population
gorwth and how much is caused by an aggressive County program to
construct roads to deal with congestion. Prince William more than any of
the other high growth counties gave up on Richmond a long time ago and
just started taking matters into its own hands on road construction.
Connaughton's stated theory (particularly after the failure of the
regional transportation tax referendum) was that putting things off any
longer waiting for Richmond to get its act together would just lead to
higher costs. I consider it a sub-optimal solution from a policy
standpoint, but it is probably the wisest course from among an array of
unpalatable alternatives.

The Prince William Conservation Alliance can't have it both ways:
complaining about congestion and complaining about the (hopefully
temporary) disruption caused by trying to address the congestion. The
latter is transitory.

For the record: When people refer to "Richmond" this and "Richmond"
that, they're usually referring to the General Assembly (whom we
Richmonders don't elect), the Governor (whom we don't elect) or the
state bureaucracts (whom we don't appoint). We Richmonders are as
afflicted as the rest of you by the apparatus of state government.

“ As a generality, the longer residents have lived in Prince William,
the more dissatisfied they are with the way growth was outpacing the
County's ability to accommodate it. ”

Given that change is continual —‘the only thing constant is change’—
older residents will always be less satisfied than others.

It’s straight statistics that the longer the residence, the greater
the accumulation of changes, and the higher the probability they will
find (some) change objectionable.

Rephrased culturally, a resident with zero months of residence simply
can’t complain about change at all, a five-year resident can complain a
bit, and a lifelong resident can complain all they want!

OK for what it is worth, I have a different perception of gridlock vs
congestion.

I figure gridlock is when no one can move because the intersections
are blocked with traffic backed up from the next signal.

This happens at the intersection of K sreet and the Key bridge where
it can be impossible to make a left turn for several lights. Likewise in
Downtown DC you may be trapped at a light for several changes when
vehicles "block the square". Articulated buses seem to cause some of
this.

So my definition of gridlock is when you have to wait more than three
cycles to get through a signal or intersection because of an signal on
the next intersection. This condition occurs mostly in, guess what, a
grid like street system.

The intersection of 29th street and Wisconsin near the Naval
Obsrvatory is a classic. When traffic is moving on Mass Ave, you can't
get out, and when the light changes at the Observatory, 29th street is
immediately blocked. The only way out is if someone takes mercy on you.
When I lived there, I would regularly see a Jag with diplomatic plates
drive over the sidewalk and use that as a merge lane to Wisconsin, on
his way to the British Embassy.

For a Virginia example I'd look at Route 123 in Vienna, Merrifield,
as well as parts of Falls Church.

My definition of major congestion is when it takes more than 20
minutes to travel 2 miles. At that point you would be nearly as well off
(speed-wise, not counting freight) walking.

Tobias is right, though, 40% of congestion problems are incident
related. Recently there was a crash on Route 66 that involved 2 medevac
helicopters and the road was closed for more than two hours.

At that point, route 55 directly parallels 66 and could easily have
been used as a detour, with an easy re-entry to the highway after the
crash. This would likely not be known to most of the highway travelers.
Even with dozens of emergency vehicles and police on the scene, no one
was given the task of setting up the detour.

It does seem to me that road construction projects take entirely too
long. When you think of what that heavy machinery costs, it's hard to
imagine you wouldn't want it working around the clock, yet there it
sits, nights and weekends.

Apparently there are rules that say you cannot start until after six
or seven because it disturbs the neighbors. And the night shift does
raise costs. The costs to the traveling public are not considered when
making the construction plans, because they are external costs.

Road construction seems to be utterly disorganized: something happens
everyday, but yet there is little progress. Given the amount of time
allowed for construction, I guess I'm not too impressed when the
projects are finished "on time". The Greenway (a private project) was
built in record time as compared to the comparable widening of 66 that
occured around the same time.

I have seen it written that some construction projects actually cause
more delays than they will EVER alleviate compared to the previous
condition. If that is true, then there is something seriously wrong with
our construction plans. In such a case it would be literally true that
you can't build your way out of congestion.

For a daily congestion situation it would be hard to beat the
situation near the intersection of 66 and 495. 66 gets continuously
narrower as you apporach the city from Manassas, which is backwards by
any way of thinking. At the intersection you must carpool or get off.
But since 495 is jammed, both the left hand exit and right hand exit
back up. When the left exit lane backs up it blocks the carpool lane, so
that even those going through, can't get out of the way. Even the Vienna
Metro station contributes to the problem in that area.

The double switchback ramp from 495 to 66 west is a gem, too. Two
lanes merge right into one lane near the bottom of the ramp, and then
immediately merge left onto the highway. This is Guaranteed Confusion,
that could be eased by changing the sign and the merge arrows painted on
the lane.

Another thing that has always amazed me was the failure of VDOT to
open the shoulder lane (the one with the big red "X") on 66 when there
is heavy congestion. I'm sure that some backups could be eliminated in a
reasonable period of time by using this simple tact. It's one thing to
bemoan the lack of transportation facilities, but something else to let
existing ones sit unused.

I also suspect that the construction and use of reverse lanes
(depending on traffic conditions) might add quite a bit of flexibility.
But these small, but partial solutions, are never discussed by the
"let's tax and pave more" crowd. Just more evidence that they are much
more concerned with other issues (e.g., opening up their landholdings
for development or obtaining more VDOT contracts) than with moving
traffic safely.

Well, we have 2 Ghanian and 1 Liberian immigrant(s) in our employ
here at Dulles. It was a serious comment. They do like it better here as
you might imagine. But I won't beat the immigration horse again as I
think it is expired...

Ok… a few examples.

I should start off by saying that traffic congestion/gridlock is the
main source of my opposition to the Dulles South CPAM’s.

a) Intersection of 606/621 (Loudoun County Parkway/Evergreen Mills
Road). At 8:00AM northbound 606 will be backed-up from 621 to Route 50,
that’s about a mile. It can take as much as 15 minutes to clear this
intersection. I should mention that after you have cleared the
intersection 606 is still backed up stop-and-go another 3 miles or so
until you reach the Dulles Greenway (my GPS has already recorded it took
me 20 minutes to drive 1.5 miles). A Loudoun County OTS memo from May
2006 refers to this intersection as having a serious congestion problem
.

http://inetdocs.loudoun.gov/planning/docs/route50_/82806_/attachment06ots/attachment06ots.pdf

I watched this intersection go from no back up, 1 light cycle
clearance to a 10-15 minute hurdle. There is a direct correlation imo to
the expanded developments in South Riding, Stone Ridge and Kirkpatrick
Farms. But I have expounded on the disaster of 606 and how it is hurting
our airport business elsewhere.

b) Intersection of Pleasant Valley Road/Braddock Road. This is a 4
way stop. At 8:00AM eastbound Braddock will be backed up stop-and-go for
about .6 to 1 mile. It will take about 10-20 minutes to clear this
intersection depending on how backed up the other 3 directions
approaching this 4 way stop are. At around 5:30PM westbound Braddock
will be backed up anywhere from .5 mile to past Old Lee Road (more than
a mile).

Again, these back-ups are a result of the developments along Route
50. The congestion on Route 50 is so bad that people will bail off onto
any and all side roads they can find – they are willing to sit in
20-minute backups for the chance to drive on dirt roads and ford creeks.
These are but 2 small examples – I could cite many more.

I am not sure why it has happened that all these developments have
gone in without any significant planning or road improvements. And
contrary to the propaganda almost all the developments were re-zonings
not by right (i.e. South Riding, South Riding Station, Loudoun Valley
Estates, Brambleton, Stone Ridge, Kirkpatrick Farms etc. etc. etc.).

I fail to understand why no one is sympathetic to the plight of tens
of thousands of commuters. It is dismissed as of no consequence.
Everyone thinks I’m just another environmentalist whacko trying to
conserve land. I am merely in favor of having adequate infrastructure in
place before massive developments are approved and built. And the local
politician/developer cabal has more than amply demonstrated they are
incapable of planning, financing and building such infrastructure. And
now we are to trust that this time they will get it right? <
