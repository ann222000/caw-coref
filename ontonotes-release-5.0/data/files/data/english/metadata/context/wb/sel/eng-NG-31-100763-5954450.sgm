I have seen that Nori is made from a plankton that is strained in sieves
to make a paper-like seaweed-like substance that is used to wrap "sushi" in.

I have also seen that Nori is real leaves of seaweed..

Which is it?

Does anyone know about the pool process that makes nori from algae?

you can buy kombu (kelp?) in sheets - is that the same as nori?

Thanks,

Covering various questions and comments:

Nori is made from seaweed.  The seaweed most often used to make nori is
in the category (probably Genus) called Porphyra.  Seaweed is a
non-technical name generally considered to encompass varieties of
multicellular algae, unlike the microscopic algae that most people
think of when they think of algae.  The Porphyra seaweed used in most
commercial nori is farmed.

Kombu is a type of kelp seaweed, which is a different form of algae
from Porphyra.

Nori is made using a technique that is much like papermaking and dates
back at least to the Edo period in Japan.

Nori is best eaten when it is made crisp from a brief exposure to
burning charcoal and then wrapped around one of Masa Takayama's
extraordinary creations.

You may not know this, but Go players are ranked as kyus (lesser players)
and dans (better players). A first dan is the lowest of the dans, second dan
is better and so on.

If you are even a first dan, you're very good. I don't play in tournaments
and have no official rating, but if I did, I'd be a mid-kyu player.

Congratulations on your being a dan. ;-)

Given the urge to produce rankings and such statistics, it's no
wonder the Japanese like baseball :-)

Incidently, the Karate ranking nomenclature is essentially the same. A first
degree black-belt is a first dan, and so on.

time when we need it.  But, you also replied :-) and I
