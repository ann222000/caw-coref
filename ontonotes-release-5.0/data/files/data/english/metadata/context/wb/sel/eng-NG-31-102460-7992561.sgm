Bankers Planned World Wars to Destroy Germany
August 3, 2007

By Henry Makow, Ph.D.

We study history because the secret forces that determined the past are still in charge. The past illuminates the present and the future.

In his book &quot;Conjuring Hitler: How Britain and America Made the Third Reich&quot;, (2005) economic historian Guido Preparata demonstrates how the two World Wars essentially were traps designed by London-based central bankers to destroy Germany as a national entity.

In 1914, &quot;the web was spun and Germany entered it like a great buzzing fly.&quot; (24)

Later, the Bank of England created the conditions for Nazism and &quot;devoted herself to supporting financially the Nazis and subsequently arming them to the teeth with the prospect of manipulating them.&quot; (xvi)

&quot;This game of Anglo American supremacy came at the cost of approximately 70 million lives (two world wars); a holocaust whose nature is beyond words. Both conflicts were willed and set off by Britain.... there is something far worse than Nazism, and that is the hubris of the Anglo-American fraternities, whose routine is to incite indigenous monsters to war, and steer the pandemonium to further their imperial aims.&quot; (xix)

By &quot;fraternities&quot; Preparata, should be referring to lodges. The Masonic &quot;New World Order&quot; is &quot;British&quot; imperialism repackaged. A small degenerate financial elite based in the City of London has always desired to colonize the world. As we have seen, these Illuminati bankers plan a third world war between political Zionism (i.e. Israel and the US) and Islam (i.e. Iran) designed to destroy both sides.

Germany never represented a threat, nor does Iran. The purpose of these wars is to destroy the nation state, slaughter the best of humanity, demoralize, dehumanize, and profit. The ultimate goal is a veiled world dictatorship by the central bankers.

INSIGHTS

Preparata, who has a Ph.D. in Economic History from Southern Cal and teaches at the University of Washington, is not familiar with the Masonic agenda. But he is honest and smart enough to bare its workings.

For example he says nearly all terrorism is state sponsored. &quot;In general the art of terror entails (the state's) underground promotion of a fictitious grouping: say an 'ethnic army of liberation' or a radical militia...[and involving it in]

Sabotage either against the state itself or against the targeted enemy...In the first case, a variety of prearranged ends all congruent in point of social control and surveillance, is swiftly implemented...the evanescent Bin Laden and his lieutenants are from start to finish an invention of the CIA.&quot; (21)

The goal is war for its own sake. In the second half of the Nineteenth Century, the bankers built up Germany to rival England, in order to have a war. When Germany was not destroyed in 1914-1918, they built up the Weimar Republic. Weimar was entirely dependent on financial transfusions from the UK/US. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 partly was contrived to elect Hitler.

The bankers also used their Communist puppets as a &quot;threat&quot; to ensure that Hitler was elected as &quot;a bulwark against Communism.&quot;

Meanwhile, &quot;The attitude of the Communists toward Hitler's moderate opponents remained undeviatingly hostile and destructive.... this aided the Nazis.&quot; (190)

Preparata is remarkably clear about the mechanics of the Second World War. IG Farben, the company that supplied Nazi Germany with its war machine was part of Standard Oil. In exchange for the world rights for the synthetic oil process (outside of Germany), in 1929 Standard Oil transferred $35 billion in stock to I.G. Farben. The two companies were also linked by patent and cartel agreements.

Here is a partial list of the proportion of Nazi war materiel supplied by I.G. Farben/Standard Oil: Synthetic rubber (100%); dyestuffs (100%); poison gas (95%) explosives (84%); gun powder (70%); aviation gas (46%) not to mention Zyklon B.

Preparata sheds light on many of the murkier aspects of inter-war history: the betrayal of the White Russians by the Allies; the 1922 Rapalo Agreement where the future pugilists Russia and Germany actually trained in Blitzkrieg tactics together; the careers of such shadowy operatives as Alexander Helphand (Parvus), Walter Rathenau, Trebitsch Lincoln, Hjalmar Schacht, and General Kurt Von Schleicher, who finally tried in vain to stop Hitler.

Preparata reports that Montagu Norman (Governor of the Bank of England ,1920-1944) suffered &quot;sudden fits of melancholy, seizures of despondency so unbearable that his nerves would snap...&quot; He had a tendency to &quot;over dramatize, beguile and bamboozle the whole world.&quot; (148)

Unfortunately, Preparata overlooks the most important and most mysterious figure of them all, Max Warburg.

Preparata thinks the Anglo Americans were motivated by a fear that Germany and Russia would unite against them. This was not the real concern. But even if the author doesn't see the big picture, he gets many details right.

CONCLUSION

For some time I've been saying that the Nazis were created by the Illuminati to seduce and destroy Germany. See &quot;Illuminati Used Appeasement to Trick Hitler&quot; and &quot;Illuminati Bankers Hired Hitler to Start World War II&quot;

A relatively small clique with power to create money holds mankind hostage. nfortunately its agenda is to destroy and enslave humanity-using war and education/media as its principal instruments.

Therefore, when it comes to war, we can tune out the rhetoric. All wars are against humanity. They are inherent in the organization of society and in the treason of its leadership. Certainly the next one will be aimed at the United States, in much the same way as Germany. The US already has entered the web like a &quot;great buzzing fly.&quot;
