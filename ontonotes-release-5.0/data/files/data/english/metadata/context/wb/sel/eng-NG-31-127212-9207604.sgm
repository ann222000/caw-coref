&quot;Williams was injured in the second quarter Monday on a play when he
fumbled. After being tackled, he was accidentally stepped on while chest-
down on the ground.&quot;

Bullshit.  The dirty Steeler player deliberately jump stomped his
shoulder.

Sure, he wasn't thinking at all about the loose ball lying on the ground
right in front of him, or about how a fumble recovery in a still-scoreless
game might be a big deal and really help out his team. No, he was thinking
about how great it would be to deliberately step on a downed Dolphin
player's shoulder because Williams was just killing the Steelers with his
incredible performance during that game.

Does that really sound like a plausible scenario to any rational person?

Sorry guys, but you've been had by Flipper Mike. Posting came from anonymous
poster that Flipper uses. Flipper has already identified my name and my ID.
He simply combined them and posted this crap. So the &quot;newest Steeler fan&quot; is
the same old pet troll.

Go Steelers!

Deliberately stomped, but only because, for a brief moment, Ricky looked
like Carson Palmer.

Good grief, are fans this stupid to think Timmons is dirty?  Timmons
didn't step on Williams on purpose.  Get over it already.

Are you so stupid as to think he didn't?

All Steeler players are out to injure key players who can make the
difference on an opposing team.

Proof?  Sure, according to an article I read Tomlin wants us to be
within the rules and be more &quot;violent&quot; but the sport is violent.  But I
would like you to provide proof that every Steeler player from our OT to
our QB to our Punter of all people are out to injure key players on
opposing teams.

*waits for proof*

I didn't think so.

Bye.

I hear you loud and clear.  I also KNOW from my wife, who is a Ravens'
fan, that this is what the Squealers do. After the Ricky incident
occurred she recounted how - after a play two years ago - two
Squealiers kicked and punched Todd Heap while he was down, after a
play and vicious helmet hit. He had to leave. Of course, none of the
refs saw a thing. (It happened in Spitsburg)

Anyone who doesn't believe Timmons did it on purpose is a grade A dope
and moron, and isn't aware of the past history of how the Squealers'
hit men get away with this shit.

Heap was out for weeks after the &quot;collateral&quot; beating he got from the
Steelers,

Timmons, as I said, ought to be fined a half mil and suspended the
rest for the year. That is the LEAST the NFL could do after Timmons
now essentially single-handedly increased the Dolphins chances of
going O for 16 by 100%.
