Ms. Luna has been baking in the sun frequently.  Her owners have previously
reported that she prefers hanging out in the coolest areas of the house, and
when I went to pick her up, she was chillin' on the tile floor of the
bathroom.  Which is leading me to wonder if I am keeping the house too cold
during the day.  The house is kept at 74 degrees during the day in summer,
mostly because that's where Khan is at least somewhat comfortable.  It may
be a couple of degrees cooler at night (plus the fan), because he'll puff
and pant all night long otherwise, and being a light sleeper, that keeps me
awake.

Does this strike the rest of you  as being excessively cold?  I am starting
to worry about her, because even a much more nekkid Pan doesn't want to go
out and bake herself like this, and definitely not with the same kind of
frequency.

No.  I think we've talked about this many, many times, but
some dogs just like to bake in the sun (including some of my
very hairy winter-loving huskies).  Is she curling up in a
ball or stretching out?  Is she trying to curl up right next

What do you think would happen if you jacketed her?

I personally can't tolerate 74 degrees. But I also can't tolerate baking
in the sun. The lowest I usually go at home is 78. Zoe is always lying on
the coolest floor she can find, or sometimes she is draped over an AC
vent. Queenie is either on furniture or, more often, baking in the sun.
She has no body fat, I don't think. Max likes the furniture too and
prefers to be inside for the most part.

It is a bit strange that she usually likes the cool floor but has now
taken to lying outside. Is she avoiding your dogs, by any chance?

I think I was concerned because her behavior is otherwise very much like

Stretched out.  She's hot to the touch when she comes in, and panting hard.

Varies.  Sometimes curled up, but mostly stretched out.  Also, her folks
report that she does not like getting up in bed with them; starts getting
overheated and leaves a couple of minutes after she gets on, but here, she's
been helping herself to all vacant spots, and if kicked off, will eventually
find her way back up there some time during the early morning hours.

Other than this, no.  She asks to go out once every couple of hours, and
stays out for more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time.  She even did that when
the temps hit 100 degrees.

Her folks have attempted to put dog booties on her, and I know that didn't

That says a lot right there.  Dogs curl up to conserve heat
(and those of the hairy-tailed ilk will cover their noses
with their tails - there's a good chance you've seen Khan do
this).  If she's not behaving as if she's cold inside the
house I wouldn't worry too much about it.  It's most likely
that she's just doing the doggy version of the hot tub, or
baking at the beach.  See what you notice when she's inside,
apart from her choosing to go bake in the sun.

I don't think so.  She's actually taken to going down to the basement and
draggng Khan's butt upstairs, and at the moment, she's sharing the couch
with Pan.  Pan is feeling put out by having her at home, but she is not
allowed to act on those impulses, so she's just being extra clingy with me.

There have been a couple of times when I resorted to putting a wet
light-colored t-shirt on a black dog in danger of overheating.  You have
to knot the shirt at the spine, Hooter's waitress-style, so the dog
doesn't keep tripping over a saggy hem.  In my experience the dogs
didn't seem to mind unless it was making them trip and fall.  It
probably felt pretty good.

She looks like a doggie version of little orphan Annie.  I put a throw-away
white T-shirt of mine on her.  She hung around me for a bit, probably hoping
I'd regain my senses and take it off, but is sleeping on the couch with Pan
now.  I've left it on, to see if it would change her behavior any.

I might get my dog sitting privileges revoked if her folks found out what
I'm doing to the poor dog.

Not excessively.  Harriet gets a little chilled if it gets below 76F,
but life's tough.  I just set the thermostat where it's comfortable to
me and keep blankets around for Harriet to curl up with.  But, even if
it were 86F, she'd still want to go outside and bake her little brain

Poor, poor Harriet!  Having such a mean, uncaring owner for herself.

Actually, I think I'd be happier if the temps were closer to 77 or 78
degrees in the house, but Khan would probably run away from home if I did
that.  Even in the middle of summer, I sometimes find it necessary to wrap
myself up in something warm, or go sit outside and give myself a heat
stroke.  Maybe Luna's like that too.  Plus, she's got low body fat - might
keep her colder than I'm thinking.

Faith does this.  She is a total temperature weenie.  Hates it too hot
or too cold.  But she loves to lay out in the sun.  We tease her about
trying to get a tan when she is already black and tan.  She doesn't
stay out there past when she is hot and panting, so we just make sure
she has plenty of water and can come in when she is ready and let her
bask in the sunshine.

Your house does seem pretty cool, but not so cold that it would cause
a problem.  OTOH, if there is a noticeable difference between your
house and Luna's normal house, that could well account for why she
goes for the coolest spots in their house and not in yours.  You could
both still be in normal range but be at the extremes of normal,
causing a marked difference in behavior in one house vs. the other.

Our downstairs bathroom has an AC vent in it and a tile floor.  Guess
where Molly hangs out all summer, when she isn't in the pool, anyway.
She gets kind of pissy when Sammie goes in there with her and shuts
the door, though.  She usually noses the door closed enough to keep
the cold air in but not enough that it latches and she can't get out.
She prefers to be able to go out as she pleases for a bite to eat or a
swim.  At least she can still get drinks since she learned how to lift
the toilet lid.

Did I once say that I like smart dogs?  Obviously they are smarter
than I am.

I decided due to some health issues that I would just keep the place a
comfortable temperature all the time and pay the consequent utility
bills. It's actually not that much more. Of course I add layers in the
winter and wear cool clothes in the summer -- I'm not a lunatic.

I often have the temp at 70 in the winter, and those couple of degrees
make a big difference to my comfort.

Very possible,  I have normal ceilings.  I actually like it cold with a
blanket on, but even keeping it at 64 during the winter, I can't do
flannel sheets - too hot!    We have a woodstove insert in our family
room fireplace, and since we spend most of our evening time there, it's
very cozy.  For sleeping, the cooler the better.  My room is the warmest
in the house, which is good in winter, not so good in summer.  We keep a
fan going along with the AC.  Better if we leave the door open, but with
Carey cat keeping us all awake, that's not a good idea.

It's really hard to say without seeing her stacked (or at
least in profile), and even then it would be really hard to
say.  She's clearly got some kind of husky in there
somewhere, although how recently would be ... really hard to
say.  To the extent that she might be an Alaskan (i.e. bred
for the sled) she appears to be more of the distance type
than the sprint type, but she could very well be neither and
is just a happy mixed breed with a Siberian back in there
somewhere.  It's really hard to say.

In as far as I know about these things, I'd agree.  She's pretty lightly
built under all the hair, and her trail manners are excellent (if you don't
mind the pulling).  Very single minded of purpose.  Sally's description of
the impatient dog, kind of tapping its toes and looking at the clock rings

She reminds me a bit of the last dog (Chaco) in the Jeff King link.
Hairier, but similar structure.  BTW, how large do these dogs get?  I
thought she was probably about 40 pounds or so, but after picking her up a
bunch of times, I think she's lower than that, in the 35 pound range.

I really don't think you can.  I think you could probably
argue that if looks like an Alaskan and behaves like an
Alaskan it's an Alaskan, since they're really just mutts.
They're generally (but not always, alas) more carefully bred
than the vast majority of mutts, but they're still mutts -
mutts with a job.  Still, people can be really fastidious
about pedigrees for these mutts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;BTW, how large do these dogs get?

We're back in &quot;It's hard to say&quot; land.  Anywhere from 35lbs
up to about 70, depending on the kennel, the race
specialization (for example, Yukon Quest dogs are typically
larger and leggier than Iditarod dogs), and so on.

Luna might enjoy canicross or bikejoring or scootering or
something along those lines.  There are a lot of resources
out there right now for someone who wants to get started.

different levels, bundle up when it gets cold and do things other than
crank up the AC to keep cool until it gets higher up there.

I wish that they would solve some of my problems instead of solving

Molly and Sammie, and now Scooter, are brainy because the universe
needs to balance out Gunther and Faith.  Gunther is truly dense and
Faith, while she has brains, is so lazy that the universe could not be
expected to know that.  In any event, when it comes to figuring out
the coolest spots to lay around in super hot weather or how to drink
out of the toilet when your horrible humans put the lids down, no
brain cell should be left unturned, according to my crew.

It is pretty entertaining to watch Sammie and Molly have bathroom door
wars.  They are bestest friends, but you can tell he gets on her last
nerve sometimes.  He lives by the &quot;do it now and charm your way out of
trouble for it later&quot; philosophy.

We have Valentina here a lot lately.  Anna has her first training gig.
Her friend brings Valentina over and Anna teaches her friend how to
train Valentina while working with Valentina.  Then the friend's mom
takes them to Target or somewhere similar and lets them pick out a
clothing or accessory item.  I would have warned the mom not to send
Valentina here for training as my dogs tend to train each other in
ways that aren't that desirable (okay, who shut themselves in the
bathroom this time?!), but since Valentina is even dimmer than
Gunther, I decided to let Anna keep her job and not worry about it.  I
still need to get a picture of Scooter using the float as a way to be
&quot;in&quot; the pool but not &quot;in the pool.&quot; I am sad about pictures now,
though because I hate his new hair cut.  It had to be done, but I miss
his beard and spikies on top of his head and stuff.  I'm going to go
sob softly now.

&gt; Actually, I wanted to post about this...
&gt; Is around 70-74 degrees farenheit too cold for a 3 month old puppy?
&gt; I really like it cold or I can't sleep!
&gt; My puppy (toy poodle) doesn't curl in a ball, he sometimes sleep on
&gt; his back or side stretched out... !!!
">

when I got my toy poodle, he slept on my bed with the AC on and two fans.
he never went under the covers and was fine with the cold.  i did find out
when i went tent camping in October (yes, I am that crazy) that he is smart
enough to know when to stay covered up because those nights he slept in my
sleeping bag and under two extra covers.  even I was cold!

I'll raise you crazy. Next month I'm going camping in the colorado mountains
at 11,000 feet.  We always have  snow on the ground when we are there. We
heat the water to thaw it to use it.

Do you have an extra room in your house???

I'm constantly getting in trouble over the electric bill... or certain
people not wanting to sleep in the same room as me and complaining
about having to wear sweaters to bed.

Maybe I can move in and help you with the electric bill...

Air conditioning was unheard of when I was growing up!  Outdoor shopping
centers (now turned into mega malls), definitely no AC in schools, etc.
We couldn't have fans in windows because my brother and I were/are
asthmatic and couldn't breathe grassy air.  So we basically had CLOSED
windows or barely open windows in the summer.   And I spent most of my
life with heat rash.

We got AC when I was 17 and I got used to it for a few years, then moved
to Baltimore in the summer, to a house with no AC.  Heat rashes came
right back, at the age of 21.  Not my idea of fun.  I enjoy my central
AC and my pool and spend whatever I have to - it's a medical expense!

I don't remember much about winter temps indoors.  I remember we all
liked to sit on the floor in front of the heat register in the bathroom.
That one was right over the furnace and toasty first thing in the
morning.  With only one bathroom, and 7 people there was a lot of &quot;get
out of there and stop sitting in front of the heat!&quot;  Second best was
the corner bedroom.  That wall had a mark a about 2 feet over the
register, where we'd have our heads against the wall.
