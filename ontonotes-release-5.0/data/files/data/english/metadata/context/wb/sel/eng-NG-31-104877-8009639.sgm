Gon. Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboord.
.
Botes. None that I more loue then my selfe. You are
a Counsellor, if you can command these Elements to si-
lence, and worke the peace of the present, wee will not

Gon. I haue great comfort from this fellow: methinks

&gt; rain, people would tie up black dogs, and let them starve. They

.     *The violent Saint James Day Storm*
..........................................................?.
. http://shakespeareauthorship.com/tempest.html
&lt;&lt;On *St.ELMO's day* , 1609, nine ships set out from England, carrying
around 600 people, to strengthen the new English colony in Virginia.
The &quot;Sea-Venture&quot; was the lead ship, and carried Sir Thomas Gates,
the newly-appointed Governor of the colony, and Sir George Somers, the
Admiral of the Virginia Company. For most of the voyage all went well,
.
. but *on July 25 a violent storm* (probably a hurricane)
.   overtook the ships and raged for several days.
.
After the storm had subsided, four of the nine ships found
each other and proceeded on to Virginia, and three of the others
eventually made it into port as well. The &quot;Sea-Venture&quot; never showed
up, and was presumed to be lost; word to that effect made it back to
England by the fall and created a public sensation, since interest in
the expedition was very high. But unknown to the rest of the world,
the battered ship had managed to reach Bermuda before running aground,
with all aboard making it safely ashore. The Bermudas had a reputation
as a place of devils &amp; wicked spirits, but the colonists found it
to be very pleasant, and they lived there for the next nine months
while building a new ship out of native wood under Somers's guidance.
They set sail on May 10, 1610, and reached *Jamestown* two weeks
later. A ship carrying Governor Gates and others left
*Jamestown* two months later and reached England in September;
the news of their survival caused another public sensation.&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------
Kathman: &lt;&lt;Strachey tells how:
.
&quot;we...had now purposed to have cut down the Maine Mast&quot;;
the boatswain in the play cries, &quot;Down with the topmast!&quot; .&gt;&gt;
.
&quot;Our clamours dround in the windes, and the windes in *THUNDER* .
Prayers might well be in the heart and lips, but drowned in the
outcries of the officers&quot; (7); in the play the boatswain says,
&quot;A plague upon this howling; they are louder than the weather,
or our office&quot; , and a few lines later the mariners cry,
&quot;To prayers! To prayers!&quot;
.
&quot;in the beginning of the storme we had received likewise
a mighty leake&quot; (8); Gonzalo says the ship in the play
is &quot;as leaky as an unstanched wench&quot; .&gt;&gt;

.   John the Divine, Apostle and Evangelist
.
&lt;&lt;When John was en route to preach in Asia, his ship was
wrecked in a *STORM* ; all but John were cast ashore.
*John was assumed dead* but 2 weeks later the waves cast
him ashore alive at the feet of his disciple Prochoros.
.
Aboard ship, he purified vessels of sea water for drinking.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;John, the &quot;BELOVED disciple&quot; of our Lord (John 13:23; 19:26;
20:2ff; 21:7; 21:24), is said to have written the Book of REVElation,
the last book of the Bible, while exiled on the island of Patmos off
the coast of modern Turkey. John was the son of Zebedee &amp; Salome,
and the younger brother of James the Great.
.
These two brothers earned their livelihood as fishermen on Lake
Genesareth until they were called by Jesus to be fishers of men
(Matt. 4:21-22; Mark 1:19-20). The youngest of the Apostles (estimated
at about 25 at the time of his call), John, seems to have been a
follower of John the Baptist, so particularly does he relate all the
circumstances of the precursor's life, yet through modesty conceals
his own name, as in other parts of the Gospel bearing his name.
.
.  Christ gave James &amp; John the surname of *BOANERGES*
.       -The Sons of  *THUNDER*  (Mark 3:17)-
.
to express their passionate NATURES. They wanted to call
down fire from Heaven on the Samaritans who rejected Christ
(Luke 9:54-56) and they said they were willing to suffer as
witnesses to Jesus' suffering (Mark 10:35-41). This holy
boldness would benefit the faith by allowing them to make
the law of God known without fearing the power of men.&gt;&gt;

[Appeared in the Summer 1996 Shakespeare Oxford Newsletter.]
.
&lt;&lt;The 'Phaeton' sonnet appeared under the title 'Phaeton to His
Friend
Florio' as a commendatory poem in John Florio's book Second Fruits,
published in 1591. It merits careful study. In 1591 Florio
(1554'-1625)
had lately served as tutor to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton,
and he later became a friend and protege of William Herbert, Earl of
Pembroke, both of whom are believed to have been Shakespeare's
patrons.
Florio is now chiefly remembered for his translation of Montaigne;
the
son of Italian Jewish immigrants who had become Protestants, he was
best
known in his own time for his fashionable books of Italian lore, of
which Second Fruits is one. As Robert Giroux argues in The Book Known
as Q, it seems likely that Florio and Shakespeare crossed paths,
especially since it appears that Shakespeare consulted Florio's
version of Montaigne's Essays in manuscript. Moreover, Florio may
well
have inspired the title of Love's Labour's Lost with his aphorism:
.
.      *It were LABOUR LOST to speak of LOVE*
.
The play also uses Italian expressions from his books, and the
character
Holofernes may be, as some surmise, based on Florio himself.
Beginning
with William Minto in the nineteenth century, a few scholars have
held
that 'Phaeton' and Shakespeare were the same poet. The reason most
have given is simply the sonnet's excellence. 'Those familiar with
the
commendatory verse of the period,' Minto wrote, 'will recognize at
once
its superiority.' In our own time Giroux and Peter Levi have revived
this thesis with plausible arguments. 'From a literary point of
view,'
Giroux says carefully, 'it is possible that the 'Phaeton' sonnet is
an
early poem of Shakespeare's. From a scholarly point of view, it is
clearly impossible to prove it.' In The Life and Times of William
Shakespeare, Levi goes further. The poem, he contends, 'is surely by
Shakespeare: he certainly knew Florio, though we don't know when they
met, and no other poet in 1591 could have written the sonnet.' He
adds:
'No other writer of sonnets is as good as this except Spenser, but
Spenser would have signed it. The humour is Shakespeare's, and so is
the movement of thought, so is the seasonal coloring.'  We should
note,
however, that the magisterial E.K. Chambers doubted that the poem
could be Shakespeare's.
.
Let us examine it line by line, beginning with its author's
pseudonym.
Phaeton: The name Phaeton is found in Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book 2.
Phaeton is the son of Phoebus Apollo who insists on driving his
father's chariot, only to scorch the earth and fall to his death.
Shakespeare refers to the Phaeton story five times in his plays.
.
Line 1 - Sweet friend: A typical Shakespearean endearment, as in
sweet
love (76, 79), thy sweet-beloved name (89), fair friend (114), sweet
boy
(108), my lovely boy (126), thy sweet self (126), my sweet'st friend
(133), etc. (Shakespeare uses the word sweet 72 times in the Sonnets,
and nearly a thousand times in his works as a whole.)
.
Line 1 - whose name agrees: Giroux notes that this phrase calls to
mind
John of Gaunt's cry 'O how that name befits my composition!' in
Richard
II (2,1,78). Shakespeare often remarks or plays on the aptness of
names,
as when Henry V ironically tells the blustering Ancient Pistol that
his
name 'sorts well with your fierceness' (Henry V, 4,1,64). In Titus
Andronicus (2,3,119) Lavinia tells 'barbarous Tamora' that 'no name
fits thy nature but thy own.' In Cymbeline (4,2,383) Lucius tells
'Fidele'(who is Imogen in disguise): 'Thy name well fits thy faith,
thy faith thy name.' At the end of the same play (5,6,444-6)
the Soothsayer says:
.
Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp.
The apt and fit construction of thy name,
Being leo-natus, doth import so much.
.
Notice too that the word fit, which I have italicized in these
examples,
appears in the second line of Phaeton's sonnet. The Sonnets also
refer
seven times to the youth's name (which they promise to immortalize,
yet, curiously, never actually mention).
.
Line 1 - thy increase: It is typical of Shakespeare to use increase as
a noun and to rhyme on it. As a matter of fact the very first line of
Sonnet 1 ends with it: 'From fairest creatures we desire increase.'
The word is almost the poet's trademark: 'Herein lives wisdom,
beauty,
and increase' (11), 'When I perceive that men as plants increase'
(15, though here for once it is a verb), 'The teeming autumn, big
with rich increase' (97). He often uses the word in his other works,
as in Venus and Adonis (169-70):
.
Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed,
Unless the earth with thy increase be fed'
.
Equally characteristic is 3 Henry VI (2,2,164): 'And that thy summer
bred us no increase' (which -see below- links increase to summer).
The reader may also recall such familiar examples as Hamlet's
'increase of appetite' and Lear's 'organs of increase.'
.
Line 2 How fit a rival art thou of the spring!: This line bears
witness to its author first in its syntax (Shakespeare often begins
an
exclamatory or declaratory clause or sentence with 'how,' using this
form 14 times in the Sonnets alone) and, more important, in likening
his
friend to a season: 'only herald to the gaudy spring' (1). Just as
the
Phaeton sonnet and Shakespeare's Sonnet 1 both end their first lines
with increase, so the Phaeton sonnet and Sonnet 1 both rhyme on
spring.
The most famous similitude between the poet's friend and a season is
of course Sonnet 18: 'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day''
Note the simile that begins 97:
.
How like a winter hath my absence been
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
.
And of course, seasonal images and analogies
dominate many of the sonnets, especially the early ones.
.
Line 3 - For when each branch hath left his flourishing: Richard II
(1,2,18) gives us 'One flourishing branch of his most royal root.'
The
word flourish also occurs in Sonnet 60. And 'each branch' has a close
match in 'every bough' (102) _ no great coincidence, but the sort of
thing we should expect if Phaeton and Shakespeare are the same poet.
.
Line 4 - And green-locked summer's shady pleasures cease: Compare
Sonnet
18: 'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day'' See also 'Making no
summer
of another's green' (68); 'The summer's flower is to the summer
sweet'
(94); 'For summer and his pleasures wait on thee' (97); and this
quatrain from 12:
.
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard.
.
Trees that are barren of leaves implies branches that have left their
flourishing, and canopy against heat implies shade. Beard also
suggests
locks. The Phaeton sonnet shows the same subtle patterns of
association
and imagery we find in Shakespeare. The Sonnets use shade, shady,
and shadow 16 times. And when Shakespeare mentions locks, he often
specifies their color (yellow, gory, grey, golden, browny).
.
Line 5 - She makes the winter's storms repose in peace: Compare
the line 'Against the stormy gusts of winter's day' (13).
Again, no miracle, but another interesting little similarity.
So is the occurrence of repose in Sonnets 27 and 50.
.
Line 6 - And spends her franchise on each living thing: Shakespeare
loves to blend legal and commercial language with seasonal imagery
and with the language of love. (The Sonnets contain at least
80 legal terms.) One of the most pertinent passages comes in 4:
.
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy'
Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
And, being frank, she lends to those are free.
.
The word spend occurs 14 times in the Sonnets, not to mention the
related words expense, thrift, waste, consume, and so forth. Spending
a
franchise and spending a legacy are kindred ideas, as the word frank,
cognate with franchise, underscores. Shakespeare uses the legal term
franchise and its variants about twenty times in all his works, a
remarkable number. Venus uses enfranchising as a metaphor at 369,
and The Two Gentlemen of Verona (3,1,156) has enfranchise within
two lines of the name Phaeton! (For extended legal metaphors, see
Sonnets 4, 13, 30, 35, 46, 49, 58, 87, 134, 136, 146, and 152.)
.
Line 6 - each living thing: This phrase, in its
position and function here, reminds us of Sonnet 98:
.
From you have I been absent in the spring,
When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim,
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing.
.
The epithet proud-pied April has several resemblances to green-lock'd
summer: A season is personified with a compound word that describes
its coloring. And April in this sonnet, like spring in Phaeton's,
vivifies all living things.
.
Line 7 - the little birds do sing: Shakespeare is particularly fond
of
the simple image of little birds singing: 'When birds do sing,/Hey
ding
a ding ding!' There are dozens of examples in the plays. In the
Sonnets
we find several: 'Upon those boughs . . . where late the sweet birds
sang' (73), 'And thou away, the very birds are mute' (97), 'the lays
of birds' (98), not to mention such variants as 'Philomel in summer's
front doth sing' (102). Commonplace as this image may seem, not every
poet uses it; it seems too naive for Marlowe or Jonson, for example.
.
Line 8 - Herbs, gums, and plants do vaunt of their release: Romeo and
Juliet (2,3,16) offers a parallel in plants, herbs, stones. Even more
striking is the brilliant image of plants exulting in spring: we find
the same image again in Sonnet 15, where 'men as plants
increase . . .
[and] vaunt in their youthful sap'! Venus (165) offers 'Herbs for
their
smell, and sappy plants to bear.' And release suggests 87's 'The
charter
of thy worth gives thee releasing.' Its legal overtones also recall
summer's lease (18) and several other uses of lease in the Sonnets.
Venus and Adonis (254-6) rhymes increasing and releasing.
.
Line 9 - So when that all our English wits lay dead: A faint echo
of Henry V (3,1,2): 'Or close the wall up with our English dead.'
.
Lines 10, 12 - evergreen, seen:
Shakespeare rhymes green and seen in four different sonnets.
.
Lines 11-14 - fruits, barrenness, pleasance, Italy: The antonym of
increase, barrenness is a theme of the Sonnets, which use the word
barren six times. I have already quoted 'barren of leaves' (12).
And in Shakespeare, barren is often accompanied by fruit. Compare
Venus, where fruitless chastity (751) is followed by barren dearth
(754). Or see A Midsummer Night's Dream (1, 1, 72-3), where a barren
sister is imagined chanting hymns to the cold fruitless moon. What
is more, Phaeton's association of fruit and pleasance with Italy
in the concluding section of this poem calls up several passages in
Shakespeare. Lucrece yields us barren skill (81) and, four stanzas
later, fruitful Italy (107). The Taming of the Shrew (1,1,3-4)
gives us fruitful Lombardy, The pleasant garden of great Italy.
.
And in Antony and Cleopatra (2,5,23-5),
Cleopatra welcomes the messenger from Rome with a sensual image:
.
. O, from Italy!
. Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
. That long time have been barren.
.
Line 11 - o'erspread: Shakespeare is fond of the prefix o'er;
the Sonnets give us o'ercharg'd, o'ergreen, o'erpress'd,
o'ersnow'd, o'ersways, and o'erworn, among other constructions.
(His plays boast such odd coinages as o'erwrastling and o'erstunk!)
.
Line 12 - thy flowery pleasance: Shakespeare is extremely sensitive
to vegetation: if anything delights him more than little birds
singing,
it is flowers and plant life. The Sonnets mention roses, violets,
lilies, marjoram, marigold, buds, blooms, sap, thorns, blooms, fruit,
olives, boughs, leaves, forests, apples, meadows, sheaves, cankers,
weeds. The words flower and pleasure appear in the Sonnets
about a dozen times each.
.
Lines 13-14 Such fruits, such flowerets . . . Were ne'er before:
Compare the syntax of 17: 'Such heavenly touches ne'er touched
earthly
faces.' Shakespeare often doubles such: 'Such wretched hands such
wretched blood should spill' (The Rape of Lucrece, 999); 'such
patchery, such juggling, and such knavery' (Troilus &amp; Cressida,
2,3,71);
'O, such another sleep, that I might see/But such another man!'
(Antony and Cleopatra, 5,2,77); 'Such seething brains,
Such shaping fantasies' (A Midsummer Night's Dream 5,1,4-5);
'such ferret and such fiery eyes' (Julius Caesar, 1,2,186).
.
Lines 13-14 - morality ... Italy: The rather lame rhyme of the final
couplet is not out of character for Shakespeare's sonnets, whose
endings
are often weak. And sometimes he is content with pairs of words that
end with -y, as in Sonnets 40 (poverty with injury) &amp; 55 (enmity with
posterity). And of course the poem's affection for things Italian
is typical of Shakespeare, a dozen of whose plays are set in Italy
and whose English characters are apt to quote Italian phrases.
.
The Phaeton sonnet should be studiously compared with Sonnets 1, 5,
11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 54, 68, 73, 97, 98, 102, and 103 for theme,
style,
sentiment, imagery, vocabulary, rhyme patterns, and other affinities.
Sonnets 97 and 98 are surely the work of the same hand that wrote
the Phaeton sonnet, which they echo in the words winter, pleasure,
bareness, summer's, increase, decease, fruit, birds, sing, spring,
sweet, flowers, shadow, and various synonyms and paraphrases.
.
If internal evidence alone can prove authorship, Shakespeare wrote
the Phaeton sonnet. It certainly deserves at least parenthetical
inclusion in the canon. Its early date certainly poses
a problem ' but only for those who assume that
'Shakespeare' must mean the Stratford man born in 1564.
.
If he was Edward de Vere, seventeenth Earl of Oxford, the problem
vanishes. Not only was Oxford 41 years old in 1591; he was a highly
esteemed poet, a patron of literature, and a member of both the
courtly
and the literary circles Florio moved in. Florio later referred to an
unnamed 'friend' of his as 'a gentleman' who 'loved better to be a
poet
than to be accounted one.' This could have meant any number of
gentlemen
(including noblemen) who deemed it beneath their dignity to publish
their writings; but it would fit Oxford with a peculiar aptness.
Being addressed to the poet's 'friend Florio,' the Phaeton
sonnet reminds one irresistibly of Francis Meres' reference
to Shakespeare's 'sugared sonnets among his private friends.'&gt;&gt;
