I got tired of dealing with TigerDirect. To their credit they always
gave me a no-hassle refund/exchange, even when I returned a vid card
that worked fine, but was too slow.

But I got tired of their pushing stuff on me, like anti-virus that was
'free' after rebate with an order - I already had an AV I'm satisfied
with (AVG). Or a 'bait and switch' when I wanted to order an nVidia
7600 video card and was talked into a Biostar 6100, because I was
&quot;paying for something my mobo didn't support&quot; (SLI), that I was aware
of. You should've seen this card. It had the biggest heat sink I've
ever seen (no fan) that protruded out at least an inch and nearly
covered the entire card. It blocked one of the PCI slots on my mobo
and the bozo knew what kind of MB I had. On top of that, he said it
came with &quot;free software that accelerated&quot; the card. It was just your
typical maintenance / diagnostics SW, most you can d/l free. Also the
last few packages came with the corners scrunched in - one so bad the
stuffing was falling out - due to poor packaging.

My last orders were from newegg. It was straight order the stuff and
get it, packaged well with no BS.

I can only give NewEgg very high marks.  I purchased a product from them,
which had a rebate.  I had difficulty finding out which number was the
serial number on the device to send for the rebate.  I even contacted the
manufacturer and read the number on the label that I thought was the serial
number and they told me it wasn't.  I contacted NewEgg about the problem
and they immediately just refunded my account the rebate amount.  I thought
that was EXCELLENT customer service!

Ok folks...now you did it!!!

While I was reading the news here...I was also working on a Publisher
document that really was too large to view properly on my tiny 15&quot;
monitor...
So I went to the Mwave website and found a 22&quot; LCD monitor for $250
including shipping!!!!

Yep...I ordered it at once!

Sheesh I can't believe I've been using this 15&quot; LCD...when I bought it may
years ago it was probably $400 or so !

If I was shopping for a LCD at a local store, I'd ask what resolution each
one I was interested in, was actually currently being displayed in. The
reason I might ask is that many stores send the same video signal to all the
monitors using one type or another of a video distribution device.

If they use something like that to send the same video to all the displays,
it's probably sending the same resolution to all the monitors.

Different monitors have different optimum resolutions that they are meant to
be run at.

If you're not viewing a LCD screen at the resolution it was designed for,
then you're not going to get an accurate view of it's capabilities. In other
words, If the monitor you're looking at was designed to run at 1280x1024 but
the stores video is sending 1024x768 video, the image and especially the
text will not be as sharp as it would be at it's native resolution.

Quite often 17&quot; LCD's want one resolution, 19&quot; or 20&quot; LCD's may want a
higher resolution. Wide-screen format LCD's will want a completely different
resolution.

I'd be sure to ask what resolution the LCD screen I was interested in was
running at and what it's native resolution was, just to be sure.

Tigerdirect used to have a very bad reputation. I think they have
improved things but I only buy from their retail store, and even then,
rarely.

Newegg is the premier choice. They also sometimes send out gifts (t-
shirts, license plates, and other doodads).

Zipzoomfly is cheap and dependable but be careful of their return
policies and if you do return something you have to follow instructions
to the letter or they will give you a hard time. Crappy website,
horrible search engine. Free 3 day shipping on everything.

Mwave, heard good things, I might have bought one or two things in the
past, but Newegg usually has a cheaper price and will probably beat
their price if you call and ask. I don't like their website but it's
better than Zipzoomfly.

Directron, never used them but they have a good rep.

I agree. I looked over a lot of LCDs until I found one I liked in my
price range: a 17&quot; Proview from Circuit City. Cost $249. I describe
the screen as 'pretty.' The colors are crisp and bright, but not
garish. Text is very readable (though what video card you have makes a
difference). I still play games on my 19&quot; KDS flat-screen.

My girlfriend is a heavy Photoshop user and has extraordinary color
vision...
If I was buying a monitor for her...she'd have to come to the store with me
and view them...
That's how we selected her last two monitors...

For me...up until now I've worked with 100% discarded items...so I'm quite
aware that a $250 monitor
is unlikely to be of the same quality as one costing a lot more... I simply
needed something larger so that I would not
have to continually scroll up and down when working on my document. If the
monitor I get is too good...
my girlfriend will commandeer it !!!!

Newegg.com (best search engine I've seen)

Buyer.com (great place to start with a part number)

ZipZoomFly.com (an old favorite with a poor search engine)

Buy.com (rarely, some items can be unusually low-priced, the free
shipping is slow)

And others that I am familiar with. Be wary of stores you haven't
ordered from or cannot find comments on USENET about. Rarely buy and
sell on eBay, don't use it for computer stuff.

Good luck and have fun.

John Doe is a professional User Group killer. His real name and
address was discovered by cross referencing his E-mail address of
several years ago (lshap ... @hotmail.com) with an online ad he placed
to sell a used computer.

An investigation paid for by me revealed Mark Bender to have been
arrested twice for domestic violence and to have had a major lawsuit
against him which causes him to live in an impoverished, crack ridden
neighborhood in San Antonion, TX.He is known by his neighbors as El
Gatero Loco, the crazy cat man (and not meant affectionately).

Below my name is the Investigative report on this malacious loser Mark
Bender.

Martin Markoe, eMicrophones, Inc
Serving the Speech Recognition community for 14 successful years

SUMMARY OF INVESTIGATION

Our office found Mr. Mark Bender's current address is 509 Frost, SATX
78201, to be owned by Ms. Gloria Trevino. There are many rental homes
in this area. Mr. Bender has never owned property. He does not own a
vehicle. He doesn't have a TX Driver's license. He does have a TX
State ID. He has been arrested twice for Assault/Family/Domestic
Violence. Both charges were dismissed. There is a possibility that the
&quot;Mark Bender&quot; named in the Bexar County Civil case for damages could
be the same Mark Orrin Bender with in this report. The court documents
would to be ordered at any additional cost to the client.

TigerDirect does not honor its rebates. They use a
rebate scam to trick you into a lower price, and then
they will never send it to you. Do not do business
with them.

All of the rebates I've used, from any source (including TigerDirect),
were from the manufacturer, not the retailer. Everyone I've done
properly, in the required time limits, has been honored. Retailers
rely on buyers not sending in the rebates, due to the several steps
that must be taken, lost receipts, etc.

Not everyone is that lucky. In my case, most notably a $20 rebate from
Zoom that was done properly in the required time limit but not
honored.

They rely on language on the rebate form that explicitly claims no
responsibility for lost mail, mishandling, whatever. It's a fool's
agreement IMO.

I think mail-in rebates are mainly used as a scam to prevent returns.
Since you have to remove the UPC symbol from the box, you can no
longer return the item after mailing for the rebate.

Whenever I see a mail-in rebate, nowadays, I immediately move on.
