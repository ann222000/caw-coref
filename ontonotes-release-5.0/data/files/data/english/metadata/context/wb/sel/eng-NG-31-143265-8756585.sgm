Ayala Land bullish on prospects despite US sub-prime woes

MANILA, Philippines -- Ayala land Inc., the Philippines' biggest real
estate developer, said it remains bullish on the prospects of the
local property sector despite prevailing worry over possible further
fallout from the US sub-prime mortgage crisis.

The optimism is due to its robust domestic sales and an expanding
market mostly made up of overseas Filipino workers, company officials
said.

&quot;Our operating results are on track and healthy (and) the market is
moving in our favor,&quot; Ayala Land president and chief executive Jaime
Ayala told stockholders' at a special meeting Tuesday.

He said the company is watching developments in the US sub-prime
sector to determine if this
would make a direct impact on sales to Filipinos working and residing
in the US.

&quot;We are closely watching it with respect to our OFW (overseas Filipino
workers) market. Some of our potential buyers may have existing
mortgages, but since these problems are quite recent, we haven't
assessed what it would mean for our future sales.&quot;

Filipinos working abroad send home at least $1.0 billion in
remittances every month. In the first half of this year, remittances
rose 18.1 percent from a year earlier to a record $7.0 billion.

While the US is a significant market for Ayala Land, chief finance
officer Jaime Ysmael said the company's residential projects are
expected to continue enjoying a high take-up rate despite the current
sub-prime problems in the US.

&quot;We have a highly diversified market not just in the US but also in
Europe and the Middle East. Besides, US sales are focused on the
upscale market,&quot; said Ysmael.

&quot;If the US problem drags on, we can still count on our growing
overseas markets elsewhere.&quot;
In the near-term, Filipinos living and working in the US will likely
wait for the sub-prime turmoil to subside before making firm
investments in the Philippine property sector, said Delfin Lazaro,
Ayala board director and chief finance officer of parent company Ayala
Corp.

&quot;Because of the ongoing uncertainty, there may be a little bit of
reluctance among Filipinos in the US to make big commitments. We can
expect a period when people will be more cautious and (would rather)
wait to see how the situation will play out before they make a
judgment call,&quot; said Lazaro.

In recent years, Ayala Land's offshore sales, mostly to OFWs,
accounted for 37 percent of its residential sales.

Its ongoing construction of new high-end residential projects and the
expansion of mall and office spaces has also generated strong foreign
investor interest.

This has prompted Ayala Land to set a stock rights offer of 13 billion
preferred shares from September 10-14.

Ayala Land has yet to set the offer price.

The preferred shares will be non-voting, non-cumulative and will not
be listed on the stock exchange.

&quot;The preferred share offering will address the foreign ownership limit
of 40 percent since we are already nearing that cap,&quot; said Ayala Land
chairman Fernando Zobel de Ayala.

&quot;This is an accepted mechanism to address the issue. Foreign investors
should be able to freely and actively trade, and move in and out in a
very large way, otherwise they will lose interest in the stock,&quot; Zobel
de Ayala said.

He said the preferred share offering has been getting &quot;fairly positive
feedback&quot; from foreign institutional investors, without elaborating.
