Turkish authorities have linked one of the suspects in the Zotob worm
case to individuals thought to be part of a credit card fraud ring,
according to the FBI.

Atilla Ekici, a 21-year-old Turk who used the nickname &quot;Coder,&quot; may be
affiliated with people thought to be part of a credit card fraud ring
in Turkey, an FBI representative said on Tuesday. Ekici was one of two
men arrested last week for allegedly unleashing several computer worms,
including the Zotob worm that disrupted businesses worldwide two weeks
ago.

Turkish authorities have identified about a dozen individuals thought
to be involved in credit card fraud. &quot;It is believed that these
individuals have links to Coder,&quot; the FBI representative said. &quot;The
investigation is still ongoing, but there is no indication these people
actually wrote or distributed the Zotob worm.&quot;

Zotob attacked computers running Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating
system. The worm and its offshoots hit PCs and servers worldwide two
weeks ago, including machines at ABC, CNN and Daimler Chrysler.

Ekici along with Farid Essebar, an 18-year-old Moroccan national born
in Russia, are believed to be responsible for Zotob and the earlier
Mytob and Rbot worms. Essebar was arrested in Morocco on Thursday of
last week, the same day authorities nabbed Ekici.

The suspected link to a credit card fraud ring expands the possible
financial motivation for the Zotob and Mytob worm attacks. The FBI last
week said that it believes Essebar wrote both worms and then sold them
to Ekici.

Previous Next Both Mytob and Zotob attack Windows computers and feature
backdoor capabilities. Criminals could use this backdoor to install
software that spies on users or to install &quot;bot&quot; programs that create
&quot;botnets,&quot; networks of hijacked PCs that are rented out to relay spam
or attack other systems.

Meanwhile, experts at antivirus company Sophos say they believe Essebar
may have had a hand in more than 20 computer pests. The teen's handle,
&quot;Diabl0,&quot; appears in more than 20 other viruses and worms, including
Mydoom-BG and many versions of Mytob, which are currently dominating
worldwide virus reports, according to Sophos.

Zotob and its variants exploited a security hole in the plug-and-play
feature in the OS, for which Microsoft provided a fix earlier this
month. Zotob included some of the code used in Mytob, an e-mail worm
that first started spreading in March. To date, more than 100 variants
of Mytob have been spotted. The worm is distributed via mass e-mail
campaigns.

The investigation into the Mytob and Zotob worms is ongoing and other
suspects may be arrested, according to the FBI.
