This policeman was taken off public duties; his chief constable made a
robust defense of his actions, claiming that he himself had suffered
facial injury from someone "much smaller" than himself once; the
matter is under investigation by the Police Complaints Authority.

Speaking of equality, if this would have happened to a white male we
would never have read it in the headlines.  The only reason is made it
into the newspaper is because she was female and she was black.
Doesn't sound very equal to me.

Really don't want to get knotted up in this white vs black (or vice
versa) issue. If that question is not obvious, it never will be.

The thread title speaks for itself, at least i'm hoping so. As
improbable as it might be, let's assume for a moment the victim was a
white female. Any clearer...?

Well paradox, it only becomes clearer if your willing to concede that
there shouldn't be equality between men and women.  If it would have
been just as wrong for him to hit a man as it would be for him to hit
a woman then we can say men and women are equal.  But what your
article seems to imply is that it was wrong for a man to hit a woman,
more so than it would have been for him to hit a man.  So there is a
distinction there between men and women.  What is the distinction?  Is
it that men are physically stronger than women and so he should have
been able to handle her without hitting her?  Or is it something
else?  I guarantee you that this happens on a daily basis where a
police officer has to hit a man to subdue him in order get cuffs on
him.  Why doesn't that show up in the paper?

KC, it's simple.

One either believes that the sexes are equal in all respects, in which
case this morally repugnant exercise is "permissible" and to be
applied without gender distinction. Or one believes that the sexes are
unique, expressed through various gender specific characteristics, yet
of equal worth and esteem; in which case due regard for "difference"
is not only practical and "safe", it is a moral imperative. In fact,
there is some evidence to suggest that this distinction of gender
characteristics is "hard wired" not just in humans but also in lower
order species.

This dimunitive lady was pinned down securely by no less than 2 full
bodied policemen prior to the outrageous physical abuse. Something has
clearly gone terribly wrong here to override this innate "instinct".

What i find intriguing is either the persecution paranoia or the
wilfull moral corruption, or the blythe ignorance of leadership, which
defends and encourages this human ugliness in conspecifics without the
capacity for intellectual distinction.

Paradox,
I'm actually pleased with your response.  In today's society though
your position is an unpopular position to take.  My response to your
post was partly egged on by a book I'm currently reading called "Who
Stole Feminism" by Christina Hoff Sommers.  She is a feminist, but
she's an anti Gender Feminist.  She makes a distinction between old
school Equity Feminism and the newer movement of gender feminism.
Equity feminism seeks equal treatment under the law for both men and
women.  Gender feminism on the other hand wants to wage war against
all men.  They see men as the enemy and women as the victim in every
possible senario.

Your response was good because it pointed out that the two genders
have different characteristics.  That's why I and most men grew up
with their mamas telling them never to hit a woman, to show kindness
and respect to women, etc.  Women are typically physically weaker then
men and we as a society cannot put up with the stronger gender hitting
and abusing the weaker.

But why do we immediately attribute such stories as the one in your
original post to sexism?  Do we really know whether this guy was
sexist or not?  Maybe he's a product of our current society where we
don't want men to look at women and see a women.  We want him to blind
him to the difference between the two genders.  Maybe he hit men all
the time and this time it just happened to be a woman.  Maybe he's not
in the least sexist, just plain violent.  The gender feminists though
want you to see a sexist act, and this is how the media will play it
up everytime.

Now that we've heard all the standard responses about inequality and
racism, let's deal with the facts, shall we?

http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/page/0,,2028548,00.html

She's extremely aggressive, attempts to break away multiple times, and
in the action which culminated in her being struck, flexed so hard
that she knocked both herself and the arresting officer down the
stairs.

I'm quick to decry abuse of government power, but I'm quicker to call
bullshit on those who use race and gender as a defense against the
consequences of their own actions. Inequity and inequality has truly
existed, and truly hurt and killed. For lowlife scum to attempt to use
these things as a reason for their treatment is sickening.

What makes it worse is that Toni Comer has said that she believes she
had an epileptic fit which resulted in her resisting arrest. Watch the
video. Anyone who has ever seen an epileptic fit, or knows someone
with epilepsy, will be appalled.

I think they should hit her again for lying and misrepresenting the
situation, and muddying the waters of true inequities.

KC, you make some interesting points.

I dont actually think the poor policeman can tell the difference
between the sexes (so he couldn't really honestly be accused of
sexism); that's my point. Some personal history or pathology has
clearly short-circuited his capacity for discrimination. He is not
particularly interesting; a cause for concern to those near and dear
to him perhaps.

What is interesting, as i indicated, is the organisation that cannot
comprehend the difference between cultural cohesion and moral
corruption.

Your views are well articulated, DCJ; and noted.

Would you hit her again, if you had the opportunity, to make assurance
doubly sure the lady never "lied and misrepresented" in the future?

To clarify, the second hit was figurative, although I would absolutely
support negative legal repercussions, on par with perjury, for the use
of this kind of defense when there is overwhelming evidence to the
contrary.

To cut to the quick, do you believe the exercise of statutory

I'm my own special blend of Libertarian, with a heavy emphasis on
personal accountability.

I believe the exercise of statutority authority was legally justified
in this case. I do not think any act of violence is morally
commendable...merely necessary.

The term "lowlife scum" is rooted in Nazi ideology. What you mean is
probably some sort of projection problem you are working on. But feel

I couldn't get the video to play, so I refrain from any direct comment
on "this particular situation" (and even if I did get the video to
play, I still wouldn't know what was in the minds of the "combatants"
as they did whatever it is they did).

For whatever it's worth, DCJ, I am in complete philosophical agreement
with your apparent take on responsibility

Oh lord...and thus, the thread is killed as someone brings in the
inimitable Nazi reference.

First, Donnadonne, lowlife is a word invented in the 1700's which
basically means criminal.

http://www.allwords.com/word-low-life.html

Secondly, your baseless assumption that I am projecting, as opposed to
simply voicing my opinion on a topic I am very familiar with,
illustrates that you are not actually reasonably analyzing my posts,
but simply firing passive ad hominems. This immediately devalues
anything you have to say.

Third, your attempt at patronization in the close of your statement
clearly displays your ignorance of the group in general, considering I
am one of the more veteran members here, and a list moderator.

So, if you would like to discuss the socioeconomic factors which help
create inequities, than feel free to do so. If you want to instead act
like a smart ass child attempting to be witty and clever among adults,
then expect to be treated as such.

&gt; &gt; She's extremely aggressive, attempts to break away multiple times, and

&gt; &gt; I'm quick to decry abuse of government power, but I'm quicker to call
&gt; &gt; bullshit on those who use race and gender as a defense against the

&gt; &gt; these things as a reason for their treatment is sickening.

&gt; &gt; What makes it worse is that Toni Comer has said that she believes she
&gt; &gt; had an epileptic fit which resulted in her resisting arrest. Watch the

&gt; &gt; I think they should hit her again for lying and misrepresenting the

I like your sig there, Kev.

I believe there are two realms of responsibility: personal, and social.

Individually, we are responsible for our own choices, decisions, and
consequences.
Socially, we have a responsibility to try to rectify failures in our
social system which cause inequities, because those inequities make it
more likely that individuals will make poor choices, which further
denigrate society.

IMHO, of course...

Hey All,

I am new to this forum and thus far find it completely fascinating.
This particular issue is one that goes far beyond gender equality, I
feel, and presses into the equality of individuals, which will never
occur. It is unfortunate that people divide everything down easily
viewable lines of divisions using gender, race, etc. However do not
take into account many other things that create an individual. Some
the factors would obviously include; education, income, upbringing,
religion, a host of other factors, and the prevalence of instinct
within these individuals. An officers position is very difficult in
that they must constantly battle within themselves between instinct
and logic. The fight or flight response that is instinctual and
triggered within all of us must be overcome so as to allow arresting
officers to subdue and bring into custody, with minimal force, any
suspect.

For myself, when dealing with extreme circumstances, I do not consider
any factors except how a particular individual can negatively affect
me. If I am dealing with a violent individual, man or woman, and they
seemingly have considerable more power than I, then I will resort to
cunning or escapist tactics. However if they are seemingly weaker than
I, then perhaps I can remain and attempt to cool the situation by
restraining the individual.

I for one do not believe in equality, in the general sense, because I
believe in the individual, however I do believe in the equality of
law, where all people are created equal to the blind eyes of lady
justice.

Sorry if I strayed and rambled a bit, my responses will become more
coherent once I learn the dynamics of this group.

Have a good one,
Brandon

The point is, DCJ, that statutory authority confers upon the subject
the permission to employ reasonable force in maintaining public order,
not violence. Under these special circumstances, moral authority is
exercised in restraint. Of course, this may all be academic

Damn I hate not having weekend 'net access, still catching up time, I
have a bit to say here so bear with me.

A few years ago now we had a report that suggested the police force in
this country(UK) was 'Institutionaly racist' now I meantion this for
one perpose only, that being to highlight the fact that police forces
inherently have to labour under some form of mistrust of the public,
and so their tatics for dealing with us are offten times seen as too
harsh, this I think is quite normal for those who's duty it is to
uphold the law, and I personaly see much evidance that the police are
trying to overcome the negativeity of this report.

Now It is true that I am no fan of the police, and when I first saw
this video I was outraged.  Consequently after following the story,
reading the many, many charector witness that apperad for this police
man, and having re-watched the video, I find myself sideing with the
copper in question and the police force.

When I first viewd the film, I thought okay she looks preety much
subdude now, there really was no need to punch her on the arm like
that; I put it down to typical police bullying tatics.  After repeated
viewing you can actulay see her still resiting arest and while her
legs an torso are pinned, her arm are still flailing.

According to the copper in question, he said that he punched her 5
times on the arm in order to deaden it, so that they could bend it and
get the cuffs on, any body that has been on the reciving end of a dead
arm must be able to see the sense in this action.

Sexual equality,  a few things strike me about this episode.  The
women certianly did not get treated any differant from a man resisting
arrest and so I can see no cause for complaint there.  The question of
wether or not the same level of violence should be meted out to male
and female alike in these types of circumstances I am very clear on.

Male and female are not the same, and whilst I think equality of the
sexes is very comendable, we cannot be treated the same in all things.

I was taught as DC was, so it seems that a man should not hit a woman,
and it is still a thought that holds a high place in my pysche.
Having said that if I am attacked by a woman, I will defend myself,
and I have instructed my sons in the same mannor.

In a similar vein, on the odd occasion that I find myself out shopping
with my wife, I will carry the bags, open doors, and let her take the
seat on the bus.

Heh perhaps I am guilty of sexism, but I do these things both out of
respect and because she, a female is physicaly weaker than me.

On the other hand, don't expect to see me crying on the shoulder of
one of my mates when we are out have a beer or two, or shopping for
yet another pair of shoes or a handbag.  There are definate
differances between the sexes, yes of course we should all be paid the
same for doing the same job, and yes of course we should all be given
the same chances in life, but treated the same in all things?  Nooooo
not on my watch.

Very much so. Your reaction is to a described injustice, not to what
actually occurred. If what you describe had happened, I would feel the
same. However, this is one more incident where  media team creates an
event that plays on the emotions (while leaving out inconvenient
facts), and otherwise intelligent people respond as expected without
verifying the situation.

As I respect the intelligence and perception you have shown in other
threads, I'd like to wait until you have had a chance to watch the
video before we continue, so that you have an accurate picture of what
really happened. This is not an interpolative scenario designed to
make reflections about society at large. This is merely whether or not
you think an individual acted appropriately under the circumstances.

&gt; &gt; one of my mates when we are out have a beer or two, or shopping for
&gt; &gt; yet another pair of shoes or a handbag.  There are definate

I totally object to your assertion that i'm being dumb!!! I strongly
protest!!!....;))

I dont think you're claiming that the video clip shown on terrestrial
television was "doctored" ("what i saw did not happen"), but that the
editing may offer a broader context to the thing ("i may feel
differently about what i saw"). I accept the possibility, and will see
the video at my earliest opportunity.

&gt; Very much so. Your reaction is to a described injustice, not to what
&gt; actually occurred. If what you describe had happened, I would feel the
&gt; same. However, this is one more incident where  media team creates an
&gt; event that plays on the emotions (while leaving out inconvenient
&gt; facts), and otherwise intelligent people respond as expected without
&gt; verifying the situation.

&gt; As I respect the intelligence and perception you have shown in other

&gt; Lee, it always amazes me how many ways we can find to keep our eyes

Hey Paradox,

If it was exactly the same perhaps.  But I am not a police man, I do
not have the required mentality to be one, I would not like to be one,
I have great issues with them.

If you are asking though do I think the man in question was justified
in his actions, then yes I do.

As DC says, watch the video, the woman was resiting arrest, she did
kick him in the nuts, she was still resiting even whilst her legs and
torso were restrained, in addition she was drunk, had just commited a
criminal offense for which she was being arrested, and says that she
can actually remember very little of the whole affair.
I have seen pictures of her after she was released, she did not even
have a bruise on her arm.

When the whole thing goes to court and everthing comes to light, I
have no hesitation in the police man being exonerated, and the woman
reciving a hefty fine.

I've stayed out of this, mostly because Chris already said exactly what I
wanted to say.

Watch the video. Read the background on who this person was and what led up
to her resisting the arrest. I've not read the Guardian story, but on BBC
News she was quoted as saying that she was so drunk she could not even
remember being punched in the arm. It was only after watching the video back
that she knew.

The job of the police is becoming impossible without trying to make this
story -- and others like it where it suits the polemic of the day -- into
something it wasn't.

Hey, if it was America they'd probably have just shot her! She should count
herself lucky! :P

DCJ, i've had the opportunity now to see the videotape via your link;
i'm pretty sure i missed something though. My original questions (with
a minor revision), if you wish to respond:

Please explain why it was legally justified to punch a woman of
dimunitive stature 5 times, with the greatest physical effort
possible, whilst she was pinned down by 2 [correction: 4] policemen,
and clearly
immobile.

Stauthority confers upon the subject the permission to employ
reasonable force in maintaining public order, not violence. Under
these special circumstances, moral authority is exercised in
restraint. Of course, this may all be academic
gobbledegook to the poor policeman with psychological baggage, i
know.
The question is whether it ought to be, and who is to be held
accountable for the absence of moral authority.

Paradox, the flaw with your question is in stating she was clearly
immobile. Nowhere in there, until they dragged her off was she clearly
immobile. She fought hard enough to knock the officers down the
stairs. She kicked and hit them multiple times. Even when pinned down,
you can still see her feet flailing, and the attempt to move her arms.
It was necessary, and legally justified, in order to place the legally
proscribed restraints on her, due to the resistance she was providing.

The evidence is in the movie. If you don't see it, then no amount of
sociological bantering will convince you otherwise.

KC, i am now convinced that it was legally justified to punch a woman
of
dimunitive stature 5 times, with the greatest physical effort
possible, whilst she was pinned down by 4 policemen, and clearly
mobile.

I am equally convinced that no one need be held accountable for the
absence of moral authority in this case, as no such moral mandate
applies to the actions of the agents involved, thus no agent nor
authority may be held accountabe.

It's quite a personal enlightenment, actually; and for that, i am
obliged.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe the exercise of statutority authority was legally justified

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The point is, DCJ, that statutory authority confers upon the subject

Oh hideous hypocrites ... no man alive can kill the thread that has
been spun.

It doesn't surprise me that you naturally assume that I have come
unprepared. I'm fully aware though that donnadonne can be erased at
any moment without notice and without being noticed.

Let's go through your findings first, if you don't mind.

The linked source that you suggest defines "common, vulgar,
disreputable" as the basic meaning of the word "low-life". The basic
meaning is not defined as "criminal". You misread. The criminal aspect
of the meaning can be attained in and through its plural form. As its
second meaning. As a result, you might say. Still that word alone
didn't bother me more than many other politically incorrect words.

And now let me show you what I found for "scum":

http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=scum&amp;searchmode=none

The main emphasis that your verbal exchange centers around here is the
woman's reputation. In that sense it was first recorded in 1932. Thus
the Nazi reference.

Unholy combinations.

&gt; First, Donnadonne, lowlife is a word invented in the 1700's which

From your link:

1326 (implied in scummer "shallow ladle for removing scum"), from
M.Du. schume "foam, froth," from P.Gmc. *skuma- (cf. O.N. skum, O.H.G.
scum, Ger. Schaum "foam, froth"), perhaps from PIE base *(s)keu- "to
cover, conceal" (see hide (n.1)). Sense deteriorated from "thin layer
atop liquid" to "film of dirt," then just "dirt." Meaning "lowest
class of humanity" is 1586; scum of the Earth is from 1712. Adopted in
Romanic, cf. O.Fr. escume, Mod.Fr. écume, Sp. escuma, It. schiuma.
Adj. scummy first attested 1577; transf. sense of "filthy,
disreputable" is recorded from 1932. Slang scumbag "condom" is from
1967; meaning "despicable person" is from 1971.

It gives a much older meaning, and it does not reference Nazis. The
Nazi party is not even considered to have begun until 1933.

Do you have a point?

Hi Brandon;

Let me help you out with a little of the dynamics; group is
moderated, which translates to "civil" {for the most part} and
**nowhere** near as hostile as some of the usenet newsgroups in
Google. I'm relatively new myself, although I found this forum in
2005, I drifted over to alt.philosophy and just came back here a
couple of months ago. The level of activity is good for me; you'll
have to decide if it's enough for you...

As for the topic; you said:
&lt;quote&gt;
I for one do not believe in equality, in the general sense, because I
believe in the individual, however I do believe in the equality of
law, where all people are created equal to the blind eyes of lady
justice.
&lt;end quote&gt;

Sounded good to me....

Craig;

You're correct; not only that it **wasn't** directed at you; it
wasn't directed at **anyone**.

You're also correct with this: "...by asserting a proposition it is
implicit that it is your opinion unless you otherwise say so." I know
that and you know that, but over in the hostile forum they don't seem
to retain the concept that **everything** that can be discussed in
philosophy is **someone's opinion**. If the answer was **factually**
known, there's no philosophical discussion to have {at least my best
philosophy professor said so, and I agree, IMHO [couldn't resist]}.

I agree it should be the understood "default value" in any
philosophy forum, unfortunately, that hasn't been my experience. Good
to know it's understood in this one!!

Now about that Aristotle guy........

Yeah I'm finally starting to feel better.  I'm almost ready to dig

&gt; philosophy professor said so, and I agree, IMHO [couldn't resist]}.

&gt;   I agree it should be the understood &quot;default value&quot; in any
&gt; philosophy forum, unfortunately, that hasn't been my experience. Good
&gt; to know it's understood in this one!!

&gt; Now about that Aristotle guy........

I'm sorry but what you are saying is ridiculous. I hope you don't
seriously suggest that all people in whole wide world were good until
1933 the Nazi party came into power in Germany.
I was talking about language and its mirroring function of
sociohistorical processes.

But if you're into points, here is one you might like:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; From your link:

&gt; 1326 (implied in scummer &quot;shallow ladle for removing scum&quot;), from
&gt; M.Du. schume &quot;foam, froth,&quot; from P.Gmc. *skuma- (cf. O.N. skum, O.H.G.
&gt; scum, Ger. Schaum &quot;foam, froth&quot;), perhaps from PIE base *(s)keu- &quot;to
&gt; cover, conceal&quot; (see hide (n.1)). Sense deteriorated from &quot;thin layer
&gt; atop liquid&quot; to &quot;film of dirt,&quot; then just &quot;dirt.&quot; Meaning &quot;lowest
&gt; class of humanity&quot; is 1586; scum of the Earth is from 1712. Adopted in
&gt; Romanic, cf. O.Fr. escume, Mod.Fr. écume, Sp. escuma, It. schiuma.
&gt; Adj. scummy first attested 1577; transf. sense of &quot;filthy,
&gt; disreputable&quot; is recorded from 1932. Slang scumbag &quot;condom&quot; is from
&gt; 1967; meaning &quot;despicable person&quot; is from 1971.

&gt; It gives a much older meaning, and it does not reference Nazis. The
&gt; Nazi party is not even considered to have begun until 1933.

&gt; Do you have a point?

&gt; &gt; Oh hideous hypocrites ... no man alive can kill the thread that has

&gt; &gt; It doesn't surprise me that you naturally assume that I have come
&gt; &gt; unprepared. I'm fully aware though that donnadonne can be erased at
&gt; &gt; any moment without notice and without being noticed.

&gt; &gt; Let's go through your findings first, if you don't mind.

&gt; &gt; The linked source that you suggest defines &quot;common, vulgar,
&gt; &gt; disreputable&quot; as the basic meaning of the word &quot;low-life&quot;. The basic
&gt; &gt; meaning is not defined as &quot;criminal&quot;. You misread. The criminal aspect
&gt; &gt; of the meaning can be attained in and through its plural form. As its
&gt; &gt; second meaning. As a result, you might say. Still that word alone
&gt; &gt; didn't bother me more than many other politically incorrect words.

&gt; &gt; And now let me show you what I found for &quot;scum&quot;:

&gt; &gt; http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=scum&amp;searchmode=none

&gt; &gt; The main emphasis that your verbal exchange centers around here is the
&gt; &gt; woman's reputation. In that sense it was first recorded in 1932. Thus
&gt; &gt; the Nazi reference.

&gt; &gt; Unholy combinations.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh lord...and thus, the thread is killed as someone brings in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; inimitable Nazi reference.

&gt; &gt; &gt; First, Donnadonne, lowlife is a word invented in the 1700's which
&gt; &gt; &gt; basically means criminal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.allwords.com/word-low-life.html

&gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, your baseless assumption that I am projecting, as opposed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; simply voicing my opinion on a topic I am very familiar with,
&gt; &gt; &gt; illustrates that you are not actually reasonably analyzing my posts,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but simply firing passive ad hominems. This immediately devalues
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything you have to say.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Third, your attempt at patronization in the close of your statement
&gt; &gt; &gt; clearly displays your ignorance of the group in general, considering I
&gt; &gt; &gt; am one of the more veteran members here, and a list moderator.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, if you would like to discuss the socioeconomic factors which help
&gt; &gt; &gt; create inequities, than feel free to do so. If you want to instead act
&gt; &gt; &gt; like a smart ass child attempting to be witty and clever among adults,
&gt; &gt; &gt; then expect to be treated as such.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The term &quot;lowlife scum&quot; is rooted in Nazi ideology. What you mean is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably some sort of projection problem you are working on. But feel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; free to say whatever is on your mind in your own words here in this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; group. You are amongst friends. What other facts would you like us to

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She's extremely aggressive, attempts to break away multiple times, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the action which culminated in her being struck, flexed so hard
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that she knocked both herself and the arresting officer down the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stairs.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm quick to decry abuse of government power, but I'm quicker to call
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bullshit on those who use race and gender as a defense against the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consequences of their own actions. Inequity and inequality has truly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; existed, and truly hurt and killed. For lowlife scum to attempt to use
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these things as a reason for their treatment is sickening.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What makes it worse is that Toni Comer has said that she believes she
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had an epileptic fit which resulted in her resisting arrest. Watch the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; video. Anyone who has ever seen an epileptic fit, or knows someone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with epilepsy, will be appalled.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think they should hit her again for lying and misrepresenting the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation, and muddying the waters of true inequities.
