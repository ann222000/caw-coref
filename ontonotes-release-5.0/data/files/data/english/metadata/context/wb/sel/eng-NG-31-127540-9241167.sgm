Rudd sweeps to power in Australian
election&lt; http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data/theworld... &gt;
:

SYDNEY - Australia's centre-left opposition leader Kevin Rudd swept into
power in a landslide election victory, ending conservative Prime Minister
John Howard''s 11-year rule.

Howard, US President George W. Bush's closest ally in the Iraq war, conceded
defeat in Sydney, wishing Rudd well and telling him that he was inheriting
an economy that is the envy of the world.

'A few minutes ago I telephoned Mr Rudd and I congratulated him and the
Australian Labor Party on a very emphatic victory,' Howard told emotional
supporters in a gracious concession speech at a Sydney hotel.

Congrats Labor party!
