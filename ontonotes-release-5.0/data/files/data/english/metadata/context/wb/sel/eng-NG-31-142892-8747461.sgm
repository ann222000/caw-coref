They call themselves Voltec, because they like to eat magic mushrooms
in florda &amp; think about Toltec wisdom.  They are just stealing peoples
credid cards, and trying to figure out how to get into computer crime
online.  If they hadn't called me up and claimed to be a buisness in
Florida to tell me fradulent charges were being made with my card I
would have got a big fat bill.  I guess  they are down with native
culture, but they are all satanists.  I met another native american
guy who had a similar thing going, where he would stalk people down,
and clip them with a close-pin that linked them up to his website.
People can just make up little cult groups online, and go around being
posers.  It's gay.  Next week they will be the Order Of The Pheonix &amp;
reading harry potter books.

I just wonder if this is connected to my ex-girlfriend, because
apparently she ran away to florida with some kid after she stole my
cell phone.  I thought she was the one who made the charges on my card
but I'm not so sure anymore.  The kids mom called me up after I got a
new phone, because he was calling her on it.  Apparently she hasn't
heard from him in 2 months, and she is woried sick.  Creepy shit.
Watch out for this kind of stuff.

Aha!  Some crazy drifter living in Y.S. with another drifter named
&quot;Scooby&quot; who has moved into the area is the one doing it.  I can tell
because he told me he was from Atlanta, and was trying to hitch a ride
to a train station.  Except when he described the Atlanta area, all he
talked about was a big lake, and an area that turned into a wildlife
preserve, like a ZOO.  That fits the description perfectly for this
Voltexx company.  He was giving me the evil eye too.

I figured out how they are doing it.  They come up north because it is
too hot down south, and they live in vacant buildings.  I've always
noticed a vacant building for years off the street I live on, and
another one around the corner.  Apparently these doods are just
squating in the building, and getting people to come stay with them,
then taking their wallets in their sleep.  Probably going around
checking mail boxes too, and going into peoples homes like mine to do
a little breaking and entering.  The scam is called the &quot;Scooby
Shack&quot;.  Other doods are doing it, i've researched it a bit.

If the doctors do have an opinion, please let me know too, Corey. As I
recall, you took the Avatar course twelve years ago in the hope that
it would fix the damage done by your dad's stroke, right? But it
didn't.

This course was sold by someone supposedly trained and licensed by a
health care professional who was a fraud, I believe. Right?

I'd like to know what the doctors think about that, and it might be to

I'm not talking to my doctors about this.  I'm talking to the police.
The trouble is I don't have anyway to prove Scooby lives in a vacant
house, and the cops just said they would swing by and check it out.
Apparently if a house has been vacant for a number of years, all you
have to do is start squatting in the site for a few months or so &amp; if
no one shows up to claim ownership you can just move in rent free.
The police didn't even really believe me when I told them he was
living in a vacant house with other criminals, even though everybody
knows he is.

Hmm, I stalked down the owner of the building, called her up &amp; it
turns out scooby is &quot;paying rent&quot;.  So there isn't much I can do.  Its
a shame, because he has all of these vagrants living with him &amp; he was
staying in the woods for awhile.  The rumor was he was living in a
vacant appartment.  At least I filed some complaints about it with
them.

A Voltec sorcerer is a breaker of boundaries; a black magician who has
reached an energetic and developmental threshold. We are the holders
of an ancient configuration, keepers of a monumental edifice erected
thousands of years past by masters of the force of intent. They are
still there, some of them, buried deep beneath the deserts of the
American South West and Mexico. They continue to dream and they are
still aware. That very same force that drove these men and women of
antiquity to break the boundaries of the human condition has coursed
through the centuries, being shaped anew by those who have had the
potential to express its abstract commands best. The core teachings of
our sorcery have always been the same, but with each new cycle came
new realizations. What we Westerners have come to call the left hand
path, has been redefined and invigorated by our experiences and silent
knowledge. The Order of the Voltec creates within its many faceted
chambers, a place and perceptual context for black magicians of the
highest caliber. The traditional and primary goals of the left hand
path have been distilled through our own brand of shadow alchemy, and
we have worked hard for years to draw and purify only the most
essential ideas and techniques from shamanic magics around the earth,
particularly that of the Toltecs. At our very core, we still retain
that definitive expectation of what the left hand path really is. It
is the never ending quest of the sorcerer to free themselves of human
limitations, fortifying themselves against the universal tides of
entropy and thus achieving a state of existence which in no way
resembles that of the ordinary modern human. The strengthening of our
consciousness and the retention of our individuality past the point of
physical death are the inevitable results of our combined efforts.
Fear is a Voltec sorcerer's ally and death walks next to each one of
our kind. We are born onto the nightside, and thus begin our
apprenticeship. We knowingly leave the comforts of the world and look
out into the night; the face of the unknown. For the Voltec sorcerer,
power is earned through action and our words weave the reality of the
world around us. If you belong here, you will know. So will we.

Hmm

i call that growing up - in the so called mundane sense

to go back to the previous statement

i understand making fear an ally
and
I think i get &quot;born into the nightside&quot; and facing the unknown

Examine your feelings.  Do you feel threatened by my words?  Is that why you
see them as &quot;hostile&quot;?

I offered a challenge to you to support your claims with evidence or be held
in contempt as an empty braggart and a pompous fool. You have utterly failed
to provide even a shred of support for your self-aggrandizing claims.
Instead you merely complain about how &quot;bitter&quot; and &quot;hostile&quot; you think I am,
since I express the contempt you've earned by your incompetence.  Apparently
you feel that your best hope is to try to avoid having to back up your
claims with evidence is by changing the subject.

Even if I were &quot;bitter&quot; and &quot;hostile&quot;, what difference does that make?  You
still haven't backed up your claims about &quot;monumental edifices&quot; buried deep
in the Southwest deserts, of which you and your other &quot;black magicians&quot; are
the &quot;keepers&quot;.  You sound like a third-rate fantasy novelist, not somebody
who actually understands anything at all about magick.

Now stop bragging and stop whining.  If you really have anything to say
other than how mysterious and powerful you and your little friends want
people to think you are, let's hear it.

It's a sure sign of a poster's frantic defensiveness when they have to
respond to the same message three separate times only to add yet another
lame attempt at a clever comeback.  I had hoped that at least one of your
three responses would actually address the questions I had about your
claims, but that hope was forlorn.  They were all just weak and futile
efforts to make yourself feel better after having been humiliated in public.
I can tell they're futile because you had to try the same thing three times,
which suggests that the first two didn't make you feel any better.  How did
the last one feel?  Better yet?

I invite you to discuss magick as a study and practice, if you actually know
enough about it to do so competently.  This total crap about woo-woo black
magicians and secret buried monuments is boring and pointless posturing.

Drugs are fine if you like them. Wow, you are a good writer. I just
came on this pathetic group because I have a lot of time to kill at
work right now, but enough of silly stuff. I will not be back on here.

&gt;&gt; &gt; And drugs.

&gt;&gt; Mostly drugs, I'll wager.

&gt; Drugs are fine if you like them.

&gt; A Voltec sorcerer is a breaker of boundaries; a black magician who has

&gt; of an ancient configuration, keepers of a monumental edifice erected
&gt; thousands of years past by masters of the force of intent. They are
&gt; still there, some of them, buried deep beneath the deserts of the
&gt; American South West and Mexico. They continue to dream and they are
&gt; still aware. That very same force that drove these men and women of
&gt; antiquity to break the boundaries of the human condition has coursed
&gt; through the centuries, being shaped anew by those who have had the
&gt; potential to express its abstract commands best. The core teachings of
&gt; our sorcery have always been the same, but with each new cycle came
&gt; new realizations. What we Westerners have come to call the left hand
&gt; path, has been redefined and invigorated by our experiences and silent
&gt; knowledge. The Order of the Voltec creates within its many faceted
&gt; chambers, a place and perceptual context for black magicians of the
&gt; highest caliber. The traditional and primary goals of the left hand
&gt; path have been distilled through our own brand of shadow alchemy, and
&gt; we have worked hard for years to draw and purify only the most
&gt; essential ideas and techniques from shamanic magics around the earth,
&gt; particularly that of the Toltecs. At our very core, we still retain
&gt; that definitive expectation of what the left hand path really is. It
&gt; is the never ending quest of the sorcerer to free themselves of human
&gt; limitations, fortifying themselves against the universal tides of
&gt; entropy and thus achieving a state of existence which in no way

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; apprenticeship. We knowingly leave the comforts of the world and look
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; out into the night; the face of the unknown. For theVoltecsorcerer,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; power is earned through action and our words weave the reality of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; world around us. If you belong here, you will know. So will we.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Eric, is that you?

Lud, did you know I  have a copy of the selling of those souls? Want I
should find more? How much does a purveyor pay for them?
