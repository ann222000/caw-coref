I posted the following in rec.radio.shortwave a few days ago:

I recently plunked down $650 to be able to get HDTV. That includes
$290 Polaroid 19&quot; LCD HDTV, $180 Samsung HDTV set top box, $70 for an
HDTV indoor antenna, and a whopping $65 for a special cable called an
HDMI cable (in addition to tax). I watched some OTA HDTV tonight, and
was disappointed. Many programs are not yet in full HDTV, including
ABC World News. This results in blank space on the sides. Some
commercials are in standard def, which on HDTV makes additional blank
space on the top and bottom, giving an effect of the signal &quot;floating&quot;
on a sea of darkness.

Furthermore, the signal was jerky, like streaming internet video, with
frequent pixelation. I even lost the signal for a few seconds, after
which I checked to see if there was a &quot;trip wire&quot; in the settings that
I could turn down or off. I once had a Panasonic TV that would give
you a blue screen if the signal got too low. That I could turn off;
this I can't. If the signal gets too low with the Samsung STB, it will
give you a &quot;weak signal&quot; screensaver.

Some stations are squeezing two signals on one HDTV channel. In two
cases, the second channel is a 24/7 weather channel with local weather
reports; in a third case the Fox station has a music video service
called &quot;The Tube&quot; on their second channel. The PBS station has an
amazing THREE stations on one channel! One is their regular channel,
one is a second channel that is usually available only on cable, and a
third is V-me, a PBS service for Latinos in Spanish. The Univision
(Spanish language) channel supposedly has an HDTV service, but there's
nothing there.

Some reports have said that HDTV from different cities is available in
Sacramento; my antenna won't pick it up. I suppose that if I had an
outdoor antenna on a pole I'd get it. Two channels, including a local
weather channel and the HDTV signal of a second tier station, are weak
and keep cutting out. If this is HDTV after years of government
pressure and millions spent, it's clearly not ready for prime time so
to speak. Hopefully by switch time they'll have ironed out the bugs.

My setup at first wouldn't pick up several stations with the slew
buttons; I had to download an HDTV channel list off the net, then
manually enter those stations into memory. Even more confusing, the
Samsung box lists channels not by their HDTV assignment, but by their
standard def channel, a hyphen, and a subchannel, ex. 6-1, 6-2, and
6-3 instead of Channel 53. You can USE the HD channel, but it switches
you right back to this hyphenated system on the display. I suppose
this is to ease the transition, and to allow subchannels, but you are
left not only with two channel numbers for one station but something
less than true HDTV, since stations force two or three services onto
one HD channel. I doubt that was the FCC's intention.

I suspect that when people realize that they're being forced into
HDTV-
with beaucoup dollar amounts required to switch-only to get standard
def, they'll be mad. I'm an electronics geek anyway, so for me it was
worth it. But Joe Sixpack will spend this sort of outlay and find his
HD experience reduced so that his local TV station can bring him 24
hour weather or music videos, and start talking a blue streak.
---------

Updates to this: Univision is only receivable on channel 18 IF the
antenna is pointed a certain way. Supposedly, Telemundo is on channel
62, but the signal is so far away that I can't get it. There's also a
four channel Christian service (KSPX) on channel 48. My antenna is a
Terk UHF/VHF, purchased at Best Buy.

Overall, since I don't watch much cable anyway, I'm happy with OTA
HDTV in general. Comments?

The sales people must have drawn straws when they saw you coming.:-)
Here's what you should have got.

http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5623471

And there's no such thing as an HDTV antenna. It's just an antenna. If you
already had an old UHF/VHF antenna, you didn't need another one. If you'd
have bought a Tv with a built in ATSC tuner, you also wouldn't have needed
the HDTV STB or the HDMI cable. And you can buy HDMI cables for under $10.
Want the news in HD, watch NBC. The blank space at the top of the screen
on commercials is supposed to be there. That's how the commercial was
made. You just wouldn't have had the side bars on a non-widescreen set. Of
course, you can zoom those type shows to full screen without losing aspect
ratios.

It's not unusual for a DT station to have an SD subchannel. Most do here
too. And one channel here has 5 SD subchannrels. That's just one advantage
to digital TV.

The only thing not ready for prime time is your antenna. Wise up. You
should have asked here (or at least read some post) before you bought
anything. You got totally screwed because of your own ignorance.

Just one. If Best Buy has a return policy, get your money back, then come
back here and get some help with what to buy.

Okay, let's start with:

-Doesn't your new Polaroid TV already have an ATSC tuner?

-Return the cable and go to monoprice.com

-Return the indoor antenna and get a $24 Channelmaster 3021 [4221] and mount
it in the attic or outside.

I add my two bits here as well.

Since you were buying a new HD TV, you should have combined the $290
for the TV, $180 for the Samsung DTB-H260F (excellent ATSC tuner &amp;
useful for challenging multipath or weak signal situations, but not
needed in most cases if the TV has a good built-in ATSC tuner), $65 for
the way overpriced (Monster?) HDMI cable and got a bigger and better TV.

But NBC Nightly news is in HD - some of it anyway. Yes, it is not all
HD yet - prime time scripted shows are almost all HD (Scrubs is about
the last holdout), it is the cheap SD game &amp; reality shows that hold
down the amount of HD in prime time. Sports - football, baseball, golf,
etc - are increasingly all HD. We will see a lot more HD on the major
broadcast stations outside of prime time &amp; late night over the next year
or two because Pathfire, the main distribution system for syndicated
programming, is just about to complete the upgrade of the their system
for HD. Stations will have to buy HD servers &amp; tape machines, so it
won't happen everywhere at once, but eventually we will get daytime
programs in HD (Oprah and Dr. Phil in HD! Ok, I grant you that are
drawbacks to this HD conversion) and more &amp; more local news in HD as well.

You need a better antenna setup. An indoor antenna is usually only
recommended if you are in a strong signal area for the broadcast
stations. In the wooded areas, that may be only 5 to 10 miles. Check
www.antennaweb.org for your digital stations and recommended antenna
level. Digital stations mostly broadcast on UHF, but there are currently
several hundred digital stations on VHF. There will be a lot more
digital stations on upper VHF 7 to 13 after the analog shutdown on
February 17, 2009 so people need to check if they need an antenna which
can get upper VHF as well for digital reception.

If you provide your zip code, I will be happy to provide some advice on
an antenna setup. At medium ranges, you can often put the antenna in the
attic. I have a Channel Master 4221 4 Bay bowtie (&lt;$40 online including
shipping) in my attic and get stations up to 46 miles away just fine.

One key reason for switching to digital broadcasting is the ability to
squeeze more stations into a smaller part of the spectrum and to provide
for multiple sub-channels. Most stations with HD now have one SD
sub-channel to go with their HD sub-channel. One SD sub-channel such as
a mostly static or slow update weather channel does not hurt their HD
picture quality very much at all. Adding more SD sub-channels does hurt
HD picture quality, but all we can do is complain to the station.

Univision is SD only. Most of their programming, AFAIK, comes from
Mexico and South America which is in very early stages of upgrading to
HD. Univision will probably eventually switch to HD, but not for quite a
while.

There are seven broadcast networks with HD programming: ABC, CBS, Fox,
NBC, PBS, CW, My Network. TBN, the religious network, has announced they
will be providing a HD feed on their digital stations by the end of 2007.

Most people know the station by their analog broadcast channel, not
the call sign. The solution is to map the digital broadcast channel to
the analog channel for display on the box. The PSIP header provides the
channel mapping. In February, 2009, over 500 stations will switch their
digital channel back to their current analog channel.

The FCC is not mandating HD, but only digital broadcasting to free up
spectrum so they can auction off UHF 52 to 69 (minus the 24 MHz that
will be reserved for new public safety systems). It is up to the
stations and the networks to decide how they want to split up their 19.4
MB/second ATSC broadcast signal. Do a search for ATSC &amp; PSIP to learn
some of the technical stuff, if you want.

In 2008, the standard def &quot;converter&quot; boxes are due to be made
available for around $50 with a coupon program. These boxes will be
stripped down ATSC tuners (hopefully 5th or 6th generation) that will
output SD signals on co-axial, composite, and S-Video. Many people -
those with decent antennas - will be amazed at the improved picture
quality and the number of new channel options. Many will be confused by
the whole thing, but you can help by assisting your neighbors and
friends in the conversion process.

Whew, long reply.

You should have bought a HDTV with a built-in ATSC tuner to
avoid a set top box and and

For $650 you could have gotten a 32&quot; LCD HDTV with a

would only
have to add an antenna(assuming you don't already have a

I don't have cable. I consider my switch to digital more
than worth it.
My local PBS has two channels 2 and 44-DT. 2-DT is split
into PBS HD
and local SD. 44-DT has four subchannels including World. My
local
ABC affiliate does its local news in HD which is stunning.
Sports is
where HD tends to shine especially with wide stadium shots.

The PBS HD channel has a lot of good stuff that doesn't
appear on
the SD channel. Nova and Nature are worth rewatching in HD
even if
you've seen them in SD.

I did have to experiment with amplified indoor antennas but
finally
found one that requires minimal orientating and
repositioning. I now get
digital stations that were unwatchable in analog.

I'm pleased.

Depends on where you are. Many upper VHF analog stations are switching
to their upper VHF 7 to 13 (174 to 216 MHz) channel. Most stations on
low VHF in analog have chosen to keep their digital broadcast on UHF as
low VHF is prone to interference issues. At this point, there are only
37 full power stations that have opted to go to low VHF 2 to 6 across
the US in the post analog shutdown era. If you want to read a discussion
of this that has been going on for a while:
http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=823166 .

The final digital channel list was recently published by the FCC for
the 1800+ full power stations at http://www.fcc.gov/dtv/ on August 6
with Appendix B Excel file the easiest to access. The list as posted
does not include call signs, but people can figure it out in most cases
from the city, state, and analog (NTSC) channel number.

However, many UHF antennas can pick up upper VHF stations if they are
close enough or depending on the design of the antenna. Upper VHF is 3x
the frequency of low VHF, so the wavelengths are shorter and closer to
UHF 14-69 (470 to 805 MHz) than low VHF. The Channel Master 4228 8 bay
bowtie is a directional UHF antenna, but it's wide back screen offers ok
performance for upper VHF. See the UHF antenna for VHF chart down the
page at http://www.hdtvprimer.com/ANTENNAS/comparing.html . Winegard
offers several upper VHF only antennas which will likely be popular in 2009.

One reason I always ask for the zip code when someone asks here or on
avsforum.com for antenna advice is so I can look up whether the digital
stations are all currently on UHF or not and whether any are switching
to VHF in February, 2009. Yes, a lot of people who brought small UHF
antennas will run into problems in 2009 because the transition process
was/is poorly understood. The plan has been since circa 1998 to go to
VHF 2 to UHF 51 for digital TV broadcasts, but a common misconception is
the digital ATSC broadcasts are and will be done only on UHF. Not so.

Thanks.  Say, my zip is 98034. Day before yesterday I bought a 4221

Tell me it'll work with all the networks in my area even after the
transition..  ;-)

I got the indoor antenna because I haven't yet convinced my
grandfather to give me the antenna mast with rotor he's no longer
using since he switched to cable. The antenna on that one is shot, so
I will be buying a new one. The Polaroid TV only has an NTSC tuner.
I'm limited as to space, so plunking down money for a 30 inch TV (that
I have no room for) was not an option. My understanding is, the bigger
the screen, the better HD experience you will have. A home theater
system with a 50 inch screen and theatre quality surround sound is not
my thing.

Unfortunately I don't have room for a 32 inch TV. I didn't expect the

service leaves a lot to be desired (as a thread here notes) and I
wasn't watching most of the 80 channels that they forced me to buy.

I bought an antenna that can do VHF as well as UHF. It has beefy
rabbit ears for VHF. I had a classic style indoor antenna laying
around, but it was a Radio Shack and its performance on analog left
something to be desired. I was looking at antennas at Best Buy and
noticed that they were just regular antennas that had &quot;HDTV&quot; on the
box. I bought the one that looked least like a plain old rabbit ears
and loop antenna. It's a Terk. An outdoor antenna is in the works, but
it may be a few more months. My location is Sacramento, California, on
the north side of town which is notorious for signal problems since
all the transmitters are down in the delta near Stockton. There's even
a couple tx's on Mount Diablo, which is simply too far for an indoor
antenna. I understand that channel 10 (KXTV) will go from HD channel
61 to HD channel 10 in 2009.

The good news is that the Channel Master 4221 is a very good UHF
antenna which does have some performance for the upper end of upper VHF,
mainly VHF 10 to 13. It can get VHF 7, 8, 9 if the signal is strong
enough. I have a CM 4221 4 bay bowtie in my attic and I get good picture
quality for the Washington DC analog stations on WJLA 7 and WUSA 9 at 16
miles. It is very poor for analog VHF WBAL 11 &amp; WJZ 13 in Baltimore at
around 43 miles and non-line of sight.

I used antennaweb to get a list of your digital local stations in the
Seattle area, but I sorted the list by city to make it easier to look
up. I added the post analog shutdown final channel assignment in
brackets on the right.

KWPX-DT 33.1 ION BELLEVUE WA 126° 18.2 32  [33]
KWOG-DT 51.1 IND BELLEVUE WA 126° 18.2 50  [50]

KIRO-DT 7.1  CBS SEATTLE WA  214° 9.3  39  [39]

KMYQ-DT 22.1 MNT SEATTLE WA  198° 8.7  25  [25]
KHCV-DT 44.1 SAH SEATTLE WA  126° 18.2 44  [44]
KSTW-DT 11.1 CW  TACOMA WA   198° 8.7  36  [11] **
KCPQ-DT 13.1 FOX TACOMA WA   230° 30.6 18  [13] **
KTBW-DT 14.1 TBN TACOMA WA   229° 30.1 14  [14]
KBTC-DT 28.1 PBS TACOMA WA   188° 33.7 27  [27]
KWDK-DT 42.1 DAY TACOMA WA   126° 18.2 42  [42]

Three of your local stations: KCTS-DT PBS 9, KSTW-DT CW 11, and
KCPQ-DT Fox 13 are switching back to their upper VHF channels. The good
news is that you are pretty close to KCTS-DT and KSTW-DT so the CM 4221
is likely to get those. KCPQ-DT Fox 13 at 30 miles is the challenging
one, but the CM 4221 has good gain for VHF 13.

Your stations are spread around in azimuth, so the CM 4221 is a good
choice for that situation. I get 17 digital stations in five different
direction clusters with my CM 4221, so I'm happy with it. I would give
the CM 4221 a shot, although given the dense woods of the Pacific NW,
you want to get as much height as you can. You will also have to
experiment with the aim, perhaps starting with aiming it at 230°. Keep a
mental image of this beam pattern
( http://www.hdtvprimer.com/ANTENNAS/cm4221.html ) in your head when
tweaking the aim. Check the analog picture quality for the upper VHF
stations, if it is ok, you may be set for 2009.

If you eventually need more gain for the upper VHF stations, check the
Winegard upper VHF antenna at http://www.winegard.com/offair/vhf.htm . I
expect we will see something similar from Channel Master and others by
then. Winegard recently dropped their smaller YA-6713 upper VHF antenna;
maybe they are coming out with another model.

If you want to get deeper into predicted signal strength, try
www.tvfool.com .

Good luck.

Alan, you're a wealth of information. Thanks!

I went to tvfool.com and entered my address. It pretty much agrees with
what I get now using rabbit ears with UHF antenna loop. Channel 13, FOX,
and channel 9, PBS are of concern to me as I need to get both those or I
can't cut cable. Right now tvfool has me in the green for PBS but in the
yellow for FOX.  Using the tv top antenna that I have now, 13 is by far
the hardest to get. I can get it but it cuts in and out. I bought the
new antenna to alleviate that. BTW, I didn't buy the 4228 because it
won't fit through my attic door otherwise I would have gone with that
one. Question, do you know if the 4221 antenna's can be put in series
with each pointed a slightly different direction to help obtain better
reception?

Plugging in a zip code for north end of Sacramento, CA, 95835, places
the stations listed under Sacramento &amp; Stockton locations at around 27
to 30 miles to the south at ~ 163° in azimuth. (Easier if you just
provided a zip!). Pretty far for an indoor antenna, unless you have a
good line of sight to the towers.

All of the digital stations in your area are currently on UHF. Two of
the stations will be moving to upper VHF in February, 2009.  KXTV-DT ABC
10 is moving from UHF 61 to VHF 10 as you mentioned. There has been an
interesting change however for KVIE-DT PBS 6. In the 2006 post shutdown
channel list, KVIE-DT was going to go to VHF 6 low. In the final channel
list, the station has managed to get off of VHF low and has been granted
authority to broadcast on VHF 9 (probably on the same tower as KXTV-DT
10 to eliminate interference). This is good news as people won't need to
get a big antenna for low VHF coverage.

While waiting on the outdoor antenna, elevate the indoor antenna as
much as you can and aim the open face of the UHF loop towards the
stations. Putting the antenna high up in a window with a clear view
towards SES might do the trick. All of your stations are in the same
direction and you need UHF and upper VHF coverage. If you buy a new
antenna, the Channel Master 4228 8 Bay bowtie would be a good choice.
It's ~$55 plus shipping on-line at a site such as solidsignal.com. The
CM 4228 is heavy, so if it goes outdoors, a sturdy mount is a must. The
CM 4221 is also an option, but you may need to add a upper VHF antenna
in 2009 (or may not).

Good luck,
Alan F

&gt;&gt; ( http://www.hdtvprimer.com/ANTENNAS/cm4221.html ) in your head when
&gt;&gt; tweaking the aim. Check the analog picture quality for the upper VHF
&gt;&gt; stations, if it is ok, you may be set for 2009.

&gt;&gt;  If you eventually need more gain for the upper VHF stations, check
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; Winegard upper VHF antenna at http://www.winegard.com/offair/vhf.htm .
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; expect we will see something similar from Channel Master and others by
&gt;&gt; then. Winegard recently dropped their smaller YA-6713 upper VHF
&gt;&gt; antenna;
&gt;&gt; maybe they are coming out with another model.

&gt;&gt;  If you want to get deeper into predicted signal strength, try
&gt;&gt; www.tvfool.com .

&gt; Alan, you're a wealth of information. Thanks!

&gt; I went to tvfool.com and entered my address. It pretty much agrees with
&gt; what I get now using rabbit ears with UHF antenna loop. Channel 13, FOX,
&gt; and channel 9, PBS are of concern to me as I need to get both those or I
&gt; can't cut cable. Right now tvfool has me in the green for PBS but in the
&gt; yellow for FOX.  Using the tv top antenna that I have now, 13 is by far
&gt; the hardest to get. I can get it but it cuts in and out. I bought the
&gt; new antenna to alleviate that. BTW, I didn't buy the 4228 because it
&gt; won't fit through my attic door otherwise I would have gone with that
&gt; one. Question, do you know if the 4221 antenna's can be put in series
&gt; with each pointed a slightly different direction to help obtain better
&gt; reception?

Ben, the net gain improvement of the CM 4221 will be around a 8 to 12 dB
increase over the old UHF loop. Putting the CM 4221 outside or up in the
attic to get height and clear obstructions in the house will improve the
situation even more. If you can get the KCPQ-DT Fox 13 station with
dropouts with the UHF loop, you should be fine with the CM 4221. Check
the net gain charts for B (CM 4221) versus J (small loop) at
http://www.hdtvprimer.com/ANTENNAS/comparing.html .

Since you are putting the antenna in the attic, I suggest you don't
lock it down in place until you have found a good spot as attics have
dead zones. My attic sure as heck does for the weaker distant stations.
My CM 4221 is mounted on a large piece of flat scrap wood using a $5
attic mounting bracket I got at Lowes. The flat wood allows me to move
the antenna around in the attic by sliding it across the floor beams. I
moved it around until I found a good spot and left it there. I've done
some more tweaking since then as the movable flat base makes it easy to
experiment with location and aim.

Good luck,
Alan F

&gt;&gt; &gt; . . . a whopping $65 for a special cable called an

&gt;I didn't expect the

&gt;cables are kept in a different section of the store, and run nearly
&gt;$200 for HDMI!).

Still way too much for an HDMI cable a few feet long.  Return it if
you can and get one from monoprice.com.  Should be under $10 unless
you need a long one.

&gt; I was using cable previously, but Comcast's HD
&gt;service leaves a lot to be desired (as a thread here notes) and I
&gt;wasn't watching most of the 80 channels that they forced me to buy.

OTA is definitely the best way to get broadcast stations if you can,
but if you're going to keep any level of cable service, you should be
aware that you don't have to buy a digital package or use their
digital STB to get whatever digital broadcast channels they carry.
You just need a tuner that can handle clear (unencrypted) QAM, the
modulation used for digital cable.  You're paying for those with even
the minimum cable package, often called Basic.

Oh, and about the Terk antenna mentioned in the original post: I've
read some derogatory comments about Terk compared with other brands,
but I've also read that at least some models are easy to assemble
incorrectly, and if you do it right they work about as well as similar
ones.

I highly recommend www.hdtvprimer.com .  It's more than everything you
need to know about HDTV.  Click on the link for antennae for gobs of
antenna information.  FYI: in their tests, Terk was acceptable, but
not recommeded.
