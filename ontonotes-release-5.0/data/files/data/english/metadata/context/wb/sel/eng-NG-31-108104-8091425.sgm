I'm hoping someone here knows something about digital cameras...

I finally broke down and bought a modern digital camera - Canon A550.
I know they're not the latest/greatest, but it was on sale and had
some features I wanted (like a viewfinder - have you ever tried to
take daytime photos when the sun is washing out the view screen on the
back of the camera??? it really *is* point and shoot!).

The camera manual specifies various OS the download software will work
with. My home computer is ancient - it runs off of Win98 (hey, it
works just fine for me). Not Win98 SE mind you, plain old Win98 with
various and sundry service packs and updates applied (including the
famous SP2).

Here's the question/problem. The camera manual says the software will
work with Win98 SE. Most of the time it's not a problem, and it will
work on my computer fine. But every once in a while I run across
something where it *is* a problem and it won't install/run. Anyone
have a clue as to if Win98 (SP2) and Canon A550 camera download
software are compatible?

No idea.  Have you tried installing the software and hooking up the
camera, to see what results you get?  It is very unlikely that a
software malfunction would do anything to the camera; the result would
be only that you couldn't readily download the pictures.  If that were
to happen, you could probably work out an arrangement with a friend
where you would periodically use their computer to download pictures
onto a CD, then transfer the pictures from the CD onto your computer.
The pictures are likely to be too large to fit onto a floppy.  Another
possibility, if your computer has a USB port, would be to use someone
else's computer to transfer the pictures onto a &quot;thumb drive&quot;.

Thanks MMJ.

You know, you can search and search and search for something online
and it will never turn up for you. Someone else goes looking for the
same thing and finds it right away.   :/

Anyway, it appears I have hope (until I can scrape together enough $$$
for a new computer  :)

That's why my older brother always bugs me to search for things online -
he's inept at them.  Latest one was to find a person by a certain last name,
on a certain street, as they had found a wallet at the local Home Depot, and
wanted to make sure that they still resided there before they mailed it
(anonymously) back.  Apparently they couldn't find anything in their local
phone book LOL

I use Win98 SE at work, and found out it really doesn't like thumb
drives. I purchased one so I could transfer files between there and
home, but it won't recognize it. :P There are 4 differeent USB ports
on that system, and none work with it. The system is a 2.6 ghz Intel
chip w/250 gigabyte hard drive and 1 gig ram (and 500 of that ram is
useless because Win98 doesn't acknowledge ram over 500 mb. :P) We need
to upgrade our OS, but need to find Win200 Pro, as one of our programs
won't run under XP or Vista.

You don't need any software.  Just get a card reader (they are less than
$10) and take the memory stick out of your camera and put it into the
card reader (connected to your computer by USB).  Then you can drag and
drop your pics onto your hard drive in Windows Explorer.

I suggest that you get a card reader and use that to download pictures
instead of downloading directly from the camera.  They are inexpensive, easy
to use, much faster than direct connection to the camera, and avoid draining
your camera batteries.

Thanks for the idea, Britta, but that won't work on my machine.  My
experience when I've tried that in the past was much as Helen Wheels
said -- the card reader is expecting certain OS and won't work if it
doesn't get what it wants.  All I kept getting was &quot;I don't like your
OS, go install something modern&quot; error messages  ^_^;;;

And I'm not even using Win98 SE, I'm using the even earlier Win 98,
w/SP2 installed!  (Service Pack 2 did a lot of the fixes that were
later incorporated into SE)

Hi MaryL,

Tried that in the past, it doesn't work with my OS. The card readers
seem to be expecting something more modern than any flavor of Win98.

Hi John,

I agree, the camera should work fine - it has nothing to do with the
computer when it comes to picture taking.  This is all about finding a
way to get the pictures from the camera to the hard drive.

Absolutely worst case I could download onto my laptop at work (uses
XP), but that's really and hugely frowned upon (government property
and all that).

I take that back - absolutely worst case would be me buying a new
computer that I can't afford right now, just to download some pictures

Maybe you could get hold of a copy of Win98SE, I'm sure there are lots
around not used anymore. ISTR when I went from 98 to 98SE it solved the
problems I was having with USB devices.

Hello Jeanne, I'm working in a camera shop but not with the equipment.
If I can remember
tomorrow, I'll ask about card readers that are ok with win 98.

Also, we have adaptors for the LCD screens that shade the sun out so
that you can
actually SEE what you are shooting...

&gt;&gt;Have you tried installing the software and hooking up the
&gt;&gt;camera, to see what results you get?  It is very unlikely that a
&gt;&gt;software malfunction would do anything to the camera; the result would
&gt;&gt;be only that you couldn't readily download the pictures.  If that were
&gt;&gt;to happen, you could probably work out an arrangement with a friend
&gt;&gt;where you would periodically use their computer to download pictures
&gt;&gt;onto a CD, then transfer the pictures from the CD onto your computer.
&gt;&gt;The pictures are likely to be too large to fit onto a floppy.  Another
&gt;&gt;possibility, if your computer has a USB port, would be to use someone
&gt;&gt;else's computer to transfer the pictures onto a &quot;thumb drive&quot;.

&gt; Hi John,

&gt; I agree, the camera should work fine - it has nothing to do with the
&gt; computer when it comes to picture taking.  This is all about finding a
&gt; way to get the pictures from the camera to the hard drive.

&gt; Absolutely worst case I could download onto my laptop at work (uses
&gt; XP), but that's really and hugely frowned upon (government property
&gt; and all that).

&gt; I take that back - absolutely worst case would be me buying a new
&gt; computer that I can't afford right now, just to download some pictures
&gt; $_$;;;

Sorry for intruding just a lurker here, but if you have a cdrom drive you
may want to try installing one of the Linux distrubutions.  They're free,
and the liveCD's let you try it out without affecting the hard drive.
Anything you can do in Windows you can do in Linux w/o viruses, spyware,
etc.  Good support for usb cards, too!  Work on any old PC. Try Ubuntu or
PClinuxos for a start.
