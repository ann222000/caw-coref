Divine attribute Al Rahman (The Gracious) of Allah/God
Summary of Friday Sermon   ww.mta.tv    ww.alislam.org
delivered by the Successor to Promised Reformer of this era ( Head of
the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community)
Peace be upon you!
The holy man of God  continued with the topic of the Divine quality of
Rahman (Gracious) in his  Sermon  and elucidated the matter with
reference to the sayings of holy prophet Muhammad ( blessings on him
and all prophets) called Ahadith.
Huzur ( the holy successor)  remarked that may this citation of
Ahadith enable us to imbibe the resplendence of the quality of
Rahmaniyyat, and also facilitate for us to further turn to God with
every fibre of our existence being grateful to Him. May they also
enable us to invoke blessings on the 'Mercy for all mankind', who,
through his admonishment and blessed model, gave us humble people the
insight and perception to connect a bond with the Gracious God.
The Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) ( who appearded in 1889)
explains the 'reflection of the quality of  effects of attribute
Rahman' and says that the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah
be on him) was the perfect manifestation of Rahmaniyyat. Muhammad
means one who is highly praised and Rahman means One Who gives without
being asked and it is clear that one who gives without being asked
will be praised. Thus, the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah
be on him) had this materialization in his person. Such is the
incomparable discernment the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) had
of his master.
The Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) said that
Allah's mercy is only taken away from the very unfortunate and
wretched. Huzur remarked that therein is glad tiding of Allah's
boundless mercy. Another Hadith cites that if a believer was to
comprehend Allah's chastisement, he would have no hope of Paradise and
if a disbeliever was to know of the amplitude of Allah's mercy, he
would have hope of Paradise. Explaining this Huzur said if a believer
really was to have no hope then no one would ever have faith. Due to
his/her taqwa, (righteousness) a believer has comprehension of Allah's
other attributes as well, and has the fear of chastisement for any
wrongdoing, therefore a believer always prays to be guided on the
right path as in verse 24 of Surah A'raf (7:24). A true believer is
one who has fear of God despite knowing that God's attribute of mercy
prevails over all else. Indeed, with reference to this Quranic verse
the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) said that people should
continually seek Istaghfar from all manner of sin, both overt and
covert. The above prayer has been accepted therefore while one should
be thoughtful one should also have hope that God has taught us prayers
to attract His mercy.
The Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) said Allah
has a hundred mercies of which He has divided one among all creation
and it is through this that they love each other and have affection
and compassion. Animals too show love for their young through this
mercy. Allah has kept ninety of the remaining mercies Himself and it
is through these that He shall have mercy on the Day of Judgment.
The Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) said that in
earlier times a well-off man who had children was on his deathbed and
he asked his sons what kind of a father he had been to them. The sons
replied, the best. However, the man said that he had done no good that
he could present to Allah and that he feared he would be punished.
Therefore he said that after death he should be cremated and his ashes
spread in fierce wind. His sons did as he had asked. However, when the
man was presented before Allah Who enquired what had instigated him to
ask to be burnt after death, the man replied 'Your fear'. Allah made a
compensation for him, had mercy on him and forgave him.
The Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) also told of
an Israelite who having killed 99 people, asked around how to repent.
He asked a hermit/monk, who told him that repentance was not possible
for him as he had killed 99 people. The man killed the monk, making
him his 100th killing. However, he continued to ask about ways of
repentance. Someone told him to go to a certain village and ask a holy
man. While on his way to the village, the man met his death. Just as
he realised he was about to die he turned his chest towards the
village he was heading for. Once he was dead the angels of mercy and
punishment came and had an argument over his seeking of forgiveness
and his earlier cruelties. Allah ordered the village where the man was
heading to get closer and ordered the place from where he had left to
get further. He then ordered the angels to measure the difference. The
distance to the village he was heading to was a mere span less than
the other distance. Allah thus forgave him.
Huzur explained that despite Allah's all-encompassing mercy one who is
adamant on wrongdoing has also been warned of punishment. The idea is
that one starts the steps towards reformation and after feeling
remorse for one's sins, one seeks forgiveness, only then one should
have hope as stated in verse 54 of Surah Al Zumar (39:54).
The Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) admonished
to be kind to others to receive Allah mercy and admonished to forgive
others to seek Allah's forgiveness. He said there is destruction for
one does not pay heed to admonishment. He also enjoined that Allah
will not have mercy on one who does not have compassion on others.
Huzur said this was very salient advice in terms of close relatives,
friends and neighbours.
Huzur said he would make one clarification in that those who are
reprimanded (under the administrative system of the Community)
sometimes complain that while discourses are given on mercy and
compassion, no compassion is shown to them. Huzur said the Holy
Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) counselled mercy and
compassion in general terms and generally speaking the administration
system of the Community as well as the Khalifa of the day do excuse.
However, once one is reprimanded, one should accept it. By way of
example Huzur related how once the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings
of Allah be on him) would reprimand someone he stood by his decision.
Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) said that people
of Paradise will be of three types: a ruler who is just, wise and
gives alms; a person who is kind to relatives and to Muslims and a man
who is in need but does not ask and gives alms.
In another Hadith the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on
him) said one who is not kind to the young and not deferential to the
elders is not among us. Huzur added, each Ahmadi should exhibit the
quality of kindness to the young and the elders.
The Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) said one who
is not thankful for a little is not thankful for a lot and one who is
not grateful to people is not grateful to God and that a Jama'at or a
community is Allah's mercy. Huzur said this opens yet another door of
Allah's kindness on us in that we have the blessing of our Community.
We can express our gratefulness for this by taking our message to
others and by praying for them. The Holy Prophet (peace and blessings
of Allah be on him) said that all believers are like one body in terms
of mutual love, affection and compassion and when one part of the body
is ailing the whole body suffers. Huzur said such is the teaching of
the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) for an
Islamic society.
Next Huzur cited a few Ahadith expounding the Holy Prophet's (peace
and blessings of Allah be on him) sense of compassion for animals,
even those which were meant to be slaughtered, and how he once, upon
seeing a distressed bird that fluttered above him ordered that its
eggs be returned to her nest.
When asked to curse certain tribe or person, the Holy Prophet (peace
and blessings of Allah be on him) would abstain and would instead pray
for them. Even when asked to curse the idolaters, the Holy Prophet
(peace and blessings of Allah be on him) would say his advent had not
been to curse, rather his advent was as a mercy for all mankind. Huzur
added if only the Muslim ummah would follow his blessed footsteps and
treat everyone with kindness so that they may be the recipient of
Allah's blessings.
Huzur explained how he would always pray for his Companions (may Allah
be pleased with them) before leaving a gathering and say the
following: 'O Allah grant us such awe and fear of You that would
intercept between us and disobedience to You. Enable us to have
obedience that would take us to Your Paradise. Bestow on us such
certainty that would make worldly troubles easy on us. As long as You
keep us alive, grant us benefit from our ears, eyes and faculties and
grant us successors from these faculties. Retaliate on our behalf with
such person who oppresses us. Help us against one who has enmity with
us. Do not put us in trouble about our faith and do not make this
world our biggest concern. Do not make one who gives us knowledge a
malady for us and do not impose a person over us who is not kind to
us'
Huzur said all Ahmadis living under unjust and oppressive rulers
should say this prayer abundantly.
Huzur related a few other Ahadith expounding the Holy prophet's (peace
and blessings of Allah be on him) compassion to children and others.
Huzur said that the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on
him) certainly honoured the capacity of being mercy for all mankind
that the Gracious God sent him as. Indeed, he attained perfection in
other qualities as well but enjoined that no one's, including himself,
deeds would bring salvation for them, adding it would happen 'only if
Allah's mercy envelops me'. Although through the Holy Qur'an Allah had
him announce 'My Prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are
all for Allah, the Lord of the worlds' (6:163) he still maintained
that only Allah's mercy could cover him.
Huzur said in order to absorb Allah's mercy it is most important that
the Divine quality of Rahmaniyyat should make believers turn to Him
ever more and to seek His mercy. He prayed that may Allah enable us to
do so.

Life of the Promised Messiah (as)
Summary of Friday Sermon    ww.alislam.org     ww.mta.tv
delivered by the successor to Promised Reformer  of this era,  Head of
the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community
February 02nd, 2007
Referring to his sermon of last Friday when he gave a discourse on the
kindness, compassion and benevolence of the Holy Prophet (peace and
blessings of Allah be on him) that the prophet had derived from the
quality of Rahmaniyyat of the Gracious God, Huzur said today he would
speak on the life of the Prophet's true and ardent devotee, the
Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) and how he tried to fully adopt
his master's blessed model.
Despite his extremely busy day to day life as he took on the entire
world to defend Islam through his writings, the Promised Messiah (on
whom be peace) would always be eager to dispense kindness and
compassion to humanity. His kindness stemmed from his desire to be
grateful to his Gracious and Bountiful God Who had informed him
through revelation that he was to exemplify kindness and compassion.
This compassion was driven by angst for the spiritually ill as well as
prayer and practical steps for the physically ailing.
Lala Shrampat Rai, who was witness to many signs of the truthfulness
of the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) once fell ill with a most
virulent boil on his abdomen. The Promised Messiah (on whom be peace)
went to visit him at his modest home and found him most anxious. He
consoled him and next day visited again accompanied with a doctor who
was then appointed to treat him. The doctor's expenses were met and
the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) continued to make daily
visits. When Lala was a bit better the visits became intermittent but
he continued visiting until Lala Shrampat was cured.
Mehr Hamid was a meek humble person who lived at the outskirts of
Qadian in an area where all the refuse was dumped. When he fell ill
the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) would take people of the
Qadian Jama'at and visit him. The stench in the area, caused by the
refuse, would trouble the visiting people. The Promised Messiah (on
whom be peace) had a most refined nature and he too would be troubled
by the stench. However he did not let this stop him from making the
visits, when he would talk most affectionately to Mehr Hamid and
cheered him. Mehr Hamid worked on the lands and was as if a retainer
and a vassal, yet the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) did not ever
discriminate. In fact people commented that he cared for him more than
one would care for one's own relations.
While Allah had given the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) a
resolute and strong heart, he was also most tender-hearted in that he
could not watch anyone in pain. For this reason, at times, he would
not visit the ailing himself and would show his concern in other ways.
Yet he would never decline to visit the sick although seeing them
would make him unwell himself.
One of his devotees, Ayub Baig Sahib who lived at a distance fell very
ill. On his deathbed he felt an overwhelming desire to see the
Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) and sent him a letter as well as a
telegram requesting him to come by. The Promised Messiah (on whom be
peace) was also unwell at the time, so he wrote back a most poignant
letter expressing his inability to travel and said that he was
fervently engaged in prayers for Ayub Baig Sahib's health. He wrote
that he did not have words to convey his pain and that because of this
he could barely hold the pen. He asked to be kept posted daily.
While the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) did not ever turn a
needy person away, he would meet the needs of some before they had a
chance to ask for help. For example sensing the need of others he
would provide warm clothing in winter. This he would do often and
without any distinction of friend or foe, Muslim or Hindu.
He would appreciate the need of others and offer help without the
other asking. He would, without exception, offer to pay something
towards the fare of those who visited him from afar.
Sheikh Muhammad Naseem Ahmad Sahib was an orphan who had been brought
up in the care of the Jama'at and went on to work for a newspaper. At
the birth of the first born of Hadhrat Khalifa tul Masih II (may Allah
be pleased with him), Naseer Ahmad, who died in infancy, a wet nurse
was needed for the baby. The Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) asked
for the services of Naseem Sahib's wife. He inquired about the income
of Naseem Sahib and felt that perhaps he found it difficult to make
ends meet. One day he discreetly flicked a small bundle of money in
his room.
Nihal Singh was a most zealous opponent of the mission of the Promised
Messiah (on whom be peace) even resorting to a court case. At the
exact time of the court case one of his female relatives fell ill and
musk, which was not available anywhere, was need for her treatment.
Having looked around, eventually he came to the door of the Promised
Messiah (on whom be peace) and asked for musk. Without delay, the
Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) gave him the amount of musk that
he needed.
Simple rustic women would come to his doorstep and call out for him
and the Promised Messiah (on whom e peace) would attend to them
promptly as if some authoritative figure had arrived. Women who came
to get medication would start relating their domestic woes and the
Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) would stand and listen to them
most patiently. Once quite a few women came to get medicines at a time
when he had to write a very important paper. Yet the Promised Messiah
(on whom be peace) stood alert listening to the troubles of the women
for three hours. He considered this as service of faith and would keep
a stock of Greek and Western medicines to offer these needy people.
Many a time he would sit on a simple bedstead with children who in
their playfulness would push him to the foot of the bedstead (which is
not very comfortable to sit on) and would relate their child-like
stories which the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) listened to. No
matter what children did, the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) did
not tell them off.
Then there were those who took undue advantage of the kindness and
benevolence of the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) and asked for
more and more.
Once due to lack of rainfall the yield of the crop on the lands was
very little and those who worked on the land felt there was only
enough grain for their own consumption. They requested that the
difference is made up the following year and that they keep all the
grain to feed themselves. The Promised Messiah (on whom be peace)
agreed. The following year the harvest was copious and the previous
year's share was settled.
Huzur advised that Ahmadi farmers should follow this example,
especially in Sind (Pakistan) with farm workers who come from the
region of Thar.
The Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) had compassion for all living
things. He once caught a young Hadhrat Khalifa tul Masih II (may Allah
be pleased with him) trying to catch birds by shutting the door of the
veranda. He said 'young man one does not catch the birds that are
around the house. One who does not have compassion does not have
faith.'
He once saw children wanted to hit a dog that had entered his house.
He told the children off.
A youth fell critically ill. People brought him over from his village.
His elderly mother accompanied him. Unfortunately the youth passed
away. The Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) led his funeral prayer
which lasted so long that it made some people dizzy. Later the
Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) explained that he had prayed most
intensely for the deceased and did not stop until he was allowed entry
into Paradise.
Maulwi Abdul Kareem relates that he had an apartment above Bait ut dua
where he could hear the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) making
heart-rending supplications. The angst and pain of his entreaties
would be most alarming to hear. He would pray most woefully for
creation to be saved from the plague despite the fact the plague had
materialised as a sign of his truthfulness. Yet he prayed for people
to be saved from it and for them to see the light. Such perfection was
there in his practise of the blessed model of his master, the Holy
Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him).
Next Huzur read a couple of extracts from the noble writings of the
Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) with reference to his passion to
reform the spiritual condition of people.
Huzur concluded that it is in acceptance of the prayers of the
Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) that Nur e Muhammadi (the
spiritual light of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be
on him) is spreading. Today, we, his slaves, are obliged to make his
prayers a part of our prayers and in adopting his teaching, take his
message to the world. So that we too may join in diffusing Nur e
Muhammadi, the reason for which the advent of the Promised Messiah (on
whom be peace) took place; join by raising the slogan of "Nahno
Ansarullah" (we are the helpers of Allah 3:53). May Allah enable us
so. www.alislam.org www.mta.tv
