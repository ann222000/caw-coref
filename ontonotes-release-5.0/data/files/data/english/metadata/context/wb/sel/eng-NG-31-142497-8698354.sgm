Why Do Conservatives Hate Insuring Kids?

By Randolph T Holhut
Created Sep 26 2007 - 2:40pm

DUMMERSTON, Vt. - The prevailing philosophy of conservatives - that
government is the problem and the free market is the solution for every
ill - consistently bumps up against the reality that this philosophy rarely
works as designed.

Here in Vermont, we are about to launch a program called Catamount Health, a
program designed to provide coverage to the roughly 10 percent of working
Vermonters who cannot afford health insurance. The state will subsidize the
cost of the policy on a sliding scale for those making 300 percent of the
federal poverty level - currently $62,000 for a family of four.

It's not a perfect solution to the problem of the uninsured in Vermont, but
it is a good start toward the goal of universal health coverage. But that is
something that the Bush administration does not want to see. Conservative
orthodoxy holds that health insurance is not a right. It is a commodity that
is no different from other goods and services. If you can afford it, great.
If you can't, too bad. Government should not be in the insurance business,
or any other business.

Given this line of thinking, the Bush administration seems to be going out
its way to sabotage the efforts of Vermont and other states to expand health
insurance initiatives such as Catamount. The White House is doing this
unilaterally, without consulting Congress or the states.

A key part of the funding for Catamount was the waiver that Vermont obtained
from the federal government to be able to apply Medicaid money toward the
program. But the Bush administration objects to the idea that families with
incomes at 300 percent of the poverty level should be eligible for insurance
subsidies, and will not pay for coverage for families at that income level.

If that happens, Vermont could lose up $18 million over the next three
years - all because of a philosophy that puts the profits of insurance and
pharmaceutical companies ahead of the health and welfare of the American
people.

But it's not just Catamount that's getting squeezed by the Bush
administration. Vermont could also lose as much as $25 million because of
changes in Medicaid reimbursements to care for special needs students. That
represents about 10 percent of all state and federal spending on special
education in Vermont.

Vermont currently leads the nation in the percentage of its residents
covered by health insurance. That's because this state realizes that when
the private sector fails, it's up to the public sector to deliver the goods.

When it comes to health care, every other country in the industrialized
world realizes this. Only in the United States do we have arguments over
whether giving every child access to health care constitutes &quot;socialism,&quot;
and have conservative think tanks such as The Heritage Foundation call
programs such as Catamount &quot;middle-class welfare.&quot;

In the short term, Vermont's programs can survive. In the long run, the
state can't afford cuts in federal funding and still keep its insurance
programs functioning at the current level.

Recently, Sen. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., introduced the State's Right to
Innovate in Health Care Act. The bill would provide federal money, as well
as greater flexibility in spending that money, to five states. In return,
they would try out programs providing for universal health care coverage.

Vermont is not guaranteed to be one of the five states, but Sanders is
hopeful that Vermont could be. Under Sanders' proposal, at least one of the
five states would institute a single-payer system.

It is abundantly clear that reforms to our nation's health care system are
not going to come from Washington. The status quo - a nation that spends
more on health care than any other nation in the world, yet has nearly 50
million of its citizens without health insurance - is profitable and that's
all that matters.

The innovation is going to come from the states. Vermont, as well as Maine
and Massachusetts, have all taken significant steps toward providing health
care for everyone. These are significant steps that wouldn't have happened
if they sat back and waited for Washington to come up with a plan.

All this is a reminder of one of the best scenes in Michael Moore's film
&quot;Sicko&quot; - his interview with former Labour Party leader Tony Benn.

Benn, one of the most beloved and most reviled political figures in England,
was present at the creation of the social welfare programs enacted after
World War II. The Labour Party envisioned &quot;cradle to grave&quot; protection for
Britons with universal health care, insurance against sickness and
unemployment, family allowances, public housing and old age pensions.
Similar programs sprung up throughout Western Europe and Scandinavia after
the war.

It could have happened in the United States, but the war ended Franklin
Roosevelt's New Deal and little could revive it once peace came. Benn told
Moore the reason why the cradle to grave welfare state never took hold in
America.

&quot;If the poor in Britain or the United States turned out and voted for people
who represented their interests, it would be a real democratic revolution,&quot;
Benn said. &quot;So they don't want it to happen, so (they are) keeping people
hopeless and pessimistic.

&quot;See, I think there are two ways in which people are controlled: first of
all, frighten people, and secondly, demoralize them.... An educated,
healthy, and confident nation is harder to govern, and I think there's an
element in the thinking of some people - we don't want people to be
educated, healthy, and confident because they would get out of control.

&quot;The top 1 percent of the world's population own 80 percent of the world's
wealth. It's incredible that people put up with it - but - they're poor,
they're demoralized, they're frightened, and therefore they think perhaps
the safest thing to do is to take orders and hope for the best.&quot;

Fear and hopelessness are powerful things. They pretty much describe America
in the 2000s. If the citizens of this nation were educated, healthy and
confident, we wouldn't have a government that can come up with a
half-trillion dollars for a war of choice in Iraq without blinking an eye,
while blocking funding increases for Medicare and Medicaid.

Republicans in congress think they're entitled to universal health care,
but if we get what they have, they call it socialism.
