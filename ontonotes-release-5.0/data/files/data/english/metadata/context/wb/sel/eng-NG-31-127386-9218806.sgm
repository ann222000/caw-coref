I'm a card carrying member of the ACLU. I joined last
night to get  'inside' and tell them what I think....

Here's a &quot;Contact Us&quot; contact.....

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

I haven't heard anything from the ACLU about children
in Kindergarten where teachers encourage them to dance
with each other in the nude! Boys can dance with boys,
and girls with girls, touch each other. And masturbate if
they wish.....

The ACLU supports that I assume....
(Am I being assuming ass?)

That is fricken sick....twisted and perverted.....!

Child sexual abuse to the highest order......!

Right in our face.....!

Do something about it....

(Good thing I don't have any power. I'd end that crap
immediately. Arrest the perpetrators and the braying
Liberal Jackassholes, who encourage it.)

I don't go along with a majority of the 'cases' you support.

Now that I'm a Card Carrying member.....I can tell you
what I think of your org. And the 'orgasms' you support.

The ACLU, &quot;Anti Christ Liaisons United&quot;, supports
indoctrinating the children into Marxist.....political
correctness.....

You take God out of ALL public places. And out of
text of poems, songs....etc. When are you going to get
&quot;In God We Trust&quot; off of American currency....?

I'm waiting for that.....

Oh yeah....I'm watching and waiting for that endeavor...
What is taking you so long.....?

Have you kissed a Muslim's ass today.....?
Did you wash their feet in their foot baths..?

Take the Koran &amp; Allah out of public places.....
Condemn Islam as well a Christianity.......

What the fuhk. You take the Torah and HaShem
out of everything you can......

And the Christ is a threat to you....
Your reaction is like a Crucifix is to a Vampire....

Diversity sucks. One can't mix cultures and eXpect
to have a civil society.....chaos ensues....

Look at us.....and orgs like yours who encourage
orgasm for 3+ year olds.....

And illegal immigrants....you kiss their ass alright.....
BIG TIME....

We're going to be a majority Afro Chicano nation in
a few years. Thanks orgs, and the orgasms, such as
yours. Spicanese the dominant language....

The Cock Roach should be the Mexican National
Symbol. It should be on their flag....

I would end the &quot;Drop one and it's automatically
a citizen&quot; bullshit....immediately....

And any Spic that was dropped, the citizenship
would be revoked...and out it goes with the family.

I would get the National Guard out of Iraq and get
them on the Mexican border. They are the National
Guard NOT the International Guard...!

I'd round up ALL the illegals in the country and deport
them. The ones in prison would work on the wall that
will keep their Amigos out.....

Behind the wall will be a moat...an electrified fence.
And another wall...

Rivaling the Great Wall of China......

P.s

You support evolution and negate a Creator...right...?
Of course I'm right...

You deny an Intelligent Design. Where did the intelligence
to do that, come from....?

Intelligence is inherited. It comes from a gene of a parent.
Everyone knows that. Knowing that, can you, ACLU point
to the parental ape who gave us the gene....?

No you can't....
The evolved have a missing link for the HUGE jump to
modern intelligent, mankind....

The closest we get is the Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon
who met up in Northern Israel circa 60,000 years ago....

No one knows what happened when we did meet up....

The Neanderthal (us) disappeared.......and there was a
HUGE jump in mankind's intelligence. The new people.

The missing link is not missing. It's right in your face.....

&quot;And Cain knew his (Neanderthal) wife.&quot;

We disappeared and reappeared, as the intelligent
offspring of Cain....

Look it up
www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Bible/Genesis4.html

http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Bible/Genesis16.html
&quot;Something wicked this way came, and dwells, in Islam.&quot;

You can't deny Islam eXists. And can't deny Islam and
it's angel God, comes straight from the Torah....

An angel of whom, Mr &amp; Mr., Mrs &amp; Mrs ACLU? Not
the God you attack......

You attack the generic God, the one on your currency.
Everybody's God. Includes Allah....

There is only one Almighty God. The Almighty God
of Abraham....

&quot;And there is none else!&quot;
(HaShem)

Vote for me in 08....

Of course not, and you're unlikely to. After all, how

illness, and include your fantasies as part of the study?

Here's what I think: I have had a lifelong personal policy of never
joining any organization or group activity since being forced to
join a xian church against my will at age 13.  I renounced it
immediately and burned their stupid bible in protest, but the event
still scars me today.  I never joined any school clubs or sports
teams, political parties, and definitely not any religious groups
or especially labor unions which use similar coercive tactics with
hints of violence that churches use to recruit members.

There are two groups I am inclined to join now of my own free will,
and one of them is the ACLU to protect me from assholes like you.
The other group calls itself &quot;Cognitive Liberty&quot; and works to defend
freedom of thought, freedom from drug or other therapies designed to
control mind and behavior, and freedom from brain scans to reveal
what one is thinking.  There is one more group I would join, and
that is any group that seriously advocates amending the U.S.
constitution to declare xianity to be illegal and requiring xians to
be rounded up and tossed in gas chambers.  Unfortunately, the ACLU
would oppose such an amendment on &quot;civil rights&quot; grounds.

===================================================================
&quot;The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of the
earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of
independent thought.  There are therefore two great problems which
the Party is concerned to solve.  One is how to discover, against
his will, what another human being is thinking, and the other is
how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without
giving warning beforehand.  In so far as scientific research still
continues, this is its subject matter.&quot;

wow!
I guess i was lucky. I had a Baptist upbringing, but my mom was cool
when i said &quot;no thanks&quot; to the holy rollers and assholes of our local
church.

I joined the Libertarians after realizing that republican, democrat,
and idiot were synonymous; and to this day, i will not vote for
anything but other parties, no matter what! I guess i'm both a joiner,
and one of ole Antons &quot;non-joiners&quot; which is odd..come to think of it,
rather stupid. But, we are who we are, right?

I have to say, as a Satanist, while i find the Church and all
christianity distasteful and annoying, i have no grudge with them. i
think its a waste of time to destroy bibles, blaspheme, and so on. Why
bother? The man was, is, and his followers are patheic!

Well, so much for my twenty two cents (inflation, you know?)

Yes. Teaching masturbating. Get online. Go look at
what they are teaching children. Only public schools.

After the public schools destroy the children....

I didn't make it up. It was an 'eXercise' a principal of
the school was thinking of putting in place. Just the
idea is bad enough....

And you know it comes from a Liberal Jackasshole....

I'll find the quote....sooner or later....
If I can't find it, I'll take that out....

I heard it on a local radio station WTKK 69.9 FM
late last week. Maybe early this week. The Michael
Graham show 5:30am to 10:00am....

I didn't take any notes because I thought I could get
the statement. It's a 41/2 hour show and a majority of
it was on the subject. The woman who came up with
the idea called the show, defending it. And was quickly
made an ass of...

All I want is the quote from her that I paraphrased.
That way there....I'll have her name.....too....

I looked on Mike's blog and couldn't find it. Maybe
it's not up yet.....

Input. You challenged me on something, and now I

That you conveniently ignored....

First of all, nothing wrong with masturbation, although I doubt any child in
kindergarten would've understood the message.

More importantly, however, of course children will destroy us. The future
will eventually fall into their hands, and look at what we have taught
them. Between religion and traditions forced onto them, how does anyone
expect the majority of these precious youngsters to grown up into kind,
sympathetic thinkers? How can we expect them to do better when we have
forced our biases onto them from birth?

Now look at the kind of present we're creating for them to inherit? The US
is at war and on the brink of an economic collapse, and our children will
have to deal with it. In the middle east, women whose girl children will
inherit their future are being raped, tortured, and treated like property.
Meanwhile, the children of Africa starve alongside their parents. You get
the picture.

And let's mention religion here, too, because the mistakes and the so called
original sin will also fall on their shoulders. Religion will hurt them
just as it has hurt us. No matter what they will choose to believe, no
matter how they will build the future, the baggage for the atrocities done
will rest on their shoulders.

In comparison to this, teaching boys and girls about their own bodies so
that they may know of it when they grow up is fairly harmless. What is it
in comparison to the crimes their elders have committed, tell me that.

Did you know Lucifer is mentioned once in Scripture....
But appears twice....

O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cut down
to the ground, and weaken the nations! You say in
your heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my
throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the
mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north. I
will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be
like the Most High.

Here he is again.....as the wannabe Most High....
http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Bible/Genesis16.html
&quot;something wicked this way came, and dwells in the
face of it's brethren....in Islam....&quot;

That's how he became like the Most High HaShem. By
having his own made and chosen borne to the earth...

The curse upon civilized man....it seems like.....

Sweden and the Netherlands have nothing to do with us....

Archaeology and scholarship has begun to reveal ancient herbal methods
of birth control and abortion.
http://www.sisterzeus.com/qaluse.htm for instance.
No appointment, no protester line, no parental consent, no adoption
sermon, no doctor bill. Just nearly free abortion or birth control on
demand. It dont matter what the legal system says any more.
