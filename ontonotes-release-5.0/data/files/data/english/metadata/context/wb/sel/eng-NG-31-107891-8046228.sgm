***************************************************************-
DANCE SECURITY ALERT - between Dec 2006-May 2007
Purses have been taken at dances!

Mike Pyle has composed and distributed this message at his March dance:
It's disappointing that this has become an issue in our community, but
at several
recent west coast swing dances in the SF Bay Area, all different venues
including
Lake Merritt Dance Center, someone has had a purse or bag taken from
wherever
they left it while dancing. Please be careful to not leave valuables
unattended, and
report any suspicious activity that you may observe.

This message was distributed by the Next Generation Swing Dance Club:

Security Alert - from the Next Generation Swing Dance Club
We regret to inform the dance community that there have been several
thefts at recent local West Coast Swing dances, including at our Next
Generation dance. People have lost purses, jackets, and dance bags with
money, credit cards, cell phones, cameras, keys, and other valuables. We
suggest that you:

* Don't leave valuables unattended or out of your sight at a dance.
* Wear dance clothes with pockets for your valuables, or ask a
friend who isn't dancing to watch them for you.
* Leave any valuable items you don't absolutely need at home.
* Make a backup copy of your home and car keys and leave them at a
friend's house, just in case.
* Make a backup copy of phone numbers stored on your cell phone.
* Also, be careful about leaving valuables in your car; there have
been some auto break-ins outside dances as well.
* Please report any problems or suspicious activities to us
immediately, so we can take steps to identify and report the thief to
the proper authorities.

Swing Dances that purse theft has been reported are:
-Next Generation Swing Dance Club Dance - 1st Saturday of the month
Allegro Ballroom, Emeryville
-Michelle's Swing Dance - 2nd Sunday of the month
Imperial Dance Club, Redwood City
-Mike Pyle's Lakeside Swing Dance - 3rd Sunday of the month
Lake Merritt Veteran's Hall, Oakland
-Starlite Ballroom, Sunnyvale

There may be other dances locations involved also.

This situation is very sad and unfortunate. We, in this WCS dance community,
have experienced many years of safety in leaving any of our belongings
at the
dances. This just doesn't seem to be the case anymore ... or at least
for the
time being. Please try not to bring valuables to the dances and be aware of
your surroundings and out of the ordinary activity.

Pass this dance alert to anyone that attends our SF Bay Area dances.

See you out on the dance floor!

It has been reported to me that a person believed to be responsible
for the many missing objects, including my present and former
girlfriends' purses, was caught in the act, arrested, charged, and is
awaiting trial. It was further reported to me that the culprit used
stolen credit cards and that each use is a separate felony.

Obviously that doesn't mean our stuff is safe but it appears to be as
safe as it was before and that was quite, there having been nothing
reported stolen at our Swing and Ballroom dances for something like
eighteen years.
