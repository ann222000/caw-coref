A growing sense of volunteerism

By Tasoula Karaiskaki

It is the most common social reflex: State inefficiency and corruption
gradually lead the citizen to alienation, indifference and apathy. The
more that arbitrariness reigns in public life, the less cooperation we
see from citizens. This is the case until some kind of threat is
perceived on a collective level. Once an atmosphere of danger and the
need for immediate action prevails, then the image of an arrogant,
thick-skinned and sluggish administration rouses the people rather
than immobilizing them. And spontaneous protest is followed by the
desire for voluntary contribution.

Since a five-day blaze reduced Mount Parnitha to ashes, the sense of
volunteerism in Greece has become clearer. It is not that we Greeks
had no faith in voluntary organizations prior to the Parnitha fire – a
poll shows that 67 percent of the public have faith in these groups.
This figure contrasts with the just 53 percent who trust Parliament
and 41 percent who trust the government, according to a recent
Eurobarometer survey.

But volunteers have never enjoyed high regard from the Greek public,
who often sees them as &quot;attention seekers,&quot; &quot;suckers&quot; or &quot;dreamers.&quot;
This is hardly the profile of the volunteers used by many
forward-looking Western governments to improve citizens' daily lives.
Many Greeks have often regarded such initiatives as exploitative and
fraudulent.

But this stance is beginning to change: Widespread misunderstanding is
starting to dissipate. We Greeks are starting to realize something we
have always known deep down – we can achieve more by helping each
other. The whole is always greater than the sum of its parts.
Volunteerism is not a substitute for charity; it is not motivated by
pity, neither is it aimed at realizing emotional gains. It is not a
case of exchanging free time for tax breaks, time off work and other
such benefits. It involves self-motivating people who spontaneously
gravitate toward each other to achieve a common goal, without the need
for any organizational framework or higher body imposing orders.

Volunteerism is something that is fed by daily experience and can
gradually pervade the types of behavior that constitute our social
machine.

Of course it is still early for Greece. The good will and interest of
many is still disorganized; the movement is only now beginning to take
form.

It might not be visible yet but it is under way. It is in the process
of gathering information, debating various issues and trying to
highlight some positive prospects, to escape from the oppressive sense
of the dead end.

It is quite likely that volunteers will soon become the force that
arrives at the solutions for many of the social problems in our
country. Of course, volunteers cannot, and should not, replace
existing institutions. But they can submit these bodies to relentless
tests until they are finally purged of their ills.
