Wikipedia and the art of censorship

It was hailed as a breakthrough in the democratisation of knowledge.
But the online encyclopedia has since been hijacked by forces who
decided that certain things were best left unknown.

Exxon Mobil and the giant oil slick

An IP address that belongs to ExxonMobil, the oil giant, is linked to
sweeping changes to an entry on the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989.
An allegation that the company &quot;has not yet paid the $5 billion in
spill damages it owes to the 32,000 Alaskan fishermen&quot; was replaced
with references to the funds the company has paid out.

The Republican Party and Iraq

The Republican Party edited Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party entry so it
made it clear that the US-led invasion was not a &quot;US-led occupation&quot;
but a &quot;US-led liberation.&quot;

The CIA and casualties of war

A computer with a CIA IP address was used to change a graphic on
casualties of the Iraq war by adding the warning that many of the
figures were estimated and not broken down by class. Another entry on
former CIA chief William Colby was edited to expand his cv.

The Labour Party and careerist MPs

An anonymous surfer at the Labour Party's headquarters removed a
section about Labour students referring to &quot;careerist MPs&quot;, and
criticisms that the party's student arm was no longer radical.

Dow Chemical and the Bhopal disaster

A computer registered to the Dow Chemical Company is recorded as
deleting a passage on the Bhopal chemical disaster of 1984, which
occurred at a plant operated by Union Carbide, now a wholly owned Dow
subsidiary. The incident cost up to 20,000 lives.

Diebold and the dubious voting machines

Voting-machine company Diebold apparently excised long paragraphs
detailing the US security industry's concerns over the integrity of
their voting machines, and information about the company's chief
executive's fundraising for President Bush. The text, deleted in
November 2005, was very rapidly restored by another Wikipedia
contributor, who advised the anonymous editor, &quot;Please stop removing
content from Wikipedia. It is considered vandalism.&quot;

The Israeli government and the West Bank wall

A computer linked to the Israeli government twice tried to delete an
entire article about the West Bank wall that was critical of the
policy. An edit from the same address also modified the entry for
Hizbollah describing all its operations as being &quot;mostly military in
nature&quot;.
