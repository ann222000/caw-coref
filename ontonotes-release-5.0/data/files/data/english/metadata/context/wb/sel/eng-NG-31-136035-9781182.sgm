I'm happy to help with development as well as any of the bottom-up
organization tasks, e.g. blog posts, email lists, and discussion-
focused meetings.  I've never seen much value in top-down
organization, e.g. newsletters and lecture-focused meetings, so I
can't help there.

Peace,
Scott

Scott,

I'll send you an email with access to create posts.

In the mean time, here's a few development ideas the steering
committee has discussed...these ideas/concepts might be beneficial to
Refresh Denver and/or the community at large:

-featured member of the month; a page highlighting a Denver Refresher,
their talents, their skills, their site, their recent project, etc.
-a members area for allowing users to create profiles; this then could
be used for networking and collaborating on projects (e.g., I need to
search for designers, flash designers, database developers, and SEO
specialists to help me with my latest project.)
-a search tool for the community to find qualified talent (i.e., a way
to search the profiles much like the previous networking tool)

There's been some other talked about ideas such as providing a
repository of free templates (see http://www.oswd.org/ for an example)
thus in effect providing a service to the community.

Anyway, as you can imagine there's a lot that we could do to make
Refresh Denver great.  What idea's do you have?

Matthew

That seems like a lot of structure to maintain.

Can't we get the same effect relying on the Google Group and scraping
the site and newsletter? It seems to work well for Refresh Phoenix.

I'm interested in a light-weight, high signal-to-noise resource.

As for meetings, I think there should be a monthly meeting scheduled
at one well known location at a well known time. Somebody should
probably be responsible for setting a meeting theme or topic.

As far as I'm concerned, the location should be:
- public access - no security to go through and locked doors to
manage
- open WiFi
- comfortable chairs and tables
- food and drink [alcohol not necessary - a coffee shop would be
fine]
- inexpensive - preferably free
- projection display a plus, but not mandatory.

I'll contribute to discussions and show up at meetings. I can probably
talk about something occationally.

thanks,
Mike

Great.

Wait, we have a steering committee?  Why isn't that mentioned on the
about page of the site?  Is there information about that somewhere else?

That would seem to depend on first having user profiles:

I know there's a lot of interest in this.  Several people in the Web
Design group are interested in it, and it's also listed as a current
project of the Digital Media Student Group at DU:

http://dms.du.edu/main/students.cfm

I've already spoken to several people about doing something like this
as a collaborative project.  I'd be happy to do that under the
auspices of Refresh Denver if that works out.

I don't understand why we'd localize something like templates.
Doesn't a template from Chicago work just as well in Denver?

I suggest we open source the whole site code base, encourage everyone
to improve it, and apply the best improvements back into the site.
Can we do that?

Peace,
Scott
