my friend just got a new car and he’s offering his grand prix to me
for $500 and if I get it, it’ll be my first car. I don’t exactly
remember the year but I belive it’s early ’90s. There’s no rust or
anything wrong with it except he said there’s a slow oil leak and you
have to check it once every 2 to 3 weeks. I guess he took it in to
have the leak checked out, but nobody could figure out where it was
leaking, but he stressed to me it was only leaking, not burning oil.
It also has an adjustable steering wheel but the lock to hold it in
place is broke so the wheel moves up and down while you’re driving.
Does anyone have any advice for me?

I had a small oil leak in my '92 Grand Prix. It had the 3.1L V6 motor. The
leak turned out to be an oil pump drive seal or something like that. The
little rubber seal only cost 50 or so cents. As for the steering wheel
moving up and down I had that problem too. If you're problem is exactly the
same as mine, it could be very difficult and dangerous to drive the car. I
only drove mine for a couple of days before junking the entire car (there
were other problems as well and well over 300,000).
Grand Prix's are good cars and will last a long time if they are and have
been maintained but I would definitely get that tilt steering wheel problem
looked at if I were you.

The broken steering is a safety hazard; if your state or whatever has
any sort of safety inspection, they may not catch it; but YOU should.
Do NOT drive this car with a broken lock.

Evidence of oil leaking: is there any used oil build-up underneath?
Note that the design of this car makes engine work more expensive; if
you have any reason to remove the heads, it will cost $1500 or more,
probably as much as the car is worth.

Also, watch out for the windows. Replacing power window servos runs
$500 - each. And does it have a computer chip? THAT can run $800 or
more to replace; and it is NOT negotiable: if the chip dies, the car
stops running.

Fun car over all. Maybe worth $500? If you enjoy it, do the repairs and
have fun, but keep in mind that a car that old - especially a Grand Prix
- may not have much time left before the junkyard.
