I have been using Canon's Digital Photo Professional software (v3.0
and now v3.2) along with Photoshop CS2. I use the &quot;Transfer to
Photoshop&quot; function to bring the processed RAW file directly into
Photoshop. It worked perfectly. However, I upgraded to CS3 and
uninstalled CS2. That function no longer works. DPP will bring up CS3,
but no image is transferred. I am running a WinXP system.

Anyone have any insight into this problem?

Thanks in advance.
