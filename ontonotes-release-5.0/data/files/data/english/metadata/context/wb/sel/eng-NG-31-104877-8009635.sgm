_The *FIVE* Great *iSTARi* ( *WIZARDS* ) of Middle Earth_ - Buckner
.
&lt;&lt;I was sorting through some of Tolkien's letters last night and
found the names of the *FIVE iSTARi* or *WIZARDS* of Middle-earth.
There was a white, two blue, a brown, and a grey wizard, whom
supposedly &quot;arrived&quot; in Middle-earth in that order. Only three are
mentioned in The Lord of the Rings: The white, the brown, and the
grey. Two of their names you can guess, but here are all of their
names in order of their appearance in Middle-earth:
.
. [P]allando the Blue,
. [S]aruman the White,
. [A]latar the Blue, and
. [R]adagast the Brown,
. [G]andalf the Grey, who came last.
.
Gandalf the Grey came last. Tolkien says he is more 'aged'
.than the other four and leaned on a wooden *STAFF* .&gt;&gt;

. And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.
. That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,
. Whose smile and frown, like to *ACHILLES' SPEAR*
. Is able with the change to kill and cure.
. *HERE* is a hand to hold a sceptre up
. And with the same to act CONTROWLING laws.

_The *FIVE* Great *iSTARi* ( *WIZARDS* ) of Middle Earth_ - Buckner

&lt;&lt;Saruman, Alatar, and Pallando traveled to the east, possibly to
Mordor to scout the power of Sauron. Saruman was the only one who made
it back to the east and settled at Isengard in the Tower of Orthanc.
Tolkien doesn't say exactly what happens to Alatar and Pallando, the
two blue wizards. He said they possibly fell to the dark powers and
became servants of Sauron, they could have been killed by Sauron,
or that their task was simply to remain in the east. Saruman was
established as the &quot;chief&quot; wizard. Radagast the Brown, who came
fourth, abandoned his task. He disliked Elves, Humans, and Dwarves.
Radagast loved animals though, and he stayed with them and didn't
associate with 'higher-beings.' Saruman calls him &quot;Radagast the
Simple,&quot; &quot;Radagast the Bird-Tamer,&quot; and &quot;Radagast the Foolish.&quot;
All of the *FIVE iSTARi* purpose was to 'kindle' the
hearts of Men and Elves to rival Sauron, but the wizards were not to
fight against Sauron directly. The wizards were sent from Valinor,
the 'undying' lands where elves go when they said into the
west. They were basically sent by the 'gods.' The Istari (wizards)
themselves were Maiar. Sauron was also a Maiar. I interpret them
as 'angels'; at least that's how we would look at it.
.
. Gandalf the Grey came last. Tolkien says he is more 'aged'
. than the other four and leaned on a wooden *STAFF*.
.
When Gandalf arrives at the Grey Havens on the west shores of
Middle-earth, he was met by the master of the Grey Havens who was an
elf named Cirdan. Cirdan was the keeper of the Ring of Fire, or the
Red Ring, which was one of the three elvish rings of power called
&quot;Naryu.&quot; Its power was to kindle the hearts of the people's of
Middle-earth. Though, all three of the elvish ring's main purpose was
to slow the decay of time. Cirdan gave the Ring of Fire to Gandalf to
help him in his 'labors.' Gandalf traveled all over Middle-earth; he
befriended elves, dwarves, men, and discovered the Halflings
(hobbits). Saruman discovered that Gandalf had the Red Ring and began
to envy and resent him. When Sauron started building up power again,
Elrond the Half-elf and Galadriel, the Lady of Lothlorien, created the
White Council. Saruman was placed as its head, though Elrond and
Galadriel would have preferred Gandalf. Saruman advised the council to
wait and watch, because he also sought for the One Ring, the Ring of
Power. By this time, Saruman was already being controlled by Sauron.
In the Tower of Orthanc was one of the seven seeing stones of Arnor,
called the Palantir. The Palantir could &quot;see&quot; into far away lands.
Saruman reached into Mordor and was captured by Sauron, who has the
supreme Palantir that was taken from Minas Ithil. So, Sauron could see
everything Saruman saw, and he knew everything Saruman knew, although
Saruman wasn't loyal to neither the White Council nor Sauron because
he desired the Ring of Power himself. Saurman's treachery wasn't
revealed until he captured Gandalf at Isengard. All of the Istart
(wizards) failed, except Gandalf. That's why he was sent back to
Middle-earth as Gandalf the White, after he slayed the Balrog of
Morgoth. Gandalf finally overthrows Saruman, strips him of his color,
and *breaks his STAFF* . In the end, Gandalf sails back to Valinor
with the other elvish ring-bearers, who were Elrond and Galadriel,
Frodo, and his uncle Bilbo.&gt;&gt;

Fascinating piece.  I have been a huge fan of Tolkein's work for
decades, and am currently reading The Hobbit to my six year old son.
Was there ever any detailed writing about how the White Council
managed to drive Sauran (aka &quot;The Necromancer&quot;) from Dol Goldur in
Mirkwood?

MT

PS - I'm somewhat distressed that Peter Jackson hasn't been assigned
the task of directing The Hobbit.  I'm hoping they come around on
this, or at least give him The Akalabeth.

^^^^^^^^^

I'm a Tolkien fan too, and have some of the lesser-known works waiting
to be read,
so, I can't answer the question.

I suspect that someone here (see the following links...)

can, though, if you don't find an answer in this group...

Thanks for the link.

It's fun reading The Hobbit to my son.  He's seen all three of the
LoTR movies and it's cool to take him back to where it all began.  Me
too, for that matter.  I'm realizing as I read this book that I
haven't opened it in at least 20 years.  I totally forgot about
Beorn's house (we're just leaving there and venturing into Mirkwood).

Ah Elbereth!
