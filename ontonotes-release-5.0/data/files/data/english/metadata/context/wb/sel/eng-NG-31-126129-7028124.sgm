Optimistic Comments from "The Edge"

Unraveling Beliefs

If I were an average white woman living in the United
States in 1850, I would already have been dead for 10
years. Not an ideal position from which to contemplate
optimism about the future, you say. But consider this: In
the snap of 150 years, the life expectancy of this very
group catapulted from a dismal 40 to a respectable 80
years. Given my own privileges, this means that I will
write 30 more responses to the yearly Edge question.
Yippee.

How can life expectancy, seemingly so determined by biology
and the conditions of life, double so fast? Advances in
science and technology are no doubt the drivers of the
rapid changes in nutrition, medical care, and standards of
living that account for this doubling. But such advances
were themselves possible, even imagined, because of
something else: changes in mental states we call beliefs --
beliefs about the worth of a life, beliefs about what it
means to be happy, beliefs about health and prosperity
including about who deserves it and who does not.

Many others in this volume will speak about specific human
accomplishments that are legitimate grounds for optimism. I
am inclined to focus on an aspect of the mind because it, I
believe, is the font of the many possibilities that give us
optimism.

I am bullish about the mind's ability to unravel the
beliefs contained within it -- including beliefs about its
own nature (and I am bullish on this in a year when the CEO
of Goldman Sachs took home 53.4 million as a bonus).

What gives me particular optimism about the future is the
ability of humans everywhere to go against the grain of
their own beliefs that are familiar, that feel natural and
right, and that appear to be fundamentally true. What makes
me optimistic is the possibility that we can (and do)
unravel the contents of traditional beliefs and even the
process by which they were constructed.

We've done this sort of unraveling many times before,
whether it is about the relationship of the sun to the
earth, or the relationship of other species to us. We've
put aside what seemed natural, what felt right, and what
came easily in favor of the opposite. I am optimistic that
we are now ready to do the same with questions about the
nature of our own minds. From the work of pioneers such as
Herb Simon, Amos Tversky, and Danny Kahneman we know that
the beliefs about our own minds that come naturally, feel
right, and are easy to accept aren't necessarily true. That
the bounds on rationality keep us from making decisions
that are in our own interest, in the interest of those we
love, in the long-term interest of our societies, even the
planet, even perhaps the universe, with which we will
surely have greater opportunity to interact in this
century.

Here are some examples of what seems natural, feels right,
and is easy to believe in -- even though it isn't rational
or true.

We irrationally anchor: ask people to generate their social
security number and then the number of doctors in their
city and the correlation between the two numbers will be
significantly positive, when in fact it ought to be zero --
there's no relation between the two variables. That's
because we can't put the first one aside as we generate the
second.

We irrationally endow: give somebody a cheap mug, and once
it's "my mug" through ownership (and nothing else) it
becomes, in our minds, a somewhat less cheap mug. Endowed
with higher value, we are likely to demand a higher price
for it than it is worth or is in our interest to demand.

We irrationally see patterns where non exist: Try to
persuade a basketball player, fan, or statistician that
there isn't anything to the idea of streak shooting;  that
chance is lumpy and that that's all there is to Michael
Jordan's "hot hand".

As natural as it is to anchor, endow, and imagine patterns,
it isn't accurate, it isn't in our interest, and it may not
even be fair. Likewise, research on the implicit beliefs
and preferences we hold has shown that such "mind bugs"
extend to the beliefs and preferences we have about
ourselves, members of our own social groups, and those who
sit farther away on a scale of social distance.

We don't intend to discriminate or treat unfairly, but we
do. Such unintended consequences come from aspects of our
mind that seem natural (helping somebody close to us like a
neighbor or a nephew rather than somebody more distant) and
feels right (fearing somebody who looks physically
different from us strange). Such responses are natural and
feel right because they evolved in a world where such
responses may have been useful.  And yet, they continue to
operate even through the best person for the job isn't
one's family member or friend, where in the strangeness of
other cultures lie the most lucrative business
opportunities.

Becoming aware of the buggy aspects of our minds is the
first step toward unraveling them. How we discover what
needs unraveling, how we do it, and how successful we are
at it are complex issues. But the fact that we do it is
impressive. One of the stories to come out of the 2006
election is that representatives who were successful at
bringing home earmarks to their states didn't necessarily
win because the electorate cared about something larger
than their own backyard.  The ability to think about one's
own long range interest, to self-regulate and delay
gratification, to consider the well-being of the
collective, especially to view the collective as unbounded
by religion, language, or nationality requires a mental
leap that isn't natural or easy. And yet each new
generation seems to be able to do it more successfully than
the previous one. The standards for how we treat ourselves
and others get higher, we examine our beliefs with more and
more powerful lenses, and we turn our minds inside out and
shake out the rot.

Why do we do this? I'll argue that we do this for at least
three reasons. First of all, because newer laws demand it
(we work next to gay co-workers because it is the law and
soon minds are changed). Second, old beliefs come unraveled
because such unraveling is in our self-interest (India is
cool because India generates revenue and soon even
Bollywood is spoken about positively).

Most importantly though, we unravel existing beliefs and
preferences because we wish them to be in line with our
intentions and aspirations and recognize that they are not.
I see evidence of this everywhere -- small acts to be the
person one wishes to be rather than the person one is --
and it is the constant attempt at this alignment that gives
me optimism.

Geomorphic Evidence for Life on Mars

There are three geomorphic forms on Mars I have identified:
the filling of old, deeply eroded craters with uneroded
domes, some only partly burying eroded original true
resurgent domes; channels hundreds of km long filled with
similar dome-like material that are arched in crossection,
the arches rising two and more km above their margins; and
vast areas of Mars between latitudes 25 to 60 degrees
covered with mat-like material approximately one km thick
in many places which buries completely Noachian age impact
craters 5 km in diameter and smaller.

The organic material composing these geomorphic forms is
almost certainly cyanobacteria combined with calcium
carbonate. Stromatolites on Earth, growing today and going
back 3.4 Gyr but on a comparatively miniscule scale, are my
model.

I believe that the growth of these gigantic stromatolitic
forms gradually decreased the carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere of Mars leading to progressive cooling and
finally freezing conditions that ended the growth of the
three geomorphic forms and the mostly warm, wet Noachian
era. The following cold, dry Hesperian and Amazonian eras
for the next 3 plus Gyr to the present time have none of
these geomorphic forms, proving they needed water for their
formation, but water with some other essential materials to
cause their growth.

As several types of meteorites from Mars have been
identified here on Earth, it is likely that Mars has
received meteorites from the bombardment of Earth as well.
The question is, which one seeded the other? We probably
are not going to find the prokaryotic progenitors of the
eukaryotic cyanobacteria here on Earth, but we have a good
chance of finding the progenitors on Mars if they ever
existed there, thus telling us which planet seeded the
other.

The Long View of Demographics

I am optimistic about humankind's ability to reach a
sustainable balance with other life on earth, in part
because the number of humans on earth will soon start to
decrease. This doesn't mean that I think we should ignore
our environmental problem -- just the opposite: I think we
should fight hard now with the confidence that we can win a
complete and lasting victory.

We are so accustomed to watching the explosion of human
growth and development that it is easy to imagine that this
is normal. It is not. We are the first generation in
history that has watched the human population double in our
own lifetime, and no future generation is likely to see it
again. All of those blights of growth that we have come to
accept -- crowded cites, jammed roads, expanding suburbs,
fish-depleted oceans, and tree-stripped forests -- are all
symptoms of a one-of-a-kind surge in human expansion. Soon
they will be just memories.

There are currently over six billion people in the world.
There will probably never be more than ten. Population
forecasts vary, but they all agree that human population
growth is slowing. As people become more prosperous, they
have
