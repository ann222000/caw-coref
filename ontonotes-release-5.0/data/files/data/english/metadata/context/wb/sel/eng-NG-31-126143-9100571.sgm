Hi !
I'm searching the three Part Harmony of the Song &quot;Mr Sandman&quot; sung by
The Chordettes. This is so nice. My Girlfriend would like to sing it
with her friends.
Any Idea ?
Thanks.

Listen to the song and have each one of the girls copy
one of the notes of the bum...bum..bum..chimes.  If each
girl stays on her note when they begin to sing they will
naturally be in harmony.  Years ago, when we harmonized,
we tended to pick songs that allowed us to &quot;get our note&quot;
by &quot;chiming in&quot;,  as in &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; by The
Bop-Chords or getting our note from the lead singer or
bass singer, sort of like a pitch pipe,  as in &quot;My Juanita&quot;
and &quot;Zoom Zoom Zoom&quot;.  &quot;Mr. Sandman&quot; should be a
cinch to harmonize to.  I hope they have fun!

Do they know anything about chords &amp; harmony? If they don't, and if they
then try to sing it without anyone playing the chords, they are very likely
to sing wrong harmony parts. Many people (without technical musical
knowledge) are able to sing 2 or 3 part harmony on simple 3 or 4 chord
songs, but songs like this have many more chord changes.

It's been a while since I've heard the song, but playing
it back in my head it doesn't sound like there are any
chord changes.  It's just straight four part harmony.
When you start getting into &quot;barbershop&quot; harmony
there are a *lot* of necessary chord changes to make
a song sound good, but I think they can do this without
doing anything intricate.  When The Chordettes started
out they did &quot;barbershop&quot; harmony, but from what I've
read they were convinced to do straight four part harmony
for Mr. Sandman and made it a hit. So to do this song the
ladies can just chime in, one octave over the next, and it'll
work.  Of course that bum...bum...bum part will drive 'em
nuts if they haven't sung together before, and they ain't
gonna sound anything like The Chordettes who had
harmony tighter than a clam's ass. (-:

Oh, it's got a few chord changes , Ed. Don't see how you could do
justice to the melody with three or four chords. But maybe 7 or 8.

The bums---
Bb - Gm - Cm - F
Bb - Gm - Cm - F

Bbmaj7       A7
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream,
D7                       G7
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
C7                             F7
Give him two lips like roses in clover,
Bb                                             C#           F
Then tell me that his lonesome nights are over.

Bbmaj7   A7
Sandman, I'm so alone,
D7                   G7
Don't have nobody to call my own.
Cm                        Ebm
Please turn on your magic beam,

Yikes!.  Jim!  Are you kidding!!??  All of my formal music
training was from listening to records and trying to
copy the sound.  I probably even used the term
&quot;octave&quot; the wrong way.   So keeping this as simple
as possible, I'm hearing that each one of The
Chordettes starts singing with the word &quot;mister&quot; on a
different note of the scale, exactly one higher than the
next, as in girl one is do, girl 2 is re, girl 3 is mi, and
girl 4 is fa, and that as they sing, the relationship of
one girls note to another never changes.  They are
always seperated by one note, which is exactly one
note higher than the previous one.  When I think of a
chord change, or at least what I always *thought* was
a chord change, at least one of the girls would change
that relationship in some way.  Now you understand
that this is not a statement, but rather a question.  So
do you hear something different than a simple four
part harmony?

Right. When they do the bums the four ascending notes in the first
chord (Bbmaj7), are in the root or tonic and the second four
descending bums are notes in the second chord (Gm) , the relative
minor (6th), the third four ascending notes in the Cm7 (the minor 3rd)
and all the last four would make the F chord or the fifth in the Bb
scale. Make those all major chords and you've got &quot;Rhythm&quot; changes as
in &quot;I Got Rhytm.&quot;  So many tunes are based on those changes.

Get outta here man!  The only &quot;tonic&quot; that I know
is gin and tonic.  What  I *can* see, is that to copy
them exactly would be harder than I intially thought.
Sometimes you can hear the harmony by just listening
to the record, like in something simple like &quot;Castle in
the Sky&quot;, because it's all given to you in the opening
&quot;chime in&quot; and it doesn't vary in the song.  Other times
the harmony can give you fits.  We had a helluva time
figuring out &quot;Tonight (could be the night)&quot;.  Other times,
when most of the group is singing in &quot;false&quot;, like
The Beach Boys, it's *really* tough to follow.

Nearly every song has chord changes, except things like &quot;Land of a Thousand

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It's just straight four part harmony. &lt;&lt;

There are various styles of 4-part harmony, some of which are still
triad-based, just adding a bass part (or whatever) without adding another
note to the chord.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Barbershop harmony can be used on simple songs or songs with more chords,
but the actual harmony is still mostly triad-based, and is not complex.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That would be a lot of octaves! (You don't really mean that).

That's actually probably the easiest part of the harmony.

My apology if I'm repeating things that may be covered in some of the other
responses to this thread, but whenever a thread draws that many replies, I
usually drop out, except for possibly looking at those of a few members whom
I trust to make positive contributions, like Jim Colegrove or Marc
Dashevsky.

It is.  As Bruce pointed out, thinking that he
was embarassing me, but actually poining
out the simple truth.  I have *no* formal
training in music at all.  Everything we did
was by ear, or as Bruce says &quot;winging it&quot;.
This was true of amatuer singing groups
like mine, and probably true of *most*
1950's vocal groups that formed in the
NYC streets.

But now you have my interest.

Isn't a chord simply three different notes
sung in harmony at the same time?
If that's true then just the act of singing
a song in harmony is going to be a series
of chord changes.  Am I right here?  Try
to keep it simple.  I'm not familiar with
musical terms.

Thanks

Nobody is claiming that you can't sing well. I have no idea, but I

I don't know why I'm bothering with this, but OK.

NYC, and probably *all* cities with poor
tenement neighborhoods breed vocal groups
as you pointed out in another thread.  My
bet is that very very few vocal groups,
whether amateurs like we were, or
professionals like The Bop Chords or
Channels or even Frankie Lymon and the
Teenagers had *any* formal training.  Do
you think that a group like The Jesters, right
out of the Harlem tenements, got their vocal
training at Julliard??!!  All of us, pro or not,
learned how to sing together by listening to
other groups and by trial and error, all by
ear.  Are you telling me that this is all a
surprise to you?

&gt; I don't know why I'm bothering with this, but OK.

&gt; NYC, and probably *all* cities with poor

&gt; as you pointed out in another thread.

No, I don't think it was happening in Moscow, or in many American
cities either.

&gt; bet is that very very few vocal groups,
&gt; whether amateurs like we were, or
&gt; professionals like The Bop Chords or
&gt; Channels or even Frankie Lymon and the
&gt; Teenagers had *any* formal training.  Do
&gt; you think that a group like The Jesters, right
&gt; out of the Harlem tenements, got their vocal
&gt; training at Julliard??!!  All of us, pro or not,
&gt; learned how to sing together by listening to
&gt; other groups and by trial and error, all by
&gt; ear.  Are you telling me that this is all a
&gt; surprise to you?

No, it's no surprise at all, and I assume that you are at least as off
key as the Bop-Chords and Channels were.

Yep.  I knew I was wasting my time.  You
hear what you want hear and address the
points that you want to address.  No
surprise there either.  You're going to
ignore the most important point in the
post.  That kids like us learned to sing
by example and by ear.  No formal
training.  If you acknowledge that you
lose your rational for annoying me.
That's pretty weak Bruce.  Don't think
for a minute that everyone can't see it
either.  You're all bullshit and a mile
wide.

Oh, by the way, you're also chickenshit.

No one is saying that the groups were formally trained, but the
gentlemen in those groups were not going around telling people &quot;you
don't know a chord from an octave&quot; when they themselves had no idea
about what either term actually meant.

&gt;&gt;  Everything we did was by ear, or as Bruce says &quot;winging it&quot;.
&gt; This was true of amatuer singing groups
&gt; like mine, and probably true of *most*
&gt; 1950's vocal groups that formed in the
&gt; NYC streets. &lt;&lt;
">

Yes, it is. And most of those songs were very simple songs that could be
done that way. In fact, it wasn't too unusual for some of those kind of
groups to sometimes try a song (like an old standard) that was more
harmonically complex, and they nearly always did them incorrectly, leaving
out chords and altering the melody to fit simple chords.

I've backed many oldies groups (some of them when they were not-so-oldie).
Once in '86 we were backing a version of Little Caeser &amp; the Romans and,
while running through songs before the show, one of them went over to the
keyboard to demonstrate the chords. I was quite surprised, as it was the 1st
time I had run across one of those groups where a member actually played an
instrument and knew music. It turned out to be Lou Johnson (&quot;Always
Something There To Remind Me&quot;, etc.), who would fill in with many of those
groups around L.A.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Isn't a chord simply three different notes
&gt; sung in harmony at the same time? &lt;
">

The most basic chords are triads, consisting of - yes - 3 notes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If that's true then just the act of singing
&gt; a song in harmony is going to be a series
&gt; of chord changes.  &lt;&lt;

I'm not sure how you mean that, but I get the impression that you're
thinking that the chord changes with each melodic change, which is not
necessarily true. The voicing of the chord (meaning the arrangement of the
notes) may change, while the overall chord is still the same.
