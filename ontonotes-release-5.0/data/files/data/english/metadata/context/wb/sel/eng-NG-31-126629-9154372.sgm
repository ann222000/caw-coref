I have a Betta who was tankmates with several other fish who over
time, have died. I decided to replace them with female Bettas hoping
that would be more fun for all. I kept the females together but
separate for a week while they sorted out who was alpha female then
added them to the main tank. Rocky chased the girls around for the
first few days and nipped them a bit but eventually things settled
down. Now it has been a couple of weeks and Rocky's long beautiful
fins are nearly gone. I have been watching them and I have never seen
a female nip him and he still seems to be the boss of the tank. Could
it just be stress? Or are the girls just waiting until I'm not
looking? I'm not sure what to do.

How big is the tank?  It wouldn't surprise me if the females are
nipping him.

I agree with Melissa's thinking. I have a couple of females who can be just
as nasty or more nasty than my males. I generally have peace in the 55 gal
community tank where they are because I have a lot of places for them to
hide.

Also, when you added the females to the main tank you gave them the chance
to change the 'seniority' among them. A change of environment may have made
a shy one braver and a bully scared in the bigger tank.

You'll also find that many people who have Betta's think it's a very bad
idea to keep males and females together. It's very unlikely they'll live
peacefully. It's also very unlikely a mating would be able to occur with
other fish around and all of the motion in a big tank. In the wild Betta's
tend to be solitary fish and even 'tho the Betta's sold now aren't likely to
be wild caught, they haven't lost the part of them that makes them this way.

I've watched them all day and they haven't nipped the male once. When
he swims near they move away.

When I had a beta once I put a female in with him and soon after the
morning after I found him swimming around with hardly any fins and she
(the female now) died a while later (she apparently rammed herself
against the aquarium cover and died). It took the male about a week to
totally re-grow his fins. Healthy females were especially hard for me
to find back then. They usually behaved like they were in shock all of
the time. Nowadays things should be very different in that regard.
Good luck all and later!

Maybe, they were long and delicate. He's been spending some time in
the plastic plants.

My first guess is that it is the female Bettas that have attacked the
male (although there may be other fin nippers in your tank) -
especially if they weren't ready to mate and he was......another
consideration is that one of your females might actually be a male.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From what I've heard you can have mixed results adding females in with
">

a male as a permanent arrangement (Tynk where are you as you could
best answer this?)......you should always have a back up plan when
adding bettas into the same tank as you just don't know which way it
will go. You don't say how large the tank is - even mixing a group of
females can be a problem in a smaller tank although it depends on the
actual fish you buy.......I had 3 females in a 135g tank and one of
them got picked off by the other two girls but this was while we were
on holiday so I wasn't able to observe the behaviour and rescue the
subordinate fish....the remaining two do squabble but there is enough
room for them to run off and hide if it all gets a bit too much....in
a smaller tank they don't have this option......

If you can, I would remove either the females or the male. Even if you
remove the male temporarily this will give him a chance to
recover.....watch out for any infections.....clean water (ie. lots of
water changes) will aid his recovery and help prevent infection/fungal
growth - you might consider adding Pimafix/Melafix as a preventitive
measure or as a curative measure if he is already infected.....

I would doubt that the betta has injured himself on the plastic plants
unless they are very sharp, in which case they probably shouldn't be
in the tank anyway.......Bettas do not have the common name of Siamese
Fighting Fish for nothing.....

It's a five gallon tank.

They all seem to have reached an equilibrium. None are nipping now.
The male is starting to grow his fins back so I'll keep a close eye on
them but it looks like it's going to be ok.

One interesting thing is that the alpha female has had a growth spurt.
I originally picked three females that were similar in size so they
could hold their own against each other. But the white one has grown
much larger and is about 3/4 the size of the male. She looks like a
female though, her fins are short and she has a petite look compared
to the male.

Personally I wouldn't try mixing male/female bettas in a tank that
size but YMMV depending on the personalities of the fish.....I
wouldn't even risk mixing females together in a tank as small - also I
wonder about whether 3 females and 1 male betta in a 5 gall tank might
not be stretching the stocking level of that tank.......

You can get short finned male bettas......my &quot;girls&quot; are just as
pretty as any male I've ever owned, so much so I rather suspect that
they might be a pair of males who are just trucking along in a 6 foot
tank because they can run away.....and they do chase and have spats
with one another and as I think I mentioned they did kill off the
other betta......
