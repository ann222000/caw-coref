I took some hamburger (well really a ground beef and pork mix about 1 lb)
mixed in a egg, some bread crumbs, some toasted dried minced onion, fresh
minced garlic and aleppo pepper... rolled it out thin. Sprinkled it with
some store bought mixed shredded cheese I needed to get rid of and some
cooked spinach then folded it in half so I have a kinda flat stuffed meat
loaf and put it in the oven....Never done this before...seems like it
might be nice.

I've never taken a rolling pin to beef before tonight, honest.
I was remembering the days of my youth and a booklet on 101 ways to cook
hamburger and a vague recollection of pizza burgers...rolled out
hamburger  sprinkled with cheese and pizza sauce then folded and cut into
squared burgers from the booklet.

Thinking about side dishes for it...maybe a mix of fried onions with
mushrooms to garnish the top the flattend meatloaf.

Do I need to make a gravy, like in salsbury steak?

Sounds tasty, but then I love anything to do with spinach.  I was going to
grill a couple of NY strip steaks tonight but it decided to pour down rain.
I'm not a die-hard &quot;I'll grill in any weather!&quot; person so either the broiler
pan or my trusty cast iron skillet will have to do.

I'm not bringing home a doggie bag since I don't have a dog... oh, and I'm
cooking at home ;)

Hey Andy,

I should have taken a pic- meat was medium rare after resting 15 and
sliced fairly thin. The red wine shallot sauce was fabulous!

Oh pshaw, on Mon 22 Oct 2007 02:27:15p, hahabogus meant to say...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I would make an onion or mushroom gravy.

Tonight we had thick baked pork chops that I had rubbed with olive oil,
garlic, cracked pepper, fresh lemon zest, and fresh chopped sage, then
refrigerated several hours before baking.  I made a pan gravy from the
drippings, to be served over chops and steamed rice.  Our veggie was
stirfried Chinese long beans with toasted sesame seed and a bit of sesame
oil.  Dinner was preceded by a mixed green salad and the afore-posted Green
Goddess Dressing.  Simple meal, but very tasty.

I wouldn't -- the fried onions and mushrooms sound perfect. Tell us
how it turns out, it sounds yummy...

Heh, that would be a neat trick.  I made the mistake of not asking the
butcher to wrap them separately when I purchased them.  Then I made the
mistake of not re-wrapping them separately before I froze them.
