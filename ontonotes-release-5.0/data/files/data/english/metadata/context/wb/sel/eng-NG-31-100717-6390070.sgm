Political Chowder

By Stirling Newberry
Created Mar 12 2007 - 11:08am

The primary season has started, or rather, what is replacing the primary
season has started. Once upon a time, political conventions were the way
that bosses and officials from different, geographically isolated, regions
of the country got together to talk turkey, cut deals, and decide on who the
national candidate was. The convenions were centers of power, and therefore,
of interest. But since 1960 - last time a major party convention was truly
in doubt as to its outcome, because Kennedy did not arrive with enough
delgates in hand - the conventions have been more and more a coronation, and
the primaries were where the nominee was decided - New Hampshire assumed
importance because it was a test of middle America's faith in the beltway.

The same process that turned convention into coronation has gone to work on
the primaries, now the early winner, is the winner. If no one can dislodge
the front runner early, then it is over. This cycle a one day super-primary
[1] will pick the nominee. And so the trend of 2004 is continued - with the
"pre-primary season" being more important, and where the action is. That is
why I'd like to introduce you to one of the most important new shows in a
long time: Arnie Arnesen's Political Chowder [2] - it is where politicians
are going to get a lever on what is now the highest stakes horse race in the
history of the world.

New Hampshire's history as the place where favorites go to die is a long
one. It told Truman that he could not have a second term in his own right -
a virtual third term. It told LBJ the same thing. It told the country that
Carter didn't have the support of his own party, and set him on the road to
defeat. It told the elder Bush the same thing. In short, four times, New
Hampshire has been instrumental in sending a sitting President home. It was
a warning to Gore that he did not heed in 2000, and to Dole in 1996. In all
six front runners in 50 years have had their dreams of the White House
hammered in New Hampshire. No other state has been consistently as decisive.

New Hampshire survived as the first test in the media age precisely because
it is not a media state. It does not even have broadcast television stations
based in state from all of the major networks. It's northern tier is out of
reach of airwaves from major markets. For the Democratic Party, increasingly
needing white working swing voters to win, it was a gut check on how they
would do outside of cities. For Republicans, increasingly dependent on
motivating their libertarian conservative supporters to back insider high
roller policies, it was a key signal as to whether Main Street was happy
with the Wall Street-K Street core of power. For the parties it served as a
way of winnowing out would be personages with money, but no people. As media
politics grew more expensive, the role of the rolling hills of New Hampshire
was an essential way to keep the cost of candidacy in check.

We are now seeing the break down of media politics, and to which I say that
it is time. Television once liberated by focusing its lens on the dirty
corners of American existence - the gruesome cost of Vietnam, the grinding
deprivation of America's apartheid system in the south and in industrial
cities. It captured the dynamics of a baby boom that had numbers, but not
yet political power. However, Jefferson's warning that a little revolution
is necessary has come to flower for this age. What was once a new world and
a new political scene, is now the old politics. Comfortable, familiar, and
controlled. We have not seen the costs of Katrina the way we saw the costs
of segrationism, we have not been show the blood being hosed off the streets
of Iraq after a car bomb, or the bodies coming home.

The response to this breakdown has been a new politics, one which, instead
of the top spraying its message at fire hydrant pressure down, or a bottom
which had a bumper sticker populist veto, and nothing more - is being formed
by coheisve and coherent public conversation built up of a myriad of
individual connections. The public used to be able to get a couple of words
in edgewise, now it can create its own discussion, its own response. It was
not the networks that soured the public on Iraq and Bush, but the rise of a
social sector that could shock the centers of power, and which will hammer
them to toe the line.

What was, in short, "alternate media" is now a new medium. It is not the
"alternative" to a "mainstream", but, instead, its own river, which is
rushing to carve new channels of power. Power which does not come from
people in small offices making decisions and issuing orders.

New Hampshire itself has been changing. Once valued because it was a back
eddy of the mainstream, it is more and more representative of the wide
netropolitan economy. It's employment is rising from software, internet
business and finance more than military Keynesianism and resource
extraction. It is no longer a piece of the upper midwest in the east, but a
microcosm of what was once called "the new economy". As a result, New
Hampshire has gone blue. Both houses of its legislature, its governor, both
members of the House of Representatives - are Democrats. And in 2008, the
political dynasty of the Sununu family may well be cut short, as John Sununu
is recognized as one of the most endangered incumbents in the country.
That's right, rock ribbed New Hampshire has show that it isn't rock headed,
and can smell a loser all the way from the beltway.

Arnie Arnesen has been at the forefront of this change in New Hampshire, a
prophet of a different world, based on hard headed thinking, and red blooded
popullsm. She was instrumental in supporting netroots, grassroots and true
to her roots Rep Carol Shea-Porter - at a time when the beltway had written
off the pluck and forthright candidate for New Hampshire's First District.
Arnie ran for governor as the Democratic nominee - back in 1992 when that
title was code for "sacrificial lamb". And then took to the airwaves to be a
majority of one campaign for reason, reality and responsive government.

Her latest project is a new television show, one that pulls in key players
from across the political spectrum to have it out under the eye of a woman
who is as good at being a fair moderator as she can be a quick witted
partisan. Her view is that only by getting power brokers and people to talk
to each other, rather than at and over each other as cable news shows do -
can the public really decide. Instead of raining down message down to people
below, she is an example, and exemplar of Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s "vital
center".

In only 4 weeks the political chowder site has exploded in its number of
hits and the show has already brought in or has coming up a former governor,
a Presidential candidate, elected officials, thinkers and writers. Coming up
she already has Katrina Swett - wife of a former representative, and now
candidate for Senate in New Hampshire.

It is the hotest political discussion on television today, and it manages
to, surprisingly, generate as much light as heat. No one who was familiar
with her radio show would have expected anything different, but with this
program Arnie has upped the ante, with better production values, better
presentation, better format. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself.
[3] It is also a gutsy and entrepreneurial move - she owns the show and put
her own money behind it. Instead of waiting for someone with money to bless
and create progressive and public media - Arnie has gone out and placed her
faith in making things happen.

Multiply awared, praised and feted, resting on her reputation was not for
her. On the radio she was called "the best Air America host not on Air
America" - and on television, she can get the right to play away games, when
normally they like to stay safely in Fox News, the World Wide Wrestling of
political sports, because it is only meant to look like a contest.

The way to change the conversation of power in America is to keep the fire
burning where it has already started, and spread the sparks on the dry
tinder of an America that is fed up with a generation of reactionary
government and slowly dimming hopes. Arnie Arnesen has stepped up to the
plate and ladelled out a bowl of the best, in a way that proves that the
changing dynamics of politics can give us a different, and better, way
towards our new America.
