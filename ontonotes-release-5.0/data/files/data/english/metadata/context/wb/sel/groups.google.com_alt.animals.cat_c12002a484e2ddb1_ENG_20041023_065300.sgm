My neighbour here in the UK (who I've never liked) has a cat. (I love
cats.)

For the past week, I've been woken up every morning at about 5.00 am
by his cat meowing almost continuously outside, wanting to get inside
out of the cold and wet. His owners's house adjoins my own, so the
meowing is only a few yards from my bedroom window. Besides being
annoyed at having my speep disturbed, I feel very sorry for the cat.
This morning, it was meowing loudly, out in the rain, for three and a
half hours, before its owner eventually got up and let it in, with a
carefree whistle, as if nothing was amiss.

Saying something to the neighbour is unlikely to have much effect,; I
once complained to hime about his uncontrolled noisy kids, and his
response was haughty, arrogant and uncaring. If this business
continues as the weather gets colder and wetter, would I be justified
in reporting it to the R.S.P.C.A. - and would they be likely to do
anything?

Thank you...

JimT

I would tell anyone who cared I love cats and IO get upset if it's cold in
the house . I will bundle my little kitty up and carry her around until
she's warm. If it is thundering or raining outside I go get her out of the
living room where she's usually ready to freak out and take her back to my
room. In fact I did this this morning. The wind was violent and the rain
was fierce. The thunder was loud and deafens. I am as I like to say
&quot;stormaphobic &quot; and I say that because storms scare the craps out of me so I
just assume that the storm scares the crap out of everybody else in my life.
Which in my case it probably does. My grandfather is scared to death of them
and he carries a mini weather radio with him where he goes. My brother
watches nothing but weather channel and sit at the computer and stare out
the window looking for dark clouds. My cat abby and my other cat Baby are
some how like me. Abby is scared of everything and Baby is scared of
thunder and we used to have to put her in the garage because she would claw
the garage door . Abby goes wild if she hears a noise. Ever since we had
moved Baby gave up going to the garage and turns to the basement for
protection. I think you should call animal services and tell them what your
neighbor is doing. If you want to talk to your neighbor first tell him that
you will take the cat and that he and his children can come see him when
ever they want to. I hope it helps and if it doesn't reply back and chew my
butt of if you want to.

What the hell's the matter with you and your whole family? I'm not
the faintest afraid of storms...

Your replies show how sick you are! Go bother someone else!
