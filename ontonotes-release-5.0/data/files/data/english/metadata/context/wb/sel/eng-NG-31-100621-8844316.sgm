Apple is near release of a toolset that would allow third-party
developers to develop native applications for the iPhone, according
to reports on Apple blogs. However, PC and Mac users accustomed to
downloading any ol' app they can find on the Internet will be in for
an unpleasant surprise with their iPhones -- they'll only be able to
download and run apps that are sanctioned by Apple, and only through
iTunes.

Currently, the iPhone only runs the standard application set that
Apple puts on it at manufacture. Hackers developed workarounds to
allow users to install third-party applications. Apple doesn't like
those workarounds, and has shut them down with later version of the
iPhone software, resulting in the usual game of hacker-vendor
leapfrog.

But Apple has been &quot;furiously working&quot; with partners on games and
apps for the iPod and iPhone, the Apple news site 9 to 5 Mac
reported. For example, EA is porting their line if iPod games to the
OS X-based iPhone and new generation of OS X-based iPods. &quot;Other big
developers with strict confidentiality agreements are also working
with Apple,&quot; 9 to 5 Mac said.

Apple is copying T-Mobile's application development and distribution
model for the SideKick, 9 to 5 Mac reported. Sidekick developers need
to prove themselves by submitting a working application to T-Mobile,
and the Sidekick team responds by giving the developers a key to open
their Sidekick to further testing. Once the developers believe they
have a stable app, the Sidekick team tests the app for compatibility.
If the app passes muster, T-Mobile makes it available for download
and installation, with the cost added to a customer's monthly bill.
And the Danger team works with developers to ensure compatibility and
stability, 9 to 5 Mac said.

And that explains why Apple has been so aggressive in shutting down
hackers opening the third-party applications to development, 9 to 5
Mac says: Apple will get a cut of third-party app developers'
revenues -- up to two-thirds of the take.
