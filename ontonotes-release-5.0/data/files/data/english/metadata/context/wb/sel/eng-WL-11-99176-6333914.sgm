What happens when foreign troops occupy a country? Things like this : "The Army apologised yesterday for raiding the home of a prominent MP from Basra and arresting his family. Officers blamed an intelligence blunder.

"Army officers did not explain how they mistook Mansour Abdulrazzaq Mansour, one of the British Army's closest allies in Iraq's second city, for an insurgent.

"The MP, a member of the Shia coalition, said British tanks and helicopters surrounded his house before soldiers blew open the front door with explosives.

"'They smashed the windows of the cars parked in the garage, smashed the computer to the ground and took $260,000 from the house ,' said Mr Mansour, who comes from one of southern Iraq's wealthiest families.

"'The reason for the violation of my immunity has not been explained and my money has not been returned. I demand compensation.' He said his children were also detained and had been left scarred by the experience.

"'Basically we are very sorry,' a spokesman said from the Army headquarters in Basra. 'We made a mistake, we apologise for it and we will do our best to make sure something like this does not happen again.' All 11 members of Mr Mansour's family had been released." Yes, "mistakes happen". Starting with the biggest one (which was no more a "mistake" than this incident) of invading Iraq in the first place. British troops (and American ones and the rest of the "coalition") do not belong in Iraq, and never did, and remaining there for even one more day simply guarantees more needless death and destruction. Fortunately in this case it was only destruction, and not death.

Not quite sure where you got that from this post. The answer is, of course, "no". NOTHING that the occupation forces are doing is acceptable. If we want someone handing out soccer balls and candy, there are a lot of people better suited for that task than American and British soldiers. Like the Iraqi people, just to name a few.

Well, I think it's only fair that the Iraqis help foot the bill for the "liberation" and increased terrific way of life the Coalition has given them. If these rich folks don't fork it over, then it's necessary to go in and get it.

You know, the last line, about all 11 of Mansour's family members being released, is the kind of line you'd use in a satire. I wonder what Tom Lehrer, who stopped writing satire when Henry Kissinger won the Nobel Peace Prize, is thinking today.

You think and write well, Eli.
