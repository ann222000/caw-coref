It used to be that people thought workers were demonstrating loyalty and
nobility if they showed up for their job even when they felt sicker than a
dog. More and more, people think you're not very smart if you do that! Now
you may be one of those who drags yourself into work no matter how sick you
are. You're there, all right, but so are your coughs, your sneezes, and your
&quot;cooties.&quot; Strangely, over the next few days, one co-worker after another
comes down with symptoms that look suspiciously like what you brought to
work with you. The poet was right, &quot;no man is an island!&quot; You're contagious!

I'm Ron Hutchcraft and I want to have A Word With You today about &quot;What
People Catch From You.&quot;

The truth is we're all contagious even when we're healthy. It's not just
physical germs we spread; we spread an attitude wherever we are! And while
the process of people around you catching your attitude may be as invisible
as the transmission of germs, the results are just as real. They can get
sick&quot; from being around you, or they can actually feel better because they
ve been around you.

General Dwight Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in
World War II, revealed an important understanding of the leadership that we
all exercise when he said this: &quot;Optimism and pessimism are infectious and
they spread more rapidly from the head downward than in any other direction.
A husband infects his wife with whatever attitude he brings home - positive
or negative. If you're wondering why she's acting in a way you don't like,
maybe you should look in the mirror for the answer. A parent spreads their
attitude to their children, a boss to his employees, a worker to his or her
co-workers, a Christian leader to those who serve with him. A friend infects
other friends with the health or the sickness of their attitude.

In 1 Samuel 30, beginning with verse 6, our word for today from the Word of
God, we can see a vivid picture - both positive and negative - of how the
attitude contagion works. In this case, the sick attitude almost destroyed
David's little band of soldiers. But one healthy attitude saved the day and
it turned the tide of the battle. While David and his men have been gone,
their bitter enemies, the Amalekites, have invaded their camp, captured
their families, and plundered their camp. Verse 6 tells us that &quot;David was
greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him; each one was
bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters.&quot; You've got bitterness
here, blaming, despair - those deadly viruses were spreading from one
soldier to another because of the way they responded to a tragedy or a
defeat.

&quot;But,&quot; the Bible says, &quot;David found strength in the Lord his God.&quot; He spread
that strength to his men and he led them in a surprise attack that routed
the Amalekites and took back everything the enemy had stolen. When you get
your perspective on the situation from God rather than your feelings or the
circumstances, you can turn the tide with a winning attitude.

Which leads to the question of the day: &quot;What kind of attitude are you
spreading where you are?&quot; Joy or discouragement? Confidence or maybe fear?
Encouragement or negativity? Is it tenderness, or is it harshness? Stress or
peace? Do you spread faith or unbelief? Do you spread prayer or do you
spread worry?

You are affecting the people you live with, the people you work with, the
people you serve with. You are contagious, whether you realize it or not.
Make their hearts lighter, not heavier. Give them reason to hope, reason to
believe, not reason to despair. Those in whom the living Christ dwells have
no excuse for spreading germs that make people sick in
