"I can't be the only person put off by the tag line we're now seeing on John Kerry bumper stickers and lawn signs. It reads: 'Kerry/Edwards. A stronger America.' A stronger America? A stronger America? The last thing this country or this world needs is a stronger America. I can think of a lot of other things I'd like to see first. How about a smarter America? Or a wiser America? Heck, I'd settle for a saner America. One with more moral courage. A fairer America. More equitable. Less arrogant. Less obsessed with materialism. More just, more committed to democracy and peace, less prone to violence. I'd even settle for an America that doesn't embarrass me when I travel elsewhere in the world.

"America doesn't need more strength. It's got too much already. We're too muscle-bound for our own good. All our guns and material goods are making us stupid and lazy when it comes to solving our problems. We use only hammers, and therefore see all problems as nails. But there's a lot of things hammers can't do. A strong dose of humility, and a wider selection of tools, would do us a lot of good.

"So would a president that doesn't see our problems as stemming from a lack of strength."

It depends on what your definition of "stronger" is -- or for that, your definition of "America." If "America" is the land of the free, then "strength" IN THIS ASPECT is a good thing. If "America" is "the richest, biggest, baddest bully in the neighborhood," then "strength" is hardly the recipe for success (think "muscle-bound").

Personally, I'd like to see America flex her freedom muscles, her economic-rights-for-all biceps and her justice-for-all pects, you know? And avoid use of her kick-the-downtrodden leg muscles.

Of course, those muscles, those good muscles, have grown pretty flabby of late, so I guess I'd have to say, "Fat Chance!"

Sigh.

The slogan isn't for the rank and file.

The slogan is for the undecided voter.
