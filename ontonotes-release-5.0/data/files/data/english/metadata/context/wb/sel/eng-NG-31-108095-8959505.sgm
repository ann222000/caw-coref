Hello All,

A freind of mine wants me to do an alteration on a graphite spey rod of
his.     It would involve moving the metal reel seat further up the
blank.  The seat may be epoxied on.  I have a feeling that I may have to
destroy the existing reel seat and glue another one on.  Do any of you
know differently?  It is a Loomis.  If I can remove the reel seat with
heat or a solvent, I would just as soon do that.

I'd try controlled heat, from a hot air gun.  Seems like this is officially
ROFF epoxy day.

I have repaired three older Loomis rods, ( one was a spinning rod),
and modified one ( new reel seat, and butt extension,on a fly rod),
and they all used masking tape as bushing on the reel seats. I don´t
know whether they all do, or whether they still do.  But several other
manufacturers, and many amateur rod builders use it.   Whatever, the
easiest way to remove the reel seat is to put it in boiling water for
a while. This will also break epoxy down, given time. It rarely takes
longer than about twenty minutes.  This does not destroy the reel
seat, and is harmless to the blank.  take it out after about ten
minutes, and ( using a cloth!, it´s hot!!!), twist gently.  If it
moves, then you can give it a couple more minutes, and then just ease
it off.

Old epoxy etc must be removed mechanically. The only solvents which
attack set-up epoxy also attack the blank. Keep the corks out of the
boiling water, as this will also soften the epoxy on them!

the corks below the reel seat will have to be replaced.

If you have not done such a modification before, then I would advise
you to make it perfectly clear to your friend that you are doing it as
a favour, and at his risk!  There is not much to go wrong really, but
it is better to be on the safe side.

Don´t be tempted to use any greater heat than boiling water, which is
automatically limited to ~ 100°C.  DON`T USE HOT AIR PISTOLS ETC!!!!!

I just replaced the corks and the reel seat on this old Loomis IMX F
1209 spinning rod.  The lower corks were removed by splitting them
carefully with a carpet knife. The rest was removed by scraping with a
knife held perpendicular to the blank. The reel seat was then placed
in boiling water for a while, and then removed. (Carefully twisted off
as described above.  The old reel seat was on epoxied masking tape
bushings. The blank was cleaned, and new corks and a new real seat
fitted, ( reel seat on masking tape bushings, and then epoxied). I
have also put new guides on this rod. ( Didn´t photograph them, as not
of interest here).

I have just finished sanding the corks.  Thought it might be of
interest.

Just one other point of note. If the rod seat will fit in a saucepan
etc, then OK. But most spey rod and spinning rod butts will not!   I
use a three foot piece of four inch diameter stainless steel pipe,
welded closed at one end.  I fill this with water, put the rod in, so
that the excess water overflows, tip a little more out, and then I
boil the water in the pipe using a blowtorch.  One may suspend the rod
in the pipe to the depth required.

Of cousre you could use any suitable pipe for this, in which the rod
will fit.  The boiling water ensures that the reel seat etc is heated
evenly, and to a constant and controlled temperature ( ~ 100°C) .  You
CAN NOT DO THIS WITH HOT AIR GUNS!!!   You may damage the blank as
well using such hot air guns.

Sorry! One other important point. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES TRY TO COOL
THE BLANK !!!   Allow it to cool by itself in air. Indeed, if you want
to be really careful, after removing the reel seat, put the blank back
in the hot water, and allow the whole lot to cool naturally.

Force cooling the blank may cause severe damage.

So is an oxy/acetylene torch. In the last ten years or so, I have made
a number of new butt sections for people who used heat guns for
&quot;repairing&quot;  various things on rods. All but one of these rods snapped
inside the butt. Most modern  hot air guns will now reach temperatures
in excess of 400°C. This is too hot for softening cold cured epoxy.
Also, the fibre bonding medium in most modern rods is hot cured
epoxy.  This will withstand temperatures up to about 120C for quite a
while. Beyond that there are problems.

&quot;Standard&quot; cold curing epoxy will start to soften at about 85°C
Placing it in boiling water ensures that the temperature can not
exceed the safe limits for hot cured blanks, and also ensures that the
heat is applied evenly.  This is extremely difficult to do with a
stream of hot air.

Of course you could maybe talk to it for him?

And be careful with things snapping inside yer butt or you'll wind up

snap not only one, but a &quot;number&quot; of rods _inside_ &quot;the butt?&quot;

Coincidentally, I recall that Gary Loomis offered a rod-returner with a
rod broken _at_ the handle and claiming it happened while fishing
something like 5 free rods if they could break the handle section off of
a similar rod with their bare hands (even with the handle in a vise) and
if not, they paid for repairs - I don't recall hearing he ever had to
give away any rods...

&gt;Had both in reality, didn´t much like either. Rather have a beer and a
&gt;steak. Maybe you could try dissolving a reel seat off in high octane
&gt;gas?   It WILL work, but it will dissolve the blank as well, at least
&gt;the epoxy binder. Still, you will have a nice undamaged metal reel
&gt;seat, and a lot of doubtless extremely useful carbon fibre bits.

&gt;It might be worthwhile noting some of what you write, but the rest of
&gt;the shit is such a convolute mess, that there is no way of knowing
&gt;what.

&gt;It seems I &quot; done you wrong&quot;. DDD does not after all stand for &quot;Dirty
&gt;Dicky Dean&quot;, but for &quot;Dicky Disagrees Decidedly&quot;

&gt;Mind you don´t choke on your caviar............

&gt;No, it is not a thermoplastic. It is actually a condensate plastic. Up
&gt;to a certain point, it will however soften,  and harden again when it
&gt;cools, but the limits for this are tenuous with regard to many epoxy/
&gt;fibre composites.

&gt;Also beyond a certain point it turns to brittle &quot;snot&quot; when it cools,
&gt;with no strength at all.  If you can smell it, then it is too hot!

&gt;Damage will however often occur long before this point is reached.
&gt;What actually occurs is that when the epoxy reaches a certain degree
&gt;of softness, some fibres may &quot;delaminate&quot;, ( the correct term is
&gt;actually decompose, but is seldom used). When the epoxy hardens again,
&gt;the fibres are still delaminated, and this causes a weak spot ( or
&gt;indeed several,), on the blank wall. Loading will cause a lot more
&gt;stress on such a weak point, and the rod is unable to distribute the
&gt;stress evenly, and usually a break or a splintering occurs. All rods
&gt;deform to some extent under load, &quot;round&quot; or cylindrical blanks tend
&gt;to go &quot;oval&quot;. Even slight wall damage will then cause immediate and
&gt;catastrophic failure.

&gt;This is exacerbated considerably by the current &quot;on the edge&quot; blank
&gt;technology. This is being carried to ridiculous lengths now. Some of
&gt;these blanks will not withstand the slightest &quot;abuse&quot;, under &quot;normal&quot;
&gt;circumstances, and even apparently minor damage, or damage that is not
&gt;apparent at all, will cause immediate catastrophic failure. I think
&gt;this is completely wrong, but it is market driven, and has nothing to
&gt;do with good sense! :)

&gt;Epoxies vary widely, but as a general principle hot cured epoxies,
&gt;including hot &quot;post cure&quot; epoxies, will withstand much higher
&gt;temperatures than cold cure epoxies. This is the only reason you can
&gt;use heat at all to remove cold cure epoxy from rod blanks.

&gt;This damage is not apparent, but the blank will invariably fail under
&gt;load. This is especially problematic on Spey rods, beach casters,  and
&gt;similar, where the butt section is subject to heavy loading, both
&gt;during casting, and when playing large fish.

&gt;On a single handed rod, it might never occur, because the rod is
&gt;almost never loaded heavily to the butt.

&gt;Just recently I saw a very expensive 16 foot beachcaster snap like a
&gt;carrot immediately above the reel seat.  This can also be very very
&gt;dangerous indeed! One loses all control in that instant, and if a six
&gt;ounce lead is flying somewhere out of control, you can quite easily
&gt;kill somebody!

&gt;The guy who was casting was quite amazed when I asked him if he had
&gt;used a heat gun to remove the original corks, ( he had fitted a
&gt;&quot;bicyle grip&quot; upper hand grip)., and asked me &quot;how did you know?&quot;.
&gt;Quite simple, this is one of the few things which will cause immediate
&gt;blank failure under load. As I knew that this rod normally has a cork
&gt;upper hand grip, it was easy to guess what he had done.

&gt;I don´t really worry much any more about what people say. For a long
&gt;time I did, very much, and it really got under my skin, but it doesn´t
&gt;any more. Quite a lot of people thank me for sensible advice, and a
&gt;few others call me an arsehole. Sometimes quite a few. So what? For a
&gt;long time, and even now to a certain extent, and under certain
&gt;circumstances, I imagined it was important that people liked and
&gt;respected me. But it is silly to expect that really.

&gt;Just recently I witnessed a most demeaning spectacle in this regard,
&gt;and it hit me quite hard to realise that doubtless others had thought
&gt;the same when I had had pissing contests with others.

&gt;All one can do is ensure that when one gives advice, that it is good
&gt;advice, and ignore the barrackers. Those who make use of it will be
&gt;grateful, and the rest may still think I am an arsehole.  There is
&gt;nothing to be done about this.

&gt;With the UK fly-dressing thing, it was much the same. The guy does not
&gt;really want anybody else giving advice to newbies, he wants to be the
&gt;guy who people ask about things, and he wants people to like and
&gt;respect him as a result. I can  understand and sympathise with that,
&gt;but if you make a mistake on the internet nowadays, you are more or
&gt;less fucked!

&gt; Of course, nobody knows everything, and everybody makes mistakes now
&gt;and again. That is perfectly normal. The trouble with that is, if you
&gt;really drop a clanger, you feel obliged to defend it, even after you
&gt;know it was wrong! I really try hard to restrict myself to things I
&gt;know about, but even that does not stop me making errors of judgement,
&gt;or completely misconstruing some things. Having to weigh one´s words
&gt;extremely carefully, and also go to considerablke lengths to avoid
&gt;misunderstandings, or make extremely comprehensive explanations of
&gt;things, makes it all far more difficult.

&gt;Quite often, it makes no difference at all whether one is right or
&gt;wrong, as the whole kit and kaboodle devolves into personalities and
&gt;shit slinging. This is also then invariably far more venomous than it
&gt;would be in the &quot;real&quot; world.

&gt;Apparently, many people see and treat the internet as &quot;not real&quot;, more
&gt;like a video game than real life.  Having spent most of my adult life
&gt;involved with computers, and also working in that capacity, I have
&gt;trouble seeing this point of view at all!

&gt;It´s all real for me, and that has probably been my greatest problem!

&gt;Whatever!   I spoke to Trevor, and he has more or less given up
&gt;fishing . It is too expensive for him, and he can´t fish more than a
&gt;couple of hours without pain, so it is really rather pointless. He
&gt;came along the other day, but only when we went and picked him up, and
&gt;watched us casting, but he did not even pick up a rod. I suppose he
&gt;will soon stop coming altogether.

&gt;Since his wife died he has little interest anyway. He lives on tins of
&gt;shit. He says he can´t cook and he doesn´t want to learn either. He
&gt;has given up I think. I can appreciate the problems, but giving up is
&gt;not the answer I feel.  Although maybe for some it is?

&gt;Who the hell knows?  I don´t even know what´s best for me, so how
&gt;could I possibly presume to know what is best for somebody else?

&gt;Anyway, I will be there on Monday night, and I will dress a few flies,
&gt;and hold the usula lecture. Stefan says that over 80 people have
&gt;booked. OK half of theose will fall by the wayside anyway, before the
&gt;course is half over.

&gt;Wolfgang and Arne were saying how &quot;heartening&quot; it was, but I´m fucked
&gt;if I know what´s heartening about it, virtually none of these people
&gt;will ever get any decent fishing. I really don´t see the point in
&gt;awakening expectations which can not be fulfilled.  Just pre-
&gt;programmed disappointment if you ask me.

&gt;Quite a few think I am completely fucking crazy anyway! One of the new
&gt;ladies, five this year, actually asked me &quot; Wie kann man bloss so
&gt;enthusiastich sein?&quot;  just as well she din´t know me twenty years
&gt;ago!

&gt;Of course, I am getting old and cynical!  :)

&gt;See you Monday!

&gt;Petri Heil!

As a couple of people asked, I got into repairing and modifying rods
for several reasons. The first major reason was because a long time
ago now, I was given a whole load of blanks, partially completed rods,
and various broken rods from a firm which went out of business.  I set
out to repair, refurbish, and rebuild these rods.  It was necessary to
collect quite a lot of information in order to do so, and also
involved some trial and error.  Eventually, after a few months, I had
some hundred or so rods made up, and a large collection of parts,
blank pieces etc etc. left over.

Most of the fly rods landed in my various club practice cabinets, for
beginners, and most of the other rods I also gave away, mostly to
youngsters in the various clubs, who needed or wanted a rod of that
type, although I still have a couple of them.

Doing this taught me a lot about rods, and not too long after this I
designed some blanks, and had them produced as prototypes. In the
meantime, various people from casting courses at various clubs etc,
got to know that I repaired rods, usually for free, or at cost. Even a
couple of tackle shops started asking me to repair various things. Of
course many people in the clubs I belonged to, knew I repaired stuff,
and they told others. Sometimes I would have twenty people bringing me
variously damaged rods, or rods they wanted modified, broken reels,
and a lot of other stuff on a single week-end.

As I still had a large selection of blank pieces, and various other
stuff, it was not usually very difficult to replace whole sections on
many rods, and things like new spigot ferrules etc  were also easy to
make.  The more I repaired, the larger my collection of stuff grew.
There are a number of repairs one can do quite easily if one has the
parts, and a little know how.  Some of the repairs I did would not
normally be viable propositions, but some people wanted tips spliced
and things like that, so I did it for them. This particular repair,
and a few others, are not normally things I would recommend doing, as
some affect the rod action considerably. Normally I would replace such
a section completely. Nevertheless, some people wanted the &quot;quick and
dirty&quot; repairs. Although of course many such repairs are neither quick
nor dirty. Many people wanted various modifications or &quot;improvements&quot;,
and also to discuss them before they were done.  I even refurbished
quite a number of cane rods, but I always refused to touch expensive
ones, and advised that the owners take them to a professional rod-
maker.

As I had my own small machine shop, I was also able to make and repair
lots of other things. Bits for reels that were unobtainable, various
metal and plastic parts, and a host of other stuff. Various people,
including a few tackle shops, often gave me boxes full of various bits
and pieces, often in lieu of payment, and before I gave it all away,
not that long ago, I had a whole room full of reel spare parts,
blanks, and other angling related paraphernalia.

When one sees a fairly large number of damaged and broken rods, one
begins to get a feel for what caused the damage. Also, in many cases,
the people concerned will tell you how it happened.

Having been involved in this for close to thirty years, I learned
quite a lot about it. Basically it is as simple as that. As with many
other things, if one does them a lot, and tries to do them well, one
gains knowledge and skill. This is why as  an amateur, I have gained a
lot of knowledge, simply because I have built, modified, and repaired
a very large number of rods and other items to do with angling. far
more than any amateur normally would.

With regard to my giving advice on such things, and various people
disagreeing.  It does not really matter much. I try to give the best
advice I can, but nobody is obliged to take it. I don´t know
everything there is to know about these things, but I restrict my
advice to what I do know. If somebody does not like it, that is fine
with me, they don´t have to do it.

&gt; a rod broken _at_ the handle and claiming it happened while fishing
&gt; something like 5 free rods if they could break the handle section off
&gt; of a similar rod with their bare hands (even with the handle in a
&gt; vise) and if not, they paid for repairs - I don't recall hearing he
&gt; ever had to give away any rods...

&gt;&gt;Most modern  hot air guns will now reach temperatures
&gt;&gt;in excess of 400°C.

&gt; And the surface of the sun is much hotter than that, so Pete, don't
&gt; take your rod (or your butt...) to the surface of the sun, OK...

&gt;&gt;This is too hot for softening cold cured epoxy.
&gt;&gt;Also, the fibre bonding medium in most modern rods is hot cured
&gt;&gt;epoxy.  This will withstand temperatures up to about 120C for quite a
&gt;&gt;while. Beyond that there are problems.

&gt; Which will come as news to many epoxy makers...why heck, them lyin'
&gt; SOBs at 3M claim their stuff is good to 500-1000F, depending on the
&gt; specific product...says it right there on the packaging, too...IAC, I
&gt; didn't suggest that anyone attempt to broil the rod with the heat gun.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Standard&quot; cold curing epoxy will start to soften at about 85°C
&gt;&gt;Placing it in boiling water ensures that the temperature can not
&gt;&gt;exceed the safe limits for hot cured blanks, and also ensures that the
&gt;&gt;heat is applied evenly.

&gt; And note that I never said boiling water was wrong, only that a heat
&gt; gun used carefully is OK.  And so, for those out there that would, oh,
&gt; say, turn on a heat gun full blast, place the handle of a rod right
&gt; near the nozzle, and leave it for an hour: don't do that, you stupid

&gt;&gt;This is extremely difficult to do with a stream of hot air.

Most of these guys would destroy a decent rod.

Thank you for being a voice of reason.

I've seen so much misadvice in this group that I had to say something to
somebody.

I'm not an expert for sure, but I've been fixing and building rods for a
few years.

A controlled application of an airgun is probably the best way to go if
you don't want to soak a butt or reel seat.

A lot of older cork grips will lose some or all of the fillers that were
made of chips with water based glues.  This leads to refilling all the
gaps , re-sanding, finishing etc.

Try shoving a plug down the bottom end of the blank and add a bit of very
hot water to soften the reelseat off a fly rod without soaking the grip.

The plug can be a wad of newspaper that, once dry, will drop out easily.

Fillers for cork grips can be made by grinding up old corks and mixing
with epoxy.  Barely noticable if done right.

Well, that is interesting. Just a couple of points. The rod in
question is a Spey rod, so there are quite a few corks below the reel
seat.  You can not remove corks using a hot air gun, as cork is an
excellent insulator, and the heat applied will never reach the epoxy
beneath the corks.  Soaking in boiling water which is actually inside
the blank will usually soften the epoxy enough to slide the corks
off.  The only other way to get those corks off, is to cut them off.
They will of course have to be replaced. One could remove the corks
above the reel seat, also by heating the blank internally, and then
sliding them off the tapered blank,( the opposite way they were slid
on), but this may mark the rod.The only viable way of doing this, is
by using hot water. This will however destroy the epoxy bond on ALL
the corks, including those below the reel seat, and thus necessitate
the replacement of ALL corks.

One might try directing a stream of very hot air inside the blank, but
one has less control, and this will also soften ALL epoxy adhering to
the blank, which of course will also necessitate replacement of the
whole butt.

If one uses cheap cork, which requires a lot of filling, then probably
the best method of making the filler, is to use white ( dries
translucent or clear), waterproof wood-glue, thoroughly mixed with
cork dust. Epoxy is a bad choice for making filler, as it will show,
and one will have &quot;smooth&quot; waterproof areas on the cork. Also, it is
extremely difficult to sand epoxy filler evenly, without removing a
lot of the surrounding cork. This is because the set-up epoxy is a lot
harder than the cork.

You may have noticed that the gentleman concerned has successfully
removed the reel seat in question, and quite easily. So the
recommended method worked very well.

Calling somebody an idiot, especially after the method advised has
proven successful, is more than a bit stupid, not to mention extremely
ill-mannered.

Better than epoxy is GE RTV silicon rubber.   Save your broken rings
and old wine corks.  It is not necessary to grind them to a powder.  I
whittle them to crumbs  with a shoe rasp.   A blender work too,  but
it can affect the domestic tranquility.
I used a carboard tube to mold the handles.  The last rod I did in two
steps putting the RTV/Cork crumb paste under the reel seat first.
After the mix under the reelseat curedI put tape over it and molded
the rest of the handle.
The RTV is not for quick repairs,  It needs time in a warm place to
cure properly.

Not so.  Insulators slow the transfer of heat; they do not stop it.  Given

Styrofoam using RTV as the sealer.  The problem was the RTV never set
because it was insulated from air. Three weeks later, the chamber was picked
up with a forklift and the insulation box fell apart. A pretty embarrassing
moment for the tech.

Oh cork btw is a good vibration insulator, not sure about a heat insulator.

&gt; &gt; Better than epoxy is GE RTV silicon rubber.   Save your broken rings
&gt; &gt; and old wine corks.  It is not necessary to grind them to a powder.  I
&gt; &gt; whittle them to crumbs  with a shoe rasp.   A blender work too,  but
&gt; &gt; it can affect the domestic tranquility.
&gt; &gt; I used a carboard tube to mold the handles.  The last rod I did in two
&gt; &gt; steps putting the RTV/Cork crumb paste under the reel seat first.
&gt; &gt; After the mix under the reelseat curedI put tape over it and molded
&gt; &gt; the rest of the handle.
&gt; &gt; The RTV is not for quick repairs,  It needs time in a warm place to
&gt; &gt; cure properly.

&gt; I believe RTV is an aerobic sealer, sometimes when buried, it doesn't
&gt; receive a full cure.

I have had the same problem ( job related and fishing rods).  Time and
higher temps seems to do it.
I werre doing more of them I would &quot;Paint&quot; it on it layers.  The ratio
of RTV to cork was low 20 to 30% I am guessing, I never measured it.

That is true enough, but in order to get the corks hot enough to
soften the epoxy beneath them, you will need a lot of heat for a long

Using hot water brings the heat to the inside of the blank, and limits

On a couple of old cane rods, I did manage to get the corks off by
heating with a heat gun,by heating around the base of the cork, and
continually trying to twist the cork,  but it took half an age, I have
no idea what temperatures were reached, and the corks were destroyed
in any case, as they are also glued together with epoxy, so the effort
was basically wasted.

One may remove the reel seat, after cutting the corks off, or even
remove guides etc with a heat gun, because the heat reaches the epoxy
almost immediately. BUT, one has less control. I prefer to use a
quick, easy, safe, and controllable method.

It makes no difference to me what people use, they are not my rods,
nor those of friends.

My intention was to help the OP in removing a reel seat easily and
safely.Which he achieved. I can´t really see much point in continuing
to argue about what MAY work.  He used a method which worked, easily

One might also use C4 for removing corks. But I have not tried that
yet. Should be quick enough though.

Cork is apparently a good enough, relatively lightweight insulator/ablative

I was merely looking for confirmation of what I already knew, by dint
of the fact that I have tried it. Also, one of the subjects I studied
during my sojourn at university was material properties. Cork is
simply a very very good insulator. So trying to penetrate it with heat
is not a good idea.

If you want to use a heat gun for removing cork, then go ahead, nobody
will stop you.  Nobody will stop you or anybody else arguing about it
either, or calling me an idiot and worse.

I took the first few relevant hits I found.  If you don´t like them,

But...but...but...I thought merely flicking on a heat gun would

that looks (and operates) much a metal hair dryer, albeit with a hotter
element and that folks have and use for a variety of things and when you
say &quot;heat gun,&quot; you mean a space shuttle engine...

IAC, I am curious, especially given the remarkable insulation properties
of cork: how did all these geniuses of your acquaint manage to break
not one, but a number of rods off &quot;inside the butt?&quot;

And BTW, the OP wanted to get a metal reel seat off, not a cork handle,
and I'll go out on a limb and say that a metal reel seat would transmit
the heat pretty well, and thus, if you had even a flickering of
experience with a heat gun, you'd know that, um, when used
carefully/properly, a heat gun would work OK...

Right.  This is why I wouldn't recommend using a heat gun to loosen cork
grips from a fly rod.  Personally, I've never had to remove a cork grip.  If
I needed to, I believe I would experiment with hot water immersion first.
In any case, I don't have a heat gun, so I would almost certainly try hot
water for removing a metal reel seat as well.
