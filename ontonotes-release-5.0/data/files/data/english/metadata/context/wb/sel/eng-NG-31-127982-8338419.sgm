I'd like a bit of advice from the list on the matter of encores. Or
more succinctly what you should play an encore, and when you should
not play an encore.

Obviously if the crowd have been yelling, clapping and up dancing all
gig and are now baying for more; then an encore or two are in order.
Likewise, if you have been playing to two men and a dog, and the dog
walked out midway through the second set - then an encore is not only
pushing your luck, but a bit pointless.

But where is the middle point? When should you do an encore, and when
should you not bother. And why.

I would be interested in hearing everyone's opinions - from a
musician's point of view and from those who go to gigs as fans.

I have my own views on this, but I would like to see other people's
opinions before I cloud the issue with the whys and wherefors of the
question.

thanks

Obviously that should read WHEN you should play an encore, and when
you should
not play an encore. (We know 'what' to play:)

I've never been in this position but I'd side with
&quot;better to leave some people disappointed for the lack of encore than
some people thinking what is he playing again for?&quot;.

Or, side with caution. If they liked you, they'll remember you anyway.

Dunno and I can't think of many occasions when I've I've been asked for
more... There was one however perhaps relavent to this thread.

I did an on the spot (between us) floor spot with a concertina playing
friend in a (then to me) local folk club. The first set we did IIRC was
Lark in the Morning/Dusty Windowsills and I felt we were not really
together.

Don't ask me why it happened on the second tune (just Farewell To
Ireland) but it was just magic. She was good anyway but even my tenor
banjo was good and the instruments seemed to be working together
perfectly. I could feel it, the audience could feel it too - you know
when your up on stage and you feel a new level of silence- and you know
how focused they are?

Finished and there was that split second more silence before people
stood up to cheer and shout &quot;more&quot;.

There was, of course, only one sensible thing to do. Get off - we (or at
least I) could only have produced an anti-climax after it.

In my slightly limited experience - I have been guest &quot;star&quot; at quite
a few folk clubs, and have been to gadzillions of proper stars' gigs
at folk clubs - an encore is always going to happen. Always. So I
usually set expectation before my &quot;last&quot; number by saying that this is
my last number before the surprise spontaneous encore.

However, when MCing a big gig with multiple stars, I find it best to
have a rule for the entire show, and explain it to the audience. The
rule is &quot;we've got a packed programme and all the acts are quality.
Thus we're asking them all to build their encores into the set. We
won't have time to fit in extra encores: it only gets us behind
schedule which isn't fair to the later acts&quot;. But then the headline
act usually manages to get an exemption.

Encores can be a disaster area or just plain ace for many reasons.  They
must be &quot;earned&quot; it's not always possible but it's important to leave
the stage (room if possible) and really feel the audience is calling you
back. It's also very important that the MC doesn't push the audience to
ask for an encore.  Indeed it seems really important and respectful if
the MC doesn't invade the stage area at all and allows things to take
their course (if the gig has been that good then the &quot;process&quot; can be
trusted) It should be wanted and earned - then it's brilliant.

It's also of course important that the artist respects the time
constraints of the venue.

I find in our club and others that the encore is a &quot;programmed-in&quot;
part of the evening when there is a guest.  It gives the organiser a
chance to round things up (thank yous, glasses to the bar, etc.)
before the audience turns its attention to putting on coats, chatting
to Reg or whatever.  It is therefore a fairly artificial thing - and
some do make a bit of a joke of it.  It can also be a bit of relief to
some performers who, after a night of the more expected stuff, can
suddenly throw in a fun item.
However, when it's a &quot;concert&quot; night or a bill of many names, the
rules may change.  I've even had an act once who stipulated &quot;no
encore&quot;.
So I think the answer may be &quot;it depends&quot;.
Time constraints are important these days.  The pleasure police have
decreed that the entertainment finishes at 11:30 in our usual venue.
We did think of telling people to just stop enjoying themselves at
that point - but didn't think we'd get away with it :-]  One act we
had didn't get an encore because the time had run out.

I prefer some sort of hint from the MC. The only time an MC didn't even
get up at the end of a performance I found it a bit disconcerting.

That's a good reason for my preference, and generally because I'd rather
not make any assumptions about what's normal practice at any given venue.

Sometimes in discussions with the organisers about set timings they will
mention &quot;the obligatory encore&quot;, which is reassuring in terms of the
&quot;ground rules&quot; but tends to destroy the illusion you've actually earned it.

It has become almost a ritual part of the evening in many places
and I suspect that most audiences these days would feel a wee bit
insulted if it didn't happen. Personally, I dislike forced or
obligatory encores but have learned to live with them.

I much prefer what Gordon Jones was talking about - last song,
that's it, night over. Then, if the audience *really* enjoyed the
set so much that they can't face leaving without just one more,
fine, but it should really be something which happens
spontaneously.

I like Tom Paxton's approach. &quot;I'm getting too old for all that
walking off and coming back on stuff, so just presume that that
last song was the last song, you all went wild and screamed for
more, and this one is the encore.&quot;

One performer - I can't remember who now - said, &quot;I like to vary the set...
keeps me sharp and on me toes...  I'm going to do tonight backwards just for
a change but I'll need your help...  So I'll start really jolly with the
encore after which you need to applaud very loudly and stomp on the floor;
I'll then nip out for a minute have a quick drink and when I come back in
I'll do the set - gradually getting more nervous looking as the night goes
on.&quot;  It was a lot funnier acted out than I make it here.

I'm with Hamish on this.

On a festival concert, unless you set the rules in advance (and stick to
them) encores happen so either build them into your timings or deny
everyone except the last act an encore and let them know in advance so
there's no hard feelings.

At the end of a club night, encores happen. It would be nice to think
that encores were always delivered to rapturous applause, but to be
honest they're often just expected as part of the show.

You might be playing a gig to three people and a dog and the dog might
get up and leave, but if one of the three people shouts for more then
you do the obligatory encore otherwise you look very churlish - as
though you can't give full value just because the audience is small.
After all, it's not the fault of the three people who actually turned
out to see you when everyone else stayed home because of a piddling
three feet of snow.

You can, of course, manipulate the encore. Do a fast, uptempo
balls-to-the-wall piece and you stand a decent chance of getting a
screaming second encore or end on a leave-'em-wanting-more note. Do a
soft, steady winding-down song and you send them away smiling and
satisfied.

We had a couple of songs that were good wind-downs and a couple that
were good wind-ups. One song 'Farewell Song' (Each beginning marks an
ending...) was an absolutely this-is-the-last-you're-going-to-get song
and the audience knew it was the end.

It's up to you to judge when to use different songs.

Most events (festival concert or club) have a fairly strict finishing
time and if you're going to do an encore it's no use playing right up to
the line and then getting mad because the MC doesn't give you an encore.

If there's any doubt about encore etiquette then talk to the MC in
advance. Ask what time you should finish and when given the time ask if
that's inclusive of an encore or not.

Don't overrun - even if the audience is going apeshit for another.
_Especially_ if you're not the last one on.

Some festival MCs are really bad at denying an audience an encore and
will bring you back on even if it means letting the concert run late or
squeezing the last act. This is bad news but you can't refuse even if
you know he's making a mess of the concert timing, however you can keep
it short.

On two separate occasions, two performers who should have known better,
(and who shall remain nameless), got themselves in our bad books at
festivals by taking an encore when there wasn't really time (not their
fault) but then making a bloody meal of it by doing song-tune-song
segued (in one case) and two separate songs (in another case) in each
case cutting our set by 15 minutes because the concert _had_ to finish
at a specific time.

There's a time and a place for running on and that was not it. Even if
the audience is going wild you have to think about your timing and leave
them on a high. It was interesting to note that neither performer looked
us in the eye as they came off and passed us in the wings.

That reminds me of the late Jake Thackray, who tended to explain that

Not only does it put the squeeze the following performers, but it puts
pressure on technical crew in the form of reduced turn around time.
Rushing the job leads to mistakes and embarrassment.

Also, some MC`s have a habit of occupying the stage between acts,
blathering on and generally being in the way of stage crew or preventing
them getting to where they need to be on stage to effect a smooth change
over.

Not to mention bands who stroll off stage at the end of their set,
leaving instruments, cables, pedals, teacups, portmateau etc. littering
the stage.

It`s annoying when you have ten minute change overs, and the MC wastes
five of those precious minutes rambling, or you spend them clearing the
previous acts gear off. only to have the MC trying to rush the crew to
get the show back on schedule.

I think I, as a member of the audience, would find that quite
refreshing. Even when I've enjoyed an act immensely, once it gets to the
end, I'm beginning to disengage myself and think about getting home or
going elsewhere/wondering where I left the car/looking sadly at my
long-empty glass, etc.

Maybe one encore is OK, just a quick, lightweight song to send us home
humming, or a gentle winding-down song, but when it gets to two or
three, I get restless and find myself wishing they had just built all
these numbers into their set in the first place.

Yes, Good old Jake. I saw him manny times, but only once did he do an

No, no, that's just the point. Recently I saw Spiers and Boden at
Teignmouth FF, where they did a cracking set that lasted for over an
hour and a half with just a short break. It was brilliant stuff -  I was
totally absorbed in it and couldn't believe the time had passed so
quickly when it came to the end. But it wasn't the end, there were three
encores. By the end of the first encore I was mentally in &quot;where did I
park the car, and has the rain stopped yet?&quot; mode, and I was getting
restless by the time it all actually finished. Had there been another 15
minutes scheduled in from the start, I'd have enjoyed it more fully to
the end. It's not about the standard (although I admit that obligatory
encores to a mediocre set can be a bit of an ordeal); it's about
expectations, and mentally settling in to a concert session. Also, the
songs/tunes in a planned set can be introduced and linked in a way that
makes them more interesting, whereas encore items are just a series of
one-offs.

&gt;&gt;&gt; the end, I'm beginning to disengage myself and think about getting
&gt;&gt;&gt; home or going elsewhere/wondering where I left the car/looking sadly
&gt;&gt;&gt; at my long-empty glass, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe one encore is OK, just a quick, lightweight song to send us home
&gt;&gt;&gt; humming, or a gentle winding-down song, but when it gets to two or
&gt;&gt;&gt; three, I get restless and find myself wishing they had just built all
&gt;&gt;&gt; these numbers into their set in the first place.

&gt;&gt; Guess you need to go to better gigs!!! :-)

&gt; No, no, that's just the point. Recently I saw Spiers and Boden at
&gt; Teignmouth FF, where they did a cracking set that lasted for over an
&gt; hour and a half with just a short break. It was brilliant stuff -  I was
&gt; totally absorbed in it and couldn't believe the time had passed so
&gt; quickly when it came to the end. But it wasn't the end, there were three
&gt; encores.
">

As an MC/organiser of sorts, the organised encore/last number is a good way
to do it IMO.  I treat it as an organised interruption...

The artiste announces the last song and applause; then the MC gets up;
privately asks the artiste if they want to do another; thanks the guests;
thanks any support; thanks organising team for sound/lights FOH (often if
not usually volunteers) and then suggests the artiste does another to the
audience who respond enthusiastically (might end-up doing two); concert ends
after that: MC might want to just add goodnight thanks for coming and
announce the next concert or not.

If anyone thinks that is all too contrived, then compare that with the no
MC, band walking-off stage whilst the audience has to clap their hands sore
and stomp test the joists in the floor.  IMO that can be a lot more
contrived - embarrassing even.  I have left a few concerts whilst that was
going on.

The obligatory 'clap til ye come back' type encore is a product of rock
style concerts.  You don't get it usually at classical music concerts.

AFAICT Most people are happy to hear 2 x good well executed 45 min sets. A
minority IMO often want more. I sometimes think that a bit less is more.  I
have had complaints when a concert has overrun by 15 mins - from audience
members - not from the venue.

Yes, I don't like that either, even if the concert has been really good.
Sometimes you can tell by the way the band leave all the instruments
ready for another number and then hover nearby, which makes it feel even
more contrived.

Well, you do, but not for an encore (well, you wouldn't really want
another symphony, would you? And anyway the orchestra wouldn't, IME,
give any more than they've been paid to do.). But you do get endless
clapping and stamping for the soloists to come on and off and on ond off
to take repeated bows. Very boring. I mean, it's their job to play or
sing, and they're paid to do it well. It's nice to acknowledge your
enjoyment enthusiastically, but I don't like it when it's taken to
extremes. I mean, dammit, it's not British, is it?

I was once in a classical concert at the South Bank Centre as part of
the offstage choir at the end of Holst's Planets Suite. The choir has to
fade away at the end, an effect which in this instance was achieved by
us walking backwards out of the builiding in the direction of the coach
that would take us all home. The applause continued, and I was told
afterwards that there were shouted requests for the choir to come on and
take a bow, but by the time that happened we were already on the coach
on our way home. In any case it would have looked a bit silly, as the
choir (who never appear on stage in the Planets) were all in mufti and
would have appeared a bit incongruous compared with the formality of the
orchestra in black tie etc.

You can always leave before/during the encores if you feel you have ghad
value in the main set and have transport to catch/want to catch.
What can be annoying is if the main act is late on and you miss part of the
main set to catch your bus.
I had an annoying experience at Edinburgh folk club, when club business overran and I had to leave about 3 or 4 songs into Martin Simpson's main set.
I REALLY wasn't interested in elections of office bearers or whatever!

Yes, I noticed that this year. Most uncharacteristic. They are normally
bang on the nail, never early and do their best not to be late. I must
remember to mention this to them, as it also caught me out with one act.

Exactly what I do. And re your other post Hamish, I was taught that the
way to make a programme work is to make sure each act *starts* on time
(not early), and not worry if it finishes early. What tends to happen to
me is the start times tend to slip slightly - say by ten minutes in a
three hour concert, but that still leaves the headliners with room for
their encore.

&gt;Not only does it put the squeeze the following performers, but it puts

&gt;Rushing the job leads to mistakes and embarrassment.

&gt;Also, some MC`s have a habit of occupying the stage between acts,

&gt;them getting to where they need to be on stage to effect a smooth change

Well, they should have their license revoked. I try to keep my intros
down to a sentence. At the start of the concert I usually try to do the
introductory speal a couple of minutes *before* the scheduled start
time, so the first act gets its full value.

Another thing I don't do, is come on stage *after* the headline act's
encore. I think the punters want to go home with the main attraction
buzzing in their ears, not the second rate burblings of some stage
struck tw*t telling them what a wonderful night they've had, and do come
along to our next concert in Feburary, and safe journey home, and rabbit

&gt;Not to mention bands who stroll off stage at the end of their set,

Agreed. I went to Nostell Priory many years ago to see Steeley. They
were the only thing that I wanted to see at that festival (the rest was
pop) and I arrived half an hour before their on-stage time to find I'd
already missed half an hour of their set!
:-(

But most organisers will tell you that no plan survives first contact
with the enemy.
:-)

Starting early is one of the things you can usually avoid except where
an act is a no-show and you can't get a replacement, so you have to move
stuff up and stretch things out to cover the gaps.

Aargh... one notable concert (in Canada) the MC read out the whole spiel
downloaded from our website (including the bit that said 'so book them

lost the will to live.

As a performer I prefer not to have the MC get up between the last song
and the encore because they can so often bring the audience down from
whatever high they were on with a long list of parish notices or
blethering about next week (which should have been done in the
interval). So as an MC I leave the glory of returning to the stage
entirely to the artist, unless they ask me not to. Though as they finish
their encore and as I switch the house lights on I'll yell for another
round of applause from my spot by the light switches halfway down the
room. I'm then already by the door to personally say goodbye and thanks
for coming to people as they leave.

If I'm MCing I usually make it very clear to all the acts that whatever
time they get on to the stage they _will_ finish at _this_ specific time
and that if they overrun they're taking time from (very specifically)
the following act.

It's very difficult to get an act off if they're determined to wilfully
overrun. I did hear a tale of one MC actually walking on stage in the
middle of a song, joining in with the chorus and then leading the
performer off stage with one arm round his shoulder. It was a very
determined MC and a performer with a reputation for overrunning.

At Owen Sound Summerfolk the first time we played there we were warned
that you get 25 minutes on the main stage (including changeovers but the
stage crew is lightning fast with RO/RO drumkit platforms for the
percussionally inclined). There's a clock (by the monitors) on stage for
the performers. The stage manager tells you in advance where he'll be
popping up from to give you a five minute warning and if you overrun
significantly (by more than five minutes)  they cut the power to the PA.
We didn't overrun.
:-)

This seems to be the philosophy that Loughborough Festival
adopted last year, but the way the weekend was actually
timetabled made this a rather strange experience.

The programme showed the acts in the main hall appearing at 90
minute intervals.  This turned out to be 60 minute spots, each
followed by a half hour break.  Finishing timed were rigidly
adhered to.  It seemed that it had not been possible to do sound
checks beforehand, hence the 30 minutes allowed, but most seemed
to need less than 10 minutes.  The rest of the time (which added
up to quite a lot) we were treated to CDs.  Oddly, for the first
two days the sound desk only appeared to have two available -
Runrig and someone sounding similar to Nancy Griffiths.  Luckily
I liked them  ;-)

There was another, much smaller, room in the main venue, but it
would not have accommodated everybody if they had bailed out in
the gaps, and in any case, many of them were synchronised.

It was a good effort at a new festival, and I will be back, but I
do hope that it is possible to arrange things so that at least
the main concerts are allowed to flow in a less disjointed

&gt;&gt;Thus we're asking them all to build their encores into the set. We

&gt;This seems to be the philosophy that Loughborough Festival
&gt;adopted last year, but the way the weekend was actually
&gt;timetabled made this a rather strange experience.

&gt;The programme showed the acts in the main hall appearing at 90
&gt;minute intervals.  This turned out to be 60 minute spots, each
&gt;followed by a half hour break.  Finishing timed were rigidly
&gt;adhered to.  It seemed that it had not been possible to do sound
&gt;checks beforehand, hence the 30 minutes allowed, but most seemed
&gt;to need less than 10 minutes.  The rest of the time (which added
&gt;up to quite a lot) we were treated to CDs.  Oddly, for the first
&gt;two days the sound desk only appeared to have two available -
&gt;Runrig and someone sounding similar to Nancy Griffiths.  Luckily
&gt;I liked them  ;-)

Wow - that actually sounds dreadful. An hour (IMO) is too long for a
concert spot, because with the best will in the world you aren'y going
to like some of the acts, and you might actually *hate* the odd one.

And sitting through a sound check - awful for both act and audience -
and many acts need almost no soundcheck.

And, and I really dislike having CDs played at me in the gaps - I want
the previous act's music to go on running in my head, nit have some
twirpy selection rammed down my ears.

Eeek - I spot a new thread!

Yeah - note - if you have a battery operated clock, make sure the

of the stage at Priddy a couple of years back and you know how Keith

Unnecessarily elevated sound is one of my pet peeves. My daughter has a
hearing condition from being blasted by high level sound in a studio on
her first job (a long story) but basically instead of losing hearing
it's made her over-sensitive to sound (called hyperacusis) so she can't
even take the sound levels in most cinemas these days. It's only when
you have someone like that in the family that you realise that there are
so many places people can't go if they don't like being subjected to
loud noises. She says walking into a noisy nightclub feels like
someone's pushing her backwards with a fist in her chest

Why do some bands think loud is better? Probably because they've already
started to lose their own hearing so raised volume levels become
essential to them. Half the rockband sound engineers have some hearing
loss. It's madness.

Back to my daughter. The problem was caused by people who'd been in the
industry long enough to know better but they turned the sound up to
taunt her when she said it was too loud. 'You don't know what loud is,
little apprentice.' (Their own hearing had already been dulled by years
in the business.)

She knows what loud is know because she 'hears' things at 25 db louder
than normal ears perceive it. Imagine adding 25db to cinema sound,
concert sound, even the sound of the London Underground and you begin to
realise that LOUD is not good.

Way back - years ago - we suffered an Oyster Band concert at Holmfirth
Festival because we wanted to keep our seats for the next event and
space was very limited. I love the Oysters on CD but the sound in the
room was distorted and all you could hear was noise (their own sound
engineer, not the festival's). The fest organiser went out to the BBC OB
van that was recording the concert and said that at normal volumes the
concert sounded brilliant. If we'd not known that we'd have come away
saying the Oysters were great on disc but crap live. So over-loud sound
can actually be career damaging.

So all that was just to agree with you. Why the hell do some bands
insist on cranking the sound up to eleven?

It's not age... it's common sense and self-preservation that demands
sane sound levels.

It happens on a small scale too. I play with several people who have
hearing problems - one who admits to being slightly deaf, and three or
four who are not really able to tell what's in tune and what's out.

Last night we had one of 'em complaining I was out of tune with him
(yes, because his guitar was so far out of tune with itself that
anything in tune clashed!), the other constantly turning his guitar up
when the first one took it down a bit on the desk because he was too
loud and distorting (in a small pub venue doing acoustic/plugged in).

My friend with hearing loss also can't use the mains as monitors, and
has to have a monitor, and prefers this to be his own sound only. He has
this turned up so loud that no-one can hear anything except him, on
stage, so his monitor effectively destroys the ability of the rest of us
to 'monitor' from the main sound.

In a small room it probably also effectively destroys the front of house
mix because there will be so much sound from the monitor bouncing around
the room that the FoH sound will have to be mixed up to an appropriate
level. Tell him to get real.

Well now: there's a thing. It was the Oyster Band in a gig in
Islington that finally gave me tinitus. I say finally, because it's a
cumulative thing and early years of Led Zep, Deep Purple, ELP and the
like probably didn't help. But the ringing in the ears the next day
always went away. Until The Oysters.

&lt;Oops! Scope drift squared&gt;But I've been to discos at my kids' school
- for ages 5 to 9 - where the sound levels have been dangerously high.
And weddings, too. I mean, what's /that/ about? Having been brought up
in Scotland where the norm was a ceilidh band and it's a very social
thing - dancing with great aunt Madge and everything - it was a real
shock to go to my first wedding darn sarff where a disco made any
attempt at social intercourse impossible. &lt;/Oops! Scope drift squared&gt;

That`s the way it is going, in ear monitors are becoming the norm for
all big acts and many smaller performers are taking up the option. As a
performer, it takes a while to adjust to them, but most performers
wouldn`t go back to relying on wedges once they`ve got used to in-ears.

However, there is a problem at festivals and the like where there`s
usually a generic monitor mix on wedges, which just needs a little
tweaking for each performer/band, marking up, and resetting between
acts.  In-ears have to be set up perfectly and that takes time.

Some performers use their own separate little mixer to set their
foldback, and again tho it`s a very satisfactory method, it takes time
to set up and adjust and just not practical at smaller festivals.

There`s also a safety aspect to using in-ears, that has to be taken into
consideration.

Yes, I became aware of that contrast at a big birthday party (in
England) where they had a ceilidh band, but to give that band a break
and to give some variety, they had a pop/rock band on for a while in the
middle of the evening. During the ceilidh band, it was possible to talk
and socialise if you weren't dancing (or even if you were), but when the
rock band started to play, it was so loud that conversation was
impossible. I was there without a partner and didn't fancy prancing
about on the dance floor to &quot;Come On Eileen&quot;, and was getting so bored
that I was on the point of leaving, and then the ceilidh band came back
and all was well.

Another problem with high volume stuff that some don't understand is
that if someone is hard of hearing, they'll be wearing an aid to boost
the volume to their ear; however, most hearing aids (AFAIK) don't have
a limiter/cut off - and while you may hear 110Db as *loud*, they hear
it amplified an extra few Db up the scale - and the pain threshold of
volume is the same.  I may not have explained that very well :-[
My elder daughter has had a hearing problem since birth and, while she
is old enough to react to extreme volume and turn her aids down, it's
not always possible to react that quickly - and younger kids certainly
can't.

Isn't it all a bit pointless anyway?

&quot;Excuse me, would you like to dance?&quot;
&quot;Eh?  What did you say?&quot;
