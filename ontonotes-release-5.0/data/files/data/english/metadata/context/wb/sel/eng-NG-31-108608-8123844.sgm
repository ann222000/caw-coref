Anyone notice the MONSTER thread on Gobal Warming? It's actually too
huge to read on Google!

What is clear that Global Warming like &quot;gun control&quot; is a political
agenda where lies abound and ethical science goes out the window.

We find paid minions of the &quot;desired&quot; view infesting the Usenet and
using  clever wording and lies to further their agenda.

The Global warming thing is a great example.

They say global warming is real (it is!)
Then try to make the case that some politicians (Bush) have tried to
deny global warming. (He has in the past)
Then comes the huge &quot;leap of faith&quot; where CO2 is accused by reason of
a &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; to be the &quot;cause&quot; of global warming.
Then comes &quot;proof&quot; in the form of CO2 level charts that match global
ocean temperatures.  (This &quot;causality&quot; is a lie.)

Bottom line we all must accept global warming as due to our SUVs and
power plants or these guys will call us nasty names!

Brrrrr! I'm shaking in my boots!

This is all identical to the &quot;gun control&quot; debate where firearm
ownership is tied by the propagandists to higher crime rates.  Too bad
all scientific studies including the ones mandated by Congress and
done by the CDC found NO such connections.

So what am I getting at here?  These issues are NOT what I'm talking
about.  I&quot;m not trying to forward a political agenda here, save ONE:
To take the POLITICS out of Science!

Science, it seems has developed a certain amount of well-deserved
credibility in the public perception.  So it isn't surprising that
those with a political agenda would try to USE that public credibility
to further their political agendas.  What I'm saying here is that we
scientists, need to stand up and speak out. No, not take sides in the
debate lies. And certainly not to join all the noise of name-calling
and &quot;proofs by assertion&quot; that characterize political &quot;debates&quot;.

No!  We need to squawk loud and often about this SUBVERSION of the
integrity of Science by political agendas.  When lies are all over the
media being held up as &quot;science&quot; someone needs to point it out and
when prizes are given for bogus research they need to be taken back
and the schools embarrassed! In short all this MISUSE of OUR science
for political purpose needs to stop and it's only going to stop if WE
start speaking out instead of going along with those pretending there
is a &quot;scientific&quot; debate where there actually is none!

Well stated.

I agree with the other poster.  We need scientists like yourself to
get into the fray.

I've also noticed that it is both unproductive and unnecessary to try
to dispute or refute any of the assertions made by these AGW whackos.
Their thinking is too vague.  Attempts to dispute it only confuse the
audience and leave them with the impression that, maybe, there is
something to this hoax.  It's best to help them, encourage them, and
berate these whackos into explicating their thoughts on AGW.  Once
this is done it becomes perfectly clear that these whackos are
whacked.  In fact it becomes so clear that they themselves realize how
whacko they sound and immediately try to save face and discontinue the
conversation.

Benji appears to live in a fantacy world, where nothing but the Sun
can cause a warming effect here on Earth. In a fantacy Solar System,
where he sees signs of Global Warming happening on the other planets,
completelly a figment of his imaginations.

Now, I´m not really interested what other bits of fantacy he has to
offer.

That's not a leap of faith, that's the scientific consensus resulting
from decades of detailed, careful climate modeling by real climate
scientists, before the whole thing became politicized and unscientific
loons like yourself started trying to get involved.

If you stick to serious scientific journals, like Science (which I've
read on a weekly basis since college), it's clear that there has never
been any serious controversy about whether the current warming is
anthropogenic, nor the extent to which CO2 and other gasses are to blame
(and yes, there are others, but that's the main one).  There has been
only the ordinary haggling over the details.

This is much like another case where unscientific loons with a political
axe to grind are trying to interfere with the scientific process:
evolution.  Biologists all know evolution is real, just as
climatologists all know that anthropogenic global warming is real.  But
religious fundies try to spread uncertainty and doubt by digging up
&quot;experts&quot; who support their views, as long as you don't look too closely
at their arguments or credentials; and by blowing ordinary scientific
discourse out of proportion to make the case that the scientists haven't
any idea what's going on.

This is by now very much old hat to anybody who follows such things;
these are the standard tricks which people use to obstruct the
dissemination of scientific understanding.  It's often effective, too --
look how many people still ascribe to creationism (or some modern label
thereof such as &quot;intelligent design&quot;), and periodically get schoolboards
to interfere with the teaching of evolution, one of the central pillars
of biology.

It's a bit sad that the U.S. seems particularly susceptible to such
shenanigans; most other countries are far more rational in this respect.
I attribute this to the combination of poor science education, and an
abnormally high level of religious fervor.  Frankly, we'd be much better
off with more science and less religion, since science leads to truth,
while religion leads to dogma (often, *conflicting* dogma, which leads
to wars and other such unpleasantness) and poor decisions.

evolution is real and that you accept the currently given scientific

Stating that same old lame ass propaganda line that &quot; all scientists&quot;
BELIEVE in this fable is not science either.

Give us directly here the scientific poll of either climate scientists
or scientists in general. Or admit that, like usual, you are talking
out of your ass, making unsupported statements and are delusional in
even this fact in which you believe.

At some point you twits just may find out that it can be incredibly
dangerous to believe your own lies.

There are plenty of scientists and many more that do not believe in
this non-scientifically derived conclusion. They just do not go around
stating bald face lies like this in promotion of their propaganda.

&gt; &gt; Bullshit.  AGW is 100% propaganda, 0% science.

&gt; &gt;   But
&gt; &gt; &gt; religious fundies try to spread uncertainty and doubt by digging up

&gt; &gt; &gt; discourse out of proportion to make the case that the scientists haven't
&gt; &gt; &gt; any idea what's going on.

&gt; &gt; Surely you don't expect us to take your word on all of this.  Or do
&gt; &gt; you?

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is by now very much old hat to anybody who follows such things;

&gt; &gt;   It's often effective, too --

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's a bit sad that the U.S. seems particularly susceptible to such
&gt; &gt; &gt; shenanigans; most other countries are far more rational in this respect.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I attribute this to the combination of poor science education, and an
&gt; &gt; &gt; abnormally high level of religious fervor.  Frankly, we'd be much better
&gt; &gt; &gt; off with more science and less religion, since science leads to truth,
&gt; &gt; &gt; while religion leads to dogma (often, *conflicting* dogma, which leads
&gt; &gt; &gt; to wars and other such unpleasantness) and poor decisions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Science, it seems has developed a certain amount of well-deserved
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; credibility in the public perception.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But not enough, apparently, since politicians and religious leaders can

OK, that only took about one minute, but it shows you (or at least,
shows those willing to see), as requested.  And you're not worth any
more of my time than that.

I don't expect you to be convinced, because you are a AGW-denying loon

evidence if it conflicts with your politically motivated agenda.  But
you asked, so there it is.  No please go away, and take your

I got your poll.  It's called the IPCC, the NOAA, and the National
Academy of Sciences.  All 3 groups (comprised of literally thousands
of climatology experts, by the way) have concluded that global warming
is a) happening and b) been exacerbated by man.  And, believe it or
not dumbfuck, they've done this by actually applying the scientific
method to the issue.

Then again, how could thousands of experts with collectively hundreds

&gt; Bottom line we all must accept global warming as due to our SUVs and

&gt; Brrrrr! I'm shaking in my boots!

&gt; This is all identical to the &quot;gun control&quot; debate where firearm
&gt; ownership is tied by the propagandists to higher crime rates.  Too bad
&gt; all scientific studies including the ones mandated by Congress and
&gt; done by the CDC found NO such connections.

&gt; So what am I getting at here?  These issues are NOT what I'm talking
&gt; about.  I&quot;m not trying to forward a political agenda here, save ONE:
&gt; To take the POLITICS out of Science!

&gt; Science, it seems has developed a certain amount of well-deserved
&gt; credibility in the public perception.  So it isn't surprising that
&gt; those with a political agenda would try to USE that public credibility
&gt; to further their political agendas.  What I'm saying here is that we
&gt; scientists, need to stand up and speak out. No, not take sides in the
&gt; debate lies. And certainly not to join all the noise of name-calling
&gt; and &quot;proofs by assertion&quot; that characterize political &quot;debates&quot;.

&gt; No!  We need to squawk loud and often about this SUBVERSION of the

&gt; media being held up as &quot;science&quot; someone needs to point it out and

">

Exactly, the narrow bandwidth provided by corporate media
supplies instant consent. But its worst, China, India are
producing a diverse army of scientists and engineers who
have not grownup with the monumental monotone media.
We spend our time distracted by fools who think all they need
is to pound a irrelevent black book and be afforded equal access to
our homes and our childrens classes. America is nolonger the
land of free expression, people in China, India, freely expressing
a far larger range of opinions each fitting current scientific
understandings. Amercians super-capitalists have shat in the
scientific pie far too often when it suited them. Rolling out the
armies of God they smash any contrary freespeach that
holds to current scientific wisdom with their collective voice.
You see religion is essentiallyu socialism, and the President
is the first true communtarian. America will rebound but only
after a decade of ridiculing Jesus freaks. Science moves forward
by fertilising and nourishing a public space for open debate
that stomps on the beliefs of people of faith with a passion.

Models? How about some good old empirical stuff like actual warming.
How do you test a computer model? If I run your software and data on
my computer and I get similar results does that constitute a test?

&quot;The strategies for making mathematical models for observed phenomena
have been evolving since ancient times. An organism-- physical,
biological, or social-- is observed in different states. This observed
system is the target of the modeling activity. Its states cannot
really be described by only a few observable parameters, but we
pretend that they can.&quot; --Ralph Abraham and Christopher Shaw,

I'm not sure what your prowess in googling has to do with the state of
climate modeling.  You might want to read the model limitations section of
the IPCC FAR, for example, for a more direct indication.

Basically. they are low resolution (3 or 4 degrees), and thus don't
handle water latent heat well.  They depend heavily on arbitrary
parameters, which must be laboriously tuned to converge on past training
data. They often have a vast excess of degrees of freedom.  If you
actually have and understand any references showing otherwise, lets talk.

Oh, a warm balmy planet is a pretty nice thing in fact. You are
entirelly right to point that out. In the deep past of our planet it
actually has spent greater part of its age being warmer than today.
When certain dinosaurs, specifickly those with tall necks, were
walking about, the Earth was so warm that forests grew on the Southern
Polar continent, which appear to have felled theyr leaves during the
months of total darkness.

Now, the problem isn´t that it´s dangerous for the climate to be warm.
No, the problem lies with the time of transition between the two
different climate regimes. You may scoff at that, but literally a
number of societies may not survive through that time of transition,
i.e. till the time that the transition is over and the climate has
stabilized again.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Greenhouse, what about, a type of gasous substance which precense in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sufficient amounts makes the climate warmer than it would be in its
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; absence...does that suffice for a definition? Now, you only have to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accept that carbon dioxide can make the climate warmer if it?s present
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in sufficient amount to do just that. From that would follow arguments
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wether that is the case or not.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What part of I'm not going to argue about what &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; means
&gt; &gt; &gt; are you too blazingly stupid to understand?

&gt; &gt; You appear to be setting a pleasant standard for the argument here :)

&gt; It's your arguement, not mine.

&gt; I refuse to particpate.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How have you worked out that Global Warming is a good thing?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Clue number 1:

&gt; &gt; &gt; How many people book vacations to Alaska compared to Barmuda?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Clue number 2:

&gt; &gt; &gt; How many crops, i.e. food, are grown between 45 degrees and 90 degrees
&gt; &gt; &gt; compared to +/- 45 degrees?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Clue number 3:

&gt; &gt; &gt; The population as you go through Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska,
&gt; &gt; &gt; South Dakota, and finally get to North Dakota.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Clue number 4:

&gt; &gt; &gt; People retire and move to Arizona, New Mexico and Florida, not Maine,

&gt; &gt; Oh, a warm balmy planet is a pretty nice thing in fact. You are
&gt; &gt; entirelly right to point that out. In the deep past of our planet it
&gt; &gt; actually has spent greater part of its age being warmer than today.
&gt; &gt; When certain dinosaurs, specifickly those with tall necks, were
&gt; &gt; walking about, the Earth was so warm that forests grew on the Southern
&gt; &gt; Polar continent, which appear to have felled theyr leaves during the
&gt; &gt; months of total darkness.

&gt; &gt; Now, the problem isn?t that it?s dangerous for the climate to be warm.
&gt; &gt; No, the problem lies with the time of transition between the two
&gt; &gt; different climate regimes. You may scoff at that, but literally a
&gt; &gt; number of societies may not survive through that time of transition,
&gt; &gt; i.e. till the time that the transition is over and the climate has
&gt; &gt; stabilized again.

&gt; Such a change isn't going to happen over night, or even within a
&gt; person's lifetime, not matter what you see in the movies.

&gt; So what?

I said, the time of transition is the tricky part. Not the time when
all is over and done with.

The time of transition is already begun. That means things are on the
move already. The only thing we can affect now is the share size of
the change, and hence the extend of adaptation that will come
necessary.

What specifickly concerns me the most are India and China, preciselly
due to the share size of theyr respective populations. A disturbtion,
even only a temporary one, say a year or two, of theyr food production
could very quickly have things falling apart over in those two
countries, and the world wouldn´t be able to rescue them preciselly
due to the size of theyr respective populations.

If you yet again do scoff &quot;why should I care&quot; remember both countries
have got nuclear arms as well as the means of theyr delivery over
large distances. Both countries are after all spacepowers as well as
nuclear powers. You still are not in the least worried?

That's a fair summary.  A warming climate is going to change weather
patterns, causing droughts and desertification in previously fertile
areas, and increased rainfall (leading to soil erosion and flooding in
places) elsewhere.  And, of course increased sea levels, putting most
countries' most valuable real estate underwater.  All fine and dandy
from a 1000-km, 1000-year view, but quite a bit of a bummer if you
happen to be living someplace where you've become accustomed to growing
food, or having topsoil, or not having your house underwater.

And oh yes, it also can result in some substantial local climate changes
-- illogical as it seems to simple-minded deniers, a global warming of
climate may well plunge turn most of western Europe's local climate into
something more like Siberia, as the currents which currently cause its
temperate climate shut down.

Of course, I live on the front range of the Rocky Mountains; there won't
be much flooding here (the ice caps melt every summer anyway), and it's
already quite dry.  Things could get a bit worse for me, but not a LOT
worse.  It's the people on the coasts that I really feel for.
Unfortunately, more than half of all people in the U.S. live on or near
the coast, and the situation is probably similar for other countries
with significant coastline.  Sure, they can all relocate inland, giving
up New York, San Diego, LA, Boston, Washington DC, etc. etc., but you
may see that this is a rather expensive and messy proposition, and best
avoided if possible.

I suspect that many of the deniers are simply hoping that it won't
happen until after they're dead -- screwing our children and
grandchildren for perceived short-term gains.  But that's not a
philosophy I would subscribe to, even if I didn't hope to be here for a
long time myself.

Fortunately, the tide has shifted, and the deniers are now a pathetic
minority with no power.  Even the Denier-in-Chief has publicly admitted
reality, and started making the right sort of noises about it, albeit
without much enthusiasm.  The next President will no doubt do more.
It's probably not too late, at least not to avoid the worst of it.

But we do need some new carbon-neutral (or better) energy sources, and
we need them soon.  See the link in my sig for one I believe to be quite
promising.

Yeah.  The parallels are quite direct, and in a way, this thread is
interesting because it illustrates the tactics that those with
counter-scientific agendas use to try and deny scientific conclusions.
In the below, &quot;C&quot; stands for Creationists and &quot;D&quot; stands for
global-warming deniers:

TACTIC 1: Invent a &quot;controversy&quot; to give the impression that scientists
can't agree on whether the thing is true or not.  Often this is based on
genuine points of disagreement between real scientists, but while those
are about fine details and the scientists are in vehement agreement
about the big picture, the agenda-pushers claim that there is
disagreement about the big picture.
C1: Pointing to disagreements over continuous evolution vs. punctuated
equilibrium, they claim that scientists can't agree on whether evolution
is true.
D1: Pointing to disagreements in the detailed predictions among various
models, they claim that scientists can't agree on whether global warming
is true.

TACTIC 2: Trot out &quot;experts&quot; drummed up somewhere who are not real
scientists, but can play one on TV (and in books, magazines, etc.), to
argue against reality in scientific-sounding terms.  Real scientists
easily spot these phonies and can pick their arguments apart with one
hand behind their backs, but the average public can't, which seeds doubt
and also helps bolster tactic 1.
C2: Duane Gish, for example.  He's got a Ph.D. in Biochemistry and is a
foremost &quot;Creation Scientist&quot; (never mind the oxymoron).  I studied this
guy in college; he's a real nut job.  My science professors all agree
he's a bad scientist, and my religion professor disparages his approach
to religion as well.
D2: I don't have names handy at the moment, because I never had to study
these bozos like I did Gish, but I've read about them.  Probably one of
the deniers in this thread will trot out their favorite Denier Scientist
if we poke them enough.

TACTIC 3: Yield ground, regroup, and attempt to hold a new position.
C3: &quot;Well, OK, we can't deny the clear demonstrations of evolution
happening on a micro scale, but we still deny that *macro* evolution
ever happened.&quot;  Or, &quot;OK, maybe evolution happens, but it's all
according to the grand plan of some God^H^H^H Intelligent Designer.&quot;
D3: &quot;OK, global warming is real, but it's a natural process and humans
aren't to blame, therefore we still don't need to modify our behavior.&quot;
Or, &quot;OK, global warming is real and it's our fault, but a nice toasty
world sounds nice to me, think I'll buy some beachfront property in
Alaska.&quot;

It's actually comforting to see Tactic 3 brought out, because it means
the anti-scientific forces are losing.  Amazing how long this takes,
though -- evolution is *still* a controversy in some schools in the
Bible Belt, every 5-10 years or so.  Quite ridiculous when you think
about it.  But then, actually thinking about it is dangerous, as if done
carefully, it may lead to the truth!

I do not deny that the climate is warming, our instruments seem to indicate
that it is (have we accounted for all of the sources of error?), but the
idea that the warming is man-made, and that it will increase without bound
to cataclysmic proportions is untestable speculation. There are plenty of
stronger hypotheses out there - involving natural phenomena (e.g., the Sun)
that historically track the data better than AGW and hopelessly inadequate
computer models.

What I can predict is the misery, disease and pestilence that will occur if
governments worldwide increase their control over societies, forcing them to
fall into line with dreamed-up regulations, economies be damned. That is
historical, reproducible and testable, and I think that has a much higher
likelihood to be a global disaster than any climate change.

Yeah, and indeed, it's only because they've applied the scientific
method that they have all reached such a consensus.  That's the real
power of science: it is the only means of generating knowledge that is
constrained against reality, so that people of diverse cultures,
backgrounds, and agendas will (if they all apply the method) come to
pretty much the same conclusions.

That's why science has risen in prominence over the centuries, while
other means of gaining knowledge (e.g. divine inspiration) have
declined.  Only science produces results that (1) make predictions that

Just like the creationists.

There is a difference here, though, which just sunk in for me.  A
creationist can believe whatever he want, and as long as he doesn't
screw with the public school system, it doesn't matter much to me -- and
it certainly doesn't matter to other countries.  A country overrun with
creationists would simply decline in importance, as it's outcompeted in
the marketplace by the more scientifically literate ones.

But when it comes to global warming, it's really a global problem, and
one big country (like, say, the U.S.) can screw things up for everybody,
not just for themselves.  That's why it's so heinous that the deniers
were in power here for so long, after the rest of the world was at least
making an effort.  But the denial finally broke under the weight of
scientific opinion, and that's a sign that the system basically works if
I ever saw one.

&gt; Aztecs, Goths, Minoans, Hittites, or Bablyonians lately?

I said, the time of transition is the tricky part. Not the time when
all is over and done with.

The time of transition is already begun. That means things are on the
move already. The only thing we can affect now is the share size of
the change, and hence the extend of adaptation that will come
necessary.

What specifickly concerns me the most are India and China, preciselly
due to the share size of theyr respective populations. A disturbtion,
even only a temporary one, say a year or two, of theyr food production
could very quickly have things falling apart over in those two
countries, and the world wouldn´t be able to rescue them preciselly
due to the size of theyr respective populations.

If you yet again do scoff &quot;why should I care&quot; remember both countries
have got nuclear arms as well as the means of theyr delivery over
large distances. Both countries are after all spacepowers as well as
nuclear powers. You still are not in the least worried?
