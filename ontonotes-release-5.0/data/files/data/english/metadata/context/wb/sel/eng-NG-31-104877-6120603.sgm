Poore soule the center of my sinfull earth,
My sinfull earth these rebbell powres that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
Painting thy outward walls so costlie gay?
Why so large cost hauing so short a lease,
Dost thou vpon thy fading mansion spend?
Shall wormes inheritors of this excesse
Eate vp thy charge? is this thy bodies end?
Then soule liue thou vpon thy seruants losse,
And let that pine to aggrauat thy store;
Buy tearmes diuine in selling houres of drosse:
Within be fed, without be rich no more,
So shalt thou feed on death,that feeds on men,
And death once dead,ther's no more dying then.

Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
Feeding these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
Shall worms inheritors of this excess
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross,
Within be fed, without be rich no more.
So shalt thou feed on death, that feeds on men,
And death once dead, there's no more dying then.

Jules VERnE:  *Journey to the CENTRE OF THE EARTH*

&lt;&lt;Presently, after lying quietly for some minutes,
I opened my eyes and looked upwards.
As I did so I made out a brilliant little dot, at the extremity
of this long, gigantic telescope. It was a star without
scintillating rays. According to my calculation,
it must be Beta in the constellation of the Little Bear.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible
in incipent lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous
scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an
observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000
ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth:&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;KOCHAB, an obscure Arabic name that might simply mean "star," is
just
barely the second brightest, and appropriately the Beta, star in Ursa
Minor, and represents the top front bowl star of the Little Dipper.
Only 15 degrees from the north celestial pole, middle northerners can
see it every night as it plies its small circular path. Together with
the other bowl star (Pherkad, the Gamma star), it makes a small
asterism called the "Guardians of the Pole," the two seeming in myth
to
"protect" the pole star. Though we are quite familiar with the major
two motions of the Earth, daily rotation and annual revolution, the
third motion, precession, is more obscure. The Moon and Sun act on the
Earth's rotational bulge, and cause the axis to wobble over a 26,000
year period. The result is that the axis continually moves in a small
circle against the background stars. Polaris is thus only a temporary
pole star that will get better into the next century and then will
begin to shift away. About the year 1100 BC, the pole made a
reasonably
close pass to Kochab, and there are old references to THIS star being
called "Polaris."&gt;&gt;

Here we have another unique sonnet. It looks as if
Shakespeare thought this was a good place in the book to
display his versatility. Alas, someone in the copying
process allowed in a careless blunder. The repetition of 'my
sinful earth' at the beginning of line 2 is unShakespearian
(he does  not repeat himself), it conveys no meaning and it
gives us four syllables where we need two. No doubt there
will be someone to defend it!

The emendation 'feeding' is attributed by Burrow to
'Sebastian Evans in Cambridge 1893', an edition of the Works
edited by W.A. Wright. It is powerfully supported by Helen
Vendler , who among much else refers to a comment by Walton
Litz that lines 1-2 generate line 9, lines 3-4 generate line
10, lines 5-6 generate line 11 and lines 7-8 generate line
12. The idea of feeding, and the word itself, pervade the
poem.

There is no difficulty in saying the transmitted text is
wrong, but with this kind of error, which obliterates all
trace of the original words, there can be no claim of
certainty for any emendation. Still, the case looks good to
me.

The fallen angels in line 2 would fit into Paradise Lost,
but the story is far older than Milton.

The advice in lines 9-12 seems very abstract and
metaphorical. I am not clear what is being prescribed.
Fasting and prayer? Giving to the poor?

S146 Paraphrase.

-------
1. Poor soul, the center of my sinful, personal world,
2. {Renounce} these "rebel" forces that you've fielded!
(and must pay for)

The correct wording at the beginning of line 2 is unknown, due to a
misprint in the original.  I supply the word "renounce" because it
appears to express the intended sentiment, and it also has a
definition as a legal term -- the Poet was inclined to use common
words that were also legal terms.

I take the tone of the opening couplet to be imperative, or
adjuratory.  The Poet is "preaching" to his own soul.  The "rebel"
forces are the flesh and its associated desires, which desires are
selfish, easily leading the body into sin, contrary to what's good for
the soul.  The soul commands the body, in classical depiction, but the
body is also rebellious against the best interests of the soul,
because of the desires of the flesh -- this internal struggle is a
paradox of the human condition.

"Renounce", or any wording supplied at the start of line 2, is only a
reader's guess, nothing more.  The Poet did use "renounce" in his
plays some 5 times, including the following from King Lear, where the
word "world" also appears.  So, the Poet did place "renounce" near the
word "world" in this type of sentiment, at least in Lear.

-=-=-
King Lear
Act 4, Scene 6
Gloucester [Kneeling]  O you mighty gods!
This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
Shake patiently my great affliction off:
=-=-=

Back to the Sonnet.....

3. Why do you (my soul) languish within (my body,)
and suffer deprivation of what's good for you, while allowing
4. Decoration of your outward, bodily appearance, with such
lavish expense?

5. Why so much wealth, on something that
lasts such a short time,
6. Do you spend upon your decaying embodiment?

7. Shall worms, the inevitable inheritors of this excess
expenditure on the body,
8. Ultimately consume your bodily forces, and the cost of them?
Is this the body's end?  [The answer is "yes."]

9. Since this must be the case, my soul, nourish yourself
by depriving your servant, the body,
10. And let the body languish, to increase your own merits;

11. "Purchase" time for divinity by "selling" hours
of worldly wastefulness;
12. "Feast" within, and don't worry about an external
show of wealth, for the body.

13.     Thusly, my soul, you will prey on Death, that
feeds on men,
14.     And by "consuming" Death, you'll gain eternal life.
=======

In this Sonnet, the Poet's hopes turn from the natural world to his
prospects for the hereafter.  As Gary mentions, there's no sign of
Fair Youth or Dark Lady this time; the Poet's attention is on
himself.  It is probably a late Sonnet, since thoughts of death loom
larger as one ages.  The compositor was probably correct to position
this Sonnet near the end of the series.  The theme places it late in
the Poet's career.

The "Painting" idea, line 4, also tends to go along with aging, as in
the use of makeup by women to conceal skin effects of aging.
"Painting" is a prominent theme of Hamlet, and also mentioned
elsewhere by the Poet.  He was against "painting," apparently from
seeing so much of it, so misused.

The Poet adjures his soul to pay less heed to things of the body, and
attend more to spiritual health.  As Robert says, the specifics are
not given, but it's likely the Poet refers to simpler diet and
clothing, and a humble lifestyle in general.  It's traditional, and
classical, that religious health is gained by abstinence from the
luxuries of the world, and by limiting even the necessities.

I do not see the relationship within the Sonnet that Walton Litz
proposed, mentioned by Robert.  The "feeding" concept enters at line
8, clearly enough, but introducing it as a judgment call at line 2
only begs the question.  There is also the elementary point that the
body is not, in fact, fed by the soul, rather, the body is fed by the
foodstuff of the world, the fruits of the earth.  So I reject that,
and take it that the Poet is calling upon his soul to renounce the
things of the body, as I mention above, and with some support from the
Lear quote, at least, which provides a case of association between
"world" and "renounce" in the Poet's writings.

Now, of course the Poet used the word "earth" in his Sonnet, and not
"world," which is the word I use in my paraphrase.  I'm taking it that
there's a "world" concept in the Poet's use of "earth."  It's
arguable, certainly, how well the Lear quote applies, and how far the
concepts can be stretched to accomodate words other than the Poet's
exact ones.  And it's true the Poet did place "feed" or a form thereof
near the word "earth" in some of his writings, notably Richard II and
V &amp; A.

The theory that this was an accident
requires us to believe that there was no
checking or copy-proofing whatever --
not by the printer, nor anyone else in the
print shop, and certainly not by the poet,
nor anyone associated with him, nor by
any publisher (whether honest or piratical).
Errors of this dimension are unknown in
both modern and Elizabethan texts.  Were
one to occur, the whole book would be
rejected -- then as much as today -- and
the printer would be told to do the whole
thing again.

Printing was very much slower and more
expensive then, while checking was no
different.  In this case, one does not have to
know the language, nor read the text, to see
the 'problem'.  Line 2 in its printed form is
much longer than it 'should' be -- much longer
than all the other lines in the Sonnet, and
much longer than any others on the page.
It stands like the proverbial sore thumb.
The 'error' is so huge that it could not
possibly have been missed.

As most here probably know, the printing
process involved the setting out of the type
for sixteen pages at a time -- with about 40
sonnets.  A print run for the required number
of copies (250?) was then made.  The print
blocks were then broken up and the next
sixteen pages set.   Proof-readings would
have been done on the first copy to come
off the printing block, but even the most
cursory would pick up an error of the size
posited here.  If the error was not found at
this point, but later, the minimum amount of
work for the printer, would be the resetting
of those sixteen pages and the reprinting of
that run.  The amount of effort a printer
would put into checking would bear a close
relationship to the cost of fixing mistakes.

The traditional case has long been that the
Sonnets were very badly printed -- far worse
than almost any other texts of the day.  Yet
there are no typos of the usual sort, such as
where 'and' is printed as 'adn', or 'the' comes
out as 'teh', or or the same word is is repeated
(like the two last 'or's and 'is's).  The case for
'bad printing' cannot withstand inspection.

1.   Poore soule the center of my sinfull earth,
2.   My sinfull earth these rebbell powres that thee array,
3.   Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
4.   Painting thy outward walls so costlie gay?

So why is 'my sinfull earth' repeated?
Clearly in line 2 it is meant to stand in for
a two-syllable word, probably a verb
ending in '-ing'.

What verb, ending in '-ing', would the
poet want to use, but feel unable to put
into print?  It is also probably something
to do with 'sinfull', 'center' and 'earth'.

Tough, eh?

Paul.

&gt; that run.  The amount of effort a printer
&gt; would put into checking would bear a close
&gt; relationship to the cost of fixing mistakes.

&gt; The traditional case has long been that the
&gt; Sonnets were very badly printed -- far worse
&gt; than almost any other texts of the day.  Yet
&gt; there are no typos of the usual sort, such as
&gt; where 'and' is printed as 'adn', or 'the' comes
&gt; out as 'teh', or or the same word is is repeated
&gt; (like the two last 'or's and 'is's).  The case for
&gt; 'bad printing' cannot withstand inspection.

&gt; 1.   Poore soule the center of my sinfull earth,
&gt; 2.   My sinfull earth these rebbell powres that thee array,
&gt; 3.   Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
&gt; 4.   Painting thy outward walls so costlie gay?

&gt; So why is 'my sinfull earth' repeated?
&gt; Clearly in line 2 it is meant to stand in for
&gt; a two-syllable word, probably a verb
&gt; ending in '-ing'.

&gt; What verb, ending in '-ing', would the
&gt; poet want to use, but feel unable to put
&gt; into print?  It is also probably something
&gt; to do with 'sinfull', 'center' and 'earth'.

&gt; Tough, eh?
">

Could be a one-syllable word ending in '-ed by'.

Gary, I did see your question, but my response is going
to take a little longer than this one!

Guys, I don't post here any more, because I can't stand all the
screaming and insults back and forth (not by Robert and Gary, of
course). But I do still read the sonnet threads.

I was thinking about this sonnet. It seems to me that as well as
addressing his soul, Shakespeare could be addressing another person.
Perhaps the fair youth, whose beauty is fading?

This sonnet does seems to me to link up in a way with the fair youth
sonnets, particularly the marriage sonnets. The language of the pleas
to get an heir are somewhat echoed in

Shall wormes inheritors of this excesse
Eate vp thy charge? is this thy bodies end?
Then soule liue thou vpon thy seruants losse,
And let that pine to aggrauat thy store...

although the message is undeniably different. Instead of "Stop wasting
your life, and get an heir before you die," it's more "Stop wasting
your life and make something worthwhile of yourself before you die."

It also seems a kind of antithesis of Sonnet 18, and brought me back
to it with the "having so short a lease" half line. Perhaps this is
the same addressee grown older, and the sonnet is out of place. I
believe it may belong at the very end of the fair youth suite. But I
disagree that it comes out of nowhere.

Best wishes,
Mouse

&gt; &gt;poem.

&gt; &gt;There is no difficulty in saying the transmitted text is

&gt; &gt;The fallen angels in line 2 would fit into Paradise Lost,

&gt;         For once we have a poem that might lend itself to Michael

&gt; doesn't this poem contradict the supposed atheism of 125?)

And there do seem to be ironically, many words which *might* refer to
sex, in this "spritual" sonnet, or so it seems to me: sinful, pine
within (wanting buggery?) cost, excess, charge (?) store (a word often
repeated in the FY sonnets), hours of dross. But it's the line above
that persuades me of it-- Once one is dead, or has triumphed over
death, "there's no more dying then."

Remember, "But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
Die single and thine image dies with thee."

I argued that the last line meant, "If you only "die single", i.e.
"die" or have orgasms on your own, you'll never be a father."

I would argue here that on at least one level, the poet is saying in
this sonnet that once one is dead, there are no more orgasms.

Very interesting sonnet. The sexual imagery, which I at least think
may be there, is antithetical to the spiritual imagery, which is
certainly there. If Paul's going to say it's about feces, which I
think I see coming, ;) I don't agree.

&gt; do you spend to restore your crumbling building?&gt;Shall worms inheritors of this excess

&gt; Are the worms which will get all this in the end&gt;Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?

&gt; to feed at your expense? Is that what your body is for?

&gt; &gt;Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss

&gt; Soul, you should take from the body for your own sustenance,&gt;And let that pine to aggravate thy store;

&gt; let the body go short to increase your spiritual wealth,&gt;Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross,

&gt; sell off short-lived valueless stuff in exchange for God's
&gt; immortality,&gt;Within be fed, without be rich no more.

&gt; take inward nourishment and give up the outward appearances
&gt; of wealth.

&gt; &gt;      So shalt thou feed on death, that feeds on men,

&gt; By doing that, you will tear apart death, which tears men
&gt; apart,&gt;      And death once dead, there's no more dying then.

&gt; and when death is destroyed, you have no more danger of
&gt; dying.

&gt; Here we have another unique sonnet. It looks as if
&gt; Shakespeare thought this was a good place in the book to
&gt; display his versatility. Alas, someone in the copying
&gt; process allowed in a careless blunder. The repetition of 'my
&gt; sinful earth' at the beginning of line 2 is unShakespearian
&gt; (he does  not repeat himself), it conveys no meaning and it
&gt; gives us four syllables where we need two. No doubt there
&gt; will be someone to defend it!

&gt; The emendation 'feeding' is attributed by Burrow to
&gt; 'Sebastian Evans in Cambridge 1893', an edition of the Works
&gt; edited by W.A. Wright. It is powerfully supported by Helen
&gt; Vendler , who among much else refers to a comment by Walton
&gt; Litz that lines 1-2 generate line 9, lines 3-4 generate line
&gt; 10, lines 5-6 generate line 11 and lines 7-8 generate line
&gt; 12. The idea of feeding, and the word itself, pervade the
&gt; poem.

&gt; There is no difficulty in saying the transmitted text is
&gt; wrong, but with this kind of error, which obliterates all
&gt; trace of the original words, there can be no claim of
&gt; certainty for any emendation. Still, the case looks good to
&gt; me.

&gt; The fallen angels in line 2 would fit into Paradise Lost,
&gt; but the story is far older than Milton.

&gt; The advice in lines 9-12 seems very abstract and
&gt; metaphorical. I am not clear what is being prescribed.
&gt; Fasting and prayer? Giving to the poor?
">

Just general Christian goodness, I should think.  I find this poem
extremely pedestrian.  My guess is that Shakespeare wrote it when very
young, to express very standard thoughts about proper Christian
behaviour, then kept it for sentimental reasons--and/or, perhaps, to
mitigate the naughtiness of most of the other sonnets.  I find no
secondary meanings in it.

In spite of Crowley's insistence that printers' errors don't occur,
the extra "my sinful earth" has to be that--or some kind of weird
mistake in the manuscript.  Poets do make weird mistakes at times.

Printers' errors do, of course, occur.  But of
THIS size?   Have you looked at the original
page in the Quarto?

http://extra.shu.ac.uk/emls/Sonnets/i3r.jpg

An illiterate, half-blind printer's assistant
could spot that there was something
wrong on that page.

NOT ONE other work of poetry has EVER
been as 'badly printed' as Shakespeare's
Sonnets -- according to Strats.  Does that
claim not strike you as possibly containing
an element of special pleading?

Sure they do -- but, as ever with Shake-
speare's "mistakes" you forget that there
are tribes of others involved -- unless you
think that he was personally responsible
for the printing and the publication -- in the
way as he put on the plays as monologues
-- performed by himself -- and then
personally handled all their printing.

&gt; For once we have a poem that might lend itself to Michael
&gt; Martin's approach.

&gt; (And a question for Peter if he happens to be reading:
&gt; doesn't this poem contradict the supposed atheism of 125?)
">

Not necessarily. In fact I would suggest that the atheism
indicated by 125 - being far more strongly supported by
religious references than this one is - means that we need
to question whether the almost universal assumption that
this is a 'Christian' sonnet is actually correct.

You say that this doesn't seem to have anything to do with
the Dark Lady, but why not? No fewer than 17 of the 25
surrounding sonnets are apparently addressed to her, and
the other 8 (with the possible exceptions of 129 &amp; 145)
almost certainly about her. At least the first two quat-
rains of this one could just as easily have been addressed
to her.

1. Poore soule the center of my sinfull earth,

'Poor soul' as a form of address is used throughout the
canon in reference to a *person* (or in one case a lamb)
who for some reason is to be pitied.

Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee.
(Simpcox)

Go, go, poor soul. I envy not thy glory.
(Lady Anne)

Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
(Juliet)

Alack, poor soul, thou hast need of more rags to
lay on thee rather than have these off.
(Autolycus)

It is also worth noting that only a few sonnets earlier
he had been writing about her in terms of his 'sin', so
he might well describe her as the centre of his 'sinful
earth':

Only my plague thus far I count my gain:
That she that makes me sin awards me pain.
(141)

Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving.
(142)

Grounded?

It may also relate to Sonnet 144's idea of the "female
evil", suggesting perhaps that the "better angel" is the
centre of his purer world. A central theme of the whole
Sonnet is dying, of course, so we should perhaps also
note the phrase "thys synneful worlde" in the 1559
Burial Service.

2. (...) these rebbell powres that thee array,

Robert's 'feeding' is as good a guess as any. When we
discussed this on SHAKSPER recently, I suggested
"sieged by", but I now think that "feeding" is more
likely. My amendment of Paul's idea to "****ed by" is
quite appealing though!

The "rebbell powres" that "array" her I would take
mainly to be the physical signs of ageing which are
afflicting or even disfiguring her. The OED actually
quotes "Indeed age hath arrayed thee!" as an example
of the latter.

3. Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
4. Painting thy outward walls so costlie gay?

Why do you let your mind go hungry, while spending so
much on decorating and renovating your physical self?

5. Why so large cost hauing so short a lease,
6. Dost thou vpon thy fading mansion spend?

Why spend so much time and money on your disinteg-
rating body, given that you have possession of it
for so short a time?

7. Shall wormes inheritors of this excesse
8. Eate vp thy charge? is this thy bodies end?

I can't do any better than Robert on this: "Are the
worms which will get all this in the end to feed at
your expense? Is that what your body is for?"
I certainly like the idea of "end" being about its
purpose as well as its termination.

9. Then soule liue thou vpon thy seruants losse,
10. And let that pine to aggrauat thy store;

I think that at this point the meaning of 'soul' does
change from the person alone to something which more
addresses the intellectual or spiritual power *within*
that person (see Stonehouse's Law of Changed Meanings).
They should spend more time and effort on developing
this than on saving their looks. 'Spiritual' need not
mean 'religious', of course.

11. Buy tearmes diuine in selling houres of drosse:

Shakespeare uses the words "term" or "terms" as nouns
some 85 times, and about two thirds of the time he
means words or expressions, such as in:

With many holiday and lady terms
He questioned me;

The other third mainly concern conditions of some
kind:

'Tis not well
That you and I should meet upon such terms
As now we meet.

But just a few are about *limited* spans of time:

I am thy father's spirit,
Doomed for a certain term to walk the night,

and I found only one of these in the plural, refer-
ring to the legal year:

...the wearing out of six fashions - which is
four terms, or two actions

Given the comparison with "hours", I nevertheless
think that it must be lengths of time he is talking
about here. However, I certainly can't see this as
having anything to do with eternity, which is by
definition *unlimited*.

"Divine" need not have a religious meaning either.
The OED (5.b) gives "Of things: Of surpassing beauty,
perfection, excellence, etc.; extraordinarily good
or great." and quotes *Romeo and Juliet*:

Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!

So, "swap the recrementitious hours you waste (in
titivating your body) for times of surpassing beauty
(in developing your mind)" - or something like that?

12. Within be fed, without be rich no more,

Wise up mind-wise (and body-wise likewise?).

13. So shalt thou feed on death,that feeds on men,
14. And death once dead,ther's no more dying then.

There can be little doubt that the poet had the words
of the burial service in the back of his mind: "The
laste enemye that shalbe destroyed is deathe". On the
other hand, I can't help being reminded of the Bishop
of Carlisle's words in *Richard II* in which we find,
surprisingly for a bishop, little if any 'religion':

To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe;
And so your follies fight against yourself.
Fear, and be slain. No worse can come to fight;
And fight and die is death destroying death,
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.

Peter G. has also reminded us a couple of times at
least of the (Friar) Duke's rather pagan advice to
Claudio about facing death. (MfM 5.1.5-41)

In the sonnet, is he similarly saying that it is the
*fear* of dying (as represented by her concentration
on the "fading mansion") that can be minimized by
changing to being "fed within"? And once she is
*really* dead, the process of dying - and suffering -
stops anyway.

Yes, I think this sonnet might alternatively be about the DL, although
the language is much more reminiscent of that used for the FY, I
think.

But one of the characteristics of the FYM, the "better angel",

his/her "walls so costly gay", it seems to me to be more likely that

Nor does it mean 'atheism' either.  In any event, it's a
confusing two lines.  The meaning may be that the body (presumably
referred to by the "servant" and "that") should be disdained, which
will somehow lead to an increase in the addressee's spirit.  Or maybe
that isn't the meaning.

"Recrementitious"?  "Titivating"?  Just where do you find

In any event, given the emphasis on death in the poem, it
seems to me that "divine" is being used in a religious sense.  Even if
he/she develops her mind rather than beautifies his/her body, he/she
will still die.  Thus I think "divine" is being used in the

&gt;&gt; and when death is destroyed, you have no more danger of
&gt;&gt; dying.

&gt;And there do seem to be ironically, many words which *might* refer to
&gt;sex, in this &quot;spritual&quot; sonnet, or so it seems to me: sinful, pine
&gt;within (wanting buggery?) cost, excess, charge (?) store (a word often
&gt;repeated in the FY sonnets), hours of dross. But it's the line above
&gt;that persuades me of it-- Once one is dead, or has triumphed over
&gt;death, &quot;there's no more dying then.&quot;
">

Does this interpretation of particular phrases add up to a
coherent version of the argument of the poem? In the early
days (1996?) I held out for some time against doing an
interlinear paraphrase because it seemed to disguise the
continuity of the overall argument. I am still convinced
that the first thing to do (not the last thing, and not a
particularly elevated thing) is to grasp the argument as a
whole. Following that, we can go on to other things, but
without it we are merely bombinating in a vacuum.

On the other hand, it would be hard to write a religious
poem without referring to sin. Most of these other words are
very common ones. A lot of common words can be taken in
special ways - I see I have just written about an 'elevated
thing', and what could prurient imagination make of that?
But this sonnet reads to me like a perfectly serious
discussion of a religious point, coming in a group of unique
sonnets because Shakespeare has decided to have such a group
in his book - not just out of nowhere.

&gt;Remember, &quot;But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
&gt;Die single and thine image dies with thee.&quot;

&gt;I argued that the last line meant, &quot;If you only &quot;die single&quot;, i.e.
&gt;&quot;die&quot; or have orgasms on your own, you'll never be a father.&quot;

&gt;I would argue here that on at least one level, the poet is saying in
&gt;this sonnet that once one is dead, there are no more orgasms.

&gt;Very interesting sonnet. The sexual imagery, which I at least think
&gt;may be there, is antithetical to the spiritual imagery, which is
&gt;certainly there. If Paul's going to say it's about feces, which I
&gt;think I see coming, ;) I don't agree.

&gt;L.

&gt;&gt; Here we have another unique sonnet. It looks as if
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare thought this was a good place in the book to
&gt;&gt; display his versatility. Alas, someone in the copying
&gt;&gt; process allowed in a careless blunder. The repetition of 'my
&gt;&gt; sinful earth' at the beginning of line 2 is unShakespearian
&gt;&gt; (he does  not repeat himself), it conveys no meaning and it
&gt;&gt; gives us four syllables where we need two. No doubt there
&gt;&gt; will be someone to defend it!

&gt;&gt; The emendation 'feeding' is attributed by Burrow to
&gt;&gt; 'Sebastian Evans in Cambridge 1893', an edition of the Works
&gt;&gt; edited by W.A. Wright. It is powerfully supported by Helen
&gt;&gt; Vendler , who among much else refers to a comment by Walton
&gt;&gt; Litz that lines 1-2 generate line 9, lines 3-4 generate line
&gt;&gt; 10, lines 5-6 generate line 11 and lines 7-8 generate line
&gt;&gt; 12. The idea of feeding, and the word itself, pervade the
&gt;&gt; poem.

&gt;&gt; There is no difficulty in saying the transmitted text is
&gt;&gt; wrong, but with this kind of error, which obliterates all
&gt;&gt; trace of the original words, there can be no claim of
&gt;&gt; certainty for any emendation. Still, the case looks good to
&gt;&gt; me.

&gt;&gt; The fallen angels in line 2 would fit into Paradise Lost,
&gt;&gt; but the story is far older than Milton.

&gt;&gt; The advice in lines 9-12 seems very abstract and
&gt;&gt; metaphorical. I am not clear what is being prescribed.
&gt;&gt; Fasting and prayer? Giving to the poor?

&gt; &gt;&gt; For once we have a poem that might lend itself to Michael
&gt; &gt;&gt; Martin's approach.

&gt; &gt;&gt; (And a question for Peter if he happens to be reading:
&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn't this poem contradict the supposed atheism of 125?)

&gt; &gt;Not necessarily. In fact I would suggest that the atheism
&gt; &gt;indicated by 125 - being far more strongly supported by
&gt; &gt;religious references than this one is - means that we need
&gt; &gt;to question whether the almost universal assumption that
&gt; &gt;this is a 'Christian' sonnet is actually correct.

&gt; &gt;You say that this doesn't seem to have anything to do with
&gt; &gt;the Dark Lady, but why not? No fewer than 17 of the 25
&gt; &gt;surrounding sonnets are apparently addressed to her, and
&gt; &gt;the other 8 (with the possible exceptions of 129 &amp; 145)
&gt; &gt;almost certainly about her. At least the first two quat-
&gt; &gt;rains of this one could just as easily have been addressed
&gt; &gt;to her.

&gt; &gt; 1. Poore soule the center of my sinfull earth,

&gt; &gt;'Poor soul' as a form of address is used throughout the
&gt; &gt;canon in reference to a *person* (or in one case a lamb)
&gt; &gt;who for some reason is to be pitied.

&gt; &gt;   Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee.
&gt; &gt;   (Simpcox)

&gt; &gt;   Go, go, poor soul. I envy not thy glory.
&gt; &gt;   (Lady Anne)

&gt; &gt;   Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
&gt; &gt;   (Juliet)

&gt; &gt;   Alack, poor soul, thou hast need of more rags to
&gt; &gt;   lay on thee rather than have these off.
&gt; &gt;   (Autolycus)

&gt; &gt;It is also worth noting that only a few sonnets earlier
&gt; &gt;he had been writing about her in terms of his 'sin', so
&gt; &gt;he might well describe her as the centre of his 'sinful
&gt; &gt;earth':

&gt; &gt;   Only my plague thus far I count my gain:
&gt; &gt;   That she that makes me sin awards me pain.
&gt; &gt;   (141)

&gt; &gt;   Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
&gt; &gt;   Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving.
&gt; &gt;   (142)

&gt; &gt;Grounded?

&gt;         Lynne earlier pointed out that &quot;soul&quot; might be a reference to
&gt; another person rather than the speaker's inner spirit.  Which is
&gt; something that simply had not occurred to me.  But congrats to both of
&gt; you for noting it.  Neither KDJ or Kerrigan seem to consider the
&gt; possibility.  Booth considers it, but seems to reject it.

&gt; &gt;It may also relate to Sonnet 144's idea of the &quot;female
&gt; &gt;evil&quot;, suggesting perhaps that the &quot;better angel&quot; is the
&gt; &gt;centre of his purer world.

&gt;         But one of the characteristics of the FYM, the &quot;better angel&quot;,
&gt; is that he is naturally beautiful - &quot;A woman's face with nature's own
&gt; hand painted&quot;.  So when the speaker says the addressee is &quot;painting&quot;
&gt; his/her &quot;walls so costly gay&quot;, it seems to me to be more likely that
&gt; he is speaking to the DL (if he is, in fact, speaking to one of the
&gt; two of them).
">

Those are outer walls, of course, and I took the line to mean costume
and jewels, as they would be "costly," although it could possibly mean
face paint. Again, this could be "turning" the imagery used in the
earlier FY sonnets, because the FY is aging.

I think we'd have to look at this sonnet very carefully to decide
whether it's the FY or the DL he's talking about. Does Shakespeare
suggest, anywhere in the vicinity of this sonnet, that the DL is
aging, for example? That would be a clue.

And then, of course, there are other characters in the sonnets. Sonnet
7 at some level is almost certainly talking about a particular
dissipated royal or other aristocrat, for example:

Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
Serving with looks his sacred majesty...

And then there's also maybe Shakespeare's son:

But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.

as well as the rival poet. So it's a mystery. ;)

&gt; &gt;about here. However, I certainly can't see this as
&gt; &gt;having anything to do with eternity, which is by
&gt; &gt;definition *unlimited*.

&gt;         But they certainly seem to be religious in some sense.
&gt; &quot;[T]erms divine&quot; suggests to me time spent in heaven.

&gt; &gt;&quot;Divine&quot; need not have a religious meaning either.
&gt; &gt;The OED (5.b) gives &quot;Of things: Of surpassing beauty,
&gt; &gt;perfection, excellence, etc.; extraordinarily good
&gt; &gt;or great.&quot; and quotes *Romeo and Juliet*:

&gt; &gt;   Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
&gt; &gt;   Despised substance of divinest show!

&gt; &gt;So, &quot;swap the recrementitious hours you waste (in
&gt; &gt;titivating your body) for times of surpassing beauty
&gt; &gt;(in developing your mind)&quot; - or something like that?

&gt;         &quot;Recrementitious&quot;?  &quot;Titivating&quot;?  Just where do you find
&gt; these words, Farey?  Sheesh!

&gt;         In any event, given the emphasis on death in the poem, it
&gt; seems to me that &quot;divine&quot; is being used in a religious sense.  Even if
&gt; he/she develops her mind rather than beautifies his/her body, he/she
&gt; will still die.  Thus I think &quot;divine&quot; is being used in the
&gt; 'other-worldly' sense.

&gt; &gt;12. Within be fed, without be rich no more,

&gt; &gt;Wise up mind-wise (and body-wise likewise?).

&gt;         Not body-wise, I don't think.  There's a monkish, puritanical
&gt; overtone here.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;       And death once dead,ther's no more dying then.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; For once we have a poem that might lend itself to Michael
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Martin's approach.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (And a question for Peter if he happens to be reading:
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; doesn't this poem contradict the supposed atheism of 125?)

&gt; &gt; &gt;Not necessarily. In fact I would suggest that the atheism
&gt; &gt; &gt;indicated by 125 - being far more strongly supported by
&gt; &gt; &gt;religious references than this one is - means that we need
&gt; &gt; &gt;to question whether the almost universal assumption that
&gt; &gt; &gt;this is a 'Christian' sonnet is actually correct.

&gt; &gt; &gt;You say that this doesn't seem to have anything to do with
&gt; &gt; &gt;the Dark Lady, but why not? No fewer than 17 of the 25
&gt; &gt; &gt;surrounding sonnets are apparently addressed to her, and
&gt; &gt; &gt;the other 8 (with the possible exceptions of 129 &amp; 145)
&gt; &gt; &gt;almost certainly about her. At least the first two quat-
&gt; &gt; &gt;rains of this one could just as easily have been addressed
&gt; &gt; &gt;to her.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Poore soule the center of my sinfull earth,

&gt; &gt; &gt;'Poor soul' as a form of address is used throughout the
&gt; &gt; &gt;canon in reference to a *person* (or in one case a lamb)
&gt; &gt; &gt;who for some reason is to be pitied.

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   (Simpcox)

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Go, go, poor soul. I envy not thy glory.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   (Lady Anne)

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   (Juliet)

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Alack, poor soul, thou hast need of more rags to
&gt; &gt; &gt;   lay on thee rather than have these off.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   (Autolycus)

&gt; &gt; &gt;It is also worth noting that only a few sonnets earlier
&gt; &gt; &gt;he had been writing about her in terms of his 'sin', so
&gt; &gt; &gt;he might well describe her as the centre of his 'sinful
&gt; &gt; &gt;earth':

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Only my plague thus far I count my gain:
&gt; &gt; &gt;   That she that makes me sin awards me pain.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   (141)

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   (142)

&gt; &gt; &gt;Grounded?

&gt; &gt;         Lynne earlier pointed out that &quot;soul&quot; might be a reference to
&gt; &gt; another person rather than the speaker's inner spirit.  Which is
&gt; &gt; something that simply had not occurred to me.  But congrats to both of
&gt; &gt; you for noting it.  Neither KDJ or Kerrigan seem to consider the
&gt; &gt; possibility.  Booth considers it, but seems to reject it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;It may also relate to Sonnet 144's idea of the &quot;female
&gt; &gt; &gt;evil&quot;, suggesting perhaps that the &quot;better angel&quot; is the
&gt; &gt; &gt;centre of his purer world.

&gt; &gt;         But one of the characteristics of the FYM, the &quot;better angel&quot;,
&gt; &gt; is that he is naturally beautiful - &quot;A woman's face with nature's own
&gt; &gt; hand painted&quot;.  So when the speaker says the addressee is &quot;painting&quot;
&gt; &gt; his/her &quot;walls so costly gay&quot;, it seems to me to be more likely that
&gt; &gt; he is speaking to the DL (if he is, in fact, speaking to one of the
&gt; &gt; two of them).

&gt; Those are outer walls, of course, and I took the line to mean costume
&gt; and jewels, as they would be &quot;costly,&quot; although it could possibly mean
&gt; face paint. Again, this could be &quot;turning&quot; the imagery used in the
&gt; earlier FY sonnets, because the FY is aging.

&gt; I think we'd have to look at this sonnet very carefully to decide
&gt; whether it's the FY or the DL he's talking about. Does Shakespeare
&gt; suggest, anywhere in the vicinity of this sonnet, that the DL is
&gt; aging, for example? That would be a clue.

&gt; And then, of course, there are other characters in the sonnets. Sonnet
&gt; 7 at some level is almost certainly talking about a particular
&gt; dissipated royal or other aristocrat, for example:

&gt; Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
&gt; Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
&gt; Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
&gt; Serving with looks his sacred majesty...

&gt; And then there's also maybe Shakespeare's son:

&gt; But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,
&gt; The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.

&gt; as well as the rival poet. So it's a mystery. ;)

&gt; Mouse

&gt; &gt; &gt;A central theme of the whole
&gt; &gt; &gt;Sonnet is dying, of course, so we should perhaps also
&gt; &gt; &gt;note the phrase &quot;thys synneful worlde&quot; in the 1559
&gt; &gt; &gt;Burial Service.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. (...) these rebbell powres that thee array,

&gt; &gt; &gt;Robert's 'feeding' is as good a guess as any. When we
&gt; &gt; &gt;discussed this on SHAKSPER recently, I suggested
&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;sieged by&quot;, but I now think that &quot;feeding&quot; is more
&gt; &gt; &gt;likely. My amendment of Paul's idea to &quot;****ed by&quot; is
&gt; &gt; &gt;quite appealing though!

&gt; &gt;         Which also supports the idea of the DL's promiscuity!

&gt; &gt; &gt;The &quot;rebbell powres&quot; that &quot;array&quot; her I would take
&gt; &gt; &gt;mainly to be the physical signs of ageing which are
&gt; &gt; &gt;afflicting or even disfiguring her. The OED actually
&gt; &gt; &gt;quotes &quot;Indeed age hath arrayed thee!&quot; as an example
&gt; &gt; &gt;of the latter.

&gt; &gt;         But why would she be &quot;feeding&quot; those signs of ageing?
&gt; &gt; Wouldn't she be fighting them, or trying to disguise them, instead?

&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Painting thy outward walls so costlie gay?

&gt; &gt; &gt;Why do you let your mind go hungry, while spending so
&gt; &gt; &gt;much on decorating and renovating your physical self?

&gt; &gt;         Why do you waste away and experience lack
&gt; &gt;         While painting your face at such expense?

&gt; &gt;         &quot;For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
&gt; &gt; and lose his own soul?&quot;  Matthew 16:26

&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Why so large cost hauing so short a lease,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Dost thou vpon thy fading mansion spend?

&gt; &gt; &gt;Why spend so much time and money on your disinteg-
&gt; &gt; &gt;rating body, given that you have possession of it
&gt; &gt; &gt;for so short a time?

&gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Shall wormes inheritors of this excesse
&gt; &gt; &gt; 8. Eate vp thy charge? is this thy bodies end?

&gt; &gt; &gt;I can't do any better than Robert on this: &quot;Are the
&gt; &gt; &gt;worms which will get all this in the end to feed at
&gt; &gt; &gt;your expense? Is that what your body is for?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I certainly like the idea of &quot;end&quot; being about its
&gt; &gt; &gt;purpose as well as its termination.

&gt; &gt;         But it's interesting that he does seem to imply that it is the
&gt; &gt; end of the body, not necessarily of the person.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 9. Then soule liue thou vpon thy seruants losse,
&gt; &gt; &gt;10. And let that pine to aggrauat thy store;

&gt; &gt; &gt;I think that at this point the meaning of 'soul' does
&gt; &gt; &gt;change from the person alone to something which more
&gt; &gt; &gt;addresses the intellectual or spiritual power *within*
&gt; &gt; &gt;that person (see Stonehouse's Law of Changed Meanings).

&gt; &gt;         Is it at all possible that he is using &quot;soule&quot; in the sense of
&gt; &gt; 'sole'?  In which case the line could be meant to be read as: &quot;Then
&gt; &gt; only live thou upon thy servants losse&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt;They should spend more time and effort on developing
&gt; &gt; &gt;this than on saving their looks. 'Spiritual' need not
&gt; &gt; &gt;mean 'religious', of course.

&gt; &gt;         Nor does it mean 'atheism' either.  In any event, it's a
&gt; &gt; confusing two lines.  The meaning may be that the body (presumably
&gt; &gt; referred to by the &quot;servant&quot; and &quot;that&quot;) should be disdained, which
&gt; &gt; will somehow lead to an increase in the addressee's spirit.  Or maybe
&gt; &gt; that isn't the meaning.

&gt; &gt; &gt;11. Buy tearmes diuine in selling houres of drosse:

&gt; &gt; &gt;Shakespeare uses the words &quot;term&quot; or &quot;terms&quot; as nouns
&gt; &gt; &gt;some 85 times, and about two thirds of the time he
&gt; &gt; &gt;means words or expressions, such as in:

&gt; &gt; &gt;   With many holiday and lady terms
&gt; &gt; &gt;   He questioned me;

&gt; &gt; &gt;The other third mainly concern conditions of some
&gt; &gt; &gt;kind:

&gt; &gt; &gt;   'Tis not well
&gt; &gt; &gt;   That you and I should meet upon such terms
&gt; &gt; &gt;   As now we meet.

&gt; &gt; &gt;But just a few are about *limited* spans of time:

&gt; &gt; &gt;   I am thy father's spirit,
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Doomed for a certain term to walk the night,

&gt; &gt; &gt;and I found only one of these in the plural, refer-
&gt; &gt; &gt;ring to the legal year:

&gt; &gt; &gt;   ...the wearing out of six fashions - which is
&gt; &gt; &gt;   four terms, or two actions

&gt; &gt; &gt;Given the comparison with &quot;hours&quot;, I nevertheless
&gt; &gt; &gt;think that it must be lengths of time he is talking
&gt; &gt; &gt;about here. However, I certainly can't see this as
&gt; &gt; &gt;having anything to do with eternity, which is by
&gt; &gt; &gt;definition *unlimited*.

&gt; &gt;         But they certainly seem to be religious in some sense.
&gt; &gt; &quot;[T]erms divine&quot; suggests to me time spent in heaven.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Divine&quot; need not have a religious meaning either.
&gt; &gt; &gt;The OED (5.b) gives &quot;Of things: Of surpassing beauty,
&gt; &gt; &gt;perfection, excellence, etc.; extraordinarily good
&gt; &gt; &gt;or great.&quot; and quotes *Romeo and Juliet*:

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Despised substance of divinest show!

&gt; &gt; &gt;So, &quot;swap the recrementitious hours you waste (in
&gt; &gt; &gt;titivating your body) for times of surpassing beauty
&gt; &gt; &gt;(in developing your mind)&quot; - or

&gt; &gt;&gt; and when death is destroyed, you have no more danger of
&gt; &gt;&gt; dying.

&gt; &gt;And there do seem to be ironically, many words which *might* refer to
&gt; &gt;sex, in this &quot;spritual&quot; sonnet, or so it seems to me: sinful, pine
&gt; &gt;within (wanting buggery?) cost, excess, charge (?) store (a word often
&gt; &gt;repeated in the FY sonnets), hours of dross. But it's the line above
&gt; &gt;that persuades me of it-- Once one is dead, or has triumphed over
&gt; &gt;death, &quot;there's no more dying then.&quot;

&gt; Does this interpretation of particular phrases add up to a
&gt; coherent version of the argument of the poem?

I'm not sure. I haven't tried to do a full paraphrase, and haven't
time to do one at present. But I would say there's certainly a
suggestion there that undercuts the religious imagery.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In the early
&gt; days (1996?) I held out for some time against doing an
&gt; interlinear paraphrase because it seemed to disguise the
&gt; continuity of the overall argument. I am still convinced
&gt; that the first thing to do (not the last thing, and not a
&gt; particularly elevated thing) is to grasp the argument as a
&gt; whole. Following that, we can go on to other things, but
&gt; without it we are merely bombinating in a vacuum.
">

I don't tend to think or work that way when interpreting poetry,
Robert. I start from a certain point and my mind goes out in all
directions ;)

It appears to me that Shakespeare thought in this fashion. He could
write a phrase and see a whole array of meanings to it. So the sonnet
is like a prism, and each turn of the prism (or new line) reveals a
host of different colours.

&gt; On the other hand, it would be hard to write a religious
&gt; poem without referring to sin. Most of these other words are
&gt; very common ones. A lot of common words can be taken in
&gt; special ways - I see I have just written about an 'elevated
&gt; thing', and what could prurient imagination make of that?
&gt; But this sonnet reads to me like a perfectly serious
&gt; discussion of a religious point, coming in a group of unique
&gt; sonnets because Shakespeare has decided to have such a group
&gt; in his book - not just out of nowhere.

&gt; &gt;Remember, &quot;But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
&gt; &gt;Die single and thine image dies with thee.&quot;

&gt; &gt;I argued that the last line meant, &quot;If you only &quot;die single&quot;, i.e.
&gt; &gt;&quot;die&quot; or have orgasms on your own, you'll never be a father.&quot;

&gt; &gt;I would argue here that on at least one level, the poet is saying in
&gt; &gt;this sonnet that once one is dead, there are no more orgasms.

&gt; &gt;Very interesting sonnet. The sexual imagery, which I at least think
&gt; &gt;may be there, is antithetical to the spiritual imagery, which is
&gt; &gt;certainly there. If Paul's going to say it's about feces, which I
&gt; &gt;think I see coming, ;) I don't agree.

&gt; &gt;L.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Here we have another unique sonnet. It looks as if
&gt; &gt;&gt; Shakespeare thought this was a good place in the book to
&gt; &gt;&gt; display his versatility. Alas, someone in the copying
&gt; &gt;&gt; process allowed in a careless blunder. The repetition of 'my
&gt; &gt;&gt; sinful earth' at the beginning of line 2 is unShakespearian
&gt; &gt;&gt; (he does  not repeat himself), it conveys no meaning and it
&gt; &gt;&gt; gives us four syllables where we need two. No doubt there
&gt; &gt;&gt; will be someone to defend it!

&gt; &gt;&gt; The emendation 'feeding' is attributed by Burrow to
&gt; &gt;&gt; 'Sebastian Evans in Cambridge 1893', an edition of the Works
&gt; &gt;&gt; edited by W.A. Wright. It is powerfully supported by Helen
&gt; &gt;&gt; Vendler , who among much else refers to a comment by Walton
&gt; &gt;&gt; Litz that lines 1-2 generate line 9, lines 3-4 generate line
&gt; &gt;&gt; 10, lines 5-6 generate line 11 and lines 7-8 generate line
&gt; &gt;&gt; 12. The idea of feeding, and the word itself, pervade the
&gt; &gt;&gt; poem.

&gt; &gt;&gt; There is no difficulty in saying the transmitted text is
&gt; &gt;&gt; wrong, but with this kind of error, which obliterates all
&gt; &gt;&gt; trace of the original words, there can be no claim of
&gt; &gt;&gt; certainty for any emendation. Still, the case looks good to
&gt; &gt;&gt; me.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The fallen angels in line 2 would fit into Paradise Lost,
&gt; &gt;&gt; but the story is far older than Milton.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The advice in lines 9-12 seems very abstract and
&gt; &gt;&gt; metaphorical. I am not clear what is being prescribed.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Fasting and prayer? Giving to the poor?

"Fading mansion" = New Place?  Ridiculous.  It equals the speaker's

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; For once we have a poem that might lend itself to Michael
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Martin's approach.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (And a question for Peter if he happens to be reading:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn't this poem contradict the supposed atheism of 125?)

&gt;&gt; &gt;Not necessarily. In fact I would suggest that the atheism
&gt;&gt; &gt;indicated by 125 - being far more strongly supported by
&gt;&gt; &gt;religious references than this one is - means that we need
&gt;&gt; &gt;to question whether the almost universal assumption that
&gt;&gt; &gt;this is a 'Christian' sonnet is actually correct.

&gt;&gt; &gt;You say that this doesn't seem to have anything to do with
&gt;&gt; &gt;the Dark Lady, but why not? No fewer than 17 of the 25
&gt;&gt; &gt;surrounding sonnets are apparently addressed to her, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;the other 8 (with the possible exceptions of 129 &amp; 145)
&gt;&gt; &gt;almost certainly about her. At least the first two quat-
&gt;&gt; &gt;rains of this one could just as easily have been addressed
&gt;&gt; &gt;to her.

&gt;&gt; &gt; 1. Poore soule the center of my sinfull earth,

&gt;&gt; &gt;'Poor soul' as a form of address is used throughout the
&gt;&gt; &gt;canon in reference to a *person* (or in one case a lamb)
&gt;&gt; &gt;who for some reason is to be pitied.

&gt;&gt; &gt;   Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee.
&gt;&gt; &gt;   (Simpcox)

&gt;&gt; &gt;   Go, go, poor soul. I envy not thy glory.
&gt;&gt; &gt;   (Lady Anne)

&gt;&gt; &gt;   Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
&gt;&gt; &gt;   (Juliet)

&gt;&gt; &gt;   Alack, poor soul, thou hast need of more rags to
&gt;&gt; &gt;   lay on thee rather than have these off.
&gt;&gt; &gt;   (Autolycus)

&gt;&gt; &gt;It is also worth noting that only a few sonnets earlier
&gt;&gt; &gt;he had been writing about her in terms of his 'sin', so
&gt;&gt; &gt;he might well describe her as the centre of his 'sinful
&gt;&gt; &gt;earth':

&gt;&gt; &gt;   Only my plague thus far I count my gain:
&gt;&gt; &gt;   That she that makes me sin awards me pain.
&gt;&gt; &gt;   (141)

&gt;&gt; &gt;   Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
&gt;&gt; &gt;   Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving.
&gt;&gt; &gt;   (142)

&gt;&gt; &gt;Grounded?

&gt;&gt;         Lynne earlier pointed out that &quot;soul&quot; might be a reference to
&gt;&gt; another person rather than the speaker's inner spirit.  Which is
&gt;&gt; something that simply had not occurred to me.  But congrats to both of
&gt;&gt; you for noting it.  Neither KDJ or Kerrigan seem to consider the
&gt;&gt; possibility.  Booth considers it, but seems to reject it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;It may also relate to Sonnet 144's idea of the &quot;female
&gt;&gt; &gt;evil&quot;, suggesting perhaps that the &quot;better angel&quot; is the
&gt;&gt; &gt;centre of his purer world.

&gt;&gt;         But one of the characteristics of the FYM, the &quot;better angel&quot;,
&gt;&gt; is that he is naturally beautiful - &quot;A woman's face with nature's own
&gt;&gt; hand painted&quot;.  So when the speaker says the addressee is &quot;painting&quot;
&gt;&gt; his/her &quot;walls so costly gay&quot;, it seems to me to be more likely that
&gt;&gt; he is speaking to the DL (if he is, in fact, speaking to one of the
&gt;&gt; two of them).

&gt;Those are outer walls, of course, and I took the line to mean costume
&gt;and jewels, as they would be &quot;costly,&quot; although it could possibly mean
&gt;face paint.
">

It's possible that it's a reference to costume and jewels
and/or cosmetics.  But he does mention that worms will be the
"inheritors of this excess".  Since worms eat the body, I assume it is
the physical body that is being discussed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Again, this could be &quot;turning&quot; the imagery used in the
&gt;earlier FY sonnets, because the FY is aging.

Maybe.  But the speaker describes himself as "sinful earth".
In 142, he says that love (of the dark lady) is his sin.  Again, IF he
is talking to either the FYM or DL, I suspect it is the DL.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I think we'd have to look at this sonnet very carefully to decide

I think we went through this when we first discussed the sonnet. I
believe without checking that I said I thought it meant the sun, could
also be about the rise and fall of a court favourite, could also be
read entirely for bawdy--a recreation of the sex act, the star being a
man with syphilis. Someone--perhaps you--challenged me, and I met the
challenge. It would likewise be easy to show how the whole of 146 can
be read as referring to another person. I can't say for sure that the
model for 7 was a particular person, but it has the earmarks of it.
Mayhap Leicester?

If Shakespeare of Stratford is the author, I imagine it's about the
death of Hamnet. If Oxford is the author, he lost an infant son in
1583, and I believe his son by Vavasour (1581) would have been "taken
from him" and raised elsewhere. I'm not PT, if that's what you're
hinting at.

This sonnet is an attack on Raleigh and is
largely 'addressed' to him.  The poet leaves
hints that another addressee is the Queen
herself, in that while all of what he says is
meant for Raleigh, much of it also fits her.
She was meant to read it, thinking she was
intended, but eventually working out its
real target was Raleigh.

The superficial religious theme of the 'body /
soul' opposition is maintained -- but without
IMHO a great deal of interest.

1.   Poore soule the center of my sinfull earth,

Oxford's tone is mockingly pitying. It is a
sarcastic comment upon Raleigh's poetic
style (and probably also on his spoken
manner) with his endless moans about the
state of the world and the corruption of the
court while, in reality, Raleigh was raking in
huge sums.

The 'soul' in these sonnets is usually Raleigh,
as in 'the prophetic soul of the wide world' of
Sonnet 107.  He liked to discuss the concept
of 'the soul', getting into some minor legal
trouble for it in 1594 with a couple of zealous,
if obtuse, clergymen.  He sought to save the
Queen's sole with his cloak in that famous
escapade.  Her first gift of leases to him played
on the conceit, being the property of All Souls
College in Oxford.

2.   My sinfull earth these rebbell powres that thee array,
2.   [Fucked by] these rebbell powres that thee array,

The duplication of 'my sinfull earth' in the
Quarto is so conspicuous and so egregious
a 'mistake' that it can only be deliberate.  In
the form as printed, it causes the line to be
much longer than all others on the page.
See:

http://extra.shu.ac.uk/emls/Sonnets/i3r.jpg

An error of that size could never get past a
remotely competent printer or proof-reader.
We have seen several 'mistakes' of this sort
in the Sonnets before -- such as when the
poet intends to convey 'shite', he gives us a
false rhyme;  in Sonnet 25: 'quite' to 'worth',
and in Sonnet 144: 'sight' to 'pride'.

We still have to guess exactly what the poet
intended;  I first thought the missing syllables
were 'Fucking' -- partly as the common expletive,
and partly because it seems to tie in well with
" . . the center of 'my sinfull earth '.   However,
Peter Farey suggests 'Fucked by', which
provides a much better meter.

'Those rebbell powres' were primarily the Irish
in Munster, against whom Raleigh fought in
1579-80, with some success, but who still
dominated much of Munster and continued
to cause trouble to his extensive estates.

3.   Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth

Raleigh had to extensively refurbish Durham
House to make it habitable, and to provide
Hariot with his observatory under the roof.
In doing all this he was 'pining within'.

'Dearth' is etymologically related to 'dear' and
was used in its older sense by Shake-speare.
Here he plays on both senses. All could see
the vast sums Raleigh was pouring into
Durham House (and into his other enterprises),
yet he was forever complaining of shortage of
funds.

'Dearth' (OED)
2. Dearness, costliness, high price. Obsolete.
1596 Bp. Barlow Three Serm. i. 5 Dearth is that, when all those things which belong
to the life of man . . . are rated at a high price.]
1632 in Cramond Ann. Banff (1891) I. 67 Compleining of . . . the dearthe of the pryce
thairof.
1644 R. Baillie Lett. &amp; Jrnls. (1841) II. 175, I cannot help the extraordinarie dearth:
they say the great soume the author putts on his copie, is the cause of it.
1602 Shakes. Ham. v. ii. 123 His infusion of such dearth and rareness.

4.   Painting thy outward walls so costlie gay?

The huge riverside walls of Durham House
would have been repainted.  Our poet finds the
colour garish. Of course, he is also referring to
Raleigh's dress.

5.   Why so large cost hauing so short a lease,

Raleigh was merely allowed by the Queen to
reside at Durham House.  There was no 'lease'
and our poet is being sarcastic.  He is saying
that Raleigh's time as favourite will be very
short.

6.   Dost thou vpon thy fading mansion spend?

There is undoubtedly a play on 'fading man
scion'; ('sion' was a common spelling at the
time;  the same wordplay occurs in Sonnet 95
in a similar context),   This would seem to
indicate 1581 as the date of composition.

Durham House was exceedingly dilapidated,
and Raleigh's refurbishments could not rectify
its huge structural problems.

'Fading' is also being used in a sense employed
about Autocylus (a caricature of Raleigh) in
*Winters Tale*.

'Fading' (OED)
The name of a dance, app. Irish. 'With a fading' was the refrain of a popular
song of an indecent character.
1611 Beaum. &amp; Fl. Knt. Burning Pestle iii. v, I will have him dance Fading;
Fading is a fine jig.
1611 Shakes. Wint. T. iv. iv. 195 He has the prettiest Loue-songs . . . with
such delicate burthens of Dildo's and Fadings.

7.   Shall wormes inheritors of this excesse,

Our poet identifies the lower-classes as 'worms'.
Also, it seems, he intends Puritans -- no doubt
partly from an allusion to the Diet of Worms.
He says that they will soon acquire all this
wealth and these fine palaces -- insofar as
anything will be left after the civil war over the
succession.

8.   Eate vp thy charge? is this thy bodies end?

Raleigh was made 'Esquire of  the Body Extra-
ordinary' in 1581 -- a lowly rank which did not
reflect the extent of the Queen's favour.  His
'charge' was the person of the Queen.  The
'worms' (of all sorts) will destroy everything
of value, since she has made no provision for
continuity.  'Thy body' in this context is that
of the Queen.

The tone sounds as though the poet hopes
for the marriage of the Queen, but other factors,
such as Raleigh's accumulation of wealth, seem
to date the sonnet to 1583-4.  It's quite possible
that the later date apples and our poet is merely
continuing to speak in his Cassandra voice saying
"I was right . . . I told you so" lamenting the end
of the Tudor dynasty and foretelling catastrophe.

9.   Then soule liue thou vpon thy seruants losse,

There are several recorded incidents that fit
this line.  The most obvious date from 1583-4,
but there could have been earlier ones.

" . . In the case of Walter Ralegh's grant of wines, he sub-contracted
to one Richard Browne, who guaranteed him for seven years an annual
income of آ£700 - a sum that should be multiplied by one hundred to
give some indication of its value in modern currency. The trouble was
that Browne proved too industrious, enforcing his right to license
vintners so zealously that he caused great offence - notably in
Cambridge where the vice-chancellor jailed Browne's bailiff. On top of
that Browne made for himself profits as substantial, if not greater, than
the آ£700 he was giving Ralegh every year, and when Walter asked for
some share of these profits, he was told - as he would have told Browne
had the lease proved unremunerative - that a bargain was a bargain.
So the courtier went back to the source of his fortune and asked the
queen to call in his licence and re-grant it to him so that he could
negotiate fresh terms - which Elizabeth did.  Poor Browne was sacked.
With the queen on his side an Elizabethan could not lose, and although
one of Walter's justifications for getting his wine lease renewed had
been that Browne's exactions had been harsh and unjust, Walter now
set to work with the very same rigour his former agent had employed,
doubling his effective income from the monopoly.
Still, the robbery was not all one way. On 26 April 1583, there appeared
in the law courts of Middlesex one 'Hugh Pewe, gentleman' who was tried
for stealing 'a jewel worth آ£80, a hatband of pearls worth آ£30, and five
yards of silk, called damask, worth آ£3' the property of Walter Ralegh. . . "
(Lacey, *Raleigh*, page 52)

10.   And let that pine to aggrauat thy store;

In the famous story the Queen asked:
"When will you ever cease begging, Walter?"
to get the reply "When your majesty ceases
to be so kind a benefactress".   It has the ring
of truth.  In any case, there is no doubt that
Walter begged, and that his 'pining' was most
effective in increasing his wealth.

However, the poet was also referring to the
pine extracted from the woodlands on Raleigh's
estates in Ireland, and to the name of his
principal agent in this matter:  Henry Pine.

" . . . He had also set up with an Englishman named Henry Pyne a flourishing
export trade in timber -- mainly timber from Walter's own woods around the
Blackwater River. Ralegh's royal favour had secured a special licence for this
trade so that Pyne could sell to any foreign customers he could find without
taking account of the normal export restrictions - and some most eager customers
were the Spanish. In three years Pyne succeeded in exporting to the Spanish
islands of the Canaries and Madeira - very poorly provided with timber -- no less
than 340,000 barrel staves for making wine casks.
The objection to this commerce, that England was throughout these years
engaged in the most bitter war with Spain, held less weight in the sixteenth
century than it would today. Many English merchants imported from Spain sherry,
Madeira and other sweet wines - in hogsheads doubtless made of Ralegh's

Robert's question was directed at Lynne
and he expects the answer 'No' -- which
is fair enough considering the haphazard
and vague nature of her suggestions.

However, he is implicitly setting it against
his own account, which MIGHT be said
to provide a 'coherent version of the
argument'.  But it has huge deficiencies,
the most obvious being that it is banal in
the extreme.  Robert implicitly (if not
explicitly) rejects any taint of ambiguity.
For a start, its presence would obscure
and impede his 'coherent version'.
He could be said to represent an ancient
tradition of 'Sonnet interpretation', which
is still, in effect, the dominant model.
The pupil asks of a poem "What does it
mean?" and the teacher explains in one
simple theme.

However, the more intelligent of modern
commentators no longer expect to provide
simple answers to simple questions, and
vague as Lynne's ideas are, she is at least
working along the right lines.  Any remotely
satisfactory answer _must_ be complicated.

&gt; 13.     So shalt thou feed on death, that feeds on men,
&gt; 14.     And death once dead, ther's no more dying then.

&gt; This sonnet is an attack on Raleigh and is
&gt; largely 'addressed' to him.  The poet leaves
&gt; hints that another addressee is the Queen
&gt; herself, in that while all of what he says is
&gt; meant for Raleigh, much of it also fits her.
&gt; She was meant to read it, thinking she was
&gt; intended, but eventually working out its
&gt; real target was Raleigh.

&gt; The superficial religious theme of the 'body /
&gt; soul' opposition is maintained -- but without
&gt; IMHO a great deal of interest.

&gt; 1.   Poore soule the center of my sinfull earth,

&gt; Oxford's tone is mockingly pitying. It is a
&gt; sarcastic comment upon Raleigh's poetic
&gt; style (and probably also on his spoken
&gt; manner) with his endless moans about the
&gt; state of the world and the corruption of the
&gt; court while, in reality, Raleigh was raking in
&gt; huge sums.

&gt; The 'soul' in these sonnets is usually Raleigh,
&gt; as in 'the prophetic soul of the wide world' of
&gt; Sonnet 107.  He liked to discuss the concept
&gt; of 'the soul', getting into some minor legal
&gt; trouble for it in 1594 with a couple of zealous,
&gt; if obtuse, clergymen.  He sought to save the
&gt; Queen's sole with his cloak in that famous
&gt; escapade.  Her first gift of leases to him played
&gt; on the conceit, being the property of All Souls
&gt; College in Oxford.

&gt; 2.   My sinfull earth these rebbell powres that thee array,
&gt; 2.   [Fucked by] these rebbell powres that thee array,

&gt; The duplication of 'my sinfull earth' in the
&gt; Quarto is so conspicuous and so egregious
&gt; a 'mistake' that it can only be deliberate.  In
&gt; the form as printed, it causes the line to be
&gt; much longer than all others on the page.
&gt; See:

&gt; http://extra.shu.ac.uk/emls/Sonnets/i3r.jpg

&gt; An error of that size could never get past a
&gt; remotely competent printer or proof-reader.
&gt; We have seen several 'mistakes' of this sort
&gt; in the Sonnets before -- such as when the
&gt; poet intends to convey 'shite', he gives us a
&gt; false rhyme;  in Sonnet 25: 'quite' to 'worth',
&gt; and in Sonnet 144: 'sight' to 'pride'.

&gt; We still have to guess exactly what the poet
&gt; intended;  I first thought the missing syllables
&gt; were 'Fucking' -- partly as the common expletive,
&gt; and partly because it seems to tie in well with
&gt; &quot; . . the center of 'my sinfull earth '.   However,
&gt; Peter Farey suggests 'Fucked by', which
&gt; provides a much better meter.

&gt; 'Those rebbell powres' were primarily the Irish
&gt; in Munster, against whom Raleigh fought in
&gt; 1579-80, with some success, but who still
&gt; dominated much of Munster and continued
&gt; to cause trouble to his extensive estates.

&gt; 3.   Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth

&gt; Raleigh had to extensively refurbish Durham
&gt; House to make it habitable, and to provide
&gt; Hariot with his observatory under the roof.
&gt; In doing all this he was 'pining within'.

&gt; 'Dearth' is etymologically related to 'dear' and
&gt; was used in its older sense by Shake-speare.
&gt; Here he plays on both senses. All could see
&gt; the vast sums Raleigh was pouring into
&gt; Durham House (and into his other enterprises),
&gt; yet he was forever complaining of shortage of
&gt; funds.

&gt; 'Dearth' (OED)
&gt;    2. Dearness, costliness, high price. Obsolete.

rareness.

&gt; 4.   Painting thy outward walls so costlie gay?

&gt; The huge riverside walls of Durham House
&gt; would have been repainted.  Our poet finds the
&gt; colour garish. Of course, he is also referring to
&gt; Raleigh's dress.

&gt; 5.   Why so large cost hauing so short a lease,

&gt; Raleigh was merely allowed by the Queen to
&gt; reside at Durham House.  There was no 'lease'
&gt; and our poet is being sarcastic.  He is saying
&gt; that Raleigh's time as favourite will be very
&gt; short.

&gt; 6.   Dost thou vpon thy fading mansion spend?

&gt; There is undoubtedly a play on 'fading man
&gt; scion'; ('sion' was a common spelling at the
&gt; time;  the same wordplay occurs in Sonnet 95
&gt; in a similar context),   This would seem to
&gt; indicate 1581 as the date of composition.

&gt; Durham House was exceedingly dilapidated,
&gt; and Raleigh's refurbishments could not rectify
&gt; its huge structural problems.

&gt; 'Fading' is also being used in a sense employed
&gt; about Autocylus (a caricature of Raleigh) in
&gt; *Winters Tale*.

&gt; 'Fading' (OED)
&gt;        The name of a dance, app. Irish. 'With a fading' was the refrain of
a popular
&gt;         song of an indecent character.

. . . with
&gt;                 such delicate burthens of Dildo's and Fadings.

&gt; 7.   Shall wormes inheritors of this excesse,

&gt; Our poet identifies the lower-classes as 'worms'.
&gt; Also, it seems, he intends Puritans -- no doubt
&gt; partly from an allusion to the Diet of Worms.
&gt; He says that they will soon acquire all this
&gt; wealth and these fine palaces -- insofar as
&gt; anything will be left after the civil war over the
&gt; succession.

&gt; 8.   Eate vp thy charge? is this thy bodies end?

&gt; Raleigh was made 'Esquire of  the Body Extra-
&gt; ordinary' in 1581 -- a lowly rank which did not
&gt; reflect the extent of the Queen's favour.  His
&gt; 'charge' was the person of the Queen.  The
&gt; 'worms' (of all sorts) will destroy everything
&gt; of value, since she has made no provision for
&gt; continuity.  'Thy body' in this context is that
&gt; of the Queen.

&gt; The tone sounds as though the poet hopes
&gt; for the marriage of the Queen, but other factors,
&gt; such as Raleigh's accumulation of wealth, seem
&gt; to date the sonnet to 1583-4.  It's quite possible
&gt; that the later date apples and our poet is merely
&gt; continuing to speak in his Cassandra voice saying
&gt; &quot;I was right . . . I told you so&quot; lamenting the end
&gt; of the Tudor dynasty and foretelling catastrophe.

&gt; 9.   Then soule liue thou vpon thy seruants losse,

&gt; There are several recorded incidents that fit
&gt; this line.  The most obvious date from 1583-4,
&gt; but there could have been earlier ones.

&gt; &quot; . . In the case of Walter Ralegh's grant of wines, he sub-contracted
&gt; to one Richard Browne, who guaranteed him for seven years an annual
&gt; income of آ£700 - a sum that should be multiplied by one hundred to
&gt; give some indication of its value in modern currency. The trouble was
&gt; that Browne proved too industrious, enforcing his right to license
&gt; vintners so zealously that he caused great offence - notably in
&gt; Cambridge where the vice-chancellor jailed Browne's bailiff. On top of
&gt; that Browne made for himself profits as substantial, if not greater, than
&gt; the آ£700 he was giving Ralegh every year, and when Walter asked for
&gt; some share of these profits, he was told - as he would have told Browne
&gt; had the lease proved unremunerative - that a bargain was a bargain.
&gt; So the courtier went back to the source of his fortune and asked the
&gt; queen to call in his licence and re-grant it to him so that he could
&gt; negotiate fresh terms - which Elizabeth did.  Poor Browne was sacked.
&gt; With the queen on his side an Elizabethan could not lose, and although
&gt; one of Walter's justifications for getting his wine lease renewed had
&gt; been that Browne's exactions had been harsh and unjust, Walter now
&gt; set to work with the very same rigour his former agent had employed,
&gt; doubling his effective income from the monopoly.
&gt;     Still, the robbery was not all one way. On 26 April 1583, there
appeared
&gt; in the law courts of Middlesex one 'Hugh Pewe, gentleman' who was tried
&gt; for stealing 'a jewel worth آ£80, a hatband of pearls worth آ£30, and five
&gt; yards of silk, called damask, worth آ£3' the property of Walter Ralegh. . .
&quot;
&gt; (Lacey, *Raleigh*, page 52)

&gt; 10.   And let that pine to aggrauat thy store;

&gt; In the famous story the Queen asked:
&gt; &quot;When will you ever cease begging, Walter?&quot;
&gt; to get the reply &quot;When your majesty ceases
&gt; to be so kind a benefactress&quot;.   It has the ring
&gt; of truth.  In any case, there is no doubt that
&gt; Walter begged, and that his 'pining' was most
&gt; effective in increasing his wealth.

&gt; However, the poet was also referring to the
&gt; pine extracted from the woodlands on Raleigh's
&gt; estates in Ireland, and to the name of his
&gt; principal agent in this matter:  Henry Pine.

&gt; &gt; &gt; For once we have a poem that might lend itself to Michael
&gt; &gt; &gt; Martin's approach.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (And a question for Peter if he happens to be reading:
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't this poem contradict the supposed atheism of 125?)

&gt; &gt; Not necessarily. In fact I would suggest that the atheism
&gt; &gt; indicated by 125 - being far more strongly supported by
&gt; &gt; religious references than this one is - means that we need
&gt; &gt; to question whether the almost universal assumption that
&gt; &gt; this is a 'Christian' sonnet is actually correct.

&gt; &gt; You say that this doesn't seem to have anything to do with
&gt; &gt; the Dark Lady, but why not? No fewer than 17 of the 25
&gt; &gt; surrounding sonnets are apparently addressed to her, and
&gt; &gt; the other 8 (with the possible exceptions of 129 &amp; 145)
&gt; &gt; almost certainly about her. At least the first two quat-
&gt; &gt; rains of this one could just as easily have been addressed
&gt; &gt; to her.

&gt; &gt;  1. Poore soule the center of my sinfull earth,

&gt; &gt; 'Poor soul' as a form of address is used throughout the
&gt; &gt; canon in reference to a *person* (or in one case a lamb)
&gt; &gt; who for some reason is to be pitied.

&gt; &gt;    Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee.
&gt; &gt;    (Simpcox)

&gt; &gt;    Go, go, poor soul. I envy not thy glory.
&gt; &gt;    (Lady Anne)

&gt; &gt;    Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
&gt; &gt;    (Juliet)

&gt; &gt;    Alack, poor soul, thou hast need of more rags to
&gt; &gt;    lay on thee rather than have these off.
&gt; &gt;    (Autolycus)

&gt; &gt; It is also worth noting that only a few sonnets earlier
&gt; &gt; he had been writing about her in terms of his 'sin', so
&gt; &gt; he might well describe her as the centre of his 'sinful
&gt; &gt; earth':

&gt; &gt;    Only my plague thus far I count my gain:
&gt; &gt;    That she that makes me sin awards me pain.
&gt; &gt;    (141)

&gt; &gt;    Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
&gt; &gt;    Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving.
&gt; &gt;    (142)

&gt; &gt; Grounded?

I should perhaps have made it a little clearer that this
was pointing out a possible link with "earth".

I had been reading the Sonnets for years before I ever saw
an edition with 'explanatory notes'. Before I read what the
'experts' said it never occurred to me for a moment that it
was not one of the Dark Lady series and addressed to her.

Gerard Ledger does suggest it as a possibility in his on-
line comments, but clearly prefers the 'Christian' meaning.

&gt; &gt; It may also relate to Sonnet 144's idea of the &quot;female
&gt; &gt; evil&quot;, suggesting perhaps that the &quot;better angel&quot; is the
&gt; &gt; centre of his purer world.

&gt; But one of the characteristics of the FYM, the &quot;better angel&quot;,
&gt; is that he is naturally beautiful - &quot;A woman's face with
&gt; nature's own hand painted&quot;.  So when the speaker says the
&gt; addressee is &quot;painting&quot; his/her &quot;walls so costly gay&quot;, it
&gt; seems to me to be more likely that he is speaking to the
&gt; DL (if he is, in fact, speaking to one of the two of them).

&gt; &gt; A central theme of the whole
&gt; &gt; Sonnet is dying, of course, so we should perhaps also
&gt; &gt; note the phrase &quot;thys synneful worlde&quot; in the 1559
&gt; &gt; Burial Service.

&gt; &gt;  2. (...) these rebbell powres that thee array,

&gt; &gt; Robert's 'feeding' is as good a guess as any. When we
&gt; &gt; discussed this on SHAKSPER recently, I suggested
&gt; &gt; &quot;sieged by&quot;, but I now think that &quot;feeding&quot; is more
&gt; &gt; likely. My amendment of Paul's idea to &quot;****ed by&quot; is
&gt; &gt; quite appealing though!

&gt; Which also supports the idea of the DL's promiscuity!

&gt; &gt; The &quot;rebbell powres&quot; that &quot;array&quot; her I would take
&gt; &gt; mainly to be the physical signs of ageing which are
&gt; &gt; afflicting or even disfiguring her. The OED actually
&gt; &gt; quotes &quot;Indeed age hath arrayed thee!&quot; as an example
&gt; &gt; of the latter.

&gt; But why would she be &quot;feeding&quot; those signs of ageing?
&gt; Wouldn't she be fighting them, or trying to disguise
&gt; them, instead?
">

Well spotted. Yes, perhaps my "sieged by" would be better
after all. The idea of painting the walls while they are
simultaneously being attacked does nicely fit the idea of
trying to hide the signs of ageing.

I think that it is more than just the face he is talking

Good point. No thought of any "generall resurrection

Whoah! Let's remember just what I am arguing here. You
asked whether this poem contradicts the supposed atheism
of 125. I am saying that it doesn't *necessarily* do so.
I don't believe that the Sonnet itself gives us enough
clues to be sure either way, so it is only my certainty
about the meaning of 125 that sways me in that direction.

All I am pointing out is that the word 'soul' was used
in non-religious contexts too.

I'm not sure that I would go as far as 'disdained', but

&gt; &gt; 11. Buy tearmes diuine in selling houres of drosse:

&gt; &gt; Shakespeare uses the words &quot;term&quot; or &quot;terms&quot; as nouns
&gt; &gt; ome 85 times, and about two thirds of the time he
&gt; &gt; means words or expressions, such as in:

It's an oxymoron (as Booth actually admits, without any

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and when death is destroyed, you have no more danger of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; dying.

&gt; &gt; &gt;And there do seem to be ironically, many words which *might* refer to
&gt; &gt; &gt;sex, in this &quot;spritual&quot; sonnet, or so it seems to me: sinful, pine
&gt; &gt; &gt;within (wanting buggery?) cost, excess, charge (?) store (a word often
&gt; &gt; &gt;repeated in the FY sonnets), hours of dross. But it's the line above
&gt; &gt; &gt;that persuades me of it-- Once one is dead, or has triumphed over
&gt; &gt; &gt;death, &quot;there's no more dying then.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Does this interpretation of particular phrases add up to a
&gt; &gt; coherent version of the argument of the poem?

&gt; I'm not sure. I haven't tried to do a full paraphrase, and haven't
&gt; time to do one at present. But I would say there's certainly a
&gt; suggestion there that undercuts the religious imagery.

&gt; &gt;In the early
&gt; &gt; days (1996?) I held out for some time against doing an
&gt; &gt; interlinear paraphrase because it seemed to disguise the
&gt; &gt; continuity of the overall argument. I am still convinced
&gt; &gt; that the first thing to do (not the last thing, and not a
&gt; &gt; particularly elevated thing) is to grasp the argument as a
&gt; &gt; whole. Following that, we can go on to other things, but
&gt; &gt; without it we are merely bombinating in a vacuum.

&gt; I don't tend to think or work that way when interpreting poetry,
&gt; Robert. I start from a certain point and my mind goes out in all
&gt; directions ;)

&gt; It appears to me that Shakespeare thought in this fashion. He could
&gt; write a phrase and see a whole array of meanings to it.

&gt; Regards,
&gt; Synesthetic Mouse

&gt; &gt; On the other hand, it would be hard to write a religious
&gt; &gt; poem without referring to sin. Most of these other words are
&gt; &gt; very common ones. A lot of common words can be taken in
&gt; &gt; special ways - I see I have just written about an 'elevated
&gt; &gt; thing', and what could prurient imagination make of that?
&gt; &gt; But this sonnet reads to me like a perfectly serious
&gt; &gt; discussion of a religious point, coming in a group of unique
&gt; &gt; sonnets because Shakespeare has decided to have such a group
&gt; &gt; in his book - not just out of nowhere.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Remember, &quot;But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
&gt; &gt; &gt;Die single and thine image dies with thee.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt;I argued that the last line meant, &quot;If you only &quot;die single&quot;, i.e.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;die&quot; or have orgasms on your own, you'll never be a father.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt;I would argue here that on at least one level, the poet is saying in
&gt; &gt; &gt;this sonnet that once one is dead, there are no more orgasms.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Very interesting sonnet. The sexual imagery, which I at least think
&gt; &gt; &gt;may be there, is antithetical to the spiritual imagery, which is
&gt; &gt; &gt;certainly there. If Paul's going to say it's about feces, which I
&gt; &gt; &gt;think I see coming, ;) I don't agree.

&gt; &gt; &gt;L.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here we have another unique sonnet. It looks as if
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Shakespeare thought this was a good place in the book to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; display his versatility. Alas, someone in the copying
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; process allowed in a careless blunder. The repetition of 'my
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sinful earth' at the beginning of line 2 is unShakespearian
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (he does  not repeat himself), it conveys no meaning and it
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; gives us four syllables where we need two. No doubt there
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; will be someone to defend it!

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The emendation 'feeding' is attributed by Burrow to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 'Sebastian Evans in Cambridge 1893', an edition of the Works
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; edited by W.A. Wright. It is powerfully supported by Helen
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Vendler , who among much else refers to a comment by Walton
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Litz that lines 1-2 generate line 9, lines 3-4 generate line
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 10, lines 5-6 generate line 11 and lines 7-8 generate line
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 12. The idea of feeding, and the word itself, pervade the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; poem.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; There is no difficulty in saying the transmitted text is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wrong, but with this kind of error, which obliterates all
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; trace of the original words, there can be no claim of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; certainty for any emendation. Still, the case looks good to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; me.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The fallen angels in line 2 would fit into Paradise Lost,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; but the story is far older than Milton.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The advice in lines 9-12 seems very abstract and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; metaphorical. I am not clear what is being prescribed.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Fasting and prayer? Giving to the poor?

&gt; &gt; 14.     And death once dead, ther's no more dying then.

&gt; &gt; This sonnet is an attack on Raleigh and is
&gt; &gt; largely 'addressed' to him.  The poet leaves
&gt; &gt; hints that another addressee is the Queen
&gt; &gt; herself, in that while all of what he says is
&gt; &gt; meant for Raleigh, much of it also fits her.
&gt; &gt; She was meant to read it, thinking she was
&gt; &gt; intended, but eventually working out its
&gt; &gt; real target was Raleigh.

&gt; &gt; The superficial religious theme of the 'body /
&gt; &gt; soul' opposition is maintained -- but without
&gt; &gt; IMHO a great deal of interest.

&gt; &gt; 1.   Poore soule the center of my sinfull earth,

&gt; &gt; Oxford's tone is mockingly pitying. It is a
&gt; &gt; sarcastic comment upon Raleigh's poetic
&gt; &gt; style (and probably also on his spoken
&gt; &gt; manner) with his endless moans about the
&gt; &gt; state of the world and the corruption of the
&gt; &gt; court while, in reality, Raleigh was raking in
&gt; &gt; huge sums.

&gt; &gt; The 'soul' in these sonnets is usually Raleigh,
&gt; &gt; as in 'the prophetic soul of the wide world' of
&gt; &gt; Sonnet 107.  He liked to discuss the concept
&gt; &gt; of 'the soul', getting into some minor legal
&gt; &gt; trouble for it in 1594 with a couple of zealous,
&gt; &gt; if obtuse, clergymen.  He sought to save the
&gt; &gt; Queen's sole with his cloak in that famous
&gt; &gt; escapade.  Her first gift of leases to him played
&gt; &gt; on the conceit, being the property of All Souls
&gt; &gt; College in Oxford.

&gt; &gt; 2.   My sinfull earth these rebbell powres that thee array,
&gt; &gt; 2.   [Fucked by] these rebbell powres that thee array,

&gt; &gt; The duplication of 'my sinfull earth' in the
&gt; &gt; Quarto is so conspicuous and so egregious
&gt; &gt; a 'mistake' that it can only be deliberate.  In
&gt; &gt; the form as printed, it causes the line to be
&gt; &gt; much longer than all others on the page.
&gt; &gt; See:

&gt; &gt; http://extra.shu.ac.uk/emls/Sonnets/i3r.jpg

&gt; &gt; An error of that size could never get past a
&gt; &gt; remotely competent printer or proof-reader.
&gt; &gt; We have seen several 'mistakes' of this sort
&gt; &gt; in the Sonnets before -- such as when the
&gt; &gt; poet intends to convey 'shite', he gives us a
&gt; &gt; false rhyme;  in Sonnet 25: 'quite' to 'worth',
&gt; &gt; and in Sonnet 144: 'sight' to 'pride'.

&gt; &gt; We still have to guess exactly what the poet
&gt; &gt; intended;  I first thought the missing syllables
&gt; &gt; were 'Fucking' -- partly as the common expletive,
&gt; &gt; and partly because it seems to tie in well with
&gt; &gt; &quot; . . the center of 'my sinfull earth '.   However,
&gt; &gt; Peter Farey suggests 'Fucked by', which
&gt; &gt; provides a much better meter.

&gt; &gt; 'Those rebbell powres' were primarily the Irish
&gt; &gt; in Munster, against whom Raleigh fought in
&gt; &gt; 1579-80, with some success, but who still
&gt; &gt; dominated much of Munster and continued
&gt; &gt; to cause trouble to his extensive estates.

&gt; &gt; 3.   Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth

&gt; &gt; Raleigh had to extensively refurbish Durham
&gt; &gt; House to make it habitable, and to provide
&gt; &gt; Hariot with his observatory under the roof.
&gt; &gt; In doing all this he was 'pining within'.

&gt; &gt; 'Dearth' is etymologically related to 'dear' and
&gt; &gt; was used in its older sense by Shake-speare.
&gt; &gt; Here he plays on both senses. All could see
&gt; &gt; the vast sums Raleigh was pouring into
&gt; &gt; Durham House (and into his other enterprises),
&gt; &gt; yet he was forever complaining of shortage of
&gt; &gt; funds.

&gt; &gt; 'Dearth' (OED)
&gt; &gt;    2. Dearness, costliness, high price. Obsolete.
&gt; &gt;        1596 Bp. Barlow Three Serm. i. 5 Dearth is that, when all those
&gt; things which belong
&gt; &gt;             to the life of man . . . are rated at a high price.]
&gt; &gt;        1632 in Cramond Ann. Banff (1891) I. 67 Compleining of . . . the

&gt; dearthe of the pryce&gt; thairof.
&gt; &gt;        1644 R. Baillie Lett. &amp; Jrnls. (1841) II. 175, I cannot help the

&gt; extraordinarie dearth:

&gt; &gt;              they say the great soume the author putts on his copie, is
&gt; the cause of it.
&gt; &gt;         1602 Shakes. Ham. v. ii. 123 His infusion of such dearth and
&gt; rareness.

&gt; &gt; 4.   Painting thy outward walls so costlie gay?

&gt; &gt; The huge riverside walls of Durham House
&gt; &gt; would have been repainted.  Our poet finds the
&gt; &gt; colour garish. Of course, he is also referring to
&gt; &gt; Raleigh's dress.

&gt; &gt; 5.   Why so large cost hauing so short a lease,

&gt; &gt; Raleigh was merely allowed by the Queen to
&gt; &gt; reside at Durham House.  There was no 'lease'
&gt; &gt; and our poet is being sarcastic.  He is saying
&gt; &gt; that Raleigh's time as favourite will be very
&gt; &gt; short.

&gt; &gt; 6.   Dost thou vpon thy fading mansion spend?

&gt; &gt; There is undoubtedly a play on 'fading man
&gt; &gt; scion'; ('sion' was a common spelling at the
&gt; &gt; time;  the same wordplay occurs in Sonnet 95
&gt; &gt; in a similar context),   This would seem to
&gt; &gt; indicate 1581 as the date of composition.

&gt; &gt; Durham House was exceedingly dilapidated,
&gt; &gt; and Raleigh's refurbishments could not rectify
&gt; &gt; its huge structural problems.

&gt; &gt; 'Fading' is also being used in a sense employed
&gt; &gt; about Autocylus (a caricature of Raleigh) in
&gt; &gt; *Winters Tale*.

&gt; &gt; 'Fading' (OED)
&gt; &gt;        The name of a dance, app. Irish. 'With a fading' was the refrain of
&gt; a popular
&gt; &gt;         song of an indecent character.
&gt; &gt;         1611 Beaum. &amp; Fl. Knt. Burning Pestle iii. v, I will have him
&gt; dance Fading;
&gt; &gt;                  Fading is a fine jig.
&gt; &gt;          1611 Shakes. Wint. T. iv. iv. 195 He has the prettiest Loue-songs
&gt; . . . with
&gt; &gt;                 such delicate burthens of Dildo's and Fadings.

&gt; &gt; 7.   Shall wormes inheritors of this excesse,

&gt; &gt; Our poet identifies the lower-classes as 'worms'.
&gt; &gt; Also, it seems, he intends Puritans -- no doubt
&gt; &gt; partly from an allusion to the Diet of Worms.
&gt; &gt; He says that they will soon acquire all this
&gt; &gt; wealth and these fine palaces -- insofar as
&gt; &gt; anything will be left after the civil war over the
&gt; &gt; succession.

&gt; &gt; 8.   Eate vp thy charge? is this thy bodies end?

&gt; &gt; Raleigh was made 'Esquire of  the Body Extra-
&gt; &gt; ordinary' in 1581 -- a lowly rank which did not
&gt; &gt; reflect the extent of the Queen's favour.  His
&gt; &gt; 'charge' was the person of the Queen.  The
&gt; &gt; 'worms' (of all sorts) will destroy everything
&gt; &gt; of value, since she has made no provision for
&gt; &gt; continuity.  'Thy body' in this context is that
&gt; &gt; of the Queen.

&gt; &gt; The tone sounds as though the poet hopes
&gt; &gt; for the marriage of the Queen, but other factors,
&gt; &gt; such as Raleigh's accumulation of wealth, seem
&gt; &gt; to date the sonnet to 1583-4.  It's quite possible
&gt; &gt; that the later date apples and our poet is merely
&gt; &gt; continuing to speak in his Cassandra voice saying
&gt; &gt; &quot;I was right . . . I told you so&quot; lamenting the end
&gt; &gt; of the Tudor dynasty and foretelling catastrophe.

&gt; &gt; 9.   Then soule liue thou vpon thy seruants losse,

&gt; &gt; There are several recorded incidents that fit
&gt; &gt; this line.  The most obvious date from 1583-4,
&gt; &gt; but there could have been earlier ones.

&gt; &gt; &quot; . . In the case of Walter Ralegh's grant of wines, he sub-contracted
&gt; &gt; to one Richard Browne, who guaranteed him for seven years an annual
&gt; &gt; income of £700 - a sum that should be multiplied by one hundred to
&gt; &gt; give some indication of its value in modern currency. The trouble was
&gt; &gt; that Browne proved too industrious, enforcing his right to license
&gt; &gt; vintners so zealously that he caused great offence - notably in
&gt; &gt; Cambridge where the vice-chancellor jailed Browne's bailiff. On top of
&gt; &gt; that Browne made for himself profits as substantial, if not greater, than
&gt; &gt; the £700 he was giving Ralegh every year, and when Walter asked for
&gt; &gt; some share of these profits, he was told - as he would have told Browne
&gt; &gt; had the lease proved unremunerative - that a bargain was a bargain.
&gt; &gt; So the courtier went back to the source of his fortune and asked the
&gt; &gt; queen to call in his licence and re-grant it to him so that he could
&gt; &gt; negotiate fresh terms - which Elizabeth did.  Poor Browne was sacked.
&gt; &gt; With the queen on his side an Elizabethan could not lose, and although
&gt; &gt; one of Walter's justifications for getting his wine lease renewed had
&gt; &gt; been that Browne's exactions had been harsh and unjust, Walter now
&gt; &gt; set to work with the very same rigour his former agent had employed,
&gt; &gt; doubling his effective income from the monopoly.
&gt; &gt;     Still, the robbery was not all one way. On 26 April 1583, there
&gt; appeared
&gt; &gt; in the law courts of Middlesex one 'Hugh Pewe, gentleman' who was tried
&gt; &gt; for stealing 'a jewel worth £80, a hatband of pearls worth £30, and five
&gt; &gt; yards of silk, called damask, worth £3' the property of Walter Ralegh. . .
&gt; &quot;

&gt; Under your lights, the Sonnets have no

&gt;I'm not sure. I haven't tried to do a full paraphrase, and haven't
&gt;time to do one at present. But I would say there's certainly a
&gt;suggestion there that undercuts the religious imagery.

&gt;&gt;In the early
&gt;&gt; days (1996?) I held out for some time against doing an
&gt;&gt; interlinear paraphrase because it seemed to disguise the
&gt;&gt; continuity of the overall argument. I am still convinced
&gt;&gt; that the first thing to do (not the last thing, and not a
&gt;&gt; particularly elevated thing) is to grasp the argument as a
&gt;&gt; whole. Following that, we can go on to other things, but
&gt;&gt; without it we are merely bombinating in a vacuum.

&gt;I don't tend to think or work that way when interpreting poetry,
&gt;Robert. I start from a certain point and my mind goes out in all
&gt;directions ;)
">

Every now and then I say something that lays me open to
attack like this! But never mind, nobody has picked it up!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;It appears to me that Shakespeare thought in this fashion. He could
&gt;write a phrase and see a whole array of meanings to it. So the sonnet
&gt;is like a prism, and each turn of the prism (or new line) reveals a
&gt;host of different colours.
">

Someone remarked to Philip Larkin how hard it must be to get
everything into rhyme and metre. He said no, that was the
easy part: the really hard part was having something to say
in the first place. (I think this is in his letters, but
have hunted for ages without finding it again.)

I have the strong (subjective) impression that Shakespeare
was doing just the same thing, which very few poets in the
intervening four hundred years have understood. Each poem is
meant to say some thing which it is up to us to grasp. That
supports the impression I have from the sonnets themselves
that there is a coherent argument in each poem and it
matters.

Now, I agree about the kaleidoscope. But, if there were no
solid, fundamental framework, the kaleidoscopic effects
would be a mere house of cards, crumbling at a touch. So
these are two levels I see in the sonnets - goodness knows
what the total number of levels is.

I can't claim 'must'! The impression I get, though, is of
the soul under attack, being eaten away, from outside. So
coming across the 'rebel powers' in the second line, I
looked for a public meaning that would be generally
accessible to someone who had not yet read further. The
expression 'rebel powers' was familiar, but admittedly from
Milton who was not around yet.

I accept that the rebel powers could be the tendencies
leading to sin (hence 'sinful') of the individual himself.
The sinful earth which clothes (arrays) the central soul
also eats it away.(So there is also a change in the meaning
of 'array'.)  In fact, I rather like this - it avoids
bringing in the devils from hell, who seem to have no other
function in the poem.

Plato was saying something rather similar, though I wouldn't
suggest Shakespeare got it from him.

So the revised paraphrase is:

My persecuted soul, living in the middle of my body which is
made of clay and filled with sin,
providing nourishment for these sinful elements that clothe
you,
why do you go hungry in there, enduring famine
to decorate the outer body with such expensive ornaments?
Why so much, when your tenancy is so short,
do you spend to restore your crumbling building?
Are the worms which will get all this in the end
to feed at your expense? Is that what your body is for?
Soul, you should take from the body for your own sustenance,
let the body go short to increase your spiritual wealth,
sell off short-lived valueless stuff in exchange for God's
immortality,
take inward nourishment and give up the outward appearances
of wealth.
By doing that, you will tear apart death, which tears men
apart,
and when death is destroyed, you have no more danger of
dying.

So what have we learned from Sonnet 146 that we didn't already
know?

The speaker seems to have religious concerns about himself or
someone else.

One word description of the poem: Soul.

Sonnet sub-group: ?

***************************************************

The story so far:

So after one hundred-and-forty-six sonnnets, what do we know?

Regarding the first 126 sonnets:

The addressee or referent of the first one
hundred-and-twenty-six sonnets is probably the same person (although
it has been speculated that perhaps the speaker of the first seventeen
poems is different).  At any rate, we are assuming that the same
person is the addressee of these sonnets.

We still don't know what the relationship is between
the speaker and the addressee.  It is clearly an intense,
emotional/romantic relationship.  Whether it is sexual is uncertain.

The speaker says the addressee is physically
attractive.  The description of that beauty is in terms that
would seem more suitable to a woman than a man. (1 - 7, 9,
13, 17-19, especially 20, 41, 54)

The speaker has known the addressee for three years. (104)

The speaker cannot tell what the addressee is thinking by
looking at the addressee's face. (93)

The speaker says that the addressee is narcissistic.
(1 - 4, 6)

The speaker may be chiding the addressee's sexual
habits. (1 - 4, 6, 9, 40 - 42, 58, 61, 69, 96)

The speaker suggests that, while they may acknowledge the
addressee's physical good looks, some unnamed others have a critical
opinion of some aspect of the addressee's character, morals and/or
behaviour. (69, 96)  However, the speaker defends the addressee
against this criticism/slander (70). Yet, the speaker himself seems to
suspect that the addressee, in some way, is not behaving as he should.
But it is difficult to tell this by simply looking at he addressee's
fair appearance.  (93, 95)

The addressee is male. (3, 9, 16, 19-20, 26, 33, 39, 41, 63,
67 - 68, 101)

The speaker is male. (20, 32)

The addressee is of marriageable age, meaning (I
think) that he would be in the 17 - 26 age range. (1 - 4, 6,
8 - 13, 16, 17)

The speaker is older than the addressee. (62 - 63)

The speaker is old. (73)

After an undefined time into the relationship, the speaker
still refers to the addressee as "sweet boy", which raises the
question of how old the addressee actually is. (But this may simply be
a poetic device wherein the speaker is trying to indicate that, to
him, the addressee has not gotten older.)  (108)

The speaker claims he has no interest in sexual
relations with the addressee. (20)

The addressee is sexually interested in women. (41)

The speaker is sexually interested in women. (41)

Women are sexually attracted to the addressee. (3, 16, 20,
41,)

The speaker has a wife or mistress. (40 - 42).

A snag appears in the relationship between the
speaker and addressee. (33, 34)

The snag that appeared in the relationship between
the speaker and addressee seems to concern something that
the addressee did to the speaker which caused the speaker
shame.  The addressee, however, is contrite, and the speaker
has forgiven him. (34)

While it's not certain, the snag that appeared in
the relationship between the speaker and the addressee
probably concerns a love stolen from the speaker by the
addressee. (35)

It seems that the addressee *has* stolen a lover
from the speaker (40 - 42), but the speaker forgives him.
(40, 42)

The speaker expresses concern that he might lose the
affections/attention of the addressee. (48, 90-93).

The speaker tells the addressee he loves him more today than
yesterday, but not as much as tomorrow. (115)

The speaker has a very humble opinion of himself, and is
prepared to excuse almost any behaviour of the addressee (35, 49,
57-58, 87-89).

It's still uncertain what class the speaker and addressee
belong to.  Some have argued that Sonnet 25 indicates that the speaker
is not a member of the nobility, while others argue that it indicates
that he is a member of the nobility.  Some readers have also suggested
that certain words and phrases used in the sonnets indicate that the
addressee is of noble birth. (37, 40)

The speaker's life involved travel that took him
away from the addressee.  Possibly, the travel involved
service for the addressee (27 - 28, 39, 43 - 45, 47, 50 - 51, 61).
The speaker and addressee were separated during the summer (97) and
the spring (98).

By the time of Sonnet 52, whenever it is, the speaker
doesn't seem to be seeing the addressee very often (52).  There also
seems to have been a lapse wherein the speaker did not write about the
addressee (100 - 101).

The speaker seems to find it necessary to explain away a
charge of lessening affection or waywardness after being absent from
the addressee (109).

The speaker has indulged in wayward behaviour vis-a-vis the
addressee in the past, but says he will not to do it again (110).

The speaker claims his past waywardness was just a test of the
addressee's love. (117)

The speaker suggests that his relationship with the addressee
has been made stronger as a result of his past philanderings. (119)

The speaker suggests that his philanderings may be excused on
account of the previous philanderings of the addressee. (120)

The speaker rationalizes giving away a gift the addressee had
given him. (122)

The speaker affirms his fidelity to the addressee despite
time's changes and death. (123)

The speaker is ashamed about something in his life and asks
for the addressee's pity (111).  The speaker was involved in some sort
of public scandal, but is only concerned with what the addressee
thinks of him. (112)

The speaker feels he has been unjustly accused of something.
(121)

Note that we still don't know where the speaker or
the addressee live.

There seems to have been a lull in the speaker/addressee's
emotional relationship. (56)

The speaker has a picture of the addressee which he enjoys
looking at.  (47)

The speaker is preoccupied at night by images of the
addressee. (27 - 28, 43, 61)

The speaker is unaware of anything except the addressee. (113
- 114)

The poet says he is in disgrace for some reason, and
that he is a self-described outcast of some sort, and that
he feels sorry for himself and envious of others, a feeling
that is dispelled when he thinks of his relationship with
the addressee. (29)

The speaker thinks the addressee is too good for him. (87)

For some reason, the speaker thinks that the
addressee will be dishonoured by publicly associating with
the speaker. (36, 71 - 72)

The speaker tells us that his sad memories are
dispelled when he thinks of the addressee. (30)

The speaker's feelings for the addressee are so strong that
they leave the speaker tongue-tied about those feelings in the
presence of the addressee. (23)

The speaker expresses humility about his ability to
express, in writing, his feelings for the addressee. (26,
32, 38, 102)  Yet, the speaker also says his writings contain that
which is best in him. (73 - 74).

The speaker says that he is poor, despised and,
possibly, physically disabled. (37, 89)

The speaker distinguishes himself from "the rich". (52)

However, while the speaker says he is poor in Sonnet 37, he
then says, in Sonnet 48, that he owns jewels. (48)

The speaker so identifies with the addressee, that
any and all of the speaker's faults and shortcomings are
resolved in the positive attributes of the addressee. (37, 62)

The speaker says he sees, in the addressee, the
embodiment of former deceased loves. (31)

The speaker says all good things are but shadows of the
addressee. (53)

The speaker says the addressee has a pleasant
speaking voice and enjoys listening to sad music. (8)

The speaker says the addressee has a gracious and
kind presence. (10)

The speaker seems to think that the addressee has
some sort of love for the speaker. (10, 25, 34, 36, 39, 41, 61, 73)

The speaker seems to have some sort of affectionate
feelings for the addressee, calling him such things as
"love", "dear my love", "master-mistress of my passion", "Lord of my
love" &amp; "sweet love". (13, 19, 20-33, 40, 54, 57-58, 66, 76)

The speaker seems to have believed in a religious theory of
the resurrection of the dead. (55)

The speaker is an aesthetic snob. (11)

The speaker may believe in astrology. (15)

The speaker rides a horse.  (50 - 51)

The speaker, at least at times, was disillusioned with his
world. (66 - 68)

The speaker seems to think that the writers of antiquity were
better able to describe beauty than his contemporaries. (106)

The addressee has been given a blank book in which to record
his thoughts.  The book is possibly from the speaker. (77)

Other poets are using the addressee for their subject matter.
(78)

The speaker is concerned about losing his place with the
addressee to some other male poet. (79)

The speaker considers his ability as a poet to be inferior to
the ability of the male rival poet. (80)

The speaker is jealous of the attention the addressee is
paying to the rival poets. (82)

After intially being confounded by the rival poet, the speaker
is once again writing poetry. (86)

The addressee is fond of praise, which lessens him in the eyes
of the speaker. (84)

The speaker initially thinks that having children is
a better method than a painting or a poem for the addressee
to preserve himself. (16, 17)  However, the speaker comes to
say that he can preserve the beauty of the addressee in his
poetry.  (18 - 19, 54 -55, 60, 63 - 65, 81, 100 -101, 104, 107)

The addressee seems to have been critical of the speaker in
some way concerning his descriptions of the addressee. (83)

The speaker believes he can preserve the best part of himself
in his writings. (74)

The speaker cautions the addressee that he will eventually
grow old. (126)

The speaker, having posed a problem for the
addressee, is offering a solution to that problem - namely

Not true.  The Second Quarto printing of Hamlet omits the phrase "Then
senseless Ilium" in the Player's recital, Scene 7 (traditional Act 2
scene 2.)  That is certainly a printing error, in Hamlet, and it's as
bad as this Sonnet misprint is.

Ridiculous.  Below is the text of  the Second
Quarto.  Tell someone who does not know
the play intimately (i.e, any of 99.999% of us)
that there is a mistake in these lines, and ask
them to identify the location.  The mistake is
an omission of the sort commonly made.

Whereas the 'mistake' in Sonnet 146 is an
insertion, and anyone can spot that line 2 of
the Sonnet is wrong.  You don't need to know
the language nor even be literate.   See:

Paul, you don't know anything about the history of printing, you don't
know anything about the history of proof-reading, and--most extremely,
you don't know anything about human psychology.

Someone in a recent discussion I had mentioned a Bible of the time
printed with "not" accidentally left out of the commendent, "Thou
shalt not commit adultery."  Mistakes can happen.  It's a fact,
Paul.

Aside to anyone reading this: what is known about proof-reading?  When
did it begin, and how did it evolve?  Was there even proof-reading as
such in Shakespeare's time?  Sure, a printer would print a page and
look it over to make sure it was correct--when not rushed.  I
suppose.  How often was an author given a proof copy to check?  Etc.
Any good book on the subject?  I don't know, and I know Paul doesn't,
either, but someone else?
