Hi All,

I am an old retired person who played with little tin pop-pop
steamboats before WW2 when they were some of the favorite toys for
small boys. Pop-pop boats are still being manufactured and don't look
much different from those I played with. They aren't as popular now as
they were back then, so anybody who hasn't seen a pop-pop boat might go
to &lt; http://www.buzzboats.com/ &gt; and click on "Pop Pop Boats" over on the
left side of the opening page.
I am trying to encourage development of a new generation of pop-pop
boats that would look more like real steam powered boats and ships, and
less like recycled tin cans. I thought the best way to do this might be
on a discussion group for pop-pop boats. I couldn't find groups of this
kind and finally decided the only way to find the right kind of group
would be to start one. It is called the "pop-pop-steamboats" group at
&lt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pop-pop-steamboats/ &gt; and now has
slightly more than a hundred members. Our main problem is that there
aren't many kits or plans for scale, or semi-scale, models in the one
to one and a half foot long range that would be suitable for propulsion
by pop-pop engines. Models with the plank on frame, or plank on
bulkhead, construction used for larger scale models might cost too
much, so we are trying to come up with ways for building small plank on
foam core models, or modifying kits for paper boat models to make them
stronger and waterproof- of course. Google helped us find a company
that has a product for making paper maps waterproof at
&lt; www.aquaseal.com &gt;. Most kits of this kind are for making waterline
models, so we think that by adding below the waterline components that
might be carved from blocks of styrofoam and providing thermal
insulation around pop-pop engines and the heat sources that make them
work, we might have a relatively quick and inexpensive method for
producing moderately realistic models propelled by real steam engines
of the simplest possible kind, since it would be hard to get much
simpler than engines that don't have any moving parts. I would be
delighted to have replies from members who know of sources for kits and
plans that we could use- and other construction methods too- of
course.

Best wishes, Frank McNeill

Maybe asking over on uk.rec.sheds  might be an idea.  There is quite
often talk of pop-pop boats there.

Hi Frank, I'm 60 and have never seen or heard of the pop pop steam
boats.
I built one today using 1/8 copper tubing.  It goes great, but I was
some what disappointed that there was zero sound, ...nothing!
The exhaust pulsates and propels the boat, but no put-put sound.

The loudest "pop pop" comes from the diaphragm type engine
A coiled 1/8 copper tube makes a very light pulsing sound as it heats and
cools between pulses.

I can think of two ways I might be able to give your project some help:

#1: If you get some students involved in the R&amp;D, I would be very
interested in donating my time to this project.  It doesn't look like
you are going that route at the moment.  But you might run across a
student looking for a science fair project, or a teacher interested in
sponsoring a science club. The payoff for you would be a page on my
website promoting and describing the effort.

#2: We can also get you the same publicity with a lot less effort:  If
you can think of a couple of good unanswered questions that students
might be able to solve, describe them to me and I will add them to my
list of projects.  Your proposed project(s) need to be doable on a
shoestring budget, and there needs to be some possibility that the
project will accomplish something tangible.  But a project can be a
long-shot.

Frank seems interested in developing a do-it-yourself kit for kids.
Perhaps he has some ideas on things kids might be able to try at home.
By the way, simple projects are good, but don't be afraid of a project
that is conceptually advanced.  Perhaps an analysis of the
thermodynmics of pop-pop motors could be useful.  The mechanism reminds
me of a model geyser demonstration I once saw at a physics meeting.

Going along with Frank's theme of a kid-oriented project, I have a rule
about any boat built by either a child, or an adult with a child-like
approach to boatbuilding:  You need to know that you are the first and
only person to build a boat like the one you are building.

Yours truly, Guy
