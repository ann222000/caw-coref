Hello folks

Would love to hear from schools or about schools which use other formats.
Have been asked if MS Word is the only software used and would like to
give a useful response.

Happy to receive international responses as well as Australian ones.

hey janet

whilst not a school - our tafe college has both open office and micro$oft
products installed on student use computers.  a number of us here teach
using an approach that allows students to choose which of the products they
use but we also run open office specific sessions.

we generally supply the software for starving students cds to our students
to support our teaching of open source goodies.

Hi Janet

When using our LCMS with the students

we often use pdf -  mainly to stop confusion with font problems - especially when dealing with students with computers installed with foreign versions of ms windows etc

It helps us when dealing with all the different version of ms word / publisher etc and there are one or two good free pdf creation programs out there (and its really easy on a mac / linux / freebsd)

just my two cents worth (OK ten cents in NZ)

Hi Janet,

I have been wondering a similar question, that is, how much do schools
budget for commercial software licenses?  If I wanted to find out
(from a state school), could I just call them and ask?  I'm pretty
naive but quite curious about the matter.

I dont have answers on that front, but I think that Kathryn Moyle has
done some research on that kind of topic.

I think it would be good if groups using foss looked at how money
could be used for staff development or customisation around the tools
instead of on the software itself when using foss, but I dont know how
the technology policies/budgets are scoped.

Hi Jeremy,

If it were me, I'd probably start by speaking with someone you have been
directed to by networks.

&quot;Cold calling' can be quite confronting, when asking questiona about
money.

If it were me, I'd ask &quot;Does anyone know anyone in a state school who
might know about IT budgets?&quot;

You might find such a person on this list, even.

Or at least someone who can point you towards that kind of person.

Then that person may w someone in a neighbouring/not neighbouring
school, and you make contacts that way.

Also, there are papers around regarding state govt policy and procedures
for sourcing software, and that any purchasing decisions should include
open source software (they don't call it FSS)

http://www.agimo.gov.au/_sourceit/sourceit/oss
http://www.egov.dpc.wa.gov.au/index.cfm?event=topicsopenSource

But they don't tell you how much schools spend or anything...

Thanks,
Kylie

Hi Kylie,

thanks for those links, that first one will be quite useful.  And yes,
I'll use my common sense before interrogating people about money.  :)

That link about the NZ case is interesting too.  Does anyone know if
Australia has something similar?  I mean, where the state or federal
government pay for licenses?  Or does each school budget for software
entirely itself?

At  the TAFE in SA we use Microsoft's Academic Alliance program  which gives
us access to microsft developer products like visual studio,  project, visio
etc.

I dont know how much it actually costs us, but this page gives some idea of
price
: -

http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/academic/bb250623.aspx

Interestingly we  use Office 2003  to do work processor-spreadsheet-database
training as  we believe that  is what business and industry  expect.

Only students seem to have an interest in open office. There is no demand
from business for Open Office trained students.

Praps you dont see it because you dont look like people to ask for it?
Are there any folks who do open office design work? Templating and stuff?
Preferably with a graphic design degree or experience?
I get requests for this kind of work and cannot always do it.
ie Artwork done in inkscape and gimp preferred.

doesn't business really want people who can figure out how to use any ol'
word processor? My partner uses Open Office almost %100 percent in her daily
business practices, docs, spreadsheets mostly and she saves them in the M$
format for her clients and nobody knows or complains ... and guess what?...
she didn't have to go to school to figure it out. as far as i'm concerned
.... a word processor is a word processor is a word processor... if we're
saying that students are too stoopid to figure out one word processor from
the next then we're in trouble.

I agree wholheartedly, but I assume that the argument is that  we  need to
teach  macro's and visual basic for applications  and i believe there isnt
an equivalent in the open office suite.

Hi Janet,

An email to Grant Casey at the Centre For Learning Innovation, TAFE
NSW will reveal the extent to which Bill has buried his tendrils into
the schools MS / other sector format war.

Hi Brent

I like your comment - it reflects perfectly the way of many areas of the
world and of some job types such as office admin people.

They learn a process which goes with a specific brand/version of word
processor - my memory stretches back to WordPerfect/WordStar (amongst
many others) being used in the office. As soon as a new version came out
- off to training they did go - to relearn how to use the same features.

Lots of training bodies makes lots of $$$ from training for new
versions, so some of them don't want &quot;smart workers&quot; who can work out
that any old package is just that. Some business are happy with this
too, it limits what they need to support, and keeps their workers from
playing with the package (or am I getting cynical in my old age)

I agree with you a WP is a WP.

Our IT students learn how to explore to use the functions rather than
(eg like many office studies students) to work a process without knowing
how the package works
