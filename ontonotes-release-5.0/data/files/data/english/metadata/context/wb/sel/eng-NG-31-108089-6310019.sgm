A round to the one who can answer this.
Haven't started my 2003 Nighttrain in about a month.
Started it in my driveway, and within 3-5 seconds the oil tank cap
blows out, covering my right leg with oil and putting about a cup of
oil on the ground.
Cleaned this up, started my bike again, and again within a couple of
seconds pow, more oil on my changed  clean jeans and another cup or
two on the ground.  Changed my oil about 6 months ago, and since have
made a 2,000 mile trip without problems.. and haven't added any oil
since.  Any one with a cause???
Thanks.

Only time I ever saw something like this was with my old '69 FLH. Forgot
to shut off the petcock when I parked it and it sat for six weeks. When
I got the bike out, gas had filled the crankcase and I got a gusher when
I fired it up.

Don't know how this would happen with a newer bike though.

A month?! Well there's one big problem right there, but let's move
on... :^)

If it's NOT over full, or if the vent line is NOT clogged/pinched,
then I've got two words for ya: check ball.  Softails, 'cause they
have a tank higher than the motah&lt;(c)StT&gt;, use a check ball in the oil
pump to prevent sumping, aka oil draining down into the crankcase when
it sits.  Old bikes almost always did that, but newer bikes don't
usually have that problem.  The solutions range from easy to
expensive:

1) Clean the oil cap rubber and the oil tank neck really well (carb
cleaner or somesuch), fire the bike up again and try to let it warm up
as close to idle as possible (no revving).  Eventually, it'll
recirculate and the oil will end up where it's supposed to be again.

2) Reseat the checkball.  Do NOT use a punch to do this, or you'll be
buying a new oil pump body fairly soon.  Sometimes it works, IF you
know what you're doing, but usually you just deform the seat and trash
the pump.  The correct way to fix it is to burnish the seat.  You can
make your own burnisher by silver soldering a new check ball onto the
end of an oil pump shaft, with an appropriate sized bushing to hold it
true in the well, and applying pressure while turning the shaft.

3) Replace the oil pump with a new one.  Expensive, yes, but it'll fix
your problem...

If you're messing with your oil pump, you might want to check out the 4
or 5 part article that American Iron magazine ran late last year if you
can find it. He said one of the biggest causes of oil blowback (not
necessarily through the oil tank) was the alignment of the oil pump,
both at the factory and by folks in the shop or at home.

Um...yeah. Unless of course you have a TWINCAM motor, in which case
none of the above applies to you. &lt;sigh&gt; Man, that guy outta remember
to have at least *two* cups before he posts, especially when it's only
20 degrees on the way in to work. I guess m...er...*his* brain is
still frozen...

For a twinky, I'd double check your oil level, then the vent hose,
then indeed clean the cap and throat real good and give it another
shot.  If it blows again, pull your intake breather hoses and clean
'em out real good. If that still doesn't work, then it is indeed time
to pull your cam cover and re-align the oil pump.  Kinda weird, tho',
that it wasn't a problem before.  You change anything recently?
