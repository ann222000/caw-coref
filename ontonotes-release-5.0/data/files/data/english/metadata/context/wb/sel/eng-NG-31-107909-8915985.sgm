Does anyone know if the ´95 YJ PCM waits for a signal from any sensor
before providing ground for turning on the check engine light, ASD
relay and fuel pump relay?

Thanks

Heh, no idea but if you don't live in the high desert like I do all the
ground connections are rusted by now...

Cheers,

Thanks Earl.  This problem has been going on for a while now and is
mostly documented in the &quot;Delayed start problem&quot; thread.  I've tried a
lot of things including cleaning the ground connections and just can't
figure it out.  I'm considering taking it to the dealership at this
point, regardless of the potential cost.

While I am generally in favor of the scientific approach, have you priced or
located a junk yard PCM?  That will isolate whether the problem is interior
to the PCM or not, and may be cheaper than a couple of ASE mechanics
scratching their heads for two hours on your dollar.

My '95 YJ has always taken one or two seconds of cranking before it will
fire cold.  It did this new, and I always figured it was part of the nature
of the beast.  Has it thrown any codes?  They say you can read them by
switching the key on and off a few times and watching the check engine light
flash.

Cheers,

Earle

My YJ also takes second or two of cranking to start but this is
different, the fuel pump does not get activated unless the check
engine comes light comes on for a short while, after that it is
completely normal. No relavant codes, just battery disconnected and AC
clutch (because it does not have AC). I think it is worth checking on
used PCMs, thanks for the idea.

Can't say for the 95, but the on the 93 if it fails to get sensor input
from the CPS, the ignition shuts down (ASD) after about two cranks.

I've started the engine without the coolant, O2, and MAT sensors.
Haven't tried disconnecting the MAP though, but it should run at
least in limp-home mode.

The last time I had a problem with nostart it was due to a coil
going bad.  One of the issues (if you have a return style fuel
rail) is the pressure regulator leaking.  This makes the jeep take
more time to pressurize the rail and is usually the cause.  Easy
way to tell is to turn the key on (let the pump buzz) then turn
the key off, then start the engine.  That primes the rail.
In some real bad cases air can get into the rail and make for
a real interesting start. (think bucking horse)

Wow, so it can run with some sensors disabled.  This makes it even
less likely that it is a sensor problem.  I'm thinking PCM much more
seriously now.  The problem I'm having is that whan I turn the key to
run to let the pump buzz (this also usually lights the check engine
light at the same time) it does nothing for a while (16 seconds this
morning), then it suddenly comes on and I am able to start the jeep.
If I don't confirm that the pump has run, it just won't start when
cranking (well, maybe it would if I let it crank for 16 seconds!)

I am thinking grease congealed in the mechanism, preventing the contacts
from hitting for a few seconds, eh?

It doesn't wait for anything. If you've verified the grounds, battery
feed and and power from the ignition switch, the PCM is toast.

Yup, I verified all these things and they are just about perfect.  I
was pretty sure and hoping one of these would be bad.  I took it to
the dealership today for diagnostic check just to make sure but at
this point I'll most likely have to buy a computer.

If I get a used computer, what do I need to look out for to make sure
it is the right one?

For a 1995 YJ four cylinder I think the only two PCM part numbers are likely
to be California and 49 State.  Any large recycler in the U.S. will have a
parts interchange catalog that will tell you which vehicles are valid
donors.  They get this information better than the dealers.  The possibility
exists that earlier vehicles and the four cylinder Cherokee are a match too.
The dealer can tell you the current part number for your PCM and whether it
has been superseded in service parts.  This can be helpful if you find a new
replacement at a reasonable price.

Cheers,

Earle

The main connection to the computer is known to get corroded pins and
cause a 'failure'.  You look for green stains.

Thanks Mike.  You mentioned that before and I checked it but it looked
pretty clean.  I cleaned it with contact cleaner and scraped each
cavity in the connector a bit but it still had the problem.  I'm
pretty convinced its the PCM at this point.
