Overnighting in Wal-Mart with dogs

As you know, most Wal-Mart stores allow RV parking in their lots.
Bellingham, Washington is a college town that is also close to Mt
Baker, a snowboarder's heaven. This Wal-Mart is on the way to Mt
Baker, and there are usually 20-30 RVs parked there every day...I
don't
know how many are 'homesteaders', but I'd suspect more than just a
'few'.

Incidents like this will only make 'Boondocking' in a RV harder in the
future...especially with dogs.

"possibly"?
"how to handle matters"?

"Police had been called to the Wal-Mart lot in the 4400 block of

"Dumping sewage".... the police shot the wrong thing.

The sewage didn't jump out and bite them.

Nah, it ain't funny, is it.  This kind of thing reminds me of a
state park near Olympia I stayed in, where one of the sites had a
class C with flat tires. They weren't traveling.  They were
squatting.

Unforunnately you may be right. I have heard the PC reigns
there at times.

But I have to tell you. Even here in the Liberal Bay Area folks
would not put up with this shit. If that happened at our local
Antioch Wal-Mart that transient would be in jail in a flash.

We have had some very bad Pit Bull incidents in Contra Costa
County. People here are at the point where they are likely to
do something stupid if the cops don't act quick on this kinda shit.

That transient bum should be prosecuted on numerous counts.
Here, his ass would be in the Martinez lock up, if for no other
reason than for his own health and safety.

I am so appalled that he was "dumping sewage" that I have to wonder if
it was gray water, not black.

It's unfathomable that anyone would dump black water on a parking lot.

Lon has a point, though.

Here in Washington one state legislator was disturbed by a noisy ATV
one day. He proudly admits that his sponsorship of bills to virtually
outlaw us stems from that one incident.
While the laws you mentioned above are reasonable, a huge number of
laws are caused by the stupid actions of a few, and should never have
been passed.
Making a law to restrict us in some way is a serious thing, and should
be done only after due consideration, but they aren't in many cases.
Our legislature meets once a year for a couple of months. We would all
be better off if they met once every five years. Or not at all.

&gt;Laws are generally made to protect the general population.  If it

Actually, the "dangerous" breeds, determined by insurance companies,

Pit Bulls top the list.

Pit bulls make great pets...the fact that they bite is not dependent on the
breed; it's because of owners that provoke and reward such anti social
behavior.

Maybe we should institute a pit bull registration system.  Background checks
before you are allowed to purchase a pitbull.  No more than one pit bull
purchase in any calander year.  How about a Concealed Walker Permit.
Without such a permit the dog must be walked in plain view so an ordinary
person can see it coming.  If you get the CWP you can purchase three
pitbulls per year and no need for a background check.

A non-profit organization should be set up to designate proper pit bull
handling training courses.  Call it Eddie Cat.  A legislative political
action copmmittee leg of this organization should be established too.
Membership benefits should include a subscription to a magazine and a nice
bumper sticker that tells the whole world you belong.

A few minor compromises to appease the anti pit bull crowd?

I seriously doubt if anyone would consider that shitbird with a
pitbull in Bellingham,  an "RVer",  even if he was in an RV.
My guess is, that he's an ex-convict,  and the DA is waiting for a
complete CLETS report,  with a "parole hold",  so they can ship him off
to somewhere else, without an expensive trial for Watcom Co.
I hate to bring it up,  but that whole story sounds just like the sort
of thing one would expect to occur in a Wal*Mart parking lot...
I doubt if Wal*Mart will change their policy of letting folks
overnight there because of this latest incident...  They know not to
take freebies away from the "fan base"!
However,  I'd be very surprised if the folks in Bellingham feel the
same!  Most cities are beginning to feel about Wal*Mart,  just like they
do about "porno parlors",  or topless biker bars!  YMMV...

Bellingham just enacted a moritorium on store sizes greater than 75,000
square feet to block Wal*Mart SuperStores. Ferndale, a nearby town, has done
the same as did Whatcom County. Wal*Mart is now, supposedly, considering
building on nearby Indian reservation land.

Personally, I'm opposed to the legislation. Not that they listened to me, of

Yeah, they should stop with the pipe end over a drain and lift the grate so
no mess is left on the asphalt.

Ducking for cover.... I'm just kidding ;-)

&gt; Lon has a point, though.

&gt; Here in Washington one state legislator was disturbed by a noisy ATV
&gt; one day. He proudly admits that his sponsorship of bills to virtually
&gt; outlaw us stems from that one incident.
&gt; While the laws you mentioned above are reasonable, a huge number of
&gt; laws are caused by the stupid actions of a few, and should never have
&gt; been passed.
&gt; Making a law to restrict us in some way is a serious thing, and should
&gt; be done only after due consideration, but they aren't in many cases.
&gt; Our legislature meets once a year for a couple of months. We would all
&gt; be better off if they met once every five years. Or not at all.

Lon absolutely has a point!

Too many times the dumbass politicians run and bleat
out more laws because existing laws are not being
enforced. They do it as a self serving way to
"point with pride" at what they have done. Too
many times it's just pure bullshit and more crud
on the books that is not being enforced.

Dollars to donuts that there are already plenty of
laws that can put that violater in the slam on
multiple counts. As citizens, we should try to
make sure and insist that existing statutes for
nasty crud like this are carried out.

That's why I want to know the outcome of this.
If they just slapped this guys hand and turned
him loose we should raise all kinds of hell.

The officer that went to the hospital should
start a civil action against that slob.

&gt;&gt; Every day Lon sounds more and more like Hunter.  [Remember &quot;All mall
&gt;&gt; pet shops are evil&quot;]

&gt;&gt; Will Sill
&gt;&gt; The Curmudgeon of Sill Hill

&gt;Fer crying out loud, Will, give it a rest, will ya?

&gt;You and Lon having a falling out was bad enough.  For years he went out of
&gt;his way to understand and support you.  Even if you hate his guts now, and
&gt;even if you were justified in doing so -- do you really derive any
&gt;satisfaction from continuously poisoning the atmosphere?  Perhaps you think
&gt;you are being funny.  Let me assure you that you are not.

Carl, the saddest part of this episode is that Will is now being his
ankle-biting self to the only one that defended him all these years.
Will hasn't changed.  He just decided to transfer his nasty attention
to Lon instead of Hunter.

You can bet your sweet ass the next time we take an "Asshole" vote on
RORT  there will be one less asshole supporter.

&gt;Pit bulls make great pets...the fact that they bite is not dependent on the
&gt;breed; it's because of owners that provoke and reward such anti social
&gt;behavior.

Yea right!  That is why someone that wants a vicious dog goes for an
Irish Setter or Cocker Spaniel.

If you keep saying "pit bulls make great pets" you might get Bush and
his apologist to believe it since they will believe most anything but
the rest of the world is going to know that you are full of shit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree. I am a terrier fan and feel sadness when I see stories like this.
&gt;&gt;&gt;It seems every mentally deranged individual in the country owns a pit
&gt;&gt;&gt;bull.
&gt;&gt;&gt;If this goof had owned a german sheperd the outcome would have been the
&gt;&gt;&gt;same.
&gt;&gt; ----------------------------
&gt;&gt; I doubt that.

&gt;You don't know dogs very well mike

Wrong again.  I know dogs very well.

There is a world of difference in a German Shepherd and a pit bull.
How many pit bulls do you see working as police dogs?  How many pit
bulls do you see leading blind people around?  How many pit bulls do
you hear about being used to rescue people?

Then again how many pit bulls do you hear about in dog fights or
attacking people?
