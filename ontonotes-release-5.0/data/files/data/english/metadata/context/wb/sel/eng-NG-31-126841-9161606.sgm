Before a single Democrat condemns MoveOn's ad, they should insist that George
W. Bush and the Republican Party repudiate the anti-military smears on war
heroes that have been the hallmark of Mr. Bush's political career.
Too many Democrats still think Mr. Bush's presidency is on the level. Let's
be clear. Mr. Bush is not leading a serious, sober discussion about public
discourse during a war. He wants to divide progressives and score political
points. We should not let him. Throughout his career he's been willing to
tolerate and benefit from vicious lies about military men. We should not concede
that he is legitimately angry now.
Mr. Bush is, as he likes to say, a loving guy. But by golly the MoveOn.org ad
criticizing Gen. David Petraeus has him madder than Larry Craig in a pay
toilet.
When a &quot;reporter&quot; asked him a loaded question about the MoveOn ad (not
mentioning, for example, that Petraeus wrote an op-ed in support of the Bush  Iraq
policy a few weeks before the 2004 election), Bush swung for the fences.  But
then again, he's always been pretty good at T-Ball - and this was definitely
teed up for him.
He slammed MoveOn, repeating language he used Wednesday in a meeting with
right-wing columnists, saying that criticizing Petraeus is tantamount to
attacking the entire US military, and expressing astonishment that leading
Democrats have not attacked MoveOn as courageously as Bush has.
Before Democrats fall all over themselves to agree with a president whose
trust and honesty rating from the American people is even lower than his IQ,
let's look at the real record of Bush's cowardice when it comes to speaking out
against attacks on military heroes:
*   In the 2000 South Carolina primary, George W. Bush stood  next to a
man described as a &quot;fringe&quot; figure - a man who had attacked Bush's  own father
- at a Bush rally. With Bush applauding him, the man said John  McCain
&quot;abandoned&quot; veterans. McCain, who was tortured in a North Vietnamese  POW camp, was
incensed. Five U.S. Senators who fought in Vietnam, including  Democrats John
Kerry, Max Cleland and Bob Kerrey, condemned the attack and  called on Bush to
repudiate it. When pressed on it at a debate hosted by CNN's  Larry King, Bush
meekly muttered that he shouldn't be held responsible for  what others say.
Even when he's standing next to them at a Bush rally.
*   In the 2002 campaign, draft dodger Saxby Chambliss ran an ad with
pictures  of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, then said Sen. Max Cleland
lacked  courage. Max Cleland left three limbs in Vietnam as an Army captain. Mr.
Bush's political aide, Karl Rove, later refused to disavow the ad, saying,
&quot;President Bush and the White House don't write the ads for Senate  candidates.&quot;
*   Also in the 2002 campaign, the PAC for the Family Research Council, a
close Bush ally, ran an ad in South Dakota that pictured Sen. Tom Daschle
and  Saddam Hussein. &quot;What do Saddam Hussein and Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle  have in common?&quot; the ad asked. Apparently, they both opposed drilling in
the  Arctic wilderness. First, I had no idea that supporting drilling in the
wilderness is a family values issue. Second, I have seen no reporting on the
late Iraqi dictator's position on Alaska drilling. But I do know Tom Daschle
is an Air Force veteran. Mr. Bush never disavowed the smear.
*   But perhaps the worst was what was done to John Kerry. Kerry  earned
five major medals in combat: the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and three
Purple Hearts. And yet supporters of Bush and Cheney decided to smear his war
record. The despicable, dishonest Swift Boat attacks alleged that Kerry
fabricated reports that earned him the Bronze Star. The Swifties also  suggested that
Kerry's wounds were insignificant - and that one was even  self-inflicted.
Kerry's wounds were certainly more serious than Mr. Bush's,  who suffered a cut on
his finger from popping a beer can while avoiding his  duty in the Alabama
National Guard. At the 2000 GOP convention, rich, white  Republicans were
photographed gleefully putting Band-Aids with purple hearts  on their chubby cheeks.
Mr. Bush refused to condemn the attack - blandly  noting he didn't like 527
groups generally - and later nominated one of the  men who financed the smear
to be Ambassador to Belgium.
Mr. Bush is a coward and a bully. He knows he'll never be the kind of  hero
his father was. He knows he lacks the heroism of John Kerry or Max Cleland,  so
he overcompensates with bluster and bravado. In fact, he told  bloggers
recently that he wishes he were fighting in Iraq. The Washington  Post's Dan
Froomkin reported that Bush told a blogger in Iraq that he'd  like to be carrying a
50-pound pack and an M-16, but, &quot;One, I'm too old to be  out there. And, two,
they'd notice me.&quot;
So Mr. Bush is too old to fight in Iraq, and he was too rich and
well-connected to fight in Vietnam. But he's itchin' for a fight with a  progressive
interest group. Does anyone believe he'd have the same outrage if a  right-wing
group were attacking war heroes? Of course not.

&quot;When Fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag  and carrying
a cross.&quot; --Sinclair Lewis

The Democrats would be better served if they tried to defeat AQ and
Radical Islam rather than seek meaningless votes in the Senate that
promote theit fake and partisan &quot;We are defeated and can not win&quot;
mantra.  Or how about seeking meaningful SS reform...  Nah, they want
issues not solutions...

Kerry isn't a war hero. He's a poser, a murderer and a traitor. He
trumped up the case for his &quot;medals&quot;, admitted firing a 50 caliber
machine gun into villages full of women and children and then he went
before a Senate committee and leveled false, unsubstantiated
accusations of brutality against his fellow soldiers, comparing them
to the barbarian, Ghengis Khan. What Kerry got from the Swift Boaters
was well deserved.

&gt; &gt;     *   In the 2002 campaign, draft dodger Saxby Chambliss ran an ad with
&gt; &gt; pictures  of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, then said Sen. Max Cleland
&gt; &gt; lacked  courage. Max Cleland left three limbs in Vietnam as an Army captain. Mr.
&gt; &gt; Bush's political aide, Karl Rove, later refused to disavow the ad, saying,
&gt; &gt; &quot;President Bush and the White House don't write the ads for Senate  candidates.&quot;
&gt; &gt;     *   Also in the 2002 campaign, the PAC for the Family Research Council, a
&gt; &gt;  close Bush ally, ran an ad in South Dakota that pictured Sen. Tom Daschle
&gt; &gt; and  Saddam Hussein. &quot;What do Saddam Hussein and Senate Majority Leader Tom
&gt; &gt; Daschle  have in common?&quot; the ad asked. Apparently, they both opposed drilling in
&gt; &gt; the  Arctic wilderness. First, I had no idea that supporting drilling in the
&gt; &gt; wilderness is a family values issue. Second, I have seen no reporting on the
&gt; &gt; late Iraqi dictator's position on Alaska drilling. But I do know Tom Daschle
&gt; &gt; is an Air Force veteran. Mr. Bush never disavowed the smear.
&gt; &gt;     *   But perhaps the worst was what was done to John Kerry. Kerry  earned
&gt; &gt; five major medals in combat: the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and three
&gt; &gt; Purple Hearts. And yet supporters of Bush and Cheney decided to smear his war
&gt; &gt; record. The despicable, dishonest Swift Boat attacks alleged that Kerry
&gt; &gt; fabricated reports that earned him the Bronze Star. The Swifties also  suggested that
&gt; &gt; Kerry's wounds were insignificant - and that one was even  self-inflicted.
&gt; &gt; Kerry's wounds were certainly more serious than Mr. Bush's,  who suffered a cut on
&gt; &gt; his finger from popping a beer can while avoiding his  duty in the Alabama
&gt; &gt; National Guard. At the 2000 GOP convention, rich, white  Republicans were
&gt; &gt; photographed gleefully putting Band-Aids with purple hearts  on their chubby cheeks.
&gt; &gt; Mr. Bush refused to condemn the attack - blandly  noting he didn't like 527
&gt; &gt; groups generally - and later nominated one of the  men who financed the smear
&gt; &gt; to be Ambassador to Belgium.
&gt; &gt; Mr. Bush is a coward and a bully. He knows he'll never be the kind of  hero
&gt; &gt; his father was. He knows he lacks the heroism of John Kerry or Max Cleland,  so
&gt; &gt; he overcompensates with bluster and bravado. In fact, he told  bloggers
&gt; &gt; recently that he wishes he were fighting in Iraq. The Washington  Post's Dan
&gt; &gt; Froomkin reported that Bush told a blogger in Iraq that he'd  like to be carrying a
&gt; &gt; 50-pound pack and an M-16, but, &quot;One, I'm too old to be  out there. And, two,
&gt; &gt; they'd notice me.&quot;
&gt; &gt; So Mr. Bush is too old to fight in Iraq, and he was too rich and
&gt; &gt; well-connected to fight in Vietnam. But he's itchin' for a fight with a  progressive
&gt; &gt; interest group. Does anyone believe he'd have the same outrage if a  right-wing
&gt; &gt; group were attacking war heroes? Of course not.

&gt; &gt; &quot;When Fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag  and carrying
&gt; &gt; a cross.&quot; --Sinclair Lewis

&gt; &gt; &gt; veOn)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Before a single Democrat condemns MoveOn's ad, they should insist that George
&gt; &gt; &gt;  W. Bush and the Republican Party repudiate the anti-military smears on war
&gt; &gt; &gt; heroes that have been the hallmark of Mr. Bush's political career.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Too many Democrats still think Mr. Bush's presidency is on the level. Let's
&gt; &gt; &gt; be clear. Mr. Bush is not leading a serious, sober discussion about public
&gt; &gt; &gt; discourse during a war. He wants to divide progressives and score political
&gt; &gt; &gt; points. We should not let him. Throughout his career he's been willing to
&gt; &gt; &gt; tolerate and benefit from vicious lies about military men. We should not concede
&gt; &gt; &gt; that he is legitimately angry now.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mr. Bush is, as he likes to say, a loving guy. But by golly the MoveOn.org ad
&gt; &gt; &gt;  criticizing Gen. David Petraeus has him madder than Larry Craig in a pay
&gt; &gt; &gt; toilet.
&gt; &gt; &gt; When a &quot;reporter&quot; asked him a loaded question about the MoveOn ad (not
&gt; &gt; &gt; mentioning, for example, that Petraeus wrote an op-ed in support of the Bush  Iraq
&gt; &gt; &gt; policy a few weeks before the 2004 election), Bush swung for the fences.  But
&gt; &gt; &gt; then again, he's always been pretty good at T-Ball - and this was definitely
&gt; &gt; &gt; teed up for him.
&gt; &gt; &gt; He slammed MoveOn, repeating language he used Wednesday in a meeting with
&gt; &gt; &gt; right-wing columnists, saying that criticizing Petraeus is tantamount to
&gt; &gt; &gt; attacking the entire US military, and expressing astonishment that leading
&gt; &gt; &gt; Democrats have not attacked MoveOn as courageously as Bush has.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Before Democrats fall all over themselves to agree with a president whose
&gt; &gt; &gt; trust and honesty rating from the American people is even lower than his IQ,
&gt; &gt; &gt; let's look at the real record of Bush's cowardice when it comes to speaking out
&gt; &gt; &gt; against attacks on military heroes:
&gt; &gt; &gt;     *   In the 2000 South Carolina primary, George W. Bush stood  next to a
&gt; &gt; &gt; man described as a &quot;fringe&quot; figure - a man who had attacked Bush's  own father
&gt; &gt; &gt; - at a Bush rally. With Bush applauding him, the man said John  McCain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;abandoned&quot; veterans. McCain, who was tortured in a North Vietnamese  POW camp, was
&gt; &gt; &gt; incensed. Five U.S. Senators who fought in Vietnam, including  Democrats John
&gt; &gt; &gt; Kerry, Max Cleland and Bob Kerrey, condemned the attack and  called on Bush to
&gt; &gt; &gt; repudiate it. When pressed on it at a debate hosted by CNN's  Larry King, Bush
&gt; &gt; &gt; meekly muttered that he shouldn't be held responsible for  what others say.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Even when he's standing next to them at a Bush rally.
&gt; &gt; &gt;     *   In the 2002 campaign, draft dodger Saxby Chambliss ran an ad with
&gt; &gt; &gt; pictures  of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, then said Sen. Max Cleland
&gt; &gt; &gt; lacked  courage. Max Cleland left three limbs in Vietnam as an Army captain. Mr.

&gt; &gt; &gt; the  Arctic wilderness. First, I had no idea that supporting drilling in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; wilderness is a family values issue. Second, I have seen no reporting on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; late Iraqi dictator's position on Alaska drilling. But I do know Tom Daschle
&gt; &gt; &gt; is an Air Force veteran. Mr. Bush never disavowed the smear.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So Mr. Bush is too old to fight in Iraq, and he was too rich and

&gt; &gt; &gt; interest group. Does anyone believe he'd have the same outrage if a  right-wing

Kerry got 3 medals...  Atleast one was under questioned
circumstances...  Kerry was an ordinary solder who did not rise above
most solders' bravery... There are examples of men who one can call
heros.  Sen. McCain, Kerrey, Dole. President GH Bush, Eisonhower, and
Kennedy come to mind...  The hype that Kerry is special is just that
-- hype...   What did Kerry in was Kerry's post military deeds and his
positons in the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's...  He also publicly lied
about his experiences (Chrismas in Cambodia) over the years...  He
selectively choose some of his mates to insist &quot;I am a Hero&quot;...  He
claimed all of his mates favored him...  They didn't, and in fact some
questioned his medals...

Now I would not call Kerry a traitor (he is NOT), but neiither is he
the war Hero you claim him to be...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Froomkin reported that Bush told a blogger in Iraq that he'd  like to be carrying a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 50-pound pack and an M-16, but, &quot;One, I'm too old to be  out there. And, two,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they'd notice me.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So Mr. Bush is too old to fight in Iraq, and he was too rich and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well-connected to fight in Vietnam. But he's itchin' for a fight with a  progressive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interest group. Does anyone believe he'd have the same outrage if a  right-wing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; group were attacking war heroes? Of course not.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;When Fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag  and carrying
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a cross.&quot; --Sinclair Lewis
