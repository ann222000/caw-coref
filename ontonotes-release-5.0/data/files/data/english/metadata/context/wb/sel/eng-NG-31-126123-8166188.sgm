I have a WI66PRO that I absolutely love. While mine has a set neck and
higher quality pups / electronics, the body is basically the same as the
WI14's except for the bolt on neck.

Mine is so light that I almost don't feel the weight when I have it
strapped on.

I usually alternate between my Epi LP Standard and the Washburn when
playing. While they both play very well and have really good sound, I am
undecided if I like the Seymore Duncan pups over the Epiphone's.

Hopefully someone with a WI14 can chime in with some actual experience
with one.

You're not concerned about the sound? What, you just want it to have some
glamour shots taken?

&gt; Due to health reasons, weight is my first concern. I have a pair of

&gt; a
&gt; ~160? guitar. So does anyone know the weight of the fuckin guitar?

It's too much guitar for you junior. You should look at the Daisy rock

I have a WI66PRO, and it is one of the most comfortable feeling guitars
I have ever held. Mine is set neck, the WI14 is bolt on.  Have not held
one so I can only give you info from my experience.

If weight is so critical, they make a WI67 that is the same shape and
build as the WI66 but it is hollow body on the top half with an &quot;f&quot;
hole. Even lighter.

Washburn tells me (I emailed them, I find most of the manufacturers
respond pretty quick) 8 - 10 lbs depending on the specific piece of
lumber. They claim that they are lighter than comparitive Gibson
models, guess they forgot about Epi.  My Gibson are 10 lbs + so they
are right there, but my Epi is just over 7 lbs.

Haven't played one myself but do like the looks of the Wi66.
