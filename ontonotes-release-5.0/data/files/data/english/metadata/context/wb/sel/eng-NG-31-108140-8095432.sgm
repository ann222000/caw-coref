Ralph W4ZO came over this afternoon with my Viking transmitter
in the trunk of his Crown Vic.
After some adjusting of the contacts on the Dow-Key relay
it's on the air.
You can see a photo of the AM station here,
http://radioheaven.homestead.com/AMstation.html

It's sitting on the right hand side of my big green chair.
The rest of the ham shack is on the left side.

If 75 meters gets a little less noisy maybe I find make some
QSOs.

3.885, really 3.88456 according to the freq counter.

73, Ron

Every time I see one of those I think back to the time I built one
from a kit.  Was still in high school.  I was so proud of that
transmitter.  Used crystals initially before I modified an ARC-5
transmitter as a VFO.  Of course those days are gone forever, but
there is nothing to compare them to these days.

Not really.  Back in those days it was somewhat of a miracle to get
things running and operating correctly.  You felt a real sense of
accomplishment to get a station running well.  Now you just go to the
store, buy a radio and plug it in.  I suppose in some people's views
that is better.

Considering the &quot;caliber&quot; of some &quot;operators&quot; - it not only may be
better - it may be the only way some &quot;get on the air&quot;...

Often then, many others wish they hadn't.
