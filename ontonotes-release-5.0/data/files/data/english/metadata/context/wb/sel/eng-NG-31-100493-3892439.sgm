Ok, i was fishing for anything bad about ceramic brakes on an earlier post.
So, I might as well ask the group about all brakes then.  What are the ups
and downs about all the kinds of brakes that are made?  What should i get.
Yes, i have front anti-lock, and real drum.  I wish i could get drums on
front, but thats another story.  I do quite a bit of off road and trailer
hauling.  So, all info would be wonderfull.

And, as for the Ford comercial lattely about no anti-lock brakes and cromple
zones.  Its kinda funny, my trailers do.  Where are they getting there info
from at the addvertising department.  Just a personal funny.

Well there are really only a few types of pad materials useable on a
daily driver. Organic pads- Older tech but will stop better than just
about every other type ONCE. Then they build up heat and fade. So they
developed Semi-Metallic- Which are Organic pads with metal binders. The
metal (usually brass) provides faster heat dissipation and gives longer
wear, at the detriment to rotor life. (heat has to go someplace, plus
ANY metal will increase the wear to the rotors). Then there are carbon
fiber pads/shoes. They are great once they warm up to temperature. But
the first time you step on the pedal with cold pads you will notice they
don't grip as hard. Then there are "ceramic" pads. They are semi
metallic pads using a ceramic powder and high temperature to sinter the
base materials into pads. They are also good pads, they grab better HOT
than cold but are still better than CF on the first stop. However you
can plan on rotors at just about every brake pad change.
For drums, you can get Organics, Semis and some CF shoes. The Ceramics
don't flex very well so I don't think they will translate into a shoe
very well.
Also with drums try to find a shop that still knows how to grind the
shoes to fit a worn or turned drum, that helps eliminate a LOT of
problems caused by the flexing of the backer shoe and the lack of
contact that results with a turned drum.

WOW, thank you for all the info.  It was verry helpfull.  As for the ceramic
pads not bending??  If its a powder, would the powder nead to bend??  Just a
question.  Buy the sounds of it, for a daily driver organic sounds like the
best bet.  But for hauling a trailer, if it was what was on the truck to
begin with, i'll get them agian.  They lasted this long, and the roters and
drums have hardlly any wear on them..  So, organic by the looks of it.  Is
that what Napa makes them out of??  There is a Napa in our tiny town, so,
i'll pick some up.

The ceramics start as powder. They are then heated and fused into a
solid (sintered) shoe. On pads this is OK since they don't flex. On
shoes the backer plates flex when you apply the brakes. I would bet your
truck has semi-metallic on the front and rear.

Well, TBone, thank you for your honesty.  Wemi-metalic is what is on my
truck i found out with a phone call to a 45 years experiance technisian in
my Grandpa.  We dont talk much but i had to call and ask.  And a big thank
you to Steve W. for the insight.  Verry informative,

On my Ford (that I used to wn - an AeroStar) I found the only way to
get more than a year out of the pads, and more than a set of pads out
of the rotors, and get some decent stopping power at the same time,
was to install carbon metallic pads.

Before the carbon metallics, there was NO WAY I could lock the front
wheels on dry pavement. This meant the rear brakes locked first in a
hard panic type stop, and the crude anti-lock shut the rear brakes
off.

With C/M pads I could stop MUCH shorter.
I towed a trailer on occaision, and with the C/M pads the brakes did
not fade, and I did not have to depend as heavilly on the trailer
brakes.
I could replace a worn set of pads after about 2 years and still have
useable rotors - I skimmed them 2 times, for 3 sets of pads on one set
of rotors. Factory semi-metallic pads screwed up the rotors even
before tha pads were worn out, and generally the pads came apart with
lots of lining thickness left (live in the "salt belt) in less than 2
years. They would be so badly pitted they were beyond turning.

When I was with Toyota in the seventies and eighties, they went from
asbestos pads to semi metalic with brass, and then to a sintered pad
that was high in iron. (the pads stuck to a magnet almost as well from
the lining side as from the back). Then we started having rotor
problems in a BIG way. I ALWAYS replaced with the brass formulated
pads if they were available to fit the vehicle (all Corollas, most
Celicas and some others at the time)and the customers thanked me.
Eventually the brass formula pads were no longer available - and by
that time I had left the dealership.

As for "organic" pads, you may as well put on a chunk of Masonite, or
use the box they came in - you'd get almost the same life (well,
that's stretching it a BIT, but). I won't even put them on a car I'm
getting rid of just to pass the safety check.
