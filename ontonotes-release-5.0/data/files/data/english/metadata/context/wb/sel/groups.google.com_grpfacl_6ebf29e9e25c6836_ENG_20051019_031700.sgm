Dear Sandy and all

Nice article, perhaps it could go into the Global FlipChart?

I think this discussion is an important one. We find we are asked to facilitate in four kinds of situations: when a &quot;neutral&quot; party is needed, when the group is large say a couple hundred people, when everyone wants to contribute to the content of the meeting and when the manager knows they have a hard time keeping on track.

Your 8 points are:

1. Distrust or bias
We get this some but usually to avoid distrust or bias rather than dealing with it.

2. Intimidation
We never have this problem as a reason for hiring us. We run into it often but in the sessions.

3. Rivalry
Same as 2.

4. Problem definition
This is some thing we work on in the process of developing the program.

5. Human limits
This is quite common for us. The last group I facilitated was meeting for the first time even though they were two years old. They were in three locations; two in Europe and one in the US. They had a difficult time keeping on track, as there were tons of baggage that kept comming up. Some was very important and so we had to create time to do it.

6. Complexity or novelty
I had a really interesting one about electro-magnetic sensing methods for oil. No one in the room knew all of the field and so it took a day of presentations to get everyting on the table.

7. Timeliness
See the example in 5.

8. Cost
One of the surprising things recently was to discover that our prices, EUR 1300.00 per day were about a 1000.00 euros less than internal facilitators in one of our clients.

Please see below some thoughts on when to use an outside/
impartial facilitator rather than an in-house facilitator.

Do You Need an Outside Facilitator?

Sandor P. Schuman

While a group member can effectively perform the role of
facilitator in many situations, it is often preferable to use a
facilitator who is not a group member. This might best be an in
house facilitator who is not associated with the group's work; in
some cases it is valuable to hire an independent facilitator.
Determining the need for an outside facilitator can be aided by
examining the group's condition using the following criteria (see
Figure 1).

1. Distrust or bias

In situations where distrust or bias is apparent or suspected,
groups should make use of an un-biased outsider to facilitate
(and perhaps convene) the group.

The individual whose job is to manage the process -- typically
the chairperson or team leader -- has an enormous influence on
the process and, consequently, the outcome. This person's choice
of participants, analytical methods, and methods of social
interaction influences the group effort at a fundamental level.
Because of this, group members might view this leader as biased
-- steering the process in some way to promote his or her own
agenda. True or not, this perception can greatly hinder the
process.

2. Intimidation

The presence of an outside facilitator can encourage the
participation of individuals who might otherwise feel
intimidated.

Where participants are of disparate educational, social or
economic status; are at different hierarchical levels; or are in
other types of control relationships (such as purchaser-supplier
or client-provider) some group members might feel intimidated and
not participate. The presence of a facilitator can give
participants someone of neutral status to whom they can direct
their comments without fear. The facilitator is in a legitimate
position to elicit information from the group as a whole, as well
as from specific individuals who are not forthcoming. In
particularly tense circumstances, the facilitator might choose to
elicit information anonymously.

3. Rivalry

Rivalries between individuals and organizations can be mitigated
by the presence of an outside facilitator.

Participants are typically reluctant to reveal personal rivalries
or attack one another in the presence of an outsider. (Perhaps
they realize that their claims might not appear valid to an
outsider, and so do not even raise them. Participants are often
surprised at how polite they are to each other.) But, if
rivalries do surface, a facilitator can determine if they are
relevant to the task at hand. If they are not, the facilitator
will refocus the group on its stated purpose. If they are
relevant, the facilitator will ask the group to understand them
as part of the the issues to be addressed.

4. Problem definition

If the problem is poorly defined, or defined differently by
multiple parties, an unbiased listener and analyst can help to
construct an integrated, shared understanding of the problem.

When a group represents disparate views, members are often more
concerned with having their point of view understood by others,
than understanding others' views. An unbiased party, one who
does not advocate any particular position and whose role is to
listen to, analyze, and integrate everyone's views, is a valuable
asset to such a group.

5. Human limits

Bringing in a facilitator to lead the group process lets members
focus on the problem at hand, which can lead to better results.

In difficult situations, working with the breadth of issues and
volumes of important information is demanding enough; it is too
much to expect anyone to also manage the processes that come into
play in a meeting. Human cognitive capabilities are not great
enough. Running a meeting, and participating in a meeting, are
each sufficiently demanding to warrant having the facilitator
focus on the former, and the group on the latter.

6. Complexity or novelty

In a complex or novel situation, a process expert can help the
group do a better job of working together intellectually to solve
the problem.

Process expertise requires judgment, practical skills, and
in-depth knowledge of problem solving and decision making.
According to David Korten, &quot;The capacity to manage social
learning is itself a form of social knowledge.&quot; Most groups have
developed their own expertise for addressing ordinary problems or
making repeat decisions. When approaching an unusual situation,
however, a group can benefit from an expert for whom this
particular problem-solving situation is familiar.

7. Timeliness

If a timely decision is required, as in a crisis situation, the
use of a facilitator can speed the group's work.

If participants have to make process decisions as a group, they
take valuable time away from addressing substantive issues.
Unlike parliamentary procedure, for which there are prescribed
rules which address nearly every procedural issue that a
decision-making group can encounter, there is no rule book for
collaboration. Instead of making up the rules as they go along,
groups can adopt the rules of a process expert. The expert acts
as a group process parliamentarian -- choosing which rules to
apply, explaining them as needed, and steering the group through
the process.

8. Cost

A facilitator can help the group reduce the cost of meeting -- a
significant barrier to collaboration.

Participants might be reluctant to attend meetings because of
competing demands on their time, doubts about the amount of
progress they will be able to make, or travel costs. By making
each meeting more efficient and productive, a facilitator can
reduce the overall cost in terms of participants' time. Because
more is accomplished at each meeting, the total number of
meetings might be reduced.
