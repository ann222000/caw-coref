I was just at Best Buy and one of the sales people told me that the Sony
XBR4 has &quot;120 megahertz&quot; refresh rate.

Sony really leads the competition in this regard, eh?

Gosh and that's for only half of the pixels on the screen.  If he/she
had counted them all it would be somewhere near 240Mhz.

It's so great to know that Best Buy hires such technically savvy talent.

Were do they find these guys -- diving in the Wendy's dumpster?

On the other hand would you expect the guy who hands you your Whopper to know
how the meat was processed? As long as you don't expect these sales staff to
be anything more than box shifters you can't go wrong IMHO.

??  He wasn't wondering whether runs at 120MHz refresh rate, he
already knows that it doesn't.  The important word here is &quot;mega&quot;.

Lighten up folks. We're all so used to putting prefixes like mega- and giga-
in front of our Hz, it could have been just a harmless brain fart.

Next time you're in a BB or similar store, just hang around and watch the
salesmen at work, and ask yourself who's dumber - the salesman or the
customer. You must have a friend somewhere who's in the business of selling
something. Ask them about their job. They'll tell you lots of stories about
customers who string them along for hours, pumping them for information,
trying to get something for nothing, and then buy elsewhere.

One is about as likely to receive incorrect information at a high-end store
that sells everything at list price. Is that what you want--to pay list
price?

Anyway, as has been pointed out, the information provided was &quot;relatively&quot;
correct (twice the frame rate as a regular 60 Hz set). Only the super-nerds
on this forum really care about the details.

Check the December issue of Home Theater.  None of the 120Hz sets came off
very well.  Seems to be a good idea that hasn't been well implemented yet.

I have not read the Nov issue, but I copied and pasted this straight from
the Home Theatre home page:

&quot;Why We Like It: This XBR4 flat panel features the best blacks we've seen
from LCD, and a very sophisticated 120Hz video processing technology that
not only reduces motion smear, but also eliminates motion artifacts. The
1080P resolution is oustanding. Pricey for a 46&quot; flat panel, but it performs
like it should for extra scratch!&quot;

They are not alone.  I've seen similar blunders from Circuit City, both
online and in the store.

I'd like to sue them for the fun of it, but I know damned well it would be
tossed out of court because it is so obviously an error (even if the droid
that typed it in really thought it truly was MHz) to anyone for which that
spec is important.  They are always going to have the grace of making dumb
errors.

Since the BestBuy sales person basically (and correctly) said the XBR4 can
achieve twice the scan rate as most other sets, he was basically correct. I
would be more worried about a sales person who didn't have any idea about
the difference in maximum scan rate between the XBR2/3 and XBR4/5.

Agree and, yes Sony &quot;Motionflow&quot; speeds and smooths out the correction
of motion artifacts.

Bottom line though is that this isn't 2007 technology.  JVC was doing it
in 2005 in their Pro series monitors.  That technology appeared in their
consumer product line in 2006.  Got it and like it.

So the sales person didn't make the MHz mistake.  OK.

Now I wonder who gets video at 120 Hz while I'm trying to find a display
that will work with video at 24 Hz.

The fraud concerning 120MHz is the claim by some set providers (Sony is not
the only supplier of 120MHz or 100MHz sets) that it eliminates the blur of
fast moving objects.

Actually, it was implemented for only one reason. If you start with a 24 fps
film source, you can display it on a 120MHz set without any need for
pull-down, to sync the 24 fps rate to a 60 cps scan rate. Blur of live 60
cps video has nothing to so with this feature.

You are mistaken.  The 24 fps film is transferred to a 30 frame rate
at the tiime of transistion to video storage medium, and that is the
rate at which it is broadcast.  The acquisition rate of 24fps is lost
at that time and it remains 30fps throughout the broadcast chain.

yes.
the films are stored on the disc as 24fps - and a decent player will output
them as such.
and a decent hdtv, will accept the signal and display them that way.

Actually, no.

The information is delivered at 24 frames per second.  To generate
60 FIELD per second video, the number of FIELDS is altenated between
3 and 2 per film frame, but the film informaion remains at 24 frames
per second.

Sets which generate interpolated frames at 120 Hz (NOT Mhz) do so in
an attempt to smooth the video presentation.  The ability to display
1080p24 video without motion judder is just an extra benefit.

I don't dispute that this happens (or it might be 60 fps).  But this is
certainly a wrong way to do it.  Ideally, it should remain in its native
form as far as possible, especially if it is 24 fps, and then by upscanned
as needed by the particular display device (for example 72 fps for CRTs).

Yes, a 120 MHz set would not need to do pull-down for a 24 fps video stream.
It would also not need to do pull-down for a 24,000,000 fps video stream, if
anyone were to accomplish such a video stream.

The problem here is that 120 MHz is not technically possible.  It's all a lie.
While I am sure the technology is capable of going above 120 Hz, I suspect the
units Best Buy was lying about are really just 120 Hz, not 120 MHz.

BTW, for LCD, you don't need 120 Hz to do 24 fps correctly.  You could vary
the frame update rate to match the incoming video exactly.  LCD does not
have a flicker issue.  CRT does, but there's no reason to go all the way to
120 Hz for CRT since 72 Hz will work for 24 fps video.  But if 60 Hz is too
low for the CRT for 60 fps video, then 120 Hz the obvious next choice and
works with 24 fps, too.  But that's for CRT.  LCD doesn't need this; it just
needs to adapt to whatever comes in (and I suspect that from other that a
computer, it will only be 24, 30, or 60 fps in North America unless one has
international player devices, and then you can also get 25 and 50 fps).

Do you know of any LCD monitor (no tuner needed) in the 20 to 24 inch size
range, that can accept 24 fps directly?  My computer can produce it, but
every LCD monitor I have tried cannot handle it (they all cut off just a
bit below 50 fps).  At this point I'm not going to buy any more LCD monitors
just because I hope they might work at 24 fps.  Sadly, no manufacturers are
giving the low end of the fps range they support in the specs, so finding
one that works is apparently going to be hard to do.  Obviously, asking the
sales people at the stores is a waste of time (I've actually tried that).

This would perform similar (regarding judder/stutter) as the
presentation we have in Europe, where film material are speeded 4% to
25Fps and displayed at 50 Fps.

It doesn't suffer the judder from 3:2 sequencing but it is surely
suffering from the low frame rate (that is the low update frequency of
the film content.)

How disturbing it is depends on the film makers (choise of exposure
time etc).

This is one reason for implementing motion estimated frame rate
upsampling. (The other reason is to reduce motion blur also in
TV/video material using 50 or 60Hz interlaced video.)

Some people apparently got used to the low frame rate stutter and say
that they miss the &quot;film feel&quot;.

I'm looking for LCD that can do 24 fps (actually anything from 24 to 72)
in the 19 inch to 24 inch size, with at least 1280x1024 native resolution.
Tuner is optional.  HDD-15 RGB analog input required, as is HDMI or DVI.
There are many units that meet these requirements except for the 24 fps
aspect which is unknown, except in the two computer monitors I have tested
which won't go below about 49.9 fps.

24 fps has a certain &quot;look and feel&quot; to it.  Some TV is shot it in to
give it that film &quot;feel&quot;.

I'm not sure if I care one way or the other.  I watch some of the interviews
on TCM that appear to be shot in 24 fps video (but it could be filmed, too).
It seems to mellow the whole thing and give it a &quot;non-live&quot; feel, which I do
not consider to be bad.  But maybe they are setting up to transmit everything
on that channel in 24 fps.  They could go 1080p24 and have a nice HD movie
channel ... if one likes how their display deals with it.

Europe's long time &quot;solution&quot; to playing 24 fps movies on a 50 Hz TV system

An exactly 2 hour (172800 frame) movie would play in 1 hour, 55 minutes, and

Here in the colonies we were stuck with 30 fps broadcast, and so had
to come up with a different solution.  We had a specially cut shutter
in the projector combined with an  intermittent movement designed to
show frames twice, then three times, to the camera.

After several cycles this worked out to a multiple of 24 and
everything came out even.  Except, that every few video frames part of
two consecutive film frames would be combined in a single video
frame.  This can be easily seen if you go through a film-to-video
transfer advancing a frame at a time.

The 25 fps solution is easier, but with the American method a middle C
remains middle C.  This is only important if you have perfect pitch, I
suppose.

I'm not disputing your statement that it can handle 24 fps directly.  But
the specs (PDF linked from the page you gave) don't say whether it can or
not.  It's just one of those things they don't seem to say anything about
it for any model (I'm looking around at LCDs since that's the type I want).
Oh, and yes, I have googled for things like &quot;24 fps&quot; or &quot;24 hz&quot;, and even
froogled as well.  I've seen lots and lots of specs, and nothing tells me
one way or the other on this particular spec.

I have been bothered by the 4% speed increase because it changes the
pacing. In certain scenes, from certain directors (Hitchcock is a good
example) the pace can appear to ratchet up to the near comical when it
is supposed to be frenetic.

YMMV.

Each one is shown 'twice'.  Actually once, since the display is 50 fields/sec.

Indeed.  All flaws, and the best film presentations minimize many of these.
However, a sharp video presentation can blow film away for quality.

And with the switch from monochrome to color, the film had to be run at
24000/1001 fps to get the exact 3:2 pulldown in sync with the TV system.
So that 440 Hz audio dropped to 439.56(043956..) Hz.  You'd have to have
very good pitch to notice that (I actually can when switching back and
forth between those frequencies, but not when listening to one alone).
