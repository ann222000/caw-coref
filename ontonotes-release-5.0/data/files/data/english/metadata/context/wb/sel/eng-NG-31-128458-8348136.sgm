Athanos wanders the halls of Riverrun finding himself greatly
disturbed by recent events.  He finds himself torn by his admiration
of the beauty of Riverrun and the tumultuous feelings of his heart
over the declaration for the execution of Lady Melisandre Tyrell.

&quot;The sentence was too harsh....far harsher than necessary - especially
when the King had instructed us toward peace. How does sentencing to
death a head of house work towards peace?&quot; though Athanos to himself
as he rolled a small flower between his fingers. Slowly plucking off
petal after petal and watching them descend until they landed upon the
river's surface; then to ride upon the flows to where ever the petals
would eventually end.

Athanos continued to think to himself... &quot;Surely they were
disobedient. More out of naivety and foolishness - perhaps even fear.
Could anyone deny that their fears of Dornish invasion were not
justified?  But such did not necessitate the decision that was made.
Mercy could have been shown and mere censure meeted out. Summerhall
might have been neutral lands, regardless it was a strong defensive
position. Holding Summerhall provided protection to lands of three
houses. Baratheon and Targaryen lands as well as Tyrell.  While also
flanking the Boneway.  Holding Summerhall also ensured the protection
of its resources and production.  Holding Summerhall also provided a
fourth supply and access route for supporting Nightsong.  Aurellian
may not have military experience. But it is clear there was wisdom in
his decision of holding Summerhall.&quot;

He tossed the remainder of the flower into the river and started
flicking small pebbles on the wall into the river below; watching the
ripples form and pass away into the current.

&quot;We need unity at this time...not more death and dying.  We need more
leaders and more leadership not less.  Or there is no hope for peace
and no hope for Westeros.  The north will survive...if for no other
reason then we always due. Though in truth our lands produce less than
others, and our winters pose as much danger to enemy armies as do our
soldiers - probably more. And yet, I am unsure of what dangers lie in
the north. Westeros may find itself pressed by darkness from the south
and darkness from the north.  If such be the case, Westeros is
unlikely to survive.  And what do we do....we prick ourselves and
ensure that we bleed ourselves even without enemies. By all the dark
names we do this to ourselves.&quot; at that Athanos slams his fist upon
the wall. Sending spasms through his hand and forearm from the force
of the impact.

Athanos continued thinking in between periodic poundings of his fist
atop the wall. &quot;So now Aurellian Lannister is banished to the north.

endeavor to aide him in his duty to the wall. The wall can always use
another back and another sword. But I believe the kingdom is weakened
by this choice. And the Lady Melisandre Tyrell given death. Could the
regent not have at least shown some mercy and merely sentenced exile
with her husband, as he did for his mother? Perhaps I should have been
more open with him when he inquired where I stood. I believed him to
have been innocent albeit naive and foolish. However, his mother I
believe to bear great guilt. And I even stated this before the
tribunal - stating on a number of occasions that I believed Gherys
innocence. But how does one tell someone that while you believe their
innocence you believe their mother be damned - especially when said
individual stands in the position of the regency. So I tried to put
off from him. Perhaps this was a mistake - Gherys is left with little
support and likely views nearly everyone as antagonists.  And because
of this he continues to stir up hornets nests. Though he must have
caught wind of something. Why else would he have exiled his mother.
Not an easy thing for a man to do.&quot;

Athanos sighed...breathing deeply to contain his frustration.  &quot;I
should be satisfied that she at least received exile, to that I will
give the regent credit.  With the main witness against her so
conveniently killed before he could testify. How convenient.  There is
a closeness of coincidences that I dislike, alas, but cannot prove.
Her staunch support for shit who shall not be named and the
coincidence of her accuser's death. It comes across to me as more than
mere chance allows. And while that woman will reside in comfort for
the rest of her days Lady Melisandre will be executed for a far more
minor travesty.  A failure to move her own troops as opposed to the
blackmail of a regent and possible collusion with agents of darkness.
I do not see the justic in this...WHERE IS THE JUSTICE!!!!&quot; shouted
Athanos as he looked upward to the stars.  The sun had merely been low
in the sky when he came out here in search of serenity.  Now it had
grown dark as the firefly that flit by so reminded him.

&quot;And of all the things that boils my blood, the one that hangs the
heaviest upon me is the fact that I aided that demon - I acquired the
book of ancient knowledge and we gave it right to him.  I know I was
simply endeavoring to do my duty. Investigating and providing
information to the one appointed by the regency as witch-hunter to
hunt down the sorcerer who has been slaying us all. Thousands dead in
Lannister lands....there is not enough of him to avenge their deaths.
But burn it all....I will see that man dead - this I vow! Do you hear
that you deer fornicator! WE WILL SEE YOUR END!!!!&quot; screamed Athanos
as he slamed his fist against the wall and weeped most bitterly. The
numbness of his hand hid the pain that the blood stain on the wall did
not.

&quot;And to the untold thousands dead at his hand - unwittingly aided by
my own....'forgive me' he whispered softly.

Slighty tangential but connected fic.  Safe for work, no naughty stuff this
time, just unadulterated angst.  (Fear not, however, STs and David, the
naughty Isa fic is still in the works, as promised!)

Jamie Lynn
AKA Isa Stark
over.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Isa uncurled herself from the base of the Heart Tree.  A root dug into her
back, but to her it was like a caress.  The Heart Tree was the only part of
the Godswood she and the others had managed to free from the grip of the
shadow, and Isa often spent her nights curled up  at it's base, as if her
fragile body could protect it from the threat of shadows.

Everything was gone.  The Godswood was all she had left and even that was
being taken from her by his damned shadows.  She clung to that last
Weirwood, with it's drooping maw and red weeping eyes, like a lover; it was
HERS and no one was going to take it away from her.

Like they'd taken her grandfather.  And her father.  And her brother in law
and his wife.  Even her cousin Brandon, once a close friend, was gone from
her, seduced by the power of his dark magic into unspeakable trespasses.
Her own husband, once her best friend and loyal confidant, was now lost in
prayer when he was not away on holy quests, and had no time for her at all.

Ignored by her married family, maligned in court, and utterly friendless,
Isa had gone home, and there found everything different as well.

Except the Heart Tree.

Winterfell didn't need her anymore.  A'tanos had the management of the keep
and the lands well in hand and the lords and people were already used to
working with him.  He was a good man, and extremely capable.

Isa leaned against the Heart Tree and put her head in her hands.  Would he
be so kind to her if he knew how badly she had erred?  Her foolish crush on
Marcus had blinded her to all the signs of his sorcery.  His kindness, which
she had once valued so highly, now only proved her a simple minded fool.  He
asked her for help and she had jumped at the chance to do anything for him,
anything.  She wept when she thought of the horrible things she did that had
only granted him more power in his dark arts.

And Brandon, whose claim on the North seemed so threatening until A'Tanos
took the matter in hand and gathered the Lords in consensus, had become her
enemy because she had once again turned a blind eye on something evil for
the sake of friendship and family.  She had known about his strange powers
and kept his secret for many years.  She even suppported his quest to travel
beyond the wall and learn more about what strange powers had him in their
grips. . .all to no avail.  No sooner was Brandon named Stark than her
father was killed by Direwolves, the very beasts Brandon controlled.  His
claim to the Stark lands was not long to follow.  He had obviously been
tainted by the dark sorceries from the beginning, but she was too naive and
trusting to see it.

What other follies had her desire for love and friendship led her into?  She
was afraid to find out.

So Isa Stark hid at Winterfell.  She became the ghost of the keep, drifting
from one place to another with little sense of purpose or direction.
Occasionally she consulted with A'Tanos on the matters currently embroiling
the realm, but most of the time he was occupied capably fulfilling his
duties as Lord Protector of Winterfell.

There had been one time she was afraid he'd surrendered to the madness his
brothers claimed he inherited.  At Riverrun, after the trials, she'd found
him weeping, bloodying his hand on a wall, ranting to himself about justice
and revenge.  Isa stepped back and covered her mouth to smother a small cry.
The whole situation was her fault, and she'd driven a good man to madness.

&quot;A'Tanos. . .&quot; she said, stepping closer to the weeping man.

He turned a tear streaked face her way, contorted in anger and sadness.

Isa took his hand.  &quot;Your hand,&quot; she said, uncertain what else to say.

A'Tanos looked at his bloodied hand like it was a stranger to his body, like
he couldn't feel it at all.  Finally, he spoke.  &quot;That wasn't justice, Isa.
This whole thing is madness.&quot;

&quot;No, there is no justice here,&quot; Isa said, &quot;the Lords are cowards, and the
Regent is a fool.&quot;  Like me, she thought, and her heart went out to Gherys,
who had also been betrayed, who must also be feeling the fool for trusting
unwisely.  He had not known Marcus was a sorcerer, or that the Dornish would
continue their invasion into Westeros.  Neither did he know of Brandon's
sorcery, and Isa did not know how to tell him; she was the last person he
wanted to speak to right now, and he certainly was not in the mood for more
accusations.

&quot;The only way to find Justice is to seek it ourselves,&quot; Isa continued, then
softened and fought off tears.  &quot;I am so sorry for dragging you into Marcus'
horrible games, but I swear to you, A'Tanos, friend, that I will make things
right!&quot;  Isa kissed the wound on his hand and let it go.

&quot;We will make things right, m'Lady.  Alone if we must, together if we can;
but we certainly must if no one else will.&quot;  And suddenly he didn't seem
mad, only sad and determined, like a warrior who knows he is going to his
death, but fights on.

Isa burst into tears and he put his arms around her and led her to a bench,
where he began to whisper his plans into her ears.  Isa listened, mostly,
when she was not lost in self immolation for her own follies.

When she looked down at her hands she noticed that they were once again
covered in blood.

OOC: Just a few snippets I felt inspired to write.
-----

The world was spinning, and Aeyra felt as if she could not draw breath.  Alone, she stood in the antechamber outside the Hall, watching the Lords and their trusted men come and go.  Her skin prickled, and her entire body was filled with a fire that she could not remember ever having felt before.  Her hand throbbed, a brighter spot of pain in a sea of weariness.  She curled it against her side, hoping that it would not draw any attention from passers-by.  Fear not, she told herself, hollowly, they will look only at your face, and forget the wounds.

Few met her gaze, and even fewer offered her any solace.  The kind looks she might have craved were shuttered away behind grim expressions and angrily furrowed brows.  Her Lord Husband was nowhere to be seen.  Likely, he still stood in the Hall, gruffly addressing the ramifications of Marcus and Trystane’s sorcerous departure.

The moment she had dreaded had come and gone, and in the wake of it, she felt curiously empty.  The emotion that had propelled her, the fire that had moved her to speak of the horrors she had seen—now they had left her scoured.  She had never felt this way, so she had nothing to compare it to.  She was too tired to stand up straight and call upon the timeless strength of Targaryen blood; tonight she was less a Dragon and more a sleep-walker.  Moving through life without any concept of where she might end up.

Her eyes, amethyst reflections of loss, skimmed over the people leaving the Hall in knots, whispering and speaking in urgent council.  She looked for the fact of her Lord, and still she did not see him.  With her good hand, she gripped at the wall behind her, willing it to keep her upright where her legs threatened to fail her.

“You killed my son…” she heard herself say in the vaults of her mind.  The Lords of Westeros knew now.  Oh, certainly. The septons, the attendants, all of them.  And all she could see was the hateful face of Marcus Martel, and his slavishly devoted kinsman.  Even her own family, whose alliances and promises to the Dornish made them blind to her plight…even they had spoken in his defense.

All the strength of silence, all the judicious choices she had made to keep her Lord and family safe…now, they were no more than dry grass.  She had kept her counsel, sharing her insights with only those she felt Caemon would trust—those who would understand that the blood of the Dragons left its mark on her family, and that she was not a servant of darkness.  She stood tall and supported her Lord when she saw eyes shifting, watching her with wariness, thinking she might be the sorcerer.  She, herself.

Despite having been attacked, despite losing her son before he ever drew breath…despite her fears for her daughter and the young King…still, they thought she might be the one bringing ruin to the Lords of Westeros.  And that was a kind of pain no words could describe.

She had been ready to do what needed to be done.  After seeing the slaughter at the Crag, and hearing the twisted chanting of the sorcerer as the common folk were slain one by one, she knew that she had no time left.  If something wasn’t done, she, or Caemon, or her child—would be next.  And she would not let that happen.  By all the power in her blood, by the fire of Dragons, she would not stand idly by while Lords bickered and ladies lied.

Damn Guest Right, she thought savagely.  Damn honor.  She closed her eyes briefly, bitterly.  She had been ready to kill, to save Jaenya.  But she had not.  She had held herself with as much dignity as she could muster, even when she wanted to take his mace and end it.  Even when her dragon glass daggers were cool against her skin and she watched Marcus and Trystane play their games of duality.

I do not even know where I am living anymore.  What is this place?  What was Westeros becoming?  She remembered her words to Trevel and to Caemon, when they turned away her insistence that something be done quickly—because the tribunal was too important.  More important than anything else.  More important than what remained of her family.

Marshall lay dying, blood cooling, down the hall.  And the tribunal was more important.  Poor Marshall, who had been kind to her while his younger brother had not.  The brother she had wed to cement alliances had been the only blight on Baratheon honor, and Marshall had found ways to ensure that he watched closely enough to keep her from too much harm.  He had ever heeded her, silently taking her counsel and never abusing her trust.  And now, he, too, had been gutted, his innards open to the air and befouled by darkness.

How many more have to die before it becomes important?

And now, now Marcus was gone.  And Trystane was gone.  And the answers were further away than ever.

Of course they’re gone.  Do you think for one instant that they did not plan it?

Everywhere she looked, she saw darkness.  Each time she stood in the wind on the battlements, she feared she would see it, like a shadow across the land, reaching to snuff the last sentinels of the light.  Where were the Ironmen?  Where had Kagon gone with his wildness and fervor?  Why had the Septons chosen only now to show up?  They had nearly lost their argument.  For a few moments, she had been horrified that even their charges of heresy would be dismissed.

Aurelian passed by, speaking with Adam in a hushed tone.  She watched with concern as Adam moved.  He should not be up and about; his wounds were far more grave than hers.  Yet he could not bear to stay still.  Lannisters—somehow they should be simple to unravel, but they were perplexing to her.  Lions were, however, fierce, and her respect for Adam had eclipsed any tentative concerns about Lannister promises.  Lannisters always pay their debts…

Suddenly, she sought out Ser Drustan.  He, too, had been pushing himself when he should have been allowing the Maesters to tend to him more thoroughly.  His honor and his love for Tully kept him upright with a kind of strength she had come to respect in the time she had been at Riverrun.  He had a core of something akin to fire, and for that, she was grateful.  When she found him, standing near one of the tapestries depicting a battle she could not identify, she was dimly relieved.  Go, go to bed…rest, she thought.  We will all need our strength.

At least she could bear it no more.  She slipped out to find Sarabel, whispering to her urgently.  “The children?”

“They are well and in bed, my Lady,” her serving girl said.  There was a tightness about her blue eyes that spoke of strain.  “I swear to you.”  How many times had she answered the same question tonight?

Aeyra was seized with a momentary urge to make certain.  To verify.  To keep vigil.  Perhaps it was time for her to make some other arrangements, to bring Jaenya and Aegon to the tower chamber where she and her husband slept.  Closer, for safety.  She took a breath and forced herself to remain as steady as she could.  She could not get swept away.  She could already imagine the expression on Caemon’s face as he told her she was going too far.  Even now, she wondered if she had shamed him so much that he would not speak to her.  Perhaps his honor would keep him from ever being close to her again…

No.  That was enough.  He was her Lord, and he had ever been a good husband.  That, she thought, is discrediting him too much.

“My Lady, you look unwell.  And have…you been crying?”  She immediately put a linen cloth, embroidered with filigreed dragons, into Aeyra’s good hand.  “You should come sit…wait for the punishments to be announced.”  She led Aeyra to a bench and put a pillow between her back and the stone of the wall.  It had a leaping trout on it, rust on a field of blue.  The little tassels, she noticed strangely, were in the shape of pennons.

She sat, with Sarabel perched nearby.

“I heard,” Sarabel whispered, when they were alone for a few moments.

Aeyra looked at her, uncomprehendingly.  “Heard what?”

“I heard you speak…from the anteroom.  I was preparing a tray with Morah and I heard you.”  Sarabel’s gaze searched hers, and Aeyra felt a chill argue with the fire in her blood.

“Was I loud?”

“No, Lady,” she shook her head.  “The door was slightly open.  I heard through the crack.”

“You should not listen at doors,” Aeyra said, closing her eyes.  “That will get you flogged one day.”

There was a pause.

“You were brave.”

Aeyra did not open her eyes.  She sat, willing herself to remain straight.

“What will they do now, the Lords?”  Sarabel whispered.  Aeyra could hear boots on stone, footsteps coming.  Their solitude was over.

When she opened her eyes, the world seemed suffused with shadows, and flickers of the restless dead darted out of her field of vision.  “Marshall,” she whispered, “I’m so sorry…I was not fast enough…”

The footfalls drew closer.  More than one set.

“My Lady?”  Sarabel’s voice was hardly audible.  She was already shrinking back to make herself less noticeable.

“I do not know what they will do, Sara,” she whispered, her own voice ragged and strange in her ears.  “I do not think they even know where to start…”

*

The wind was strong.  Aeyra felt it pulling at her, snapping her cloak and running greedy fingers through her silver-blonde hair.  It was an attack, but one she welcomed.  At her side, her daughter stood on tip-toes to see over the parapet.  Even the low point of the stone crenel was almost more than she could manage.  Her own silvery hair fluttered, caught in the wind like a banner.  It was the same color as her own, and it shone in the sunlight.  When

Very nice!

&gt; OOC: Just a few snippets I felt inspired to write.
&gt; -----

&gt; The world was spinning, and Aeyra felt as if she could not draw breath.
&gt; Alone, she stood in the antechamber outside the Hall, watching the Lords and
&gt; their trusted men come and go.  Her skin prickled, and her entire body was
&gt; filled with a fire that she could not remember ever having felt before.  Her
&gt; hand throbbed, a brighter spot of pain in a sea of weariness.  She curled it
&gt; against her side, hoping that it would not draw any attention from
&gt; passers-by.  Fear not, she told herself, hollowly, they will look only at
&gt; your face, and forget the wounds.

&gt; Few met her gaze, and even fewer offered her any solace.  The kind looks she
&gt; might have craved were shuttered away behind grim expressions and angrily
&gt; furrowed brows.  Her Lord Husband was nowhere to be seen.  Likely, he still
&gt; stood in the Hall, gruffly addressing the ramifications of Marcus and
&gt; Trystane's sorcerous departure.

&gt; The moment she had dreaded had come and gone, and in the wake of it, she
&gt; felt curiously empty.  The emotion that had propelled her, the fire that had
&gt; moved her to speak of the horrors she had seen--now they had left her
&gt; scoured.  She had never felt this way, so she had nothing to compare it to.
&gt; She was too tired to stand up straight and call upon the timeless strength
&gt; of Targaryen blood; tonight she was less a Dragon and more a sleep-walker.
&gt; Moving through life without any concept of where she might end up.

&gt; Her eyes, amethyst reflections of loss, skimmed over the people leaving the
&gt; Hall in knots, whispering and speaking in urgent council.  She looked for
&gt; the fact of her Lord, and still she did not see him.  With her good hand,
&gt; she gripped at the wall behind her, willing it to keep her upright where her
&gt; legs threatened to fail her.

&gt; &quot;You killed my son...&quot; she heard herself say in the vaults of her mind.  The
&gt; Lords of Westeros knew now.  Oh, certainly. The septons, the attendants, all
&gt; of them.  And all she could see was the hateful face of Marcus Martel, and
&gt; his slavishly devoted kinsman.  Even her own family, whose alliances and
&gt; promises to the Dornish made them blind to her plight...even they had spoken
&gt; in his defense.

&gt; All the strength of silence, all the judicious choices she had made to keep
&gt; her Lord and family safe...now, they were no more than dry grass.  She had
&gt; kept her counsel, sharing her insights with only those she felt Caemon would
&gt; trust--those who would understand that the blood of the Dragons left its
&gt; mark on her family, and that she was not a servant of darkness.  She stood
&gt; tall and supported her Lord when she saw eyes shifting, watching her with
&gt; wariness, thinking she might be the sorcerer.  She, herself.

&gt; Despite having been attacked, despite losing her son before he ever drew
&gt; breath...despite her fears for her daughter and the young King...still, they
&gt; thought she might be the one bringing ruin to the Lords of Westeros.  And
&gt; that was a kind of pain no words could describe.

&gt; She had been ready to do what needed to be done.  After seeing the slaughter
&gt; at the Crag, and hearing the twisted chanting of the sorcerer as the common
&gt; folk were slain one by one, she knew that she had no time left.  If
&gt; something wasn't done, she, or Caemon, or her child--would be next.  And she
&gt; would not let that happen.  By all the power in her blood, by the fire of
&gt; Dragons, she would not stand idly by while Lords bickered and ladies lied.

&gt; Damn Guest Right, she thought savagely.  Damn honor.  She closed her eyes
&gt; briefly, bitterly.  She had been ready to kill, to save Jaenya.  But she had
&gt; not.  She had held herself with as much dignity as she could muster, even
&gt; when she wanted to take his mace and end it.  Even when her dragon glass
&gt; daggers were cool against her skin and she watched Marcus and Trystane play
&gt; their games of duality.

&gt; I do not even know where I am living anymore.  What is this place?  What was
&gt; Westeros becoming?  She remembered her words to Trevel and to Caemon, when
&gt; they turned away her insistence that something be done quickly--because the
&gt; tribunal was too important.  More important than anything else.  More
&gt; important than what remained of her family.

&gt; Marshall lay dying, blood cooling, down the hall.  And the tribunal was more
&gt; important.  Poor Marshall, who had been kind to her while his younger
&gt; brother had not.  The brother she had wed to cement alliances had been the
&gt; only blight on Baratheon honor, and Marshall had found ways to ensure that
&gt; he watched closely enough to keep her from too much harm.  He had ever
&gt; heeded her, silently taking her counsel and never abusing her trust.  And
&gt; now, he, too, had been gutted, his innards open to the air and befouled by
&gt; darkness.

&gt; How many more have to die before it becomes important?

&gt; And now, now Marcus was gone.  And Trystane was gone.  And the answers were
&gt; further away than ever.

&gt; Of course they're gone.  Do you think for one instant that they did not plan
&gt; it?

&gt; Everywhere she looked, she saw darkness.  Each time she stood in the wind on
&gt; the battlements, she feared she would see it, like a shadow across the land,
&gt; reaching to snuff the last sentinels of the light.  Where were the Ironmen?
&gt; Where had Kagon gone with his wildness and fervor?  Why had the Septons
&gt; chosen only now to show up?  They had nearly lost their argument.  For a few
&gt; moments, she had been horrified that even their charges of heresy would be
&gt; dismissed.

&gt; Aurelian passed by, speaking with Adam in a hushed tone.  She watched with
&gt; concern as Adam moved.  He should not be up and about; his wounds were far
&gt; more grave than hers.  Yet he could not bear to stay still.
&gt; Lannisters--somehow they should be simple to unravel, but they were
&gt; perplexing to her.  Lions were, however, fierce, and her respect for Adam
&gt; had eclipsed any tentative concerns about Lannister promises.  Lannisters
&gt; always pay their debts...

&gt; Suddenly, she sought out Ser Drustan.  He, too, had been pushing himself
&gt; when he should have been allowing the Maesters to tend to him more
&gt; thoroughly.  His honor and his love for Tully kept him upright with a kind
&gt; of strength she had come to respect in the time she had been at Riverrun.
&gt; He had a core of something akin to fire, and for that, she was grateful.
&gt; When she found him, standing near one of the tapestries depicting a battle
&gt; she could not identify, she was dimly relieved.  Go, go to bed...rest, she
&gt; thought.  We will all need our strength.

&gt; At least she could bear it no more.  She slipped out to find Sarabel,
&gt; whispering to her urgently.  &quot;The children?&quot;

&gt; &quot;They are well and in bed, my Lady,&quot; her serving girl said.  There was a
&gt; tightness about her blue eyes that spoke of strain.  &quot;I swear to you.&quot;  How
&gt; many times had she answered the same question tonight?

&gt; Aeyra was seized with a momentary urge to make certain.  To verify.  To keep
&gt; vigil.  Perhaps it was time for her to make some other arrangements, to
&gt; bring Jaenya and Aegon to the tower chamber where she and her husband slept.
&gt;  Closer, for safety.  She took a breath and forced herself to remain as
&gt; steady as she could.  She could not get swept away.  She could already

&gt; passers-by.  Fear not, she told herself, hollowly, they will look only at
&gt; your face, and forget the wounds.

&gt; Few met her gaze, and even fewer offered her any solace.  The kind looks she
&gt; might have craved were shuttered away behind grim expressions and angrily
&gt; furrowed brows.  Her Lord Husband was nowhere to be seen.  Likely, he still
&gt; stood in the Hall, gruffly addressing the ramifications of Marcus and
&gt; Trystane's sorcerous departure.

&gt; The moment she had dreaded had come and gone, and in the wake of it, she
&gt; felt curiously empty.  The emotion that had propelled her, the fire that had
&gt; moved her to speak of the horrors she had seen--now they had left her
&gt; scoured.  She had never felt this way, so she had nothing to compare it to.
&gt; She was too tired to stand up straight and call upon the timeless strength
&gt; of Targaryen blood; tonight she was less a Dragon and more a sleep-walker.
&gt; Moving through life without any concept of where she might end up.

&gt; Her eyes, amethyst reflections of loss, skimmed over the people leaving the
&gt; Hall in knots, whispering and speaking in urgent council.  She looked for
&gt; the fact of her Lord, and still she did not see him.  With her good hand,
&gt; she gripped at the wall behind her, willing it to keep her upright where her
&gt; legs threatened to fail her.

&gt; &quot;You killed my son...&quot; she heard herself say in the vaults of her mind.  The
&gt; Lords of Westeros knew now.  Oh, certainly. The septons, the attendants, all
&gt; of them.  And all she could see was the hateful face of Marcus Martel, and
&gt; his slavishly devoted kinsman.  Even her own family, whose alliances and
&gt; promises to the Dornish made them blind to her plight...even they had spoken
&gt; in his defense.

&gt; All the strength of silence, all the judicious choices she had made to keep
&gt; her Lord and family safe...now, they were no more than dry grass.  She had
&gt; kept her counsel, sharing her insights with only those she felt Caemon would
&gt; trust--those who would understand that the blood of the Dragons left its
&gt; mark on her family, and that she was not a servant of darkness.  She stood
&gt; tall and supported her Lord when she saw eyes shifting, watching her with
&gt; wariness, thinking she might be the sorcerer.  She, herself.

&gt; Despite having been attacked, despite losing her son before he ever drew
&gt; breath...despite her fears for her daughter and the young King...still, they
&gt; thought she might be the one bringing ruin to the Lords of Westeros.  And
&gt; that was a kind of pain no words could describe.

&gt; She had been ready to do what needed to be done.  After seeing the slaughter
&gt; at the Crag, and hearing the twisted chanting of the sorcerer as the common
&gt; folk were slain one by one, she knew that she had no time left.  If
&gt; something wasn't done, she, or Caemon, or her child--would be next.  And she
&gt; would not let that happen.  By all the power in her blood, by the fire of
&gt; Dragons, she would not stand idly by while Lords bickered and ladies lied.

&gt; Damn Guest Right, she thought savagely.  Damn honor.  She closed her eyes
&gt; briefly, bitterly.  She had been ready to kill, to save Jaenya.  But she had
&gt; not.  She had held herself with as much dignity as she could muster, even
&gt; when she wanted to take his mace and end it.  Even when her dragon glass
&gt; daggers were cool against her skin and she watched Marcus and Trystane play
&gt; their games of duality.

&gt; I do not even know where I am living anymore.  What is this place?  What was
&gt; Westeros becoming?  She remembered her words to Trevel and to Caemon, when
&gt; they turned away her insistence that something be done quickly--because the
&gt; tribunal was too important.  More important than anything else.  More
&gt; important than what remained of her family.

&gt; Marshall lay dying, blood cooling, down the hall.  And the tribunal was more
&gt; important.  Poor Marshall, who had been kind to her while his younger
&gt; brother had not.  The brother she had wed to cement alliances had been the
&gt; only blight on Baratheon honor, and Marshall had found ways to ensure that
&gt; he watched closely enough to keep her from too much harm.  He had ever
&gt; heeded her, silently taking her counsel and never abusing her trust.  And
&gt; now, he, too, had been gutted, his innards open to the air and befouled by
&gt; darkness.

&gt; How many more have to die before it becomes important?

&gt; And now, now Marcus was gone.  And Trystane was gone.  And the answers were
&gt; further away than ever.

&gt; Of course they're gone.  Do you think for one instant that they did not plan
&gt; it?

&gt; Everywhere she looked, she saw darkness.  Each time she stood in the wind on
&gt; the battlements, she feared she would see it, like a shadow across the land,
&gt; reaching to snuff the last sentinels of the light.  Where were the Ironmen?
&gt; Where had Kagon gone with his wildness and fervor?  Why had the Septons
&gt; chosen only now to show up?  They had nearly lost their argument.  For a few
&gt; moments, she had been horrified that even their charges of heresy would be
&gt; dismissed.

&gt; Aurelian passed by, speaking with Adam in a hushed tone.  She watched with
&gt; concern as Adam moved.  He should not be up and about; his wounds were far
&gt; more grave than hers.  Yet he could not bear to stay still.
&gt; Lannisters--somehow they should be simple to unravel, but they were
&gt; perplexing to her.  Lions were, however, fierce, and her respect for Adam
&gt; had eclipsed any tentative concerns about Lannister promises.  Lannisters
&gt; always pay their debts...

&gt; Suddenly, she sought out Ser Drustan.  He, too, had been pushing himself
&gt; when he should have been allowing the Maesters to tend to him more
&gt; thoroughly.  His honor and his love for Tully kept him upright with a kind
&gt; of strength she had come to respect in the time she had been at Riverrun.
&gt; He had a core of something akin to fire, and for that, she was grateful.
&gt; When she found him, standing near one of the tapestries depicting a battle
&gt; she could not identify, she was dimly relieved.  Go, go to bed...rest, she
&gt; thought.  We will all need our strength.

&gt; At least she could bear it no more.  She slipped out to find Sarabel,
&gt; whispering to her urgently.  &quot;The children?&quot;

&gt; &quot;They are well and in bed, my Lady,&quot; her serving girl said.  There was a
&gt; tightness about her blue eyes that spoke of strain.  &quot;I swear to you.&quot;  How
&gt; many times had she answered the same question tonight?

&gt; Aeyra was seized with a momentary urge to make certain.  To verify.  To keep
&gt; vigil.  Perhaps it was time for her to make some other arrangements, to
&gt; bring Jaenya and Aegon to the tower chamber where she and her husband slept.
&gt;  Closer, for safety.  She took a breath and forced herself to remain as
&gt; steady as she could.  She could not get swept away.  She could already
&gt; imagine the expression on Caemon's face as he told her she was going too
&gt; far.  Even now, she wondered if she had shamed him so much that he would not
&gt; speak to her.  Perhaps his honor would keep him from ever being close to her
&gt; again...

&gt; No.  That was enough.  He was her Lord, and he had ever been a good husband.
&gt;  That, she thought, is discrediting him too much.

&gt; &quot;My Lady, you look unwell.  And have...you been crying?&quot;  She immediately
&gt; put a linen cloth, embroidered with filigreed dragons, into Aeyra's good
&gt; hand.  &quot;You should come sit...wait for the punishments to be announced.&quot;
&gt; She led Aeyra to a bench and put a pillow between her back and the stone of
&gt; the wall.  It had a leaping trout on it, rust on a field of blue.  The
&gt; little tassels, she noticed strangely, were in the shape of pennons.

&gt; She sat, with Sarabel perched nearby.

&gt; &quot;I heard,&quot; Sarabel whispered, when they were alone for a few moments.

&gt; Aeyra looked at her, uncomprehendingly.  &quot;Heard what?&quot;

&gt; &quot;I heard you speak...from the anteroom.  I was preparing a tray with Morah
&gt; and I heard you.&quot;  Sarabel's gaze searched hers, and Aeyra felt a chill
&gt; argue with the fire in her blood.

&gt; &quot;Was I loud?&quot;

&gt; &quot;No, Lady,&quot; she shook her head.  &quot;The door was slightly open.  I heard
&gt; through the crack.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You should not listen at doors,&quot; Aeyra said, closing her eyes.  &quot;That will
&gt; get you flogged one day.&quot;

&gt; There was a pause.

&gt; &quot;You were brave.&quot;

&gt; Aeyra did not open her eyes.  She sat, willing herself to remain straight.

&gt; &quot;What will they do now, the Lords?&quot;  Sarabel whispered.  Aeyra could hear
&gt; boots on stone, footsteps coming.  Their solitude was over.

&gt; When she opened her eyes, the world seemed suffused with shadows, and
&gt; flickers of the restless dead darted out of her field of vision.
&gt; &quot;Marshall,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I'm so sorry...I was not fast enough...&quot;

&gt; The footfalls drew closer.  More than one set.

&gt; &quot;My Lady?&quot;  Sarabel's voice was hardly audible.  She was already shrinking
&gt; back to make herself less noticeable.

&gt; &quot;I do not know what they will do, Sara,&quot; she whispered, her own voice ragged
&gt; and strange in her ears.  &quot;I do not think they even know where to start...&quot;

&gt; The wind was strong.  Aeyra felt it pulling at her, snapping her cloak and
