See part 0 for header information.

&quot;Hands on your head, boy,&quot; someone behind him ordered.

Simon did as he was told, stinging raindrops blinding him.

&quot;Sarge won't like this at all, Crow.&quot;

&quot;He can take it up with the Commander. Let them fight it out. We'll take good
care of the pretty boy.&quot;

A rifle butt nudged him in the back, and Simon shivered uncontrollably in the
mud, glancing at Jayne's face as the big man stepped away. The mercenary
looked troubled, but made no more objections on his behalf.

Simon was hauled to his feet; arms bound by ropes behind his back, and lead
away, now a prisoner of war.

* * * * * * *

'Oh, diyu,' Jayne thought. Zoe was gonna kill him. And if she didn't, the
Sarge was likely to just as soon as he woke up.

Jayne hadn't taken much of liking to the doc when he'd first seen him. Too
clean. Too rich smelling. Too Alliance. But having the boy stand up for
himself when Jayne had wanted to muddy his face had earned a bit of Jayne's
respect. And seeing that pretty face looking back at him like a raccoon had
been worth the small show of defiance. Turned out the doc was good for a
laugh.

Standing there holding a lamp for the doc while he'd rummaged around peoples'
insides hadn't hurt either. Boy knew what he was doing, and had shed his
scared ways like a cloak when he worked, instead becoming sure of himself and
softly giving instructions to those helping out, and layering on gentle praise
where it would do the most good. Made people want to do as he asked.

Jayne had shifted off of lantern duty three times before Zoe had ordered him to
finally go back to pick up the boy and put him to bed. The 2IC had been right,
boy was dead on his feet. It was almost funny to watch him being so easily
led. Reminded him of a pretty toy his youngest sister had when she was just a
kid. You could flex its leg, elbows and knees, and the toy would stay in that
position. Doc, after twelve hours of surgery, was just like that. Push the
protein near his face and he suddenly remembered how to eat. Push him over,
and his eyes closed automatically. Just like the doll.

Now that he thought on it, seemed the doll's eyes were the same color as the
doc's, too.

And now he'd up and lost him. To Commander Early, of all people. How the hell
that liumang had found out about the doctor, Jayne didn't even want to guess.
Then again, there had been dozens of people in and out of the tent since last
night. Anyone could have told him.

The Commander and his chief henchman where two of the meanest hundans that it
had been Jayne's misfortune to meet.

And now they had the boy.

Jayne cursed the mud, and the rain, and officers in general, as he turned and
hurried out to find Zoe.

* * * * * * *

Commander Jubal Early looked down at the shivering surgeon tied to a chair
before him.

It didn't sit well with him that Reynolds' team had dragged this Alliance
doctor across enemy lines so that he could operate on their man. Didn't sit
well that the man had clamed up the minute they'd snatched him.

Early looked down at him and snorted. Doctor! The boy was barely more than a
child! But then again, so were most of their own soldiers.

&quot;Tell me about troop movements!&quot;

The young doctor merely shivered harder in response, eyes focused inward.

&quot;I want to know where they plan to hit us next!&quot;

The doctor sneezed.

The Commander stepped away, nodding to Crow. The sound of flesh hitting flesh
filled the room, and the Commander turned back, signaling his man away.

&quot;You can make it easy on yourself, Doctor. Are they planning on going north?&quot;

One eye swelling, and his bottom lip bleeding, the doctor swallowed hard. &quot;I
don't know anything. I'm just a doctor.&quot;

&quot;Surely the Alliance keeps their medical personnel informed and ready to move.
Have you been ordered to prepare for a change of location?&quot;

Early picked up a large knife off a nearby table, pointedly inspecting the
blade.

&quot;I don't know. I'd been in surgery for over twenty hours when your people
grabbed me. I can't even tell you how long I've been here.&quot;

Jubal grabbed a handful of the doctor's thick, dark hair and yanked backwards
until his slender neck was stretched. He leaned close, young frightened blue
eyes darting in his direction. The flat of the blade slid over the boy's cheek
until the tip hovered over one blue eye. A quick press forward and the boy
would easily lose an eye.

&quot;Then I really have no need of you, do I, Doctor?&quot;

The boy didn't respond, just gulping down his fear instead. &quot;I can't help
you,&quot; he said quietly.

Jubal released him, nicking the boy just under his eyebrow as he did, ignoring
the boy's small gasp. &quot;No, you can't,&quot; he responded thoughtfully.

The Commander looked over at his men, giving them a nod, then leaving the room.

Choked cries of pain chorused his exit.

* * * * * * *

Alliance Facility, Location Unknown:

This wasn't right. This wasn't part of the plan. Someone had bent the rules.

River Tam poured over the names of known Independent officers.

There. That's what she had missed.

But she could use this. Forge the bonds tighter.

Quickly she began scribbling notes, instructions and orders.

There was a rogue piece on the board and she'd have to maneuver around him.
The black king would have to come to the assistance of the white king.

Soon she'd have to move her own rogue piece into play.

* * * * * * *

Hera:

They dropped Simon into a pit of sorts. Surrounded by a circular cement walls,
a small grill above for light and air, and a metal grill for a floor. Below
the floor narrowed into an abbreviated cone, where bodily waste accumulated,
instead of a bathroom. The grill floor kept the prisoner from standing in his
own filth. The opening above was at least six feet over his head when
standing. The whole thing was buried into the ground with barely the
covergrill above the earth. Altogether, it was like a cylindrical coffin. A
smelly, cold, up-ended coffin.

The diameter inside barely allowed Simon to stretch out his legs while in a
seated position. Lying down and curled up on his side was more comfortable, or
he could stand upright. They'd taken his boots, so standing meant the
grillwork left impressions in the soles of his feet, and no boots meant his
feet were cold all the time. He wished he hadn't lost the blanket. Cold,
dirty, wet, tired, and sore. Simon had never been so miserable in his entire
life. His cold had gotten worse. He could feel it moving into his chest,
attacking his lungs, soon to be a full-blown case of pneumonia. His fever was
on the rise. They hadn't given him water in hours and he was starting to feel
the effects of dehydration, too. Sometimes it didn't pay to be a doctor,
cataloging each symptom and knowing what the next stage of illness would look
like.

He tried to focus on happier things. He and his sister, picking what they
thought were wild berries on the Camberson's estate, graduating in the top
three percent of his class from Medacad; trying to decipher the last cryptic
letter from his sister.

They had tried to keep in touch, but between the new Academy she was attending
on another world, and being in the trenches on Hera, mail call was sporadic at
best.

He was starting to get concerned about her. Her letters were getting stranger
and stranger. He'd even sent off a letter through the Cortex to his parents
expressing his concern. The letter he got back from them hadn't reassured him.
They had merely dismissed his concerns, sure that his sister was playing word
games at his expense. He was beginning to suspect that the letters were
encoded. With what, he didn't know. And he hadn't found a quiet moment to
figure it out.

Simon shifted position again, trying to get comfortable. His head was
pounding. He would rather have sat with his head on his knees, but the iron
grillwork dug into his butt, and if he scrunched up that much, his bruised ribs
ached and made him short of breath. He prayed he wouldn't have another
coughing fit. The last one nearly killed him.

A shadow passed overhead, and Simon glanced at the grill above his head,
anxious that another guard would amuse themselves by using the grillwork as a
latrine. Again.

As cold as it was, he wondered if he should wish for more rain or less. More
tended to fill the bottom of the cell, lifting the sewage closer, but it gave
him water to drink, or rather, moisture he could lick off the walls.

The shadow above turned into full darkness, and Simon heard the grill above
open with a clank and a curse.

Blinking into the darkness, he tried to scrunch back as a figure leapt down to
join him in the cell.

Shaking like a leaf, both from cold and from terror, Simon sat up and stared at
the man in front of him. The darkness and the small light that was attached to
the man's clothing, blinded Simon, obscuring the man's features. The figure's
hands reached for him, and Simon's jerked his own up defensively.

&quot;Hey, easy there, Doc. We just came to get you.&quot;

&quot;Jayne?&quot;

Simon had never felt so relieved to see an Independent soldier in his life.

Jayne hunkered down in front of him, and reached for him again.

Simon stared blearily at him, wondering if he'd been dehydrated enough to have
hallucinations, then wondering why he would be hallucinating about the big
mercenary. He would have shook his head to clear it, but each time he did, it
made him dizzy.

Above them a voice urged Jayne to 'get the hell on with it', making Simon
wonder what 'it' was. Were they here to get him out, or to kill him?

If they wanted him dead, all they had to do was leave him where he was. This
place was bound to kill him, and soon.

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Simon croaked.

&quot;Getting you the hell out. What did ya think? It's Visitin' Day?&quot;

Simon snorted despite himself, causing a coughing fit that had him holding his
ribs in agony.

Finally able to catch his breath, he found himself on his feet, Jayne holding
his shoulders, keeping him standing.

&quot;You sound pretty bad, Doc.&quot;

Simon nodded wearily, not trusting himself to speak.

&quot;You two having a tea party down there?&quot; scolded a voice from above.

Jayne glanced up. &quot;He's pretty bad off, Sarge. He's sick. Don't think he'll
be able to run. And they took his boots.&quot;

&quot;Hoist him up and let's have a look at him. And hurry,&quot; the voice responded.

A rope dropped down to dangle between them and Jayne grabbed it.

&quot;Think you can climb up, Doc?&quot;

Simon held his left hand in front of him. &quot;They broke my fingers. I can't
grab it.&quot;

Jayne shined his light down onto Simon's hand, cursing quietly. They hadn't
broken all of his fingers, just the last three on his left. Giving the rope an
angry yank, Jayne called upward to give him more play.

Taking the extra rope, Jayne began to tie it around Simon's waist.

&quot;Ribs!&quot; Simon yelped quietly.

Jayne huffed in disgust, and quickly made a loop for Simon's foot. &quot;Step in,
and wrap your arms around the rope as best ya can.&quot;

Simon stepped on with one bare foot while Jayne steadied him, giving the rope
another vigorous yank, and telling those above to haul him up.

He cleared the opening and hands hauled on his arms, pulling him out the rest
of the way, and lowering him to the ground. He was wheezing by the time they
dropped the rope back down and got Jayne out.

He was picked up again, Tracy supporting him on one side and the blond with the
laughing eyes, Wash, on the other. Nearby lay the unconscious body of one of
his guards.

&quot;Let's get a move on, people!&quot;

Simon looked over at the voice and saw the man who he had recently done surgery
on. &quot;Hey, he's not supposed to be up yet,&quot; Simon wheezed, then coughed.

&quot;Told you,&quot; a feminine voice smugly called out to her commander. Zoe.

Beside him, Wash chuckled. &quot;It'll take more than a gaping chest wound to slow
down Mal, Doc. The man's too damn stubborn to die.&quot;

&quot;Too damn pretty, Wash,&quot; responded Mal's laughing voice, overhearing them. &quot;I
keep telling you, I'm just too damn pretty.&quot;

Simon could feel Wash's shoulders shake with a chuckle.

They barely let his feet touch the ground as they darted away, losing
themselves among the trenches again. For the life of him, Simon couldn't
figure out how either side kept track of their men, lost as they were in this
maze of dirt; like human-inhabited rabbit warrens.

Once thoroughly lost, they finally came to a bombed out building, and the squad
was signaled to stop. Breathlessly, Simon dropped down to the ground, holding
his ribs and gasping for air between choking coughs. A coat was draped over
his shoulders, and a hand rubbed soothing circles against his back until his
spasming lungs could be brought under control again. He looked up to find
Zoe's sympathetic dark eyes on him, where she'd taken Wash's place.

&quot;Ya okay, Doc?&quot;

Simon nodded shakily, and Wash handed him a canteen of water. Simon nearly
sucked it dry in one gulp before Zoe forced him to lower it and take smaller
sips.

The man he'd operated on hunched down in front of him, giving him an appraising
once over. &quot;You look worse than I do, Doc.&quot;

&quot;Y-you had better c-care,&quot; Simon shivered.

The man smiled in genuine amusement. &quot;I did at that.&quot; He stuck out his hand
to Simon. &quot;Sergeant Malcolm Reynolds. I'm right grateful for all ya
done.&quot;

Simon tentatively lifted his own right hand, feeling it grasped warmly, before
huddling back on himself.

Reynolds frowned at him, then glanced at Zoe. &quot;We'd best get those fingers
wrapped, Zoe.&quot; He turned away. &quot;Jayne, see if you can find the doc some
shoes. Socks, too.&quot; Reynolds turned and glanced back at the young man. &quot;In
fact, a whole new outfit if you can manage it.&quot;

&quot;I'll see what I can do, Mal. He is getting a bit ripe.&quot;

If his nose wasn't so stuffy, Simon might have noticed that for himself.

&quot;Take Tracy with you.&quot;

&quot;Sure thing, Sarge!&quot; Tracy acknowledged, a little too eagerly.

Simon shivered again, and Zoe directed him to slip his arms into the sleeves
and zip up the jacket. Zoe had Tracy find some small sticks before he left,
and she used them to brace his fingers, tying his broken fingers to them as
straight as she could.

She fished into her pockets and pulled out a couple of packets of medicine.
She opened them for him, then slipped them between his lips, afraid he would
drop them in the dirt before he could manage them with his broken fingers, or
shaking hands. She pressed the canteen into his hands again, and he washed
down the pills.

&quot;Sorry about all this, Doc. You did us a good turn and got treated like crap
for it. Didn't mean for that to happen.&quot;

Simon blinked tiredly at her. &quot;What happens now?&quot;

Reynolds was back, hunkering down in front of him. &quot;With a little of God's
good help, we're getting you back to your own side.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

With a straight face, Reynolds replied, &quot;Naw, Doc, we've decided to keep ya.&quot;

Off the doctor's wide-eyed look of horror, and desperate glance at Zoe,
Reynolds barked out a laugh. &quot;Just kidding. Get a little sleep, Doc. We'll
wake you when the supplies get here.&quot;

* * * * * * *

Alliance Facility, Location Unknown:

It was time to send a new player onto the field. Someone reliable.
Dependable. An old soldier.

The old one was careful. That's how he had lasted so long. Careful and
deserving of respect. He didn't have the flamboyance of younger men but he
knew how to get a job done; quietly and discreetly.

That's what River needed now. Discretion and skill.

* * * * * * *

Hera:

&quot;What do you want in return this time?&quot; Early demanded, glowering at the spy
standing before him.

Reynolds had snatched his pet doctor right out of the Commander's hands. Those
lazy guards were going to be made to pay for their incompetence. But not
nearly as much as Reynolds and the doctor would.

&quot;A transfer. I want off this rock.&quot;

Doable, Early nodded. And well worth it for the information. Besides, the
traitor would never see another sun. This man's army didn't need a soldier who
didn't respect his superiors.

&quot;Consider it done, son.&quot;

* * * * * * *

Simon woke to the smell of food cooking. He sat up sleepily, looking through
the flap at the cozy encampment that the squad had set up. Someone had erected
a small tent, and they had actually moved him into it while he slept. It was a
bit disconcerting to find that he had been moved unaware.

He had been covered again and left on a sleeping bag. A change of clothes had
been rounded up and a bucket of water and a towel had been left near the
opening.

He got up to wash and was half naked when Zoe slipped in the tent with him. He
gave a small yelp of surprise and pulled the towel in front of him, making her
chuckle at him.

&quot;Don't worry, Little One, your virtue is intact.&quot;

Outside the tent, he could hear Wash joining her laughter.

He gave her a mild glare and she just grinned unrepentantly at him, and held
out more pills.

&quot;I wanted to take a look at those ribs before you got dressed.&quot;

Giving up, he turned back to the bucket and awkwardly finished splashing water
over himself to get clean. She took the towel from him and guided him back to
the sleeping bag, making brisk work of drying off his back before handing it
back to him, then running a hand down his sides to gauge his injuries. The
bruises were dark, standing out stark against the pale skin.

&quot;They're not broken, just bruised,&quot; he told her, shivering as she skimmed
fingers over his back, raising gooseflesh.

&quot;Pretty nasty bruises, but you'll live.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Doctor,&quot; he replied sardonically.

&quot;Smart ass,&quot; she gave it right back at him. She held out the pills again, and
handed him a canteen.

He swallowed them, and she laid her hand against his forehead.

&quot;Fever's down,&quot; she informed him, and tossed him a shirt. &quot;How's the chest?&quot;

Simon experimentally took a deep breath, relieved to do so without falling into
a bout of coughing. He gave her a nod.

&quot;Get dressed. Dinner's almost ready. Jayne caught a rabbit.&quot; She left
without another word.

A rabbit? Out here? In the midst of a battleground? Hare must have had a
death wish.

By the time he emerged, he felt cleaner than he had been in days. Dressed in
clean clothes, and 'liberated' boots on his feet, surrounded by an overlarge
coat, he was starting to feel human again.

Wash waved him over to a spot near the cooking fire, handing him a plate of
stew as soon as he was seated. Around him sat most of the rest of the squad,
including the Sarge. Simon let their casual joking roll over him, feeling as
though they had somehow adopted him, like a stray puppy.

He found he was hungry, and couldn't bring himself to stop eating long enough
to answer any of the jokes or questions that were flung at him. He looked up
from his plate to see Reynolds eyeing him.

&quot;A mite hungry, Doc?&quot;

&quot;Afraid I haven't had anything solid in...&quot; Simon trailed off. &quot;How... how
long was I in...&quot; He paused again, not knowing how to describe his cell.

&quot;They call 'em The Vaults. No way in, no way out.&quot;

&quot;Is that where you keep all prisoners of war?&quot; Simon said with distaste,
shuddering when he remembered the atrocious conditions.

&quot;No,&quot; Reynolds mouth tightened. &quot;That's a little trick of that jackass
Commander that got his hands on ya. Sorry about that, Doc. You deserved
better.&quot;

Simon nodded, taking a hunk of bread that Wash passed to him. He nodded his
thanks to the man, and bite into it, swallowing before asking, &quot;Are you
planning on sending me back?&quot;

Reynolds nodded. &quot;Soon as we can figure out a way to get you through both our
lines and yours without both sides shooting our tails off. Figured we'd keep
heading south until we flank your side and let you wander back in.&quot;

&quot;I can't just go to the nearest security checkpoint and surrender myself to the
Alliance?&quot;

&quot;Most likely take a bullet for your troubles.&quot;

&quot;From your side or mine?&quot;

Reynolds smiled grimly. &quot;Both, probably.&quot;

Jayne passed over a flask, and Simon took a swig, immediately coughing as his
throat closed in protest.

Reynolds grinned and Jayne bellowed in laughter.

&quot;What the hell is that?&quot; Simon managed to gasp.

&quot;Got us a little girl in the motor pool named Kaylee what brews her own
rotgut,&quot; Reynolds supplied.

&quot;Fresh, eh?&quot; Jayne asked with a grin.

Simon coughed and shuddered. &quot;If by fresh, you mean: made an hour ago?&quot;

&quot;Purt near,&quot; Zoe answered.

&quot;Might consider saving this for surgery. It's sure to kill any germ that ever
thought about living,&quot; Simon replied, handing the flask back to Jayne amid the
easy laughter.

&quot;Speaking of surgery,&quot; Simon forged ahead, &quot;Want me to take a look at that?&quot; he
nodded in Reynolds direction.

The Sarge looked down at his chest. &quot;It's doing right fine, Doc. No need to
trouble yourself.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Simon deadpanned, and an ironic smile touching his lips, &quot;I came all
this way.&quot;

He could hear Jayne chuckle. &quot;Boy's got a point, Mal.&quot;

Reynolds rolled his eyes, but tipped his head toward the tent, getting to his
feet.

Simon followed him. The man didn't enter the small tent, merely stood beside
it and opened his shirt. Simon brushed the crucifix that hung around the
sergeant's neck aside, and took a peek behind the fresh bandage, seeing a clean
wound, nicely healing. His neat stitches stood out starkly black against the
tan skin, with no redness to indicate infection. He peered closely, taking a
sniff. Occasionally a wound would give off an odor if it were going septic.
And under these conditions, that was all too likely.

Reynolds caught his eye and gave him an odd look, but stood his ground,
amusement dancing in his eyes. Having thoroughly embarrassed himself, Simon
quickly explained what he was doing, replacing the bandage and taking
vitals.

Finally satisfied, he stepped away, indicating Reynolds could redress.
&quot;Someone's done a good job keeping it clean,&quot; Simon commented.

&quot;We've had more'n our fair share of battle scars. Not always lucky enough to
have a Core-trained, Alliance doctor nearby.&quot;

Simon conceded the point with a nod, stating, &quot;At least, not one you haven't
kidnapped.&quot;

Reynolds grinned. &quot;They are a loyal bunch, that's for sure.&quot;

Suddenly Simon was sideswiped by a yawn. Astonished at himself, he grumbled,
&quot;I just got up!&quot;

Reynolds laughed at him, and clapped him on the back, turning him back to the
fire. &quot;But how many days were you up before that?&quot;

Simon scrubbed at his eyes. &quot;I lost count.&quot;

&quot;Jayne said you were doing surgery in your sleep.&quot;

&quot;If I had, at least I would have gotten some shuteye.&quot;

Reynolds patted the front of his chest. &quot;This ain't the work of a sleepwalker,
Doc.&quot;

Simon yawned again as he took his seat next to Wash. &quot;Thank you, Sergeant.&quot;

******

After hearing the spy spill Reynolds plans to return the doctor, Commander
Jubal Early was furious.

That son of a bitch! Undermining his authority that way!

Jubal Early was going to make Mal Reynolds pay. It wouldn't be enough for them
just to interrogate Reynolds' pet doctor anymore. It was time for a more
permanent solution. With extreme prejudice!

* * * * * * *

Battlecruiser Blue Shield Orbiting Above Hera:

Colonel Book looked down at the instructions he'd just been given.

It seemed that the rebels had confiscated an Alliance doctor and he was being
tasked to bring the young man home.

Again that sense of shifting patterns crept up his spine. Book looked harder
at the flexi with the young man's picture on it, turning it over to read the
doctor's statistics. Nothing there gave him a clue as to why this boy should
be a part of the puzzle, but the feeling wouldn't leave.

Maybe when he got the young doctor back he would have to spend a little time
interrogating him. Somehow the young man was important to the outcome of the
war, but for the life of him, Book couldn't figure out how.

Plan made, Book nodded to himself, then called to his aide and began to plan a
rescue.

* * * * * * *

Hera:

Simon woke to the strangled light of dawn attempting to penetrate the clouds.
Blinking his eyes open, he realized his nose was pressed into a brawny back.
Looking down, there was a dark, feminine hand resting at his hip. Sitting up,
he realized that it was Jayne sleeping in front of him (his arms wrapped an
extremely large gun), and Zoe and Wash snuggled up behind. That explained why
he was so toasty. How the hell they'd all managed to fit in the tent was
beyond him. He didn't even remember falling asleep.

His movements woke Zoe, and at her muted grumbled, he looked down to see her
dark eyes peering up at him.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; he whispered an apology.

Sleepily she rubbed her eyes. &quot;Time to get up anyway, Doc.&quot;

Simon crawled for the opening, taking a moment to gauge the weather before
climbing to his feet. Inside the tent he could hear Zoe waking the others.
Simon took a deep breath of air and fell into a coughing fit. His lungs
weren't quite up to par yet. It finally subsided, and he sat down to pull on
his boots, spending a minute awkwardly lacing them up.

&quot;Morning, Doc!&quot; a voice greeted him, and he looked up to see Sergeant Reynolds
waving him over to the fire.

&quot;Sergeant,&quot; he responded, scratching at his hair, as he got to his feet again.

&quot;Mud fleas,&quot; Reynolds pointed out helpfully. &quot;Doesn't matter which side wins
the war, the mud fleas will triumph.&quot;

Simon grinned at him, and took a seat. &quot;You certainly don't seem to let the
conditions here get to you.&quot;

&quot;Been here before. Hera's a nasty wench when she wants to be. Don't take
kindly to unwelcome visitors.&quot;

&quot;Would that be your side or ours?&quot;

Reynolds smiled. &quot;After all the disaster inflicted, probably both.&quot;

Simon again noticed the cross dangle from the sergeant's neck as he leaned
forward to hand him a tin cup of hot coffee.

&quot;Seems strange to see a man like yourself still believing in God after all this
fighting,&quot; Simon commented.

&quot;Almost lost my faith six years ago, son, the last time we were here on Hera.&quot;

&quot;You were at the Battle of Serenity?&quot;

&quot;Yeppers. Thought we'd lost, seeing your side filling up the sky with ships.
We managed to pull an end run that day, straight for the serpent's head.
Scared 'em so bad they turned tail and run. God was with us that day.&quot;

&quot;Did you know the man who ordered the run? Harbatkin?&quot;

Reynolds' face brightened with a sly grin. &quot;Nobody's allowed to know who the
Hero of Serenity is, but we all know he didn't do it alone. Let's just say we
were too pretty to lose, Doc.&quot;

Simon shook his head and smiled despite himself. He admired the fact that the
Sergeant seemed to make the best of a bad situation. Everyone knew the war was
putting a terrible strain on both sides: physical, financial, and personal.

Simon scratched at mud fleas again, stretching his legs toward the fire, and
asked, &quot;What are you going to do after the war. Provided it ever ends.&quot;

Reynolds grinned at him. &quot;Plan to get me a ship and fly, and never kiss dirt
again.&quot; He tipped his cup at Wash and Zoe, as she joined Wash and took a seat.
&quot;Already got me a pilot and a first mate.&quot;

&quot;I wanna go,&quot; a voice added from nearby.

&quot;Sure, Jayne, you can come along. We could always use the muscle,&quot; Reynolds
called back.

&quot;Long as we don't let him cook,&quot; Wash complained, &quot;His culinary talents are
near to killing us all.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot;

Zoe rolled her eyes at Jayne.

&quot;Maybe we should send him over to the other side with the Doc. One prepared
meal from Jayne and they'd all be too busy in the latrine to fight,&quot; Wash
prodded.

&quot;You wanna go, Little Man?&quot; Jayne snarled.

&quot;As long as it's some place dry and carpeted,&quot; came the quick reply.

&quot;Amen to that,&quot; Reynolds chipped in.

&quot;Here here,&quot; added Simon, clinking tin cups with the sergeant.

&quot;What about you, Doc? What you going to do after the war?&quot; Reynolds asked.

&quot;Back to Capitol City Hospital on Osiris. Got a position waiting for me.
Going to try to catch up with my sister first.&quot;

&quot;Where's she?&quot; Zoe asked, stealing Wash's cup of coffee, and taking a sip.

&quot;She went away to the Academy just before I left. Haven't seen her in three
years.&quot;

&quot;Close?&quot; Wash inquired.

&quot;She's a brat, but brilliant,&quot; Simon said with a fond smile, staring down into
his cup.

&quot;Rumor has it the big wigs are gonna wrap up this party soon. Call it a draw
and let each side go its own way,&quot; Jayne said, taking a seat next to Reynolds
and reaching for the coffee.

&quot;It'd be nice to go home,&quot; Simon said wistfully.

&quot;Rich fella like you, probably already got his own estate and the like,&quot; Jayne
commented, reaching into his back pocket and pulling out some rabbit jerky for
his breakfast.

&quot;No,&quot; Simon grinned. &quot;Just a small apartment near the hospital. At least, I
used to. Most of my stuff is in storage.&quot;

&quot;Some don't got a home to go to no more,&quot; Jayne said, taking a guarded glace at
his sergeant.

&quot;Those ghosts are long buried, Jayne,&quot; Reynolds responded soberly. &quot;Best leave
them lay.&quot;

Zoe reached across Wash, and snagged Simon's cup from his hand. When he looked
up in surprise, she nudged a couple of pills into his hand. &quot;Heard you
coughing earlier. Wouldn't do to send you back too sick to operate on us the
next time we steal you.&quot;

&quot;Right. Wouldn't want that.&quot; Simon downed the pills and she handed him back
his cup.

Suddenly Reynolds radio crackled to life. Monty's voice boomed out, &quot;Sarge,
you got a patrol headed your way. It's Early's men.&quot;

Reynolds rose to his feet, clicking the mike open. &quot;Thanks, Monty. We'll take
care of it.&quot;

Turning to his people, he ordered, &quot;Jayne, douse the fire. Zoe, break down the
tent. Wash, get the gear stowed. Let's move it, people! And where the hell
is Tracy? He's supposed to be on guard duty.&quot;

The others raced off to follow order. Simon stood as well, eyes wide. &quot;What
do I do?&quot;

Reynolds made a grab for the back of his collar, and ran for the meager
protection of a burned out building, pulling Simon along with him. &quot;Keep down.
They ain't gettin' their hands on you this time.&quot;

&quot;He's a commander. Doesn't he outrank you?&quot;

&quot;Only if he catches me, son.&quot;

Simon found himself huddled behind a meager pile of fallen bricks, Sergeant
Reynolds by his side, sidearm out and ready.

Around them, he could see the rest of Reynolds' band, hiding among the rubble,
too. At a hand signal from the sergeant, they headed out, moving south,
swiftly and silently.

&quot;Reynolds, you traitor, you bring that Purplebelly in, and we'll see to it that
your people don't spend any time in the brig,&quot; a deep voice carried to
them.

Reynolds ignored the voice, pushing Simon ahead of him. When Simon's crouch
wasn't low enough, a shot clipped the stones around him, sending brick chips at
them. Reynolds hand landed on Simon's hair and pushed him lower.

&quot;Best keep your head down, Doc, iffn you want to keep it.&quot;

Simon smothered a cough and nodded.

Silently Reynolds pointed out Zoe's hiding place. &quot;I want you to head over
there. Stay low and Zoe'll get you home while we hold these boys off.&quot;

Simon nodded again, and as Reynolds popped up to deliver deadly cover fire,
Simon raced toward Zoe. He was halfway there when a grenade went off not a
dozen feet away from him, the concussion enough to knock him off his feet. He
landed in a small hollow, his ears ringing.

Blinking up at the sky, he lay stunned a moment, until a shadow loomed over
him. Zoe's mouth was open, yelling at him, but he couldn't hear anything above
the buzz. He gazed stupidly up at her for a split second before she was
tugging at his shoulder. Getting his mind working again, he rolled over,
letting her pull him to his knees and forward. They stumbled and dashed to her
former hiding place before she released him, letting him collapse against the
embankment. He was blinking dust out of eyes, when he saw her gaze flick
upwards, then she was pressing a piece of cloth to his head. He winched with
the pain, then his own hand covered hers.

He pulled the cloth down and saw it was bloody, then replaced it. She was
still talking to him, but he still couldn't hear anything, ears still ringing.
He thought her lips might have said, 'stay on my six', but he was only
guessing.

Clearly frustrated, Zoe jerked her head to the left and tugged on his jacket
again. Swallowing a wave of nausea and a splitting headache, he crouched and
followed her. They rounded a corner when the butt of a rifle lashed out and
caught Zoe on the chin. If she cried out, Simon couldn't hear her.
