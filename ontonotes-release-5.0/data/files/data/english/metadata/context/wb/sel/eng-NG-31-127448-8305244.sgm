&quot;Previous work in the laboratories of Cooke and Liebhaber found that
the hGH gene is controlled by a non-coding DNA region, or locus
control region. Remarkably, this region is located more than 14,000
base pairs away from the hGH gene. At the genomic level, a 14,000 base-
pair separation is equal to the size of 10 growth hormone genes lined
end to end. &quot;The effects of the locus control region on human growth
hormone expression is as if you turn a key in the lock of a house at
one end of your street, and find that this action opens the lock and
door of a house a block away,&quot; notes Liebhaber.&quot;

What's your point?

As far as I can tell, your argument is that because there are some
unexpected findings in human genetics, we should abandon science and
the scientific method in spite of its successes over the past few
centuries and revert to a pre-scientific paradigm which was rejected
because it is unfruitful.

Is this a reasonable summary of your position?

What are you trying to achieve with these unexplained quotes? Are you
trying to convince people of something? If so, what? I know you must
have some kind of agenda, but it's largely opaque. You are not achieving
your goal, unless your goal is to get us to wonder what you can possibly
be trying for. If this is supposed to be casting doubt on evolution,
then the applicability of the quotes may be crystal clear to you, but
other people will need explanations of where you think it all leads, and
why.

Your inability to articulate your points is almost certainly an application

What's unexpected? Finding a distantly acting regulatory element?
Looks like a case of acute press-releaseitis fooled Glenn. If only he
knew that cis-regulatory elements can be located HUNDREDS of kilobases
upstream, instead of a paltry 14 kb:

http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/17/1/82

Well, if only he knew what cis- and trans-regulatory elements were,
for that matter. Since the regulatory element in question was found to
be a transcribed RNA, why do they find it remarkable that it can act
at a distance?

Why would the mode of transcription be significant? &quot;Coding RNA&quot; is

Isn't that what's so great about science, questioning authority? But
first, you really should learn not to take press releases at face
value - I bet the &quot;two professors&quot; did not claim to have discovered
remote-acting regulation in 2006, since that would be silly. The novel
finding here was not &quot;remote control&quot; in gene regulation, it was the
mode of regulation.

Just to repost:
&quot;As far as I can tell, you are posting this to support your argument
is
that because there are some unexpected findings in human genetics, we
should abandon science and the scientific method in spite of its
successes over the past few centuries and revert to a pre-scientific
paradigm which was rejected because it is unfruitful.

Is this a reasonable summary of your position?

If not, perhaps you could explain what point you think this and the
other snippets you posted are making?

Of course, I know that as a creationist you are a moral and
intellectual coward, so I don't expect you to respond with a reasoned
answer. I'll just let your response, if any, support my statement that
creationists are moral and intellectual cowards.&quot;

Seems that my views are vindicated.

Yup. Some years ago Glenn claimed that birds flying (and even humans climbing stairs) defy the force of gravity.

that they are transcribed in exactly the same manner as any other RNAs.

You claim my question had no relevance, but are assuming what *is*

assumption of what was &quot;being discussed&quot;.
Now I've told you before my reasons for some posts. You appear to
either be oblivious to all or are just being dishonest. I don't see
any other alternative, John.
I asked Windy to explain transcription for a reason. You don't get to
decide what reason that was, is, or should be. It's as simple as that,
Kreskin.
You of all people should know that not all questions imply ignorance
of the answer, _John_.

whether you or any other evo in this group is over 21 and doesn't
think he knows it all.
Have you ever considered that I might *not* be sure I understand an
article, and may reserve arriving at a position or conclusion till I
heard from others their
understanding? You create some bullshit about my intent out of thin
air then accuse a lack of position as a tactic.. it goes on and on.
And *I'm* a troll?

You're simply wrong on every account above. I've created many threads
where posters have responded but not responded myself, or have
responded not in the way you describe. This is easy to verify, and I
expect you to have had ample opportunity to be aware of this. Yes, I
do troll occasionally, but frankly, motivated for the most part by
childish trolls such as yourself. I don't solicit these questions
about intent.

I couldn't care less what you or anyone else thinks of me or says
about me here, Chris. I know who I am, what I understand and what I
don't, and what my intent at any given moment is. It isn't yours or
Harshman's or from any other idiots here. It is quite discouraging to
think that you and others like you are involved in science.

I had no purpose other than to post an article interesting to me.
Whether &quot;remote control&quot; has been known for years or not is not, nor
is that a refutation of a nonexistent position. The thread did need
divining, though. I agree, and I have followed it around with a
shovel. You and &quot;Seppo&quot; have attempted to sling more to be shovelled,
or let drop on your heads. In your case, I have elected to let it drop
and fester on you for awhile. And I don't particularly care whether
others think the material that needs shovelling is gold. The ones that
do are covered in it as well. And they don't shine when the sun comes
out.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Probably because it is in a non-coding DNA region, if your referring
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to my cite.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;This mechanism involves a newly discovered set of &quot;non-coding RNAs&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;expressed in the vicinity of the hGH gene.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can help out here. How are non-coding RNAs transcribed?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why would the mode of transcription be significant? &quot;Coding RNA&quot; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;just a subset of all transcribed RNA.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That's true, but I didn't say anything about transcription being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;significant. I simply asked you a question.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Are you asking how RNA in general is transcribed, then?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Start here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics )

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wiki, huh. LOL! Good &quot;answer&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Good heavens. If you really don't know how RNA is transcribed, then
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wikipedia is as good a place to start as any, and you would be better
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;off spending your time there than scouring the internet for research
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;results you don't seem to understand too well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I haven't seen you demonstrate an understanding of much of anything.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Why do you continue to claim it seems I do not. Is it some little game
&gt;&gt;&gt;with you?

&gt;&gt;Possibly, Windy was picking up on the senselessness of your question
&gt;&gt;&quot;How are non-coding RNAs transcribed?&quot;. Well of coruse the answer is
&gt;&gt;that they are transcribed in exactly the same manner as any other RNAs.
&gt;&gt;The question has no relevance to anything being discussed, yet you
&gt;&gt;seemed to think it meant something. This suggests that you are not all
&gt;&gt;that clear on the meaning of either &quot;transcribed&quot; or &quot;coding&quot; or both.

&gt; Windy was &quot;picking up&quot; on something she imagined in her first words
&gt; about me in this post. You and she should make a good psychic team.
&gt; You claim my question had no relevance, but are assuming what *is*
&gt; &quot;being discussed&quot; as well as assuming I meant something in *your*
&gt; assumption of what was &quot;being discussed&quot;.
">

It's always necessary to make assumptions with you, because you provide
so few clues to what you're trying to talk about.

1st person: I'm not sure what you mean by that.
Normal person's response: Let me explain in greater detail or in
different words.
Glenn's response: You really understood what I meant. You're just
engaged in an international conspiracy to suppress the truth.

1st person: I think you meant x.
Normal person's response (a): Yes, that's what I meant.
Normal person's response (b): No, that's not what I meant. I meant y.
Glenn's reponse (b): You think you can assume what I meant, but you
can't assume that.

You didn't ask her to explain transcription. You asked her to explain
transcription of non-coding RNAs. This implies that you think there is
something different from transcription of coding RNAs going on there,

&gt;&gt;&gt;url to Wiki, and thanked me for calling you an expert. Now isn't that
&gt;&gt;&gt;about the extent of it, Windy?

&gt;&gt;No. You resort to argument from authority based on a press release from
&gt;&gt;people whose views on other subjects (notably evolution) you almost
&gt;&gt;certainly do not share, accuse Windy of ad hominem without giving a clue
&gt;&gt;what you meant by that, fail to answer any questions, don't understand
&gt;&gt;that a Wiki reference answered one of your own questions, and criticize
&gt;&gt;a soft answer to what was apparently intended to be a dig. That's the
&gt;&gt;extent.

&gt; Ah, you agree. Of course, it doesn't matter whether I share the views
&gt; of the article's authors, or provide the background for Windy's ad
&gt; hominem attacks, or fail to answer any questions, or whether a Wiki

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;This mechanism involves a newly discovered set of &quot;non-coding RNAs&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;expressed in the vicinity of the hGH gene.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can help out here. How are non-coding RNAs transcribed?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why would the mode of transcription be significant? &quot;Coding RNA&quot; is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;just a subset of all transcribed RNA.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That's true, but I didn't say anything about transcription being
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;significant. I simply asked you a question.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Are you asking how RNA in general is transcribed, then?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Start here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics )

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wiki, huh. LOL! Good &quot;answer&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Good heavens. If you really don't know how RNA is transcribed, then
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wikipedia is as good a place to start as any, and you would be better
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;off spending your time there than scouring the internet for research
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;results you don't seem to understand too well.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I haven't seen you demonstrate an understanding of much of anything.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Why do you continue to claim it seems I do not. Is it some little game
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;with you?

&gt; &gt;&gt;Possibly, Windy was picking up on the senselessness of your question
&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;How are non-coding RNAs transcribed?&quot;. Well of coruse the answer is
&gt; &gt;&gt;that they are transcribed in exactly the same manner as any other RNAs.
&gt; &gt;&gt;The question has no relevance to anything being discussed, yet you
&gt; &gt;&gt;seemed to think it meant something. This suggests that you are not all
&gt; &gt;&gt;that clear on the meaning of either &quot;transcribed&quot; or &quot;coding&quot; or both.

&gt; &gt; Windy was &quot;picking up&quot; on something she imagined in her first words
&gt; &gt; about me in this post. You and she should make a good psychic team.
&gt; &gt; You claim my question had no relevance, but are assuming what *is*
&gt; &gt; &quot;being discussed&quot; as well as assuming I meant something in *your*
&gt; &gt; assumption of what was &quot;being discussed&quot;.

&gt; It's always necessary to make assumptions with you, because you provide
&gt; so few clues to what you're trying to talk about.

&gt; 1st person: I'm not sure what you mean by that.
&gt; Normal person's response: Let me explain in greater detail or in
&gt; different words.
&gt; Glenn's response: You really understood what I meant. You're just
&gt; engaged in an international conspiracy to suppress the truth.

&gt; 1st person: I think you meant x.
&gt; Normal person's response (a): Yes, that's what I meant.
&gt; Normal person's response (b): No, that's not what I meant. I meant y.
&gt; Glenn's reponse (b): You think you can assume what I meant, but you
&gt; can't assume that.
">

You forgot the most common response of all, when Glenn has provided no
clue at all to indicate why he's posted something:

&quot;Moron!&quot;

I leave it to the reader to decide where that actually applies.

Well your inability to guess what Glenn's point was and rebut it
has convinced me that evolution is false! It's just a religion!
It's unfalsifiable! It violates the second law of thermowhatever!
It has been proven false! It's just an athiestic conspiracy!
Piltdown man! And Darwin recanted on his deathbed!

Obviously life was intelligently designed, even if Glenn's posts
are not.

I see no reason to suspect that the mechanism - as opposed to the
regulation - of transcription differs between mRNA (messenger RNA) and
other RNAs.
