Yes,

That's right people, Camel has popped his head out of his hole.  Like
the Meerkat, Camel has come out of his hole in search of bugs.  (Julie
- do you sense the Africa in what i am saying?)

So, coming up soon, Camel proposes the following:

1) Lou has been pestering me about climbing Mount Beerwah, so i was
thinking that Saturday, 2 weeks and 1 day from now, aka. the last
saturday of exam block, we spend the day climbing a mountain, and
swimming at the Sunshine Coast.

2) The last friday of exam block, aka. 2 weeks from now, we go to
Southbank and Salsa - but alot of us.  We get as many of us as
possible, and we enjoy the end of a long year!

3) A random dancing-type party somewhere random.  This should fall a
couple of weeks after exams when everybody is free of the shackles of
higher education and wishes to celebrate that!

Expect more later (possibly when i procrastinate next week!)

Notes:

Julie - Shortly after exam block we need to see a Travel Agent!  And
maybe enjoy a run, and some tea!

Brent - Have a baby with me damnit!

Hollie - Tell Brent to have a baby with me!

Diz - welcome to this group! tell me if you want me to put another
email address down instead of the one i pulled from the recruitment
group!

Lou - yes, i should be doing work, but i am on track to be finished by
this afternoon!

Nicole Jones - How are ya going Brandine? Long time no see!

Nicole Van - Look, i differentiated!

Teah - Don't drown!

Asela - I haven't been spending any time in the Biol library so you
haven't been stalking me.  Hope your vet exams aren't gonna be too
hectic!

Angel - I hope you are having a blast with those Japs (in a completely
de-derogatory way - i just wanted to say it!)  You are missed, and i
will be excited when you get to come back to UQ Dance when myself and
Andy are in power (evil laugh*)!

Andy - i miss meeting up for tea or coffee!

Markk - i hope all is well!  If it isn't, you know that Matt and I are
here like a Man-Bra (we provide support in just the right places to
make you perky, and prevent you from sagging - although, sometimes we
are annoying like the uncomfortable under wire of a bra that is a bit
worn!)  What i will say is this Markk: Sometimes you will ask what to
do in a situation, and people will give you a response.  Sometimes, it
is just best to trust in that niggling feeling you have about what to
do, if you don't have that niggling feeling, maybe then you can ask.
But always remember the best thing you can do is suited to the kind of
person you are.  If i was to make an observation, sometimes you don't
trust yourself as much as you could, or should.  Even if
inexperienced, you are most qualified to make any decisions.  You are
a caring and sensitive, man-ly, man.  You are in essence, the best of
man-ly men, and the best of the SNAG - so whatever is right for you
shouldn't come from a unique hippie vegetarian like me, or the
metroness of Matt, because we only represent half of you.  If you are
worried, you have every right to be.  If anything, it represents how
much you care, and how much it means to you.  Whatever the case,
remember that Matt and I are here for you, like a good Man-Bra should
be!

Eden - i await another day in which we can meet for some breaky and
coffee!

Lisa - when do you find out the results of the student election?

Well all, have a great day, week, month, and we shall all be together
soon, like a good troupe of baboons (the ladies flashing their bright
red arses around the places, and the men, chasing those red arses
around like there is no tomorrow - who am i kidding? That is nothing
like our group - Julie, i think i just wanted to make a reference to
Africa again!)

Camel. (hopefully soon to be an aussieinafr ... @msn.com again!)

I want a baby too!  My old friend Dee has a baby and it is a cutie.  Holly will have to look after this baby though.  She is good with the chickens.  The chickens scare me.  They are too fragile and I freak out when they are sick and all that.  I'd be a parent in years to come too scared to perform CPR as I might crush the ribs.  He he... I gave Holly CPR the other night when she was coughing... she laughed but not because it was funny, because I really was crushing her ribs and she couldn't talk to yell at me.  She is always yelling at me.  Reminds me of the time I was squeezing my fathers neck and he laughed so hard he had a really bad asthma attack and the harder I squeezed the more he would laugh and cough and the more I would find joy out of it and the harder I would squeeze.  My Mum stopped it eventually.
What?  YES!  I had a point I was sure.  Camel, Julie?  Africa?  Afrika? ARFRIKAR  You're not leaving me with a kid are you?

Mountain, activities... YES!  I'll come!  Julie/ Asela.  Hollies new chicken coops almost completed.  You must see!Also... ummmm... oh yeah.  Christmas eve/ day/ boxing day/ all of them I will be having people over.  If you want to be one of them express your interest.  Also... Holly and I just won tickets in the Big day out Ballot...  YAY!

Mountain - It actually looks like there's a possibility that I may be able to make it on the 17th to climb some mountains. It's not a definite, because it's only a few days after Penny is abck from India, and it's her birthday, and there's an Event that evening so I'd have to be back in Brisbane in time for that.

As for Southbank salsa in 2 weeks - that's the evening after our last exam for the year, and there are plans for Group 8 having dinner: I'll see what I can do about making said dinner happen at Southbank and dragging the group to Salsa for a bit.

Random dancing - always a good idea

Back to trying to learn everything about everything (that's what my exams are on)

Wow, so much has changed since this time last year. Camel's dancing
crew was smaller, more ERC-centric and less of an all-purpose social
hub; the upcoming UQ Dance committee was less awesome and FAR less
likely to convert every member to craziness with their newfound power;
'swing' was still associated with parks or sexuality as much as with
dancing; Beerwah was not a part of everybody's vocabulary; someone
playing 'Memory' on the piano would not make Lou sing and Camel scream
(did that today, yay!); and Angel still had curfews, a
parent-scheduled social life and an address in Australia.

But! Camel's sense of humour is still eccentric, especially when he is
procrastinating. Tea still keeps the world spinning around and around.
Friday-night salsa still sounds as wonderful as before; I wish I could
join everyone there but maybe photos will find their way onto Facebook
sometime. And an end-of-year party would be great! I mean, fine, I'll
make sadfaces because I can't be there, but Kangaroo Point last year
was so much fun.

Anyway, it's dinnertime so I'm off to whip up some culinary-type
concoctions which my roommate affectionately label as 'witch brews'.
Her opinion isn't really justified, I think. I mean, I haven't even
poisoned anyone... yet.

Good luck to everyone for the exam period!

I learnteded something!I can drink and get drunk and not throw up everywhere!  This can only mean one thing...  I am finally learning to relax.  Only things I can't do is navigate my way around dark houses. Most of today and last night was spent eating and drinking at Les's house.  Good times.  Drinks were on untill about 3 in the morning as we started watching &quot;Scarface&quot; at 1 or so.  There were people and my head really hurts.  I still feel kinda dizzy.  Very good evening.  Ahead of me now is another 2 parties tonight.  Sorry Nick that we can't make it to yours.

* It may be less ERC-centric, but is still just as eccentric.
** Everything is associated with sexuality in jacaranda season. Who are you kidding, Angel?
*** What did you do today - play Memory, make me sing, make Camel scream, or a combination of the above? If you believe in telepathy, it could quite conceivably have been all three, because I also sang and played Memory earlier today - perhaps we did so at exactly the same point in time - you never know. Both of us playing Memory at the same time on opposite sides of the world (kind of) would definitely make Camel scream if he knew about it.
**** Parent-oblivious, you mean.
***** His what???
****** Wonder why that was (wink, wink, nudge, nudge).

Camel's dancing&gt; crew was smaller, more ERC-centric* and less of an all-purpose social&gt; hub; the upcoming UQ Dance committee was less awesome and FAR less&gt; likely to convert every member to craziness with their newfound power;&gt; 'swing' was still associated with parks or sexuality** as much as with&gt; dancing; Beerwah was not a part of everybody's vocabulary; someone&gt; playing 'Memory' on the piano would not make Lou sing and Camel scream&gt; (did that today, yay!***); and Angel still had curfews, a&gt; parent-scheduled**** social life and an address in Australia.&gt; &gt; But! Camel's sense of humour***** is still eccentric, especially when he is&gt; procrastinating. Tea still keeps the world spinning around and around.&gt; Friday-night salsa still sounds as wonderful as before; I wish I could&gt; join everyone there but maybe photos will find their way onto Facebook&gt; sometime. And an end-of-year party would be great! I mean, fine, I'll&gt; make sadfaces because I can't be there, but Kangaroo Point last year&gt; was so much fun******.&gt; &gt; Anyway, it's dinnertime so I'm off to whip up some culinary-type&gt; concoctions which my roommate affectionately label as 'witch brews'.&gt; Her opinion isn't really justified, I think.

Like&gt; &gt; the Meerkat, Camel has come out of his hole in search of bugs. (Julie&gt; &gt; - do you sense the Africa in what i am saying?)&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So, coming up soon, Camel proposes the following:&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1) Lou has been pestering me about climbing Mount Beerwah, so i was&gt; &gt; thinking that Saturday, 2 weeks and 1 day from now, aka. the last&gt; &gt; saturday of exam block, we spend the day climbing a mountain, and&gt; &gt; swimming at the Sunshine Coast.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2) The last friday of exam block, aka. 2 weeks from now, we go to&gt; &gt; Southbank and Salsa - but alot of us. We get as many of us as&gt; &gt; possible, and we enjoy the end of a long year!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3) A random dancing-type party somewhere random. This should fall a&gt; &gt; couple of weeks after exams when everybody is free of the shackles of&gt; &gt; higher education and wishes to celebrate that!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Expect more later (possibly when i procrastinate next week!)&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Notes:&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Julie - Shortly after exam block we need to see a Travel Agent! And&gt; &gt; maybe enjoy a run, and some tea!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Brent - Have a baby with me damnit!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hollie - Tell Brent to have a baby with me!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Diz - welcome to this group! tell me if you want me to put another&gt; &gt; email address down instead of the one i pulled from the recruitment&gt; &gt; group!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Lou - yes, i should be doing work, but i am on track to be finished by&gt; &gt; this afternoon!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nicole Jones - How are ya going Brandine?

You are missed, and i&gt; &gt; will be excited when you get to come back to UQ Dance when myself and&gt; &gt; Andy are in power (evil laugh*)!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Andy - i miss meeting up for tea or coffee!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Markk - i hope all is well! If it isn't, you know that Matt and I are&gt; &gt; here like a Man-Bra (we provide support in just the right places to&gt; &gt; make you perky, and prevent you from sagging - although, sometimes we&gt; &gt; are annoying like the uncomfortable under wire of a bra that is a bit&gt; &gt; worn!) What i will say is this Markk: Sometimes you will ask what to&gt; &gt; do in a situation, and people will give you a response. Sometimes, it&gt; &gt; is just best to trust in that niggling feeling you have about what to&gt; &gt; do, if you don't have that niggling feeling, maybe then you can ask.&gt; &gt; But always remember the best thing you can do is suited to the kind of&gt; &gt; person you are. If i was to make an observation, sometimes you don't&gt; &gt; trust yourself as much as you could, or should. Even if&gt; &gt; inexperienced, you are most qualified to make any decisions. You are&gt; &gt; a caring and sensitive, man-ly, man. You are in essence, the best of&gt; &gt; man-ly men, and the best of the SNAG - so whatever is right for you&gt; &gt; shouldn't come from a unique hippie vegetarian like me, or the&gt; &gt; metroness of Matt, because we only represent half of you. If you are&gt; &gt; worried, you have every right to be. If anything, it represents how&gt; &gt; much you care, and how much it means to you. Whatever the case,&gt; &gt; remember that Matt and I are here for you, like a good Man-Bra should&gt; &gt; be!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Eden - i await another day in which we can meet for some breaky and&gt; &gt; coffee!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Lisa - when do you find out the results of the student election?&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Well all, have a great day, week, month, and we shall all be together&gt; &gt; soon, like a good troupe of baboons (the ladies flashing their bright&gt; &gt; red arses around the places, and the men, chasing those red arses&gt; &gt; around like there is no tomorrow - who am i kidding? That is nothing&gt; &gt; like our group - Julie, i think i just wanted to make a reference to&gt; &gt; Africa again!)&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Camel.

I miss lots these days.  For some reason.

There is a date set for the mountain climb.  I think next weekend's next weekend.

Also, after UNI celebrations.  Why not another wet and wild day.  I.e. a theme park.  I propose wet and wild.  They have a new ride and their old ones I haven't rode enough yet.

Thats my idea and I'm sticking with it.  I think my last idea was to watch superbad and that movie was radical.  I think that radical is underused... and for a very good reason.

Hey all.

I've decided I wanna feed my bichir (frog, his name is frog) some live fish.  The problem is that frog is kinda dumb, and the other fish would get to the feeder fish before him.  I wanna get basically a pair of metal (preferably) tongs so that I can hold the food and bring it down to him but I have no idea of where to get such things.  I was hoping that you scientists out there might know of something.Oh also I should mention my tank is over 2 feet deep so something long would be handy.  Thanks.

Sounds pretty cruel to me, dragging fish around in the water with tongs. I'd much rather you used some sort of net stretched over a frame to isolate the bircher from the other fish and put the feeder fish in with him - just because it's food dosen't mean it should have to go through a traumatic experience before it's swallowed (being swallowed would be traumatic enough).

Just had an idea, what about a large-bore tube? Put the tube in the water down to bircher level, put the feeder fish in the top of the tube, it swims down to its doom, bircher is fed. The end.

Nah frog is really stupid.  He will be scared of the tube, the fish will swim past him.

He first smells the food, sticks his nose up.  Then paddles his way over slowly, looks at the food for a while, then carefully plucks the food from its place.  More than often a catfish or a cichlid attacks him and he gets scared and swims away.  I can try with dead fish... just if their rithing around I figure he will wanna eat them more. But I guess thats not too hard to simulate.  I got this idea from someone else who has bichir.  But in his case its all he had, 5 bichir and 1 he wanted to make sure got a feed (the dumbest one) his bichir attacked the tongs more than the fish.  I think he also used it to convert them onto pellets.  And as far as feeder fish having rights?  You will find in pet stores they don't feed the feeder fish, appearently it costs more money to feed them as it does to pay someone to scoop out the hundreds of dead ones each week.  In a money driven society you see the more expensive the fish, the more rights it has.  Its not just the shops, the customers too.  If a customer walks past a display tank with 1 dead fish they will complain, if they walk past a feeder fish tank with say 40 fish dead and floating around, so long as it doesn't smell (prawns smell) they don't care.But on your account I will find a way.  Is killing them first humaine?
