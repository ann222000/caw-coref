I just returned from one of the hardest evenings of my life.  Mary, my
kids, and I just attended the visitation for Blane Anderson, our
friend and fellow pilot who lost his life in the crash of a Spencer
Air Car (and amphibious homebuilt craft) last Friday, just west of
Iowa City.  He was less than 20 minutes from home when his plane went
down, hard.

No cause has yet been determined, and the local aviation community is
freaking out about this seemingly inexplicable accident, and the death
of arguably our finest local pilot.  Chief pilot of the FBO, CFII,
home-builder, tail-dragger, multi-engine, turbine -- you name it,
Blane flew it.  Everyone who flew with him said he was a great stick.
And he had learned to fly in a Pietenpol, which is to say that he
*really* knew how to fly.

At age 34, Blane left so much on the table.  A beautiful, young wife;
twin 5-years olds; a 2-year old. There were his parents, and grand-
parents, standing before his open casket, numbly greeting grieving
friends and relatives for well over five hours.  The line stretched
out the door for hours on end, in sub-zero temperatures.  No one
complained, and no one left.

Every pilot I know was there. We all feel and fear the same thing,
without saying a word.  The thought on everyone's mind is simple: "If
this could happen to Blane, it could happen to any one of us."   We
look at the grieving widow, and the crying children, and the body in
the casket, and realize that what we are doing for fun is terribly,
inescapably dangerous, and can claim any of us at any time.

We all are left to silently wonder -- are we crazy, or are we just
stupid?  Is this irresistable call to the sky that we answer going to
be our swan song?  Are we just being selfish, putting our kids at
terrible risk every time we strap them into the back seat?

Are the naysayers about general aviation *right*?   Do we have any
right to risk ourselves and others for what amounts to a hobby?

I don't know.  I've followed the call of aviation as far as I can, and
reaped benefits from it that few have enjoyed.  I've slipped the surly
bonds of earth a thousand times, and have never felt closer to God or
more free then when I am flying.

But when I introduced my family to Blane's mom, all she could say,
with an intensity that can be brought about only through death, was
"Hold on to your children...as tightly as you can."  And then she
wouldn't let my hands go, as her tear-filled eyes met mine...

Jay, My heart felt condolences for all.
I've been flying over 32 years... 20 years in the Air Force in some pretty
fast jets on dark nights, bad weather and close to the ground. I've lost
friends to stupid pilots... or just dumb accidents when you hit a 25 pound
brown pelican at 540knts.

You can say, that your friend LIVED A LIFE, living it to the FULLEST.

Could you say the same thing if he was wrapped up in cotton batting and
never left the house? Afraid of what was around the corner?

I've lost friends from falling off a roof retrieving a Frisbee when he was
playing in the yard with his kids.
I've lost friends to motorcycle accidents, getting hit by stupid drivers
through no fault of their own.
I've lost friends to car accidents, getting hit by drunk drivers.

Short version.
A story I tell often, you never know when it's your turn, and when it is
your turn, you cannot avoid it. You have to live life.

A friend was scheduled to be on a certain KC-135, but was sick with a cold
and did not make the flight, another squadron member took his spot and the
sick friend headed home. Another friend was heading into the squadron, saw
the one car coming his way, remembered something he had forgotten to bring
from home and turned around. He watched the KC-135 crash in his mirror, an
engine taking out the car of the one who did not get on board.

If he had not turned around, he would have been in the same spot getting hit
by the -135. It was not his turn.
The friend who was going home sick, it was his turn, and not getting on
the -135 did not change it.

We are neither crazy nor stupid, we train, we practice, we watch the weather
and we put our training to work.
We enjoy life. Life is to be lived, to the fullest that we can.

I've told my friends, and I've told my only child. You cannot be afraid of
tomorrow, go out, live, if you want to do something, fly, water ski, scuba
dive, mountain climbing, what ever, learn all that you can about it. Enough
people have done it before you and written great books and there are great
teachers, use their experience and knowledge and build your own experiences
and you can teach others.

You cannot have a life, if you never leave home.

BT

What would you be doing if you weren't flying? Would it be safe?

Yeah, you probably ought to worry and you probably ought to let this
experience keep you sober. But how would you go about figuring out the
answer to your question without learning to see into the future?

I've had friends die driving a combine, others from the mundane car
accident, some from age and even one from a freak congenital disorder
at the age of 20. His mother and father were particularly deeply
affected. He was their only son, still in college and his death was no
more sensible than the combination of one fruit pie for breakfast and
an extra nerve in his heart. His death came about without even the
hint of risk in his lifestyle.

Comparing how to leave your loved ones is a fruitless enterprise and,
if you're respected and loved, you're going to leave deeply
heartbroken people behind.

Maybe this is futilistic but living seems to be a series of decisions
involving risk. Taking on some activity with increased risk means,
unfortunately, that activity is more likely to kill you. That's up to
you.

To answer your question more directly, it would only be insane to take
the risk without responsible reflection. Rationalization of your
willingness to take that risk may well be a matter of delusion but in
the case of aviation, there's a large body of data about your odds to
help you determine if you are rationalizing. Even if you don't crash
an airplane, you're part of that statistical body. And when you take a
balanced look at the way you fly and your other activities, how much
has your risk increased?

It's to be expected that you would ask these things of yourself in
shock and grief. I don't believe, though, you'd be doing your best,
sane thinking to attempt to answer the question while you're still
experiencing those reactions.

Take a look at what aviation means to you and your family. From what I can
see, (and what do I know), it looks after you and your family well. You are
constantly posting your experiences of majestic flights, viewing God's
greatest images. It generates your income through your Inn. It's been good
to you, and you obviously respect it. Your friend obviously respected it
too, judging by the way you spoke of him. It was obviously just his time,
and as heart wrenching as it may be, it is probable that had he not been
flying, it still would have been his time. He died doing what he, and the
rest of us love. He knew the risks, as did his wife, and family.
Don't question your sanity, or your ability to fly. Instead, make a memorial
flight in his honour. Just take off, and reflect quietly on his life and
your time with him. Then return home, greasing it in for the best landing
you've ever done, and realise once more exactly why we do what we do.
Not sure I'm getting across what I want to get across with these words Jay,
but I reakon you know what I'm trying to say.

Jay and BT,
You both wrote very, very moving posts here tonight. Thank you both for
sharing your thoughts.

My friend and I had an engine failure in October due to an oil cooler
failure that dumped all our oil. The engine seized 6 minutes into the
flight. We landed in the desert about 3/4-mile from the other local
airport we were headed to. We were shaken up, bruised and grateful. The
plane was totaled.

That event makes you think many of the same thoughts and ask yourself
many of the same questions both of you listed. I questioned whether I'd
fly again. By the third day, I wanted to go complete the flight to that
other airport. I've only been flying since 2002. My kids are in their
20s. My daughter flies also. I think about "it" on some level every time
I fly. Some days it *isn't* worth the risk, and I stay home; other days
the lure of that wondrous, absolutely amazing and unique experience (is
there anything else like it?) outweighs the risk hands down, and I can't
wait to go!

My son and his girlfriend almost died in an apartment fire 10 years ago;
their friend didn't make it out alive. He hasn't ventured far from his
room since. He doesn't seem to feel like he's missing out on life, and
maybe it's harder on those of us who've seen him shut himself in than it
is for him.

Point is, we all deal with tragedies and near tragedies and the
resulting thoughts, questions and decisions differently.

My condolences to you and all who knew your friend, Jay. Even those of
us who didn't know him feel the loss, thanks to your thoughtful words.

We could all die in bed, having never done anything.  Or we
could die at birth.  Or in car accidents, bath tubs,
swimming pools, icy sidewalks.  We might even live over 100
years and die wishing we had swum in the ocean [sharks,
barracuda and jelly fish].

Yes we are crazy and stupid.

Jay:

I fly a small single-engine aircraft (yes, even at night).  I even fly single
pilot IFR in my own single-engine aircraft (well, not right now since I'm
not current).  I even ride a motorcycle.

But remember what happened to me last year in Cedar Rapids?  I tripped
crossing a street, for pete's sake!  My injury wasn't *immediately* life
threatening, but I wasn't in surgery a few hours later for kicks and giggles.

Enjoy life.  Manage your risks, but enjoy life.

Jay, I'm sorry for your loss.

So far, I've only lost one friend to a crash. I have lost more in automobile
crashes. This morning's news was about a high school freshman who was killed
when an SUV driven by a schoolmate (senior) lost control and hit him.

The only consolation I can find for your friend is that he died doing what
he loved. I cannot think of a better way to go.

Charles Lindbergh said, "I decided that if I could fly for ten years
before I was killed in a crash, it would be a worthwhile trade for an
ordinary lifetime." He challanged the Atlantic on a single engine and

Neither.  Or maybe both.  We're human.  We have no other comparative species
to measure our collective decisions or misfortunes against.

Two years ago one of my brothers and his wife lost their full term unborn
baby to spina-bifida.  Blessing or curse?  We'll never know.  Undeterred,
they recovered from their loss, conceived again, took extra precautions,
additional doctor visits and additional monitoring.  This year, three days
before Christmas, they lost another full term unborn baby when the umbilical
cord wrapped itself around the baby's neck, just 3 days before a scheduled
delivery.  Two full term babies lost, never to experience life. Two young
parents will never experience the love and joy of what would have been their
third and fourth children.  Two little brothers left scared and confused,
wondering where the babies went.

The product of risk is rarely as beautiful as it is ugly.

So do we then shelter and over protect those around us, limiting their
exposure to any and all risk?  Do we prohibit any experience where risk
outweighs practical benefit?  Do we arbitrarily decide that after a single
tragedy that all around us should be forever prohibited to participate in
the same behavior?  These would be truly selfish acts.  Acts designed more
so to protect the minds, hearts, and welfare of the survivors, not
particularly to protect the participants.  Imposed security limits liberty
no matter who the imposer.

Our decisions and associated risk management become harder when we choose to
engage our children in "our" risky events, for as children, they often have
no choice.  Hopefully we take all available precautions and use our best
judgment, but to shield our children from the experiences and opportunities
that our chosen activity offers would be in itself a tragedy.

What would life be without living?

Agreed.

I know too many people who are sleep-walking through life, rarely
going beyond the confines of their living rooms.  They believe they
are "safe", as they eat their high-fat, high-sodium foods in front of
the boob-tube.

They look at what Mary and I do as hopelessly wreckless.  We look at
what they do as hopelessly pathetic.  Never the twain shall meet, I
guess.

In the end, we believe that Blane lived life to the fullest.
Unfortunately, his children may never share our philosophy.

I have only been flying for 25 years, but in that time I have
experienced the deaths of many friends and acquaintances.
After getting my PPL, I got heavily involved with aerobatics and warbird
pilots. The aerobatic pilots have passed at the rate of one or two every
year.
The first couple had me asking the same questions.
In discussing it with one pilot friend who had been around for awhile,
his matter of fact response of "When your number's up, you're number's
up" has stayed with me.
I still feel the loss and I still wonder why, but I do not dwell it.
As others here have said, remember the good times and the joy it brings
to you and pilots and friends you share the activity with.
Read all the accident report you can and run "what-if" scenerios through
your head when you are looking for things to do.
The more prepared you are, the better equipped to handle a situation.
There may come a time when even that won't be enough.
The most important thing to remember is, never give up!

Jay, sorry for your loss. My condolences to all.

I would use different words and quote different situations, but I could not
improve
on the comments by Jay &amp; BT. Well said, gentlemen. To this day, I can't look
at a missing man formation with dry eyes. Jay, My heart felt condolences for
all.

Lots of people get killed every year, but that doesn't hurt as much as
someone you really care for. You care for them for a reason, because of what
they are, what they care about, and what they stand for. They are what they
are partially because of what they do.

Sure, we're still crazy after all these years.

&gt; Jay, My heart felt condolences for all.
&gt; I've been flying over 32 years... 20 years in the Air Force in some pretty
&gt; fast jets on dark nights, bad weather and close to the ground. I've lost
&gt; friends to stupid pilots... or just dumb accidents when you hit a 25 pound
&gt; brown pelican at 540knts.

&gt; You can say, that your friend LIVED A LIFE, living it to the FULLEST.

&gt; Could you say the same thing if he was wrapped up in cotton batting and
&gt; never left the house? Afraid of what was around the corner?

&gt; I've lost friends from falling off a roof retrieving a Frisbee when he was
&gt; playing in the yard with his kids.
&gt; I've lost friends to motorcycle accidents, getting hit by stupid drivers
&gt; through no fault of their own.
&gt; I've lost friends to car accidents, getting hit by drunk drivers.

&gt; Short version.
&gt; A story I tell often, you never know when it's your turn, and when it is
&gt; your turn, you cannot avoid it. You have to live life.

&gt; A friend was scheduled to be on a certain KC-135, but was sick with a cold
&gt; and did not make the flight, another squadron member took his spot and the
&gt; sick friend headed home. Another friend was heading into the squadron, saw
&gt; the one car coming his way, remembered something he had forgotten to bring
&gt; from home and turned around. He watched the KC-135 crash in his mirror, an
&gt; engine taking out the car of the one who did not get on board.

&gt; If he had not turned around, he would have been in the same spot getting
&gt; hit by the -135. It was not his turn.
&gt; The friend who was going home sick, it was his turn, and not getting on
&gt; the -135 did not change it.

&gt; We are neither crazy nor stupid, we train, we practice, we watch the
&gt; weather and we put our training to work.
&gt; We enjoy life. Life is to be lived, to the fullest that we can.

&gt; I've told my friends, and I've told my only child. You cannot be afraid of
&gt; tomorrow, go out, live, if you want to do something, fly, water ski, scuba
&gt; dive, mountain climbing, what ever, learn all that you can about it.
&gt; Enough people have done it before you and written great books and there
&gt; are great teachers, use their experience and knowledge and build your own
&gt; experiences and you can teach others.

&gt; You cannot have a life, if you never leave home.

&gt; BT

&gt;&gt;I just returned from one of the hardest evenings of my life.  Mary, my
&gt;&gt; kids, and I just attended the visitation for Blane Anderson, our
&gt;&gt; friend and fellow pilot who lost his life in the crash of a Spencer
&gt;&gt; Air Car (and amphibious homebuilt craft) last Friday, just west of
&gt;&gt; Iowa City.  He was less than 20 minutes from home when his plane went
&gt;&gt; down, hard.

&gt;&gt; No cause has yet been determined, and the local aviation community is
&gt;&gt; freaking out about this seemingly inexplicable accident, and the death
&gt;&gt; of arguably our finest local pilot.  Chief pilot of the FBO, CFII,
&gt;&gt; home-builder, tail-dragger, multi-engine, turbine -- you name it,
&gt;&gt; Blane flew it.  Everyone who flew with him said he was a great stick.
&gt;&gt; And he had learned to fly in a Pietenpol, which is to say that he
&gt;&gt; *really* knew how to fly.

&gt;&gt; At age 34, Blane left so much on the table.  A beautiful, young wife;
&gt;&gt; twin 5-years olds; a 2-year old. There were his parents, and grand-
&gt;&gt; parents, standing before his open casket, numbly greeting grieving
&gt;&gt; friends and relatives for well over five hours.  The line stretched
&gt;&gt; out the door for hours on end, in sub-zero temperatures.  No one
&gt;&gt; complained, and no one left.

&gt;&gt; Every pilot I know was there. We all feel and fear the same thing,
&gt;&gt; without saying a word.  The thought on everyone's mind is simple: &quot;If
&gt;&gt; this could happen to Blane, it could happen to any one of us.&quot;   We
&gt;&gt; look at the grieving widow, and the crying children, and the body in
&gt;&gt; the casket, and realize that what we are doing for fun is terribly,
&gt;&gt; inescapably dangerous, and can claim any of us at any time.

&gt;&gt; We all are left to silently wonder -- are we crazy, or are we just
&gt;&gt; stupid?  Is this irresistable call to the sky that we answer going to
&gt;&gt; be our swan song?  Are we just being selfish, putting our kids at
&gt;&gt; terrible risk every time we strap them into the back seat?

&gt;&gt; Are the naysayers about general aviation *right*?   Do we have any
&gt;&gt; right to risk ourselves and others for what amounts to a hobby?

&gt;&gt; I don't know.  I've followed the call of aviation as far as I can, and
&gt;&gt; reaped benefits from it that few have enjoyed.  I've slipped the surly
&gt;&gt; bonds of earth a thousand times, and have never felt closer to God or
&gt;&gt; more free then when I am flying.

&gt;&gt; But when I introduced my family to Blane's mom, all she could say,
&gt;&gt; with an intensity that can be brought about only through death, was
&gt;&gt; &quot;Hold on to your children...as tightly as you can.&quot;  And then she
&gt;&gt; wouldn't let my hands go, as her tear-filled eyes met mine...

My sincere condolences as well. I won't try to expand on what others
have said, but from a practical point of view, I always hope that these
younger guys with kids have life insurance, because I remember when I
was young enough to need it it was difficult to get if you were a pilot.
If one had gotten a policy before taking up flying, that policy stayed
in force. If one tried to get a policy after starting to fly it was
nearly impossible, or one could get it with an exclusion for flying. At
one time I had a policy that wouldn't cover death in an airplane, but I
was covered in a glider.

Death is always an unwelcome intruder.  I have 3 acquaintances who
have each lost a lovely daughter, 2 of them teen-agers, another in her
20s.  One lost control of her car on ice;  one was killed by excessive
speed while riding as passenger on a snowmobile;  the third of Lupus,
an immune deficiency disease.  Each family was devastated, and the
loss is irreparable.

Personally, my own life was at risk when the driver of a Toyota in
which I was riding as a passenger fell asleep at 70 mph, and
subsequently rolled over 3 times before coming to rest on the
shoulder.  I was able to walk away from the car with only heavy
bruising.  It would have taken only a culvert, bridge abutment, or
nearby truck to terminate my life.

In a sense, we all live on borrowed time.  Knowing this, I accept the
risk of flying and enjoy life.  I don't think it's either crazy or
stupid.  I frankly feel safer in the plane than I do on urban
freeways, though that's probably an illusion.

The theme of this thread is that we should know the risks we're
willing to take on.

There's little doubt an hour in a GA airplane is more risky than an
hour in front of the TV, but the risk is quantifiable and to some of
us, acceptable. I don't subscribe to the notion that when our time
comes, that's it -- there's little reason to offer too much temptation
to that reaper or use that as an excuse for bad judgment..

We -- that is, most of us who read this newsgroup -- are luckier and
lead a more full life than many others. This lifestyle does us at
greater risk of an accidental death, and for many of us, more likely
to have lost good friends too early.

I know all of that, have experienced those kinds of losses, and still,
I'm happy to be at this particular dance. We chose to be here, we know
the risks, and I'm richer for having known some people these life
choices have brought close to me.

Jay, even now you'd likely say knowing this man was better than not
known him. Your grief is testament to that.

My sincere condolences Jay.

But to your question, how many of us in this group upon our own
aviation-related deaths, would wish to see a single pilot give up his wings?

It's not selfish. I fly with my grandson to teach him. Just as I read with
him, just as I draw pictures with him, just as I cook and play and wrestle
with him, I do it to teach. It would be selfish not to.

I've heard it was something in the charging system -- alternator/

In this sort of thing, the rumor mill grinds incessantly -- but not

&gt; I just returned from one of the hardest evenings of my life.  Mary, my
&gt; kids, and I just attended the visitation for Blane Anderson, our
&gt; friend and fellow pilot who lost his life in the crash of a Spencer
&gt; Air Car (and amphibious homebuilt craft) last Friday, just west of
&gt; Iowa City.  He was less than 20 minutes from home when his plane went
&gt; down, hard.

&gt; No cause has yet been determined, and the local aviation community is
&gt; freaking out about this seemingly inexplicable accident, and the death
&gt; of arguably our finest local pilot.  Chief pilot of the FBO, CFII,
&gt; home-builder, tail-dragger, multi-engine, turbine -- you name it,
&gt; Blane flew it.  Everyone who flew with him said he was a great stick.
&gt; And he had learned to fly in a Pietenpol, which is to say that he
&gt; *really* knew how to fly.

&gt; At age 34, Blane left so much on the table.  A beautiful, young wife;
&gt; twin 5-years olds; a 2-year old. There were his parents, and grand-
&gt; parents, standing before his open casket, numbly greeting grieving
&gt; friends and relatives for well over five hours.  The line stretched
&gt; out the door for hours on end, in sub-zero temperatures.  No one
&gt; complained, and no one left.

&gt; Every pilot I know was there. We all feel and fear the same thing,
&gt; without saying a word.  The thought on everyone's mind is simple: &quot;If
&gt; this could happen to Blane, it could happen to any one of us.&quot;   We
&gt; look at the grieving widow, and the crying children, and the body in
&gt; the casket, and realize that what we are doing for fun is terribly,
&gt; inescapably dangerous, and can claim any of us at any time.

&gt; We all are left to silently wonder -- are we crazy, or are we just
&gt; stupid?  Is this irresistable call to the sky that we answer going to
&gt; be our swan song?  Are we just being selfish, putting our kids at
&gt; terrible risk every time we strap them into the back seat?

&gt; Are the naysayers about general aviation *right*?   Do we have any
&gt; right to risk ourselves and others for what amounts to a hobby?

&gt; I don't know.  I've followed the call of aviation as far as I can, and
&gt; reaped benefits from it that few have enjoyed.  I've slipped the surly
&gt; bonds of earth a thousand times, and have never felt closer to God or
&gt; more free then when I am flying.

&gt; But when I introduced my family to Blane's mom, all she could say,
&gt; with an intensity that can be brought about only through death, was
&gt; &quot;Hold on to your children...as tightly as you can.&quot;  And then she
&gt; wouldn't let my hands go, as her tear-filled eyes met mine...

My condolences.
Your friend Blane is among those who accepted risk to follow dreams.
Without this there is no life, only the dull existence of wasted
opportunity.  And still death awaits, so make sure you live first.

actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and

again; because there is not effort without error and shortcoming; but
who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great
enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy
cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high
achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while
daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and

They may not share that philosophy, now.  It is common to resent that which
hurts us in the present.

Many children have problems relating to their parents.  Later in life, in
the course of living their lives, the children begin to understand the
actions and motivations of the parent, and appreciate what they formerly
found fault in.

It is very possible, and perhaps probable, that later Blane's children may
understand what drove him, and made his life so full and worth living.  They
may even find and live the same loves that Blane lived.

That is my hope.

Interestingly, the Sheriff's Department (of all people?) has released
some kind of statement about Blane's crash, saying that it was
probably caused by a "mechanical problem".

I've never heard of the Sheriff getting involved in NTSB/FAA turf

You do have a point. It is somewhat a selfish act. Perhaps after taking
it as far as one can, one should think about something different.
However our egos prevent us seeing things in perspective. Me, I could
quit I guess. I have done all I will do in aviation. I was thinking
about helicopters, but to what end? If I do go in a crash, I hope nobody
says the, "He died, doing what he loved", comment. Because I don't like
crashing airplanes. And I don't want the least bit of experience at it!

Years ago I had a case in which a young father died.  He worked for a
government agency involved in community redevelopment.  A significant
project was completed, and a celebration was held.  The place was a very old
local church.  This man went into the church, and sat about halfway down the
aisle, in the middle of the pew.

The celebration was held in the evening after a hot summer day.  The church
was old, and the windows were open because of the heat.  A thunderstorm
developed, complete with lightning.  According to witnesses, ball lightning
landed on the window sill next to the pew where this man was sitting.  The
ball lightning hopped across to the back of the pew, followed the back of
the pew to where this man was sitting, and jumped on him, causing the man's
death.

I often think about this when making a decision to go flying.  I don't
believe in pushing it, but when your number's up...

Great story.

Mary and I just returned from our first flight since our friend's
demise.  It was a rather emotional experience, and I admit that I had
some second thoughts during the climbout.

We made a bee-line for the area where he went down, located some 50
miles west of Iowa City.  It was very quiet as we slowly circled the
area, scanning the fields and contemplating the horrible thing that
had happened in such innocent-looking farm country.  With five inches
of new snow, and the wreckage removed, we never did identify the exact
field he went down in...

Everything looked so peaceful and normal.  The air was smooth as
glass, and my spirits soared as I arced effortlessly through a clear
blue sky.  It was a beautiful day to fly.

Jay,

My condolences.  No doubt, the aviation community lost a great pilot and
several lost a great friend as well.  I hate it when there are so many
unanswered questions at a time like this.  I can imagine the unanswered
how/why questions both spoken and unspoken.  BTDT when family members
and friends have passed away, sometimes suddenly.

I'm glad you and Mary had a chance to get back in the air.  I'm sure it
was uncomfortable and that feeling in itself must have been strange.
Here you guys are doing something so familiar yet Blane's death opens
your eyes wider to the possibility that something bad can happen to you.

From what I've read about Blane, IMHO, he'd want everyone he knew to
keep the dream of flying alive.  I'm glad you and your family can do so.
I know that I sure will.

I think so, if they are so young as to be incapable of assessing the
risk.  Would you fly with a GA pilot whom you didn't "know"?  I do,
but I'm capable and willing to assess and accept the risk, with full
knowledge of what death means, and how it looks, not on TV, and that
no matter how skilled my PIC (I'm not licensed), shit happens.

Whose ass doesn't pucker a little when the take-off roll begins, and
when the wheels leave the ground?  Mine does, every time.

As a former truck driving instructor (and advanced truck driving) I
know that when the fear leaves, risk creeps in, presumably to fill the
void.  Rookie drivers have a better incident rate since they (usually)
maintain a fear of their equipment.  Once they allow that fear to be
replaced by confidence (and complacency) , they become dangerous.

No relevance to your friend, but human nature is human nature, and
difficult to change without the application of conscious effort.
That's why morons drive identically in all conditions, they got away
with it last time.

The important thing, I think, is to learn from the error (if any) in
the incident of your friend, and reap what benefit there may be.
There can be no greater tribute to one's death than to save another
life.  Make sure it never happens again.

It saved my ass, on more than two occasions...

Gene,

I was working for an Idaho based avionics company in 2002 when a
tragedy occured.  Three employees of the company, including my
immediate boss who was one of the three partners that had started it,
were in a landing accident in a Lancair.  Two of them were killed
including the one who was PIC.  My boss managed to survive with a
severe leg fracture that required surgery and had a risk of amputation
if it didn't succeed.

Immediately after the accident, I warned his wife that she should make
sure that he didn't wallow in survivors guilt since he had lived and
the others had not.

Two weeks after the accident, his partners and the head of the company
that had bought them out, called him in for a management meeting since
he had been at home recuperating.  They demanded that he resign, which
he did under the pressure and the fact that he was a mess still from
the accident.  Seems that they had blamed him for the accident even
though he wasn't flying the plane.  You are right about people wanting
to blame someone for an aviation accident.  I have seen it happen
first hand, and know that the guy they blamed was not responsible for
it happening...

I left that company about 9 months later, which was the first
opportunity I found to switch jobs.  It was an awful place to work,
and was no where near the professional, supportive environment I had
known at Boeing.

Blame is usually not constructive in aviation or anywhere. One of the
very few things that stuck in my mind from some managenent training I
took is that if a good employee makes a costly mistake, you've just
made an investment in their education. No time to throw it away.
Unfortunately politics often get in the way. Come to think of it,
politics and blame go together a lot.

The fiance of whom I spoke was killed driving home from my house.
After several years, one of her daughters is still bitter towards me -
the other has thanked me for making her Mom's last days her happiest.
Same event, bipolar responses. One celebrates her Mom and adds joy to
the world, the other still mourns and adds pain. In the beginning, I
lashed out at a couple peole who didn't deserve it, but soon made a
choice to live on. Grief is a very complicated animal.

My grandfather spent 10 years dying from the results of a stroke. If it
could happen to someone like my grandfather (who, incidentally at age 75
before the stroke had a physique to put many 25 year olds to shame), it
could happen to any of us.

We all die. Some of us will make a fatal error while aviating. Some of
us will spend years dying. But we all die. You have a choice: be afraid
of your own shadow and instead of living, merely waiting to die (like
many of the most risk averse in society are doing, without even
realising that they are merely waiting to die instead of living) - or
perhaps take reasonable risks and actually live.

Aviation has risks, but it isn't insane. The overwhelmingly vast
majority of us can expect years of trouble free flying. Even in my Dad's
sport (motorcycle racing - my Dad races motorcycle sidecars in road
racing), the overwhelming majority survive their entire racing career.
In the end it boils down to this: is the risk/reward relationship good
enough? And don't think wrapping yourselves in cotton wool gets rid of
risk - it doesn't - you still stand a 100% risk of dying, and however
you wrap yourself up as we live longer you're increasingly more likely
to spend 10 years having an awful death like my grandfather.

While doing 170mph on the back of a friend's Super Blackbird
(motorcyle), I was not afraid, I merely thought "well, if we do crash at
least it won't hurt for very long".
