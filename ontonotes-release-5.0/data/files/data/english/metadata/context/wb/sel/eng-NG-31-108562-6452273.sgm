tool for stripping wires without cutting them?

I plan to install a remote starter in my car.  I'd like to buy a tool
to strip the wires, if its not too expensive.  I have a set of plier-
like ones, where you insert the wire into the correct slot, squeeze
the handles, then pull the wire through, shedding the insulation.

But that is only for stripping the ends of wires.  I'd like to be able
to strip wires 'inline', without cutting them.  Is that what an
automatic stripper does? Like
http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062786
or
http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/displayitem.taf?Itemnumber=42101

Or is there another tool? Thanks.

Thats what I used when I put in my last remote starter.  It was a lot
of slow, careful work.  I was hoping there was a tool that could do
this quickly and without risk of cutting the wire.

Those strippers are for stripping the end only.  Their specialty is that
they "adjust" to the size of the wire automatically.  This means they only
remove 10% of the strands along with the insulation.  ;-)

Seriously, you should use a better connector instead.  You don't want to
strip an inch of insulation off, you just want to displace enough insulation
to make a connection.  Something like these:
http://www3.3m.com/catalog/us/en001/utilities_telecom/electrical_cont...
Try to find some that have a moisture resistant grease inside.  This will
not only keep water out, but the air too.

Of these two the RS one is ideal for this purpose - provided you use the
correct size for the cable, and the sizes provided by the jaws cover the
cables in use.
I've got just about every cable stripper known to man and although the
automatic types sound like a good idea they simply don't match up to this
type for stripping with no chance of conductor damage - provided as I say
you use the correct 'notch' out of the four provided and make sure it's
aligned on the cable. If you're sloppy about this it makes a good cable
cutter. ;-) The snag is it needs more space to work than some other types.

This type is also of use as again won't damage the conductor but has to be
manually adjusted. Couldn't find it on the RS site, but most electricians
use them.

Do you think that stripping an inch of insulation in the middle of a run is

Short of soldering, I can't think of anything more reliable than IDC type
crimp-ons.  They're used all over the place in critcal applications.  e.g.
computer data cables, network and telephone industry etc.  Auto makers use
plenty of crimp-on pins too.  :-)

90% of professional alarm installers use the T-Tap 3M connectors. They have
a great track record and work well, and are used because of the speed in
which they can be put in, as well as the fact you don't want to drop a hot
soldering iron in a brand new corvette seat :-). If you use some 3M super 33
tape and wrap the harness for the alarm, and wrap your connections properly,
when you finish it looks enough like the car harness that a thief is hard
pressed to find the alarm wiring :-)

I don't know of any tool that would strip a section of wire other than at
the end. Why not use 3M splicers like everyone else? They don't require
anything except a pair of pliers. Way back when I started out in
electronics one of my first jobs was installing auto accessories. I used
those splicers all the time and can't recall every having a problem with
them.

&gt;I plan to install a remote starter in my car.  I'd like to buy a tool

I use several mentioned in this thread, including yours. I also use a

Sorry, I just realised that you wanted to strip *without* cutting.

90% of aftermarket alarms are apparently installed with the noise- and
vibration-detectors turned all the way up, presumably so the person
buying them will feel like they got something for their money.  The
result is continual false alarms.

I don't know why anyone buys an alarm system anymore.  After years of
getting a 3 am alarm serenade I have to say my first reaction upon
hearing a car alarm is *not* that someone must be stealing the car.
Someone needs to invent an EMP gun that can take these little
noisemakers out at fifty paces. ;)

There are a number of tools for stripping cable sheath longtitudinally
eg. Knipex
http://www.justoffbase.co.uk/Cable-Sheath-Stripper-51735-Draper-16-30...
but these are only for cables of around 6mm diam minimal. In order to
strip individual conductor sheathing (insulation) for smaller gauges
this is a rather specialised function for such purposes as stripping
thermocouple wires. This company sells this type of stripping tool but
they would be very expensive and probably only viable for mass
production. You also need a different stripper die for each wire
gauge.

I ended up getting this one from Radio Shack:
http://rsk.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/pRS1C-2160702w345.jpg
For $12.99.  It was a piece of junk, it felt like it was going to fall
apart.  I didn't even test it out, I just took it back.

Then I bought a different brand from Menards (home improvement store),
where you don't have to choose what size wire you are stripping, for
$15

And one of these (the kind where you must select the right hole for
your size of wire) for $25:
http://www.homedepot.com/cmc_upload/HDUS/EN_US/asset/images/eplus/783...

I tried them both.  The $25 set (the only one made in the USA) works
great.  I'll be keeping that one.

It does strip wire in the middle, but not perfectly.  But it will be
much easier than manually trying to cut without damaging any strands.
I'll still have to make a laterall cut manually.

Thanks for all the input.

I have one of similar design - not of course from Radio Shack - and it
cost a deal more than the one they show. It's the best wire stripper I
have and I have many. It's also had a lot of use and still works properly
on the original jaws which are available as spares.

I can't of course comment on the RS one, but not even trying something
after buying seems strange.

I did try it, by working the tool in my hand many times, that was
enough.  The operation of the left and right jaws weren't right,
sometimes when you let the tool close the blades wouldn't be open so
you couldn't put the wires in.  The handles didn't move smoothly, they
wanted to wobble all over instead of moving in an arc.  Sometimes it
would get stuck open.

As soon as I opened the package of the US made one, I could tell just
by the feel of it that it was a much much better tool.

When made correctly that type of tool can work very well.  I have one
made specifically for RG-59U coax that I use when installing security
cameras.  It's very quick and reliable.  But it's a fairly heavy-duty,
well-made item, which means it probably didn't come from Radio Shack. ;)
