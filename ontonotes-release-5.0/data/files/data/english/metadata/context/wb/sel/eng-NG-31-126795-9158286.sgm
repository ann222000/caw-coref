1          Shri Harbinder Singh Sikka has brought certain facts after
observing &amp; experiencing his research work for long while staying in
Sri Lanka. He presented certain facts regarding Sri Lanka &amp; Shri Ram's
relations that existed in the past long back history. The programme
was relayed on Zee News on 13.10.2007. Thanks to Shri Sikka &amp; Zee
News.

2          It is said in the Ramayan that Shri Hanuman while intruding
Lanka was arrested by the security of Ravan. Then the King Ravan
orderd to kindle fire on the tail of Shri Hanuman. Hanuman's tail was
fired that further by  its unlimited length extension like heavy
electric cable. Shri hanuman flew over the entire portion of Sri Lanka
&amp; the whole Lanka was set on fire but excluding the portions of Ashok
Vatika where Mata Sita was kept in captivity. Mata Sita was quiet safe
during the fire setting session.

3          The golden Lanka was destroyed by Hanuman in full. The
evidence exists by the color of the rocks or soil that is available in
the portion of fire zone. The portion of fire zone shows the colour of
the soil complete Black while that of the other zone where the fire
was not spread is grey that makes a difference about the nature of the
soil. In the same region of one side of the existing water body is
black while on the other side it is grey. The black colour is the
result of fire as is understood evidently.

4          Mr Sikka has gone all over Lanka &amp; could not find that
colour of soil. He also visited a mountain by the name Supra on the
sea shore, the only mountain as there is no chain or range of
mountains on that area. This mountain appears to have been transported
by someone from far distant. This mountain is an open house of medical
herbs or plants and generally the residents of Sri Lanka use it as
their doctor. They take out the herbs to be used as medicines for
their illness recovery &amp; are treated very well. A Hanuman statue is
also available adjacent that is worshipped by those who are recovered.
Though these people belong to Buddhist faith, yet they consume the
herbs &amp; then worship for thanks giving to Shri Hanuman. It is said
that it is the same mountain as was brought by Shri Ram when Laxman
was unconscious due to being attacked by Ravan's son Meghnat. The
Lankan Vedya wanted the Sanjivni Herb that was available only on this
mountain. Since Hanuman could not identify the particular Herb, he
lifted the entire mountain &amp; flew it to the location where  it is
situated now. This mountain was never taken back to its original
location. This mountain is able to produce all kind of herbs so that
the people make use to treat all diseases.

5          There is a place on certain rocks exhibiting the footprints
of Hanuman &amp; others clearly on the rock proving the potential these
souls had. Though it is a matter of faith but certain records appear
to be clear just to resolve the issue. It is also said that the stones
that were used for the construction of the bridge to cross the sea
were too light to flow on water easily. Such stones still are
available there.

6          Eng Neil a member of Sugriv Vanar Sena was responsible for
the design as well as construction of the cross bridge now named as
Ram Setu. This is quiet voluminous about 30 m wide for a good access
of human as well as certain equipment.

7          The area where Mother Sita was kept in captivity in Ashok
Vatika is having its attractive beauty of green quiet different than
that of the area that is quiet black in its soil colour. The surface
as well as the depth all are black. How it is possible is not
answerable except a thought that the black portion is due to fire
caused by Hanuman at that time?

9          Though these findings do not scientifically prove about the
existence of Shri Ram but science is not above the existence of Shri
Ram. Science is too small in comparison to the existence of Shri Ram.
Historians cannot answer such questions or findings as they themselves
are not scientific or having a calculative capacity. These historians
previously used to claim that Mahabharat happened prior to Ramayana
now, they have changed their opinion by accept the belief that
Ramayana happened before Mahabharat. Anyway, we as people of Bharat &amp;
particularly those belonging to Sanatan Vedic Dharmikas do not need
any acceptance by the historians or the scientists that Shri Ram's
existence be proved. Shri Ram is naturally proven by the fact that
billions of people for centuries have faith in him &amp; Shri Ram has
already been adopted as a part of cult fort thousands of years.

10        Those who have been talking about the proof are staying in a
dream world thinking that they are above Shri Ram. These people have
misused the powers of the expression of thought &amp; the liberty that the
Dharmikas has granted to the people of Bharat. These people might not
have talked that way should some devil like Kans were in power.

11        Shri Ravan's wife Mandodri was born in Rajasthan. In her
Maika village, yet Ravan is considered as their son in law &amp; they
condole the day of Dushera. It is another indirect evidence of
existence of Shri Ram. The effigies of Raven is not burnt there. These
people have been offering shrads on the day of Shri Ravan's death.

12        Do these historians or the so called scientists believe in
the existence of god or their own souls? These people first must prove
how they themselves have been existing live in this world &amp; how their
souls have been working scientifically? Let Karuna Nidhi explain to
the entire world how he has been living in this world without the
souls in his body &amp; who has been operating his system? Some people are
mad in this world who tall for certain narrow gains are irrelevant
issues like Karuna &amp; other Historians as well as scientists do?
Unfortunately, the government of Bharat too have cooperated &amp;
supported them openly.

13        The question is whether or not, the government of the day
has the potential to speak against the existence of Shri Ram or just
for the sake of votes &amp; their survival in the government, they have
stopped talking about the very much live issue of Shri Ram's
existence. Shall Karuna reply whether or not he believed in Ravan's
existence? The faith of the people in the existence of Shri Ram has
increased &amp; augmented many folds since the issue was raised by the
government stating that there is no historic proof of Shri Ram. The
increasing values of Shri Ram in Bharat has proved that the approach
by the government is baseless &amp; against the Vedic communities in
Bharat as well as around the world. People believe in Ram's existence
very much. In fact it is more than their own existence.
