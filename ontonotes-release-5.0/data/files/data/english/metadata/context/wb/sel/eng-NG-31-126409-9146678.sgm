Hello:

I developed a nice looking web page which provided people with a brief
overview of our society's publications (our different newsletters).
However, while I'm by no means an expert or professional website
designer, I know enough about XHTML 1.0 to know that the best way to
guarantee interoperability on all, or at least most browsers, including
lynx is to make sure my site complies with the w3 standards. So, I ran
my site through the XHTML 1.0 Transitional validator, and it didn't
pass, so I had it clean up my markup using Tidy. I then copy and pasted
that markup into the validator, and it validated. However, when I viewed
the valid page online, it looked funny.

This is the page: http://www.reaps.org/walker_html/publications.html .
I'm not sure why the different paragraphs all have different fonts, when
I can't even see a &lt;font&gt; tag. My challenge is that a bunch of pages
on our site were recently redesigned by a professional website designer,
and now every time I create a new page, I try to use other pages he's
done as a template. But I'm not familiar with all his code (for example,
I have no idea what the &lt;span&gt; tag does). And since I can't find our
O'Reilly HTML book around here, I'm hoping somebody can take a look at
the source code, and let me know what I've done wrong, and how I can fix it.

Also, if I want to make each paragraph a different colour, what is the
valid way of doing that in XHTML 1.0 Transitional. I will eventually use
CSS for my formatting, but I want to wait until my paid time is does,
and I'm volunteering again. Then, I can take as much time as I need to
figure out the CSS code, without worrying about how well I'm using my time.

Thanks for your help; I look forward to learning from your feedback.

Yes, but, to guarantee interoperability, HTML 4.01 is better than XHTML
1.0.
XHTML 1.0 served as text/html relies on user agent parsing bugs.
XHTML 1.0 served as application/xhtml+xml isn't supported by IE.

There're no font elements, but there're CSS styles.
For example, the site contains:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; p.c3 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 80%}
">

This says that paragraphs with the class attribute set to &quot;c3&quot; will be
displayed with 80% of the user-chosen font size, and will use the Arial,
Helvetica or default sans-serif font face, from the highest priority to
the lowest priority, if available.

The span element has absolutely no semantic meaning.
It's a generic inline element, used only for styling purposes. Its overuse
is sign of bad design.

Unfortunately, his design is not good.

1) He uses many SPAN elements. They shouldn't appear in a normal POSH
(Plain Old Semantic HTML or XHTML) and are the mark of CSS designer whose
target is a specific visual presentation, not HTML or XHTML.
2) He uses ridiculous non-semantic class names: c1, c2, c3, c4 and c5.
This produces illegible code.
3) He atrociously combines these styles in a way that make them worst than
the FONT element.
For example, he used c1 for a 80% font-size style with a green color.
He uses this style for the left column menu, and for the &quot;Home &gt;REAPS
Publications&quot; location link line.
But, he also uses this style, combined with the style c4 (font-size: 70%,
color: #33CCFF) for the copyright.
The menu items and copyrights ought to have two distinct styles. Mixing
these styles is awful. Modifying the style of one item of the page would
become a nightmare as it would affects other parts of the page.
4) This copyright statement is tiny. My browser has an option to set a
lower limit to the font size. Without it, it's hard to read the text
without a 230% zoom!
Moreover, the main text body has size 80%. The text body ought to have
size 100% as this is the prefered user value.
Most probably, this web designer didn't knew that users were able to
change their font size, had a very good eye sight, and thought that 80% is
&quot;better for me&quot;.

5) He uses CSS, and yet, he uses a table layout.
6) He uses BR to form menu lists rather than UL. He uses SPAN and BR
rather than P for paragraphs. The only P element he uses is for something
that's not a paragraph!
It's hard to believe, but this page contains almost only SPAN elements!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And since I can't find our O'Reilly HTML book around here,

An HTML book wouldn't help. This page isn't written in XHTML or HTML. It's
written in CSS + tag soup. You cannot learn anything from the tags. Only
the style says something.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; what I've done wrong, and how I can fix it.

To fix it: Replace all those span with standard paragraphs.
For the menu, use an unordered list (UL) of anchors.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also, if I want to make each paragraph a different colour, what is the
&gt; valid way of doing that in XHTML 1.0 Transitional.

HTML and XHTML aren't designed for styling.
To style your document, you can use the most popular renderer technology:
CSS.
You must keep in mind that HTML can be viewed with different tools. CSS is
only one view of the HTML document.
You can learn CSS with tutorials linked from
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/tutorials .

Thanks for giving a URL instead of just pasting code.

Actually, you *don't* have any paragraphs. You have a big mass of
text with &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;, and groups of sentences are styled with &lt;span&gt;.
This makes it unnecessarily hard to figure out what's going on.

You have nested &lt;span&gt;s. Everything up to &quot;types of worms&quot; is in c2
within c1, and what comes after is in c2 *not* within c1. That's why
there's a difference.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; gives a blank line in some browsers, not all. If you had &lt;p&gt;
you could style it with a top margin; you can't do that with &lt;span&gt;.

Why not replace all that garbage with honest-to-gosh paragraphs?

The short, simple answer is that the span with class &quot;c1&quot; covers the
first three paragrpahs (even though they're not marked up as paragraphs)
and ends before the fourth paragraph. Span.c1 asks for font-family:
Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, which is apparently different from the
default font your browser is set to use (I'm betting you see Times New
Roman on that last graph). That's just the short, immediate answer, but
it won't improve your life significantly.

Read the posts by André and Jonathan, and heed what they say (although
Jonathan berates you a little much for markup you've apparently only
inherited). The fact that their posts are long point to the tragic
condition of your site. Diving in to learn HTML and CSS would be the
best thing you could do, while second choice is probably finding
*another* &quot;professional website designer&quot; (a good one this time), who
will redo the site for free. Good luck with that. ;-)

BTW, two weeks ago I suggested defining a background color, but your
site still lacks such a definition. Something like this in the CSS:

body { color:black; background-color:white; }

Thanks for all the feedback people. Actually, most of the CSS stuff was
added by HTML Tidy, believe it or not. The site looked fine before I
&quot;fixed&quot; it with Tidy. But this guy did overuse his span and table tags.
I've created nice looking pages before without nesting everything in
tables and &lt;span&gt; tags.

We had a professional designer work on our site before, and it wasn't
quite as fancy, but it was clean, simple, professional and nice. I had
no problem working with her code, because it was all straightforward.
You see, I originally designed a basic site on GeoCities, and then I've
steadily improved and enhanced it. I stepped down for awhile, and a
professional lady took over, and did a beautiful job. Then, she no
longer had time to volunteer her services, so I came back in and
continued working on the site.

Having the site redesigned like this, was not my idea at all. I was told
we were going to get the front page redesigned and that was it. Imagine
my shock when I visited the site one day and found that half the site
had been changed. I think for me now, the simplest thing would be to
scrap his code entirely and write my own. I'll just use his code for the
links table on the left and bottom and the banner at top, which I
actually hate.

John H: I had forgotten about your suggestion to define the background.
I will implement that suggestion, starting with this page. I'll do the
other pages as time permits.

Best thing to to do in your situation is to copy all the content without
markup. Saving as plain text from the browser is one way. Then paste
into a template page. Use plain semantic html to define your content,
i.e. &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; for paragraphs, &lt;h#&gt;...&lt;/h#&gt; for headings... Then style
later with your stylesheet.

&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;
&quot; http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd &quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=iso-8859-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-language&quot; content=&quot;en-us&quot;&gt;

&lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;reaps.css&quot; title=&quot;REAPS
default style&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;
...
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

Sorry for trashing you on code that you inherited I missed that., but to
to fix it will require that you get your hands dirty and learn a little
bit about html and css. There is not magic wand (or program) that can do
it for you.

There was a second CSS file that had no errors.  Also, the page appeared
to have no WCAG-A accessibility errors.  This means that Digital

Well, if you respect your site visitors, you will want to give them as
much control as they need or want over how they view your site. That's
part of what's behind the argument against using font sizes in px or
setting a fixed width for a page.

So ideally (theoretically), you can let the user's browser defaults
determine fonts and FG colors and BG colors. But in practice, that
doesn't always work, because a world of black-only text on white-only
backgrounds isn't as exciting as one with other colors. Corporate logos
and charts and graphics can all provide reason for using other colors,
so a bit of suggestion from a site designer can be appropriate, too.

In the case of the OP's site (by way of example) the previous volunteer
designer (he of the over-ambitious Frankenspans) used a bunch of
graphics which showed black texts on white backgrounds. These look okay
for visitors who have black-on-white set in their browsers. For anyone
else, though, it looks dopey, because they might have, say, a light blue
BG, and the white-BG graphics are just clumpy and ugly.

The OP's pages I looked at earlier seem to be offline now, but the
publications.html page is still visible and shows texts in blue and
green. These wouldn't look too bad on a white BG, but aren't so easy to
read against my browser's blue BG. The header banner graphic also
doesn't match well. He set the FG colors because he thought they'd look
nice, but he assumed a white BG to go with them.

In summary, avoid setting colors if you don't have to, but if you do
have to set them (because of the elements you've chosen), set both a BG
and FG color to ensure a good contrast and accessibility for everyone.

Users with good browsers can still use !important rules in their user
stylesheets to override your site's suggested colors if they have to.

&gt; I developed a nice looking web page which provided people with a brief
&gt; overview of our society's publications (our different newsletters).
&gt; However, while I'm by no means an expert or professional website
&gt; designer, I know enough about XHTML 1.0 to know that the best way to
&gt; guarantee interoperability on all, or at least most browsers,
&gt; including lynx is to make sure my site complies with the w3 standards.
&gt; So, I ran my site through the XHTML 1.0 Transitional validator, and it
&gt; didn't pass, so I had it clean up my markup using Tidy. I then copy
&gt; and pasted that markup into the validator, and it validated. However,
&gt; when I viewed the valid page online, it looked funny.

&gt; This is the page: http://www.reaps.org/walker_html/publications.html .
&gt; I'm not sure why the different paragraphs all have different fonts,
&gt; when
&gt;   I can't even see a &lt;font&gt; tag.
">

In addition to what others have said, the c1, c2 stuff is something that
Tidy will generate when _trying_ to convert from tag soup to CSS - and
it's actually worse.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My challenge is that a bunch of pages
&gt; on our site were recently redesigned by a professional website
&gt; designer, and now every time I create a new page, I try to use other
&gt; pages he's done as a template. But I'm not familiar with all his code
&gt; (for example, I have no idea what the &lt;span&gt; tag does).
">

Think about using the right tool for the job.  Almost all HTML elements
are named for what they do, for example, P is Paragraph, OL is Ordered
List, DIV is Division, TABLE is table, etc.

Now, SPAN is used when you want to SPAN something across some content,
for example, &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph, and this word is &lt;span
style=&quot;color:#ff0&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;, while this word is &lt;span style=&quot;font-
weight:bold&quot;&gt;in bold&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Span is like pepper, use it to bring flavor, but use sparingly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And since I
&gt; can't find our O'Reilly HTML book around here, I'm hoping somebody can
&gt; take a look at the source code, and let me know what I've done wrong,
&gt; and how I can fix it.
">

Look at the HTML specification &lt; http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/ &gt;, CSS
&lt; http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/ &gt;, and go over to http://www.htmldog.com
for turorials and such.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also, if I want to make each paragraph a different colour, what is the
&gt; valid way of doing that in XHTML 1.0 Transitional. I will eventually
&gt; use CSS for my formatting, but I want to wait until my paid time is
&gt; does, and I'm volunteering again. Then, I can take as much time as I
&gt; need to figure out the CSS code, without worrying about how well I'm
&gt; using my time.

&gt; Thanks for your help; I look forward to learning from your feedback.

What you really want is something like:
&lt;div id=&quot;header&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul id=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Membership&lt;/li&gt;... etc
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;leftside&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul id=&quot;submenu&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;... etc
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some content is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more content is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;... etc
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Then you can style the header, leftside, content and footer, and then
style those elements within each.  Take notice of the cascade.

No, they can override the style with a user stylesheet or turn it off in
their browser. I would say what more important is consider the contrast
of text and background.

Also if you choose a background image be sure to also define a
background color. Make it basically the same color as the image so the
text is readable while background image loads. We folk stuck on dialup
notice this all the time. Bad sites will have a page with white text on
say a blue background image. The don't define a background color so the
browser default white is displayed as the monster background image
loads...until it does we see white on white!

Another thing is not to define font size in pixels so the user may
enlarger it if they need to.

&gt; Best thing to to do in your situation is to copy all the content without

">

That's okay. I do know some HTML, as I have &quot;dabbled&quot; in it for several
years now. The problem is that I need some formal hands-on training, as
there is so much I don't know about HTML, and the web world is changing
so fast, I can't keep up with it. Seven years ago, the organization was
supposed to send me to some comprehensive training (I can't remember
where or by whom anymore) that would have been wonderful. But the board
decided it was too expensive. I will look at those tutorials, but
unfortunately, I don't learn well by reading. I learn by doing, and I
was doing just fine until Digital Sunshine came along. Likely, it will
soon come to a point where I'll demand some real training, or stop
volunteering. Nobody else at REAPS knows HTML, so the website would
unfortunately become neglected. Our first home page was all text, no
graphics, so I've progressed a fair bit since then. But I would love to
have the money to take some formal training and become an expert in
HTML, CSS and javascript, the latter of which I know virtually nothing.

I'm curious as to what people think of the following site:
http://www.reaps.org/compost/nervous-system.html . This is a page I
designed back in 2005 from scratch and tweaked it until the code was
rendered valid. This was my first ever page that I could put the valid
symbol on, and it was my first experiment with CSS. Admittedly, I copied
the CSS code from a government web page, and just modified it a bit to
work for us. I would appreciate your comments, but please don't trash
me; I'm still learning. If you have suggestions for improving the
markup, I'd like to hear it. I doubt that the background is defined, but
I can easily add that in.

By the way, the story behind how Digital Sunshine got selected to redo
the site, was that the guy used to be my boss' neighbour. Talk about a
pathetic way of selecting somebody. She liked the site he did for my
church, the Salvation Army in Prince George ( www.tsainpg.com ) and so she
asked him to redo our site. Yet, when I had her e-mail him asking him to
fix a few things, he hasn't done it. I want the site done in frames, so
if I change a URL, I don't have to change fifty thousand links, but just
one links page that appears in a frame in every page.

I probably shouldn't have uninstalled Adobe Page Mill from my iMac; it
might have made my life easier. But probably not. I think coding
everything by hand in Notepad or SimpleText is the best way to go. And
stupid OS X doesn't even had a decent text editor for doing HTML in.

If you want the whole page to have some non-default (or at least, some
specific) BG color, set it the way I suggested earlier, by including:

body { color:black; background-color:yellow; }

in the CSS. Or instead of yellow, use #FFFF00. Or some other RRGGBB
color combination. Just make sure when you do this that you set a
(pleasingly) contrasting color for the text.

The set the BG for specific paragraphs (or any other element), you use
the same technique:

p { color:black; background-color:#ffdddd; }

for all your paragraphs. Or add class or id names to &lt;p&gt; elements to
style them selectively:

p.recyclingtip { color:white; background-color:#00FF00; }
p#footer { color:#FFFFFF; background-color:#0000FF; }

with markup containing

&lt;p class=&quot;recyclingtip&quot;&gt;Re-use your egg cartons!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;recyclingtip&quot;&gt;Coffee grounds can be composted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;Copyright 2007 REAPS.org&lt;/p&gt;

For reasons of national security, I am required by law to instruct you
to avoid publishing a real page which makes &quot;each paragraph a different
colour&quot;. By posting pages with garish colors and unreadable text flow
you become subject to arrest and, potentially, imprisonment for life in
the year 1997.

Back in 1997, when I was first learning very basic HTML, we had some
pages in the Counselling Centre at the University of Northern BC (where
I was working at the time as a student) that used SSI. Unfortunately, my
co-worker was selected to be taught how to do SSI, and I wasn't. I will
have to find out if my web server supports SSI. It does support cgi
scripts, so it probably would support SSI.

How difficult are server-side include, PHP or ASP to learn? The latter
two are very commonly used these days, but I don't know how complicated
they are.

The page looks nice when it loads. Very Webby.

A sans-serif font (not Verdana) might be better for the bodytext. Some
say (and argue at length) that sans-serif typefaces are easier to read
online, while serif fonts are better for paper. I haven't done any
studies of my own but I've grown accustomed to sans-serif on the WWW.

I think I'm still unconvinced you need XHTML markup instead of HTML, but
enough about that.

Your stylesheets don't need the HTML comment delimiters; remove them.

I believe p {text-align: left;} is the same as all browsers' default
(for English), so this rule looks superfluous to me.

You have an &lt;h3&gt; and an &lt;h4&gt; in your markup, but no &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;h2&gt;, so I
suspect you chose those elements for their default rendered sizes in
your browser. Semantically, they aren't the 3rd- and 4th-level headings
on the page, so you're &quot;lying&quot; about the content, IYSWIM.

Some people (many of them named Jukka) like the idea of borders around
images which are used for links, so they will like the borders around
the W3C logos at the bottom of the page. Personally, I think those
images look mangled with the borders around them.

However, lots of folks point out that no regular user will care about
your page's validation or support of the W3C (the connection with the
W3C to worms is a separate discussion), so feel free to remove them (and
yes, I know, it hurts after all the work it took to get that first page
to validate, but we're proud of you anyway, and so's your mom).

This code, marked as a paragraph:

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;index.html&quot;&gt; Back to REAPS Programs &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;reproductive-system.html&quot;&gt; Reproductive System &lt;/a&gt;

The general rule is that, if you set one color, you should set them all:
background, regular text, links not yet visited, links previously
visited, and links over which the cursor is hovering.

I set my background to a very pale green, which is less straining for
most eyes than white.  It is close enough to white (#f0fff0  versus
#ffffff) that it has almost the same contrast as a white background for
any color text.

I don't set colors for regular text or links, violating the general
rule.  The usual browser defaults are black for regular text, blue for
unvisited links, and red for visited links.  These all give very good
contrast with a pale green background.  I assume that those who set
other default text colors also set their background colors to obtain
sufficient contrast.  (I set a yellow background for links over which
the cursor is hovering, but I don't set a color for the text of the link.)

I think one of the worst designed Web pages I ever saw had a black
background with a pattern of bright yellow and orange daisies.  The text
was red.  It was almost impossible to read.  This was the home page of
an ISP that obviously was not interested in customers, only in
demonstrating how clever and artistic the Web master was.

You mentioned having the links all in once place for easy maintenance.
This is easy in PHP. Simply create a file with nothing in it but the
navigation (links.html), then, whereever you want the links to appear in
your web pages, just include it with PHP:

&lt;div id=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php include('links.php'); ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The resulting page will look exactly as if the links were typed directly
into the source.

Does your current web host support PHP? If not, it's easy to find one
that does.

Either set both text and background colors, or set neither. If you

The PP was not suggesting to set background in isolation, but to set
it *because* foreground was being set.

The particular setting on black on white (or black on a very pale
color) is about the best there is for visual acuity. If anyone has
set black on blue as their default colors, it's because they like
those colors and not because it helps them read better.

PHP includes are easier and more powerful. The Response Header using the

200 OK

So you are running Apache and most likely your have PHP. To get you PHP
settings and test if it is enabled in a text editor create a text file
and past the flowing line.

&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;

Rename the file myphp.php and upload it to your server then travel the url:

http://www.reaps.org/myphp.php

If your have PHP enabled on the server your will get a table of all the
settings, else all you will get is the one line of code.

Other nitpickings:
The alt attribute of the img element is not used correctly. It should be a
replacement for the image as this should be shown in a user agent that
doesn't support images. Since the worm anatomy is the central part of the
site, it's important to let the user know the worm's anatomy. A longdesc
attribute should be used here.
If Corey Walker don't want a longdesc, the comment about the image
contents should be put into brackets like that: [Worm's anatomy drawing].
This will indicate that an image is available here, and may encourage some
users to see it, even if it's not easy to see it with their system.

If you specify the foreground color, background color, or backround image

This guideline applies to author and user stylesheet writing.
A particular attention must be ported to the weight of each rule. The most

Server side scripts are great. They're useful and quite transparent to the
end user.
But, server side scripts have drawbacks that must be weighted against
their benefits when compared to alternative reliable authoring strategies.
They're not obvious at first sight, but these drawbacks are real. They
negatively impact the server and the end user.

Server side scripts for extremely dynamic content, likely to change every
few seconds or depending on form requests (e.g. search features) are
perfectly fine.

But for static pages for which server side scripting would be used for
maintainance purposes, they've tradeoffs:
1) HTTP cache control. For example, conditional GET operations will always
think that documents have been changed and reload them.
This has a simple effect with most user agents: Everytime you navigate to
a page of the site, it's entirely reloaded (except for the back history,
with good browsers).

With static content, a conditional GET is performed (with good user
agents), which requires very small network resources, and returns a small
header indicating that the resource hasn't been changed. This greatly
reduces the client and server bandwidth used. If an adequate expiration
header is set, this conditional GET request can even be saved, sometimes!

In addition, if you use a HTTP proxy, it can cache the request.
This is useful for the end user if he has a better ping and bandwidth with
his HTTP proxy (e.g. ISP provided proxy) than with your server (this used
to be very true in the 1990's, but becomes less important nowadays). These
proxy will also reduce the number of requests to your site, especially if
it's very popular.

The HTTP cache control mechanism is really subtle. A large part of
RFC-2616 deals with it. Dynamic pages break that.

2) Typically, the server don't send a compressed stream for dynamic
resources even if the user agent declares a Accept-Encoding header
including gzip, compress or other compression algorithms.
Compression can reduce by 3 or 4 the file size! Both the server and client
benefit from this!

3) HTTP 1.1 partial downloading is very unlikely to work with dynamic
content. This does matter for big files only. Below 400 kilobytes, it's
not very important.

4) The Content-Length attribute won't be specified, though it can help the
user agent. e.g. User agents use it to display a progress bar and
automatically, or with user help, they may choose to stop downloading the
resource if it's too large or to use an alternative download manager.
Actually, the HEAD method looses of its usefulness if the Content-Length
attribute disappears.

Other minor detail: The Content-MD5 won't be provided while it could be
useful on unreliable connections.

Overall, I've always had a better browsing experience with static pages
than with dynamic pages thanks to the reduced and removed loading delays

Fortunately, it's possible to get a good authoring system, and yet,
benefit from static pages for pages that don't change every second.

There are several solutions.
The first one, is to write scripts (e.g. PHP programs) that generate files
and store them in appropriate places, with appropriate configuration
files, on the server.
Then, when things are modified, a master script would be launched. It
would simply generate all the pages from the scripts.

The second one is similar, but doesn't use scripts. It uses the SGML
authoring capabilities.
It's less powerful, but is sufficient is all you need is SSI and a good
management and versioning of individual files.

To do so, a tool is needed: An SGML normalizer. Ideally, it should be
configurable to normalize only what's required. For example, it should
expand entity references and marked sections (because they're not
supported by existing HTML user agents), but shouldn't close omitted tags.
The spam utility of SP is a good choice:
http://www.jclark.com/sp/

The HTML files would contain an document type definition defined by an
external and/or internal declaration subset.
Entities would be defined in external files shared by all the HTML
documents, or in the internal declaration subset. With OASIS catalogs, the
file management should be easy.
After having modified one or more file, you would just have to launch a
script applying the normalization to all the HTML files, and storing the
resulting files in the server directory.
That's a very simple batch job.

To benefit from this good authoring tool, you've to learn the basics of
SGML. As a HTML author, knowing SGML is a good thing.
The following site is a good introductory to SGML:
http://www.is-thought.co.uk/book/home.htm

Maybe I'll start a debate around server side scripting... I'm sure we
could learn more about the benefits and tradeoffs of server side scripting
with the insights of experts.

I don't really disagree with any of this, and especially not with your
suggestion to use HTML preprocessing rather than server-side scripting
if all that's wanted is a templating engine.

On the other hand, it is possible to use server-side scripting and

worthwhile for those pages that need to be dynamic but aren't

If a web page is above 400kb it could probably do with splitting

There's nothing to stop server-side scripts from doing:

Whether that's a sensible way to do things depends on the language. In
the scripting languages that encourage interleaving of code and HTML
tags (&lt;?php ?&gt;, &lt;% %&gt;, etc) it's probably fighting the paradigm too
much. In an XSLT or other document-tree based language or library then
it's pretty straightforward.

For some scripts it might not be appropriate to do this, of course.

This has performances tradeoffs for the server. That's why most dynamic

If Apache is clever enough not to recompress the file when the
Last-Modified header is set to a date older than Apache's cache for this
resource, than, it's perfectly fine.
If not, then, the performance cost will be acceptable on small and medium

milliseconds), so, the fact that the data is entirely pre-computed before
being sent isn't a problem. This is even more true for quasi-static pages,
for which the computation time is probably less than one millisecond.

&gt; Whether that's a sensible way to do things depends on the language. In
&gt; the scripting languages that encourage interleaving of code and HTML
&gt; tags (&lt;?php ?&gt;, &lt;% %&gt;, etc) it's probably fighting the paradigm too
&gt; much.

This is the main problem. Doing things correctly with server side scripts
is possible, but requires some knowledge and skill (that you've just
shown). Actually, server side scripting encourages poor cache control and
size information. This is why most dynamic pages on the web aren't very
good.

&gt;&gt; Other minor detail: The Content-MD5 won't be provided while it could
&gt;&gt; be  useful on unreliable connections.

&gt; I don't see this header even on static files. Maybe I just haven't
&gt; enabled it in the Apache config, though.

Yes, there's the ContentDigest directive.
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html.en#contentdigest
It isn't available for SSI or script documents.
Currently the values aren't cached. That's not nice.
Anyway, that's a detail.
If the Content-MD5 was supported by more servers, some user agent could
use it to prevent the re-loading of resources (e.g. small icons) that are
stored locally on many different web servers, even though they're
identical.

In conclusion:
It's possible to write good cacheable dynamic pages, without client-side
tradeoff, and with an acceptable server-side tradeoff. Sticking to static
pages may help inexperienced administrators to &quot;get it right&quot;.

For sites hosted by third party servers, other factors should be
considered:
Are some sort of scripting or SSI allowed?
If yes, how much scripting execution power do you get?
How much do you control the URI of the dynamic resources? For URI
stability and transparency, things like
http://www.somewhere.com/index.php?page=hello.html are not as good as
http://www.somewhere.com/hello .
How many requests do you expect to get every day?
What server is it and how much can you change its configuration?
e.g. The server may not support the compressed encoding for dynamic pages
or may not give access to the relevant configuration files.
