Why 2008 Will be a Perfect Storm for Republicans*
By Mark Green &lt; http://www.airamerica.com/user/591073 &gt; on October 15,

&lt; http://www.airamerica.com/7daysinamerica/ &gt;In hindsight, we can see why
incumbent parties have been blamed and creamed in federal elections,
like Republicans in 1974 after Watergate and Democrats in 1994 after the
failure of health care. Looking ahead, with 13 months to go, a perfect
storm is gathering force that will likely decimate Republican strength
in federal and state races.

There is no one earthquake producing a political tsunami but rather four
separate seismic events that together---short of another terrorist
attack or a new war against Iran---will alter the electoral terrain of
America.

*_Iraq_:* Consider the numbers: when asked who can best end the Iraq
war, only 5 percent of Americans in a recent poll said President Bush;
consistent majorities of 70 percent want the war to end soon and 60
percent believe Bush misled us into this conflict. Claims of progress
may momentarily quell public anger over this monumental blunder---say,
General Petraeus's putting a happy face on the war. But such optimism is
now as convincing as General Westmoreland's expecting &quot;light at the end
of the tunnel&quot; in Vietnam or Baghdad Bob's denying American troops were
anywhere near the Baghdad airport while those troops were seizing it.

What exactly can GOP candidates say next fall in the face of no WMD, no
link between Saddam and 9/11, no ties between Saddam and al Qaeda, no
flowers for &quot;liberators,&quot; 5 million refugees both out of and within
Iraq, Administration approval of torture, over 30,000 American dead and
wounded as well as over 100,000 Iraqis killed -- not to mention an
increase in terrorism world-wide? &quot;Give us more time&quot; for a war that's
lasted longer than World War II?

None of this worked in 2006 and will be even less pervasive in 2008. As
Senator Lindsay Graham (R-SC) recently acknowledged after a Senate vote
on the war, the public knows this is Bush's and the Republican's war and
will reward or punish candidates accordingly.

*_Economy_:* Most economic forecasters are predicting a one in two
chance of a recession due to the foreclosure crisis leading to a credit
crisis. Nor can Republican candidates convincingly cite Bush's
eight-year record if '08 goes flat. Average monthly job creation and
economic growth under Clinton was 237,000 and 3.6 percent; under Bush,
it's 53,000 and 2.6 percent. Even if there's no recession but merely a
slowdown, incumbent parties historically still lose seats and the White
House if economic growth falls below 3 percent in the election year, as
now seems inevitable.

At the same time, this Administration's record on spending and
deficits---turning a projected $5.6 trillion surplus into $3 trillion in
deficits---is dividing its own business base, according to Wall Street
Journal last week. Now when asked which party would better maintain
prosperity, it's Democrats by 54-34 percent according to Gallup.

And for the first time in several generations, the economic debate may
include not only growth but also distribution. Static median income over
the Bush years combined with winner-take-all increases in wealth by the
top 1 percent have not gone unnoticed. A Pew Poll in 1988 found that by
71 to 25 percent, Americans thought themselves &quot;haves&quot; rather than &quot;have
nots&quot;; by 2001, it was 48 to 48 percent. Any such data or arguments
provoke Republicans to shout, &quot;class warfare.&quot; But this is blaming the
mirror for the image. Can conservatives explain how ExxonMobil's Lee
Raymond earned more per hour in 2005 than his average employee earned
per year?

*_Intolerance_:* The GOP claiming to the &quot;party of Lincoln&quot; is a
pretense long beyond its expiration date. During the Cold War,
Republicans could successfully run against Reds and Blacks. Yet with the
decline of Communism and the Southern Strategy, GOP strategists have
instead turned to targeting terrorists, immigrants and gays. Hence all
those terror alerts and anti-gay referenda in 2004, and strident
anti-immigrant rhetoric in 2007. But can the GOP rely simply on white
men to win, blowing off racial and other minorities in a country
increasingly minority? Bush's small gain in the black vote from 8% in
2000 to 11% in 2004, including a pivotal 16% in Ohio, helped cement his
narrow victory.

The recent refusal of leading Republican presidential candidates to
attend key black, Latino and gay debates prodded former vice
presidential nominee Jack Kemp to complain, &quot;We sound like we don't want
immigration; we sound like we don't want black people to vote for us.
What are we going to do---meet in a country club in the suburbs one
day?&quot; It won't suffice any longer for 2008 convention organizers to put
every minority delegate on the stage, hoping pictures will substitute
for policy.

*_Children_: *President Bush made good on his threat to veto the
expansion of the SCHIP program to extend health insurance to another 4
million children, notwithstanding the bi-partisan support of 43
governors and an 84 percent majority in a CBS-/New York Times /poll. He
complains that such a move would federalize, even socialize, health
care. So will he now end Medicare and Medicaid?

Yes, it would cost another $35 billion annually, but that would be
entirely covered by a proposed increase in the tobacco tax. It's
revealing that an administration which didn't veto any spending bills
for six years and didn't sweat $50 billion in oil subsidies and $10
billion a month for Iraq now draws the line against providing health
care to children at no-cost to the federal budget. It approaches
political suicide for the Bush Administration and four top GOP
presidential candidates to elevate the rhetoric of free-market
fundamentalism over the reality of millions of children lacking health
insurance.

Pro-war and anti-growth, anti-minorities, anti-children. Not a good way
to run for election.

Beyond these four problems, a variety of other realities combine to dig
Republicans into an even deeper hole. Recent polls show Democrats are
more trusted on every domestic and foreign policy issue: education,
health care, environment, economic growth, fiscal discipline, even
terrorism. The number of Americans who self-identify as Republican is at
a seven year low. While Americans believing the country is &quot;on the wrong
tack&quot; was 50 percent in 2002 and 2004, it's now 67 percent. National
Democratic committees and presidential candidates are outraising their
Republican counterparts better than 2 to 1. And then there's the fact
that Republicans are defending 22 Senate seats in 2008 compared to 12
for the Democrats. Nine Republican Senate seats are now considered
vulnerable (Alaska, Colorado, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico,
Maine, Minnesota, Oregon and Virginia).

Adding it all up: look for Democrats to end up with a near
filibuster-proof 58 Senate seats (up from 51) and 260 House seats (up
from 213 in 2005 and 233 in 2007). The 2006 and 2008 elections would
then be the equivalent of a rolling realignment, comparable to the 51,
49 and 53 House seats that switched hands in 1958, 1974 and 1994
respectively. For when there's a tidal wave of sentiment, it doesn't tip
some close contests but nearly all close contests. What John Kenneth
Galbraith said of Black Monday 1933 is true for the GOP today: &quot;The end
had come, but it was not yet in sight.&quot;
