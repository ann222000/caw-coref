I was already aware that the use of Flash under Linux emulation is
accompanied by difficulties. However, I find that if I attempt to open
a Flash file using linux-firefox (which I'm using right now) it
immediately crashes, with the following output:

$ linux-firefox
Segmentation fault
$ Warning: Cannot convert string &quot;-adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-12-*&quot; to
type FontStruct
Warning: Cannot convert string &quot;-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-12-*&quot; to
type FontStruct

Is there any way to mitigate such problems? Or do we just have to hope
that Adobe will provide a native FreeBSD application?

&quot;Mitigate&quot; is a good word; there are a some things I do that make
such problems less annoying and less common, but there is nothing
that would count as a solution.  To start with, I install the
Flashblock extension, so that I don't get annoyed by Flash
displays unless I specifically want them (some bits of Flash
reliably cause problems, others reliably do not).  Also, different
versions of Flash give me different results on specific bits of
Flash code.

Incidentally, my experiences with Flash are not rock-solid under
Linux either, so waiting for Adobe to solve the problem for us
doe not look like a good option.

I don't bother with flash for FreeBSD as I have win, lin etc if I get
desperate to use it.

However an idea MAY be worth a try:
Copy a few common windows truetype fonts and set them up in firefox?...
