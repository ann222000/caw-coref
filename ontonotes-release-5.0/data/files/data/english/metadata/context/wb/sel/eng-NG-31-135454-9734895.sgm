10.3 hangs after hibernate

I installed 10.3 on a new box: ecs nforcem6-a, AMD X2 4800, evga geforce
8400gs video card (using the nvidia driver). It worked fine for a few
days, but now every time I hibernate it, when I restart it either hangs
with no response to kybd or mouse, or ksoftirqd and events take up
99.99% of CPU and are unkillable. I see nothing in /var/log/messages
that give me any clue as to what the problem is, so I'm at a loss what
might fix it. Suggestions appreciated.

If hibernate works.. you are very fortunate.  There are VERY FEW
laptop configurations that support it and there are too many variables
(probably) to assume this will change any time soon.

Suspend to disk should work though and might be a safer more
reliable alternative.  Give it a shot.

The kernel folks are actively working on power saving and suspension
issues, but I don't think there's an ETA for a &quot;works better&quot;
release yet.

If you must use hibernate, you might try NOT using the nvidia
driver and see if that makes things work.  Not saying it's
the root cause... so if that does work, don't necessarily
blame nvidia.

Sorry, my bad; it is suspend to disk I'm using, and this isn't a laptop.

I can't help you directly, but I am able to do suspend to disk on an old
Compaq Deskpro EN under SuSE 10.0 with a big caveat. Like you, it has no
problem suspending and resuming UNLESS I happen to have a USB stick (for
backups) mounted. When I try to resume with the USB stick, the system is
hardlocked so bad only a coldstart (power off/on) reboot fixes it.

Sorry I don't have any additional info; I've never gotten this fixed.

Hmmm... well, I've never tested it on anything but a laptop.
Kernel mail list does seem to indicate that there are some things
that aren't quite ready with regards to &quot;sleeping&quot; style operations
on desktops and servers... but can't say if this affects suspend
to disk or not.

Keep us posted if you discover anything.

I just turn mine off. Booting up is faster than trying to un-hibernate.

I find the same. However suspend to RAM works after a bit of
tinkering. (Seee http://en.opensuse.org/S2ram )

I find a restart after using the &quot;suspend to disc&quot; is a lot faster than
booting from cold.

As for &quot;suspend to ram&quot;, I wouldn't use that with a desktop system as
all it takes is a short power loss. Once that happens, all the contents
of memory is lost and so you end up having to restart from cold. With
laptops/notebooks, there is a battery supply to maintain the memory
contents and so a power loss can be endured for quite a few hours.

As for the OP, looking at:

&lt;URL: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/33... &gt;

it's possible that the problem is with the nVidia driver so, as Chris
Cox says, try without the nVidia driver and see if that works.

David Bolt

Yeach. I couldn't configure the nv driver not to give me a monitor that
flickered so bad that I'd have a headache after an hour's work.

And reading the whole thread you've linked to, it doesn't really sound
like the same problem to me. That thread had to do with never getting
video back after suspend or hibernate. I get video back, but the
computer quickly becomes unresponsive. Based on Harold's comment above,
I suspect this is more likely an issue with USB, though I haven't had
time to test that suspicion yet.

Meh, well, so much for my suspicions. All USB dongles disconnected, no
change.
