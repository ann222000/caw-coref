In the early fall of 1998, I remember being on a flight to
Bermuda from New York. I was upgraded and sat next to a very
distinguished looking gentleman. He was going to a conference
about re-insurance and I was going to speak at a large hedge fund
conference. We hit it off, and began a very interesting
conversation, one that still burns in my mind today. It turns out
that he was vice-chairman of one of the largest insurance firms
in the world, and was a real financial insider, seemingly knowing
every big name on Wall Street personally. After he had a few
drinks (he was clearly somewhat stressed), he began to talk about
the Long Term Capital Management fund and the problems in the
markets. He had had a ring side seat at the Fed-sponsored bailout
proceedings.

&quot;We came to the edge of the abyss in the financial markets this
week,' he told me, &quot;and then we looked over. The world does not
understand how close we came to a total meltdown of the
markets.&quot;

This week we look at the similarities and the differences between
the credit crisis that is going on today and what happened in
1998, take a quick look at the threat from China to the dollar
and see what exotic fish and exotic bonds have in common. There
is a lot of ground to cover, so let's jump right in.

China - Upping the Rhetorical Ante

Early this week the currency markets were roiled as not one but
two senior Chinese officials publicly advocated using China's
large dollar reserves as a political weapon should the US attempt
sanctions on Chinese goods if the renminbi is not valued higher
against the dollar. The two were senior officials at Chinese
think tanks. Shifts in Chinese policy are often signaled through
key think tanks and academics.

He Fan, an official at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
used uncharacteristically strong language, letting it be known
that Beijing had the power to set off a dollar collapse if it
choose to do so.

&quot;China has accumulated a large sum of US dollars. Such a big
sum, of which a considerable portion is in US treasury bonds,
contributes a great deal to maintaining the position of the
dollar as a reserve currency. Russia, Switzerland, and several
other countries have reduced their dollar holdings.

&quot;China is unlikely to follow suit as long as the Yuan's
exchange rate is stable against the dollar. The Chinese central
bank will be forced to sell dollars once the yuan appreciated
dramatically, which might lead to a mass depreciation of the
dollar,&quot; he told China Daily. (London Telegraph)

This comes as the US Congress will consider legislation that will
implement tariffs on Chinese goods if China does not revalue its
currency. Given the level of rhetoric from both political parties
and presidential candidates, it is no wonder that China is
finally responding with a little rhetorical shot of its own.
After smiling at the editorial cartoon below, let's look at the
likelihood of such an event.

China has an estimated $900 billion in US dollar reserves. There
is no doubt that if they did decide to sell a few hundred billion
here or there, they could push the dollar down against all
currencies and not just the renminbi. That would also have the
effect of increasing US interest rates on not just government
bonds, but mortgages, car loans and all sorts of consumer
credit.

Given the current state of the credit markets, that is not
something that would be welcome. But it is not likely for several
reasons. First, it is not in their best interests to do so. It
would hurt the Chinese as much as the US, as it would devalue
their entire dollar portfolio and clearly do damage to their
number one export market - the US consumer.

Secondly, it is unlikely that the US will actually be able to get
such legislation passed into law. Even if such legislation passed
Congress (an admitted possibility) it would be vetoed by
President Bush. That means that any real change would not be
possible until some time in the middle of 2009.

The renminbi has already dropped almost 10% in the last two years
since the Chinese started their policy of a crawling peg. For
reasons I outlined at length a few weeks ago, it is likely that
the Chinese are going to increase that pace over the next two
years, for their own internal reasons. A higher renminbi
valuation helps them slow their economy down from its way too
fast pace of growth that is evident today. (If you would like to
see that analysis, click here.)

By the time any real legislation could get passed, the renminbi
will be very close to the level where the China bashers in
Congress want to see it, if it is not already floating. Hardly
enough to want to start a trade war at that time.

But let's look at what the bi-partisan economic illiterates in
Congress are actually advocating. First, they whine about lost
American jobs. But a 25% higher renminbi is not going to bring
any manufacturing jobs back. China is no longer the low cost
labor market. There are other Asian countries with lower labor
costs. We just will not be able to competitively manufacture
products that have high unskilled labor costs.

But we will continue to manufacture high value added items in a
host of industries where skill and talent are required. Even
though manufacturing as a percentage of US GDP is down, our
actual level of exports and manufactured products is up by any
measure. It is easy to write about the closing of a plant, and it
makes the headlines, but the fact is that free trade has created
more jobs by far than we have lost.

Secondly, if our cost of imports were to rise by 20-25%, that
cannot be understood as anything but inflationary. And it would
not just be Chinese products, but the products of all developing
countries. Many Asian countries manage (manipulate) their
currencies to keep them competitive against each other and the
Chinese. You can bet that if the renminbi rises another 20%,
there is the real prospect that they all will.

And much of what China and the rest of Asia produces is bought by
those on the lower economic rungs of the US ladder. So, if
Congress gets its way, they would be advocating putting pressure
on those least capable of paying higher prices. But no one
lobbies for the little guy. Congressional members can pander to
their local unions and businesses without having to answer for
what would be higher prices.

And higher prices means more inflation which means that interest
rates have to be higher than they should, which means higher
mortgage rates, etc. Protectionism has a very high cost. Free
markets create more jobs everywhere.

Finally, we should hope the Chinese continue to allow their
currency to rise slow and steady. Neither country needs the
turmoil a rapid rise would induce. The world needs a stable
China. We are watching world credits markets freeze up because
things went very bad very quickly in the relatively small
subprime world. A 20% drop in the dollar in a few months would be
even more catastrophic. Senators Lindsey Graham and Chuck Schumer
are competing to be this century's Smoot and Hawley that creates
a depression from trade wars where none should be.

The danger in all this is that politicians who have little
economic literacy create a hostile environment with their
rhetorical poison, with both sides feeling the need to play to
their &quot;home crowd.&quot; That is a very dangerous environment.

It won't happen, but I would like to see the following question
asked in the presidential debates to those (like Hillary Clinton,
Obama and Dodd, etc.) who basically advocate a weaker dollar.

&quot;Why are you advocating a weak dollar policy? Why do you want
American wage earners to pay 25% more for the goods we buy from
foreign countries? Do you really think there is no connection
between the value of the Chinese currency and the rest of the
currencies of the world? Do you think American consumers need to
send even more money overseas and get less for our dollars? Do
you think the American consumer is so well off they can afford to
pay more and that it will have no affect on the US economy? Do
you realize that a 25% lower dollar will mean a rise in world oil
prices? Do you think there is no connection between the value of
the dollar and US prosperity?&quot;

I won't hold my breath.

Back to 1998

Let's get in the Wayback Machine and revisit 1998. (For
reference for my foreign readers, the &quot;Wayback Machine&quot;
originally referred to a fictional machine from a segment of the
cartoon The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show used to transport Mr.
Peabody and Sherman back in time.)

First, there was the Asian currency crisis and then Russia looked
like it would default on its debt, causing a crisis in the credit
markets. A hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management had
leveraged their bond positions about 80 to 1 based upon the
relationship between certain types of bonds always, emphasize
always, converging upon a certain price. They diversified on
bonds throughout the world as an &quot;extra&quot; protection.

Except that the markets in the fall of 1998 were not acting as
they had in the past. The relationships changed just a very small
amount, but if you are leveraged 80 to 1, then small is enough to
wipe you out. The Nobel Prize winners who designed the system
overlooked the possibility that the market could become
irrational.

Fast forward to 2007. Again, the credit markets are in turmoil,
and the subprime mortgage problems are spreading, as predicted
here last January. Let's look at some things that are similar to
1998.

First, normal relationships between certain types of bonds have
been turned on their head. For many companies who go into the
credit markets, there are different types of debt they sell.
Certain types of bonds or loans are considered &quot;senior&quot; because
in the event of the company going bankrupt, they get paid first.
Then debt that is subordinated to the senior debt gets paid, and
lastly the shareholders get to split what is left over, if
anything.

So, clearly, it stands to reason that senior debt is more
valuable than subordinated debt. Why would you pay more for the
riskier debt? So, if you want to put on a hedge, you can &quot;go
long&quot; the senior debt and &quot;go short&quot; the subordinated debt.
And in the past, that works.

Except not this time. There are a number of funds that are having
real problems and are being met with high redemptions because
they are exposed to the subprime markets. But no one is buying
the subprime debt, so they have to sell what they can to meet
redemptions. And what sells? The quality senior debt. At a
discount, of course.

So, if you are another fund holding that debt instrument that
just traded down, you just saw the value of your high quality
loan or bond drop. But because the subordinated debt you sold as
a hedge is not trading, there is not a price for it, so you
can't show the profit there should be on the pair trade. Your
fund is down for the month. Bummer.

Now, if you are not over-leveraged and forced to sell, you can
wait a few weeks or a month and the normal relationship will come
back. And you may even benefit as quality will rise even as the
riskier instruments fall. But until there is a price made on your
hedges, you cannot just make up a price based upon normal
rational markets.

And if you are in the lucky position of having cash, you can go
in and buy very good debt at a fire sale price today. There are a
lot of debt instruments of very good and profitable companies
that is on the market for much less than what it will be in a few
months when things get back to normal. And if you are a company
with cash, you may be able to go back in and buy your debt at a
discount.

The End of the Quantitative World

I should first note that the average hedge fund made money in
July, and some did quite well. There are a number of hedge fund
strategies that have the potential to benefit in this type of
environment. That being said, if a fund has invested in the
subprime mortgage space (unless they are short), they are losing
money. It is easy to see the relationship between the subprime
mess and the funds that invested in it. But there are other funds
which are losing money, and the connection to the subprime
markets is less clear.

There are any number of statistical relationships which have
simply not functioned as they have in the past. Large
quantitative hedge funds that employ teams of mathematicians and
physicists to develop complex &quot;black box&quot; trading programs to
computer trade on these relationships are finding themselves
losing money. As Spencer Jakab writes:

&quot;Quantitative hedge funds running 'black box' models are
primarily market neutral, seeking to exploit small inefficiencies
in valuations and historical volatility between similar
securities. A period like the last few weeks would have typically
seen such funds outperform most of their peers in the hedge-fund
community, but they have instead shocked investors with steep
losses.

&quot;Because risk managers were able to demonstrate that they were
less risky, on paper at least, they were allowed to use far more
borrowed money than other leading hedge fund strategies. Some are
clearly overextended. 'The inherent leverage is killing them,'
said a broker at a major investment bank who deals with hedge
funds.&quot;

&quot;Analyst Matthew Rothman of Lehman Brothers wrote that the
models are working in exactly the opposite way they should to
protect a black box fund in an up or down market. 'It is not
just that most factors are not working but rather they are
working in a perverse manner,' wrote Rothman. 'The names that
are short are outperforming, often notably, while the names that
are long are underperforming, although less severely.'&quot;

Goldman's Global Alpha, which has been losing money for two
years, is down 26% for the year and down almost 40% since the end
of July. It is not surprising they are being hit with
redemptions. And that forces them to sell. Many of the largest
hedge funds are the very quantitative funds that are being forced
to sell, putting pressure on the markets.

In 1998 problems in Asia and Russia spread to the rest of the
markets, affecting Norwegian bonds and US stocks. It took a few
months to sort out, and a lot of people lost money. Today,
problems in the subprime mortgage markets spread to other credit
markets and the affect is spilling over into stock markets.

But there is a difference. Today, instead of one fund that was at
the epicenter of the problem, the problems are spread around the
world among scores of funds and permeate the largest
institutional and pension funds. While that means the losses are
spread among thousands of investors, it also means that central
banks can't bring everyone to the table to &quot;fix&quot; the problem.

The problem of the last two days was triggered by BNP Paribas
telling investors in three of their funds that they would not be
allowed to redeem. This simply froze the European markets. The
European Central Bank has injected $211 billion into their
system. Central banks have put $339 billion into the world system
in the last 48 hours. And you should be very glad they did, by
the way.

I heard on TV that some are saying the Fed is bailing out banks.
Not they way I read it. They are simply taking short term
&quot;repo&quot; paper for a few days to inject liquidity. If you are
going to have a central bank, then this is a proper action. The
fact that the excess liquidity which produced the bubbles can be
laid at the Greenspan Federal Reserve's feet is a topic for
another day.

And while we are on the topic, I think BNP Paribas probably did
the right thing. They have funds which have invested in all sorts
of credit vehicles. Nothing is trading, so if they tried to meet
redemptions, they would have to sell assets at much distressed
prices, and then guess at what prices the other assets should be
valued at in the absence of a market price. If they guessed to
little, then those exiting would lose too much, notice their
losses were too high and sue. If they guessed too high, then
those remaining would notice that they lost more than they should
have and then sue. BNP was in a no win situation. To be fair to
all investors, they have to wait until the market prices the
assets in their portfolio.

They have not said what those assets are. If they are not US
mortgage related it is likely they will turn out ok. If there is
subprime in the mix, they will take significant losses.

Subprime for a Long Time

And one last difference between 1998 and today. Back then, the
problems in the markets became known and were priced into the
markets in relatively short order. It is going to be several
years before we know the extent of the subprime losses. Remember
the table that I used last week which showed the bulk of subprime
mortgage interest rate resets was not until the first half of
2008. It is going to take years for the markets to know what the
losses on the subprime will actually be.

And it is not as if it should be a total surprise. Any investor
can go to their Bloomberg and pull up a listing of subprime
Residential Mortgage Backed Securities. There are 2,512 of them.
If you sort by the ones with the most loans over 60 days past
due, you find that the average RMBS has 12.39% of their mortgages
over 60 days, and 2.39% have already been repossessed (REO in the
next table), with almost 5% in foreclosure.

The table below shows the RMBS with the highest level of 60 day
past due (or worse) mortgages in them. Yes, the worst two
offenders are the 2006 vintage of RMBS. But notice that a lot are
from 2000, 2001, 2003 and earlier, well before the supposedly lax
standards of the past few years. The third listed RMBS, the INHEL
2001-B is selling at 18 cents on the dollar (you can't see this
from the table), and has been dropping since 2003. Over 25% of
the mortgages in that portfolio have already been repossessed or
are in foreclosure, with another 25% past due for over 60 days.
Can you say ugly?

But you can also find paper from 2001 that is not doing badly. It
should be clear to anybody who did a little due diligence a few
years ago that there were problems in the subprime RMBS markets.
There was a great deal of difference in the quality of various
offerings. So it paid you to do some homework. If you could not
get transparency, then you were taking a gamble.

That being said, many of the European and Asian institutions who
bought this paper relied on the credit rating agencies. They
relied on the models built by the investment banks that put this
paper together. As I have written, they sold their AAA rating but
put legal language buried in the documents that basically said,
&quot;OK, this is not what we mean by AAA in our other ratings.&quot; The
document for the RMBS mentioned above was 300 pages of fine
print. I will bet you that the vast majority of people buying
this paper did not read it or understand what they were reading
if they did.

You can bet lawyers all over the world will look at this same
screen I show below. They are then going to ask the bankers and
credit agencies how they could put such a high rating on the
paper seeing the problems in these securities? &quot;Really, you
didn't look at the lending standards?&quot; It's all hindsight, of
course. But that's what lawyers do. And in front of a jury, it
will be a tough day for the banks and credit agencies.

And let's close with a few paragraphs written by my friend and
partner Jon Sundt of Altegris Investments. I think this is one of
the better pieces I have seen looking at the complex environment
we are in today. Most of the press tends to greatly oversimplify
and lump all funds, banks and bonds into one category, when the
truth is there is a lot of difference. Full disclosure, Jon and I
and the rest of my international partners are in the business of
finding hedge funds for clients, so we have both an inside view
into what is going on, as well as a clear bias. I am proud of the
job that Jon and his team have done and happy to be associated
with them. That being said, let's read Jon's take on the
situation.

The Fugu Ultimatum

&quot;Indeed, if you look at the indices for different hedge fund
strategies out there, you will find a large dispersion of results
for July, with some strategies gaining money and some losing
money. The differences between a long/short US manager, a
multi-strategy Asia manager, and a leveraged CDO manager are too
numerous to mention in this article, but the press would have you
believe that these managers are all bound together.

&quot;Let me reinforce my point with a basic but very appropriate
analogy. In Japan, there is a distinctive puffer fish called the
Fugu. It is served in special sushi restaurants by master chefs.
Fugu tingles in your mouth when you eat it. It is supposed to be
an exotic aphrodisiac in Japan, where diners spend hundreds of
dollars a serving to eat it. The problem is that eating Fugu can
kill you. There is an old saying in Japan, 'I want to eat Fugu,
but I don't want to die.' People have been known to literally
drop dead in sushi bars from cardiac arrest and pulmonary failure
if the Fugu they ate wasn't prepared correctly. You have to be a
specially trained and licensed Fugu chef to prepare and serve it.
Personally, I would want to see the stats of the chef before
eating Fugu...just a simple 'number of customers killed' would
work for me.

&quot;Now imagine a family in your town called the Griswolds. (You
may remember them from the National Lampoon 'Vacation' films.)
Suppose for their next trip, the Griswolds decide to travel to
Japan and pursue some gastronomical thrills and eat the infamous
Fugu. So they do some cursory research, march into a Tokyo Fugu
restaurant, plunk down $1,000 and order a huge plate of Fugu. And
die on the spot.

&quot;The next morning as you sit at your breakfast table sipping
coffee, you read the following headline:

&quot;LOCAL FAMILY DIES EATING EXOTIC POISONOUS FISH IN TOKYO&quot;

&quot;You think to yourself, no problem... you continue sipping
coffee... and maybe mutter... 'They should have known better.'

&quot;Now imagine instead that you read the following headline:

&quot;LOCAL FAMILY DIES IN FISH RESTAURANT&quot;

&quot;Your reaction may be very different. You are likely going to
cancel your reservation at the local sushi bar until you hear
more. What if all fish are tainted? Or is it just that
restaurant? Or is it a specific type of fish? You'll have lots
of questions, and you might assume, until you know more, that no
fish are worth eating.

&quot;My point is that events like these and potential losses should
not come as a surprise to knowledgeable and well-educated
investors, whether in Bear Stearns' funds (the current focal
point of media attention) or other funds. The name of one of the
Bear Stearns' funds was 'The High-Grade Structured Credit
Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund.' If this name alone didn't
suggest possible concentrations in potentially high-risk
investments, I don't know what would. According to one Citibank
report, the fund at one point was 80:1 leveraged! In March of
this year, the subprime story was all over the news. At a time
when most news sources were already talking about interest rate
increases hurting subprime borrowers, Bear Stearns appears to
have been marketing a fund that invested in illiquid/exotic
mortgage credit instruments with high levels of leverage.

&quot;While I don't personally know the full details behind the
reasons Bear sponsored this fund, it is clear in my mind that
investors seem to have been taken by surprise as to what they had
invested in. As I see it, and to return to my analogy, this fund
may have been serving up large plates of Fugu to investors
clamoring for a bite. The 'diners' appear to have either been
unaware of the risks, or more likely, had not seriously
considered what could, and in fact did, go wrong.

&quot;Not all CDOs have danger written all over them, but those
backed by subprimes would, with the benefit of hindsight, seem to
have been quite clearly headed for trouble. It is a very narrow
and specialized breed of hedge fund that trades in such a space.
Like a sushi 'Fugu' bar, such investing is not typical of all
hedge funds. That doesn't mean there aren't billions of dollars
exposed to it... it just means it isn't your everyday long/short
hedge fund.&quot;

90 Years and Still Going Strong

It's time to hit the send button. Tomorrow is my mother's 90th
birthday. She is still going strong, with two new knees and two
new hips. She had an amazing and difficult life. Born on a
Mississippi cotton farm, she joined the Women's Army Corp (yes,
my mother wore combat boots) and met my Texan Dad in Europe. Dad
became an alcoholic when I was young and mother had to assume the
responsibility for many years to support three kids until Dad
joined AA and was able to work steadily again.

She never complained. She just met her life with a simple faith
and trust. I remember getting up every morning in Bridgeport,
Texas. In the winter we would stand shivering in front of the
Dearborn gas heater while she read the daily bible passage. I
learned to work watching her, and learned to love to read when
our TV died and we were too poor to have it fixed. Life was
good.

I leave for Europe in ten days. After meetings in London and a
speech in Copenhagen for Jyske Bank, I am going to visit Poland
and the Czech Republic, two countries that I have wanted to visit
for a long time. It will be fun to be tourist for ten days and
lots of new friends to meet.

I usually like to read sci-fi when I am on vacation, but there is
not a lot that interests me now that I have not already read. So,
I will do some more serious reading. I will pack The Black Swan.
I am going to look for a biography of George Washington. And I am
looking for another biography or two to take as well. I am open
to suggestions.

Have a good week. And remember that family and friends are the
most valuable credit you can have.

Your planning on making it to 90 and beyond myself analyst,
