First, the participants in this little scene: Fluffy, senior female in the
clowder and a confirmed druggie - medium size, old, and not given to
sharing; Brünhilde, large and young female; Avery, middle age male and
larger than Fluffy; other cats (Tigger, Spooky, Sieglinde); and a
flowering top from a wild Nepeta cataria (catnip, catmint) plant growing
alongside my driveway.

There are several catnip plants growing along the edge of my driveway and
in the crack between the driveway and the patio.  Yesterday afternoon I
was trimming the grass and weeds around the patio and accidentally cut
down one of the catnip plants.  No biggie, I thought: the cats don't think
much of it anyway, not compared to the dry commercial product.  Later,
after dark, I went back to take the remains in and try it again ... it was
missing.  So, I broke off a flowering top from another plant and took it
back inside to compare with a description and picture I had found - yep,
Nepeta cataria alright.

Fluffy was in the kitchen paying me no never mind and I decided to try it
again: I crushed up the flower top and was almost overwhelmed by the odor.
I threw it on the floor between us and called Fluffy.  She ambled over
to see what I wanted, but stopped to investigate the new green thing on
the floor - she stuck her nose down to it and immediately jerked back in a
&quot;Whoa!&quot; response, rather like a druggie who has just discovered The Good
Stuff.

She then approached it more cautiously several times, each time getting a
bit closer.  Then she changed.  She became like a cat with fresh prey.

By this time, several of the other players in this scene had gathered and
surrounded her a couple of feet away.  Fluffy charged Avery and lashed out
at him with her paw, then went back to sniffing the catnip.  After a
minute or so of that, Brünhilde stretched out her neck to take a sniff
without actually moving close to Fluffy - Fluffy was having none of it:
she lashed out at Brünhilde and in the process, knocked the catnip over
to beside Brünhilde, who immediately started sniffing it herself.  Fluffy
was left in the middle of the floor going &quot;What to do? What to do?&quot; -
Brünhilde is much larger than she is, but she *really* wanted that catnip
back.  After a few seconds - not long enough for Brünhilde to get
possessive about it, Fluffy drove Brünhilde away and settled down with
the catnip between her paws.  The other cats who had been watching this
whole thing, decided they weren't going to get a chance at it, so they
just left.

I left it at that since I had to go to bed. Fluffy never did come to bed,
but some time later, Fleagor did (most unusual) and acted way too
lovey-dovey to be in his right mind. This morning, the catnip was on the
other side of the kitchen floor and looked like it had been stomped on and
rolled in.  I think that little bit of green had quite the night.

I bought the girls a fresh catnip plant once and to my surprise they
totally ignored it after the first day...
when it was starting to die, I pulled all the leaves off it and put
them into a cardboard box and suddenly it was flavour of the month!
There's just no accounting for feline tastes...

I did this once I bought one of the strongest versions of valerian let the
plants grow   the fur balls never paid any attention to it.  The one day I
was gone all day they eat the plants and were bouncing off the walls for two

In our house there would have been nothing left but stoned cats.  They eat
fresh catnip.  If we bring in a plant the demolish it and then devour it and
they roll in the spilled dirt.  If I ever get another camera I'll post a
picture of my latest attempt at growing catnip.  I found a nice plant and
repotted it.  Then I got some florist stakes and some wire at Michaels and
built a cage around the plant.  The pot is in a wrought iron plant stand and
the plant is in the cage so it should be safe provided I keep it watered.
The tops budded a few days ago and I pinched the buds off and dropped them.
Jake appeared out of nowhere and scarffed them down.

Lovely story, Ted.
Kitty Farmcat shows no response to catnip - pity, it might mellow her a bit
;-) and Boyfie is only an occasional imbiber.  When he is inclined to take
notice of it it makes him roll around the floor and drool.

Ours are stoners too--here's what's left after they took turns rolling and
laying in their catnip garden:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First, the participants in this little scene: Fluffy, senior female in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clowder and a confirmed druggie - medium size, old, and not given to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sharing; Br|nhilde, large and young female; Avery, middle age male and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; larger than Fluffy; other cats (Tigger, Spooky, Sieglinde); and a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; flowering top from a wild Nepeta cataria (catnip, catmint) plant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; growing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alongside my driveway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are several catnip plants growing along the edge of my driveway
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the crack between the driveway and the patio.  Yesterday afternoon I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was trimming the grass and weeds around the patio and accidentally cut
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; down one of the catnip plants.  No biggie, I thought: the cats don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much of it anyway, not compared to the dry commercial product.  Later,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after dark, I went back to take the remains in and try it again ... it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; missing.  So, I broke off a flowering top from another plant and took
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back inside to compare with a description and picture I had found -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yep,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nepeta cataria alright.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fluffy was in the kitchen paying me no never mind and I decided to try
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; again: I crushed up the flower top and was almost overwhelmed by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; odor.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I threw it on the floor between us and called Fluffy.  She ambled over
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to see what I wanted, but stopped to investigate the new green thing on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the floor - she stuck her nose down to it and immediately jerked back
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Whoa!&quot; response, rather like a druggie who has just discovered The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stuff.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; She then approached it more cautiously several times, each time getting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bit closer.  Then she changed.  She became like a cat with fresh prey.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By this time, several of the other players in this scene had gathered
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; surrounded her a couple of feet away.  Fluffy charged Avery and lashed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at him with her paw, then went back to sniffing the catnip.  After a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minute or so of that, Br|nhilde stretched out her neck to take a sniff
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without actually moving close to Fluffy - Fluffy was having none of it:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she lashed out at Br|nhilde and in the process, knocked the catnip over
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to beside Br|nhilde, who immediately started sniffing it herself.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fluffy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was left in the middle of the floor going &quot;What to do? What to do?&quot; -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Br|nhilde is much larger than she is, but she *really* wanted that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; catnip
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back.  After a few seconds - not long enough for Br|nhilde to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possessive about it, Fluffy drove Br|nhilde away and settled down with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the catnip between her paws.  The other cats who had been watching this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whole thing, decided they weren't going to get a chance at it, so they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just left.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I left it at that since I had to go to bed. Fluffy never did come to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bed,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but some time later, Fleagor did (most unusual) and acted way too
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lovey-dovey to be in his right mind. This morning, the catnip was on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other side of the kitchen floor and looked like it had been stomped on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rolled in.  I think that little bit of green had quite the night.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; T.E.D. (tda ... @umr.edu)

&gt;&gt;&gt; I did this once I bought one of the strongest versions of valerian let
&gt;&gt;&gt; the plants grow   the fur balls never paid any attention to it.  The one
&gt;&gt;&gt; day I was gone all day they eat the plants and were bouncing off the
&gt;&gt;&gt; walls for two days

&gt;&gt; We have a catnip warning system around here.  So no one will make the
&gt;&gt; mistake of doing something really dumb like petting a nipped out cat.  Or
&gt;&gt; heaven forbid rubbing a nipped out belly.  Even if the cat is sprawled in
&gt;&gt; the middle of the bed on its back with its paws every which way and
&gt;&gt; appears to be unconscious.

Well, the tortie cat certainly seems to have taken ownership of the
&quot;garden&quot;, but the stripey one looks more maniacal. Is that one a boy?
Males seem to get more affected by the stuff. All three of my cats love
nip, but Licky is the one who gets particularly deranged by it. He
could lie around all day on the patch of carpet where I had put it down,
licking the rug.

I found a special waterer for high plants: a bottle with a *long* rigid
plastic tube bent over at the end.  Squeezing the bottle sent a stream of
water out the end of the tube.  Still, since the catnip was hanging near
the kitchen light fixture over the kitchen table, I still had to climb a
ladder and take it down for watering and draining afterward.

You can harvest and dry the catnip.  Just cut the stalk off at the
bottom of the plant, tie several stalks together with string, then
hang it somewhere like an out-building or shed until it is dry.  After
drying, crumble the leaves into a baggie and discard the stem.  You
could even save some of the seeds and plant it somewhere you want it
to grow--preferably in a large container because it does spread
quickly by dropping it's own seeds.

I had a plant that was three feet tall by three feet wide.  Bees love
it so it will help the bee population by feeding them, and help your
other plants by drawing the bees to your yard.

Actually, all three are girls but the tabby is definitely a different
personality.  She's younger and much more territorial--she growls at the
garbage man and the UPS man.  Too funny. That was her first catnip session.

Here's the tortie as a kitten--one of her early binges:

I used to do this, but it would take 2-3 weeks to completely dry out
enough to be crushed into a powder. Then I discovered that I could
accomplish the same thing by microwaving the leaves for 10 minutes!
Presto - instant Catnip Concentrate. My kitties like the fresh leaves,
but pulverized dead leaves are apparently a lot more potent.

There's the catch.  You are better equipped than we are.  Functioning knees
are a gift not appreciated as much as they should be while they last.

Charlie and I routinely sit around a scheme how to get jobs that require
climbing or kneeling of any sort done.

Latest is a garden bed I had a big flowering quince taken out of.  It was
pushing the fence down and I was afraid the thorns were going to nail Kayla
or the cats.  Now I have a space with three sorts of potting mix dumped in
and a new bush sitting nearby.  All it needs is someone who can actually
push a shovel into the dirt with their foot to mix them together.

So its bribe the 18 year old, who is seldom home anymore, convince the 9
year old its fun, or wait two weeks (or more) for the touring garden guy to
show up.
