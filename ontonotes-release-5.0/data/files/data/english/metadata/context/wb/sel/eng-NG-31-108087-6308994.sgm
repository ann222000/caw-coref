My knees are still shaking, do you ever get over it? Anyhoo, I was
going to Walmart anyway and the HD dealer is right next door so
I said what the heck. I looked em over and thought the big
Sportster was more my cup of tea with a decent sized tank.
All fuel injected this year. I think the guy may have been a little
offended when I said I was thinking about a puttin bike for when I
wanted to take it easy. When I'm on the Ducati, I'm on the throttle,
I can't help it. I might test one out when it warms up a bit, looks
like it might be a fun ride. Anybody got one of those?

I got one!  Well, sort of.  My wife says it's hers.  ;)

Got some photos and write-ups about the bike on my Website at
http://xidos.ca ("B.C. Interior Trip", "Yellowknife Trip" and
"Sportster's Maiden Voyage" links).

And hers is a '05 1200C - not the fuel-injected 2007 model - but
pretty much the same thing as the one you sat on.  Fuel injection is
probably a good improvement on the Sportster.  Reliable, easy
starting, no warm-up required and more power too.

The engine is rubber-mounted, which results in a vibration-free ride -
even at highway speeds.  No numb-hands problem.  With the good fuel
economy it has, the gas tank is large enough for touring - my wife's
has the same range as my Road Glide.

The bike is a little more top-heavy than the big twin models so, in
slow-speed maneouvering, the big twins do handle somewhat better.  But
the light weight is real nice - especially for the usual parking tasks
and such.

Plenty of stuff you can do to customize the bike too, since it's a
Harley.  Hers is the 1200C (custom) and came standard with forward
controls and lotsa chrome.  Got some good saddle bags, a touring seat,
sissy bar, luggage rack and a quick-detach windshield added to my
wife's bike and it's excellent for multi-day, long trips.  Very
comfortable for her size, but too small for me to sit on it for long
periods in comfort.

Simple to maintain and work on, you can get the Service Manual from HD
written to apply to the same year as your bike.  I like that aspect.

In terms of retained value, resale-wise, you will take more of a
beating with a Sportster than with a big twin.  Big twins retain their
value better.  But if a Sportster fits the bill for you, that
shouldn't be a prohibitive negative.  You buy the bike for yourself,
primarily.

The warranty is quite decent (2 years, unlimited miles and the option
to purchase a longer term), and supplies of parts and service in the
Harley world are probably the best around, in my opinion.

A friend of mine is a cruiser type.  She's 'inseam challenged' so she
likes a low seat, but more than that she feels standards are 'tippy'
and top-heavy.  She's admired Harleys for a long time and began asking
me all kinds of questions--'cos I'm a guy and I know what 'cams' are
and I can tell at sight how many cylinders a bike has and whether it's
water- or air-cooled, something she apparently isn't able to do.

Finally I suggested we rent a Harley for a day and take it on a long
ride, switching off between the Harley and her Honda Magna.  This was
not a Sportster, it was a Softail Heritage Classic.

Based on that (scant) experience, I can tell you, sitting on a Harley
is one thing, handling it in traffic and on the road is something very
different.  I'm still not a cruiser person, and I still think Harleys
are way way overpriced, but I have to say I was very pleased with the
bike.  Because of the low seat, it handles its weight very well, it
was delightfully easy to  handle.  It does vibrate but the vibrations
are low-frequency and not objectionable at all, more like a massage!
It doesn't accelerate like most modern bikes, but it's very
comfortable once you get up to speed.  It was very stable and
comfortable on the freeway and I got the feeling I could ride it all
day.

I was unhappy, though, about the placement of the feet.  The Softail
has floorboards instead of pegs, so you have to lift your feet up off
them to shift or use the rear brake, and with them out in front like
that, this is not easy.  The handlebars are way too high, about even
with my nipples, and I found this very uncomfortable too.  I suppose
I'd get used to those things eventually, but when I got back onto my
own bike (ST1100) it felt SO GOOD!

I realized almost immediately what cruisers are all about.  They're
not about aggressive acceleration or handling, they're not about
dancing on a twisty mountain road.  They're about cruuuuuuiiiissing,
taking it easy, enjoying the ride and the view with relatively little
effort.  More like a Cadillac than an Acura.  Though I could really
appreciate its good points, it is not the bike for me.

I know the Sportster is probably very different.  I do notice that
Sportsters don't seem to hold their value like their big brothers.
You see a lot of fairly new Sportsters, 2-3-4 years old, on Craigslist
and EBay, and I assume this is not because they're just crappy bikes
and people hate them, but because these people want to trade up to a
Dyna or a Softail or a Fat Boy or something like that.

We may rent a Sportster next.  But even if I LOVE it,, I still think
they're overpriced.

Seems to me that may be partly because, men over 6' tall, the bike is
a bit small.  I feel sort of cramped on it.  For shorter guys (and
most women), it's just right though.

Makes you wonder why they didn't do it sooner. The last Sporty I
rode was in 74. I had about 2 years on my Honduh CL350 and a buddy
bought the HD new, had about 300 miles on her and threw me the
keys for a ride. It was exciting but I didn't go far, I was afraid of
stalling it out. Me and my buddies watched his kick starting routine
and his knee slowly get worse and worse. He limped badly for quite
awhile. Once during that period some gas station guy was admiring it
and bumped the key, turning it off. He hobbled after the guy as fast as
he could but fortunantly was unable to catch him.

I have other bikes for the long range stuff. I rode for a Vrod a few
years back and decided it wasn't a day long cruiser either but was
really impressed with the power plant. That motor in a cruiser
would probably be nice.

I'll bet stuff like that is also largely a matter of what you've grown

Yep, I think the reduced resale on the Sportsters results mainly from
the fact that they are often an inbetween bike, on the way to a big
twin.  Also, the fact that they are in the lower price range when new,
makes it more tempting to bypass the used ones, so their prices drop.

The 883 *is* a girl's bike. Now, the Sportster 1200 looks like a different
story. If I didn't buy Cathy the 883L, and waited until the 1200L came out
this year. I'd be riding it. What a nice bike. Such classic looks.
So cool.

I want one.

Not got one, but I've ridden a couple. Good for what they're designed to do,

I find them a bit short on the ground clearance, so decking out the pegs is
too easy. I have to admit that the NEW Sportster designed for the European
market looks bloody good though.

Close to 100 bhp, better ground clearance, sharper steering head angle, MUCH
better brakes than any other Harley and looks very reminiscent of the 750
flat tracker. I'll be having a test ride on one when the weather is
conducive and they're in the dealers.

Keep one thing in mind. When you've been away from bikes
for a long time, or haven't ridden one before, or haven't ever
been on a larger one, the ones in the showroom ALWAYS
feel like monsters.  There's no such thing as a "big"
Sportster, although it might have felt that way when you
sat on it. In fact, many serious Harley riders don't even consider
the Sportster series to be "real" Harleys.

Ever wonder why you see a long line of used 650's and 750's
for sale in front of a dealership? Most of those are first bikes,
where somebody bought one of those "huge" bikes, got used
to it, then traded up to the 1200-1500-2000 cc bike he should
have bought in the first place.

After looking at that Harley, go sit on a Kawasaki Vulcan
1500 or 1600, or a Suzuki Boulevard C90 or M109.

Not sure, but I think it will be. Harley apparently carried out an exercise
to see what the European riders would like from a Harley, as their normal
range doesn't sell in huge numbers.

Of course, there's a hard core band of Harleyisti, but the young guys aren't
getting into them like Harley would like, so they asked the question and
built the bike. The general consensus was that the bike should be close to
100bhp (or more) not be tank-like in weight, have good handling around
corners and look cool too, so came the re-birth of the flat tracker style.

It's based around a fuel injected Sportster 1200 motor with higher
compression than usual for a Harley, has "normal" sized wheels (17" so the
tyre choice isn't limiting), but I can't remember the bloody name, although
I believe there's an "X" in the name somewhere.

The XR1200 is the bike you fellas are talking about.  I'm considering
checking one out, if it's available stateside.  I'm wondering if a
Japanese manufacturer will chime into this market after Harley takes the
plunge?  I'm sure, the bike would be lighter/cheaper if they do.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just about to make the observation that most Sporty riders
&gt;&gt; these days are women. Especially since the advent of the 883, the
&gt;&gt; Sportster has been increasingly looked upon as a chick bike by the

&gt; The 883 *is* a girl's bike. Now, the Sportster 1200 looks like a different
&gt; story. If I didn't buy Cathy the 883L, and waited until the 1200L came out
&gt; this year. I'd be riding it. What a nice bike. Such classic looks.
&gt; So cool.

You'll want an XR 1200, I can all but guarantee it.

Harley are going after an established market with the XR 1200. It's the
"Bandit" arena where the bikes are not ultra modern, not ultra fast, not
ultra brilliant on handling, but not BAD either, something Harley are
associated with over here (slow, lumpy, shite handling, bad stopping old
farts bikes).

Their aim is to get at the younger Europeans and turn them on to Harley's
before they reach pension age and it looks like they're going to do it, by
grabbing a section of those who's look hard at the Triumph Scrambler, Duc
Monster, Suzuki Bandit 1200, Moto Guzzi "Sportsbike" etc.

The Japs will have to work hard to dominate in the big thumper market which
they don't seem to have managed yet.

I'm sure they could get 100 bhp, but I reckon reliablity issues would crop
up. Torque is still THE best way to go for road riding anyway, so it makes
sense to have acres of torque and a few bhp less than "optimum" so you're
not forever banging up and down the gearbox. Which is furtunate in the
XR1200's case as the geabox is reputedly it's weak point, being unable to
shift quickly. (And having a few false neutrals)

Yep, you got a keeper.   :-)

IMHO, smaller bikes are fun to mess with.  I would have no problems
traveling the trails on the Navajo Reservation with my little CB100,
low piped version of the CL100 trails.

Again IMHO, these smaller Japanese and British bikes were meant to go
places that most of the modern stuff would have difficulty handling.
One can still get new parts for the early '70's 6 Volt version of the
CB100 and CB125's from Indonesia.

Thanks for the clarification, I remembered it was something like that

for 883 retrofit had specially domed pistons to help keep the
compression ratio the same.  That boring by machine shop tells me it
is probably not that expensive to do, if he finds a decent shop.

Being that I like to wrench and do all my own repairs, I might find
myself getting a used 2004 Sportster 883 with the vibration isolator
engine mounts in the future, since they depreciate.  Then do my own
updating to 1200.

Seems that there are so many reasonably priced accessories for the
Sportster, which makes them very customisable.  Also there is nothing
negative about something that is so well supported.

I don't mind drifting to the dark side.   :-)

Two ways to go.
Bore out the cylinders which makes the bike lighter and costs less but
leaves a thinner cylinder wall which, as I am told, allows less heat
dissipation.

Buy new jugs which costs more and makes the bike heavier but allows
normal heat dissipation.

Both bikes will outperform the stock 1200.

Personally I would do the bore and use high compression pistons.
I would prefer to get the jugs and bore them out too.  :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.realclassic.co.uk/cubclub/cubclub01.jpg

&gt;&gt;&gt; Triumph Cub is no slouch.

&gt;&gt; That's an amazing ad. That IS my Cub. Only mine came with a clock
&gt;&gt; and a tach. They offered that for only one year. Thanks, HPT.

&gt;Yep, you got a keeper.   :-)

&gt;IMHO, smaller bikes are fun to mess with.  I would have no problems
&gt;traveling the trails on the Navajo Reservation with my little CB100,
&gt;low piped version of the CL100 trails.

&gt;Again IMHO, these smaller Japanese and British bikes were meant to go
&gt;places that most of the modern stuff would have difficulty handling.
&gt;One can still get new parts for the early '70's 6 Volt version of the
&gt;CB100 and CB125's from Indonesia.

I was just down in Mexico for a week and I was talking with another
H-D owner there and we agreed it would be a lot of fun to rent a
scooter (150 cc) or small bike to bomb around town.

Yup, came home on Saturday.  :-)

If it's any consolation, it rained once during the day and the
temperatures were only in the 80s for the most part plus we got quite
a wind blowing in off the gulf.
