&gt; Hello My Dear Friends, Please pray for my

&gt; pre-cancerous cells on her cervix but they removed
&gt; them. Please pray that it hasn't come back and that
&gt; Jesus heals her from head to toe. Thank you so
&gt; much for your prayers. God bless you all. Love,

&gt; PS Please pass this prayer on if you would. Thanks

Messages in this topic (38) 5. Zechariah 1:14-17 Posted by: &quot;Momsooky&quot; momsooky@yahoo.com momsooky Tue Nov 27, 2007 3:56 pm (PST) PASTOR HAGEE'S SCRIPTURE OF THE WEEK
Zechariah 1:14-17

So the angel who spoke with me said to me,
“Proclaim, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts:
“I am zealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with great zeal. I am exceedingly angry with the nations at ease; For I was a little angry, and they helped—but with evil intent.”
‘Therefore thus says the LORD:
“I am returning to Jerusalem with mercy;
My house shall be built in it,” says the LORD of hosts,
“And a surveyor’s line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.”’
“Again proclaim, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts:
“My cities shall again spread out through prosperity;
The LORD will again comfort Zion,
and will again choose Jerusalem.&quot;'&quot; Zechariah 1:14-17

As the Annapolis Summit begins let us remember what the Lord says of His beloved Jerusalem. Let us who love Zion and who have taken a stand with her in this day of trouble intercede on her behalf. May those who defend her be as bold as a lion for the Lord will sustain them and they will be exalted above all nations. May those leaders and nations who come against her with “evil intent” be brought to confusion and may they be mocked and humiliated before their peers.

Thank you for your faithful prayers for Israel, her people and especially the city of Jerusalem.

&quot;a merry heart doeth good like a medicine&quot; Prov 17:22

Messages in this topic (8) 8. HANDEL'S MESSIAH Posted by: &quot;Momsooky&quot; momsooky@yahoo.com momsooky Tue Nov 27, 2007 4:40 pm (PST) HANDEL'S MESSIAH
A Closer Look

Mat 1:23 (KJV)
Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,
and they shall call his name Emmanuel,
which being interpreted is,
God with us.
~~~~~~~~

Dear Friends in Christ,
A while back, I came across a cd copy of Handel's Messiah in a used book store, and snapped it up. What a treasure that nobody wanted! But I had never really listened to the whole work before. The only thing I remembered from it was, of course, the &quot;Hallelujia Chorus.&quot; But as I listened i found that it was so uplifting. I listened to it over and over again. I was incredibly blessed by it. And to my amazement, I started recognizing that the lyrics were actually fragments of Bible verses. So I set about to find the verses and their references, and kept a file for my own studies.
As it turns out, The Messiah is either a Bible study with a beautiful concert attached, or a wonderful piece of classical music with a free
Bible study included at no extra charge. I can't decide which. I do remember reading that when Handel was alive, the Messiah was one of the most often performed pieces of music in concert, and that Handel gave away most of the profits obtained from his concerts to support orphaned children.

So, here is a copy of the lyrics and Bible Verses, and a little bit of history regarding its writing. You will find that Handel's Messiah is a beautiful study of the prophesies and other verses about our Lord Jesus Christ. If you get a chance to sing it or just hear it at this Christnas season, you will be blessed I assure you.
God Bless you and your families.
In Christ........brother bob.......&lt;&gt;&lt;
----------------------------------------------------------
George Frederic Handel (1685-1759)
Performances of Handel's oratorio, Messiah , have become a Christmas tradition, and for many the &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot; expresses the joy which the coming of Christ, the King of Kings, brings. Handel wrote his masterful music in an amazing 24 days and was passionately moved by the Scriptures describing Jesus' incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and coronation as King of Kings. He worked on his masterpiece almost nonstop, with little sleep or food. One day his servant opened the door to find Handel at his work, with tears streaming down his face. Handel looked up and cried out, &quot;I did think I did see all Heaven before me, and the great God Himself.&quot;
When Messiah was performed before King George II of England in 1743, the king rose when the triumphal notes of the &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot; were first played. Of course, everyone had to rise when the king did, and the tradition of rising for the &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot; began - a tradition that continues to this day.

----------------------------------------------------------

Handel's Messiah
George Frederic Handel (1695-1759)
----------------------------------------------------------
Part I
(1) Overture
(2) Comfort Ye
Isaiah 40:1-3
1. Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
2. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her,
that her warfare is accomplished,
that her iniquity is pardoned. . . .
3. The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
(3) Every Valley
Isaiah 40:4
4.Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill made low,
the crooked straight, and the rough places plain.
(4) And the Glory of the Lord
Isaiah 40:5
5. And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together:
for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
(5) Thus saith the Lord
Haggai 2:6,7
6. Thus saith the Lord of Hosts;
Yet once, a little while and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
7. And I will shake all nations,
and the desire of all nations shall come

Malachi 3:1
1. The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to His temple,
even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in:
Behold, He shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts.
(6) But who may abide the Day of His Coming?
Malachi 3:2
2. But who may abide the day of His coming?
and who shall stand when He appeareth?
For He is like a refiner's fire.

Sparky's Prayer: Thank You, Lord: for the supernatural assistance
that is available to us through the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Help
fill us with Your Holy Spirit that we will be more effective for You.
Help us Lord to become aware of the spiritual gifts that You have for
the entire church. Help us to remember that all gifts from God lift
up the name of Jesus. Thank You for giving each of us a different
assignment, but we all have the same Holy Spirit. In Jesus' saving
name we pray. Amen.

Philippians 3:16-21 – A Citizen of Heaven
PAUL'S PRAYER: Dear Father God: We want to join all Your holy people
in imitating the example of Your apostle Paul, and we want to take
notice of people in our own time who live by the same example. Thank
You, Father God, that our citizenship is in Heaven, from which we
wait the return of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. Thank You,
heavenly Father, that He will come to change our lowly body to be
like His glorious body, by the power, which enables Him to subject
all things to Himself. In Jesus' saving name and by the power of the
Holy Spirit we pray. Amen.

VERSE: For everything that was written in the past was written to
teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the
Scriptures we will have hope. Romans 15:4 (NIV)
THOUGHT: If the Bible is a love story, then its theme is hope. No
matter how dire the circumstances, no matter how big the enemy, no
matter how deep the sin, no matter how lost the people, no matter how
empty the cupboard, no matter how wide the river, no matter ... God
repeatedly gives his people reason to hope in a brighter tomorrow.
Then God brought the assurance of that tomorrow in Jesus!
PRAYER: Eternal Father God, please give us patience and endurance as
we search Your Scriptures to know and understand Your truth. We are
amazed at the incredible things You did to redeem and bless Your
people in the Old Testament. We are absolutely astonished at what You
were able to do with Jesus' rag-tag bunch of disciples. Please, O
Father God, inspire our hope so that we will expect something great
from Your hand and then live to see You accomplish it in our day.
Make this, as well as all other things in our lives, be to Your honor
and glory. In Jesus' saving name we pray. Amen.

WHAT JESUS DID! Mutiny!
Matthew 26:17-21 (NLT) On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened
Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, &quot;Where do you want us
to prepare the Passover supper?&quot; &quot;As you go into the city,&quot; He told
them, &quot;you will see a certain man. Tell him, `The Teacher says, My
time has come, and I will eat the Passover meal with My disciples at
your house.'&quot; So the disciples did as Jesus told them and prepared
the Passover supper there. When it was evening, Jesus sat down at the
table with the twelve disciples. While they were eating, He
said, &quot;The truth is, one of you will betray Me.&quot;
WJD THOUGHT: It's such an ugly word. It's such an ugly action.
MUTINY! Betrayal and rebellion against Jesus by one of His very own.
We've heard hints and warnings, but now Jesus makes it clear during
the celebration of Israel's great deliverance from Egypt. He will be
handed over to the enemy by one of His most trusted and closest
friends. The warning stands in such stark contrast to the phrase &quot;the
followers did what Jesus told them to do.&quot; Disciples, dedicated
followers, do what their master says. They don't go sell Him out for
a few coins. They sure don't have the audacity to share in the most
intimate and private moments of worship and leave to go betray Him.
But this is precisely Jesus' point. One of His very own will sell Him
out. In the very moment of joy, Jesus reminds them (and us as well),
we can find it easy to play the game and then leave the room and
become someone very different, someone despicable. It's a lot to
think about. On this night, the disciples will do just that! Maybe
when we take the Lord's Supper, it would be good for us to do the
same!
WJD PRAYER: O Great God and Shepherd of our soul, it is hard for us
to be as honest with our hearts and know our motives in the way You
do. But there is a deep stirring in our hearts that reminds us that
we can do what Judas is about to do: to honor You in the presence of
those who love You, but betray You into the hands of those who hate
You and Your work. Please forgive us for those times that we have
done that, and please help strengthen our resolve and courage so that
it will never happen again. In Jesus' saving name and by the power of
the Holy Spirit we pray. Amen.
http://www.heartlight.org/wjd/matthew/1127-wjd.html

WHAT JESUS DID! Pilate Knows the Truth
Mark 15:9-10 (NLT) &quot;Should I give you the King of the Jews [Jesus,
instead of Barabbas]?&quot; Pilate asked. (For he realized by now that the
leading priests had arrested Jesus out of envy.)
WJD THOUGHT: So often, people make their decisions to honor Jesus
based upon the opinion of the crowd around them. Pilate, though armed
with Rome's military might, is a puppet in the hands of Jesus'
enemies because he is willing to let the crowd decide what he will do
with Jesus. What about us?
WJD PRAYER: O Father God, please give us the courage to be loyal to
Jesus no matter which way the crowd goes. In Jesus' saving name we
pray. Amen.

WHAT JESUS DID! Escape JerUSAlem, Expect His Coming
Luke 21:20-28 (NLT) &quot;And when you see JerUSAlem surrounded by armies,
then you will know that the time of its destruction has arrived. Then
those in Judea must flee to the hills. Let those in JerUSAlem escape,
and those outside the city should not enter it for shelter. For those
will be days of God's vengeance, and the prophetic words of the
Scriptures will be fulfilled. How terrible it will be for pregnant
women and for mothers nursing their babies. For there will be great
distress in the land and wrath upon this people. They will be
brutally killed by the sword or sent away as captives to all the
nations of the world. And JerUSAlem will be conquered and trampled
down by the Gentiles until the age of the Gentiles comes to an
end. &quot;And there will be strange events in the skies--signs in the
sun, moon, and stars. And down here on earth the nations will be in
turmoil, perplexed by the roaring seas and strange tides. The courage
of many people will falter because of the fearful fate they see
coming upon the earth, because the stability of the very heavens will
be broken up. Then everyone will see the Son of Man arrive on the
clouds with power and great glory. So when all these things begin to
happen, stand straight and look up, for your salvation is near!&quot;
WJD THOUGHT: Jesus warns that the destruction of JerUSAlem will come.
The inhabitants need to be ready to escape that disaster. The
Christians of JerUSAlem followed Jesus' word and did escape to safety
when the time came. But for us, there will also come a time when He
will come again and return in glory with salvation. So they need not
fear, only look forward to that day with hope and confidence. We,
too, need to look forward to that day with confidence and hope,
knowing that even in our worst moments, the Lord is near and His
return is never far away.
WJD PRAYER: Gracious God and Almighty LORD, we look forward to the
day of Jesus' return in glory. Use us to help others prepare for that
day and to be ready to greet it with confidence. Until then, make our
hope in Your Son's return burn brightly in our hearts until the sky
shines brightly with His glory. In Jesus' saving name we pray. Amen.

WHAT JESUS DID! What Happens When You're Pleasing the Wrong Audience
John 19:12 (NLT) Then Pilate tried to release Him, but the Jewish
leaders told him, &quot;If you release this man, you are not a friend of
Caesar. Anyone who declares himself a king is a rebel against Caesar.&quot;
WJD THOUGHT: Who is Pilate trying to please, God or the masses? Who
are the masses trying to please, themselves or God? Who are you
trying to please, yourself, your peers, or your Savior? Answering
that last question is just as crucial for you as it was for the
masses and for Pilate nearly two thousand years ago. Who you are
trying to please will either consecrate you or corrupt you! So choose
this day to live to please the Lord -- not only is it the right way
to live, it has eternal benefits!
WJD PRAYER: O Father God, we have no idea how many days You have left
for us to live. However, we do know that today, we choose to live to
please You and reflect Your character and grace in our lives. Our
heart's desire is to consciously make that same choice each day.
Please guard our hearts from evil, arrogance, selfishness, pride,
deceit, lust, or any other corrupting force Satan might use to gain a
stronghold in our lives. In Jesus' saving name and by the power of
the Holy Spirit we pray. Amen.

Daily Guide to Miracles from Oral Roberts Ministries
Love: the Antidote for Hate — by Oral Roberts
When someone hurts us, the first reaction of our flesh is to feel
anger, resentment, and hatred toward that person and want to get
even. And all too often, we do not seek to overcome those feelings
through forgiveness. We allow hate, like a spider, to spin its web
around our souls.
Whenever an insect becomes entangled in a spider's web, the spider
immediately attacks the insect, filling its body with poison. Then
the spider strengthens the web, making death certain.
Hate is like the spider. It fills the soul with toxins, setting off a
chemical reaction in the body, poisoning the bloodstream and
imprisoning the spirit. Worse, such hatred is in direct opposition to
Jesus' teaching. He said, Love your enemies, bless them that curse
you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
despitefully use you, and persecute you. (Matthew 5:44)
Love is the only antidote for hate. One way to activate love against
hate is to remember that Christ died for the hateful person the same
as He died for you. That person is also made in the image of God and
carries a divine imprint upon his or her soul. In hating them, you
are also hating God. Activating God's love in your spirit destroys
both the web and spider of hate, cleansing your being of the poison
and setting you free.
Henry Ford once said, &quot;I shall never let anyone drag me down by
making me hate him.&quot; That's a good motto to live by.
My Declaration of Faith for Today: I forgive those who wrong me and
walk in love toward them, knowing that God loves them as He loves me.
Remember, &quot;Something GOOD is going to happen to you!&quot;

Followed By The Saints
Psalm 116:7-9 - Be at rest once more, O my soul, for the Lord has
been good to you. For You, O Lord, have delivered my soul from death,
my eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling, that I will walk
before the Lord in the land of the living. (NIV)
The hymn, &quot;For all the saints who from their labours rest&quot;, echoes
through my head as I write this. Have you experienced the saints of
old around you, before you, even following you -- a heavenly host of
those who loved you long since and are lost from your view for a
while?
It was Saturday morning at our annual weekend retreat here on
Vancouver Island. Sixty women were looking forward to this very
special weekend. We were staying at a Christian camp by a very
beautiful lake, but heavy rain had greeted us on arrival. Now we were
anxiously watching the weather, hoping we would be able to get
outside and stay reasonably dry through our meditative walk. This is
a silent walk, as we thread our way around the campsite, stopping at
ten stations for Scripture and prayer -- together -- but in total
silence.
The rain had subsided, and as I led the group, they all came behind
me in the same measured, thoughtful footsteps. The sound behind me
crackled as we walked through the leaves of fall scattered
everywhere. The pace was uniform as we approached the lake. Before
us, stretched a beautiful scene we all love. In those moments of
reflection on a given biblical passage, time seemed to stand still.
Then as I slowly started forward again, the steps behind me started
again too -- the slow, measured, thoughtful steps of many in prayer.
It was during the last long trek through the grass towards the lake
that I had a sense of being followed by many, indeed hundreds, of
footsteps, and I thought of all the saints in whose steps we follow.
The feeling of being joined by the saints who had nurtured us in the
faith through our early years was strong within me.
Let's pause a moment and recall with gratitude the saints who have
gone before us, around us and behind us. Let's give thanks for those
who are walking now through this life with us as we all follow in
Jesus' steps. Help us to vow to &quot;walk before the Lord in the land of
the living&quot; and give thanks for all those faithful ones who showed us
the way.
We come in agreement with Iris' Prayer: Lord, we acknowledge with
gratitude the example we have received from those who walked before
us in this life and have now joined with the saints in heaven. Help
us, on this day, be faithful examples in our daily walk for those who
follow us. Forgive us when we stumble and when our eyes are filled
with tears, knowing we failed You and them. We hear Your Word, &quot;Be at
rest, O my soul, for the Lord has been good to you.&quot; In Your mercy,
pick us up, dear Lord, and deliver our souls from death through the
resurrection of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. In Jesus' saving
name we pray. Amen.

The White Elephant
By Susanne Scheppmann

“Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth. This then is how we know that we belong to the truth, and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence.” 1 John 3:18-19 (NIV)

Devotion:
‘Tis the season for parties. The invitation reads, “Bring a white elephant gift.” A white elephant gift doesn’t require much thought or money. It can be an inexpensive trinket, a used household item or a gag gift. These white elephant get-togethers create laughter and light-hearted camaraderie.

However, there exists another kind of “white elephant” social gathering—the type where everyone knows there is a relational conflict that exists within the group, but no one acknowledges it. This pachyderm problem might occur within families, between co-workers, or in a neighborhood. The more everyone pretends the white elephant issue isn’t there, the bigger the unseen problem grows. The denial is like feeding peanuts to a live elephant—it grows larger and larger.

Do you anticipate this type of white elephant intruding on one of your upcoming festivities? Do you dread being in the same room with a particular person? To my own distress, I usually attend at least one event where the unwanted guest arrives, blowing its silent trumpet and begging for peanuts. However, God does not intend for us to ignore the problem. He wants us to seek His wisdom and guidance. The Lord wants us to pray and consider carefully how we might apply the following scriptural principles to help prevent or dissolve the uninvited intruder of tension from our personal relationships:

Let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth. (1 John 3:18, NIV)
Pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another. (Romans 14:19, NASB)
If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. (Romans 12:18, NIV)

Let’s decide beforehand how God would have us handle any uncomfortable situation that might steal away the joy and peace of a Christmas festivity. If the white elephant isn’t gift-wrapped, it doesn’t belong at the party. So don’t pack any invisible peanuts in your holiday attire, but love as Jesus loves—with action and truth.

Dear Lord, I anticipate at least one party where a “white elephant” sits in the room. I ask that You teach me how to handle any situation like this with love, truth and action. Reveal to me if I contribute to the issue in any way. Lord, help me to reach out to everyone in Your love and compassion. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.

Do You Know Him?

Application Steps:
Consider your upcoming holiday events. Identify any potential “white elephants” that might be present. Pray over the event and ask the Holy Spirit to direct your words and actions. Ask God to evaporate the “elephant” and to resolve the relational conflict that might be residing in your heart.

Reflections:
Does the same “white elephant” return every year?

How do I play a part in feeding it and allowing it to grow larger?

Is it possible that I could be the cause of the white elephant?

Power Verses:
Psalm 40:10, “I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; I speak of your faithfulness and salvation. I do not conceal your love and your truth from the great assembly.” (NIV)

3 John 1:3-4, “It gave me great joy to have some brothers come and tell about your faithfulness to the truth and how you continue to walk in the truth. I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.” (NIV)

Christ Centered Devotion for 11/28/2007

Let's Live A Life Of Praise Unto the Lord
Psa 149:3-5 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation. Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.
Quoted
Christ is full and sufficient for all his people. He is bread, wine, milk, living waters, to feed them; he is a garment of righteousness to cover and adorn them; a Physician to heal them; a Counselor to advise them; a Captain to defend them; a Prince to rule; a Prophet to teach; a Priest to make atonement for them; a Husband to protect; a Father to provide; a Brother to relieve; a Foundation to support; a Root to quicken; a Head to guide; a Treasure to enrich; a Sun to enlighten; and a Fountain to cleanse. JOHN SPENCER (1630–1693)
Today's Verses - KJV
1 Th 2:13-16 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe. For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men: Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
My Comments
When we hear the Word of God; how do we take it? Do we take it as being the Word of God or just what someone says? When we quote what the Word of God says about a thing we have had some say &quot;I don't believe it that way&quot;! Do they realize they are saying they know more about it than God! This kind of thinking will never make it into the kingdom of God. This kind of thinking is at the root of why there are so many different denominations that all claim to know God but are not living according to His Word. As it was with the early church so it is now, in this generation. The early church was persecuted because of the gospel of Christ; told as it is. It still happens today. Those who preach repentance, abstinence from sin are being called legalists and narrow minded, holy rollers, etc. Some are even calling it hate speech! Beloved, Christ is not one of many ways to approach God, He is the only way! This makes some very angry with us. So be it, it happened to all who came before us and it will happen to us as well! People in churches, all over the world, are being told they are eternally saved who have never repented of their sins and are still doing things that the Bible says will not inherit the Kingdom of God. I weep over this. Many will miss heaven because of this kind of ministry. Hear the Word of God - 1 Pet 4:17-18 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? Beloved, it is high time we did spiritual inventory of our own lives. Let's measure how we live by the Word of God. How do we measure up? Are we among the obedient or the disobedient? The first has blessings on them, the second has the wrath of God on them! Those of us who minister, are we telling it just like it is or are we trying to please men instead of God? Meditate on it!
Prayer
Father God, Forgive us when we fail to tell others the fullness of Your Word. May Your Word become the light to our path and the lamp to our feet so we never stumble in the dark. We ask, believe we receive, and give thanks in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
