Friends;
I was at an auction preview this weekend and was amazed at how seemingly
responsible parents could stand by as their children ran amok, even after
they were asked to gain control of them. I saw one boy of about nine pick
up a samurai sword and start to wave it about (of course, I've seen grown
men do this too but that is a different story) and another trying to work
on the action on a rather expensive rifle. The parents in this case
either looked on affectionately or were nowhere to be scene. The preview
staff, needless to say, were apoplectic. One pointedly said she wasn't
paid to be a babysitter.

Any thoughts on this. Should children be restricted from such sales. The
liability issues for the auction house must be terrific. Any other tales?
And I'm remembered of the adage: &quot;Children are like good intentions, they
should be carried out...&quot;

Thoughts?

Thoughts?&lt;&lt;

I've taken my oldest daughter (now 5) to several auction previews and a
few flea market-type outdoor shows. She stays close by and knows that the
rule is to not touch, unless she asks first. Mostly these were
mission/arts and crafts auctions with sturdy Stickley furniture (she calls
it 'tickley') like what we have at home.
I took her to an auction itself just once, when we went to bid on one item
and left immediately after getting it. Most auctions are simply too long
and boring for children--they're that way for me sometimes!
Alice has never acted up in such a situation, nor has her little sister,
who has now joined her. But if either did, the same rule would apply as if
they misbehaved in any public place (I mean a real problem: screaming,
tantrum, running when told not to, bothering people, etc.) and that rule
is: we go home immediately.
So it bothers me when I hear people suggest that there should be blanket
rules barring children from events. HOWEVER...I've seen many of the same
things you describe and have to agree they are intolerable. And imagine
trying to explain to a five-year-old why the 'other' kids are behaving
that way...and getting away with it.
Personally I would tend to speak firmly to a misbehaving child--and not be
shy about confronting the parent, either. But I wouldn't have dared to do
so before becoming a parent myself.
I think that antiques and children can mix, but only in the right
proportions!

"/> --

My brother's auction house is on Cape Cod, and in the summer they
have a rule re: children in the exhibition gallery (during the winter,
because of school, there is seldom a problem). Children are frequently
brought by parents (usually summer visitors) who expect to be able to just
let them wander wherever they want while the parents look at the exhibit.
After some unfortunate problems, the gallery has adopted a 'No Children&quot;
policy. This isn't as harsh as it seems though, since in the summer, the
outdoor auction tent is set up immediately outside the gallery entrance and
children can play there while they wait.

It's true that *many* children are as good as gold and understand
that they are not permitted to freely handle things or run around, but
there *are* children whose parents unfortunately seem completely unaware
that their children need any control or guidance whatever, and consequently
the policy had to be enforced for all. I have been present when some of
these parents have literally 'turned their kids loose' with no thought to
be concerned for damages to the goods or - God forbid - to the child who
doesn't know NOT to handle something like the &quot;Samurai sword&quot; mentioned in
John's post. A quick word from the staff has always dealt with the
situation and the child is brought outside to wait. Occasionally a parent
who had hoped for free babysitiing for the afternoon has huffed off, but
most understand and comply.

My normal site for news is down, so please bear with me
if this comes out weird. :)

John O. posted about misbehaving kids (my interpretation: irresponsible
parents) at an auction preview.

Then Jan Schiel (sch ... @interaccess.com) wrote:

: They shouldn't be carried out, they shouldn't be there in the first place.

I tend to agree more with what AlanT said. (sorry, it's snip or
waste space by quoting everything back, which I don't know how
to do on here anyway). :) If the parents can and will control
their children, I see no reason why they can't be at auctions,
for a length of time they can tolerate without going too
squirrelly. :) There are exceptions, of course. I'd never have
taken my son to an auction that featured elegant art glass or
other high-end, fragile goods. But he spent many an
afternoon with me at a country, outdoor auction, where he
could sit on a blanket and play or read or nap.

He was taught not to touch and he enjoyed the people and
the hot dogs and even the antiques. Now that he's grown
up, he deals in vintage clothing and has had a fondness
and appreciation for old things most of his life. I don't
think that's an accident. New customers have to come
from somewhere. :)

The only mishap we ever had was when he was about 10. I didn't
have to keep a constant eagle eye on him by then, because
he respected the things for sale, and he behaved. He was
walking around, looking at stuff displayed on the other end
of the table from me.

Before I knew it, I heard &quot;Sold, to
number XXX!&quot; and recognized my number. He bid a couple
dollars on a box full of gold-rimmed glasses with my
number, and the auctioneer let him. Heh heh, he wasn't
tall for his age, either. I suppose I could have
protested, but he was so happy with his treasure I told
him he could keep them but to always ask me to bid for
him if he wanted something.

I've also taken my oldest nephew, who's 10, to estate
sales with me since he was about 6. The child is so obedient
he'd rather eat bugs than get a dirty look or scolding, so I know
he'll listen to me when I say &quot;hands off,&quot; and he's
always proven me right.

With him in tow, I've encountered two sorts of dealers:
Those who see a child and have a mental but visible
&quot;kid alarm&quot; go off and get all flustered and say,
haughtily, &quot;Make CERTAIN he doesn't touch anything!&quot;
And those who take a moment to see that he *isn't*
touching anything (and is tiptoeing around like he's
walking through a showroom full of Waterford Crystal) and
who say, &quot;What a well-behaved little boy! Does he like
antiques?&quot;

I understand the first reaction, because of horrifying scenes
such as those John described. But it's refreshing to encounter
the second reaction, because generalizing is such a bore,
even when it pertains to kids. :) So my answer to &quot;kids
or no kids at auctions&quot; is that it depends on the kid. I have
another nephew that I wouldn't allow within a mile of
of anything old and fragile. :)

Sorry for rambling on so, but this is a subject I feel
sort of strongly about.

As for parents being able to afford a babysitter if they can
afford antiques...well, maybe they have one day a week when the
whole family can do something together, and it's on the day
when the greatest auction is happening. Or, maybe they can't
afford both, but just one or the other.

I agree with Alan T...no blanket ban on kids and confront
the parents of the little renegades if you can find them. :)

I
i am of two minds on the subject: 1) i have seen children at auctions
behaving perfectly well, or even sleeping, and don't have any problems
whatsoever with them being there. 2) the people who don't or can't
control their kids drive me nuts. and as the parent of two extremely
active (charming but too much for me to handle!) boys, now almost grown, i
wouldn't have brought them within a mile of an auction, antique shop, etc.
if my life depended on it- no way. not a relaxing way to spend time. so i
guess the answer is that this is a very individualized subject. i never
went anywhere ambitious with them without backup.

I like kids too, with a side of fries.

When children come into my shop, and my stuff is enticing to the child in
all of us, I try to determine whether they, not their parents, are
responsible. Those who ask questions, who are genuinely curious, I
welcome. I'm also not talking about social status or manners or other
societal semiotics. I'm looking for a spark in the eye. And if these kids
are brighter than the general population, so much the better. I encourage
them to touch, to explore. They will do no harm.

The others, depending on what amuses me that day, I either glare at, or am
so obsequiously servile, hovering to the point of being disgusting, that
they and their parents leave. Their taste is not usually mine anyway.

Yes,I am bigotted, I am not government funded, I don't have to be nice to
everybody.
I don't mind being a museum, or a browser's paradise, in fact I enjoy
playing show and tell, but I do demand respect for my poor treasures in
return. And in this case respect can be not only earned, but also
demanded.

All children/parents are different. If the child/children are running around
out of control, it's the parents' fault. I think it's easier if the parent
brings just one kid, more than one starts to get hard to control, I don't
think they should be banned. If I worked at the place and saw a little
monster running around out of control, I would ask who he/she belonged to,
return to the parent with a stern warning to the parent that their child's
behavior is unwelcome.

I was allowed as a young child to go with my father to shops growing up.
During this impressionable period, I learned to appreciate antiques, coins
and stamps. I collect in all of these categories today. I do not believe
that children should be allowed to run wild, just the oppositie in fact,
and parents must be responsible for their children. But children do not
learn if we do not give them opportunities. The children of today are the
collectors of tomorrow.

I've been taking my children with me to auctions and garage
sales since they were in my snuggli. The older two (12 &amp; 10)
already have pretty impressive collections (wades &amp; cats).
It's a nice way to spend time together. They usually use their
own money to buy -- and if they decide to sell, they get the
profit. It's a good learning experience on investment &amp; the
value of a dollar.

Their behavior is as responsible &amp; careful as most adults
(I've threatened the old &quot;you break - you buy&quot; adage). I think
the kids who run wild are those with parents who are irresponsible.

I work on weekends in an auction gallery in Tidewater Virginia. We have
one customer who persists in bringing her bratty little son to the
auctions. We are dealing in some very high quality items-very expensive
designer glass, paintings and etchings by artists like Picasso, Chagal,
etc. And here's this bratty little kid running around trying to grab
sale items, getting in the way of the lifters with heavy furnniture in
hand, etc.. On one occasion we had to physically take him back to his
mother. She was offended, as if she expected us to babysit the little
monster since she was buying one or two low-ball items at the show. On
another memorable afternoon, we found him outside in the rear parking
area breaking bottles around the other customers' cars tires...and Mommy
didn't believe that little Junior could ever be involved in such a
terrible thing, and why would a grown man like me want to tell such
terrible tales about her sweet little precious? Arrgghh!!!

My favorite sign on the subject was posted in an antiques store near
Yorktown, VA. &quot;Unattended minor children will be sold as slaves.&quot;
Very few children below the age of 14 belong anywhere near an auction
house or antique store. The sad fact is that Dr. Spock and the Baby-
Boomers have raised a bunch of uneducated, ill-mannered, falsely arrogant
little hooligans.

I too go to many estate sales, auctions, etc. i have four children and
we have a rule. Before we enter our hands are behind our back. We walk
very quietly and respectfully through anyone elses property. The
toddler is in a backpack. i get constant compliments from my children's
behavior. my daughter once broke a glass and we paid for it. She in
turn worked for 50Cents and hour for three weeks to pay for the glass.
She knew then that a broken glass was no reward for her hard earned
money. BTW, the shop owner did not insist we pay for it. it was close
to the edge and she was trying to set it straight on the shelf. I told
him an item broken should be paid for by the person who broke it, no
exceptions...my daughter was teary eyed and the kind gentleman had a
hard time agreeing with me.

For years my grandmother and mother took us to auctions. My grandmother
also had a house full of antiques. Out of necessity we were taught on how
to act around such things. My brother one time broke something of hers, and
she still complains about it to this day, and it happened 26 years ago.

My sister went with a couple of friends to an antique shop. They brought
along their kids. My sister cringed, every time one of the kids picked up
something, so much that she had to leave early.

It really is the parents job to take care of their children and how they
are to be trained as regards anitques, and how to act around them. Even
today's children can be taught proper respect of property.

My 2 Cents,
David

"/> I have an antique shop...I have no problem with children as long as
the parents accompany them and they're well-behaved. I DO, however,
have a problem with parents who come through the door and go in a
different direction than their children and expect ME to watch them.
It's rude in any public establishment, but seems especially
unacceptable in a shop full of antique glassware and valuable jewelry.
90% of my inventory is breakable. If you're children are very young,
please hold their hand and do not allow them to handle merchandise at
will. Teach your older children to stay close and handle merchandise
with CARE.
