Just have my first hour under my belt using TM. (Time Machine)

Very impressive visual interface, very intuitive to use.

Vista attempts to do the same thing with &quot;Shadow Copies&quot;, however their
interface is not intuitive or easy to use.

TM is great to employ for creative purposes, where rough thoughts are
put to paper, then refined through many intermediate versions to obtain
the final polished document.

Later, I am going to try to drive TM by voice commands, possibly using
iListen or some similar speech software.

Reason is, we all know that great moments in creativity occur when man
is on the can, or in the shower, or dosing in a lounge chair watching
the birds and butterflies.

from a wireless microphone.

Are you really saying that you would rely on a backup system to recover
intermediate versions instead of just learning to use the Save As
command?

In any case, you should read very carefully exactly how time machine
works, as it will _NOT_ be nearly as useful as you think for this
purpose.

The &quot;Save As&quot; command is a poor substitute for
what TM does.

&quot;Save As&quot; is not nearly as capable of being used to
find an intermediate document you have &quot;permanently&quot;
discarded.

Look at it this way, as a &quot;shoestring catch&quot; for deleted doc's.

Assume I am creating a medical dictionary in a &quot;My Project&quot; folder.

I could have as many as a million entries in my dictionary, considering
all the medical sub-specialties.

Me and my team would be constantly modifying the definitions depending
on current usage of the medical terms.

We would  _have_  to throw away some older documents occasionally
because otherwise our project would become unwieldy and unmanageable.

Apple's  Time Machine is a good way to manage those thrown-away
documents in case they would be needed later.

TM is a semi-organized &quot;stash&quot; of rarely used items, which could put us
in a real bind if they were thrown away permanently.

Heavy emphasis on &quot;semi-organized&quot; as the key concept here.

The more you know about using Time Machine, the better your chances of
exhuming some desperately needed old thrown-away file.

Microsoft's &quot;Shadow Copies&quot; does the same thing in Windows Vista,
however it is not nearly as intuitive and easy to use.

Time Machine, properly used, is great for anyone who has accidentally
thrown away something, then bitterly regretted it later.

Good catch, I meant to post &quot;dozing&quot; of course.

As regards dosing, only stuff I use are the usual stuff that most people

Guzzle so much nitro that I am afraid to fart, for fear it will result

One, and only one, of my old documents had the word &quot;Second&quot; in it.

No luck, TM could not find that document.

I agree with this. Someone going through a creative process, though,
should be using the Save As command each time he gets to a point at
which he wants to be able to refer back to intermediate versions, rather
than rely on a backup program like TM to happen to have retained that
version.  You _do_ understand, don't you, that TM backs up once an hour,
and that it retains each of those hourly backups for only the previous
24 hours?  There's one daily retention for the prior monthm then weekly
backups until the disk is full.

Mark, I've seen some distinct flakiness in the Search feature when in
the backups of Time Machine. Searching by File Name (not Contents):
- Files shown that are not in backup (but are in earlier backup)
- List of files changes if you click &quot;Last Opened&quot; vs. &quot;Name&quot; or &quot;Kind&quot;

(See my earlier details in this topic.)

Appears to me that the search has bugs, and perhaps some obscure
notions of search.

Okay, my mistake, I thought you were referring to some other dedicated

full blown bootable backup.

&lt;sigh&gt; - this part of this thread is rapidly getting too convoluted for
my simple brain to follow.

No bad reflection on your posting, just my problem.

Lemme take another crack at trying to sort all this out.

I wanna start with the points we both agree on, then either ignore the
points of disagreement, or resolve them one at a time.

What we agree on -  (I think)&lt;g&gt;

Item #1 - - -

So far as I know, the above point is the only one we agree on.&lt;g&gt;

Okay, below is the bone of contention, point of disagreement, or point
of misunderstanding:

Mike:

I only partially agree with that.

Once I get to any critical point where I think I might want to refer
back to later, then I  _do_  use &quot;Save As&quot;, however I do not use &quot;Save
As&quot; in the manner that you suggested.

Lemme try to explain that important difference; hang onto your seat,
this explanation might take some time.

If I understand you correctly, you advocate using &quot;Save As&quot; to save that
critical intermediate copy to some secure location, versus saving that
critical intermediate document to TM itself.

In other words, you do not want to rely on TM to store those critical
intermediate versions, because too many nasty things can happen with TM
that might destroy those intermediate versions.

That is where we differ. (I think)

When I use &quot;Save As&quot;, I do it in such a manner as to  RELY  on TM to
store all the critical intermediate versions of my documents.

Back to you at this stage, for any comments.

Okay, but just to make things absolutely clear, TM does _not_ create a
bootable backup.  I'm not sure whether or not you were saying it does,
but I want to clarify just in case.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I'm talking abut what many writers, graphic designers and other creative
types have been doing all along, which is to use Save As to keep
multiple versions of their projects wherever their sense of organization
inclines them to on their main hard drive, and use whatever backup
system they have in place to back all of the versions up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; that might destroy those intermediate versions.
">

I'm not talking about nasty things happening, I'm saying that TM,
working precisely as it's designed to, won't accomplish what you think
it will.  TM does exactly this -- it backs up your entire boot drive,
minus any items you've specifically set it to skip, to a designated
drive or volume to start.  It then makes incremental backups once an
hour.  It keeps all the incremental backups for the past 24 hours.
After those 24 hours, it only retains one backup per day for the
previous month, and after that month it only retains one backup per week
until the capacity of your designated drive or volume is full, and older
backups are then removed as space requirements dictate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; When I use &quot;Save As&quot;, I do it in such a manner as to  RELY  on TM to
&gt; store all the critical intermediate versions of my documents.
">

I'm not sure what you mean by this, especially since I got the
impression that you were originally talking about using TM in lieu of
Save As.

Here's a specific example of what I'm talking about to illustrate.  Over
the past several days I've been working on a new Latin dance design to
use on shirts.  Whenever I've gotten to a critical intermediate version
I've used Save As to create another document in the same folder.  I can
always open any of my previous or alternate versions.  Of course, that's
provided nothing messes up my hard drive and I don't accidentally trash
something I intended to save.  And THAT is where TM comes into play.

Now, if this is what you meant all along, then I just misunderstood your
OP and we're actually on the same page.  I got the impression from that
post, though, that you were talking about relying on TM for recovering
those intermediate versions without having used Save As to create
alternate versions, and if that's what you really meant, it's simply not
going to accomplish what you hope.

Okay Mike, I think I know what is going on with our wildly different use
of Time Machine.

We both use TM in a radically different manner, so when we posted to
each other we both made assumptions that were incorrect, so that in turn
caused a lot of confusion and mis-communication.

We were both definitely on  _different_  pages of the same book.&lt;g&gt;

Here are just a few of the differences:

Mark-  Uses manual keystroke to save file to TM ext' drive
Mike-  Uses once-an-hour automatic feature

Mark-  Restricts TM to backing up only one folder
Mike-  Allows TM to back up entire drive

Mark-  Able to keep all TM backups with no discards,
be they daily, weekly, monthly, yearly - - -
in other words, NONE of my daily docs have been
permanently deleted by TM
Mike-  Has present problems with some of his docs being
permanently trashed by TM

Mark-  Only uses &quot;Save As&quot; to save an intermediate version
of a document to one specific folder on the internal
drive, a folder named &quot;My Project&quot; which is the ONLY
folder backed up by TM - - - EVERYTHING else on the
internal drive &quot;skipped&quot; by TM
Mike-  Uses &quot;Save As&quot; to save an intermediate version of
his document to a special location outside of TM

Mark-  Does not expect his ext' TM drive to get full,
even after a year of use
Mike-  Expects his ext' TM drive to get full perhaps
within months

Mark-  Can trash anything within the &quot;My Project&quot; folder,
confident that TM can retrieve it again if necessary
Mike-  Not 100% confident that TM can retrieve a trashed doc'

No wonder we ran into trouble when we compared notes!
***************************************************

We both have enough sense to use something other than TM to back up our
computer in case of massive internal drive failure.

I think you use SuperDuper! for that.

In my case I use a customized &quot;dd&quot; method, supplemented by ordinary
&quot;Finder&quot; copying of recent documents to an external drive.

&quot;dd&quot; allows me to backup my Vista partition also - - - you do not run
Vista so there is no need for &quot;dd&quot; in your case

We would both probably lose any recent document that was say 20 minutes
old.

If either one of us installs a major Apple upgrade, or any major new
application, I think we both create a new full system backup.

I do not understand why your TM is permanently throwing away some of
your hourly TM docs.

It is not happening here to me. (yet, that is)
