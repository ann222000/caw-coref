Hi

Didn;t know what group to post this in - you guys are techie though!

I would like to Ghost a windows xp machine

However, the machine does not have a CD-RW

It can however, be networked to another machine with a CD-RW

Any ideas what app will do this? I.e. ghost to an ISO file?

Does windows xp get fussy if the image has been burned onto a different
brand hard drive? (it's going back into the same machine)

thanks

D
