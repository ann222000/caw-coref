After years of suffering at 33kbs, I need a faster internet connection.

I only have 2 choices, i.e., what I presently have (a 56k dial-up that runs
more like 33k), or SBC Yahoo DSL.

I have Googled and searched newsgroups trying to find info about SBC Yahoo
DSL: it's a self-install; tech support is outsourced to India; they don't
guarantee any minimum speed (not even 14.4K); there is no free trial, not
even one day....but, you are obligated for a one-year contract; and, out of
about 100 references that I've read, none are positive.

Do I stay with what I have and forget streaming anything, or even
downloading anything, or do I take the leap with SBC Yahoo? Any opinions
would be appreciated. This decision is killing me. Thanks!

"/> I have no experience with SBC but I can't believe that ALL of
their customers are unhappy. Newsgroup posts are typically by
people who want to complain. I'd go to
http://www.dslreports.com/  and see what people are saying there.
You'll find a lot more information there than in newsgroups.
Also, I don't believe that if you install it and it doesn't work
well for you that you won't be able to cancel it within a couple
of weeks and not pay the cancellation penalty. Did you ask about
that?

Most DSL is self install and with any luck you won't need
customer service, so I would not be real concerned about those.

If you sign up at  www.getconnected.com  you apparently can get
$50 for signing up and 4 movie tickets to see The Incredibles.
There have been rumors of signup bonuses from Best Buy as well
if you have one in your area.

be helpful to you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Be aware that Earthlink probably sells faster service on that same line
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; less money. Other companies might offer better deals, as well. If you
&gt;&gt; want
&gt;&gt; DSL, you do not need to buy it from the phone company. -Dave

&gt; Earthlink is a &quot;3rd party&quot; ISP &amp; so the phone co will charge an extra $20
&gt; for using a 3rd party isp service. Earthlink still have to go thru the
&gt; local phone co for connection to my apt.

"/> Ummmm . . . not quite. Earthlink buys bandwidth from your phone company and
resells it to you. No matter who maintains the last mile connection, you
still need SOME kind of ISP, obviously. The prices are different now, but
when I had ADSL, it broke down like this:

Phone company: (Verizon) ADSL 768/128, plus Verizon ISP service, $50/month
TOTAL. This was the DSL connection plus e-mail, newsgroups, etc.

Earthlink: ADSL 1500/128 (through Verizon), plus Earthlink ISP service,
$40/month TOTAL. This was the DSL connection (Verizon, purchased through
Earthlink), plus e-mail, newsgroups, etc.

Note that the total cost was less money for faster service through
Earthlink. I don't know what Verizon charges Earthlink for each ADSL
connection, and I don't care. To me (the consumer), my total cost was less
through Earthlink.

The prices are different now, but it wouldn't surprise me if Earthlink still
has a better deal than the local phone company. And Earthlink isn't the
only ISP. You might find an even better deal than that. My point stands .
. . if you want DSL, you don't need to deal with your phone company at all,
unless you want to.

The local cable modem service is priced the same way. I can get (cable
modem plus ISP) from the cable company for $60/month TOTAL or I can get
(cable modem plus ISP) from Earthlink for $45/month TOTAL. In both cases,
the actual cable modem service is from Comcast, and the speeds are
identical.

"/> Bill, I thank you for your input. One visit to  www.dslreports.com  answered
some of my questions and provided me with a great resource for contacting
tech support, etc., just as you had suggested.

My nightmare is that I'll get it installed and find that my modem is only
downloading at 56, when I need to be rocking along at a minimum download of
500 (which is below SBC Yahoo's stated 1.5meg maximum.) In brief, I already
know that I won't get the maximum speed, but I at least want to download at
10 times my present dial-up speed.

You are right about cancellation. In the U.S., under the FTC regulations,
one has up to 30 days to cancel and return anything they buy via internet.
After 30 days would get dicey.

Thanks again for your help and information. All input is appreciated.

Keep in mind that you'll only hear from the complainers. Happy people rarely
take the time to post. For somewhat more balanced coverage, try the SBC forum at

long distance service, $31.95 otherwise.

should be able to find one free or close to it) and connect to

Thanks to everyone in this thread for helping me out. I learned a lot of
neat stuff to add onto what I had already learned through Google, etc.

BTW, I'm 1,300 feet from my CO, not so good news. And, that is the only CO
in my tiny town. And, SBC Yahoo is the only provider for DSL. So, I'm
going to go with SBC and hope that things work out ok. Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

Again, thanks to everyone.

"/> I've had SBC/Yahoo DSL for several years. I've never had to call tech
support. I've had connection problems on the order of once every three
months (couldn't get online for unknown reason but the problem usually
goes away in an hour or two). Connections (not SBC) at work breakdown
much more frequently. I have the lowest cost service, which I believe
is 384kb/sec. That's plenty for me.

&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure that they try to convince you that home networking is
&gt;&gt; not allowed, as well. Shop around - I'm sure there are alternatives.

&gt;Huh? Never heard anything from SBC about home metworking not being
&gt;allowed. Nor has it even been implied. I get one DHCP address for my
&gt;router, and they won't support the stuff on the other side of my
&gt;router, but they don't seem to care if I have several machines
&gt;running.

&gt;&gt; I'd start with  http://www.dslreports.com/search  - see if they show any
&gt;&gt; competition in your area.

"/> I recently helped a client set it up - (Southern California area) - It
was clearly spelled out in the Terms of Service he received with the
modem. Interestingly enough, it does not appear in the online
version. Here's what it says online:

Your SBC Yahoo! DSL Member Account allows for one DSL connection and
one other simultaneous network connection (such as a dial-up line) for
a total of two (2) simultaneous network connections to the Internet.
SBC reserves the right to prohibit any additional simultaneous network
connections. This policy does not prohibit multiple DSL users from
connecting to the Internet over the same DSL network connection using
customer premise equipment such as a router or home networking
equipment

&gt; Thanks to everyone in this thread for helping me out. I learned a lot of

&gt; BTW, I'm 1,300 feet from my CO, not so good news. And, that is the only CO
&gt; in my tiny town. And, SBC Yahoo is the only provider for DSL. So, I'm
&gt; going to go with SBC and hope that things work out ok. Nothing ventured,
&gt; nothing gained.

&gt; Again, thanks to everyone.

"/> 1,300 or 13,000??? At 1,300 feet you should be able to get
whatever they quote. And even 13,000 is relatively short and
should get the rated speed. Verizon will do 1.5mpbs service up
to 15,000 feet these days. I really don't understand your
continued pessimistic view of what you'll end up with, given
that you apparently have no technical knowledge to back it up.

we have 2 computers running, accessing SBC/Y thru a 2wire router.
