I bought a Zenith TO at the Charlotte auction on Friday.
It's in nice shape except that it's missing the wave magnet.
This is a 8G005 model with the having a black tube
to hold the antenna loop.
Does anyone have a spare laying around they could part with?

I also added another piece to my Clough-Brengle collection.
Friday morning while riding around in the golf cart the hotel
got for me, one of the vendors called me over. He had a
C-B model 105 o'scope inside his truck he was holding for me.
It looks like it just popped out of a time machine.
It looks NEW. It wasn't cheap, most C-B test equipment I buy
is $10 -$25. But I couldn't pass it up, it's just way TOO nice.

In the auction I also bought (don't know why) a Wurlitzer Sideman.
This is a electro mechanical drum machine made in 1959.
Here's a link to a web page that shows one,
http://www.synthmuseum.com/wurl/wursideman01.html
I know, it's not a radio, but it does have tubes and lots of moving
parts, and it's way cool, and better yet, it works!
I saw my first one 3 or 4 years ago at the Charlotte auction.
I couldn't believe it when the bidding got down to $20,
I just had to bid. The bidding didn't last long and the next
thing I knew Brad dropped the hammer and it was mine.
I knew right then that the first thing my wife was going to
say was "What in the world did you buy that thing for"...
I was right.

It was great show, the weather was PERFECT.
I think it might have been our biggest flea market ever.
I think there were about 147 occupied spaces in the market.
Friday morning it looked packed.

73, Ron

Ron,

I may have the part you need, but can't picture it from your description. I
have both the SW and MW Wavemagnets for this model.

Click on this link and look at the photo of the inside of the
back. http://www.antiqueradio.org/zen16.htm
That's the antenna I'm looking for.

Thanks for the help.

Charlotte show was great; however, quite expensive for me. A deer hit my
RAV4 on the way home causing $5K in damages.!!

Dams sorry to hear that Jim.
Did the deer really hit your car, or did you hit the deer
with your car?
I guess I've been lucky, I've been driving for nearly 40 years
and never hit a deer.
And we have bunch of them here in Union County.
There were 4 in the yard just last week.

My van was hit by a deer in April of 2005 here in Wisconsin.  I slowed for one ahead
of me in the road, and two more darted out, one smashing into the left side of the
van.

Repair cost for me was $0.  It was an "Act of God" according to my State Farm
comprehensive coverage, which paid the full repair amount.  My agent also said not to
worry about my rates going up, as "Acts of God" are not counted against the policy
holder.

That's amazing, Jim. My policy specifically excluded "Acts of God" from
coverage, and I was using State Farm at the time. Guess it's all about the
agent doing the policy.

Mine's also covered hail and storm damage repeatedly in the past, under the same
"comprehensive" coverage.

Different States look at some stuff differently as well ... I had windshield
replaced in my Van this winter ... yup a gravel truck was ahead of me and
I didn't see him quick enough... if it had happened in Indiana at home I
would have been out 100 bucks for my deductible on the Comp coverage but
since it was in Florida... here they have a state law that says no deductible
on windshields ...

Eddie Brimer can shed light on all this I imagine... thats Eddies Biz...
