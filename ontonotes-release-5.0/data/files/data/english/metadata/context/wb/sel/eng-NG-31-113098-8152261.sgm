The Politics of God
Thomas Struth

By MARK LILLA
Published: August 19, 2007

The twilight of the idols has been postponed. For more than two
centuries, from the American and French Revolutions to the collapse of
Soviet Communism, world politics revolved around eminently political
problems. War and revolution, class and social justice, race and
national identity - these were the questions that divided us. Today,
we have progressed to the point where our problems again resemble
those of the 16th century, as we find ourselves entangled in conflicts
over competing revelations, dogmatic purity and divine duty. We in the
West are disturbed and confused. Though we have our own
fundamentalists, we find it incomprehensible that theological ideas
still stir up messianic passions, leaving societies in ruin. We had
assumed this was no longer possible, that human beings had learned to
separate religious questions from political ones, that fanaticism was
dead. We were wrong.

An example: In May of last year, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran
sent an open letter to President George W. Bush that was translated
and published in newspapers around the world. Its theme was
contemporary politics and its language that of divine revelation.
After rehearsing a litany of grievances against American foreign
policies, real and imagined, Ahmadinejad wrote, &quot;If Prophet Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, Ishmael, Joseph or Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) were
with us today, how would they have judged such behavior?&quot; This was not
a rhetorical question. &quot;I have been told that Your Excellency follows
the teachings of Jesus (peace be upon him) and believes in the divine
promise of the rule of the righteous on Earth,&quot; Ahmadinejad continued,
reminding his fellow believer that &quot;according to divine verses, we
have all been called upon to worship one God and follow the teachings
of divine Prophets.&quot; There follows a kind of altar call, in which the
American president is invited to bring his actions into line with
these verses. And then comes a threatening prophecy: &quot;Liberalism and
Western-style democracy have not been able to help realize the ideals
of humanity. Today, these two concepts have failed. Those with insight
can already hear the sounds of the shattering and fall of the ideology
and thoughts of the liberal democratic systems. . . . Whether we like
it or not, the world is gravitating towards faith in the Almighty and
justice and the will of God will prevail over all things.&quot;

This is the language of political theology, and for millennia it was
the only tongue human beings had for expressing their thoughts about
political life. It is primordial, but also contemporary: countless
millions still pursue the age-old quest to bring the whole of human
life under God's authority, and they have their reasons. To understand
them we need only interpret the language of political theology - yet
that is what we find hardest to do. Reading a letter like
Ahmadinejad's, we fall mute, like explorers coming upon an ancient
inscription written in hieroglyphics.

The problem is ours, not his. A little more than two centuries ago we
began to believe that the West was on a one-way track toward modern
secular democracy and that other societies, once placed on that track,
would inevitably follow. Though this has not happened, we still
maintain our implicit faith in a modernizing process and blame delays
on extenuating circumstances like poverty or colonialism. This
assumption shapes the way we see political theology, especially in its
Islamic form - as an atavism requiring psychological or sociological
analysis but not serious intellectual engagement. Islamists, even if
they are learned professionals, appear to us primarily as frustrated,
irrational representatives of frustrated, irrational societies,
nothing more. We live, so to speak, on the other shore. When we
observe those on the opposite bank, we are puzzled, since we have only
a distant memory of what it was like to think as they do. We all face
the same questions of political existence, yet their way of answering
them has become alien to us. On one shore, political institutions are
conceived in terms of divine authority and spiritual redemption; on
the other they are not. And that, as Robert Frost might have put it,
makes all the difference.

Understanding this difference is the most urgent intellectual and
political task of the present time. But where to begin? The case of
contemporary Islam is on everyone's mind, yet is so suffused with
anger and ignorance as to be paralyzing. All we hear are alien sounds,
motivating unspeakable acts. If we ever hope to crack the grammar and
syntax of political theology, it seems we will have to begin with
ourselves. The history of political theology in the West is an
instructive story, and it did not end with the birth of modern
science, or the Enlightenment, or the American and French Revolutions,
or any other definitive historical moment. Political theology was a
presence in Western intellectual life well into the 20th century, by
which time it had shed the mind-set of the Middle Ages and found
modern reasons for seeking political inspiration in the Bible. At
first, this modern political theology expressed a seemingly
enlightened outlook and was welcomed by those who wished liberal
democracy well. But in the aftermath of the First World War it took an
apocalyptic turn, and &quot;new men&quot; eager to embrace the future began
generating theological justifications for the most repugnant - and
godless - ideologies of the age, Nazism and Communism.

It is an unnerving tale, one that raises profound questions about the
fragility of our modern outlook. Even the most stable and successful
democracies, with the most high-minded and civilized believers, have
proved vulnerable to political messianism and its theological
justification. If we can understand how that was possible in the
advanced West, if we can hear political theology speaking in a more
recognizable tongue, represented by people in familiar dress with
familiar names, perhaps then we can remind ourselves how the world
looks from its perspective. This would be a small step toward
measuring the challenge we face and deciding how to respond.

II. The Great Separation

Why is there political theology? The question echoes throughout the
history of Western thought, beginning in Greek and Roman antiquity and
continuing down to our day. Many theories have been proposed,
especially by those suspicious of the religious impulse. Yet few
recognize the rationality of political theology or enter into its
logic. Theology is, after all, a set of reasons people give themselves
for the way things are and the way they ought to be. So let us try to
imagine how those reasons might involve God and have implications for
politics.

Imagine human beings who first become aware of themselves in a world
not of their own making. Their world has unknown origins and behaves
in a regular fashion, so they wonder why that is. They know that the
things they themselves fashion behave in a predictable manner because
they conceive and construct them with some end in mind. They stretch
the bow, the arrow flies; that is why they were made. So, by analogy,
it is not difficult for them to assume that the cosmic order was
constructed for a purpose, reflecting its maker's will. By following
this analogy, they begin to have ideas about that maker, about his
intentions and therefore about his personality.

In taking these few short steps, the human mind finds itself
confronted with a picture, a theological image in which God, man and
world form a divine nexus. Believers have reasons for thinking that
they live in this nexus, just as they have reasons for assuming that
it offers guidance for political life. But how that guidance is to be
understood, and whether believers think it is authoritative, will
depend on how they imagine God. If God is thought to be passive, a
silent force like the sky, nothing in particular may follow. He is a
hypothesis we can do without. But if we take seriously the thought
that God is a person with intentions, and that the cosmic order is a
result of those intentions, then a great deal can follow. The
intentions of such a God reveal something man cannot fully know on his
own. This revelation then becomes the source of his authority, over
nature and over us, and we have no choice but to obey him and see that
his plans are carried out on earth. That is where political theology
comes in.

One powerful attraction of political theology, in any form, is its
comprehensiveness. It offers a way of thinking about the conduct of
human affairs and connects those thoughts to loftier ones about the
existence of God, the structure of the cosmos, the nature of the soul,
the origin of all things and the end of time. For more than a
millennium, the West took inspiration from the Christian image of a
triune God ruling over a created cosmos and guiding men by means of
revelation, inner conviction and the natural order. It was a
magnificent picture that allowed a magnificent and powerful
civilization to flower. But the picture was always difficult to
translate theologically into political form: God the Father had given
commandments; a Redeemer arrived, reinterpreting them, then departed;
and now the Holy Spirit remained as a ghostly divine presence. It was
not at all clear what political lessons were to be drawn from all
this. Were Christians supposed to withdraw from a corrupted world that
was abandoned by the Redeemer? Were they called upon to rule the
earthly city with both church and state, inspired by the Holy Spirit?
Or were they expected to build a New Jerusalem that would hasten the
Messiah's return?

Throughout the Middle Ages, Christians argued over these questions.
The City of Man was set against the City of God, public citizenship
against private piety, the divine right of kings against the right of
resistance, church authority against radical antinomianism, canon law
against mystical insight, inquisitor against martyr, secular sword
against ecclesiastical miter, prince against emperor, emperor against
pope, pope against church councils. In the late Middle Ages, the sense
of crisis was palpable, and even the Roman Church recognized that
reforms were in order. But by the 16th century, thanks to Martin
Luther and John Calvin, there was no unified Christendom to reform,
just a variety of churches and sects, most allied with absolute
secular rulers eager to assert their independence. In the Wars of
Religion that followed, doctrinal differences fueled political
ambitions and vice versa, in a deadly, vicious cycle that lasted a
century and a half. Christians addled by apocalyptic dreams hunted and
killed Christians with a maniacal fury they had once reserved for
Muslims, Jews and heretics. It was madness.

The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes tried to find a way out of this
labyrinth. Traditionally, political theology had interpreted a set of
revealed divine commands and applied them to social life. In his great
treatise &quot;Leviathan&quot; (1651), Hobbes simply ignored the substance of
those commands and talked instead about how and why human beings
believed God revealed them. He did the most revolutionary thing a
thinker can ever do - he changed the subject, from God and his
commands to man and his beliefs. If we do that, Hobbes reasoned, we
can begin to understand why religious convictions so often lead to
political conflicts and then perhaps find a way to contain the
potential for violence.

The contemporary crisis in Western Christendom created an audience for
Hobbes and his ideas. In the midst of religious war, his view that the
human mind was too weak and beset by passions to have any reliable
knowledge of the divine seemed common-sensical. It also made sense to
assume that when man speaks about God he is really referring to his
own experience, which is all he knows. And what most characterizes his
experience? According to Hobbes, fear. Man's natural state is to be
overwhelmed with anxiety, &quot;his heart all the day long gnawed on by
fear of death, poverty, or other calamity.&quot; He &quot;has no repose, nor
pause of his anxiety, but in sleep.&quot; It is no wonder that human beings
fashion idols to protect themselves from what they most fear,
attributing divine powers even, as Hobbes wrote, to &quot;men, women, a
bird, a crocodile, a calf, a dog, a snake, an onion, a leek.&quot; Pitiful,
but understandable.

And the debilitating dynamics of belief don't end there. For once we
imagine an all-powerful God to protect us, chances are we'll begin to
fear him too. What if he gets angry? How can we appease him? Hobbes
reasoned that these new religious fears were what created a market for
priests and prophets claiming to understand God's obscure demands. It
was a raucous market in Hobbes's time, with stalls for Roman
Catholics, Anglicans, Lutherans, Calvinists, Anabaptists, Quakers,
Ranters, Muggletonians, Fifth Monarchy Men and countless others, each
with his own path to salvation and blueprint for Christian society.
They disagreed with one another, and because their very souls were at
stake, they fought. Which led to wars; which led to more fear; which
made people more religious; which. . . .

Fresh from the Wars of Religion, Hobbes's readers knew all about fear.
Their lives had become, as he put it, &quot;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish,
and short.&quot; And when he announced that a new political philosophy
could release them from fear, they listened. Hobbes planted a seed, a
thought that it might be possible to build legitimate political
institutions without grounding them on divine revelation. He knew it
was impossible to refute belief in divine revelation; the most one can
hope to do is cast suspicion on prophets claiming to speak about
politics in God's name. The new political thinking would no longer
concern itself with God's politics; it would concentrate on men as
believers in God and try to keep them from harming one another. It
would set its sights lower than Christian political theology had, but
secure what mattered most, which was peace.

Hobbes was neither a liberal nor a democrat. He thought that
consolidating power in the hands of one man was the only way to
relieve citizens of their mutual fears. But over the next few
centuries, Western thinkers like John Locke, who adopted his approach,
began to imagine a new kind of political order in which power would be
limited, divided and widely shared; in which those in power at one
moment would relinquish it peacefully at another, without fear of
retribution; in which public law would govern relations among citizens
and institutions; in which many different religions would be allowed
to flourish, free from state interference; and in which individuals
would have inalienable rights to protect them from government and
their fellows. This liberal-democratic order is the only one we in the
West recognize as legitimate today, and we owe it primarily to Hobbes.
In order to escape the destructive passions of messianic faith,
political theology centered on God was replaced by political
philosophy centered on man. This was the Great Separation.

III. The Inner Light

It is a familiar story, and seems to conclude with a happy ending. But
in truth the Great Separation was never a fait accompli, even in
Western Europe, where it was first conceived. Old-style Christian
political theology had an afterlife in the West, and only after the
Second World War did it cease to be a political force. In the 19th and
early 20th centuries a different challenge to the Great Separation
arose from another quarter. It came from a wholly new kind of
political theology heavily indebted to philosophy and styling itself
both modern and liberal. I am speaking of the &quot;liberal theology&quot;
movement that arose in Germany not long after the French Revolution,
first among Protestant theologians, then among Jewish reformers. These
thinkers, who abhorred theocracy, also rebelled against Hobbes's
vision, favoring instead a political future in which religion -
properly chastened and intellectually reformed - would play an
absolutely central role.

And the questions they posed were good ones. While granting that
ignorance and fear had bred pointless wars among Christian sects and
nations, they asked: Were those the only reasons that, for a
millennium and a half, an entire civilization had looked to Jesus
Christ as its savior? Or that suffering Jews of the Diaspora remained
loyal to the Torah? Could ignorance and fear explain the beauty of
Christian liturgical music or the sublimity of the Gothic cathedrals?
Could they explain why all other civilizations, past and present,
founded their political institutions in accordance with the divine
nexus of God, man and world? Surely there was more to religious man
than was dreamed of in Hobbes's philosophy.

That certainly was the view of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who did more
than anyone to develop an alternative to Hobbes. Rousseau wrote no
treatise on religion, which was probably a wise thing, since when he
inserted a few pages on religious themes into his masterpiece,
&quot;Ãmile&quot; (1762), it caused the book to be burned and Rousseau to spend
the rest of his life on the run. This short section of &quot;Ãmile,&quot; which
he called &quot;The Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar,&quot; has so
deeply shaped contemporary views of religion that it takes some effort
to understand why Rousseau was persecuted for writing it. It is the
most beautiful and convincing defense of man's religious instincts
ever to flow from a modern pen - and that, apparently, was the
problem. Rousseau spoke of religion in terms of human needs, not
divine truths, and had his Savoyard vicar declare, &quot;I believe all
particular religions are good when one serves God usefully in them.&quot;
For that, he was hounded by pious Christians.

Rousseau had a Hobbes problem, too: he shared the Englishman's
criticisms of theocracy, fanaticism and the clergy, but he was a
friend of religion. While Hobbes beat the drums of ignorance and fear,
Rousseau sang the praises of conscience, of charity, of fellow
feeling, of virtue, of pious wonder in the face of God's creation.
Human beings, he thought, have a natural goodness they express in
their religion. That is the theme of the &quot;Profession of Faith,&quot; which
tells the parable of a young vicar who loses his faith and then his
moral compass once confronted with the hypocrisy of his co-
religionists. He is able to restore his equilibrium only when he finds
a new kind of faith in God by looking within, to his own &quot;inner
light&quot; (lumière intérieure). The point of Rousseau's story is less to
display the crimes of organized churches than to show that man yearns
for religion because he is fundamentally a moral creature. There is
much we cannot know about God, and for centuries the pretense of
having understood him caused much damage to Christendom. But, for
Rousseau, we need to believe something about him if we are to orient
ourselves in the world.

Among modern thinkers, Rousseau was the first to declare that there is
no shame in saying that faith in God is humanly necessary. Religion
has its roots in needs that are rational and moral, even noble; once
we see that, we can start satisfying them rationally, morally and
nobly. In the abstract, this thought did not contradict the principles
of the Great Separation, which gave reasons for protecting the private
exercise of religion. But it did raise doubts about whether the new
political thinking could really do without reference to the nexus of
God, man and world. If Rousseau was right about our moral needs, a
rigid separation between political and theological principles might
not be psychologically sustainable. When a question is important, we
want an answer to it: as the Savoyard vicar remarks, &quot;The mind decides
in one way or another, despite itself, and prefers being mistaken to
believing in nothing.&quot; Rousseau had grave doubts about whether human
beings could be happy or good if they did not understand how their
actions related to something higher. Religion is simply too entwined
with our moral experience ever to be disentangled from it, and
morality is inseparable from politics.

IV. Rousseau's Children

By the early 19th century, two schools of thought about religion and
politics had grown up in the West. Let us call them the children of
Hobbes and the children of Rousseau. For the children of Hobbes, a
decent political life could not be realized by Christian political
theology, which bred violence and stifled human development. The only
way to control the passions flowing from religion to politics, and
back again, was to detach political life from them completely. This
had to happen within Western institutions, but first it had to happen
within Western minds. A reorientation would have to take place,
turning human attention away from the eternal and transcendent, toward
the here and now. The old habit of looking to God for political
guidance would have to be broken, and new habits developed. For
Hobbes, the first step toward achieving that end was to get people
thinking about - and suspicious about - the sources of faith.

Though there was great reluctance to adopt Hobbes's most radical views
on religion, in the English-speaking world the intellectual principles
of the Great Separation began to take hold in the 18th century. Debate
would continue over where exactly to place the line between religious
and political institutions, but arguments about the legitimacy of
theocracy petered out in all but the most forsaken corners of the
public square. There was no longer serious controversy about the
relation between the political order and the divine nexus; it ceased
to be a question. No one in modern Britain or the United States argued
for a bicameral legislature on the basis of divine revelation.

The children of Rousseau followed a different line of argument.
Medieval political theology was not salvageable, but neither could
human beings ignore questions of eternity and transcendence when
thinking about the good life. When we speculate about God, man and
world in the correct way, we express our noblest moral sentiments;
without such reflection we despair and eventually harm ourselves and
others. That is the lesson of the Savoyard vicar.

In the aftermath of the French Revolution, the Terror and Napoleon's
conquests, Rousseau's children found a receptive audience in
continental Europe. The recent wars had had nothing to do with
political theology or religious fanaticism of the old variety; if
anything, people reasoned, it was the radical atheism of the French
Enlightenment that turned men into beasts and bred a new species of
political fanatic. Germans were especially drawn to this view, and a
wave of romanticism brought with it great nostalgia for the religious
&quot;world we have lost.&quot; It even touched sober philosophers like Immanuel
Kant and G. W. F. Hegel. Kant adored &quot;Ãmile&quot; and went somewhat further
than Rousseau had, not only accepting the moral need for rational
faith but arguing that Christianity, properly reformed, would
represent the &quot;true universal Church&quot; and embody the very &quot;idea&quot; of
religion. Hegel went further still, attributing to religion an almost
vitalistic power to forge the social bond and encourage sacrifice for
the public good. Religion, and religion alone, is the original source
of a people's shared spirit, which Hegel called its Volksgeist.

These ideas had an enormous impact on German religious thought in the
19th century, and through it on Protestantism and Judaism throughout
the West. This was the century of &quot;liberal theology,&quot; a term that
requires explanation. In modern Britain and the United States, it was
assumed that the intellectual, and then institutional, separation of
Christianity and modern politics had been mutually beneficial - that
the modern state had benefited by being absolved from pronouncing on
doctrinal matters, and that Christianity had benefited by being freed
from state interference. No such consensus existed in Germany, where
the assumption was that religion needed to be publicly encouraged, not
reined in, if it was to contribute to society. It would have to be
rationally reformed, of course: the Bible would have to be interpreted
in light of recent historical findings, belief in miracles abandoned,
the clergy educated along modern lines and doctrine adapted to a
softer age. But once these reforms were in place, enlightened politics
and enlightened religion would join hands.

Protestant liberal theologians soon began to dream of a third way
between Christian orthodoxy and the Great Separation. They had
unshaken faith in the moral core of Christianity, however distorted it
may have been by the forces of history, and unshaken faith in the
cultural and political progress that Christianity had brought to the
world. Christianity had given birth to the values of individuality,
moral universalism, reason and progress on which German life was now
based. There could be no contradiction between religion and state, or
even tension. The modern state had only to give Protestantism its due
in public life, and Protestant theology would reciprocate by
recognizing its political responsibilities. If both parties met their
obligations, then, as the philosopher F. W. J. Schelling put it, &quot;the
destiny of Christianity will be decided in Germany.&quot;

Among Jewish liberal thinkers, there was a different sort of hope,
that of acceptance as equal citizens. After the French Revolution, a
fitful process of Jewish emancipation began in Europe, and German Jews
were more quickly integrated into modern cultural life than in any
other European country - a fateful development. For it was precisely
at this moment that German Protestants were becoming convinced that
reformed Christianity represented their national Volksgeist. While the
liberal Jewish thinkers were attracted to modern enlightened faith,
they were also driven by the apologetic need to justify Judaism's
contribution to German society. They could not appeal to the
principles of the Great Separation and simply demand to be left alone.
They had to argue that Judaism and Protestantism were two forms of the
same rational moral faith, and that they could share a political
theology. As the Jewish philosopher and liberal reformer Hermann Cohen
once put it, &quot;In all intellectual questions of religion we think and
feel ourselves in a Protestant spirit.&quot;

V. Courting the Apocalypse

This was the house that liberal theology built, and throughout the
19th century it looked secure. It wasn't, and for reasons worth
pondering. Liberal theology had begun in hope that the moral truths of
biblical faith might be intellectually reconciled with, and not just
accommodated to, the realities of modern political life. Yet the
liberal deity turned out to be a stillborn God, unable to inspire
genuine conviction among a younger generation seeking ultimate truth.
For what did the new Protestantism offer the soul of one seeking union
with his creator? It prescribed a catechism of moral commonplaces and
historical optimism about bourgeois life, spiced with deep pessimism
about the possibility of altering that life. It preached good
citizenship and national pride, economic good sense and the proper
length of a gentleman's beard. But it was too ashamed to proclaim the
message found on every page of the Gospels: that you must change your
life. And what did the new Judaism bring to a young Jew seeking a
connection with the traditional faith of his people? It taught him to
appreciate the ethical message at the core of all biblical faith and
passed over in genteel silence the fearsome God of the prophets, his
covenant with the Jewish people and the demanding laws he gave them.
Above all, it taught a young Jew that his first obligation was to seek
common ground with Christianity and find acceptance in the one nation,
Germany, whose highest cultural ideals matched those of Judaism,
properly understood. To the decisive questions - &quot;Why be a Christian?&quot;
and &quot;Why be a Jew?&quot; - liberal theology offered no answer at all.

By the turn of the 20th century, the liberal house was tottering, and
after the First World War it collapsed. It was not just the barbarity
of trench warfare, the senseless slaughter, the sight of burned-out
towns and maimed soldiers that made a theology extolling &quot;modern
civilization&quot; contemptible. It was that so many liberal theologians
had hastened the insane rush to war, confident that God's hand was
guiding history. In August 1914, Adolf von Harnack, the most respected
liberal Protestant scholar of the age, helped Kaiser Wilhelm II draft
an address to the nation laying out German military aims. Others
signed an infamous pro-war petition defending the sacredness of German
militarism. Astonishingly, even Hermann Cohen joined the chorus,
writing an open letter to American Jews asking for support, on the
grounds that &quot;next to his fatherland, every Western Jew must
recognize, revere and love Germany as the motherland of his modern
religiosity.&quot; Young Protestant and Jewish thinkers were outraged when
they saw what their revered teachers had done, and they began to look
elsewhere.

But they did not turn to Hobbes, or to Rousseau. They craved a more
robust faith, based on a new revelation that would shake the
foundations of the whole modern order. It was a thirst for redemption.
Ever since the liberal theologians had revived the idea of biblical
politics, the stage had been set for just this sort of development.
When faith in redemption through bourgeois propriety and cultural
accommodation withered after the Great War, the most daring thinkers
of the day transformed it into hope for a messianic apocalypse - one
that would again place the Jewish people, or the individual Christian
believer, or the German nation, or the world proletariat in direct
relation with the divine.

Young Weimar Jews were particularly drawn to these messianic currents
through the writings of Martin Buber, who later became a proponent of
interfaith understanding but as a young Zionist promoted a crude
chauvinistic nationalism. In an early essay he called for a &quot;Masada of
the spirit&quot; and proclaimed: &quot;If I had to choose for my people between
a comfortable, unproductive happiness . . . and a beautiful death in a
final effort at life, I would have to choose the latter. For this
final effort would create something divine, if only for a moment, but
the other something all too human.&quot; Language like this, with strong
and discomforting contemporary echoes for us, drew deeply from the
well of biblical messianism. Yet Buber was an amateur compared with
the Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch, who used the Bible to extol the
utopia then under construction in the Soviet Union. Though an atheist
Jew, Bloch saw a connection between messianic hope and revolutionary
violence, which he admired from a distance. He celebrated Thomas
MÃ¼ntzer, the 16th-century Protestant pastor who led bloody peasant
uprisings and was eventually beheaded; he also praised the brutal
Soviet leaders, famously declaring &quot;ubi Lenin, ibi Jerusalem&quot; -
wherever Lenin is, there is Jerusalem.

But it was among young Weimar Protestants that the new messianic
spirit proved most consequential. They were led by the greatest
theologian of the day, Karl Barth, who wanted to restore the drama of
religious decision to Christianity and rejected any accommodation of
the Gospel to modern sensibilities. When Hitler came to power, Barth
acquitted himself well, leading resistance against the Nazi takeover
of the Protestant churches before he was forced into exile in 1935.
But others, who employed the same messianic rhetoric Barth did, chose
the Nazis instead. A notorious example was Emanuel Hirsch, a respected
Lutheran theologian and translator of Kierkegaard, who welcomed the
Nazi seizure of power for bringing Germany into &quot;the circle of the
white ruling peoples, to which God has entrusted the responsibility
for the history of humanity.&quot; Another was Friedrich Gogarten, one of
Barth's closest collaborators, who sided with the Nazis in the summer
of 1933 (a decision he later regretted). In the 1920s, Gogarten
rejoiced at the collapse of bourgeois Europe, declaring that &quot;we are
glad for the decline, since no one enjoys living among corpses,&quot; and
called for a new religion that &quot;attacks culture as culture . . . that
attacks the whole world.&quot; When the brownshirts began marching and
torching books, he got his wish. After Hitler completed his takeover,
Gogarten wrote that &quot;precisely because we are today once again under
the total claim of the state, it is again possible, humanly speaking,
to proclaim the Christ of the Bible and his reign over us.&quot;

All of which served to confirm Hobbes's iron law: Messianic theology
eventually breeds messianic politics. The idea of redemption is among
the most powerful forces shaping human existence in all those
societies touched by the biblical tradition. It has inspired people to
endure suffering, overcome suffering and inflict suffering on others.
It has offered hope and inspiration in times of darkness; it has also
added to the darkness by arousing unrealistic expectations and
justifying those who spill blood to satisfy them. All the biblical
religions cultivate the idea of redemption, and all fear its power to
inflame minds and deafen them to the voice of reason. In the writings
of these Weimar figures, we encounter what those orthodox traditions
always dreaded: the translation of religious notions of apocalypse and
redemption into a justification of political messianism, now under
frightening modern conditions. It was as if nothing had changed since
the 17th century, when Thomas Hobbes first sat down to write his
&quot;Leviathan.&quot;

VI. Miracles

The revival of political theology in the modern West is a humbling
story. It reminds us that this way of thinking is not the preserve of
any one culture or religion, nor does it belong solely to the past. It
is an age-old habit of mind that can be reacquired by anyone who
begins looking to the divine nexus of God, man and world to reveal the
legitimate political order. This story also reminds us how political
theology can be adapted to circumstances and reassert itself, even in
the face of seemingly irresistible forces like modernization,
secularization and democratization. Rousseau was on to something: we
seem to be theotropic creatures, yearning to connect our mundane
lives, in some way, to the beyond. That urge can be suppressed, new
habits learned, but the challenge of political theology will never
fully disappear so long as the urge to connect survives.

So we are heirs to the Great Separation only if we wish to be, if we
make a conscious effort to separate basic principles of political
legitimacy from divine revelation. Yet more is required still. Since
the challenge of political theology is enduring, we need to remain
aware of its logic and the threat it poses. This means vigilance, but
even more it means self-awareness. We must never forget that there was
nothing historically inevitable about our Great Separation, that it
was and remains an experiment. In Europe, the political ambiguities of
one religion, Christianity, happened to set off a political crisis
that might have been avoided but wasn't, triggering the Wars of
Religion; the resulting carnage made European thinkers more receptive
to Hobbes's heretical ideas about religious psychology and the
political implications he drew from them; and over time those
political ideas were liberalized. Even then, it was only after the
Second World War that the principles of modern liberal democracy
became fully rooted in continental Europe.

As for the American experience, it is utterly exceptional: there is no
other fully developed industrial society with a population so
committed to its faiths (and such exotic ones), while being equally
committed to the Great Separation. Our political rhetoric, which owes
much to the Protestant sectarians of the 17th century, vibrates with
messianic energy, and it is only thanks to a strong constitutional
structure and various lucky breaks that political theology has never
seriously challenged the basic legitimacy of our institutions.
Americans have potentially explosive religious differences over
abortion, prayer in schools, censorship, euthanasia, biological
research and countless other issues, yet they generally settle them
within the bounds of the Constitution. It's a miracle.

And miracles can't be willed. For all the good Hobbes did in shifting
our political focus from God to man, he left the impression that the
challenge of political theology would vanish once the cycle of fear
was broken and human beings established authority over their own
affairs. We still make this assumption when speaking of the &quot;social
causes&quot; of fundamentalism and political messianism, as if the
amelioration of material conditions or the shifting of borders would
automatically trigger a Great Separation. Nothing in our history or
contemporary experience confirms this belief, yet somehow we can't let
it go. We have learned Hobbes's lesson too well, and failed to heed
Rousseau's. And so we find ourselves in an intellectual bind when we
encounter genuine political theology today: either we assume that
modernization and secularization will eventually extinguish it, or we
treat it as an incomprehensible existential threat, using familiar
terms like fascism to describe it as best we can. Neither response
takes us a step closer to understanding the world we now live in.

It is a world in which millions of people, particularly in the Muslim
orbit, believe that God has revealed a law governing the whole of
human affairs. This belief shapes the politics of important Muslim
nations, and it also shapes the attitudes of vast numbers of believers
who find themselves living in Western countries - and non-Western
democracies like Turkey and Indonesia - founded on the alien
principles of the Great Separation. These are the most significant
points of friction, internationally and domestically. And we cannot
really address them if we do not first recognize the intellectual
chasm between us: although it is possible to translate Ahmadinejad's
letter to Bush from Farsi into English, its intellectual assumptions
cannot be translated into those of the Great Separation. We can try to
learn his language in order to create sensible policies, but agreement
on basic principles won't be possible. And we must learn to live with
that.

Similarly, we must somehow find a way to accept the fact that, given
the immigration policies Western nations have pursued over the last
half-century, they now are hosts to millions of Muslims who have great
difficulty fitting into societies that do not recognize any political
claims based on their divine revelation. Like Orthodox Jewish law, the
Muslim Shariah is meant to cover the whole of life, not some
arbitrarily demarcated private sphere, and its legal system has few
theological resources for establishing the independence of politics
from detailed divine commands. It is an unfortunate situation, but we
have made our bed, Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Accommodation and
mutual respect can help, as can clear rules governing areas of
tension, like the status of women, parents' rights over their
children, speech offensive to religious sensibilities, speech inciting
violence, standards of dress in public institutions and the like.
Western countries have adopted different strategies for coping, some
forbidding religious symbols like the head scarf in schools, others
permitting them. But we need to recognize that coping is the order of
the day, not defending high principle, and that our expectations
should remain low. So long as a sizable population believes in the
truth of a comprehensive political theology, its full reconciliation
with modern liberal democracy cannot be expected.

VII. The Opposite Shore

This is not welcome news. For more than two centuries, promoters of
modernization have taken it for granted that science, technology,
urbanization and education would eventually &quot;disenchant&quot; the charmed
world of believers, and that with time people would either abandon
their traditional faiths or transform them in politically anodyne
ways. They point to continental Europe, where belief in God has been
in steady decline over the last 50 years, and suggest that, with time,
Muslims everywhere will undergo a similar transformation. Those
predictions may eventually prove right. But Europe's rapid
secularization is historically unique and, as we have just seen,
relatively recent. Political theology is highly adaptive and can
present to even educated minds a more compelling vision of the future
than the prospect of secular modernity. It takes as little for a
highly trained medical doctor to fashion a car bomb today as it took
for advanced thinkers to fashion biblically inspired justifications of
fascist and communist totalitarianism in Weimar Germany. When the urge
to connect is strong, passions are high and fantasies are vivid, the
trinkets of our modern lives are impotent amulets against political
intoxication.

Realizing this, a number of Muslim thinkers around the world have
taken to promoting a &quot;liberal&quot; Islam. What they mean is an Islam more
adapted to the demands of modern life, kinder in its treatment of
women and children, more tolerant of other faiths, more open to
dissent. These are brave people who have often suffered for their
efforts, in prison or exile, as did their predecessors in the 19th
century, of which there were many. But now as then, their efforts have
been swept away by deeper theological currents they cannot master and
perhaps do not even understand. The history of Protestant and Jewish
liberal theology reveals the problem: the more a biblical faith is
trimmed to fit the demands of the moment, the fewer reasons it gives
believers for holding on to that faith in troubled times, when self-
appointed guardians of theological purity offer more radical hope.
Worse still, when such a faith is used to bestow theological
sanctification on a single form of political life - even an attractive
one like liberal democracy - the more it will be seen as collaborating
with injustice when that political system fails. The dynamics of
political theology seem to dictate that when liberalizing reformers
try to conform to the present, they inspire a countervailing and far
more passionate longing for redemption in the messianic future. That
is what happened in Weimar Germany and is happening again in
contemporary Islam.

The complacent liberalism and revolutionary messianism we've
encountered are not the only theological options. There is another
kind of transformation possible in biblical faiths, and that is the
renewal of traditional political theology from within. If liberalizers
are apologists for religion at the court of modern life, renovators
stand firmly within their faith and reinterpret political theology so
believers can adapt without feeling themselves to be apostates. Luther
and Calvin were renovators in this sense, not liberalizers. They
called Christians back to the fundamentals of their faith, but in a
way that made it easier, not harder, to enjoy the fruits of temporal
existence. They found theological reasons to reject the ideal of
celibacy, and its frequent violation by priests, and thus returned the
clergy to ordinary family life. They then found theological reasons to
reject otherworldly monasticism and the all-too-worldly imperialism of
Rome, offering biblical reasons that Christians should be loyal
citizens of the state they live in. And they did this, not by speaking
the apologetic language of toleration and progress, but by rewriting
the language of Christian political theology and demanding that
Christians be faithful to it.

Today, a few voices are calling for just this kind of renewal of
Islamic political theology. Some, like Khaled Abou El Fadl, a law
professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, challenge the
authority of today's puritans, who make categorical judgments based on
a literal reading of scattered Koranic verses. In Abou El Fadl's view,
traditional Islamic law can still be applied to present-day situations
because it brings a subtle interpretation of the whole text to bear on
particular problems in varied circumstances. Others, like the Swiss-
born cleric and professor Tariq Ramadan, are public figures whose
writings show Western Muslims that their political theology, properly
interpreted, offers guidance for living with confidence in their faith
and gaining acceptance in what he calls an alien &quot;abode.&quot; To read
their works is to be reminded what a risky venture renewal is. It can
invite believers to participate more fully and wisely in the political
present, as the Protestant Reformation eventually did; it can also
foster dreams of returning to a more primitive faith, through violence
if necessary, as happened in the Wars of Religion.

Perhaps for this reason, Abou El Fadl and especially Ramadan have
become objects of intense and sometimes harsh scrutiny by Western
intellectuals. We prefer speaking with the Islamic liberalizers
because they share our language: they accept the intellectual
presuppositions of the Great Separation and simply want maximum room
given for religious and cultural expression. They do not practice
political theology. But the prospects of enduring political change
through renewal are probably much greater than through liberalization.
By speaking from within the community of the faithful, renovators give
believers compelling theological reasons for accepting new ways as
authentic reinterpretations of the faith. Figures like Abou El Fadl
and Ramadan speak a strange tongue, even when promoting changes we
find worthy; their reasons are not our reasons. But if we cannot
expect mass conversion to the principles of the Great Separation - and
we cannot - we had better learn to welcome transformations in Muslim
political theology that ease coexistence. The best should not be the
enemy of the good.

In the end, though, what happens on the opposite shore will not be up
to us. We have little reason to expect societies in the grip of a
powerful political theology to follow our unusual path, which was
opened up by a unique crisis within Christian civilization. This does
not mean that those societies necessarily lack the wherewithal to
create a decent and workable political order; it does mean that they
will have to find the theological resources within their own
traditions to make it happen.

Our challenge is different. We have made a choice that is at once
simpler and harder: we have chosen to limit our politics to protecting
individuals from the worst harms they can inflict on one another, to
securing fundamental liberties and providing for their basic welfare,
while leaving their spiritual destinies in their own hands. We have
wagered that it is wiser to beware the forces unleashed by the Bible's
messianic promise than to try exploiting them for the public good. We
have chosen to keep our politics unilluminated by divine revelation.
All we have is our own lucidity, which we must train on a world where
faith still inflames the minds of men.
