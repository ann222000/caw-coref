I've been searching for an Arcade &quot;Marvel Land&quot; game for a long time
and have never seen one.  I can't even find a picture of the actual
arcade machine.  Does this game exist anywhere other than on console
machines?

I'd like to have a Taito CRAZY CLIMBER. But the only one I've seen in
the last 10 or 15 years was at a whholesaler's warehouse 3 years ago,
and IT WAS ALREADY SPOKEN FOR. DAMN!

Mine is old school, I want an Atari Space Race.  It is the first video
game I can remember playing.  It was at a hotel out in CA around 74 or
75.  It just brings back memories.  Any out there in Chicago area?

I've been trying to get hold of a XEXEX board for some time.

I'd like to find a working Berzerk at a good price.  You just don't
see them often.

I don't think I have ever seen a complete Black Widow.

But I would have to find about 25 square feet of space before I can
find any more games.

I saw a PacLand a few years ago (03' or 04') at Coinopwarehouse in
Md., but I didn't inquire about the price.  I have one that's been
converted to SHINOBI, and still has the original cab colors. I also
have one working PACLAND board that I'll never part with. One game I
have NOT seen complete hardly in the last 15 years or so is FRENZY. I
don't even see the converted cabinets too often, and the strange thing
is THEY MADE A TON OF THEM!!!

I've seen the one on Ebay and Klov.  I think I have even seen
converted cabs at auctions. I own a version of it on the Atari
something for PS2.

I have just never had my hands on a complete working one to play.  But
it looks like one hell of a game.  I think berzerk might be just as
fun to play but I bet it won't have that frantic heart pumping pace
that Black widow has.  Or I assume it has.  After all, its an Atari
game.

For me, it would be a Crossbow or a Hogan's Alley.  I don't know how
much I'd pay since I'm cheap, but I'd love either one.

There was a very sweet Crazy Climber at the St. Louis/Bellville
auction about a year ago (at the ice'd out auction no-one went to).
Got a ton of traffic by it.  Not sure how much it went for.

Jon

p.s. Try googling &quot;Marvel Land&quot;.  There's a wiki (http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Land) in addition to a site dedicated to
the port ( http://marvelland.vimscape.com/ ).  Seems to run fine in MAME
if you need your fix...
