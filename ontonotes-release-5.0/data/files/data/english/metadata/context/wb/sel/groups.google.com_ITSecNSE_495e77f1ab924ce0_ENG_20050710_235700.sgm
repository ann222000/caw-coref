Hacking for dollars
By Joris Evers

&quot;&quot;

Hackers have traded fame for financial gain, experts say.

In the past, lone hackers defaced Web sites or launched global worm attacks,
mainly to gain notoriety among their peers.

Today, they use their skills for profit. They hunt for security flaws and
find ways to exploit them, hijack computers and rent those out for use as
spam relays, or participate in targeted attacks that steal sensitive
information from individuals or spy on businesses.

What's new:
In the past, hackers wanted to gain notoriety by writing the biggest worm
they could. These days, they're more likely to be motivated by money.

Bottom line:
Though the shift could lead to a drop-off in global worms, it still spells
trouble. The targeted attacks crafted by businesslike hackers are likely to
hit harder.

&quot;In the last year, we have seen a dramatic shift to hacking for financial
gain,&quot; said Oliver Friedrichs, a senior manager at Symantec Security
Response. &quot;The benefit of creating a widespread worm on the Internet has
really been superseded by the potential of monetary gain.&quot;

Though the shift could mean the end of big worms like last year's HYPERLINK
&quot;&quot;Sasser, it still
spells trouble. The targeted attacks crafted by businesslike hackers can hit
individuals and organizations harder--and in the pocket, rather than just in
the PC.

There is an underground market. A hacker who finds a way to exploit a
security hole in Windows could earn up to $1,000, or much more if the hole
is not yet known to Microsoft or anyone else, said Dmitri Alperovitch, a
research engineer at security vendor CipherTrust.

That flaw could then be used to hijack PCs. These compromised systems,
called zombies, can then be used to relay spam, to host malicious Web sites
or to launch denial-of-service attacks--at a price. Spammers, phishers and
others who want to rent out a network of about 5,500 zombies typically pay
about $350 a week, according to security company Symantec.

These HYPERLINK
&quot;&quot;zombie networks,
known as &quot;botnets,&quot; are sometimes used to extort companies, who are
threatened with a denial-of-service onslaught aimed at hurting their
business. British online payment processing company Protx went offline after
an attack and was warned that problems would continue unless a $10,000
payment was made, according to a recent report in The New York Times.

The FBI has also seen an increase in hacking for money. &quot;We have seen a rise
in the cases where the motivation appears not just to be for purposes of
bragging in chat rooms, but to actually profit financially,&quot; said FBI
spokesman Paul Bresson.

Underground markets for selling credit card numbers, software
vulnerabilities or renting out botnets are also on the rise, he said. &quot;We're
seeing a lot more of that today then we ever have,&quot; Bresson said.

New breed
As the motive of those involved has changed, HYPERLINK
&quot;&quot;so has their
profile, Symantec's Friedrichs said. &quot;In the past, they were teenagers or
others who did it to gain notoriety. Today's hackers are white-collar
criminals and criminals in foreign countries,&quot; he said.

Among that group, though, are coders who realized that they could take the
hobby they had for years and turn it into a profitable business,
CipherTrust's Alperovitch said. &quot;Unless they are really good at it, they
probably won't become millionaires. But it is a good side business,&quot; he
said.

The change has been accompanied by an HYPERLINK
&quot;&quot;increasing ingenuity
in crafting attacks. HYPERLINK
&quot;&quot;Phishing scams, for
example, are becoming aimed at smaller groups of victims. Also, companies
are being targeted with Trojan horses meant to get access to corporate
networks or to enable industrial espionage.

&quot;The deception techniques are getting better, and the payload is also
getting more sophisticated,&quot; said Dan Hubbard, a senior director at
Websense, a San Diego, Calif.-based security vendor. &quot;As more money gets
made, the attacks get more sophisticated.&quot;

All this means that stakes are higher for individuals and for businesses
whose systems suffer an attack. With a worm, they might have had to apply a
patch or reinstall a PC. With financially motivated threats, victims could
have sensitive corporate information or their HYPERLINK
&quot;&quot;identity stolen.

One fraud area seeing a rise in activity--and therefore, a likely lift in
scam revenue--is phishing. These scams typically combine spam and fake Web
pages that look like trusted sites to try to trick the victim into divulging
sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers. The number
of phishing e-mails tracked by IBM's Global Business Security Index reached
an all-time high in May, the company said. It saw 9.14 million messages sent
to its customers, up from a previous high of 7.7 million in January.

Credit card data sells for up to $100 per account, according to a report on
the economy of phishing, released in June by San Francisco antispam provider
Cloudmark. The price depends on how high the limit is and how much
supporting information is supplied, though--an account with little
supporting information will go for much less. American Express cards fetch
more, as those come without a preset spending limit, experts said.

Symantec has seen a clear change in the malicious code, such as Trojan
horses, used in attacks. In the final six months of last year, 54 percent of
the attack code was targeted at obtaining personal data. That is up from 36
percent in the same period in 2003.

&quot;The motivation behind today's new e-mail-borne threats is far more sinister
than traditional large-scale attacks.&quot;
--Mark Sunner, chief technology officer, MessageLabs

But as victims lose more money, consumers' defenses in general go up,
Websense's Hubbard said. Many people now realize the importance of
installing security software and patches, and technology to fight phishing,
such as HYPERLINK
&quot;&quot;browser toolbars, is
becoming increasingly popular. Also, Microsoft has said it will include
phishing protection in Internet Explorer 7, a test version of which is due
out this year.

MessageLabs, an e-mail security company, has also spotted the trend of
targeted attacks--but this time, aimed at businesses. Last week, the company
said it had stopped e-mail messages containing a malicious attachment that
was sent to only 17 addresses at a global company. It appeared to be an
attempt to gain access to the company's network.

&quot;The motivation behind today's new e-mail-borne threats is far more sinister
than traditional large-scale attacks,&quot; Mark Sunner, chief technology officer
at MessageLabs, said.

Hackers are getting paid to create the malicious programs, which could then
be used in industrial espionage or to collect sensitive company data.

In late May, Israeli police made 18 arrests in a case of industrial
espionage using Trojan horses. The programs were designed to spy on computer
systems and had been planted on the computers of some of the country's top
companies.

Sneaky worms
The underground market means that programs that exploit security holes in
software are worth too much these days to waste on an attention-grabbing
worm. Such major outbreaks get detected soon, triggering mass patching by
users and investigations by law enforcement agencies.

Instead, hackers are more likely to create a slow, stealthy attack that will
get malicious software installed on many machines, said Steven Hofmeyr, the
chief scientist at Sana Security.

&quot;There is no real incentive to write those kinds of mass worms other than
the graffiti incentive,&quot; Hofmeyr said.

The lure of money likely is not solely responsible for the lull in large
worm outbreaks, experts said. After a string of worms in 2003 and Sasser
last year, many people realized the importance of security software and
patching their systems.

Also, Microsoft, whose software is often the target of worms, has been
HYPERLINK &quot;&quot;working to
improve its act. Windows XP Service Pack 2, a large security-focused update
for the desktop operating system, was released last year. On the server,
Windows Server 2003 is deemed more secure than its predecessors.

&quot;The world has become much more aware of malicious activity,&quot; Debby Fry
Wilson, a director at Microsoft's Security Response Center, said.

In the future, HYPERLINK
&quot;&quot;intrusion prevention
products could play a part in protecting systems against targeted security
threats. Some tools look at the behavior of software and block suspect
activity. Other products look more closely at the data leaving a corporate
network and can block the transmission of credit card data, for example.

Attacks have changed, not vanished. Security companies and Internet users
face increasing challenges to fight the sophisticated threats that often fly
under the radar. With money as a spur, hackers are motivated to keep
creating new attacks--and to keep one step ahead of the competition.

&quot;I call it the chess game, where the bad guys have the white pieces and
always get to go first,&quot; Gartner analyst John Pescatore said.
