WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted on
Friday to cut $700 million from the food stamp program, despite
objections from antihunger groups complaining that estimates show some
235,000 people would lose benefits.

The House bill, which also trimmed other social programs for the poor
in an effort to reduce federal spending by $50 billion, was narrowly
approved 217-215.

House and Senate negotiators now must write a final, compromise version
of legislation to pare federal spending over five years. The Senate did
not touch food stamps in its version of a $35 billion budget-cutting
bill.

Food stamps, the major U.S. antihunger program, help poor people buy
food. Some 25.8 million Americans received food stamps in a program run
by the U.S. Agriculture Department.

Senate Agriculture Committee chairman Saxby Chambliss said through a
spokesman that he was aiming for &quot;zero&quot; cuts in food stamps during
talks with the House. As a committee chairman, the Georgia Republican
would be a senior negotiator.

The final bill should abandon proposals to cut food stamps, urged Ellen
Vollinger of the Food Research and Action Center. &quot;In nutrition, the
Senate did the right thing,&quot; she said.

Bread for the World, another antihunger group, said the prospect of
food stamp cuts &quot;will make Thanksgiving bleaker for hundreds of
thousands of hard-working families.&quot; It pointed to government estimates
that 38.2 million Americans live in &quot;food insecure&quot; households that
have trouble buying enough food.

House Republican leaders say the cuts are only a sliver of food stamp
spending that runs more than $35 billion a year. Earlier this week,
House Majority Leader Roy Blunt said the cuts would focus the program
on &quot;the people you intended to help instead of just adding on at the
edges.&quot;

In a statement, the White House said it supported the House &quot;efforts to
narrow overly broad exemptions from the food stamp program's
eligibility limits.&quot; President (George W.) Bush proposed restrictions
in February that are similar to the House-approved steps.

Under the House plan, roughly 165,000 people now automatically enrolled
in food stamps when they get assistance from welfare programs would
lose food stamps. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said these
were mostly working families with children.

States would have the option to continue offering free school lunches
to families cut off of food stamps. The Center on Budget said it was
unlikely all states would do so.

The House proposal also would require 70,000 legal immigrants in most
cases to wait seven years to become eligible for food stamps, rather
than the current five years. That brings the total number of people
affected by the plan to 235,000.

WASHINGTON -- The Republican-controlled Congress helped itself to a
$3,100 pay raise on Friday, then postponed work on bills to curb
spending on social programs and cut taxes in favor of a two-week
vacation.

In the final hours of a tumultuous week in the Capitol, Democrats
erupted in fury when House GOP leaders maneuvered toward a
politically-charged vote _ and swift rejection _ of one war critic's
call for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. &quot;You guys are pathetic,
pathetic,&quot; Massachusetts Rep. Martin Meehan yelled across a noisy hall
at Republicans.

On another major issue, a renewal of the Patriot Act remained in limbo
as an unlikely coalition of liberal Democrats and conservative
Republicans sought curbs on the powers given law enforcement in the
troubled first days after the 2001 terrorist attacks.

Both the House and Senate were in session after midnight Thursday,
working on the tax and deficit-cutting bills at the heart of the GOP
agenda, before returning to work a few hours later.

&quot;What it does is start to turn down the escalating costs ... for our
children and our grandchildren. One of the things that we cannot leave
to that next generation is a huge deficit that they can't afford,&quot;
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said after enactment of a $50
billion deficit-reduction bill.

Democrats dissented, with one eye on the 2006 elections.

&quot;The Republicans are taking food out of the mouths of children to give
tax cuts to America's wealthiest. This is not a statement of America's
values,&quot; said the Democratic leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California.
&quot;Democrats believe that together, America can do better,&quot; she said,
invoking the party's new campaign slogan.

The cost-of-living increase for members of Congress _ which will put
pay for the rank and file at an estimated $165,200 a year _ marked a
brief truce in the pitched political battles that have flared in recent
weeks on the war and domestic issues.

So much so that the issue was not mentioned on the floor of either the
House or Senate as lawmakers worked on legislation whose passage will
assure bigger paychecks.

Lawmakers automatically receive a cost of living increase each year,
unless Congress votes to block it. By tradition, critics have tried to
block increases by attaching a provision to the legislation that
provides funding for the Treasury Department. One such attempt
succeeded in the Senate earlier in the year, but the provision was
omitted from the compromise measure moved toward final approval.

The overall bill provided $140 billion for transportation, housing and
other programs. It cleared the House on a vote of 392-31. Senate
passage was by voice vote.

Pay raise harmony aside, Republicans spent the day celebrating a
party-line, post-midnight vote in which the House cleared legislation
to reduce deficits by $50 billion over five years. The vote was
217-215, with all the Democrats who voted in opposition, along with 14
GOP rebels.

Acting Majority Leader Roy Blunt of Missouri said Republicans would
make their tax cut bill the top item on the agenda when lawmakers
return to the Capitol in December.

The House-passed measure attacks deficits by limiting spending for the
first time in a decade on Medicaid, food stamps, student loans and
other benefit programs that normally rise with inflation and
eligibility.

The House GOP leadership had hoped to clear the measure a week ago. It
was forced to retreat when Republican moderates rebelled, even after
Hastert agreed to strip out a controversial proposal to open the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.

The Senate-passed companion measure calls for less deficit reduction,
$35 billion over five years, but includes the ANWR provision.

The differences are expected to make it difficult for the House and
Senate to reach a compromise by year's end, particularly since
Republicans can't count on any Democratic support.

The tax bill presents difficulties of its own for a GOP majority
struggling to translate last fall's election gains into this year's
legislative achievements.

The Senate cleared a measure after 1:30 a.m. that calls for $60 billion
in cuts over five years.

The measure drew bipartisan support, passing on a vote of 64-33. Its
provisions would continue a series of existing tax breaks that
otherwise will expire, and shelters 14 million upper middle-income
families from higher taxes.

The White House has threatened a veto, citing a provision that raises
taxes on oil companies.

The House has yet to pass a companion measure. When it does, the tax on
oil companies is unlikely to be included, and it is likely to be
jettisoned before a compromise measure reaches the White House.

Hastert said Republicans want to &quot;make sure that we support our troops
that are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan ... a lot of people say:
Look, this is a tough time, we just ought to pull out and leave. We
pull out and leave, we strand an effort to make sure that we can tamp
down terrorism, to tamp down a dictatorship, that we can stabilize an
area in the Middle East,&quot; he added.

GOP aides conceded the last-minute maneuver was designed to put
Democrats in a political squeeze _ voting for withdrawal and exposing
themselves to attacks from the White House, or voting against it and
risk angering the voters that polls show want an end to the conflict.

Democrats angrily attacked the GOP move, then lined up with Republicans
to vote against a troop withdrawal in hopes of draining the issue of
its political significance. The vote was 403-3 against the measure.

Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., called the measure &quot;a piece of garbage&quot; and
an attack on Rep. John Murtha. The Pennsylvania Democrat, a decorated
veteran and respected congressional voice on military matters, said
Thursday it was time for the troops to come home.

House and Senate negotiators announced a tentative agreement earlier in
the week to pass a seven-year extension of the Patriot Act. Key
senators lawmakers involved in the talks balked at the terms, and
officials said they would resume compromise efforts when Congress
returns to work in December.

So, what does the &quot;right&quot; have to say for themselves?

&gt;&gt; first time in a decade on Medicaid, food stamps, student loans and
&gt;&gt; other benefit programs that normally rise with inflation and
&gt;&gt; eligibility.

&gt;&gt; The House GOP leadership had hoped to clear the measure a week ago. It
&gt;&gt; was forced to retreat when Republican moderates rebelled, even after
&gt;&gt; Hastert agreed to strip out a controversial proposal to open the Arctic
&gt;&gt; National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.

&gt;&gt; The Senate-passed companion measure calls for less deficit reduction,
&gt;&gt; $35 billion over five years, but includes the ANWR provision.

&gt;&gt; The differences are expected to make it difficult for the House and
&gt;&gt; Senate to reach a compromise by year's end, particularly since
&gt;&gt; Republicans can't count on any Democratic support.

&gt;&gt; The tax bill presents difficulties of its own for a GOP majority
&gt;&gt; struggling to translate last fall's election gains into this year's
&gt;&gt; legislative achievements.

&gt;&gt; The Senate cleared a measure after 1:30 a.m. that calls for $60 billion
&gt;&gt; in cuts over five years.

&gt;&gt; The measure drew bipartisan support, passing on a vote of 64-33. Its
&gt;&gt; provisions would continue a series of existing tax breaks that
&gt;&gt; otherwise will expire, and shelters 14 million upper middle-income
&gt;&gt; families from higher taxes.

&gt;&gt; The White House has threatened a veto, citing a provision that raises
&gt;&gt; taxes on oil companies.

&gt;&gt; The House has yet to pass a companion measure. When it does, the tax on
&gt;&gt; oil companies is unlikely to be included, and it is likely to be
&gt;&gt; jettisoned before a compromise measure reaches the White House.

&gt;&gt; Hastert said Republicans want to &quot;make sure that we support our troops
&gt;&gt; that are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan ... a lot of people say:
&gt;&gt; Look, this is a tough time, we just ought to pull out and leave. We
&gt;&gt; pull out and leave, we strand an effort to make sure that we can tamp
&gt;&gt; down terrorism, to tamp down a dictatorship, that we can stabilize an
&gt;&gt; area in the Middle East,&quot; he added.

&gt;&gt; GOP aides conceded the last-minute maneuver was designed to put
&gt;&gt; Democrats in a political squeeze _ voting for withdrawal and exposing
&gt;&gt; themselves to attacks from the White House, or voting against it and
&gt;&gt; risk angering the voters that polls show want an end to the conflict.

&gt;&gt; Democrats angrily attacked the GOP move, then lined up with Republicans
&gt;&gt; to vote against a troop withdrawal in hopes of draining the issue of
&gt;&gt; its political significance. The vote was 403-3 against the measure.

&gt;&gt; Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., called the measure &quot;a piece of garbage&quot; and
&gt;&gt; an attack on Rep. John Murtha. The Pennsylvania Democrat, a decorated
&gt;&gt; veteran and respected congressional voice on military matters, said
&gt;&gt; Thursday it was time for

Guys, in case you haven't noticed, they can't even GIVE food stamps
away! This country is so wealthy that virtually everyone can afford to
pay for his own food, without stealing money from his fellow taxpayer.
That's why the government actually had to have &quot;education&quot; and
&quot;recruitment&quot; programs to try to get people to apply for food stamps
when they originally had neither the intention nor the need for doing
so. They are just cutting the food stamp budget by the amount of
unused food stamps each year. Jesus, get a life and quit your
Bush-bashing! You're so boring. Or, better yet, get a job and see how
it feels to be a taxpayer!

That might work, put the sponges on a scale and weigh them, adjusting
the food stamp allotment accordingly.
These giveaway programs actually hurt the working poor, who make too
much to qualify for food stamps but not enough to live on. The taxes
they do pay, they can ill afford, to support their neighbors who won't
work.
Now, Bush is a lousy president, but not for most of the reasons
stated. If not for &quot;free&quot; trade policies that ship our jobs to China
and open and unrestricted immigration, which drives down the wages in
the jobs that are left, people wouldn't need food stamps, except for
those that won't work. But Clinton and the Dems did the same thing,
they are not immune to big business payoffs.
The article is right about the congressional payraise, but this is a
problem common to both parties throughout our history. Politicians,
despite their differences, will make sure they take care of each
other.-Jitney

above the prime rate. It would also be beneficial to set maximum credit
card debt at 10% of your gross income. If you have a $40,000 a year

need for (U.S.) &quot;food stamps.&quot; That is what &quot;means-

&gt; time gasoline reaches $8 a gallon, people will have developed

&gt; There is a move afoot to set the maximum credit card interest at 10%

"/> In an allegedly free country, there is a thing called
Personal Responsibility. If you aren't comfortable
borrowing money, then you are free to decline the
opportunity.

The government is NOT your personal baby-sitter to
prevent you from making bad decisions.

Also, the banks and other credit card issuers are well
aware of the risks of lending. That's their business.
So they will set rates and limits for the best overall
results. Meaning the best balance between profit
(customers who pay) and loss (customers who don't.)

&gt; Credit reporting agencies should set your limit annually and flag your
&gt; credit when you exceed it.

"/> Credit reporting agencies simply keep information about
your past behaviour. They do NOT set your credit
limits. And they can NOT force banks to stop lending
you money.

That decision is made by banks and other creditors.
Those parties can view your credit report, see your
overall debt level, compare it to your (claimed)
income, and set limits to how much they specifically
are willing to lend you.

Credit card issuers will periodically check your credit
report. And if they see you running up large debts
with other creditors, they may raise their own interest
rate, and/or lower the limit that they have granted
you.

These companies - reporting agencies and creditors -
can NOT force each other to stop lending you money.
And non of them are you personal baby-sitter. They
care about you making mistakes only on the large
(thousands of customers) scale, and only with regards
to their profit. They are businesses - NOT substitute
mommies.

A tax deduction on credit card interest would go a long way to help the
embattled middle class. Personally, I think interest rates should be
capped by law at 10%.

Like I said - none of this shit effects me personally. But it does
effect those family guys with kids that I work with.
It ain't all about me.

&gt; much as the excessive consumer.
&gt; There needs to be meaningful restraint and regulation.

"/> We need a law that limits the maximum credit card debt that one can have
in total and per card. The credit limit should really be a limit, not
just a trigger for over limit fees. If you have a credit card with
$5,000 owed with a $5,000 limit, that card should be rendered unusable
by the credit card issuer automatically, with no exceptions. The
interest rate should also be limited to no more than 10% over prime.

Credit card companies should not be able to solicit business from
individuals who they know full well cannot handle more credit card debt.
Credit card companies make a lot of their profits off those fees they
charge for over limit use and delayed payments, so they love to issue
cards to people who they suspect will pay their bills, but be late
sometimes and occasionally exceed their spending limit because that's
how these companies earn a lot of their profit.

Those who pay late have very little sympathy from me, but the grace
period also needs to be slightly more than a nanosecond! And credit card
companies also need to be required by law to fix their due dates to a
certain day of the month to be agreed upon by both parties and changed
only with prior notice.

As for credit limits, someone who earns $100,000 should never be allowed
to have a total spending limit more than say $20,000 or 20%. That
$20,000 should not include a mortgage, but it should be the total
across all cards, so this person could have three cards (X with a
$10,000 limit, Y and Z each with a $5,000 limit, or one card with a
$20,000 limit). This would also spur greater competition within the
credit card industry because they know they would have to compete for a
finite piece of each consumer's credit.

Anyone who is late paying a credit card bill, mortgage, or rent more
than two billing cycles should have that total limit reduced. This will
cause a lot of people some sort-term pain, but it will save them years
of credit card payments.

The same should be true of businesses, but with a higher limit.

This plan would make it much more difficult for anyone to get into debt
beyond their means. But since Congress is owned by the banks and the
Bible thumpers, you will never see anything like this type of policy
ever see the light of day.
