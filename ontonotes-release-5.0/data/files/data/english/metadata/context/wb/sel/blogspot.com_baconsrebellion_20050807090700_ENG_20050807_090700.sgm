Recently, some Virginia bloggers have been busy commenting on a
WashingtonBlade.com story about Chris Craddock, the Republican candidate
for the 67th Delegate District who recently defeated in last June's
primarry the former RINO incumbent, Gary Reese.

The WashingtonBlade.com story , entitled “Republican Candidate
Defends Anti-Gay Primary” quotes Craddock as saying “Christian and gays
despise each other.”

I’m not surprised that a publication like the Washington Blade would
go out of its way to libel and misquote a conservative candidate. After
all, they are on a mission: Promoting an extreme gay agenda, tearing
down family units, and the moral fiber on which this country was
founded.

What is surprising, however, is that professed serious Virginia
bloggers would give any credence to the propaganda coming from the
extremists at the WashingtonBlade.com.

Folks, here is Craddock’s entire quote, which the WashingtonBlade.com
utterly misquoted by taking it entirely out of context:

"Many people say that Christians and gays hate each other, but I
think we need to treat each other with respect."

Obviously, the WashingtonBlade.com is only interested in promoting
their agenda and will go to great lengths to distort a conservative
candidate’s record. Candidates shouldn’t waste their time talking to
so-called reporters from organizations like the WashingtonBlade.com who
are only interested in promoting their biased, extremist agenda.

The Washington Blade is the publication that supposedly "outed" Jay
Timmons, isn't it? Clearly, the publication has a radical gay-rights
agenda that, I would be willing to bet, even many Virginia gays are not
comfortable with.

The so called "agenda" of the Washington Blade isn't radical. The
idea that gays and lesbians deserve the same rights as everyone else is
not far out in left field. The basic concept that two people who love
each other should be able to share their lives, take care of each other,
and have the same rights as everyone else is in no way "radical" no
matter how many times conservatives scream that it is....

The Washington Blade is not radical. The Washington Blade is just a
bad newspaper with reporters and editors who don't know what they're
doing. They're idiots, not radicals.

As a gay Virginian, I'm very comfortable with the idea that I deserve
respect. I'm not all that comfy with the way the Blade tries to portray
that respect, but don't go around bashing their agenda as in any way
radical. Equal rights isn't all that crazy a concept...

"....organizations like the WashingtonBlade.com who are only
interested in promoting their biased, extremist agenda."

I believe that covers a lot of territory. Even if an organization's
agendai is NOT extremist, it is still dangerous if it is biased in the
extreme. Somehow we have to promote dialogs with differing viewpoints
without resorting to a total balkanization of ideas.

What is most disturbing is the total misrepresentation of fact, of
the sort noted here. Even more disturbing than that is a willingness to
not only spin out of all recognition the limited factual data we have,
but to fabricate data out of the whole cloth to support a previously
selected position.

We see this in polls where the answer depends on how the question is
asked, in think tanks designed from the ground up to support a position
while posing as scholarly groups, and in supposedly neutral reporting
which is designed to support one side of an argument only.

Combined with a national proclivity to winner-take-all competition in
every arena, it makes for potentialy unfortunate situations.

True enough, we have free speech which requires us to allow such
idiots to make mis-statements however antisocial, inflammatory, hateful,
hurtful, they may be. We don't have to listen to them, promote thier
agenda by responding, or buy their publications. All we can hope is that
a strong dose of benign neglect and rational truth will kepp the ball
rolling uphill rather than down.

I have to admit that I haven't been following this scandal, so maybe
I'm not up on things. (And I'm think I'm conflating it with the other
instances of Republican candidates saying ridiculous things about gays.
It's hard to keep up.)

That said, I'm puzzled. I read the original article in some
respectable Virginia newspaper (I can't remember which one), and that's
not at all what he was quoted as saying. Did the paper misquote him and
subsequently correct themselves? Or is this a case of he and the paper
disagreeing over what he said? Or something else entirely?

Anonymous 10:04, I must confess, I have never read the Washington
Blade, and base my comments on second-hand information. I should not
have written, "clearly, the publication has a radical gay-rights
agenda." I do not have enough information to make such a statement. You
are quite correct, the episode noted by Phil above may be an example of
bad very poor reporting, or bias on the part of an individual writer. It
would be interesting to see, however, if the paper issues a
clarification or retraction.

Waldo, if you click through Phil's link, I think you'll see that Phil
quoted the Blade quite accurately. The quote is highlighted in the
cutline under Craddock's photo.

Phil, Craddock supposedly made the "Christians hate gays" statement
in an interview with the Blade. How do you know that the quote is
inaccurate? You did not state your source. Has Craddock issued a
statement to that effect?

I agree with Anon 10:04: the Blade is just a bad newspaper; I don't
read it (because I read it enough in the past to identify it as a bad
newspaper and quit), so I don't know whether it has an agenda or not.

I am curious about Mr. Rodokanakis's response to the article here. He
presents ipse dixit the "entire quote" without establishing any
foundation. Why should I give Mr. Rodokanakis any more benefit of the
doubt that what he presents is more accurate than what the Blade
presented? This isn't an attack on Mr. Rodokanakis or his
credibility--just a suggestion that, in future, it may be worthwhile to
say something along the lines of, "I've spoken with Mr. Craddock, and he
says his quote really was . . ." or, "It has been revealed in other
periodicals of greater repute that Mr. Craddock's quote really was . .
." or, "The Blade today retracted, publishing the full quote, which was
. . ." (as the case may be). I know that Commonwealth Watch specifically
asked Mr. Craddock to set the record straight and apparently was
shunned. So the source of Mr. Rodokanakis's information is of some
interest.

Finally, on a purely grammatical note, I thought "gay" remained an
adjective. I wasn't aware that the word had been become a noun, so that
it could be pluralized. Completely irrespective of sexual orientation,
the word "gays" seems silly when referring to a group of people, much
the way "blacks" and "whites" do, when we have perfectly good nouns for
referring to those demographics.

I'm sorry I was unclear. I wasn't questioning Jim at all. I'm
questioning how Jim knows (as you did) that Craddock was quoted
incorrectly. I don't understand how I'm supposed to know that, or why I
would trust Craddock (about whom I know nothing) over the Washington
Blade (about which I know a moderate amount).

I'd been thinking that some media outlet other than the Blade broke
this story about Craddock. A quick Google News query shows, however,
that the Blade is the only media outlet to use this quote.

Jim et al: Sorry for not being clearer in my earlier post. The
Craddock quote comes from Chris Craddock himself. We corresponded with
him on this issue after the blade story broke out. As you can tell, his
quote was taken out of context. They simply dropped the last part of the
sentence where Craddock said that "we should treat each other with
respect" and only reported the first part making it sound that Craddock
said that "Christian and gays dispise each other."

Phil,

For clarification, they also dropped the first part of the quote
where he says "Many people say..." Thus making it sound like he was
expressing his own opinion about gay people and Christians rather than
his opinion of what "Many people" think.

This is a pretty serious charge. The Blade , in printing such a
quote, would have taken Craddock's comment and turned it on its head.
Has the paper printed a retraction? I don't see anything on Craddock's
website -- I wonder why he's not making a bigger deal out of such a
serious charge? I'd certainly like to hear the Blade 's side of all of
this.

No retraction yet. I'm not sure if the campaign has requested one or
not. They certainly have not made it public on their web-site. I suspect
that the main reason they haven't as yet is that the discussion has
pretty much been limited to blogs like this and the original Blade
article. Given the small readership of the Blade, I suspect the campaign
figures it best not to bring more attention to the misquote as this will
likely lead to even more smearing from the left. If it stays quiet in
the MSM you may not hear anything else from him on it.

The fact that the MSM has not picked it up so far leads me to believe
there is concern over the original article's voracity. After all, they
certainly jumped all over Brad Marrs when they had a clear link to a
quote of his. Is there any doubt the local MSM would plaster this all
over the news if they thought it was true?

Sorry, Anon 10:04, but any one who or group that demands that society
redefine a word and the institution it represents to satisfy their own
actions is "radical" by any reasonable definition of the word.

Or would you like to redefine "radical," too?

I think this recent study is relevant to the homophobia I see in the
Virginia elections:

Men overcompensate when their masculinity is threatened, Cornell
study shows

By Daniel Aloi

ITHACA, N.Y. -- Threaten a man's masculinity and he will assume more
macho attitudes, according to a study by a Cornell University
researcher.

"I found that if you made men more insecure about their masculinity,
they displayed more homophobic attitudes, tended to support the Iraq War
more and would be more willing to purchase an SUV over another type of
vehicle," said Robb Willer, a sociology doctoral candidate at Cornell.
Willer is presenting his findings Aug. 15 at the American Sociological
Association's 100th annual meeting in Philadelphia.

"Masculine overcompensation is the idea that men who are insecure
about their masculinity will behave in an extremely masculine way as
compensation. I wanted to test this idea and also explore whether
overcompensation could help explain some attitudes like support for war
and animosity to homosexuals," Willer said.

Willer administered a gender identity survey to a sample of male and
female Cornell undergraduates in the fall of 2004. Participants were
randomly assigned to receive feedback that their responses indicated
either a masculine or a feminine identity. While women's responses were
unchanged regardless of the feedback they received, men's reactions
"were strongly affected by this feedback," Willer said.

"Masculinity-threatened men also reported feeling more ashamed,
guilty, upset and hostile than did masculinity-confirmed men," states
Willer's report, "Overdoing Gender: Testing the Masculine
Overcompensation Thesis."

"The masculine overcompensation thesis has its roots in Freudian
psychology, but it has become a popularly accepted idea that I felt
should be empirically tested and evaluated," Willer said.

He questioned subjects about their political attitudes, including how
they felt about a same-sex marriage ban and their support for President
Bush's handling of the Iraq War.

"I created composites from subjects' answers to these and other
questions," he said. "I also gave subjects a car-buying vignette,
presented as part of a study of purchasing a new car."

Masculinity-threatened participants also showed more interest in
buying an SUV. "There were no increases for other types of cars," Willer
said.

The study produced "the predicted results," he said. "The intention
of the study was to explore whether masculine overcompensation exists
and where. But the point isn't to suggest these are the only factors
that can explain these behaviors. Likewise, there may be a wide variety
of other behaviors that could increase when men are concerned about
their levels of masculinity."

In a separate study, Willer verified that support for the Iraq War,
homophobia and interest in purchasing an SUV were all considered
masculine by study participants.

Willer said he and a colleague are planning additional research on
subjects' attitudes regarding violence toward women, using the same
method for manipulating masculine insecurity.

"I'm planning another follow-up to the study that involves taking
testosterone samples from participants to see if testosterone levels are
a mediating factor in this process," he added.

The research involved 111 Cornell undergraduates and was funded by
the Department of Sociology at Cornell.

Anon. 7:04, I really don't see what this study has to do with the
poor journalistic practices of reporters at the Blade, but I do find it
amusing. Unfortunately this study was probably funded with government
grants and my humorous attitude quickly turned to anger at that
realization. Oops, I guess I let my "threatened masculinity" show. I
better go get in my SUV and ride to the pro-War Rally. ;-)

I've seen no public statement from Craddock about this. He could be
disregarding this incident because he doesn't care to set the record
straight, or because setting the record straight would call into
question his false claim during the primary that the gay newspaper
actually endorsed Gary Reese.

What makes you so sure that Craddock was misquoted? Could be that he
was embarassed when he saw what he told the Blade in print and now wants
to avoid taking responsibility for saying something dumb. And why hasn't
he publicly disassociated himself from the comments attributed to him?
He may think there's no point in trying to get a correction from the
Blade, but why not post something on his web site clearly stating his
position? < $BlogBacklinkSnippet$>
