I'm not saying that Imus should have said what he said,  but it's
about time someone stood up to these race hustlers we call  Reverends,
Sharpton and Jackson and did the right thing.  The guy made a mistake
and apologized....  move on !

by Sarah McBride
Radio host Don Imus, fired by CBS Corp.'s CBS Radio in April amid
controversy, has made a deal to return to the airwaves with Citadel
Corp.'s WABC.
Mr. Imus will start Dec. 3. In addition, Mr. Imus will be syndicated
around the country through ABC Radio Networks.
The controversial radio star inked a deal with Citadel yesterday, a
person familiar with the situation said, although rumours he would be
moving to WABC have been circulating for months. Having a signed deal
will allow the station's sales staff to start peddling ads for the
show.
The upshot for Mr. Imus is that he will have a strong radio platform
going forward despite the uproar just six months ago, after he called
the Rutgers University women's basketball players &quot;nappy headed hos.&quot;
Many radio groups and smaller syndicators reached out to Mr. Imus
after his firing, but his most serious talks were with Citadel and
Buckley Broadcasting Corp., which owns highly-ranked WOR in New York
and has a syndication arm.

Personally, I hate talk radio and do not care in the least if Imus is on
or not.

That said, P Earl Harbor, I can not believe you do not see the
difference between the Stevie Wonder lyrics and a grown man calling
young college women whores for no reason whatsoever.

PLEASE tell me that was not your intent.

The good guys win!!!   So you have now come around to admitting the
Red Sox are deserved champions and the Yankees chumps.  And you admit
the Patriots are a great team who have earned every accolade they have
won they have achieved this season.  It's about time.

Oh wait.... wait.. wasn't it you who said:

Subject: Re: NEW YORK YANKEES TO BOSTON RED SOX CONVERSION FORM

Despite the 2 championships in 4 years.... the Red Sox have a history
of losing, choking, dissapointing their fans....  being the laughing
stock of the league,   while the Yankees have a history of winning,
coming through for their fans... and are the model baseball
franchise.
Maybe that will change in 100 years or so, but for now... enjoy your
7th championship.   It's amazing how Red Sox fans want to ignore
history and focus on today until they all of a sudden win twice in 4
years,  then they keep bringing up 2004

Ahh... right..... so.. let's agree to make ALL judgements according to
YOUR definitions and rules. That's fair.  So, according to your
rules... your history is... you are a 42 year old loser who has been a
reject, a pest, a troll, a fool, incompetent, unable to not just score
with a woman but can't even have a friendship with one, let alone a
decent conversation (save a girl under the age of three), are hated
and despised beyond belief by male and female alike, is a desperate,
scary truly self loathing repressed homosexual who constantly refers
to all women as whores (I would really love to see a photo of the
skank slut that birthed you) and has spent years fantasizing about
Bill Clinton's cock. You attach yourself to the NY Yankees with the
royal 'we' every time you mention them, as if they are the erect proud
dick you'll never have but always want to suck on (hmmm... Pattard
never uses the royal 'we' when talking about the Giants, or the Jets
or the Rangers or the Knicks.. and you never hear him talk about the
Nets).  Your history is that you were despised in school, the one who
was beaten up regularly in high school not cause you were a nerd, but
cause you were an obnoxious jerk who asked for it, encouraged it,
pleaded for it, cause to you, being beaten up by the boys was as close
as you would ever come to having sex. And now, you sell bricks for a
living. You have reached your intellectual peak, achieved the status
you always sought, climbed the highest peak of life you will ever
mount and proudly yell from the top of the garbage heap 'I AM PATRICK,
HEAR ME, I AM NOTHING!!&quot;

Oh wait..... Even the lowly Red Sox won, and not just once, but twice
in your pathetic lifetime.  You have never won anything. You are a
loser, a coward, a liar, a scumbag, a pest, a fraud, a weakling, not
even a footnote in history, you are a nothing.  No, wait, that is not
true. You are a laughing stock.  That is YOUR history and legacy.  So
let's all be fair and do as you say: Judge you as you judge others.
Let us not ignore history. You are the model of the scumbag, the joke,
the useless and the unimportant, the irrelevant and the textbook
definition of trash.

Ah yes...  The Good Guys Win.

You, fuckwad, will forever be a loser.  Thanks for helping to define
yourself clearly. I couldn't have done it any better alone.

I don't listen to rap, either.

But where are the hundreds and hundreds of posts defending that here and
on other groups like there have been for Imus?

And for the record, I didn't say someone should take out Tom Brady's
legs.... what I said was if someone did... the Patriots season would

Imus is a waste of valuable broadband space, who in your own words,
&quot;shouldn't have said what he said.&quot;

In what universe is this a win for &quot;good guys&quot;?

And I'd say the same thing if by some stretch of luck Howie Stern or
Dopey &amp; Acne were fired.

These so-called comedians are vile, cruel, mean-spirited, and
