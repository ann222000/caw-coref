I just got The Witcher uncensored version, and after finishing the
first (significant) quest where I make the potion and heal Triss, I'm
offered a roll in the hay which I gladly accept.  This showed a brief
background of silouettes kissing etc, but no nudity or anything that
could be considered remote inappropriate for a small child.

The most &quot;mature&quot; aspect of the game that I've seen so far was that
one of the more powerful enemies (the one with the blue glowing field
around him) called me a bitch a couple of times.

So my question is -- is this as mature as it gets?  Or have I simply
not yet gotten to the parts that warrented censoring the US version?

Before we get any unproductive comments, let me say I would have
bought the game anyway, but I did pay more for the uncensored version
-- not because I was looking for a porn experience but because I
wanted to see the game as the designers intended.  That said, seeing a
rather G-rated sex scene during the first encounter left me wondering
if I should have just gotten the censored version.

Maybe it's just they are trying to &quot;ease in&quot; to the really mature
aspects?

I'm open-minded, but I wouldn't put explicit sex (and yeah, despite
you don't &quot;see&quot; much, I'd call that pretty explicit) in the hands of a
small child. Now, I approve of sexual education, but education is one
thing, and a videogame not suited to small audience is another.

I also think &quot;adult&quot; does not mean _just_ extremely violent or porn.
The Witcher was in many ways written for adults, not for a very young
audience, and I wouldn't recommend it for them - not even censored.

&quot;Censorable&quot; content or not, it's quite hard for me to explain the
subtle difference that sets The Witcher apart from kid fantasy (like
Forgotten Realms)... the disillusioned look, the lowlives shown as
they should be, the lack of idealisation, in short it's a matter of
tiny details forming a feeling.

As a kid, I was looking for heroes in fantasy, not for the harsh
reality of The Witcher. This is quite different from Death Gate, Pern,
even Pratchett. I'm not sure I wouldn't have liked it, of course, but
I am sure I can enjoy this now in a way I couldn't have if I were
still a kid, and I'm thinking of me as a teenager, not even as a small
child.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;So my question is -- is this as mature as it gets?

No.
You will see and talk to whores in the streets, you'll meet a naked
dryad (yes, she's green, but she's naked), the lowlife thugs will
swear quite a bit (I'm playing in Italian, not sure of the exact words
said in English) and I'm just past Chapter Two.

I wholeheartedly disapprove of censoring, for whatever reason =)

The first thing you should know, is, that the only really complete
version is the polnish one. According to what some (polnish speaking)
people say, the english texts are much shorter and lack some information
(but that's probably just the translator's laziness, not censorship).

Anyway, the &quot;mature&quot; elements seem to aim more to boys &lt; 16 years old -
half-nude pictures and rude language is all what you get. Imho there's
nothing what you can't see on TV in the afternoon (ok, perhaps a little
bit more blood).

So, the answer is: Yes. This is as mature as it gets.

True. I haven't played the game, since my PC is too weak to run it, but
I have compared the Polish and English version of the dialogue between
Geralt and dwarven blacksmith from the official site. I assure you that
Polish dialogue is way more &quot;rough&quot; than the English one - e.g. someone
named Brog is not just a &quot;bastard&quot; in the Polish version; the name he is
called is rather more obscene, roughly corresponding to the English one
beginning with &quot;mother&quot;.

Thanks for all the replies.

At least I don't have to worry about whether I was sent the correct
version or not (I'd say mine is the UK version), which was my initial
concern.

And, after playing a bit more I did hear some of the thugs in the bar
say &quot;your mother sucks dwarf cock&quot; and such to each other.

I don't know if its the US as much as the global perception of the US,
because LOTS of games I've played have much more mature content than
this one.

GTA San Andreas -- even without the hot coffee mod makes this look
like a childrens book.  Hell any of the GTA games really.

The language in Call of Duty 4 is much worse.

Seems to me they went to the expense of publishing different versions
of the game for nothing.

This is actually a perfect example of what I mean (and reinforces my
point (and viewpoint)).

You have a game where you rob, murder and generally behave totally
amorally, and there is no problem with the game being on sale in the
US.  Someone comes out with a mod where you can have sex = outrage.
We must protect out kids, etc.

Cop Killing, prostitute hitting, drug dealing = all fine.
Sex = wrong, and the kids must be protected.

Now, I have no doubt the whole thing was blown up out of proportion,
and the one doing the blowing are the the people who always mouth off
about games they haven't played, but my point is, that when you're
just killing, robbing cars and drug dealing, these people are silent.
When the sex comes out, they find their voice.

As I recall, fairly early in GTA:SA, you go into a drug dealers house
where you can clearly see a crack ho giving some guy head on the couch
behind (this in the off-the-shelf game with no mods).  You don't see
the actual cock in mouth, but there's little left to the imagination
on what's &quot;going down&quot;.

So, is sex really the reason for multiple versions of The Witcher?

Honestly looking at Lara Croft's covered tits 10 years ago is more
suggestive than most of the sexual content in this game.

So far, about 3-4 hours into The Witcher, and I haven't seen anywhere
near as much sex as what I described above with the head-giving scene
in GTA:SA, so again I will simply fall back on my theory that it was
an unnecessary expense on the behalf of the game publisher's to
produce multiple versions of this game.  Money they could have put
into the sequel or the next title of their choosing.  This game has
extensive voice-acting work (actually EVERY interaction has both
subtitles and voice), and producing multiple versions is not cheap.
Furthermore, other's have said that not only the sexual content, but
the violence is censored in the US version.

At the end of the day, I suspect The Witcher won't sell as many copies
as GTA:SA did, all because some doofus decided to censor.

Well, then here's an idea - if you are the parent of a pre-teen child, then

Actually, you'd be surprised at what some people would consider 'adult'.

Some shows like Batman: the Animated Series, Justice League, Samurai Jack,
Daria and Downtown, despite having no bloody violence and no real cursing,
offer some powerful storytelling to the viewer.  Mistakes have
consequences, the 'bad guys' don't always get away - They're a welcome
change from the bullying that continues to happen in today's schools.

And, be honest, would you actually censor a series/episode that taught your

attacked and bound by a magically animated needle and thread.

And this was a childhood without pornography or any truly violent
programming. (at least in my area)  There was a lot of brain food available
during the 70s and 80s including *uncensored* war cartoons and some
cleverly written and well-drawn comic books which is more than I can say

&gt;&gt;-- not because I was looking for a porn experience but because I
&gt;&gt;wanted to see the game as the designers intended.  That said, seeing a
&gt;&gt;rather G-rated sex scene during the first encounter left me wondering
&gt;&gt;if I should have just gotten the censored version.

&gt; I wholeheartedly disapprove of censoring, for whatever reason =)

&gt; That said, I'm not sure of how much you would have missed (and if it's
&gt; not much, that's an even greater display of hypocrisy).
">

I'm sure that a few of us could come up with 'more explicit/offensive
examples' of (future) computer/console gaming but the long and the short of
it is that it's the prudish attitudes of certain pundits (if not the
various 'soccer moms') that are causing the most grief in the industry.

Educating them on the ESRB's rating system in a good start (that's still
being tried) but, after reading about what happened with San Andreas,
Oblivion, Fahrenheit and several other [M]-rated titles (plus the
ridiculous report about Mass Effect on Faux News) I'm left wondering if
shock therapy shouldn't be an option.

And, no doubt, someone will ask how long it will take before the rest of
the civilized world 'gets it'.

&gt;&gt; Nel tempo Thu, 07 Feb 2008 20:43:25 -0500, il mio fedele schiavo Wu
&gt;&gt; desto' nel mio animo interesse sopra il conversare di Excelsiator
&gt;&gt; &lt;nom ... @removedit.com&gt;:

&gt;&gt;&gt;I just got The Witcher uncensored version, and after finishing the
&gt;&gt;&gt;first (significant) quest where I make the potion and heal Triss, I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;offered a roll in the hay which I gladly accept.  This showed a brief
&gt;&gt;&gt;background of silouettes kissing etc, but no nudity or anything that
&gt;&gt;&gt;could be considered remote inappropriate for a small child.

&gt;&gt; I'm open-minded, but I wouldn't put explicit sex (and yeah, despite
&gt;&gt; you don't &quot;see&quot; much, I'd call that pretty explicit) in the hands of a
&gt;&gt; small child.

&gt; This is actually why there's a rating system in place in North America and
&gt; several other countries not to mention more than a few shops that will
&gt; *not* sell an [M] rated product to anyone under the age of 17.

&gt; This is something that a lot of (US) politicians (not to mention parents
&gt; and news anchors) refuse to acknowledge. 9_9

&gt;&gt; Now, I approve of sexual education, but education is one thing, and a
&gt;&gt; videogame not suited to small audience is another.

&gt; Well, then here's an idea - if you are the parent of a pre-teen child,
&gt; then
&gt; keep an eye on what that child purchases (or wishes to purchase) and make
&gt; sure that he/she knows what he/she is getting into.

&gt; It's called being responsible.

&gt; (And, believe me, there are worse ways to 'learn about sex' than so-called
&gt; 'evil video games') 9_9

&gt;&gt; I also think &quot;adult&quot; does not mean _just_ extremely violent or porn.
&gt;&gt; The Witcher was in many ways written for adults, not for a very young
&gt;&gt; audience, and I wouldn't recommend it for them - not even censored.

&gt; Actually, you'd be surprised at what some people would consider 'adult'.

&gt; Some shows like Batman: the Animated Series, Justice League, Samurai Jack,
&gt; Daria and Downtown, despite having no bloody violence and no real cursing,
&gt; offer some powerful storytelling to the viewer.  Mistakes have
&gt; consequences, the 'bad guys' don't always get away - They're a welcome
&gt; change from the bullying that continues to happen in today's schools.

&gt; And, be honest, would you actually censor a series/episode that taught
&gt; your
&gt; child why he/she should never even *touch* a gun? 7:^|

&gt;&gt; &quot;Censorable&quot; content or not, it's quite hard for me to explain the
&gt;&gt; subtle difference that sets The Witcher apart from kid fantasy (like
&gt;&gt; Forgotten Realms)... the disillusioned look, the lowlives shown as
&gt;&gt; they should be, the lack of idealisation, in short it's a matter of
&gt;&gt; tiny details forming a feeling.

&gt; Actually, Dungeons and Dragons has worked best with the high school and
&gt; college circuits, IINM.  Show me a (preteen) child that has enjoyed a
&gt; session of Dungeons and Dragons, Hackmaster, HeroQuest or even the board
&gt; game Dungeon and I'll eat an onion. (I hear it goes great with fried beef
&gt; liver) :^9
">

Get that onion ready (and none of that sweet Valdosta stuff).  I started
playing Dungeons and Dragons regularly when I was in 4th grade and had a
dedicated group at least a half dozen of my peers by 5th grade.  That's how
we'd spend our recesses and a good part of our after school time,
particularly after dark when we had moved our activites indoors for the day.
Within months of starting, we were branching out into Top Secret, Gamma
World, Traveller, Lord of the Rings, Champions, and later got pretty serious
into the Palladium games.  We did try out the Dungeon Board Game, but
actually felt it was too simplistic and childish even at that age.  I played
RPGs pretty regularly through high school (working for TSR to run a few
tournaments at Gen Con my Sophomore and Junior HS years), but then pretty
much lost interest as sports, girls and beer took precedent in college.  So,
given I was only maybe 10 or 11 when I and my group started, I was
definitely a preteen who enjoyed role-playing games.  Keep in mind, the best
RPGs on computer at the time were Wizardry, Autoduel, the early Ultimas, and
Tunnels of Doom for the TI99/4A.

&gt;&gt;&gt;GTA San Andreas -- even without the hot coffee mod makes this look
&gt;&gt;&gt;like a childrens book.  Hell any of the GTA games really.

&gt;&gt;This is actually a perfect example of what I mean (and reinforces my
&gt;&gt;point (and viewpoint)).

&gt;&gt;You have a game where you rob, murder and generally behave totally
&gt;&gt;amorally, and there is no problem with the game being on sale in the
&gt;&gt;US.  Someone comes out with a mod where you can have sex = outrage.
&gt;&gt;We must protect out kids, etc.

&gt;&gt;Cop Killing, prostitute hitting, drug dealing = all fine.
&gt;&gt;Sex = wrong, and the kids must be protected.

&gt;&gt;Now, I have no doubt the whole thing was blown up out of proportion,
&gt;&gt;and the one doing the blowing are the the people who always mouth off
&gt;&gt;about games they haven't played, but my point is, that when you're
&gt;&gt;just killing, robbing cars and drug dealing, these people are silent.
&gt;&gt;When the sex comes out, they find their voice.

&gt;As I recall, fairly early in GTA:SA, you go into a drug dealers house
&gt;where you can clearly see a crack ho giving some guy head on the couch
&gt;behind (this in the off-the-shelf game with no mods).  You don't see
&gt;the actual cock in mouth, but there's little left to the imagination
&gt;on what's &quot;going down&quot;.

&gt;So, is sex really the reason for multiple versions of The Witcher?

&gt;Honestly looking at Lara Croft's covered tits 10 years ago is more
&gt;suggestive than most of the sexual content in this game.

&gt;So far, about 3-4 hours into The Witcher, and I haven't seen anywhere
&gt;near as much sex as what I described above with the head-giving scene
&gt;in GTA:SA, so again I will simply fall back on my theory that it was
&gt;an unnecessary expense on the behalf of the game publisher's to
&gt;produce multiple versions of this game.  Money they could have put
&gt;into the sequel or the next title of their choosing.  This game has
&gt;extensive voice-acting work (actually EVERY interaction has both
&gt;subtitles and voice), and producing multiple versions is not cheap.
&gt;Furthermore, other's have said that not only the sexual content, but
&gt;the violence is censored in the US version.

&gt;At the end of the day, I suspect The Witcher won't sell as many copies
&gt;as GTA:SA did, all because some doofus decided to censor.

I suspect that Gogamer.com is making a pile of money as one of the few
outlets of the 'uncensored' version in the US.

Uh-huh.  I was never that secretive about it as far as computers were
concerned.  Even assuming your sarcasm, there were many &quot;popular&quot; people in
my school that played PC games, and weren't hiding it.  Hell, there was a
rampant pirate industry in Commodore 64 and Apple II games.

And now, anyone who doesn't video game in high school is the dork.  How
times change.

Hehe.. true, a nice salary is attractive to anyone..  There were quite
a few times I capitalized on the fact I have a nice job, nice house,
nice car etc to get pussy that was 17 or 18 years younger than me.
I've been with the same woman for a couple of years now (with the
exception of a couple of un-caught trists on my part :), and I will
say that a lot of good women are attracted to career computer geeks
not just because of their paycheck, but the fact that we tend to make
&quot;good men&quot; in their eyes overall.  Despite the fact that I seem to
have been born a poon-monger most of my life, most of the women I have
dated seem to appreciate the fact that although I enjoy a drink (or
two or twelve or more), I have avoided drugs and gambling all my life,
keep myself it good shape, and above all I act responsibly.  Women see
people in the computer industry as &quot;stable&quot; partners, and from what I
can tell we are, relative to many other professions.  I watch these
shows like Forensic Files, New Detectives and other investigative
shows on TV where they eventually reveal the details behind the killer
(who are usually not serial killers but just someone who spun out
emotionally).  When they reveal the perpetrator you see everything
from handymen, landscapers, mechanics, gardeners, various forms of
salesmen,  sometimes even doctors and nurses, but you almost never see
some guy who writes software for a living.  I think women have picked
up on that over the years and figure they can get fucked safely by us,
and they are that much happier when they realize they can get fucked
quite thoroughly :)

When I look for a long-term partner, I do look for a certain level of
stability, and if they've been able to maintain a (good and stable)
career for a length of time, it does lead me to believe I can fuck
them without ill consequence.  With women, that feeling is magnified
about ten times.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;concerned.  Even assuming your sarcasm, there were many &quot;popular&quot; people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;my school that played PC games, and weren't hiding it.  Hell, there was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rampant pirate industry in Commodore 64 and Apple II games.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually nothing I said was sarcastic or false, although I wouldn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; have actually hit anyone for &quot;giving up my secret&quot; (assuming their
&gt;&gt;&gt; motives were harmless), and I guess there is a little bit of
&gt;&gt;&gt; exaggeration to say it would have ruined my social life...  But it
&gt;&gt;&gt; would have almost surely had a negative impact on an image I worked
&gt;&gt;&gt; very hard to develop.. That sounds very cheesy in retrospect but the
&gt;&gt;&gt; 80's were in fact a cheesy era and image mattered quite a bit at the
&gt;&gt;&gt; highschool I went to.

&gt;&gt;It was never much of a secret in my group.  Although I wasn't from a
&gt;&gt;really
&gt;&gt;small town, it was pretty well known who was into D&amp;D (and this was the
&gt;&gt;'80s
&gt;&gt;to ealry '90s).  Hell, one of the guys in my group, who is till one of my
&gt;&gt;best friends, was one of the most successful guys in my school as far as
&gt;&gt;scoring with the ladies.  I think the girls were aware of what we did and
&gt;&gt;since we didn't pretend to be ashamed of it so much, pretty much accepted
&gt;&gt;it.  We were into other things and certainly wouldn't call off a date for
&gt;&gt;&quot;D&amp;D night&quot;, so it was never much of an issue.  That said, there were
&gt;&gt;almost
&gt;&gt;a few tiers of D&amp;D players.  I can guarantee you that most of the guys in
&gt;&gt;my
&gt;&gt;circle wouldn't associate with the &quot;pure&quot; players that did it as a way of
&gt;&gt;life.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I knew of people who had computers and played games back then, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; none that were in my particular clique of friends, and again because
&gt;&gt;&gt; my ability to get laid and to maintain the kind of respect that avoids
&gt;&gt;&gt; leading to people wanting to pick fights with you, I had to be careful
&gt;&gt;&gt; who I hung with.  All of this sounds horribly shallow in retrospect,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but it was just a reality of that particular phase of my life.

&gt;&gt;Oh yeah, we were all shallow as hell back then.  But it was survival.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A couple of years after high school I got one or two friends
&gt;&gt;&gt; interested in them, because by that time very good game computers like
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Atari ST and Amiga were coming out at very affordable price
&gt;&gt;&gt; ranges, offering much better games than existing consoles or PC-clone
&gt;&gt;&gt; titles.  One of those guys still plays online games with me today even
&gt;&gt;&gt; though we live a few hundred miles apart :)

&gt;&gt;I was always pretty open about my computer gaming.  But most women
&gt;&gt;considered that kind of smart, especially back when you had to get it
&gt;&gt;working through DOS.  I used to fix some girls comps, but always when I
&gt;&gt;showed up with liquior, to make it a social visit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And now, anyone who doesn't video game in high school is the dork.  How
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;times change.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Indeed.  I was glad to see geek become chic...

&gt;&gt;To some extent.  I kind of liked when I had the hybrid down as cool.  But
&gt;&gt;what the hell, I collect comics, play computer and video games, and thanks
&gt;&gt;to a decent paycheck and the fact I'm not obese, I can still get laid.

&gt;&gt; I was married for a
&gt;&gt;&gt; while, then split up, and when I was single again and got back into
&gt;&gt;&gt; the &quot;bachelor&quot; life (i.e. hitting the clubs), I was pleasantly
&gt;&gt;&gt; surprised to find the landscape had changed quite a bit, and that when
&gt;&gt;&gt; I met women in clubs and told them I work as a software engineer, it
&gt;&gt;&gt; was something that actually attracted them rather than repelled them,
&gt;&gt;&gt; as I'm pretty sure it would have done the latter in the 80's.

&gt;&gt;Over 25 or so, it's all about the paycheck.  At least if they'll go on a
&gt;&gt;second date.  And that's fact.

&gt; Hehe.. true, a nice salary is attractive to anyone..  There were quite
&gt; a few times I capitalized on the fact I have a nice job, nice house,
&gt; nice car etc to get pussy that was 17 or 18 years younger than me.
&gt; I've been with the same woman for a couple of years now (with the
&gt; exception of a couple of un-caught trists on my part :), and I will
&gt; say that a lot of good women are attracted to career computer geeks
&gt; not just because of their paycheck, but the fact that we tend to make
&gt; &quot;good men&quot; in their eyes overall.  Despite the fact that I seem to
&gt; have been born a poon-monger most of my life, most of the women I have
&gt; dated seem to appreciate the fact that although I enjoy a drink (or
&gt; two or twelve or more), I have avoided drugs and gambling all my life,
&gt; keep myself it good shape, and above all I act responsibly.  Women see
&gt; people in the computer industry as &quot;stable&quot; partners, and from what I
&gt; can tell we are, relative to many other professions.  I watch these
&gt; shows like Forensic Files, New Detectives and other investigative
&gt; shows on TV where they eventually reveal the details behind the killer
&gt; (who are usually not serial killers but just someone who spun out
&gt; emotionally).  When they reveal the perpetrator you see everything
&gt; from handymen, landscapers, mechanics, gardeners, various forms of
&gt; salesmen,  sometimes even doctors and nurses, but you almost never see
&gt; some guy who writes software for a living.  I think women have picked
&gt; up on that over the years and figure they can get fucked safely by us,
&gt; and they are that much happier when they realize they can get fucked
&gt; quite thoroughly :)

&gt; When I look for a long-term partner, I do look for a certain level of
&gt; stability, and if they've been able to maintain a (good and stable)
&gt; career for a length of time, it does lead me to believe I can fuck
&gt; them without ill consequence.  With women, that feeling is magnified
&gt; about ten times.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;GTA San Andreas -- even without the hot coffee mod makes this look
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;like a childrens book.  Hell any of the GTA games really.

&gt;&gt;&gt;This is actually a perfect example of what I mean (and reinforces my
&gt;&gt;&gt;point (and viewpoint)).

&gt;&gt;&gt;You have a game where you rob, murder and generally behave totally
&gt;&gt;&gt;amorally, and there is no problem with the game being on sale in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;US.  Someone comes out with a mod where you can have sex = outrage.
&gt;&gt;&gt;We must protect out kids, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Cop Killing, prostitute hitting, drug dealing = all fine.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Sex = wrong, and the kids must be protected.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Now, I have no doubt the whole thing was blown up out of proportion,
&gt;&gt;&gt;and the one doing the blowing are the the people who always mouth off
&gt;&gt;&gt;about games they haven't played, but my point is, that when you're
&gt;&gt;&gt;just killing, robbing cars and drug dealing, these people are silent.
&gt;&gt;&gt;When the sex comes out, they find their voice.

&gt;&gt;As I recall, fairly early in GTA:SA, you go into a drug dealers house
&gt;&gt;where you can clearly see a crack ho giving some guy head on the couch
&gt;&gt;behind (this in the off-the-shelf game with no mods).  You don't see
&gt;&gt;the actual cock in mouth, but there's little left to the imagination
&gt;&gt;on what's &quot;going down&quot;.

&gt;&gt;So, is sex really the reason for multiple versions of The Witcher?

&gt;&gt;Honestly looking at Lara Croft's covered tits 10 years ago is more
&gt;&gt;suggestive than most of the sexual content in this game.

&gt;&gt;So far, about 3-4 hours into The Witcher, and I haven't seen anywhere
&gt;&gt;near as much sex as what I described above with the head-giving scene
&gt;&gt;in GTA:SA, so again I will simply fall back on my theory that it was
&gt;&gt;an unnecessary expense on the behalf of the game publisher's to
&gt;&gt;produce multiple versions of this game.  Money they could have put
&gt;&gt;into the sequel or the next title of their choosing.  This game has
&gt;&gt;extensive voice-acting work (actually EVERY interaction has both
&gt;&gt;subtitles and voice), and producing multiple versions is not cheap.
&gt;&gt;Furthermore, other's have said that not only the sexual content, but
&gt;&gt;the violence is censored in the US version.

&gt;&gt;At the end of the day, I suspect The Witcher won't sell as many copies
&gt;&gt;as GTA:SA did, all because some doofus decided to censor.

&gt; I suspect that Gogamer.com is making a pile of money as one of the few
&gt; outlets of the 'uncensored' version in the US.
">

That's the version I got from them.  They had the censored version on sale a
few weeks back, but so far the UK version is still at $50.  I get mot of my
games through them, imports and domestic.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually, Dungeons and Dragons has worked best with the high school
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;college circuits, IINM.  Show me a (preteen) child that has enjoyed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;session of Dungeons and Dragons, Hackmaster, HeroQuest or even the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;board
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;game Dungeon and I'll eat an onion. (I hear it goes great with fried
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;beef
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;liver) :^9

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sure there must have been preteens playing D&amp;D.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course they probably also had pocket protectors and tape holding
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their glasses together.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hey now, although I did get good grades (well, most of my years), I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;letter winning athlete and dated cheerleaders.  And most of the guys
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;group were in the same social class.  Of course, the nerd stigma is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the things that got me to gravitate away from RPGs as high school went
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;on.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That, and other interests.  Personally, I used to resent those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;dipshits
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;populated Gen Con dressed up as their favorite LOTR character and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;smelling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;like they shared medieval bathing habits with their fictional heroes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Gave
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;us normal people a bad name.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn't make good grades in highschool, but did letter in 2 sports
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and banged several cheerleaders.  I wasn't really there for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grades, I was there for the poon, the parties, the beer.  It was not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; until I was out of high school that a few very close friends were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; allowed into the room that contained my computers, and even then I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tried to make it look like I was only into playing games on them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (didn't tell them I was already fluently programming in four languages
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for freelance work).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Back then being a computer geek could have really ruined my social
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; life if I was careless about how the word got out.  Once I let a few
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; friends into the &quot;inner circle&quot;, I made them swear not to talk about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my computer-shit to others (lest I beat their arses) :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Uh-huh.  I was never that secretive about it as far as computers were

&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually, Dungeons and Dragons has worked best with the high school and
&gt;&gt;&gt;college circuits, IINM.  Show me a (preteen) child that has enjoyed a
&gt;&gt;&gt;session of Dungeons and Dragons, Hackmaster, HeroQuest or even the board
&gt;&gt;&gt;game Dungeon and I'll eat an onion. (I hear it goes great with fried beef
&gt;&gt;&gt;liver) :^9

&gt;&gt; I'm sure there must have been preteens playing D&amp;D.
&gt;&gt; Of course they probably also had pocket protectors and tape holding
&gt;&gt; their glasses together.

&gt;Hey now, although I did get good grades (well, most of my years), I was a
&gt;letter winning athlete and dated cheerleaders.  And most of the guys in my
&gt;group were in the same social class.  Of course, the nerd stigma is one of
&gt;the things that got me to gravitate away from RPGs as high school went on.

Surely none of these listed things were done by you or friends as a
preteen though.

&gt;&gt;I've been with the same woman for a couple of years now (with the

&gt;&gt;say that a lot of good women are attracted to career computer geeks
&gt;&gt;not just because of their paycheck, but the fact that we tend to make
&gt;&gt;&quot;good men&quot; in their eyes overall.  Despite the fact that I seem to

&gt;&gt;dated seem to appreciate the fact that although I enjoy a drink (or
&gt;&gt;two or twelve or more), I have avoided drugs and gambling all my life,
&gt;&gt;keep myself it good shape, and above all I act responsibly.  Women see
&gt;&gt;people in the computer industry as &quot;stable&quot; partners, and from what I
&gt;&gt;can tell we are, relative to many other professions.  I watch these
&gt;&gt;shows like Forensic Files, New Detectives and other investigative
&gt;&gt;shows on TV where they eventually reveal the details behind the killer
&gt;&gt;(who are usually not serial killers but just someone who spun out
&gt;&gt;emotionally).  When they reveal the perpetrator you see everything
&gt;&gt;from handymen, landscapers, mechanics, gardeners, various forms of
&gt;&gt;salesmen,  sometimes even doctors and nurses, but you almost never see
&gt;&gt;some guy who writes software for a living.  I think women have picked
&gt;&gt;up on that over the years and figure they can get fucked safely by us,
&gt;&gt;and they are that much happier when they realize they can get fucked
&gt;&gt;quite thoroughly :)

&gt;&gt;When I look for a long-term partner, I do look for a certain level of
&gt;&gt;stability, and if they've been able to maintain a (good and stable)
&gt;&gt;career for a length of time, it does lead me to believe I can fuck
&gt;&gt;them without ill consequence.  With women, that feeling is magnified
&gt;&gt;about ten times.
