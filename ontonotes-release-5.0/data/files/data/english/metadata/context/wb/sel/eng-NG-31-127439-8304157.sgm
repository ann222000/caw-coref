On Monday 16th July, IEA: ‘reut-sadaqa’ group met at the Swedish Theological Institute for their monthly meeting. Despite that it is vacation time, we were happy to see a good number of members present as well as new ones. We congratulate the Jewish coordinator Leah Lublin who the day before became a grandmother and Rafiqa Othman, the Moslem Coordinator, who recently has anew post in the Municipality of Jerusalem.

The topic for this meeting was ‘Vows and Promises’ in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. Here we bring just some points of these presentations.
Jeremi Gishron presented the Jewish perspective. He entitled his input: “With or without a promise”. He pointed out the importance of this subject in Judaism that the Talmud deals with it in four of its tractates. It stretches from the dedication of the person to serve G-d for a certain time “Nazir’ to the holy curse of the infidel wife who dared to swear falsely. The Patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob swore important oaths. Abraham swore an oath about PEACE in Beer Sheva with king Abimelech. Isaac swore an oath about WELLBEING and Jacob, who later was given the name ISRAEL made his oath only after he left Beersheva on his way to Haran. Here the language ‘neder’ is used with the same meaning as ‘nazir’ (a Jewish ascetic) and with Nadir – the sun when it stands in Zenit, at the top of the sky. He made a vow (oath) about the future of the Israeli nation.

During the centuries, the Jewish people multiplied their practice of making vows but the rabbis discouraged this practice on the grounds that Deut. 23:22-24 states “What goes out of your mouth you shall do”. This was already a promise and any additional words were unnecessary. So the custom of adding to one’s words ‘bli neder’ when one promises something, meant ‘My words are truth and are going to be kept’ even without making a vow. The solemn liturgical service opening the feast of ‘Yom Kippur’ (Day of Atonement) asks for forgiveness of all sacred promises and holy oaths that a Jew make have taken during the preceding year.

Fadwa Kirrish presented the Moslem perspective. Vows or Nider is a pre-Islamic tradition in the history of human history. With the coming of Islam this tradition was modified and regulated. Moslems who find themselves in difficulty make a vow to God in return for having their need granted. The first vow recorded is that of Um Abbas, the Prophet’s aunt who vowed that if her son who had lost his way in one of his trips returned home safely she would cover the Ka’bah with silk. Haj Abdul Qader Najjar explains that in Islam a vow is a virtuous offering to God. The one who offers a vow should be an adult, the vow should be possible to fulfill. If a Moslem made a vow and he could not fulfill it, he should make a ‘kaffarah’ (reparation). Such ‘kaffarah’ could be the emancipation of a slave or feed 10 poor people and buy them clothes. If a Moslem cannot make a ‘kaffarah’ he should fast for three consecutive days and so the vow no longer binds him. In Islam, it is usually women who make vows in cases such as that of asking for a child, or having a baby boy or for a spinster to get married. There are a variety of ways how to accomplish vows.

Karmela Farrugia presented the Christian perspective of this subject. In many circumstances, the Christian is called to make promises to God. In the sacrament of Baptism and confirmation, Matrimony and Holy Orders always entail promises. Out of personal devotion, the Christian may promise to God this action, that prayer, this alms-giving, that pilgrimage, and so forth. Fidelity to promises made to God is a sign of the respect owed to the divine majesty and of love for a faithful God. ‘ A vow is a deliberate and free promise made to God concerning a possible and better good which must be fulfilled by reason of the virtue of religion’.  A vow is an act of devotion in which the Christian dedicates himself to God or promises Him some good work. By fulfilling his vows he renders to God what has been promised and consecrated to Him. The Acts of the Apostles shows us Paul concerned to fulfill the vows he had made. The Church recognizes an exemplary value in the vows to practice the evangelical counsels: men and women who pursue Jesus’ self-emptying more closely and show it more clearly by undertaking poverty with the freedom of children of God, and renouncing their own will; they submit themselves to man/woman for the sake of God, thus going beyond what is of precept in the matter of perfection, so as to conform themselves with the obedient Christ.

The Church can and in certain cases and for proportionate reasons, dispense from vows and promises.

After the inputs, the participants divided in small groups and each one participated in lively discussions.

Later we had a time of socializing together prepared by Rafiqa.

The group reconvened to plan our next meeting. Since in September there will be the Jewish High Holidays and the Fast of Ramadan, we will not have our regular meeting. The meeting of August 20th will be dedicated to an evaluation and planning our future meetings. Rafiqa facilitated this meeting.

Report prepared by the Coordinators of the group: Karmela Farrugia, Leah Lublin and Rafiqa Othman.
