Prompt #001: Dreams.
Words: 480.

A WAR OF SORTS.

She got lost in a war one night.

Not that she had ever been to a real war, she'd seen pictures, but she supposed
that there probably hadn't been a playpen in the middle of the barracks, with
two very young squalling toddlers in it. The missiles and bombs, all the mud
caked into her skin, the dampness of three day old clothes sticking to her and
all the dead bodies that surround her felt right, though.

&quot;Gorram it, Kaylee!&quot; Mal yelled at her from behind a carefully constructed wall
of cards. &quot;Can't you control those boys? We're fighting a battle here.&quot;

&quot;It's about time someone told her, Sir.&quot; She saw Zoe lean around the cards and
point two fingers off into the distance. &quot;Bang. Bang.&quot;

&quot;Good shot, Zoe!&quot; Kaylee frowned as Mal grinned. &quot;Those damn women won't get
close to us now!&quot;

She looked off into the distance. High on a hill, amid explosions and gunfire,
sat a table with a white cloth and a tall vase filled with blue roses. Seated
at either side, heads tall and backs straight, were Inara and River, pouring
tea into delicate china cups. They didn't seem at all concerned with the chaos
around them.

&quot;Like gnats.&quot; River whispered and Kaylee heard it, even over the distance.
&quot;Buzzing. Buzzing.&quot;

&quot;I do wish they'd stop soon, it's very irritating.&quot; Inara placed her tea cup
gently on its plate and lifted a platter of glistening fruit slices. &quot;They
could join us so easily.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; River preened as she delicately picked up a grape between her
thumb and forefinger. &quot;This one is sour.&quot;

&quot;Bang! Bang!&quot; Kaylee looked back to see Mal aiming his fingers over the hill,
his face turned and his eyes looked straight at her. &quot;I mean it, mei mei, no
one's gonna win this battle if'n you don't sort them out.&quot;

Kaylee shrugged and walked to the small wooden structure in the middle of the
mud.

&quot;He pushed me!&quot; Pouted a small child. &quot;He pushed me!&quot;

Indeed, even as she watched, the other little boy placed his hand on a vested
shoulder and shoved him into the mud.

&quot;Now, Jayne,&quot; she scolded, &quot;why would you want to do a thing like that?&quot;

&quot;Damn fool don't even know.&quot; The boy snarled, small white teeth poking through
a rosebud mouth. &quot;Supposed to be smart like he is an' he don't even know.&quot;

&quot;Know what?&quot;

They both looked at her with wide, innocent eyes when she asked.

&quot;Kaylee?&quot; She frowned and turned into the voice. &quot;Kaylee? You're dreaming
again.&quot;

She got lost in a war of sorts most nights, but that was okay, because she woke
to warm arms surrounding her and Simon's soft fingers brushing hair behind her
ear. If only she was allowed to find the answer to that question that came to
haunt her.

&quot;S'okay.&quot; She mumbled, half dazed. &quot;I'm all shiny.&quot;

Prompt #002: Nightmares.
Words: 574

FINGERLESS GLOVES.

Jayne often heard her scream at night.

He guessed it'd started way back when that bounty hunter had tied her up and
he'd slept through the whole thing. Sure, she'd looked at him like he was as
crazy as River when he'd told her he was sorry for it, but Jayne knew better.
It cut him when she was skittish sometimes. It only got worse after Miranda,
all of 'em surrounded by flesh hungry Reavers and those darts landing smack in
her neck, face all slack with shock.

He knew he shoulda done better by her, better than what he'd done.

Knew it, 'cause he heard her screams when he slept, saw her pressed into the
ground as she struggled, fists red as they clenched hard in her panic. Eyes
wide and wild, just about bursting with fear. Saw parts of her flesh torn up
an' off her as her head thrashed back and forth until there weren't no sounds
left in her throat but whimpers.

Jayne woke up shivering those nights, he couldn't help it, woke up and swore in
ways his momma woulda slapped him for. Those were the nights his shakin' hand
would reach for his flask, his ever dwindlin' flask, and hope that he could
forget.

'Cause there weren't no man alive who'd wanna remember those images, the sight
of her eyes lookin' at him like that, all horror and pain and fear, beggin' and
pleadin' with him to stop it.

Those were the nights, in his dreams, that Jayne were the one leanin' down to
sink teeth into her cheek and hold her down, buckin' with her thrashes. The
nights when he'd wake up with his teeth sliding through the inside of his cheek
and his nails pressed so hard into his palms that his hands would be slick with
blood. He'd never be able to stop the thundering in his chest until he saw her,
during the day, all bright and shiny and happy and he wearin' his fingerless
gloves all day so's no one would see the marks.

Didn't no one need to know, so's he made sure, always made sure, that Kaylee
didn't ever need to worry 'bout no danger. 'Cause maybe he hadn't saved her
then, but he'd make damn sure she'd never need to be saved again. Ain't no one
gonna make her cry, Jayne knew it, knew it 'cause he watched her out of the
corners of his eye, made sure she was happy, stayed happy with the doc.

It was an arrangement that suited him just fine if'n nothing happened to her.

Only, every now and again, he'd see River tryin' not to look at him, saw her
running her fingertips over her own palms and wincing. Girl had to know, Jayne
knew it, but she didn't ever say nothin' 'bout it.

&quot;Not your fault.&quot; 'Ceptin' once when they was alone one day. &quot;Don't need to
dream it again.&quot;

And Jayne tried not to hear the plea in her voice, didn't even want to think on
what it was doin' to her.

&quot;Don't wanna do it, little one.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; Damn, that girl knew how to break a man's heart with her big, brown
eyes, even as she agreed with him. &quot;No one blames you, but you flagellate
anyway, punish yourself for what you'd never do.&quot;

He couldn't do nothin' but sigh.

&quot;Let it go, girl.&quot;

&quot;Wish I could, wish you would.&quot;

Prompt #003: Daydreams.
Words: 711.

HONEYSUCKLE.

&quot;And this one?&quot;

Kaylee took her eyes off the open doors of Serenity, the crew preparing for
whatever tasks they had to do on this planet, to watch River slowly trail her
fingers along a dusty, bare wooden plank in the fence.

&quot;Honeysuckle.&quot; The girl said, eyes dreamy. &quot;Small, sweet flowers, all white and
pink and bursting. The smell so strong you have to stop.&quot;

River's garden was taking structure in Kaylee's mind, full of all sorts of
wonderful plants and animals. She closed her eyes and let the barren world they
were on float away.

&quot;Genus Caprifoliacea.&quot; River continued. &quot;Represents the present, not the past,
commonly used in traditional medicines to help those who cannot let go of their
history, those who dwell.&quot;

&quot;Wow. I can almost hear the birds chirping.&quot; Kaylee sighed. &quot;It's real pretty.
I wish I could see what you see.&quot;

She regretted her words, even as they came out of her mouth. The soft
dreaminess of River's expression sharpened and she frowned. Kaylee followed her
gaze to see Jayne standing by the mule, checking the guns in his holsters. Her
brows furrowed even further and she didn't know why.

&quot;No you don't.&quot; It was gone as suddenly as it came and Kaylee watched River
smile again. &quot;Your dreams are pretty, too. Tell me the one, from when you were
young.&quot;

On the tip of her tongue sat the one about the handsome stranger who'd come and
rescue her, take her away from the growing leash that became her planet, the
suffocating sameness of it all, but that dream had come later. Had come when
she'd grown too old to accept the same tired excuses, too old to look at the
bare plates and lean bodies and not know the life that stretched out ahead of
her if she didn't get out. Old enough to know better, but still young enough to
believe her body could get her what she wanted.

River wanted the one from earlier, when she'd been young enough to laugh at her
father's jokes about not having work, to believe that the sky and the grass and
the shine of her mother's eyes was all she'd ever really need to be happy.

&quot;You already know it, little miss mind reader.&quot;

&quot;Tell me anyway.&quot;

&quot;A home.&quot; Two words that sparked the dreamy look back on River's face and
Kaylee let herself fall back into it. &quot;Just like the one I grew up in, with a
big table in a room that smells like smoke from the fire and bread from the
kitchen. It'd always be noisy, 'cause everyone would visit, family, friends,
neighbors, everyone and the door'd never close.&quot;

God, she could smell the butter and bacon grits and it ate at her somethin'
fierce.

&quot;I'd make the bread with real flour, you know, and my husband'd chop wood on a
block out the back. He'd have a special name for me, sweetheart, or baby, or
somethin'. Special, just 'tween us. We'd have two kids. A boy who'd learn to
ride horses and follow his pa around and a daughter who'd be daddy's little
girl. And they'd all be there at night and I'd be pulled into a big hug by the
man who called us his two special girls and kiss us both, while the boy made
faces.&quot;

&quot;Do they have names?&quot; River's mouth was dry with the longing she felt in
Kaylee.

&quot;No, you know they don't.&quot; Kaylee shook out of her reverie. &quot;Can't name
children without talkin' to their pa and do you see any pa around here? No
home, neither, when it comes to that.&quot;

She scuffed her shoe in the dust and felt a hand on her waist.

&quot;Have a good time, you two.&quot; Simon placed a small, polite kiss on her cheek.
&quot;Be careful, okay? Promise me?&quot;

She spun around.

&quot;You're not coming? But we were gonna...&quot;

&quot;I... I should stay.&quot; He stuttered and failed to notice the disappointment on
her face. &quot;I only seem to get into trouble in these towns, anyway, you know
that, Kaylee.&quot;

She bit her lip.

&quot;You ever wanted to call me anything else?&quot;

&quot;Than what?&quot; He looked confused. &quot;Kaylee's your name, isn't it?&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Don't matter none, just wondering.&quot;

EVERYTHING BEFORE THE BUT...

It seemed like the whole ship hid.

Kaylee felt the primary thrusters disengage, her ears automatically picking up
the rumbling of her engines turning down as they set course. She almost felt a
slight sense of betrayal. Even her girl was staying away. Mal and Zoe, she
knew, were in the bridge and were not about to come out any time soon. River
had fled to Inara's shuttle, she tended to do that on occasion when the
temperatures rose on ship. And Jayne, well, she figured Jayne had just gone to
his bunk.

&quot;I don't understand, Kaylee.&quot;

A little half laugh choked out of her throat.

&quot;Oh, no, of course you don't.&quot;

Simon looked at her, stunned.

&quot;What is that supposed to mean?&quot;

&quot;Oh my god, Simon, you're the genius, what do you think it means?&quot;

She was being deliberately unhelpful and she knew it, but she couldn't bring
the words out, couldn't say what was really the matter. Mostly because she
didn't really know herself. Not even River could make sense of her head just
then, she'd only be lost in the tumult of it.

&quot;Does...&quot; He paused and she turned to look at him, a lost lonely figure in the
middle of his infirmary. &quot;Does this have to do with the name thing?&quot;

&quot;Ai ya, Simon, nah mei guan-shee!&quot;

&quot;Then what, Kaylee?&quot; He stepped closer and she looked down, didn't want to meet
his eyes. &quot;You come in here and accuse me of... of... what did you call
it?&quot;

&quot;Having the emotional range of a strung out tadpole?&quot;

&quot;No, not that one.&quot;

&quot;Less chemistry than a soggy twig in rainy season?&quot;

&quot;Um, yes, let's stop there, shall we?&quot; He sighed. &quot;I don't know what you want
from me.&quot;

He sounded so sad. She supposed she did, too.

&quot;I want it all.&quot; And all was more and different and nothing she knew. &quot;And you
don't give it.&quot;

&quot;I give you everything I can, Kaylee.&quot; He reached out and cupped her chin,
lifted it so that she had to meet his eyes. &quot;You know I care for you deeply,
but I still have to focus on River right now, she's not well, the Alliance are
still looking for us, it's not over.&quot;

&quot;It'll never be over.&quot; She whispered.

He leaned in to kiss her, softly, his lips barely touching hers and Kaylee had
to close her eyes to stop a tear falling through. From somewhere deep down and
far away, she could hear the deep burly sound of her father's voice. Everything
before the but is bullshit.

And Kaylee had learned that lesson first hand. You're a very pretty girl,
but... You're great with machines and I'd love to hire you, but... I'd love to
take you with me, babe, but...

She shouldered out of his embrace and ran out of the infirmary.

INSIDE OUT.

He knew she was behind him, could feel it in the air.

&quot;You gonna stand there all night, are ya?&quot;

She sniffled and he looked up sharply, his eyes taking in the way her hands
shook as she tried to clasp them together so he wouldn't see, saw the sheen of
her eyes which told him she was close to crying.

Damn doctor, an' you were doing so well.

Turning back to the guns on the table, he pursed his lips and began to whistle.
As if he couldn't care less. As if he weren't just about crawlin' out of his
skin to have her sit down with him. She was jittery like a colt, curious and
wantin' company, but unsure of it nonetheless.

She did sit down, right next to him. And he didn't look up, didn't give her any
sign that he'd even noticed and soon enough he fell back into the pattern of
oiling and cleaning where he didn't even need to think on it.

&quot;Do you name them all?&quot;

Quick flick of his eyes up to see that she was watching his hands.

&quot;'Course I do, can't not name 'em.&quot; He eyed the small pistol in his hand,
turned it over so the casing gleamed in the half light. &quot;That'd be rude.&quot;

&quot;Rude?&quot; She reached out and her fingers trailed over the butt of a larger semi
automatic. &quot;What's rude about it?&quot;

He gestured at the arsenal.

&quot;Well, these here are my special ladies. They look after me, so's only right I
treat 'em nice and proper. Each one of 'em is different, see?&quot;

Reaching out, he took her hand and curved it around the small pistol.

&quot;This here? She's gettin' a little gray around the gills, see, but she's still
good if'n you squeeze her trigger the right way.&quot;

Her fingers curled around the metal and he saw her breathe in deeply. She'd
stopped shaking.

&quot;Which one's your favorite?&quot;

He snorted.

&quot;That ain't no secret.&quot; And he lifted his largest gun from the table. &quot;You've
met Vera, I treat all my guns with the respect they deserve, but Vera, well,
she's my baby girl.&quot;

&quot;Baby girl, huh?&quot;

There was something in her voice, a catch that made him think she was gonna
start crying again. Vera was placed carefully back in her spot and he felt the
absence of her weight with the quick flash of loss that he always did.

&quot;You wanna tell me what's...?&quot;

But he never got to finish that sentence, because the minute he'd let go of
Vera, Kaylee'd grabbed his head and kissed him. Hard. Her mouth was all sorts
of fire and need and he moaned into her breath. Her fingernails pressed hard
into the sides of his face and he wanted them to dig deeper.

It took everything he had to bring his hands up and push her shoulders, to
break away from her.

&quot;It ain't right, Kaylee.&quot; And he couldn't look her in the eyes, because he
didn't think he could stop himself if he saw in her what she had to see in him.
&quot;It ain't right.&quot;

&quot;Like you ever cared about what was right?&quot; She was angry and he didn't even
need to look to know that the tears had started to fall. &quot;Since when don't you
just take what you want?&quot;

&quot;Maybe I don't care about what's right, Kaylee.&quot; He kept his voice steady and
tried not to show how much she'd just hurt him. &quot;Maybe I want it, maybe I've
wanted it since before that gou tsao de doctor ever boarded this boat. And
maybe I want it so bad right now I can't even tell you.&quot;

It was then that he looked in her eyes.

&quot;But you do care, Kaylee, and it'll just eat you up. Eat you from the inside
out if'n you do this.&quot; He stood up and left her with his guns. &quot;And I care
about that.&quot;

SALT.

She avoided him the next day. It was probably a good thing, he wasn't sure what
he would do when he saw her next. Only thing was, she kept avoiding him and a
day stretched out into a week.

Jayne didn't think there were that many excuses on such a small ship to keep
out of another person's way, but there were. She made herself all manner of
busy, fixing engines, cooking meals, tagging after River and Simon, hell, she'd
even gone with Mal planet side once.

Mealtimes were worse. She wouldn't look at him and she wouldn't ever pass him
food, even if he asked nice. And loud. It had gotten to the point that others
had noticed and he didn't have to wait long before someone asked.

Mal, of course it was Mal, found him in the cargo bay, throwing horse shoes and
steadfastly ignoring the all too loud laughter that came from the common room
just outside the infirmary. River, Simon and the third voice that held a
slightly edgy, desperate note to it, as if Kaylee was eager for everyone to
believe she was fine.

&quot;You gonna tell me what's wrong?&quot;

&quot;You wanna know?&quot; Jayne was already tense and he just knew he wasn't going to
take the hardness in Mal's voice too well. &quot;You better ask her.&quot;

&quot;I'm askin' you.&quot; There was a pause. &quot;What did you do, Jayne?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, me.&quot; He gave a soft, bitter little laugh and tossed another horse shoe.
&quot;I didn't do nothin'. That's what ye all think, though, ain't it? Something
happened, it had to be Jayne.&quot;

His hands grasped in thin air and he sighed as he walked to the peg to pick up
the shoes. He'd gotten all but one, the last one.

&quot;I ain't nothin' but a ruthless merc to you people, am I? Huh? I'll do anything
for a bit of coin, sleep with anyone and not even flinch, hell, you all
probably think I'd kick a puppy and laugh about it.&quot;

He saw Mal look at him, long and hard, his eyes sharp.

&quot;No.&quot; It was spoken calmly. &quot;No one thinks that, Jayne. Maybe we joke around a
bit, hell, a lot, but we think more of you than that.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Jayne was fairly sure he didn't sound very agreeable as he walked away.
&quot;That's about as clear as mud.&quot;

He waited, he waited until there was a time he knew she'd be alone. There
weren't no place on the ship a person could be alone, really, 'cepting the
bunks and Kaylee when she was in her engine room. And he certainly wasn't gonna
go into her bunk.

&quot;Cap'n?&quot; Her voice came from around the machines. &quot;I'm nearly finished, I just
have to... Oh.&quot;

Her face flushed red.

&quot;Yeah. It's me. Sorry to disappoint.&quot;

She turned back to the machine, chin set, and didn't say anything else.

&quot;Look, Kaylee, I just wanted to say...&quot; He waited until she stepped out again,
until he could look her in the face. &quot;I ain't gonna say sorry. If that's what
yer waitin' for. I didn't do nothing wrong.&quot;

Silence. He sighed and turned to leave.

&quot;I know.&quot; Her voice was tiny. &quot;It's not you. I wanted to apologize, really I
did, but I'm not ready, I couldn't...&quot;

Jayne felt a million stares, all the different glares he'd been getting all
week from everyone on board.

&quot;But ye damn well should.&quot; He turned to see her eyes widen and her mouth part
open in surprise. &quot;You knew, didn't you?&quot;

&quot;I... don't...&quot; Her eyes flickered to the left and back again, her hands
twisted into the cloth she was holding.

&quot;Don't play games, Kaylee. You knew, before I said it, you knew I... cared.&quot; He
didn't need to wait for an answer, not when he saw her bite her top lip,
capturing it with her lower teeth and holding it there. &quot;You damn well knew it
and you used me.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; She stopped fiddling and stopped avoiding him. &quot;I didn't...&quot;

&quot;You were fightin' with the doc and you wanted to pay him back. And you thought
you'd come and get even with him by playing with me. Did I miss anything?&quot;

&quot;Jayne.&quot; It was almost a plea, her small voice. &quot;That's not...&quot;

He stepped toward her.

&quot;I think it's the meanest thing you've ever done, Kaylee. That, maybe, and then
tellin' me to my face that I wouldn't give a hoot about doin' it. You honestly
think I'd just use you like that? That I could do it and not blink?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; She shook her head and her lip trembled. &quot;I just thought...&quot;

&quot;You thought what, huh?&quot; He stepped forward again and he was so close that she
had to take a step back. &quot;You thought you'd come to me and what, Kaylee?&quot;

&quot;Jayne, please.&quot; Her back hit the far wall and he pressed in further. &quot;Stop it.&quot;

&quot;Ain't this what you wanted?&quot; He bought his mouth in close to her face. &quot;It's
what everyone thinks happened. Ain't it? I figure, hell, maybe I should just do
it and get it over with. Then maybe we can all just go back to normal.&quot;

Her neck was so soft when he grabbed it.

&quot;Might as well have my fun before Mal eventually kicks me off the ship.&quot;

Her cheek tasted like salt.

EVEN AFTER.

She managed to bring her hand in between their bodies and grabbed his nipple,
twisting it until he yelped.

&quot;Get off me!&quot;

She pushed him hard and they broke apart, standing still and staring at each
other as they caught their breaths. Kaylee couldn't remember either of them
doing anything particularly energetic, but they both seemed to be struggling.

&quot;I'll go.&quot; He said finally and she saw something in his eyes she didn't think
she'd ever seen in him before. &quot;Kaylee? I... I didn't...&quot;

Whatever he'd been about to say got stuck in his throat and she watched him
wrestle with it.

&quot;Don't you dare walk out of here.&quot; She spat the words and they seemed to slap
him across the face. &quot;I have words to say and you're gonna listen to me.&quot;

Her skin ached and she wondered if there'd be a bruise, wondered if Simon would
notice and what he'd say if there was. She couldn't imagine a more awkward
conversation than trying to explain what'd just happened. Well, maybe this one.

&quot;I shouldn't have kissed you, Jayne, I shouldn't have done it.&quot; When he opened
his mouth to argue she held up her hand. &quot;Yes, I kinda had an inkling, more'n
one, that you liked me. I figured you'd go for it, I didn't know you... cared,
an' that's the truth.&quot;

A breath.

&quot;It don't excuse it, you're right, it was mean. I didn't think, I just...&quot; What
could she say? &quot;... you were talkin' about how special those guns were and I
kept thinkin' how I weren't special to no one and I wanted that.&quot;

&quot;S'at all?&quot; He looked as if he wanted to say more, but she knew he wouldn't,
knew he was already thinking of ways to punish himself.

&quot;You don't need to come in here and tell me how awful I am, Jayne, 'cause I've
been telling myself that all week, how awful and how horrid and how you'd be
right if you just hated me after this.&quot;

&quot;I don't hate you, Kaylee.&quot;

She felt the tears again.

&quot;I do, I kinda hate me.&quot; And when he reached out, she tried to push him away
but he wouldn't let her. &quot;I wanted to say sorry, I did, I wanted to come tell
you how bad I felt, but I couldn't, see.&quot;

Oh, he was so gentle now and she felt herself give into it, felt herself warm
against his chest.

&quot;And every time I saw you I kept thinkin' on that kiss and how much I wanted
it, how much I wanted more. That just made it worse. And you don't help, with
your lips and your muscles and the way you fill up a room and now you're
holding me and I know it's wrong, Jayne, but I don't want you to stop.&quot;

&quot;Even after?&quot; His fingers raked through her hair and she sniffled.

&quot;Even after.&quot;

She lifted her head and kissed him again, felt him tighten against her as her
fingers closed tight against his shoulders. He pulled his head back.

&quot;Oh, Kaylee.&quot; And her heart melted, 'cause she knew what he was going to say
and she didn't want him to say it, even if it only made her want him more. &quot;We
can't go down this road. Not now.&quot; She stepped back and nodded and he let her
go as she chewed the nail on her thumb, shifting uncomfortably from one foot to
the other. They were back to silence and trying to breathe.

&quot;Gorram, Kaylee.&quot; His hand rose to his chest. &quot;You twisted my nipple!&quot;

The air cleared and she let herself raise her eyebrows.

&quot;You're just lucky I didn't kick you in the balls.&quot;

TIRED

They stayed in the engine room. He sat with his back to the wall and his arms
resting on his knees, his wrists dangled in mid air. Across from him, with her
back against the engine casing and her head leaning back so she looked up at
the ceiling, Kaylee sighed.

&quot;He said he loves me, I know he does.&quot; She couldn't have seen the look on his
face, the snarl he gave, but she must have known. &quot;Don't Jayne. You were there,
that day, you heard what he said.&quot;

Yeah, he'd heard.

&quot;He actually say that? He ever look you right in the eye and say 'Kaylee, I
love you'.?&quot; He wasn't at all surprised when she shook her head. &quot;'Cause I
heard him say he regretted not ever bein' with you. And that's all I
heard.&quot;

That must be the most interesting ceiling in the entire 'Verse, way she kept
starin' at it.

&quot;He thought, hell, we all thought we was gonna die in that room. You know what
it means when a dying man promises you sex?&quot; He watched the slow, lazy roll of
her neck as she finally looked at him. &quot;It just means he ain't dead yet.&quot;

She was so drained she didn't even have the energy to scold him and he could
see that she wanted to.

&quot;Why now?&quot; Was what she settled for, a tired sigh of a question. &quot;Why are you
sayin' all this now?&quot;

&quot;'Cause maybe I'm tired of watchin' you throw yourself at someone who ain't
never bothered to notice you other than to make you feel bad about yourself.
Maybe I'm tired of bein' alone at night. And maybe, just maybe, I never once
thought you wanted me back and now I know you do, I don't plan to sit back all
quiet like and not fight for ya.&quot;

He watched her cheeks flush and saw a shiver run through her.

&quot;God, you're a dangerous man, Jayne Cobb.&quot; And then she was back to the
ceiling. &quot;I don't wanna hurt him. I can't do it.&quot;

He shrugged.

&quot;I'll do it.&quot;

At least it bought a laugh to her shoulders and a curve to what he could see of
her lips.

&quot;He does care.&quot; She insisted. &quot;And he needs me. He doesn't ever complain, but I
know how much he hurts over River an' what she goes through. He needs someone
to lean on.&quot;

&quot;That ain't love, Kaylee.&quot;

&quot;You don't see him. You don't see him when there ain't no one else around,
Jayne, he's a different man. He's all...&quot; She paused and he was grateful that
she didn't go into any detail. &quot;... well, he's different is all.&quot;

If she was gonna be stubborn, then he could match her in the bull headed
stakes. Easy.

&quot;It ain't love.&quot;

PATCHWORK.

He'd gone to get them coffee and she accepted her mug with relish. She hadn't
eaten much that night, in fact she hadn't eaten much in days. A week, if she
was going to be honest about it. And she found her tummy was grumbling.

&quot;You gonna tell him?&quot;

Kaylee paused. She thought about it, she really did.

&quot;No.&quot;

Jayne's mouth tightened in the corners.

&quot;So you're just gonna go back to him and pretend nothing happened?&quot; She didn't
answer him. &quot;And I'm supposed to what? Crawl away with my tail 'tween my legs?
Skulk in the shadows?&quot;

&quot;This isn't what I wanted.&quot; She whispered it into her mug. &quot;I didn't want none
of it.&quot;

&quot;But you've got it, Kaylee. And you can't just wish it away. It ain't some bad
dream.&quot;

&quot;Yes it is.&quot; She scrunched her eyes tight and clasped her mug tighter. &quot;God, I
hate this, you don't know how much I hate it.&quot;

He was watching her, she could feel it on her skin.

&quot;You poor thing.&quot; His voice was fair on dripping with sarcasm. &quot;It must be so
hard on you, finding out you have cravings and havin' to carry 'em for a whole
week. You wanna times that by a few months and maybe throw in a rival and
everyone else sayin' how cute ya are together and makin' fun of... oh, jus'
forget it.&quot;

She was about to say something when he cut her off.

&quot;I said forget it, Kaylee, I don't want no damn pity.&quot;

There was a laugh, all bitter and choked off suddenly and Kaylee was surprised
to realize it had come from her.

&quot;I had a really good thing, Jayne, you know it? For once there was someone who
wanted me, who looked at me like I was something they could love, I felt good.
And then you come along and piss all over it.&quot;

&quot;Don't look at me, babygirl, you started this whole thing.&quot;

&quot;It was good. We were good.&quot; She didn't even react to him. &quot;Everything was
fine. And now it's not. You had to come and poke holes in the very thing that
made me happy.&quot;

He gave a grin, but it didn't reach his eyes, a last ditch effort if she ever
saw one.

&quot;By my count, I ain't got to poke nothin' yet.&quot;

&quot;I had something good.&quot; She said it again, hoped he could see. &quot;And now it's a
bunch of holes trying to look like something good. I need to see if I can patch
it up.&quot;

He sighed again. Deep and heavy and she knew he got it.

&quot;You can't patch nothin' up with lies.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; She flinched when he slammed his mug down on the floor. &quot;I think I
have to tell him.&quot;

Prompt #010: Anger.
Words: 560.

DOG.

Maybe there were tensions in the air, maybe Mal felt guilty for what he'd said,
Jayne didn't know, but he knew that Simon and River had been taken planet side
with Mal and Zoe, that Inara was off with her client and he was left to arrange
cargo with Kaylee.

Just the two of them.

&quot;You tell 'im, yet?&quot;

&quot;Um...&quot; She hesitated. &quot;No.&quot;

She stood at the edge of the crate and waited for him to take the other end.
Jayne brushed his hand over her fingers and he watched her eyes fall to where
their hands sat. He moved away before she could say anything and they carried
the box over to one of the hidey holes, crouching down to push it in.

When Kaylee stood up, he didn't give her any room and she found herself trapped
between him and the wall. He couldn't help but run a hand down the side of her
face, let it fall to her shoulder.

&quot;Don't you think you should?&quot;

&quot;I will, I will.&quot; She wasn't moving away. &quot;I'm just waiting for the right
moment.&quot;

That made him chuckle.

&quot;You think there's a right moment for that? Let me tell you, Kaylee, there
ain't no right moment to tell a man about another man.&quot;

&quot;Jayne?&quot; Her voice was breathy as he trailed his finger across her collar bone.
&quot;Come on, stop it.&quot;

He grinned.

&quot;You really want me to?&quot;
