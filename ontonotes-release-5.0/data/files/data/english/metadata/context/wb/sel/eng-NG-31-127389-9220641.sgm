&quot;What do you need to do to get through a recession? I am 33 years old.
I have never had this oncoming experience as an adult, taxpaying
citizen. &quot;
- Brandy, Weston, Fla.

First off, Brandy, take a deep breath. Now hold it in. Hold it. OK,
now let go. Repeat until calm. It's important to try to stay calm -
because fear is our worst enemy in an economic downturn. When
consumers stop spending and businesses stop hiring and start laying
pepole off, that can make the situation much worse.

Second: It's not clear yet that we're headed for a recession - though
economists who make a living watching out for one will admit that you
sometimes don't know you're in a recession until after it's started.

Third: You're not crazy to be a little nervous. The housing market,
especially once-booming states like yours, is already in a &quot;slump&quot;
that by most measures would have to be called a recession. And housing
has led the U.S. economy into most of the recessions in the past 50
years. On the other hand, the unemployment and inflation rates - the
sum of which came to be known as the &quot;misery index&quot; in the darkest
days of the Stagflatin' 70s - remain historically low.

There is no textbook definition of a recession, though many people say
it constitutes two back-to-back quarters of &quot;negative growth&quot; - when
the Gross Domestic Product goes down instead of its usual upward path.
While that's often the case, the official arbiter of U.S. recessions
for the past 50 years has been a group called the National Bureau of
Economic Research in Boston. They say they use &quot;a broader array of
indicators than just real GDP&quot; because those data often get heavily
revised to revision. They also look at other monthly data, since the
GDP is only calculated quarterly.

Even if you could see a recession coming on the horizon like a bad
storm, it's not necessarily going to hit everyone the same way. Most
people just get really wet when a thunderstorm hits. A few get hit by
the occasional tornado or lightning strike. Some storms are gone hours
after they begin; others linger for days.

The same is true in a recession. Right now, housing-related businesses
- builders, mortgage brokers and lenders, real estate agents and
furniture stores - are suffering. But other parts of the economy are
doing just fine. Carmakers are laying people off. But healthcare
companies are hiring.

And while the government statistics we all follow so breathlessly
measure changes in &quot;the U.S. economy,&quot; that national outlook masks a
great deal of variation in local conditions. The government data
crunchers have recently acknowledged this regional disparity in
economic growth by publishing state by state GDP data.

Last year, for example, the state of Michigan saw its portion of the
GDP slide by half a percent. For many people there, a recession is
underway. On the other hand, the fastest growing state - Idaho -
posted a 7.4 percent jump in GDP. So even if the &quot;national&quot; economy
slips into recession, your town may dodge the bullet.

What you need is a bank account with moola in it. Then divide the amount
in the bank by the sum of your rent, food, etc. That will tell you how
long you can live without a job.

You are in a recession when, for no good reason at all, you become
unemployed. The recession for you is worse when you spend a long time and
get no job offers or worse, no job interviews.

When everyone starts talking about a recession, then they start cutting
back their own descretionary spending, thus feeding even more into the
recessionary mass psychology, which makes it worse even sooner.

As people get laid off, their health coverage can only continue with COBRA
unless they have a special union contract. Without health coverage, you
won't get health benefits when you go to the doc's office, and that means
traffic at the doc's office will taper off, therefore the docs will be
laying off people, too.

At least Brandy was _thinking_ about the possibility that there might be
difficulties getting through. There was that example that rick++ gave of
the kids that just walk away from jobs if they don't like them (Mommy
takes them back in?). There will be a very rude awakening one day. Over my
life I have heard many stories of major giant spoiled-brats. The best cure
is a cruel but serious, hard, swift kick in the ass. Then sometimes people
look in the mirror and realize they were big jerks. And, life needs a
serious outlook. Even animals need this: I saw a remarkable film sequence
of a mother bear trying to teach its cub how to fish at the river and the
cub was not paying attention. Finally the mother bear gave the cub a swift
bop with her paw and the cub suddenly became serious. Right there in the
film. Birds have it practical: baby bird needs to leave the
nest....attempts to fly and flops on the ground. Trial-and-error learning.
Most baby birds learn, sooner or later, to fly. Ahhhhh... nobody told them
about predators? Hmmmmm....sounds like real life to me.

Prior to the last recession, Nortel laid of 60,000 of their 90,000
employees.  those people FELT the recession. Not only did they lose
their jobs, but available jobs in their field were nonexistent.
Although most people were aware of the recession, most did not &quot;feel&quot;
the recession.  If you look at figure #1 in http://www.nber.org/cycles/november2001 ,
you will see that employment didn't really go down much in the
recession.

HOWEVER, recession or no recession, YOUR job loss is significant for
YOU.  The question is not how do you plan for a recession, the
question is how do you plan for job loss.  Even if there is the
unlikely scenario of there being no recession in your lifetime, you
WILL lose your job at least once.

Issue #1, save one of every four paychecks.  Put the max contribution
in a ROTH IRA.  Put the rest in a portfolio with a low cost investment
company, such as Fidelity or Vanguard.  Don't worry about stock market
crashes.  Even if you had invested your money the day BEFORE the 1987
crash, it would still be up 400% today.

Issue #2:  After you have gotten used to saving 25%, then cut your
spending even more and save 2 paychecks out of very 4.  This is a lot
easier to start right after college when you are used to living on
virtually nothing.  As you get older &amp; get accustomed to spending, it
gets harder.  START NOW.

Saving 50% will do two things. It will get you used to living on less
and it will get you saving for your retirement. SO, when you do
retire, you will need less.

Issue #3: Divorce your health care from your employer.  Bargain with
your employer.  It costs money for him to insure you.  Tell him you
want a higher salary instead of health insurance.  Get a high
deductible insurance while you are young an KEEP IT. Get a Health
Savings Account (HSA).  Continue adding to your HSA THEN increase your
deductible even more.  Calculate the difference between what you pay
for insurance and what your employer would have had to pay.  Put that
amount in a separate stock fund so you can see your health savings
first hand.

By doing this, you will not have to worry about health care between
jobs.  You will also be preparing yourself for health insurance during
your retirement.

Before you know it, your fears of recession will have disappeared and
you will be retired at an early age.

Theoretically, &quot;Reagan and beyond&quot; personal responsibility was
planning for this, But I dont think all the pieces are in place,
not may ever be.  401Ks were supposed to make pensions
portable.  COBRA, etc. was supposed to make health insurance
more portable, but the insurance companies easily subverted this.
In the &quot;good old days&quot; either government welfare or a &quot;job for life&quot;
corporate socialism was the saftey net.  This came to head during
1990s restructurings when jobs disappeared like that. But new ones
(with lesser benefits) were created pretty fast.  We havent had a high
employment period for a while, though that could happen.

All the pieces are in place except one; human nature.  For example,
What percentage of YOUR paycheck do you put away?

Rather than plan for our future, it is more important for us to have
cell phones, the latest game box, cable TV, HDTV, cars for our kids,
and on, and on, and on...

You give away 15% of your income for social SECURITY and the
government will guarantee that you will live in poverty.  There is an
answer.   The problem is that most people don't want to listen and
implement the answer. When it comes to retirement, they are then
sitting by the mail box on the 1st and 15th waiting for their
government check

The answer is in another post of mine in this same topic.

Actually, it would have been more important to do some research and
planning concerning food production in a world without a lot of oil.  But
when the taxes are slashed so as to get elected and all the wealth is
spent on imperialism so the Republican prancing pigs can stay in office

Actually mine comes on the second Wednesday of each month.  It isn't very
much, but since I own my home, and I get a pretty good break on the taxes
for being an old coot, and I get VA health care for my service in the
US Navy, then I don't need a lot to keep the wolf away from the door.  I
didn't buy any stocks or bonds but I sure as hell did pay a lot of FICA
taxes.  Now it is my turn and I will SURVIVE.  If I had made investments
and the like then I would have a much better retirement by most standards.
But I am OK with what I have and with what I did to __EARN__ it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If your answer has something to do with anything other the social
obligation of one generation to the next then it is worthless.  I do not
have a box of gold in the back yard and it would make no difference if I
did.  No matter how you &quot;save&quot; for retirement the reality is that you will
be retired and other people will be supporting you.  If you are drawing
interest and dividends from your &quot;investments&quot; then the cost is nailed
onto the goods or services that are being created by the current working
people.  They are supporting your retirement; not some ridiculous box of
gold in the back yard, or your bonds, or your stocks.  Us old coots have
an obligation to not take more than what we need to &quot;get by&quot;.  Unless we
simply erase ourselves by jumping in front of a bus then being thrifty is
about the best we can do. And I am NOT going to jump in front of a bus.
You're just gonna have to suffer, poor baby.

The Social Security system  does not just pay to support old coots.  It
also pays survivor benefits to the kids of folks that die prematurely.
And it is the most efficient government program in about the whole damned
world.  That FICA tax can be seen as a _FORCED_ savings program if you
want to look at it that way.  You will get it back if you don't allow the
Republicans to steal the money and flush it down the toilet in Iraq.  You
will get it back if tax money is used for research, development,
education, infrastructure, and _REAL_ capital development.  Those are the
things that make it to where the working people need only work 30 hours a
week in the future so as to produce adequate stuff for all the people; the
very young, the very old, and the productive people all at once.  You were
educated by me to produce the machinery and technology that allows you to
do what you do and make as much stuff as you do.  You are my box of gold
in the back yard. If I have failed then I won't need that bus.

Nice dissertation, but the real question was what to do to protect
against recession. My presumption is that self protection against job
loss is the same thing that needs to be done for protection against
recession.

Investment in stocks is nothing more than buying a business.  When you
need income, you can do one of two things.  Live off of the income/
growth of the business or sell the business and live off the
proceeds.

I don't call FICA an investment of any short.  Future SSA benefits
will be dependent on the ability to tax the future wage earners.

The problem is resolved by taxing the people that have all the money and

Well....  That's sorta correct.  But the support of SSA benefits may or
may not be totally tied to wage taxes.  To be sure, the income of the
elderly (non productive retired people) will be derived from the current
productive people. That is the way the real world is is no matter what
anyone does and no matter what the bean counters say about it.  The fact
is that old people clog up the productive activities and they need to be
moved out of the way so that the sharp and fast young people can get stuff
done.  It just isn't fair to have to work around some old coot being in
the way :)  If the old coots will get out of the way and the immigration
problem can be resolved then the wages will be quite adequate to support
the young folks in better accommodations than I ever had while they pay
the cost of my meager retirement.

It is interesting that I am recommending inflation over recession all the
time even though inflation is not good for people on fixed incomes.  That
is because I am honest.  The inflation will not be a good thing for me in
the near term and I will not live to see the long term.  But inflation is
a better thing for the economy as a whole than recession or depression.
That was something we all should have learned from the 1930's.

No.. Your idea to live off of dividends (which most people don't have)
and savings is impossible.
The US treasury (for some reason) does not have any money in it.
(Most people don't have businesses to sell off, either. You have the
strangest ideas about reality!)

No... instead the US has a 9 Trillion dollar *deficit*.

&gt; &gt; &gt; recession.

&gt; No.. Your idea to live off of dividends (which most people don't have)
&gt; and savings is impossible.
&gt; The US treasury (for some reason) does not have any money in it.
&gt; (Most people don't have businesses to sell off, either. You have the
&gt; strangest ideas about reality!)

&gt; No... instead the US has a 9 Trillion dollar *deficit*.

&gt; &gt; That is actually correct.  But we need to figure out what causes a
&gt; &gt; recession and determine if it is really a BAD thing or just a necessary
&gt; &gt; adjustment.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Investment in stocks is nothing more than buying a business.  When you
&gt; &gt; &gt; need income, you can do one of two things.  Live off of the income/
&gt; &gt; &gt; growth of the business or sell the business and live off the
&gt; &gt; &gt; proceeds.

&gt; &gt; That is true but what good does it do for you to &quot;nit up&quot; and cut your
&gt; &gt; spending and hide in a cave until the storm passes?  While there may be
&gt; &gt; good reason for the storm and while the end (a less profligate society)
&gt; &gt; may justify a slow recession, there are probably things that could have
&gt; &gt; been done to have arrested the problem beforehand and that can be done to
&gt; &gt; soften the blow now.  It is too late to prevent the &quot;bubble&quot; but it is not
&gt; &gt; too late to spread the hardship more equally so as to lessen the impact
&gt; &gt; of the recession. And you can keep your savings. The causes of recession
&gt; &gt; are slack demand and the attendant slack investment. Yes, boys and girls,
&gt; &gt; supply side theory is horseshit. The investments happen because there is a
&gt; &gt; perceived willingness to spend. And when that willingness to spend is gone
&gt; &gt; then there is no more investment. The supply siders  &quot;Live off of the
&gt; &gt; income/growth of the business or sell the business and live off the
&gt; &gt; proceeds&quot;.  And this deepens the recession and creates a real live
&gt; &gt; depression.

&gt; &gt; The problem is resolved by taxing the people that have all the money and
&gt; &gt; paying what is called &quot;unemployment benefits&quot;.  That way they (the people
&gt; &gt; who have all the money) can either think of something constructive to do
&gt; &gt; with their money or they can pay for not thinking of something
&gt; &gt; constructive to do with their money.

&gt; [..]

&gt; &gt; You want to know what you can do to protect yourself from recession, I
&gt; &gt; can't help you.  Such things happen and can be good and bad on balance.
&gt; &gt; But if you want to know what you can do to protect yourself from
&gt; &gt; depression I can help. You vote EVERY Republican out of office.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't call FICA an investment of any short.  Future SSA benefits
&gt; &gt; &gt; will be dependent on the ability to tax the future wage earners.

&gt; &gt; Well....  That's sorta correct.  But the support of SSA benefits may or
&gt; &gt; may not be totally tied to wage taxes.  To be sure, the income of the
&gt; &gt; elderly (non productive retired people) will be derived from the current
&gt; &gt; productive people. That is the way the real world is is no matter what
&gt; &gt; anyone does and no matter what the bean counters say about it.  The fact
&gt; &gt; is that old people clog up the productive activities and they need to be
&gt; &gt; moved out of the way so that the sharp and fast young people can get stuff
&gt; &gt; done.  It just isn't fair to have to work around some old coot being in
&gt; &gt; the way :)  If the old coots will get out of the way and the immigration
&gt; &gt; problem can be resolved then the wages will be quite adequate to support
&gt; &gt; the young folks in better accommodations than I ever had while they pay
&gt; &gt; the cost of my meager retirement.

&gt; &gt; It is interesting that I am recommending inflation over recession all the
&gt; &gt; time even though inflation is not good for people on fixed incomes.  That
&gt; &gt; is because I am honest.  The inflation will not be a good thing for me in
&gt; &gt; the near term and I will not live to see the long term.  But inflation is
&gt; &gt; a better thing for the economy as a whole than recession or depression.
&gt; &gt; That was something we all should have learned from the 1930's.

&gt; Recession? Inflation?
&gt; Isn't that what happens when people owe more than they can pay?
&gt; And spend 3 Trillion dollars to invade a desert sheikdom for no
&gt; apparent or productive reason?
">

You are absolutely right that most people don't have a business
(stocks) to sell or dividends to live off of (stocks).

That is because most people are fools.  The squirrel that stores nuts
for the winter has more economic sense than most Americans.

As for your comment about my lack of reality, you are wrong.  I was
telling Beladi Nasralla what she &quot;needed&quot; to do to protect against
recession.  What she needs to do is protect against job loss.  Don't
spend more than you make &amp;  put the savings in a portfolio.

The person who does not save for the future is the person who is out
of touch with reality, not me.

What I'm talking about more solidarity than compassion.  This spirit of teamwork is
what military units the world over strive to instill in their recruits.  Officers
know that this intangible quality of solidarity is more essential to victory than
technical fighting skills.  Esprit de corps goes beyond abstract concepts of
rights, justice, exchange, or even compassion.  Community solidarity is the default
survival mode of the human species.  The winning team like the winning army is made
of members who fight for the good of the whole instead of seeking personal gain.
Enlightened self-interest has never won a battle and will never secure a just

community is the antidote for fear and the basis for the cooperation necessary to

You need to do everything possible to insure that you will have a job.
If possible, you're wife should have a job also. If you currently have
one job, try to get another one. Contrary to popular believe there is
no law against having two jobs. If you are only 33 years old, it's not
going to hurt you any. Actually, you'll find it's a good character
building experience.

Health insurance is probably the single biggest problem. If you happen
to lose your job during a recession and rack up huge health expenses,
with no insurance, you could find yourself in real trouble. The
Republicans recently modified the bankruptcy laws to make it more
difficult to declare bankruptcy. This means you could suddenly find
yourself in the position of being an indentured servant for the rest
of your life.

&quot;The Bankruptcy Bill and Indentured Servitude

March 9, 2005
By Dan Gougherty

You really have got to hand it to the credit card companies,
Republicans and a handful of Democrats. They have accomplished
something in the new bankruptcy bill rarely seen in legislation - they
have turned bankruptcy laws on their head and staged an attack on the
Constitution. . .

The new bankruptcy law basically removes most opportunities for
consumers to file Chapter 7 bankruptcies which discharge debts and
instead dictates Chapter 13 laws which generally require full
repayment. . .

Which brings us to the dirty little secret of the new bankruptcy law -
an attack on the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. For those
of us who slept through high school civics or just don't flat
remember, this is the amendment abolishing slavery and indentured
servitude.

While the bankruptcy law won't bring back slavery, it does appear to
lay the groundwork for a new form of American indentured servitude. By
taking away a persons choice to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and start
over clean, the debtor can now be obliged to pay everything back to
the creditors no matter how long it might take. A debtor suddenly
becomes an indentured servant to the creditor. A kind of debtor prison
without the three squares a day. . .&quot;

&gt; I have never had this oncoming experience as an adult, taxpaying
&gt; citizen. &quot;
&gt; - Brandy, Weston, Fla.

&gt; First off, Brandy, take a deep breath. Now hold it in. Hold it. OK,
&gt; now let go. Repeat until calm. It's important to try to stay calm -
&gt; because fear is our worst enemy in an economic downturn. When
&gt; consumers stop spending and businesses stop hiring and start laying
&gt; pepole off, that can make the situation much worse.

&gt; Second: It's not clear yet that we're headed for a recession - though
&gt; economists who make a living watching out for one will admit that you
&gt; sometimes don't know you're in a recession until after it's started.

&gt; Third: You're not crazy to be a little nervous. The housing market,
&gt; especially once-booming states like yours, is already in a &quot;slump&quot;
&gt; that by most measures would have to be called a recession. And housing
&gt; has led the U.S. economy into most of the recessions in the past 50
&gt; years. On the other hand, the unemployment and inflation rates - the
&gt; sum of which came to be known as the &quot;misery index&quot; in the darkest
&gt; days of the Stagflatin' 70s - remain historically low.

&gt; There is no textbook definition of a recession, though many people say
&gt; it constitutes two back-to-back quarters of &quot;negative growth&quot; - when
&gt; the Gross Domestic Product goes down instead of its usual upward path.
&gt; While that's often the case, the official arbiter of U.S. recessions
&gt; for the past 50 years has been a group called the National Bureau of
&gt; Economic Research in Boston. They say they use &quot;a broader array of
&gt; indicators than just real GDP&quot; because those data often get heavily
&gt; revised to revision. They also look at other monthly data, since the
&gt; GDP is only calculated quarterly.

&gt; Even if you could see a recession coming on the horizon like a bad
&gt; storm, it's not necessarily going to hit everyone the same way. Most
&gt; people just get really wet when a thunderstorm hits. A few get hit by
&gt; the occasional tornado or lightning strike. Some storms are gone hours
&gt; after they begin; others linger for days.

&gt; The same is true in a recession. Right now, housing-related businesses
&gt; - builders, mortgage brokers and lenders, real estate agents and
&gt; furniture stores - are suffering. But other parts of the economy are
&gt; doing just fine. Carmakers are laying people off. But healthcare
&gt; companies are hiring.

&gt; And while the government statistics we all follow so breathlessly
&gt; measure changes in &quot;the U.S. economy,&quot; that national outlook masks a
&gt; great deal of variation in local conditions. The government data
&gt; crunchers have recently acknowledged this regional disparity in
&gt; economic growth by publishing state by state GDP data.

&gt; Last year, for example, the state of Michigan saw its portion of the
&gt; GDP slide by half a percent. For many people there, a recession is
&gt; underway. On the other hand, the fastest growing state - Idaho -
&gt; posted a 7.4 percent jump in GDP. So even if the &quot;national&quot; economy
&gt; slips into recession, your town may dodge the bullet.

First you need plenty of duct tape, canned goods, batteries, and
water.  When a recession occurs, tape up your doors and windows so the
recession can't get to you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice dissertation, but the real question was what to do to protect

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recession.

&gt; &gt; &gt; No.. Your idea to live off of dividends (which most people don't have)
&gt; &gt; &gt; and savings is impossible.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The US treasury (for some reason) does not have any money in it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; (Most people don't have businesses to sell off, either. You have the
&gt; &gt; &gt; strangest ideas about reality!)

&gt; &gt; &gt; No... instead the US has a 9 Trillion dollar *deficit*.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is actually correct.  But we need to figure out what causes a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recession and determine if it is really a BAD thing or just a necessary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adjustment.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Investment in stocks is nothing more than buying a business.  When you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need income, you can do one of two things.  Live off of the income/
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; growth of the business or sell the business and live off the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proceeds.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is true but what good does it do for you to &quot;nit up&quot; and cut your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spending and hide in a cave until the storm passes?  While there may be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; good reason for the storm and while the end (a less profligate society)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may justify a slow recession, there are probably things that could have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been done to have arrested the problem beforehand and that can be done to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soften the blow now.  It is too late to prevent the &quot;bubble&quot; but it is not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too late to spread the hardship more equally so as to lessen the impact
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the recession. And you can keep your savings. The causes of recession
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are slack demand and the attendant slack investment. Yes, boys and girls,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supply side theory is horseshit. The investments happen because there is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perceived willingness to spend. And when that willingness to spend is gone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then there is no more investment. The supply siders  &quot;Live off of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; income/growth of the business or sell the business and live off the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proceeds&quot;.  And this deepens the recession and creates a real live
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; depression.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is resolved by taxing the people that have all the money and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paying what is called &quot;unemployment benefits&quot;.  That way they (the people
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who have all the money) can either think of something constructive to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with their money or they can pay for not thinking of something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constructive to do with their money.

&gt; &gt; &gt; [..]

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You want to know what you can do to protect yourself from recession, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can't help you.  Such things happen and can be good and bad on balance.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But if you want to know what you can do to protect yourself from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; depression I can help. You vote EVERY Republican out of office.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't call FICA an investment of any short.  Future SSA benefits
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be dependent on the ability to tax the future wage earners.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well....  That's sorta correct.  But the support of SSA benefits may or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may not be totally tied to wage taxes.  To be sure, the income of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elderly (non productive retired people) will be derived from the current
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; productive people. That is the way the real world is is no matter what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyone does and no matter what the bean counters say about it.  The fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is that old people clog up the productive activities and they need to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moved out of the way so that the sharp and fast young people can get stuff
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done.  It just isn't fair to have to work around some old coot being in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the way :)  If the old coots will get out of the way and the immigration
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem can be resolved then the wages will be quite adequate to support
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the young folks in better accommodations than I ever had while they pay
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cost of my meager retirement.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is interesting that I am recommending inflation over recession all the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time even though inflation is not good for people on fixed incomes.  That
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is because I am honest.  The inflation will not be a good thing for me in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the near term and I will not live to see the long term.  But inflation is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a better thing for the economy as a whole than recession or depression.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That was something we all should have learned from the 1930's.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Recession? Inflation?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Isn't that what happens when people owe more than they can pay?
&gt; &gt; &gt; And spend 3 Trillion dollars to invade a desert sheikdom for no
&gt; &gt; &gt; apparent or productive reason?

&gt; &gt; You are absolutely right that most people don't have a business
&gt; &gt; (stocks) to sell or dividends to live off of (stocks).

&gt; &gt; That is because most people are fools.  The squirrel that stores nuts
&gt; &gt; for the winter has more economic sense than most Americans.

&gt; &gt; As for your comment about my lack of reality, you are wrong.  I was
&gt; &gt; telling Beladi Nasralla what she &quot;needed&quot; to do to protect against
&gt; &gt; recession.  What she needs to do is protect against job loss.  Don't
&gt; &gt; spend more than you make &amp;  put the savings in a portfolio.

&gt; &gt; The person who does not save for the future is the person who is out
&gt; &gt; of touch with reality, not me.

&gt; Yours is a different private reality in which you apparently live with
&gt; some luxuries that the general populace does not enjoy.

&gt; Somewhat akin to me telling a street panhandler to buy only vvs-1 or
&gt; better grade diamonds...
&gt; Nice to know, but useless in practice.
">

I disagree. There was a recent news story about a dishwasher who was
returning to Columbia with $59,000 in cash.  They caught the guy at
the airport trying to go home.  The officials presumed he as related
to the drug trade and his money was confiscated. The investigation
proved that the money was his.  There is more to the story that is
irrelevant to our topic.

The point is, If an illegal immigrant dishwasher can save $59,000
cash, Average Joe American can save for his job loss and even save for
his future retirement.

The problem is that Average Joe American would rather spend his money
on a bunch of techno-toys than invest in the future....after all,
social security will protect me, right?

By the way, if you would like to know about my luxuries, I drive a 21
year old car.  A maid I know drives a NEW leased SUV.  Just think of
the monthly payments she has to make.  Also think of the car payments
I DON'T to make &amp; can put into retirement.

Beladi,

You will not have to worry about recession or job loss.  You sound
fiscally responsible.

There are many different ways of saying the same thing, but my
favorite is:

There are two kinds of people: Those who pay interest &amp; those who earn
interest;  You have to decide which one you want to be.

Part-by-Part Extended Warranty Torture

Friday, Nov. 16, 2007
By Ed Foster

While many consider it a waste of money to buy an extended warranty,
flat panel TVs are the type of expensive and failure-prone product for
which you might make an exception. But a pattern is emerging in reports
from my readers that suggest you'd best think otherwise. By insisting on
trying to fix defective devices with one futile part replacement after
another, flat panel TV retailers and service organizations are making
extended warranties both a waste of money and time.

&quot;I purchased an Insignia flat panel television from Best Buy less than
two years ago, along with an extended warranty,&quot; a reader in Texas
recently wrote. &quot;Last month I was watching the TV when it simply stopped
working.  Best Buy sent a tech out a few days later who said he'd have
to order a part to fix it. That didn't work, and the next tech they sent
out requested that Best Buy replace my unit because he couldn't get it
repaired, but twice Best Buy refused his request. I've spent hours on
the phone with Best Buy's Lack of Customer Care Department, and hours
scheduling more attempts to replace different parts.  But apparently
once the decision has been made to deny a replacement, it's easier to
get an audience with the Pope than to talk to someone at Best Buy who
can change that decision.&quot;

When you pay big bucks for a product, and additional big bucks for an
extended warranty, shouldn't that buy something other than an
interminable wait to have it repaired? &quot;The tactics Best Buy and others
are using with their extended warranties is an issue that needs to be
raised,&quot; wrote another reader with a family member whose HD TV had given
up the ghost. &quot;His warranty says that he can get it replaced if he is
not satisfied with the product, but Best Buy says they get to take as
long as they want to try to repair it.  After his set went out, they did
finally agree to come pick it up, but it took them six weeks to fix it.
What good is a warranty that takes your big flat screen HD set and
leaves you with a big hole in your den while you watch whatever old TV
you have lying around?&quot;

It's not just Best Buy though -- another name that keeps surfacing in
many of these situations is GE, which often winds up with the service
contract for the extended warranty. &quot;My story is the same,&quot; wrote one
reader in response to a previous story about Good Guys, CompUSA and GE
all failing to honor an extended warranty on a Sony plasma TV.  &quot;I
purchased an LG Plasma TV from a Good Guys store that has since closed,
and my $1,000 extended warranty was sold to GE. Two years and four
months later, the TV does not work.  GE recommended an 'authorized'
local repair service that took two weeks just to set up an appointment
to come verify the TV doesn't work.  The technician said he would have
to order a part from LG, because this is the process GE makes him go
through. But he was certain the part would not fix the problem. Oh,
great. Three weeks later the part is in and an appointment is scheduled
another week out. On the day of the appointment the local repair service
cannot be reached because their phones are down -- my appointment is
missed and I have to reschedule another week later.&quot;

Adding to her frustration, the LG customer has since discovered that the
local repair service GE sent her to has a very dubious history with the
Business Better Bureau and doesn't appear to have a business license.
&quot;Repeated calls to GE Warranty Services are greeted with an
I-could-care-less attitude.  Here I paid $1,000 dollars for an extended
warranty and, seven weeks after my TV fails, I'm still waiting for
service. My advice to anyone who has the misfortune to have their very
expensive extended warranty plan sold to GE is to be prepared for a long
and frustrating journey.  I will never again buy anything from GE,
backed by GE or serviced by GE.  Their only interest is in growing
bigger and making more money for the Chief Executives -- GE customer
service is a thing of the past.&quot;

A big part of the problem is that extended warranties are often serviced
by third parties like GE that might have little incentive to keep the
customer happy and can also have their own interpretation of what is
covered. &quot;I purchased a Samsung HLP-6163-WX DLP TV through my Good Guys'
account a couple of years back and got the extended warranty because the
salesman assured me that the lamp was covered,&quot; wrote another reader.
&quot;Unfortunately, I'm now being told by GE that the part is not covered
under warranty because 'it's a user-replaceable part.' She said it was
my fault for not reading the contract I signed. I asked the rep to send
me a copy of this contract that says it cannot be replaced and she says
they can't do that either!&quot;

Of course, it's almost certain that somewhere deep in the fine print of
the original warranty agreement there is language that can get the
vendor off the hook. &quot;As far as extended warranties, I've never seen one
that was all inclusive,&quot; wrote another reader. &quot;In fact, there is
usually a list of parts covered and/or not covered a mile long.  Most
people don't know enough about Plasma TVs, or any other complicated
electronic device, to know what parts are expensive or wear out quickly.
The warranties seem to be written to take advantage of a person's lack
of knowledge. I always thought that technology was supposed to make our
lives easier and more comfortable, but it seems more and more that
companies are trying to stick it to their customers.&quot;

The reader in Texas would agree, although I'm happy to report that --
after complaining to the Best Buy store, the Best Buy CEO, the Better
Business Bureau, and everywhere else she could think of -- she was
finally given an in-store credit to replace her broken flat panel TV.
But she's still not a happy camper. &quot;I had to miss time from work, time
for which I was not paid, to be available for the repairman. I paid an
expensive cable bill for cable service I wasn't able to enjoy. I don't
understand why repairmen can't carry parts or a diagnostic tool with
them rather than make me wait a week for each of the parts that were
ordered. And it would seem to me that after three service calls weren't
able to resolve the problem, that another more productive solution would
have been found rather than continue to replace parts at random.  Yes, I
replaced my television, but this issue isn't over for me. Everyone in
the store told me that they hear complaints like mine day after day.
It's sad they are treating customers like this -- don't they understand
their business depends on people like me?&quot;

Unfortunately, I think what executives of Best Buy, GE, etc. understand
is that a lot of their profits depend on customers not ever collecting
on pricey extended warranties. Extended warranties are a lot like
rebates that way -- in fact, maybe they're even worse in that the
customer has more money at stake. So if over this holiday season you're
going to be shopping for a flat screen TV or other expensive gadgets,
you might want to keep that in mind.

Do you think purchasing an extended warranty is ever a good idea? Post

Fair Use or Foul?

Dell Support Upgrade Helps Support Dell Support
Sometimes it seems like vendors are running their support operations
purely as profit centers. That's certainly the impression one reader had
after encountering some annoying problems with the Dell Support Center

AT&amp;T Fails to Communicate
The big vendors are capable of bringing a lot of resources to bear on a
project, but sometimes putting all those heads together means nobody
hears anybody else. That's a feeling one reader has had on several
occasions recently, most particularly on a disappointing day when AT&amp;T
was supposed to turn on his company's new T3 telecom service.

Not really unless you buy into the over-hyped biased media reports.
Sub-prime mortgages only account for a very small %.  Those that failed
are even smaller.  The media blows it out of proportion for those that
just suck it up.

&gt; Not really unless you buy into the over-hyped biased media reports.
&gt; Sub-prime mortgages only account for a very small %.  Those that failed
&gt; are even smaller.  The media blows it out of proportion for those that
&gt; just suck it up.

There is no industry easier to get into than the industry that only needs
a seat, a desk, and a computer (and, of course, that can be exported to
India). You don't need a factory, machines, inventory, distribution
networks, cust service can be much smaller, product returns &amp; warranty
handling not needed, etc.

I've been noticing all manner of pure crap coming out. Schools of all
manner are offering &quot;travel education packages&quot; (go to all manner of
places, usually Europe/Russia/etc on a package [good deal, they organize a
package discount, split the discount between you and them, all on the
cheap). AARP for a long time took your membership and then used that to
sollicit more donations and passed your name on to life insurance,
x-insurance companies as part of some &quot;AARP&quot; program. Now, my electric
company (after the deregulation price increases) is starting up a
&quot;consumer discount&quot; program where you get a plastic card that gives you
some dinky discount and now its free, but once it gets rolling, its going
to probably come out of what they bill you. I'm seeing all kinds of this
NEW business being &quot;spun out of&quot; the existing business and its all
expanded red tape. Wife still does best with old fashioned paper coupons
from the newspapers (no names, no databases, no privacy concerns, no ID
theft, etc.). Her Alma Matter and mine, too, are bombarding us with at
least one, sometimes two sollicitations per week now to donate to the
Alumni fund, organize a bequest, buy in on these &quot;educational travel&quot;
packages, etc. Even my bank sent out a promotional to get loans for a
higher degree and, of course, splashed a statement about &quot;college grads
make ave $43,000&quot; and the fine print suggested that they cherry-picked the
data from a small number of majors to get that number (and didn't say
squat about all those who finish their programs and don't get jobs in
those subjects, etc.).

The CC business is one of the most lucrative out there. High ROI even
after all the writeoffs. And, what is the bottom line? Money...flowing
from the less rich (the poor) to the more rich (the rich). But, all the
advertising makes it sound like its &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;good&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; to go
into debt, let the parasites let you do the work and THEY get &quot;rent&quot;.

And, of course, you'd never hear any politician get up and say &quot;Hey,
people, you're just digging yourself into debt...how about pay off that
debt and save yourself a ton of money over your lifetime!&quot;

You don't lose your insurance just because you lose your job.  You
lose your insurance because you failed to plan for inevitable job
loss.  You failed to realize that YOU, not your employer, would be
responsible for YOUR health between jobs.

You don't discontinue your household fire insurance between jobs.  You
don't discontinue your car insurance between jobs.  You don't
discontinue food purchases between jobs.  You don't turn off the water
between jobs.

Why do you not make plans to insure your health between jobs?  You
don't save for this inevitablity for the same reason you don't save
for your retirement.  You don't save for these inevitablilties because
you would rather buy a bunch of techno-toys  (ON CREDIT).

As I said a few days ago, there are two kinds of people: Those who pay
interest and those who earn interest.

Unfortunately a squirrel has more economic sense than most Americans.
