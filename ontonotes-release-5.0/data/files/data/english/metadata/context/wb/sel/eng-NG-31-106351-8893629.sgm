Hello, I've been looking at Veritas as a homeschool option but am
confused how does it work. They sent a catalog in the mail for their
books, but I don't know where to start? I've looked at other
homeschool programs such as FACE and they have a defined (selected)
books for each grade level. Here's my question, I like Veritas but I
don't know where to start, do I simply buy the books and have my child
read them? What about tests, how does that work? As you can tell I am
a newbie at this so please be patient. I've also looked ab Bob Jones,
and Abeka. If anyone can help with my Veritas question or has any
other comments please let me know.

thanks,
joe

Hi Joe,

Sorry, I can't answer your question, but I recommend you post your
question to http://www.meh-sc.org instead of here.  Most of the
homeschoolers who formerly participated here have stopped using this
newsgroup because an anti-homeschooling individual with a lot of time
on his hands has made this group difficult to use.  He posts
copiously,  under a variety of names, many of which closely resemble
those of homeschoolers who use or have used this group.  He also posts
messages that pretend to be official under the name of
&quot;Moberator&quot; (note the &quot;b&quot; replacing the &quot;d&quot;).  In fact, this group has
no moderator which is what makes it possible for this individual to be
so disruptive.  He also posts a link to a website with a similar
address to the one I gave you, apparently in order to create confusion
that would prevent people from gaining access to homeschooling
information.  While it is possible to learn to recognize and avoid his
posts, many of us find it simpler to use the web forum at http://www.meh-sc.org .
I encourage you to try asking there and wish you every success in your
homeschooling.

The problem is that it is based on &quot;The resource (many books)&quot;  See comments

&quot;Dorothy Sayers, called &quot;The Lost Tools of Learning,&quot; ... Dorothy L. Sayers
(she ALWAYS stated that the L. should be included and NEVER left out was a
High Anglican (Church of England) and not a fundamentalist!!!

The &quot;America is wonderful and contains all the truth&quot; dogma is truly
sickening.  This type of jingoism needs to be addressed in the curriculum.

They use an 1828 Dictionary!!!!!!!  Words change.  This dictionary is
useless for a child looking at contemporary meanings.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The problem with ANY homeschool kit is that it is not INDIVIDUALISED to the
specific problems, needs and characteristics of the child and it is almost
exclusively VISUAL.

http://www.veritaspress.com/store/home.asp

Be careful about using phonics exclusively as many children do not do well
with this approach but learn better by whole language and / or combinations
of other approaches.

At least the instructors in this curriculum are properly trained
professional educators.

Work in with your local public school who have resources these people don't
have.

Stick to an educationally sound curriculum not merely one that has good
Christian credentials.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; do I simply buy the books and have my child
&gt; read them?
">

That's what most homeschoolers think but education is far more than having
your child read a book and answer questions.  What if the child has a
reading disability?
If your child does not primarily learn by visual input but rather by
auditory or kinesthetic approaches and if your child is not a good reader
then homeschooling should not be chosen.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What about tests, how does that work?
">

There is a great difference between evaluation and assessment which most
homeschoolers do not understand.  This is basic to all good education.
Furthermore diagnostic testing should also be administered which is not
always available to parents. Check out what is available for your use from
your local public school.

Testimony To An Infallable Bible

The church today is contending against an enemy-one cloaked in the guise of
truth and relevance. Ecumenical alliances sound the siren song of unity,
which in itself is desirable and biblical but frequently sacrifices biblical
fidelity to reach that end. The emotionalism so prevalent in modern churches
produces much heat but all too often neglects the light of God's Word. The
secular world, with its seductive refrain of &quot;tolerance&quot; presents itself as
compatible with biblical Christianity. The resurgence of Neo-Paganism and
New Age ideologies promises greater peace and power, yet only echoes the
age-old hollow promises Satan made to Eve. Now, more than ever, it is time
to proclaim the profound differences between the counterfeits and the
eternal truth of God's Word. This is what the International Testimony to an
Infallible Bible (or &quot;ITIB&quot;) is all about.

The ITIB started a number of years ago when several men were having dinner
together while attending Bible Conference at Bob Jones University. In the
course of the conversation, someone mentioned how timely it would be to have
a congress which Fundamentalists from around the world could attend to
receive inspiration, instruction, encouragement, and fellowship. A committee
was formed, and in June of 1976 the World Congress of Fundamentalists was
held in Edinburgh, Scotland. It was intended to be a one-time affair;
however, those who attended were so encouraged and blessed they requested
that another such meeting be held.

Since that date over sixteen congresses (whether global or regional in
scope) have been sponsored by the ITIB. The global or World Congresses are
held about every ten years, while regional congresses are held every year or
two in different locations around the globe.

The ITIB is co-chaired by Dr. Ian Paisley (member of the European
Parliament; Pastor of Martyrs Memorial Free Presbyterian Church, Belfast,
Northern Ireland) and Dr. Bob Jones III (President of Bob Jones University,
Greenville, South Carolina, USA). The ITIB Committee is comprised of both
ministers and laymen who meet occasionally to help guide the direction of
the ITIB. Encouraging fidelity to the Bible is their overriding concern for
the ITIB.

It is amazing how far error, posing as truth, has advanced, taking control
of so many churches and Christian institutions throughout the world. It is
our prayer that the truth of biblical separation from all error, when
understood and practiced by the pastors around the world, will reveal the
dark and dangerous situation in which the church finds itself today.

A College That's Strictly Different

Secretive Pensacola Christian controls student life with tough regulations
and unwritten rules

By THOMAS BARTLETT

Pensacola, Fla.

...

Pensacola Christian College prides itself on being different, not just from
secular colleges, but from fellow Christian ones, too.

.....

Lisa Morris was walking to class with her boyfriend last October when
something happened. At first Ms. Morris, a sophomore music major, is
reluctant to divulge the details. Eventually, however, the truth comes out:
He patted her behind.

Someone who witnessed the incident reported Ms. Morris and her boyfriend. At
Pensacola any physical contact between members of the opposite sex is
forbidden. (Members of the same sex may touch, although the college condemns
homosexuality.) The forbidden contact includes shaking hands and definitely
includes patting behinds. Both students were expelled.

....

Even couples who are not talking or touching can be reprimanded. Sabrina
Poirier, a student at Pensacola who withdrew in 1997, was disciplined for
what is known on the campus as &quot;optical intercourse&quot; - staring too intently
into the eyes of a member of the opposite sex. This is also referred to as
&quot;making eye babies.&quot; While the rule does not appear in written form, most
students interviewed for this article were familiar with the concept.

.....

There are plenty of other ways to run afoul of the rules. Last spring
Timothy Dow was caught playing the video game Halo 2. Such games are banned
by the college. Movies are also forbidden, including those rated G. Music is
restricted to classical or approved Christian (&quot;contemporary Christian&quot;
artists are deemed too worldly). Students are allowed to watch television
news at 6 o'clock, but that's it. The TVs are controlled by college
employees, who flip a switch to black out the commercials, lest students see
anything inappropriate.

In the library, books and magazines are censored. One student says she saw a
pair of black-marker boxer shorts on a photograph of Michelangelo's David.
Any books that students wish to read that are not in the library must first
be approved by administrators. Those containing references to &quot;magic,&quot; for
instance, are normally rejected. The rule book specifically prohibits
&quot;fleshly magazines and books.&quot;

......

Along with the college, Mr. Horton founded A Beka Books, acknowledged as the
largest Christian-textbook company in the world. A Beka sells textbooks to
more than 10,000 Christian schools across the country, offering a complete
curriculum for kindergarten through 12th grade. It has also won a big share
of the lucrative home-school market.

The company brings in about $70-million in annual revenue and is valued at
$280-million, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet. A sizable chunk of that revenue
goes to support the college, which does not come close to breaking even on
its own. According to its 2003 tax filing, the university collected
$20-million in tuition and fees and $3-million from contributions. The
filing attributes $15-million in income to &quot;royalties,&quot; presumably from A
Beka.

In the mid-90s, A Beka paid nearly $50-million in back taxes after the
Internal Revenue Service ruled that it should have been classified as a
for-profit entity. The college itself remains nonprofit.

Revenue from A Beka helps keep costs extremely low. Students pay $6,000 a
year for tuition, room, and board. That's about a third or a quarter of what
most other Christian colleges cost. When asked what other colleges they
considered, Pensacola students often mention Bob Jones, Cedarville
University, Northland Baptist Bible College, and Abilene Christian
University. Cost is usually cited as the deciding factor.

Just as the textbook company helps

THE REASON FOR http://www.meh-sc.org/:

In the past, the Usenet newsgroup misc.education.home-school.christian was a
dreadful place for anyone interested in education, Trew Kristyun homeskoolas
discussed sundry topics unrelated related to the educational practice of
home schooling and called professional educators &quot;trolls&quot;.

As a result of the inability of these brain-dead Trew Kriustyun homeskoolas
to look at educational issues via reflective praxis and their refusal to
engage in educational debate, the meh-sc newsgroup became less and less
useful as a place for good information or discussion

These brain-dead Trew Kristyun homeskoolas desired an exclusive forum
without the challenge from professional educators who posed questions that
they could not answer.

Fundamentalist Brandon Staggs had the rights to the name and formed
http://www.meh-sc.org/: .  Below is a critique of
http://www.brandonstaggs.com/biblical-reasons-to-home-school.html which is
typical of most Christian fundamentalist home schoolers' erroneous beliefs
on education ...mainly based on Old Testament proof verses.

#########################################################

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Offered here are just a handful of verses from God's word
">

This is one of the reasons homeschoolers should be very careful! Home
schooling is dominated by rabid fundamentalists who do not value learning
for the sake of learning. Brandon thinks the bible is the &quot;Word of God'
when in fact it is an ancient collection of books about people's experience
of God. If one reads all the bible it clearly states that Jesus is the Word
of God (John 1: 1) Such verses seem not to be read by literalists.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There are hundreds of reasons to reject the usage of the government
&gt; education system, including social, moral, academic, ethical, political,
&gt; and &quot;religious&quot; reasons. For a Christian, especially a Christian who
&gt; values the authority of Scripture, God's own words on the matter should
&gt; settle &gt;the issue.
">

This is much the same type of introduction that Christian School advocates
give for their system to be the &quot;one and only Christian way&quot; to educate
children. It is simply not true in any aspect whatsoever. This is an
unsubstantiated biased claim based on subjective opinion on bible proof
verses taken out of context.

The word &quot;school&quot; does not appear in either the Old or New Testament and
therefore the bible cannot be used to back any particular school system.
Early Christians sent their children to classical schools. Educational
concerns about the classical schools (primary or secondary) Christians sent
their children to was not an issue in any of the New Testament letters. The
letters also fail to recognise anything concerned with church as schooling.

As William Barclay correctly pointed out:

&quot;The New Testament lays down no kind of curriculum of training for the
child; the New Testament knows nothing about religious education and nothing
about schools; for the New Testament is certain that the only training which
really matters is given within the home, and that there are no teachers so
effective for good and evil as parents.&quot; (William Barclay, Educational
Ideals in the Ancient World, Grand Rapids, Mich: Baker Book House: 1974.,
p.236)

That is NOT to say that parents are naturally good at teaching academic
subjects! While professional teachers are best at teaching facts, concepts
and skills the changing of attitudes and value inculcation is best done by
parents who are not trained in teaching facts, concepts and skills. Use the
people best suited for what you want to achieve. It should be noted that
most home schoolers have no formal teaching qualifications whatsoever. It
is like refusing to send your child to a qualified professional surgeon to
have an operation and performing the task yourself on your kitchen table
because &quot;as a parent I know the child better ... and surgery is only using a
knife ...which I use to cut up the meat and veg every day ... simple!&quot; DIY
surgery is a metaphor of homeschooling.

In the 4th century the Emperor Julian challenged the Christians to take
their children out of the classical schools, where other gods were taught,
and to retreat to their own schools where they could be taught out of
&quot;Matthew and Luke&quot;. He was determined to force on Christians the
educationalconsequences of the New Testament. The Emperor Julian uses the
word &quot;anetos&quot; to describe the children of Christian parents ... it means
&quot;mindless&quot;. He suggested that they be cured by an Hellenistic education.
However, children were not penalised because of their parent's beliefs and
the classical schools remained open to all people. Two people named
Apollinaris (father and son) converted the bible into pseudo-classical
literature with the Pentateuch as a Homeric epic and the gospels as Platonic
dialogues because Julian compelled Christians to to work from texts written
in sub-classical Greek.

In subsequent centuries Christians developed a quasi-educational system to
teach the New Testament but this did not come into conflict with classical
schooling in any practical manner. basil, Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia,
wrote &quot;To Young Men on the Advantages of Greek Literature&quot; which suggested
that pupils need not be corrupted by their work, but the onus was upon
parents (and also secondarily teachers) within the church to train them in
Christian belief after school.

The historical fact is that Christians educated their children fully within
the secular system for the first four centuries after Christ's death in
spite of any contradiction that might have posed. They contradicted any
negative influence by biblical training at church and home.

Alternate schooling by fundamentalists, including home schooling, is a
reaction of their intimidated by pluralism and modernity. Jesus speaks of
being salt and light in the world not of running away from it. There would
be far fewer home schools if the world was stuck back in the 1950s where
fundamentalists wish to drag everybody.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So here we attempt to explain a conviction we have through the only
&gt; objective way possible: Holy Scripture.
">

Actually this is a very biased way which only works if you are a rabid
fundamentalist. Other Christians, like myself, do not take the bible as the
final word on anything. A Christian is meant to use their God given brain.
This explanation is also not useful for Moslems, Buddhists, Jews, Atheists,
Agnostics, etc etc etc. It ONLY works for fundamentalists ... just like
creation pseudo-science it is to be totally rejected as the subjective
opinion of fanatics.

Universal schooling is a modern invention and a culturally determined
phenomenon. As a result direct appeal to the bible as &quot;proof&quot; for a
schooling system is inadmissible.

The bible uses terms associated with the teaching ministry within a church
and educational metaphors but these cannot be honestly transposed to support
any Christian schooling concept. The Greeks had discussed education in much
the same terms as we do today by the time of Jesus ... but this is NOT what
the New Testament mentions.

The sacrifice that pleases God is that which engages the mind. (Romans
12:1).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; a heathen school
">

They are PUBLIC schools open to all, not &quot;heathen&quot; schools .... which is a
pejorative term. Should one also refer to home schooling as &quot;home skoolun&quot;
in the same manner?

There are many Christian parents in home schooling who refuse to critically
reflect on their choice of homeschooling and who constantly demonise anyone
who disagrees with them.

Furthermore, there seems to be no professional reading of any high quality
done by homeschoolers. Having refused to even consider criticism their
refuge is in poorly written fundamentalist &quot;books&quot; which no worthy academic
educational journal would consider publishing. As a result they are left to
wander in a sea of mutual ignorance. It is not their ignorance that
worries me as much as the damage they do to innocent children who deserve
much better than the amateurish witchdoctor type &quot;edjakashun&quot; of home
schooling.

censorship, coercion, or propaganda to limit access to ideas, literature,

Censorship, the twin brother of propaganda, is the tool of despots, of

1. I've continuously helped homeschoolers over the 30+ years that I've

2. I've been a Christian since 1972.  I was the first to speak about
Christian schooling at the Baptist Celebration BY INVITATION.  My toipoic

In the same manner there are &quot;pros and cons&quot; of homeschooling.  I disapprove
of homeschooling done badly like using Bob Jones Uni or Abeka material or
the other brainless approaches of people like you (and Texans) who know
NOTHING about education whatsoever.  Homeschooling done badly has to be
fixed up by professional educators like myself in the public schools.  Often
homeschool drop-outs are WORSE off than if they had had no schooling
whatsoever over the same period.

curriculum is written.  Nor can they answer anything on HOW to teach (which
isn't just ensuring that your child reads the homeschool kit books
provided).  Furthermore NO homeskoola on this ng knew anything about the
very important distinction between evaluation and assessment nor about
assessment testing compared to standardised testing.  They (and YOU) have
repeatedly shown your complete ignorance in matters pertaining to education.

Go away and play with yourself as usual, silly little illiterate homeskoola!

1. I've continuously helped homeschoolers over the 30+ years that I've
taught!

This is a lie. You are doing everything at present, and for several
years now, to *hurt* homeschoolers. The fact that you are utterly
impotent to hurt any actual homeschooler is irrelevant to the fact
that that is what you are trying to do.

Mark Tindall:
2. I've been a Christian since 1972.

And a poster child in my opinion for the worst face
of that religion. Even self-proclaimed fundamentalists
seem to behave themselves better than you do. You are
in my estimation exactly like an evangelical fundamentalist
at his nastiest, which fits exactly with the claim that that is
what you started out being. I.e. in your present condition
you seem the same sort of person---the same sort of ignorant
puffery, only with a displaced set of hatreds to drive you.

Mark Tindall:
I was the first to speak about
Christian schooling at the Baptist Celebration BY INVITATION.  My
toipoic
was &quot;the pros and cons of Christian education&quot;

Big whoop. So you were credentialed at some level as a &quot;professional
educator&quot;. I only hope that have deteriorated since, and that
your present ignorance of the subject (and pretty much all other
subjects that a real teacher would know and take keen, joyful
interest in) is no indication of what knowledge you once had.

Mark Tindall:
In the same manner there are &quot;pros and cons&quot; of homeschooling.

Nobody in this newsgroup ever said otherwise. It's just that
you don't seem to be knowledgeable or thoughtful enough to
be able to discuss either pros or cons of homeschooling, of
public schooling, or Christian schooling, of long division,
or pretty much anything else.

Mark Tindall:
I disapprove of homeschooling done badly like using
Bob Jones Uni or Abeka material [...]

You are stupid and ignorant about what you speak. Nobody
but me said anything about &quot;using Bob Jones Uni&quot;, and all
I said was I bought *Iowa* Tests (not Bob Jones material,
nothing &quot;Christian&quot; about them) from Bob Jones University
Press, which is a convenient way to buy them if one is a
homeschooling parent.

As for Abeka material, it may be some use that. I don't
and simply wouldn't use specifically &quot;Christian&quot; materials
for almost anything. All you have done, though, is sneered
at Abeka without any detailed explanation of what's wrong
with it, other than some sort of general guilt-by-association
because supposedly Christian fundies use it. The reality is
lots and lots of homeschoolers, and many of whom are
Christian do not use it or other curricula you seem to be so
animated about. Maybe you'll find somebody someday who does use
one of these curricula, maybe you can have a discussion with them
as to your specific objections. But lots of the homeschoolers
whom you chased away from this group do not use any of the
curricula you claim to be bad. No one claimed to use Robinson
in particular, which you've wasted bandwidth over and over again
complaining about.

Moreover, in the case of Robinson, your complaints were simply
pointless, stupid ones, based on the *age* of the materials used.
As though basic subjects, like reading and math, had changed since
1911, or whatever it was. If kids in public schools, taught by
professional educators were learning to read well, and to calculate
well, *then* your complaint might have had some force, but the
problem is comparatively, kids are failing to read and failing
to learn to calculate. So even learning 1911-vintage materials
would be a vast improvement on what the average kid is
getting from the professional educators.

Mark Tindall contines:
or the other brainless approaches of people like you (and Texans)

This is really, really stupid. It is like an expression of
racial prejudice. It has no basis in anything, you apparently
know nothing about either David's approach to homeschooling
or the approach of anybody who happens to live in Texas.
All of the newsgroup regulars who happen to fit those descriptions
of being David or being a Texan have shown themselves to
be far more knowledgeable than you are about any subject
you can name.

Mark Tindall:
who know NOTHING about education whatsoever.

Except that &quot;education&quot; is not much of a subject. In
school, whether that be homeschool, public school,
or private school, one teaches children to read and
write and basic arithmetic, and then one uses those
tools to teach literature, history, foreign languages,
algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, geology,
astronomy, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology,
philosophy, political philosophy, robotics and computer
science. And pretty much everyone here knows more about
those real subjects and how to teach them to their
children than you do.

Mark Tindall:
Homeschooling done badly has to be
fixed up by professional educators like myself
in the public schools.

Yeah, but public-school teachers are on the public payroll.
I.e., you are paid by taxpayers like me. So,
you claim to be able to teach, then teach.

Mark:
Often homeschool drop-outs are WORSE off than if
they had had no schooling
whatsoever over the same period.

You know, I actually agree with you about this, except
that the word &quot;sometimes&quot; should be substituted for your
word &quot;often&quot;. But, the problem is that usually when a kid
is homeschooled for a little bit and then the parent gives
up, that will be a *secular* and not a religious homeschooling
family. The phenomenon is occurring because homeschooling
has gotten somewhat trendy, and parents misjudge the
commitment necessary.

Still, given the deplorable condition of the public schools,
it would be a little hard for parents to do worse for their
kids than the public schools do. I gave you that newspaper
article from the Indianapolis Star, did I not? About how
at Northwest High School (which would have been the school
my kids go to before we moved out to the country) over 50%
of the kids dropout, and of the ones who graduate, 35% of
those graduate on a waiver? The waiver is because they
have failed to pass an exit exam. And the exit exam
is over 8th and 9th grade reading and math. And they
have had 5 tries at passing this exam. It would be hard to
do worse than the professionals are already doing.

I've said before that my scorn at your obvious ignorance
of everything you talk about, Mark, is not directed at all
professional educators. Your ignorance is not indicative of
the general condition. In fact, it would be hard for anyone to
come across as ignorant as you do about most subjects. My
sense is that the general condition of professional teachers
is mediocre, though, most of them being less educated than,
well, say, most of the regulars on this newsgroup. But,
there are some very good teachers out there as well.

I've told you that my sister-in-law was in teacher training
and that I've gotten to look over her shoulder at a lot of
the &quot;eductaionist&quot; nonsense and propaganda they fed her
in those classes. It certainly is a lot of nonsense and
propaganda. And nothing to be compared to the techne of
brain surgery, for instance. It's a lot of pointless
makework lore to meet a licensing requirement. But, anyway,
Margaret got a job at the last minute this fall teaching
in her small town's high school. She's teaching biology and
earth science and such. I don't want to hold her up as a
&quot;very good teacher&quot;. She's smart and knows her subjects
well. But I suspect she's still quite green at it. Anyway,
I was going to relate here a story that happened to her
about a week ago (in her second week of teaching). This
is disgusting story (so, if you are reading this and don't
want to be disgusted, stop now). She has one class that has
posed most of the discipline problems, and there is one boy
who has been a kind of ringleader of acting up. He was
suspended for several days, and then returned to school
on a Friday. She had a test scheduled, and he was excused
from taking the test then, because he had not been there
(makes me wonder, because in my day, you were supposed to
keep yourself caught up on the material, and be ready to
hit the ground running when you got back if you had
been absent from school for any reason). So, for 15 minutes
or so, the test progressed and this boy read a magazine in
the back of the room quietly. Then, suddenly, he stood up and
displayed the centerfold of the unspecified porn mag and
shouted to the class he had to go to the bathroom and ran
out of the room (apparently you are supposed to get a pass
to do this). He then came back in the room 5 minutes
later and sort of flung the centerfold open at Margaret
and the class, spattering everybody with what turned out to
be ejaculate. Margaret says she lost it, lost control and
discipline of the class at that moment. She just froze,
dumbfounded that anything like this could have happened.
I don't know the end of this story yet. But I do know
those other kids being in that classroom when that happened
were being dragged down to the lowest possible common
denominator, which is exactly what I said will always be
the case with any socialism like public schooling, when one size
fits gets applied to many individuals.

It is the most important aspect by a ratio of 10 million to 1,
at least. All other aspects are by comparison unimportant. *How
to teach* is by comparison of microscopic importance compared
to knowledge by the teacher of *what* to teach.

Moreover, the kind of *how to teach* training that a
state-certified public-school teacher has is *absolutely*
(not relatively, but absolutely) irrelevant to the
situation of teaching one's own child, since state-certified
teacher training keys not on the parent/child relationship but
on the artificial monstrosity of the teacher/30-students-in-a-
classroom relationship.

Now, I will certainly grant you that parents who are excellent
teachers of their own children would be useless, many of them,
in the horribly and artificially disadvantaged situation of
trying to teach 30 students in five one-hour class periods
per week. That is, the fact that a parent can be a transfinitely
better teacher of his children than the public schools can ever be,
doesn't mean the parent would be good at teaching in a classroom.
Just like a parent who is a good cook at home doesn't immediately
become a good cook of food for hundreds of students and faculty
at a school lunch cafeteria.

That seems to be a website, not a posting to this

there is no parent on the planet who shouldn't be
homeschooling. I'm sure Brandon is aware that some
parents throw their newborn babies into dumpsters
and chain them up in closets and the like. Those
parents probably shouldn't be encouraged to homeschool. I
also don't see that Brandon's biblical reasons apply
at all to me or mine, since I certainly do agree
that Scripture is God's Word, anymore than _Gargantua and
Pantagruel_ is God's Word.

Mark Tindall:
Can you comprehend English?

Apparently far, far better than you can. To recap:
Brandon on that webpage never says that there are
no &quot;cons&quot; to homeschooling.

So, in particular, when I said that no one here ever said
there weren't &quot;pros and cons&quot; to homeschooling, I being
inarguably accurate.

Unless you have somebody else in mind (other than Brandon)
whom you wish to accuse of saying there are no &quot;cons&quot; to

Sorry, mate, but you are simply out of your depth once again.
It is simply not true that I know nothing about Australian usage.

And one of the things I know is that Australians shorten their
national designation in different ways.

Another thing I know is that you are invariably intellectually
dishonest, a liar. I mean, I can Google &quot;Ozzie Australian&quot;
and come up with lots of websites which use the spelling
&quot;Ozzie&quot;. For instance,
&lt; http://www.minesandcommunities.org/Action/press1037.htm &gt;
&quot;Ozzie Uprising by The Australian&quot;
&lt; http://www.aussie-info.com/identity/language/ &gt;
&quot;Oz - Australia
Ozzie - Australian&quot;
So, the reality is that &quot;Aussie&quot; (pronounced &quot;Ozzie&quot;)
seems to be the more common spelling, but the written
usage &quot;Ozzie&quot; is used by some Australians. So the
thing you are arguing at David about is not in fact
a fixed usage, but is a slang term and both spellings
are used, and users of Australian English understand
both spellings.

Mark Tindall:
Try reading http://www.nma.gov.au/play/aussie_english_for_the_beginner/
from the National Museum of Australia.

Or, maybe you are just so logically impaired you don't understand.
It's hard to tell sometimes whether you are being deliberately
dishonest or just dimwitted. Anyway, all the examples of the spelling
&quot;Aussie&quot; in the world won't change the fact that people---in
fact, speakers of Australian English---use and understand
&quot;Ozzie&quot; as well. You can complain all you want about this,
but you have no authority to make it otherwise than it is,
and you really owe David a huge apology for your repeated
response to him on this trivial issue. Your list of websites
supporting &quot;Aussie&quot; rather than &quot;Ozzie&quot; is really
logically irrelevant to the question of the validity of
&quot;Ozzie&quot;.

Mark Tindall:

Hey, maybe I will someday. It seems I can get myself
more knowledgeable about issues in it than you, a native
speaker, with remarkably little effort on my part, and
it seems to take the piss out of you, so maybe a little
study of Strine would get me far beyond you in the subject
in no time.

Mark Tindall:
Application of the knowledge  / content in a wide context
is far more valuable.

Except application of knowledge/content is entirely dependent
upon knowing knowledge/content in the first place. No teacher
can begin to apply knowledge by teaching it, unless that teacher
has knowledge in the first place. And no student can begin to apply
any skills or knowledge unless that student has learned the concrete
knowledge in the first place.

What you repeat here is actually the tip of an iceberg,
a disaster perpetrated in public schools in the US
by academic educationists in the last 30-40 years.
Teachers struggled to teach facts and found students
resistant to memorization of names/dates in history,
drill of multiplication tables, long division worksheets,
capitals and countries, and so on. It was always a
struggle, and some kids were always resistant. But, since
there is no science to &quot;education&quot;, the &quot;theorists&quot;
(free from any actual empirical restraints and considerations
that a real science would employ) got busy and
invented these contentless lists for teachers to memorize
when they took their training. And little Marky dutifully
memorized a list of &quot;Aspects of Education&quot; in a textbook
at some point and discussed the importance of those
&quot;Aspects&quot; with his Education-school teacher. So, he
puffs himself as though he *knows* something not given
to the general public or a mere parent to understand, and
he pontificates that mere knowledge is &quot;not as important&quot;
as being able to apply that knowledge. Which A) is not
brain surgery---in fact it is a commonplace
understanding of most people, and B) misses the point
entirely. The point is that you can't even begin to apply
knowledge that you don't have. Knowledge is a prerequisite
for being able to apply knowledge. Wrongly taught in their
training courses to value application over specific
memorization of content, what has happened is that teachers
have been given dispensation not to have to teach the
memorization of facts stuff that was so difficult and kids
were so resistant to in the first place. Much more fun to
teach &quot;application&quot;, since the Education school professors
said it's more *important* and knowledge is only *one*
of the aspects of &quot;education&quot;, silly little ignorant homeskoola,
mere parent, who thinks actual knowledge is relevant, he
hasn't had the fine brain surgery training that real teachers
get. Hence, the fashionable nonsense of teaching
the causes of history without, say, memorization of
significant dates, or diminishing the amount of drill
that students have to do in long division problems, say,
because they won't get it anyway, and we have calculators
to do division for us. The result of course was
predictable: the graduation of students who neither
know anything, nor can apply any knowledge to any skills.

I agree with this comment about individualization.  Starting with a

my own curricula after that.

I noticed when looking at this that Veritas recommends Memoria Press
materials for teaching Latin.  I have used these myself in teaching
several children and am very pleased with them.  If you are interested
in a classical approach to education, you may also want to teach
Greek.  I started my children with &quot;Hey Andrew, Teach Me Some Greek!&quot;
from http://www.greeknstuff.com/andrew.html . It is a gentle program
for gradually introducing Greek in elementary school.  I expect my
children to finish it in middle school.  With this foundation, they
ought to be able to move into my old university textbooks in high
school.

Even an &quot;exclusive&quot; phonics program has to teach sight reading skills

I am deleting the articles about the universities associated with
these publishers, since I think this is largely irrelevant to their
curricula. I recommend talking to experienced homeschoolers who have
used the programs you are interested in.  I have usually found input
from other homeschoolers more useful for this kind of decision than
the theoretical comments of &quot;professionals&quot;.  Personally, I have never
used any Bob Jones materials.  I have used A Beka a bit and was not
favourably impressed with it.  I thought it was biased in several
areas to the point of being inaccurate.  On the other hand, if you
share its biases, this might not be a problem for you.

Grammar and Catholic Schools are quite good in that regard.  The Christian
Schools in Australia are a mixed bag with unscientific creationism taught in
many along with too much time wasted on religious education to the detriment
of all other areas.  Grammar, Catholic and Christian Schools are all
accredited in Australia.  Bob Jones Uni is partially accredited (but of no
worth) and Penscola Christian Academy which publishes Abeka Books is not
accredited at all.  That is the BIG problem with material from the USA.  Any
idiot in the USA can set up a &quot;uni&quot; or a &quot;educational publishing house&quot; with

It is illegal in Australia to run a &quot;university&quot; like Bob Jones or

And yet it is apparently legal to set up private religious schools
in Australia which teach creationism to K-12. Any other Australians
want to comment here? Is it really &quot;illegal&quot; in Australia to have
a private religious &quot;university&quot; but perfectly legal to have private
Christian K-12 schools?

I can imagine a government thinking it has a say or an authority
over children in K-12 (it doesn't, but I can imagine it
thinking it does). But, it seems much more intrusive of the
government to dictate post-secondary education to people who
are presumably &quot;adults&quot;. What about Sunday-school classes for adults,
is that, too, illegal in Australia?

In the US, there are public universities and private
universities. Some of both varieties (public: UC-Berkeley,
University of Michigan, private: Harvard, Yale, MIT, Caltech)
lead the world in higher education. But, there are poor public
universities (a lot of local &quot;community colleges&quot; which do
remedial high school and even middle school curricula that
the public schools didn't teach the first time around),
and there are poor private universities. Among the
private universities there are some illegitimate and
unaccredited institutions, too, such as Bob Jones University.
[There's also some weird stuff, such as the University of
Lawsonomy (check out en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Lawson) or
the Maharishi Institute in Fairfield, Iowa.]
It's not illegal or anything, but no one is likely to respect
a degree earned from a place like that. If anyone remembers
the US invasion of the little Caribbean island of Grenada
during the Reagan Administration, the reason/pretext for
the invasion was the safety of a few young American citizens
who were attending a &quot;medical school&quot; down there. That
university was an example of an unaccredited institution,
which granted degrees, presumably so that these kids could
put a &quot;Dr.&quot; in front of their name and go home and run the
family business. Caveat emptor.

Or is the accreditation in Australia merely a pro forma

universities itself governmental, or is it a private accreditation
agency, so that government education is not accrediting itself?
What if one sets up an accredited school and issues a &quot;certificate&quot;

One can make educated guesses about what is likely to work for any
given child, but one does not know until one tries because children
are unique individuals.  Behaving as if selecting the correct
curriculum is a matter of &quot;child type A matches curriculum type B&quot; is
what devalues children - treating them as things to be categorized and

There are many situations in which I would use alternative medicine
(although most likely not a &quot;witchdoctor&quot; since I don't know any) over
conventional medicine.  For example, some chronic conditions such as
auto-immune disorders do not respond well to the standard approach of
&quot;professional doctors&quot;.

Even when dealing with &quot;professional doctors&quot; I am in charge of my
health and that of my children.   They may assist or advise me, but I
make the decisions.  A couple of years ago, I had major abdominal
surgery.  In my research, I had learned that it was possible to
perform my procedure under epidural rather than general anesthetic and
decided that this is what I wanted.  My surgeons had never done this
before and the anesthesiologist, in particular, was reluctant to try
it.  They may be experts on medicine, but I am the expert on me.   I
knew that in my case, the epidural was the better decision and that is
the way they did it.  The operation was successful and I had an
unusually quick and thorough recovery.  The doctors were grateful to
me for broadening their experience.

I would never employ a &quot;professional doctor&quot; or a &quot;professional&quot; of
any kind who did not recognize my authority and respect my abilities,
nor would I let a &quot;professional educator&quot; who behaved like you
anywhere near my family .

Fundamentalist Protestants (one division of
Protestantism) are not interested in learning
anything except the bible. They are interested in
indoctrination.  There is a BIG difference.

There are several difficulties with this display of
ignornat prejudice on your part.

In the first place, no, Catholics have not *always*
been interested in learning. Some Catholics have
been so interested, and some have not. (The Jesuit
order has a high reputation for valuing learning.
But that is one &quot;division&quot; of Catholicism.)

In the second place, fundamentalist Protestantism
in origin has placed a very high value on learning.
I am thinking to Jean Calvin, for example, or
the Puritan sect in early American history. That
&quot;highly learned&quot; strain still percolates in American
fundamentalist Protestantism. Granted, that the highly
emotional Pentecostalism got blended in, and there
are strains of just plain hillbilly know-nothing
ignorance. But, the reality is there are fundamentalists
and then there are fundamentalists, and some of them
are very highly learned.

Third, yes, some fundamentalist Protestants are interested
in indoctrinating their children, and that is all the reason
they choose to homeschool. However, some Catholics have
the same motivation, and some atheists do, too. Also however,
in the public schools almost the overarching &quot;philosophy&quot;
of education is the *indoctrination* of children. Most
instruction in evolutionary biology which happens in the
K-12 public schools isn't science so much as indoctrination.
Heck, in my sister-in-law's teacher training courses, she herself
was &quot;indoctrinated&quot; in the belief that public-school teachers'
main purpose *is* to indoctrinate children, and, in particular
to indoctrinate children into politically correct socially-progressive
beliefs, and to indoctrinate children against the politically
incorrect, socially regressive beliefs that children are
supposed to be getting from parents. As a consequence of such
ideology laced into teacher training, lots of teachers
conceive of their primary function as being indoctrinators
(and not teachers) of children, and learning to be a process
in which a child is brought into parroted agreement with the
official doctrine.

Two issues:

it succeeds.  The &quot;educated guess&quot; may not be very informed.  Imagine if
your doctor only knew about antibiotics and surgery and you visit wanting
help with your broken arm.  The uniformed doctor with a &quot;vast knowledge&quot; of
two procedures would amputate your arm bnecause that is the only choice s/he
has with a limited &quot;educated guess&quot;.  Yes, it does &quot;cure the problem.  It
was probably recommended to him / her by other doctors with limited
knowledge.  Unfortunately it harms the patient more in the long term.

2. The ability to &quot;categorise and match&quot; is one of many skills that all
educators require.  When a child presents with such and such specific
problem then the specific problem is addressed using a specific remedy.  It
is the opposite of a limited &quot;educated guess&quot;.  It is what every
professional uses.  The professional uses a truly &quot;educated guess&quot; when some

The most important question in evaluating homeschooling as a movement is
&quot;How does it help the LEAST able of those homeschooled?&quot;  In my experience
over the last 30+ years, the homeschooling parents looking after such
children usually work in conjunction with doctors,  professional educators
and other professionals.

Mark Tindall:
Australian Qualifications Framework http://www.aqf.edu.au/

I read a lot of stuff there about standards and qualifications.
What I fail to find is the part which says that having a private
school which is not accredited under this system is *illegal*
in Australia. Perhaps you could point where it says that?

There's also the little problem that David raised, isn't there?
I mean the one about those Christian Community Schools teaching
&quot;creationist math&quot;. You have two choices: That curriculum and
those schools are accredited in Australia, in which case homeschoolers
teaching &quot;creationism as science&quot; is the least of your concerns,
since the Australian standards and qualifications already permit
even goofier stuff in the schools (&quot;creationist math&quot; being goofier
than &quot;creation science&quot;). I.e. accreditation in Australia really doesn't
mean much. Or these schools are not in fact accredited at all.
In which case, they are just like Bob Jones University is in the
States, and apparently perfectly legal.

Thanks for addressing that, Mike. It's one of the few

A few more comments interspersed...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In the first place, no, Catholics have not *always*

&gt; order has a high reputation for valuing learning.
&gt; But that is one &quot;division&quot; of Catholicism.)

Increasingly, whenever broad generalizations are used
without qualification, I need to hear a justification
for the generalization before I'll even entertain it.
Tindall's two huge generalizations (one actually being
(albeit stupidly) complimentary to me) surprise me.
Mostly, I'm surprised that he is insistent upon not
learning what fundamentalist Christianity is, and is
about.  Even tho you tend to be gratuitously insulting
when doing so, you've given him copious clues that he
frequently does not use this language correctly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In the second place, fundamentalist Protestantism
&gt; in origin has placed a very high value on learning.
&gt; I am thinking to Jean Calvin, for example, or
&gt; the Puritan sect in early American history. That
&gt; &quot;highly learned&quot; strain still percolates in American
&gt; fundamentalist Protestantism. Granted, that the highly
&gt; emotional Pentecostalism got blended in, and there
&gt; are strains of just plain hillbilly know-nothing
&gt; ignorance. But, the reality is there are fundamentalists
&gt; and then there are fundamentalists, and some of them
&gt; are very highly learned.
">

Apparently much of the best Biblical scholarship in the
last 100 years has come from the various Protestants, and
I think that much of it would come from fundamentalists.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Third, yes, some fundamentalist Protestants are interested
&gt; in indoctrinating their children, and that is all the reason
&gt; they choose to homeschool. However, some Catholics have
&gt; the same motivation, and some atheists do, too.
">

I'm not sure why the word &quot;indoctrination&quot; looks longer
but seems to everyone else to only be a four letter word.
Indoctrination is quite the thing with education.  As I
see it, it's just about everything in education with the
(possible) exception of the Trivium's &quot;grammatical&quot;.

And I make no apologies--To the best of my reasoning and
in harmony with my understanding of the ways of God, I
will continue to indoctrinate my children.

&gt; to indoctrinate children into politically correct socially-progressive

Peter Cameron &quot;Heretic&quot; (Doubleday; Sydney: 1994) p. 178

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&quot;LIFE ...and how to survive it&quot; - Robin Skinner &amp; John Cleese (Methuen;
London:1993)

p. 253 -255

John: ... In fact you could claim that most values in the West are derived
from Christianity, and you don't find anything more inclusive than the words
of Jesus Christ. ...

Robin: ... people interpret each myth according to their level of mental
health....
John: So let me get this right: a less healthy person will take a healthy
idea and turn it into something less healthy?

Robin: Absolutely! And vice versa too. ... Each person will bring their own
family attitudes and feelings to their interpretation of myths about
loyalty. So if hey come from a very unhealthy family, they'll feel that the
group should all hold practically identical views, and that anyone who
questions these views is a 'trouble-maker' who is being 'disloyal'; they'll
feel hostility towards outside groups, and a disregard for the rights of
such 'outsiders'; and they'll feel intense and demanding dependence on all
the other members of the group. ...loyalty to unhealthy people is simply
paranoia dressed up and relabelled.

p. 261
John: So the healthy behaviour is to look at the thinking behind
regulations; the less healthy behaviour is to take a literal and inflexible
interpretation of the letter of the law. It sounds to me a general principle
of mental health,

p. 266
John: Well, I'll attempt a rough summing-up so far. We've been looking at
the idea that each person interprets the world according to his or her level
of mental health. And it seems to me that the unhealthier we are, the more
literal minded we are in the interpretations of the letter of the law, as it
were; and the healthier we are, the more influenced we are by the broader
idea that lies behind the formulation of the myth that we are interpreting.

p. 268
John: ... we poor teenagers were hearing sermons every Sunday so
breathtakingly half-witted that the only valid response was reading,
sleeping, or invading the pulpit.... Any God, I felt, who would seriously
approve of what was going on in that church would be out of his
infinitemind.

p. 270 - 271
John: So a religious idea will be interpreted by a person in a way that fits
in best with their existing psychology?

Robin: Yes, and it can therefore support them in functioning at the best
level they're capable of, given their limitations. ... Well, take people
functioning at the least healthy level first. They'll understand religion as
a collection of rules, of rewards and punishments, of threats andpromises,
all enfoced by a powerful and frightening God.

John: The extreme black-and-white thinking found in young children?

Robin: That's exactly what it is. The thinking of such people has got stuck
at that level, and though it's normal in a very young child, it's obviously
unhealthy in an adult. ...

John: And how is God experienced?Robin: He's seen as a terrifying,
domineering, bad-temprered dictator, who wants everyone to spend heir time
admiring him and telling him how marvellous he is. ... So naturally people
holding this view feel they have to do lots of things to keep Him sweet, so
that He won't get into a bad mood and blast them with thunderbolts, or
boils, or rivers of blood.

John: A little bit like the church congregation in &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;,
who, when invited to praise God, all chant 'Ooooh, you are so big', and 'You
're so tough and strong, you could beat anyone up, even the Devil', and
'We're really impressed don here' before singing Hymn 42 'Oh Lord, please
don't burn us'. I can remember as a nione-year-old, thinking that God
couldn't be so stupid that he wouldn't se through such blatant buttering up.

p. 275 - 276

John: So the way I can explain our position now is to say this: there are
different ways of following Christ - which correspond to different levels of
mental health - and therefore it's quite legitimate to make fun of the less
healthy ways, not least because they actually conflict with His teaching!
The Inquistion was not an example of 'Blessed are the meek'.

p. 277

Robin: ... I'll start at the bottom level again. As we said just now, for
the least healthy, religion is based on the kind of thinking typical of very
yopund children. And young children have difficulty distinguishing fantasy
from reality, wishes from deeds. So at this level, religion is valued as
magic - as a means of making wishes come true, without acknowledging
scientific laws and relationships of cause and effect.

John: You mean at this level we believe that we only have to repeat a prayer
of incantation, or perform some other prescribed routine, in order to make
the world do what we want.

Robin: Yes, and when you're thinking like this, whether or not youir wishes
come true seems to depend only on how strongly you believe in the procedure!

p. 282

Robin: ... to the extent that you face and accept your own psychology,
including all your weakneses and faults ... to THAT degree will you be able
to accept and love others. And conversely: to the extent that you love
others, to that degree you will be able to love yourself.

p. 287

John: Well, everything that you've been saying implies that [Fundamentalism]
is a manifestation of a fairly low level of mental health, doesn't it? For a
start, Fundamentalists call for a literal interpretation of scripture, and
as we saw when we were discussing secular values, focusing in on the letter
of the law is a characteristic of the less healthy. In addition, wise people
tend not to exhibit literal mindedness, so it seems singularly inappropriate
to assume that this is the vein in which great spiritual teahers are
speaking. Then again, whether we're talking about Christianity, Islam,
Judaism or Hinduism, the values of Fundamentalists seem aimed at making
themselves feel better by placing all negative and destructive emotions in
people with different beliefs, and enjoying the golden glow of
self-justification that results. ... You know that simile: 'As rare as a
Fundamentalist who loves his enemy.' ... the Inquisition did largely miss
the point of 'Love Thy Neighbour', didn't they? Wasn't burning heretics
'worse' than being tolerant towards them? ...

p. 308

John: In other words, the aim is integration?

Robin: Yes. It's even there in the language. The words 'whole', 'healthy'
and 'holy' all have the same root. They're all expressions of the same idea.

Fundamentalists Anonymous: Twelve Steps to Sanity

by Lee Adams Young

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

All who have chosen to walk away from biblical fundamentalism are welcome to
join Fundamentalists Anonymous, and to consider embracing the following
Twelve Steps:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

1. I realize that I had turned control of my mind over to another person or
group, who had assumed power over my thinking.

2. That person or group persuaded me of the inerrancy of the Bible, in spite
of its many internal contradictions.

3. I became addicted to the Bible as the supreme focus of my faith, in spite
of the commandment that God should come first.

4. I admit to God, to myself and to another person the shortcomings of my
belief in the unbelievable.

5. I have made an inventory of my false claims about the Bible.

6. I have made a list of those whom I led into confusion about the Bible.

7. I am willing to make amends to all those whom I may have led astray.

8. I realize that I have the inner power to restore sanity to my life and to
search Scripture for the truth.

9. I will reach out to friends who can help me clarify my thinking about the
Bible, God and Jesus.

10. I confess that only with God's help can my mind grasp the truth.

11. I will seek through prayer and meditation to improve my conscious
contact with God, praying for knowledge of God's will for me and the power
to carry that out.

12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these twelve steps, I
will offer these steps to other former biblical fundamentalists.

These 12 steps are adapted from those of Alchoholics Anonymous.

No, this is simply an exercise in prescriptive lexicography
based on prejudice, not description. Again, there are
fundamentalists and then there are fundamentalists. Same thing
in politics with conservatives. The Current Occupant of the White
House seems to me a total nimnull, and always has. Pat Buchanan,
I loathe as a monster (ever since I saw him advocate nuking
Tehran during the hostage crisis). But William F. Buckley is
a formidable thinker. You can't just take the term &quot;conservative&quot;
and speak of conservatives as though all conservatives were
George W. Bush acolytes. If you do do that, you are engaging in
propaganda, not societal observation or analysis. Likewise, you
can't take the term &quot;fundamentalist&quot; and speak of fundamentalists
as though they were all Jerry Falwell, James Dobson, or Ken Ham.

Third, yes, some fundamentalist Protestants are interested
in indoctrinating their children, and that is all the reason
they choose to homeschool. However, some Catholics have
the same motivation, and some atheists do, too.
Marty:
I'm not sure why the word &quot;indoctrination&quot; looks longer
but seems to everyone else to only be a four letter word.
Indoctrination is quite the thing with education.  As I
see it, it's just about everything in education with the
(possible) exception of the Trivium's &quot;grammatical&quot;.

And I make no apologies--To the best of my reasoning and
in harmony with my understanding of the ways of God, I
will continue to indoctrinate my children.

Hmm.

As far as I see it the posing of this question is the single
best thing to happen in this thread, and makes the thread
worth it to me. I have tended to look upon indoctrination
as a bad thing, and to have developed something of a theory
around why I think it a bad thing (in fact, why it is even
the best public schools can do little more than indoctrinate,
whereas with homeschool there is at least a chance that it
will not be indoctrination), and why it is indoctrination can
never work, whether it is indoctrination to religious beliefs or
indoctrination to belief in Darwinian natural selection. It seems
to me the problem with the worst public-school graduates that I
have had in class at Butler is that the only school they have
known has been indoctrination. That is, they believe nothing
themselves and in themselves but know the answers they are
supposed to give when questioned. But, it occurs to me, the
way you pose the question, that this depends entirely upon
an understanding for what indoctrination is.

In the first place, I consider indoctrination to be about
&quot;doctrine&quot;, which I am happy to regard in its ecclesiastical
sense as a body of teachings about correct belief. The
keyword is *belief*. In other words, we are not talking
empirically measurable facts, we are talking the opinions of
men.

There is a passage somewhere in Richard Mitchell's writings
I like about the meaning of &quot;education&quot; to him. He points to
the story of Jesus and the woman being stoned for adultery,
and the way in which he shames her would-be executioners.
Mitchell says that this scene is his paradigm for what
&quot;education&quot; is---a teacher leading people out of
themselves to change how they are.

In other words, there is a distinction I am drawing between
putting beliefs into people, and drawing beliefs out of
people. It seems to me one can put facts into people, and
perhaps skills into people. That can work. But I don't
think one can put beliefs into people. My sense is that
those kind of beliefs students can hold in their brains
long enough to pass a test, but they will never really
make those beliefs their own. And if and when those beliefs
rub up against beliefs that conflict, and *are* the person's
own, they will prove to be very short-lived and very shallow
as beliefs.

Take a &quot;fundamentalist Christian&quot; of the kind that certainly
exists and is the very prejudice that Mark (and many people)
has of fundamentalist Christians. Imagine that he tries to
indoctrinate his child into his beliefs in homeschool. My
belief is that that will never work. He can teach his child to
read the Bible, and he can tell him all kinds of things about it,
but the child is going learn/internalize only that which is
his own, and will not internalize that which is at odds with
himself.

Take an atheist out to indoctrinate his children in atheism:
I don't think that could ever work. Disbelief in God is
an opinion, a belief. It isn't a fact or a skill. It has
reason and rootedness in facts. But contrary conclusions
are possible. And, therefore, are going to be up to the
child to decide/conclude for himself.

I can demand my children take piano lessons and practice
piano while they are young. I cannot make them love
piano as an instrument.

It's why propaganda programs never really work. Because
people know that it is propaganda.

Also, indoctrination seems to me, because we are talking about
the formation of opinion, often to rely upon a kind of
censorship of input. As indoctrinator one wants to achieve
a certain kind of output, which is supposed to be a function
of the input entered into the student. The fundamental problem
with this model, is that the student isn't a computer with
only inputs and outputs, but is an independent soul, with equal
value before God. I.e., with an absolutely equal Right to his
own opinion. In a sense, he is a source of inputs to himself,
which are totally outside of external control. And woe betide
the teacher whose indoctrination has depended upon censoring
certain inputs! What the child learns then is that the
teacher is a deceiver.

It's been the greater part of a century since the Scopes
trial. It has long been the case that evolutionary biology
has been taught in the US public-school classroom. And not
creationism. And yet Gallup polls still find that of the
80% of Americans who identify as Christians, half of these
are young-earth creationists. How is it possible that all
these hundred-million-plus people have had &quot;correct&quot;
public-school teachings, and yet they don't grow up believing
what it is they have been taught?

Or smoking---I've attended several rock concerts in the last year
where it took me by surprise to see how many young people were
smoking cigarettes. How is that possible? Haven't the schools
been preaching anti-smoking ever since I went to school forty
years ago? Why is it the case that what the schools teach is not
the same thing actually learned by the students?

To me the answer is the very conception by our system of
public schooling of teaching as a kind of indoctrination---what
I see as a shallow manipulation of students into &quot;correct&quot;
opinion.

I've seen Kanga's family in action. It seems to Martha and
to me that that family knows how to love. And so, I imagine,
the children will very much probably grow up in the beliefs of
Kanga and her husband. The children will see it as a good way to
live. They will know this in themselves and those beliefs will
come from themselves. I see this as the opposite of indoctrination,
however. It's the distinction between telling one's child what
one believes about something versus telling one's child that he
must believe this way and not that way.

You say, Marty, &quot;To the best of my reasoning and
in harmony with my understanding of the ways of God&quot;
and that's where I see the possibility that we have a
different understanding of the term &quot;indoctrinate&quot;.

Brandon:

Well, it seems to me that he is one the usual suspects
in the usage of the word &quot;fundamentalist&quot; that Mark Tindall
employs, and that Dobson (in my opinion) is infamous for
his pornography-made-Ted-Bundy-into-a-serial-killer shtik,
and he's certainly been cited as one of the suspects in
the brouhaha over Walmart switching its official yuletide
greeting from &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; to &quot;Happy Holidays&quot;.

My point that there are fundamentalists and then there
are fundamentalists is not meant to exclude Mark
Tindall's usage (equals the pop usage) from validity,
but is more concerned about recognizing that there
are *also* plenty of self-proclaimed &quot;fundamentalists&quot; who are
quite learned and who do not fit the pop usage at all.
Do you not think the pop usage includes figures like Dobson?
Or are you insisting that &quot;fundamentalist&quot; only be a much
more restrictive term than the pop usage? If the latter,
I might disagree that the usage is yours to prescribe. If the
former, then I might learn something from hearing your reasons
why Dobson is not fundamentalist in the pop sense of the term.

Dobson's elevation of psychological mumbo jumbo to the level of

Yes.

What are the fundamentals of Christianity?

There are NONE!!!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are, however, certain problems associated with any such attempt to lay
down what is essential to the faith or that by which, in a historic phrase
the Church stands or falls.

First of all there is the practical question of who decides. In a period
where there is a universal Church, when everyone is a Christian and the only
dispute is whether they are orthodox or heretical, it is relatively simple:
the Church decides. But what happens when the Church begins to fragment into
various denominations, and the 'Fundamentals' of a particular denomination
are different from those of another, each claiming to be orthodox? What
happens when the Fundamentals of a Christian movement which claims to be
impeccably conservative are different from the Fundamentals of early
Christian orthodoxy? Is there not, for example, something odd in the fact
that Fundamentalism's five Fundamentals do not include everything in the
classic Christian creeds?

And that leads to the second problem, a logical problem. What is the status
of those elements of Christianity which are not included in the
Fundamentals? Take the residue of the Apostles' Creed which is not covered
by the five Fundamentals of Funda­mentalism: for example, the creation and
the Holy Spirit. Does their absence from the Fundamentalists' creed imply
that they are unimportant, optional, mistaken? I suppose the Fundamentalists
would argue that their insistence on the infallibility of the Bible takes
care of the creation and the Holy Spirit, but in that case why single out
the resurrection and the virgin birth for special mention? Is it in fact
possible for any movement claiming to stand in the tradition of orthodoxy to
make any pronounce­ment at all on the Fundamentals of the faith, which does
not simply repeat previous such pronouncements? In other words, can
something which has once been stated to be fundamental to Christianity ever
cease to be fundamental?

The third problem is partly logical and partly psychological. The
implication of the Fundamentalists' Fundamentals is that you must believe
them before you can claim to be a Christian. But how can you be required to
believe anything? Does the formulation 'You must believe' make any sense at
all? We do not in fact decide what to believe or if we do we are misusing
the word 'believe'. The content of a belief constrains us to believe. To
that extent it does make sense to say I must believe it: I must believe it
because it's true. But I cannot be compelled to believe anything by external
authority, not just because l might wish to resist that authority but
because belief cannot be coerced.Now if the Fundamentalists say that they
are simply stating in their Fundamentals what is true, and that is why I
must believe them, the question naturally arises: what about all the other
aspects of Christianity, the non-Fundamentals? Are they less true, or
untrue? It seems that any statement of what must be believed can only apply
to the whole of Christianity, that is, to the whole truth. Once the
Fundamentalists attempt to concentrate on 'Fundamentals' then either they
become logically incoherent or they are in fact trying to force us to
believe, which is impossible.

But the most important objection to Christian Fundamen­tals, or essentials
of the faith, is a theological objection: the whole idea of an irreducible
minimum of belief is contrary to the­ spirit of Christianity. It is not easy
to explain why, except obliquely - by saying, for example, in Kierkegaard's
arresting simile, that it is like trying to paint the god Mars in the armour
which made him invisible. I was once asked on a radio program to sum up in
one sentence the message of Jesus. I racked my brains feverishly for a
minute, but then I thought, 'No, why should I play this game?' if Jesus
could have said in a single sentence why he had come, then it would have
been quite unnecessary for him to come at all - except in order to utter
that sentence.

...

You cannot generalise or abstract certain principles or 'Fundamentals' and
attach some saving significance to them, or make of them a test of
allegiance and put everything else on the level of non-essential or optional
or whatever. Of course it is entirely understandable why people should want
to do so. As Dostoevsky's Grand lnquisitor saw so clearly, people don't want
freedom, they want to be told what to do. And psychologically there is
nothing more satisfying than a rule book, or a party manifesto, which tells
you simply and categorically just what you should do and what you should
believe. And that psychological need is so great that you remain blind to
the fact that a religion which wants to - from rules and exclusiveness and
seeing God as a possession, and to open you up instead to the absolute love
of God is immediately involved in a hopeless contradiction whenever it
allows itself to be reduced to certain essentials or 'Fundamentals'....

And in that sense Christianity is incommunicable, in any direct sense. It
doesn't proceed on the analogy base camp in mountaineering, and 'teach'
certain minimum beliefs which you can then build upon for the purposes of
your individual attempts to climb higher, but below which you need never go
in refreshing yourself and taking stock. Much more apt is the anaIogy of the
pilgrimage or voyage, which is different for everyone, and on which you
never come back to the same point.It is your pilgrimage, your voyage, and no
one else has ever taken exactly the same route. You can get advice from
other people, hints on the sort of things that might happen to you and the
sort of things you might do; but no one can travel with you, far less
instead of you. And dictating to you the Funda­mentals of Christianity,
telling you what you must believe js precisely trying to travel with you or
instead of you.And, as if to prove a point, it is on this question of the
incommunicability of Christianity that the Fundamentalists really become
angry. They quoted a sermon of mine on the subject at one stage in the
heresy proceedings, without comment, as if I was condemned out of my own
mouth. Because it is here that we are fundamentally opposed. The whole basis
of their religion is that it offers salvation through acceptance of
propositions about God and Jesus Christ-the Fundamentals of Christianity.
And their whole purpose as Christians is to persuade themselves and others
to accept these propositions, to be converted. But that is precisely why
they will never be converted. In the Fourth Gospel Jesus offers freedom to
the Jews but in reply they deny that hey have ever been slaves. You cannot
liberate those who think they are free. You cannot convert a Fundamentalist.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Psychological Analysis of Fundamentalism

Fundamentalism is a religious movement, a theological &amp; philosophical stand,
a political and social force. I regard it most basically as a particular
variety of psychological development. Fundamentalists of all religious and
political varieties share the same character traits. It is the psychological
character of the fundamentalist that is at the root of the ideological
interpretation termed &quot;fundamentalism,&quot; not an intellectual or spiritual
concept.

&quot;Fundamentalist&quot; is a term sometimes used to refer to anyone who is
intolerant of other's beliefs. Fundamentalism is &quot;not so much an ideology as
it is an attitude, an attitude of intolerance, incivility and narrowness,&quot;
says Walter Shurden, professor of Christianity and director of the Center
for Baptist Studies at Mercer University. &quot;It is an attitude that says, 'We
have the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and we are going
to impose it on you and control the system so that you will have to knuckle
under to it.'&quot; As anyone who has ever attended a meeting of two or more
activists can attest, that attitude can be found at all points on the
political and religious spectrum.

There are, however, specific traits to what can be called &quot;right wing&quot;
fundamentalism (of any religion) that what is sometimes called &quot;left wing
fundamentalism&quot; lacks: authoritarianism, sexual guilt, and attitudes toward
women and homosexuals.

Psychological traits of fundamentalism:

a.. A strictly hierarchical and authoritarian worldview. Everything has to
have a First, a Somebody in Charge. In any partnership, one partner has to
have the deciding vote. Groups and societies work best with rigidly defined
roles and stratifications. (There are people who believe this way who are
not fundamentalists: at least, not religious fundamentalists.)
b.. Ethical development at the &quot;reward and punishment&quot; stage: morality
must be defined and enforced by an external authority.
c.. A lot of guilt and fear about sex.
d.. Basic distrust of human beings; certainty that &quot;uncontrolled,&quot; human
beings will be bad and vicious, particularly in sexual ways.
e.. Low tolerance for ambiguity. Everything must be clear cut, black and
white. Nothing can be &quot;possibly true but unproven at this time, we're still
studying it.&quot; Fundamentalists regard science as flawed precisely because
science changes. (A striking characteristic of fundamentalists is that their
response to any setback which may instill doubt is to step up evangelizing
for converts.)
f.. Literalism, usually including a limited sense of humor.
g.. Distrust of their own judgment, or any other human being's judgment.
h.. Fear of the future. The driving motivation of fundamentalism appears
to outsiders to be fear that oneself or the group one identifies with is
losing power and prerequisites and is in danger from others who are gaining
power. This is not how fundamentalists put it.
i.. A low self-esteem that finds satisfaction in being one of the Elect,
superior to all others. It seems to be particularly rewarding to know that
rich people have a real hard time getting into Heaven.

The life experience of fundamentalist that seems to encourage these traits
include:

a.. Conditional love: parents, or other authority figures, withheld love
to control behavior.
b.. Other factors -- sometimes mental, emotional, or even physical
abuse -- that minimized self-esteem.
c.. For those who grew up fundamentalist, the church was the central
activity of family life, all else was subsidiary to the church, and social
interaction with &quot;non-believers&quot; was discouraged, except when evangelizing.
d.. Those who have converted to fundamentalism often grew up without any
firm philosophical framework, or experienced some trauma that destroyed
their former framework. They were at a time in their lives when they needed
absolute Answers.

Fundamentalist groups reinforce these traits:

a.. They insist on a rigid hierarchy of authority. The more extreme the
group, the more authority is concentrated in one central figure.
b.. The group, and the authority figure(s) within the group, withhold or
bestow love to control behavior. Misbehaving members are cut off from
communication.
c.. They magnify current social and individual evils and dwell on the
&quot;innate wickedness of man.&quot;
d.. Sexual &quot;immorality&quot; is often their central cause.
e.. They promote a Truth which is superior to all other truths because it
is absolute and unchanging.
f.. They promote distrust of one's personal judgment, being subject
instead to the given truths of the group, the judgment of the church as a
body, or the proclamations of a central authority figure.
g.. They are apocalyptic, foretelling an immanent and horrifying future
which only the faithful will survive. Any disaster in the news is magnified
as &quot;a sign of the apocalypse.

The Alternative to Fundamentalism

Regardless of belief system, an individual is no longer a &quot;fundamentalist&quot;
when one develops:

a.. An unconditional self-esteem and (usually in consequence) an
unconditional love of others.
b.. A tolerance -- even enjoyment -- of ambiguity and diverse beliefs. One
can cheerfully live with the fact that one's neighbor on one side believes
that his little blue pickup truck is God and one's neighbor on the other
side doesn't believe in God at all, and feel no compulsion to convert either
of them. One is not frightened to question one's faith or explore
alternatives.
c.. Free social and intellectual interaction with others, beyond -- or
even without -- evangelism.
d.. A trust that one can &quot;figure things out,&quot; along with a willingness to
learn from others and to change one's mind.
e.. A faith that whatever the fluctuations in life and society, things can
and will get better. A feeling of personal responsibility and resolve to
make it so.
f.. A sense of humor.

It is not necessary to abandon all personal faith and beliefs in order to be
tolerant of others. The majority of the followers in any of the world's
religions are able to hold a strong personal belief and not feel threatened
that others hold different beliefs.

How does anyone ever become an ex-fundamentalist? Any or all of these
factors seem effective:

a.. Relationships with &quot;non-believers&quot; who become emotionally valued.
b.. Intellectual process: a build-up of contradictions between taught
morality and the behavior of church authorities and members; unresolved
questions in study of the Bible; what is taught about the world vs
observation.
c.. Receiving unconditional love and acceptance from a non-fundamentalist.
d.. A strengthened self-esteem, with the loss of the need for others to be
Wrong.
e.. A spiritual epiphany, with a new faith that one's relationship with
God is not conditional on &quot;perfect&quot; faith or behavior, that it can grow and
change.

&gt; Hmm.
&gt; As far as I see it the posing of this question is the single

&gt; worth it to me. I have tended to look upon indoctrination
&gt; as a bad thing, and to have developed something of a theory
&gt; around why I think it a bad thing
">

Sure, I understand there is that bad thing, but I question
whether the word &quot;indoctrination&quot; is really the correct
one to use.  The possible absence of a better word might be
a problem which causes us to make two irreconcilable meanings
cohabitate within the one word, but, to be short about it,
doctrine isn't a dirty word, and to imbue doctrine isn't
a dirty action.  I don't mean to insult you, Mike, but
do look it up in the dictionary.

&quot;Brainwashing&quot; comes closer to the meaning you are thinking
of, but is perhaps overly tainted.  Maybe, inculcate?

&gt; live. They will know this in themselves and those beliefs will
&gt; come from themselves. I see this as the opposite of indoctrination,
&gt; however. It's the distinction between telling one's child what
&gt; one believes about something versus telling one's child that he
&gt; must believe this way and not that way.

1.  That's about the nicest thing someone could say about
parents, in my opinion.

2.  I think you've got part of it wrong, tho.  Or maybe
say it wrong, or differently than I'd put it.  (I mean,
aside from the point that I consider what Kanga's family
does right, as you describe it, indoctrination).  It's not
the distinction between telling another what to believe vs
telling another what one believes.  The distinction
is in *showing* another why one's belief works, or makes
sense.

Theo, ignoring the function of the quotes around

&quot;division&quot; to indicate that I was adopting Mark's
usage:

Hardly. The Jesuit order is not a division of

catholicism, never has been.

I really haven't a clue what you could mean by this.

The Society of Jesus is most definitely a division, a grouping,
within the Catholic Church. Always has been. It also has a
strong history and reputation for honoring learning, including,
say, being the establisher of the finest high school in
Indianapolis, Brebeuf Jesuit Prepatory School.

&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brebeuf_Jesuit_Preparatory_School &gt;

&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus &gt;

I said:

in origin has placed a very high value on learning.
Theo:
Learning what exactly?

_Institutes of the Christian Religion_
&quot;Calvin's magnum opus, penned so early in his life, &quot;came like Minerva
in full panoply out of the head of Jupiter,&quot; and even through its
enlargements and revisions, it remained basically the same in its
content. It overshadowed the earlier Protestant theologies such as
Melanchthon's Loci and Zwingli's Commentary on the True and False
Religion, and according to historian Philip Schaff, it is a classic of
theology at the level of Origen's On First Principles, Augustine's The
City of God, Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologica, and Schleiermacher's The
Christian Faith.&quot;]
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin &gt;

or, cf. Samuel Eliot Morison, _Builders of the Bay Colony_

or, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_%28theologian%29

or, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_theology

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._B._Warfield

or read any (ancient) posting by Bruce D. Ray to this group (archived
in Google) and be blown away by the learning of the man.

Of course, all of this depends on what one means by &quot;fundamentalist&quot;,
which is a term that has pejorated at the political convenience of
the left in the last 30 years. So, it certainly is used frequently
to refer to evangelical yahoos. But, since it also seems to include
Calvinists, and since there are formidable scholars of that
stripe, I'd be careful understanding the term  in the popular prejudice
without a grain of salt.

There's another thing: I've long, long heard the analogy between
Christian fundamentalists and Muslim or other fundamentalists trumpeted
by the political left. And of course there are works of
political masturbation on that premise such as _The Handmaid's Tale_
by Margaret Atwood, which conceives of a future United States in
which &quot;fundamentalists&quot; have taken over, the Constitution has
been replaced by &quot;The Republic of Gilead&quot; and women are held in
purdah, virtually enslaved, and basically, the Christian Right
is portrayed as indistinguishable from the Taliban.

Really?

Aren't there orders of magnitude of difference and distinction
between, say, the reaction of Muslim fundamentalists to the
publication of _The Satanic Verses_ and the Christian
fundamentalist reaction to the showing of the film &quot;The Da
Vinci Code&quot;?

Much of the business of Morris Machine Co. is conducted with
General Electric's Aircraft Engine Group as our customer. The
Aircraft Engine Group is a division of General Electric

In short, some Catholics value learning, others don't. Much
like Protestants and atheists and Muslims, und so weiter.
