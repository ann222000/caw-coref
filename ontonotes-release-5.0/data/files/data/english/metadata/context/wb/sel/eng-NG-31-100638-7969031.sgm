I just ordered up a new phone with my new every 2 year discount.  They
said it would be mailed, and I need to call some number when I get it
and agree to the 2 year contract.  That's fine... Also they said all
the instructions would be there.

Question:
I want to give my phone to a family member.  Do I need to do anything
when i receive it?  In other words, is calling in to confirm my
contract extension separate from registering the new ESN?
Can I just hand over the phone to my family member, and they will be
good to register it?  Meanwhile I just keep using my old phone.

Any suggestions?

Thanks!

Well let me tell you what happened to me.

On one of my phone accounts I received a new LG VX-8300 as the new every two
phone. It has a separate ESN and Bin Hex number than the other phone I have.
But I did not need another phone per se. My girlfriend wanted a new VX 8300
and she had a Samsung on my account. I tried to just keep the phone and use
it at a later date but the lady on the phone from Verizon stated that it had
to be activated if only for a day but then I could reactivate the other
phone I use.

I said I wanted the phone as a spare, or to give to my girlfriend as a gift
since she wanted to get her own cell service.
Well I activated my older phone back a few days later, and all seemed well.

My girlfriend then go's to a Verizon Wireless store and signs up for service
and shows the new lg VX 8300 to the sales lady. She places the numbers in
the computer and the computer states &quot;the phone belongs to me&quot; they said
they could not give her service with that phone. I called up and said my
original VX8300 was still in use and she wants this phone for her own
service, told me that she can &quot;assume&quot; the liability for my account and I
said no way can that be possible.

Now since I have the same phone and paid full retail price for it I said
then what I will do is transfer that VX8300 to be the new VX 8300 and let
her have that same phone for her use. Confusing huh? Funny she takes it back
and the same thing happens this time they say some sort of ownership
transferred ?? Called an 800 number they said when my contract is up I can
then let her have the phone and then the cell phone will be available.

What a mess.

It all comes down to Verizon's inability to understand what ownership
means.  Lets think about this in automotive terms:

&lt;scenario&gt;
Dealer sells you a car, paperwork filed, money transfered...

... a few days pass ...

While attempting to get a second set of keys for said car, they asked
you why.  You explained you wanted to let your girlfriend drive it.
After an argument with the dealer manager the head mechanic comes in
from outside and says &quot;jobs done, boss&quot;.  When you inquire what the job
was, you're explained that there has been a retina scanner added to your
car to ensure that you will be the only person driving it.

&lt;/scenario&gt;

It'd be a much simpler market if the subsidy phone was eliminated.  If
they want to sell &quot;free startup&quot; phones offer a completely *seperate*
hardware contract.  This subsidy nonsense made sense when a basic phone
was $600, but today one can get a perfectly good phone-to-talk-on for $20.

Blah, what the world needs is a lot more (lower power) APRS repeaters,
and Motorola 2-way-pager sized APRS messaging devices.  Screw the cellcos!

Completely invalid.  Dealer sells you a car, it's yours.  Verizon sells
you a phone, it's yours.  Now extend that to what actually happens,
Verizon offers you a subscription service with your phone.  The phone,
again, is yours.  The subscription service is NOT yours, it belongs to
the provider and they make all the rules relating to the service.

Your example would be correct if you said, &quot;Hertz RENTS you a car..&quot;

Verizon understands perfectly what ownership means.

Ain't buying. Verizon will subscribe any non-stolen, non-delinquent CDMA
phone that has the needed GPS functionality; that's their rules. Yet they
won't allow the girlfriend to subscribe the non-stolen, non-delinquent
phone the girlfriend owns because they insist, without basis, that the
girlfriend doesn't own it, and refuse to listen to the person who they
say owns the phone regarding who owns the phone.

Yes and no.  I've seen *brand new* phones on there for under $20,
contractless.  GPS-capable CDMA 1x handsets.  The best one that stands
out in my mind was some cheap LG flip.  Seemed an amazing deal, I just
don't need another annoying CDMA phone...

Now, if I could only buy an SSB CB for $20, or a nice tri-band 6/2/.70
mobile rig for $20...  Screw this cellphone crap!

Nice, portable 80-10 rig, the size of a RAZR, with unfolding pair of
stacked 5-element beams on an unfolding 100-foot tower, a la Cartman's
