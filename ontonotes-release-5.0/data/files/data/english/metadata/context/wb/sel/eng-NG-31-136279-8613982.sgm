Hi Everyone!

As I mentioned in an earlier post, I missed you all terribly.  I had
no ability to get / give news to anyone while I was away, and it was
lonely without all of your support.  I prayed for each of you while I
was away.  It appears as though many of those prayers were answered,
as I read through the posts, I can see that everyone had a busy but
productive week.  Kris, Cheryl and Tams, seemed to have some healing
while I was away and anything that is healing in my book is a special
blessing!

Have I mentioned yet, how thankful I am for all the new moderators!
You did a Great Job with the group and some new ideas and concepts
have been born, I see!

I am so very PROUD of everyone in the group!  I am amazed with how it
has really turned into a healing zone and a welcome place for new
members to join in.  I cannot express properly how much I feel for
each of you and how big a part of my life each of you have become.
Both as a group and as individual Brothers and Sisters in my life
(each in your own special way)!

I made some new discoveries while away, some good and some not so
good, but I want to share with each of you my new found knowledge.

Lets see, might as well start with the bad and move into the good.

I am definitively sure that the RSD has spread into my shoulder, back,
hip, foot and leg on my right side.  I have the same burning, same
tremors, loss of coordination and strength.  I walk as best I can.  I
have found again, that it is rest that works the best, along with
keeping stress reduced.  My stress levels also seem to be hyper most
of the time, and I missed the quite of normal life while tackling the
family feats that came before me. I found that my toes hammer the same
way my fingers hammer sometimes, and for me the confirmation of the
spread.  (Just my opinion)

Sadly, I missed out on some good things due to the pain I was in
however also saw many good things too!  Seeing the things I could I
used mind over matter and focused on the blessing of what I could,
instead of focusing on what I could not.

I am having many difficulties with doctors, insurance companies and
politics of it all, but will try to stay positive through it as my
journey continues.  All I have to say is home and normal life is great
and I missed it all too much and am glad to be back on track.

For those of you with full body, any advice on coping would be
welcomed, because as sadness and depression creeps into my soul, I do
not want to focus on the feelings, but overcome them as many of you
have done already.  (How strong I think you all are!)  I fear that I
am slowly moving towards full body as my journey continues.  Another
reminder to me was that if you focus on the pain it becomes all that
stronger, so I try to keep my mind preoccupied and off of it when I
can.

I have found that for Noise, a few things help keep the body and soul
calm...

Wax earplugs, help with noise at a concert, and make it almost
bearable.  I did find a new issue though with this instance and it was
the sound that comes through the amplifiers / speakers.  As the sound
waves, pulse into the body, it is very uncomfortable and heightens
nerve firing and anxiety levels.  I had never thought of this before
going and advise all to avoid these situations.  They are not only
uncomfortable, exhausting and heighten your anxiety levels, but also
are very hard to cope with and you may find yourself lashing at those
nearest to your heart.

For crowds and loud noises, tissue or cotton in the ears lessens the
sounds and makes things a little easier to cope, and helps keep the
nerves a little calmer.  Also braces in public does help and if you
are able to keep limbs closely protected that it assists with bumps
and nudges that you may come in contact with.  I have found that I
have been loosing the peripheral sight of where my limbs are, and
although I do not believe in the constant protecting it is necessary
for me in this sort of situation.
Now the positive, I did find that African drumming is quite calming to
my system. I theorize that it is relaxing due to the rhythmic beat and
low sound.  I found that it brought relaxation to the nerves and
calmed rapid firing somewhat.  I have read that there are studies that
prove that this sort of music calms and resets human biorhythms.
Maybe in time, I will be able to share something regarding this with
all of you!

Finally music again!!! Whew Who!!!!

Now this bit of information that my brain processed afterward I found
quite interesting...

If a different instrument other than the rhythmic beat is added into
it, I am sad to say, it again becomes uncomfortable.  Same issue I had
with my Nature sounds relaxation tapes, if there was music added
(which all are like this) the tapes became massive Anxiety instead of
the Relaxation, for which they were meant.

Well, I will probably add more later.  This is a much longer update of
my discoveries then I initially contemplated!  I am so glad to be home
and with all of you and your support again!  I hope this made sense,
as I am still quite tired, and in much pain today.

Dearest Rain

I am terribly sorry for the spread you are having and pray for you and will continue to pray hard that you will find more ways to cope with this.  Mine has only starting spreading to my lft hip and upper leg, not more.  I am very fortunate I guess as I have not had much of a spread since I have found out that I have RSD and it has been almost 2 years that I found out I had it.  Just dealing with rt hip, leg and foot and some spread in the lft hip and thigh.  I know what you mean about spams and walking funny, it can be tough at times.  I can not tell you anything about full body, because that I can not imagine and I pray so hard for all on here that seem to be going through that and now you too it looks like.

I am sorry too that you could not do all you wanted while you were gone, due to the pain , that is tough too.  When it is hard to walk, it makes it worse as well.  My legs seem to just tighten right up and I am unable to walk much more then about 1/2 a block when the pain really starts.  I think I have been in more pain lately due to the rain again, but I do not know.

You are very right, this is an amazing group, with a warm wonderful group of friends, we are very fortunate to have each other and everyone seems to have a wonderful and unique way to make this a good group.

You were missed dearly and I will be praying hard for you and will try to help the best I can as you face your journey

God Be with you dear one

Hugs

Kris

Welcome back Rain!  I am so glad that you found some music that may
help calm the nerves.  I think I may try it!  We have been pounded
with the sounds of thunder for days and we all know what what that
comes with!  Yes, lighting!  Thus, my leg has been bad.  I have had a
lot of swelling.  We have been lucky enough not to have flooded!  So,
I am happy about that!
Hugs, Amy

Hi Rain

I'm so glad you back. I know the realization of what certainly appears
to be a spread is putting a damper on the great stuff. Take heart my
friend. I'm going to copy a post I made today on a physio forum. This
is to show you I dealt effectively with a whols side from foot to head
problem. It took a while but eventually I stopped muscle spasm and
lots of other symptoms. This
soma simple&quot; is a forum for therapists and I was answering a question.

&quot;What, do you feel, are the important aspects of MVF?&quot;

For MVF to work you need to be careful to &quot;get it right&quot; so to speak.
I can explain this best by an example.

I have a long duration left shoulder problem, diagnosed as rotator
cuff tendonitis. I had been slack in neglecting to do physical therapy
because the pain had resolved ( note when pain resolves underlying
mechanical issues must be addressed or pain will return). My shoulder
was painful and very quickly this spread to involve the upper left
side (not just quadrant) including my left side of the head and face.
I placed myself at right angles to a large mirror so that the left
side of my body was hidden from the mirror. I raised and lowered my
right arm while looking at the mirror image of the right arm
exercising. I only do the movement maybe 8 times so for as little time
as 10 seconds. I do this for three reasons. One I do not want to feel
pain on my &quot;good&quot; side two, you need to hold the focus and three, I
think the little and often therapy works better as the brain doesn't
get much of a chance to become habituated to the experience. Each time
I do it it is like a fresh experience I think. I was helped in this
understanding by Matthais Weinberger who was recently interviewed by
&quot;how to Cope with Pain&quot; web site by psychaitrist Professor Sarah
Whitman.
I hope it's OK I'm giving you the link
http://www.howtocopewithpain.org/blog/118/physical-therapist-by-day-p...

Now the interesting thing is that the pain and symnptoms retreat from
the extremities back to the origonal site of pain. Lorimer &amp; David
Butler in &quot;Explain Pain&quot; call this spread &quot;smudging the neurotag&quot;.
Well this is like rubbing out the smudge and clarifying the picture.
However in this instance, no matter how often I did the mirror trick I
could not get the pain in my shoulder to go. I was getting very
frustrated and thought that MVF no longer worked for me etc until it
hit me that I was looking at the mirror image of my arm moving and not
directly at my shoulder. Once I changed what I was doing in two to
three days the pain was gone. I then made sure I kept doing physical
therapy to correct underlying weakness.

So

A little and often
Concentrate fully
Focus on original site of pain
Address underlying mechanical issues

Hopefully, when you have school organised and things settled maybe I
can help you a little. Don't despair my friend.

Re the drumming. You might remember Isuku was talking about African
drumming for meditation. I can quite see how adding other instruments
would break the spell almost and be jarring. We should maybe ask Isuku
if he could do some drumming for us. We could use it as meditation. We
have drummers here. They seem to play a variety of drums.

So Rain some worrying news but some enlightenment. I know many prayers
are going your way.
Hugs

Hi Everyone!

Thanks for your kind words, thoughts and advice!  There was one more
thing that I forgot to add.  While I was away from the group, a friend
gave me a surprise, order of a full body massage.  I was OK with it as
the massage therapist listened to where I told her to be extra gentle,
and it was a very nice change of pace.  It was an hour long massage!

Here was the bite out of it all!

She warned me after that she has patients with Fibro and MS that have
had issues with massages reving up the nervous system.  She told me it
would be best to take a long bath after to soak and relax the muscles
so that the next day I did not have major muscle pain.  I have had
partial massages before and she was so gentle that I was sure that I
would be alright.  I did take the recommended bath and following this
is what happened.

I was WIDE awake, and reved up.  Then when I stood up and walked a few
feet away from the tub, my toes started to hammer, like my fingers do
often.  They drum their own beat (I think I mentioned this before).  I
knew the massage had triggered a rapid nerve response and started to
feel the nerves all over my body doing this.  I rested and started to
watch tv to take my mind off of it.  Here is the unusual thing.  There
was no pain, just rapid firing.  About an hour later, everything began
to calm.  I wanted to share this with all of you in case you feel good
enough to treat yourself to a massage.

For me I think an hour may have been too long and that maybe the 1/2
hour would be better.  She told me if this happened to lower the
amount of time for the massage going forward.  It took me hours to
fall asleep as it was like I was recharged like a battery.  I did feel
better for about a 1/2 day later, but did push myself that next day,
if I had rested, I think the outcome may have been better.

Hi Jeisea,

I do a brain retrain differently than with the mirrors.  It has been
working to lower pain amounts, so here is what I do.

I look at the other limb that is having lower levels or no pain.  I
try to force my brain to look at the movements and reflect back and
fourth between the limbs to set into the other limb lower pain levels
there.  I repeat to myself over and over to the limb that hurts, the
pain is easing.  Feeling a little better, moving more naturally.
&quot;Mind over matter&quot;  It seems to work, and since sitting in front of a
mirror is not always an option it seems to work in conditions where I
am not at home, or I feel like overdrive is setting in.  Sometimes I
will look at other people walking or moving more naturally and
visualize in my mind that my leg or hand etc is moving such as this
good persons limb.

Similar to those Subliminal message tapes that some people listen to,
but in my own voice within my head (or outloud) always using
visualizatio of some kind along with.  I think that it probably
prolongs the pain messages a little longer than if I sit in front of a
mirror, but it does eventually seem to work with pain reduction and
moving more naturally.  Very similar to that post from your blog,
regarding the Japanese mind over matter word, that now escapes me.
You posted it within the last week and I commented on it yesterday
through the blog.

Anywho!  I have to run!

Super big gentle huggy's to all!

Rain  :)

Wow Rain,  I am so glad this seemed to help calm things down for sometime.  I have gone to massage therapists and neither knew about RSD.  One knew about FM and she did a better job, but the other was way too rough for me.  But, anyway , the out come was not like yours.  I was somewhat relaxed after the one that had treated FM patients, but still tensed up because it is so hard for me to relax when someone touches me.  My pain in the upper body is from the FM I have the lower body the RSD.  So, I am very tense up and down my spine and have not found anyone able to help that go away.  This person was $50 a visit, which I guess is actually good compared to most massage therapist prices.

Anyway, hopefully you can find one close to home to help you through

Thanks for sharing

Hugs

Kris

You were missed my friend!!!

I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing some new CRPS pains and
hearing of the possiblity of it spreading to new areas.  I am happy
that you've experienced some good things happening as well and can
learn to use these tools when needed as coping mechanisms for you.
Thank you for sharing these with everyone.

Dear Rain,

I understand what you mean about the massage causing the nervous system to be in over drive after a massage as well...I also would have times when I would cry when I got a massage and it was a normal thing they said ...I don't remember why right now as that was a long time ago when I went to massage therapy but it was a release that made me cry and it was uncontrollable...but as I had more massage and my body was used to them this disappeared during that time for my fibromyalgia pain...I was having myofacial release therapy massage and this was before I got RSD. I always hurt the first day after I had my massage but as I had more massage then I had less pain as well.

hugs,

denee

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Hi Everyone!

&gt; Thanks for your kind words, thoughts and advice! There was one more
&gt; thing that I forgot to add. While I was away from the group, a friend
&gt; gave me a surprise, order of a full body massage. I was OK with it as
&gt; the massage therapist listened to where I told her to be extra gentle,
&gt; and it was a very nice change of pace. It was an hour long massage!

&gt; Here was the bite out of it all!

&gt; She warned me after that she has patients with Fibro and MS that have
&gt; had issues with massages reving up the nervous system. She told me it
&gt; would be best to take a long bath after to soak and relax the muscles
&gt; so that the next day I did not have major muscle pain. I have had
&gt; partial massages before and she was so gentle that I was sure that I
&gt; would be alright. I did take the recommended bath and following this
&gt; is what happened.

&gt; I was WIDE awake, and reved up. Then when I stood up and walked a few
&gt; feet away from the tub, my toes started to hammer, like my fingers do
&gt; often. They drum their own beat (I think I mentioned this before). I
&gt; knew the massage had triggered a rapid nerve response and started to
&gt; feel the nerves all over my body doing this. I rested and started to
&gt; watch tv to take my mind off of it. Here is the unusual thing. There
&gt; was no pain, just rapid firing. About an hour later, everything began
&gt; to calm. I wanted to share this with all of you in case you feel good
&gt; enough to treat yourself to a massage.

&gt; For me I think an hour may have been too long and that maybe the 1/2
&gt; hour would be better. She told me if this happened to lower the
&gt; amount of time for the massage going forward. It took me hours to
&gt; fall asleep as it was like I was recharged like a battery. I did feel
&gt; better for about a 1/2 day later, but did push myself that next day,
&gt; if I had rested, I think the outcome may have been better.

&gt; Hi Jeisea,

&gt; I do a brain retrain differently than with the mirrors. It has been
&gt; working to lower pain amounts, so here is what I do.

&gt; I look at the other limb that is having lower levels or no pain. I
&gt; try to force my brain to look at the movements and reflect back and
&gt; fourth between the limbs to set into the other limb lower pain levels
&gt; there. I repeat to myself over and over to the limb that hurts, the
&gt; pain is easing. Feeling a little better, moving more naturally.
&gt; &quot;Mind over matter&quot; It seems to work, and since sitting in front of a
&gt; mirror is not always an option it seems to work in conditions where I
&gt; am not at home, or I feel like overdrive is setting in. Sometimes I
&gt; will look at other people walking or moving more naturally and
&gt; visualize in my mind that my leg or hand etc is moving such as this
&gt; good persons limb.

&gt; Similar to those Subliminal message tapes that some people listen to,
&gt; but in my own voice within my head (or outloud) always using
&gt; visualizatio of some kind along with. I think that it probably
&gt; prolongs the pain messages a little longer than if I sit in front of a
&gt; mirror, but it does eventually seem to work with pain reduction and
&gt; moving more naturally. Very similar to that post from your blog,
&gt; regarding the Japanese mind over matter word, that now escapes me.
&gt; You posted it within the last week and I commented on it yesterday
&gt; through the blog.

&gt; Anywho! I have to run!

&gt; Super big gentle huggy's to all!

&gt; Rain :)

I am thinking so much about you right now and just want you to know just how much I care about you dear friend...may God bring answers to our disease and calmness to your soul as well.

I love you ,

&gt; Welcome back Rain! I am so glad that you found some music that may
&gt; help calm the nerves. I think I may try it! We have been pounded
&gt; with the sounds of thunder for days and we all know what what that
&gt; comes with! Yes, lighting! Thus, my leg has been bad. I have had a
&gt; lot of swelling. We have been lucky enough not to have flooded! So,
&gt; I am happy about that!

&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone!

&gt; &gt; As I mentioned in an earlier post, I missed you all terribly. I had
&gt; &gt; no ability to get / give news to anyone while I was away, and it was
&gt; &gt; lonely without all of your support. I prayed for each of you while I
&gt; &gt; was away. It appears as though many of those prayers were answered,
&gt; &gt; as I read through the posts, I can see that everyone had a busy but
&gt; &gt; productive week. Kris, Cheryl and Tams, seemed to have some healing
&gt; &gt; while I was away and anything that is healing in my book is a special
&gt; &gt; blessing!

&gt; &gt; Have I mentioned yet, how thankful I am for all the new moderators!
&gt; &gt; You did a Great Job with the group and some new ideas and concepts
&gt; &gt; have been born, I see!

&gt; &gt; I am so very PROUD of everyone in the group! I am amazed with how it
&gt; &gt; has really turned into a healing zone and a welcome place for new
&gt; &gt; members to join in. I cannot express properly how much I feel for
&gt; &gt; each of you and how big a part of my life each of you have become.
&gt; &gt; Both as a group and as individual Brothers and Sisters in my life
&gt; &gt; (each in your own special way)!

&gt; &gt; I made some new discoveries while away, some good and some not so
&gt; &gt; good, but I want to share with each of you my new found knowledge.

&gt; &gt; Lets see, might as well start with the bad and move into the good.

&gt; &gt; I am definitively sure that the RSD has spread into my shoulder, back,
&gt; &gt; hip, foot and leg on my right side. I have the same burning, same
&gt; &gt; tremors, loss of coordination and strength. I walk as best I can. I
&gt; &gt; have found again, that it is rest that works the best, along with
&gt; &gt; keeping stress reduced. My stress levels also seem to be hyper most
&gt; &gt; of the time, and I missed the quite of normal life while tackling the
&gt; &gt; family feats that came before me. I found that my toes hammer the same
&gt; &gt; way my fingers hammer sometimes, and for me the confirmation of the
&gt; &gt; spread. (Just my opinion)

&gt; &gt; Sadly, I missed out on some good things due to the pain I was in
&gt; &gt; however also saw many good things too! Seeing the things I could I
&gt; &gt; used mind over matter and focused on the blessing of what I could,
&gt; &gt; instead of focusing on what I could not.

&gt; &gt; I am having many difficulties with doctors, insurance companies and
&gt; &gt; politics of it all, but will try to stay positive through it as my
&gt; &gt; journey continues. All I have to say is home and normal life is great
&gt; &gt; and I missed it all too much and am glad to be back on track.

&gt; &gt; For those of you with full body, any advice on coping would be
&gt; &gt; welcomed, because as sadness and depression creeps into my soul, I do
&gt; &gt; not want to focus on the feelings, but overcome them as many of you
&gt; &gt; have done already. (How strong I think you all are!) I fear that I
&gt; &gt; am slowly moving towards full body as my journey continues. Another
&gt; &gt; reminder to me was that if you focus on the pain it becomes all that
&gt; &gt; stronger, so I try to keep my mind preoccupied and off of it when I
&gt; &gt; can.

&gt; &gt; I have found that for Noise, a few things help keep the body and soul
&gt; &gt; calm...

&gt; &gt; Wax earplugs, help with noise at a concert, and make it almost
&gt; &gt; bearable. I did find a new issue though with this instance and it was
&gt; &gt; the sound that comes through the amplifiers / speakers. As the sound
&gt; &gt; waves, pulse into the body, it is very uncomfortable and heightens
&gt; &gt; nerve firing and anxiety levels. I had never thought of this before
&gt; &gt; going and advise all to avoid these situations. They are not only
&gt; &gt; uncomfortable, exhausting and heighten your anxiety levels, but also
&gt; &gt; are very hard to cope with and you may find yourself lashing at those
&gt; &gt; nearest to your heart.

&gt; &gt; For crowds and loud noises, tissue or cotton in the ears lessens the
&gt; &gt; sounds and makes things a little easier to cope, and helps keep the
&gt; &gt; nerves a little calmer. Also braces in public does help and if you
&gt; &gt; are able to keep limbs closely protected that it assists with bumps
&gt; &gt; and nudges that you may come in contact with. I have found that I
&gt; &gt; have been loosing the peripheral sight of where my limbs are, and
&gt; &gt; although I do not believe in the constant protecting it is necessary
&gt; &gt; for me in this sort of situation.
&gt; &gt; Now the positive, I did find that African drumming is quite calming to
&gt; &gt; my system. I theorize that it is relaxing due to the rhythmic beat and
&gt; &gt; low sound. I found that it brought relaxation to the nerves and
&gt; &gt; calmed rapid firing somewhat. I have read that there are studies that
&gt; &gt; prove that this sort of music calms and resets human biorhythms.
&gt; &gt; Maybe in time, I will be able to share something regarding this with
&gt; &gt; all of you!

&gt; &gt; Finally music again!!! Whew Who!!!!

&gt; &gt; Now this bit of information that my brain processed afterward I found
&gt; &gt; quite interesting...

&gt; &gt; If a different instrument other than the rhythmic beat is added into
&gt; &gt; it, I am sad to say, it again becomes uncomfortable. Same issue I had
&gt; &gt; with my Nature sounds relaxation tapes, if there was music added
&gt; &gt; (which all are like this) the tapes became massive Anxiety instead of
&gt; &gt; the Relaxation, for which they were meant.

&gt; &gt; Well, I will probably add more later. This is a much longer update of
&gt; &gt; my discoveries then I initially contemplated! I am so glad to be home
&gt; &gt; and with all of you and your support again! I hope this made sense,
&gt; &gt; as I am still quite tired, and in much pain today.

It is so nice to have a large Family!

Small one here at home in the castle, but a huge one here in the house
of Cyber ville!  The support you all give, touches me deep within my
heart, and brings tears to my eyes.

I will continue to pray for all of you, and a cure for the RSD.

Rain,
I'm agreeing with you-- having a large family is grand but having a
huge Cyber family is even more important in life because we all share
one thing in common and can relate to ones own pains.
