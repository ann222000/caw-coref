I had been getting an engine code, P0422 if I remember correctly, for
some little while.  I didn't bother resetting the computer after the
second time, and it started including P0455.  Per the advice I read
all over the 'net, I replaced the gas cap (thanks, Mike!)

Well, that was a little bit ago, I finally got around to resetting the
computer on Friday (this is England, it's been a bit wet and cold.
That's my excuse, and I'm stickin' to it! :)

Anyway, this morning the check engine light came back on, showing
P0455 again, which I understand translates to, " A large Evaporative
Emission Control System leak has been detected."

Before I trust my Dakota to the Chrysler/Jeep dealer (they don't sell
Dakotas here), is there anything I can check for?  If there was really
a large leak, wouldn't there be symptoms?  What?

I haven't noted anything unusual in how the Dragon's been running,
'cept I think the gas mileage is a bit poorer than normal, but that
could just be the driving conditions here.

Any help appreciated!

Check all vapor vent hoses going from the gas tank to the charcoal
canister and from there up to the engine compartment.  The rubber hoses
often split open from age.  Sometimes the canisters plastic hose
fittings can crack as well.  One of these seems to happen on mine every
year.  Its been an ongoing battle to keep that system working.  On the
bright side it normally won't effect drivability.  Its only to lower
emissions.

The evaporative emission code indicates a large leak, it is not a raw fuel
leak but a vapor,

If there was really  a large leak, wouldn't there be symptoms?  What?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The symptoms would be check engine lamp on!!!

If it were a really large leak, and that is anything over .040 inch you
could smell some vapors.
The proper way to diagnois it is to have the dealer perform a smoke test of
the system, its a machine that injects smoke into the vapor recovery system
to detect leaks.
It has not affected engine performance

I had that problem for a number of weeks.  They changed the gas cap, checked
the hoses, etc. to no avail.  Finally, they determined that a vacuum pump on
the fuel system had stopped working.  They replaced that pump and all has
been well since (about some 40K miles ago).

Hi

I have not seen the rest of this thread, but I live in the UK as well and
have a Dodge ram.

I have a problem with the engine light flickering and wondered if this was
you problem as well, if so anything you have found out would be helpful.

Thanks

Ray:

You brought a Ram to the UK?  Braver than me, the Dakota's about as
big a vehicle I'd bring to drive the backroads here...

My engine light doesn't flicker, it just comes on, and stays on.  Not
sure what a flicker would mean.  I thought that any code would cause
the light to stay on until reset, but I could be wrong about that.

Do you know how to check the engine code?  With the engine off, click
it on ( just to power,  not to engine) off on off on.  After a moment,
the odometer should show any engine codes.  Wait until it cycles
through possible multiple codes.  When it is finished, or if there are
no codes, it'll say P done.  I'm guessing since this works on my Dak,
it'll work on your Ram, but that may be dependent on what year it is -
mine's a 2001.

As mentioned, P 0422 and apparently P0455 often mean just a loose or
damaged gas cap.  I replaced mine, but unfortunately that didn't fix
it.  I'm told by a regular here that it's nothing to worry about, more
to do with US Federal emissions standards than any real malfunction.
and that it won't affect how my truck functions in any way.

If you get any codes, I'm sure if you google them, and/or post them
here, you'll find out if they're serious, or have a simple fix.

Hello

Thanks for that.

I have carried out your instructions and I get "done" and then ------- I
assume this means no codes?.

I'd say so.  I'll leave it to the experts here to help you with
reasons why your check engine light may be flickering.

Can you elaborate on exactly what it does?  Does it actually flicker,
like a loose connection?  Go on and off a few times, then settle on or
off?  Continually flicker the whole time you're driving?  Details will
help the experts help sort this out.

My first though (I'm only a computer tech) would be a loose connection
or wire of some sort - an actual fault with the light itself, rather
than a problem with your truck.
