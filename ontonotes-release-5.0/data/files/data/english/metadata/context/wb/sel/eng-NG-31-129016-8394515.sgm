Hi Martin Phillips,

On the 19 Feb i download the last version of OpenQM GPL 2.4-17 and you
annonce by email the version 2.4-21. But no new version are on your
site in the GPL lisence. The publication of new version in GPL lisence
is in your plans?

Thanks.

The open source is not dead but it is unlikely that a new release will
be published until late this year, maybe later.

The original hope was that open source community users would treat
this project in the way we intended and that there would be a two way
exchange of software components, taking multivalue into areas where it
has never been before. The reality is that, aside from a few minor
modifications, there has really only ever been one substantial
submission to the source. Effectively, we have given away several
years work and received almost nothing in return. To be honest, we are
disillusioned with the attitude of the user community and have come
very close to abandoning the open source on several occasions.

As I said above, however, the project is not dead. We have always
stated that the open source would only contain the core multivalue
engine and that some elements would be in the commercial version only.
So far this only applies to the VFS but we are close to releasing data
encryption and this will be followed fairly soon by journalling and
replication. None of these will be in the open source version. It is
likely that the majority of the non-core developments in our future
plans will also be &quot;commercial only&quot;.

The commercial version continues to develop and is available as fully
supported software for several platforms. Although the open source is
fine for your own developments, we strongly recommend use of a
commercial licence for business applications.

Martin, I think the reasons for the lack of contributions would include the
following:

1) Most MV people don't know C, so that part of the product will have very
few contributions from this community.
2) I don't have any idea about this but I'm guessing OpenQM is still
virtually an unknown amongst non-MV people.  Some grassroots marketing in
this area would draw in typical OSS'ers to fill the gap from #1 above.
3) While it's commonly understood that much of the QM engine is written in
BASIC, I don't think many people have any idea what that means or how to
get in there to (a) see the code, or (b) contribute enhancements.  To
address this I suggest you do a few open webinars where you take the covers
off and expose the source that you intend people to enhance.  Show small
examples where you actually change core functionality - in the query
processor, dict definitions, BASIC statements/functions, or the various
areas of comunications.  I think this sort of education would bring out the
hacker in developers of all levels of experience - and these people would
be anxious to contribute something with their name on it to this project.
4) If you don't want to do a webinar, then you or someone else can write a
&quot;Dummies Guide to Hacking OpenQM&quot;.  Not only will MV people respond to this
(not the dummies part but the implication that anyone can hack QM...) but I
think novice hackers (those somewhere between script kiddies and LOD) would
find this an attractive environment to get into without yet having to
understand the OS-level nuances of TCP/IP, memory or disk management,
process control, etc etc.

I always wanted to write a &quot;How to&quot; on MV programming. I see is alot
of snipets and utilities, but they are spread all over the web. When I
was the editor for OSDA(in the late 90's), I had the idea of creating
a depositoty of all the snipets and utilities that I can across. Lack
of time mainly prevented me from doing it.

Manuals are good, but what good is it to a new programmer, if you
can't figure out how to structuly combine them to do something. I have
personaly spend alot of time teaching new programmers on how to
program in MV.

I like what QM has to offer. There are many people that have
downloaded QM as a result of me telling them about it. I have my own
personal notes on working with QM. I still don't have the time to put
anything together. I'm a one pony show now. Maybe I can get a high
school kid to post it for me.

Hi,

Thank Martin.

I currently use OpenQM GPL to develop the applications of 2 customers.
This customers use D3 and Universe. I carried out some modifications
to increase compatibility with D3 (for read and restore the file-save
and for execute the User Exit in the proc). Perhaps a day these
customers will be able to use OpenQM.

I have sufficient knowledge to modify the core of OpenQM in C or in
BASIC. Is it possible to send a request to OpenQM since Excel and Word
by using ODBC?

If you are distributing these applications to the customer, you need to be
very careful that you are not violating the terms of the GPL. Your own
application probably needs to be released in open source form too.

We do not have an ODBC interface. The only dealer that has ever had a
customer looking for this needed just four users. The development cost would
not make this a practical thing to do. This delaer then found that he could
use QMClient from Excel and do everything he wanted, faster than using ODBC.

Since QM does not natively support ODBC, you can use mv.NET to communicate
with QM/OpenQM, or any other MV DBMS.  One of the three libraries in the
mv.NET suite is specifically designed to allow the creation of ADO.NET
tables and datasets which can then be used as a data source for Excel,
Word, Crystal Reports, and other applications.  You can either send
MV-style Select statements to return data, or you can call your QM BASIC
subroutines to return data just like any relational Stored Procedure.  No
data normalization is required, you use your existing dictionary
definitions to create extended definitions which then define the data
relationships in a way that makes your MV database look relational to
external applications.  Since you support the same app over multiple MV
environments including D3 and Universe, all of your .NET code and extended
dict definitions can be used as-is with all of your MV environments with no
changes, making porting from one DBMS to another very easy.

One of the other mv.NET libraries are more MV-specific, allowing your .NET
code to look very BASIC-like: Login to an account, open files, select keys,
read records, manipulate dynamic arrays, write(v/u) data, etc.

The last mv.NET library allows you to directly bind your back-end data to
ASP.NET controls, and this now makes strong use of AJAX, so your web forms
can be as dynamic as your thick clients with little or no code to populate
controls or transfer data between forms and the back-end.

Feel free to contact me for more information, code samples, etc.

Martin P's suggestion about ODBC is solid. Real world attempts to use
the ODBC interface have shown it to be cumbersome, slow, resource
hungry and unpredictable. This is aggravated by increasing system
pressure and adding additional layers.

The qmclient API is very easy to use and facilitates simple, solid and
fast solutions.

This is a great idea and something that might be more manageable in a

Also, Jon Sisk has generously made his most excellent PICK/BASIC
programming guide available free online: http://www.jes.com/pb/

Jon's book is PICK specific but used in conjunction with the openQM
BASIC manuals should make an easy translation.

All I'm saying is if OpenQM (vs QM) is to be more successful then it needs
to be more accessible to its target audience.  That's possible with some
marketing: Don't just tell people how great OpenQM is, show them.  We've
seen that &quot;Open&quot; isn't good enough if, like most OSS projects, the average
user/developer doesn't know what to do with the source.

Tom, while you're carrying on with your personal little war based on a
complete lack of understanding of my POV, Martin is talking about
withdrawing OpenQM entirely.  In case you didn't get it, I'm trying to help

There are no plans to do this. As far as we are concerned, the core engine

information in the repeated postings available here that there is
virtually no C in openQM. Perhaps Martin could give us a percentage in

No argument there. Again, your point was? Are you suggesting that
Ladybridge could (or even should) bolster the openQM GPL project by
pulling in outsiders who have no knowledge of/interest in MV systems
when the MV people won't even get involved? This would be asking
Ladybridge to invest even more in a project that (thanks at least in
part to your shrill nay-saying) has been quite unproductive for them.
Not to mention the fact that this is almost guaranteed to be non-
productive until some critical mass has been reached in the MV

See my reply to 2) above.

You seem to be suggesting that your OP was aimed at bringing in FLOSS
people. Given that (and please don't be shy about correcting me if I
am mistaken):

What are your qualifications for offering guidance through the GPL/
FLOSS world to anyone In how many projects have you been involved
(contributions, not glancing at their web site)? From what I have
seen, it's been all in the form of nay-saying and FUD on CDP but I
would be happy to see your credits in the FLOSS world.

promises much more witty and enjoyable conversation.

If anyone Else is confused or curious about my comments, intent, views,
skills, or contributions in any area, please feel free to email my TG

done, and while I don't care about his misunderstandings I would be a
little concerned if anyone else shared his impressions.  Thanks.

Having met both Tony and Tom in person, I will contribute my theory on
this interchange (which was entertaining to me, so I was going to let
it slide, but I sense Tony seething and Tom frustrated, so maybe this
will help??):

- Tony does big picture and also makes marketing-like pitches. I do
that myself, so I can relate. When Tony writes something with a broad
brush stroke, some of the details might be based on his perception as
he incorporates pieces into the whole.

I have often stated things based on my perception at the time that
turned out to be inaccurate.  At that point, I acknowledge the error
and move on.  I do not intend to make inaccurate statements but
sometimes am moving fast and taking a global snaphot where my
satellite pictures of the details can be fuzzy when I try to interpret
them.  I suspect that Tony has similar experiences.

Also, once you read enough of Tony's posts, his couched
&quot;solicitations&quot; start screaming at you, so with each word he writes,
one might start thinking about what type of spin it might be.  On the
other hand, Tony is not sneaky in putting himself out there -- he
works overtly rather than covertly, which I can appreciate.

Without putting words in Tony's mouth, I suspect that Tony thinks that
Tom is being petty and personal in his responses, given all of the
pounding-the-pavement that Tony does to gain very broad knowledge as
it relates to MV s/w development.

- Tom is an engineer, he writes working software, is meticulous in the
details, and definitely has some brilliance shining through.  He might
make mistakes too, but different ones than Tony.  Tom does little
related to marketing and might even look down on &quot;marketing types.&quot;

Without putting words in Tom's mouth, I suspect that Tom thinks that
Tony spouts off at the mouth without really knowing what he is talking
about, does not have enough depth in his knowledge, and is sloppy when
tossing information around.

And, yes, I find them both delightful.  smiles.  --dawn

Hi all,

I think that the time has come to let this somewhat personal digression from
the original posting to come to an end. This list is for technical
discussion and, although it is not moderated, we always said that we would
ask participants to stay within the intended subject matter.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Dawn,

I don't think that is what Martin was suggesting.
