Not sure what that means. My guess is that bike was no more &quot;friendly&quot;
to Hayden than it's been all year. He makes the best of it, but it's not
quite enough.

Bike? Don't you mean tires?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

My unscientific take is that it ended up a Michelin weekend - 1st, 2nd,
4th, Melandri 17 seconds back, Hopkins 19 seconds, Checa in 7th, Elias
41 seconds back, Capirossi 43. If so, you have to give Stoner huge
credit for staying in it. But next time out it could be back to the same
ol' - and it should, considering it's Motegi, where Capirossi has won on
Bridgestones the last two years and Tamada before that. The problem is
when it's a Bridgestone weekend, no one else can stay with Stoner, but
when it's not, there are more guys capable of running at the front. In
Germany, had Rossi and Hayden not qualified so poorly, Rossi not pressed
too hard and crashed out and Stoner made Capirossi's tire choice, we
might have seen very much the same thing there.

Yes he said the clutch stopped dragging under braking after lap five
and it was like being in neutral or having the clutch pulled in
everytime he braked.  A pity really as it would have been good to see

another thing that gave me more insight to stoner's class was seeing
the telemtry of him and pedrosa during their fight early on.

stoner's acceleration and braking metrics were far smoother and less
extreme than pedrosas, yet he was able to fight quite impressively.
such smoothness, as if his telemetry was on slow-motion, while
pedrosas was on fast-forward.

granted, he's boring as a stick of wood in the post-race interviews.
for that, rossi is tremendous and i welcomed him back.  the
interviewer basically does a 1 sentence introduction, and rossie gives
an insightful and entertainign recount of the race and his effort w/o
further prompting.

you could see the weariness on rossi...both as he cross the finish
line, and during the post-race.

i really enjoyied the racing @ the front for a change.  reminded me of
the 990s..  mebbe next round hayden will stay in the fight!

From RRW ( http://www.roadracingworld.com/news/article/?article=30256 ):
______________
&quot;Three of my tyre choices for this weekend were our new compound and unfortunately
two of them didn't work too well at this track so we only really had one choice for
the race. It worked okay on the right but on the left I had no grip at all and that
was a real problem. Every lap I was losing half a second through the two left-handers
- I was getting slow on the first one and then everyone was passing me through the
second one and there was nothing I could do. It's really disappointing because I've
always gone good here, but today I never had the grip I needed. We turned the bike
upside-down and everyone did their best, but it wasn't to be today.&quot;

Doohan wasn't the chattiest of people either but he was a biking god god to
me when I was a bit younger. The guy was a cripple and he still rode like
nobody else did, that was all that counted. Rossi's antics may have won him
lots of half-clueless fans, but I believe that his true supporters onle see
a great rider and nothing else (I personally respect his talent and ability,

So is your position that it's not true unless Hayden publicly states

Pedrosa has and Hayden apparently doesn't, that's not good enough for
you? On top of the minimal effort Honda made last year to fix his
problematic bike, including that chronic clutch problem? And the
non-issue that Pedrosa's world record bonehead move at Estoril was to
Honda? And the minibike they trotted out for '07 at that time? What sort

Oh yeah! I remember when Rossi got the new fairing I was trying to see
if Edwards had it also, but he never got enough TV coverage to see...

How about that new motor though? Rossi and Pedrosa BOTH looked very
fast on the straights. I think i remember Pedrosa passing Stoner on
the straight. It must have been when he started having clutch issues.

It looks like the Repsol Hondas can stay in the slipstream and just pass
the Ducati. And the Yamaha can stay in the stream of the Honda but not
get passed. But all of that is very confused by how well either gets out
of the previous corner. The main thing is the Honda no longer looks
slow. And the Yamaha doesn't look as slow as it did.

&gt; &gt;    Hmm, talk about rusted-solid meters. Things I recall would be Pedrosa
&gt; &gt; saying that the bike was too loud and Honda making him a new set of pipes.
&gt; &gt; Since no one else seemed to be complaining about that, perhaps Honda thought
&gt; &gt; that was good enough? Of course, I'm not surprised that you'd bring up the
&gt; &gt; Pedrosa-Hayden crash, since it has so much to do with the sequence riders
&gt; &gt; get parts. As for the 'minibike', what's that got to do with parts going to
&gt; &gt; what rider first? I'd bet that Honda had an idea for the bike they wanted
&gt; &gt; to race as an 800 quite some time ago and over the years they've  proven
&gt; &gt; to be reluctant to change courses once they get an idea in their heads.

&gt; Right, and that idea was built around the notion of, as stated by senior
&gt; HRC people, &quot;compact riders for the compact bikes of the future&quot;. The
&gt; Brno bike story, the lead-up and reaction to Estoril, the design of the
&gt; new bike, Hayden's problem fitting into it, all have to do with Honda's
&gt; priorities, and I think that's pretty obvious.
">

As has been mentioned previously, the bike appears to have been designed to fit a
wider range of riders with add-on bits, like tank covers, etc. But you scornfully
dismiss that idea. Whether this scheme is the best or not is debatable. What can you
say, Honda doesn't always get it right - this seems to be one of those times when
they're playing catch up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Given all that, it would be expected that Pedrosa would get development
&gt; priority, and that's consistent with everything I've read regarding parts
&gt; upgrades reported this year.

perceptions that you have that are coloured by your preconceived notions.

&gt; Pedrosa doesn't always get things before Hayden, and Hayden
&gt; does get some stuff Pedrosa doesn't (like is slightly larger fairing
&gt; pieces that took forever to produce), but I have not once heard of
&gt; Hayden getting a general performance-enhancing upgrade that wasn't also
&gt; available to Pedrosa, whereas the opposite has been reported repeatedly.

&gt; &gt;    I can't help thinking that much of the stuff that you trot out as
&gt; &gt; evidence of this anti-Hayden cabal is more a matter of your perceptions
&gt; &gt; of things. You really seem to need to work up this mythological &quot;a poor
&gt; &gt; lad from ol' Kentucky against the might of the heartless corporation and
&gt; &gt; the midget hoards, led by the evil Ming the Merciless, er, Puig&quot; [1] and
&gt; &gt; can cite chapter and verse on all the slights that you think Hayden's
&gt; &gt; been on the receiving end of. Well, I shouldn't restrict it to just Hayden -
&gt; &gt; that seems to be a small part of the recurring theme of victimization, of
&gt; &gt; which JIS! JIS! JIS!, EuroMed 250/125 promotions, &quot;minibikes/Super 250s&quot; and
&gt; &gt; the &quot;EuroGod&quot; are part of (that stuff about Dorna trying to make sure that
&gt; &gt; Rossi wins because he's a Euro is a lot like Limbaugh's comments about &quot;The
&gt; &gt; media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well&quot;). It seems
&gt; &gt; like Spies is the next appointed victim. You've asserted that the 250
&gt; &gt; promotees are &quot;less skilled&quot; as a blanket statement, the best praise for
&gt; &gt; them that can be mustered being that, &quot;they're skilled 250 riders&quot; and
&gt; &gt; dismissing the Championships of the smaller classes (you may not like it
&gt; &gt; but the FIM takes those titles seriously, as do the manufacturers and
&gt; &gt; riders). Is now a good time to mention that whether Stoner is the lightest
&gt; &gt; (possible) winner of a World Championship, he still has to ride damn bike
&gt; &gt; and has done a great job of doing just that?

&gt; And that little blast sums up your worldview, which is so grounded in
&gt; the bikes you love, 125 and 250 two strokes, that you just can't see
&gt; straight. If you can't see why Dorna would want their mega-star to be
&gt; out front and winning, if you can't see the general impact of the biases
&gt; of manufacturers, teams and sponsors on the rider pool over the last 15
&gt; years, if you see nothing wrong with the ever-shrinking rider profile in
&gt; MotoGP, if it seems fine to you that the system means guys like de
&gt; Puniet, Dovisioso and de Angelis move right down the production line to
&gt; their appointed seats in MotoGP while a guy real accomplishment like
&gt; Spies remains outside looking in (Gresini's comment on his signing: &quot;For
&gt; us is very important to have another young Italian rider making his
&gt; debut in MotoGP with us&quot;, which, among other things, confirms that even
&gt; they think of people from San Marino as Italian), then you are blind.

If someone never watched 125 or 250 and didn't follow the racing in

What's curious about this is the view that someone who wins a national
championship is more deserving than someone who consistently comes
second in a championship in the same paddock, on a clearly inferior
bike, way ahead of the nearest person on the same bike and beating all
the other riders of the superior bike. Does Spies deserve a MotoGP ride
more than Dovizioso or Lorenzo? Why?

Oh, come on, Howard. I remember Julian trying to sell that bit around
here. One can always juggle add-on bits to get a rider to &quot;fit&quot; onto a
bike not suiting his size, there's nothing special about the 212 in that
regard. But it remains a fact that the world champion, a rider already
employed by Honda and having tested the new bike immediately after the
2006 season, was still waiting for parts to allow him to come in out of
the breeze well into the 2007 season. And that's just patchwork,
superficial stuff, the fundamental chassis design and weight

That was a conceptual argument, Howard, I was saying that if in order to
make it up through 125 and 250 and be successful enough there to get to
MotoGP you have to weigh in under 130 pounds (which has been close to
the case over the last several years), then you have to be weeding out
some rider skill in the process. If riders of an &quot;optimal size&quot;
(determined historically on 500s and SBs to be in the 145-165 pound
range) have become too large to fit through the eye of that needle, then
rider skill is, on average, being reduced. I wasn't saying a rider
developing his skills on a 250 ends up being less skilled than one doing
so on a 600 or SB, and I wasn't commenting on any particular rider in
MotoGP now. Now, do I think, say, de Angelis has more talent and skill
and potential than Spies? I seriously doubt it.

You won't find me saying Stoner has been in the favored class, that's
for sure, he's had to fight to get where he is. But you'll never
convince me that the Ducati/Bridgestone combination has turned out to be
anything but the perfect combination for him, and is quite likely the
best package in the series overall. And he only got that ride because
Gresini exercised his option on Melandri and Hayden turned them down,
it's not like from the start Ducati recognized Stoner as the best rider
in the series last year.

As for Rossi, I find it amusing that there's been all this talk of a
control tire now that Bridgestone riders are pushing past Michelin men
like Rossi and Pedrosa, all these claims of tires deciding races and how
that's ruining the series. Many also are saying that Michelin has fallen
behind because they were so reliant on their &quot;Saturday Night Specials&quot;
arriving at the track on race day. But who got those tires? Not Stoner
last year, according to him. So to what extent did tires decide the
races in the old days when Michelin totally dominated, and who benefited
from that? I don't recall a lot of people talking about that when Rossi
ruled supreme. Well, I guess I was...

So now we see a non-European rider dominated like no other since Doohan
in the last century, we see Stoner, Vermeulen and Hopkins regularly
winning races and on podiums, we see Rossi and Pedrosa truly struggling,
and we see a French tire manufacturer complaining about edge the rules
give to a Japanese one. You don't think any of that makes a difference?
I think it does.

That's barely a summary of what he said in some Spanish publication, and

Wrong, Howard, I recognize the talent of these guys, you can see that
watching the races. I also recognize that a guy like Checa has been in
the premier class for 13 years, generally on good rides, and hasn't even
won a race in nearly a decade. I recognize the advantage these guys have
in already racing in this series on these tracks. I recognize the biases
and favoritism and just plain ignorance that results in guys in 250
getting rides when guys on SBs don't. I recognize that there has been a
disturbing trend in the smaller classes that is now shrinking the size
of the average rider in MotoGP, and that is simply a fact that cannot be
denied. And I recognize what scruffy outsiders like Stoner, West and
Hopkins have done after managing to find a way to overcome all those
biases and preconceptions and favoritism.

But you seem to be in denial about all that, and I can only assume that
you can't bring yourself to see any of that because it casts a shadow on
the guys from the bikes you love. If GP goes to 600s as is rumored, and
I hope they do, it will be interesting to see how that impacts things.
Me, I think it will have a huge impact, I think we'll see riders
mysteriously getting larger again, I think we'll see more riders from
outside of southern Europe. The miniature Spaniards and Italians won't
just go away, but they'll have more competition, and the overall talent
level will rise as a result.

&gt; more than Dovizioso or Lorenzo? Why?
">

It's all opinion and speculation, of course, there's no way to determine
any of this absolutely. What one bases this one is what connections
there are. In Spies' case, you have a young guy who has now beaten the
all-time win and championship leader in AMA SB history two years in a
row, who crushes everyone else, who has been amazingly consistent
(finished 1st or 2nd in every race this year), who has shown a mature
racing intelligence of the sort that it takes to win a MotoGP
championship. Looking at Dovisioso and de Angelis, you have two guys on
factory bikes who finish near the front a lot, but who win races very
rarely, who haven't shown quite that much consistency, who exhibit some
of that emotional wild style that is typical in the smaller classes. But
of course you love that, so it's a plus and not a minus to you.

And who are they racing? Each other, there are no veterans on fast bikes
in the series who set the standard, it's just this year's crop of kids,
and that's the way it's been in 250 for almost a decade, since Capirossi
and Harada moved out of the class. In Spies case, one can compare him to
Mladin because we've seen Mladin up against guys like Duhamel in his
prime, Chandler, Gobert, Hayden, et al, and his occasional WSB wildcard
forays. Nothing like that in 250, because the Rossis, Melandris,
Pedrosas have all moved on, and failed MotoGP guys like Ukawa and Jacque
never go back. Next year when these three are gone someone else
(assumedly under age 25 and under 130 pounds) will be doing the winning,
and they will be the new flavor of the month, inevitably headed for MotoGP.

I assume you're talking about Dovi regarding the inferior bike thing,
but what is that based on? In yesterday's qualifying practice I see his
bike being a whopping 2kph off the top speed of the fastest KTM (and
10kph up on Laverty's Honda). The other guys on Hondas are Aoyama,
Simon, Takahashi, other kids who haven't proven much at all. That's the
fundamental problem with 250 today, it's a development series at the
front contested between a bunch of ex-125 kids with no point of
comparison, no standard to be measured against. The best of them (or is
it most successful?) move up as on a production line, and we don't
necessarily see tremendous accomplishment from them once they arrive -
Rossi remains the only 250 champion in decades to go on to win the
premier class championship, Pedrosa was declared the best since Rossi,
was given the best ride in the paddock and hasn't yet quite delivered,
Melandri struggles on the best tires of the year, Jacque and Harada and
Ukawa and Elias and de Puniet and others have done little, etc. West
doesn't fit the mold, has little success, drops out in frustration, gets
a major break, and now he's showing his stuff. It's a system that
doesn't show much sign of really working, given the level of advantage
these guys have.

And I suspect I've seen much more of Lorenzo, et al, than you have of
Spies...

speculate. Yes, Julian had mentioned this early on, but he's not the only person to

different size tank covers and some other differences - I came to that conclusion
too. As for Hayden's wait for a new bit of bodywork, how unusual is that kind of

&quot;A conceptual argument&quot; - I think not. Read a bit more of the linked post. Perhaps
this must be a bit more &quot;conceptualizing: &quot;Now if you can explain why these midget
riders extruded from 125/250 have more desire, skill and raw ability, beyond the
physics advantage created purely by their smaller size, then maybe you have an
argument. But I haven't seen a convincing one yet.&quot;

That stuff isn't a &quot;conceptual argument, as it's more of the same old stuff that
you regular treat us to. A &quot;conceptual argument&quot; would be like when you explain why
the American round shouldn't include the smaller classes by citing an imaginary
conversation between two imaginary American fans, or the Rossi / &quot;they all died&quot;
&quot;newsstory&quot; (which was one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen on usenet).

Why do you think a lighter rider has less skill? I just don't buy that idea. Can
you even begin to offer a rational explanation about why you think riders in the 125
/ 250 classes have less desire or raw ability? I think that's an absurd statement.

As for de Angelis' talent, skill and potential levels, how would you know? You
don't pay attention to the races he's in or has has been in. Spies, to me, is
probably more accomplished than Hayden was when he went over to MGP. At least, he
seems to be, even though he's really only had one consistent competitor for the last
two years.

&gt; &gt;&gt; What I have said is the best of them from a results standpoint have only
&gt; &gt;&gt; proven to be the best given the playing field - riders sourced from a
&gt; &gt;&gt; limited pool, JIS riders given team/bike preferences within that pool, very
&gt; &gt;&gt; small size and light weight being an obviously material consideration in
&gt; &gt;&gt; their success (is there even one rider at 150 pounds or more of any
&gt; &gt;&gt; consequence in 125 or 250 today?).

&gt; &gt;    Judging by many of your comments over the years and those above, even the
&gt; &gt; best of the 125/250 promotees just aren't up to snuff. And when one does
&gt; &gt; actually do well, you can come up with a bunch of reasons why that rider
&gt; &gt; didn't suck like you think he should. Rossi - &quot;best bike, best wrench, Dorna
&gt; &gt; wants him to win. etc.&quot; Stoner - &quot;landed in clover&quot; (always after me Lucky
&gt; &gt; Charms!).

&gt; You won't find me saying Stoner has been in the favored class, that's
&gt; for sure, he's had to fight to get where he is. But you'll never
&gt; convince me that the Ducati/Bridgestone combination has turned out to be
&gt; anything but the perfect combination for him, and is quite likely the
&gt; best package in the series overall. And he only got that ride because
&gt; Gresini exercised his option on Melandri and Hayden turned them down,
&gt; it's not like from the start Ducati recognized Stoner as the best rider
&gt; in the series last year.

I didn't say that you think that Stoner was part of the &quot;favored class&quot;, I said
that you have implied that he hasn't sucked like the rest of the guys who are from
the &quot;undesirable&quot; bunch. You even did it just there, too. Whether Ducati recognized
him as *the* best rider or not is immaterial - they recognized him as one of the few
guys they felt they could get good results out of. As it turned out, they were
correct. The fact that the bike (and tires) suit his style and he works well with his
team is one of those fortunate things that happens in racing sometimes.

&gt; As for Rossi, I find it amusing that there's been all this talk of a
&gt; control tire now that Bridgestone riders are pushing past Michelin men
&gt; like Rossi and Pedrosa, all these claims of tires deciding races and how
&gt; that's ruining the series. Many also are saying that Michelin has fallen
&gt; behind because they were so reliant on their &quot;Saturday Night Specials&quot;
&gt; arriving at the track on race day. But who got those tires? Not Stoner
&gt; last year, according to him. So to what extent did tires decide the
&gt; races in the old days when Michelin totally dominated, and who benefited
&gt; from that? I don't recall a lot of people talking about that when Rossi
&gt; ruled supreme. Well, I guess I was...

&gt; So now we see a non-European rider dominated like no other since Doohan
&gt; in the last century, we see Stoner, Vermeulen and Hopkins regularly
&gt; winning races and on podiums, we see Rossi and Pedrosa truly struggling,
&gt; and we see a French tire manufacturer complaining about edge the rules
&gt; give to a Japanese one. You don't think any of that makes a difference?
&gt;   I think it does.

That's a lot of words addressing a point that I didn't pose. I do find it amusing

&gt; &gt; By the way, it's interesting to see how Kevin Schwantz rates the current

&gt; That's barely a summary of what he said in some Spanish publication, and
&gt; it really doesn't explain on what basis he rated them. West equal to
&gt; Rossi? Guintoli ahead of Hayden? Roberts way down at the bottom? There's

I'd say it isn't interesting to you precisely because of what he *did* say. I
think it's interesting because I think he's looking at the riders from the same
perspective as team owners or directors would. He's looking at who works hard from
the minute they arrive at the track, who gives good feedback to his crew and can help
dial the bike in. Who makes good decisions in the race annd gets the most out of his
equipment. Who shows good racecraft. Those would be good points to start from.

&gt;&gt; bike not suiting his size, there's nothing special about the 212 in that
&gt;&gt; regard. But it remains a fact that the world champion, a rider already
&gt;&gt; employed by Honda and having tested the new bike immediately after the
&gt;&gt; 2006 season, was still waiting for parts to allow him to come in out of
&gt;&gt; the breeze well into the 2007 season. And that's just patchwork,
&gt;&gt; superficial stuff, the fundamental chassis design and weight
&gt;&gt; distribution might well have remained better suited for a smaller rider.
&gt;    &quot;Might well have&quot; - indeed. Do we know this as a fact? No, all that can be done is
&gt; speculate. Yes, Julian had mentioned this early on, but he's not the only person to
&gt; make the observation. I saw some pics of both of their bikes early on and saw the
&gt; different size tank covers and some other differences - I came to that conclusion
&gt; too. As for Hayden's wait for a new bit of bodywork, how unusual is that kind of
&gt; thing with Honda? Mike Hailwood asked them to make him a different frame, they didn't
&gt; so he had one done. They wouldn't let him race it even though it was faster when he
&gt; tested it. So that's nothing new.

A bit of a reach to go back 40 years, isn't it? Of course what I'm
saying about the chassis is speculation, but it's based one what Honda
themselves has said about their development direction, what's obvious
about the bodywork, that Honda has said the bodywork was designed more
with limiting resistance when going side-to-side (which helps a smaller,
weaker rider) than aerodynamic protection at speed (which helps a larger
rider), etc., etc. Regarding tank size, it makes sense to alter that
depending on rider size, especially when the differences are as material
as they are when Dani is involved; that was probably the case last year.
But a world champion having to wait as long as he did to get in from
the breeze, having to resort to public statements about it? That's
hardly typical.

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://groups.google.com/group/rec.motorcycles.racing/msg/2162926435e...
&gt;&gt; That was a conceptual argument, Howard, I was saying that if in order to
&gt;&gt; make it up through 125 and 250 and be successful enough there to get to
&gt;&gt; MotoGP you have to weigh in under 130 pounds (which has been close to
&gt;&gt; the case over the last several years), then you have to be weeding out
&gt;&gt; some rider skill in the process. If riders of an &quot;optimal size&quot;
&gt;&gt; (determined historically on 500s and SBs to be in the 145-165 pound
&gt;&gt; range) have become too large to fit through the eye of that needle, then
&gt;&gt; rider skill is, on average, being reduced. I wasn't saying a rider
&gt;&gt; developing his skills on a 250 ends up being less skilled than one doing
&gt;&gt; so on a 600 or SB, and I wasn't commenting on any particular rider in
&gt;&gt; MotoGP now. Now, do I think, say, de Angelis has more talent and skill
&gt;&gt; and potential than Spies? I seriously doubt it.

&gt;    &quot;A conceptual argument&quot; - I think not. Read a bit more of the linked post. Perhaps
&gt; this must be a bit more &quot;conceptualizing: &quot;Now if you can explain why these midget

&gt; conversation between two imaginary American fans, or the Rossi / &quot;they all died&quot;
&gt; &quot;newsstory&quot; (which was one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen on usenet).
">

Ah, I see you've learned well from Tom's TRUE approach to internet
discussion. Back to the matter at hand, I don't have any doubt at all
that the riders at the front in 250 have shrunk over the years. Looks at
guys like Sarron, Mang, Pons, Lavado, Garriga, Cornu, Roth in the '80s,
or Kocinski, Cadalora, Chili, Biaggi, Okada, Rossi, et al in the '90s.
Harada and Capirossi were definitely little guys, and that may have been
part of what kept Harada out of 500 for years. Biaggi and Criville were
smaller than a lot of guys in 500, but at about 65kg they were still at
the low end of that optimal range. So now we're in a world where the top
guys in 250 are clustered around 55kg, and to me that isn't just a
random occurrence, there's something about being that small and light
that creates an advantage, enough of one that no rider in the 65-70kg
range can make it to the front in 250 today. I do not believe that
natural riding talent has somehow mysteriously shifted heavily or
exclusively to smaller riders, rather there is a basic physical
advantage there that has trumped pure talent. Therefore, on average,
these guys are less talented than the rider pool would be if this didn't
matter so much.

That's what I've been talking about, and I haven't yet seen a reasonable
counter to that. Actually, I don't think I've even seen anyone attempt
one. Instead, like you, people attack the messenger rather than the message.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;    Why do you think a lighter rider has less skill? I just don't buy that idea. Can

I don't KNOW, it's just an opinion and nothing more - again, this is all

Sure it is, I've said that plenty. As for what Ducati thought of him,
they were looking for a younger rider, having had the oldest team in the
series in '06, and they made very visible runs at Hayden and Melandri.
Rossi, Pedrosa, Hopkins, Vermeulen, de Puniet weren't on the market, and
I think Nakano had already signed with his current team. So that left
Stoner, Elias, Tamada, Hofmann? Or go to 250, WSB or some national
championship? Dovisioso seems like the only serious alternative. So
Stoner strikes me as the best of the leftovers, and they didn't even
give him a two-year deal, they gave him one year with a team option on
the 2nd.

By &quot;optimal rider&quot; I assume you're talking about rider size, yes? Okay,
if I say last year's MotoGP champion weighed 150 pounds, that's too
small of a sample, obviously. If I add that the guy who won the previous
five championships weighs 148 pounds, and the current AMA and WSB
champions weigh 160 and 148 pounds, and the WSB champion-elect weighs
165 pounds, that's still not enough. But when I go back 20-25 years and
say all champions in these series weighed between 145 and 165 pounds,
then my evidence is too archaic? Well, okay...

Not typical, but hardly uncommon with Honda. The minimal bodywork may indeed help
&quot;smaller, weaker&quot; riders but it sure doesn't hurt bigger riders. I think a certain
amount of that concept revolves (so to speak) around Honda's &quot;Mass Centralization&quot;
concept. Weight transfer can be reduced because of MC, hence making the bike easier
to tip in would be a plus. As for the excessively small front protection, I think
Honda just underestimated the gains they thought they'd get from a seemingly more
maneuverable bike. I think they expected to gain more in the twisty bits than on the
straights. Ducati, unfortunately, spoiled that plan.

&gt; smaller than a lot of guys in 500, but at about 65kg they were still at
&gt; the low end of that optimal range. So now we're in a world where the top
&gt; guys in 250 are clustered around 55kg, and to me that isn't just a
&gt; random occurrence, there's something about being that small and light
&gt; that creates an advantage, enough of one that no rider in the 65-70kg
&gt; range can make it to the front in 250 today. I do not believe that
&gt; natural riding talent has somehow mysteriously shifted heavily or
&gt; exclusively to smaller riders, rather there is a basic physical
&gt; advantage there that has trumped pure talent. Therefore, on average,
&gt; these guys are less talented than the rider pool would be if this didn't

">

Two points to note here. Burgess commented on the Hondas that it looked
like they had their (centralised) mass too high. This caused too much
pitching as the riders got on the brakes making it hard to control and
out brake people. This would explain Dani's braking problems in
particular early in the year. The latest frame seems to have helped this
as both Dani and Nicky have been much better on corner entry in recent
races.

The other point is about fairings. Ducati had some problems earlier with
changes of direction and side winds. Much wind tunnel work led to subtle
changes that have resolved that. They've managed to get the best of both
worlds of good streamlining without too much downside from an aero
design that just wants to go straight.[1]

Which just suggests that Honda tried to have too much of a good thing
initially following their design route. But R&amp;D has now largely solved
the problems that brought.

[1] The Ducati Desmosedici launch showed the bike next to last year's
race bike. Funny to see a bigger screen and bigger fairing on the race
bike. I guess one is designed to work at circuits and the other to look
good on a stand in the sitting room.

Oh, bullshit. Hayden was having serious top speed problems early in the

And Suzuki and Kawasaki...

You can dance all you want on that point, but the reality was that the
advantages that design had favored Pedrosa and the disadvantages worked
against Hayden, on balance. Even if that wasn't the result of an intent
specific to these two riders, it still appears to be the result of their
chosen &quot;compact riders/compact bikes&quot; direction, which is built around
riders like Pedorsa. And I would argue that it IS built around Pedrosa,
as Honda came up with all of this when they had Pedrosa being groomed in
250 and it was clear that all 250 riders were shrinking in size.

Yes, basically. I just have an issue with a class/series where in order
to be a top rider you apparently have to weight 125 pounds or less. That
doesn't mean those guys aren't very talented. And you almost have to be
either Spanish or Italian as well, and that doesn't mean talented racers
don't come from those countries. But I still have major issues with that

&gt;&gt; Back to the matter at hand, I don't have any doubt at all

team owners have in choosing riders to promote: familiarity. Not the riders
familiarity with the tracks (which is a factor, as I've stated) but the owners
familiarity with the rider. Seeing what he does every week at the track.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Funny that you choose to cite accomplishments of Pedrosa's from his
&gt; first year when I'm talking about what these guys do in the longer run,
&gt; my argument being that familiarity gives them a leg up initially but
&gt; then they don't have quite the talent/drive/whatever to continue to
&gt; improve. The Biaggi Syndrome, or the Cadalora Syndrome, or the Checa
&gt; Syndrome, or... Hard to say on Pedrosa at this point because Honda and
&gt; Michelin have gotten it so wrong this year, he might still turn out to
&gt; be a great one.

Well, what other stats on Pedrosa *could* I cite, besides his first year? The
point was that you were leading the charge on saying he was too small and too much of
a weakling to handle the 990s. He obviously could. This year is a hard one to judge
for the reasons you state.

Based on the talk from you, Pedrosa the midget weakling shouldn't have been able
to ride the bike at all, let alone have any success. &quot;Best bike in the paddock&quot; - he

&gt; &gt;   Not typical, but hardly uncommon with Honda. The minimal bodywork
&gt; &gt; may indeed help &quot;smaller, weaker&quot; riders but it sure doesn't hurt bigger
&gt; &gt; riders. I think a certain amount of that concept revolves (so to speak)
&gt; &gt; around Honda's &quot;Mass Centralization&quot; concept. Weight transfer can be reduced
&gt; &gt; because of MC, hence making the bike easier to tip in would be a plus. As
&gt; &gt; for the excessively small front protection, I think Honda just underestimated
&gt; &gt; the gains they thought they'd get from a seemingly more maneuverable bike. I
&gt; &gt; think they expected to gain more in the twisty bits than on the straights.
&gt; &gt; Ducati, unfortunately, spoiled that plan.

&gt; Two points to note here. Burgess commented on the Hondas that it looked
&gt; like they had their (centralised) mass too high. This caused too much
&gt; pitching as the riders got on the brakes making it hard to control and
&gt; out brake people. This would explain Dani's braking problems in
&gt; particular early in the year. The latest frame seems to have helped this
&gt; as both Dani and Nicky have been much better on corner entry in recent
&gt; races.
">

I'd read (can't recall where, it was a while back) that the Honda had weight
transfer issues but the Burgess comment is a different angle on it. Very interesting
but probably pretty logical.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The other point is about fairings. Ducati had some problems earlier with
&gt; changes of direction and side winds. Much wind tunnel work led to subtle
&gt; changes that have resolved that. They've managed to get the best of both
&gt; worlds of good streamlining without too much downside from an aero
&gt; design that just wants to go straight.[1]
">

Yeah, the Ducatis are not anywhere near as minimal as the Hondas. Especially down
and back by the rear tire - it's distinctly wider and covers more than either the
Honda or the Yamaha. There is more coverage around the handlebar area as well. One
observation: the Honda and Yamaha have more of an angle to the nose area, where the
Ducati is somewhat blunt, rolling back pretty fast, with a distinctly separate
screen. I wonder if the idea is to help direct the wind around the rider, rather than
over him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Which just suggests that Honda tried to have too much of a good thing
&gt; initially following their design route. But R&amp;D has now largely solved
&gt; the problems that brought.

&gt; [1] The Ducati Desmosedici launch showed the bike next to last year's
&gt; race bike. Funny to see a bigger screen and bigger fairing on the race
&gt; bike. I guess one is designed to work at circuits and the other to look
&gt; good on a stand in the sitting room.
">

Many of the aftermarket windscreens that are race-specific are taller than the
stock ones. But a low screen looks racier to the average guy, apparently.

&gt;&gt; Even if that wasn't the result of an intent specific to these two riders, it still
&gt;&gt; appears to be the result of their chosen &quot;compact riders/compact bikes&quot; direction,
&gt;&gt; which is built around riders like Pedorsa. And I would argue that it IS built
&gt;&gt; around Pedrosa, as Honda came up with all of this when they had Pedrosa being
&gt;&gt; groomed in 250 and it was clear that all 250 riders were shrinking in size.

&gt;    Sure, the bike concept was likely arrived at while Pedrosa was in 250s - these
&gt; things take time. But how do we know that they were all that sure he was going to be
&gt; good enough at that time to make it into MGP and succeed and, hence, design a bike
&gt; around him? That seems to be a logical leap that can only be premised on the outcome.
">

So let's look at that. This year's bike contains a lot of concepts
tested on Hayden's bike last year, we all know that. That bike appeared
in a raceable form for the first time in February of last year, was only
ridden by Hayden all year, and there wasn't even a testable prototype in
the fall of '05. The first appearance of that machine in a very early
form and also the talk of compactness came at Brno in August '05. So one
can guess that the beginnings of serious development on that bike
started 6-12 months earlier, maybe even less. Now what was the situation
then? Rossi had just beaten Honda on a more nimble Yamaha, and their
factory riders, Barros and Hayden, had gone winless and finished 4th and
8th in points. Hayden would be back, but Biaggi was brought in as not
much  more than another stop gap measure, and in fact would finish a
winless 5th in '05.

But in 250 Pedrosa had won Honda only it's 3rd championship in 12 years,
and in his first year in class. And he didn't just win, he dominated.
And other tiny young guys like Elias, de Angelis and Aoyama were running
at the front, while Dovisioso won in 125 and Barbera, Lorenzo, and
Stoner joined him in the top five. Their previous 250 champion, Katoh in
2001, was also a very small guy, but he'd had his MotoGP career
tragically cut short. Their 250 was already a very small bike by '04,
smaller than the Aprilia. And I'm sure Puig was playing up Pedrosa to
whomever at Honda would listen, and Honda team sponsors Repsol and
Telefonica must have been salivating. And of course Honda knew what it
took to ride their bike, much more than anyone in this group did.

Considering all this, I don't think it's much of a leap at all to
suggest this direction was built on Pedrosa and the other junior minis
coming up in 125 and 250 at that time. The only thing the screwed it up
was Hayden winning the championship, that obviously wasn't part of the plan.

&gt;&gt; I just have an issue with a class/series where in order

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; to be a top rider you apparently have to weight 125 pounds or less. That
&gt;&gt; doesn't mean those guys aren't very talented. And you almost have to be
&gt;&gt; either Spanish or Italian as well, and that doesn't mean talented racers
&gt;&gt; don't come from those countries. But I still have major issues with that
&gt;&gt; kind of class is what is supposedly a world championship. Now if we
&gt;&gt; concede that it's really just a EuroMed championship for children and
&gt;&gt; near-dwarves, then fine...

&gt;    Another good example of your trivialization of those riders.
">

I guess if you choose to ignore what I'm actually saying, which is also
a good way to avoid the issue...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;    The logical fallacy here is to presume that they can't have *both* size
&gt;&gt;&gt; and talent. That's your mistake. All you see is the size part of the equation.
&gt;&gt; Again, I have never said 250 riders don't have talent, what I am saying
&gt;&gt; is when a filter on the main path to MotoGP apparently weeds out almost
&gt;&gt; any rider over 60kg it does or eventually will weed out some riding
&gt;&gt; talent along with weight. It just strikes me as inevitable.

&gt;    Mark, you frequently say negative or, at best, condescending things about the
&gt; talent and skill of 250 riders, such as referring to them as &quot;less-capable.&quot;
">

Look, I think GP's top support class could have better riders in it and
send better riders to MotoGP, if the bikes they used didn't reward small
size and light weight as much as they obviously do and if the top teams
could actually see beyond the shores of the Mediterranean. Negative? Of
course, when talking of them as a group, and I think justified.
Condescending? Howard, it's a news group, I'm not writing for the New

&gt;&gt; When I said &quot;more desire, skill and raw ability&quot; I was talking about
&gt;&gt; relativity to larger riders who they apparently have been selected over
&gt;&gt; for the top seats in 250. If a 120-pound guy gets a factory Aprilia or
&gt;&gt; Honda and a 150-pound guy doesn't, it should be because the first guy
&gt;&gt; has superior talent, desire, etc. But I don't think it is, rather it's
&gt;&gt; about size. I think the guys making hiring decisions are looking for the
&gt;&gt; best guys who are small enough to win on those bikes and not just the
&gt;&gt; best guys, although I think part of the process is that they are mostly
&gt;&gt; selecting from the guys who have done well in 125, and that class has an
&gt;&gt; even stronger connection to size, it seems.

&gt;    Hmm, I would say the guys looking to hire riders *are* pretty likely to take skill
&gt; desire and raw ability into consideration. If you don't have those, then you're not
&gt; likely to get very far, no? I seriously doubt that the first thing a team owner would
&gt; consider is the size of a prospective rider. I'm not saying they *don't* consider it,
&gt; rather it is not the first priority, as you believe. You're saying that you believe
&gt; that team owners have concluded that they could stick anyone small enough who's nuts
&gt; enough to crank the throttle open on the bike and succeed.
">

Now that's an obvious exaggeration. I don't see how you could know how I
balance talent vs. size vs. nationality in 250, and I don't feel that I
need to qualify every comment I make in this area with something like,
&quot;Now that doesn't mean these guys aren't extremely talented. They are
extremely talented. They just aren't as extremely talented as they could
be otherwise.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; What I was getting down to is who was left once Melandri got taken away
&gt;&gt; from them. It's not like selecting Stoner at that point was a ringing
&gt;&gt; endorsement of him, I don't think.

&gt;    I think that he was considered in a crowd like he was is a pretty good endorsement.

And what was that crowd? Was it Hayden, Melandri and perhaps Dovisioso?
Or was it Elias, Tamada and Hofmann?

&gt;&gt; So you don't think Rossi having probably the worst year of his career and the loss

&gt;&gt; think it's the loss of close racing?

&gt;    I think that your idea that Dorna thought the greatest thing that could happen
&gt; would be a Rossi v. Pedrosa battle is based on your anti-European slant.

I seem to recall nutless Nick on the MotoGP broadcast, a guy paid by
Dorna, saying in France last year, when those two battled head-to-head
on track for the first time, &quot;This is the battle we've all been waiting
for!&quot;. From Dorna's view back in Spain, knowing where their fan base
lies, with Biaggi and Gibernau beaten and broken as Rossi rivals, this
was not only the best thing that could happen, it was their fucking wet
dream.

&gt; I would

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; think that Dorna would want a Rossi (simply because he has been consistently the
&gt; best) v. whoever battle, and if that didn't arise, then some battle that involved
&gt; riders in close competition. The race fans I know certainly have favorite
&gt; riders/drivers, but they tend to be happy when points races are close.

If so, my guess is the people you know are likely a bit different than
most of the people who populate those hillsides in Europe at the GPs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It's a balance, I don't think it's nearly black and white. But if
&gt;&gt; nationality and familiarity didn't matter at all in hiring MotoGP riders

&gt;&gt; year. If true, that means someone isn't getting a ride because he is.

No argument there, but ignorance and stupidity is no excuse. So what do
Pons, Gresini, D'Antin, Poncharal, Cecchinello, et al, have in common?
They all made their bones in the smaller classes, that's what, as riders
and/or team managers. And that's where they look, to the near-exclusion
of everywhere else. But not WCM while they lasted, or Suzuki, where the
people running the show aren't so inwardly focused. And somehow the team
managers in the AMA have managed to bring in guys like Corser, Magee,
Mladin, the Goberts, Bayliss, Buckmaster, Attard, Craggill, Hodgson,
Ellison, Davies, Cardenas, Scassa and others, almost none if any of them
forced on them by foreign OEMs.  So what you're saying is GP is
inherently myopic and provincial. Okay, I can accept that. I mean, we
certainly see it from their beat writers.
