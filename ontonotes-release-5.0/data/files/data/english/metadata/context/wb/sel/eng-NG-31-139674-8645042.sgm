Opening 2C with &quot;nothing&quot; in hand is a psych.  Don't know where you are
from, but if your bridge organization allows psyching of strong artificial
openers, then there is nothing wrong with that [unless the partners do it
all the time, or often enough so that the opener's partner suspects psych
and does not bid normally].

It is against ACBL rules to psych a strong artificial 2C bid
according to Max Hardy. The minimum you can have is

AKQxxx
JT9876
x

according to the example in his book Advanced 21st Century... Vol. 2

Max Hardy is not a definitive source for what is and is not legal. :-)

According to Rick Beye, who *is* a definitive source (he's the ACBL's
Chief TD), the current ACBL position is that if a player considers a
hand to be &quot;strong&quot; (note that &quot;strong&quot; is not defined anywhere in the
laws or in ACBL regulations), then a 2C opening on that hand is not a
psych. I once held AKQJxxx Jxx - Jx. *I* didn't open it 2C (I wouldn't
have, but in fact my RHO opened 2D), but the opponent at the other
table did so (my teammate in first seat didn't like her diamond suit -
AQxxxx - so she passed). The bidding went 2C-2D-4S-AP, and our
teammates misdefended, not expecting this hand type for a 2C opener.
TD let the result stand. :-(

All that said, the original poster may not be in the ACBL - in which
case ACBL regulations are irrelevant.

I stated that Hardy was stating the rule, not interpreting it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Max Hardy asserted he was reporting from an authoritative ACBL source:

'Bear in mind that the ACBL has a regulation which prohibits the
psychic use of the opening bid of two clubs. A definitive article
which was published in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; (the official organ of the ACBL)
states, &quot;Opening a strong two-bid (artificial and forcing) without
the requisite high card values is acceptable under the following
circumstances: *if, in the view of the opening bidder there is a
reasonable chance for game in hand with little help from partner*.&quot;
The article then presents two acceptable hands.

AKQT98
JT9876
4
- [end of quote]

SH: I don't know the other hand. Your example hand wouldn't meet
that criteria as it has 5 losers, needs about 5 points and the hand
above, about 4 1/2 losers, needs a Q and J, 3 points, however that
would probably be a matter of judgment, how close the opener's hand
came to their example hands which are intended to set a standard
which measures &quot;strong&quot;.

The book was written in 2002, maybe the ACBL position has changed,
and the &quot;The Bulletin&quot; may be their organ, but not constitute a law,
yet still qualify as an official view.

&quot;Cheating&quot; is giving unauthorized information to one partner and the

A psych made on a bust cannot be cheating unless partner somehow gave

You have an odd concept of cheating.  Webster defines it as &quot;violating
rules&quot;, regardless of whether you gain an advantage, but cheats _often_
take a risk.  Consider what it can cost you to be caught plagiarizing in
any university these days.  Psyching a 2C bid may cost you if partner
believes it's genuine - but it's even more likely to cost if partner
doesn't, because then it likely isn't a psych even in places that allow
psyching a 2C bid.

(Which &quot;Webster&quot; is that?  Violating rules *accidentally* is not cheating.

Already mentioned by Derek.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If partner is not in on your opening 2C bid on nothing, how can you be
&gt; cheating?
">

Because it can be against the rules (for example, in the ACBL it is).

Consider another example.  At trick 10 you realize you don't remember
which card you won the opening lead with, so you say &quot;Hey, look at that!&quot;
and while everyone's head is turned up you peek at your played card from
trick 1.  Not only does your partner have no idea of what just happened,
she's the dummy and wouldn't be able to help you if she did.  Did you
cheat?  Of course you did.

Another example, and one that (according to the authorities who expelled
a player for it) has really happened: you bring a deck of cards stacked
with a prepared deal, and surreptitiously swap it for the one that was
in the board.  Partner has no idea what has happened, but you know what's
in everyone's hand.  That's cheating too.

It can if the rules in your area explicitly prohibit psyching a strong,

I do not understand this discussion. It seems to be that Eric is saying it
is OK to open 2C on nothing if your partner has no special reason to think
that you would do so and your local SO does not prohibit it. This seems to
be true.

You are saying that if partner has a reason to think you might bid it on
nothing, this is a special agreement and not informing the opponents is
cheating (I would say it is breaking the rules. Knowing you should tell the
opponents and not doing so would be cheating.) Also some SOs prohibit this
type of Psych so there it would also be cheating.( My previous
parenthetical applies). This also seems to be true. We can quibble about
the difference between breaking the rules and cheating some other time.

So you seem to be in agreement in part and discussing different situations
on the rest.

&gt;It is against ACBL rules to psych a strong artificial 2C bid

Even in the ACBL it would not be cheating.  It would be dealt with
because it is against the rules.

A psyche.  It is legal.  One of the disadvantages of self-explanations
which is normal on the internet is that while it is perfectly legal to

Very few people in the ACBL would psyche 2C, knowing it was illegal,
knowing it was a clear psyche, and hoping to get away with it.

It is outstandingly likely that if someone in the ACBL psyches 2C then
either they were unaware of the rule or they thought their particular
hand did not count under the rules, so they are not cheating.

I must have missed that. Or I have a different definition of &quot;expressly&quot;.
I have not seen him say anything like this. He did say:

I guess you could argue that just trying to give partner the information
is also cheating. I would agree. I do not see anything that says he
thinks that this is the only way to cheat. Perhaps you could say that he
has IMPLIED that trying to communicate the info is not cheating. I would
rather say that he has left his view on that ambiguous.

At least in this thread and to my knowledge, he has not explicitly stated
that both partners need to be involved.

But feel free to continue beating this issue to death. If you enjoy it,

&gt;we're talking about.)
">

You might be.  But Eric isn't. Don't you even read what he wrote?
Sheesh.  Eric only addressed the circumstance where the OP opened 2C,
as a psyche, where OP's partner had no idea it was a psyche, where
OP's opps asked what 2C meant and where OP indicated that it was
&quot;strong&quot;.  There is no potential cheating in this description.

Either the psyche is against the SO's rules, or it isn't.

But it is not, under any circumstances, cheating.

What Eric was saying is that if the bid in question is not known to
the OP's partner, it can not, by definition, be cheating.  This comes
with the presumption that OP is ignorant of any rule that might
otherwise preclude the bid.

GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT.

&gt; Max Hardy is not a definitive source for what is and is not legal. :-)

&gt; According to Rick Beye, who *is* a definitive source (he's the ACBL's
&gt; Chief TD), the current ACBL position is that if a player considers a
&gt; hand to be &quot;strong&quot; (note that &quot;strong&quot; is not defined anywhere in the
&gt; laws or in ACBL regulations), then a 2C opening on that hand is not a
&gt; psych. I once held AKQJxxx Jxx - Jx. *I* didn't open it 2C (I wouldn't
&gt; have, but in fact my RHO opened 2D), but the opponent at the other
&gt; table did so (my teammate in first seat didn't like her diamond suit -
&gt; AQxxxx - so she passed). The bidding went 2C-2D-4S-AP, and our
&gt; teammates misdefended, not expecting this hand type for a 2C opener.
&gt; TD let the result stand. :-(

&gt; All that said, the original poster may not be in the ACBL - in which
&gt; case ACBL regulations are irrelevant.
">

1) The WBF definition of &quot;Strong&quot; (which should be the ACBL definition
unless it decides diferently) is &quot;Always a King or more above average
strength&quot;.

2) It's only illegal in the ACBL to psyche an ariticficial STRONG
opener. As far I know, it is perfectly legal to psyche an artifical 2C
that shows a three-suiter

3) Gary Blaise who was ACBL CTD at the time, indicated in answering my
inquiry about a particular use of a 2C opener that &quot;the term 'strong'
was intentionally not tied to a specific number of high card points in
some cases because shapely hands are considered 'strong' by some
players. I don't think that anyone could disagree that 15 HCP is
'strong'&quot;

4) In ACBL tournaments, if you just put &quot;22+&quot; in the Opening 2C
section, you can expect to be penalized for psyching the strong
artificial opener, if you regularly open with 17 or 18. This is more
important in tournaments than in club games. Information on your
convention card about non-alertable bids is considered to be
&quot;disclosed&quot;. If you regularly include wild distributions in your
strong frocing opener the phrase &quot;UNB NonDef OK&quot; or &quot;Light w/ Wild
Dist&quot; (or whatever your agreement really is) will win you the
argument, if the director is called.

In the ACBL, I don't think it is cheating since you are sure to be
caught, sure to get at best an average minus[0 for you ave+ for opps is

What is cheating does not depend on whether you are likely to get
caught - and your &quot;you are sure to&quot; is very naive!

CHEATING is DELIBERATELY and KNOWLEDGEABLY and DEFINITELY taking a
SERIOUS illegal action for the BENEFIT of yourself.

Opening a psychic 2C is quite possibly not knowledgeable, since people
who do it are quite likely not to know that it is illegal or that the
current hand qualifies; quite possibly not definite, since people who do
it are quite likely to do it on a borderline hand; and certainly not
serious, since no way is it in the class of marking cards or giving
finger signals to partner - see the ACBL National TD's response above.

Scotland has adopted the WBF alerting policy as of last Saturday

I am introducing them to my local club this evening and we'll see how

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Cheating&quot; is giving unauthorized information to one partner and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other partner acts on that information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A psych made on a bust cannot be cheating unless partner somehow gave

&gt;&gt;&gt;No, &quot;cheating&quot; is violating the rules to gain an advantage.  In the ACBL,
&gt;&gt;&gt;psyching a 2C bid _would_ be cheating.  In Italy, maybe not.

&gt;&gt;    Cheating is DELIBERATELY and KNOWLEDGEABLY breaking the rules
&gt;&gt; SERIOUSLY for your side's BENEFIT.

&gt;No, it isn't.  As Mark said, cheating is defined as &quot;violating rules
&gt;dishonestly&quot;.  &quot;SERIOUSLY&quot;, either in upper or lower case, isn't a
&gt;requirement.  &quot;Dishonestly&quot; certainly implies knowledge.

No, that's wrong.  If you pick up the bidding cards at the end of the
auction instead of passing, you are breaking the rules.  But it is not
serious, and it is not cheating.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;    Very few people in the ACBL would psyche 2C, knowing it was illegal,
&gt;&gt; knowing it was a clear psyche, and hoping to get away with it.

&gt;Excuse me?  This is exactly the scenario the OP posited.  The only
&gt;difference being that he isn't IN the ACBL.  It's a HYPOTHETICAL situation.

Yes, exactly: you should try reading what is written.

&gt; &gt;1) The WBF definition of &quot;Strong&quot; (which should be the ACBL definition
&gt; &gt;unless it decides diferently) is &quot;Always a King or more above average
&gt; &gt;strength&quot;.

&gt;    Why should it be hte ACBL definition?  Regulations are a matter for
&gt; the SO, and there is no 'default' provided by the WBF, nor any reason
&gt; why there should be.

&gt;    Scotland is considering adopting WBF alerting regs, which I think
&gt; unfortunate.  All WBF regs are based on the principle that the players
&gt; to which they apply are highly experienced, and on average above
&gt; national tournament players in standard.  That is reasonable because
&gt; those are the only tournaments that the WBF runs.  But they are not
&gt; suitable nor designed for club players.

&gt; &gt;4) In ACBL tournaments, if you just put &quot;22+&quot; in the Opening 2C
&gt; &gt;section, you can expect to be penalized for psyching the strong
&gt; &gt;artificial opener, if you regularly open with 17 or 18. This is more
&gt; &gt;important in tournaments than in club games. Information on your
&gt; &gt;convention card about non-alertable bids is considered to be
&gt; &gt;&quot;disclosed&quot;. If you regularly include wild distributions in your
&gt; &gt;strong frocing opener the phrase &quot;UNB NonDef OK&quot; or &quot;Light w/ Wild
&gt; &gt;Dist&quot; (or whatever your agreement really is) will win you the
&gt; &gt;argument, if the director is called.

&gt;    I think tournament players are less likely, not more likely, to think
&gt; points prove everything.

I agree with you about tournament players, so it is obvious that you
don't understand my point (whether you agree with it or not).

My point about #4 is that tournament directors in the western US (and
presumably they get their direction from Memphis) assume that people
have looked at opponents convention cards. All of the following, for
instance, are generally not alertable but should properly be disclosed
on your convention card:

1) Bailey cue bids
2) Weak 2 tendancies (other than 2C)
3) Strong 2C tendancies
4) Balancing 1NT range
5) Off shape take out doubles
6) Carding Agreements (other than low from a doubleton)
7) Natural overcall strategies over preempts
8) Negative implications resulting from 1NT opener strength.

&gt;&gt; I stated that Hardy was stating the rule, not interpreting it.

&gt; Either way, I stand by my statement above.

You write that as if my remark challenges your position. My statement
means Hardy was using a source which should certainly serve as a
guideline for ACBL policies. When a rules article is included in
&quot;The Bulletin&quot; a reader can rightfully conclude that the article
reflects ACBL policy. That is a normal view to take for a readership.

As Gerben42 pointed out, if this was an individual's pov and *not*
indicative of an officially backed guideline for its membership,
then the Editor should have very clearly stated that. I didn't read
the article in the original, but I would lay 3 to 1 than Hardy would
not use this article for a basis to describe the bottom limit to a
strong artificial 2C bid, if that same article contained a disclaimer
by the Editor warning against using the examples as guidelines.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Max Hardy asserted he was reporting from an authoritative ACBL source:

&gt; [snip]

&gt;&gt; The book was written in 2002, maybe the ACBL position has changed,
&gt;&gt; and the &quot;The Bulletin&quot; may be their organ, but not constitute a law,
&gt;&gt; yet still qualify as an official view.

&gt; I don't think the ACBL's position on this question has changed
&gt; significantly in recent years. I could be wrong. :-)

&gt; I don't believe even the ACBL claims that the Bulletin is a definitive
&gt; source for laws interpretations.
">

The word &quot;definitive&quot; is introduced again. The phrase &quot;but not
constitute a law&quot; covers &quot;definitive&quot; IMO. But the laws do not
and cannot equitably cover all situations which require rulings.
So an interpretation of their intent is required.

Hardy is faced with the difficult task of providing a guideline to
his readers for a minimum 2C bid. Since the laws are not specific
enough to describe the requirements, then identifying his source
is sufficient to substantiate his exposition. Hardy perceives, and
most of the ACBL membership are going to rightfully perceive that
article in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; as an ACBL sanctioned guideline for the
interpetation of the rule(s), if there is no disclaimer added.
&quot;The Bulletin&quot;, not minutes from TD meetings are the public record.

So if some pair which had read this article, and filled out their
cc as 'strong 2C=22+ balanced, with less HCP needed for imbalanced'
and a hand arose which was very similar to AKQT98 JT9876 x -
then I think it would be any TD's duty to rule this as a legitimate
2C opener if the opps felt their rights had been violated, especially
if the TD was aware of the article in ACBL organ. Bridge needs as
uniform enforcement of procedures as possible, and no TD should act
as a big frog in a small pond in order to arbitrarily circumvent them
based on his/her personal preferences. TDs are not definitive either,
if their rulings contradict known rules or policies, a common complaint.

The ACBL itself is remiss if it allows specious article to appear
in its magazine without a disclaimer, when it knows that the public
membership of ACBL is going to look to that publication to clarify
existing rules and inform of new rules and changes in rules.

&quot;Max Hardy is not a definitive source for what is and is not legal.&quot;

SH: I was surprised at your remark, as my focus was on the hands
and not on the rules, nor actually Hardy's legal qualifications,
but I like to identify my sources. So your response focuses on an
issue, which I can understand is important to you, was actually
passed over, I didn't make the above claim but I can see how you
might have thought so. That is why I replied with what Hardy actually
wrote including the source of his opinion/information. I vouched
for my reference origin, and though I didn't say it, that Hardy's
use of that Bulletin article was an excellent and perhaps only venue
of officially tied interpretation of the laws pertaining to strong 2C
bids. Hardy wanted to provide his reader's with a minimum example.

Ed:
&quot;According to Rick Beye, who *is* a definitive source (he's the ACBL's
Chief TD), the current ACBL position is that if a player considers a
hand to be &quot;strong&quot; (note that &quot;strong&quot; is not defined anywhere in the
laws or in ACBL regulations), then a 2C opening on that hand is not a
psych. I once held AKQJxxx Jxx - Jx.&quot;

SH: Granted he is an expert on ACBL laws. But if &quot;strong&quot; 'is not
defined anywhere' then there is no &quot;definitive&quot; requirements to
the 2C bid itself and thus Rick is not a definitive source on
the requirements for the bid itself, since &quot;strong&quot; is defined
ambiguously, the opposite meaning of &quot;definitive&quot;. There is no
claim made that Hardy is an ACBL bridge legal expert, definitive
or otherwise. There is no claim that the ACBL organ, &quot;The Bulletin&quot;
is a definitive source: &gt; &quot;I don't believe even the ACBL claims
that the Bulletin is a definitive source for laws interpretations.&quot;

SH: I don't believe so either which is why I wrote
&quot;The Bulletin&quot; may be their organ, but not constitute a law...&quot;

You replied as if I disagreed with you. I think the Bulletin
should offer officially sanctioned guidelines to applying
hand requirements to actual listed hands, or contain a disclaimer.
I see nothing in which I wrote indicating that Hardy thought the
Bulletin article was more than suggested guidelines, certainly
nothing so definitive as laws. Maybe you see something in that
quote which suggests that Hardy thinks the reader should consider
the article as a supplement to the laws and/or regulations?

Now, I am thinking you contrived to use this topic to vent your
disapproval of Hardy and &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, not to what I wrote.
The introduction of &quot;definitive&quot; is called a strawman argument.

Finally, if AKQJxxx Jxx - Jx is allowed as 2C opener then I
think Rick should use his influence to correct that Bulletin
article as to what serves as guideline hands. I think that is
a vul 4H opener and non-vul, 1 heart opener. I would call the
TD since although it is quite likely to come to 8 tricks it
is too short in strength to make up for the quick trick lack.

Sorry, but I can't help but to equivocate, it was part of my training,
Stephen
