&quot;king of new york&quot; is still the dopest gangsta movie of all time...

followed closely by &quot;menace to society&quot; which is still shitting all
over &quot;boyz in the hood&quot;... boyz is easily the most overrated piece
of dung to ever hit the screen... i dont know if john singleton has
ever made a movie worth watching...

Both the movies you don't like spawned the other. I actually feel the
opposite of you as &quot;King Of New York&quot; wasn't all that good to me and
&quot;Menace II Society&quot;, while it was good, didn't show the father/son
dynamic in black America the way &quot;Boyz In The 'Hood&quot; did.

boyz in the hood was garbage... if menace had came out before boyz people
wouldnt have the nerve to say boyz is better...

boyz = sentimental b movie favorite
menace = great film making

king of new york is just straight up grimey shit...
biggie wasnt always spouting frank white for nothing...

Great flick but it's not an epic... Scarface is an epic... It's the
full story of Tony Montana, the rise and the fall... King of NY is
kinda just the fall of Frank White and for that reason it falls short
I guess... Still it has a great cast... Christopher Walken is probably
the weirdest lead gangster ever... It also probably has my favorite
shootout/car chase scene ever with Fishburn, Snipes, Caruso, etc... In
that scene, you really get the feeling that these people hate the SHIT
out of each other and everybody must die... Still it's not an epic...

Technically, Menace shows a different type of father/son dynamic.
It's just not the one that most people prefer to see.  Kane's father
was in the movie.  Samuel L. Jackson played him.  The guy who was in
jail, was also a father figure to Kane.  When Kane got older, he was a
father figure to Jada Pinkett's little boy.  Charles S. Dutton was
also a father figure in the movie.  Notice how in Menace, that having
a good father figure still couldn't save the boy who played Charles S.
Dutton's son.  The circumstances of his death were EXTREMLY realistic
in my opinion......but many people don't like to admit that.

I'm pretty sure that we all realize that not every child grows up in a
&quot;happy&quot; home w/ positive father figures in their lives.  Some children
don't have one at all and some children grow up w/ the wrong type of
man filling that role.  Menace and Boyz are nothing more than two
excellent movies that show  different takes aspects on the same
dynamic.

Menace is easily my all time favourite movie. Boyz N Tha Hood wouldn't get
in the top 100.

Scarface gets in the Top 20 but Good Fellas is the standout Mafioso movie
IMO and gets a place in my top 5 (which are 1. Menace II Society, 2. Fight
Club, 3. Good Fellas, 4. The Usual Suspects and 5. Chopper).

As for King Of New York, I have only seen a small portion of this movie
because the copy from my video shop was very poor quality. I have ordered a
copy now and will see if it is worthy of Bozak's lofty praise...

shot on not even one tenth of the budget of scarface imo it is
clearly epic film making... you mention why it is the best gangsta
flick of all time for me... christopher walken is clearly on some other
shit... is there another gangster film where a white boy rolls with
practically nothing but brothaz??? not to mention he never puts himself
above anybody in his crew... once he becomes the man he is still willing
to go out and do grimey shit just like the rest of his boys...

and as far as it not being epic... this guy disagrees with you as well...
http://www.toxicuniverse.com/review.php?rid=10002637

i almost want to say that king of new york would have been better had
it been made with one tenth of de palma's budget, but then i think to
myself the non glitz of it all works for kony...

from the first time i saw scarface i thought a bunch of scenes were
corny as fuck and way over the top... &quot;say hello to my little friend???&quot;
please, that whole big shoot'em up last scene in the movie didnt
work at all for me...

i think kony was written better, and had a way better cast... not to
mention the worst shit about scarface imo was that giorgio moroder
sounding soundtrack... wtf was that all about... is was on some
american gigolo shit, about 4 years past its prime... if not for the
club scenes with the latin music, the soundtrack to that shit would
have been gay as hell...

is far superior. frank white's character is more elaborate than tony

always be donnie out of big lebowski or the record collector in ghost
world to me.

anybody who's into scarface might want to check out cess silvera's
shottas. and anybody who likes walken in ferrara movies should see the
addiction. not the greatest movie in the world by any means but i do
like walken's performance.

No kidding--make sure you set aside an entire day to watch it.  I saw it
in a revival theater a few years back and some dude fell sound asleep in
the front row.  Snored so loud that someone had to nudge the guy to wake
him up.  A 3:45 long movie will do that to you if you haven't prepared
yourself!

I hope they come out with a BluRay or HD-DVD version that puts it all on
one disc. The problem with the DVD is the 1st disc ends before the
intermission.  The movie flows a bit better if it's uninterrupted until
the intermission.

There was a bare bones KONY on DVD out for a long time--and then a few
years back they put out the deluxe edition (complete with Schooly D
interview).  I've got both of them--I wonder if the BluRay edition has
the same extras?  My prob with the BluRay/HD-DVD stuff is usually they
don't have all the extras DVD editions do. (Yet they charge 2X the price
unless you buy it off of Amazon)

&gt;&gt; uninterrupted until the intermission.

&gt; they did come out with the bluray of KONY this year... which is weird because
&gt; it took forever to come out on dvd... its starting to get a cult like following i
&gt; guess...

&gt; i peeped it a few months ago... i wasn't really feeling it... way too

Shottas was like State Property or Killa Season with better script and
film-making and slightly less awful acting.  Not intended as a knock
because I loved both SP movies and Killa Season, but honestly those
movies had some awful ass acting and some suspect (at best) scripting
and directing

Both SP were straight ass... I'm not sure I've seen a movie as bad as
the 1st one; makes me wonder what the hell decided them to even try
and make a 2nd one (that unsurprisingly ended up being shit too).

Yeah, King of New York was the whackest movie I ever saw!  No wonder it took
me until this past Summer to see it.  Once I did, I realized why I waited.
I would urge everyone else to do themselves a favor and wait too!

bozak says:
&lt;&lt;boyz in the hood was garbage... if menace had came out before boyz
people wouldnt have the nerve to say boyz is better.&gt;&gt;

Disagreed. Since the latter didn't come from the former, you can only
speculate...which you're doing here.

&lt;&lt;boyz = sentimental b movie favorite
menace = great film making
king of new york is just straight up grimey shit... biggie wasnt always
spouting frank white for nothing.&gt;&gt;

Which we don't have enough of...sentiments, that is. And this &quot;great
film making&quot;....what, in a technical sense, plot, lessons learned? What?
Scarface in theme, ending, and film making one of the best movies ever.
And every rapper that's ever been on MTV Cribs has that movie....and
mind you, that ain't for nothing.

mochaspresso believes:
&lt;&lt;Technically, Menace shows a different type of father/son dynamic. It's
just not the one that most people prefer to see. Kane's father was in
the movie. Samuel L. Jackson played him. The guy who was in jail, was
also a father figure to Kane. When Kane got older, he was a father
figure to Jada Pinkett's little boy. Charles S. Dutton was also a father
figure in the movie. Notice how in Menace, that having a good father
figure still couldn't save the boy who played Charles S. Dutton's son.
The circumstances of his death were EXTREMLY realistic in my
opinion......but
many people don't like to admit that.&gt;&gt;

Huh? This is exactly why it's not a great film...technically speaking.
And yes, it's common knowledge in America that that type father/son
dynamic is on display for all to see almost everyday. It may not be
preferred but you see it, 'sho 'nuff. A &quot;father figure&quot; doesn't let &quot;the
little nigga&quot; play with guns as the character told him to do. A &quot;father&quot;
doesn't &quot;turn his son on&quot; to drugs, he steers them from him, as Kane
admits to about his father. A father tries to stay alive so that he can
steer his son away from the pitfalls that Kane ran into...and he did
not. Mr. Butler, as played by Dutton, was a concerned father and his son
did what he did &quot;until he found the Nation&quot;. His demise was on the
father, but in hanging around with a person that did dirty. I'm sure
most parents would say that you're &quot;guilty by association&quot;. Hard words,
but that's exactly what happened there.

&lt;&lt;I'm pretty sure that we all realize that not every child grows up in a
&quot;happy&quot; home w/ positive father figures in their lives. Some children
don't have one at all and some children grow up w/ the wrong type of man
filling that role. Menace and Boyz are nothing more than two excellent
movies that show different takes aspects on the same dynamic.&gt;&gt;

Agreed. Fathers, unfortunately, leave their children to die and this
comes back later on in their lives. Then, you have men that don't act
men dealing with women who have children...not a good look. But I think
the difference being between these movies is, save for Mr. Butler, you
had more negative role models in &quot;Menace II Society&quot; while Furious told
'Tre in &quot;Boyz In The 'Hood&quot;, &quot;you think I'm being hard on you now, but
your friends don't have daddies----and you're going to see how they end
up&quot;. No lines close to that from most of the men in &quot;Menace II Society&quot;.
Way different dynamics.
