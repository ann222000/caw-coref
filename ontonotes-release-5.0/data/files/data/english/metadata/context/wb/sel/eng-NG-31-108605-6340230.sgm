Uh, (story below) isn't New Haven Psycho-DCF the domain
of the DCF crazy floozy AAG Jessica Gauvin?  It's this her
territory now?  Wouldn't releasing this obvious sex creep
back into the world of children be a decision made by the
nutcase Gauvin?

About whose behavior I reported to the US Attorney in New Haven
as well as Morano''s, the Chief State's Attorney, office?
http://www.actionlyme.org/GAUVIN_DEATH_PENALTY.htm

And in whose office (both of them) remains the evidence that
Gauvin had me falsely arrested and charged with Gauvin's own
insane perjury?

I'm a "dangerously intelligent chemist like Ted Kaszynski?"

Ya think?

By the looks of Gauvin, sexually deviant behavior is what
DCF promotes.  The "judges" get all excited too, when Mrs.
Floozy is around.  "Jesse with the Two-Cow Shoes," skin
tight tank tops in late November, and who belongs to the
New Hair Color a Month Club...

It would surprise me not at all if Gauvin was responsible
in this case, since she reeks "SLEAZE."

AAG Jessica Gauvin is SO INSANE, she walked in on
her own son in the bathroom, and then yelled at HER KID,
"NICH-O-LAS!!!"  Like it was the kid's fault Gauvin walked
in on him.

This story she told all the lawyers in the courtroom.

We don't know why that was meant to be a "Aren't
I am amazingly adorable person," story, but nevertheless
she told it.  Imagine having that kind of a nutcase for a
mother.  It's surprising to me, that Gauvin would even
have to walk in on her son, since if you had a look at
Gauvin, you would expect to find she had a separate
house that was a make-up studio, and that she would
have no need for a shared bathroom with her family.

THAT is what she spends her time on.

Surely if this child abuse case took place in New
Haven, Gauvin would have had her hands on it.

Perhaps now everyone will believe me about the CRAZY
DCF.  Maybe now everyone will take a close look at her and
see that *** I have not been exaggerating*** about what a bizarre
creature AAG Jessica Gauvin is.

More Revealed About Miller

Former East Hartford School Principal Was Subject Of New Haven
Complaints

By JIM FARRELL
Courant Staff Writer

March 7 2007

EAST HARTFORD -- Local school officials said Tuesday they were stunned
to learn about further allegations made against a high school
principal they recently hired from New Haven.

A New Haven teacher complained that Kevin Miller, who last week
resigned from his East Hartford job, said that he "would have made a
good Gestapo member because of his ability to control students,"
according to documents obtained by The Courant through the state's
freedom of information law.

Another teacher said Miller suggested that minority students grow to
hate school by fourth grade because they are taught primarily by
"white suburban women."

Miller was given a written warning in September 2005 by the district's
personnel director, who said Miller was guilty of poor judgment but
concluded that the five teachers at the meeting where Miller allegedly
made the comments agreed he said them without malice.

Marion Martinez, the superintendent in East Hartford, said she was
shocked by the revelations.

"No one we spoke to alluded to any of this," she said.

The documents were among 60 pages released Tuesday by New Haven school
officials that included accounts of five investigations conducted by
the state Department of Children and Families following complaints
against Miller.

Earlier reports of those cases prompted the state child advocate and
attorney general to announce on Monday they are expanding an ongoing
investigation into responses by DCF and school administrators to
allegations of improper conduct by educators.

"It's really frightening that all this was there and we didn't know
anything about it," said Hilde Mayranen-O'Brien, chairwoman of the
East Hartford school board.

East Hartford officials say that when they interviewed Miller, privacy
laws prohibited them from asking him questions such as whether he had
been arrested or subject to a DCF investigation.

East Hartford officials also did not seek access to Miller's personnel
file, although all job applicants in East Hartford are required to
make such records available.

Also, Martinez said she called New Haven Superintendent Reginald Mayo
to speak about Miller and left a message but did not receive a call
back.

Catherine Sullivan-DeCarlo, a New Haven schools spokeswoman, said Mayo
did not recall getting such a message.

Sullivan-DeCarlo also said she and Mayo learned that Miller was
leaving New Haven only when they read that he had been hired in East
Hartford.

Asked why New Haven officials did not contact East Hartford officials
about Miller's background, Sullivan-DeCarlo said, "You have to be
careful ... there isn't a lot, legally, you can say."

She noted, for example, that none of the complaints that led to DCF
investigations in New Haven were substantiated, meaning there was no
determination that abuse or neglect occurred.

The New Haven school board accepted Miller's letter of resignation on
Nov. 27. He started work in East Hartford in January but by early
February had been placed on paid administrative leave, after a 15-year-
old girl said Miller made inappropriate comments to her while he was
counseling her about her truancy problems.

Miller, 44, who was earning $118,775 annually, resigned last Friday,
shortly after the East Hartford investigations revealed information
about his troubles in New Haven.

According to an official at the Connecticut Association of Boards of
Education, districts rarely request to see the personnel file of a job
candidate.

"I don't know anyone who does it on a routine basis," said Patrice
McCarthy, the association's deputy director.

According to Miller's personnel file, the DCF investigated him twice
in 2003, while he was principal of Clinton Avenue Elementary School.
Three investigations followed while he was principal of Fair Haven
Middle School.

Complaints included bullying, hitting and making inappropriate
comments to students.

For example, in December 2004, a female student at the middle school
said Miller asked her to meet him at a pizza place and then go to New
York with him. The report concluded that there was no evidence to
support the allegations and said they may have been made out of spite
because the student had been expelled from the school for fighting.

That report, however, referenced allegations of sexual impropriety
that had been made in other investigations of Miller and recommended
that "Miller be removed from the school and a criminal investigation
be done" if more accusations were made.

The complaints by the two teachers followed a meeting about
standardized test scores and student behavior, according to documents.

"The Gestapo comment was in very poor taste," one teacher wrote in her
complaint.

Regarding the comment about why minority children lose enthusiasm for
school, the other teacher wrote, "I could not believe what I heard and
took the comment as a racial slur against me and all white teachers
living outside the city."

The warning letter to Miller said further problems or complaints by
teachers could lead to an immediate suspension.

It's interesting that Yale's Patricia Leebens and Yale's James
Phillips believe torturing children and families who resent
the false allegations as well as the off-the-charts stupidity
of the DCF, and Yale's James Phillips particular stupidity about
Lyme being a brain disease despite being given mountains of
information about how Lyme is a brain disease, don't have the
intellectual capacity to reconcile what's obvious to all of the
rest
of the world, but only now suddenly occurs to the American
Psychiatric Morons Association (article below)?

The CT DCF has so little concern with the mental outcomes
of false separations from parents to prevent malpractice and
other lawsuits, (Lyme is a permanent brain infection, and now
even the common person knows it), that they developed the
DCF-Rowlandgate TREA plan, where they would build a
"national string of prisons and juvenile detention centers"
to further capitalize on the trauma and dementedness that
comes from illegal DCF removals- which are 90% of the removals
(a national and State statistic).

In fact, this DCF scheme to continually reinjure the injured
is the reason John G. Rowland went to jail for 10 months.
They got sloppy about their DCF slutty whoring, drunken
crimes, which ** still threatens ** to ruin reputations in this
state (and I promise you, WILL).

In all honesty, I do not know how people who are as
stupid as James Phillips could possibly earn a degree
in medicine. This tells you the entrance requirements to
medical schools in the US are not based on talent.

This ought to change. They should be required to take an
IQ test before being admitted to any US medical school.

Then again, the Infectious Diseases Society of America
has 8,000 members, the APA has 35,000 members, yet
nowhere on either of their websites is there the statement
about Lyme that is on all the Combined National Institutes of
Health's website:

US has no case for redefining torture: study
AFP
Published: Monday March 5, 2007

Psychological torture, including some of the techniques reportedly
used on Guantanamo Bay detainees, appears to inflict the same kind of
long-term mental damage as physical abuse, a study released Monday
said.

Researchers who evaluated the mental health of soldiers and
civilians tortured during the 1990s Balkan wars found that victims of
psychological abuse were just as likely to suffer from post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and depression as victims of classic physical
torture methods.

The researchers also reported that the torture victims rated some
techniques such as stress positions, isolation, sleep deprivation and
blindfolding as distressing as most physical torture methods.

"Ill treatment during captivity, such as psychological
manipulations, humiliating treatment, and forced stress positions,
does not seem to be substantially different from physical torture in
terms of the severity of mental suffering they cause," the study's
authors wrote.

"Thus, these procedures do amount to torture, thereby lending
support to their prohibition by international law," they wrote in the
journal of the Archives of General Psychiatry.

The investigators said their findings undermine moves by the US
government to narrow its definition of torture in order to free
interrogators to use certain psychological methods aimed at breaking a
prisoner's resistance.

In 2003, lawyers for the US Justice Department and a Pentagon
working group report on detainee interrogations made the case for a
narrow definition of torture that excludes procedures such as
blindfolding and hooding, forced nudity, isolation and other
psychological manipulations.

The Justice Department memorandum argued that the scope of the
term torture should be limited to those acts which could be shown to
result in "prolonged mental harm," according to the study.

The development followed allegations of human rights abuses at US
detention facilities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

However, the authors of this paper said that based on their
analysis of the experiences of torture victims from the modern Balkans
conflict, the US appears to be drawing a distinction without a
difference.

They said their analysis of 279 Bosnian, Croatian and Serb torture
survivors showed that the individuals who suffered psychological abuse
had the same rates of depression, PTSD, and social and work-related
problems as others who had endured beatings, burnings, sexual abuse
and other forms of physical punishment at the hands of their captors.

They suggested that the trauma is the same, because regardless of
the form of aggression, the effect is to create fear or anxiety in the
detainee while at the same time removing any form of control from the
person in order to create a state of total helplessness.

"The distinction between torture and degrading treatment is not
only useless, but also dangerous," said Steven Miles, professor of
bioethics at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in an
accompanying editorial in the journal of the Archives of General
Psychiatry.

The study was written by Metin Basoglu, head of trauma studies at
the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, London, with help from
colleagues at the department of psychiatry at the Clinical Hospital
Zvezdara in Belgrade.
