Things got so messed up that after two hours of hearing 'there are no beds
available' we left.  This was from about 4 pm to 6 pm.  If there wasn't any
beds which one staff person said to there are 4 or 5 beds available from
another, I would have had to stay in ER for the night, and that was out of
the question.  I have been sleeping a lot, drinking a lot and hoping things
stop already.  I plan on giving my GI a piece of my mind tomorrow for
abandoning me there when he said he would take care of me getting into a
room and to just call him before I got there, which I did.  He didn't and he
is the one who told me to go to this hospital immediately for nausea and
vomiting.  I don't plan on returning.  I am going to wait this flare out and
hope it passes, if not I'll see my GI for a scope, but hospital, no way.  UM

Last year when I had my huge flare, it took three trips to the ER before
I was admitted, and THEN my GI couldn't be found to get my records to my
PCP for about four days...I have a new GI now - two of them, in fact.

...on my third trip to the ER, the attending said he'd never seen
someone so anxious to get into the hospital in his life.  It was my
first time, but hell - even I knew that was where I NEEDED to be.  Find
another hospital if you have to, and get the care you need and deserve.
Don't let anyone else let things get worse than they already are.

I know how you feel -- the nurse at UVa did not call me back on Friday
morning after he spoke with a doc like he said he would. I'm worse
today, and don't know how I'll be tomorrow, but this could have all
been avoided (I think!) if he'd got back in touch with me and we could
have come up with some treatment recommendations. He seemed to be
asking a lot about me only having two or three bm's a day -- but I
wasn't in shape to mention the fact that I'm on Methadone and
Darvacet! And that I am having a significant change -- from 1 BM every
day or so that's formed but soft on a regular diet, to 2 or 3 (aleady
done that today) totally liquid on a liquid/low residue diet. And the
bad taste in my mouth that I mentioned to him -- has revealed to me as
a fungus infestation in my mouth and on my lips. I am supposed to go
there this Friday for Remicade, but I don't think that's enough.

Hang in there -- but don't forget, if you really need the care, get ye
to a convent, um, hospital! woman! No, seriously -- you know that this
disease can be dangerous. Don't risk it. I promise you I will not. I
may not want to go to the local ER, but I will if I have to despite
the fact that it's probably full of elderly patients with pneumonia.

And remember that you've got a ton of people out here across the
Internet that care!

Love to all -- especially those of us feeling badly now!

During one problematic trip to the ER they decided to admit me.  There were
no beds.  So they wheeled a comfortable room bed to replace the ER table
into the ER and put me on it.  I would have stayed in the hall way as long
at they took care of me.  But the room must have been available.

I stayed the night and they took care of me. Over 24 hours later they did
find a floor room for me.  It was an easy 24 after the pain meds were on
board.  Boy was I in pain.  I sprung a fistula later that summer IIRC.

Perhaps they could have accommodated you in a similar fashion, if you don't
mind the hallway.

Susan, sorry to hear you're not well and have taken a turn for the
worse. I haven't been around lately due to computer problems;
restoring old one whilst setting up a new one. So haven't been up to
date on anything. This is the second message I've read since coming
back to the group, and I am sorry to hear it. I do hope things improve
for you. I feel like strangling all these hospitals, Dr's, nurses that
treat us all atrociously! I remember when I had my blockage, I went
into ER screaming the place down. They didn't x ray me and I just got
a shot of morphine and things felt better, so they sent me home. Later
on at home, once the morphine wore off I was screaming again. So back
to the ER. Btw, where I lived then was a up a mile off-road track.
Very bumpy! That wasn't fun with a blockage....4 times! Anyway, when I
went back they done an x ray and saw a few blockages through my small
bowel and kept me in.

War stories!

Anyway, keep us all updated on your situation. If we don't hear from
you we'll assume you've been taken in I guess.

Good luck!

I am really sorry thing are going so bad for you right now.
I am also stunned that waiting 2 hours seems a lot to you, and spending
a night in E.R. is not an option. What do I not know about the E.R. in
the US??
Out here waiting 5-6 hours coming in by ambulance is common; waiting up
to 12 hours when coming in on your own is not uncommon. Spending 1 night
in E.R. is very common; then laying in a hallway ( on the proper floor/
department) for another up to a day is not unheard of either.
Have to say, E.R. doc can and do order x-rays, ultrasound, scans, blood
tests etc. so they know if a real emergency exists and treatment is
started if deemed needed. No outside' doc/ specialist can make sure
their patient has a room. Is that different in the US?

Yes, my GI and/or my pulmonary/primary doc should have been able to get me
in ASAP!  The hospital refused to contact either of them because neither are
a family dr.  They told me my numbers were bad with the bloods and the
regular check in stuff.  I has severe vomiting, nausea and so on.  But them
refusing to contact either of my dr's and telling me at 6 PM that there are
no beds for me, there was no sense in me staying there dehydrating more, I
went into the restroom to throw up at least 5 times I think.  Instead my
hubby took me home and put me on soups and liquids and bed rest and about a
week later I finally passed a partial blockage that was causing my problems.
I see my GI on the 24 and will discuss with him what happened and why.  I
will also discuss, again, the partial blockages I get (which he knows
about.)

I am doing better now, though I do have the off days to much to my liking.
This last visit to the hospital was apparently do to my own stupidity,
chocolate covered peanuts, not many but enough not to move through.

I am keeping an eye on things and &quot;behaving&quot; with my diet now.  I have been
able to get out and about more now, even going out with my son on jobs.
Basically, I screwed up.  I have been having problems though with vomiting,
nausea and pain a lot for awhile now, of course off and on.  My GI says it's
common with the damaging scarring I have inside from my resection.  My last
vomiting episode was two days ago, and I felt great in the morning, it
happened in the middle of the night.  I guess blockages are part of my life
for awhile since I am not anywhere ready for another resection to remove the
damaged scarring.

Thanks everyone for your caring.  I really appreciate it and your responses
helped a lot to remind me that you all understand and have been where I am
and even, sorry, some are worse than I.  Thanks, UM MOM Susan

I'm curious, for those on the board in the U.S., what states/cities
are you in? I wonder if the kind of care you eventually end up with
depends on both your GI Joe and whether your particular hospital has
an IBD wing/center? I go to University of Maryland Medical Center and
have varied experiences. UMMC now has an inflammatory bowel disease
center. Prior to a blockage 2 years ago, I suffered the usual trip-by-
ambulance to the E.R. and waited anywhere from 2-10 hours to be
treated, usually being admitted about 16 hours after I came in. Two
years ago, after the bowel center opened, I called my GI Joe's office,
described my symptoms (aside: why does everyone always want to
question us? I bet every single Crohn's patient with frequent
blockages knows their exact symptoms and *knows* when they are truly
blocked), and they pre-admitted me right over the phone. I had a
friend drive me to the hospital and was admitted and on sweet sweet
pain meds within an hour. I wanted to cry from the sheer
unexpectedness of it all. But this past year when the blockages
started again, that didn't happen. I did the usual 50-million-years-
waiting-in-excruciating-pain-in-the-ER thing before seeing a doctor/
getting relief. Thank God I do have a pretty good GI Joe. I'd again
swallowed the pill cam (never again; this is two years in a row the
darned thing got stuck in me) and when I went back to have the
computer harness removed, I was ready to curl up in a corner and just
die, the pain was so bad. The nurse wheeled me over to the hospital
and I was admitted without having to do a thing but lie there and beg
for pain relief, lol.

I just wonder why care is so inconsistent for IBD patients. Do people
not believe us? Think we're simply drug seeking? Or does the type
(rather, vigilance OF) of GI Joe you have and the possibility of an
IBD center in your hospital play into the quickness of the care you
get...

I once lived in southern MD...California, Maryland...just south of
Hollywood...

I now live in a small town - about 26,000 - in the middle of the Mojave
desert in California.  Our local hospital has about 80 beds in the main
hospital, and they have a fantastic nursing staff, but we severely lack
for doctors - we only have one general surgeon worth his credentials
locally.

We also have access to only one GI - who is fine if there's nothing
actually wrong with you.  It took me three trips to the ER over four
days before I could get admitted to the hospital during my flare last
year...once I was in, I was there for two and a half weeks...and my (now
former) GI went on vacation...

I now drive about 300 miles round trip to get to the IBD clinic at UCLA
for checkups, and maintain a local GP.  I need to get scoped again next
month to try and get a determinate diagnosis, and I plan to do that in
Chicago where I have family to look after me.

I'm very seriously thinking of relocating now that I've developed
whatever it is that's wrong with me.
