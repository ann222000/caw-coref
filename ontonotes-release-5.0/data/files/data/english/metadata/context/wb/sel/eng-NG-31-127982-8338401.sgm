Just back from my holidays so missed this in the Guardian a wee while
back. I can't see any reference to it here but thought it might be
interesting to umf readers.

(Thanks to Jean-Luc on cam.misc)

A very interesting read.

Coincidentally I was talking to someone at work about this today and in
relation to the Broken Family Band too.

I'm always curious to know how much gigging a band has to do in order to
make say £25k each a year and make it a full time job.

Which was exactly the calculation we had to make in the last band I as in.

We got offered a record deal but it wouldn't work unless we actually got
paid what we earned.

This meant a reasonable corporate set-up where the record royalties ,
especially the 'mechanical royalty' went to us rather than sitting in a
record company bank account for a couple of decades.

However,  on mentioning the words 'mechanical royalty' and  'band
incorporating itself as a limited company' to the record company we found
the deal evaporated.

Well,  not so much evaporated as disappeared in a cloud of dust and small
pebbles as the record company accountant's silver BMW Series 3 accelerated
down the path away from the cottage where we used to rehearse...

We went back to the £25,000 a year day jobs...

I'd probably have a go now as I'm retired,  but I'm also a bit old to go
touring these days...

I've been interested in this latest rags-to-riches story with Simon
Cowell's discovered tenor Paul Potts (has anyone else notice something
Cambodian about this name or is it just me?) getting a (pinky nail in
the mouth) *one million* pound contract.

How many albums? How much touring? Where do costs come out of etc?

All this will soon be a thing of the past when the record companies
evaporate and PCM quality MP3s replace CDs finally. Interesting times.

Wot with The Artist Now Known Again As Prince giving his album away on a
Sunday rag, I guess all rules of business are off and anything goes.

I know of one banjo teacher who is working for free on a software-style
open-source license. How the hell that works I've no idea but he seems
to be happily churning out the stuff and making money somewhere.

Assuming it's a standard contract he'll have to make three albums for three
years and do at least one tour of a number of dates.

All costs will come out of his cut.

He'll be charged 'top dollar' by the record company for everything,
including £2:50 for every cup of tea that gets drunk at his recording

£25k a year to share between the bandmembers is more realistic.
:-)
Banding is the worst paid job on the folk scene. Even if you get paid
decent rates for gigs the expenses are high and there are a lot of
bandmates to share with.

We just about made a living as a trio with Artisan, but if £25k per year
is your idea of a basic income I'd like to come and live on your street.

You might make that as a soloist _if_ you're very lucky, much in demand,
have a good agent, run your own record company and sell an average of 10
CDs a gig.

Don't forget the expenses include not just travelling to and from the
gig,  but poster and flyer printing, advertising, office expenses, i.e.
running a computer with broadband and maintaining your web site, your
agent's 15% or the cost of getting your own gigs, cost of maintaining a
mailing list - including some paper mail outs (our last paper mail shot
cost £800). Then there's your gig clothes, hairdressing and the stupid
stuff we do to look halfway decent - which might even include the more
expensive of two options for dentistry or contact lenses for stagewear
or nail-wraps for guitarists.
That's before you start on the instruments, PA, vehicle, running costs
and maintenance. Oh yes, and union fees.

Did I forget anything, Dick?

So presume you are a soloist and you are lucky enough to get 150 gigs a
year at an average of £150 a gig - that's still only £22,500. Let's say
you average 5 CD sales per gig with a profit of £7 per CD after
recording and manufacturing and royalty costs - that's another £5,250.

So your basic wage is up to £27,750 before you start to deduct all the
above expenses.

You'll be living on about £13,000 - £14,000 a year if you're lucky.

Even if you are well in demand and you average £200 per gig, that's
still only another £7,5k  and some expenses - like agent's percentages -
rise proportionately so you'll be lucky if you see £5k out of that, so
then you're up to, maybe, £19k a year - but guess what... the tax man
and NI dept. is going to take about 3k of that, so your income is about
£16k per year. Of course, some well established soloists command fees
well in excess of £200 per gig, but many on even the middle rungs of the
ladder are still gigging in folk clubs for £80 or £100 per night when
they have to.

And remember, generally, the higher the fee, the fewer gigs per year.

Say you're part of a band that asks for 5k as a festival fee... how many
gigs a year does that band expect to do? (How many festivals have that
kind of budget?) How many members in the band? Do they pay extra for a
sound man and maybe a manager?

If you are going to become a full time folk musician I can tell you now
that you'll be doing it because you can't bear to do anything else, not
because you think it's a good way to make a decent living. Far more
musicians fail to earn a full time wage than succeed. I know a lot of
full time musicians who couldn't do what they do if they didn't have a
spouse with a 'real' job.

When we kicked the day jobs in the head and went full time with Artisan
in 1989 we would never have been able to manage if not for the fact that
we'd bought our house at the right time (in 1971) and paid off the
mortgage, so our overheads were minimal. We didn't used to pay ourselves
gig by gig; we put it into a pot and paid ourselves a monthly wage -
whether or not there were any gigs that month. Our first monthly wage
was £350 each.

Even in 1989 that wasn't a lot.

I wish I could say they went up rapidly from there.
:-)

People who knew we'd packed in the day jobs used to come and ask if we
could earn 'enough' as musicians and our answer was always, 'Define
enough.' Despite the fact that we've never had (still don't have) money
for luxuries, I wouldn't go back on that decision in 1989.

To go back to your first question, to earn £25k a year as a (5 piece)
band-member the band would have to be doing 200 gigs a year at £1,000
per gig and selling CDs like mad to give you a clear take home pay of
£125 per gig after expenses.

Or 100 gigs a year at £2,000 per gig

What are the chances of that?

:-)

Don't give up the day job... at least, not for the money.

You're asking Dick about contact lenses and dentistry?

Try asking Pete Coe!

Methinks the world is slightly different for the opposite sex. Bert
Jansch could occasionally do with a hearing aid (or a monitor actually
sited in his ear) and John Martyn could maybe do with some panel beating
and a respray. Mr Renbourn could try a diet but it would rather reduce
his charm.

Sadly, £25k is something slightly under the mythical average wage which
I have never been able to pay anyone.

We'll never know for sure. Until well into the 1960s, we only had the
vaguest idea of what many of the pop singers looked like, particularly
the American ones. They may have been very spotty indeed, and got away
with it.

I haven't a clue what you're on about.

All the above earned a living from music, in some cases a very good
living.  None of them were folk musicians.  Of all the above, I've
probably heard more Lennon/McCartney songs in folk clubs than any of
the rest.  Whether they should be heard in folk clubs is another
matter (debated through the night many times).

">

Pop music - since the 1920s at least - has always been about youth, good
looks, sex appeal, fashion - the 'cool' new look, the new 'in' sounds, the
new musical gimmick etc.  It is normal for teenagers to be a bit rebellious
and to reject their parent's tastes and go for something new and 'cool'.

But apart from that, the potential profit in the old days for selling a
million vinyl 45s in an exploitative contract deal kept it all going until
now.  The 'music biz' is shrinking 10% year on year.

Expect more and more copyright tightening backlash as they fight back in
sheer desperation.  I wish there was more youth-orientated music-making and
music sales to keep the biz profitable. It would impact less on me than it
does now - or is going to.

My experience is that the kids are making their own music more and more.

Cheap home computers and software and even cheaper decent quality musical
instruments mean more and more kids are making their own music.

They mainly refuse to have anything to do with the record companies because
record companies are seen by most of today's kids interested in music as
vampires.

But were they making a living or dining out on earlier earnings?

I vaguely knew an artist once (painter) who spent a month at a time in
the Himalayas painting abstract canvases that sold for £600 a time. Not
a living really. [He's now a well known artist and I'm cursing I didn't
buy one back then as they sell for a packet now.]

I also have a mate who quit his job to become a herbalist. Trained for
years and years only to discover ALL of his class had second incomes or
partners with decent livings.

I can imagine a solicitor could pay their house off early (with some
stress) and then throw it in to downsize from £100k pa to £20k pa.
Sounds like a reasonable move. If I had the talent (and the £100k) I
would be tempted.

Patronage. Years back (Mozart etc), this was how it worked. Nowadays the
&quot;sell product&quot; model is failing (and as others have said, it's not the
music industry that's in trouble, it's the CD sales industry). I've
often wondered whether patronage could/should be resurrected; with
fivetrees we've considered a &quot;subscribe to your favourite artiste and
receive music in exchange for such patronage&quot; model. Might still do so.

Todd Rundgren set up Patronet a while back; currently it's being
revamped and is non-operational. Interesting idea, though.

personally I think the future [of recorded music sales] will be via
mobile phone. If you consider music as being streamed (latency buffered)
to a mobile device then you can charge per listen onto the phone bill.
It would be interesting to see if people will be more willing to graze
in the music field at 10p a listen rather than 70p an MP3.

However, the big issue is live performance. Watching live on the
Internet might be the next thing. (Was that Ewan McColl I just heard

I suppose £25k seems low to some folks but I've never earned £25k a

Well, apparently there are websites where you can beg for (and get)
money to finance breast enlargements, so it doesn't seem totally
preposterous to imagine a site where you could beg for money to finance
a new album, or just some extra cash to get your car through its MOT.
Might be worth a try. You could invite people to sponsor a line of a
song or something.

Ah. The dotcom boom was almost founded on the idea of
pay-per-listen/view, with the expected idyll of a global jukebox - all
copyrighted material held centrally, no need to buy anything, you get
charged a &quot;micropayment&quot; for use of it. Enough fibre was plumbed in back
then to allow the infrastructure to cope with the expected migration of
all such media (including telly) to cable.

Except it didn't happen - not because of the technology, which was there
(pretty much [1]), but because of established business models.
Basically, the music/movie sales/licensing cartels (let's be honest)
liked things just the way they were. It worked for them just fine.
Hollywood etc just was not, and is not, ready to consider alternative
models. And they won't until they have no option. This is, maybe,
starting to happen with music (not yet with movies).

Also the banks etc weren't ready to cope with micropayments. And
(arguably) still aren't. Same problem: they like it the way it is. (5
working days to clear an electronic payment? Bah.)

[1] After the dotcom bust, it was estimated that 90% of all cable
installed was dark (unused). I was working at the time for a telecomms
company... which folded shortly thereafter...

I've heard that comment for the last few generations ;).

I wouldn't worry. Those who get deeply enough into it to read, or who
kick off with classical training, will read. Those who don't, won't.
T'was ever thus.

The use of a pen, however, *is* a vanishing craft ;). My handwriting
used to be impeccable (due to primary school in France, where
&quot;orthography&quot; was taught in a most regimented fashion, for which I'm
grateful). Nowadays it's atrophied; I can rarely read my own
handwriting. I can type pretty darned well, though ;). (But I can't text
to save my life. Old dog etc.)

&gt; Ah. The dotcom boom was almost founded on the idea of pay-per-listen/view,
&gt; with the expected idyll of a global jukebox - all copyrighted material
&gt; held centrally, no need to buy anything, you get charged a &quot;micropayment&quot;
&gt; for use of it. Enough fibre was plumbed in back then to allow the
&gt; infrastructure to cope with the expected migration of all such media
&gt; (including telly) to cable.

&gt; Except it didn't happen - not because of the technology, which was there
&gt; (pretty much [1]), but because of established business models. Basically,
&gt; the music/movie sales/licensing cartels (let's be honest) liked things
&gt; just the way they were. It worked for them just fine. Hollywood etc just
&gt; was not, and is not, ready to consider alternative models. And they won't
&gt; until they have no option. This is, maybe, starting to happen with music
&gt; (not yet with movies).

&gt; Also the banks etc weren't ready to cope with micropayments. And
&gt; (arguably) still aren't. Same problem: they like it the way it is. (5
&gt; working days to clear an electronic payment? Bah.)

&gt; [1] After the dotcom bust, it was estimated that 90% of all cable
&gt; installed was dark (unused). I was working at the time for a telecomms
&gt; company... which folded shortly thereafter...
">

Well,  that and the greed of the cable companies and Sky keeping cutting
their price to stop people going for cable and BT not being allowed to sell
movies.

If BT had been allowed to sell movies at 10p a shot down the phone line it
would have changed the whole view of the digital world for the person in
their home.  But they weren't because the cable companies lobbied the
government to stop them because they thought every settlement with over
25,000 people would generate them enough business for them to be worth
putting in the fibre.

And now we're in a ghastly hole,  with ADSL being able to move vast amounts
of data between your home and the telephone exchange but the fibres between
the exchanges and your ISP being clogged because no-one can afford to lay
any more of the stuff...

If you publish (in any sense) a cover, you have to pay MCPS fees.
Upfront.

There's one loophole: unless it's purely for promotional purposes and
not for sale. Make of that what you will.

I guess you can gig for a job without it being full time.

Indeed you can. Many musicians make up their total income with gigging
and part-time jobs or instrumental teaching. If you have a full time job
unrelated to music then I think that gigging may be 'what you do' but
it's not your job. Though that doesn't mean you tackle it in a less than
professional manner, of course.

I want to put the new Outside Track album up for digital download via
CDBaby (and thence to iTunes etc.) but MCPS tells me they can't handle
the royalties on digital sales and I'm supposed to seek permission from
all the individual (international) copyright holders/publishers (and
there are many because of multiple writers of tunes included in tune
sets). If I don't seek permission (or if they don't respond - which some
of them haven't) I can still do it legally, but I'm supposed to account
on a monthly basis and it seems daft getting a US bank draft each month
for the nine downloads of a Dar Williams song at 8 cents per download.

The popular take on it seems to be 'publish and be damned' - set aside
the royalties and account to the copyright owners once a year or twice a
year if the money builds up to a significant amount.

Dammit I _want_ to stay legal on this. We've paid the MCPS licence for
the pressing and sales are really encouraging so far, but we don't want
to miss out on digital sales. I'd be happy to pay a digital licence in
advance of sales just to show good faith. You'd think they could do it
as a percentage of your MCPS bill. OK it might not be entirely
representative of the exact sales figures, but it would be a token
gesture to keep us legal.

&gt; A &quot;suspense account&quot;? Is it really called that? Cool. I think I'll open

No no Sean not that kind of suspense.    Suspense as in suspended.
Noun 1. suspense account - an account used temporarily to carry
doubtful receipts and disbursements or discrepancies pending their analysis
and permanent classification.

So you could open one then &quot;hang around&quot; a bit until you spent it:-)
That I suppose could be suspenseful.
