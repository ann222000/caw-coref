I'm loath to ask this since I'm sure it will evoke all kinds of
emotions, name calling and conclude with me sobbing uncontrollably in
the corner, but I'm really feeling that it would be a big help if Neuros
did more to help our users xcode content for the OSD, particuliarly
starting with unencrypted dvds.  Obviously we're not going to touch the
encrypted ones due to the DMCA, but still I think it would save users a
lot of grief if we had a solution for xcoding files (starting with MPEG-2).

Personally, I'm partial to handbrake because it seems to easily support
.mp4 files which are not only editable on the OSD (I realize I'm
probably the only person in the world to care about this) but are also
playable on more handhelds (iPod, PSP) at least to some extent.
However, I realize the windows version uses .net, which is not all that
attractive for a host of reasons.  there's AutoGK too, which seems to
work reliably (once you know the right settings).  Thoughts on
additional ones (this is primarily directed towards the casual,
layperson type user)?

My thought is that Neuros could and should pick *one* and starting with
a tutorial, work with that software and potentially enhance it to make
sure it works flawlessly, and works flawlessly with the OSD.  This
transcoding would start with MPEG-2, but should ultimately work with any
kinds of files that we can't play natively (and should be smart enough
to know the difference)

Thoughts?

HA-HA-HA!!! :)

Come on Joe, we're grown ups. We won't resort to name-calling and
hair-pulling unless you bring up a Java-vs-native-code or Apple-vs-Linux
discussion. ;-)

The way I see it, if the user plugs a DVD-RW (do DVD-ROM drives even exist
still?) in a USB 2.0 enclosure, the OSD should pop-up a dialog asking &quot;I see
a new drive there, do you want to set it up as a ripping device? (yes/no).

Then once the device's USB ID is saved as default &quot;source&quot; location, it
shouldn't ask the same question again every time is inserted, but instead
bring up a &quot;CD/DVD ripping&quot; application offering the user the option of
ripping audio tracks to SD or CF / Micrdrive storage. Same with movies.

I have 8GB Seagate microdrives that work quite well.

The question is: does the OSD currently support mounting and browsing CD
devices?

My thought is that Neuros could and should pick *one* and starting with

See above. Although I'm not sure if what you had in mind has any relation
with what I just said. :)

I think Joe was referring to a PC application that would encode files from
one format (such as mpeg-2) to an OSD compatible format (his preference
being .mp4). I think he was thinking more along the lines of Iriverter (
http://iriverter.thestaticvoid.org/ ). I originally saw this posted on the
old forums as a tool for the 442. If I recall accurately, someone had posted
a Neuros442.profile on those forums.

Iriverter is basically just a user-friendly front-end for mencoder. I
believe it will run on Windows, Linux, and OSX. Another good cross-platform
transcoder is ffmpeg, but I'm not sure what front-ends are currently
available for it.

Sorry for the top posting- handheld.

Yeah, I was more interested in at least starting on the pc side (easiest place to get started + I'm worried about the xcoding speed on osd itself).  I do think xcoding on the osd is interesting though.  Handbrake is an ffmpeg front end, autogk uses ffmpeg too iirc.

Oh, sorry for my misunderstanding. What you propose sounds good.
