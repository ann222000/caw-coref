*[Beyond Western Europe]*

*[Email of the Day]*: Hello Tom, Looking at today's market action and my
long term count it is almost certain now that Nifty is now in minute wave iv
(circled) of 3 of (3). Looks to me a Diagonal wave (v) was completed at
recent all-time High of 6357. Would like know your views as always. Regards,
Vinay

My reply: Thank you for sharing your long-term wave count. I am concerned
that wave (3) might be complete at the current high, but I agree that an
important correction seems to have begun from the recent high.

I will show you the count I was using that failed and the adjustment I have
made with the next three charts.

When the *[India Sensex Index]* fell sharply on 16 January, I concluded that
it was wave (iv) of an ending diagonal fifth wave. I anticipated that price
would begin to rally in wave (v) from near the low of the 16th. Price traded
inside the range of the previous day's bar on the 17th, but the decline
continued on Friday, the 18th and came very near to the low of &quot;wave (ii)&quot;
as labeled here. The fall is now too deep for me to keep looking for a
rally, so I adjusted my count to the view shown on the next chart.

The sharp break down of the *[India Sensex Index]* over the past week
suggests that an important top has formed. The pattern of recent weeks
suggests that an ending diagonal fifth wave has ended. This development
means that we should favor the downside towards at least the start of the
fifth wave from 17,179 and very possibly lower to the August low of 13,779.
The intraday low of 15 January at 20,203 should offer durable resistance.

The wave count shown here is troubled because wave (iii) of v (circled) is
the shortest and that violates an important rule of Elliott. In addition,
wave (ii) of v (circled) is a much more complex wave than wave (iv). These
issues reduce confidence in this wave count, but in the absence of a better
alternative, I am going to work from this view.

Wave (iii) of the Nifty Index is not the shortest, so that gives me a little
confidence to favor this view.

The *[S&amp;P CNX Nifty Index]* displays the same pattern as the Sensex, but in
this case, all the wave relationships satisfy Elliott's rules. The
conclusion of an ending diagonal pattern means that we should favor the
downside towards at least the start of the fifth wave from 5073 and very
possibly lower to the August low of 4008. The intraday low of 11 January at
6112 should offer durable resistance over the coming days.

The *[Shanghai Composite Index]* has fallen sharply enough from 5523 to draw
the conclusion that price has completed an ABC rally from November. This
development would mean that Chinese shares should fall impulsively through
4779 over the coming weeks. Watch for resistance near 5289 to stall
corrective rebounds and to keep the trend down.

The *[iShares FTSE/Xinhua China Trust]* fell sharply this past week to a new
low for the correction. Wave C could be complete at current levels, but I
would continue to favor the downside while price is under the wave A low of
161. In addition, because the trend of the Shanghai markets has turned down,
I am not eager to turn bullish in this market. On the other hand, FXI did
not track the Shanghai market during its recent rally, so maybe it will not
track native shares closely in declining farther in the coming weeks.

The *[iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index]* may have completed an ABC
correction this past week. The sharp decline managed to retrace a Fibonacci
61.8 percent of the rally from August before recovering slightly on Friday.
Whether the decline will continue towards 111 or rebound through 141 and
continue higher seems equally likely today.
