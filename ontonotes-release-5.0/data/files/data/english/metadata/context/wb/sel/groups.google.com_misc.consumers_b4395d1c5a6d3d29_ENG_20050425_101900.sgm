It's Worse Than You Think
By DANIEL KADLEC

Inflation is back. It's official, and you can blame costlier gasoline
and other fuels. But make no mistake: the tab for common services like
a hotel stay and garbage removal are jumping too, as is the sticker
price on packaged foods and many other household items. Companies are
finding that they can pass on part of their soaring raw-material costs.

Yet inflation--at 3%, about par for a growing economy--is actually
worse than it appears. That isn't widely understood by the millionaires
on Wall Street, who were shocked--shocked!--to learn that life is
getting more expensive and sent stocks into a brief tailspin. But most
of us have been dealing with stealth inflation for a couple of years.

One underappreciated development: folks have gone so much deeper into
hock that even the lowest interest rates in a generation haven't cut
their average monthly household debt payments, which are at an all-time
high and increasing. As rates rise, that will get worse.

Inflation that you feel but can't see comes in many forms. Real estate
prices have gone through the roof, so cash buyers are paying through
the nose. Borrowers are increasingly resorting to floating-rate and
interest-only loans, which all but guarantee that they will pay more
over the life of their loans. Officially, though, housing looks like a
bargain. Why? The housing component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
is based on rents, which are tame and in some regions have even fallen.

Retailers like Wal-Mart and Home Depot are quietly replacing common
items with more expensive versions, driving up the price of an average
basket at their stores. Think of a plain gas grill replaced by a
fancier one for $20 more. Sure, you get a warming tray, but you still
pay more to grill your burgers.

Out-of-pocket costs for cars and computers are understated. Last year
the average suggested sticker price for a passenger car rose $467,
reports the Department of Labor. But because of improved brake, air-bag
and theft-protection technology, which made cars more valuable, an
increase of only $386 was built into the CPI in an effort to measure
&quot;constant quality,&quot; says Patrick Jackman, senior economist at Labor.

Meanwhile, the sense of wealth that President George W. Bush's tax cuts
engendered has been overdone. Some of the savings have been offset by
rising state and local taxes and fees. And if you pay the alternative
minimum tax, which is rapidly encroaching on the middle class, say
goodbye to a big chunk of your federal tax savings.

Finally, we all face soaring health-insurance premiums, deductibles and
co-pays as employers shift more of the burden onto employees. Yet the
CPI looks at total expenditures without regard for who is footing the
bill. Simply shifting the burden leaves no mark on official inflation.

So, long before Mattel jacked up the price of Barbie and the CPI
confirmed rising prices, real people were feeling the sting. Making
matters worse, after adjusting for the cost of living, the average wage
in the U.S. has been in a down trend for nearly two years. For folks
making less, even a touch of inflation imposes hardship.

Many on Wall Street are sanguine, saying inflation will cool when the
economy slows. But they're talking about official data, not what it
really takes to live your life.

Just pure coincidence the Bush family is an oil family, and gas
is nearing $3/gallon. Really it is. Honest.

Would have been nice to not lose 1500+ American servicemen,
100,000+ Iraqi civilians and well over $200 billion in taxes to
accomplish this though.

Did you seriously mistake metaphorical discussion illustrative of

pricing in Q2 2005, or were you simply taking the opportunity to vent
about the high cost of cars today?

necessarily need to be the result of simple corporate greed, as in the
upthread mentioned airbags, emissions control etc. The marketplace is
incapable of eliminating airbags from a large SUV to lower the price --
never. going. to. happen.

&gt;It's Worse Than You Think
&gt;By DANIEL KADLEC

&gt;Inflation is back. It's official, and you can blame costlier gasoline
&gt;and other fuels. But make no mistake: the tab for common services like
&gt;a hotel stay and garbage removal are jumping too, as is the sticker
&gt;price on packaged foods and many other household items. Companies are
&gt;finding that they can pass on part of their soaring raw-material costs.

&gt;Yet inflation--at 3%, about par for a growing economy--is actually
&gt;worse than it appears. That isn't widely understood by the millionaires
&gt;on Wall Street, who were shocked--shocked!--to learn that life is
&gt;getting more expensive and sent stocks into a brief tailspin. But most
&gt;of us have been dealing with stealth inflation for a couple of years.

"/>  Let me complain about two things:

1. The CPI fails to measure the inflation rate for a few reasons.

2. Cost of living increases faster than the inflation rate.

First, Number 1: How the CPI fails to indicate the actual extent of
inflation.

The CPI, or Consumer Price Index, has a first way of undermeasuring
inflation by having lower weighting to items less paid from take-home pay,
such as healthcare and college tuition. Half of the USA's healthcare
costs are paid by the government and a good chunk of the rest are paid by
employers, so most of healthcare inflation increases either taxes or the
deficit (deficit increase does not increase CPI until taxpayers pay it
back plus interest on it) or employment costs (an aspect of inflation not
in the CPI) rather than the CPI. College tuition is to some extent
subsidized by government grants and tax breaks and loan interest
subsidies, so increases in college tuition do not fully impact the CPI.

In a second way the CPI falls short of measuring inflation by now using
some of the recommendations of the &quot;Boskin Commission&quot;. This should have
been a major scandal, but got less attention than the impending
impeachment of Clinton at that time. I don't know which of the
recommendations got adopted (some did), but I remember some of the
recommendations:

a) Increase of quality. Cars improved over the years and decades, and
computers surely did.
However, telephones, local telephone service, payphone service, a
majority of consumer electronic items, a majority of retail service and
food in general decreased in quality to some extent or another.

b) The Boskin commission did recommend discounting inflation in specific
products that forced people to choose alternatives. An example I remember
being cited - to the extent CPI includes the price of ice cream, change
that to the price of frozen yogurt should people change from ice cream to
frozen yogurt if ice cream prices go up. But if ice cream and frozen
yogurt have prices increasing by the same percentage, then an economizing
move by consumers would indicate a lowering of standard of living rather
than lack of inflation.

2: Why cost of living incrases faster than the CPI does: The list of
necessities increases. Many items now considered necessities were not yet
invented 150 years ago, and some were uninvented or non-necessities much
more recently than 100 years ago, and a few more recently than that. For
example, Internet service would be considered by most people essential
enough to be part of the CPI, but the CPI did not measure the increase in
cost of living caused by an ISP bill becoming part of the cost of living.
I suspect same for cellphones, home computers, cars, many electrical
applicanes including refrigerators (if the CPI was invented before
refrigerators or cars became part of usual life), and repairs to these.
Also all medical procedures that became part of the CPI (or should have)
after the CPI was invented.

Payphone base costs for local calls outpaced the CPI since the CPI had
its 1973 redefinition, with feature changes mostly directory service
becoming something to have to pay for, longer time required for directory
service and operator service, and loss of printed directories and a
decrease in availability of phones.

&gt;&gt; TIME / May 2, 2005
&gt;&gt; It's Worse Than You Think
&gt;&gt; By DANIEL KADLEC
&gt;&gt; Inflation is back. It's official, and you can blame costlier gasoline
&gt;&gt; and other fuels. But make no mistake: the tab for common services like
&gt;&gt; a hotel stay and garbage removal are jumping too, as is the sticker
&gt;&gt; price on packaged foods and many other household items. Companies are
&gt;&gt; finding that they can pass on part of their soaring raw-material costs.
&gt;&gt; Yet inflation--at 3%, about par for a growing economy--is actually
&gt;&gt; worse than it appears. That isn't widely understood by the millionaires
&gt;&gt; on Wall Street, who were shocked--shocked!--to learn that life is
&gt;&gt; getting more expensive and sent stocks into a brief tailspin. But most
&gt;&gt; of us have been dealing with stealth inflation for a couple of years.
&gt; Let me complain about two things:

"/> Request denied.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 1. The CPI fails to measure the inflation rate for a few reasons.

"/> Its never going to be feasible to measure it very accurately
because people's spending choices vary so widely.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2. Cost of living increases faster than the inflation rate.

"/> Thats very arguable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; First, Number 1: How the CPI fails to indicate the actual extent of
&gt; inflation.
&gt; The CPI, or Consumer Price Index, has a first way of
&gt; undermeasuring inflation by having lower weighting to items less
&gt; paid from take-home pay, such as healthcare and college tuition.

"/> Gobbledegook.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Half of the USA's healthcare costs are paid by the government

"/> And are funded by taxation, stupid.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and a good chunk of the rest are paid by employers,

"/> Irrelevant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; so most of healthcare inflation increases either taxes
&gt; or the deficit (deficit increase does not increase CPI
&gt; until taxpayers pay it back plus interest on it) or employment
&gt; costs (an aspect of inflation not in the CPI) rather than the CPI.

"/> Utterly mangled when the CPI doesnt count what people spend.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; College tuition is to some extent subsidized by government
&gt; grants and tax breaks and loan interest subsidies, so
&gt; increases in college tuition do not fully impact the CPI.

"/> Utterly mangled all over again.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In a second way the CPI falls short of measuring inflation by now
&gt; using some of the recommendations of the &quot;Boskin Commission&quot;.
&gt; This should have been a major scandal,

"/> Pathetic, really.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but got less attention than the impending impeachment of Clinton
&gt; at that time. I don't know which of the recommendations got
&gt; adopted (some did), but I remember some of the recommendations:
&gt; a) Increase of quality. Cars improved over the
&gt; years and decades, and computers surely did.

"/> Impossible to quantify tho.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However, telephones, local telephone service, payphone service,
&gt; a majority of consumer electronic items, a majority of retail service
&gt; and food in general decreased in quality to some extent or another.

"/> Bullshit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; b) The Boskin commission did recommend discounting inflation
&gt; in specific products that forced people to choose alternatives.
&gt; An example I remember being cited - to the extent CPI includes the
&gt; price of ice cream, change that to the price of frozen yogurt should
&gt; people change from ice cream to frozen yogurt if ice cream prices go up.

"/> You need remedial english, BAD.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But if ice cream and frozen yogurt have prices increasing by the
&gt; same percentage, then an economizing move by consumers would
&gt; indicate a lowering of standard of living rather than lack of inflation.

"/> Nope.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2: Why cost of living incrases faster than the
&gt; CPI does: The list of necessities increases.

"/> Nope.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Many items now considered necessities
&gt; were not yet invented 150 years ago,

"/> Irrelevant. They mostly replaced those that had been invented well before that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and some were uninvented or non-necessities much more
&gt; recently than 100 years ago, and a few more recently than that.

"/> God knows what that's supposed to mean.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; For example, Internet service would be considered
&gt; by most people essential enough to be part of the CPI,
&gt; but the CPI did not measure the increase in cost of living
&gt; caused by an ISP bill becoming part of the cost of living.

"/> Pity its actually reduced.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I suspect same for cellphones, home computers, cars, many
&gt; electrical applicanes including refrigerators (if the CPI was
&gt; invented before refrigerators or cars became part of usual life),

"/> You're wrong. In spades when the real cost of
most of those has dropped significantly over time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and repairs to these.

"/> More mindless stuff. Most dont bother to repair most of that stuff anymore.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also all medical procedures that became part of
&gt; the CPI (or should have) after the CPI was invented.

"/> Not feasible to lump that in.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If all Kia dealerships stopped selling $10k cars, and turned into

&gt;&gt;&gt; what is the practical difference, if you can no longer find a $10K

&gt;&gt; The practical difference is that the market will take care of that void

&gt; If the manufacturers can sell cars for $80K instead of $10K, why would

several reasons, in addition and including competitive forces, that

My joke the was &quot;what happens if you crash a Yugo at7 MPH? It becomes a

I think a Yugo should have cost at most $6K in 1995 if still available
then. I believe low end cars in 1995 cost more than $7K with price
increase faster than inflation due to experiencing improvements.
But I am also arguing that cost of living has been increasing faster
than the CPI due to price increases without quality increases with this
mainly occurring in categories other than cars.
Furthermore I am arguing that the CPI rate of increase underestimates
rate of cost of living increase by failing to consider increase in cost of
living due to a new modern item becoming a cost of living - while claiming
lower inflation because the new item had price increasing less, not at all
increasing or decreasing after it got included in &quot;the basket&quot; while
ignoring cost of living increasing from a new item such as ISP entering
&quot;the basket&quot;. The load of &quot;the basket&quot; has increased over the decades and
this makes the cost of living increase faster than the averaged rate of
price increase of items &quot;in the basket&quot;!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So what, that's not inflation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Inflation is the devaluing of the dollar, and not necessarily a
&gt;&gt; higher
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; price tag on products.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If all Kia dealerships stopped selling $10k cars, and turned
into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Porche dealerships selling $80k cars, that is NOT inflation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; what is the practical difference, if you can no longer find a
$10K
&gt;&gt; car
&gt;&gt;&gt; to buy? Seriously.

&gt;&gt; The practical difference is that the market will take care of that
void
&gt;&gt; (if it really exists) by itself, whereas with real inflation it
cannot.

&gt; If the manufacturers can sell cars for $80K instead of $10K, why
would
&gt; they want to sell cars for $10K? &quot;The Market&quot; will tend to charge the
&gt; maximum possible price for any good, service or utility, thus
maximizing
&gt; shareholder value, the only legitimate valuation of any publicly held
&gt; corp.

"/> Just because manufacturers might make $80k cars, who's to say they're
going to sell them?

The market will also weed about products that are too high price as
well.

&gt; Your analysis is trivial and misleading. For some goods the maximum

are

So that cheap &quot;Tool Shop&quot; brand socket set at Menards might be more
expensive than it looks.

I.e., American consumer support of the Chinese export market supports a
major competitor economy, based in a totalitaritian, single party
communist country. Which is why China has gone from a net exporter of
petroleum to a net importer, which has a lot to do with the price of
crude oil (and has a lot to do with why we're in iraq), which is a
strong factor in the surge in distillate (gasoline, heating oil, diesel)
pricing and is maybe even helping to fund the development of a
blue-water PRC navy designed to take on the USN in 30 years. etc. etc.
etc.

But hey, you got that socket set cheap!

The Marketplace doesn't even begin to address the social, environmental
or extranational costs, and isn't competent to do so. These costs are,
or will be, nonetheless ultimately born by the American consumer.

A bicycle and a PT Cruiser assembled in Mexico. I believe the PT is

check and if it's made in China, i will mail it to the address of your

a delivery reciept and acknoweledge in this forum that you recieved it

In this particular case, you seem to have stated that
he was wrong about something, and you provided specific

So, in response, he accuses you of being a sockpuppet,
or, more specific a forgery-sockpuppet, belonging to a

Instead of responding to the content of your post, he
is distracting from it. By suggesting that your

&gt; example, Internet service would be considered by most people
essential
&gt; enough to be part of the CPI, but the CPI did not measure the
increase in
&gt; cost of living caused by an ISP bill becoming part of the cost of
living.
&gt; I suspect same for cellphones, home computers, cars, many electrical
&gt; applicanes including refrigerators (if the CPI was invented before
&gt; refrigerators or cars became part of usual life), and repairs to
these.
&gt; Also all medical procedures that became part of the CPI (or should
have)
&gt; after the CPI was invented.

"/> Again, the CPI basket of goods is updated. Certainly, there is no
perfect way to measure things because it is a complex and dynamic
situation. It is also, just an average and really only important
for inflation indexing of taxes/benefits (which is why the issue
is so contentious) and determining general macroeconomic trends.
The real question is whether living standards have improved and
I think that is clearly the case for just about everyone in the
Industrialized World. In all likelihood, our kids will have it
even better than us.

wages appear higher in &quot;Current dollars&quot;, until you look at the figures

&gt;&gt; Wrong. The *market* will force the price close to the cost.
&gt;&gt;Regulation will tend to do the opposite.

&gt;HOWEVER, there many products... like Nike shoes ...which sell for
&gt;multiple times their production/distro/adv costs. I compel you to
&gt;explain how Nike can charge 100++ for a pair of shoes. I know why, but
&gt;you're limited to your own argument.

"/> You're comparing apples to oranges. At least in the mainstream
designs, &quot;cars&quot; are basically a commodity item, with lots of producers
manufacturing and selling the same kind of product (as well
as millions of sellers of used products for folks who don't
want to pay what the manufacturers are charging for new items).
These pressures tend to drive price fairly close to costs, at
least for models that aren't catering to folks who must have the
Latest Hot Thing, or who otherwise use their cars as status symbols.

&quot;Nike shoes&quot; are by definition a brand, not a commodity or even
a particular functional type of product. Of course successful brands
sell for more than commodities. That's why the companies
spend the time and money to make them into brands: they're trying
to get people to buy the brand, not the product. The basic product
is &quot;athletic shoes&quot;, and for most rational consumers it's
a commodity item-- with a few exceptions in the specialty market,
there are a bunch of companies all making more or less the same product.

If someone feels they have to get the shoes with the same logo as the
sports star whom Nike pays to wear it, then they'll pay a premium, but
they can't really blame this on inflation. A good inflation index
should track functional product types, not brands.
