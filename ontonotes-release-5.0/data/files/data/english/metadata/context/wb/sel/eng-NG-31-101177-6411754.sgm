*********************** ARTICLE START ***********************
I was beginning to worry that my daughter was going to grow up being a complete tomboy. If you look at her now, you can already tell that she is going to be a knockout when she gets older. Though I was a tomboy myself when I was growing up, there was a part of me that loved being a girl. I was worried that my daughter did not have this gene, but recently she has really shown me that she does. When we went shopping the other day, she begged and pleaded for a princess costume. We have not gotten one yet, but I’m going to get her one very soon

She wants a princess costume because she recently got a ballet dance mat for Christmas. She loves the idea of being a princess, and I for one am glad that she does. While I believe some children are spoiled to the point where they really believe that they are a princess, I believe my daughter is rather levelheaded. Her imagination has taken her many places, and a princess costume is just one of the latest things that she has asked for. I feel pretty confident that she is interested in many things, and being a princess is just one on a long list of things in her imagination.

The more I think about it, the more I think I would like to make her a princess costume. I have seen the ones in the stores, and I do not believe they are worth thirty dollars. They seem to be made of cheap material, and even though they represent almost an exact replica of what my daughter may see in the movie, I still do not believe that they are worth the money. I think a princess costume would be much more fun if it were made of material that will last longer than a few weeks. I may have to go out and buy all the pieces separately, but that is something that I prepared to do for her.

I think that her princess costume will be a small part of something bigger. I understand that her imagination is probably one of the most important things that I can nurture right now. You can not get by in any part of your life without an amazing imagination. I don’t care if you are an accountant or work on computers, you need a fair amount of imagination for problem solving purposes. I think I want to get her a dress up trunk full of clothes that she may use for play. The princess costume will be just one of many outfits she will find inside.
