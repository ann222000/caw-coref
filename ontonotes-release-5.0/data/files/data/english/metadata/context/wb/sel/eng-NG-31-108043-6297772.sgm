Hi,

As a DM I've been playing AD&amp;D (2nd edition) games in my own fantasy
world for the past two decades. The players have been playing other
characters and races so far, and they have usually lived elsewhere in
the world. Still, they know this continent pretty well, and the last
campaign played out around here as well.

Now I have the four players playing three dwarves and a hobbit, and they
have decided to live in the main dwarven city on the continent. That's
all fine and dandy, were it not that I have only designed the top level
of the city, which the characters sometimes visited, making up the rest
below as vague scenery, and never paid too much attention to little
details, since the characters never went there.

Now they would like to go live at the second level, and gave me a design
of their new "house" and I'm suddenly being confronted with design
questions and challenges I hadn't thought of before. I did some online
searches, but failed to come up with a really detailed "what to pay
attention to" dwarven city design guide.

Some of the things I'm wondering about are:
-They want to build a forge in their new (15m by 25m) building: so where
does the smoke go underground, and what about the necessary oxygen? I
was thinking about having big smoke channels underground, where everyone
below that level can "connect" to when building a new level further below.
-They would like to have their cart and ponies in their stables: how far
down below can I still make corridors big enough for those, before it
stops making sense any more?

-What does the underground city (it's located under a hill) really look
like inside? I know the Troglodyte caves in France, but did anyone ever
see fantasy drawings of an underground dwarven city (besides the one on
Krynn), which I can use to get some inspiration?

Any help or directions towards a site (or other forum?) which gives some
more detailed design info about dwarven cities would really be appreciated!

You could check the Complete Book of Dwarves for cultural tendencies,
but I'd assume you already have that. If you dont', there are quite a
few on E-Bay right now. I don't know if it's in there, I just remember
that the book exists. There's also this:
http://cgi.ebay.com/AD-D-Role-Aids-704-Dwarves-85-Sealed_W0QQitemZ317...
Might help.

You can abstract that problem away. Assume the Dwarves took care of
that issue millenia ago, and don't worry about it.

Do Dwarven cities make sense, usually? As far as you want. Physics?
What's that?

You have a few options. Do the dwarves dig corridors and carve living
spaces out of the walls? Or do they hollow out huge open spaces and
construct buildings in them?

Thanks Chris. I have that book, and frankly, besides a lot of ways to
make dwarven PC's and NPC's more interesting, it wasn't much help.

So far, the main part of the city (top level) is a hollowed out open
space inside a hill, with carved  and dug corridors below the top level.

I used the verbage about Moria in LoTR as a piece to get my
imagination going and came up with this:
http://crestar.drivein-jim.net/thegreatopen/showdh03.html

sitemap for the entire thing:
http://crestar.drivein-jim.net/thegreatopen/dwarfhomesite.html

level 1 and 2 were sort of tossed together, the levels below that
were more what I felt the Dwarves would do.

Vent holes and sink holes - either can be pretty deep. There was a 1400'
volcanic vent in a novel I just finished reading. How many floors is
that for a race of people less than 5' tall? The longer the vent, the
better the draw. Individual fires connect to the vent by an upward
slanted flue pipe and smoke is drawn out by the venturi vacuum.

Termite mounds work the same way... CO2 laden air is warmed sot that it
rises out through vents. Cooler O2 laden air is drawn into the mound
through the moist and porous soil of the mound. When the water
evaporates, the air is cooled.

The water table. :-p

It depends on the stone, but you aren't going to have a couple hundred
expert stone masons tromping around for centuries without there being
adequate protection from cave-ins.

I wouldn't use Lord of the Rings or natural caves as my visual. How much
time have these caves been inhabited? Even in low light, they'll have an
aesthetic appeal just for the sanity of their inhabitants.. Volcanic
basalt will be polished by centuries of passing feet so that it would
reflect torchlight like glass. Granite and marble will be inlaid with
gold. Limestone and sandstone will be reinforced with timbers at upper
levels and metals down below. Think of how humans decorate buildings of
stone and brick then maximize the interior for utility and appeal at low
light - like behind the bar at an upscale night club but with a low
luminescence provided by fungii rather than black lights.

There's a sample city in "Races of Stone", but I would make accesses
slanted upward rather than horizontal (then have them level out or have
a slight down turn at the ends).

Just my thoughts...

Where is the "fantasy" dial set in your world?  Are things gritty,
detailed, and designed with an eye for realism, or is everything
magical and fantastical with nary a care for which way gravity goes?
Or, like most fantasy worlds, is it somewhere in between?

In a high-fantasy setting, I would assume that the dwarves have
procured a source of everlasting or magical heat for their forges that
doesn't need fuel or produce smoke.  Captive fire elementals, magical
anvils, a boon from a Forge-God, etc.

In a "realistic" setting, the dwarves might have created a large space
in their city that is designed for nothing but blacksmithing. Nobody
has a forge in their house; they all do this work in the communal
forge area, which has exhaust vents, teams that forage for fuel, etc.

How deep do you want them to go?  Honestly, unless you really want a
sense of realism in your campaign, I wouldn't worry about this sort of
thing.

I've always considered dwarves to be uncomfortable in wide, open
spaces. Thus, I envision their "cities" to be vast, labyrinthine, well-
constructed and sturdy mazes of cramped corridors and small chambers.
They don't build houses, they dig them out and fortify them. The
concept of a free-standing building might be foreign to them. What's a
roof?

They might use natural caverns as gathering spots for trade between
clans, great meets, or significant ceremonies.  Active caverns might
be treated like oases in the desert; places to build forts in the
walls to guard the water supply.

HAve you considered picking up an old copy of MORIA by iron crown? You'd
have to do conversions, but it was an interesting attempt at designing a
