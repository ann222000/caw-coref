Rush's Challenge to Senator Reid

BEGIN TRANSCRIPT

RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, in the last half hour, Harry Reid took to
the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
phony soldiers business.  He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the
opportunity to demand of my syndicator that I be condemned for
something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to
introduce a resolution this afternoon along the lines of the
MoveOn.org resolution that was introduced last week, tit-for-tat, they
want a vote in the House to condemn me, a private citizen, for
something I did not say.  These people have had three, four days now
to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
doesn't matter.  What they are trying to do is flood a false story
into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

This is not just the anatomy of a smear.  There's much more going on
with this than just smearing me.  There is an attempt, I think, as
they have done throughout my career, to discredit me.  No matter how
many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
piece of Ted Kennedy legislation.  There has been no response by
Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be.  I have
no clue.  We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
the Senate this afternoon.  There are four of them, and here is the
first of the four.

REID:  Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the
line.  While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his
unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore.  During his show last Wednesday,
Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants.  This one was
unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic]  This comment was so beyond the
pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone.  And yet he followed it
up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a 37-
year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

RUSH:  (laughing)  I don't quite know how to deal with this.  I mean,
it's not a laughing matter, although it is a laughing matter because
this is such -- you talk about Kafkaesque.  I have just finished an
interview with Clarence Thomas talking about the lies and stuff spread
about him during his confirmation hearings, and now I, little old
private citizen, Rush Limbaugh, the subject of Senate action, the
subject today of House of Representatives action, all based on a
purposely told lie, which they know is a lie, and yet they are
persisting in this.  Followed it up with denials?  I followed it up
with setting the record straight.  By the way, on my website, folks,
all of this is there.  It's been up there all weekend, and we added
something last night that you have to see.

A week ago today, ABC News, Charlie Gibson, World News Tonight, did a
feature with Brian Ross, their investigative reporter, on phony
soldiers!  Last Monday, one week ago today.  I don't see ABC being
denounced.  Their story was on Jesse MacBeth, the same soldier I was
talking about one week ago.  That video is up at RushLimbaugh.com, as
well as an exposé by Brent Bozell's group, the Media Research Center,
on just who Media Matters for America is.  As to Jack Murtha, I just
did a story today saying that he has been sued by a soldier for
calling him a murderer.  I just reported the news today, and yet this
is reported as an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha.  This is
Kafkaesque, it's McCarthy-like, and I think I told you this on many
occasions.  My father would not believe any of this, not because of
the Senate, he just wouldn't believe that his son has become the focal
point of Democrats in the House of Representatives in the Senate,
someone targeted for destruction and smear, as a private citizen.
Here is number two of Senator Reid.

REID:  Rush Limbaugh took it upon himself to attack the courage and
character of those fighting and dying for him and for all of us.  Rush
Limbaugh got himself a deferment from serving when he was a young
man.  He never served in uniform.  He never saw in person the extreme
difficulty of maintaining peace in a foreign country engaged in a
civil war.  He never saw a person in combat.  Yet he thinks that his
opinion on the war is worth more than those who have been on the front
lines.  And what's worse, Limbaugh's show is broadcast on Armed Forces
Radio, which means that thousands of troops, overseas, and veterans
here at home, were forced to hear this attack on their patriotism.
Rush Limbaugh owes the men and women of our armed forces an apology.

RUSH:  (Laughing.)  He's gotta be a nut.  I cannot believe that they
are actually going this far with this.  I did apologize today to the
troops, Senator Reid, for you, and for Media Matters for America.  If
anybody in this country has been trying to demoralize the troops, it
is you, sir, and your members of the Democrat Party.  You have waved
the white flag of defeat.  You have claimed that they cannot win.  You
are trying to shift the focus from your perception, the perception,
accurately, that people have of you and your party, to me, who
everyone who has listened to me any length of time whatsoever knows
that these allegations are just totally untrue.  As to why I'm on the
Armed Forces Radio network, it was Senator Clinton's defense
secretary, Les Aspin, who secured an hour of this program on the Armed
Forces Radio network, and because I was requested.  They did a poll of
the troops back then, and the troops requested that this program be on
Armed Forces Radio.  Did you notice in this bite, since I've never
been to combat, I'm not qualified - which is another liberal assault
on free speech.  If you haven't done something, you're not allowed to
talk about it, Senator Reid says.

I have made troop visits to Afghanistan, senator, and I have been to
Walter Reed Army hospital, and I have been to several military bases
after Gulf War one, participating in welcome-home festivities for the
troops coming back from that conflict.  Perhaps I should remind you of
the story, Senator Reid, back in the summer of 2003, I went home one
day and there was a Federal Express package for me.  I didn't
recognize the sender, but I opened it anyway.  Inside, in a Ziploc
bag, was an American flag.  There was a letter written by hand on a
piece of yellow legal paper, and there were five certificates showing
different aircraft.  I read the letter and found out that that flag
had been flown in all five of those aircraft during the original
invasion of Iraq in 2003, in my honor, by each of the five pilots that
piloted those planes.  One was a tanker.  The others were bombers and
attack aircraft.  I looked at this, and I started crying.  Doing this
in my honor?  I doubt, Senator Reid, if this happened and it's
happened a couple times since, that if I were really held in such low
regard by the members of the US facility, this probably wouldn't be
the case.

BREAK TRANSCRIPT

RUSH: We have two more Harry Reid sound bites.  By the way, in the
second sound bite, he refers to my dwindling audience or whatever.  In
his dreams, ladies and gentlemen, is this audience getting smaller.
(Laughing.) There's nothing in any of this that's truthful.  There's
nothing in any of it to believe.  And I would caution you: you know
the truth of this, so listen to it for what this.  Now, I mentioned
earlier he's prepared a letter that he wants to send to the CEO of
Clear Channel Communications, which syndicates this program, and he
wants as many senators as possible to sign it.  Here's the bite
explaining the letter.

REID:  Here is what we wrote: &quot;Dear Mr. Mays.&quot;  Here's the letter, Mr.
President.  &quot;At the time we signed this letter, 3,801 hundred American
soldiers had been killed in Iraq.  Another 27,936 have been wounded.
One hundred and sixty others awoke this morning on foreign sand far
from home to face the danger and uncertainty of another day at war.
Although Americans of goodwill debate the merits of this war, we can
all agree that those who serve with such great courage deserve our
deepest respect and gratitude.

RUSH:  When have they ever have it from you?

REID:  That's why Rush Limbaugh's recent characterization of troops
who oppose the war as &quot;phony soldiers&quot; is an outrage.  Our troops are
fighting and dying to bring to others the freedoms that many take for
granted.  It is unconscionable that Mr. Limbaugh would criticize them
for exercising the fundamental American right to free speech.  We call
on you to publicly repudiate these comments that call into question
their service and sacrifice and ask Mr. Limbaugh to apologize for his
comments.

RUSH:  This is unreal.  All of that bite is unreal.  This is like a
man who has proclaimed the US military incompetent. They cannot win.
The war is over. It shouldn't be fought. He's done everything possible
to demoralize these troops, and now he's trying to turn that around.
They're trying to get that back.  I told you they'd gone over the
cliff.  They're trying to get

Rush offers an insightful, well informed, and well rounded viewpoint
on current affairs. What a gem of media enlightenment. I say Rush for
President. With slogans like &quot;Say it to my face&quot;, rush can't lose.

&gt; day and there was a Federal Express package for me.  I didn't

&gt; bag, was an American flag.  There was a letter written by hand on a
&gt; piece of yellow legal paper, and there were five certificates showing
&gt; different aircraft.  I read the letter and found out that that flag
&gt; had been flown in all five of those aircraft during the original
&gt; invasion of Iraq in 2003, in my honor, by each of the five pilots that
&gt; piloted those planes.  One was a tanker.  The others were bombers and
&gt; attack aircraft.  I looked at this, and I started crying.  Doing this

Rush loves this stuff, hopefully Reid's &quot;denouncement&quot; is tongue in
cheeck  to embarass the Senate regarding the Move On ad. A low-life
like Limbaugh is a waste of time for the US Senate.

&gt; BEGIN TRANSCRIPT

&gt; RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, in the last half hour, Harry Reid took to
&gt; the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
&gt; denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
&gt; phony soldiers business.  He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
&gt; CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
&gt; asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the
&gt; opportunity to demand of my syndicator that I be condemned for
&gt; something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
&gt; The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to
&gt; introduce a resolution this afternoon along the lines of the
&gt; MoveOn.org resolution that was introduced last week, tit-for-tat, they
&gt; want a vote in the House to condemn me, a private citizen, for
&gt; something I did not say.  These people have had three, four days now
&gt; to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
&gt; doesn't matter.  What they are trying to do is flood a false story
&gt; into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
&gt; evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

&gt; This is not just the anatomy of a smear.  There's much more going on
&gt; with this than just smearing me.  There is an attempt, I think, as
&gt; they have done throughout my career, to discredit me.  No matter how
&gt; many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
&gt; many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
&gt; offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
&gt; After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
&gt; excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
&gt; to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
&gt; piece of Ted Kennedy legislation.  There has been no response by
&gt; Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be.  I have
&gt; no clue.  We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
&gt; the Senate this afternoon.  There are four of them, and here is the
&gt; first of the four.

&gt; REID:  Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the
&gt; line.  While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his
&gt; unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore.  During his show last Wednesday,
&gt; Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants.  This one was
&gt; unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
&gt; steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
&gt; by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
&gt; and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic]  This comment was so beyond the
&gt; pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone.  And yet he followed it
&gt; up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a 37-
&gt; year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

&gt; RUSH:  (laughing)  I don't quite know how to deal with this.  I mean,
&gt; it's not a laughing matter, although it is a laughing matter because
&gt; this is such -- you talk about Kafkaesque.  I have just finished an
&gt; interview with Clarence Thomas talking about the lies and stuff spread
&gt; about him during his confirmation hearings, and now I, little old
&gt; private citizen, Rush Limbaugh, the subject of Senate action, the
&gt; subject today of House of Representatives action, all based on a
&gt; purposely told lie, which they know is a lie, and yet they are
&gt; persisting in this.  Followed it up with denials?  I followed it up
&gt; with setting the record straight.  By the way, on my website, folks,
&gt; all of this is there.  It's been up there all weekend, and we added
&gt; something last night that you have to see.

&gt; A week ago today, ABC News, Charlie Gibson, World News Tonight, did a
&gt; feature with Brian Ross, their investigative reporter, on phony
&gt; soldiers!  Last Monday, one week ago today.  I don't see ABC being
&gt; denounced.  Their story was on Jesse MacBeth, the same soldier I was
&gt; talking about one week ago.  That video is up at RushLimbaugh.com, as
&gt; well as an exposé by Brent Bozell's group, the Media Research Center,
&gt; on just who Media Matters for America is.  As to Jack Murtha, I just
&gt; did a story today saying that he has been sued by a soldier for
&gt; calling him a murderer.  I just reported the news today, and yet this
&gt; is reported as an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha.  This is
&gt; Kafkaesque, it's McCarthy-like, and I think I told you this on many
&gt; occasions.  My father would not believe any of this, not because of
&gt; the Senate, he just wouldn't believe that his son has become the focal
&gt; point of Democrats in the House of Representatives in the Senate,
&gt; someone targeted for destruction and smear, as a private citizen.
&gt; Here is number two of Senator Reid.

&gt; REID:  Rush Limbaugh took it upon himself to attack the courage and
&gt; character of those fighting and dying for him and for all of us.  Rush
&gt; Limbaugh got himself a deferment from serving when he was a young
&gt; man.  He never served in uniform.  He never saw in person the extreme
&gt; difficulty of maintaining peace in a foreign country engaged in a
&gt; civil war.  He never saw a person in combat.  Yet he thinks that his
&gt; opinion on the war is worth more than those who have been on the front
&gt; lines.  And what's worse, Limbaugh's show is broadcast on Armed Forces
&gt; Radio, which means that thousands of troops, overseas, and veterans
&gt; here at home, were forced to hear this attack on their patriotism.
&gt; Rush Limbaugh owes the men and women of our armed forces an apology.

&gt; RUSH:  (Laughing.)  He's gotta be a nut.  I cannot believe that they
&gt; are actually going this far with this.  I did apologize today to the
&gt; troops, Senator Reid, for you, and for Media Matters for America.  If
&gt; anybody in this country has been trying to demoralize the troops, it
&gt; is you, sir, and your members of the Democrat Party.  You have waved
&gt; the white flag of defeat.  You have claimed that they cannot win.  You
&gt; are trying to shift the focus from your perception, the perception,
&gt; accurately, that people have of you and your party, to me, who
&gt; everyone who has listened to me any length of time whatsoever knows
&gt; that these allegations are just totally untrue.  As to why I'm on the
&gt; Armed Forces Radio network, it was Senator Clinton's defense
&gt; secretary, Les Aspin, who secured an hour of this program on the Armed
&gt; Forces Radio network, and because I was requested.  They did a poll of
&gt; the troops back then, and the troops requested that this program be on
&gt; Armed Forces Radio.  Did you notice in this bite, since I've never
&gt; been to combat, I'm not qualified - which is another liberal assault
&gt; on free speech.  If you haven't done something, you're not allowed to
&gt; talk about it, Senator Reid says.

&gt; I have made troop visits to Afghanistan, senator, and I have been to
&gt; Walter Reed Army hospital, and I have been to several military bases
&gt; after Gulf War one, participating in welcome-home festivities for the
&gt; troops coming back from that conflict.  Perhaps I should remind you of
&gt; the story, Senator Reid, back in the summer of 2003, I went home one

&gt; attack aircraft.  I looked at this, and I started crying.  Doing this

Ah.

The slime here speaks out.

Rush was speaking, on the radio, about Jesse MacBeth and his ilk of
PHONY SOLDIERS.  Jesse was ushered out of the military in the midst of
his basic training, as unfit to serve.

Jesse then proceeded to  present himself as a purple heart bearing
Iraq veteran speaking our against the War in Iraq.

Jess MacBeth is now serving a 5 month prison sentence for falsely
presenting himself as a military veteran.

&gt; &gt; unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore.  During his show last Wednesday,
&gt; &gt; Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants.  This one was
&gt; &gt; unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
&gt; &gt; steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
&gt; &gt; by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
&gt; &gt; and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic]  This comment was so beyond the
&gt; &gt; pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone.  And yet he followed it
&gt; &gt; up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a 37-
&gt; &gt; year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

&gt; &gt; RUSH:  (laughing)  I don't quite know how to deal with this.  I mean,
&gt; &gt; it's not a laughing matter, although it is a laughing matter because
&gt; &gt; this is such -- you talk about Kafkaesque.  I have just finished an
&gt; &gt; interview with Clarence Thomas talking about the lies and stuff spread
&gt; &gt; about him during his confirmation hearings, and now I, little old
&gt; &gt; private citizen, Rush Limbaugh, the subject of Senate action, the
&gt; &gt; subject today of House of Representatives action, all based on a
&gt; &gt; purposely told lie, which they know is a lie, and yet they are
&gt; &gt; persisting in this.  Followed it up with denials?  I followed it up
&gt; &gt; with setting the record straight.  By the way, on my website, folks,
&gt; &gt; all of this is there.  It's been up there all weekend, and we added
&gt; &gt; something last night that you have to see.

&gt; &gt; A week ago today, ABC News, Charlie Gibson, World News Tonight, did a
&gt; &gt; feature with Brian Ross, their investigative reporter, on phony
&gt; &gt; soldiers!  Last Monday, one week ago today.  I don't see ABC being
&gt; &gt; denounced.  Their story was on Jesse MacBeth, the same soldier I was
&gt; &gt; talking about one week ago.  That video is up at RushLimbaugh.com, as
&gt; &gt; well as an exposé by Brent Bozell's group, the Media Research Center,
&gt; &gt; on just who Media Matters for America is.  As to Jack Murtha, I just
&gt; &gt; did a story today saying that he has been sued by a soldier for
&gt; &gt; calling him a murderer.  I just reported the news today, and yet this
&gt; &gt; is reported as an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha.  This is
&gt; &gt; Kafkaesque, it's McCarthy-like, and I think I told you this on many
&gt; &gt; occasions.  My father would not believe any of this, not because of
&gt; &gt; the Senate, he just wouldn't believe that his son has become the focal
&gt; &gt; point of Democrats in the House of Representatives in the Senate,
&gt; &gt; someone targeted for destruction and smear, as a private citizen.
&gt; &gt; Here is number two of Senator Reid.

&gt; &gt; REID:  Rush Limbaugh took it upon himself to attack the courage and
&gt; &gt; character of those fighting and dying for him and for all of us.  Rush
&gt; &gt; Limbaugh got himself a deferment from serving when he was a young
&gt; &gt; man.  He never served in uniform.  He never saw in person the extreme
&gt; &gt; difficulty of maintaining peace in a foreign country engaged in a
&gt; &gt; civil war.  He never saw a person in combat.  Yet he thinks that his
&gt; &gt; opinion on the war is worth more than those who have been on the front
&gt; &gt; lines.  And what's worse, Limbaugh's show is broadcast on Armed Forces
&gt; &gt; Radio, which means that thousands of troops, overseas, and veterans
&gt; &gt; here at home, were forced to hear this attack on their patriotism.
&gt; &gt; Rush Limbaugh owes the men and women of our armed forces an apology.

&gt; &gt; RUSH:  (Laughing.)  He's gotta be a nut.  I cannot believe that they
&gt; &gt; are actually going this far with this.  I did apologize today to the
&gt; &gt; troops, Senator Reid, for you, and for Media Matters for America.  If
&gt; &gt; anybody in this country has been trying to demoralize the troops, it
&gt; &gt; is you, sir, and your members of the Democrat Party.  You have waved
&gt; &gt; the white flag of defeat.  You have claimed that they cannot win.  You
&gt; &gt; are trying to shift the focus from your perception, the perception,
&gt; &gt; accurately, that people have of you and your party, to me, who
&gt; &gt; everyone who has listened to me any length of time whatsoever knows
&gt; &gt; that these allegations are just totally untrue.  As to why I'm on the
&gt; &gt; Armed Forces Radio network, it was Senator Clinton's defense
&gt; &gt; secretary, Les Aspin, who secured an hour of this program on the Armed
&gt; &gt; Forces Radio network, and because I was requested.  They did a poll of
&gt; &gt; the troops back then, and the troops requested that this program be on
&gt; &gt; Armed Forces Radio.  Did you notice in this bite, since I've never
&gt; &gt; been to combat, I'm not qualified - which is another liberal assault
&gt; &gt; on free speech.  If you haven't done something, you're not allowed to
&gt; &gt; talk about it, Senator Reid says.

&gt; &gt; I have made troop visits to Afghanistan, senator, and I have been to
&gt; &gt; Walter Reed Army hospital, and I have been to several military bases
&gt; &gt; after Gulf War one, participating in welcome-home festivities for the
&gt; &gt; troops coming back from that conflict.  Perhaps I should remind you of
&gt; &gt; the story, Senator Reid, back in the summer of 2003, I went home one
&gt; &gt; day and there was a Federal Express package for me.  I didn't
&gt; &gt; recognize the sender, but I opened it anyway.  Inside, in a Ziploc
&gt; &gt; bag, was an American flag.  There was a letter written by hand on a
&gt; &gt; piece of yellow legal paper, and there were five certificates showing
&gt; &gt; different aircraft.  I read the letter and found out that that flag
&gt; &gt; had been flown in all five of those aircraft during the original
&gt; &gt; invasion of Iraq in 2003, in my honor, by each of the five pilots that
&gt; &gt; piloted those planes.  One was a tanker.  The others were bombers and
&gt; &gt; attack aircraft.  I looked at this, and I started crying.  Doing this
&gt; &gt; in my honor?  I doubt, Senator Reid, if this happened and it's
&gt; &gt; happened a couple times since, that if I were really held in such low
&gt; &gt; regard by the members of the US facility, this probably wouldn't be
&gt; &gt; the case.

&gt; &gt; BREAK TRANSCRIPT

&gt; &gt; RUSH: We have two more Harry Reid sound bites.  By the way, in the
&gt; &gt; second sound bite, he refers to my dwindling audience or whatever.  In
&gt; &gt; his dreams, ladies and gentlemen, is this audience getting smaller.
&gt; &gt; (Laughing.) There's nothing in any of this that's truthful.  There's
&gt; &gt; nothing in any of it to believe.  And I would caution you: you know
&gt; &gt; the truth of this, so listen to it for what this.  Now, I mentioned
&gt; &gt; earlier he's prepared a letter that he wants to send to the CEO of
&gt; &gt; Clear Channel Communications, which syndicates this program, and he
&gt; &gt; wants as many senators as possible to sign it.  Here's the bite
&gt; &gt; explaining the letter.

&gt; &gt; REID:  Here is what we wrote: &quot;Dear Mr. Mays.&quot;  Here's the letter, Mr.
&gt; &gt; President.  &quot;At the time we signed this letter, 3,801 hundred American

It's ironic.  All Rush says is &quot;go listen to it on my web site&quot;....
So dopes will either believe that there is something there that makes
the remark magically disappear, or they actually GO to his website and
increase his unique visitor count and ad revenue

&gt; &gt; BEGIN TRANSCRIPT

&gt; &gt; RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, in the last half hour, Harry Reid took to
&gt; &gt; the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
&gt; &gt; denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
&gt; &gt; phony soldiers business.  He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
&gt; &gt; CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
&gt; &gt; asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the
&gt; &gt; opportunity to demand of my syndicator that I be condemned for
&gt; &gt; something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
&gt; &gt; The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to
&gt; &gt; introduce a resolution this afternoon along the lines of the
&gt; &gt; MoveOn.org resolution that was introduced last week, tit-for-tat, they
&gt; &gt; want a vote in the House to condemn me, a private citizen, for
&gt; &gt; something I did not say.  These people have had three, four days now
&gt; &gt; to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
&gt; &gt; doesn't matter.  What they are trying to do is flood a false story
&gt; &gt; into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
&gt; &gt; evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

&gt; &gt; This is not just the anatomy of a smear.  There's much more going on
&gt; &gt; with this than just smearing me.  There is an attempt, I think, as
&gt; &gt; they have done throughout my career, to discredit me.  No matter how
&gt; &gt; many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
&gt; &gt; many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
&gt; &gt; offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
&gt; &gt; After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
&gt; &gt; excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
&gt; &gt; to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
&gt; &gt; piece of Ted Kennedy legislation.  There has been no response by
&gt; &gt; Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be.  I have
&gt; &gt; no clue.  We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
&gt; &gt; the Senate this afternoon.  There are four of them, and here is the
&gt; &gt; first of the four.

&gt; &gt; REID:  Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the

&gt; &gt; &gt; difficulty of maintaining peace in a foreign country engaged in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; civil war. ?He never saw a person in combat. ?Yet he thinks that his
&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion on the war is worth more than those who have been on the front
&gt; &gt; &gt; lines. ?And what's worse, Limbaugh's show is broadcast on Armed Forces
&gt; &gt; &gt; Radio, which means that thousands of troops, overseas, and veterans
&gt; &gt; &gt; here at home, were forced to hear this attack on their patriotism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rush Limbaugh owes the men and women of our armed forces an apology.

&gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: ?(Laughing.) ?He's gotta be a nut. ?I cannot believe that they
&gt; &gt; &gt; are actually going this far with this. ?I did apologize today to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; troops, Senator Reid, for you, and for Media Matters for America. ?If
&gt; &gt; &gt; anybody in this country has been trying to demoralize the troops, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; is you, sir, and your members of the Democrat Party. ?You have waved
&gt; &gt; &gt; the white flag of defeat. ?You have claimed that they cannot win. ?You
&gt; &gt; &gt; are trying to shift the focus from your perception, the perception,
&gt; &gt; &gt; accurately, that people have of you and your party, to me, who
&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone who has listened to me any length of time whatsoever knows
&gt; &gt; &gt; that these allegations are just totally untrue. ?As to why I'm on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Armed Forces Radio network, it was Senator Clinton's defense
&gt; &gt; &gt; secretary, Les Aspin, who secured an hour of this program on the Armed
&gt; &gt; &gt; Forces Radio network, and because I was requested. ?They did a poll of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the troops back then, and the troops requested that this program be on
&gt; &gt; &gt; Armed Forces Radio. ?Did you notice in this bite, since I've never
&gt; &gt; &gt; been to combat, I'm not qualified - which is another liberal assault
&gt; &gt; &gt; on free speech. ?If you haven't done something, you're not allowed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; talk about it, Senator Reid says.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have made troop visits to Afghanistan, senator, and I have been to
&gt; &gt; &gt; Walter Reed Army hospital, and I have been to several military bases
&gt; &gt; &gt; after Gulf War one, participating in welcome-home festivities for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; troops coming back from that conflict. ?Perhaps I should remind you of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the story, Senator Reid, back in the summer of 2003, I went home one
&gt; &gt; &gt; day and there was a Federal Express package for me. ?I didn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; recognize the sender, but I opened it anyway. ?Inside, in a Ziploc
&gt; &gt; &gt; bag, was an American flag. ?There was a letter written by hand on a
&gt; &gt; &gt; piece of yellow legal paper, and there were five certificates showing
&gt; &gt; &gt; different aircraft. ?I read the letter and found out that that flag
&gt; &gt; &gt; had been flown in all five of those aircraft during the original
&gt; &gt; &gt; invasion of Iraq in 2003, in my honor, by each of the five pilots that
&gt; &gt; &gt; piloted those planes. ?One was a tanker. ?The others were bombers and
&gt; &gt; &gt; attack aircraft. ?I looked at this, and I started crying. ?Doing this
&gt; &gt; &gt; in my honor? ?I doubt, Senator Reid, if this happened and it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; happened a couple times since, that if I were really held in such low
&gt; &gt; &gt; regard by the members of the US facility, this probably wouldn't be
&gt; &gt; &gt; the case.

&gt; &gt; &gt; BREAK TRANSCRIPT

&gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: We have two more Harry Reid sound bites. ?By the way, in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; second sound bite, he refers to my dwindling audience or whatever. ?In
&gt; &gt; &gt; his dreams, ladies and gentlemen, is this audience getting smaller.
&gt; &gt; &gt; (Laughing.) There's nothing in any of this that's truthful. ?There's
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing in any of it to believe. ?And I would caution you: you know

What amazes me most is that so-called &quot;patriotic war veterans&quot; are
defending this guy.  I mean... hasn't he offended the troops just as
much as anybody who criticized Petreaus?   I'd say even more, because
Petreaus chose to insert himself in a political debate in Washington.
The worst these soldiers have done is to voice their opinions.  But
they are still military people... they are still putting their life on
the line for us, aren't they?

So why aren't right-wingers outraged?

I guess this shows that people like Lew ARE actually &quot;Phony Patriots&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BEGIN TRANSCRIPT

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, in the last half hour, Harry Reid took to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phony soldiers business. ?He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opportunity to demand of my syndicator that I be condemned for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduce a resolution this afternoon along the lines of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MoveOn.org resolution that was introduced last week, tit-for-tat, they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; want a vote in the House to condemn me, a private citizen, for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something I did not say. ?These people have had three, four days now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't matter. ?What they are trying to do is flood a false story
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not just the anatomy of a smear. ?There's much more going on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with this than just smearing me. ?There is an attempt, I think, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they have done throughout my career, to discredit me. ?No matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; piece of Ted Kennedy legislation. ?There has been no response by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be. ?I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no clue. ?We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate this afternoon. ?There are four of them, and here is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first of the four.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REID: ?Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line. ?While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore. ?During his show last Wednesday,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants. ?This one was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic] ?This comment was so beyond the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone. ?And yet he followed it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a 37-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: ?(laughing) ?I don't quite know how to deal with this. ?I mean,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's not a laughing matter, although it is a laughing matter because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is such -- you talk about Kafkaesque. ?I have just finished an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interview with Clarence Thomas talking about the lies and stuff spread
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about him during his confirmation hearings, and now I, little old
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; private citizen, Rush Limbaugh, the subject of Senate action, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subject today of House of Representatives action, all based on a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purposely told lie, which they know is a lie, and yet they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persisting in this. ?Followed it up with denials? ?I followed it up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with setting the record straight. ?By the way, on my website, folks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all of this is there. ?It's been up there all weekend, and we added
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something last night that you have to see.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A week ago today, ABC News, Charlie Gibson, World News Tonight, did a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feature with Brian Ross, their investigative reporter, on phony
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soldiers! ?Last Monday, one week ago today. ?I don't see ABC being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denounced. ?Their story was on Jesse MacBeth, the same soldier I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking about one week ago. ?That video is up at RushLimbaugh.com, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well as an expos? by Brent Bozell's group, the Media Research Center,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on just who Media Matters for America is. ?As to Jack Murtha, I just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did a story today saying that he has been sued by a soldier for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calling him a murderer. ?I just reported the news today, and yet this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is reported as an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha. ?This is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kafkaesque, it's McCarthy-like, and I think I told you this on many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occasions. ?My father would not believe any of this, not because of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate, he just wouldn't believe that his son has become the focal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point of Democrats in the House of Representatives in the Senate,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone targeted for destruction and smear, as a private citizen.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is number two of Senator Reid.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REID: ?Rush Limbaugh took it upon himself to attack the courage and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; character of those fighting and dying for him and for all of us. ?Rush

&quot;What's really funny is, they [Iraq war critics] never talk to real
soldiers,&quot; the caller said. &quot;They like to pull these soldiers that
come up out of the blue and talk to the media.&quot;

&quot;The phony soldiers,&quot; Limbaugh then said.

Several Democrats released statements late last week condemning the
remarks, and in a speech on the Senate floor Monday, Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid called the comments &quot;so beyond the pale of decency
that it cannot be left alone.&quot;

&quot;Just as patriotism is the exclusive realm of neither party, taking a
stand against those who spew hate and impugn the integrity of our
troops is a job that belongs to all of us,&quot; Reid said.

&gt; in my honor?  I doubt, Senator Reid, if this happened and it's
&gt; happened a couple times since, that if I were really held in such low
&gt; regard by the members of the US facility, this probably wouldn't be
&gt; the case.

&gt; BREAK TRANSCRIPT

&gt; RUSH: We have two more Harry Reid sound bites.  By the way, in the
&gt; second sound bite, he refers to my dwindling audience or whatever.  In
&gt; his dreams, ladies and gentlemen, is this audience getting smaller.
&gt; (Laughing.) There's nothing in any of this that's truthful.  There's
&gt; nothing in any of it to believe.  And I would caution you: you know
&gt; the truth of this, so listen to it for what this.  Now, I mentioned
&gt; earlier he's prepared a letter that he wants to send to the CEO of
&gt; Clear Channel Communications, which syndicates this program, and he
&gt; wants as many senators as possible to sign it.  Here's the bite
&gt; explaining the letter.

&gt; REID:  Here is what we wrote: &quot;Dear Mr. Mays.&quot;  Here's the letter, Mr.
&gt; President.  &quot;At the time we signed this letter, 3,801 hundred American
&gt; soldiers had been killed in Iraq.  Another 27,936 have been wounded.
&gt; One hundred and sixty others awoke this morning on foreign sand far
&gt; from home to face the danger and uncertainty of another day at war.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BEGIN TRANSCRIPT

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, in the last half hour, Harry Reid took to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phony soldiers business. ?He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opportunity to demand of my syndicator that I be condemned for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduce a resolution this afternoon along the lines of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MoveOn.org resolution that was introduced last week, tit-for-tat, they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; want a vote in the House to condemn me, a private citizen, for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something I did not say. ?These people have had three, four days now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't matter. ?What they are trying to do is flood a false story
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not just the anatomy of a smear. ?There's much more going on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with this than just smearing me. ?There is an attempt, I think, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they have done throughout my career, to discredit me. ?No matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; piece of Ted Kennedy legislation. ?There has been no response by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be. ?I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no clue. ?We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate this afternoon. ?There are four of them, and here is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first of the four.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REID: ?Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line. ?While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore. ?During his show last Wednesday,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants. ?This one was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic] ?This comment was so beyond the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone. ?And yet he followed it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a 37-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: ?(laughing) ?I don't quite know how to deal with this. ?I mean,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's not a laughing matter, although it is a laughing matter because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is such -- you talk about Kafkaesque. ?I have just finished an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interview with Clarence Thomas talking about the lies and stuff spread
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about him during his confirmation hearings, and now I, little old
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; private citizen, Rush Limbaugh, the subject of Senate action, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subject today of House of Representatives action, all based on a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purposely told lie, which they know is a lie, and yet they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persisting in this. ?Followed it up with denials? ?I followed it up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with setting the record straight. ?By the way, on my website, folks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all of this is there. ?It's been up there all weekend, and we added
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something last night that you have to see.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A week ago today, ABC News, Charlie Gibson, World News Tonight, did a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feature with Brian Ross, their investigative reporter, on phony
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soldiers! ?Last Monday, one week ago today. ?I don't see ABC being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denounced. ?Their story was on Jesse MacBeth, the same soldier I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking about one week ago. ?That video is up at RushLimbaugh.com, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well as an expos? by Brent Bozell's group, the Media Research Center,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on just who Media Matters for America is. ?As to Jack Murtha, I just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did a story today saying that he has been sued by a soldier for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calling him a murderer. ?I just reported the news today, and yet this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is reported as an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha. ?This is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kafkaesque, it's McCarthy-like, and I think I told you this on many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occasions. ?My father would not believe any of this, not because of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate, he just wouldn't believe that his son has become the focal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point of Democrats in the House of Representatives in the Senate,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone targeted for destruction and smear, as a private citizen.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is number two of Senator Reid.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REID: ?Rush Limbaugh took it upon himself to attack the courage and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; character of those fighting and dying for him and for all of us. ?Rush
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Limbaugh got himself a deferment from serving when he was a young
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; man. ?He never served in uniform. ?He never saw in person the extreme
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difficulty of maintaining peace in a foreign country engaged in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; civil war. ?He never saw a person in combat. ?Yet he thinks that his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opinion on the war is worth more than those who have been on the front
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lines. ?And what's worse, Limbaugh's show is broadcast on Armed Forces
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Radio, which means that thousands of troops, overseas, and veterans
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here at home, were forced to hear this attack on their patriotism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rush Limbaugh owes the men and women of our armed forces an apology.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: ?(Laughing.) ?He's gotta be a nut. ?I cannot believe that they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are actually going this far with this. ?I did apologize today to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; troops, Senator Reid, for you, and for Media Matters for America. ?If
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anybody in this country has been trying to demoralize the troops, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is you, sir, and your members of the Democrat Party. ?You have waved
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the white flag of defeat. ?You have claimed that they cannot win. ?You
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are trying to shift the focus from your perception, the perception,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accurately, that people have of you and your party, to me, who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone who has listened to me any length of time whatsoever knows
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that these allegations are just totally untrue. ?As to why I'm on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Armed Forces Radio network, it was Senator Clinton's defense
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; secretary, Les Aspin, who secured an hour of this program on the Armed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Forces Radio network, and because I was requested. ?They did a poll of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the troops back then, and the troops requested that this program be on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Armed Forces Radio. ?Did you notice in this bite, since I've never
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been to combat, I'm not qualified - which is another liberal assault
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on free speech. ?If you haven't done something, you're not allowed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talk about it, Senator Reid says.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have made troop visits to Afghanistan, senator, and I have been to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Walter Reed Army hospital, and I have been to several military bases
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after Gulf War one, participating in welcome-home festivities for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; troops coming back from that conflict. ?Perhaps I should remind you of

Think Reid will have the guts to accuse Rush Limbaugh on Limbaugh's
own radio program???

OR

Iis Reid only brave enough to do it on the Senate Flo, surrounded bu
guards,  with TV cameras, leaving Rush NO right of rebuttal  in a
public forum.

How does one defend themslves against personal attack from their
&quot;paid servants?&quot;

DEMOCRATS are FASCISTS???????

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kafkaesque, it's McCarthy-like, and I think I told you this on many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occasions. ?My father would not believe any of this, not because of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate, he just wouldn't believe that his son has become the focal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point of Democrats in the House of Representatives in the Senate,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone targeted for destruction and smear, as a private citizen.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is number two of Senator Reid.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REID: ?Rush Limbaugh took it upon himself to attack the courage and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; character of those fighting and dying for him and for all of us. ?Rush
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Limbaugh got himself a deferment from serving when he was a young
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; man. ?He never served in uniform. ?He never saw in person the extreme
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difficulty of maintaining peace in a foreign country engaged in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; civil war. ?He never saw a person in combat. ?Yet he thinks that his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opinion on the war is worth more than those who have been on the front
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lines. ?And what's worse, Limbaugh's show is broadcast on Armed Forces
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Radio, which means that thousands of troops, overseas, and veterans
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here at home, were forced to hear this attack on their patriotism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rush Limbaugh owes the men and women of our armed forces an apology.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: ?(Laughing.) ?He's gotta be a nut. ?I cannot believe that they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are actually going this far with this. ?I did apologize today to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; troops, Senator Reid, for you, and for Media Matters for America. ?If
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anybody in this country has been trying to demoralize the troops, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is you, sir, and your members of the Democrat Party. ?You have waved
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the white flag of defeat. ?You have claimed that they cannot win. ?You
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are trying to shift the focus from your perception, the perception,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accurately, that people have of you and your party, to me, who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone who has listened to me any length of time whatsoever knows
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that these allegations are just totally untrue. ?As to why I'm on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Armed Forces Radio network, it was Senator Clinton's defense
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; secretary, Les Aspin, who secured an hour of this program on the Armed

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ?Audio clips available for Rush 24/7 members only -- Join Now!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BEGIN TRANSCRIPT

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, in the last half hour, Harry Reid took to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phony soldiers business. ?He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opportunity to demand of my syndicator that I be condemned for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduce a resolution this afternoon along the lines of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MoveOn.org resolution that was introduced last week, tit-for-tat, they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; want a vote in the House to condemn me, a private citizen, for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something I did not say. ?These people have had three, four days now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't matter. ?What they are trying to do is flood a false story
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not just the anatomy of a smear. ?There's much more going on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with this than just smearing me. ?There is an attempt, I think, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they have done throughout my career, to discredit me. ?No matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; piece of Ted Kennedy legislation. ?There has been no response by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be. ?I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no clue. ?We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate this afternoon. ?There are four of them, and here is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first of the four.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REID: ?Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line. ?While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore. ?During his show last Wednesday,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants. ?This one was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic] ?This comment was so beyond the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone. ?And yet he followed it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a 37-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: ?(laughing) ?I don't quite know how to deal with this. ?I mean,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's not a laughing matter, although it is a laughing matter because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is such -- you talk about Kafkaesque. ?I have just finished an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interview with Clarence Thomas talking about the lies and stuff spread
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about him during his confirmation hearings, and now I, little old
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; private citizen, Rush Limbaugh, the subject of Senate action, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subject today of House of Representatives action, all based on a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purposely told lie, which they know is a lie, and yet they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persisting in this. ?Followed it up with denials? ?I followed it up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with setting the record straight. ?By the way, on my website, folks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all of this is there. ?It's been up there all weekend, and we added
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something last night that you have to see.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A week ago today, ABC News, Charlie Gibson, World News Tonight, did a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feature with Brian Ross, their investigative reporter, on phony
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soldiers! ?Last Monday, one week ago today. ?I don't see ABC being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denounced. ?Their story was on Jesse MacBeth, the same soldier I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking about one week ago. ?That video is up at RushLimbaugh.com, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well as an expos? by Brent Bozell's group, the Media Research Center,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on just who Media Matters for America is. ?As to Jack Murtha, I just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did a story today saying that he has been sued by a soldier for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calling him a murderer. ?I just reported the news today, and yet this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is reported as an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha. ?This is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kafkaesque, it's McCarthy-like, and I think I told you this on many

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is number two of Senator Reid.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REID: ?Rush Limbaugh took it upon himself to attack the courage and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; character of those fighting and dying for him and for all of us. ?Rush

Today is October 1.

Harry Reid has not offered to come with the proff of his accusations
and present them on Rush Limbaugh's program
- face to face.  Guess he would rather do it fom 800 miles away on the
floor of the Senate where he is protected.

Harry Reid is a phony Senator? We pay thi man's salary through our
taxes.

Why doesn't this coward resign???

We lost the SURGE before it ever began?????

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't matter. ?What they are trying to do is flood a false story

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not just the anatomy of a smear. ?There's much more going on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with this than just smearing me. ?There is an attempt, I think, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they have done throughout my career, to discredit me. ?No matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; piece of Ted Kennedy legislation. ?There has been no response by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be. ?I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no clue. ?We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate this afternoon. ?There are four of them, and here is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first of the four.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REID: ?Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line. ?While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore. ?During his show last Wednesday,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants. ?This one was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic] ?This comment was so beyond the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone. ?And yet he followed it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a 37-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: ?(laughing) ?I don't quite know how to deal with this. ?I mean,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phony soldiers business. ?He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to

&gt; &gt; Harry Reid has not offered to come with the proff of his accusations
&gt; &gt; and present them on Rush Limbaugh's program

&gt; &gt; floor of the Senate where he is protected.

&gt; &gt; Harry Reid is a phony Senator? We pay thi man's salary through our

&gt; &gt;  Why doesn't this coward resign???

&gt; &gt; We lost the SURGE before it ever began?????

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, in the last half hour, Harry Reid took to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phony soldiers business. ?He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opportunity to demand of my syndicator that I be condemned for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduce a resolution this afternoon along the lines of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MoveOn.org resolution that was introduced last week, tit-for-tat, they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; want a vote in the House to condemn me, a private citizen, for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something I did not say. ?These people have had three, four days now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't matter. ?What they are trying to do is flood a false story
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not just the anatomy of a smear. ?There's much more going on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with this than just smearing me. ?There is an attempt, I think, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they have done throughout my career, to discredit me. ?No matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; piece of Ted Kennedy legislation. ?There has been no response by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be. ?I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no clue. ?We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate this afternoon. ?There are four of them, and here is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first of the four.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REID: ?Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line. ?While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore. ?During his show last Wednesday,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants. ?This one was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic] ?This comment was so beyond the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone. ?And yet he followed it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a 37-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: ?(laughing) ?I don't quite know how to deal with this. ?I mean,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's not a laughing matter, although it is a laughing matter because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is such -- you talk about Kafkaesque. ?I have just finished an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interview with Clarence Thomas talking about the lies and stuff spread
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about him during his confirmation hearings, and now I, little old
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; private citizen, Rush Limbaugh, the subject of Senate action, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subject today of House of Representatives action, all based on a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purposely told lie, which they know is a lie, and yet they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persisting in this. ?Followed it up with denials? ?I followed it up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with setting the record straight. ?By the way, on my website, folks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all of this is there. ?It's been up there all weekend, and we added
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something last night that you have to see.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A week ago today, ABC News, Charlie Gibson, World News Tonight, did a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feature with Brian Ross, their investigative reporter, on phony
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soldiers! ?Last Monday, one week ago today. ?I don't see ABC being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denounced. ?Their story was on Jesse MacBeth, the same soldier I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking about one week ago. ?That video is up at RushLimbaugh.com, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well as an expos? by Brent Bozell's group, the Media Research Center,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on just who Media Matters for America is. ?As to Jack Murtha, I just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did a story today saying that he has been sued by a soldier for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calling him a murderer. ?I just reported the news today, and yet this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is reported as an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha. ?This is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kafkaesque, it's McCarthy-like, and I think I told you this on many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occasions. ?My father would not believe any of this, not because of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate, he just wouldn't believe that his son has become the focal

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, in the last half hour, Harry Reid took to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phony soldiers business. ?He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opportunity to demand of my syndicator that I be condemned for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduce a resolution this afternoon along the lines of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MoveOn.org resolution that was introduced last week, tit-for-tat, they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; want a vote in the House to condemn me, a private citizen, for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something I did not say. ?These people have had three, four days now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't matter. ?What they are trying to do is flood a false story
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not just the anatomy of a smear. ?There's much more going on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with this than just smearing me. ?There is an attempt, I think, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they have done throughout my career, to discredit me. ?No matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; piece of Ted Kennedy legislation. ?There has been no response by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be. ?I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no clue. ?We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate this afternoon. ?There are four of them, and here is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first of the four.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REID: ?Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line. ?While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore. ?During his show last Wednesday,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants. ?This one was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic] ?This comment was so beyond the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone. ?And yet he followed it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a 37-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: ?(laughing) ?I don't quite know how to deal with this. ?I mean,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, in the last half hour, Harry Reid took to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phony soldiers business. ?He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opportunity to demand of my syndicator that I be condemned for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduce a resolution this afternoon along the lines of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MoveOn.org resolution that was introduced last week, tit-for-tat, they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; want a vote in the House to condemn me, a private citizen, for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something I did not say. ?These people have had three, four days now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't matter. ?What they are trying to do is flood a false story
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not just the anatomy of a smear. ?There's much more going on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with this than just smearing me. ?There is an attempt, I think, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they have done throughout my career, to discredit me. ?No matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; piece of Ted Kennedy legislation. ?There has been no response by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be. ?I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no clue. ?We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate this afternoon. ?There are four of them, and here is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first of the four.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REID: ?Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line. ?While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore. ?During his show last Wednesday,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants. ?This one was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic] ?This comment was so beyond the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone. ?And yet he followed it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a 37-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: ?(laughing) ?I don't quite know how to deal with this. ?I mean,

[ Reid was born in the small mining town of Searchlight, Nevada to
Inez and Harry V. Reid.[2] Reid attended Basic High School in
Henderson, Nevada. Mike O'Callaghan, future Governor of Nevada and
Reid's history teacher, coached Reid in boxing at the Henderson Boys'
Club.[3] Reid's friends in Searchlight dubbed him &quot;Pinky&quot; because of
his fair complexion.[4]

Reid received his A.S. from Southern Utah State College in 1959 and in
1961 earned his B.S. from Utah State University. He moved to
Washington, D.C. and worked as an officer for the U.S. Capitol Police
while attending George Washington University for his law degree. Reid
graduated in 1964 and returned to Nevada to work as a lawyer before
entering politics. Reid is married to Landra Gould.[5] Reid and his
wife have five children, one of whom, Rory Reid, is an elected
Commissioner for Clark County, Nevada, and another who recently ran
for municipal office in Cottonwood Heights, Utah.[6]

Reid is a converted member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints[7]. He stated in an interview with Brigham Young University's
Daily Universe that &quot;I think it is much easier to be a good member of
the Church and a Democrat than a good member of the Church and a
Republican.&quot; He went on to say that the Democrats' emphasis on helping
others, as opposed to what he considers Republican dogma to the
contrary, as the reason he's a Democrat.[8] ]

&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

&gt; &gt; RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, in the last half hour, Harry Reid took to
&gt; &gt; the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
&gt; &gt; denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
&gt; &gt; phony soldiers business.  He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
&gt; &gt; CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
&gt; &gt; asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the
&gt; &gt; opportunity to demand of my syndicator that I be condemned for
&gt; &gt; something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
&gt; &gt; The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to
&gt; &gt; introduce a resolution this afternoon along the lines of the
&gt; &gt; MoveOn.org resolution that was introduced last week, tit-for-tat, they
&gt; &gt; want a vote in the House to condemn me, a private citizen, for
&gt; &gt; something I did not say.  These people have had three, four days now
&gt; &gt; to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
&gt; &gt; doesn't matter.  What they are trying to do is flood a false story
&gt; &gt; into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
&gt; &gt; evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

&gt; &gt; This is not just the anatomy of a smear.  There's much more going on
&gt; &gt; with this than just smearing me.  There is an attempt, I think, as
&gt; &gt; they have done throughout my career, to discredit me.  No matter how
&gt; &gt; many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
&gt; &gt; many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
&gt; &gt; offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
&gt; &gt; After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
&gt; &gt; excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
&gt; &gt; to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
&gt; &gt; piece of Ted Kennedy legislation.  There has been no response by
&gt; &gt; Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be.  I have
&gt; &gt; no clue.  We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
&gt; &gt; the Senate this afternoon.  There are four of them, and here is the
&gt; &gt; first of the four.

&gt; &gt; REID:  Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the
&gt; &gt; line.  While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his
&gt; &gt; unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore.  During his show last Wednesday,
&gt; &gt; Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants.  This one was
&gt; &gt; unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
&gt; &gt; steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
&gt; &gt; by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
&gt; &gt; and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic]  This comment was so beyond the
&gt; &gt; pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone.  And yet he followed it
&gt; &gt; up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a 37-
&gt; &gt; year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

&gt; &gt; RUSH:  (laughing)  I don't quite know how to deal with this.  I mean,
&gt; &gt; it's not a laughing matter, although it is a laughing matter because
&gt; &gt; this is such -- you talk about Kafkaesque.  I have just finished an
&gt; &gt; interview with Clarence Thomas talking about the lies and stuff spread
&gt; &gt; about him during his confirmation hearings, and now I, little old
&gt; &gt; private citizen, Rush Limbaugh, the subject of Senate action, the
&gt; &gt; subject today of House of Representatives action, all based on a
&gt; &gt; purposely told lie, which they know is a lie, and yet they are
&gt; &gt; persisting in this.  Followed it up with denials?  I followed it up
&gt; &gt; with setting the record straight.  By the way, on my website, folks,
&gt; &gt; all of this is there.  It's been up there all weekend, and we added
&gt; &gt; something last night that you have to see.

&gt; &gt; A week ago today, ABC News, Charlie Gibson, World News Tonight, did a
&gt; &gt; feature with Brian Ross, their investigative reporter, on phony
&gt; &gt; soldiers!  Last Monday, one week ago today.  I don't see ABC being
&gt; &gt; denounced.  Their story was on Jesse MacBeth, the same soldier I was
&gt; &gt; talking about one week ago.  That video is up at RushLimbaugh.com, as
&gt; &gt; well as an exposé by Brent Bozell's group, the Media Research Center,
&gt; &gt; on just who Media Matters for America is.  As to Jack Murtha, I just
&gt; &gt; did a story today saying that he has been sued by a soldier for
&gt; &gt; calling him a murderer.  I just reported the news today, and yet this
&gt; &gt; is reported as an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha.  This is
&gt; &gt; Kafkaesque, it's McCarthy-like, and I think I told you this on many
&gt; &gt; occasions.  My father would not believe any of this, not because of
&gt; &gt; the Senate, he just wouldn't believe that his son has become the focal
&gt; &gt; point of Democrats in the House of Representatives in the Senate,
&gt; &gt; someone targeted for destruction and smear, as a private citizen.
&gt; &gt; Here is number two of Senator Reid.

&gt; &gt; REID:  Rush Limbaugh took it upon himself to attack the courage and
&gt; &gt; character of those fighting and dying for him and for all of us.  Rush
&gt; &gt; Limbaugh got himself a deferment from serving when he was a young
&gt; &gt; man.  He never served in uniform.  He never saw in person the extreme
&gt; &gt; difficulty of maintaining peace in a foreign country engaged in a
&gt; &gt; civil war.  He never saw a person in combat.  Yet he thinks that his
&gt; &gt; opinion on the war is worth more than those who have been on the front
&gt; &gt; lines.  And what's worse, Limbaugh's show is broadcast on Armed Forces
&gt; &gt; Radio, which means that thousands of troops, overseas, and veterans
&gt; &gt; here at home, were forced to hear this attack on their patriotism.
&gt; &gt; Rush Limbaugh owes the men and women of our armed forces an apology.

&gt; &gt; RUSH:  (Laughing.)  He's gotta be a nut.  I cannot believe that they
&gt; &gt; are actually going this far with this.  I did apologize today to the
&gt; &gt; troops, Senator Reid, for you, and for Media Matters for America.  If
&gt; &gt; anybody in this country has been trying to demoralize the troops, it
&gt; &gt; is you, sir, and your members of the Democrat Party.  You have waved
&gt; &gt; the white flag of defeat.  You have claimed that they cannot win.  You
&gt; &gt; are trying to shift the focus from your perception, the perception,
&gt; &gt; accurately, that people have of you and your party, to me, who
&gt; &gt; everyone who has listened to me any length of time whatsoever knows
&gt; &gt; that these allegations are just totally untrue.  As to why I'm on the
&gt; &gt; Armed Forces Radio network, it was Senator Clinton's defense
&gt; &gt; secretary, Les Aspin, who secured an hour of this program on the Armed
&gt; &gt; Forces Radio network, and because I was requested.  They did a poll of
&gt; &gt; the troops back then, and the troops requested that this program be on
&gt; &gt; Armed Forces Radio.  Did you notice in this bite, since I've never
&gt; &gt; been to combat, I'm not qualified - which is another liberal assault
&gt; &gt; on free speech.  If you haven't done something, you're not allowed to
&gt; &gt; talk about it, Senator Reid says.

&gt; &gt; I have made troop visits to Afghanistan, senator, and I have been to
&gt; &gt; Walter Reed Army hospital, and I have been to several military bases
&gt; &gt; after Gulf War one, participating in welcome-home festivities for the
&gt; &gt; troops coming back from that conflict.  Perhaps I should remind you of
&gt; &gt; the story, Senator Reid, back in the summer of 2003, I went home one
&gt; &gt; day and there was a Federal Express package for me.  I didn't
&gt; &gt; recognize the sender, but I opened it anyway.  Inside, in a Ziploc
&gt; &gt; bag, was an American flag.  There was a letter written by hand on a
&gt; &gt; piece of yellow legal paper, and there were five certificates showing
&gt; &gt; different aircraft.  I read the letter and found out that that flag

Why didn't Harry Reid attack Charles Gibson of ABC News who first
introduced the story of PHONY SOLDIERS two days before Rush Limbaugh
referred to the exact same story on his radio program.

Why did Sen. Tom Harkin, himself a PHONY VIETNAM VET attack Rush
Limbaugh about his attack on phony vets???  Harkin advertised himself,
when running for office as a Vietnam Vet and never got closer to
Vietnam than Japan.

He then changed his &quot;tune&quot; to Vietnam Era Vet. when caught in HIS LIE.

You mean like you're doing right now, I call him a liar because he is
a liar. Look at the posts he has made, it gets tiresome to answer his
nonsense over and over. You enjoy seeing him do it and it seems you
are tending toward his mode of operation. Ye see creech, answering
peoples arguments depend a lot on the people. First they have to have
an argument that makes sense and has some reason for being.  Defending
druggie limbo is very very low on the list.

Thanks for the info tho.

&gt; &gt; &gt; want a vote in the House to condemn me, a private citizen, for
&gt; &gt; &gt; something I did not say.  These people have had three, four days now
&gt; &gt; &gt; to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't matter.  What they are trying to do is flood a false story
&gt; &gt; &gt; into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is not just the anatomy of a smear.  There's much more going on
&gt; &gt; &gt; with this than just smearing me.  There is an attempt, I think, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; they have done throughout my career, to discredit me.  No matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
&gt; &gt; &gt; offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
&gt; &gt; &gt; After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
&gt; &gt; &gt; excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
&gt; &gt; &gt; to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
&gt; &gt; &gt; piece of Ted Kennedy legislation.  There has been no response by
&gt; &gt; &gt; Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be.  I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; no clue.  We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate this afternoon.  There are four of them, and here is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; first of the four.

&gt; &gt; &gt; REID:  Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the
&gt; &gt; &gt; line.  While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his
&gt; &gt; &gt; unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore.  During his show last Wednesday,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants.  This one was
&gt; &gt; &gt; unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
&gt; &gt; &gt; by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic]  This comment was so beyond the
&gt; &gt; &gt; pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone.  And yet he followed it
&gt; &gt; &gt; up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a 37-
&gt; &gt; &gt; year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

&gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH:  (laughing)  I don't quite know how to deal with this.  I mean,
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's not a laughing matter, although it is a laughing matter because
&gt; &gt; &gt; this is such -- you talk about Kafkaesque.  I have just finished an
&gt; &gt; &gt; interview with Clarence Thomas talking about the lies and stuff spread
&gt; &gt; &gt; about him during his confirmation hearings, and now I, little old
&gt; &gt; &gt; private citizen, Rush Limbaugh, the subject of Senate action, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; subject today of House of Representatives action, all based on a
&gt; &gt; &gt; purposely told lie, which they know is a lie, and yet they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; persisting in this.  Followed it up with denials?  I followed it up
&gt; &gt; &gt; with setting the record straight.  By the way, on my website, folks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; all of this is there.  It's been up there all weekend, and we added
&gt; &gt; &gt; something last night that you have to see.

&gt; &gt; &gt; A week ago today, ABC News, Charlie Gibson, World News Tonight, did a
&gt; &gt; &gt; feature with Brian Ross, their investigative reporter, on phony
&gt; &gt; &gt; soldiers!  Last Monday, one week ago today.  I don't see ABC being
&gt; &gt; &gt; denounced.  Their story was on Jesse MacBeth, the same soldier I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; talking about one week ago.  That video is up at RushLimbaugh.com, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; well as an exposé by Brent Bozell's group, the Media Research Center,
&gt; &gt; &gt; on just who Media Matters for America is.  As to Jack Murtha, I just
&gt; &gt; &gt; did a story today saying that he has been sued by a soldier for
&gt; &gt; &gt; calling him a murderer.  I just reported the news today, and yet this
&gt; &gt; &gt; is reported as an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha.  This is
&gt; &gt; &gt; Kafkaesque, it's McCarthy-like, and I think I told you this on many
&gt; &gt; &gt; occasions.  My father would not believe any of this, not because of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate, he just wouldn't believe that his son has become the focal
&gt; &gt; &gt; point of Democrats in the House of Representatives in the Senate,
&gt; &gt; &gt; someone targeted for destruction and smear, as a private citizen.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is number two of Senator Reid.

&gt; &gt; &gt; REID:  Rush Limbaugh took it upon himself to attack the courage and
&gt; &gt; &gt; character of those fighting and dying for him and for all of us.  Rush
&gt; &gt; &gt; Limbaugh got himself a deferment from serving when he was a young
&gt; &gt; &gt; man.  He never served in uniform.  He never saw in person the extreme
&gt; &gt; &gt; difficulty of maintaining peace in a foreign country engaged in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; civil war.  He never saw a person in combat.  Yet he thinks that his
&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion on the war is worth more than those who have been on the front
&gt; &gt; &gt; lines.  And what's worse, Limbaugh's show is broadcast on Armed Forces
&gt; &gt; &gt; Radio, which means that thousands of troops, overseas, and veterans
&gt; &gt; &gt; here at home, were forced to hear this attack on their patriotism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rush Limbaugh owes the men and women of our armed forces an apology.

&gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH:  (Laughing.)  He's gotta be a nut.  I cannot believe that they
&gt; &gt; &gt; are actually going this far with this.  I did apologize today to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; troops, Senator Reid, for you, and for Media Matters for America.  If
&gt; &gt; &gt; anybody in this country has been trying to demoralize the troops, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; is you, sir, and your members of the Democrat Party.  You have waved
&gt; &gt; &gt; the white flag of defeat.  You have claimed that they cannot win.  You
&gt; &gt; &gt; are trying to shift the focus from your perception, the perception,
&gt; &gt; &gt; accurately, that people have of you and your party, to me, who
&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone who has listened to me any length of time whatsoever knows
&gt; &gt; &gt; that these allegations are just totally untrue.  As to why I'm on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Armed Forces Radio network, it was Senator Clinton's defense
&gt; &gt; &gt; secretary, Les Aspin, who secured an hour of this program on the Armed
&gt; &gt; &gt; Forces Radio network, and because I was requested.  They did a poll of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the troops back then, and the troops requested that this program be on
&gt; &gt; &gt; Armed Forces Radio.  Did you notice in this bite, since I've never
&gt; &gt; &gt; been to combat, I'm not qualified - which is another liberal assault

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BEGIN TRANSCRIPT

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, in the last half hour, Harry Reid took to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phony soldiers business.  He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opportunity to demand of my syndicator that I be condemned for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduce a resolution this afternoon along the lines of the

Reid never accused any troops of being incompetent; he noted Bush's
incompetence, and Bush's Generals' failures. Not really big news, as
anyone over the age of ten sees it. Nor is Rush being accused; he said
it, he wants to slither away from it. Typical scumbag druggie denial.

It's funny that Cheech would bring the &quot;Ad Hominem&quot; stuff to a debate
about Rush.  I mean, ad hominems is ALL these guys use.  If anybody
says the war is going bad, they call him a &quot;troop hater&quot;.  If somebody
talks about solving insurance issues, they call him a &quot;socialist&quot;.  If
somebody else talks about defending the right to privacy, they call
him a &quot;terrorist supporter&quot;....

They NEVER refer to the issues.   They just &quot;tag&quot; you, and never
address your arguments.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something I did not say.  These people have had three, four days now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't matter.  What they are trying to do is flood a false story
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not just the anatomy of a smear.  There's much more going on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with this than just smearing me.  There is an attempt, I think, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they have done throughout my career, to discredit me.  No matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; piece of Ted Kennedy legislation.  There has been no response by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be.  I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no clue.  We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate this afternoon.  There are four of them, and here is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first of the four.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REID:  Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line.  While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore.  During his show last Wednesday,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants.  This one was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic]  This comment was so beyond the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone.  And yet he followed it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a 37-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH:  (laughing)  I don't quite know how to deal with this.  I mean,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's not a laughing matter, although it is a laughing matter because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is such -- you talk about Kafkaesque.  I have just finished an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interview with Clarence Thomas talking about the lies and stuff spread
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about him during his confirmation hearings, and now I, little old
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; private citizen, Rush Limbaugh, the subject of Senate action, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subject today of House of Representatives action, all based on a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purposely told lie, which they know is a lie, and yet they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persisting in this.  Followed it up with denials?  I followed it up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with setting the record straight.  By the way, on my website, folks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all of this is there.  It's been up there all weekend, and we added
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something last night that you have to see.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A week ago today, ABC News, Charlie Gibson, World News Tonight, did a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feature with Brian Ross, their investigative reporter, on phony
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soldiers!  Last Monday, one week ago today.  I don't see ABC being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denounced.  Their story was on Jesse MacBeth, the same soldier I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking about one week ago.  That video is up at RushLimbaugh.com, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well as an exposé by Brent Bozell's group, the Media Research Center,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on just who Media Matters for America is.  As to Jack Murtha, I just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did a story today saying that he has been sued by a soldier for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calling him a murderer.  I just reported the news today, and yet this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is reported as an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha.  This is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kafkaesque, it's McCarthy-like, and I think I told you this on many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occasions.  My father would not believe any of this, not because of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Senate, he just wouldn't believe that his son has become the focal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point of Democrats in the House of Representatives in the Senate,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone targeted for destruction and smear, as a private citizen.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is number two of Senator Reid.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REID:  Rush Limbaugh took it upon himself to attack the courage and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; character of those fighting and dying for him and for all of us.  Rush
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Limbaugh got himself a deferment from serving when he was a young
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; man.  He never served in uniform.  He never saw in person the extreme
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difficulty of maintaining peace in a foreign country engaged in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; civil war.  He never saw a person in combat.  Yet he thinks that his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opinion on the war is worth more than those who have been on the front
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lines.  And what's worse, Limbaugh's show is broadcast on Armed Forces
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Radio, which means that thousands of troops, overseas, and veterans
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here at home, were forced to hear this attack on their patriotism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rush Limbaugh owes the men and women of our armed forces an apology.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUSH:  (Laughing.)  He's gotta be a nut.  I cannot believe that they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are actually going this far with this.  I did apologize today to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; troops, Senator Reid, for you, and for Media Matters for America.  If
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anybody in this country has been trying to demoralize the troops, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is you, sir, and your members of the Democrat Party.  You have waved
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the white flag of

Yes; it is absolutely sarcasm (which doesn't always come across well
in text). I have been smoking American Spirit's lately; a fine tobacco
out of New Mexico; that could explain some of my non sense sarcasm.

I tire of observing support for a radio personality over an elected
statesman (I may be using the term loosely, but..). Can't people tell
the difference between public servant and public jester? I'm literally
at a loss of words which eventually leads to weakened and apathetic
sarcasm.

The elected statesman should have to face the person he is accusing
and prove his case with facts.  The accused has the right to a
defense..

That would be fine if limbo had to face the people he accuses and
prove his case with facts. limbo has no facts, he has the following of
simpleminded fools like you that will believe anything as long as it
isn't true. Did you read &quot;rush limbaugh is a big fat liar&quot;? limbo
didn't contest any of that book.

&gt;  Rush's Challenge to Senator Reid

&gt; October 1, 2007

&gt; Listen To It!  WMP | RealPlayer

&gt;  Audio clips available for Rush 24/7 members only -- Join Now!

&gt; BEGIN TRANSCRIPT

&gt; RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, in the last half hour, Harry Reid took to
&gt; the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
&gt; denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
&gt; phony soldiers business.  He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
&gt; CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
&gt; asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the
&gt; opportunity to demand of my syndicator that I be condemned for
&gt; something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
&gt; The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to
&gt; introduce a resolution this afternoon along the lines of the
&gt; MoveOn.org resolution that was introduced last week, tit-for-tat, they
&gt; want a vote in the House to condemn me, a private citizen, for
&gt; something I did not say.  These people have had three, four days now
&gt; to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
&gt; doesn't matter.  What they are trying to do is flood a false story
&gt; into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
&gt; evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

&gt; This is not just the anatomy of a smear.  There's much more going on
&gt; with this than just smearing me.  There is an attempt, I think, as
&gt; they have done throughout my career, to discredit me.  No matter how
&gt; many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
&gt; many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
&gt; offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
&gt; After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
&gt; excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
&gt; to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
&gt; piece of Ted Kennedy legislation.  There has been no response by
&gt; Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be.  I have
&gt; no clue.  We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
&gt; the Senate this afternoon.  There are four of them, and here is the
&gt; first of the four.

&gt; REID:  Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the
&gt; line.  While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his
&gt; unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore.  During his show last Wednesday,
&gt; Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants.  This one was
&gt; unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
&gt; steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
&gt; by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
&gt; and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic]  This comment was so beyond the
&gt; pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone.  And yet he followed it
&gt; up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a 37-
&gt; year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

&gt; RUSH:  (laughing)  I don't quite know how to deal with this.  I mean,
&gt; it's not a laughing matter, although it is a laughing matter because
&gt; this is such -- you talk about Kafkaesque.  I have just finished an
&gt; interview with Clarence Thomas talking about the lies and stuff spread
&gt; about him during his confirmation hearings, and now I, little old
&gt; private citizen, Rush Limbaugh, the subject of Senate action, the
&gt; subject today of House of Representatives action, all based on a
&gt; purposely told lie, which they know is a lie, and yet they are
&gt; persisting in this.  Followed it up with denials?  I followed it up
&gt; with setting the record straight.  By the way, on my website, folks,
&gt; all of this is there.  It's been up there all weekend, and we added
&gt; something last night that you have to see.

&gt; A week ago today, ABC News, Charlie Gibson, World News Tonight, did a
&gt; feature with Brian Ross, their investigative reporter, on phony
&gt; soldiers!  Last Monday, one week ago today.  I don't see ABC being
&gt; denounced.  Their story was on Jesse MacBeth, the same soldier I was
&gt; talking about one week ago.  That video is up at RushLimbaugh.com, as
&gt; well as an exposé by Brent Bozell's group, the Media Research Center,
&gt; on just who Media Matters for America is.  As to Jack Murtha, I just
&gt; did a story today saying that he has been sued by a soldier for
&gt; calling him a murderer.  I just reported the news today, and yet this
&gt; is reported as an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha.  This is
&gt; Kafkaesque, it's McCarthy-like, and I think I told you this on many
&gt; occasions.  My father would not believe any of this, not because of
&gt; the Senate, he just wouldn't believe that his son has become the focal
&gt; point of Democrats in the House of Representatives in the Senate,
&gt; someone targeted for destruction and smear, as a private citizen.
&gt; Here is number two of Senator Reid.

&gt; REID:  Rush Limbaugh took it upon himself to attack the courage and
&gt; character of those fighting and dying for him and for all of us.  Rush
&gt; Limbaugh got himself a deferment from serving when he was a young
&gt; man.  He never served in uniform.  He never saw in person the extreme
&gt; difficulty of maintaining peace in a foreign country engaged in a
&gt; civil war.  He never saw a person in combat.  Yet he thinks that his
&gt; opinion on the war is worth more than those who have been on the front
&gt; lines.  And what's worse, Limbaugh's show is broadcast on Armed Forces
&gt; Radio, which means that thousands of troops, overseas, and veterans
&gt; here at home, were forced to hear this attack on their patriotism.
&gt; Rush Limbaugh owes the men and women of our armed forces an apology.

&gt; RUSH:  (Laughing.)  He's gotta be a nut.  I cannot believe that they
&gt; are actually going this far with this.  I did apologize today to the
&gt; troops, Senator Reid, for you, and for Media Matters for America.  If
&gt; anybody in this country has been trying to demoralize the troops, it
&gt; is you, sir, and your members of the Democrat Party.  You have waved
&gt; the white flag of defeat.  You have claimed that they cannot win.  You
&gt; are trying to shift the focus from your perception, the perception,
&gt; accurately, that people have of you and your party, to me, who
&gt; everyone who has listened to me any length of time whatsoever knows
&gt; that these allegations are just totally untrue.  As to why I'm on the
&gt; Armed Forces Radio network, it was Senator Clinton's defense
&gt; secretary, Les Aspin, who secured an hour of this program on the Armed
&gt; Forces Radio network, and because I was requested.  They did a poll of
&gt; the troops back then, and the troops requested that this program be on
&gt; Armed Forces Radio.  Did you notice in this bite, since I've never
&gt; been to combat, I'm not qualified - which is another liberal assault
&gt; on free speech.  If you haven't done something, you're not allowed to
&gt; talk about it, Senator Reid says.

&gt; I have made troop visits to Afghanistan, senator, and I have been to
&gt; Walter Reed Army hospital, and I have been to several military bases
&gt; after Gulf War one, participating in welcome-home festivities for the
&gt; troops coming back from that conflict.  Perhaps I should remind you of
&gt; the story, Senator Reid, back in the summer of 2003, I went home one
&gt; day and there was a Federal Express package for me.  I didn't
&gt; recognize the sender, but I opened it anyway.  Inside, in a Ziploc
&gt; bag, was an American flag.  There was a letter written by hand on a
&gt; piece of yellow legal paper, and there were five certificates showing
&gt; different aircraft.  I read the letter and found out that that flag
&gt; had been flown in all five of those aircraft during the original
&gt; invasion of Iraq in 2003, in my honor, by each of the five pilots that
&gt; piloted those planes.  One was a tanker.  The others were bombers and
&gt; attack aircraft.  I looked at this, and I started crying.  Doing this
&gt; in my honor?  I doubt, Senator Reid, if this happened and it's
&gt; happened a couple times since, that if I were really held in such low
&gt; regard by the members of the US facility, this probably wouldn't be
&gt; the case.

&gt; BREAK TRANSCRIPT

&gt; RUSH: We have two more Harry Reid sound bites.  By the way, in the
&gt; second sound bite, he refers to my dwindling audience or whatever.  In
&gt; his dreams, ladies and gentlemen, is this audience getting smaller.
&gt; (Laughing.) There's nothing in any of this that's truthful.  There's
&gt; nothing in any of it to believe.  And I would caution you: you know
&gt; the truth of this, so listen to it for what this.  Now, I mentioned
&gt; earlier he's prepared a letter that he wants to send to the CEO of
&gt; Clear Channel Communications, which syndicates this program, and he
&gt; wants as many senators as possible to sign it.  Here's the bite
&gt; explaining the letter.

&gt; REID:  Here is what we wrote: &quot;Dear Mr. Mays.&quot;  Here's the letter, Mr.
&gt; President.  &quot;At the time we signed this letter, 3,801 hundred American
&gt; soldiers had been killed in Iraq.  Another 27,936 have been wounded.
&gt; One hundred and sixty others awoke this morning on foreign sand far
&gt; from home to face the danger and uncertainty of another day at war.
&gt; Although Americans of goodwill debate the merits of this war, we can
&gt; all agree that those who serve with such great courage deserve our
&gt; deepest respect and gratitude.

&gt; RUSH:  When have they ever have it from you?

&gt; REID:  That's why Rush Limbaugh's recent characterization of troops
&gt; who oppose the war as &quot;phony soldiers&quot; is an outrage.  Our troops are
&gt; fighting and dying to bring to others the freedoms that many take for
&gt; granted.  It is unconscionable that Mr. Limbaugh would criticize them
&gt; for exercising the fundamental American right to free speech.  We call
&gt; on you to publicly repudiate these comments that call into question
&gt; their

Because Harry Reid told a LIE on the floor of the U.S. Senate about a

He should now &quot;Put up&quot; or appolgize for telling a lie.

&gt; &gt; BEGIN TRANSCRIPT

&gt; &gt; RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, in the last half hour, Harry Reid took to
&gt; &gt; the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
&gt; &gt; denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
&gt; &gt; phony soldiers business.  He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
&gt; &gt; CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
&gt; &gt; asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the
&gt; &gt; opportunity to demand of my syndicator that I be condemned for
&gt; &gt; something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
&gt; &gt; The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to
&gt; &gt; introduce a resolution this afternoon along the lines of the
&gt; &gt; MoveOn.org resolution that was introduced last week, tit-for-tat, they
&gt; &gt; want a vote in the House to condemn me, a private citizen, for
&gt; &gt; something I did not say.  These people have had three, four days now
&gt; &gt; to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
&gt; &gt; doesn't matter.  What they are trying to do is flood a false story
&gt; &gt; into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
&gt; &gt; evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

&gt; &gt; This is not just the anatomy of a smear.  There's much more going on
&gt; &gt; with this than just smearing me.  There is an attempt, I think, as
&gt; &gt; they have done throughout my career, to discredit me.  No matter how
&gt; &gt; many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how

HahahahahaHA!,,,,,,the feces hasn't even hit the fan yet, when his
cowardly minions feel free to speak....Bush will be right down their
with the other schizophrenic bottom feeders ...Stalin, Hitler, and
Ivan the Terrible. To compare JFK and Bush is adding to your most
ridiculous statements Lew (and that is saying a lot) or is Bush going
to actually learn how to speak English over the next 400 tortuous
days?
