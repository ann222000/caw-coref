When my wife sometimes travel over the border to Northern Ireland she comes
back with loads of little treats that you just cannot seem to get down here
in the ROI (well not in Sligo any way maybe you can up in Dublin or cork or
places like that).

She comes back with Twiglets (things with Marmite on), Crumpets, Honey Roast
peanuts and honey roast cashew nuts, Pork Scratchings, Primula (spreadable
cheese you can put in sandwiches with different flavours), scotch eggs and
loads of other stuff you just cannot seem to buy in the supermarkets down
here. I would imagine the goods are coming over from the UK to NI so if they
reach that far I wonder why the supermarkets and shops down here don't stock
all the stuff like this?

They mostly sound like British products to me. Despite everything NI is
still Britain so British chain stores will sell British products while
their Irish counterparts won't.

Large chains can be very rigid like that.

I'm pretty sure Tescos in Letterkenny sell crumpets and possibly the
cashew nuts too

Some of these treats would be nice to get hold of on a weekly shop though
sometimes (locally) instead of having to travel up to NI (or Letterkenny) to
get them. So I suppose Tesco Ireland just must cover ROI  and the Tesco up
NI is British Tesco but I would have though being part of the same chain
they would stock roughly about the same kind of lines.

How about Dunnes then? I wonder if the NI Dunnes are different from the
Dunnes stores down here because they seem to have different products up
there in the NI stores.

Seems that way to me but I don't work for them so can't be sure. From a
cross-border shopping perspective there appear to be definite
differences in the range offered in NI/RoI

Only aware of the clothes side in NI and that seems pretty universal
with RoI. I'd be surprised if Dunnes had different policies for North/South.

crumpets and scotch eggs are definitely available here (in M&amp;S and Tesco
at least).  Primula sounds vile, but there are other spreadable cheeses

Ah, for an M&amp;S for Sligo - I think I asked mrs about crumpets in Sligo and
she said they didn't do them. Primula is lovely comes in tubes and different
flavours, cheese and chives is lovely in a sandwich with some lettuce as a
lunchtime snack and you can squeeze it out onto the bread like toothpaste
and spreads really easily not like triangles. Yeah, Tizer used to drink
loads when I was little haven't had it for years, must get Mrs to buy some
next time up north. I think Red Lemonade is similar over here to Tizer isn't
it?

&gt; Crumpets are a bread product. Have you asked a local baker if s/he

Very good Idea actually. I might ask the local bakers down here next time -
only other thing being is that in a supermarket they buy them in bulk and
they are next to nothing to buy but if a bakers made them especially then
could be pricey.

&gt; For small batches it might be pricey, but it is not as if they are a
&gt; regular staple. A treat every once on a while. All you need is to find
&gt; a willing baker and agree a price and something along the lines of you
&gt; phoning an order a couple of days in advance.

&gt; He knows that he will have a customer and is not wasting time and
&gt; effort for a product no one else will buy.

&gt; If it is too much effort and hassle he or others just won't bother.
&gt; Market forces and economics and all that.

&gt; Good luck.
">

Thanks, I will put it to the bakers and see what they say. I have just been
reading about Crumpets on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crumpet
so I see that they are normally an English thing. It made my mouth water
just seeing the picture there of the lovely hot crumpet with butter melting
into it - yum!  :-)  wish I had some here now.

I see there is a recipe as well on wikipedia so they don't look too
difficult if me or Mrs Andy want to have a go at making some one day as
well. - The big decision is whether to just have butter on it or throw on
some Marmite as well!

In 1927 the official name was changed from UK of GB&amp;I to the United

I would have bought a packet. and my 14 year old son loves them. - We are
supposed to be getting an Aldi store soon in Sligo I believe. I found an out
of date Crumpet in the freezer and had it for lunch today. It was out of
date and had a green mouldy bit on the edge that I had to gouge out with a
knife, but do you think that put me off!  - spread a bit of butter on it and
a tiny bit of marmite a cup of tea and it was lovely. Bob's yer uncle and
