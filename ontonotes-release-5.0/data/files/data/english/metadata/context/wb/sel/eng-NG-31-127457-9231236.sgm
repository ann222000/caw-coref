Yes. After:
1. watching the exchange rate fall like a cow's tail in real time;
2. reading several analyses expressing a diapason of views stating that:
a. it was *excellent*, because American exports will become cheaper,
America will resume producing more basic industrial products
domestically, and Americans will be able to afford fewer imports, in
other words, &quot;What's good for Boeing is bad for Airbus&quot;;
a. it was *good*, because the dollar is an overvalued, over-extended
currency;
b. it *doesn't matter*, because market forces will raise the price
and keep things in order as  people dump other currencies to buy cheap
dollars, thus increasing demand for them and the international exchange
rate;
c. it was *bad*, because it could precipitate a world-wide recession
as economic forces realign themselves;
d. it was *catastrophic*, because big holders of dollars such as
China, Japan, Russia, and/or the Middle Eastern oil  exporters might
start dumping their dollars, moving into and pricing their exports in
euros, and thus compromising or even zilching America's status as the
world's economic superpower. The Chinese in particular are less than
pleased that the eroding international value of the dollar means that as
long as they keep the yuan more or less pegged to it, they retain their
American market but see their robust economic growth otherwise
neutralized by the exchange rate in international terms. This is
question of more than a trillion dollars, so it is not to be dismissed
lightly.

Not being an economist and with all my assets in euros, this development
does not affect my life in the shorter term, but I cannot see how a run
on or collapse of the dollar can be a good thing in the longer term. As
an Apple Macintosh user, I am somewhat peeved that the new Leopard
version of Mac OSX goes on sale tomorrow at EUR 129 in Eurozonia, but at
USD 129 [= EUR 90] in the US.

Henry, sometimes personal antipathies should provide room for a common
sense: nobody is dancing over the fall of the $$$ even in Kremlin for a
simple reason prof.Holman formulated in his posts: Russia's foreign
currency reserves are mostly in $$. Devaluation of the $$$ hits Russia
today no lesser than the US. Maybe more as most of Russia's trade is
with EU.

And speaking in general, - more than two third of the world economy is
based on $$$, so it affects EVERYBODY. Those who operates in $$$ are to
be hit first, the rest will follow whether it is Euro, Mongolian Tanga
or whatever currency they use in North Korea and Iran.

Woo-hoo!!

The Holmaian/Kremlin line is now
that the current US is akin to the
Weimar republic in 1919-1933
(more or less) in Germany.

What the hell - this is, after all,
right in line with the Holmanian/
Kremlin history lessons about the
russkie/Baltic countries situation that we
have had to read in the past.

This is &quot;Truth&quot; according to the Kremlin
which is what Holman *has* to type.

Though I would warn you - do not
discount the Holmanian BS.  He has
frequently acted as a test-site for a
disinformation line that the Kremlin
planned to use for general &quot;old
Europe&quot; consumption.

Please understand what Holman is
and what he is all about.

You really are in a McCarthy-like frenzy today, Henry. The Kremlin,
which is in the paradoxical situation of holding close to a trillion
dollars, whose value is rapidly eroding, while watching the price of oil
ease towards the $100 a barrel level, has reason to be concerned about
the devaluation of the dollar. I, without a single dollar to my name, am
only concerned because it means that economic tectonic plates are
realigning themselves with consequences nobody can foresee.

They are in line with your selectively mendacious interpretations of
them, nothing else. Devaluing the currency and paying of debts incurred
in hard currency with debased currency is something that irresponsible
governments have been doing ever since the days of the Roman Empire.
That the US is flirting with the same idea does not make it akin to the
Weimar Republic in any other sense than the fact that the economists

As I just wrote, the Kremlin is in a position that it is both concerned
about and is profiting from the erosion of the international value of
the dollar. When you have close to a trillion of them, you can get
severely burned if you do not play your cards right.

Anybody with the slightest interest in these matters knows that the
euro/dollar exchange rate has dropped from 1.17 on January 28, 2002 to
the 0.69 that it is today. Anybody who made an investment costing 1.17
euros in 2002 that was worth only 0.69 euros close to six years later
would think seriously about divesting himself of that investment, all
the more so if the trend was downwards and he had close to a trillion of
them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Though I would warn you - do not

The only bullshit in this is your risible prediction a few years ago
that the euro would be a flop and fall to the value of a German mark. In

The disappearing dollar
Dec 2nd 2004
From The Economist print edition
THE dollar has been the leading international currency for as long as
most people can remember. But its dominant role can no longer be taken
for granted. If America keeps on spending and borrowing at its present
pace, the dollar will eventually lose its mighty status in international
finance. And that would hurt: the privilege of being able to print the
world's reserve currency, a privilege which is now at risk, allows
America to borrow cheaply, and thus to spend much more than it earns, on
far better terms than are available to others. Imagine you could write
cheques that were accepted as payment but never cashed. That is what it
amounts to. If you had been granted that ability, you might take care to
hang on to it. America is taking no such care, and may come to regret it.
The dollar is not what it used to be. Over the past three years it has
fallen by 35% against the euro and by 24% against the yen.

Forex - Dollar flounders, sets fresh record lows against euro
10.26.07, 11:07 AM ET

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - The hapless dollar set a series of fresh
record lows against the euro and was down against a host of currencies
as fears of a recession in the US began to take hold after a some weak
economic numbers over the week.

The data include an unexpected drop in durable goods orders and
higher-than-expected weekly employment numbers yesterday alongside a
continually weak housing market and rocketing oil prices.

Later today, a drop in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment
survey is expected, making it likely that the dollar will drop further.
Economists expect the University of Michigan survey to show a final
October consumer sentiment of 82.0, down from its 83.4 preliminary
reading.

Against this backdrop, markets are predicting that US rate setters will
be forced to go on a rate cutting spree in order to shore up the wider
economy.

'Increased certainty that the Fed funds rate will fall by at least 50
basis points this year to 4.25 pct means that the dollar will be treated
as a low yielding currency, specifically due to the onset of further
rate cuts in 2008,' Ashraf Laidi at CMC Markets said.

More rate cuts are expected to follow in 2008.

'It is the anticipation of further rate cuts that reinforces the
depreciation of the greenback, especially as the deepening housing
recession is expected to continue into 2008, translating into
repercussions for employment, homeowner's equity and consumer spending,'
he added.

No wonder then that the dollar is now languishing at a record low
against the euro (1.4287 usd), a 33-year low against the Canadian dollar
and a new 23-year low against the Aussie dollar. It held up better
against other low yielding currencies -- namely the yen and the Swiss
franc

The dollar's weakness against the euro was also more stark as it comes
at a time when euro zone data is starting to weaken.

It was revealed today that Euro area M3 grew 11.3 pct year-on-year in
September, down from a year-on-year growth rate of 11.6 pct in August,
and in line with the consensus forecast.

Elsewhere, the pound rose to three-month highs against the dollar,
supported by the US rate cut talk.

'The market is of the view that the Fed will act 'ahead of the curve'
thereby preventing the economy from free falling,' said analysts at BNP
Paribas (other-otc: BNPQY.PK - news - people ).

'As long as this view holds, the US dollar will continue to trade on the
back foot.'

The yen was stable against the dollar, as risk appetite remained subdued.
'Dollar/yen trades in a tight range as risk sentiment remains skittish,'
said analysts at BNP Paribas.

However, they added that risk appetite could re-merge following
Industrial and Commercial Bank (other-otc: CBDP.PK - news - people ) of
China's announcement that it will buy a 20 pct stake in South Africa's
Standard Bank -- the biggest foreign direct investment in the country
since 1994.

The disappearing dollar

THE dollar has been the leading international currency for as long as
most people can remember. But its dominant role can no longer be taken
for granted. If America keeps on spending and borrowing at its present
pace, the dollar will eventually lose its mighty status in international
finance. And that would hurt: the privilege of being able to print the
world's reserve currency, a privilege which is now at risk, allows
America to borrow cheaply, and thus to spend much more than it earns, on
far better terms than are available to others. Imagine you could write
cheques that were accepted as payment but never cashed. That is what it
amounts to. If you had been granted that ability, you might take care to
hang on to it. America is taking no such care, and may come to regret it.

The cost of neglect

The dollar is not what it used to be. Over the past three years it has
fallen by 35% against the euro and by 24% against the yen. But its
latest slide is merely a symptom of a worse malaise: the global
financial system is under great strain. America has habits that are
inappropriate, to say the least, for the guardian of the world's main
reserve currency: rampant government borrowing, furious consumer
spending and a current-account deficit big enough to have bankrupted any
other country some time ago. This makes a dollar devaluation inevitable,
not least because it becomes a seemingly attractive option for the
leaders of a heavily indebted America. Policymakers now seem to be
talking the dollar down. Yet this is a dangerous game. Why would anybody
want to invest in a currency that will almost certainly depreciate?
A second disturbing feature of the global financial system is that it
has become a giant money press as America's easy-money policy has
spilled beyond its borders. Total global liquidity is growing faster in
real terms than ever before. Emerging economies that try to fix their
currencies against the dollar, notably in Asia, have been forced to
amplify the Fed's super-loose monetary policy: when central banks buy
dollars to hold down their currencies, they print local money to do so.
This gush of global liquidity has not pushed up inflation. Instead it
has flowed into share prices and houses around the world, inflating a
series of asset-price bubbles.

America's current-account deficit is at the heart of these global
concerns. The OECD's latest Economic Outlook predicts that the deficit
will rise to $825 billion by 2006 (6.4% of America's GDP) assuming
unchanged exchange rates. Optimists argue that foreigners will keep
financing the deficit because American assets offer high returns and a
haven from risk. In fact, private investors have already turned away
from dollar assets: the returns on investments in America have recently
been lower than in Europe or Japan (see article). And can a currency
that has been sliding against the world's next two biggest currencies
for 30 years be regarded as &quot;safe&quot;?

In a free market, without the massive support of Asian central banks,
the dollar would be far weaker. In any case, such support has its
limits, and the dollar now seems likely to fall further. How harmful
will the economic consequences be? Will it really undermine the dollar's
reserve-currency status?

Periods of dollar decline have often been unhappy for the world economy.
The breakdown of Bretton Woods that led to a weaker dollar in the early
1970s was painful for all, contributing to rising inflation and
recession. In the late 1980s, the falling dollar had few ill-effects on
America's economy, but it played a big role in inflating a bubble in
Japan by forcing Japanese authorities to slash interest rates.

This time round, it is a bad sign that everybody is trying to point the
finger of blame at somebody else. America says its external deficit is
mainly due to sluggish growth in Europe and Japan, and to the fact that
China is pegging its exchange rate too low. Europe, alarmed at the
&quot;brutal&quot; rise in the euro, says that America's high public borrowing and
low household saving are the real culprits.

There is something to both these claims. China and other Asian economies
should indeed let their currencies rise, relieving pressure on the euro.
It is also true that Asia is partly to blame for America's consumer
binge: its central banks' large purchases of Treasury bonds have
depressed bond yields, encouraging households in the United States to
take out bigger mortgages and spend the cash. And Europe needs to
accept, as it is unwilling to, that a weaker dollar will be a good thing
if it helps to shrink America's deficit and curb the risk of a future
crisis. At the same time, Europe is also right: most of the blame for
America's deficit lies at home. America needs to cut its budget deficit.
It is not a question of either do this or do that: a cheaper dollar and
higher American saving are both needed if a crunch is to be avoided.

Simple but harsh

Many American policymakers talk as though it is better to rely entirely
on a falling dollar to solve, somehow, all their problems. Conceivably,
it could happen--but such a one-sided remedy would most likely be far
more painful than they imagine. America's challenge is not just to
reduce its current-account deficit to a level which foreigners are happy
to finance by buying more dollar assets, but also to persuade existing
foreign creditors to hang on to their vast stock of dollar assets,
estimated at almost $11 trillion. A fall in the dollar sufficient to
close the current-account deficit might destroy its safe-haven status.
If the dollar falls by another 30%, as some predict, it would amount to
the biggest default in history: not a conventional default on debt
service, but default by stealth, wiping trillions off the value of
foreigners' dollar assets.

The dollar's loss of reserve-currency status would lead America's
creditors to start cashing those cheques--and what an awful lot of
cheques there are to cash. As that process gathered pace, the dollar
could tumble further and further. American bond yields (long-term
interest rates) would soar, quite likely causing a deep recession.
Americans who favour a weak dollar should be

Poor Henrykins fails to understand that the government that he supports
with such uncritical enthusiasm is guilty of war crimes, human rghts
violations, and other depredations every bit as criminal as those
committed by the &quot;russkies&quot; of yore that he so despises:
- regime change
- torture
- storing its real and perceived enemies in a gulag
- outsourcing meganastiness
- occupation of foreign countries on the pretext of providing their
inhabitants with a better lifestyle
- defrauding the international community by debasing the national
currency.

Sadly for Henrykins, he thinks that a direct pipeline to the Kremlin is
necessary to notice these things. He fails to understand the fact that
due to the alignment of the Lithuanian litas with the euro,  a vacation
in Lithuania is no longer the bargain that it once was for a person
whose litas were obtained by  exchanging dollars.

The disappearing dollar

THE dollar has been the leading international currency for as long as
most people can remember. But its dominant role can no longer be taken
for granted. If America keeps on spending and borrowing at its present
pace, the dollar will eventually lose its mighty status in international
finance. And that would hurt: the privilege of being able to print the
world's reserve currency, a privilege which is now at risk, allows
America to borrow cheaply, and thus to spend much more than it earns, on
far better terms than are available to others. Imagine you could write
cheques that were accepted as payment but never cashed. That is what it
amounts to. If you had been granted that ability, you might take care to
hang on to it. America is taking no such care, and may come to regret it.

The cost of neglect

The dollar is not what it used to be. Over the past three years it has
fallen by 35% against the euro and by 24% against the yen. But its
latest slide is merely a symptom of a worse malaise: the global
financial system is under great strain. America has habits that are
inappropriate, to say the least, for the guardian of the world's main
reserve currency: rampant government borrowing, furious consumer
spending and a current-account deficit big enough to have bankrupted any
other country some time ago. This makes a dollar devaluation inevitable,
not least because it becomes a seemingly attractive option for the
leaders of a heavily indebted America. Policymakers now seem to be
talking the dollar down. Yet this is a dangerous game. Why would anybody
want to invest in a currency that will almost certainly depreciate?
A second disturbing feature of the global financial system is that it
has become a giant money press as America's easy-money policy has
spilled beyond its borders. Total global liquidity is growing faster in
real terms than ever before. Emerging economies that try to fix their
currencies against the dollar, notably in Asia, have been forced to
amplify the Fed's super-loose monetary policy: when central banks buy
dollars to hold down their currencies, they print local money to do so.
This gush of global liquidity has not pushed up inflation. Instead it
has flowed into share prices and houses around the world, inflating a
series of asset-price bubbles.

America's current-account deficit is at the heart of these global
concerns. The OECD's latest Economic Outlook predicts that the deficit
will rise to $825 billion by 2006 (6.4% of America's GDP) assuming
unchanged exchange rates. Optimists argue that foreigners will keep
financing the deficit because American assets offer high returns and a
haven from risk. In fact, private investors have already turned away
from dollar assets: the returns on investments in America have recently
been lower than in Europe or Japan (see article). And can a currency
that has been sliding against the world's next two biggest currencies
for 30 years be regarded as &quot;safe&quot;?

In a free market, without the massive support of Asian central banks,
the dollar would be far weaker. In any case, such support has its
limits, and the dollar now seems likely to fall further. How harmful
will the economic consequences be? Will it really undermine the dollar's
reserve-currency status?

Periods of dollar decline have often been unhappy for the world economy.
The breakdown of Bretton Woods that led to a weaker dollar in the early
1970s was painful for all, contributing to rising inflation and
recession. In the late 1980s, the falling dollar had few ill-effects on
America's economy, but it played a big role in inflating a bubble in
Japan by forcing Japanese authorities to slash interest rates.

This time round, it is a bad sign that everybody is trying to point the
finger of blame at somebody else. America says its external deficit is
mainly due to sluggish growth in Europe and Japan, and to the fact that
China is pegging its exchange rate too low. Europe, alarmed at the
&quot;brutal&quot; rise in the euro, says that America's high public borrowing and
low household saving are the real culprits.

There is something to both these claims. China and other Asian economies
should indeed let their currencies rise, relieving pressure on the euro.
It is also true that Asia is partly to blame for America's consumer
binge: its central banks' large purchases of Treasury bonds have
depressed bond yields, encouraging households in the United States to
take out bigger mortgages and spend the cash. And Europe needs to
accept, as it is unwilling to, that a weaker dollar will be a good thing
if it helps to shrink America's deficit and curb the risk of a future
crisis. At the same time, Europe is also right: most of the blame for
America's deficit lies at home. America needs to cut its budget deficit.
It is not a question of either do this or do that: a cheaper dollar and
higher American saving are both needed if a crunch is to be avoided.

Simple but harsh

Many American policymakers talk as though it is better to rely entirely
on a falling dollar to solve, somehow, all their problems. Conceivably,
it could happen--but such a one-sided remedy would most likely be far
more painful than they imagine. America's challenge is not just to
reduce its current-account deficit to a level which foreigners are happy
to finance by buying more dollar assets, but also to persuade existing
foreign creditors to hang on to their vast stock of dollar assets,
estimated at almost $11 trillion. A fall in the dollar sufficient to
close the current-account deficit might destroy its safe-haven status.
If the dollar falls by another 30%, as some predict, it would amount to
the biggest default in history: not a conventional default on debt
service, but default by stealth, wiping trillions off the value of
foreigners' dollar assets.

The dollar's loss of reserve-currency status would lead America's
creditors to start cashing those cheques--and what an awful lot of
cheques

&gt; &gt; ****************

&gt; &gt; Woo-hoo!!

&gt; &gt; The Holmaian/Kremlin line is now
&gt; &gt; that the current US is akin to the
&gt; &gt; Weimar republic in 1919-1933
&gt; &gt; (more or less) in Germany.

&gt; You really are in a McCarthy-like frenzy today, Henry. The Kremlin,
&gt; which is in the paradoxical situation of holding close to a trillion
&gt; dollars, whose value is rapidly eroding, while watching the price of oil
&gt; ease towards the $100 a barrel level, has reason to be concerned about
&gt; the devaluation of the dollar. I, without a single dollar to my name, am
&gt; only concerned because it means that economic tectonic plates are
&gt; realigning themselves with consequences nobody can foresee.

&gt; &gt; What the hell - this is, after all,
&gt; &gt; right in line with the Holmanian/
&gt; &gt; Kremlin history lessons about the
&gt; &gt; russkie/Baltic countries situation that we
&gt; &gt; have had to read in the past.

&gt; They are in line with your selectively mendacious interpretations of
&gt; them, nothing else. Devaluing the currency and paying off debts incurred
&gt; in hard currency with debased currency is something that irresponsible
&gt; governments have been doing ever since the days of the Roman Empire.
&gt; That the US is flirting with the same idea does not make it akin to the
&gt; Weimar Republic in any other sense than the fact that the politicians
&gt; calling the shots in both cases knew their economic history and opted
&gt; for a time-tested scam.

&gt; &gt; This is &quot;Truth&quot; according to the Kremlin
&gt; &gt; which is what Holman *has* to type.

&gt; As I just wrote, the Kremlin is in a position that it is both concerned
&gt; about and profitting from the erosion of the international value of
&gt; the dollar. When you have close to a trillion of them, you can get
&gt; severely burned if you do not play your cards carefully.

&gt; Anybody with the slightest interest in these matters knows that the
&gt; euro/dollar exchange rate has dropped precipitously from 1.17 on January
&gt; 28, 2002 to the 0.69 and falling that it is today, in other words, it
&gt; has undergone a 42% devaluation with respect to the euro and certain
&gt; other currencies. Anybody who made an investment in 2002 that was worth
&gt; only 58% of its original value  six years later would think seriously
&gt; about divesting himself of that investment, all the more so if the trend
&gt; was downwards with no bottom line in sight and he had close to a
&gt; trillion such investments.

&gt; &gt; Though I would warn you - do not
&gt; &gt; discount the Holmanian BS.

&gt; The only bullshit in this is your risible prediction a few years ago
&gt; that the euro would be a flop and fall to the value of a German mark. In
&gt; fact. measured a against a neutral means of exchange such as gold, it is
&gt; the dollar that is ltattered and torn. Anybody who has ever taken
&gt; Economics 101 knows that the best way to bankrupt a national economy is
&gt; to reduce taxes while waging pointless and fruitless foreign wars, all
&gt; while living beyond your means on credit. Not everyone remembers that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Woo-hoo!!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Holmaian/Kremlin line is now
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the current US is akin to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Weimar republic in 1919-1933
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (more or less) in Germany.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You really are in a McCarthy-like frenzy today, Henry. The Kremlin,
&gt;&gt;&gt; which is in the paradoxical situation of holding close to a trillion
&gt;&gt;&gt; dollars, whose value is rapidly eroding, while watching the price of oil
&gt;&gt;&gt; ease towards the $100 a barrel level, has reason to be concerned about
&gt;&gt;&gt; the devaluation of the dollar. I, without a single dollar to my name, am
&gt;&gt;&gt; only concerned because it means that economic tectonic plates are
&gt;&gt;&gt; realigning themselves with consequences nobody can foresee.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What the hell - this is, after all,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right in line with the Holmanian/
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kremlin history lessons about the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; russkie/Baltic countries situation that we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have had to read in the past.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They are in line with your selectively mendacious interpretations of
&gt;&gt;&gt; them, nothing else. Devaluing the currency and paying off debts incurred
&gt;&gt;&gt; in hard currency with debased currency is something that irresponsible
&gt;&gt;&gt; governments have been doing ever since the days of the Roman Empire.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That the US is flirting with the same idea does not make it akin to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Weimar Republic in any other sense than the fact that the politicians
&gt;&gt;&gt; calling the shots in both cases knew their economic history and opted
&gt;&gt;&gt; for a time-tested scam.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is &quot;Truth&quot; according to the Kremlin
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which is what Holman *has* to type.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As I just wrote, the Kremlin is in a position that it is both concerned
&gt;&gt;&gt; about and profitting from the erosion of the international value of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the dollar. When you have close to a trillion of them, you can get
&gt;&gt;&gt; severely burned if you do not play your cards carefully.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Anybody with the slightest interest in these matters knows that the
&gt;&gt;&gt; euro/dollar exchange rate has dropped precipitously from 1.17 on January
&gt;&gt;&gt; 28, 2002 to the 0.69 and falling that it is today, in other words, it
&gt;&gt;&gt; has undergone a 42% devaluation with respect to the euro and certain
&gt;&gt;&gt; other currencies. Anybody who made an investment in 2002 that was worth
&gt;&gt;&gt; only 58% of its original value  six years later would think seriously
&gt;&gt;&gt; about divesting himself of that investment, all the more so if the trend
&gt;&gt;&gt; was downwards with no bottom line in sight and he had close to a
&gt;&gt;&gt; trillion such investments.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Though I would warn you - do not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; discount the Holmanian BS.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The only bullshit in this is your risible prediction a few years ago
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the euro would be a flop and fall to the value of a German mark. In
&gt;&gt;&gt; fact. measured a against a neutral means of exchange such as gold, it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; the dollar that is ltattered and torn. Anybody who has ever taken
&gt;&gt;&gt; Economics 101 knows that the best way to bankrupt a national economy is
&gt;&gt;&gt; to reduce taxes while waging pointless and fruitless foreign wars, all
&gt;&gt;&gt; while living beyond your means on credit. Not everyone remembers that
&gt;&gt;&gt; the US has already been in Iraq for a time span longer than that defined
&gt;&gt;&gt; by the attack on Pearl Harbor and VJ day with very little to show for
&gt;&gt;&gt; its investment and losses there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No sane person wants to see the dollar go the way of the German
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rentenmark, the Soviet ruble, the Yugoslav dinar, or the Zimbabwean
&gt;&gt;&gt; dollar, nor do I think that will happen. Nevertheless, there are clear
&gt;&gt;&gt; signs that the &quot;party is over&quot; as far as the present functioning of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; American economy is concerned. The loss of international faith in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; dollar, clear in the unprecedented erosion of its international value,
&gt;&gt;&gt; is a clear sign of this.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This prescient article is from almost three years ago. The dire
&gt;&gt;&gt; predictions it made are now coming true.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;quote&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The disappearing dollar

&gt;&gt;&gt; THE dollar has been the leading international currency for as long as
&gt;&gt;&gt; most people can remember. But its dominant role can no longer be taken
&gt;&gt;&gt; for granted. If America keeps on spending and borrowing at its present
&gt;&gt;&gt; pace, the dollar will eventually lose its mighty status in international
&gt;&gt;&gt; finance. And that would hurt: the privilege of being able to print the
&gt;&gt;&gt; world's reserve currency, a privilege which is now at risk, allows
&gt;&gt;&gt; America to borrow cheaply, and thus to spend much more than it earns, on
&gt;&gt;&gt; far better terms than are available to others. Imagine you could write
&gt;&gt;&gt; cheques that were accepted as payment but never cashed. That is what it
&gt;&gt;&gt; amounts to. If you had been granted that ability, you might take care to
&gt;&gt;&gt; hang on to it. America is taking no such care, and may come to regret
&gt;&gt;&gt; it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The cost of neglect

&gt;&gt;&gt; The dollar is not what it used to be. Over the past three years it has
&gt;&gt;&gt; fallen by 35% against the euro and by 24% against the yen. But its
&gt;&gt;&gt; latest slide is merely a symptom of a worse malaise: the global
&gt;&gt;&gt; financial system is under great strain. America has habits that are
&gt;&gt;&gt; inappropriate, to say the least, for the guardian of the world's main
&gt;&gt;&gt; reserve currency: rampant government borrowing, furious consumer
&gt;&gt;&gt; spending and a current-account deficit big enough to have bankrupted any
&gt;&gt;&gt; other country some time ago. This makes a dollar devaluation inevitable,
&gt;&gt;&gt; not least because it becomes a seemingly attractive option for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; leaders of a heavily indebted America. Policymakers now seem to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; talking the dollar down. Yet this is a dangerous game. Why would anybody
&gt;&gt;&gt; want to invest in a currency that will almost certainly depreciate?
&gt;&gt;&gt; A second disturbing feature of the global financial system is that it
&gt;&gt;&gt; has become a giant money press as America's easy-money policy has
&gt;&gt;&gt; spilled beyond its borders. Total global liquidity is growing faster in
&gt;&gt;&gt; real terms than ever before. Emerging economies that try to fix their
&gt;&gt;&gt; currencies against the dollar, notably in Asia, have been forced to
&gt;&gt;&gt; amplify the Fed's super-loose monetary policy: when central banks buy
&gt;&gt;&gt; dollars to hold down their currencies, they print local money to do so.
&gt;&gt;&gt; This gush of global liquidity has not pushed up inflation. Instead it
&gt;&gt;&gt; has flowed into share prices and houses around the world, inflating a
&gt;&gt;&gt; series of asset-price bubbles.

&gt;&gt;&gt; America's current-account deficit is at the heart of these global
&gt;&gt;&gt; concerns. The OECD's latest Economic Outlook predicts that the deficit
&gt;&gt;&gt; will rise to $825 billion by 2006 (6.4% of America's GDP) assuming
&gt;&gt;&gt; unchanged exchange rates. Optimists argue that foreigners will keep
&gt;&gt;&gt; financing the deficit because American assets offer high returns and a
&gt;&gt;&gt; haven from risk. In fact, private investors have already turned away
&gt;&gt;&gt; from dollar assets: the returns on investments in America have recently
&gt;&gt;&gt; been lower than in Europe or Japan (see article). And can a currency
&gt;&gt;&gt; that has been sliding against the world's next two biggest currencies
&gt;&gt;&gt; for 30 years be regarded as &quot;safe&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt; In a free market, without the massive support of Asian central banks,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the dollar would be far weaker. In any case, such support has its
&gt;&gt;&gt; limits, and the dollar now seems likely to fall further. How harmful
&gt;&gt;&gt; will the economic consequences be? Will it really undermine the dollar's
&gt;&gt;&gt; reserve-currency status?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Periods of dollar decline have often been unhappy for the world economy.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The breakdown of Bretton Woods that led to a weaker dollar in the early
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1970s was painful for all, contributing to rising inflation and
&gt;&gt;&gt; recession. In the late 1980s, the falling dollar had few ill-effects on
&gt;&gt;&gt; America's economy, but it played a big role in inflating a bubble in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Japan by forcing Japanese authorities to slash interest rates.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This time round, it is a bad sign that everybody is trying to point the
&gt;&gt;&gt; finger of blame at somebody else. America says its external deficit is
&gt;&gt;&gt; mainly due to sluggish growth in Europe and Japan, and to the fact that
&gt;&gt;&gt; China is pegging its exchange rate too low. Europe, alarmed at the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;brutal&quot; rise in the euro, says that America's high public borrowing and
&gt;&gt;&gt; low household saving are the real culprits.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is something to both these claims. China and other Asian economies
&gt;&gt;&gt; should indeed let their currencies rise, relieving pressure on the euro.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is also true that Asia is partly to blame for America's consumer
&gt;&gt;&gt; binge: its central banks' large purchases of Treasury bonds have
&gt;&gt;&gt; depressed bond yields, encouraging households in the United States to
&gt;&gt;&gt; take out bigger mortgages and spend the cash. And Europe needs to
&gt;&gt;&gt; accept, as it is unwilling to, that a weaker dollar will be a good thing
&gt;&gt;&gt; if it helps to shrink America's deficit and curb the risk of a future
&gt;&gt;&gt; crisis. At the same time, Europe is also right: most of the blame for
&gt;&gt;&gt; America's deficit lies at home. America needs to cut its budget deficit.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not a question of either do this or do that: a cheaper dollar and
&gt;&gt;&gt; higher American saving are both needed if a crunch is to be avoided.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Simple but harsh

&gt;&gt;&gt; Many American policymakers talk as though it is better to rely entirely
&gt;&gt;&gt; on a falling dollar to solve, somehow, all their problems. Conceivably,
&gt;&gt;&gt; it could happen--but such a one-sided remedy would most likely be far
&gt;&gt;&gt; more painful than they imagine. America's challenge is not just to
&gt;&gt;&gt; reduce its

You make some good points, Vello. But things are not quite so simple:
look in the mirror and remind yourself that this ain't 1992. In 1992
there was international trust in the dollar, now there is not. The ruble
was a joke currency and the euro did not exist; now the situation is
different. The dollar is rapidly becoming a junk currency. Living beyond
a country's means, allowing the dollar-printing presses to run freely,
and engaging in pointless foreign wars are all strategies that erode
currencies.

&gt; realigning themselves with consequences nobody can foresee.

&gt;&gt; What the hell - this is, after all,
&gt;&gt; right in line with the Holmanian/
&gt;&gt; Kremlin history lessons about the
&gt;&gt; russkie/Baltic countries situation that we
&gt;&gt; have had to read in the past.

&gt; They are in line with your selectively mendacious interpretations of
&gt; them, nothing else. Devaluing the currency and paying off debts incurred
&gt; in hard currency with debased currency is something that irresponsible
&gt; governments have been doing ever since the days of the Roman Empire.
&gt; That the US is flirting with the same idea does not make it akin to the
&gt; Weimar Republic in any other sense than the fact that the politicians
&gt; calling the shots in both cases knew their economic history and opted
&gt; for a time-tested scam.

&gt;&gt; This is &quot;Truth&quot; according to the Kremlin
&gt;&gt; which is what Holman *has* to type.

&gt; As I just wrote, the Kremlin is in a position that it is both concerned
&gt; about and profitting from the erosion of the international value of
&gt; the dollar. When you have close to a trillion of them, you can get
&gt; severely burned if you do not play your cards carefully.

&gt; Anybody with the slightest interest in these matters knows that the
&gt; euro/dollar exchange rate has dropped precipitously from 1.17 on January
&gt; 28, 2002 to the 0.69 and falling that it is today, in other words, it
&gt; has undergone a 42% devaluation with respect to the euro and certain
&gt; other currencies. Anybody who made an investment in 2002 that was worth
&gt; only 58% of its original value  six years later would think seriously
&gt; about divesting himself of that investment, all the more so if the trend
&gt; was downwards with no bottom line in sight and he had close to a
&gt; trillion such investments.

&gt;&gt; Though I would warn you - do not
&gt;&gt; discount the Holmanian BS.

&gt; The only bullshit in this is your risible prediction a few years ago
&gt; that the euro would be a flop and fall to the value of a German mark. In
&gt; fact. measured a against a neutral means of exchange such as gold, it is
&gt; the dollar that is ltattered and torn. Anybody who has ever taken
&gt; Economics 101 knows that the best way to bankrupt a national economy is
&gt; to reduce taxes while waging pointless and fruitless foreign wars, all
&gt; while living beyond your means on credit. Not everyone remembers that
&gt; the US has already been in Iraq for a time span longer than that defined
&gt; by the attack on Pearl Harbor and VJ day with very little to show for
&gt; its investment and losses there.

&gt; No sane person wants to see the dollar go the way of the German
&gt; Rentenmark, the Soviet ruble, the Yugoslav dinar, or the Zimbabwean
&gt; dollar, nor do I think that will happen. Nevertheless, there are clear
&gt; signs that the &quot;party is over&quot; as far as the present functioning of the
&gt; American economy is concerned. The loss of international faith in the
&gt; dollar, clear in the unprecedented erosion of its international value,
&gt; is a clear sign of this.

&gt; This prescient article is from almost three years ago. The dire
&gt; predictions it made are now coming true.

&gt; The disappearing dollar

&gt; THE dollar has been the leading international currency for as long as
&gt; most people can remember. But its dominant role can no longer be taken
&gt; for granted. If America keeps on spending and borrowing at its present
&gt; pace, the dollar will eventually lose its mighty status in international
&gt; finance. And that would hurt: the privilege of being able to print the
&gt; world's reserve currency, a privilege which is now at risk, allows
&gt; America to borrow cheaply, and thus to spend much more than it earns, on
&gt; far better terms than are available to others. Imagine you could write
&gt; cheques that were accepted as payment but never cashed. That is what it
&gt; amounts to. If you had been granted that ability, you might take care to
&gt; hang on to it. America is taking no such care, and may come to regret it.

&gt; The cost of neglect

&gt; The dollar is not what it used to be. Over the past three years it has
&gt; fallen by 35% against the euro and by 24% against the yen. But its
&gt; latest slide is merely a symptom of a worse malaise: the global
&gt; financial system is under great strain. America has habits that are
&gt; inappropriate, to say the least, for the guardian of the world's main
&gt; reserve currency: rampant government borrowing, furious consumer
&gt; spending and a current-account deficit big enough to have bankrupted any
&gt; other country some time ago. This makes a dollar devaluation inevitable,
&gt; not least because it becomes a seemingly attractive option for the
&gt; leaders of a heavily indebted America. Policymakers now seem to be
&gt; talking the dollar down. Yet this is a dangerous game. Why would anybody
&gt; want to invest in a currency that will almost certainly depreciate?
&gt; A second disturbing feature of the global financial system is that it
&gt; has become a giant money press as America's easy-money policy has
&gt; spilled beyond its borders. Total global liquidity is growing faster in
&gt; real terms than ever before. Emerging economies that try to fix their
&gt; currencies against the dollar, notably in Asia, have been forced to
&gt; amplify the Fed's super-loose monetary policy: when central banks buy
&gt; dollars to hold down their currencies, they print local money to do so.
&gt; This gush of global liquidity has not pushed up inflation. Instead it
&gt; has flowed into share prices and houses around the world, inflating a
&gt; series of asset-price bubbles.

&gt; America's current-account deficit is at the heart of these global
&gt; concerns. The OECD's latest Economic Outlook predicts that the deficit
&gt; will rise to $825 billion by 2006 (6.4% of America's GDP) assuming
&gt; unchanged exchange rates. Optimists argue that foreigners will keep
&gt; financing the deficit because American assets offer high returns and a
&gt; haven from risk. In fact, private investors have already turned away
&gt; from dollar assets: the returns on investments in America have recently
&gt; been lower than in Europe or Japan (see article). And can a currency
&gt; that has been sliding against the world's next two biggest currencies
&gt; for 30 years be regarded as &quot;safe&quot;?

&gt; In a free market, without the massive support of Asian central banks,
&gt; the dollar would be far weaker. In any case, such support has its
&gt; limits, and the dollar now seems likely to fall further. How harmful
&gt; will the economic consequences be? Will it really undermine the dollar's
&gt; reserve-currency status?

&gt; Periods of dollar decline have often been unhappy for the world economy.
&gt; The breakdown of Bretton Woods that led to a weaker dollar in the early
&gt; 1970s was painful for all, contributing to rising inflation and
&gt; recession. In the late 1980s, the falling dollar had few ill-effects on
&gt; America's economy, but it played a big role in inflating a bubble in
&gt; Japan by forcing Japanese authorities to slash interest rates.

&gt; This time round, it is a bad sign that everybody is trying to point the
&gt; finger of blame at somebody else. America says its external deficit is
&gt; mainly due to sluggish growth in Europe and Japan, and to the fact that
&gt; China is pegging its exchange rate too low. Europe, alarmed at the
&gt; &quot;brutal&quot; rise in the euro, says that America's high public borrowing and
&gt; low household saving are the real culprits.

&gt; There is something to both these claims. China and other Asian economies
&gt; should indeed let their currencies rise, relieving pressure on the euro.
&gt; It is also true that Asia is partly to blame for America's consumer
&gt; binge: its central banks' large purchases of Treasury bonds have
&gt; depressed bond yields, encouraging households in the United States to
&gt; take out bigger mortgages and spend the cash. And Europe needs to
&gt; accept, as it is unwilling to, that a weaker dollar will be a good thing
&gt; if it helps to shrink America's deficit and curb the risk of a future
&gt; crisis. At the same time, Europe is also right: most of the blame for
&gt; America's deficit lies at home. America needs to cut its budget deficit.
&gt; It is not a question of either do this or do that: a cheaper dollar and
&gt; higher American saving are both needed if a crunch is to be avoided.

&gt; Simple but harsh

&gt; Many American policymakers talk as though it is better to rely entirely
&gt; on a falling dollar to solve, somehow, all their problems. Conceivably,
&gt; it could happen--but such a one-sided remedy would most likely be far
&gt; more painful than they imagine. America's challenge is not just to
&gt; reduce its current-account deficit to a level which foreigners are happy
&gt; to finance by buying more dollar assets, but also to persuade existing
&gt; foreign creditors to hang on to their vast stock of dollar assets,
&gt; estimated at almost $11 trillion. A fall in the dollar sufficient to
&gt; close the current-account deficit might destroy its safe-haven status.

&gt; there was international trust in the dollar, now there is not. The ruble

With economics one should never bet. A major source of the problems of
the dollar is the fact that it is a so-called 'low yield currency'.
Dollar interest rates are low and being lowered; interest rates on
dollar savings and the return on conservative investments is lower than
inflation. The US government seems to be encouraging the American
population to spend rather than save or invest conservatively. As I see
it, there are two possible major scenarios.

1. The Chinese, Russians, and Middle East oil states decide that a
reliable dollar is in their interest and do everything they can to
compensate for the domestic financial mismanagement that has allowed the
dollar to slip as it has been doing during the past few months. This
will mean that they hold on to their dollar holdings and try to ride out
the storm. Then a dollar rate between 10 and 13 kroons is possible next
year.

2.  The Chinese, Russians, Japanese, and Middle East oil states, or at
least one of this constellation, decide that it is no longer in their
interests to hold vast amounts of dollars that are rapidly losing value
due to American cynicism, interest rates that are lower than inflation,
and domestic financial mismanagement. They sell off a major part of
their dollar holdings, thus driving down the international exchange rate
because fewer and fewer people are interested in buying or holding a
mismanaged currency.

No matter which of these scenarios occurs, we must not forget that the
Chinese, Russians, Japanese, and Middle Easterners own a massive amount
of dollars. Decisions made in Beijing, Moscow, Tokyo, Riyadh, and
Bahrein rather than decisions made in Washington D.C. are going to
determine the fate of the dollar in the short term. The Bush
administration, which seems to be quite happy to allow the dollar to
slide in order make American exports cheaper, imports to the US more
expensive, and domestic consumption good and savings a poor option, will
be with us for some fifteen more months. A lot can change during such a
long period. It is not written in gold that  dollar must forever be the
international reserve currency, nor can the Americans assume that the
major players are going to continue to stand by and watch America spend
itself into oblivion with others picking up the tab.

My bet is that the major decision maker will be China. For the time
being, China has enjoyed domestic growth rates in excess of 11%, but it
has seen much of that achievement eroded internationally because Beijing
wants to retain its favorable market position in the United States and
has allowed the yuan to slide downwards with the dollar. Much the same
holds for the Japanese yen. Given that the EU is a larger economy than
the US, and that Russia is also beginning to flex its economic biceps,
there is no reason to assume that Chinese and Japanese good-will are
givens. Nor, for that matter, should we assume that the oil producing
countries in the Middle East will continue the practice of pricing and
selling their oil in dollars only.

The West didn't gain its present prestige and status by playing the role
of the angels. The Baltic peoples survived Russian colonialism, most of
the indigenous peoples of the Americas and Australia, and many of those
of Africa, did not. This fact must be taken into account when trying to

Colonialism, regime changes imposed violently from the outside, ethnic
cleansing, and forced modernization have been the scourges of the past
four centuries. It doesn't matter whether the forces imposing them come
from the East or the West, neither does one need the involvement of the
Kremlin to see this and call it what it is.

No country must dream about exclusive superiority forever, so it is
clear one day both US and their currency will be changed by some new
center of economical and polital power. But it is not so close future.
About interest rates below inflation - from Keynes times it is a rule
for all World economy forcing people to invest (and take risks)
instead of sitting just on guaranteed incomes from bank interests.
Fans of Keynes say this make too big depressions like in thirties
impossible.
My speculation is that behind low interests are calculations of banks
that dollar don't stay as cheap as it is. If otherwise, it would be
profitable to offer high rates with clear knowledge that when those
interests will be payed out, they will appear cheap for banks due even
lower dollar value. Unhappily I'm not a rich, otherwise I would be
start to buy dollars to use them when they are of much higher value
again.

Hah, you don't like captain that the damned Russkies figured out that
double standard is applied?
So now we hear a new tune: a double standard is natural and legitimate -
anybody who rejects it is an evil &quot;whataboutist&quot;.

Well, what can I say to those upset by such developments - face the
music and adopt or become a soar loser like Lucas.

Russia now is back in the game and the rules will not be dictated by one
side. That is a rule from now on.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You are not twenty years old, Eugene and you surely know that trend
&gt; &gt; &gt; for today morning is just for today morning. I would be really
&gt; &gt; &gt; surprised if dollar would become a junk currency in 10-15 years to
&gt; &gt; &gt; come. Let's play prophets: my guess, that at the end of 2008 dollar is
&gt; &gt; &gt; about 13 kroons, so approx 10% stronger against euro then today. Your
&gt; &gt; &gt; bet?

&gt; &gt; With economics one should never bet. A major source of the problems of
&gt; &gt; the dollar is the fact that it is a so-called 'low yield currency'.
&gt; &gt; Dollar interest rates are low and being lowered; interest rates on
&gt; &gt; dollar savings and the return on conservative investments is lower than
&gt; &gt; inflation. The US government seems to be encouraging the American
&gt; &gt; population to spend rather than save or invest conservatively. As I see
&gt; &gt; it, there are two possible major scenarios.

&gt; &gt; 1. The Chinese, Russians, and Middle East oil states decide that a
&gt; &gt; reliable dollar is in their interest and do everything they can to
&gt; &gt; compensate for the domestic financial mismanagement that has allowed the
&gt; &gt; dollar to slip as it has been doing during the past few months. This
&gt; &gt; will mean that they hold on to their dollar holdings and try to ride out
&gt; &gt; the storm. Then a dollar rate between 10 and 13 kroons is possible next
&gt; &gt; year.

&gt; &gt; 2.  The Chinese, Russians, Japanese, and Middle East oil states, or at
&gt; &gt; least one of this constellation, decide that it is no longer in their
&gt; &gt; interests to hold vast amounts of dollars that are rapidly losing value
&gt; &gt; due to American cynicism, interest rates that are lower than inflation,
&gt; &gt; and domestic financial mismanagement. They sell off a major part of
&gt; &gt; their dollar holdings, thus driving down the international exchange rate
&gt; &gt; because fewer and fewer people are interested in buying or holding a
&gt; &gt; mismanaged currency.

&gt; &gt; No matter which of these scenarios occurs, we must not forget that the
&gt; &gt; Chinese, Russians, Japanese, and Middle Easterners own a massive amount
&gt; &gt; of dollars. Decisions made in Beijing, Moscow, Tokyo, Riyadh, and
&gt; &gt; Bahrein rather than decisions made in Washington D.C. are going to
&gt; &gt; determine the fate of the dollar in the short term. The Bush
&gt; &gt; administration, which seems to be quite happy to allow the dollar to
&gt; &gt; slide in order make American exports cheaper, imports to the US more
&gt; &gt; expensive, and domestic consumption good and savings a poor option, will
&gt; &gt; be with us for some fifteen more months. A lot can change during such a
&gt; &gt; long period. It is not written in gold that  dollar must forever be the
&gt; &gt; international reserve currency, nor can the Americans assume that the
&gt; &gt; major players are going to continue to stand by and watch America spend
&gt; &gt; itself into oblivion with others picking up the tab.

&gt; &gt; My bet is that the major decision maker will be China. For the time
&gt; &gt; being, China has enjoyed domestic growth rates in excess of 11%, but it
&gt; &gt; has seen much of that achievement eroded internationally because Beijing
&gt; &gt; wants to retain its favorable market position in the United States and
&gt; &gt; has allowed the yuan to slide downwards with the dollar. Much the same
&gt; &gt; holds for the Japanese yen. Given that the EU is a larger economy than
&gt; &gt; the US, and that Russia is also beginning to flex its economic biceps,
&gt; &gt; there is no reason to assume that Chinese and Japanese good-will are
&gt; &gt; givens. Nor, for that matter, should we assume that the oil producing
&gt; &gt; countries in the Middle East will continue the practice of pricing and
&gt; &gt; selling their oil in dollars only.

&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt; Eugene Holman

&gt; No country must dream about exclusive superiority forever, so it is
&gt; clear one day both US and their currency will be changed by some new
&gt; center of economical and polital power. But it is not so close future.
&gt; About interest rates below inflation - from Keynes times it is a rule
&gt; for all World economy forcing people to invest (and take risks)
&gt; instead of sitting just on guaranteed incomes from bank interests.
&gt; Fans of Keynes say this make too big depressions like in thirties
&gt; impossible.
&gt; My speculation is that behind low interests are calculations of banks
&gt; that dollar don't stay as cheap as it is. If otherwise, it would be
&gt; profitable to offer high rates with clear knowledge that when those
&gt; interests will be payed out, they will appear cheap for banks due even
&gt; lower dollar value. Unhappily I'm not a rich, otherwise I would be
&gt; start to buy dollars to use them when they are of much higher value
&gt; again.
