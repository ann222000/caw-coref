High IQ link to being vegetarian

[Caption] Vegetarianism has been linked to better heart
health

BBC
Friday, December 15, 2006

Intelligent children are more likely to become vegetarians
later in life, a study says.

A Southampton University team found those who were
vegetarian by 30 had recorded five IQ points more on
average at the age of 10.

Researchers said it could explain why people with higher IQ
were healthier as a vegetarian diet was linked to lower
heart disease and obesity rates.

The study of 8,179 was reported in the British Medical
Journal.

Twenty years after the IQ tests were carried out in 1970,
366 of the participants said they were vegetarian -
although more than 100 reported eating either fish or
chicken.

Men who were vegetarian had an IQ score of 106, compared
with 101 for non-vegetarians; while female vegetarians
averaged 104, compared with 99 for non-vegetarians.

"We've always known that vegetarianism is an
intelligent, compassionate choice benefiting animals,
people and the environment"
- Liz O'Neill, of The Vegetarian Society

There was no difference in IQ score between strict
vegetarians and those who said they were vegetarian but who
reported eating fish or chicken.

Researchers said the findings were partly related to better
education and higher occupational social class, but it
remained statistically significant after adjusting for
these factors.

Vegetarians were more likely to be female, to be of higher
occupational social class and to have higher academic or
vocational qualifications than non-vegetarians.

However, these differences were not reflected in their
annual income, which was similar to that of non-
vegetarians.

Lead researcher Catharine Gale said: "The finding that
children with greater intelligence are more likely to
report being vegetarian as adults, together with the
evidence on the potential benefits of a vegetarian diet on
heart health, may help to explain why higher IQ in
childhood or adolescence is linked with a reduced risk of
coronary heart disease in adult life."

Intelligence

However, she added the link may be merely an example of
many other lifestyle preferences that might be expected to
vary with intelligence, such as choice of newspaper, but
which may or may not have implications for health.

Liz O'Neill, of the Vegetarian Society, said: "We've always
known that vegetarianism is an intelligent, compassionate
choice benefiting animals, people and the environment.

"Now we've got the scientific evidence to prove it. Maybe
that explains why many meat-reducers are keen to call
themselves vegetarians when even they must know that
vegetarians don't eat chicken, turkey or fish."

But Dr Frankie Phillips, of the British Dietetic
Association, said: "It is like the chicken and the egg. Do
people become vegetarian because they have a very high IQ
or is it just that they tend to be more aware of health
issues?"

good point. the standard hindu veggie diet is well balanced in my view from
all angles. i mean not just nutritionally speaking, but in such terms as
being satisfying, tasty, digestive. of course, takes a while to get used to
the curry rising up the throat for several hours after meals in the
beginning. only negative is the cooking time, which, now due to modernity
and technology coming into india  of late is getting to be a less problem.

'Anthropologies 'Man The Hunter' concept is still used as a
reason for justifying the consumption of animal flesh as food.
This has even extended as far as suggesting that animal foods
have enabled or caused human brain enlargement. Allegedly
this is because of the greater availability of certain kinds of
fats and the sharing behaviour associated with eating raw
animal food. The reality is that through natural selection, the
environmental factors our species have been exposed to
selected for greater brain development, long before raw animal
flesh became a significant part of our ancient ancestors diet.
The elephant has also developed a larger brain than the human
brain, on a diet primarily consisting of fermented foliage and
fruits. It is my hypothesis that it is eating fruits and perhaps
blossoms, that has, if anything, contributed the most in allowing
humans to develop relatively larger brains than other species.
The ability of humans to develop normal brains with a dietary
absence of animal products is also noted.
..
Given a plentiful supply of fruits the mother does not have to
risk expending much of her effort obtaining difficult to get foods
like raw animal flesh, insects, nuts and roots. Furthermore, fruits
contain abundant supplies of sugars which the brain solely uses
for energy. The mother who's genes better dispose her for an
easy life on fruits would have an advantage of those who do not,
and similarly, the fruit species which is the best food for mother
and child nutrition, would tend to be selected for. There is now
little doubt amongst distinguished biologists that fruit has been
the most significant dietary constituent in the evolution of humans.
..
What are the essential biochemical properties of human metabolism
which distinguish us from our non-human primate relatives? One, at
least, is our uniquely low protein requirement as described by Olav
T. Oftedal who says:

"Human milk has the lowest protein concentration (about 7% of
energy) of any primate milk that has been studied. In general, it
appears that primates produce small daily amounts of a relatively
dilute milk (Oftedal 1984). Thus the protein and energy demands
of lactation are probably low for primates by comparison to the
demands experienced by many other mammals." The nutritional
consequences of foraging in primates: the relationship of nutrient
intakes to nutrient requirements, p.161 Philosophical Transactions:
Biological Sciences vol 334, 159-295, No. 1270

One might imagine that given our comparatively 'low protein' milk,
we would not be able to grow very fast. In fact, as the image on the
right shows, human infants show very rapid growth, especially of
the brain, during the first year of life. Human infants are born a full
year earlier than they would be projected to, based on comparisons
with other animals. This is because of the large size their brains
reach. A human infant grows at the rate of 9 kg/year at birth, falling
to 3.5 kg/year a year later. Thereafter its growth rate is about half
that of a chimpanzees at 2 kg/year vs. about 4.5 kg/year. Humans
are relatively half as bulky as the other great apes, thus allowing
nutrients to be directed at brain development and the diet to be less
demanding. The advantages of such an undemanding metabolism
are clear. Humans delay their growth because they 'catch up' later,
during puberty as seen on the graph. Even so, the growth rate never
reaches that of a newborn infant who grows best by only eating
breast milk.
...
According to Exequiel M. Patiño and Juan T. Borda 'Primate milks
contain on the average 13% solids, of which 6.5% is lactose, 3.8%
lipids, 2.4% proteins, and 0.2% ash. Lactose is the largest
component of the solids, and protein is a lesser one'. They also say
that 'milks of humans and Old World monkeys have the highest
percentages of sugar (an average of 6.9%)' and when comparing
human and non human primate milks, they have similar proportions
of solids, but human milks has more sugar and fat whereas the non
human primate milks have much more protein. They continue 'In
fact, human milk has the lowest concentration of proteins (1.0%)
of all the species of primates.' Patiño and Borda present their
research in order to allow other primatologists to construct artificial
milks as a substitute for the real thing for captive primates. It is to
be expected that these will have similar disasterous consequences
as the feeding of artificial bovine, and other false milks, has had on
human infants.

Patiño and Borda also present a table which compares primate
milks. This table is shown below and identifies the distinctive
lower protein requirements of humans.  [see link]

Undoubtedly these gross metabolic differences between humans
and other mammals must have system wide implications for our
metabolism. They allow us to feed heavily on fruits, and may
restrict other species from choosing them. Never the less, many
nutritional authorities suggest that adult humans need nearly double
(12% of calorific value) their breast milk levels of protein, although
it is accepted that infant protein requirements for growth are triple
those of adults. The use of calorific values might also confuse the
issue since human milk is highly dilute (1% protein), and clearly
eating foods that might be 25 times this concentration, such as
meat, are massive excesses if constantly ingested. Certainly the
body might manage to deal with this excess without suffering
immediate problems, but this is not proof of any beneficial
adaptation. It also needs to be pointed out that berries, such as
raspberries, may yield up to 21% of their calorific value from
protein, but are not regarded as 'good sources' of protein by
nutritional authorites. There are millions of fruits available to wild
animals, and blanked generalisations about the qualities of certain
food groups, need to be examined carefully, due to some
misconceptions arising from the limited commercial fruits which
we experience in the domestic state.

The weaning of a fruigivorous primate would clearly demand the
supply of a food with nutritional characteristics similar to those
of the mothers milk. We must realise that supportive breast
feeding may continue for up to 9 or 10 years in some 'primitive'
peoples, and this is more likely to be representative of our
evolutionary history than the 6 month limit often found in modern
cultures. This premature weaning should strike any aware
naturalist as being a disasterous activity, inflicting untold damage.
However, what we do know of the consequences is that it
reduces the IQ and disease resistance of the child, and that the
substitute of unnatural substances, like wheat and dairy products,
is pathogenic.

Finally we need to compare some food group compositions with
human milk in order to establish if any statistical similarity exists.
This would demonstrate that modern humans have inherited their
ancient fruigivorous metabolism. This data is examined below in
the final sections of the article.

&gt; &gt; Intelligent children are more likely to become vegetarians
&gt; &gt; later in life, a study says.

&gt; &gt; A Southampton University team found those who were
&gt; &gt; vegetarian by 30 had recorded five IQ points more on
&gt; &gt; average at the age of 10.

&gt; &gt; Researchers said it could explain why people with higher IQ
&gt; &gt; were healthier as a vegetarian diet was linked to lower
&gt; &gt; heart disease and obesity rates.

&gt; &gt; The study of 8,179 was reported in the British Medical
&gt; &gt; Journal.

&gt; &gt; Twenty years after the IQ tests were carried out in 1970,
&gt; &gt; 366 of the participants said they were vegetarian -
&gt; &gt; although more than 100 reported eating either fish or
&gt; &gt; chicken.

&gt; &gt; Men who were vegetarian had an IQ score of 106, compared
&gt; &gt; with 101 for non-vegetarians; while female vegetarians
&gt; &gt; averaged 104, compared with 99 for non-vegetarians.

&gt; &gt;    &quot;We've always known that vegetarianism is an
&gt; &gt;    intelligent, compassionate choice benefiting animals,
&gt; &gt;    people and the environment&quot;
&gt; &gt;    - Liz O'Neill, of The Vegetarian Society

&gt; &gt; There was no difference in IQ score between strict
&gt; &gt; vegetarians and those who said they were vegetarian but who
&gt; &gt; reported eating fish or chicken.

&gt; &gt; Researchers said the findings were partly related to better
&gt; &gt; education and higher occupational social class, but it
&gt; &gt; remained statistically significant after adjusting for
&gt; &gt; these factors.

&gt; &gt; Vegetarians were more likely to be female, to be of higher
&gt; &gt; occupational social class and to have higher academic or
&gt; &gt; vocational qualifications than non-vegetarians.

&gt; &gt; However, these differences were not reflected in their
&gt; &gt; annual income, which was similar to that of non-
&gt; &gt; vegetarians.

&gt; &gt; Lead researcher Catharine Gale said: &quot;The finding that
&gt; &gt; children with greater intelligence are more likely to
&gt; &gt; report being vegetarian as adults, together with the
&gt; &gt; evidence on the potential benefits of a vegetarian
