&quot;Supporters Of The Lie&quot;

A poem about the war in Iraq

A Service OfLoveAllPeople.org

This entire venture in Iraq has certainly not worked out the way its
supporters had hoped, and nobody seems to have any real idea about what to
do next, except to keep on doing more of what we have already done:
improvise, and hope for the best.

So as we slowly grope our way toward civil war in Iraq, it's a good time
to look back and reflect on what really happened to us, and why we should
never do anything this stupid again. I hope this little blank-verse poem
helps to clarify the big picture.

A Poem About The War In Iraq

It started out to be a simple thing:
&quot;Convince the People that we need a war.
It really won't be very hard to do,
Because we've been attacked, and we can say
That we will now avenge what they have done,
And they will never do these things again.

&quot;And we can say that danger lies ahead
If we do not remove it at its source.
And we can point a finger at Saddam,
And say he is the one we need to get,
And say he's building weapons to be used
To blow us up, as quickly as he can.

&quot;And say he is a murderer, and worse -
He gasses his own people, cold and cruel,
And tortures them, and rapes them without shame.
How can we let this monster carry on?
We have a moral duty to the world,
To use our strength to rid the world of him.

&quot;And we can say he helps the terrorists!
And he will give them everything he has,
To harm us in the worst most evil ways.
We cannot wait much longer to begin.
Besides, it will be easy, quickly done.
Their people will be dancing in the streets!&quot;

And so they said these things, and we believed.
Although they always knew they told us lies.
There were no deadly weapons to be found,
Because he had destroyed them long ago.
And all the other reasons that they used
Were gross exaggerations of the truth.

And then the whole thing blew up in our face!
And nothing went the way they said it would,
Except for those first days of Shock And Awe,
When Joshua thought he was in Jericho,
And all the walls had tumbled to the ground.
But, no, that was a dream of long ago.

So now we can begin to see the truth.
The clouds of pure deceit are fading fast,
The light of truth and justice enters in.
We start to see the tragedy we caused.
We start to see the damage we have done,
We fear that nothing now can make it right.

But some have closed their eyes and stopped their ears!
They do not want to recognize the truth
Because it is so hard for them to know
That they are guilty of this grievous sin.
They stomp and yell and sputter in their rage,
And they remain supporters of The Lie.

***************************************************

NOTE: There was, however, one thing which Saddam Hussein was really doing
wrong: he was rewarding Palestinian terrorist suicide bombers against
Israel, by paying $25,000 checks to the families of the dead bombers. Was
this sufficient reason for the USA to go to war against Iraq? What do you
think? See  http://www.husseinandterror.com/  for details. Also, his other
serious offense, many years earlier, was to launch SCUD missiles against
Israel in the first Gulf War. So Israel clearly had good reason to want
Saddam removed. But were these reasons good enough to force the USA into
starting a war under false pretenses? What do you think?

Blessings to you. May God help us all.
