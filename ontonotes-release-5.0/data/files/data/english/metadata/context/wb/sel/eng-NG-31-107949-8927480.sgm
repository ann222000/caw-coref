There's also the question of why OT to multiple groups. I should be thankful
they aren't separate threads at least, since my newsreader will show them as
read (or not) across each one.

If there's a way to tie Gonzales into a Bush conspiracy to keep cyclists
down, fine. And, frankly, I'm surprised we don't see more posts of that
nature, but maybe not, since that would require digging into things a bit
and, good heavens, motivating people to get involved... much more so than
talking about &quot;lying Bushco Fascist&quot; in a bike group.

Prolly more accurate. ;-)

Talk of the Nation's Neil Conan has got Bush apologist frmr WH
counsel, Francisco on right now playing the victim. It's pretty
chilling--he's painting the problem as 100% opposition witch hunting
and has used the creepy word, &quot;the homeland&quot; something like fifty
times. Didn't catch his first name, but he sounds like a first rate
authoritarian.

512 more days of this evil till we get the magnificent ego of Giuliani
to replace it. I think I'll have to get some presidential pom poms to
shake! (not)

One thought ::  today a Black man pleads guilty and will go to jail for
killing a dog.  An Hispanic man who
has worked very hard to be a great American gets the heave ho, and resigns.

Then a Jewish senator from NY, comes on tv and gloats about it.

Duh?

And you wonder why there is a problem in this country.

Smoken ...
He killed a dog.  Not a person.  A dog.  A stupid dog.

Sen Ted Kennedy drove his car off a bridge, left a woman in the car to drown
while he ran away.

She died scratching at the ceiling of the car trying to get out.

He didn't go to jail.  He was re-elected .. over and over again.

How is it that killing a dog or dogs is more henious than leaving someone in
your car to drown.

Remember, he didn't even report that she was in the car.

She died slow.. gasping ... scratching .....

I'm not justifying Ted Kennedy's past indescretions, he should have
gotten what was coming to him, too. Those &quot;stupid dogs&quot; are living
creatures that have rights, too. What the fuck did they ever do to
Michael Vick to deserve being hung, drowned, or electrocuted by him?
And what about the co-defendants who are willing to testify that MV
financed the gambling of this illegal and shameful operation? What he
did was illegal, even though you have no compassion for the animals
that were cruelly treated and executed. When you perform criminal acts
in this country, you go to jail, that's the way it works, no matter
who you are. I want to know why a multi-millionaire star athlete feels
that he had to do these heinous acts to entertain himself and others?
Why do some professional athletes sell drugs, beat their mates,
promote dogfights, and do other illegal things? Not all athletes act
this way, many dedicate much of their spare time to worthy charitable
causes. It's a damned shame that the Michael Vicks of the world put
such a black eye on professional sportsmen and women.

==================================================================
Tell that to the Goldman family.  OJ is playing golf.

The court system in the USA is For Sale.  The rich get off, the poor go to
jail.

If M Vicks didn't need to return to play football he could have just told
the court system to go
F off.  Then, when he came up for trial?  The old &quot;you are picking on Black
people&quot;.

And he would probably be right.  From what I read, dog fighting is most
popular in Black neighborhoods in the
USA.

Whitey has Las Vegas.

One irony;  Vicks plays for Atlanta.  The Georgia football team is
nicknamed:::::

The Bulldogs ..

I think that abusing animals is despicable, but they have no

I have no problem with him disposing of unwanted dogs as long as it
was humanely done.  To me killing an animal is not crime. There is no
distinction, to me, between a chicken and a dog in that regard.

Anyone who thinks culling unwanted animals from a breeding program had
better not have a pure bred dog, because culling is how the breed was
developed.  Again, it needs to be done humanely and with a purpose in
mind, not just wanton cruelty.

I do have a problem with cruelty to animals, but that is based on my

That is one of the rights animals have, not to be abused. That's why
we have laws protecting them. I defy you to find anywhere in my post

that decent law-abiding human beings protect through animal cruelty

That is debatable - the way chickens are overcrowded on factory farms
can be considered cruel.

Bill, I certainly didn't intend to defend or justify any torture of
animals.  I was just trying to say that I personally don't believe
that humanely killing a dog should be a crime.  You're describing
torture and inhumane treatment.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not justifying Ted Kennedy's past indescretions, he should have

&gt; &gt; &gt; creatures that have rights, too. What the fuck did they ever do to
&gt; &gt; &gt; Michael Vick to deserve being hung, drowned, or electrocuted by him?

&gt; &gt; I think that abusing animals is despicable, but they have no
&gt; &gt; &quot;rights&quot;.  Our constitution does not address animals.

&gt; &gt; I have no problem with him disposing of unwanted dogs as long as it
&gt; &gt; was humanely done.  To me killing an animal is not crime. There is no
&gt; &gt; distinction, to me, between a chicken and a dog in that regard.

&gt; &gt; Anyone who thinks culling unwanted animals from a breeding program had
&gt; &gt; better not have a pure bred dog, because culling is how the breed was

Sorry if I read more into what you're saying.  I do believe personally
that animals don't have inherant rights.  They have only the
protections that our laws give them.  Just my opinion.  I don't think
it's a contradiciton for me to say I support laws that protect animals
from grossly inhumane treatment.  Dog fighting, to me, is inhumane.
To kill a dog with anything but humane quickness is inhumane.

It's fucking barbaric and needs to be stopped.  Unfortunately, given all the
money, drugs and God knows what else was involved, the requested sentences
of 12-18 months likely will do little to end the &quot;sport&quot;.  I hope the judge
gives 'em plenty more, if for no other reason than to make a statement to
other participants that they'd better quit.

I doubt it will happen, however.

The killing of lesser performers was mild stuff compared to what these jerks
do while training their dogs.     Google &quot;bait animals&quot; and read about the
training tactics of fighting dogs.   They get smaller animals, usually
rabbits, cats and smaller dogs, hang them up and let their fighters tear
them apart to develop their jaw muscles, the few survivors are then given to
the dog to kill as a reward.    These smaller animals are usually stolen or
come from people who advertise as &quot;free to a good home&quot;.   If the media
would make this act public, Vick would be locked up for a looooong time.

Peregrine ,, anti semitic?  It was the truth.  Sen Schumer of NY.

Don't you think that the minority communities don't see this and ask
themselves ???

Vick is Black, he goes to jail for dog fighting.  Yet, some white guy on
Wall St will get off with nothing
and will steal more money in a day than all the dog fighting rings in the
world.

Attorney Gonzalez is Hispanic.  Yes?

Do you really think if he was Jewish Sen Schumer would be calling him
vicious names on tv?
The Senator might call for his resignation but not the name calling.

This is not lost on the minority communities in this country.

My point?  That the judgement of one group by another causes the mistrust
and hatred that exists in the USA.

If that is anti semitic,,, so be it.

Ted Kennedy did something bad and got away with it. OJ Simpson
(probably) did something bad and got away with it. Michael Vick did
something bad and will be going to prison. Different crimes, different
circumstances, different results.

A couple of observations:

1) None of these cases has anything to do with the situations that lead
to the resignation.

2) It is a logical fallacy to suggest that person A should not be
punished because the government didn't punish (or failed to prosecute)
persons B, C, D, E...
By that logic, the prosecutors should not bring any charges against
persons responsible for drunk driving fatalities because, sometime in
the past, a noted senator managed to get away with it. Or, prosecutors
should give all dog killers a pass until all human killers have been
caught and put behind bars.

If you feel that Alberto Gonzales was unjustly forced to resign, then
state your arguments why the charges against him are unfair or
misdirected. But pointing out other (unrelated) instances of injustice
does not advance your argument.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To me killing an animal is not crime. There is no

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cock-fighting is illegal, too.  Chicken farms don't /torture/ the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone who thinks culling unwanted animals from a breeding program

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a purpose in mind, not just wanton cruelty.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These dogs were soaked in water and fried (electrocuted), hung by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the neck, slammed into the ground until they could no longer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; breathe, choked to death, knifed, throats cut, etc.  The LUCKY ones
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; got a bullet in the brain.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Get a fucking clue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ... have a problem with cruelty to animals, but that is based on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my moral feelings, not because I think that animals have

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, real moral.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What almost everyone is forgetting is that a starting NFL
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quarterback was involved in an INTERSTATE GAMBLING RING (AKA
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;organized crime&quot;).  How long would it have been (or WAS it) until
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vick started throwing games or at the very least affecting/fixing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point spreads?  To me, THAT is why he can never be allowed back in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the league.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill &quot;awaiting the wrist slap&quot; S.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill, I certainly didn't intend to defend or justify any torture of
&gt;&gt;&gt; animals.  I was just trying to say that I personally don't believe
&gt;&gt;&gt; that humanely killing a dog should be a crime.  You're describing
&gt;&gt;&gt; torture and inhumane treatment.

&gt;&gt; Which is exactly what Michael Vick did.  Pitbull fighting is torture
&gt;&gt; and inhumane to start with, and killing the lesser &quot;performers&quot; by
&gt;&gt; the means he and others did only adds to the horror.  These aren't
&gt;&gt; dumb animals with barely a brain and nervous systems; dogs are
&gt;&gt; smart, have personalities, and are flesh, bone, muscle and blood. (Not to
&gt;&gt; mention domesticated and thus dependent on -- and trusting
&gt;&gt; of -- humans.) I hope that Virginia goes after these guys since the Feds
&gt;&gt; wimped
&gt;&gt; out.  Too bad one wasn't named Scooter...

&gt; The killing of lesser performers was mild stuff compared to what
&gt; these jerks do while training their dogs.     Google &quot;bait animals&quot;
&gt; and read about the training tactics of fighting dogs.   They get
&gt; smaller animals, usually rabbits, cats and smaller dogs, hang them up
&gt; and let their fighters tear them apart to develop their jaw muscles,
&gt; the few survivors are then given to the dog to kill as a reward.   These
&gt; smaller animals are usually stolen or come from people who
&gt; advertise as &quot;free to a good home&quot;.   If the media would make this
&gt; act public, Vick would be locked up for a looooong time.

Of course my argument that mistreatment, unfair charges is relevant to the
Vick situation.

Let's take Albeto Gonzales first.  He was attacked for firing a few US
Attorneys.  Bill Clinton
fired all the US Attorneys when he came into office.  Yet, the same Senators
who are outraged now,
sat on their outrage when Clinton acted.
Take Ted Kennedy, Senator from MASS.  He attacks Alberto Gonzales?  The same
man who killed a woman
by letting her drown while he ran and hid?  Yet, this reprobate has the gaul
to call Albelto names?

It is illogical to not site the Senator's actions if said Senator is calling
on Attorney General Gonzales to resign
because said Senator is outraged by the behavior of Attorney General
Gonzales even though Gonzales's behavior
so far has been shown to be legal, and followed the same guidelines set by
President Clinton.

The problem with your logic is a rather convienent historical case of
amnesia.  What happened to Black men in the south of the USA
if they looked at a white woman back during the 1930's?  They were hanged by
the KKK.

Did white men who looked at Black women during the same time period get
hanged by the KKK?

Of course not.

Now, we have a Black man who participated in dog fighting.  He is going to
jail.  Yet, is his crime as serious
as crimes being committed by white collar criminals?

An unequal system of justice is not justice.

If you can't grasp this basic fundamental of fairness, you are blind.

Michael Vick may indeed be the subject of unfair charges and
mistreatment. Mr Vick came to the attention of Federal authorities
because he (allegedly) helped organize, bankroll, and run an illegal
gambling operation. These are very serious charges. A conviction on the
gambling operation charges would have landed Mr. Vick in prison for a
very long time. So in the end, he decided to plead guilty to the lesser
charges of dog fighting and killing dogs.

Are Mr Vick's crimes as serious as some white collar crimes? Probably
not, but then that is a judgment call on my part. But what you need to
understand is that the penalties for breaking a particular law are
defined when the law is written. If you think that the penalties for
breaking a particular law are too severe - or too lenient - then you
need to petition the government to change the law.

I don't know how you managed to get to the KKK lynching Blacks in the
1930's. But you seem to be implying that since Black men and women were
unjustly treated in the past (and to a lesser extent in the present)
then we can not hold Blacks accountable for any crimes they may commit
in the present.

But then again, none of the above is relevant to the Gonzales case.

One of the duties of the Congress is oversight of the government.
Congress must ensure that the Government (and the Justice Department) is
operating fairly, efficiently, and in the best interest of all Americans.

Now, Senator Kennedy may indeed be a scumbag of the lowest order. And Mr
Gonzales may be a saint. But since Kennedy is a sitting senator - dually
elected by the people of Massachusetts - and he has every right to
inquire into the actions of the current administration and the actions
of the Attorney General.

So, I'll through it back to you. Do you believe that Mr Gonzales was
operating in the best interests of the American people when he fired
those US Attorneys? How did this action improve the Justice Department
and the lives of the American people?

I listened to his mia culpa speech. What a crock. He's also suddenly
found Jesus. That's the standard plea along with going into rehab. So
everyone is supposed to forgive and forget?

I live in Oakland, CA where there have been almost 90 homicides this year
so far. Most of the victims were African Americans and most of the perps
were young African Americans. The lack of positive role models in African
American communities has been suggested as one cause for the plague of
violent crimes in these locals.

What kind of message does this send to impressionable young people in
these communities. Do the crime, get your wrist slapped and you back out
on the street. Time in the joint is a right of passage.

Prison rape is a fact of life. Celebrity felons go to places like Club Fed
where the worst restrictions are they can't leave the place during their
sentence. The punishment should be severe enough to have some deterrent
value.

have not read details except the generalities that he's accused of the
dog fighting and killing unwanted dogs.  Yours is the first such
description of his alleged actions that I have read.

All I was saying is that humane killing of an animal should not be a
crime - in my opinion.  If what you say is true (and I have no reason
to doubt it), that is not how he treated those dogs and should
definitely be prosecuted.
