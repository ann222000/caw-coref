Hi,
I am preparing to jump into kegging and lagering and was wondering
what the opinions out there are as far as using a freezer or
refrigerator for a kegerator and lagering chamber. I am assuming that
the same appliance could be used for both.

i have seen some of the chest freezer conversions where a spacer was
inserted between the lid and freezer and was wondering if that is
necesary when using a chest freezer?

The main purpose of the collar between the lid and body of the freezer
is to give you a convenient place to drill holes for mounting your taps
and running your CO2 line into the freezer.  In the rare case of the
chest freezer being too shallow, this will give you the additional
height necessary for fitting a carboy with airlock into the freezer or
perhaps a 3 gallon keg on the hump.

It should work fine.  I'm not sure if you'll be able to use it for both
at the same time though.  That depends on what temps you serve at
compared to what temps you ferment at.

It's not necessary, but it is convenient.  The collars are done as a way to
add taps to the freezer without drilling through the lid.  You don't have to
do it that way if you don't want to.

I just added a refridgerator thermostat to a chest freezer. I use cheap
"cobra" taps, and just open the door to get to them.

cool. I was thinking i could use it for lagering a few batches at a
time then returning it to kegerator use. Is it possible to drill
through the top of the freezer to put a tap stand on top or are there
coolant tubes runing through the lid? I know my lines would have to be
long, but if i get a smaller freezer,  i was thinking of removing part
of my counter top and sticking the kegerator in the counter then
replacing the countertop (with hinges and hole to accomadate my tap
stand) so i'd have taps in my kitchen!

If i cant work this out, are there good drawings or plans for building
the collar? I was thinking if i do have to use one, i may want to have
a friend fab one out of metal.

Thanks!

Never seen one with coolant in the lid.  Think about it...  Hinges.
You'd see the tubes, and they would have to flex to get to the lid.

About all I've seen in the lid is electrical wiring for a light.

There better not be any coolant tubing in my chest freezer lid.. cuz I put
a knee on it trying to reach over and dented it good.  DOH!  At some point I'd
like to remove the lid and replace the dented foam or whatever is under the
skin.

Thanks for the info.
I've solved the dillems. bought a commercial kegerator from a guy who
upgraded. worked out well, he threw in a bunch of equipment as well.
next i'll get a freezer for a lagering chamber. i just posted a new
post about which size lines i should buy for my fittings and such.

It depends on the freezer/fridge.  I don't think a chest freezer with a
top opening lid would have coolant lines in the lid (how could it?).  Other
models will vary though.  It's best to be careful.

I've got a dorm fridge mounted under my bar.  The dispensing lines come
out the side of the fridge and then run up to the tower that is mounted
to the top of the bar.  It's not ideal, but it works OK.  Eventually I'd
like to extend the tower so that it runs straight into the fridge and
keep the lines cold.  I'm a little nervous about drilling through the
top of my fridge though.

I don't have any handy, but I've seen people post links to collar designs
on here before.  Maybe hunt around in old posts, etc.
