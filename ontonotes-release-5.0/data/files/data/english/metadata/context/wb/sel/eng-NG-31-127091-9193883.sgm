Op-Ed Columnist: Save the Planet: Vote Smart (October 21, 2007)

Re “Save the Planet: Vote Smart,” by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Oct.
21), argues that individual actions are largely irrelevant when it comes
to problems such as global warming, but that a change in leaders can
have a large-scale effect.

There is at least one area where Mr. Friedman is a little off.

If I have five children, and each of them has five, and so on down the
line, the cumulative effect will be large.

So while it may be impolite — or even politically incorrect — to suggest
that people have fewer children, doing so is one sure way of having a
substantial effect. And since each of our votes counts for so little, it
may well be the only way.

Excellent.

I wish he'd said &quot;fewer or none&quot; but it's still good.

Let's see- the outraged response will include &quot;Then who are we saving
the planet FOR?&quot;

Environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote the book &quot;Maybe One,&quot; about his
choice with wife to have one child only. Of course, most of the book was
filled with treacle about how amazing said child is, very boring and
breedry.

We are apparently saving the planet for those who have no plans to stop
overbreeding! Instead of feeding the starving nations we could teach them
birth control???

Hey, we could neuter all those who attempt to cross our borders - and make
them return with the kids they already have? At least keep the countries
they are illegally entering from becoming the poverty pits they are running
from and not accept the anchor kids as ours.

The other night they had on a program touting their new find - PlumpNutter
(I think it was called). It's a peanut butter based high protein paste that
is saving staving children in one of poorest African areas - and each mother
who came to get the stuff had an infant in each arm and several tugging at

You do realize that &quot;they&quot; who are attempting to improve things in Africa are
not one monolithic group, right?

Some people *are* trying to promote contraception and abortion, though
between the Bush Admin's &quot;gag rule,&quot; the Catlick Church's bullshit, whatever
&quot;quiverfull&quot; bullshit the fundie missionaries are piling onto *that*, Muslim
patriarchy, and whatever native cultural influences equate virility with
fathering lots of spawn. Others are indirectly doing so by creating greater
educational and business opportunities for women (Google on, say, Muhammad
Yunus).

In the meantime, there are relief efforts, like you'd see in pretty much any
famine-ravaged area. The two phenomena aren't mutually exclusive.

You don't think those women LIKE that situation, do you? Usually they
have no choice. No need to teach them anything -- just make birth
control available. In places where, say, Norplant has been made
available, women queue up to get their shot. Poor, uneducated, hubby
doesn't like it, makes no difference.

Admittedly I don't know if it works in Islamic countries. That may be
a special case of benightedness.

Call me cynical, but when I saw the 60 minutes &quot;article&quot; about
Plumpy'nuts distribution in Niger, I wondered if the respite from
malnutrition would just result in more cannon fodder later. (Niger's
population is about 80% Isl@amic.)

MSF is supposed to be a secular NGO, at a time and in parts of the world

I was only referring to the group who have been in the one area promoting

That would be a reasonable conclusion.
Glanced over an article about overpopulation yesterday in the NY
Times, about how overpopulation is getting to be the biggest problem
(which we know), but the &quot;expert&quot; insisted that the solution is not
reducing population, because that's &quot;simplistic&quot;, and what is needed
is better allocation of resources!

Fucking A, that's been preached for thousands of years, and so far, it
hasn't worked, so why the hell does this &quot;expert&quot; feel that it will
work if we just add more people?  Here in the USA, the richest nation
ever, we refuse to share, so you've got homeless citizens dying, and
the richest get richer.

Why is it that even educated people simply refuse to understand that
if we don't have birth control, we'll get death control?

&gt;Op-Ed Columnist: Save the Planet: Vote Smart (October 21, 2007)

&gt;Re “Save the Planet: Vote Smart,” by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Oct.
&gt;21), argues that individual actions are largely irrelevant when it comes
&gt;to problems such as global warming, but that a change in leaders can
&gt;have a large-scale effect.

&gt;There is at least one area where Mr. Friedman is a little off.

&gt;If I have five children, and each of them has five, and so on down the
&gt;line, the cumulative effect will be large.

&gt;So while it may be impolite — or even politically incorrect — to suggest
&gt;that people have fewer children, doing so is one sure way of having a
&gt;substantial effect. And since each of our votes counts for so little, it
&gt;may well be the only way.

Plumpynut. I looked it up after seeing the show. Great stuff.

In development theory, there is some idea that if fewer children die
young, people will produce fewer children. Unfortunately, that seems
culturally related, and in cultures that only value women as breeders,
having more children live into adulthood simply means there are more
people (See Under: West Bank/Gaza).

Men don't want to &quot;learn about birth control.&quot; They want to have their
own clans, healthy or otherwise. Women in many cultures have no desire
to cut down on their birth production, as it's their only role and
value, and anyway, if the men don't support it, they can't do it. Try
using a diaphragm in a one-room house with no running water (or, for
that matter, hiding it) or using birth control pills without anyone
noticing, even if you can get hold of them.

I think Westerners have no idea of the conditions that the majority of
the world live in, especially the conditions for women.

In Niger, I didn't hear them discuss the men at all and no mention was made

Something just came to my mind - this refusal to use BC sounds like the
hunters who don't want the BC used on deer - they claim it doesn't work (and
it has been proven in many areas that it does) because, let's face it, then
their argument that they must hunt the deer to prevent overpopulation fails!
There would fewer deer and no excuse, then, for them to go out and slaughter
deer.

So...in the article about Niger BC was discussed  - interesting and I am
going to look it up to read. Thanks.

I've noticed a lot of websites (mostly christian) saying that
overpopulation is not a problem and that the world can easily support
about 30 billion people. They then use some rubbery figures to support
this shit, and then proceed to crap on about the evils of BC.

However I think this quote by some dickhead called Jennifer Roback
Morse nicely sums up what the REAL problem is:

&quot;The modern view of sex has created the demographic collapse of the
West, and the human void into which Islamic fertility is rapidly
flooding.&quot;

Agreed.

I used to know someone online who argued with the electronic equivalent of a
straight face that if Africans can't get birth control, they should just stop
fucking altogether. If they don't, they have no one to blame but themselves
for their miserable situations.

Trying to explain how this made no sense in the real world this made no
impression on him. After all, *he'd* gone without sex for years at a time, so
why couldn't they?

Any inferences you draw from that remark of his are correct, btw.

Well, then you can join the Peace Corps and go over to Niger and tell the
women that! If the men won't allow birth control, do you really think they
would support education (which may include birth control) for women?
And....what about all of education being offered to women in this country?

I wasn't thinking only of Africa, although I have read many memoirs and
accounts of just that. When I studied international public health, the
maternal/child class went over this in some detail. I think the primary
example was Catholic Latin America.

I am currently reading &quot;Infidel,&quot; by the Somali woman who ended up in
the Dutch parliament, and under a jihad death sentence for making a film
with (the late and murdered) Theo van Gogh about women's treatment in
many Islamic countries. So far, she gives accounts of living in Somalia,
Saudi Arabia, and Kenya, and I'm not real impressed with any treatment
of women, including (but not limited to) her reports of 100% genital
mutilation among the Somalis. And some very disquieting quotes from the
Koran, etc.

Hirsi Anan, the &quot;Infidel&quot; writer, says it is universal in Somalia (and
gives the horrifying description of her own experience). I gather
there's been some issue that UNICEF hospitals or some NGO hospital
wanted to do it in-hospital for the middle-class, so at least it
wouldn't be lethal.
A Somali doctor in Italy suggested doing a ritualistic pinprick and not
mutilation and caught all sorts of hell, since those who favor it really
want the genitalia cut off and sewn up, no ritualistic about it- they
want the stuff GONE.
It apparently is not a Muslim thing, although many African Muslims do
support it. I don't believe it's heard of in Arabic Muslim areas.

I realize that you meant as a joke, but....the reality is that in a male
dominated society, a woman has no choices about education (lack thereof) or
birth control (and lack thereof). A woman cannot be educated (she may be
perceived as smarter than her husband) and cannot use birth control (he
would then not have total control of her body as well as her mind).

Yes, there's a certain fraction of males who are ignorant, abusive
assholes. In some societies and areas of the planet the fraction
approaches unity. What's the solution? Kill 'em all and run 'em
through a thermal depolymerization plant to turn 'em into oil and
distilled water? It's not as though there's a shortage of humans
on this planet. That'd solve several problems at once but I think
there are Bleeding-Heart Liberals(tm) who'd object.

And they serve as Myrmidons for the &quot;nice&quot; men.  It's significant that
men rarely, if ever, censure other men.  &quot;Bros before hos&quot; is still
the most important factor.  The &quot;nice&quot; men use those assholes to
convince women to shut up about the abuse.
