More utter uselessness to constipate your day with FUN!

There is a large brass statue of Winnie-the-Pooh in Lima, Peru.

There are five years in a quinquennium.

The largest diamond found in the United States was a 40.23 carat white
diamond. It was found in 1924 and nicknamed the &quot;Uncle Sam.&quot;

The Mexican version of the Tooth Fairy is known as the Tooth Mouse,
which takes the tooth and leaves treasures in its place.

The average day is actually 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.09 seconds. We
have a leap year every four years to make up for this shortfall.

Wrong.

23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.09 seconds is the time it takes
the earth to rotate on it's axis (vis a vis the stars).

The average day (midnight to midnight vis a vis the sun)
is DEFINED as 24 hours.

The revolution of the earth around the sun is approximately 365.25 days
(or 366.25 earth rotations) the leap year is to make up for the 0.25
days.

Highly doubtful!

There are only eight websites (all copies of each other) referring to such a Lima statue.

There are over 1,000 websites referring to a bronze Pooh sculptures in London &amp; Winnipeg:

&lt;&lt;In 1999 a party of officers and men from the 34th Fort Garry Horse visited London Zoo and unveiled a bronze sculpture by Bill Epp of Harry Colebourn and Winnie. A copy of this statue also stands in the Winnipeg Zoo.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;We know that by 1552 John Shakespeare was living on the north-eastern
side of town, in Henley Street, thanks to his ignominious debut in the
town records on 29 April: fined a shilling, along with Humphrey Reynolds
and Adrian Quiney, for making an unauthorised DUNGHILL, sterquinarium,
or midden heap in front of the house of a neighbour, the wheelwright
William Chambers. In those days of the plague, a fine equivalent to two
days' pay for an artisan was a suitably stern judgement on those too
idle to use the communal muck-hill at the rural end of the street.
In a rare defiance of the family tradition (and his own later
practice), John Shakespeare paid his fine promptly.&gt;&gt;

The first country to ban smoking in public buildings was Bhutan, in 1629.

Not a lot of people know that.

That's not Winnie-the-Pooh. It's Paddington

And the statue at Paddington Station in London.
----------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;The children's book character Paddington Bear was named after Paddington
station. In the books he is found at the station in London, coming from
&quot;deepest, darkest Peru&quot; and with a note attached to his coat reading &quot;please
look after this bear, thank you&quot;. Because of this he is named after the
station. In real life there is a statue of Paddington Bear in the station
concourse.&gt;&gt;

- Project to free 'Paddington' bears in Peru

PERU: December 23, 2002

MACHU PICCHU, Peru - Breaking the stillness of Peru's thick green jungle,
deep growls rumble forth from a cage that is draped in black plastic and
houses a cousin of none other than Paddington, the fictitious bear beloved
by millions of children around the world.

With a swipe of a paw, the black plastic is ripped away to reveal the
black-and-white face of Pepe, a real-life spectacled bear, just like those
that inspired Michael Bond's famous 1958 children's book &quot;A Bear Called
Paddington.&quot;
In that tale, a British couple at Paddington Station in London stumble upon
and adopt a solitary, lovable young bear, just off the boat from what the
author called &quot;Darkest Peru.&quot;

Here in darkest Peru, a dozen men struggle under the anxious, 350 lb (160
kg) bear as they carry him to his new home, a special reserve just a stone's
throw from Peru's most revered archeological site, and its chief tourist
draw, the Inca citadel Machu Picchu.

Pepe has been brought to the bear sanctuary, on the ample grounds of a hotel
near Machu Picchu, from a poorly equipped zoo where he spent the first 12
years of his life, in order to reunite him with his natural habitat.

Conservationists are hoping to set bears like Pepe free in the Machu Picchu
historical sanctuary, an 88,000-acre (35,600-hectare) swathe of protected
forest - with cloud-draped hills and rivers - near Cusco, some 870 miles
(1,100 km) south-east of Peru's seaside capital, Lima.

Pepe is the third bear to call Machu Picchu home as part of a project
sponsored by the Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel Inkaterra, ecological group ITA,
and Bear Rescue, a private British foundation.

According to Manuel Tirado of Bear Rescue, the project was born by chance
when acclaimed British actor Stephen Fry, who starred in &quot;Wilde,&quot; came to
Peru last year to shoot a documentary about the original Paddington.

&quot;We are not setting up a zoo. What we want to do is promote conservation and
get the bears in a condition to be released at some point. But it looks like
Pepe, since he's older, might have to stay (in captivity) indefinitely,&quot;
said biologist Carmen Rosa Soto, who heads the project for Inkaterra.

Darwin Mendivil, Bear Rescue's head biologist, agreed. &quot;Setting Pepe free
will probably be impossible. The younger a bear is, and the less contact it
has had with people, the easier it is to return him to his natural habitat.
But we will certainly try,&quot; he said.

JUST 2,000 BEARS LEFT

Pepe's new home - and an adjoining compound housing another pair of bears,
Yogi and Paula - is a cage complete with miniature caves and a small pond,
nestled amid thick ferns and vegetation on hotel grounds.

Eventually, bears are to be moved to a nearby wooded area of 5 acres (2
hectares) enclosed by an electric fence, project officials said. There, they
will adapt to a more open environment and will learn how to forage for food
as if in the wild until they are ready to be freed completely.

The spectacled bear is the only breed of the world's eight species of bears
that inhabits tropical regions of the Andes. While its habitat stretches
from Venezuela to Bolivia, experts say the bulk of the rare species'
population - some 2,000 animals - lives in Peru.

But aggressive logging and the expansion of farm lands have encroached on
the habitat of these solitary, nocturnal animals, which are primarily
herbivores.

In Peru, the bear population has been culled due to popular beliefs that its
meat makes men strong and that its fat can cure rheumatism. Its entrails are
also used by witch doctors.

The bear earned its nickname from the whitish-yellow markings, which
resemble eye-glasses, surrounding its eyes and on its chest. No two set of
markings, which offset their black or brown coat, are alike.

In Venezuela, the bear is know as &quot;frontino,&quot; referring to the Spanish word
for forehead. In the native Andean language, Quechua, the bear is &quot;Ukuku&quot; -
&quot;half man, half bear&quot; owing to a legend in which a bear carries off a
beautiful young woman and impregnates her.

Pepe's arrival at Inkaterra heralded not only a new phase in the
conservation plan, but a new romance for the bear.

Pepe sniffed out the area and explored his cage before he ran into Paula,
the five-year-old female who greeted him by curiously sticking her nose
through the chain-link fence.

Paula, who was brought to Machu Picchu from a zoo eight months ago, was
Yogi's faithful girlfriend - until, that is, Pepe came to town.

Stretching out her snout for a bear-like kiss, Paula exchanged sharp
murmurs - which Mendivil says are sure mating signals - with Pepe.

&quot;What a flirt!&quot; said Soto. &quot;And poor Yogi - he's depressed,&quot; she added, as
four-year-old Yogi wandered back to his cave, seemingly downtrodden after
being rebuffed in his attempt to mate with Paula.

YOGI RESCUED FROM HUNGER

Before he was handed over to the Machu Picchu project by INRENA, Peru's
natural resources agency, Yogi was kept in a tiny cage in a mountain town.
Malnourished and injured, he weighed just 100 lbs (45 kg). But he has
bounced back, and now is a playful youth weighing 285 lbs (130 kg).

After eight months and a year in the cage, project officials concluded Paula
and Yogi were ready to be released in the compound enclosed by an electric
fence. There, Yogi seemed nervous in his new environment, but Paula appeared
to be right at home as she raced to the pool.

The Machu Picchu sanctuary is not the only protected area for spectacled
bears in Peru. In Chaparri, some 480 miles (800 km) north of Lima, seven
bears are held in areas enclosed by electric fences. Another bear had two
cubs after being freed.

Chaparri, whose reserve is funded by local and foreign companies, is also a
site considered to be home to a mountain spirit, or &quot;Apu,&quot; where shamans
gather medicinal herbs.

You're confusing &quot;quinquennium&quot; with &quot;sterquinarium,&quot; Art -- but I
concede that that's pretty close for you, to whom all words longer than
three letters look well-nigh indistinguishable.
