Sounds more like asshole cops to me. Did you read to the end of TFA?

"The mayor, who appeared Friday with Hamm, said she also planned to
look into the case.

"It is clear to me that the arrest was wrong, that the officers on the
scene should not have arrested the child, and on behalf of the City of
Baltimore I apologize to the boy and his parents," Dixon said."

Yep, 'specially the more you veer off the strip.

Seems like they (who the heck are "they?") are moving to more military-like

Snipped from a review 'bout Vegas on a tourist site:

"Las Vegas is not a friendly place. Henderson/Las Vegas Nevada is a
"Police State" The cops are abusive, violant and cannot be trusted. They
constantly harrass the tourist and residents. Facts on records over the
past 5 years show that Nevada cops can murder visitors &amp; abuse residents
and court judges and cornors inquest support the abuse and killings by
the cops. No cop has ever been jailed."

Hard to beat that Reno 911 bunch ain't it!

My take on this is, this is the only punishment the kid will get, and now
he'll be a martyr.  I can just see his mother yelling at the cops when
they try to talk to her.

When I was a kid and got caught doing something wrong by someone, my

No doubt.

I remember, as a 3rd grader, the counselor or teacher handed the phone
to me and told me to tell my mother that I had been bad.

The best I could do was, "I wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh," until the lady took the
phone from me. Just knew I was going to get it when I got home and
couldn't spit out more than that.

Never woulda happened with me.  My parent's standing instructions were:  "If
you get arrested, don't bother to call.  If the cops call, 1) your name is
not William Contratto, 2) you do not live at &lt;our address&gt;, and  3) they can
keep you until the court date.

Intimidated me enough that I never had to put it to the test.  Came close a
time or two.  But never had to make that call.

An earleier standing rule had to do with getting paddled at school.  If we
were ever disciplined at school, they said I'd get twice as much when I got
home.  Along about 5th grade I got into it with some other kid cuz he took
something or other from me.  The teacher didn't see him steal whatever it
was, so to maintain order in her class she paddled us both.  Being a small
town, word got back to my parents about my punishment.  My old man called me
over that night and asked "What happened?"  I laid out my whole case.  Told
him the other guy was at fault, and I was just trying to recover my
property.  Told him the teacher still punished us both.  He said "I believe
you.  Now bend over."  At first I thought he was kidding, because he really
enjoyed pulling our chains, but he was dead serious.  He said, there were no
excuses for being punished at school, and proceeded to give me twice as many
whacks as the teacher.  I think this was the only time my father ever
paddled me.
