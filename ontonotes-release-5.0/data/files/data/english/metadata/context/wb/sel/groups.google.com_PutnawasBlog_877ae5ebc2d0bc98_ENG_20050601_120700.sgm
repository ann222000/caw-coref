Decided instead of starting off with reading to give the new  Doctor Who  series a try. I've seen a lot of episodes of the original series, but never quite understood what was happening. The very premise of the show seemed to elude me. But it tuurns out that that just may be the way the show works. Granted, I'm watching the ninth episode, which probably doesn't help much, but it seems that's just the way the show works. It's incredibly bizarre, but somehow really enjoyable. But disturbingly bizarre. I've got to run; the show just took an exciting and suspenseful turn. I suspect this may be the climax.
