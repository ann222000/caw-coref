Ambush on U.S. Convoy Leaves 16 Dead

U.S. soldiers at the scene deleted photos taken by a freelance
photographer working for The Associated Press and video taken by a
freelancer working for AP Television News.  Neither the photographer nor
the cameraman witnessed the suicide attack or the subsequent gunfire.
It wasn't immediately known why the soldiers deleted the photos and
videos.  The U.S. military didn't immediately comment on the matter.

The freelance photographer, Rahmat Gul, said he took photos of a
four-wheel drive vehicle with four bodies that had been shot to death
inside.

An American soldier then took Gul's camera and deleted the photos.  Gul
said he later received permission to take photos from another soldier,
but that the first soldier came back and angrily told him to delete the
photos again.  Gul said the soldier raised his fist as if he was going
to strike Gul but that he didn't.

Hardly a big deal - he could have those deleted photo's back in ten minutes,

It seems that the world is getting increasingly full of 'bigots' - in fact,
any filthy goy who murmurs a protest about sending his sons to die for
Jewish interests is immediately labeled a 'bigot' by the ever vigilant
Israel lobby, whose job it is to ensure that the filthy goy vermin continue
to support Israel financially, and with the blood of their children.

What else are the filthy goim for, eh?

That's kinda what I was thinking.  I'm just curious about why they were
'forcibly' deleted in the first place.  What was the point?  Makes me
wonder what they're hiding.

So. If the photographer was dumb enough to hand his camera over to someone
that has not legal authority to demand such a thing he got what he deserved.
Crappy worthless government or not the US has handed the control of Iraq
over to them. They are the only ones that could legally demand such a thing.

Many journalists have said that it's not wise to anger the

I think this is just an angry human reaction. I also think I'd
probably act in just the same way except i wouldn;t be there and
specially wearing a uniform of any sort.

That's odd, I agree with this.  But another oddity is how you seem
to avoid considering the possibility that journalists (both of words
and photos) might fear doing their job when it would violate no
agreement.

I'm well beyond the possibility of having experience in Iraq, but
in Vietnam my boots trod many miles outside the protection of base
camps during '66 and '67.  Perhaps if you knew more and assumed less
your understanding wouldn't be so far off the mark.  Good soldiers
respect honest reporting.  Bad ones go out of their way to prevent
it, aided and abetted by ever more restrictive rules passed from on
high, intended not to safeguard the troops, but to protect the butts
of their politically motivated leaders.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ambush on U.S. Convoy Leaves 16 Dead

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; U.S. soldiers at the scene deleted photos taken by a freelance
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; photographer working for The Associated Press and video taken by a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; freelancer working for AP Television News.  Neither the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; photographer nor the cameraman witnessed the suicide attack or the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; subsequent gunfire. It wasn't immediately known why the soldiers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deleted the photos and videos. The U.S. military didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately comment on the matter. The freelance photographer, Rahmat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gul, said he took photos of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; four-wheel drive vehicle with four bodies that had been shot to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; death inside.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An American soldier then took Gul's camera and deleted the photos.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gul said he later received permission to take photos from another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; soldier, but that the first soldier came back and angrily told him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to delete the photos again.&lt;&lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hardly a big deal - he could have those deleted photo's back in ten
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes, and probably already has.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Unless the soldier knew to take some pictures after it was
&gt;&gt;&gt; deleted/formatted. You think those guys are dumb? &lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt; Is that a trick question?

&gt;&gt; They're out there fighting Israel's dirty war, while fat Jews make
&gt;&gt; fortunes out of the upheaval.

&gt;&gt; So, no, not 'dumb' - just fooled.

I can't speak for the others here, but I'm aware of agreements between
the media and coalition forces.  I already know how my confusion has
occurred - though I don't know why it exists, nor do my two military
friends over there (not in Kabul).

Repeat:
"The freelance photographer, Rahmat Gul, said he took photos of a
four-wheel drive vehicle with four bodies that had been shot to death
inside."

What was it about this photo that warranted it's deletion under their
agreement?  I don't have to have Afghani mud on my boots to ask this
question, but I suspect someone with muddy boots will have to answer it.

Many civilians are dying in Afghanistan and Iraq at the hands of the
American forces. It's justified because the Americans are under
"extreme stress", or because the "enemy" forces take refuge in
civilian areas.

As if the Afghans aren't under stress.

You can't win this war by military might. And you don't win the hearts
of the Afghans or Iraqis by killing innocent civilians, no matter what
the reason.

From the start of these wars, the U.S. has taken all possible steps to
restrict fair reporting of events. The policy has been very
successful: most Americans have a very skewed idea of what is
happening and what those forces are doing. Not so amongst the Afghans
and Iraqis. They hate the Americans because of the indiscriminate
attacks on civilians.

After an initial clear victory over the Taliban, the situation in
Afghanistan is steadily getting worse, and the reasons are clear.

To all Americans: Even if you hate moslems for what they caused on
Sept. 11, try to realize that vengeance is not the best tool for
winning the situation. And try to understand that you are being
deceived by the Bush administration and by "spin" in the press.

Well, then if they agreed to such stupid requirements they got what they
deserved. It is awfully hard to be a non-partisan observer when one side
controls the media and the media is unable to be accurate and subjective.

If the US wanted vengeance on all Muslims then there wouldn't BE any
Muslims anymore.

And the fact that Muslims seem to think that the US actions in the
Middle East are about "vengeance" shows just how pitfully ignorant they
are of the capabilities of the US military and American technology.
"Vengeance" is _their_ thing--they act like a bunch of 19th century
hillbillies having a feud.  A few thousand collateral-damage civilian
casualties and a much larger number in an army that was too stupid to
move off the target even when they were warned a day in advance that it
was going to be bombed is not "vengeance".  Entire nations turned into
wastelands of softly glowing green glass is "vengeance".  Wiping the
entire population of a subcontinent off the face of the Earth is
"vengeance".  Killing every person with the slighest hint of an Arab
genetic marker is "vengeance".  Compared to actually trying to keep the
lid on in Iraq long enough for them to establish a stable government,
_vengeance_ is _easy_.

But considering how much they seem to love "vengeance", maybe if they
got a _real_ taste of it they'd GROW UP.

&gt;&gt; soldiers that are all that stand between them and the insurgents
&gt;&gt; that would love to add another scalp to their belt (or al J. video).

&gt; Journalists who are embedded with US troops agree to many
&gt;  restrictions. If the pictures violated the agreement, or compromised
&gt; military security, then the soldiers had every right (and the duty)
&gt; to delete them, and/or the photographer.
&gt; It seems many here don't have even the most basic understanding of
&gt; war, or the duty of a soldier.
&gt; Perhaps if you walked a few miles in their combat boots, you would
&gt; understand this better.

J. Clarke you may be right. However our ability to wipe out a country or a
race of people (right or wrong) is directly related to those making the
decision in our government. Bush has made this very clear with this war. We
handled the first gulf war brilliantly. However, our current president and
his trained monkeys couldn't design, create and implement a working war
strategy if they had to. With Bush and his monkey's in charge wouldn't
couldn't wipe our ass let alone wipe out a race of or group of people.
Technically we have the ability, mentally we have a man that can't eat a
pretzel without nearly choking to death on it and man that couldn't tell the
truth to save his soul. We also have a man that is so stupid he can't see
the mess that we are in over there. In the case of the current war our
country and our leaders have done the best they can which just plain sucks.

You're not the first to posit this about Iran, and this could apply to
any country that finds itself on the outs with the U.S.  Know thine

long held the position that so long as the U.S. has a nuke farm, others
will demand parity.  Power and influence are money magnets.  Who are we

The U.S. beats N. Korea in the latest poll!

"A majority of people believe that Israel and Iran have a mainly
negative influence in the world, a poll for the BBC World Service
suggests.

It shows that the two countries are closely followed by the United
States and North Korea. "

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6421597.stm

The U.S, formerly the land of opportunity and of freedom, is now the
land of war.

American commentators are fond of calling N.K. the "rogue nation". But
what transgressions did this country commit? They built a bomb after
Bush threatened it in his 2002 State of the Union address. Doesn't
really compare to recent nefarious activities of the U.S. -- although
I'm sure if you are a Patriot and a Christian, you will see it the
other way.

It's so easy to try to hide the face of the monster by placing it
behind a mask of redefinitions.  Torture is no longer torture if it
doesn't cause major organ failure or death.  Genocide and insane
preemptive war becomes palatable when a new definition of vengeance
goes far beyond what even Hitler and the worst of the 3rd Reich ever
contemplated.  Growing up stands no chance for those harboring
thoughts such as yours.  Without realizing it, your last sentence
paints a perfect self portrait of a new, emerging Strangelove.

I'm a bit surprised that it's *YOU* that is doing the chimp
impersonation bit.  You clearly didn't understand what I wrote.  The
"two peas in a pod" were Ron and smb, and whether you'll agree or
not, "pea brain" was intended to be a slightly humorous putdown of
their clearly confused logic and stupidly formed, erroneous
assumptions.  One doesn't have to walk a mile in a soldier's boots
to know that soldiers sometimes behave poorly and illegally.  That
they're under stress does NOT justify their improper behavior.

There was no attempt made to equate Bush and Cheney with having a
"pea brain".  Look all you want and you won't find it, nor will
anyone else that has more than a pea brain. :)  What I was getting
at was that I actually *did* walk those few miles that Ron assumed
that I hadn't.  My reference to Bush and Cheney was to remind Ron
that those two critters that he'd go far out of his way to avoid
criticizing were two critters that found ways that many of their
elite friends also found to avoid the kind of duty that would put
them in harms way, walking miles with the grunts that they are so
removed from and share so little with, despite the feigned "common
man" show that the Yalie puts on when the cameras and lights are
near.

If you found my language as offensive at Hugo's, then I'm sorry,

While I didn't say that he's an idiot or a chimp, thanks for the
reminder.  Pretending isn't necessary, he IS an idiot.  He's not a
complete idiot, but whether he is above or below you on the fool's

&gt; You don't have to agree with what Bush does, but pretending that he is an

Whose truth are you talking about? There is no single, simple "truth" in
a situation as complex as that.

That's the great thing about pictures - they're worth a thousand words.
It would still be "business as usual" at Abu Ghraib if photos hadn't
leaked out; the abuses had been reported previously in writing but
nobody cared until the photos created shock value.

Deleting the photos simply allows everybody to believe whatever they
want, or ignore it completely.  I won't claim pictures can preclude
different interpretations of events, but they are a relatively objective
form of documentation.

Objective but selective, and certainly can be used to mislead. Sometimes
worse than no photo at all.
