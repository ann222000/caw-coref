Apologies for being so SoCal focused re disaster.

New Orleans had torrential rains in the last week.  Saw that some  businesses
that had just reopened were flooded.

James and others.. tell us what happened.

New Orleans, as with most low lying areas in the country, has a history of
minor flooding when there are heavy rains.  The pumps that rid the streets
of rain water can only pump an 1 inch of water the first hour and increments
thereafter.  The trouble is that over 2 inches fell in the first hour so the
pumps backed up.

But, there is more to the story...

After Katrina, an effort was made to clean out the storm drains that appear
on every block on every street in town.  Particular attention was paid to
the areas that flooded since they were more heavily clogged.  These really
cool vacuum cleaner trucks would stop in front of each drain, lift the cast
iron grate with a robotic arm and suck out all that gross gooish matter.
The problem is that they didn't flush the entire system, they only cleaned
the drains so until the entire system is flushed there will continue to be
'out of the ordinary' flooding issues.  I'm sure there are more layers to
the story, but that is why my street has minor flooding and it really never
had flooding issues prior to Katrina.

I have watched the TV news regarding the fires in California and my heart
truly goes out to everyone who lost their home.  But it goes deeper than
their initial loss.  I have to wonder if the lessons learned from Katrina
will be applied.  Rebuilding is long and hard and the insurance companies
don't always cooperate so I wonder if the folks who lost their home to the
fires will be able to re-build.  Will the same areas be allowed to rebuild?
It's a similar conversation as in Louisiana, do you re-build in a known
flood plain?  In California, do you re-build in areas prone to wild fires?
They are difficult questions to ask but at some point the 'going green'
conversation should include overbuilding.

I had a week long event this week at the InterContinental and &quot;lived through&quot; the heavy rains at the first of the week.  From our General Session Ballroom we could watch the water bubbling up through the manhole covers and running down the street maybe 6&quot;-10&quot; deep.  Heard that most schools were closed for just one day (a few for two).  It didn't dampen the spirits of our attendees, though we did have a few who had to iron their clothes dry when they were caught by surprise by the rain.  (I am from Oregon.  I only notice rain when it is ankle deep.)

By the way, if you have any fears about holding an event in New Orleans, loose them.  Everyone we worked with were very appreciative that we were there.  Our conference was for about 200 people, mostly from the US and everyone enjoyed the conference, the hotel and the city.
