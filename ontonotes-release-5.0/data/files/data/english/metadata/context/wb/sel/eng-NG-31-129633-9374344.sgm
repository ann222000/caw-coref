*PIL on Athirappilly project High Court Round-up *

Special Correspondent

Kochi: A public interest litigation was filed before the Kerala High
Court on Monday seeking to quash the environmental clearance given for
the proposed Athirappilly hydroelectric project.

The petition sought to restrain the Kerala State Electricity Board
(KSEB) and the government from going ahead with the project.

The petitioner, Geetha of Chalakudy, said the clearance was given on the
basis of an environmental impact study by Water and Power Consultancy
Services (India) Ltd. The study report was unreliable, as it was based
on an earlier report of the Tropical Botanical Garden and Research
Institute.

The petitioner feared that implementation of the project would efface
the very character of the river. The KSEB proposed to construct the
163-MW project across the Chalakudy river. The environmental clearance
hearing had been a farce. The agency did not conduct any study as
required by the law. The petitioner said that if the project was
implemented, biodiversity of the area would be lost.
