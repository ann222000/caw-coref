Danish Agricultural Press - 100 years anniversary conference
Copenhagen, 6 June 2005
************************

&quot;Ladies and gentlemen,

It's a great pleasure to be with you today to pay tribute to the work
of the Danish agricultural press and to share with you a few thoughts
on some of the farming-related challenges currently facing the EU,
especially with regard to global trade.

I'd like to thank all the organisers and hosts of this event for
inviting me and thus giving me the chance of a day or two with the
sights and sounds of Copenhagen. As always, it's nice to be home!

For me, this conference marks an interesting departure from my normal
experience. In Brussels I have to keep an eye on what the media are
saying about me - or at least about the policies to which I
contribute. Today the tables are turned: it's refreshing for me to
have a chance to talk about the media!

But the journalists here can relax: I have only positive comments to
make.

Agriculture is a stretching subject. Understanding its finer points is
difficult enough. To convey those finer points to the public while
trying to add some colour - this is skilful work, and sometimes a bit
of an uphill struggle. And you are doing an important work in this
respect. Without this work, many of the decisions taken in Brussels,
Geneva or elsewhere over the very food we eat would seem distant and
mysterious to the people for whom those decisions are made. - Or they
would simply not materialise - because of lack of understanding.

The success of agricultural seminars and cocktail parties can often be
measured by the number of journalists present, quietly scribbling notes
or sipping wine, waiting for their chance to spring the awkward
question. On that criterion, of course, with so many journalists
present, today must already be reckoned a stunning success!

================
EU enlargement
================

Agricultural journalists covering the EU have had plenty to report over
the last few years.

Even if we leave EU farm policy aside for a moment, the setting in
which that policy operates has undergone enormous change. 32 years ago,
Denmark was one of the new recruits to the Union. In 2005, it's an
old deck-hand. 16 new arrivals have come on board after Denmark, of
which 10 last year - an enormous achievement.

The enlargement of 2004 had prompted prophecies of doom, but it has
gone more or less according to plan. The migratory floods and the land
price explosions predicted by some have simply not happened. And if we
look specifically at agriculture, farmers in the new member states have
seen their incomes climb by more than 50% since May 2004, while trade
has thrived and banks are presenting a much friendlier face to rural
entrepreneurs.

Managing enlargement at the same time as our ground-breaking reforms of
2003 and 2004 has meant juggling a lot of balls at one time. But
we've kept them all in the air. There has been profound change in the
EU; but it's been controlled change. And it has been quite well
communicated.

==================================
The draft constitutional treaty
==================================

You may be surprised that I mention &quot;enlargement&quot; and &quot;controlled
change&quot; in the same breath, with an air of optimism, just days after
France and the Netherlands rejected the EU's draft constitutional
treaty. But this enlargement has already produced a lot of benefits.
The question was: could these benefits be enhanced? The Constitutional
treaty was mainly intended to consolidate and make the legislative
process in an EU of 25 member states more effective. Europe needs this
to face the many challenges coming from globalisation.

I fully respect the decision of the French and the Dutch voters. But I
also regret it. And we need to try and understand why they did vote no.

But we should not forget that analysis have shown that in spite of
their No-vote the French and Dutch voters do express strong support for
&quot;Europe&quot; as a concept. For its basic values

One thing that struck me in the two votes was the wide expression of
anxieties: Towards global trade, loss of jobs, insecurity and general
dissatisfaction with the political system.

The European construction can deliver on some of these issues - but
obviously not on all. In any case we must respond to these anxieties.
And this will require leadership and strong political guidance. We must
stay cool. We must allow some time for reflection. And the European
Council will provide guidance I am sure.

We cannot allow uncertainty.

The immediate victim could be the financial perspectives, which would
deal a blow to many policies. I personally believe that a deal should
be struck at a reasonable level.

It is important that - while we start a reflection on the
consequences of the No-votes - we also go about our normal business.
And this is indeed what is happening.

I was very encouraged that, at last week's meeting of the Agriculture
Council, we agreed a new Regulation for the financing of the CAP.
It's a regulation that will ensure simplification, more
accountability and better management of our agricultural funds. This
shows that the EU is still functioning. And it has to do so, because
some big tasks are coming over the horizon at us in the next few months
- with or without a Constitutional treaty.

=================================================
The Doha Development Agenda - current progress
=================================================

One of the largest of these will be getting a successful outcome to the
Doha Development Agenda.

The failure of WTO members in September 2003 to agree on
&quot;modalities&quot; for agriculture at the ministerial meeting in Canc√∫n
seemed a disaster.

What a different picture today. We have a basic understanding of the
likely structure of a modalities deal. We have something close to a
method for comparing import duties. We have ideas on the table with
regard to all three of the main &quot;pillars&quot; of the agriculture talks:
domestic support, market access and export competition. And we have a
real prospect of finalising modalities at our ministerial meeting
planned for Hong Kong in December.

We in the EU have shouldered more than our share of the burden to make
things happen.

By more or less breaking the link between production and the aid to our
farmers, our CAP reform of 2003 has left us able to accept a huge
reduction in trade-distorting aid.

We've also led the way with clear proposals for reining in export
subsidies and for phasing in change in all three &quot;pillars&quot;.

Unlike how we have seen the EU in previous trade rounds, the EU has
been a locomotive in these talks, not a baggage car, and will remain
so.

=========================================
The Doha Development Agenda - concerns
=========================================

However, let me voice a few worries. Agricultural talks in this WTO
round have rightly focused on the three main pillars. It goes without
saying that any results here will have to be in balance with what we
get from other negotiations - on industrial goods, services,
investment and government procurement.

Our trade partners need to understand that the Doha round is not merely
about agriculture. The EU also has legitimate concerns and wishes in
other sectors. Wishes that will also need satisfaction as a part of an
overall agreement.

But even within the agricultural sector alone, I'm concerned that
some vital topics are being pushed to the bottom of the agenda.

I'm thinking mainly of &quot;geographical indications&quot; - food and
drink product names which refer to a specific place and conjure up the
tastes and smells of specialised production.

Some of our trading partners are deeply suspicious of our affection for
geographical indications, or &quot;GIs&quot;, as we call them. &quot;What's in
a name?&quot; they ask us, telling us that something called &quot;Parma
ham&quot; need not come from Parma. According to some forms of this
philosophy, Britain's Newcastle Brown ale could carry the name
whether it was brewed in Newcastle, New York or Novosibirsk -
depending on who (if anyone) held a relevant trademark. GIs are
protectionism by another name, we are told.

Millions of consumers around the world might not agree, I suggest.
There are plenty of people out there eager to buy &quot;the real thing&quot;,
made in the place stated on the label, according to the traditions
observed in that place. These people want Kalamata olives to come from
Kalamata, because then they know that they're buying centuries of
know-how.

I think this is perfectly reasonable. Moreover, it's in keeping with
the EU's new farm policy grounded firmly in quality production. We
have marked a clean break with a support system that sometimes
encouraged farmers to chase subsidies rather than healthy prices from
satisfied customers. Now, the farmer who raises beef cattle in the
Limousin or who grows barley in East Anglia does so because he can
bring to market a product that people want to buy. Perhaps he'll even
get a premium if the beef comes from an admired breed or the barley
fields are cultivated in such a way as to support local wildlife -
provided that the customers know this. The consumer wants a product
that carries with it a story.

Seen in this light, properly protected GIs are not a new protectionism
but a lubricant for trade in high-value goods. Our trade partners want
a well-functioning global marketplace. So do we. But we'll never get
it if our only concern is the freedom to buy and sell: it's also
vital that consumers be able to make informed choices. No one would
deny this principle in the case of industrial goods; it also holds true
in food markets. Properly protected GIs make the marketplace more
sophisticated - they do not impoverish it - and they must not be
sidelined in the current negotiations.

Closely related to the thorny issue of food quality is that of food
safety. This topic has not really surfaced much in the Doha Round, but
it will remain a strong guiding light for policy makers in the future.

And it's right that it should do so. Here again, there is a permanent
fear in some quarters that talk of protecting the food supply against
contamination often masks the aim of protecting producers against
unwanted competition. We always need to be alert to this temptation.
But the opposite error - to make safety standards too lax - is at
least as destructive. We in the EU can say this with conviction after
hard-fought battles against BSE and foot-and-mouth disease - which
turned markets upside-down, robbed farmers of their livelihoods and
filled the media with images of piles of burning animal carcases.

The EU will continue to operate a robust food safety system which
responds to its citizens' concerns on the basis of science without
blocking the channels of trade for products which do not pose a threat.
This is our approach for all aspects of food safety, from the hidden
presence of animal diseases to the complexities of genetically modified
organisms.

There will be moments of disagreement with our trade partners on these
matters, but we will always make every effort to resolve these calmly
and rationally. Our current work with the US on veterinary policy is a
case in point.

================
The home front
================

It's obvious that agricultural journalists looking for the action
this year will much of the time have their microphones trained on
Geneva, then hopefully on Hong Kong in December. But in the mean time,
we in the EU certainly won't be neglecting our own back yard.

Our CAP reforms of 2003 and 2004, to which I've already alluded, have
fired the starting pistol for a lot of work. I'm impressed so far
with the efforts I've seen from member states -not least from
Denmark - to make the new policies work on the ground.

Other reforms now have to follow, for a blend of external and domestic
reasons. In this sense, the big wave approaching rather quickly is
sugar - which, of course, holds considerable interest for our trading
partners.

The EU's sugar common market organisation is a sturdy plant that has
weathered many storms over its 35-year life. But now it will have to
bend with the wind. The European Commission is well into updating its
reform plans and will present these later this month.

Let me suggest what this reform will and won't be about - subject
to the views of my fellow commissioners, the European Parliament and
member state agriculture ministers.

It will be about bringing the sugar regime into line with our general
agricultural policy and with recent WTO panel judgments, as well as
leaving the sector leaner and fitter to face the competition. To this
end, we'll be proposing changes which go further than those put
forward in July last year. But our proposal will also provide the long
time perspective and stability that the sugar sector is calling for.
And it will propose an entirely different set of tools in order to
create the necessary adjustments of the sector. We intend to offer the
carrot more than we wield the stick.

What the reform will not be about is taking the EU sugar industry into
a crash-landing on the volatile world market, wiping out our domestic
production at a stroke. The spirit of reform must go hand in hand with
a respect for reality. Many countries in the EU-25 currently produce
sugar, and thousands of jobs depend on these industries. I acknowledge
that lower levels of protection and support will probably force some
factories to close, with compensation. But we will keep some capacity
in the Union as a whole where it makes sense.

Another wave coming our way is rural development. Here again, we're
hard at work on a new Regulation to cover the period 2007-2013. The
energy which ministers have put into this bears witness to the fact
that rural development, still called the &quot;second pillar&quot; of the
CAP, is not so much the baby sister as it used to be.

Getting the right rural policy is pivotal to my vision of what farming
and the countryside in general will be like in the EU in the future.
And I believe that we are moving towards a blueprint which, if the
money is there, will help bring the fruits of technology to our green
spaces, give young people a reason not to leave home for the cities,
and provide economic glue to keep rural villages together.

=============
Conclusion
=============

Ladies and gentlemen, I hope I've given you some idea of the coming
challenges that face us from my point of view.

As I've been speaking here on my home ground about the future, I've
been aware that, according to a rather central figure in religious
history, &quot;no prophet is accepted in his own country&quot;. And it's
clear that, for the next few weeks, we in Brussels will be living in an
atmosphere charged with uncertainty.

But let me make one clear prophecy: The solid work which we're doing
in terms of agriculture will have to go on, domestically and
internationally - in terms of sugar, rural development, the Doha
Round, and all the other tasks ahead.

I can make this general prediction with some confidence. Any more
detailed speculation on what the future holds is something I leave to
others of us here - possibly other speakers, but above all, the
media!

Thank you for listening.&quot;
