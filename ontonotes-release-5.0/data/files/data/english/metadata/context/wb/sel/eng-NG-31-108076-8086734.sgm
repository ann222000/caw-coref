Okay, this time I won't use the word &quot;ownage&quot; since it seems to
personally offend Mark Goldberg ;)

Let's take a look at two videos again:

1. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFI_eObGoc
(overhead view of push hands)

2. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_gmMqzf2I8
(ma yue liang classic clip)

Now, on the surface, you can see that many of the physical postures
used by ma are very similar to what is being shown in the first video;
however, again as in the &quot;ownage&quot; thread it is possible to see that
one of the videos shows a much more &quot;visible&quot; movement paradigm than
the other. Please keep in mind that yes, movement is occurring, but,
can you see it?

I am interested to know if anyone can pick out any similarities or
differences in the skill level related to the amount of movement tori
needs to execute a technique. Of course, any general comments (even
pure drivel/derision) is welcome ;)

As I'm a fan of Ma Yue-Liang I'll also provide this clip. I like this
video (I have the entire program by Bill Moyers).

&gt; Let's take a look at two videos again:
">

Now, imagine if you had simply done this, to begin with.
Now, imagine if you had simply asked the questions, and engaged in
'discussion'
Now, imagine that instead of bullshitting about relativity, about force
vectors and misusing the terms as those who have much greater
understanding and facility with and of those terms, clearly showed you-
you have simply said, 'ok' I'll rethink my use and thinking in that
regard, and simply displayed the videos and asked what others think
about the 'videos' how much different the responses might have been.

Think about how a different man, not you, might well have done that, and
without the histrionics and simply engaged discussion as far as anyone
wished to take it. It could have been done that way.

But again, you didn't allow for this kind of discussion. Instead you
devolved into claiming no one could understand the depths, such as you,
and yet, you yourself have no mastery.

Look- I have an interest that people don't become idiots about the
internal arts here, since they're rather fragile enough without self
proclaimed 'experts' crowing and posturing. You mentioned my name, here-
so I've rendered my thoughts. I'm serious.

Look at the difference in your approach - sans mentioning ownage, as if
you are merely humoring the crowd instead of admitting that you made a
grand mistake to begin with, in starting a thread with the notion of
such and pushing hands and how that relates to 'fighting' which is the
core problem, by implication.

Now.... let's see if you can do it, without hyperbole, without having to
backtrack and see if you can represent taiji, without making me feel
embarrassed for you, and those arts.

I  shall comment ... so don't mention my name, here, in this thread,
anymore.

No, it was you who claimed I didn't understand. It would be nothing
for me to provide links to several different posts where I said
different people such as weigel and evins (did specifically), rtw and
supremeultimate (likely would) understand this. I did claim that
several certain people, you included, could not understand. I stand by
that, as you yourself claim you didn't even get to push hands very
much even when you studied taijiquan.

Sure, okay, I won't, as long as you don't make claims which are so
easily proven false. The bit about me claiming no one could understand
(but me) above, for example. Would you like me to provide cites to the
several posts where I said other people understood? Seriously, just
ask.

I'm all for burying the hatchet, Mark.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Whatever complaints I have, it is not about doing more than trying to
prevent those arts you say, you represent from being besmirched.
Notice, how instead of moving on... as I asked, 'could you do it here'
in this thread, you simply could not.

You are stuck in a loop, that replays in your mind. You couldn't but
drag out all your utter failures which were so unapplealing from the
'ownage' thread.

Now... if this were pushing hands- as Yang Cheng Fu noted to his
students-'Don't put your dead meat on me'

That's what you're doing Oliver... again, and you're going to go right
into the dead toots from the ownage thread by claiming you are innocent,
not guilty of any indiscretions, etc.... and that, as they say, as
others will no doubt show you, in detail, since that's what you're
showing here- not pushing hands- but Olivers expertise, that should not
be questioned. Now... I'm out of this thread- but I'll say it, since
there's little else for me to add- examine your motives.

Few do. It's a fact, Mark. It's not something I am bragging about. If
something is only understandable after a hard practice, then someone
who hasn't done the work can't understand, not even intellectually.

Look, yes, I just want to discuss push hands. But not with someone who

You are using them and informing others that they can't really deny you
since they don't really have the skills to understand the 'concepts' yet
when you made an ass out of yourself with relativity, you had not even

you stole from years of Sigman's threads, and were told so, you had not
the sense to admit that, and on and on you went, unto this: other's
don't really understand how any of this works and you will explain it.

Ergo.... ownage, and mindbending, blah blah blah.
You are of no interest to me. What you've accomplished is to make taichi
look every bit the laughing stock it is, and you have done a fine job
making people think that only nuts, want to be nuts, and nuts's in
training delve into it. Congratulations.

You couldn't shut your egotistical mouth for a reply even... the whole
newsgroup  is laughing at you, scorning you and you haven't the brains

your flaming bullshit and lack of sense and sensibiltity.

What I am doing is quite simple. I posted a couple videos and called
for a discussion. I am particularly interested at how the techniques
are refined over time so as to reduce the visible movement. I am
interested in how little &quot;gross&quot; physical movement is neccessary to
perform a technique. I think a good analogy would be the study of
kuzushi in Judo:

&quot;Another way to apply kuzushi is to setup or force your opponent into
a weak position. There are many ways of moving that will result in
your opponent responding in a predictable way so that you can
anticipate it and take advantage of it. It can be as simple as
stepping forward and pushing on your opponent, which usually results
in the opponent stepping back, bracing, and pushing back. This in turn
gives you the opportunity to throw them forward in the direction of
their push.&quot; - http://www.judoinfo.com/kuzushi.htm
