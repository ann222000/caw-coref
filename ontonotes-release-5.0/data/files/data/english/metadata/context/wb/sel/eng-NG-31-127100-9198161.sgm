I noticed a couple of posts from our lady members of ASMA speaking to
the issue of the older woman and the younger man. Of course I along
with several others have indeed reach the age where most, if not all,
the women are younger. This then brings up another issue: What about
us old guys and the younger woman? You got that right! what about us
in that equation?

Well fear not, I believe the following bit of wit may answer that
thoughtful question.

The Old Man

One day a young couple was strolling along the shady lane when they
came upon an old man sitting on a bench and was sobbing. They asked
the old man if they could help.

Sobbing, he responded, &quot;No.&quot;

They asked, &quot;Do you need medical help.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

They then inquired, &quot;We're not being nosy, but we just want to help.&quot;

You can't, no one can!&quot;

&quot;But why? We can call someone if you need help.&quot;

With tears rolling down hi cheeks, he looked and began to explain,
&quot;You see, I met this young, voluptuous, long legged beauty. Her figure
is gorgeous, her lips are full and wanting, her breasts are so
desiring, her eyes are calling. And she laying unclothed in my bed at
home while I am returning from the store with bottles of champaign to
start a long night of merriment and passion. She said, &quot;Please,
please, please, hurrying back home with the champaign, I am waiting.&quot;

THe young couple, somewhat surprised at the old man's tearful
revelations. &quot;Well then what is the problem&quot; Why are sitting here
tears? what are you hurrying back home.&quot;

The old man starting crying more and sobbed out the words, &quot;. . .
because I can't remember where I live.&quot;

Oh, Donn, you always come through with something appropriate to say,
don't you?

That's why we old younger women &lt;ahem&gt; women love you.  :-)

Donn, I was going to stay out of this but now that I know I wasn't the
only 'older guy' to pay attention to these posts I'll go ahead and throw
in my two cents.

Why would these mature ladies want to return to the days of Wham Bam,
Thank Ya Maam when they can have Sloooow Good?

I guess they don't realize that in their days of youth all the time they
were screaming 'Slow Down, Wait, Wait, not yet'! he was thinkng to
himself, 'You started same time I did, try to keep up'!

Anyway, soft light will get some of these wrinkles out and there are
other wrinkles you're in charge of gettin' out.

OK, with all this talk about how slow and such, it's time for me to jump in
here and let you guys know just how young you are.

I'm so old the only sex organ I have that works is my tongue :)

Ladies: the line starts at Interstate 30 :-))

Well, honey, since I'm married to an older man, I have lots of nice,
Slooooow Good.  :-)  I ain't complaining about that at all.

But sometimes I'd like to have another wham bam thankyou ma'am once in
a while, if only for old times' sake.  Those are fewer and far between
at our age.

You see, the first norther of the year always makes me frisky, or as
my husband describes me, it makes me want to start climbing legs.  He
says he'd take me out to the places of our youth and get me in the
same positions we used to get in, but, ... they'd have to call the
jaws of life to get us out and that would embarrass the hell out of
our children.

I ain't unappreciative of what I've got, but I've got my
memories.  ;-)
