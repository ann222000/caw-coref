Ratzinger is Jewish and a Nazi.

The Pope was Jewish says historian

by Riazat Butt – Metronews 12 February 2006

Yaakov Wise says his study into the the maternal ancestry of Karol Josez Wojtyla (John
Paul II's real name) has revealed startling conclusions.

Mr Wise, a researcher in orthodox Jewish history and philosophy, said the late Pope's
mother, grandmother and great-grandmother were all probably Jewish and came from a small
town not far from Krakow.

The Pope was a priest and cardinal archbishop in the Polish city before his election to
the papacy.

Mr Wise said: &quot;According to orthodox Judaism, a person's Jewish identity is passed down
through the maternal line. I saw a photograph of the Pope's mother and I showed it to
people who didn't know who she was.

&quot;They all said she looked Jewish. So I started doing more investigations about her
background.&quot;

Although he believes the Pope's father was an ethnic Pole, he thinks that John Paul's
mother Emilia Kaczorowski - Emily Katz in English - was Jewish and that she was the
daughter of Feliks Kaczowski, a businessman from Biala-Bielsko in Poland. Katz is a
common surname amongst East European Jewish families.

Emilia's mother, the Pope's grandmother, was Maria Anna Scholz. Scholz, or Schulze, is
also a common surname among Jews, as is Rybicka, or Ryback, which is the surname of the
Pope's great-grandmother Zuzanna.

All the names or their variations appear on gravestones in the old Biala Jewish
cemetery, as does the surname of Felik's mother Urszula Maklinowska. Mr Wise said: &quot;The
Pope's ancestry has been researched by an American historian.

&quot;But nobody has traced the family name through the Jewish community and, as Jewish
historian, I have access to information that a non-Jewish historian wouldn't know about.

&quot;I'm not making any firm conclusions, but what I'm saying is that there is a lot of
circumstantial evidence to say that he was Jewish.

&quot;The Pope's mother married out of the Jewish community to wed a Catholic. Her children
were born and raised as Catholics and the Pope was baptised. It would shed light on why
the Pope had to go into hiding from the Nazis in November 1940.

&quot;If he had been a pure ethnic Pole this would not have been necessary.

&quot;It would also explain why this Pope in particular felt a strong desire to improve
relations between the Church of Rome and the Jewish people.&quot;

Pope John Paul II Had a Jewish Mother?

Subject: Re: Vatican leaders condemn anti-Zionism

Dxxxx,

Thank you.

The article which you sent me is a &quot;whitewash&quot; which fails to cover up the &quot;dead men's
bones&quot; truth about Zionism, and Judaism. Neither can the stench of JPII and his demonic
Vatican be covered by any similar mixture of whitewashed lies.

JPII is a Jew through maternal lineage......his mother, who was a Jewess, died when he
was a young lad, and in judging from his matured &quot;fruits&quot;, I'm assuming that her
surviving relatives saw to it that he was introduced into the Jewish secret society at a
very early age. It has been reported that young Karl even played as a member of the
Jewish soccer team against his Catholic neighbors. More damning, are his recent public
heretical statements which reinforce the false notion that Jews somehow have no need to
accept Jesus as their Savior.
The Vatican with it's now vacant &quot;Chair of Peter&quot;, as prophesized, has become the &quot;Seat
of the Antichrist&quot;. Anyone who knows the truth and then fails to speak out in
condemnation of anti Christ Judaism, Zionism, and the Vatican which is now under anti
Christ Jewish control, commits a grave sin against Jesus our Lord and Savior.

REPLY FROM CONSERVATIVE CATHOLIC ABOUT VATICAN &amp; POPE

In a message dated 7/10/2004

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Dear Rxxxxxxxxx --- Hear me out and pass this out, it's true about the Vatican, but not
about the Pope. And this is no whitewash of John Paul II.

John Paul II is not the Pope, but an anti-Pope, the fourth in a row to sit in the Chair
of Peter since 1958.

On October 26, 1958, it appears that Cardinal Joseph Siri was elected Pope, and after
threats and maneuvering, Siri was shunted aside, and an agent of worldwide Freemasonry
and Zionism was put in his place. This was Angelo Roncalli, who took the name John
XXIII.

Something like this was repeated in 1963, and that story is in Malachi Martin's book,
'Keys of this Blood' somewhere between pages 590 and 610. (Malachi Martin was triple
agent, who is the unidentified priest in the 1966 article in Look Magazine, 'How the
Jews Changed Catholic Thinking.' (which you can find on the internet via google)

I don't expect non-Catholics to accept the visions of Catholic saints and 'Blesseds',
but many of these church approved saintly people had visions of a counterfeit church
taking over the structures of the Vatican and the Catholic Church worldwide. From 1958
on the 'counterfeit church', as Blessed Anna Katrina Emmerick saw in her visions circa
1820, began to subvert the Church. Changing all the sacraments, all the catechisms, the
Mass, and, as fast as possible, replacing the old Bishops with the new counterfeit
Bishops like the probable Marrano Jew, 'Archbishop' Joseph Bernardin, who ended his
career right before he died looking like an aids patient, by going to Israel and stating
that 'anti-Semitism' was started by St. John the Apostle in the Gospel of St. John. This
was the first volley in what legions of Jews would say 10 years later against the movie,
The Passion of the Christ.

Paul VI was 'elected' in 1963 (Montini) and Montini was a marrano Jew, as announced with
proof that the Montinis were an old Jewish family going back centuries. Under Paul VI,
the Top Jews and Freemasons took over the entire structure of the Catholic Church, so
that today you see the digusting 'bishops' selling out God and country. everyone of
which has been approved by the worldwide Jewish network before they are appointed by the
actor Karol Woytila, John Paul II.

John Paul II was 'elected' in 1978 after the sudden death and probably murder of a patsy
Italian, Luciani, who took the name John Paul I.

Woytila, John Paul II, who they are trying to keep alive as long as possible, is accused
of being part Jewish through his mother. It is true that in Poland he played on the
Jewish soccer team as a youth. His biographers, Tad Szulc, Carl Bernstein (who bragged
that his Dad was communist who fought Sen. McCarthy on Larry King Live years ago), and
others seem to be all Jews, and are GLOWING with HEAPING praise about John Paul II.
Woytila was 'elected' Pope out of COMMUNIST POLAND. My friend gave me an article years
ago which came out right after the second 1978 Conclave, which is entitled, 'Communist
Government Praises Choice of Pope.'

Growing up in Catholic schools, we read about Cardinal Mindzenty, who was taken prisoner
by the Jew Communists when they took over Poland after World War II. Mindzenty was under
house arrest, and NEVER allowed to travel. By SHARP contrast, Woytila (John Paul II) was
ALWAYS ALLOWED TO TRAVEL in and out of Communist Poland, and visited fellow
revolutionary (and marrano Jew?) Joseph Bernardin in Cincinnati TWICE before being
elected Pope. Another biographer of John Paul II, the abominable fork-faced and forked
tongue George Weigel, is a close confidant of ultimate Trotskyite Jew Bill Kristol of
the Weekly Standard, now using the 'Conservative Republican' mask.

In 1904, Pope Pius X received Theodore Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. You can
find into on this meetings from many websites by going to google and searching for 'Pope
Pius X Herzl Zionism' and here is an excerpt from of the web pages:

&quot;On January 25, 1904, Herzl was received in audience by Pope Pius X. Nine years before,
as he penned The Jew State, Herzl had shown his sympathetic awareness of Roman Catholic
concerns, and formulated Zionist policy regarding them: &quot;The sanctuaries of Christendom
would be safeguarded by assigning to them extra-territorial status such as is well known
in the law of nations. We should form a Guard of Honour about these sanctuaries,
answering to the fulfilment of this duty with our existence.&quot;
Despite this sensitivity to Christian sensibilities, and the subsequent inclusion into
central Zionist thinking of this sense of responsibility towards Christendom's shrines,
Herzl failed to secure a papal blessing on his great venture.
&quot;The Jews have not recognised our Lord, therefore we cannot recognise the Jewish
people,&quot; Pope Pius X told him bluntly.
The papal rebuff did not take Herzl completely by surprise. Three days early Pius'
secretary of state had warned him that &quot;as long as the Jews deny the divinity of Christ
we certainly cannot side with them &quot;How then can we agree to their regaining possession
of the Holy Land?&quot;
The Secretary of State of the Vatican then was the great Spaniard Merry del Val, who
also said as quoted by the Russian Count Cherep-Spirodovich in the book, The Hidden Hand
(paraphrase), &quot;Everytime we find something immoral and destructive to society, we find a
Jew behind it.&quot;
Fast forward to 1991, when Jew-agent, and perhaps half Jew himself, Woytila, stated in a
bold faced lie in Parade Magazine that to recognize the Jews right to reclaim Israel has
been the consistent.policy of the Catholic Church. This was published in an article in
Criminal Politics published by LT Patterson circa 1991, as I recall. John Paul II
recognized Israel 'exactly what Pope Pius X said could not be done or supported while
they rejected the Savior.
Now you can understand John Paul II's 'reverent' visits to Auschwitz to testify to the
hoax buildings there.
The Vatican now, when seeming to take the Arab side in things, -- is doing what the
Communists did in Russia for 41 years, and still Putin does it today: pretend to be the
Arabs friends, gather info, give them outdated weapons, and make sure the Jew program
marches on as successfully as possible.
I don't expect non-Catholics to take the view of the current state of the Catholic
Church today, as we few alert Catholics do. Non-Catholics may say: 'See, the great whore
of Babylon is falling, as it deserves.' However
Every change made by the four Vatican II anti-Popes (John XXIII 1958-63, Paul VI
1963-78, John Paul I 1978-78, John Paul II, 1978-??) with their false council of Vatican
II (1962-65) has been in direction of Protestantism (see
http://www.realnews247.com/altar_comparison_pictorial.htm for a dramatic demonstration
of the deformation of Catholic architecture since Vatican Council II).
Dozens and dozens of more pages could be written 'but this gives the idea. If the
Catholic Church is the true Church, then it is going through the Passion of Christ,
crucifixion, seeming burial (now), and resurrection. If it is the true Church, then it
will miraculously rise again, and the true Pope will be restored to the throne of St.
Peter, and the counterfeit Church will be cast out, and, according to several saints,
all will know that the 'finger of God' is here.
Right now, from our point of view, the 'Church is in eclipse' -- it's light being
blocked out by the counterfeit church of Judeo-Masonry.
Jxxxxxx.

P.S. 'do not pay attention to the many Catholics who are still trying to say that John
Paul II doesn't know what's going on, and that these are just 'bad bishops' 'a 25 year
record of destruction is clear. The pedophile scandal 'how satanic 'bishops' like
Bernardin recruited homos for the 'priesthood' in 'catholic' seminaries since 1970 or
so, and kept out the normal men' is detailed in the book 'Good Bye, Good Men' by Michael
Rose 'although Rose fails to draw the obvious conclusions from the impressive evidence
he has amassed.
Recently, John Paul II promoted a pedophile protecting Bishop 'Bernard Law' to a
position at St. Mary Major in Rome. But the Catholics-in-denial will not face the music,
no matter how much evidence amasses. The reason why the Vatican II Popes have to be
anti-Popes is that they have all supported Paul VI's heretical document on Religious
Liberty, signed at Vatican II. a true Pope cannot sign a Council document with heresy in
it. When he does, he announced he is not the Pope.
Judeo-Masonry controls the Vatican since 1958, and this is the beginning of
understanding the moral decline in the world since that time.
Jxxxxxx.

A new Jewish pope?

&quot;And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a
lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast
before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first
beast, whose deadly wound was healed.&quot; Rev 13:11-12 KJV (this could refer to Israel as
some Bible scholars believe.)

For a number of years I felt that not only would the next pope be the end time pope, but
in fact he would be Jewish. Needless to say it did not go over well with my Bible study
group as it was a radical thought, but now in the world there is a change in the wind. I
was watching a program that showed all the candidates for pope. One of the main
contenders is Jewish! His name is Cardinal Lustiger.

The pope has to be Jewish because the false prophet will point the Jews to a Gentile
world leader. So if the pope is not Jewish, why would they even bother to listen to him,
but if he is to be Jewish, he could sway Israel over to the &quot;gentile&quot; dictator with very
little difficulty. Add to this that he will perform great miracles to lead the Jews to
the antichrist, well it will be very easy to bring the Jews in line.

A Jewish pope would certainly bring peace to the middle east and bring Israel under firm
Vatican control. Right now the Vatican is playing a very major role in the peace
process. Having a Jewish pope in office would certainly bring unity and peace to the
middle east. Time will tell. But if we get a newly elected Jewish pope in before
September, are time on earth in my opinion will be very short.

Now too notice what it says in the book of Revelation.

&quot;Then I was given a reed like a measuring rod. And the angel stood, saying, &quot;Rise and
measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship there.&quot; But leave out the
court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the
Gentiles. And they will tread the holy city underfoot for forty-two months.&quot; Rev 11:1-2

the Temple can be rebuilt &quot;around&quot; the Dome mount! This are will be controlled by the
Gentiles and this is why it says, &quot;But leave out the court which is outside the temple,
and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles.&quot; What a symbol to the
world of a new perfect religious unity under man.

Here is some following information I have found on this possible new Jewish pope.

POPE IS SUFFERING FROM 'PROGRESSIVE PARALYSIS'

The Pope is suffering from a progressive paralysis making him a prisoner in his own
body, the Cardinal-Archbishop of Paris said yesterday. In the most frank comments on the
Pope's health yet by a senior churchman, Archbishop Jean-Marie Lustiger said that,
despite his physical ailments, the Pontiff remained mentally sharp. &quot;One knows that his
illness is leading to a progressive paralysis of the body, but his spiritual faculties
remain intact,&quot; Lustiger told French weekly newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche. John Paul
II, who will be 80 next month, is believed to suffer from various illnesses including
Parkinson's disease, although the Vatican has never officially confirmed this.

Jewish-born priest is 'pope's man in Paris'
Some see Cardinal Lustiger as successor
August 26, 1997
Web posted at: 2:33 p.m. EDT (1833 GMT)

PARIS (CNN) -- The Archbishop of Paris, who often stood at John Paul II's side during
the Pope's recent visit, has been mentioned as a possible successor. But even that could
not be quite as remarkable as Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger's life so far. Born into a
Jewish family, he converted to Catholicism at age 14 before joining the priesthood. His
mother was one of thousands of French Jews deported to German concentration camps during
World War II. She died at the camp in Auschwitz, Poland.

Forceful and intelligent, Lustiger rose through the church hierarchy, thanks in no small
part to his close relationship with Pope John Paul II. But, along the way, Lustiger
upset some people in both the Catholic and Jewish establishments.

Jean-Louis Missika, co-author of &quot;Choosing God,&quot; a book about Lustiger, calls the
cardinal &quot;John Paul's man in Paris.&quot; Some in church 'cannot accept him' But, he adds,
some of Lustiger's adversaries within the Catholic church in France are united in their
opposition to the Jewish-born archbishop.

&quot;The right wing of the church cannot accept him because of his life and his origins,&quot;
says Missika, &quot;and the left wing of the church cannot accept him because of his ideas.&quot;
Lustiger's ideas -- on issues like, abortion, birth control, divorce, homosexuality and
other moral matters -- strictly coincide with the conservative views of the Pope.

&quot;There are opinions and there is faith,&quot; the cardinal told CNN. &quot;When it is faith, I
agree (with the pope) because I am responsible for the faith.&quot; Supporters and opponents
alike agree that the success of the World Youth Days festival in France, much of which
the cardinal personally planned, only strengthened Lustiger's position in the church
hierarchy.

At age 70, however, the cardinal's age works against him as a possible successor to John
Paul II, detractors say. Many believe the next pope will be elected from Africa or Asia
where Catholicism is growing the fastest.

Lustiger, himself, looks ill at ease when asked directly about the possibility the
church would turn to him to be its next leader. &quot;No,&quot; he says, pointing upward in a
gesture indicating God and heaven. &quot;I told my Boss I will die before the pope.&quot; Perhaps,
but the French cardinal who has never forgotten his Jewish roots, seems as strong today
as he has ever been.

Pope Pius XII Study Group: A Wasted Opportunity

by Ronald J. Rychlak

The self-destruction of the Catholic-Jewish Pope Pius XII study group came as little
surprise to those who had been following its progress closely. From the very beginning,
several members of that group rejected their mandate and instead sought to force a
change in Vatican archival policy. When the Vatican stood its ground and demanded that
the team finish its agreed assignment, the scholars suspended their work. The charges
and accusations that followed have damaged the work of Pope John Paul II to bring
Catholics and Jews closer together. The shame is that this all could have been avoided.

The situation began in 1999, when Cardinal Edward Cassidy - then President of the Holy
See’s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews - and Mr. Seymour D. Reich,
Chairman of International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultations announced
the appointment of a team of six scholars charged with examining the 11 volumes of
archival material published by the Holy See’s Secretariat of State (Actes et Documents
du Saint Siège relatifs à la seconde guerre, or &quot;ADSS.&quot;)

The ADSS contains the diplomatic correspondence of the Holy See’s Secretariat of State,
as well as notes and memoranda from meetings with diplomats and Church leaders from
various countries during the period of the Second World War. These documents were culled
from Vatican archives by a team of four Jesuit scholars between 1965 and 1981. The
documents are published in the languages in which they were originally written
(primarily Italian, French and German, but also some in Latin and English), but the
editorial commentary is in French. Volume three is split into two books, which accounts
for occasional reference to 12 volumes.

The archives from which the ADSS collection was taken remain sealed. Many researchers,
this author included, would like to have access to the archives, but like most world
governments, the Holy See keeps records confidential for an extended period of time to
make certain that secret governmental information will not be revealed and that living
people will not be embarrassed by disclosure of private information. Only recently were
most (not all) of the American OSS World War II files made public, and similar French
and British files also remain secret. (One member of the Pius XII study group, Fr.
Gerald P. Fogarty from the University of Virginia, tried to do research in the recently
declassified OSS archives, but every relevant document was still under seal.)

The difference between the Catholic-Jewish study group and most other researchers is
that most researchers accept governmental restrictions and work with the best available
evidence to reach an accurate historical understanding. In the case of Pope Pius XII,
the ADSS gave researchers a rare opportunity to see archives that would not normally be
available. Unfortunately, although they agreed to study those documents when they
accepted their positions, many members of the study group failed to carry out this task.

A report on the contents of the 11 volumes could have been a tremendous service for
those in search of the truth. A careful study of those documents makes clear that Pope
Pius XII was very concerned with the welfare of all people, including Jews. In fact,
these volumes contain enough information to refute all the recent slanderous charges
against the wartime Pope. Unfortunately, from the very beginning, the study group was
more interested in getting into secret archives than in learning what took place during
the war.

At the time of the group’s formation, Leon Feldman, Emeritus Professor of History at
Rutgers University and &quot;Jewish coordinator&quot; for the study group said he thought there
was a &quot;smoking gun&quot; in the archives and that was the reason the Vatican kept them
closed. Professor Robert Wistrich of Hebrew University told the press that to read the
volumes without having access to the archives would be &quot;a farce.&quot; Of course, that was
exactly the charge that the team accepted.

In accepting the mandate to study the ADSS, members of the study group agreed to pursue
their work in a clearly defined way. They did not, however, drop their demand for full
access to the archives. In fact, that demand was ultimately placed ahead of the desire
to find the truth. This became evident when the team traveled to Rome to meet with
Vatican officials.

In April 2000, Dr. Eugene Fisher, Catholic coordinator for the study group, called Fr.
Peter Gumpel, relator for the cause of Pius XII’s sainthood, wanting to set up a meeting
at which the study group could question him. Fr. Gumpel agreed, but he asked that
questions be submitted to him in advance so that he would have time to prepare his
answers with supporting documentation.

The study group ultimately came to Rome during the month of October 2000. About two
weeks prior to their arrival, they sent ahead 47 questions for Fr. Gumpel. Inexplicably,
the questions had been formatted as a &quot;Preliminary Report.&quot; The charge given to the
group had not called for a preliminary report. It seems to have been an invention of the
scholars designed to apply more pressure on the Vatican to open sealed archives.

When Fr. Gumpel saw the 47 questions, he thought that the study group wanted them
answered, and he felt that it would take several days to address them all. As it ended
up, however, he was given only three hours with the group. As such, he was able to
address only a handful of questions. Perhaps that is just as well. The vocal
representatives of the group (notably Wistrich, Reich, and Dr. Michael Marrus of the
University of Toronto), made clear that they were not interested in answers to their
questions. They wanted Fr. Gumpel to join in their call for the opening of the archives.
Nothing short of that would be acceptable.

Fr. Gumpel pointed out that while it is legitimate for a historian to seek archival
information, there was sufficient information already available to answer the questions
that the study group had presented to him. He set about answering the 47 questions, with
references to available Vatican documents, books, memoirs, and other archival sources.

The study group would have nothing to do with this; the scholars wanted Vatican
archives. At one point, Seymour Reich even said that Fr. Gumpel could not possibly
answer the group’s question, because the question did not ask what happened, but what
the archives indicated had happened. (Fr. Fogarty and Fr. John Morley, another member of
the group, did however thank Fr. Gumpel for identifying relevant authority that had not
been considered by the group.)

Fr. Gumpel complained about previous breaches of confidentiality on the part of the
study group. He was assured that the group itself was outraged and that steps had been
taken to assure that there would be no further &quot;leaks.&quot; Unfortunately that was not the
case, while the team was still in Rome, the preliminary report, with all 47 questions,
was leaked to the press and published around the world.

The Associated Press called the preliminary report &quot;explosive.&quot; The New York Times said
it expressed the dissatisfaction of the six panel members with Vatican records. Le Monde
of Paris said it pointed to failures of the Pope and Church. Of course, the editors of
these papers thought that the preliminary report was really about Pope Pius XII. They
did not know that it was nothing more than a ploy to have the Vatican open the archives.

Having expressed regret for earlier leaks, one might have expected the study group to
have issued a condemnation of this breach. Perhaps Bernard Suchecky, who was
responsible, might have been suspended. Instead, certain members of the team were
emboldened. Professors Marrus and Wistrich were both widely quoted as saying that the
ball was now in the Vatican’s court. They had posed their 47 questions, and they would
await the Vatican’s reply. No mention was made of answers that were provided by Fr.
Gumpel, Cardinal Cassidy, Cardinal Laghi, and then Archbishop (now Cardinal) Mejía, all
of whom met with the study group in Rome.

Earlier this year, when Cardinal Cassidy stepped down from his post as President of the
Holy See’s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews, he was replaced by Cardinal
Walter Kasper, a German theologian. Cardinal Kasper was not influenced by the history
that had shaped the study group up until this point. He looked at what was taking place,
and he did not like it.

In an interview published June 21, 2001, Cardinal Kasper said: &quot;The commission failed to
do what it was charged to do - to read the Vatican's 11 published volumes on Pius'
pontificate. They must read the 11 volumes; they have never done the work they were
asked to do in a proper way.&quot; [See Catalyst, Dec. 2000: The Pope Pius XII Study Group:
Read the Documents!, making this same point.] Regarding the leaks, he called them
unacceptable, &quot;unethical&quot; behavior.

On the same day that the interview was published, Cardinal Kasper sent a letter to the
study group asking for a &quot;final report on this project.&quot; He noted that he did not expect
the final report to provide the whole answer to these issues, nor would it signal the
end of discussion on this matter. It would, however, fulfill the mandate given to the
study group. Cardinal Kasper also noted that some of the 47 questions had been answered
by Fr. Gumpel and that others had been forwarded to the Vatican Secretariat of State,
which controls the archives. The Cardinal also made clear that the group would not be
granted access to sealed Vatican archives.

On July 20, in a letter to Cardinal Kasper, the five remaining scholars on the team (
Dr. Eva Fleischner having resigned for personal reasons) suspended their work, saying
that they could not complete their assignment without &quot;access in some reasonable manner
to additional archival material.&quot; This is when everything really began to fall apart.

Although Cardinal Kasper did no more than restate the agreement that had been in place
from the very beginning of the project, Professor Wistrich imputed bad faith to the Holy
See. &quot;The Vatican is not really interested in allowing us to pursue our work further.
Whatever expectation they had of the panel - that we would give carte blanch to Pius's
beatification, or that the situation would be defused without probing too deeply - they
were wrong.... They moved the goalposts.&quot; Seymour Reich, expressed &quot;deep disappointment&quot;
that the Vatican would not open all its wartime archives to the scholars and suggested
that the letter from the scholars was a form of protest.

Fr. Fogarty then issued a statement disassociating himself from what Reich had said.
Eugene Fisher also condemned &quot;Reich’s attempt to twist the statement of the scholars to
say what it did not intend to say.&quot; He called it &quot;inexplicable and inexcusable.&quot;
Unfortunately, the mainstream press picked up on Wistrich and Reich, not on the
rebuttals.

The truth, as explained by Fr. Fogarty, was that &quot;there were two different sets of
expectations and two different agendas from the very beginning, and they finally
clashed.&quot;

Some members of the study group viewed the project as a vehicle to press for open access
to the archives, but that was never their charge. They were supposed to conduct a
thorough study of the ADSS. &quot;It is a fact, we could not work together with some people
wanting greater access and others saying we can do more work; there was no point in
saying we could work together as a group,&quot; Fr. Fogarty explained.

Had the group carried out its assignment without delving into polemics and political
posturing, it could have answered almost all of the questions about Pope Pius XII’s
conduct during the war. Those documents, which were meticulously edited by
world-renowned scholars, make clear that the Pope was not silent, that he assisted the
Allies, opposed Nazi racial atrocities, and that the Church fed, sheltered, and clothed
victims of all races, religions, and nationalities.

A historian might legitimately ask whether a different approach to the situation would
have worked better to oppose the Nazis, but the documents leave no doubt about where the
Holy See stood. Pope Pius did everything that he thought possible and appropriate to
help Jews and other victims of the Nazis. Had the group carried out its assignment, that
would have been made clear, and that would have gone a long way toward healing the
division between Catholics and Jews. Unfortunately, that is not what happened.

Rather than seeking truth, too many people put their personal desires to enter the
sealed archives above the agreed aim of the project. They did this at the expense of
both truth and the continued viability of the project. The results that they obtained
only raised suspicions and doubts. What a shame. What a wasted opportunity.

False Pope John XXIII

&lt; http://www.truecatholic.org/nop/menu.htm#j23 &gt; Menu of John XXIII

The first in a series of anti-popes who NEVER for one instant held the Papacy of the
Catholic Church

John XXIII

John XXIII signing

“Pacem in Terris”

April 11, 1963

John XXIII, aka Angelo Roncalli, wrote an encyclical entitled “Pacem in Terris” in which
he extols the (atheistic) United Nations, and puts the rights of man over man's duty
towards God.

This teaching and encyclical is quite consistent with Roncalli's adopted religion of
Rosicrucian Freemasonry.

See below.

Roncalli - a Freemason - a non-pope

Angelo Cardinal Roncalli, who to all appearances, seemed to assume the papacy under the
name of John XXIII in 1958, was in fact the first in a series of non-popes.   Roncalli
snatched the Chair of Peter by the devious assistance of the B’nai B’rith, the Jewish
Masonic arm that controls all the instruments of world power today.  He was followed by
false popes Paul VI, John Paul I, and John Paul II.

How was this possible?  It was found in hind-sight that Angelo Roncalli joined the
Freemasons in 1935 when he was papal nuncio to Turkey.   Even though he was a valid
priest and bishop at the time, this hideous act removed him from the Catholic Church, so
he could never become pope.   The details of this Masonic initiation can be found in a
book written in 1984, entitled “The Broken Cross
&lt; http://www.truecatholic.org/brokencross.htm &gt; ” by Piers Compton, a Vatican insider.

The Vatican II council is further evidence that Roncalli was never the pope.  Vatican II
was called to reform the Church, to change the Church and all the sacraments.   In
actuality, it did not and could not change one iota of the Catholic Church nor its
sacraments, but it instituted a new non-Catholic religion known as the Novus Ordo.  This
was the legacy of anti-pope John XXIII.  By their fruits, ye shall know them.

Beatified by John Paul II

At the exhuming of the body of John XXIII relating to the advancement of his cause for
Beatification (by successor false pope John Paul II), the group of witnesses present
were shocked to find that the body in the coffin was facing downward. [Towards Hell !]

Spanish Sect Leader Says He Is the Real Pope

Emma Ross-Thomas – Reuters July 27, 2004

EL PALMAR DE TROYA, Spain (Reuters) - Pope John Paul II has a challenger.

Papal pretender &quot;Gregorio XVII&quot; is leader of a self-styled church in Spain who says God
crowned him after Pope Paul VI's 1978 death, that Satan controls the Vatican and that
the devil will crucify him at the start of an apocalyptic end of an era.

There were some 300 worshipers attending services on a recent Reuters visit to
Gregorio's church in El Palmar de Troya, a vast cathedral-like complex of domes, columns
and arches perched on a hill in Spain's dusty southern Andalusia region.

Church members say followers number several thousand and come from as far away as the
Americas. But membership is clearly dwarfed by the 1 billion Roman Catholics around the
world who recognize John Paul as head of the church.

&quot;Rome ... is no longer the capital of Christianity; the new Rome is the Sacred Place of
El Palmar de Troya,&quot; a booklet from Gregorio's church quotes God as telling him.

Gregorio's church has conferred sainthood on former Spanish dictator Francisco Franco
for defending Catholicism in Spain's Civil War and four subsequent decades of fascist
rule.

Followers call 58-year-old Gregorio the last pope, and say he will be crucified. An
electronic information package handed out at the church shows gory pictures of Gregorio
with bleeding wounds in the hands, torso and forehead similar to those of Christ on the
cross.

&quot;At the end of his reign the anti-Christ appears and he will put the pope to death, he
will crucify him, and then Christ will appear and destroy the anti-Christ and a new era
will begin,&quot; a middle-aged Irish man told Reuters on his way to mass.

Gregorio's congregation rejects reforms made by the Catholic Church at the 1962-65
Second Vatican Council, such as saying mass in local languages instead of Latin and
dialogue with other religions and branches of Christianity.

&quot;We believe that he is the true pope. We believe this is where the true church is,&quot; said
a 21-year-old Irish man, visiting the parched, dusty village on a pilgrimage.

Pope John Paul has taken unprecedented steps toward reconciliation with Jews. He is the
first pope to visit a synagogue, a mosque or a Protestant church.

Mass is said in Latin and members of the congregation -- all wearing pictures of
Christ's face and two bleeding hearts around their necks -- spend most of the service on
their knees.

Men and women are separated in the nave and women dressed like nuns and wearing long
black veils over their heads and faces sit behind a latticed wall.

A doorman said between &quot;nuns&quot; and &quot;priests&quot; 150 people live in the complex. Followers
are forbidden from visiting other churches. The faithful worship in their homes and
traveling priests visit members of the church who live outside El Palmar.

Women must cover their heads, wrists and necks and wear skirts that come &quot;at least four
fingers below the knee.&quot; Trousers for women are forbidden.

A &quot;nun&quot; posted at the entrance to the church checks women's skirts for transparency.

The dress code must also be followed outside church.

&quot;We can't go to the beach. We'd probably fall into sin if we went to the beach,&quot; the
middle-aged Irish man said.

&quot;Apparitions&quot;

Before crowning himself &quot;pope,&quot; the man formerly known as Clemente Dominguez said he had
visions of the Virgin Mary and messages from God that the church in Rome and Pope Paul
VI were being misled.

&quot;Satan is governing in the Vatican,&quot; Gregorio was told in a vision in 1971, according to
one booklet. A year later he was told, &quot;Masons and communism have infiltrated the
Vatican.&quot;

Gregorio lost his sight in a 1976 car crash but the Virgin Mary promised he will regain
it one day, church documents say.

Two years later Paul VI died and Clemente Dominguez, on a trip to Colombia, proclaimed
himself pope.

Most of his followers -- who say their donations built the church -- come from abroad,
where they say they heard about the movement in books or by word of mouth.

Spanish locals say they are unimpressed although some believe the Virgin Mary appeared
there before the basilica -- which dwarfs the parish church -- was founded.

Church documents say the young Clemente Dominguez went to El Palmar initially because he
heard about the apparitions.

&quot;The people in the village don't believe in these things although there are 70
witnesses, serious people, who have seen apparitions,&quot; said a 51-year-old man who
declined to be named.

The Roman Catholic church in Seville takes neither the church nor the apparitions
seriously.

These days &quot;Pope Gregorio&quot; rarely ventures beyond his walled complex although he used to
be seen in bars and restaurants around town in El Palmar and nearby Seville, locals say.

The corpulent leader does not always lead services but appears for special occasions.

But Pura Hernandez, a 76-year-old woman from Barcelona, said that his presence was
overwhelming.

&quot;I saw him once in ecstasy. There were so many angels,&quot; she whispered.

New Pope is a Former Nazi

author: Igor

The truth is, according to his own autobiography [Milestones: Memoirs 1927-1977] that
Ratzinger was enrolled in the Hitler Youth in the early 1940s, and did not resist the
Nazi draft, choosing to join Hitler's army in 1943.

Church Names ex-Nazi as Pope

The Roman Church Defends its Immense Riches by Supporting Fascism Worldwide

The new Pope Benoit 16, the German Cardinal Ratzinger, is a former Nazi.

The truth is, according to his own autobiography [Milestones: Memoirs 1927-1977] that
Ratzinger (along with his brother) was enrolled in the Hitler Youth in the early 1940s,
and did not resist the Nazi draft, choosing to join Hitler's army in 1943 rather than
claim status as a conscientious objector (as Jehovah's Witnesses did in Ratzinger's home
town). Ratzinger never made any attempt to assist the Resistance to Fascism in Germany.
http://p217.ezboard.com/ftheratzingerforumfrm21.showMessage?topicID=7...

The previous Pope, John Paul II (Karol Wojtyla) has also been accused of being a Nazi
collaborator, even before he entered the church. Ratzinger explicitly referred to the
fact, saying John Paul II's funeral mass, that Wojtyla &quot;worked in a chemical factory
during the war,&quot; as he recited a brief biography.
Wojtyla (John Paul II) worked in Nazi-occupied Poland for I.G. Farben's Solvay Drugs.
One of the factory's products was cyanide, or Zyklon B gas, which was sold to Nazi death
camps such as Auschwitz. Wojtyla, who had also been an actor, is said to have entered
the priesthood in November 1946 to escape possible arrest and prosecution as a war
criminal.

Church Silent During the Holocaust

World War II-era pope Pius XII, aka &quot;Hitler's Pope,&quot; failed to once condemn the historic
crime of industrial genocide of Jews and others under Naziism. The best witness of the
Pope's silence is a statement by Nazi Germany's ambassador to the Vatican, Baron von
Weizsacker. Weizsacker stated that the pope (Pius XII) had not &quot;allowed himself to be
carried away into making any demonstrative statements against the deportation of the
Jews... [and that] he has done all he could, in this delicate question as in other
matters, not to prejudice relationships with the German government. Since further action
on the Jewish problem is probably not to be expected here in Rome, it may be assumed
that this question, so troublesome to German-Vatican relations, has been disposed of.&quot;
http://www.chivalricorders.org/vatican/piusXII.htm

Catholic-Fascist Regime in Croatia
Following the Nazi invasion and dismemberment of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the
Independent State of Croatia was established as a clerical-fascist state under the rule
of the Croatian fascist party, the Ustashe. Some 700,000 Serbs, Jews, Romas and other
anti-fascists were killed in the Jasenovac death-camp complex, while many more were
killed in smaller camps or in local massacres. While the Ustashe regime set about to
racially exterminate all Serbs, Jews and Romas living within its borders, it also
carried out a systematic policy of plundering the assets of these three nationalities.
These looted assets, the property of millions of people, were never recovered. The bulk
of it was smuggled out of Croatia at the end of the war to the Vatican, and from there
to still other destinations.
http://www.vaticanbankclaims.com/press1.html

The Vatican responded to lawsuits seeking to reclaim looted assets by declaring itself
immune to prosecution by virtue of its statehood.

See the following article excerpt:

Vatican's Claim to Statehood used to Avoid Lawsuit
November 28, 2000
Reuters

The Vatican's bank has asked a U.S. court to throw out a lawsuit charging it with
laundering gold and other assets stolen by a [Catholic] Nazi puppet regime, arguing that
the Vatican has immunity because it is an independent state.
http://www.seechange.org/what's%20new/Vatican%20Bank%20Lawsuit.htm
**

In fact, the Church has consistently supported fascist regimes throughout modern
history, in central and South America, in the USA and elsewhere, just as it has always
supported the forces of reaction, in order to protect and increase its vast riches.

&quot;The Catholic church is the biggest financial power, wealth accumulator and property
owner in existence. She is a greater possessor of material riches than any other single
institution, corporation, bank, giant trust, government or state of the whole globe. The
pope, as the visible ruler of this immense amassment of wealth, is consequently the
richest man in the world. No one can realistically assess how much he is worth in terms
of billions of dollars.&quot;
http://www.chick.com/reading/books/153/153_10.asp

St Peter's Basilica is the Vatican's most famous building, adjoined by the papal palace
with more than 1,000 rooms.

The historic edifice with fortress walls dating back to the 16th or 17th centuries
gained independent status in 1929 after the conclusion of Lateran Pacts with Italy. On
February 11, Pope Pius XI and Benito Mussolini created the Vatican in its current
dimensions and secured additional sovereignty rights and properties.

The Vatican's total assets are a well-kept secret but one which is the topic of much
speculation... They include [priceless] works of art and palaces and properties which
for the most part cannot be sold. Large parts of the Vatican's assets are in securities
and gold reserves.

19 April 2002
Worldly assets

• The Vatican Bank, Istituto per le Opere di Religione ... [&quot;Institute for Religious
Works&quot;! does not reveal financial data and records are kept only for 10 years*.] Profits
and dividends are paid directly to the Pope. It enjoys the status of a central bank and
has a dealing room adorned with crucifixes and papal portraits where 20 traders work.

• The 20,000 parishes in America [alone] had revenues of $7.5bn (£5.18bn) )in 2000.

• In the 1980s the Vatican Bank was forced to pay $241m for its part in the collapse of
Banco Ambrosiano. Roberto Calvi, &quot;the Pope's banker&quot; who dealt with the failed bank, was
found hanging from a rope beneath Blackfriars Bridge [London].
http://www.vaticanbankclaims.com/worldly.htm

See also THE VATICAN BILLIONS by Avro Manhattan.

&quot;The Vatican has large investments with the Rothschilds of Britain, France and America,
with the Hambros Bank, with the Credit Suisse in London and Zurich. In the United States
it has large investments with the Morgan Bank, the Chase-Manhattan Bank, the First
National Bank of New York, the Bankers Trust Company, and others. The Vatican has
billions of shares in the most powerful international corporations such as Gulf Oil,
Shell, General Motors, Bethlehem Steel, General Electric, International Business
Machines, ... etc. ..

&quot;In a statement published in connection with a bond prospectus, the Boston archdiocese
listed its assets at $635 million ($635,891,004), which is 9.9 times its liabilities.
This leaves a net worth of 571 million dollars ($571,704,953). It is not difficult to
discover the truly astonishing wealth of the church, once we add the riches of the
twenty-eight archdioceses and 122 dioceses of the U.S.A., some of which are even
wealthier than that of Boston.

&quot;Some idea of the real estate and other forms of wealth controlled by the Catholic
church may be gathered by the remark of a member of the New York Catholic Conference,
namely 'that his church probably ranks second only to the United States Government in
total annual purchase.' Another statement, made by a nationally syndicated Catholic
priest, perhaps is even more telling. 'The Catholic church,' he said, 'must be the
biggest corporation in the United States. We have a branch office in every neighborhood.
Our assets and real estate holdings must exceed those of Standard Oil, A.T.&amp;T., and U.S.
Steel combined. And our roster of dues-paying members must be second only to the tax
rolls of the United States Government.'

&quot;The Catholic church, once all her assets have been put together, is the most formidable
stockbroker in the world. The Vatican, independently of each successive pope, has been
increasingly orientated towards the U.S. The Wall Street Journal said that the Vatican's
financial deals in the U.S. alone were so big that very often it sold or bought gold in
lots of a million or more dollars at one time.

&quot;The Vatican's treasure of solid gold has been estimated by the United Nations World
Magazine to amount to several billion dollars. A large bulk of this is stored in gold
ingots with the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, while banks in England and Switzerland hold
the rest. But this is just a small portion of the wealth of the Vatican, which in the
U.S. alone, is greater than that of the five wealthiest giant corporations of the
country. When to that is added all the real estate, property, stocks and shares abroad,
then the staggering accumulation of the wealth of the Catholic church becomes so
formidable as to defy assessment.

Vatican Bank Top 10 Money Laundering Destination

According to one global source, the Vatican is the main destination for over $55 billion
in illegal Italian money laundering and the number 8 destination worldwide for laundered
money, ranked well ahead of such offshore havens as the Bahamas, Switzerland, and
Liechtenstein.

In a recent report by the London Telegraph and the Inside Fraud Bulletin, the Vatican
was named as a top &quot;cut out&quot; country along with the offshore banking centers of Nauru,
Macao, and Mauritius. A &quot;cut out&quot; country is one whose banking secrecy makes it is all
but impossible to trace laundered funds back to their source.

*The Vatican Bank is desperately resisting a legal action for an accounting of stolen
World War II assets in a San Francisco Federal court (Alperin v. Vatican Bank) filed by
Serb and Jewish Holocaust survivors. Contrary to the above reports, a declaration filed
under penalty of perjury by the Vatican Bank's attorney, Franzo Grande Stevens, states
in part that the Vatican Bank's &quot;fundamental purpose is to promote pious acts&quot; and that
its depositors &quot;are essentially limited to Vatican state employees, members of the Holy
See, religious orders, and persons who deposit money destined, at least in part, for
works of piety.&quot; Stevens also declared to the court that the Pope controls the Vatican
Bank and that bank records are not retained after ten years.
http://www.vaticanbankclaims.com/vatpr.html

To sum up very simply, the Church is a business. The religious overtones are ancient
marketing. You can see the imitation among the ruling elite today, where the
Rockefellers or George Soros refer to themselves as &quot;philanthropists,&quot; and W. Bush
speaks of &quot;human dignity&quot; and a &quot;A culture of life,&quot; etc.&amp;#8213;even as they operate the
Death Machine for their greater profit.

For all its &quot;Big Lie&quot; hypocrisy, the Church's marketing is quite direct about one thing,
which is its metaphor for the faithful as sheep.

Ratzinger can only be called a nazi by utilizing the greatest stretch of imagination.
All of his 'activities' were subscribed compulsory. It was obligatory to join the Hitler
Youth for someone who reached 14 by 1941. Again, anti-air gun crews were manned by part
time scoolboys of his age as compulsory service. (The Reich suffered 1000 plane-raids in
44-45.) He was drafted to the regular German Army at the age of 18 and luckily the war
ended just about when he finished his basic training. He was never a NSDAP member, he
did not voluntered for the Waffen-SS or so forth, which would warant you to be
scandalized. You condemn this adolescent for not refusing to serve his country in
wartime and choosing the gallows instead. (Admitedly that option was available to
exercise). I find this rather sanctimonious and frankly a bit to harsh.

I knew it would be Rat. They knew it would be Rat before the conclave. He had the
prominent media role during the funeral. No surprise that they so quickly voted him in.

I am trans and this is very bad news for my LBGTI communities. Rat is very anti-queer
and anti-equal marriage. He obviously learned hatred of homosexuals from the nazis. I am
amazed at the brazeness of the church to elevate to the papacy someone who was a nazi
youth and part of the nazi army. That is heavy baggage, any way you look at it. You
would have thought the church would have avoided that controversy. But then, we're all
supposed to look the other way these days as global fascism is orchestrated from the
U.S. to the Middle East to the Vatican and many places in between.

If this man were a great spiritual leader in the tradition of the church's notion of
sainthood, yes, he would have had the moral courage and fortitude in his teens to refuse
to serve the nazis and aid their evil mass killing. That he did not do so indicates his
internalization of fascism. After all, Joan of Arc - Saint Joan - was burned at the
stake in her teens (age 16) for following the voices of god she heard leading her to
struggle for her peasant people against oppressors, all while crossdressing as a man and
calling herself Jean d'Arc (a masculine name), I might add.

This new pope will never be a saint. Could he be the devil in disguise?

Joseph Alois Ratzinger was born in Marktl am Inn, in Bavaria, the second son and
youngest child of Joseph Ratzinger Senior and his wife, Maria, who was employed as a
barmaid. The elder Ratzinger was a police officer who served in both the Bavarian State
Police (Landespolizei) and the national Order Police (Ordnungspolizei). He retired in
1937, and settled in the town of Traunstein. The Sunday Times of London described him as
&quot;an anti-Nazi whose attempts to rein in Hitler?s brown shirts forced the family to move
several times.&quot; [1] The Pope has two elder siblings: Georg Ratzinger, who also became a
priest as well as famous musician, and Maria Ratzinger.

When Ratzinger turned 14 in 1941, he joined the Hitler Youth. National Catholic Reporter
correspondent and biographer John Allen writes that Ratzinger was an unenthusiastic
member who refused to attend meetings. Ratzinger has mentioned that a Nazi mathematics
professor arranged reduced tuition payments for him at seminary. While this normally
required documentation of attendance at Hitler Youth activities, according to Ratzinger,
his professor arranged that the young seminary student did not need to attend those
gatherings to receive a scholarship.

In 1943, when he was 16, Ratzinger was drafted into the German Army. He and many of his
classmates were drafted into the Flak or anti-aircraft corps. They were posted first to
Ludwigsfeld, north of Munich, as part of a detachment responsible for guarding a BMW
aircraft engine plant that used slave labour from Dachau. Next they were sent to
Unterföhring, northwest of Munich, and briefly to Innsbruck. From Innsbruck their unit
went to Gilching to protect the jet fighter base and to attack Allied bombers as they
massed to begin their runs towards Munich. At Gilching, Ratzinger served in telephone
communications.

On September 10, 1944 his class was released from the Flak Corps. Returning home,
Ratzinger had already received a new draft notice for the Reichsarbeitdienst. He was
posted to the Hungarian border area of Austria which had been annexed by Germany in the
Anschluss of 1938. Here he was trained in the &quot;cult of the spade&quot; and upon the surrender
of Hungary to Russia was put to work setting up anti-tank defences in preparation for
the expected Red Army offensive. On November 20, 1944, his unit was released from
service.

Ratzinger again returned home. After three weeks passed, he was drafted into the army at
Munich and assigned to the infantry barracks in the center of Traunstein, the city near
which his family lived. After basic infantry training, his unit was sent to various
posts around the city. They were never sent to the front.

In late April or early May, days or weeks before the German surrender, Ratzinger
deserted. He left the city of Traunstein and returned to his village on the outskirts.
Desertion was widespread during the last weeks of the war, even though in principle
