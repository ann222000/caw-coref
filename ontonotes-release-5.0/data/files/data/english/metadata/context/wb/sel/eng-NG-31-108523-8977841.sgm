Pretty much fails the test of observation.  There are massive
objects that are swallowing stuff, but the stuff never hits any
kind of surface.  So it never runs into earlier ingestion, stuff
the paper-writers can't figure out how it gets in.

It sounds like these theorists are saying that nothing actually falls
into a black hole but stays in permanent limbo at the edges of the event
horizon. That's because time slows down to zero by the time it reaches
the event horizon. So what does that mean? A black hole is just a big
void in time and space inside which nothing exists, including energy?

I would expect surface interactions, much as occur with neutron

I understand that &quot;dual to a black hole&quot; are not classical black

The details are a bit beyond me but the point is
that thermal is purely random so you can't get
any &quot;information&quot; about the infalling material
from the subsequent Hawking radiation other than
bulk parameters (e.g. the total energy). On the
other hand, what they call &quot;pre-Hawking radiation&quot;
is released before the material crosses an event
horizon and therefore can carry away information
about its structure.

I think the overall argument is that the maths
suggests that form of radiation removes sufficient
energy that the event horizon doesn't form. That
might suggest we should observe large energy
emissions but if the material gets turned to
radiation at high enough redshift, then it could
be spread out over a very long time. The detailed
nature of the spectrum would be the only indicator
if I follow their gist, but that would depend on
the details of the infalling material.

I don't understand that. The accretion disc
around a real, small black hole is hot and
cools by various forms of radiation, notably
thermal in the X-ray spectrum. Hawking
radiation is also &quot;hot&quot; if that's what you

It was moving at a few tens of km/s, the material
falling onto the accretion disc arrives at a
sizeable fraction of the speed of light, perhaps
1000 times faster and kinetic energy goes as the
square of that so a million times more energy per
unit mass. Then note that the amounts of matter
falling in can be large if a candidate is
stripping a companion star in a binary system.
I won't hazard a guess at figures but see if you
can find some 'typical' mass loss rates.

I think the &quot;pre-Hawking radiation&quot; is the new

formation might need more careful modelling and
certainly they need to show that there remains a
threshold above which the observable radiation
falls as the mass rises.

Thermodynamic information is &quot;information of state&quot;.  It includes both

The stuff causing the curvature is inside.  It has no problem
expressing across the event horizon.  If we ever get quantum gravity,
it will show us how.  I understand that you want to insist that
curvature (or even spacetime) exists separate from mass/energy, but I
don't.  And like the other dualities that theories have in their
formulations, the fact that neither &quot;opposite&quot; viewpoint can be

Frozen into what, George?  What part of spacetime holds charge?
Virtual exchange particles, responsible for among other things the
charge interaction, don't care about c, distance, path or time.  We

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think the overall argument is that the maths

&gt; &gt; &gt; energy that the event horizon doesn't form. That
&gt; &gt; &gt; might suggest we should observe large energy
&gt; &gt; &gt; emissions but if the material gets turned to
&gt; &gt; &gt; radiation at high enough redshift, then it could
&gt; &gt; &gt; be spread out over a very long time. The detailed
&gt; &gt; &gt; nature of the spectrum would be the only indicator

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The details are a bit beyond me but the point is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that thermal is purely random so you can't get
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any &quot;information&quot; about the infalling material
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the subsequent Hawking radiation other than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bulk parameters (e.g. the total energy).

&gt; &gt; &gt; But thermodynamic information *is* &quot;entirely random&quot; ...

&gt; &gt; Yes, I understood your reply up to there.

&gt; &gt; &gt; to &quot;entirely
&gt; &gt; &gt; ordered&quot;.

&gt; &gt; Pardon?

&gt; Thermodynamic information is &quot;information of state&quot;.  It includes both
&gt; &quot;that stuff is entirely disordered&quot; and &quot;that stuff is highly
&gt; ordered&quot;, along with the temperature stuff.  Photons were emitted as
&gt; the &quot;stuff&quot; entered the ordered state.
">

Unless I am mistaken, the photons in thermal radiation
carry no information. Whether the stuff from which it
is emitted is ordered or not makes no difference to
the radiation, thus thermal radiation from a black but
highly ordered crystal is indistiguishable from thermal
radiation from any other source.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is expected that both momentum and charge

You answered that yourself earlier, the distant

takes an infinite time for the light from that
event to escape, rather he sees an infalling

some radius.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; So our only concern (???) is why &quot;what was hot&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; is seen (before this paper) to become very cool,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and become (essentially) a perfect heat sink.

&gt; &gt; I don't understand that. The accretion disc
&gt; &gt; around a real, small black hole is hot and
&gt; &gt; cools by various forms of radiation, notably
&gt; &gt; thermal in the X-ray spectrum. Hawking
&gt; &gt; radiation is also &quot;hot&quot; if that's what you
&gt; &gt; meant by it doesn't necessarily cool, it
&gt; &gt; gets hotter as the hole evaporates or cooler
&gt; &gt; if the hole gains mass.

&gt; That is the current thinking, yes.  How does stuff accrete?  Jupiter
&gt; shatters anything near it, that does not orbit it...
">

That would happen, infalling material would be
&quot;spaghettified&quot; and disintegrate and the resulting
dust would go into orbit - angular momentum is
conserved.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but generate
&gt; &quot;friction&quot;, to stop the bulk of anything &quot;infalling&quot; from actually
&gt; entering... ?
">

New material will experience friction in the form
of collisions with the disc material until it is
aggregated into it, the kinetic energy of the
differential speed being converted to heat.

Angular momentum can be carried away in jets and
of course spins up the hole similar to millisecond
pulsars (my guess is most will be near to maximally
rotating Kerr holes) and the disc will be spun up
by frame dragging to a limiting value where random
collisions in the disc push a fraction over the
speed needed for escape (like &quot;evaporation&quot; from
globular clusters).

There are many process at work but a dynamically
stable disc with an inflow and various losses seems
perfectly reasonable to me, and it is obvious that
the energy input would be enormous and significant
X ray and gamma emission is to be expected simply
because of the temperature.

Just as some material may be ejected outwards, some
will randomly be slowed and fall out of the disc
and go beyond the point of no return. It is that
infeed that needs to be considered here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand, what they call &quot;pre-Hawking

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information about its structure.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There are great gobs of energy expressed by both
&gt; &gt; &gt; neutron stars and black hole &quot;candidates&quot;.  I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; never found our descriptions, as to why this
&gt; &gt; &gt; should be so, to be entirely convincing.

&gt; &gt; It comes from the accretion disc, not the hole

jostling for a while but eventually it all settles

&quot;Black body radiation&quot; is information.  Absorption / emission
spectra is information.  As to whether this contributes to the

You will have a characteristic emission when a particular bond is

And we will continue to disagree.  And it cannot be
experimentally disproven, since there is no stretch of space that
does not have two bits of matter/energy either propagating

I am not convinced that you can get a disc from captured

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The details are a bit beyond me but the point is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that thermal is purely random so you can't get
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any &quot;information&quot; about the infalling material
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the subsequent Hawking radiation other than
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bulk parameters (e.g. the total energy).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But thermodynamic information *is* &quot;entirely random&quot; ...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, I understood your reply up to there.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to &quot;entirely
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ordered&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Pardon?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Thermodynamic information is &quot;information of state&quot;.  It
&gt; &gt;&gt; includes both &quot;that stuff is entirely disordered&quot; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;that stuff is highly ordered&quot;, along with the temperature
&gt; &gt;&gt; stuff.  Photons were emitted as the &quot;stuff&quot; entered the
&gt; &gt;&gt; ordered state.

&gt; &gt; Unless I am mistaken, the photons in thermal radiation
&gt; &gt; carry no information.

&gt; &quot;Black body radiation&quot; is information.
">

Not in the QM sense AFAIK, the emission is random
and does not carry information about the source.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Absorption / emission
&gt; spectra is information.  As to whether this contributes to the
&gt; &quot;information loss paradox&quot;, probably not.  You lose this (in some

&gt; &gt; Whether the stuff from which it is emitted is ordered
&gt; &gt; or not makes no difference to the radiation, thus
&gt; &gt; thermal radiation from a black but highly ordered
&gt; &gt; crystal is indistiguishable from thermal radiation from
&gt; &gt; any other source.

No, thermal black body radiation is described by

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No, the external gravitational effects are the

I am not so sure, but you say a couple of different

delayed from just before it went in?

No, I'm not doing that, I am only giving a counter

The GR model is quite clear on the matter though,
ripples can progress through the metric without
the need for matter other than the source:

GR is a set of equations, &quot;interpretation&quot; doesn't
come into it IMHO. It should be possible to look at
the model of a BH and say where an external influence
at some time originated, near but outside the horizon
or inside. My point is that the result of that is only
valid within GR, and GR only gives one answer. We cannot
assume the result will be meaningful in any other as yet
unformulated theory, we just have to wait and see.

Yes but virtual photons are a quantum effect while
black holes are classical GR and I'm not sure you

AIUI, the horizon expands as the mass enters in the

would expand around one foot as you slid the other

&gt;&gt; &gt; the question of whether or not true cannot be

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In some other subsequent theory, the concept

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hypothetically some quantum gravity model might
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; describe gravity as the exchange of virtual gravitons
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in a perfectly flat Minkowski spacetime, who knows.

&gt;&gt; &gt; But you cannot assume an argument based on
&gt;&gt; &gt; no-aether, to make a proof against aether (as a
&gt;&gt; &gt; sylogism) using a theory that has no &quot;grasp&quot; on

&gt;&gt; No, I'm not doing that, I am only giving a counter
&gt;&gt; example as proof that it is _possible_, I'm not
&gt;&gt; trying to prove that there _won't_ be curvature, we
&gt;&gt; simply don't know. It's like saying that since SR
&gt;&gt; doesn't have an aether and produces the same
&gt;&gt; conclusions as LET, it is possible that future
&gt;&gt; theories won't have an aether (and vice versa!).

&gt; We'll see what you said to my confusion about your position below...

&gt;&gt; &gt; GR starts with spacetime issuing
&gt;&gt; &gt; from mass/energy, and inertia being a property
&gt;&gt; &gt; of the Universe and expressed at each bit of
&gt;&gt; &gt; mass, but loses any sense of that in its

&gt;&gt; &gt; that such has been disproven.  What it really
&gt;&gt; &gt; means is that GR is entirely transparent to that
&gt;&gt; &gt; question.

&gt;&gt; GR says the metric is distorted by stress/energy, not
&gt;&gt; that it &quot;issues from&quot; it, but your are right about
&gt;&gt; inertia.

&gt; How are &quot;the field&quot; and &quot;the Universe&quot; different, in your opinion

&gt;&gt; GR is a set of equations, &quot;interpretation&quot; doesn't

&gt;&gt; the horizon or inside. My point is that the result of
&gt;&gt; that is only valid within GR, and GR only gives one

Thanks for the detail. I read it in the opposite sense,
it says:

&quot;It was thus felt necessary to intoduce a field, that
could also exist in &quot;empty space&quot; in the absence of
ponderable matter.&quot;

However, the references are primarily to the electric
and magnetic fields of Maxwell's equations. You asked
me &quot;How are 'the field' and 'the Universe' different,
in your opinion George?&quot;. If I put my hand in front of
a CRT, the hairs on the back of my hand stand up due
to the electric field. The universe is everything to
the limits of observability and beyond.

You also said &quot;Einstein said 'the field' was responsible
for curvature.&quot;. The equations say the stress/energy
tensor causes curvature but the electric field is one
possible source of energy.

What? The M-Z interferometer works because both
paths are traversed by each individual photon.
If a photon only took one path it would have a
50:50 chance of landing on each detector after
the final splitter. Anyway, the most probable
time of arrival at the detector is L/c after
emission where L is the path length so again
it hardly supports the FTL motion needed to

&gt; Lets just leave it as I find the &quot;first cause&quot; missing.  An accretion disc
&gt; is necessary to form and maintain an accretion disc.  Just a little

Accretion discs are _seen_ David, we have to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Still unanswered.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Well see above, I see no problem at all in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; envisioning a Saturn-like model with the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; amalgamated into, a much denser and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hotter disc, AKA 'ring system'.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I am not convinced that you can get a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; disc from captured material.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We see them round newly forming stars
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and other systems so why not around black
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; holes. Observations suggest they are there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Agreed.  However, we do not see that in
&gt;&gt;&gt; *this* solar system.  Here we see skies
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;swept clean&quot; of most debris, with the
&gt;&gt;&gt; notable exception of the asteroid belt and
&gt;&gt;&gt; planetary rings.

&gt;&gt; Sure, there is no more material left, but that
&gt;&gt; doesn't justify saying that you _cannot_ get
&gt;&gt; a disc from captured material where such
&gt;&gt; material _is_ available.

&gt; &quot;Orange hair, big nose, and floppy shoes.&quot;

&gt; It was expected that this solar system had the makings of an accretion

&gt; and managed to sweep the skies clean...

&gt; We don't need to drag this part on.  I just need to think some more.

Yes, like how big a planet (and how long) do you
need to sweep clean a disc 400 light years across

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Saturn's rings don't sit on a surface!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Saturn's rings are quite far from the surface of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the planet, such that its atmosphere has negligible

&gt; Accretion disc is beyond 6M, and there is no &quot;friction&quot; possible at that

The friction is within the disc, notice in the
picture the brightest part is out at 200 light
years radius. Stuff orbits through, gets shredded
and stopped by that material, dynamical friction
as you say, and the kinetic energy heats it up
until it glows.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Not in the QM sense AFAIK, the emission is

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the source.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Heat transfer is to a body at its temperature.  A

&gt; &gt; &gt; No, in this context &quot;information&quot; is the quantum
&gt; &gt; &gt; numbers of the particles that entered the black

&gt; &gt; And how is it any different if the mass is located in

OK.  Let's forget the &quot;black body&quot; stuff.
How is mass located in the Coal Sack different from mass located in a
black hole, from any distance of 100 ly or more?  We can't see
anything inside the Coal Sack either (barring improvement in

&gt; &gt; Read it again carefully.  Diamond *can only initiate

&gt; &gt; far cry from anything approaching a classical black

&gt; Yes, and since we are discussing Hawking radiation

&gt;&gt; &gt; absurd, as long a physical reality is seen
&gt;&gt; &gt; exclusively in ponderable bodies.  It requires the
&gt;&gt; &gt; idea of the field as the representative of reality,
&gt;&gt; &gt; in combination with the general principle of
&gt;&gt; &gt; relativity, to show the true kernel of Descartes'

&gt;&gt; &gt; Based on the balance of the text, I think the

&gt;&gt; &gt; fundamentally bonded to the &quot;ponderable
&gt;&gt; &gt; matter&quot; necessary to, for example, produce
&gt;&gt; &gt; diffraction.

&gt;&gt; Thanks for the detail. I read it in the opposite sense,
&gt;&gt; it says:

&gt;&gt;  &quot;It was thus felt necessary to intoduce a field, that
&gt;&gt;   could also exist in &quot;empty space&quot; in the absence of
&gt;&gt;   ponderable matter.&quot;

&gt;&gt; However, the references are primarily to the electric
&gt;&gt; and magnetic fields of Maxwell's equations.

&gt; It was stated as being the field equations of general relativity, in a
&gt; book about relativity, with a passing mention of Maxwell.  Look at the
&gt; original quote in section 5, where he applies &quot;field&quot; to &quot;space&quot;.

Still no problem, &quot;field&quot; is an attribute of space
just as colour might be an attribute of matter.
Without space, you cannot have a field. Again I
think that is perfectly clear from the quote you
provided:

the first quarter of the nineteenth it was

There is a connection but that doesn't mean they
are synonomous. &quot;Field&quot; is an attribute of &quot;space&quot;
and matter exists as discrete entities within that
space. Those entities can affect the value of the
field and all of them together constitute the
universe. What is so hard about that David, you

Typical examples of stress/energy are the pressure
in a fluid and mass respectively. The name of &quot;that

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The GR model is quite clear on the matter though,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ripples can progress through the metric without
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the need for matter other than the source:

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; There you go again... &quot;without the need&quot;.  Maybe
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; English is just too imprecise.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it is quite precise, a single accelerating
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mass can generate gravitational waves, a single test
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mass at some distance will respond to those and there
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is no _need_ for any other masses in between to
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; propagate the wave.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Is there a Universe that contains those two
&gt;&gt; &gt; masses-of-interest?

&gt;&gt; There is space, and IMHO &quot;universe&quot; is a term denoting
&gt;&gt; all of space and its contents of all forms.

&gt; So the interaction is couched in terms of &quot;The Universe&quot;, and any
&gt; separation between &quot;space&quot; or &quot;spacetime&quot; and &quot;contents&quot; is purely
&gt; arbitrary... and cannot be experimentally disproven either way.  So
&gt; &quot;without the need&quot; only applies to a single philosophy.
">

What are you talking about? Place a brick in a
vacuum, the brick is &quot;contents&quot; and the empty
bit around it is &quot;space&quot;.

The vacuum around the brick doesn't have any
matter in it but it is still able to pass the
ripples we call gravitational waves and that
would still be the case if the brick were
removed.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; And how is it any different if the mass is located in

&gt; &gt;&gt; I am losing why you think that is relevant to what
&gt; &gt;&gt; we are discussing. You said &quot;'Black body radiation'
&gt; &gt;&gt; is information.&quot; but it does not contain information
&gt; &gt;&gt; in the QM sense regardless of the source of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; radiation.

&gt; &gt; OK.  Let's forget the &quot;black body&quot; stuff.
&gt; &gt; How is mass located in the Coal Sack different from
&gt; &gt; mass located in a black hole, from any distance of
&gt; &gt; 100 ly or more?  We can't see anything inside the
&gt; &gt; Coal Sack either (barring improvement in technology).
&gt; &gt; Yes we can go there (eventually), but does quantum
&gt; &gt; mechanics &quot;care&quot; about either situation.

&gt; The matter in the coal sack consistes of particles
&gt; which conserve certain quantites for each individual
&gt; particle. The singularity in the black hole conserves
&gt; the total but the individual information is &quot;lost&quot;, or
&gt; at least locked up in it. The Hawking radiation which
&gt; dissipates the mass is generated at the horizon, far
&gt; from the singularity so cannot carry away information
&gt; to which it has no access.

George, the mechanism of evaporation is &quot;quantum tunneliing&quot;.  The
&quot;point of departure&quot; and the &quot;point of pair creation&quot; are one and the
same for this quantum exchange (all possible speeds, all possible
paths).  There is no problem in information transfer, I suspect only
in describing it mathematically.  As with any quantum &lt;-&gt; classical
mapping.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The standard &quot;information loss problem&quot; AIUI is that

&gt; &gt;&gt; which has a purely thermal spectrum thus carries _no_
&gt; &gt;&gt; information and hence the information is lost. That

&gt; &gt; The particles of which Hawking radiation is comprised

Any quantum event appears entirely random.  Such as self-

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; how being &quot;within an event horizon&quot; is any different.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I am losing why you think that is relevant to what
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; we are discussing. You said &quot;'Black body radiation'
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is information.&quot; but it does not contain information
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in the QM sense regardless of the source of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; radiation.

&gt;&gt; &gt; OK.  Let's forget the &quot;black body&quot; stuff.
&gt;&gt; &gt; How is mass located in the Coal Sack different from
&gt;&gt; &gt; mass located in a black hole, from any distance of
&gt;&gt; &gt; 100 ly or more?  We can't see anything inside the
&gt;&gt; &gt; Coal Sack either (barring improvement in technology).
&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes we can go there (eventually), but does quantum
&gt;&gt; &gt; mechanics &quot;care&quot; about either situation.

&gt;&gt; The matter in the coal sack consistes of particles
&gt;&gt; which conserve certain quantites for each individual
&gt;&gt; particle. The singularity in the black hole conserves
&gt;&gt; the total but the individual information is &quot;lost&quot;, or
&gt;&gt; at least locked up in it. The Hawking radiation which
&gt;&gt; dissipates the mass is generated at the horizon, far
&gt;&gt; from the singularity so cannot carry away information
&gt;&gt; to which it has no access.

&gt; George, the mechanism of evaporation is &quot;quantum tunneliing&quot;.  The
&gt; &quot;point of departure&quot; and the &quot;point of pair creation&quot; are one and the
&gt; same for this quantum exchange (all possible speeds, all possible
&gt; paths).  There is no problem in information transfer, I suspect only
&gt; in describing it mathematically.  As with any quantum &lt;-&gt; classical
&gt; mapping.
">

The tunnelling is close to the horizon which may be a
billion miles from the singularity. The particle which
is created on the inside falls to the singularity but
cannot be created carrying information from it. Pair
creation results in particles which have complimentary
characteristics but those are random.

Anyway, I am only telling you what I think is generally
believed to be the nature of the problem. Whether there
is actually information loss or not is another matter
but your comments about the Coal Sack completely missed
the point.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The standard &quot;information loss problem&quot; AIUI is that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mass falls into the hole carrying with it information.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The hole evaporates giving off only Hawking Radiation
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; which has a purely thermal spectrum thus carries _no_
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; information and hence the information is lost. That
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is the background to the discussion.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The particles of which Hawking radiation is comprised
&gt;&gt; &gt; is *not* limited to photons.  The &quot;thermal energy&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; emission is inclusive of charged (anti)particles, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; collections of photons that are travelling non-parallel
&gt;&gt; &gt; have non-zero rest mass.  From time-of-formation to
&gt;&gt; &gt; time-of-complete-evaporation, over that whole &quot;event&quot;,
&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't see that information is lost.

&gt;&gt; How does the quantum information locked in the
&gt;&gt; singularity end up back in the universe when the
&gt;&gt; Hawking Radiation is generated at the horizon?
&gt;&gt; Whether it is phaotons or not, the numbers are
&gt;&gt; random.

&gt; Any quantum event appears entirely random.  Such as self-
&gt; interference.  Only when a population is surveyed is the &quot;non-
&gt; randomness&quot; revealed.
">

That is irrelevant, tell me how the information
crosses the gap between the singularity where it
resides (if it hasn't been destroyed leaving only
the total) and the horizon where the Hawking
Radiation originates.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; How are &quot;the field&quot; and &quot;the Universe&quot; different, in

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; was responsible for curvature.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I would have to see the context to see which &quot;field&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he meant, I don't know the quote. It may be just a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; question of terminology, I might be using &quot;metric&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; or perhaps the means the &quot;field equations&quot;.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thus Descartes was not so far from the truth
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; when he believe he must exclude the existence
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of an empty space.  The notion indeed appears
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; absurd, as long a physical reality is seen
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; exclusively in ponderable bodies.  It requires the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; idea of the field as the representative of reality,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in combination with the general principle of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; relativity, to show the true kernel of Descartes'
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; idea; there exists no space &quot;empty of field&quot;.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;QUOTE&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ... In accordance with the historical
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; development of the field concept, where no
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; matter was available there could exist no
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; field.  But in the first quarter of the nineteenth
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it was shown the that phenomena of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; interference and motion of light could be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; explained with astonishing clearness when
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; light was regarded as a wave-field,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; completely analogous to the mechanical
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; vibration field in an elastic solid body.  It was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; thus felt necessary to intoduce a field, that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; could also exist in &quot;empty space&quot; in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; absence of ponderable matter.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;END QUOTE... any typos are mine&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ... further in this subsection, he mentions
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;modifiers&quot; to (or flavors of) the field theory...
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Maxwell, aether.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Based on the balance of the text, I think the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; field equations are descriptors of &quot;the field&quot;.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But it is clear to me, &quot;the field&quot; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fundamentally bonded to the &quot;ponderable
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; matter&quot; necessary to, for example, produce
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; diffraction.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks for the detail. I read it in the opposite sense,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it says:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  &quot;It was thus felt necessary to intoduce a field, that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   could also exist in &quot;empty space&quot; in the absence of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   ponderable matter.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; However, the references are primarily to the electric
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and magnetic fields of Maxwell's equations.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It was stated as being the field equations of general
&gt;&gt; &gt; relativity, in a book about relativity, with a passing
&gt;&gt; &gt; mention of Maxwell.  Look at the original quote in
&gt;&gt; &gt; section 5, where he applies &quot;field&quot; to &quot;space&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Still no problem, &quot;field&quot; is an attribute of space
&gt;&gt; just as colour might be an attribute of matter.
&gt;&gt; Without space, you cannot have a field. Again I
&gt;&gt; think that is perfectly clear from the quote you
&gt;&gt; provided:

&gt;&gt;  &quot;In accordance with the historical development
&gt;&gt;   of the field concept, where no matter was
&gt;&gt;   available there could exist no field.  But in
&gt;&gt;   the first quarter of the nineteenth it was
&gt;&gt;   shown the that phenomena of the interference
&gt;&gt;   and motion of light could be explained with
&gt;&gt;   astonishing clearness when light was regarded
&gt;&gt;   as a wave-field, completely analogous to the
&gt;&gt;   mechanical vibration field in an elastic solid
&gt;&gt;   body.  It was thus felt necessary to intoduce
&gt;&gt;   a field, that could also exist in 'empty space'
&gt;&gt;   in the absence of ponderable matter.&quot;

&gt; I contend that field is a property of matter/energy, and spacetime is
&gt; simply the values those &quot;spreadsheet cells&quot; have accumulated.  And we
&gt; can both look at the same quotes, and justify our different
&gt; positions.  So we will agree to disagree. (SWWATD.)

I don't accept that, I don't believe you can
use the statements you quoted to justify your
interpretation, and I believe you are trying
to force your own views onto Einstein unfairly.
You are of course entitled to hold your own
opinion but it is unreasonable to misrepresent
the views of others for your own ends.
