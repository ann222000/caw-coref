Being a long term lurker, and only occasional poster, I find many of the
questions and answers here very illuminating.
The downsides are the same queries being posted every few months, and
people like myself who do a little research, and have then forgotten how
to do a little more after a 2 year break, asking where to start again.
So, my query, is there an online FAQ for this group?
Thanks
Alan.

If your problem is not so much the newsgroup as your own genealogy
then the answer to 'where to start again' is 'where you left off.'

If you need a quick refresher, why not skim through the newbie guide
on Genuki?

But the real question before a re-start is not any kind of 'how'. It
is 'why'? There are many reasons for doing genealogy, and different
reasons lead to different orders of priority for information sources
and search methods. You can't do it all, so you have to choose. That
choice is determined by your personal 'why'.

I ended up last year getting confirmed family in the 1881 census, with a
number of possibles on the 1861 and 71, with one line going back a
little further.
To get any further I needed at least 10 Birth/death or marriage
certificates to confirm/deny who were my ancestors.
I just couldnt afford to do it at the time, both the Ancestry fee, and
certificate fees were beyond me, so I gave my parents the results so far
- they were very glad, and I said I'd carry on when I get a chance.
I've now got the 'urge' again, so will do a little more.

Maybe the link for the FAQ should be published every week or so on the
group?

(yes, I know it can be googled, but it is so much easier having the
reference post there evey week).

No amount of certificates will confirm or deny anything! They are no
statements of fact. They are transcriptions of information given to a
recorder by people whose veracity that recorder could not check. If
the informants lied, the records don't correspond with genetic fact.
You cannot prove the informants didn't lie. You may out of a pile of
certificates get a story 'consistent with', but that doesn't make it
'true'.

It used to be published regularly, and updated each time it was useful
to do so, but it was an entirely voluntary activity by a willing soul.
The point was reached when he decided he couldn't carry on. He gave
fair warning of the cessation of publication. As far as I know, nobody
approached him and offered to take over the task.

Don't forget this newsgroup is a voluntary activity. None of us are in
a position to make a demand, and enforce, that any other of us do any
particular service regularly or even once.

So if you want a thing published weekly the only sure way you've got
of satisfying that demand is to write it and publish it yourself. I
suspect you'd get a lot of flak from the old hands if you did publish
with that frequency. There are still people around who have no
broadband and don't take kindly to repetitious material which costs to
download every time.

I love doing look ups
so just ask if you need help

try and get them all in 1901 first
you can use ancestryfamily free of charge at many public libaries

=================

if you share data you get new contacts

eg from my email:-

&gt;&gt; I know you have helped many people on this list [MON] with your wide
knowledge and  experience, but I didn't expect when reading one of you
e-mails this morning, to have one of our family legends solved (or most
likely solved.)

xxxx   a grandfather, William DOGGETT, was a sergeant in WWI and called
his second son, Mayland, after an officer in the Monmouthshire Regiment.
No-one has ever heard that name before or since.  When I saw the name,
Iltyd Edwin Maitland WATKINS, I believe that  this was the officer.
Both Sgt Doggett and  Capt. Watkins were in the same regiment and were
both involved in the 2nd Battle of Ypres.

Sgt Doggett survived, not only the battle but the war.  However, a
younger brother, Rifleman Frederick DOGGETT and  best friend, Rfn.
Alfred George WILLIAMS, both aged 17, were to lose their lives when a
dugout collapsed on them at Reninghelst in 1915.

So, many thanks for your remembrance posting. &lt;&lt;

which was a rehash of the archived  11/11/11 thread by Charani

(with an interesting example of a spelling variation in a middle name
even if not a relative)

His father is buried  in Usk church yard with my grandfather and as they
were both solicitors I did some disambiguation
those WATKINS  are from Cardiff and mine are from  Abergavenny via
Llanvair / Llanfair Kilgeddin and Usk

next month I am meeting a Raglan Jones cousin found via Genesreunited in Oz
so if short of money consider  that subscription, which has been my best
investment with many shared certificates which would of cost many times
the subscription I paid
(BTW see technical and privacy issues about GRU dealt with in this
groups archives)

============

Organise your reasearch with a tree program and always include sources
which will help you pick up  the threads after a gap

Back up your data file off site on multiple computers and CDs
Save once in the original format and export a gedcom as well

In a few years time you or your descendants  may not have a useable copy
of an old program on a new machine  with a new OS

==========

BTW wills are cheap if you collect the copies yourself from the local
offices of The Probate Service

see http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/1226.htm

Probate is the court’s authority; given to a person or persons to
administer a deceased person’s estate and the document issued by the
Probate Service is ...
www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/wills.htm -

here is no time limit by which a grant must be obtained. A search of the
Probate Calendar [National Index] will reveal whether a grant has
issued. There is a calendar for every year from 1858 up to date. Prior
to 1973, the calendars were in book form but after that they were
recorded on microfiche. Since 1998, the calendar from 1996 onwards is
kept on computer. Entries are made in the calendar in the year in which
the grant issued [which is not necessarily the year in which the
deceased died] and are arranged in alphabetical order by the surname of
the deceased. The amount of information given in the calendars has
changed slightly over the years, but every entry will include the
following details:

* full name and last address
* the date of death
* the type of grant issued
* the Registry at which the grant issued and the date of issue
* the gross value of the estate

The calendars include all grants issued throughout England and Wales.

There is no charge for you to search the calendars yourself. If you need
any help, staff will explain how you can do this.

00000000000000000

&quot;The only place where there is a complete set of calendars [from 1858]
available for public inspection is First Avenue House in London. Most
District Probate Registries have calendars covering at least the last
fifty years.

If you intend to visit a Registry specifically to look at the records,
you are recommended to contact the Registry beforehand [a list of
addresses and telephone numbers appears overleaf] to check what is
available.&quot;

NOT CORRECT

a major set of calendars from 1858 is at Birmingham Central Library

any more anyone?

nonsense
you *need* neither  to do good family history

you do need time to search and make visits to archives

and time for good record keeping on paper
(print out forms from pdf on the net)
or in a program (PAF is free)

and knowledge of what is free on the internet

Collecting  copies of all certificates is just another eccentricity
like twitching or train spotting

Above all make yourself useful to other people
and contribute in exchange for the help you will be given

Your position is nonsense, Hugh.  You need every relevant birth
certificate.  You need every relevant marriage certificate.  How else do
you avoid making stupid mistakes?  Death certificates are, in my view, a
luxury, but they can occasionally be useful in breaking down a brick
wall.  They are still interesting, though.

It was last updated in 1999 and a number of the links are stale.

Perhaps this is something that could be taken over by GENUKI. The
practical advice is more or less covered by existing GENUKI FAQs anyway
so the only thing FAQ they would need to add would be a short and static
one to cover the posting guidelines and charter.

Anecdotal:

My great-aunt's birth certificate is at odds, on day of birth, with
both the inscription in a book given to her by her slightly older
sister twn years later, and her passport.

The marriage certificate of one of my husband's great-aunts gives
occupations to the two fathers that have clearly been swapped when one
compares with their occiupations at censuses.

A  researcher  told me of a birth certificate of a posthumous child,
born 12 months after the husband's death in an area in which the
mother was not living a few months before the birth nor a year or so
after the birth;  the registrar's surname was the same as the mother's
maiden name.

I've had a couple of matches on http://www.lostcousins.com/ - one
I've taken up, the other I'm considering whether an in-law
relationship to a possible distant cousin is worth the subscription.

The FAQ says &quot;The median number of relatives entered by members who
have found at least one 'lost cousin' is 63, which means that half of
them have entered less than 63 relatives, and the other half have
entered more than 63.&quot;    Which, unstatistically, &quot;fits&quot; my own
experience in that my first match was with one of the first five
names, and the second as my number of names reached about 130.

It is possible to remove names if one later finds they weren't
ancestors / cousins etc.

Even if the other researcher knows no more than oneself, one can share
part of the hunt.

well I knew at least three people who were alive in 1881 (they died in
the 1950ies) so I started wiht that census
and have the birthday books of two deceased family members

as long as you can get to 1901 you can get to 1837 fairly well

I am perfectly happy with district, year and  quarter from freeBMD
rather than an exact birthdate

then people keep finding me and sharing data
Wills and Admons have dates of death from 1858

of course  unusual names, known occupations and / or  background in
small browsable welsh villages helps

I got some  Bristol marriages but am perfectly happy to rest  a line and
persue our hobby in other ways  ( transribing, web pages, one-name
studies, doing the SKS)

No hurry to get back as far as possible
the records are not going anywhere and are becoming more and more
accessible from my home or local libraries

finally scanned an old negative and published it

I am also still very much a beginner

I have neither learned nor needed to learn Chancery Hand for example and
my latin is exceedingly rusty

the most important family history to record is the memories of the
living -  including our own

Now you do need certificates for genealogy but that, at its worst,  is
like train spotting

I'm new to this stuff (but learning fast), but I'd like to add my
twopennyworth.... I think *all* evidence is important (incl. certificates),
but it should all be treated as such, i.e. 'evidence' rather than 'proof'.

Amongst the many mysteries in my own family, I was recently trying to
identify the parents of a Rebecca Jesson (nee Watts), married in Nottingham
in 1894. I've seen others quote exact birth dates for her, and say she was
born in Nottingham itself. However, there's no such birth record in the GRO
index, and their data fails to cite their sources. I've looked through
census records (recent-to-old) and have found her mother's name
mis-transcribed in 1891 as &quot;Emma Walls&quot; instead of &quot;Watts&quot;...then they
disappear. I'm actually having to look at &quot;possible&quot; birth certificates just
to rule out some pathways. In other words, birth certs may not be able to
prove anything but they can disprove things.

I work by comparison with census and other sources

I prefer to use parochial records whenever possible when I can afford a
trip to Bristol or Wales

the danish records are all freebies up to 1892 soon to 1925
so why bother doing the other stuff if it is expensive

We each have to do things our own way. It will be a very frosty Friday
before I follow your advice such as not bothering with certificates,
which is probably the single worst piece of advice I've seen on this NG.

Nor do I share your apparently almost unbridled enthusiasm for Ancestry

genealogy, and, if I did, I wouldn't consider this NG the appropriate

He had written three: General, Census, and What is the IGI?.  These he
regularly updated, and if you used a newreader such as Agent, they
could be 'Kept' permanently on your s.g.b. page.

Mine are still there, with the thread last updated on 14/10/2005.

Unfortunately Barry departed this group after a spat with someone who

&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope you've realised since then that you don't need Ancestry
&gt; &gt; &gt; although you do need certificates.

&gt; &gt; nonsense
&gt; &gt; you *need* neither  to do good family history

&gt; Your position is nonsense, Hugh.  You need every relevant birth
&gt; certificate.  You need every relevant marriage certificate.  How else do
&gt; you avoid making stupid mistakes?  Death certificates are, in my view, a
&gt; luxury, but they can occasionally be useful in breaking down a brick
&gt; wall.  They are still interesting, though.
">

I'm not prone to foolish assumptions in my genealogical research,
being careful to think of things in terms of &quot;balance of
probabilities&quot;; but even I tripped myself up once because of not
getting a certificate.

A relative died in her twenties after only a few short years of
marriage; she died at a major London hospital (despite living
elsewhere in the country) as a result of gynaecological problems.  Her
maiden surname was extremely unusual for her county of birth, and her
husband's surname was also fairly distinctive.  No other married
couples with the same surname and of child-bearing age were living in
their town at the same time.

When I found index entries for exactly one birth, and later also an
infant death, in that same town, and which were during the right
period of time for &quot;my&quot; couple, it was all too obvious what had
happened: the pregnancy or birth had been a difficult one, the child
had struggled on for a few months and died as a result, while the
mother would continue to suffer complications that would see her sent
to London for the best specialist treatment in the land, only for her
to die as well.  Naturally the child's certificates were on my &quot;to do&quot;
list, but weren't a priority due to this being a cut and dried case.
The timing of the marriage, birth, and deaths was such that the census
records were of no use.

Of course you can all see what's coming: I got the birth certificate
and discovered that I'd made a right howler!  The child was born to an
unwed cousin of the husband's, a teenaged barmaid.  There's no
evidence at all that &quot;my&quot; couple ever did have a child, and I'd
foolishly turned a sad death into an even more devastating tragedy for
the husband left behind.

A different story for you, albeit not one resulting from any
genealogical research: it was no secret in my family that my maternal
grandmother was born out of wedlock, with of course no father's name
on either the birth or baptismal certificates.  Only after her death
(she lived into her 90s) did my mother stumble across her marriage
certificate, upon which she was shocked to find my grandmother's
father's name.  As a result, it appears that we have an entirely
unexpected Irish ancestry, although there is naturally a possibility
that the name is not *really* who her father was (but then the same
can apply to names on birth certificates).

I'm now even more careful with my assumptions (we all still have to
make them, of course), and conjectural relationships that don't have
secondary evidence to support them are now always clearly marked as
such when I update my family tree and the records behind it.

Not everyone can download headers only (do you mean Subject Lines?  The
headers are sometimes longer than the message!)

I can't for instance, pick and choose which messages to download.
Although I now have broadband I still get my newsgroup messages from the
Arcade Bulletin Board as it's so much easier than messing about with the
internet.  Luckily the call is free now that I'm with TalkTalk so there
is no cost involved.  Downloading never takes more than about one minute
anyway, then I use an off-line reader.  (This makes a nonsense of these
'Click on this URL' messages!)

Unfortunately the dog will hunt. There are parts of the world
broadband has not reached and where people have a choice of dial-up or
nothing. And in those parts there are people who are *not* 'computer
savvy', and moreover don't want to be computer savvy.

There is no more reason to require computer users to be 'savvy' than
there is to require nobody to drive a car unless they can explain in
detail the free-radical branching chain reactions which happen in
petrol/air mixtures of appropriate composition when an spark passes
through. Most people are quite happy to get in the car and go from A
to B.

It is long long overdue that those who claim that anything can be done
by tweaking the machine, its programs, or its method of use - with the
aid of enough savvy - realised that they are a tiny minority of
computer users.

In particular, old folk living in the country and passing their time
with doing genealogy and emailing the kids and grandkids, do not need
to be computer system maintenance engineers and programmers. And these
people get in knots when some nitwit sends a set of uncompressed
graphics. You try downloading 10 graphics of a megabyte or more each
when you are on a 16k nominal line, actual 4-5k, and are paying by the
second. It still happens, believe it or not, in places no more than 4
miles from my address.

I have broadband and fast computers. I also have the manners to
realise that others don't have, and can't have, the same.

Well said Don. I currently live in Ireland, although I'm from the UK. For
reasons of money (as usual), and company politics (as usual), and the fact
that much of Ireland is still very rural, broadband has a low coverage here.
The best I can get is an ISDN (64k). I happen to be a computer professional
but that doesn't help one bit in this area.

I just love it when someone sends me a 12Mb picture of their dog, and
Outlook Express immediately tries to download it. Or, as a friend from the
US once did, sends me 6 copies of the same 10Mb photo. Arhhh!

Feel free to revise and update the FAQs that I used to post. The
Census one was always the most difficult to keep up to date, however,
now that Stepping Stones has been taken over and ACDB are no longer
operating, it should be an easier task.

Feel free to copy the HTML from my pages and then update, as it would
be unwise to point directly to my pages as someone else suggested,
because I may at some point change ISP, and they would eventually be
lost.

All I would ask is that you acknowledge that they are updates of my
original works.

It sounds like you are running Outlook Express with the preview window
open. There is a risk in doing that as it allows hidden virus programs to
launch themselves without the need of the user activating the file
intentionally. At least that is how Windows worked back when I was using
it at a place of employment. I no longer use Outlook Express for email so
am not sure if this example of yet another security risk in a Microsoft
product has been fixed. My recommendation is to review the directory of
new messages in a separate window and delete anything that's dodgy.

Well I tend to agree.
A short, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly post pointing to the FAQ would be
beneficial.
Just 4 lines would suffice - something like:
'The FAQ for this group can be found at:
http://.......
Further information on geneaology related to this group can also be
found at:
http://,......'

Even for the bandwidth pikeys, 4 lines of text once a week would not
warrant a meltdown in their 14kb modem line.

If anyone would like to update the FAQ, then I'll gladly host it on my
own web space if need be.

For anyone new to this addiction the best advice one can give them is to go
to

http://www.genuki.org.uk/contents/

http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/faq.html

rather than berate them for not having done their homework first as some
delight in doing here.

FAQs are of immense value, but with a constant change in what is available
updating becomes an issue for the compilers.

I note that the FAQ at GENUKI was last updated Aug 2006.

&quot;Outlook Express&quot;, which upon start-up does a 'mail run' to the configured
mail servers and fetches all new mail bodies.

Original, web-mail had the advantages of only downloading mail bodies if you
saw fit (hence better for slow lines), and central storage for your mail
(useful if you use multiple PCs), and a &quot;mobile&quot; account (useful if you
travel a lot without a laptop). However, most web-mail products are now so
&quot;heavy&quot; in their downloading of static/moving images, script code, etc.,
that they're no longer the panacea they were for slow lines.

Actually this same fault applies to most of the Web these days. As an
example, I foolishly dialled through my mobile (cell-) phone in order to
top-up my credit via the provider's web site. Their site was horrendously
slow, and I could see my remaining credit ebbing away. In the end I
cancelled it and simply rang them up. Bang! All solved!  :-)

I don't think that Outlook Express downloads all new mail bodies
immediately.  It downloads headers, processes the message rules and then
downloads the bodies.  (I can watch it download several hundred headers
when I start it in the morning.  It does not hang when there is a large
message body.)  It is easy enough to create a message rule using &quot;where
the message size is more than&quot; and &quot;delete it from server&quot; to ensure
that large emails are not a problem.

Ironically, when I tried Thunderbird a few years ago, it was its
inability (at that time) to download headers only (along with a few
other problems) that pushed me back to OE, with which, despite the
purists' objections, I am quite happy (and virus-free).
