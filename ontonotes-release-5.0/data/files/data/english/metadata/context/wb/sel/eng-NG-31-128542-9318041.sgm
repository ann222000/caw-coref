Advertising - Google Adsense, for wee bits of traffic (Microsoft and
Yahoo ad services - I forget their names!).  Also the beloved
advertising on Facebook.

A blog (in general), kinda covered, but not really :)

I don't have an answer... other to say that I find this sort of thing
incredibly interesting - this is what I was on about last week when I
expressed my ire that someone on MySpace had nicked one of my names.

For certain industries I can see this scenario where The Day of the
Website is at an end (the sun is setting etc)... and what's required is
(if at all) a single central application, and a surrounding web of
social-networking presences.

I think I'd possibly add a couple of the DIY merchandising sites to the
just-in-case list as well - cafepress, spreadshirt. (which I've just
noticed can be accidently spelled &quot;spreadshit&quot;)

It's a fuck of a lot of work keeping all of these presences going though.

I hacked together this for Spreadshirt a while back and it took about a
week http://www.weirdsky.com . In the last two months it's made about 4
euros.

And to regurgitate the essence of my previous rant... I wish tae fuck
there was a single login / registration for all of these.

Now remember the cheap online Asda Beer.. approx a month back..? ended up
being too good to be true..

This isnt quite such an attractive an offer, and again must be a mistake.
Correct me if I am wrong.. a good bargain.

The only difference here is.. these are being dispatched.

I have just had 2x of these items delivered at the list price, along with my
other Tesco online shopping:

2 Prime Tuna Steaks (come frozen and sealed). although not listed as Prime
on the website.. the packaging clearly states it..

sushi time?    59p ... yum!

I wouldn't make sushi out of frozen fish. The reason why it's so cheap is
that it's frozen, not as good quality as fresh tuna steak.

Really? In the UK, can you get tuna that that has never been frozen? I
shudder to think of the CO2 from the supersonic flight required to get
fish caught in the Indian Ocean to Gatwick before it goes mankey.

Is the stuff from the fish market just [on ice and shipped in super

Interesting.

Unless fish has been caught on a day boat, ie a boat that goes out
fishes, markets and sells locally, its been frozen.  How do you reckon
the trawlers that go out for 5-6 days manage?   it gets iced straight
away.   Talk about carbon footprint, I've got a client who's a fish
wholesaler.  The cod he supplies has been caught in the north
atlantic, sure, but gutted and frozen on board, back to port, sold and
then shipped to CHINA for packaging (partial defrost of the pallets of
fish, stick em in boxes, freeze em again) the shipped back to his
Polish supplier, then  to the UK, off to the restaurants.  Fresh fish
anyone?  It's a fine line between &quot;chilled&quot;  and errr, &quot;frozen solid&quot;
That tuna's been caught in a hot country, hung around on a boat for
(at least) a day, back to port, been to market, packed, shipped,
wholesaled, retailed, bought by you.  It's been frozen,(probaly on the
boat it was caught on) and be glad it has!
Best fish I've had is from that little stall on the beach in hove
behind the bowling club.    One day all he had left was grey mullet,
whatever, I thought, never tried it, possibly the most unappetisingly
named fish in this country.  It was deeelicious.

So I guess tinned tuna (probably tinned on the quayside?) is the least
harmful carbon-wise? And another recommendation - Fish, by McCartney
house in the basin by Hovel agoon. Lots (but not all) the catch is from
the boats tied up there. Even live crabs, which is possibly the only
time you can leave a shop with your carrier bag moving of its own
accord. I defy you to drive it home without being griped by the fear
that it will leap out and pincer your face clean off.
