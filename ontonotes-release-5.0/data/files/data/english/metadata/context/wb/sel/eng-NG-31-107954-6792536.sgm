Hi all,

Just a quick question.

My pretty little Orbea Enol is running an 8-spd Sora groupset. Except
for the crankset, which is a dodgy Shimano 2200-series jobby. It
sucks....  *laughs*

Anyway, I have spotted some cool 9-spd Dura-Ace & Ultegra double
cranksets (octalink BB) on Ebay!! So the obvious question is - will I
be able to run the combo of an 8sp Shimano chain with one of these '9-
spd' cranksets????

Oh, and before you say it - I am already saving up hard for the BIG
upgrade, but that is some way off - so a little-bitty upgrade will
have to do in the meantime...  :D

Thanks in advance!!
Abby
