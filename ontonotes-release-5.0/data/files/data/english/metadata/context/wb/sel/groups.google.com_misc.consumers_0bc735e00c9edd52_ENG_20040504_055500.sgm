A Wall Street Journal reporter dumped $87.26 into coin counters
operated by Commerce Bank and Coinstar. The Coinstar machine was off
by 57 cents, and Commerce Bank was off by $7.02 - both in favor of the
machines. He tried it again with $68.23 - Commerce Bank was off by 82
cents and Coinstar by 14 cents, again in favor of the machines.

Coinstar says &quot;For disputes under $15, the stores will typically
refund on the spot.&quot;

"/> I used to work at my local supermarket and they have a coinstar machine in it
and you're right. I don't remember any of them disputing the amount they just
wanted the cash! The only problems that I ever saw were when the machine got
the coins stuck - I remember the manager saying that he was going the whole
machine out the window! LOL!

You don't -- you're guessing. Since you don't check the count
yourself, you have no way to know whether your bank's machine is
more accurate or less accurate than any other machine.

You have apparently decided that the time saving is worth more to
you than any amount you might be shorted. No one can argue with that
because you set your own priorities.

On the other hand, if you didn't accumulate a whole bunch of coins
in the first place, you'd have a net savings in time _and_ accuracy
of machines would no longer be a concern.

me that the amount tended was different than the amount requested.
Fortunately, the bank was open so I just gave it back. (The teller

It's perfectly realistic to expect a commercial coin counting machine
to be perfect - with proper maintenance, of course. I doubt that
Coinstar really cares - just as long as they take in more money than
they dispense.

Maybe a sanity test. The fact is- THE DAMN THINGS AREN'T ACCURATE AND
RELIABLE. If the gas tank fuel gauge on your car was as accurate as
those machines- you would have been stranded on a country road 10
times in the last month! The fact is- those machines often take your
coins (US and Canadian) and DON'T tally them on the screen. You'd
think that they could make the electronics in those machines work so
that as soon a the reject scanner ACCEPTS a coin- it would REGISTER
IT! The machines NEVER reject a coin and give you credit for it! Isn't
it odd that they can do the later but can't correct the former? There
is a serious design flaw, loose wire or whatever that does not
co-ordinate the manual accept-reject mechanism with the electonic
screen tabulator.

Most normal cashiers know how to accept Canadian coins for payment.
Most normal cashiers don't keep handing you back your dollar bills as
&quot;unacceptable&quot;

Do you sell these machines or have some business interest in them?

I've notified the Michigan Attorney General about the un-reliability
of these machines- but they've done nothing. You'd think it would come
under the law which awards penalties to customers when the code
scanner system fails at the manned checkouts. They give you FIVE TIMES
the overcharge!

"/> Actually, I did. A few years ago, I withdrew something like $60 from an
ATM in Philadelphia. It was the kind where you lift a door to remove the
cash from a pocket in the machine; sort of like a glove box in a car. I
accidentally brushed my hand against the far end of the pocket and I
noticed that in addition to the money I had deposited, there were
several $20 bills that were partially ejected into the pocket.

I admit it was not honest, but I took those $20. I think it was two or
three extra bills so it was not a large amount of money. I have also
had casino coin counting machines count incorrectly. I know this for a
fact. i put $20 in a slot machine at the Luxor in Las Vegas a few years
ago. I played only about three or four rounds of a quarter each at
that machine, but I lost each time. I am a skittish gambler and I
had to meet some friends at another casino in a few minutes so I cashed
out (it wasn't one of those coinless machines), and I dumped the
coins in a coin counter. I knew exactly how many quarters the machine
dispensed because it displays the amount on the front of the screen
and I have a habit of counting the &quot;ping&quot; sounds when each coin hits
the output tray. The coin counter maching shorted me a dollar or two.
I looked around but there were no casino employees around at the time
and the nearest live coun counter area was packed with people waiting
to count their coins so I just left the casino.

No machine is 100% error free. None. And that includes those that are
operated by casinos and banks.

&gt; Do you sell these machines or have some business interest in them?

&gt; I've notified the Michigan Attorney General about the un-reliability
&gt; of these machines- but they've done nothing. You'd think it would come
&gt; under the law which awards penalties to customers when the code

"/> Good luck... but maybe they've ignored you because you are the
only one complaining. I speak to lots of people who use these
things and no one has reported the problems you have.

Unrealistic? Banks, grocery stores, big box stores, vending
machine distributors, and similar businesses depend very much
on the accuracy of those machines. And properly adjusted, they
are very accurate. Imagine how much money would be at stake
if a casino's daily count was a couple percent off.

&gt; True, but when you think about it, it is unrealistic to expect any
&gt; machine to work perfectly. I use the coint counter at a Commerce
&gt; Bank near where I live to count my coins maybe three times a year.
&gt; I tend to accumulate about $300 - $400 in coins and it all goes into
&gt; a vacation savings account I have at Commerce Bank. I would like to
&gt; think that my coins are counted accurately each time I go there, but
&gt; that is unrealistic since nothing is perfect and I am not about to
&gt; sit and pre-count that much coinage so I guess I might be paying a
&gt; small fee to have my coins counted, but it still is less costly than
&gt; those Coinstar machines.

The extra bills in the ATM don't sound like they came out with
yours. Maybe somebody else accidentally left them behind.

You should have reported the inaccurate slot machine. They are
far more reliable than you apparently believe, and a malfunctioning
one is a risk to the operator and to the customers. Or maybe you
miscounted. I used to repair and maintain arcade and gambling
machines, and never ran into one, even antiques from the early
1900's, that couldn't be adjusted for perfect accuracy.

&gt;&gt; I've never seen the coin counting machines at casinos fail to give the
&gt;&gt; proper count. Nor have I ever had an ATM machine miscount bills when
&gt;&gt; dispensing money. Machines fail, but it is pretty easy to design them so
&gt;&gt; the failure stops the operation rather than completing it incorrectly.

&gt; Actually, I did. A few years ago, I withdrew something like $60 from an
&gt; ATM in Philadelphia. It was the kind where you lift a door to remove the
&gt; cash from a pocket in the machine; sort of like a glove box in a car. I
&gt; accidentally brushed my hand against the far end of the pocket and I
&gt; noticed that in addition to the money I had deposited, there were
&gt; several $20 bills that were partially ejected into the pocket.

&gt; I admit it was not honest, but I took those $20. I think it was two or
&gt; three extra bills so it was not a large amount of money. I have also
&gt; had casino coin counting machines count incorrectly. I know this for a
&gt; fact. i put $20 in a slot machine at the Luxor in Las Vegas a few years
&gt; ago. I played only about three or four rounds of a quarter each at
&gt; that machine, but I lost each time. I am a skittish gambler and I
&gt; had to meet some friends at another casino in a few minutes so I cashed
&gt; out (it wasn't one of those coinless machines), and I dumped the
&gt; coins in a coin counter. I knew exactly how many quarters the machine
&gt; dispensed because it displays the amount on the front of the screen
&gt; and I have a habit of counting the &quot;ping&quot; sounds when each coin hits
&gt; the output tray. The coin counter maching shorted me a dollar or two.
&gt; I looked around but there were no casino employees around at the time
&gt; and the nearest live coun counter area was packed with people waiting
&gt; to count their coins so I just left the casino.

&gt; No machine is 100% error free. None. And that includes those that are
&gt; operated by casinos and banks.

As I said, I found a coin counting machine at a casino that did
miscount my coins, but it miscounted in the casino's favor and
were I not in a hurry and the miscount fairly minor, I would have
complained right than and there.

"/> No, the extra bills were partially ejected from a thin slot that
was hidden from view of people who used that old ATM. I just happened
to feel the bills with my fingers and it took almost no pressure at
all to remove the partially ejected $20s from the machine.

"/> I know what I see. You are right though, I should have reported the
problem, but I simply didn't have time and the $2 error on the machine's
part wasn't worth my being late for a dinner reservation. I absolutely
did not miscount. If a miscount was done, it was on the part of the slot
machine that ejected my coins when I cashed out on it. I knew exactly
how many coins were in my coin bucket because I only played the one
slot machine for a few minutes, I knew from the slot machine's display
how many coins were still unused out of the $20 bill i put in, and I
counted the tink sounds when the coins were ejected, as I usually do.
It was definitely the coin counting machine that was in error.

I work with technology every day. Even systems that my employer has
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars are not perfect. Nothing made
by mankind if perfect. There are errors in everything. I do agree
that the errors in coin counting machines are very unusual, but to say
that any machine works 100% accurately 100% of the time is unrealistic
since all machines are made by flawed individuals and maintained by
flawed individuals.
