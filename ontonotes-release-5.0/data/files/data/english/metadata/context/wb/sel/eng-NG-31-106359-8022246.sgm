This woman is doing squats in a different way.  Is this not
recommended as it is bad for your back?

She's doing sumo deadlifts, not squats...

That is THE most bizarre squat I have ever seen.  Could it be a &quot;deadlift?&quot;

Yeah, but, what about that weird biceps curl at the end of the vidoe?

Wonder if she used to look like a woman?

Those are better. On the youtube one, she looks like a patient of Chris
Benoit's doctor.

See? Regardless of how often you sic KING on me, you'll always be my
hero. Classic.

At first, I thought it was Czech of Slovak in honor of Katka (the girl
in the vidoe, er, video).

I could barely see her face on the YouTube blurry postage stamp so I
went searching courtesy of Google.

Evil!

In the video? I think she's built similar to Sharon Marvel. Hominah,
hominah! But, yeah, can't see her face especially well.

I don't remember...I remember one arm rows with a lot of back twisting
at the end of the set...is that how they're meant to be done? I haven't
revisited them since I was attacked and the thoracic spinal damage made
them painful.

Looks pretty hot to me (checks over his shoulder to make sure his wife
isn't standing there with his five month old).

Nah, it's an ultra low bar squat ;)
