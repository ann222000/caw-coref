Last year, I mailed a number of comics across the ocean for a decent
price.  Sure, it was slow, but the buyer didn't want to pay the $28 or so
for quick delivery.  Cost was more important.

Today I was looking into shipping some comics to England, and I don't even
see the inexpensive surface mail.

It now appears that folks are being forced to use the much more expensive
airmail options to ship internationally.

Are there really no longer any options for shipping using an actual ship?

The cost is often 40 to 50% less, compared to air transport.  Without the
cost savings, I guess I won't be able to consider selling internationally
any more.  Nobody wants to pay $1.50 per comic for shipping.

Were they really subsidized?  After all, shipping on a boat SHOULD be a
lot cheaper.  The boat is shipping hundreds of times more volume per amount
of fuel spent.  Yes, it is slow, but is also much more efficient.  If it
isn't more costly to fly, then why don't all of those cheap Chinese imports
get flown over here?  They come by boat, because it is much cheaper.

I'm thinking that the U.S. postal service didn't get rid of those sea
routes because they were losing money, or because they were subsidized.  I
believe they got rid of the inexpensive route as a way to force people to
use their more expensive and profitable routes.  After all, if it's the only
option offered, then they make a whole lot of money - environment be damned,
evidently.

Makes it impossible for people like me to use the more environmentally
friendly, inexpensive method.  We may have free trade agreements, but now
they are more for the huge corporations, and not for the common man.

A couple of years ago, I shipped a batch of comics out using surface mail
to Australia.  Today I was considering the possibility of selling the batch
of comics I get each month (24) to someone in Europe.  I decided that before
seriously going after the idea, I should look up how much shipping would
cost.  I figured that I would be able to find some sort of surface mail
route that would be about half the airmail cost, as I had in the past.  I
was wrong.

What I found was a choice between paying $29.60 for &quot;first class
international&quot; (no specified delivery time, and no tracking) and $30.40 for
&quot;Priority Mail International&quot;, which has a 6 to 10 day delivery time, and
had tracking.  This is for a 4 pound package of 24 comic books.  That means
that shipping from here to England - 3,923 miles - would be $1.25 per comic.

To put this in perspective, I could mail the same box using Media Mail
from Miami, Florida to Anchorage, Alaska for only 3 dollars and 35 cents.
That includes delivery confirmation.  And yes, that route takes them 3,981
miles total, and either through 2 countries, or else in a ship across the
ocean.  So the distances are almost exactly the same.

Now I realize that shipping to Alaska is subsidized.  It is part of our
empire, of course, and the government wants to facilitate communication and
exchange of goods between the various states.  I expected oceangoing mail to
a foreign country to cost on the order of 4 or 5 times as much - about $15.

What I can't believe is that it is instead a 10X order of magnitude.  Ten
times as much to mail it the same distance!  All because I guess now we are
forced to use airmail, whether we want to or not?

I do not support airmail.  Sure, it is fast, but it is also a very
polluting and inefficient way to get things from place to place.  You have
to expend fuel negating the force of gravity the whole way.  A ship
overcomes gravity naturally, just because it weighs less than the water it
displaces.  Ships also use Diesel fuel, which has 40% more energy per
gallon, and thereby pollutes less per mile travelled.  Of course, the
environmental impact is only the lesser part of my frustration.

The biggest part is that I can't imagine finding anyone willing to pay the
roughly $1.25 per comic for shipping.  Shipping within the U.S. is only 13c
each.  Limiting me to airmail effectively forces me to pass along this much,
much higher cost of shipping to any potential international buyer.  I
usually get about 75c to a dollar each for my used comics.  Adding shipping
in the U.S. costs a buyer another 13% or so.  Adding shipping
internationally now costs a buyer an extra 125%!  In practice, I think it
means that nobody internationally is going to spend even a second
considering buying my monthly batch of comics.  It really stinks, because it
limits my resale market.

Are there no longer any options to use an actual ship for shipping these
days?

Any plane delivering mail would have jet engines.  Jet fuel is a less
refined version of diesel.  Jet fuel can be used in most diesel engines.

A ship is certainly more efficient than a plane, but not simply because
they use diesel fuel.  A lot of ships actually use fuel oil and a fairly
thick fuel oil at that.

This is kinda like when I asked UPS about ground shipping to Hawaii and
they basically laughed at me.  I assumed they could use a ship to do
ground shipments, but no, they only offer air shipping to Hawaii.

Sure, but it is a well orchestrated process with frequent use. I would
bet that the amount of mail traveling by boat is almost nil so there is
no economy of scale.

Media mail is perfectly legal for comics.  I don't know why some people
think it isn't.  Note that the restriction &quot;can not contain advertising&quot;
means that it can not be items with the exclusive intention to be used as
advertising, such as fliers, etc.  This does NOT mean you can't ship a book
with an ad in it, or a magazine with one of those fall-out renewal notices.

From the USPS website:

Media Mail
Formerly (and colloquially, still) known as &quot;Book Rate&quot;, Media Mail is used
to send books, printed materials, sound recordings, videotapes, CD-ROMs,
diskettes, and similar, but cannot contain advertising. Maximum weight is 70
pounds (31.75 kg).

a.. Delivery standards are 5-9 business days
b.. Rates based on weight
c.. Much cheaper than Parcel Post, and roughly the same transit time from
point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;
d.. Postage can be paid using any method except precanceled stamps

Bound Printed Matter
Same as Media Mail but it is used to mail permanently-bound sheets of
advertising, promotional, directory or editorial material such as catalogs
and phonebooks. It may be slightly cheaper than Media Mail rates.
Observations:

a.. Package can weigh up to 15 lb.
b.. Sheets must be permanently-bound by secure fastenings such as staples,
spiral binding, glue or stitching.
c.. At least 90% of the sheets must be imprinted by any process other than
handwriting or typewriting.
d.. Mail must be marked &quot;return service requested&quot; to receive
undeliverable back. Mail without this marking will be disposed of.
e.. Postage may be applied by PC postage, permit imprint, or stamps, but
cannot be bought at a retail counter, effective May 14, 2007.

I would prefer to use Bound Printed Matter rate instead of Media Mail,
since it is more specific to what I am sending.  However, Paypal's online
shipping service does not offer it as an option.  As such, I and the
thousands of others who ship magazines, books, comics, etc. online using
Paypal's free online postage shipping must choose Media Mail as an
all-in-one choice for written or recorded media of any kind.

Realize, however, that just because there is one item that could be
construed as advertising inside an item does not mean the same as saying you
are shipping advertising related materials.  This distinction merely ensures
that Media Mail is not being used to subsidize the shipping of advertising
materials such as signs and posters by large companies.

We ordered a book from Nepal once, sent surface mail.  It took five months.

Remember when you had to pay extra for air mail for regular letters?
You don't?  Oh, well, now I feel old. :-)  (It was 1973, by the way.)

Comic books typically have more than incidental advertising.

&quot; Media Mail® service is a cost efficient way to mail books, sound
recordings, recorded video tapes, printed music, and recorded
computer-readable media (such as CDs, DVDs, and diskettes). Media Mail
can not contain advertising except for incidental announcements of books.&quot;

&quot;Bound Printed Matter is material that consists of advertising,
promotional, directory, or editorial material that is securely bound
(not loose-leaf binders), consists of sheets of which at least 90
percent are imprinted by a process other than handwriting or
typewriting, contains no personal correspondence and is not stationery
(such as pads of blank printed forms).&quot;

&gt;   Were they really subsidized?  After all, shipping on a boat SHOULD be a
&gt; lot cheaper.  The boat is shipping hundreds of times more volume per
amount
&gt; of fuel spent.  Yes, it is slow, but is also much more efficient.  If it
&gt; isn't more costly to fly, then why don't all of those cheap Chinese
imports
&gt; get flown over here?  They come by boat, because it is much cheaper.

&gt;   I'm thinking that the U.S. postal service didn't get rid of those sea
&gt; routes because they were losing money, or because they were subsidized.  I
&gt; believe they got rid of the inexpensive route as a way to force people to
&gt; use their more expensive and profitable routes.  After all, if it's the
only
&gt; option offered, then they make a whole lot of money - environment be
damned,
&gt; evidently.

&gt;   Makes it impossible for people like me to use the more environmentally
&gt; friendly, inexpensive method.  We may have free trade agreements, but now
&gt; they are more for the huge corporations, and not for the common man.
">

The thing here is, you don't know what the actual cost (as opposed to the
rate you were charged) was, or whether or not there was a subsidy.  And
neither do I.  But you are imagining things, and then treating your
imaginations as though they were fact.

I can easily imagine that if you can fill up a sizeable fraction of a cargo
container vessel, it's cheaper to ship things by boat.  I can also imagine
that a pile of comic books bought by an individual might measure a couple of
feet high, and such a small package could easily be lost in the shuffle.  I
also imagine that the container vessels that ply the China/US trade routes
do so across the Pacific, and don't come anywhere near England, and that
whatever the cost of shipping something by boat between Asia and North
America, it has little or nothing to do with the cost of shipping between
North America and Europe.

I notice there are shipping companies that will charge around $200 to ship
30 kg from the US to England.  I don't know what a comic book weighs, but
assuming 1 ounce apiece, that works out to around roughly 1,000 comic books,
less packaging.  Very roughly 20 cents each.

&gt;   Media mail is perfectly legal for comics.  I don't know why some people

&gt; means that it can not be items with the exclusive intention to be used as

&gt;   From the USPS website:

&gt; Media Mail
&gt; Formerly (and colloquially, still) known as &quot;Book Rate&quot;, Media Mail is used

It sounds like you going to convince  yourself of whatever suits you,
but again, media mail cannot contain any advertising other then book
annoucements, USPS is clear about this, here is a more descriptive
rule of media mail and advertising

..............
Content Standards
Only these items may be mailed at the Media Mail rates:

a. Books, including books issued to supplement other books, of at
least eight printed pages, consisting wholly of reading matter or
scholarly bibliography, or reading matter with incidental blank spaces
for notations and containing no advertising matter other than
incidental announcements of books. Advertising includes paid
advertising and the publishers' own advertising in display,
classified, or editorial style.

Bingo.  I talked to my friendly neighborhood postal clerk, and was told
that for comic books, I could send them either Media Mail or boung printed
matter.

I was told, however, that if I was shipping anything that was in the
majority *advertising*, then it would have to be media mail.

I think realistically, they realize now that loads of things *INCLUDE*
advertising, but are not advertising.  Get the difference?  I guess it could
be vague to some people, so here goes:

A flier advertising Dan Quayle for president would be advertising

A comic book that happened to have an ad inside would NOT be advertising,
even though it likely includes it.

For your information, the PO does spot check media mail contents because they have many guys mailing loads
of non media items as media mail.  Ever notice the stamp the PO typically applies to media mail concerning the PO's right to inspect items shipped as media?

I'm surprised you don't read comic books considering your 4th-grade grammatical skills.

Some comics contain advertising.  Others don't.  Some contain advertising

But anyway, the difference is really moot.

If you want delivery confirmation and need to ship from home,  (as I do,
since I'm a stay-at-home Dad with two toddlers) your only choice without
paying ridiculous fees is to ship through Paypal.  That means that when time
isn't an issue, you are unable to choose Bound Printed Matter even if you
want to.

Take it up with Paypal and the U.S. Postal Service if you want - I'm sure
they discussed this before setting it up that way.  My guess is that the
USPS doesn't have a problem with it - otherwise, it wouldn't be that way.

&gt;&gt;&gt; descriptive rule of media &gt;mail and advertising

&gt;&gt;  I'm just repeating what I was told by a USPS postal clerk, when I
&gt;&gt; asked them about the distinction, and explained that I would be
&gt;&gt; mailing comics.

&gt;&gt;  Some comics contain advertising.  Others don't.  Some contain
&gt;&gt; advertising only for other comics, while others have ads for all
&gt;&gt; sorts of products.

&gt;&gt;  But anyway, the difference is really moot.

&gt;&gt;  If you want delivery confirmation and need to ship from home,  (as I
&gt;&gt; do, since I'm a stay-at-home Dad with two toddlers) your only choice
&gt;&gt; without paying ridiculous fees is to ship through Paypal.  That means
&gt;&gt; that when time isn't an issue, you are unable to choose Bound Printed
&gt;&gt; Matter even if you want to.

I should probably mention that I typically sell about 2k books /yr and
ship via USPS.

Some comic books do conform to media rules, many do not.    None conform
to bound printed matter.

Of course, even the PO (especially inexpereinced clerks) will provide
conflicting answers as to what qualifies for media rate.  I guess it's
much like getting advice from the IRS.

When I first started selling books, clerks in the local PO frequently
advised me to send some items via BPM.   After a few months, I was
advised that they had been incorrectly processing my book orders with
BPM.   I've also been told (by window PO clerks) that they will not
usually question a customer.  One used an example where an elderly lady
would mail off local papers every week using media mail rates.   The
clerk admitted knowing it was improper, but commented that since she was
an elderly woman living on a fixed income, they overlooked the situation.

Good point -  It should have been &quot;conscience&quot;.  (I'm aware of the
difference.)

I fully admit I have terrible typing skills.  I'm guessing my
autocorrect provided that spelling (though I may not have been thinking) .

I'm fully guilty of  inadequate proof reading.

just because paypal doesn't offer the shipping method you prefer doesn't
mean
you can just pick any method you want.   you'll have to trot to the po to
get it
or choose an appropriate category from what's offered by paypal.   or, if
there's no appropriate category at paypal, you need to go to the po,
