Thinking about retiring my Nikon 950 for a mid-range DSLR.

Considering Nikon, Canon, or Olympus.  The question of this day is: do any
of the three NOT require proprietary batteries?  Or maybe better said, can
any of the three use standard NiMH AAs, either natively or in some kind of a
holder?

Am I correct in thinking that Nikon is the only one of the three that cannot
use the full function of 3rd party lenses?

Proprietry batteries will aloow you to get maximum performance out of your
new camera.

I always thought that batteries would be a problem, with my latest D-SLR I
simply bought one extra original and two well known brand aftermarket
batteries and have not had a problem. The four batteries give me at least
2,000 shots, possibly as many as 3,000 before I need a recharge, they are
light and will stay charged over a long period, I do also have an extra
charger that will work off 100-240VAV or 10-24VDC so it is unlikely to be a
problem.

Any of the D-SLRs will use 3rd party lenses including Nikons, they just have
to be the right type.

the pentax k100d uses aa batteries.  keep in mind that a lithium ion
battery can typically provide 1500-2000 pictures per charge.  if you
insist on aa batteries, some cameras can use them in a battery grip.

where'd you get that idea?  all nikon slrs and dslrs can use almost any
nikon ai lens made in the last 30 years and earlier non-ai lenses can
be modified to fit.

the only issue is that the nikon d40 and d40x will only autofocus if
the lens has an internal focus motor; otherwise, the lens works fine.
other nikon cameras do not have this restriction.  both nikon and sigma
make lenses with an internal focus motor (over 40 from which to
choose), and presumably tokina and tamron will update theirs.

Most of the D-SLRs have a vertical grip that can  use AA batteries as an
option. The low-end Nikons do not have such a grip. Not sure about the
Olympus, but you would not want an Olympus D-SLR anyway.

I have the battery grip for my 20D. I could not imagine not having a
vertical grip for portrait oriented shots. I had it on my film SLR as
well. It's an extremely useful accessory. I tried it with AA cells once,
since it came with an AA battery tray. It was okay, but the Li-Ion
batteries are so superior in so many ways that it wasn't worth the
hassle of AA cells (six of them, so you either need two chargers, or
have to charge sequentially). The grip takes two Li-Ion packs, but will
work with only one.

Clearly you've never used a vertical grip. It's very awkward to
constantly be turning the camera and having the shutter release in the
wrong place. This is why the demand for the vertical grips is so high
that if the manufacturer doesn't sell one, some after-market company
will step in (for popular D-SLRs anyway).

As I explained, the grip will work with a single Li-Ion battery. One can
be charged while the other is in use.

And, you can't just compare four good AA batteries with &quot;a good
after-market li-ion battery&quot;, since li-ion batteries come in
hundreds of proprietary types each having a different price.

I've used both types, by the way.  Battery type is way down on
my list when selecting a camera.

Nikon can use 3rd party lenses.

Perhaps you could add Pentax to your list?

I would suggest that how the cameras (in your price range) feel in the
hand is most important, and that batteries may be a secondary
consideration.  Most likely the Li-ion battery for the camera will last
longer than one day's shooting.

As you already have Nikon, you may want to look at the D40 or D40X DSLR
kit, and add the lightweight and inexpensive image-stabilised 55 - 200mm
VR lens.  No other manufacturer offers anything approaching that lens in
value+performance for money terms.  You can pay more, of course, if you
want to!

You need to look at the verdict, they have pulled the original because there
has been testing of the 50-200mm badged as a Samsung that is very good, may
have got a bad couple of lenses. Mind you there is a couple of good non
IS/VR/SR lenses that on the Pentaxes simply use the cameras inbuilt SR.

Mind you I have a 70-300mm DG APO and it is pretty good except at the very
long end, bit heavier than the 50-200 though.

I purchased the battery grip for my 350D but seldom use it, I find it
makes the camera awkward in landscape orientation, but it is more
comfortable in portrait orientation. If I used a camera mostly for

You might be able to charge one when you get back to  base, and the

not have a few hours downtime before or after sleeping.

Wow, what are you doing here?  Can you send me an autograph,

I can understand adding battery grips even if it's only for the
'gripping'.  But I've used flash brackets for the same purpose,
using them with no flash attached because it makes it easier for me
to carry and handle some cameras.  They're also a lot cheaper than
Canon's or Nikon's battery grips.  But we don't know how many people
you know that own DSLRs that don't own battery grips, so the fact
that you know two that have added battery grips doesn't tell us more
than we already know, which is basically that battery grips exist,
and a very small percentage of people own and use them.

BTW, less than two hours ago I walked into a Radio Shack, and the
only reason I did so was to inquire about the battery grip in their
streetside display window.  It was for a Rebel XT (IIRC) and was
made by Targus, not by Canon.  I know that there are also some made
for Nikon bodies that Nikon hasn't made any for, so I asked about
those, and was told that they only had such products for Canon
cameras because they don't sell any non-Canon DSLRs.

Not everyone, but some of the D-SLRs are so small and light that the
grip makes it more comfortable to hold, and reduces shake.

I think that's why there was such high demand for vertical grips for
cameras where the manufacturer didn't offer them that the aftermarket
stepped in to fill the void. The D40 also has a grip available, but it
lacks a shutter release button. It may not have been practical to add
this feature but it would have been possible by utilizing the IR feature.

Failing to produce a full line of accessories for the low end is one way
that manufacturers try to segment their offerings, and drive buyers to
higher cost models.

no spot meter in the 400d &amp; 20d.  one had to buy a 1d for spotmeter

has a spotmeter.

the 400d &amp; 30d also lack auto-iso, and exposure compensation is limited

&gt; any of the three use standard NiMH AAs, either natively or in some kind of a

The Nikon D80 and D200 both have optional battery packs that will hold
AA batteries. I do not know of one for the D40. The D70 came with a
battery holder that would hold CR123 batteries.

The rechargeable lithium ion batteries included with the Nikons are
lighter weight and pack a lot of power compared to NiMH batteries. They
last longer, can be recharged at any time without worrying about
battery memory, and they are cheaper. The newer Nikons can tell you a
lot about their batteries, such as how old they are, whether they are
fully recharging, their current level, and so forth. You would lose all
the capability with NiMH batteries.

NiMH batteries do not work well in the newer Nikon Speedlights, either.
I rarely get much use out of them. I prefer lithium AAs in my strobes.
They are not rechargeable, but they are much lighter and they last
several times longer. Lithium AAs do seem to have a problem with
overheating, though.

With an exception for the SB-600, that's clearly false if the
tables in Nikon's manuals are reasonably accurate.  The newest flash
is the SB-400 which uses two AA cells.  Nikon says that lithium
cells are good for 250 flashes.  That's only slightly better than
NiMH cells, not several times better, since Nikon says that 2,500mAh
NiMH cells are good for 210 flashes per charge, and extrapolating,
2,700mAh cells would be good for 227 flashes.  Perhaps you used old
or damaged NiMH cells if your experience is with the SB-400?

The NiMH cells have additional advantages in the SB-400.  The
recycling time for lithium cells is given as 4.2 seconds vs. 2.5
seconds for the NiMH cells.  Lithium cells have another problem in
that they get much hotter when used, so the figures Nikon gave for
the number of flashes using NiMH cells was tested firing with &quot;full
flash output&quot; every 30 seconds.  Because more time was needed to
dissipate the heat generated by the lithium cells, the time between
flashes was stretched to 120 seconds.

The older SB-600 comes closer to &quot;several times longer&quot;, providing
up to 400 flashes using four lithium AA cells vs. 220 flashes using
2,000 mAh NiMH cells.  But if the latest 2,700 mAh NiMH cells are
used, the number of flashes should climb from 220 to nearly 300
flashes per charge.  And again, NiMH has shorter recycle times, 2.5
seconds vs. 4.0 seconds for the lithium AA cells.  The manual didn't
say anything about the interval between flashes.

The higher power SB-800 reverses that, getting only 170 flashes
from four lithium AA cells vs. 150 flashes from 2,000mAh NiMH cells.
But again, higher capacity NiMH cells would allow more flashes per
charge, just over 200 flashes from 2,700mAh cells, which is more
than you'd get from lithium AA cells.

The SB-600 and SB-800 manuals include this warning :

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Lithium (1.5V) batteries
&gt; Non-rechargeable. Never attempt to charge these batteries in a battery
&gt;     charger. Otherwise, they may explode.
&gt; • Depending on battery specifications, when these batteries become hot,
&gt;     the safety circuits are activated, cutting off power. This often occurs
&gt;     when the flash unit is operated in the repeating flash mode. Battery
&gt;     power will recover when the temperature returns to normal.
">

I know that lithium AA cells have internal circuitry that limits
the continuous load to 2 amps.  Energizer's data sheets indicate
that 3 amps is possible for short duty cycle use, 2 seconds on
followed by 8 seconds off.  What I don't know is whether when the
flash shuts down from overheating, it's because the flash disabled
itself until it cools, or if it's because one or more of the AA
cells shut down to cool off.

I've had two camcorders that use the BP-511, as well as my 20D and G2. I
have had two Li-Ion packs go bad over the past six years or so.

&gt;&gt; NiMH batteries do not work well in the newer Nikon Speedlights, either.
&gt;&gt; I rarely get much use out of them. I prefer lithium AAs in my strobes.

I have never used the SB-400. I only have an SB-800. Thanks for the
info on the SB-400.

You're welcome.  Though it's not fully featured and has a
ridiculous manual (it appears to be a very large foldout sheet using
tiny print), the SB-400 seems to be a very nice little speedlight.
It's probably a good mate for D40/D40x owners that want to keep
their equipment as portable as possible, and have no need for a
complex, multiple flash CLS.  Inexpensive, too.

&gt;&gt; In February '05 I bought two Li-Ion batteries for my 10D.  The total cost
&gt;&gt; including shipping was $24 for the pair.  One lasted two years the other
&gt;&gt; is still going strong.  In May I purchased two more Li-Ion batteries, but
&gt;&gt; this time only paid about $8 a battery.  In time, I'll find out if they
&gt;&gt; are 'good buys' or not, but at any rate Li-Ions are so cheap I can't
&gt;&gt; imagine anyone wanting to use other battery types.

&gt;&gt; By the way, the original Li-Ion batteries that came with my Canon G1 in
&gt;&gt; '01 and my 10D in '03 are both still working.

&gt; Where'd you get the BP-511 for $8? This wasn't one of those eBay deals
&gt; with high shipping costs, was it?

I was in error, the batteries weren't $8 each, they were less.  I bought a
charger that runs on 120 v or 12 v and two BP-511 generic batteries for
$16.99 plus $5.99 shipping.  I can't lose much if the batteries don't last.
Time will tell.

The web site is
http://www.accstation.com/200014.html?gad=CNWknIEDEggBwRj5snK_NhiJp-j...

I found them googling.  There is a wide difference in prices and probably of
quality as well for Li-Ion batteries.  A little over two years ago I bought
two batteries for about $25 for the pair.  One went bad a few months ago and
the other still works.

What's the maH rating on the batteries? The ones I buy for $12 are now
2000 mAH.
