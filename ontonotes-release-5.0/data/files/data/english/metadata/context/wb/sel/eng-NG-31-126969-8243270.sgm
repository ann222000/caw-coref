Apparently Buffyworld.com has called it quits:

http://whedonesque.com/comments/13654#more

I never explored the site much beyond the episode transcripts, but I used
those a *lot*.  Oh, well, at least Google still has cached versions of the
transcripts available.

Google doesn't keep stuff cached forever, though - they'll be gone in
a week or so, probably. So if you want em, grab em now.

Thanks for the tip.  It took me a minute to figure out where the transcripts
were (if anyone else has the same trouble, the links are under the
&quot;multimedia&quot; sections).  But once I got to the guide and transcript pages, I
decided that layout, with each series collected together on one page, is more
to my taste than Buffyworld's system of one page per season.  It'll be
interesting to see how the actual transcripts compare to the old Buffyworld
ones.  I just looked at the Revelations transcript, and it seems to be the
same one posted on Buffyworld -- I recognize the tanscriber's personal spin
on the big argument scene.

If you're interested, I still have all my old transcripts that Joerg
Plate used to post on his site. They were quite popular at the time.
They're PDF files, in full script format, with graphics and screen shots
included among the text. Obviously a complete set would be prohibitively
time-consuming to e-mail but if you have favorite episodes, I'd be happy
to send them to you.

After AoQ finishes his second round of reviews, would you (or someone who
has the transcripts) be interested in posting the transcripts here once a
week, one transcript at a time, and then invite comments on that particular
episode? That'll keep this NG busy for a while? Just a thought to keep this

Gahd, PDF is a horribly inefficient file format.  Over 5 megs for
something that shouldn't take much more than 300K

(About 100K worth of text, and another 200K for the pictures.)

Thanks!  The one for Doppelgangland was pretty nice -- the maker obviously
went to a lot of trouble.  I wasn't able to download GD1 and 2, though.  I
think those files might be corrupted.

BTW, have you written any more of &quot;Blood Prey&quot;?

No, they weren't corrupted. Apparently whatever file-naming protocols
Apple uses on its web sites had a problem with the commas in the names
of the files (e.g., Graduation Day, Part 2.pdf). I renamed the files and
they downloaded fine for me. Give it another try and it should be okay.

I also added one more to the sample set. Another fan favorite.

&quot;Season 8&quot; is listed.  I assume that would be the stories they sponsored -
not the comic book.

Thus far I kind of like the way it's programmed.  And it's offering scripts
