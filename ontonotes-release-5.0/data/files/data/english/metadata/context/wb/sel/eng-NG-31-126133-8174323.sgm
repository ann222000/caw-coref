Actually, there are two.  The version released in North America is a
different 'cut' from the original.

This was a joint US/Japanese production.  The US producers contracted with
Hong Kong-based Imagi Animation Studios for the script and soundtrack.
Japanese Madhouse Studios (Paprika) provided the animation with Japanese
overall director, Kawajiri Yoshiaki (Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust) and
Japanese animation director and character designer Abe Hisashi (Devil May
Cry, Gunslinger Girl).

The script is in English and there is no Japanese dub of the movie.
Nevertheless, the US producers decided, against Kawajiri's wishes, to
re-edit the film for the North American release.  This is what US producer
Galen Walker said in an interview:

&quot;I think Peter Davis really felt that the movie was a little too long, and
was not clear enough. Bill (Panzer) had issues as well. We ended up working
with a really great editor, Jeff Werner. We all sat in a room with him for
two weeks and made our edits to the film. I took it and presented it to
Kawajiri and he didn't like it. He didn't want us to cut his film.&quot;

This is how he summarizes the differences between the two versions:

&quot;As far as the story goes, the biggest issues came at the end. Kawajiri had
a director's cut that is much longer than the original film we're putting
out. It wasn't so obvious in certain issues. When you see the director's
version compared to the US version, we have opening monolog cards that come
up to start the story, telling you what's going on, giving some background.
There's some narration in the beginning. They don't have that in the
Japanese version. There's about seven or eight additional scenes in the
Japanese version that we cut out in the US one, just for timing, and just
for pace of story. That was the big issue. I'm sure Mr Kawajiri was really
unhappy about the cut, but this was what the other producers thought was
best for everybody.&quot;

For people who want to see the longer version, Walker states the Kawajiri
version will be released in North America as a director's cut.

Acknowledgment:  Walker's comments come from Scott Green's AICN-Anime
column and are quoted under the fair use doctrine.  The entire interview is

Panzer and Davis are a pair of flaming assholes and they always have
been. Sam Peckinpah, once a great American director (THE WILD BUNCH),
directed his last film for them, THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND (1983), and he
had a horrible experience with them. He died not long after.

SPOILER WARNING

I found it too preachy.  Everybody's ragging on McCloud ( Boy, he sucks as
a fighter.  And where's his cowboy hat and horse? :-) ) for pursuing Marcus,
that he's selfish and hurtful to do this.  Well, since Marcus is a homocidal
maniac that has endangered so many lives there's actually a GOOD reason to go
after him...

Did that immortal girl die as well?  I couldn't tell.

And where do these immortals come from?  Did something happen to MacCloud
at Stonehenge that turned him into an immortal?  Can anyone become an immortal?

What I write only applies to the version shown on the SF Channel
on July 30, 2007.  Some other version may have different dialogue
and therefore my reading may be incorrect for another version.

He abandoned his search for vengeance and sought to protect the city
from Marcus's deranged plans.  Also according to his spirit guide &quot;someone&quot;
hears and answers prayers aside from girl friends with mortal lives but
immortal re-incarnated souls.

He called on God before launching his final successful attack.
He was not blinded by hatred of Marcus at long last.

Aside from the action ingredients the show is promoting very
conventional if mixed religious views in my opinion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There can be only one.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, there are two.  The version released in North America is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different 'cut' from the original.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Failed to get my point. Try again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You might have to clue me in.

&gt;&gt;&gt;    Nothing kills a joke faster than trying to explain it to those
&gt;&gt;&gt;    who don't get it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;    Move on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;    Cap.
&gt;&gt; Wouldn't want to put you out of business:

&gt;&gt; &quot;Since 1989, recycling old jokes, cliches, and bad puns, one Usenet
&gt;&gt; post at a time!&quot;

&gt;&gt; ^-^

&gt;    Yes, but I never explain them.  Better to get forgiveness,
&gt;    and all that..

And all these years I've thought your old jokes, cliches, and bad puns were
serious reflections on the profundity of anime.  ^-^
