Philly goes wild for Wi-Fi EarthLink races to deploy megamunicipal mesh
network in Philadelphia

Feature  By Sonina Matteo, Network World, 08/06/07

Philadelphia is well on its way to becoming one of the world's biggest
Wi-Fi&lt; http://www.networkworld.com/details/739.html &gt;hot spots. In May,
after a 15-square-mile test zone passed muster, the city
gave EarthLink &lt; http://www.networkworld.com/news/financial/earthlink.html &gt;the
green light to cover the entire 135-square-mile city with a wireless
mesh network &lt; http://www.networkworld.com/topics/wireless-services.html &gt; by
year-end.

EarthLink is moving full-speed ahead, adding Tropos Networks access points
to light poles around the city, testing and optimizing the network, and
building out coverage at a pace of 5,000 potential households per workday.
Today, coverage has expanded to 80% of the city.

From a technology perspective, creating a full-blown mesh network across an
entire city -- from parks to tourist attractions to downtown skyscrapers to
residential neighborhoods with brownstones jammed together -- presents quite
a challenge.

&quot;It was important for people to be mobile and treat the entire city network
as one large, unified network, so if they attached in one place they could
start surfing the Web and keep the connection even if they went to another
point across town,&quot; says Jeb Linton, director and chief architect for
EarthLink.

Philadelphia pushes for low-cost Wi-Fi for its poorest
residents&lt;/research/2007/080607-philadelphia-wifi-inclusion.html&gt;
------------------------------

&quot;No system in the world had ever been able to scale to that level of
mobility &lt; http://www.networkworld.com/topics/wireless.html &gt; in a Wi-Fi
network,&quot; Linton adds. &quot;So we had a unique architectural challenge to enable
this.&quot;

EarthLink is building out the network using Tropos
802.11b&lt; http://www.networkworld.com/details/595.html &gt;
/g &lt; http://www.networkworld.com/details/466.html &gt; access points, which
connect to a complex backhaul system that uses
Motorola&lt; http://www.networkworld.com/news/financial/motorola.html &gt;Canopy
line-of-sight radios and Alvarion BreezeAccess VL non-line-of-sight
radios.

As with any project of this scale, problems have emerged and original
planning assumptions have had to be adjusted. For example, EarthLink has had
to double the number of access points per square mile, from an original
estimate of 20 to the current figure of 42, to provide the requisite level
of coverage. In addition, after the access points are installed, there's a
four- to six-week optimization process designed to maximize coverage.

&quot;We are using our tools to drive testing, and we use customer feedback to
improve coverage. We don't think we'll ever get to 100% coverage, but we are
very happy with 90% until technology, both on our side and on the user's
side improves,&quot; says Donald Berryman, president of EarthLink Municipal
Networks.

Even with 42 access points per square mile, customers who want in-home or
in-building coverage need a special, high-powered Wi-Fi modem from Ruckus
Wireless or PePLink. EarthLink sells or rents the units and offers them for
free to customers who sign a one-year contract.

Despite the technical issues, EarthLink is confident it will be able to
scale out mobile broadband across the city, as well as turn a profit on its
$13.5 million investment. The city is excited about the potential benefits,
which fall into several categories:

1. Economic. At the core of the project is the expectation of increased
economic development through the availability of wireless Internet access,
according to Philadelphia CIO Terry Phillis.

2. Tourism. &quot;We hope for enhanced tourism opportunities and to have the
whole city identified as a hot spot for anyone who would come here,&quot; Phillis
says.

3. Municipal use. The city foresees inspectors and other mobile city workers
using the Wi-Fi network to communicate back to the office. &quot;This technology
is a perfect opportunity for them to use the Internet, with communication
back to the centralized system, anyplace they go in the city,&quot; says Varinia
Robinson, the city's director of technology.

4. Web access for low-income families. 25,000 half-price accounts have been
earmarked for welfare-to-work and low-income qualifying households. The
basic retail price for the Wi-Fi broadband Internet service is about $20 per
month, and Wireless Philadelphia, the nonprofit agency created to help
administer the program, offers the service for $9.95 per month. In some
cases, the low-cost broadband access will be bundled with laptops and
training paid for by community-based organizations,&quot; says Wireless
Philadelphia's CEO Greg Goldman.

5. Increased competition for residential broadband. EarthLink is challenging
Verizon &lt; http://www.networkworld.com/news/financial/verizon.html &gt; and
Comcast in the residential broadband market, and city officials predict that
this competition will bring rates down for everyone.

*Network World* plans to provide ongoing coverage of Philadelphia's
ambitious Wi-Fi project. This story focuses on the buildout of the network,
but future stories will cover how well the city is meeting the goals it has
laid out. We're also looking for feedback from residents, tourists and
visitors to the city. If you'd like to share your wireless experiences, go here
