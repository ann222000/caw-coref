So black, which is the sync pulse, which is the retrace blanking, gets
lots of transmit power, so things tend to stay in sync. Max-black also

There are exceptions. System L, still used in France, for example, has
peak white at max RF power. The analog audio sub-carrier is amplitude
modulated.

There is a digitally modulated sub-carrier for stereo audio (NICAM)

With the signal inverted, the tips of the sync pulses are the biggest
part of the signal. They are also always exactly the same height,
regardless of whether the scene is bright or dark. This means you can
always rely on the black level being 2/3 (or whatever, I forget) of
the way up the signal. Anything above that is sync, anything below is
picture. If the signal were broadcast &quot;right way up&quot;, with syncs at
the bottom, you would recover a signal which varied in amplitude
depending on the brightness of the scene, and it would be impossible
to determine the exact location of either black or the sync front and
back porches.

_________

Accurate colour reproduction requires accurate transmission of the
luminance (brightness) value of each colour, which is set by a
specific, DC-coupled voltage.  If the video signal was transmitted
using AC coupling, then luminance values would be a function of the
average voltage of the video waveform.

For that matter accurate monochome reproduction also requires DC
coupling, but it is not as objectionable if not used (cheap TV set,
etc).

Also - the purpose of inverting video for transmission is to transmit
the peaks of sync pulses at +100% modulation, which allows TV
receivers to show the most stable picture in the presence of noise
(eg, fringes of the coverage area of the TV station).

You don't need to use DC coupling as long as your sync separator can
identify the back porch for you. Having done that you have a piece of
known black to which you can apply a gated voltage clamp. From that
point onwards you need DC coupling - but it is not far from there to
the tube.

Yup. Gain was expensive (now it's essentially free) and DC coupling
was difficult. And RF noise figures were ghastly, especially at UHF.

first try repair was to kick it in the area where we suspected the
problem lay, which was effective more often than not. One day, though, a
general was making an announced inspection tour; on that morning, of
course, the computer failed. We applied the standard fix, but this time
the fixer kicked too hard and caved in one of the doors. The general
came in, looked around and asked &quot;Did that fix it?&quot; We told that it had,
and he said &quot;good!&quot; and walked out. We hadn't even told him what had

My only comeback is that I had two of these 400 tube monsters and another
smaller one with only about 200 tubes. Even so my total of 1,000 tubes falls
short of 1,500.  BTW, this was the Hawk system.

Do I get bonus points if my monsters were in the open air (sun, rain and
hurricane-force winds), on the top of 60-80 foot towers in the Everglades,
complete with alligator-infested scenery that was mostly under water?

Once I got *tired* of that, they moved me to Germany, where the radars were
still in the open air (sun, sleet, rain, waist-deep snow and subzero temps),
on individualized hilltops.  The scenery in Germany included a 270 degree
vista of a large valley, complete with farms, little towns, and a castle or
two.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We tend to forget how primitive things were back then

In less than 50 years ignorant people will be commenting on how primitive

&gt;&gt; Agreed. I once maintained equipment with about 400 &quot;high reliability&quot; tubes

&gt; I can top that. I helped to maintain a 1500-tube (all but three of which

&gt; the fixer kicked too hard and caved in one of the doors. The general

Huh? This is just nonsense. The noise doesn't live at the bottom of
the signal where the white is. The noise accompanies the signal
whatever level it is at. The black will have just as much noise in it
as the white. The reason why small signals appear noisier is that you
have to apply gain to make them bigger - making the noise bigger too.
This is not the case with a TV signal - you don't apply more gain when
the signal drops into the white.

Not in the case of video, though - the reason that the blacks
are &quot;more sensitive to noise&quot; than the white is actually because
our eyes are more sensitive to small changes in dark regions
than in light regions. As you noted, though, the noise is going to
hit the blacks just as much as the whites within the signal - but
as others noted, it's better that a brief high-amplitude noise spike
make a &quot;black dot&quot; in a white region than the other way around.
The only part of the standard I'm aware of that was specifically
put in to handle the increased sensitivty to black-region noise
was a modification to the assumed standard response (&quot;gamma&quot;)
curve.

And, of course, the other (and possibly the primary) reason for
the inverted transmission was to put the most &quot;oomph&quot; behind
the sync pulses - which means that even those in the fringe areas
can get a stable, albeit snowy, picture.

OT (I guess)

My first thought at the start of this thread was &quot;OMG, another radium
thread&quot;, but I read a few posts anyway. So:

1. I'm learning something about why black is full signal - actually a
meaningful question after all.

2. I'm enjoying the tales in this part of the thread about pizza ovens
and so forth. I even had a couple of LOLs...

Reverse video to give higher transmission power during black was chosen,
because noise is more visible to the eye in the black levels of video.
With the whites, noise is less visible to the eye. Therefore the higher
transmission power levels in black levels allow for less visible noise
due to any RF carrier signal loss.

It has nothing to do with sync pulses.  The sync occurs during the
blanking time at the beginning of each picture frame. The total
horizontal blanking is approximately 10.6 to 10.8 usec.  The sync pulse
approximately 4.2 to 4.8 usec wide. The colour colour burst pulse sits
on the back-porch of the blanking.

There is a rather logical reason for this. For maximum stability, you want
the most power to occur during the sync pulses. That means the sync pulses
have to be either blacker than black, or whiter than white. But, you want
the screen to be black during sync pulses/retrace. Remember, we are talking
1940s technology here; and no color.

What has not been considered so far in this thread is the TYPE of noise.

1.  White noise is roughly symmetrical about zero and, regardless of the
video modulation polarity,  will appear as a mixture of white spots and
black spots.

2. Impulse noise (from electrical appliances and so on) produces a video
signal which is asymmetrical, being relatively unlimited in the
direction corresponding to more carrier and of course limited to zero in
the direction corresponding to less carrier.   So, impulse noise can
produce either intense white spots or very black spots, depending of the
vide modulation polarity.

Negative video modulation has no effect on perceived white noise, but
does make impulse noise less obtrusive, so was chosen for this reason.

John

There was no heating system in Harvard University's computer building in
the 1950s. Plenty of air conditioning for use in warm weather, but in
winter, they took air in through vents in the roof -- it was cleaner up
there -- and blew it out through gratings in the sidewalk. It was a
welcome relief when walking down the street in sub-zero weather to stand
in the flow of 60-degree air that emerged. The tubes in the computer
were special red (high reliability with red Bakelite bases) mostly 6SN7
dual triodes.

No. Noise is noise and is just as visible whatever the level. What
matters is signal-to-noise ratio, especially for synchronizing. Black
level is naturally used for blanking, and sync is &quot;blacker than black&quot;
so it can't be seen. That part of a line wants the most power.

When your TV is turned off, you can see (but generally ignore) specular
reflections from the picture tube. Those don't get darker when the set
is on, but like the green color, they go completely unnoticed.

Not so.  The average video/movie scene, ignoring
oddities such as static frames of text as might appear at
the end of a commercial or some such, generally has an
average overall luminance well under 50% of that of a
full white screen.  Most often, in fact, you're down
around 25% or under.

What you see as &quot;black&quot; at any given moment really just
means &quot;an area that's a whole lot darker than its surroundings.&quot;
With the TV off, you see the screen &quot;as it is,&quot; with no bright
light sources in your field of view to make it look darker.
With the TV on, those parts of the screen which aren't making
light are the darkest thing by far in your field of view, and look
&quot;black.&quot;

Vision in general doesn't work in terms of absolutes, but
instead deals with differences and change; it's all relative.

By the way, the screen itself (in a color CRT) is still a
greenish-gray, if you could see it directly.  In modern
color tubes, though, you're typically looking at the phosphor
screen through a dark glass faceplate, which is made so to
enhance the perceived contrast.  (Up really close, the
phosphor screen is stripes or rectangular dots of the red,
green, and blue phosphors - each of which in the &quot;off&quot;
state typically has a pale tinge of that color - with each
individual dot surrounded by a black material, again put
there as a contrast-enhancement measure.)

So do you think the noise gets smaller during the higher parts of the

Do you really mean 6L6? That is a beam power tetrode, practically the
same as a 5881, and KT66s could be used for a little more allowed
dissipation. IIRC, the classic Williamson amplifier used 6L6s in the
output stage.

Yes, I meant 6L6. I don't recall what their use was, but they were
definitely, hidden under a MILSPEC number. I was in a strange situation,
incidentally. I was drafted, but our techs had to enlist for three
years, of which they spent 54 weeks in training. After they completed
that period of a year and two weeks, they were specifically NOT
authorized to make a soldered connection, although our TO&amp;E included
soldering irons and solder. I wound up being assigned to the supply van,
which I loved because I was not on the KP or guard rosters. I had been
building electronic equipment off and on for ten years, so if soldering
was needed the techs had a choice: get me to solder, or take the part to
an ordnance depot several miles away and wait while a part-time high
school student fixed it. Ah, the army and its mysterious ways.

Consider... when black is being transmitted, the r-f power radiated by
a TV station is greater than when white is being transmitted.
Therefore the field strength produced at a receiving antenna is higher
for black than white, and a given value of r-f noise will be a lesser
percentage of the received signal during transmission of black then
white.  In other words, black (and sync, which is blacker than black)
will have a higher signal-to-noise ratio.

However noise voltage tends to drive the detected video waveform about
as far in negative polarity as it does positive.  Therefore the
average change in light output from the display (CRT, etc) across a
complete cycle of noise energy can be close to zero, at a normal
viewing distance.

This effect is lost, though, for noise on low luminance video, because
the negative-going noise pulses can extend below reference black where
the display cannot fully show them, whereas the opposite noise
polarity will be fully shown at that luminance level.

&gt; &gt; Especially if your name was Muntz. ;-)

&gt; &gt;&gt; A LOT of maintenance.

&gt; &gt; Agreed. I once maintained equipment with about 400 &quot;high reliability&quot; tubes
&gt; &gt; in it. MTBF: less than a day.

&gt; I can top that. I helped to maintain a 1500-tube (all but three of which
&gt; were dual or triple purpose) analog computer back a little over 50 years
&gt; ago. It was part of a Nike Surface-to-air missile system. The standard
&gt; first try repair was to kick it in the area where we suspected the
&gt; problem lay, which was effective more often than not. One day, though, a
&gt; general was making an announced inspection tour; on that morning, of
&gt; course, the computer failed. We applied the standard fix, but this time
&gt; the fixer kicked too hard and caved in one of the doors. The general
&gt; came in, looked around and asked &quot;Did that fix it?&quot; We told that it had,
&gt; and he said &quot;good!&quot; and walked out. We hadn't even told him what had
&gt; happened. And, incidentally, we called the van it was in the &quot;pizza
&gt; oven&quot;. You can't believe how much heat 1500 tubes put out unless you've
&gt; been there. Viva la Solid State.
">

You've never been around high power transmitter tubes that are water
cooled.  One of them had a pair of water cooled power tetrodes with
pairs of 1.5 VAC, 1000 A filaments. 6 KW of heat from the filaments,
plus the plate dissipation. It had a water chillier big enough for a
decent sized office building.  Then there was The Comark/Thales 195 KW
(130 KW + 65 KW) UHF transmitter in Orange City, FLorida with multiple
chillers.
