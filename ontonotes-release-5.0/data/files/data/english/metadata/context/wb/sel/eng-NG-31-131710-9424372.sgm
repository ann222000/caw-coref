Aw, you guys are hilarious. You got so worked up about my posts that
you started Googling me? You gonna dig up the time I posted about my
divorce next? Or when my sociopath ex-girlfriend lied to me and told
me she was raped? You've got no bullets in your gun, pal.

Oh, and I've been posting under this name for the better part of a
decade. You've got a lot of posts to slog through. Feel free to print
out your favorites and stick 'em under your pillow.

&gt;&gt; &gt; That's the second time you've used that in the same thread. I bet its
&gt;&gt; &gt; lit up your life having these usenet 'battles' following our

&gt;&gt; &quot;Invasion?&quot; Seriously, how old are you?  I wouldn't be surprised if
&gt;&gt; there's
&gt;&gt; a huge thread over in whatever Rush newsgroup you kids hang out in where
&gt;&gt; you're all chattering like little girls about how much fun it is trolling
&gt;&gt; other rock band newsgroups.

&gt; I'm using the word 'invasion' following the comments from one of your
&gt; Grease ball friends. You will in fact be surprised that 'us kids'
&gt; don't chatter like little girls about such pasttimes.

A quick glance at alt.music.rush proves otherwise.  You're one sad bunch.

Hey that's great art. Are you going to see Van Halen in concert? I just
got tickets for the Dec. 5 show. Looking forward to seeing them. I hope they
rock live as much as Rush does.

If Van Halen does a southern trek next year I may try and see them if
they are close enough. I hear that Rush may be playing near me for the
first time since Test For Echos so I am thinking of seeing that.
