Waterloo was born in 1846 and died in 1913 and was based in Chicago (as
is much of his fiction).  This is from his collection THE WOLF'S LONG
HOWL, and is the only supernatural story there, though there are some
sf or marginal sf tales in the 21 in the book.

A TRAGEDY OF THE FOREST
by Stanley Waterloo

It is Christmas eve.  A man lies stretched on his blanket in a copse in
the depths of a black pine forest of the Saginaw Valley. He has been
hunting all day, fruitlessly, and is exhausted.  So wearied is he with
long hours of walking, that he will not even seek to reach the
lumbermen's camp, half a mile distant, without a few moment's rest.  He
has thrown his blanket down on the snow in the bushes, and has thrown
himself upon the blanket, where he lies, half dreaming.  No thought of
danger comes to him.  There is slight risk, he knows, even were he to
fall asleep, though the deep forests of the Saginaw region are not
untenanted.  He is in that unexplainable mental condition which
sometimes comes with extreme exhaustion.  His bodily senses are dulled
and wearied, but a phenomenal acuteness has come to those perceptions
so hard of definition--partly mental, partly psychological.  The man
lying in the copse is puzzled at his own condition, but he does not
seek to analyze it.  He is not a student of such phenomena.  He is but
a vigorous young backwoodsman, the hunter attached to the camp of
lumbermen cutting trees in the vicinity.

The man has lain for some time listlessly, but the feeling which he
cannot understand increases now almost to an oppression. He sees
nothing, but there is an unusual sensation which alarms him.  He
recognizes near him a presence--fierce, intense, unnatural.  A rustle
in the twigs a few feet distant falls upon his ears. He raises his
head.  What he sees startles and at the same time robs him of all
volition.  It is not fear.  He is armed and is courageous enough.  It
is something else; some indefinable connection with the object upon
which he looks which holds him. There, where it has drawn itself
closely and stealthily from its covert in the underbrush, is a huge
gray wolf.

The man can see the gaunt figure distinctly, though the somber light is
deepening quickly into darkness.  He can see the grisly coat, the
yellow fangs, the flaming eyes.  He can almost feel the hot breath of
the beast.  But something far more disturbing than that which meets his
eye affects him.  His own individuality has become obscured and another
is taking its place.  He struggles against the transformation, but in
vain.  He can read the wolf's thoughts, or rather its fierce instincts
and desires.  He is the wolf.

Undoubtedly there exists at times a relation between the souls of human
beings.  One comprehends the other.  There is a transfer of wishes,
emotions, impulses.  Now something of the same kind has happened to the
man with this dreadful beast.  He knows the wolf's heart.  The man
trembles like one in fear. The perspiration comes in great drops upon
his forehead, and his features are distorted. It is a horrible thing.
Now a change comes.  The wolf moves.  He glides off in the darkness.
The spell upon the man is weakened, but it is not gone.  He staggers to
his feet, and half an hour later he is in the lumbermen's camp again.
But he comes in like one insane--pallid of face and muttering.  His
comrades, startled by his appearance, ply him with questions, receiving
only incoherent answers.  They place him in his rude bunk, where he
lies writhing and twisting about as under strong excitement.  His eyes
are staring, as if they must see what those about him cannot see, and
his breath comes quickly.  He pants like a wild beast.  There is reason
for it.  His thoughts are with the wolf.  He is the wolf. The
personalities of the ravening brute and of the man are blended now in
one, or rather the personality of the man has been eliminated.  The
man's body is in the lumbermen's camp, but his mind is in the depths of
the forest.  He is seeking prey!

*       *       *       *       *

"I am hungry!  I must have warm blood and flesh!  The darkness is here,
and my time has come.  There are no deer to-night in the pine forest on
the hill, where I have run them down and torn them. The deep snow has
driven them into the lower forest, where men have been at work.  The
deer will be feeding to-night on the buds of the trees the men have
felled.  How I hate men and fear them!  They are different from the
other animals in the wood.  I shun them.  They are stronger than I in
some way.  There is death about them.  As I crept by the farm beside
the river this morning I saw a young one, a child with yellow hair.
Ah, how I would like to feed upon her!  Her throat was white and soft.
But I dare not rush through the field and seize her.  The man was
there, and he would have killed me.  They are not hungry.  The odor of
flesh came to me in the wind across the clearing.  It was the same way
at this time when the snow was deep last year.  It is some day on which
they feast.  But I will feed better.  I will have hot blood.  The deer
are in the tops of the fallen trees now!"

Across frozen streams, gliding like a shadow through the underbrush,
swift, silent, with only its gleaming eyes to betray it, the gaunt
figure goes.  Miles are past.  The figure threads its way between the
trunks of massive trees.  It passes over fallen logs with long,
noiseless leaps; it creeps serpent-like beneath the wreck left by a
summer "cyclone"; it crosses the barren reaches of oak openings, where
the shadows cast by huge pines adjacent mingle in fantastic figures; it
casts a shifting shadow itself as it sweeps across some lighter spot,
where faint moonbeams find their way to the ground through overhanging
branches.  The figure approaches the spot where the lumbermen have been
at work.  Among the tops of the fallen trees are other figures--light,
graceful, flitting about.  The deer are feeding on the buds.

The eyes of the long gray figure stealing on grow more flaming still.
The yellow fangs are disclosed cruelly.  Slowly it creeps forward.  It
is close upon the flitting figures now.  There is a rush, a fierce,
hungry yelp, a great leap. There is a crash of twigs and limbs.  The
flitting figures assume another character; the beautiful deer, wild
with fright, bounding away with gigantic springs.  The steady stroke of
their hoofs echoes away through the forest.  In the tree-tops there is
a great struggle, and then the sound comes of another series of great
leaps dying off in the distance.  The prey has escaped.  But not
altogether! The grisly figure is following.  The pace had changed to
one of fierce pursuit.  It is steady and relentless.

*       *       *       *       *

The man in the bunk in the lumbermen's camp half leaps to his feet.
His eyes are staring more wildly, his breathing is more rapid.  He
appears a man in a spasm. His comrades force him to his bed again, but
find it necessary to restrain him by sher strength.  They think he had
gone mad.  But only his body is with them.  He is in the forest.  His
prey has escaped him.  He is pursuing it.

*       *       *       *       *

"It has escaped me!  I almost had it by its slender throat when it
shook me off and leaped away.  But I will have it yet!  I will follow
swiftly till it tires and falters, and then I will tear and feed upon
it.  The old wolf never tires!  Leap away, you fool, if you will.  I am
coming, hungry, never resting.  You are mine!"

With the speed of light the deer bounds away in the direction its
fellows have taken.  Its undulating leaps are like the flight of a
bird.  The snow crackles as its feet strike the frozen earth and flies
off in a white shower.  The fallen tree-tops are left behind. Miles are
covered.  But ever, in the rear, with almost the speed of the flying
deer, sweeps along the trailing shadow.  It is long past midnight.  The
moon has risen high, and the bright spots in the forest are more
frequent.  The deer crosses these with a rush.  A few moments later
there is in the same place the passage of shadow. Still they are far
apart.  Will they remain so?

Swiftly between the dark pines again, across frozen streams again,
through valleys and over hills, the relentless chase continues.  The
leaps of the fleeing deer become less vaulting, a look of terror in its
liquid eyes has deepened; its tongue projects from its mouth, it wet
flanks heave distressfully, but it flies on in desperation.  The
distance between it and the dark shadow behind has lessened plainly.
There is no abatement to the speed of this silent thing.  It follows
noiselessly, persistently.

The forest becomes thinner now.  The flying deer bounds over a fence of
brushwood and suddenly into a sea of sudden light.  It is the clearing
in the midst of which the farm-house stands. Across the sea of gold
made by the moonshine on the field of snow flies the deer, to disappear
in the depth of the forest beyond.  It has scarcely passed from sight,
when emerging from the wood appears the pursuing figure.  It is clearly
visible now.  There are flecks of foam upon the jaws, the lips are
drawn back from the sharp fangs, and even the light from above does not
dim nor lessen the glare in the hungry eyes.  The figure passes along
the long bright space.  The same scene in the forest beyond, but
intensified.  The distance between pursuer and pursued is lessening
still.  The leaps of the deer are weakening now, its quick panting is
painful.  And the thing behind is rushing along with its thirst for
blood increased by its proximity.  But the darkness in the forest is
disappearing. In the east there is a faint ruddy tinge.  It is almost
morning.

"I shall have it!  It is mine--the weak thing, with its rich, warm
blood!  Swift of foot as it is, did it think to escape the old wolf?
It falters as it leaps.  It is faint and tottering.  How I will tear
it!  The day has nearly come.  How I hate the day!  But the prey is
mine.  I will kill it in the gray light."

*       *       *       *       *

The man in the bunk in the lumbermen's camp is seized with another
spasm.  He struggles to escape from his friends, though he does not see
them.  He is fiercely intent on something.  His teeth are set and his
eyes glare fiercely.  It requires half a dozen men to restrain him.

*       *       *       *       *

The deer struggles on, still swiftly but with effort.  Its breath comes
in agony, its eyes are staring from its sockets.  It is a pitiable
spectacle.  But the struggle for life continues.  In its flight the
deer had described a circle.  Once more the forest becomes less dense,
the clearing with the farmhouse is reached again.  With a last
desperate effort the deer vaults over the brushwood fence.  The scene
had changed again.  The morning has broken. The great snowy surface
which was a sea of gold has become a sea of silver.  The farmhouse
stands out revealed plainly in the increasing light.  With flagging
movement the fugitive passes across the field.  But there is a sudden,
slight noise behind.  The deer turns its head. Its pursuer is close
upon it.  It sees the death which nears it.  The monster, sure now of
its prey, gives a fierce howl of triumph.  Terror lends the victim
strength. It turns toward the farm-house; it struggles through the
banks of snow; it leaps the low palings, where, beside great
straw-stacks, the cattle of the farm are herded.  It disappears among
them.

The door of the farm-house opens, and from it comes a man who strides
away toward where the cattle are gathered, lowing for their morning
feed.  After the man there emerges from the door a little girl with
yellow hair.  The child laughs aloud as she looks over the field of
snow, with its myriads of crystals flashing out all colors under the
rays of the morning sun.  She dances along the footpath in a direction
opposite that taken by the man.  Not far distant, creeping along the
deep furrow, is a lank, skulking figure.

"Can it be?  Has it escaped me, when it was mine?  I would have torn it
at the farm-house door but that the man appeared. Must I hunger for
another day, when I am raging for blood!  What is that?  It is the
child, and alone!  It has wandered away from the farmhouse.  Where is
the great hound that guards the house at night?  Oh, the child!  I can
see its white throat again.  I will tear it.  I will throttle the weak
thing and still its cries in an instant!"

*       *       *       *       *

The man in the bunk in the lumbermen's camp is wild again. His comrades
struggle to hold him down.

*       *       *       *       *

A horrible, hairy thing, with flaming eyes and hot breath, which leaps
upon and bears down a child with yellow hair.  A hoarse growl, the rush
of a great hound, a desperate struggle in the snow, and the still air
of morning is burdened suddenly with wild clamor. There is an opening
of doors, there are shouts and calls and flying footsteps; and then,
mingling with the cries of the writhing brutes, rings out sharply the
report of the farmer's rifle.  There is a howl of rage and agony, and a
gaunt gray figure leaps upward and falls quivering across the form of
the child.  The child is lifted from the ground unhurt.  The great
hound has by the throat the old wolf--dead!

*       *       *       *       *

The man in the lumbermen's camp has leaped from his bunk.  His
appearance is something ghastly.  His comrades spring forward to
restrain him, but he throws them off.  There is a furious struggle with
the madman.  He has the strength of a dozen men.  The sturdy lumbermen
at last gain the advantage over him.  Suddenly he throws up his hands
and pitches forward upon the floor of the shanty--dead.

They could never understand--the simple lumbermen--why the life of the
merry, light-hearted hunter of the party came to an end so suddenly on
the eve of Christmas Day.  He was well the day before, they said, in
perfect health, but he went mad on the eve of Christmas Day, and in the
morning died.
