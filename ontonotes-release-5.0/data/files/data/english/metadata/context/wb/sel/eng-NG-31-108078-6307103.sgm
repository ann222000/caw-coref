I am trying to reduce  the DC transformer 14v down to 3v. I went to Radio Shack
and started looking at resistors. Found out very quickly I did not know what I
was looking at. I would find something for example that read 470-OHM 1/2 watt
5% tolerance. Nothing about volts. So what do I need? I am trying to equal two
double A batteries.

Thanks in advance

Chris

I think your problem is going to be that because you're trying to set up
such a large voltage drop (14-3 = 11 volts), you're going to need a
fairly large resistor (power-dissipation-wise, not resistance) to
dissipate all the power. Otherwise you'll burn up the resistor.

Better to find one of them wall warts close to the voltage you need. I
see them in second-hand stores all the time for cheap.

By the way, resistors don't "come in volts". They don't make resistors
to drop x volts to y volts. No getting away from using Ohm's Law here.

You need Ohms Law:

R = V / I

(Resistance (in Ohms) equals Voltage (in Volts) over Current (in Amps)).

You want to drop 14-3 == 11 Volts.  At how many amps?  What is your
load? A white LED (which are 3V devices) draw about 20Miliamps
(.020Amps), so:

11 / .020 = 550 Ohms.  The stock value available would be 560 Ohms
(Green-Blue-Brown-Gold). It will need to disipate 220miliwatts, so a 1/4
watt will do just fine.

So, to generalize this for the OP:

* To compute the value of the resistor you need, divide the voltage drop
(11) by the current (in amperes), as per the example above.

* To compute the *power dissipation* of the resistor in watts, multiply
the voltage drop by the current in amperes. Make sure you use a resistor
large enough not to get too hot.

A resistor is not the way to go. What are you trying to power? How
much current does it draw?
I would suggest using a voltage regulator IC, something like the
LM317T here:
http://www.mouser.com/search/ProductDetail.aspx?R=LM317Tvirtualkey511...
The datasheet describing its use is here:
http://www.st.com/stonline/books/pdf/docs/2154.pdf
Here's power supply circuit using this:
http://www.tkk.fi/Misc/Electronics/circuits/lm317.html
This latter circuit shows a formula for calculating a fixed resistor
value for R2, but if you use a 5Kohm potentiometer instead you can get
an adjustable output range from about 1.25V to 18V. A similar circuit
showing this was just published in the January issue of Scale Rails (a
monthly magazine sent to NMRA members). As shown, a few additional
components are required to make it work properly, but it will be far
more reliable than just using a resistor to drop the voltage.

For some applications a resistor is the way to go.  For LEDs that's pretty
much the universal solution up to 120 volts.

Nope.  I learned the resistor color code mnemonic from a family friend (who
used to work at White Sands, and later at the Indianapolic Naval Ordnance
Lab), and picked up other mnemonics ("IDA CAD"  =  Inverter, DC to AC;
Converter, AC to DC) in Navy airborne electronics school at Memphis.  Where
one famous instructor taught that cigars were training devices for
c--ksuckers, a piece of wisdom I remember every time I see our Gropenator

The OP did not give enough information to give him an answer.  We (the
group) still don't know how much current is involved.  Without that, all
we can do is suggest how to compute the value, that is how to use Ohms Law.

OK, so it's true he didn't give us enough information. Are you

&gt; (Resistance (in Ohms) equals Voltage (in Volts) over Current (in Amps)).

&gt; You want to drop 14-3 == 11 Volts.  At how many amps?  What is your
&gt; load? A white LED (which are 3V devices) draw about 20Miliamps
&gt; (.020Amps), so:

&gt; 11 / .020 = 550 Ohms.  The stock value available would be 560 Ohms
&gt; (Green-Blue-Brown-Gold). It will need to disipate 220miliwatts, so a 1/4
&gt; watt will do just fine.

Thank you for the information. I am trying to power some LED's. I was able to
find what I needed today using the information you provided, which was what I
was looking for. In fact I have used the formula for several other lighting
projects as well. Hooked a few different things up today and they all work great.

Thanks again

Chris

OK, then all you need is a 1400 (1.4K) ohm resistor.
With a 14 volt source, that will give you about 10ma
of current through the LED.  If the LEDs are too bright,
you can use a larger value resistor (say, 2000 (2.0K) ohms.
or even 2.7K).
Or if they are too dim you can go with a lower value
resistor (say, 1000 ohms). The things are cheap enough,
buy about five values between 1000 ohms and 3000 ohms.
Then try each until you get the brightness you want.

FYI: LEDs are current opperated
devices (actually all electronic devices are).  You use
the resistor to limit the current through the LED.
As a rule of thumb figure that 20ma is the largest current.
and 2 to 10 ma is a good opperating range.
Use Ohm's law to figure out the resistor value.

Ohm's Law: Resistor = Voltage divided by Current.

Current in this case is your desired current.

FYI2: THe pureists here will point out that an LED
has a characteristic forward voltage drop of 1.5 to
3.0 volts.  To be 100% accurate this should be taken
into the account in the calculation of the resistor.
In actual practice it doesn't really matter. All you
are trying to do is light the damn LEDs up. It matters
little the the current level is actually a few points
lower than calculated.

LEDs require the _current_ to be restricted - typically 15ma maximum.
The voltage across the LED is fixed, typically about 2.1 volts.
With that information you can work out for any _DC_ supply voltage what
value of resistor is required to drop the excess voltage at that value
of current.
The bigger the difference in voltage between supply and LED requirement
the better the current regulation will be so the more constant the light
output.
It's more complicated than just sticking a light bulb across a suitable
voltage, but it's also more versatile.

If a resistor is the correct solution. he didn't specify why he wanted a

couple other posters surmised, suggesting he might find something else
entiorely a better solution to his problem.

Er, I don't think that suggesting that someone learn what he needs to
know to enjoy this hobby is being elitist. Elitist would be to suggest
that he hasn't a hope of ever understanding it, which I don't think is
the case at all - he does know that resistors can be used to drop
voltage, after all, so he already knows about half of what he needs to
know. :-)

&gt;&gt; No!!!   What he doesn't need, is for folks like you to imply to him
&gt;&gt; that his original request was complete enough for an intelligent
&gt;&gt; answer. It wasn't. The replies have been as gentle as possible for a
&gt;&gt; basically NONSENSE question.

&gt; OK, so it's true he didn't give us enough information. Are you
&gt; suggesting a) beating him over the head for being an idiot or b) asking
&gt; him for more information? Most of the responses I've seen so far tend
&gt; towards a) is all I'm saying.
">

No, he doesn't deserve a beating, and while the responses could have
been plainer, about what was missing in the way of information needed, I
didn't think them impolite, or trying to infer that he was an 'Idiot'
for asking the way he did. (He definitly wasn't in the 'Idiot' category
when he thought of this group as a resource for finding the answer.)
What I 'flipped' at, was the implied "there was enough information for
answering his specific question' tone to your posting. Maybe the first
answers 'danced around the problem' enough that the 'communication fog'
obscured things a bit, but thats how I read your posting.
