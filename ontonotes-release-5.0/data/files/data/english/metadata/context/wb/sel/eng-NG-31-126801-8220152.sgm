Last fall, the generations-old battle against incineration in Toronto
celebrated what is perhaps its most significant victory to date. In
the face of convincing claims that the trash-burning technology is now
cleaner and greener than the primitive toxic-spewing machines of the
past - not to mention a viable source of energy (it can now turn your
trash into electricity) - those who want to continue sending our
garbage to the landfill while dramatically cutting back on the amount
of trash we make in the first place claimed success when the City of
Toronto agreed to purchase the London-based Green Lane Landfill.

As Mayor David Miller and the rest of Toronto's city council wrangled
over the details of the Green Lane purchase, other regions in the
Greater Toronto Area were busy devising plans to build incinerators of
their own, preferring instead to call them by one of their new
monikers, such as Energy From Waste (EFW) or &quot;waste-to-energy&quot;
facilities. If they all get built, Toronto will be surrounded.
Hamilton, Niagara, Halton, York and Durham have all been considering
burning their trash instead of burying it, while Peel Region has been
operating an incinerator in Brampton for more than 10 years.

In truth, the anti-incinerator activists' success may be short-lived.
Brewing plans in the GTA are the tip of the iceberg, and despite a
mayor who remains steadfast in his refusal to consider the technology,
Toronto's fight against incineration isn't over yet. Will the Big
Smoke be able to continue to resist the lure of a machine that
promises to make our garbage disappear with little or no cost to our
health and the environment? The temptation to jump on the trash-
burning bandwagon is strong. Companies touting the technology have a
lot to gain financially, not to mention a lot of cash to invest in
consultants and health-risk assessments. The more regions in Ontario
that build incinerators, the more difficult it will be for Toronto to
find truly sustainable solutions to deal with its trash.

In early June, there was hope that incineration plans in the GTA were
dying on the drawing board as regions retreated from partnerships
needed to breathe life into building new costly &quot;waste-to-energy&quot;
plants. York Region was the first to pull the plug. Instead of paying
for half the cost of building a possible $250 million garbage-burning
machine with the neighbouring region of Durham, it announced it would
now only pick up 12 per cent of the tab.

A few days later, Halton Region voted unanimously to kill plans for an
incinerator there, citing health concerns and their ability to pursue
other options, such as organic waste diversion (that is, the green bin
program) and the continued use of their landfill, which they expect to
last at least another 20 years. The next day, Niagara met with
Hamilton to confirm their desertion of an incinerator-building
partnership. Everyone seemed to be following Toronto's lead.

But the promise of even greater technological advancements to come
means that none of these plans are really dead. Halton's Chair Gary
Carr says his region will revisit the idea of building an incinerator
in five years, while York's Director of Waste Management, Andy
Campbell, expects his region to be an equal partner with Durham in the
future once other options run out. York's most recent plans involve
transforming their waste into pellets to ship elsewhere to be burned
for energy.

It's hard to fight incineration's allure when our own provincial and
federal governments are helping to foot the bill to research those new
advances in technology. Ottawa and Queen's Park have invested $6.5
million and $4 million respectively in a pilot project experimenting
with the use of &quot;plasma-arc&quot; technology to vaporize garbage and
produce electricity with relatively low emissions. Plasco Energy
Group, the company behind the Ottawa-based project claims that no
smokestack is necessary, that the cost of processing waste will remain
low and that a by-product from the plant called slag may be used in
construction.

Governments don't want to get left behind. Premier Dalton McGuinty has
relaxed Environmental Assessment laws to make it easier for pilot
projects like this to move forward. His hope is that Ontario will one
day become a leader in incineration technology and reap the financial
rewards. &quot;There are fewer greenhouse gases, fewer toxic emissions, so
I think that's something we should be exploring,&quot; he was quoted as
saying in the Toronto Star.

But while promises of lower toxic emissions are enticing, they also
work to shift the focus of the debate, ultimately making it more
difficult for Toronto to get other levels of government to commit to
helping them reach necessary trash-diversion goals. According to Paul
Connett, a chemistry professor at St. Lawrence University in Canton,
New York, air quality should be the least of our concerns. &quot;It simply
does not make sense to spend so much money destroying resources that
we should be sharing with the future,&quot; he says. &quot;Sustainability
absolutely dwarfs toxicity at this point.&quot;

As the argument goes, burning our trash makes it easier to continue
draining our nonrenewable resources and provides a disincentive to
finding ways to reuse or recycle products. Believing that our trash
can be made to disappear pollution-free and create energy to boot, we
can pitch things without guilt - not bothering to recycle or find
other uses for a particular item won't hurt anybody; better yet, it
will help light our homes.

But the new plants' energy-producing benefits are suspect as well.
Take the life of a plastic bag. First, we extract fossil fuels from
the earth, which we then ship to plants that manufacture the bags. The
newly produced bags are then trucked to various locations where they
are given out and used for a few minutes before being thrown in the
trash can. After all that shipping and manufacturing and trucking, the
bags are hauled to an incinerator, where a small amount of the energy
that was used to make the plastic bag in the first place is
recovered.

As long as the province and a number of regions in Ontario fixate on
the question of emissions instead of sustainability, Toronto will have
a hard time advocating for the legislative changes needed to reduce
waste. In fact, the province's dearth of action when it comes to
regulating things such as packaging has already affected Toronto's
ability to reach its goals. The city quietly abandoned its aim to
divert 100 per cent of the garbage it sends to the landfill by 2010
(the goal is now 70 per cent).

&quot;It's simply not possible to achieve [100 per cent diversion] right
now,&quot; says Gord Perks, who fought incineration for nearly 20 years as
a member of the Toronto Environmental Alliance before winning a seat
on city council last year. &quot;It requires legislative authority that
municipalities don't have.&quot;

Unfortunately for Toronto, it's the province that has the power to ban
packaging and products from the marketplace or develop creative
programs like the Beer Store's bottle-return system and, politically,
it's easier to build an incinerator than, say, piss off the plastics
industry.

&quot;The zero-waste approach requires community and industrial
responsibility and good leadership to bring it together, but more
often than not, the sole focus is put on the community - we're
expected to perform somersaults to deal with industries' waste,&quot; says
Connett. &quot;The great news is that whenever companies try to reduce
waste, the standard report back is that they save money. Xerox in
Europe is recovering 95 per cent of all materials and parts in their
copying machines. You would think it was costing them an arm and a
leg. It's saving them $76,000,000 a year.&quot;

Connett also points to places such as Nova Scotia, which has built
facilities to screen the waste headed to the landfill. Understanding
exactly what's in our trash can help drum up better ideas for
diverting it down the road. Everyone should be doing this, he says.
But the more the province and its regions are wooed by promises of a
relatively easy, guilt-free way to deal with our garbage, the less
likely they're going to be open to participating in projects such as
this. The challenge for anti-incinerator activists in Toronto and
elsewhere looms large. The battle against burning our waste isn't over
yet.
