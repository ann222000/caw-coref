At the same time, when the EF130 was developed at Junkers, another
delta bomber design was under work. This design seemed also to be a
cooperation between Hertel and the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fur
Segelflug - DFS. This long range bomber was a complete independed
design from the EF130 and it was three times larger than the EF130.
The center wing of this wing-only design got a diameter of 3,90 meters
and was used as the the bomb or cargo compartment. The engines were
integrated into the rear wing section and an air inlet was available
at the front side of the fuselage below the cockpit section.

Due to the end of WWII this project seemed not to have reached the
final design phase and therefore no type designator seemed to be
allocated to this project. It also seems, as if Hertel was already
thinking of a post war aircraft design for civil applications, as some
sources mention this aircraft also as a passenger and cargo aircraft.

You were expecting aren't to look at a Nazi design skeptically? Not a

Dan,

It is only a Projekt aircraft and the stats are estimates as the craft
was never built. WHY is it that you

a) have to label all GERMAN designs as &quot;Nazi&quot; (since the majority of
German civilians and military were NOT members of the Nazi Party)?
Unless, of course, you hate Germans due to your worn out Holocaust
whine. And YES, it is a whine after 62 years. This is not anti-
semitism, but straight annoyance. You have no problem with the killing
of over 30 million Slavs during WW2 nor the killing of over 2 million
German soldiers in the USSR postwar plus all of Stalin's 30 million
murders in the USSR and over 50 million in Communist China.

and

b) Critcise me for posting Luftwaffe Paper Projects, but do not do the
same for other posters that do so nor for any Allied Paper Projects?
Essentially, Scott Lowther's APR material are ALL postwar Allied Paper
Projects and you haven't said shit about him. Consider that much of
his Allied paper is based on German paper as well.

And finally, the info and art is from Luftwaffe '46, so why not
castigate him? He also takes all his material from either Justo
Miranda sources or the &quot;Luftwaffe Secret Projects&quot; series of book, so
why are you not telling him to stop stealing others' works?

That really pisses me off b/c you guys attack me for it while a wide
range of highly &quot;reputable&quot; aviation sites blatantly rip-off published
books and others' material and you guys applaud them. You are
hypocrites.

Rob

p.s. You wanna talk ridiculous? How about the US atomic-powered
postwar a/c, parasite fighters, tailsitters, etc... both in prototype
form, or on paper, they were just as wasteful as the German designs. I
don't hear anything from you knocking those. WHY? Because it has that
&quot;Made in the USA&quot; label on it.

See, there you go making things up again. I don't see anyone pushing
Red Chinese or Soviet weapons systems or racial superiority the way you
do Nazi equivalents. You keep telling us all about how superior German,
most specifically Nazi technology, is and how all good things are of
German origin. You talk about your racial superiority and have told us
the casualties of both world wars were justified because of advances in
German technology. When you boast of SS, Whermacht and Luftawffe
superiority I have told you of the fact the majority of the 30 million
dead Soviets were civilian and you didn't bat an eye.

As I said, you flog your pro German/Nazi agenda and no one at all
does similar for Soviet Union or Red China.

Perhaps because you brag about &quot;raiding&quot; other people's sources. You

It could be because of the sheer volume of your plagiarizing. That's

I don't knock them because no one presents them as wonder weapons the
way you do Nazi designs. You have been known to tell us &quot;if the war had

similar about post war allied programs.

You might consider joining the real world.

LOL

The 17,000km (11,500 miles) range was the magic number required to
reach the USA from Europe and penetrate beyond the east coast
throughout most US airspace.   There was a fair number of design
studies looking at this goal in the final months of the war.  Prior to
that they were regarded as somewhat ludicrous by Erhardt Milch who
headed the Luftwaffe.  The Me 264/6m (also known as the Me 364) being
the only piston aircraft with a serious chance of achieving this
untill the jets.  The Focke Wulf with its Ta 400 struggled as it was
prone to building its aircraft too strong and therefore heavy.   I
can't imagine anything with a piston engine surviving over US airspace
for long.

This projected aircraft was massive at 90 tons with an 8 ton warload.
Assuming an ambitious mass fraction 3:1 It would be carrying about 52
tons of fuel, 8 tons of bomb and 30 tons of structure etc.  Crusing at
900kmh it would need to be consuming fuel at less than 3 tons and hour
which at an sfc of 1.2 requires only about 2.5 tons of thrust on
average.    It would need to be flying very high in thin air on big
wings to achieve that.

The specification quoted above by Rob Arndt states that there are 4
engines in this 90 ton aircraft. I think this is a widely diseminated
mistake and the actual number is 6 or 8.   This was to be a massive
aircraft about 1.5 times the size of a B-47 and 40% the size of the
B-52.  A  6 engine spec appears in Manfred Griehl's &quot;The Luftwaffe
over America&quot; while Herwig and Rodes &quot;Secret Luftwaffe Projects
&quot;Secret Bombers&quot;.&quot;  talks of 4.   Yet when I look at the diagrams
provided it looks like there are 8 not for 4 or 6 engines.    The
specs also state that it had  junkers jumo 109-012 engines.   Anthony
Kay's &quot;German jet engine and gas turbine development states the
following of this engine.
Static Sea Level thrust 2780kp  (6130lb)
Sea Level Thrust @ 900kmh  2200kp (4851lb)
Thrust @ 10000m &amp; 900kmh = 1100kp (2425.5lb)
sfc 1.2.

So if 6 of these engines were running at 50% thrust at 10,000m the
aircraft starts approaching the requisite fuel consumption of less
than 3 tons per hour.

The other alternative engine is the HeS 011 which is a class II engine
and has anticipated thrusts as follows
HeS 011A 1300kp, HeS 011B 1500kp and HeS 011C 1700kp

A 90 ton (MTOW) aircraft would need 8 engines not 4 I feel as a thrust
to weight ratio of something between 0.2 and 0.3:1 would be required.
With only 4 engines it ends up with a T/W of 0.12 which is a little
low I feel.  (A B-47 was 0.22)  Some web sites talk of 6 engines since
the aircraft was supposed to use a variety of engines.  6 x Jumo 012
or 8 x HeS 011 (looking like 4 groups of two which is what is shown in
the diagrams) is plausible.

Flying wings seemed a good way of achieving that long range becuase of
their efficiency.  They also offer lower wing loading and thus
considerably higher service ceiling.  The flying wing doesn't offer
reduced landing speed and comes with the cost of a lot of work in
achieving stability.

The most prominent WW2 German attempt was the Horten XVIII flying wing
while the most prominent US attempt (at lessor range) was Northrops
YB-35 and its jet conversion the YB-49.  Although on the surface they
look the same the Horten and Northrop techniques were quite
different.   The problem with the Norton design is that the Jet
version could not exploit the advantage of the jets due to being
nobbled by its piston heritage while the piston version was slow and
stuck flying in low thick air.

In a normal aircraft the aircrafts wing and weight distribution is
designed to be nose heavy.  The tail plane is designed to provide a
downward force to keep the nose up.   The angle between the two is
called the decalage.  (not quite the same as a ladies bust line that
decollete but it always makes me think of it).  The balance between
the two keeps the aircraft stable.

In Northrops flying wing the wing was given a sweep with about 4
degrees of downward twist at the tips to achieve this downward force
the tailplane otherwise would and thus balance.  The Northrop designes
had some characteristics that came from Northrops philosophical
obsessions that caused some limitations.  First of these was Northrops
insistence that everything fit into the wing.  This forced a very
thick wing section to fit in the engines and limited the speed of the
aircraft.  When converted to jet power the limitation became even more
pronounced.  Normal aircraft have about 2 degrees of wing twist anyway
to ensure the wing tips stall last but the Northrop needed 4 degrees
since it was providing both wing twist for tip stall control but
stability purposes.   In addition slats that opperated with the
undercarriage was installed to prevent the wing tip stall that would
have come from the spanwise flow caused by the sweep.  You will notice
that in photographs of flying Northrop designs that the aircraft tends
to fly with both elevons pointing up in normal flight.  Northrop wing
sections were completely symetrical.

In the designs of the Horten Brothers a different method was used.
The Hortens were OK with localised thickening of the wing to
accomodate engines, crew and bombload so there were less problems with
&quot;Dr Mach&quot;.  Instead of relying entirely on a wing section with sweep
and twist the Horten used a reflexed airfoil in the center section.
This looks like a normal airfoil with an upward sort of ski jump at
the trailing edge that provides the function of a tail plane with
decollage.  This reflexed airfoil technique is what is used to achieve
the flying plank wings without sweep or tailplane.   The wing tips
were symetrical but with about 2 degrees of sweep.  The distribution
of lift alonmg the wing was according to a sinusoid.    Both,
particualry the Northrop, tended to have a sort of phugoid oscilation
that was annoying and could interfere with the A/c being a good gun
and bombing platform.  Northrop developed a stabalising autopilot but
by then it was too late while the Hortens were looking at applying
airbrakes at the momment of gun firing.

There were two versions of the Ho XVIII.   TConstruction of the B-2
version started in the final weeks of the war under orders from
Goering
http://tanks45.tripod.com/Jets45/Histories/HoXVIII/HoXVIII.htm By
this time keel fin was being used since draglerons have mach issues
and it was felt a rudder was required.   This aircraft was to be made
of steel tube, plywood and textiles.

The orginal version http://www.luft46.com/horten/ho18a.html was
rejected due to the internally mounted engines (fire risk, integation
hassles) and because of interference by outsiders trying to take over
the project.

This Junkers long range bomber proposal is plausible:  if it could
have been ready by 1947 its likely performance in the high subsonic
area and what I expect would be a service ceiling of nearly 50,000ft
would have made it difficult to intercept.

Mind you there was little chance of that.   To built an bomber able to
reach the USA Nazi Germany would need to have started work before the
war with the USA started ; about the time the US started work on the
B-36.

&gt;LOL

&gt;The 17,000km (11,500 miles) range was the magic number required to
&gt;reach the USA from Europe and penetrate beyond the east coast
&gt;throughout most US airspace.   There was a fair number of design
&gt;studies looking at this goal in the final months of the war.  Prior to
&gt;that they were regarded as somewhat ludicrous by Erhardt Milch who
&gt;headed the Luftwaffe.  The Me 264/6m (also known as the Me 364) being
&gt;the only piston aircraft with a serious chance of achieving this
&gt;untill the jets.  The Focke Wulf with its Ta 400 struggled as it was
&gt;prone to building its aircraft too strong and therefore heavy.   I
&gt;can't imagine anything with a piston engine surviving over US airspace
&gt;for long.

&gt;This projected aircraft was massive at 90 tons with an 8 ton warload.
&gt;Assuming an ambitious mass fraction 3:1 It would be carrying about 52
&gt;tons of fuel, 8 tons of bomb and 30 tons of structure etc.  Crusing at
&gt;900kmh it would need to be consuming fuel at less than 3 tons and hour
&gt;which at an sfc of 1.2 requires only about 2.5 tons of thrust on
&gt;average.    It would need to be flying very high in thin air on big
&gt;wings to achieve that.

&gt;The specification quoted above by Rob Arndt states that there are 4
&gt;engines in this 90 ton aircraft. I think this is a widely diseminated
&gt;mistake and the actual number is 6 or 8.   This was to be a massive
&gt;aircraft about 1.5 times the size of a B-47 and 40% the size of the
&gt;B-52.  A  6 engine spec appears in Manfred Griehl's &quot;The Luftwaffe
&gt;over America&quot; while Herwig and Rodes &quot;Secret Luftwaffe Projects
&gt;&quot;Secret Bombers&quot;.&quot;  talks of 4.   Yet when I look at the diagrams
&gt;provided it looks like there are 8 not for 4 or 6 engines.    The
&gt;specs also state that it had  junkers jumo 109-012 engines.   Anthony
&gt;Kay's &quot;German jet engine and gas turbine development states the
&gt;following of this engine.
&gt;Static Sea Level thrust 2780kp  (6130lb)
&gt;Sea Level Thrust @ 900kmh  2200kp (4851lb)
&gt;Thrust @ 10000m &amp; 900kmh = 1100kp (2425.5lb)
&gt;sfc 1.2.

&gt;So if 6 of these engines were running at 50% thrust at 10,000m the
&gt;aircraft starts approaching the requisite fuel consumption of less
&gt;than 3 tons per hour.

&gt;The other alternative engine is the HeS 011 which is a class II engine
&gt;and has anticipated thrusts as follows
&gt;HeS 011A 1300kp, HeS 011B 1500kp and HeS 011C 1700kp

&gt;A 90 ton (MTOW) aircraft would need 8 engines not 4 I feel as a thrust
&gt;to weight ratio of something between 0.2 and 0.3:1 would be required.
&gt;With only 4 engines it ends up with a T/W of 0.12 which is a little
&gt;low I feel.  (A B-47 was 0.22)  Some web sites talk of 6 engines since
&gt;the aircraft was supposed to use a variety of engines.  6 x Jumo 012
&gt;or 8 x HeS 011 (looking like 4 groups of two which is what is shown in
&gt;the diagrams) is plausible.

&gt;Flying wings seemed a good way of achieving that long range becuase of
&gt;their efficiency.  They also offer lower wing loading and thus
&gt;considerably higher service ceiling.  The flying wing doesn't offer
&gt;reduced landing speed and comes with the cost of a lot of work in
&gt;achieving stability.

&gt;The most prominent WW2 German attempt was the Horten XVIII flying wing
&gt;while the most prominent US attempt (at lessor range) was Northrops
&gt;YB-35 and its jet conversion the YB-49.  Although on the surface they
&gt;look the same the Horten and Northrop techniques were quite
&gt;different.   The problem with the Norton design is that the Jet
&gt;version could not exploit the advantage of the jets due to being
&gt;nobbled by its piston heritage while the piston version was slow and
&gt;stuck flying in low thick air.

&gt;In a normal aircraft the aircrafts wing and weight distribution is
&gt;designed to be nose heavy.  The tail plane is designed to provide a
&gt;downward force to keep the nose up.   The angle between the two is
&gt;called the decalage.  (not quite the same as a ladies bust line that
&gt;decollete but it always makes me think of it).  The balance between
&gt;the two keeps the aircraft stable.

&gt;In Northrops flying wing the wing was given a sweep with about 4
&gt;degrees of downward twist at the tips to achieve this downward force
&gt;the tailplane otherwise would and thus balance.  The Northrop designes
&gt;had some characteristics that came from Northrops philosophical
&gt;obsessions that caused some limitations.  First of these was Northrops
&gt;insistence that everything fit into the wing.  This forced a very
&gt;thick wing section to fit in the engines and limited the speed of the
&gt;aircraft.  When converted to jet power the limitation became even more
&gt;pronounced.  Normal aircraft have about 2 degrees of wing twist anyway
&gt;to ensure the wing tips stall last but the Northrop needed 4 degrees
&gt;since it was providing both wing twist for tip stall control but
&gt;stability purposes.   In addition slats that opperated with the
&gt;undercarriage was installed to prevent the wing tip stall that would
&gt;have come from the spanwise flow caused by the sweep.  You will notice
&gt;that in photographs of flying Northrop designs that the aircraft tends
&gt;to fly with both elevons pointing up in normal flight.  Northrop wing
&gt;sections were completely symetrical.

&gt;In the designs of the Horten Brothers a different method was used.
&gt;The Hortens were OK with localised thickening of the wing to
&gt;accomodate engines, crew and bombload so there were less problems with
&gt;&quot;Dr Mach&quot;.  Instead of relying entirely on a wing section with sweep
&gt;and twist the Horten used a reflexed airfoil in the center section.
&gt;This looks like a normal airfoil with an upward sort of ski jump at
&gt;the trailing edge that provides the function of a tail plane with
&gt;decollage.  This reflexed airfoil technique is what is used to achieve
&gt;the flying plank wings without sweep or tailplane.   The wing tips
&gt;were symetrical but with about 2 degrees of sweep.  The distribution
&gt;of lift alonmg the wing was according to a sinusoid.    Both,
&gt;particualry the Northrop, tended to have a sort of phugoid oscilation
&gt;that was annoying and could interfere with the A/c being a good gun
&gt;and bombing platform.  Northrop developed a stabalising autopilot but
&gt;by then it was too late while the Hortens were looking at applying
&gt;airbrakes at the momment of gun firing.

&gt;There were two versions of the Ho XVIII.   TConstruction of the B-2
&gt;version started in the final weeks of the war under orders from
&gt;Goering
&gt; http://tanks45.tripod.com/Jets45/Histories/HoXVIII/HoXVIII.htm By
&gt;this time keel fin was being used since draglerons have mach issues
&gt;and it was felt a rudder was required.   This aircraft was to be made
&gt;of steel tube, plywood and textiles.

&gt;The orginal version http://www.luft46.com/horten/ho18a.html was
&gt;rejected due to the internally mounted engines (fire risk, integation
&gt;hassles) and because of interference by outsiders trying to take over
&gt;the project.

&gt;This Junkers long range bomber proposal is plausible:  if it could
&gt;have been ready by 1947 its likely performance in the high subsonic
&gt;area and what I expect would be a service ceiling of nearly 50,000ft
&gt;would have made it difficult to intercept.

&gt;Mind you there was little chance of that.   To built an bomber able to
&gt;reach the USA Nazi Germany would need to have started work before the
&gt;war with the USA started ; about the time the US started work on the
&gt;B-36.

Hey, just think what we could have done post-war with a Bristol Brabazon
powered by Napier Nomad engines - we could have bombed Tokyo from
Scampton...

Too bad about the Brabazon. It started out as a Bristol response to
the early 1940s British &quot;Victory Bomber&quot; project :

IIRC, that was around 50 tons. Bristol countered with investigations

&gt; &gt;engines in this 90 ton aircraft. I think this is a widely diseminated
&gt; &gt;mistake and the actual number is 6 or 8.   This was to be a massive
&gt; &gt;aircraft about 1.5 times the size of a B-47 and 40% the size of the
&gt; &gt;B-52.  A  6 engine spec appears in Manfred Griehl's &quot;The Luftwaffe
&gt; &gt;over America&quot; while Herwig and Rodes &quot;Secret Luftwaffe Projects
&gt; &gt;&quot;Secret Bombers&quot;.&quot;  talks of 4.   Yet when I look at the diagrams
&gt; &gt;provided it looks like there are 8 not for 4 or 6 engines.    The
&gt; &gt;specs also state that it had  junkers jumo 109-012 engines.   Anthony
&gt; &gt;Kay's &quot;German jet engine and gas turbine development states the
&gt; &gt;following of this engine.
&gt; &gt;Static Sea Level thrust 2780kp  (6130lb)
&gt; &gt;Sea Level Thrust @ 900kmh  2200kp (4851lb)
&gt; &gt;Thrust @ 10000m &amp; 900kmh = 1100kp (2425.5lb)
&gt; &gt;sfc 1.2.

&gt; &gt;So if 6 of these engines were running at 50% thrust at 10,000m the
&gt; &gt;aircraft starts approaching the requisite fuel consumption of less
&gt; &gt;than 3 tons per hour.

&gt; &gt;The other alternative engine is the HeS 011 which is a class II engine
&gt; &gt;and has anticipated thrusts as follows
&gt; &gt;HeS 011A 1300kp, HeS 011B 1500kp and HeS 011C 1700kp

&gt; &gt;A 90 ton (MTOW) aircraft would need 8 engines not 4 I feel as a thrust
&gt; &gt;to weight ratio of something between 0.2 and 0.3:1 would be required.
&gt; &gt;With only 4 engines it ends up with a T/W of 0.12 which is a little
&gt; &gt;low I feel.  (A B-47 was 0.22)  Some web sites talk of 6 engines since
&gt; &gt;the aircraft was supposed to use a variety of engines.  6 x Jumo 012
&gt; &gt;or 8 x HeS 011 (looking like 4 groups of two which is what is shown in
&gt; &gt;the diagrams) is plausible.

&gt; &gt;Flying wings seemed a good way of achieving that long range becuase of
&gt; &gt;their efficiency.  They also offer lower wing loading and thus
&gt; &gt;considerably higher service ceiling.  The flying wing doesn't offer
&gt; &gt;reduced landing speed and comes with the cost of a lot of work in
&gt; &gt;achieving stability.

&gt; &gt;The most prominent WW2 German attempt was the Horten XVIII flying wing
&gt; &gt;while the most prominent US attempt (at lessor range) was Northrops
&gt; &gt;YB-35 and its jet conversion the YB-49.  Although on the surface they
&gt; &gt;look the same the Horten and Northrop techniques were quite
&gt; &gt;different.   The problem with the Norton design is that the Jet
&gt; &gt;version could not exploit the advantage of the jets due to being
&gt; &gt;nobbled by its piston heritage while the piston version was slow and
&gt; &gt;stuck flying in low thick air.

&gt; &gt;In a normal aircraft the aircrafts wing and weight distribution is
&gt; &gt;designed to be nose heavy.  The tail plane is designed to provide a
&gt; &gt;downward force to keep the nose up.   The angle between the two is
&gt; &gt;called the decalage.  (not quite the same as a ladies bust line that
&gt; &gt;decollete but it always makes me think of it).  The balance between
&gt; &gt;the two keeps the aircraft stable.

&gt; &gt;In Northrops flying wing the wing was given a sweep with about 4
&gt; &gt;degrees of downward twist at the tips to achieve this downward force
&gt; &gt;the tailplane otherwise would and thus balance.  The Northrop designes
&gt; &gt;had some characteristics that came from Northrops philosophical
&gt; &gt;obsessions that caused some limitations.  First of these was Northrops
&gt; &gt;insistence that everything fit into the wing.  This forced a very
&gt; &gt;thick wing section to fit in the engines and limited the speed of the
&gt; &gt;aircraft.  When converted to jet power the limitation became even more
&gt; &gt;pronounced.  Normal aircraft have about 2 degrees of wing twist anyway
&gt; &gt;to ensure the wing tips stall last but the Northrop needed 4 degrees
&gt; &gt;since it was providing both wing twist for tip stall control but
&gt; &gt;stability purposes.   In addition slats that opperated with the
&gt; &gt;undercarriage was installed to prevent the wing tip stall that would
&gt; &gt;have come from the spanwise flow caused by the sweep.  You will notice
&gt; &gt;that in photographs of flying Northrop designs that the aircraft tends
&gt; &gt;to fly with both elevons pointing up in normal flight.  Northrop wing
&gt; &gt;sections were completely symetrical.

&gt; &gt;In the designs of the Horten Brothers a different method was used.
&gt; &gt;The Hortens were OK with localised thickening of the wing to
&gt; &gt;accomodate engines, crew and bombload so there were less problems with
&gt; &gt;&quot;Dr Mach&quot;.  Instead of relying entirely on a wing section with sweep
&gt; &gt;and twist the Horten used a reflexed airfoil in the center section.
&gt; &gt;This looks like a normal airfoil with an upward sort of ski jump at
&gt; &gt;the trailing edge that provides the function of a tail plane with
&gt; &gt;decollage.  This reflexed airfoil technique is what is used to achieve
&gt; &gt;the flying plank wings without sweep or tailplane.   The wing tips
&gt; &gt;were symetrical but with about 2 degrees of sweep.  The distribution
&gt; &gt;of lift alonmg the wing was according to a sinusoid.    Both,
&gt; &gt;particualry the Northrop, tended to have a sort of phugoid oscilation
&gt; &gt;that was annoying and could interfere with the A/c being a good gun
&gt; &gt;and bombing platform.  Northrop developed a stabalising autopilot but
&gt; &gt;by then it was too late while the Hortens were looking at applying
&gt; &gt;airbrakes at the momment of gun firing.

&gt; &gt;There were two versions of the Ho XVIII.   TConstruction of the B-2
&gt; &gt;version started in the final weeks of the war under orders from
&gt; &gt;Goering
&gt; &gt; http://tanks45.tripod.com/Jets45/Histories/HoXVIII/HoXVIII.htm By
&gt; &gt;this time keel fin was being used since draglerons have mach issues
&gt; &gt;and it was felt a rudder was required.   This aircraft was to be made
&gt; &gt;of steel tube, plywood and textiles.

&gt; &gt;The orginal version http://www.luft46.com/horten/ho18a.htmlwas
&gt; &gt;rejected due to the internally mounted engines (fire risk, integation
&gt; &gt;hassles) and because of interference by outsiders trying to take over
&gt; &gt;the project.

&gt; &gt;This Junkers long range bomber proposal is plausible:  if it could
&gt; &gt;have been ready by 1947 its likely performance in the high subsonic
&gt; &gt;area and what I expect would be a service ceiling of nearly 50,000ft
&gt; &gt;would have made it difficult to intercept.

&gt; &gt;Mind you there was little chance of that.   To built an bomber able to
&gt; &gt;reach the USA Nazi Germany would need to have started work before the
&gt; &gt;war with the USA started ; about the time the US started work on the
&gt; &gt;B-36.

&gt; Hey, just think what we could have done post-war with a Bristol Brabazon
&gt; powered by Napier Nomad engines - we could have bombed Tokyo from
&gt; Scampton...
">

If anyone ever wants to build that engine I'll contribute anyway I
can.  Without the jet we would have been winging our way
across the Atlantic and Pacific propelled by giant diesels.   The war
interrupted some great civil aircraft concepts that were
in every way as audacious as the B-29 and B-36.

Longest range bomber proposal I've ever come across is the Lippisch
Messerschmitt P.80.01 flying wing
with a range of 16871 miles.   I''m sure there were others though.

Sorry Euno, but the Me P.08.01 had a range of 17,023 miles only as a
recon a/c; as a maritime bomber with a 44,080 load, that range was
reduced to 10, 948 miles and only 1,550 miles as a tactical bomber
with 110,200 lb bombload. To accomplish this, it would have been
powered by 4x DB 9-615 coupled engines and 88,160 lbs of fuel.

The numbers you gave come from the Sept 1941 specifications and I am
providing the final data that Dan Johnson left out.

That also is NOT the longest projected range projekt as the Feb 22,
1945 Heinkel 60 ton bomber would have had a range of 17,388 miles with
6,612 lb bombload. It was reported by Gunter to US Army Intel in Oct
1945.

The Me P.1073A also would have carried a 13,224 lb bomb load plus 3
parasite fighters to a range of 11,147 miles and weighed over 141
tons- making it the largest land-based a/c of the time had it been
built. Power would have come from 8x 2,240 hp Jumo 223 tandems in four
nacelles with push-pull arrangement.

- Luftwaffe Secret Projects: Strategic Bombers 1935-1945

p.s. An expanded LSW series in coming out with 40% more projects and
better illustrations. I suppose Dan Johnson will be copying that as
soon as it is avialable.

Dan,

Would you please stop your stupid games with tenses? Most books on
German projects and sites use the tense &quot;had&quot; even when no weapon was
built. Since the entire premise and context of these books and sites
are KNOWN to be projected weapons, the use of past tense relates more
to the historic timeline of the proposals- most of which came in the
last year of the war.

There is no reason to substitute &quot;would have&quot; when dealing with
projekt a/c- only dummies like you take everything literally.

And if you wanna talk technicalities, the designs HAD this or that-
not an actual machine.

Again, grow up. The same past tense usage is found with Allied
projects too.

Rob

p.s. I again note that you are incapable of actually participating in
the aviation content, just adding your pithy comments and nitpicking
grammar games.

It's not a matter of tense, past, future, present, pluperfect or any
other kind. It's a matter of lying to the reader. If you had said
something similar about a U.S. or Allied aircraft I would have asked the
same thing: how many were built and flown.

I can't help it if &quot;other project aircraft&quot; books present projected,
estimated or design performance data as fact. It doesn't mean you have
to also. Try adding the qualifier &quot;estimated&quot; to your performance data.

If you were in a room full of people drilling into their own heads
with power drills would you do the same? It doesn't make any more sense
either.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Dan,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Would you please stop your stupid games with tenses? Most books on
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; German projects and sites use the tense &quot;had&quot; even when no weapon was
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; built. Since the entire premise and context of these books and sites
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; are KNOWN to be projected weapons, the use of past tense relates more
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to the historic timeline of the proposals- most of which came in the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; last year of the war.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; There is no reason to substitute &quot;would have&quot; when dealing with
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; projekt a/c- only dummies like you take everything literally.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; And if you wanna talk technicalities, the designs HAD this or that-
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; not an actual machine.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Again, grow up. The same past tense usage is found with Allied
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; projects too.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Rob
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p.s. I again note that you are incapable of actually participating in
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the aviation content, just adding your pithy comments and nitpicking
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; grammar games.
&gt; &gt;&gt;    Nothing I said was a &quot;nitpicking grammar game.&quot; You presented
&gt; &gt;&gt; performance data which would lead one to assume at least one example was
&gt; &gt;&gt; built. That's why I asked.

&gt; &gt; My advice then is to go out and purchase a range of project aircraft

&gt; &gt; this was an Allied project, I don't think you would have said anything
&gt; &gt; at all IMHO.

&gt; &gt; Rob

&gt;     It's not a matter of tense, past, future, present, pluperfect or any
&gt; other kind. It's a matter of lying to the reader. If you had said
&gt; something similar about a U.S. or Allied aircraft I would have asked the
&gt; same thing: how many were built and flown.

&gt;     I can't help it if &quot;other project aircraft&quot; books present projected,

&gt; to also. Try adding the qualifier &quot;estimated&quot; to your performance data.

Dan,

You are a fucking idiot- seriously. You can't comprehend that the
projects were from WW2 and therefore- the past. All given data was
from the past. Past tense is perfectly acceptable and if you are going
to criticise me, then why did you not do so for Euno who posted the
Luftwaffe 46 URL- which is written in the past tense with the same
basic data?

Are you going to say something to Euno or write to Dan Johnson of
Luftwaffe '46?

The answer is no. You just wanna talk some shit about me.

The book authors do not care about your opinion on the matter, neither
do the site owners, and neither do I.

Go bother someone else with your pettiness.

It is a bit of a shame that post-war cheap aviation fuel knocked out
such kit as the Nomad.  I saw a graph (can't find it now) which showed
the efficiency of the Nomad compared to other engines; piston, turbo-

would not be a bad thing to look at today, given the global warming
thing.

I was pointed to a couple of pictures of the last surviving Nomad (on

very nice - only to be wheeled into a museum storeroom.  Not a runner
though - the innards had been removed.

Thanks,  looks like the Avro Atlantic would have been the sonic
cruiser of its day.  Interestingly the Junkers long range bomber
project, like several of these projects arrising out of the 1945
reichsmarhshall conference talk about using these aircraft as long
range airliners on the Berlin to New York route?   Why were they

I suspect this page may have incorrect data for the Vulcan B2 fuel
capacity, nevertheless

Vulcan B2 carried 9250 Imperial gallons:=  38.5 cubic meters.
Wing Area was 3964 sq feet which works out to about 368.2 sq meters.
This means the tanks were about 10.5cm deep on average though those
diagrams suggest that the leading edge intakes and the undercarriage
used up nearly half the wing volume.
The wing cross sections were a symmetrical:
Avro 698 Vulcan root NACA 0010 mod tip NACA 0008 mod so at the root
the wing would have been about 6 feet thick!

The rear half of the Vulcan engines were suspended below the wing like
the concord  but leading edge intakes would have consumed much space
that could have been used for tankage.  Had the engines been suspended
concord style a great improvement in fuel carriage would have been
possible since this constitutes the most voluminous and thickest part
of the wing.  It's possibly a mod that could have been achieved using
of the shelf parts from concord!

As far as the Junkers long range bomber proposal.   The aircraft to me
looks more like it was designed as a flying wing rather than a delta.
This is a flying wing thickened at the center to accommodate crew,
engines, intakes and war-load which achieves a sort of blended wing
body concept.   This combined with wings free of intakes would thus
achieve an enormous internal fuel capacity and I therefore think that
the phenomenal range of the aircraft of over 17000km is probably
achievable in theory.   The thickening might have cost some top speed
while the fact that it was more a flying wing than a delta might have
mach limited it to about M0.85 or so due to mach tuck.

I think there are some sound engineering  and historical reasons.
Both in Germany and the UK both axial and centrifugal flow engines
were under development at the start of the 1940.  Heinkel Hirth worked
on centrifugal compressor based engines that had a single sided
impellor that were charged by an inductor fan while whittle rolls/
royce worked in centrifugal compressors with a double sided impellor
and a quite implausible airflow path.  At BMW, Junkers and Latter at
Heinkel  axial flow engines came under development.  Also a
Metropolitan Vickers an axial engine was under development.

The primary reason that Helmuth Schelp pushed jet engine development
into the direction of axial flow engines is to reduce frontal area and
allow easy integration into the airframe.  Initially the Me 262 was to
have had its engines mounted at the wing roots.

In the UK it was decided to concentrate on centrifugal compressors
because of their far more tractable characteristics.  As it turned out
the German engines suffered from control issues (the compressors are
less linear)  more than the British ones (both initially had burnouts)
while the Meteor was delayed by airframe integration issues created by
the bigger engines.

For the Germans there was trepidation about long intake ducts leading
to excessive pressure losses and also fear of non circular ducts
leading to compressor problems hence these concerns helped to drive
the positioning of the engines, the type of intakes and even promoted
flying wings and tailless aircraft.

Suspending the engines from pods was driven by not only the structural
ease  (the meteor needed forged rear spar to bypass around the wings)
but from the ease of access for service.  One very significant factor
was the level of protection from fire this provided in the high strung
early engines.

In the Ju 287 testbed, notable for its forward swept wings, the
engines were for the first time suspended from pods the purpose of
this was not only to counterbalance the sweep of the wings moreover to
provide a sort of pendulum that damped out possible wing flutter.  The
idea was used in the Boeing B-47.   George Schaierer, the chief
aerodynamicist of Boeing (and designer of the B-29) was enthusiastic
about the German wartime aerodynamic data.  The Russians also
benefited from the German research, virtually taking the entire

Eventually German proposals also did gravitate towards engines buried
in the wings as intakes and compressors behavior was better
understood.  One of the engines; the Heinkel Hirth HeS 011 had a
diagonal compressor in the first stage, this was a sort of hybrid
centrifugal compressor with an axial flow outlet that combined the
best features of both types and led to some very pretty proposals
since the engine was narrow enough to be buried in the wing and
tolerant of turbulence so that fairly challenging intake
configurations could be used.

The British of course digested the German swept wing data but seem to
have gone their own way.  The most prominent influence I can think of
is the crescent wing of the HP victor which had some input from the
Arado 234 crescent wing that the aerodynamicist Rudiger Kosin and
Walter Lehmann had developed.  The idea being that the benefits of
wing sweep are available at the highly swept wing roots but that mild
sweep with a thin wing section is used at the tips to take advantage
of the better handling of such wings and avoid the negative effects of
spanwise flow.  HP aerodynamicists Geoffrey Lee and Reginald Stafford,
who had been working on a crescent wing, were so impressed when the
German research they incorporated it into the HP.80 (later Victor).

Having said that the abillity of the centrifugal engines to handle
turbulence doesn't seem to have been a factor in the intakes of
aircraft like the Hunter and Javelin since these had axial flow
engines.

Burried engines seem to have fallen out more due to the extra
engineering effort required to integrate them than any other reason.

I believe they also turned out to be significantly more difficult to
maintain than podded engines- procedures that you could do just by
opening a panel on a pod-mounted engine required opening up the wing
in a buried-engine jet.  Led to maintainance taking longer and costing
more, which is something that can really add up over the lifetime of
an airframe.

Just a note here.  The Junkers Jumo 004 initially only used a
centrifugal
governor to control engine rpm via fuel flow.  I suspect the welland
was
the same.   Because airflow is not directly related to rpm and because
the governor would not limit the fuel sufficiently when a demand for
an
rpm increase was called the early engines could overheat and shed

The MiG 15 also bent the airflow around the cockpit.
One wonders why they bothered with a nose intake.

I think even the front spar went in front of the airflow in the
Meteor.

Bending the ducts didn't turn up in any German
designes I'm aware of untill the HeS 011 started being
incorporated in designs presumably due to the diagonal
compressor.

One interesting feature seen in the junkers EF128 and
Messerschmitt P.1112 V1 March 30 was split intakes
with boundary layer suction.   In the P.1112 a 200hp
suction compressor drew of a thin layer of boundary
layer air.  This allowed the ducts to be designed in
accordance with a sort of 'area rule' that the
German aerodynamicists had discovered as well
as conforming to another major concern of the RLM.
Placing ducts that would not present the intake
to gunfire.  The Junkers EF128 passively ejected the air
behined the cockpit; sort of looks like a Saab Grippen.

The P.1112 reached mockup stage and the boundary layer
system was tested in a wind tunnel.

It was just as likely to become the 'new' Luftwaffe light weight
fighter as
the Ta 183, BV.212 and P.1101 in any Luft46 scenario

&gt;&gt; &gt;I think there are some sound engineering  and historical reasons.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Both in Germany and the UK both axial and centrifugal flow engines
&gt;&gt; &gt;were under development at the start of the 1940.  Heinkel Hirth worked
&gt;&gt; &gt;on centrifugal compressor based engines that had a single sided
&gt;&gt; &gt;impellor that were charged by an inductor fan while whittle rolls/
&gt;&gt; &gt;royce worked in centrifugal compressors with a double sided impellor
&gt;&gt; &gt;and a quite implausible airflow path.

&gt;&gt; That is a beautiful description of the Whittle concept...

&gt;&gt; ('Improbability drive' even...)

&gt;The infinite improbability version didn't arrive till Allen Bond's
&gt;SABRE engine.

&gt;&gt; &gt;At BMW, Junkers and Latter at
&gt;&gt; &gt;Heinkel  axial flow engines came under development.  Also at
&gt;&gt; &gt;Metropolitan Vickers an axial engine was under development.

&gt;&gt; Which infamously destroyed a Meteor in January 1944...

&gt;&gt; &gt;The primary reason that Helmuth Schelp pushed jet engine development
&gt;&gt; &gt;into the direction of axial flow engines is to reduce frontal area and
&gt;&gt; &gt;allow easy integration into the airframe.  Initially the Me 262 was to
&gt;&gt; &gt;have had its engines mounted at the wing roots.

&gt;&gt; &gt;In the UK it was decided to concentrate on centrifugal compressors
&gt;&gt; &gt;because of their far more tractable characteristics.  As it turned out
&gt;&gt; &gt;the German engines suffered from control issues (the compressors are
&gt;&gt; &gt;less linear)  more than the British ones (both initially had burnouts)
&gt;&gt; &gt;while the Meteor was delayed by airframe integration issues created by
&gt;&gt; &gt;the bigger engines.

&gt;Just a note here.  The Junkers Jumo 004 initially only used a
&gt;centrifugal
&gt;governor to control engine rpm via fuel flow.  I suspect the welland
&gt;was
&gt;the same.   Because airflow is not directly related to rpm and because
&gt;the governor would not limit the fuel sufficiently when a demand for
&gt;an
&gt;rpm increase was called the early engines could overheat and shed

&gt;&gt; &gt;For the Germans there was trepidation about long intake ducts leading
&gt;&gt; &gt;to excessive pressure losses and also fear of non circular ducts
&gt;&gt; &gt;leading to compressor problems

&gt;&gt; Interesting concern when you look at how British aircraft made bending
&gt;&gt; the air the norm - the Gloster-Whittle split the intake flow around the
&gt;&gt; cockpit, the Vampire wing-root intakes inhibited the airflow to a
&gt;&gt; degree, and the Sea Hawk split the air going in and the gas coming out.
&gt;&gt; Only the Meteor had anything like 'straight through'.

&gt;The MiG 15 also bent the airflow around the cockpit.
&gt;One wonders why they bothered with a nose intake.

&gt;I think even the front spar went in front of the airflow in the
&gt;Meteor.

&gt;Bending the ducts didn't turn up in any German
&gt;designes I'm aware of untill the HeS 011 started being
&gt;incorporated in designs presumably due to the diagonal
&gt;compressor.

&gt;One interesting feature seen in the junkers EF128 and
&gt;Messerschmitt P.1112 V1 March 30 was split intakes
&gt;with boundary layer suction.   In the P.1112 a 200hp
&gt;suction compressor drew of a thin layer of boundary
&gt;layer air.  This allowed the ducts to be designed in
&gt;accordance with a sort of 'area rule' that the
&gt;German aerodynamicists had discovered as well
&gt;as conforming to another major concern of the RLM.
&gt;Placing ducts that would not present the intake
&gt;to gunfire.  The Junkers EF128 passively ejected the air
&gt;behined the cockpit; sort of looks like a Saab Grippen.

&gt;The P.1112 reached mockup stage and the boundary layer
&gt;system was tested in a wind tunnel.

&gt;It was just as likely to become the 'new' Luftwaffe light weight
&gt;fighter as
&gt;the Ta 183, BV.212 and P.1101 in any Luft46 scenario

&gt;&gt; &gt; hence these concerns helped to drive
&gt;&gt; &gt;the positioning of the engines, the type of intakes and even promoted
&gt;&gt; &gt;flying wings and tailless aircraft.

&gt;&gt; I think de Havilland shared the same concern of long gas paths at least
&gt;&gt; in part when you look at the minimum inlet and outlet space of the
&gt;&gt; Vampire.

&gt;The boom and pod approach is also a solution.  The vampire used
&gt;a Goblin (axial flow?) I think.

The first generation of air to air missiles could not hit anything,

The second generation of air to air missiles could hit the target; but
only with the target's extreme co-operation.

The third generation of air to air missiles - whoosh, zap, aaaaargh!

No problem Dave,

That Jets 45 site is just like Luftwaffe 46- a favorite reference for
people that like to think they discovered someplace special and that
their newly aquired knowledge from those sites somehow enables them to
become an aviation elitist :)

When I go to those sites, all I notice is everything ELSE that is
MISSING from them ;)

However, for those with a lesser knowledge of rare a/c and technology,
those sites are a giant leap forward. To people like me, they are
basic information sites.

My favorite part of Jets 45 is that they do incorporate one German
disc there- the BMW Flugelrad I V-1... which is interesting, b/c that
development came from a previous disc- Rudolf Schriever's Flugkreisel
jet disc-fan. BMW was to provide the BMW 003 jets for the Flugkreisel;
but in the end, the designers used five kerosene jets (3 on the rim
plus 2 on the sides) that made a horrible whine. BMW got pissed and
then produced in-house designs for a disc-fan on a smaller scale that
used BMW 003 jets and in the last model would have used two BMW 018s!
These were the Flugelrad I-III designs.

While testing was performed at Prag-Kbely Aerodrome, in the end the
discarded Flugkreisel was spotted there too! Disc-fan technology was
horribly unstable.

My website in not a direct competitor to Luftwaffe 46 as we deal in
different topics altogehter. He is promoting Luftwaffe paper projects
(along with experimentals and prototypes) while I am promoting SS E-IV
and other German disc craft chronology/technology and aerial oddities.
Other categories are purely promotional for hoaxes, faked a/c, humor,
etc...

Between the two of us, we share maybe six a/c- all of which are
annular, circular, or circular wing and my pages are superior to his
with more photos, information, illustrations, artwork, patents in some
cases, etc...

Since there are hundreds if not thousands of Luftwaffe paper projects
it is more than obvious with his 100+ entries that Dan Johnson is way
off and when he does update, he is taking info right out of the
Luftwaffe Secret Project book series. So Scott, buy just those 3 books
and you can plainly see he is nowhere near the actual number plus all
sub-variants.
Fact.

Your APR work also cannot possibly cover all of world aerospace
postwar and I need not mention any particular a/c project since you do
not have thousands to post.

As for Jets 45- they post a diverse blend of operational,
experimental, prototype, and some designed jet projects that range
from some pre-war, to WW2, and into slight postwar jet technology.
They pick and choose the best representatives for each nation, but do
not present all types.

I pointed out one Flugelrad model, but they are missing a range of
German test a/c with jets, more German jet discs, and even some rare
German jet engine proposals- and that is just one nation.

I think you get my point.

BTW, since you and your space fans have been run off this NG and with
your failure to draw any interest in your APR material, is this what
you intend to do every week- visit with some space OT bs or try to
attack my posts?

If you really want to get into rare a/c from the entire world, then go
through my archive of all 6300+ entries. That will keep you busy for
some time.

When my Rare Aircraft book at Black Sun gets rolling by the end of
summer you will see in actual photographs 400 rare a/c just for
starters in Volume 1. How many &quot;drawings&quot; do you have for all your
cumulative APR issues? Do you have 400 entries? I bet not... and
photos of real a/c are superior to illustrations.

So long Scott...

Rob

Dave, please excuse the insertion here...I'm not much interested (nor

error that I do know a little about so this might help someone down
the road somewhere.

The Goblin 2 turbine engine installed in the Vampire was not an axial
flow type. It was centrifugal flow.

I had joined the RCAF in May 1951 as an Aero Engine Technician and
that was the jet engine that we were taught on. We took one completely
apart then reassembled it under the watchful eyes of many instructors.
We then installed it in a Vampire, took it out to the ramp and did a
full runup on it (each one of us had a turn with the runup). Then we
did the same with the R-985 in the Harvard.

Hope this helps.

On the Luftwaffe 46 site itself anyone can read that Dan Johnson has
posted 220 a/c there with 20 or so that are prototypes and
expertimentals that really have nothing to do with paper projects. So
that leaves approx. 200 a/c.

On his own attempted master list of German projects, you only have to
get to the second manufacturer (Blohm und Voss) before the number
reaches 237 a/c (along with Arado). I didn't count the rest of his ref
numbers, but he didn't finish with all the manufactuers and I don't
believe he includes all versions or sub-variants of all projects.

I guess he will catch up when he compiles all the information from
Master's &quot;German Jet Genesis&quot;, Miranda's &quot;Reichsdream Dossiers&quot;, and
the complete &quot;Luftwaffe Secret Projects&quot; book series. I am not making
fun of Dan, I am serious- those seem to be the sources he is using as
he is even scanning right out of the latter book series (which is in
print). No doubt, when the new and improved versions come out this
year with 40% more info, then the numbers will expand more.

So, he is way off by hundreds to easily over 1,000 depending on how
many versions and sub-variants one counts in the paper trail. Many of
the paper projects had anywhere from 3-11 versions and variants. (Fw
Ta 183 had 3 versions, Ar E.555 had 11)!

This information is not trivial either as the accumulated captured
German aerospace documents ran into the thousands of tons at Wright
Field in 1946.

And these are just the declassified &quot;known&quot; projects.

Unlike Luftwaffe 46, my site deals with all German disc development
and other aerial oddities that no one else has. Furthermore, I am
pretty sure that I alone have all the projects known as the former 8
famous disc writers from 1955-present only have a combined 2/3rds of
my book.

Sorry, but those are the facts.

&gt;Master's &quot;German Jet Genesis&quot;, Miranda's &quot;Reichsdream Dossiers&quot;, and
&gt;the complete &quot;Luftwaffe Secret Projects&quot; book series. I am not making
&gt;fun of Dan, I am serious- those seem to be the sources he is using as
&gt;he is even scanning right out of the latter book series (which is in
&gt;print). No doubt, when the new and improved versions come out this
&gt;year with 40% more info, then the numbers will expand more.

&gt;So, he is way off by hundreds to easily over 1,000 depending on how
&gt;many versions and sub-variants one counts in the paper trail. Many of
&gt;the paper projects had anywhere from 3-11 versions and variants. (Fw
&gt;Ta 183 had 3 versions, Ar E.555 had 11)!

&gt;This information is not trivial either as the accumulated captured
&gt;German aerospace documents ran into the thousands of tons at Wright
&gt;Field in 1946.

&gt;And these are just the declassified &quot;known&quot; projects.

&gt;Unlike Luftwaffe 46, my site deals with all German disc development
&gt;and other aerial oddities that no one else has. Furthermore, I am
&gt;pretty sure that I alone have all the projects known as the former 8
&gt;famous disc writers from 1955-present only have a combined 2/3rds of
&gt;my book.

&gt;Sorry, but those are the facts.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;MISSING from them ;)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Then by all means, please post the link to your website where

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;filled in all the blanks. Oh, and make sure to cite all your source
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;documentation.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Since there are hundreds if not thousands of Luftwaffe paper projects
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;it is more than obvious with his 100+ entries that Dan Johnson is way
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;off

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Hundreds to thousands&quot; is a vague and handwavy set. Enough so that a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; set of  &quot;100+ entries&quot; could well largely encompass the first set.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The fact that I have no remedy for all the sorrows of the world is no
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;reason for my accepting yours. It simply supports the strong
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;probability that yours is a fake. - H.L. Mencken- Hide quoted text -

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;On the Luftwaffe 46 site itself anyone can read that Dan Johnson has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;posted 220 a/c there with 20 or so that are prototypes and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;expertimentals that really have nothing to do with paper projects. So
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;that leaves approx. 200 a/c.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;On his own attempted master list of German projects, you only have to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;get to the second manufacturer (Blohm und Voss) before the number
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;reaches 237 a/c (along with Arado). I didn't count the rest of his ref
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;numbers, but he didn't finish with all the manufactuers and I don't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;believe he includes all versions or sub-variants of all projects.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I guess he will catch up when he compiles all the information from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Master's &quot;German Jet Genesis&quot;, Miranda's &quot;Reichsdream Dossiers&quot;, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the complete &quot;Luftwaffe Secret Projects&quot; book series. I am not making
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;fun of Dan, I am serious- those seem to be the sources he is using as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;he is even scanning right out of the latter book series (which is in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;print). No doubt, when the new and improved versions come out this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;year with 40% more info, then the numbers will expand more.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;So, he is way off by hundreds to easily over 1,000 depending on how
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;many versions and sub-variants one counts in the paper trail. Many of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the paper projects had anywhere from 3-11 versions and variants. (Fw
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Ta 183 had 3 versions, Ar E.555 had 11)!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;This information is not trivial either as the accumulated captured
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;German aerospace documents ran into the thousands of tons at Wright
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Field in 1946.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;And these are just the declassified &quot;known&quot; projects.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Unlike Luftwaffe 46, my site deals with all German disc development
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and other aerial oddities that no one else has. Furthermore, I am
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;pretty sure that I alone have all the projects known as the former 8
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;famous disc writers from 1955-present only have a combined 2/3rds of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;my book.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Sorry, but those are the facts.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; How many times do you have to be told that nobody but you cares how many

&gt;&gt; &gt;Peter,

&gt;&gt; &gt;Who cares what you think?

&gt;&gt; One or two people have said complimentary things about me in the past.
&gt;&gt; Your opinion of what I post isn't worth very much.

&gt;One or two people? What a joke. I have had hundreds of people
&gt;compliment me on my site refs, pics, answers to their questions.
&gt;etc... over the 9 years I've been here. It would seem that your
&gt;comments are even less significant by comparison :)

There you go again, waving your willy about, claiming it's bigger than
anyone else's.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt;BTW, NOBODY tells me what to do here.

&gt;&gt; Oh, stop stamping your foot! I'm not telling you what to do, just making
&gt;&gt; an observation. Sensible people have been known to take note of what
&gt;&gt; others say and modify their behaviour accordingly.

&gt;So, you let others dictate your behavior on a regular basis? Ok then,
&gt;Peter... would you kindly jump off a bridge?

Your comprehension matches your arrogance.

&gt;&gt; &gt;I'll post anything I please and my comments to Scott Lowther were

&gt;&gt; No surprise there as far as the first part of the sentence is
&gt;&gt; concerned..

&gt;No, he challenged me and I answered back. What I said was true. Mr.
&gt;Space NG Guy is not going to come into my NG and tell me about all the
&gt;a/c I have posted on in 9 years vs his stupid sketches of lately and
&gt;his poor attempt to solicit APR sales.

&gt;&gt; &gt;You deal with people who attack your posts, and I will take care of my

&gt;&gt; As far as I can remember, the only person who has attacked me is you.

&gt;Then you haven't been on this NG long enough or else post very little.
&gt;All the vets have been slammed by someone. And this is Usenet which is
&gt;synonomous with abuse ;)

True, I do post comparatively little. I don't have time to sit at a
keyboartd for hours on end nor do the book research required. I only
post when I feel I have something to contribute.

What a miserable view of the world. I did say 'As far as I can
remember'. There other news groups in which I have had heated exchanges,
but they usually don't qualify as attacks IMO.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I think de Havilland shared the same concern of long gas paths at least

&gt; &gt;&gt;The boom and pod approach is also a solution.  The vampire used
&gt; &gt;&gt;a Goblin (axial flow?) I think.

&gt; &gt;Indeed...

&gt;  big snip

&gt; Dave, please excuse the insertion here...I'm not much interested (nor
&gt; knowledgeable) about the subject of this post, but I see a glaring
&gt; error that I do know a little about so this might help someone down
&gt; the road somewhere.

&gt; The Goblin 2 turbine engine installed in the Vampire was not an axial
&gt; flow type. It was centrifugal flow.

&gt; I had joined the RCAF in May 1951 as an Aero Engine Technician and
&gt; that was the jet engine that we were taught on. We took one completely
&gt; apart then reassembled it under the watchful eyes of many instructors.
&gt; We then installed it in a Vampire, took it out to the ramp and did a
&gt; full runup on it (each one of us had a turn with the runup). Then we
&gt; did the same with the R-985 in the Harvard.
">

The DeHaviland Goblin was as you say a centrifugal flow jet however it
differed from the Whitle/Rolls-royce style double sided impellor and
had only a single sided impellor.  In its americanised form it powered
the P-80.   I believe its development by Frank Halford was relatively
independant of Whittle which is why I thought it was axial.

The abilliy of such engines to be relatively indifferent to intake
turbulence was of great benefit.

The German HeS 011 turbojet had a diagonal compressor as its first
stage and three axial stage.  A diagonal compressor is a centrifugal
type with and axial instead of radial outflow so that the airflow can
impinge upon a stator for further compression or use in subsequent
axial stages.   Nice combination of centrifugal ruggedness and axial
low diameter.
