&gt;Oh good, Lester, you're back. I wondered where you'd got to.

&gt;I see you haven't progressed one iota from where you left off last time.
&gt;It's nice to see such consistency.

&gt;Now I don't know whether you appreciate single malts, but if you, I
&gt;suggest that you pour yourself a tot, and a splash of pure spring water
&gt;(or its nearest equivalent), and meditate on the evanescence of all that
&gt;human do or think while you sip that elixir of the gods.

&gt;Good health to you!

Thanks again, Wolf. I thought you might be interested in some remarks
I made recently regarding Aristotle's syllogistic inference.

&gt;Tonico, let me revisit my comments below to present the same analysis
&gt;in slightly different terms.

&gt;If we take some conclusion, C, and want to know if it's true there are
&gt;two different ways to proceed.Aristotelian syllogistic inference bases
&gt;the truth of C on the truth of its constituent premises such as B.  In
&gt;other words it says &quot;if B then C&quot; which is a truism because C would
&gt;certainly be true if B were true.

&gt;However then we're just faced with exactly the same problem with B. So
&gt;we further regress analysis of the truth of C to the truth of B to
&gt;find the truth of B relies on the truth of some constituent premise of
&gt;B such as A with the result that we wind up with &quot;if A then B then C&quot;.

&gt;This is exactly how classical syllogistic inference has always worked
&gt;in the context of science and mathematics. To support the truth of
&gt;some conclusion  such as C there is an indefinite regression of
&gt;problematic premises and this regression is what I call empiricism. In
&gt;ordinary science this regression stops at what would appear a logical
&gt;boundary of sensory and perceptual experience whereas in mathematics
&gt;it stops with axioms and axiomatic assumptions of truth.

&gt;Now this doesn't mean that truisms like &quot;if A then B then C&quot; cannot be
&gt;true only that their truth can never be known in exhaustive terms. The
&gt;most we can hope for is to stumble on some syllogistic regression that
&gt;turns out to be true and employ it to ground further speculations. In
&gt;effect syllogistic regressions such as &quot;if A then B then C&quot; become a
&gt;line of reasoning or in the parlance of modern math a &quot;model&quot; of truth
&gt;because the truth can never be known absolutely with such a method.

&gt;Now I analyze the same problem from exactly the opposite perspective.
&gt;Instead of asserting the truth of C relies on the truth of constituent
&gt;premises I maintain the truth of any conclusion such as C relies on
&gt;the falsity of alternatives to C, in other words what is &quot;not C'.

&gt;Thus we form a tautological regression of &quot;C, not C&quot; instead of the
&gt;syllogistic regression &quot;if A then B then C&quot; and find that C can and
&gt;must be true only if &quot;not C&quot; must be false and &quot;not C&quot; must be false
&gt;only if it is self contradictory.

&gt;In any event I hope this clears up what I mean by empiricism and truth
&gt;in the context of mathematics and science.

&gt;[. . .]

&gt;&gt;&gt;Perhaps it is that we don't really understand what each other means by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;empirical&quot;. For example, what empirical evidence (of what, where,
&gt;&gt;&gt;when...?) does the axiom stating the existence of a unit element in
&gt;&gt;&gt;group theory have? Or the axiom in Topology that states that the empty
&gt;&gt;&gt;set is part of the set of open sets?

&gt;&gt;I agree we don't understand the term &quot;empirical&quot; the same way. Not my
&gt;&gt;fault since I've discussed the subject at length over the past couple
&gt;&gt;years here and elsewhere. Basically any tautologically undemonstrated
&gt;&gt;judgment is empirical. Doesn't matter whether the judgment is sensory,
&gt;&gt;perceptual, cognitive, or whatever. If you assume an axiom such as &quot;a
&gt;&gt;straight line is the shortest distance between points&quot; the assumption
&gt;&gt;is empirical until and unless demonstrated true analytically. The same
&gt;&gt;applies to definitions.

&gt;&gt;Most people completely misunderstand the meaning of an empirical
&gt;&gt;judgment. Most think it means getting out the tape measure, scales,
&gt;&gt;and so forth. The problem originated with Aristotle and his concept of
&gt;&gt;syllogistic inference. Aristotle was history's first empiricist in
&gt;&gt;formal terms. He found he could not establish the truth of any
&gt;&gt;conclusion syllogistically except by regression to further premises
&gt;&gt;whose truth he could not establish either except by further regression
&gt;&gt;ad infinitum. Which meant he could establish no truth syllogistically
&gt;&gt;at all without some kind of true basic premises which he set out to
&gt;&gt;find in unreducible perceptual terms. Which left us epistemologically
&gt;&gt;exactly where we are today in terms of all kinds of mathematical and
&gt;&gt;scientific methodologies.

&gt;&gt;In point of fact however empirical judgment is nothing more than input
&gt;&gt;to a process of tautological regression whose ultimate goal is
&gt;&gt;reduction to self contradictory alternatives. That's how the mind and
&gt;&gt;brain work, tautological rather than syllogistic inference because it
&gt;&gt;can produce reductions to truth in exhaustive mechanical terms.

The Mind
~v~~

Well let's see if we can circumscribe the idea of the mind as distinct
from the brain a little more closely, Bob.

Let's just suppose we have the brain here inside us and we have things
like A and B outside us.And further let's suppose the brain mechanizes
(not A not B) as I have just demonstrated. Now the question becomes
whether (not A not B) is "out there" or "in here". And I think you'd
have to agree that in purely logical terms (not A not B) would have to
be located partly both "out there" and "in here" if A and B are both
"out there" to begin with. So we might consider that (not A not B) is
both part of the brain and partly not.

However now consider "not(not A not B)". Would that be part of the
brain or not? Clearly we had to go through the brain to get to
"not(not A not B)". And just as clearly we cannot claim that the
actual result is part of the brain since it represents the nexus of "A
and B" outside the brain.Yet the negation of "(not A not B)" takes
place in the brain even though it is "not" of the brain. So we are
forced to conclude there is something else in the brain that is not
just the brain itself as the mechanism of negation in general. And
that "something else" is what I consider the "mind". Of course you may
consider it whatever you wish but I think you have to admit it is
clearly not the brain as it was and cannot explain the brain so.

Now I suspect you are too lame to grasp the implications of such exact
logic. However you really need to work on your game a little if you
ever expect to catch up with the big boys in cognitive science.

Well that's the simple part though.
The difficult part is let
A be your PC,
and let B be a Quasar.
