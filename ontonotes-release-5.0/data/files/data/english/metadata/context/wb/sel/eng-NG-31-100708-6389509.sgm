Appeasing Our Enemies Won't Bring Peace
By Ed Koch

A few days ago, The New York Times published a truly frightening
article on insurgent battlefield tactics in Iraq. The article reported
that "Insurgents are likely to continue combining car bombs with
chlorine gas and other chemicals to launch attacks similar to three in
recent weeks that spewed chlorine and sickened scores of Iraqi, the
military warned Thursday."

Chlorine gas was first used as a weapon by Germany in World War One.
France and Britain responded with poison gas of their own. Their lungs
destroyed, tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides choked to
death. Thousands more were wounded. Gas attacks were so horrible that
neither side used poison gas in World War Two.

But between 1980 and 1988, Saddam Hussein used poison gas against
Iraqi Kurds and against the Iranian army. Iraqi insurgents and al-
Qaeda terrorists have not hesitated to employ the worst tactics of
terror, using car bombs in marketplaces killing and injuring thousands
of innocent Iraqi civilians, as well as torturing and beheading
civilians, American and Iraqi, in their efforts to drive the U.S. out
of Iraq. Now they are using chlorine gas. Are they practicing tactics
to use against us here at home?

When the U.S. leaves Iraq, as the Democrats promise they will force
President Bush to do, will we face the prospect of emboldened
Jihadists, with the cry of "God is Great" on their lips, blowing
Americans up here in the States? If terrorists explode radioactive
bombs and tank trucks of chlorine gas in American cities, or worse
still, full-fledged nuclear weapons, what will our reaction be? Will
we be like the English and Spanish who, when their commuter trains
were blown up in London and Madrid, rolled over and surrendered to
terrorist demands?

In response to terror attacks on its soil, Spain withdrew its troops
from Iraq and changed its government. Britain's Labor Party repudiated
its leader, Prime Minister Tony Blair, ordering him to resign by next
September, as well as beginning the reduction of its military forces
in Iraq. Those forces, once totaling 40,000, are now less than 8,000
and scheduled to largely be withdrawn between now and 2008. Both
President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice referred to
these announced British withdrawals as planned, acceptable to the U.S.
and a victory over the insurgents and terrorists. That statement, had
it been uttered by Pinocchio, would have lengthened his nose.

Will the next President, Democrat or Republican, respond by
withdrawing our troops in abject fear and sue for peace? What will
peace cost? Perhaps conversion to Islam. Iran's President, Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, and the leaders of al-Qaeda, bin Laden and al-Zawahiri,
have publicly stated all our sins will be forgiven if we convert and
urged President Bush to lead the way with his personal conversion.

Of course, many of those in and out of Congress who have led the
struggle to bring our troops home will laugh at the thought that
conversion of the governmental leaders of the U.S. or the payment of
tribute by the U.S. will ever come to pass. There were many who
believed they could tame Hitler who laid his plans out in detail in
Mein Kampf before the beginning of the projected 1,000 year reign of
the Third Reich -- a Third Reich brought to an end, through the
combined efforts of the U.S., Great Britain and the U.S.S.R. But the
cost was horrendous. More than 400,000 American service men and women
died, along with 382,000 British soldiers and ten million Russian
soldiers. Millions of civilians were killed around the world.

And yet, despite all the horror and carnage of the past, we don't
appear to be learning from history. We don't seem to remember that
appeasement never works. It didn't work at Munich in 1938 with
Chamberlain's infamous statement that we had achieved "peace in our
time" with Hitler. It won't work now. Promises that it will leave Iraq
have not bought peace for Britain. British authorities now say the
danger of terror attacks inside Britain is greater than ever, with
thousands of home-grown Jihadists ready to attack.

Why won't we take those who threaten us at their word? Why do we
continue to make excuses for their threatening behavior until finally
we will be forced to act because they have exploded the dirty bomb or
the real nuclear bomb in our homeland?

There will come a time when it may be too late to simply respond to an
attack. As a result of such an attack on our homeland, we may be so
physically injured and suffered so many casualties as to cause us to
consider surrender. We may by then have lost our national will as to
make it too difficult for us to muster the moral and physical strength
needed to defend ourselves. Remember the refrain, primarily in Europe
during the Cold War, "better Red than dead?"

Am I painting a too grim a picture? I don't think so. Wake up,
America! This war is not only taking place in Iraq. The struggle is
for the future of the world. Our enemies intend to conquer us, and
they say so openly. The time to resist is now.

The cost has to be weighed against the value of the goal.
Total costs to 'liberate' Iraq are now (with VA costs) estimated to
finally reach 2 Trillion dollars.

Since their were no WMDs in Iraq to begin with, don't you feel that
the cost has been too high?

To answer your second question.. one needs to know what 'the long run'
goals are.
Can you tell us?

You said "neither will making enemies" when you responded to the op.

If we do nothing, they will still hate us.    They might come here and bring
the same hell they have to israel and other places where terrorism has
struck.    You measure cost in money, I measure it in human lives.

Do you know how many human lives each choice has/would have cost?   And what
about them coming here?  Are you saying that we'll need to fight this war
forever to keep them "over there"?  How many of our best and brightest do we
need to toss into this war before they won't come, "over here"?

United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 is a resolution by the
UN Security Council, passed unanimously on November 8, 2002, offering
Iraq "a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations"
that had been set out in several previous resolutions.

On November 8, 2002, the UN passed Resolution 1441 urging Iraq to
disarm or face "serious consequences". The resolution passed with a 15
to 0 vote, supported by Russia, China and France, and Arab countries
like Syria. This gave this resolution wider support than even the 1990
Gulf War resolution. Although the Iraqi parliament voted against
honoring the UN resolution, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein agreed to
honor it.

No WMD were found and Iraq was not a threat.

furthermore, if Saddam had the rest of these stockpiled he would have
used them before he got caught.

this war in Iraq is already lost; it's morphed into a civil war, and
admitting and acepting defeat in front of reality isn't appeasing;
it's called growing up.

IF you care so much about human lives then what about the 100,000
civilians killed in Iraq which had nothing to do with 9/11 which fuels
more recruits for revenge and Al-Qaeda.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Neither will making enemies.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now then.. Which choice costs less?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; question is what will cost more in the long run?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; - Hide quoted text -
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The cost has to be weighed against the value of the goal.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Total costs to 'liberate' Iraq are now (with VA costs) estimated to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; finally reach 2 Trillion dollars.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Since their were no WMDs in Iraq to begin with, don't you feel that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the cost has been too high?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To answer your second question.. one needs to know what 'the long
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; run'
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; goals are.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Can you tell us?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You said &quot;neither will making enemies&quot; when you responded to the op.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Sure.. and I meant that.. 'making enemies will not bring peace'.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Do you disagree?

&gt;&gt; They hate us for the crime of existing.   How do you counter that?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If we do nothing, they will still hate us.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Big woop. Most people actually hate a lot of other people.
&gt;&gt; &gt; The only difference is that they usually have enough self-control to
&gt;&gt; &gt; restrain themselves.

&gt;&gt; When directed by Allah to kill infidels, how do you equate that to 'self
&gt;&gt; control'?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; They might come here

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Might&quot;? Did you say might?
&gt;&gt; &gt; Well.. yeah... anything might happen. It's called Life.

&gt;&gt; So a few dead americans are ok?    What the hell, they would only be
&gt;&gt; republicans, right?

&gt;&gt; &gt; But that's no reason to go killing your neighbors, is it?
&gt;&gt; &gt; Seeing as how they might someday do something bad to you...

&gt;&gt; Who's killing our neighbors.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and bring
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the same hell they have to israel and other places where terrorism has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; struck.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Israel&quot;? and hell... hmmm.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Let's just stick to the US and Iraq, shall we?

&gt;&gt; Terrorism is a world wide threat.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You measure cost in money, I measure it in human lives.

&gt;&gt; &gt; So did I (just didn't mention it).

&gt;&gt; No, you just snowed over it.

&gt;&gt; &gt; So then... 3,100+ US lives and 30,000 serious injuries were worth
&gt;&gt; &gt; finding no WMDs in Iraq?

&gt;&gt; idiot, 1441.    Look it up.

&gt; United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 is a resolution by the
&gt; UN Security Council, passed unanimously on November 8, 2002, offering
&gt; Iraq &quot;a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations&quot;
&gt; that had been set out in several previous resolutions.

&gt; On November 8, 2002, the UN passed Resolution 1441 urging Iraq to
&gt; disarm or face &quot;serious consequences&quot;. The resolution passed with a 15
&gt; to 0 vote, supported by Russia, China and France, and Arab countries
&gt; like Syria. This gave this resolution wider support than even the 1990
&gt; Gulf War resolution. Although the Iraqi parliament voted against
&gt; honoring the UN resolution, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein agreed to
&gt; honor it.

&gt; No WMD were found and Iraq was not a threat.

Then what did Iraq have to fear from inspections?
What did they have to fear from the United Nations?

&gt; Appeasing Our Enemies Won't Bring Peace
&gt; By Ed Koch

&gt; A few days ago, The New York Times published a truly frightening
&gt; article on insurgent battlefield tactics in Iraq. The article reported
&gt; that &quot;Insurgents are likely to continue combining car bombs with
&gt; chlorine gas and other chemicals to launch attacks similar to three in
&gt; recent weeks that spewed chlorine and sickened scores of Iraqi, the
&gt; military warned Thursday.&quot;
">

and what would YOU do if your homeland were invaded by a militarily superior
foreign nation .... and YOU, the defenders of your own nation, were called
"insurgents".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Chlorine gas was first used as a weapon by Germany in World War One.
&gt; France and Britain responded with poison gas of their own. Their lungs
&gt; destroyed, tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides choked to
&gt; death. Thousands more were wounded. Gas attacks were so horrible that
&gt; neither side used poison gas in World War Two.

&gt; But between 1980 and 1988, Saddam Hussein used poison gas against
&gt; Iraqi Kurds and against the Iranian army. Iraqi insurgents and al-
&gt; Qaeda terrorists have not hesitated to employ the worst tactics of
&gt; terror, using car bombs in marketplaces killing and injuring thousands
&gt; of innocent Iraqi civilians, as well as torturing and beheading
&gt; civilians, American and Iraqi, in their efforts to drive the U.S. out
&gt; of Iraq. Now they are using chlorine gas. Are they practicing tactics
&gt; to use against us here at home?

&gt; When the U.S. leaves Iraq, as the Democrats promise they will force
&gt; President Bush to do, will we face the prospect of emboldened
&gt; Jihadists, with the cry of &quot;God is Great&quot; on their lips, blowing
&gt; Americans up here in the States? If terrorists explode radioactive
&gt; bombs and tank trucks of chlorine gas in American cities, or worse
&gt; still, full-fledged nuclear weapons, what will our reaction be? Will
&gt; we be like the English and Spanish who, when their commuter trains
&gt; were blown up in London and Madrid, rolled over and surrendered to
&gt; terrorist demands?

&gt; In response to terror attacks on its soil, Spain withdrew its troops
&gt; from Iraq and changed its government. Britain's Labor Party repudiated
&gt; its leader, Prime Minister Tony Blair, ordering him to resign by next
&gt; September, as well as beginning the reduction of its military forces
&gt; in Iraq. Those forces, once totaling 40,000, are now less than 8,000
&gt; and scheduled to largely be withdrawn between now and 2008. Both
&gt; President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice referred to
&gt; these announced British withdrawals as planned, acceptable to the U.S.
&gt; and a victory over the insurgents and terrorists. That statement, had
&gt; it been uttered by Pinocchio, would have lengthened his nose.

&gt; Will the next President, Democrat or Republican, respond by
&gt; withdrawing our troops in abject fear and sue for peace? What will
&gt; peace cost? Perhaps conversion to Islam. Iran's President, Mahmoud
&gt; Ahmadinejad, and the leaders of al-Qaeda, bin Laden and al-Zawahiri,
&gt; have publicly stated all our sins will be forgiven if we convert and
&gt; urged President Bush to lead the way with his personal conversion.

&gt; Of course, many of those in and out of Congress who have led the
&gt; struggle to bring our troops home will laugh at the thought that
&gt; conversion of the governmental leaders of the U.S. or the payment of
&gt; tribute by the U.S. will ever come to pass. There were many who
&gt; believed they could tame Hitler who laid his plans out in detail in
&gt; Mein Kampf before the beginning of the projected 1,000 year reign of
&gt; the Third Reich -- a Third Reich brought to an end, through the
&gt; combined efforts of the U.S., Great Britain and the U.S.S.R. But the
&gt; cost was horrendous. More than 400,000 American service men and women
&gt; died, along with 382,000 British soldiers and ten million Russian
&gt; soldiers. Millions of civilians were killed around the world.

&gt; And yet, despite all the horror and carnage of the past, we don't
&gt; appear to be learning from history. We don't seem to remember that
&gt; appeasement never works. It didn't work at Munich in 1938 with
&gt; Chamberlain's infamous statement that we had achieved &quot;peace in our
&gt; time&quot; with Hitler. It won't work now. Promises that it will leave Iraq
&gt; have not bought peace for Britain. British authorities now say the
&gt; danger of terror attacks inside Britain is greater than ever, with
&gt; thousands of home-grown Jihadists ready to attack.

&gt; Why won't we take those who threaten us at their word? Why do we
&gt; continue to make excuses for their threatening behavior until finally
&gt; we will be forced to act because they have exploded the dirty bomb or
&gt; the real nuclear bomb in our homeland?

&gt; There will come a time when it may be too late to simply respond to an
&gt; attack. As a result of such an attack on our homeland, we may be so
&gt; physically injured and suffered so many casualties as to cause us to
&gt; consider surrender. We may by then have lost our national will as to
&gt; make it too difficult for us to muster the moral and physical strength
&gt; needed to defend ourselves. Remember the refrain, primarily in Europe
&gt; during the Cold War, &quot;better Red than dead?&quot;

&gt; Am I painting a too grim a picture? I don't think so. Wake up,
&gt; America! This war is not only taking place in Iraq. The struggle is
&gt; for the future of the world. Our enemies intend to conquer us, and
&gt; they say so openly. The time to resist is now.
