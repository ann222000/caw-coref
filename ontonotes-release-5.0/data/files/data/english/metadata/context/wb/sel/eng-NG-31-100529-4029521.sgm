cost of each.  i see 1 in front and 1 in the rear, but are there more??

These are the roll stoppers. One in the front, one in rear. There's also the
main engine mount next to the cam cover on the LHS that often breaks when
old, and finally the gearbox mount on the RHS.

You front roll stopper is the most likely culprit. Get a used one from a
wrecker 89-92 Eagle 2000 or Galant.

Go to Chrysler and get the part number(s) then head off to the nearest
Mitsubishi dealer and pay 40% less for the same part from the same
warehouse.

There are 4 supports total, one mounted in front of the engine at the top
with the letter "L" shaped metal thing bolted to the front of the engine
block (near where the timing belt cover is), one at the rear and is
mounted to the top of the transmission, and one on either side of the
engine.

Most probably, what's worn on your car are the ones on either side, not
the ones in front and back. Those are vibration dampers/isolators and look
like donuts on lollipop sticks (only bigger). If I were you, I'd replace
all 4 of them all at once since by experience (I've gone through 4
Galants, models '87 to '93), when one of them goes, the other follow close
behind. It would save you a lot of time if you changed them all instead of
doing it one at a time.

If you're a bit short on budget, and if you can live with the noise and
vibrations it'll cause, you can just leave them be and wait until they all
break down. The engine won't fall out anyway regardless of how beat up your
engine mounts are. It'll get darned noisy after a while though...
