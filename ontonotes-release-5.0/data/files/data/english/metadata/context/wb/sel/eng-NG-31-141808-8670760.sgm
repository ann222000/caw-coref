Frustration had overcome Mukasa Willie Ricks, a Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee activist, as he raised a clinched fist in the air
and shouted, &quot;Black power!&quot; with fellow activist Stokely Carmichael.

He shouted what would become a signature phrase for many young black
Americans on June 16, 1966, in Greenwood, Miss., in a watershed moment
for the civil rights movement. Black activists like Ricks and Carmichael
decided it was time to abandon Martin Luther King Jr.'s nonviolent
philosophy for a more militant and aggressive campaign to gain equality.

&quot;It was a time of frustration,&quot; Ricks recalled this week. &quot;It was time
for black power. We were fed up with this racism in this country. We had
a fighting attitude.&quot;

As he and other black nationalists converge on Fort Lauderdale today for
Black Power Day, Ricks and other activists say achieving power for black
people remains an unfulfilled goal 40 years later. From 10 a.m. to 7
p.m., they'll discuss various issues at the Von D. Mizell Center, 1509
Sistrunk Blvd.

Some of them, like Ricks, will be coming from Jena, La. Protesters
gathered there Thursday to support six black high school students who
prosecutors initially charged with attempted murder after a school yard
fight that injured one white student.

Prosecutors have since reduced the charges to second-degree battery and
conspiracy to commit battery, but many blacks think the charges are still
too harsh.

Ricks said the situation in Jena, the presence of many black men and
women on the front lines of the war in Iraq and the plight of thousands
of black men in what he calls &quot;the prison-industrial complex&quot; are
evidence that black people are still oppressed in 2007.

&quot;We're in more trouble now than we were then,&quot; Ricks opined. &quot;We're just
as oppressed. The conditions are the same. Black power is just as
necessary today as it was 40 years ago.&quot;

Today's event is the 10th Black Power Day in Fort Lauderdale, according
to its founder, Kwame Afoh, who explained that the purpose of the day is
to &quot;organize African people in South Florida and worldwide for liberation
and self-determination.&quot;

Participants will discuss reparations for slavery, education, the prison
system, health and nutrition, the black family, economics, politics and
African roots.

But while Ricks and Afoh argue the conditions remain oppressed for many
black people, 21st-century black power is different from the call
Carmichael and Ricks made 41 years ago.

Black political power has grown significantly in the past four decades,
according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. In
1970, there were only 469 black elected officials. That number has grown
to more than 10,000 in 2007.

Sociologist Art Evans of Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton said
the nation has changed and black people have made progress in just about
every aspect of society.

&quot;There's been tremendous growth in the black middle class,&quot; Evans said.
&quot;In the 1960s less than 3 percent of blacks were middle-class; today, 37
percent of blacks are middle-class.

&quot;Things are not the same as they were in the past,&quot; Evans continued.

&quot;There's a lot of assimilation, blacks leaving the community, living in
the suburbs and participating in predominantly white areas.&quot;

Despite the progress Evans and others cite, &quot;We still don't have the
control over our lives,&quot; Afoh said.

Which begs the question: What is black power in 2007?

According to Afoh, black power is a misnomer. He prefers to talk about
African power, but the original phrase was so powerful that it stuck and
now encompasses people of African descent worldwide.

Radical organizations that will attend Black Power Day here include the
Provisional Government of the Republic of New Afrika, which urges racial
separatism and wants the United States to turn over five southern states,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, for
occupation by all black Americans in a separate country.

Also attending will be representatives of the National Coalition of
Blacks for Reparations in America (N'COBRA). The group advocates payment
to all black Americans who suffer from the legacy of slavery and legal
segregation by the U.S. government.

Nonetheless, the model for ethnic groups in the United States has been
assimilation, Evans said.

Other ethnicities melted into the dominant society. It also has been
happening with blacks, but at a slower pace, he said.

&quot;If blacks want to find out more about their roots,&quot; Evans said, &quot;go to
Europe. The government and values are based on European ideas. Capitalism
and the foundation of America are in Europe.&quot;

Bob Balogh, a white retiree and veteran of the civil rights movement who
lives in Boynton Beach, said the term &quot;black power&quot; never scared him.

&quot;I think of economic power,&quot; he said. &quot;There aren't enough black banks
and black entrepreneurs. Black power is taking control of your destiny.&quot;
