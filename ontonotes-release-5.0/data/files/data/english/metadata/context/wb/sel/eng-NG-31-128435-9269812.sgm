This message is mostly for Tony Teolis, but I'm cc-ing the Usual
Suspects.

Tony, I gather that the March yesterday drew only a few hundred
people.  I am of course sorry to hear that.  But I'm not surprised.
Nor should you be.

Among those of us struggling -- we certainly can't call it a
&quot;movement&quot;, because we are too disparate and resist any attempt
at cooperation -- many of us try the same thing over and over
again.  &quot;Let's have a march!&quot;  &quot;Let's have a demo!&quot;  &quot;Let's put
a full-page ad in the NY Times!&quot;  &quot;Let's a panel discussion!&quot;

I think we all should consider a little why these ideas don't
have much resonance for the Average American(whoever she is).
It is very simple: they have been tried over and over and
they don't work.  They don't rouse people, they have no
visible effect.

So some of us are doing new things.  Some of the most dedicated
anti-war and impeachment activists I know missed your march
yesterday, Tony.  Why?  because they were at a big county fair
out in Virginia, manning a table, speaking to people.(**) Why
don't other vets get out and meet the people?

Debbie Tolson leads a movement to reach into schools.  She is getting
out and meeting people.

As you all know, I am part of an activity which has had lots and
lots of success.   We get out and meet the people, we raise money,
we are increasingly visible.  I don't write more about it, because
y'all have heard me dozens of times.

There are undoubtedly other things that can and hence should be done.
Let's give marches and demos and panel discussions and ads a rest.
Let's think of ways to reach out to people.

Alan

(**) (Now if Tony was among them --
this thought just occurred to me! -- I'm going to be mighty
embarrassed)

SPEAKING OF FOCUSING/SPECIALIZING:  As a First Amendment
warrior of many years' standing, I suggest that we rally
behind Unka Alan at his trial scheduled for Thursday, Oct.
25 (at 8:30 a.m. - ugh!) in the District Court of Maryland
for Montgomery County (24 Courthouse Square, Rockville, Md.
-- Room 302).  If there be a public sidewalk near the
courthouse, we might wish to bring a supply of IMPEACH HIM
yard signs and other posters of protest against this
attempted railroading of &quot;Kensington's Public Enemy No. 1.&quot;
Of course, as Alan's surety for that appearance, I'm
required to show up for the actual trial.  So, I won't have
much of a chance to help demostrate outside the building
prior to the trial.  Wouldn't it be great to see (on TV) a
sea of Code Pinkers parading back and forth on the sidewalk
that morning -- injecting a Halloween-styled dose of
shame/fear into the hearts of those who would dare subvert
the First Amendment? -- O-ver and O-ut

&gt; It all works; it all matters.  Hats off to Tony and the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; other organizers.

&gt; My only suggestion is that we each pick one issue and we
&gt; latch on to it, rather than floating from week to week
&gt; grasping at different straws.  It reminds me of James
&gt; Thurber's, &quot;Snapshot of a Dog.&quot;  In it, Rex, an American
&gt; bull terrier, never picked fights, but when he was drawn
&gt; into one, usually by a much larger dog, he would clench
&gt; his teeth onto the other dog's ear and not let go.
&gt; Thurber says some epic fights lasted for hours and in one
&gt; fight the fire department had to be sent and a powerful
&gt; stream of water turned on the dogs for several moments
&gt; before Rex let go.

What is the actual address of the courthouse?  Would a permit be required to
gather across the street or nearby with our IMPEAH HIM signs?  Would this
help or hinder the case in court?

These are important matters to consider.  I intend to be there in whatever
capacity of support is deemed best.

I actually wonder if it wouldn't be better to gather as citizens that day,
each of us wearing proudly the IMPEACH HIM button on our lapels and sitting
in the courtroom in quiet respectful citizen's support.

You take 100 people with the button on their lapel showing up at the
courthouse and sitting down respectfully.  Is that not a movement?

YIKES, I realize that I misspoke the address of &quot;24
Courthouse Square.&quot;  The correct number is 27.  Otherwise, I
have no knowledge of the lay of the land there.  Given that,
it may indeed be advisable to skip an actual demonstration
in favor of merely packing the courthouse with spectators.
Of course, we could stage a PRESS CONFERENCE near the
courthouse steps after the judge enters a ruling.  I defer
to the judgment of Alan and whoever volunteers to organize
the action.  -- OO

To my kind and interested friends:

The date of the trial is Oct 25.  The time is set for 8:30,
which, based on past experience, I take as a &quot;cattle call&quot;; for a
venial offense like trespass, the court calls masses of cases,
and runs through them as fast as possible, mostly getting guilty
pleas, or plea-bargains.  I'm going to ask my lawyers, who I will
see later this week, to ask for a firm time, say 10:30 that
morning, citing the unusual nature of the case, its controversial
nature, and public interest.  I'll let you all know what happens.

I'll also let you all know about what my lawyers and the ACLU advise
about protests.  My personal feeling, again based on experience, is
that a courtroom with 20-30 people, with grave attentive demeanours,
and all wearing our &quot;I M P E A C H   H I M&quot; buttons, is likely to be
the best.

The honchos at ACLU-DCA office downtown, with whom I had a very nice
meeting a month ago, and for whom I have developed increasing respect,
are meeting with Mayor Fosselman on Thursday.  It is, as most of you
know, ACLU policy to meet with the opposing party to try to work out
a settlement.  The ACLU people know that they are not my lawyers,
but they and my lawyers know that I'm not averse to a settlement,
as long as I get everything I want&lt;G&gt;.  Which is: the right to sell
our buttons at our old stand in the Kensington parking lot, where we
did very well for 15 months, before the Town hit on the idea that
I was a Menace to Public Safety.

I shall keep you all posted at things develop.  If you have questions,
comments, or suggestions, let me/us hear them.  In the meantime, get
out there and sell buttons! and get yard signs installed!

Best wishes,

Alan

Here is where I wish I could get you to change your mind.  Every

out in a visible enduring way.

We must never forget that our fellow citizens are with us.  I
_know_ this, because I've been out there and seen 'em, and
interacted with hundreds of them.   We must give them a chance
to speak out.  And that's what buttons and yard signs are all
about.

Again my apologies, to you, Tony, and to the rest of the people I'm
cc-ing.   And if I can be any help in your educational work, Tony, I
hope you'll let me know.
