More Specific

Part 1

I hear them.  Every Friday night, it's the same  thing.   I
can hear them through the wall.

My bed and Kyle's bed are opposite eachother  with  a  thin
wall separating them.  I can hear his  head-board  knocking
against the wall.  It's rhythmic and would be soothing if I
didn't hear the moans and gasps that came with the rhythmic
smacking.  I'm already nude.

My boxers are down near my feet and my shirt is crumpled up
next to me.  I guess it's a good thing  that  Kyle  and  me
have rooms on the first floor and not the second.

If that were the case, I'm damn sure that mom and dad would
hear the things that go on under their very noses.  And I'm
damn sure they wouldn't  approve,  considering  every  good
Catholic is supposed to wait until marriage.  I guess  Kyle
didn't get the memo...

"...Kyle...  Yes..."  I hear Jenna gasp and my cock hardens
slightly at her breathy voice.  The sound is followed by  a
low groan that I just know is Kyle's.  I  fully  harden  at
that.  I guess when it comes down to it, Kyle  and  me  are
both some of the worst Catholics ever.  He fucks  basically
anything with two legs  and  tits;  and  I  get  off  while
listening to him do it.  If anyone  were  to  ever  ask  me
about it, I have a perfect speech planned  out,  "He  fucks
some of the hottest girls around.  If you heard what  those
girls sounded like, trust me, you'd jack-off to it!"   This
such a complete and total lie.  I'm not interested in  what
the girls sound like.  It's  my  brother's  deep,  guttural
moans that really get me going.

And right now, I can hear them.  Kyle  is  groaning  a  lot
now.  After listening to him screw slut  after  slut,  I've
realized that this is how he  sounds  when  he's  about  to
come.  I quickly grab my  dick  and  almost  subconsciously
match the rhythm I hear from the head-board.

The pace is fast, and I'm being rough with myself.  I can't
help it.  I  picture  myself  in  Kyle's  bed.   That  he's
fucking me and not some cheap slut that only wants him  for
popularity status.  I can almost feel him  sliding  in  and
out of me.  He isn't gentle, he could never be gentle  with
someone.  But I would never want it any other way.

I grip my cock until it's almost painful and and  slide  up
and down the shaft.  I swipe my thumb  over  the  sensitive
head and hiss at the feeling.  I'm  getting  closer  and  I
know that Kyle is, too.  The knocking through the  wall  is
getting more frantic, more desperate.  It's over  to  soon,
but not soon enough.  I hear the deep sound tear  it's  way
out of Kyle's chest, and it's too soon.  I  spill  into  my
hand and quickly wipe it on the shirt next to  me.   But  I
know that it was Jenna, and not me in his bed.   It  lasted
to long for me to deal with.

I rollover and try to shut my brain down.  I can  feel  the
guilt in my chest and I know it's wrong, but I  can't  help
it.  I love my brother, but I want him more than  anything.
I would probably give anything for just one night with him.

I hear his bedroom door open and then the front  door  open
and close.  None of them ever stay.  I know from experience
that he won't be back  in  his  room  for  another  fifteen
minutes at least.  He always takes a shower and changes his
sheets before going to bed.  So, it kind  of  surprises  me
when I hear a light knock at my door.

I debate on whether or not I should  say  anything,  but  I
don't have too.  Kyle is already opening the  door  and  at
the moment, I am so happy that I am my side, my back to the
door, "Brandon!"  Kyle hisses at me.   I  decide  to  feign
sleep.  I would be to embarrassed to say  anything  to  him
right now, "Dammit, Brandon!  I know you're awake.   Answer
me you little shit!"  I roll my eyes, even though I know he
can't see the gesture, "What?!"  I hiss in annoyance.

"Oh, don't even get all 'better-than-thou'  right  now.   I
could fuckin' hear you!"  The accusation was easily  enough
to recognize.

Shit.  "What the fuck are you talkin' about?"   Stay  calm,
just play dumb and deny everything.  He has no proof...

"Don't act stupid, you know  damn  well  what  I'm  talkin'
about!  You we're getting off while  listening  to  me  and
Jenna fucking, don't fuckin'  try  to  deny  it.   I'm  not
deaf!"

I didn't even think to say anything back  to  that.   There
was nothing that I could do  that  would  save  me.   Well,
there probably would have been, but I just  wasn't  in  the
right state of mind to think of it.

"I knew it.  You liked the way  Jenna  sounds,  don't  you?
How she practically begs for my cock.  You know, her  pussy
is no where near as good as her mouth.  Her  pussy's  about
as wide as a hallway.  Can't even get me off.  But she  has
a mouth that works wonders.  She knows where to lick,  when
to suck harder, ya know?"  I colored at his  words,  and  I
felt myself harden again.  I could have cared less how good
Jenna could suck dick.  I was more interested at  listening
to my brother talk about sex in general.

"Then again, maybe you don't know.  Are the  rumors  around
school true, Brandon?  Are you still the lone virgin?

Waiting for that one special  girl  to  fuck?   Well,  news
flash, Brandon!  Every girl is  the  same.   If  she's  not
using you for money, she's using you to get higher  on  the
food-chain.  They're all sluts, ain't  none  of  'em  worth
waiting for," the last bit was kind of whispered,  like  he
had been waiting a long time to say it.

I pushed myself into a sitting position and locked my  eyes
onto his, "Then why do you fuck whatever comes along?   Why
do you give them exactly what they  want  if  they're  just
using  you?   Huh,  Kyle?   Why  are  you  such  a  fucking
man-whore?!"  I was breathing heavy by  time  I  was  done.
This is what I had been wanting to say to him.

I saw a smile grace his lips, "Why do you care who  I  fuck
and why I do it?"  I knew there was something more to  that
question, but I didn't catch on right away, "I don't  care!
I was just pointing out a fact, Kyle."

"Hmm," he replied with a slight raise of the eyebrows, "You
still didn't answer my question."

I sighed in annoyance again, "What question?"

"Why, exactly, were you jacking off while me and Jenna were
fucking?"  he said it slowly, like I wouldn't understand it
any other way.

"Well...  uh...  Jenna is...   "  I  stuttered,  trying  to
think of an adequete answer for him.  It wasn't working.

"Don't lie to me, Brandon.  This has  nothing  to  do  with
Jenna.  You want me, and I know you do," I  watched  as  he
left the doorway and came closer to me,  "You  want  me  to
fuck you so hard you won't be able to sit for a week.

You want me pounding into your virgin ass and to be  at  my
mercy.  You want it so bad, you can  hardly  think.   Am  I
right, Brandon?"  Kyle cocked his  head  to  the  side  and
looked  at  me.   "How...   how  did  you  know  that?"   I
stuttered as I swallowed the lump in my throat.   Kyle  was
probably going to kill me for this, but that thought didn't
even take away from my painful erection.  "Only girls  keep
diaries, Brandon.  And only people that want their thoughts
read, keep their diaries, or 'journals', " he cut in before
I could say anything, "under their mattresses.  You  wanted
me to see that just as bad as you want me to fuck you right
now," Kyle was kneeling beside me on the bed  now  and  all
thoughts left my mind.

"I...  I...  " I began before a finger was pressed  against
my lips.

"Shh..."  he leaned into me.   His  lips  just  centimeters
away from mine, "I want it to,"  it  was  the  smallest  of
whispers, but I heard, just before his lips crashed against
mine.

The  kiss  wasn't  loving  or  tender.    It   was   needy,
passionate,  rough,  demanding,  and  just   so...    Kyle.
Everything we  ever  wanted  was  poured  into  this  kiss.
Almost like it was going to be our first, last,  and  only.
God, how I hope it isn't our only.

His  calloused  hands  are  running  down  my  chest   now.
Scraping over my hard nipples and I moan  into  his  mouth.
The feeling is incredible and I don't think I can handle it
as he pinches the  sensitive  nub  between  his  thumb  and
forefinger.  I arch into the touch and cry out in pleasure.

"Mmm, relax..."  his hands travel farther  down  and  tease
the hollow of my hip.  Light strokes and not quite where  I
need it.

My cock is just so fucking hard right now.  I need  and  he
knows it.

"...Kyle...  please..."  I hear myself gasp.  I would  have
been   humiliated   had   this   been   under   any   other
circumstances, but I just didn't care right now.  I  needed
release.

"What, Brandon?  What do you want?"  his lips are  suddenly
against my ear, whispering and nibbling.  Damn my sensitive
ears...

"ANYTHING!  PLEASE!"  I scream in desperation.

"Heh..  you should learn to be more  specific.."   suddenly
he's off the bed.  I look up with confusion clearly  etched
in my eyes.

He throws the bottle of lotion from my nightstand at me and
walks out the door.

The next thing I hear is the shower running and I  collapse
against the pillows.  Next  time,  if  there  was  a  'Next
time', I would be more specific.

More Specific, the Sequel

Part 2

Yesterday already feels like an eternity ago.  I'd probably
give anything to go back  and  redo  what  happened.   This
sucks.  My brother is the biggest  asshole  in  the  world.
Who the fuck does that to someone?   Be  more  specific  my
ass!  He knew exactly what I wanted, and  he  walked  away.
If anything, I'd say he  whimped  out  of  what  he  really
wanted.  Jerk.

I mean, damn.  He had me at his mercy.  He could have  told
me to suck his toes, and God knows I would  have  done  it.
Maybe he just didn't want  to  cheat  on  Jenna.   I'm  not
counting on that, considering he changes  girlfriends  like
he changes his underwear.  But that could be it.

Nah.  I know for a fact he's already fucked around on  her.
It was with some chick from a neighboring  town.   Maybe  I
should tell dad that the walls  should  be  thicker...   At
least then I  wouldn't  have  to  hear  it  all  the  time.
There's only so much my sex drive could take, and listening
to that seemed to push the limit every now and then.

None of this  makes  sense.   All  my  questions  are  just
leading me to more questions.  Why would he just stop?  Did
he really want me to say it?  That  has  to  be  it.   Kyle
likes sex, any kind of sex, too much to just walk away from
someone young and willing.  Even if I am his brother.

"Dammit!"  I curse softly as the questions keep coming.   I
can't stand it anymore; I have to do  something  about  it.
Writing in my journal is completly out of the question.   I
could just figure it out on my own.  Okay,  new  game-plan:
Wait for Kyle to get home from whatever random  party  he's
at, then give him the third degree until I get answers.

In my head, it sounds like a good plan.  Now I just have to
hope Kyle will comply.  I take a quick glance at the clock.
The red numbers read 10:14.  He  won't  be  home  until  at
least midnight.  Damn it.  I wander out to the living  room
and settle in for the longest two hours of my life.

X--x--X

I jolt awake when I hear keys in  the  lock  at  the  front
door.  I must have dozed off, considering the  clock  above
the mantle now reads 1:22.  I watch in  amusement  as  Kyle
stumbles through the door and kicks off  his  shoes.   He's
obviously drunk.  Well,  this  could  certainly  complicate
things...

"'Ey, Brannen," I have to bite back my laugh  as  he  slurs
his words together and he stumbles  into  the  kitchen  and
grabs a left-over slice of pizza  from  the  fridge.   Kyle
really is a riot when he's plastered, "Wha'cha still  doin'
up?  Ain't ya sposta be sleepin'?"

"Kyle, it's Saturday night, which means no school tomorrow.
No, I'm, not supposed to be sleeping.  Aren't you  supposed
to be sober?"  I cock my head to the side as  I  watch  his
alcohol laden mind process this information.

Then suddenly, he's grinning like  the  chesire  cat,  "Too
true.  I should totally be sober!  But  I'm  not,  an'  its
okay, 'cause I'm drunk!"

I sigh and mentally store my questions away  for  tomorrow.
He's already acting like nothing  happened,  why  should  I
bring it up?  "Yes, yes you are  very  drunk.   You  should
probably get some sleep though.   Even  if  we  don't  have
school, mom and dad would kill us  if  we  skipped  out  on
church."

Kyle frowns at me and realizes the truth in  my  statement.
We both had to be up, showered, and dressed to go by  9:30,
"'Kay, I'm gunna go ta sleep now," he yawns  and  uses  the
wall for support as he heads down the hall and towards  his
room.  Then, in the blink of an eye, he's  on  the  ground.
The drunken idiot tripped over the step.

I move from my cozy place on the couch  and  help  him  up.
Kyle latches to me like he'll die  if  he  lets  go.   He'd
probably  fall  again,  but  I  don't   think   he'd   die,
"Brannen..."  he sighs my name and it goes straight  to  my
groin.  Shit.

"Yeah, yeah.  I got you," I help him to his room and gently
lay him on the bed.  He relaxes  against  the  pillows  and
drapes his arm over his eyes.

I get up to leave the room, but his hand on  my  arm  stops
me, "Stay..."

Damn it.  Why now?  "Now, Kyle.   You  need  sleep,  not  a
baby-sitter," I force out, even though everything inside of
me wants to stay.

I walk away and I'm almost  to  the  door  when  he  speaks
again, "Please?"  The word was  barely  an  exhale,  but  I
stop.

"Why?"  I don't know if he could hear  the  hopefull  tone,
but I was hoping he could.

"Because I want you  here,"  Kyle  says  with  a  bit  more
confidence .  I walk back to the bed, and stop at the edge,
"Kyle, why do..."  and  my  words  are  cut  short  because
suddenly  I'm  on  him.   Kyle  had  pulled  me   into   an
overpowering kiss.  It was brutal and hair shy of  painful.
I want more.

I kissed him back  with  as  much  ferocity  that  I  could
muster.

"Brandon...  yes..."  Kyle moans into my mouth and I answer
with a deep groan of my own.  I grind against him and  feel
an equal hardness covered by cloth.

The  friction  we  created  as  we  crushed  our  erections
together was incredible.  If it felt  this  good  with  our
clothes on, I could barely imagine how it feel if  we  were
nude, "Kyle...  clothes off...  NOW!"  I got out in-between
kisses.

I feel his hands go to my back at that moment and he  lifts
my shirt off of my prone body.  We break the  kiss  and  he
throws my shirt to some random corner, then  quickly  sheds
his own.  I straddle his  thighs  and  we  undo  eachothers
pants.  I pushed my body up and pulled my pants and  boxers
off.  Kyle raises his hips and I help him out of his jeans.
He isn't wearing any boxers and it  fuels  my  desire  even
more.

I crash our lips and bodies back together and were  rubbing
against eachother like there's no tomorrow,  "Brandon,  get
my lube.  Top drawer on  the  right,"  Kyle  groans  and  I
comply immediatly.  I reach for the side table and open the
drawer, my lips never leaving his, and quickly search for a
tube of something, anything, and I roughly  shove  it  into
Kyle's waiting hand.

He flips us, so I'm laying on my back and he's above me.  I
watch with wide eyes as he opens the  small  tube  and  our
eyes connect.  Kyle coats two of his fingers and I move  so
my feet are flat against the matress, knees bent, and  legs
spread, "Hurry..."

A slick finger circles my entrance and lightly presses  in.
It dosen't hurt, just feels kind of odd.  He  has  the  one
finger completly inside and is moving it in and  out,  then
adds a second.  He slides the two in and out  and  scissors
them as he goes.  And I'm seeing stars.  I  groan,  loudly,
and Kyle hits that spot again and again.

"What do you want Brandon?"  his mouth is  against  my  ear
and I have no idea when he got there, but I don't care.   I
answer his question with a pitiful groan, but that  dosen't
satisfy him.  He presses against that spot and asks  again,
"What do you want me to do?"

"FUCK ME!"  I scream and  I  can  feel  the  smirk  as  his
fingers leave my stretched hole.  I  feel  his  cock  press
against me.  Sliding in, slowly.  Again,  I  have  no  idea
when he lubed himself  up,  but  I  certaintly  don't  care
either.

I groan in frustration and Kyle seems to understand what  I
want.  He slams into me with one quick thrust.  I  feel  so
full, but not much pain.  The thought  of  what's  actually
going on seems to over-ride my brains  ability  to  process
any pain at this point.

Kyle waits for me to adjust,  and  I  press  down  on  him.
Silently letting him know I'm ready.  If  I  was  expecting
this to be slow and gentle, I was sadly mistaken.  Luckily,
I would never expect such a thing from Kyle.

"Brandon, you're so fucking tight.  Shit...  you're fuckin'
perfect," he punctuates each word with a  thrust  and  hits
the spot when he twists his hips at 'perfect'.  I'm  seeing
stars again as he hits that spot.  Repeatedly.  I know  I'm
being  loud,  moaning,  groaning.    Hell,   I'm   probably
screaming, but I don't care.  The only thing on my mind  is
coming.

Kyle seems to  understand  this  and  grabs  my  neglected,
leaking cock.  He strokes me in time with his  thrusts  and
I'm coming in no time, Kyle's names  on  my  lips.   A  few
thrusts later, I can feel Kyle reach his completion.

We're both panting and sweaty as he slips out of me with  a
soft 'pop'.  I'm starting to breathe normally when it  hits
me.  During all those kisses at  the  beginning,  he  never
even  smelled  like  alcohol.   Didn't  taste  like  it....
"Kyle...?"  I say softly.

"Yeah?"

"You weren't drunk, we're you?"  It was more of a statement
than a question.

"I never said I was," I could hear the cocky smirk  in  his
voice.  Damn him.

"You asshole!"

"Oh, shut up," and he's kissing me  again.   I  guess  that
being more specific with what you want, really does help...
