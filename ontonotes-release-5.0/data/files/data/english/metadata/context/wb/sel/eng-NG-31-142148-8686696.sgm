Switzerland is known as a haven of peace and neutrality. But today it is
home to a new extremism that has alarmed the United Nations. Proposals for
draconian new laws that target the country's immigrants have been condemned
as unjust and racist. A poster campaign, the work of its leading political
party, is decried as xenophobic. Has Switzerland become Europe's heart of
darkness? By Paul Vallely
Published: 07 September 2007
At first sight, the poster looks like an innocent children's cartoon. Three
white sheep stand beside a black sheep. The drawing makes it looks as though
the animals are smiling. But then you notice that the three white beasts are
standing on the Swiss flag. One of the white sheep is kicking the black one
off the flag, with a crafty flick of its back legs.

The poster is, according to the United Nations, the sinister symbol of the
rise of a new racism and xenophobia in the heart of one of the world's
oldest independent democracies.

A worrying new extremism is on the rise. For the poster - which bears the
slogan &quot;For More Security&quot; - is not the work of a fringe neo-Nazi group. It
has been conceived - and plastered on to billboards, into newspapers and
posted to every home in a direct mailshot - by the Swiss People's Party (the
Schweizerische Volkspartei or SVP) which has the largest number of seats in
the Swiss parliament and is a member of the country's coalition government.

With a general election due next month, it has launched a twofold campaign
which has caused the UN's special rapporteur on racism to ask for an
official explanation from the government. The party has launched a campaign
to raise the 100,000 signatures necessary to force a referendum to
reintroduce into the penal code a measure to allow judges to deport
foreigners who commit serious crimes once they have served their jail
sentence.

But far more dramatically, it has announced its intention to lay before
parliament a law allowing the entire family of a criminal under the age of
18 to be deported as soon as sentence is passed.

It will be the first such law in Europe since the Nazi practice of
Sippenhaft - kin liability - whereby relatives of criminals were held
responsible for their crimes and punished equally.

The proposal will be a test case not just for Switzerland but for the whole
of Europe, where a division between liberal multiculturalism and a
conservative isolationism is opening up in political discourse in many
countries, the UK included.

SWISS TRAINS being the acme of punctuality, the appointment was very
precise. I was to meet Dr Ulrich Schlüer - one of the men behind the
draconian proposal - in the restaurant at the main railway station in Zürich
at 7.10pm. As I made my way through the concourse, I wondered what Dr
Schlüer made of this station of hyper-efficiency and cleanliness that has a
smiling Somali girl selling pickled herring sandwiches, a north African man
sweeping the floor, and a black nanny speaking in broken English to her
young Swiss charge. The Swiss People's Party's attitude to foreigners is,
shall we say, ambivalent.

A quarter of Switzerland's workers - one in four, like the black sheep in
the poster - are now foreign immigrants to this peaceful, prosperous and
stable economy with low unemployment and a per capita GDP larger than that
of other Western economies. Zürich has, for the past two years, been named
as the city with the best quality of life in the world.

What did the nanny think of the sheep poster, I asked her. &quot;I'm a guest in
this country,&quot; she replied. &quot;It's best I don't say.&quot;

Dr Schlüer is a small affable man. But if he speaks softly he wields a big
stick. The statistics are clear, he said, foreigners are four times more
likely to commit crimes than Swiss nationals. &quot;In a suburb of Zürich, a
group of youths between 14 and 18 recently raped a 13-year-old girl,&quot; he
said. &quot;It turned out that all of them were already under investigation for
some previous offence. They were all foreigners from the Balkans or Turkey.
Their parents said these boys are out of control. We say: 'That's not
acceptable. It's your job to control them and if you can't do that you'll
have to leave'. It's a punishment everyone understands.&quot;

It is far from the party's only controversial idea. Dr Schlüer has launched
a campaign for a referendum to ban the building of Muslim minarets. In 2004,
the party successfully campaigned for tighter immigration laws using the
image of black hands reaching into a pot filled with Swiss passports. And
its leading figure, the Justice Minister, Christoph Blocher, has said he
wants to soften anti-racism laws because they prevent freedom of speech.

Political opponents say it is all posturing ahead of next month's general
election. Though deportation has been dropped from the penal code, it is
still in force in administrative law, says Daniel Jositsch, professor of
penal law at Zurich University. &quot;At the end of the day, nothing has changed,
the criminal is still at the airport and on the plane.&quot;

With astute tactics, the SVP referendum restricts itself to symbolic
restitution. Its plan to deport entire families has been put forward in
parliament where it has little chance of being passed. Still the publicity
dividend is the same. And it is all so worrying to human rights campaigners
that the UN special rapporteur on racism, Doudou Diène, warned earlier this
year that a &quot;racist and xenophobic dynamic&quot; which used to be the province of
the far right is now becoming a regular part of the democratic system in
Switzerland.

Dr Schlüer shrugged. &quot;He's from Senegal where they have a lot of problems of
their own which need to be solved. I don't know why he comes here instead of
getting on with that.&quot;

Such remarks only confirm the opinions of his opponents. Mario Fehr is a
Social Democrat MP for the Zürich area. He says: &quot;Deporting people who have
committed no crime is not just unjust and inhumane, it's stupid. Three
quarters of the Swiss people think that foreigners who work here are helping
the economy. We have a lot of qualified workers - IT specialists, doctors,
dentists.&quot; To get rid of foreigners, which opponents suspect is the SVP's
real agenda, &quot;would be an economic disaster&quot;.

Dr Schlüer insists the SVP is not against all foreigners. &quot;Until war broke
out in the Balkans, we had some good workers who came from Yugoslavia. But
after the fighting there was huge influx of people we had a lot of problems
with. The abuse of social security is a key problem. It's estimated to cost
£750m a year. More than 50 per cent of it is by foreigners.&quot;

There is no disguising his suspicion of Islam. He has alarmed many of
Switzerland's Muslims (some 4.3 per cent of the 7.5 million population) with
his campaign to ban the minaret. &quot;We're not against mosques but the minaret
is not mentioned in the Koran or other important Islamic texts. It just
symbolises a place where Islamic law is established.&quot; And Islamic law, he
says, is incompatible with Switzerland's legal system.

To date there are only two mosques in the country with minarets but planners
are turning down applications for more, after opinion polls showed almost
half the population favours a ban. What is at stake here in Switzerland is
not merely a dislike of foreigners or a distrust of Islam but something far
more fundamental. It is a clash that goes to the heart of an identity crisis
which is there throughout Europe and the US. It is about how we live in a
world that has changed radically since the end of the Cold War with the
growth of a globalised economy, increased immigration flows, the rise of
Islam as an international force and the terrorism of 9/11. Switzerland only
illustrates it more graphically than elsewhere.

Switzerland is so stark an example because of the complex web of influences
that find their expression in Ulrich Schlüer and his party colleagues.

He is fiercely proud of his nation's independence, which can be traced back
to a defensive alliance of cantons in 1291. He is a staunch defender of its
policy of armed neutrality, under which Switzerland has no standing army but
all young men are trained and on standby; they call it the porcupine
approach - with millions of individuals ready to stiffen like spines if the
nation is threatened.

Linked to that is its system of direct democracy where many key decisions on
tax, education, health and other key areas are taken at local level.

&quot;How direct democracy functions is a very sensitive issue in Switzerland,&quot;
he says, explaining why he has long opposed joining the EU. &quot;To the average
German, the transfer of power from Berlin to Brussels didn't really affect
their daily lives. The transfer of power from the commune to Brussels would
seriously change things for the ordinary Swiss citizen.&quot;

Switzerland has the toughest naturalisation rules in Europe. To apply, you
must live in the country legally for at least 12 years, pay taxes, and have
no criminal record. The application can still be turned down by your local
commune which meets to ask &quot;Can you speak German? Do you work? Are you
integrated with Swiss people?&quot;

It can also ask, as one commune did of 23-year-old Fatma Karademir - who was
born in Switzerland but who under Swiss law is Turkish like her parents - if
she knew the words of the Swiss national anthem, if she could imagine
marrying a Swiss boy and who she would support if the Swiss football team
played Turkey. &quot;Those kinds of questions are outside the law,&quot; says Mario
Fehr. &quot;But in some more remote villages you have a problem if you're from
ex-Yugoslavia.&quot;

The federal government in Berne wants to take the decision out of the hands
of local communities, one of which only gave the vote to women as recently
as 1990. But the government's proposals have twice been defeated in
referendums.

The big unspoken fact here is how a citizen is to be

51 Percent of Americans Believe Bush-Cheney Orchestrated 9/11, New Poll
Finds

September 11 Attacks: Suspected Self-aggression

Washington, Sep 9 (Prensa Latina) The US government is somehow involved in
the attacks on the September 11, 2001, El Diario-La Prensa daily reads in an
editorial, based on suspicions by thousands of US nationals.

According to Zogby polling firm, 51 percent of US nationals believe Bush and
his Vice President Richard Cheney orchestrated a self-aggression to justify
militarism in the last years.

Journalist Luis Barrios says in his weekly column that Osama bin Laden may
possibly work for intelligence services subordinated to the White House,
which he benefits with each appearance.

Barrios added that every statement by Osama favours the US president, either
to join forces over his alleged anti-terror fight, or defend the extension
of troops in Iraq.

Yesterday, Bush made good use of Osama's latest recoding to stress it is
necessary to maintain the Pentagon troops in the Arab nation and Afghanistan
as guarantors of the US safety.
