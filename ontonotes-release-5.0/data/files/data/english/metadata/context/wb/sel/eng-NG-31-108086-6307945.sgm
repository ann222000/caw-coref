I figure you guys know all about gluing things so I'm looking for a glue
which will work on Plexiglass - the stuff they sell in hardware stores
to repair storm door windows.
I've tried white glue, crazy glue, Rhino glue
Ideas will be greatly appreciated. Perhaps Epoxy?

I forgot to say that I'm trying to glue a piece of metal to Plexiglass.
TIA

You can glue plexiglas to plexiglas with a solvent based glue
(avaialble from GE Plastics, but company since sold and has new name).
The glue will be strong enough to make an aquarium.  You CANNOT glue
plexiglas to metal.  To bind plexiglas to metal a rubber channel is
used, as seen in plexiglas bus shelters and store display cabinets.

Have a look at this one:

http://www.gesilicones.com/gesilicones/am1/en/grade/mastergrade_serie...

AFIK it will do the job.
When it comes to pricing and availability, I have no clue.

That's not right, you CAN glue plexiglass to metal. How well
it stays is another story. Best bet would be silicone sealer or that
all around glue called Goop. Under most conditions, CA or epoxy will
hold, but the surfaces must be roughed up a bit. Gorilla glue might
work. Again, what conditions the Plexiglass/metal combo is used
depends on how well it holds. To glue Plexiglass to itself, best thing
is glue made for it.

According to Wikipedia, Pexiglas (aka Perspex, Lucite, acrylic glass, or
just "acrylic") can be joined using CA glue or liquid di- or tri-
chloromethane.

&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylic_glass &gt;

I did a quick test, CA *does* work for gluing metal to Pexiglas, but you
need a CA accelerator to make it set.  Whether it's strong enough will
depend on the intended use.

Di- and tri-chloromethane are solvents, so they'll only work for gluing
Pexiglas to itself.  Check the yellow pages under "plastics", you might be
able to find a local business that sells it.

For acrylic to metal I'd go epoxy.  Even if CA holds well enough, CA
often fogs transparencies.  For acrylic to styrene, sometimes
Microglaze or some other white-glue-based stuff will work, but I doubt
it would handle metal.

I would try GE's Lexan 100% Silicone Sealant. Comes in a 2.8 oz tube
sold in HD where the plexiglass sheets are. I used it to make a 2' x 6"
x 6" plexiglass display case.  What it says on the tube:
translucent
outstanding adhesion
quick setting
permanently flexible
UV resistant

I use Weld-On #3 to build display cases and the odd fish tank from
acylic sheet aka plexiglass. It is the primary reason for its purpose.
Forms a strong tight bond that is nearly invisible.

A FWIW--before you start applying adhesives, make sure you really know what
material you're working with; is it truly "Plexiglas", or is it Lexan?  To
the layman the word Plexiglas has come to mean virtually any clear plastic
sheet, like any facial tissue is a kleenex.  Plexiglas is an acrylic, Lexan
is a polycarbonate.  The ONLY similarity is that they're both plastic-like
material, and generally used in a transparent form (both are sold in
hardware stores for use as windows).  One can be thermal-formed, the other
cannot.  One will actually absorb the energy from a .50cal round, the other
will break apart.  Plexiglas doesn’t machine well, it’s too soft (it also
scratches relatively easily).  Lexan machines quite well because it’s
incredibly hard, but that also translates into brittle.  If it truly is
Plexiglas, epoxies won’t even work well, you need to mechanically attach
the metal to it via bolts, screws, rivets, etc., and you need special
drill bits for it.  If you were joining Plexiglas to Plexiglas, it’s not
“glued”, but a chemically welded joint like PVC pipe. Confused yet?

Plexiglass or perspex machines ok if you know how to make the tool to do
it and the speeds to machine it at .
I have  machined 100mm(4") diameter acrylic on a lathe to manufacture
laboratory containers for use in a spectrometer in a radiation laboratory.
They had to be crystal clear when finished , just a matter of the
correct tool ,feed and speed and a light polish afterwards.
