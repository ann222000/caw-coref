Machiavelli Hangman Is A Masterpiece
Copyright © 2005 Joachim Jurgenson
Machiavelli Hangman

The theme of Machiavelli Hangman is “Carpe Diem.” And it does not
just jump at you spelling out all the ways you can live life to
the fullest and live all your dreams today instead of leaving
them for tomorrow. It slowly crawls out of the story, so subtly
that you don’t realize it is staring at you until it hits you
right between the eyes. The actors in the film are so impeccable
in their parts that you would think that the script was written
with precisely them in mind. The story flows as if it was in one
continuous time-frame even though Machiavelli Hangman is told
through a non-continuous structure.

The film reminds of other originals like Pulp Fiction and Memento
but it doesn’t have the dramatic undertones as the previous. This
one is a comedy in the spirit of a great Billy Wilder classic. If
only Jack Lemon was alive, and in his 20’s, he would have been a
perfect fit for the role of George. You will see what I’m talking
about when you see the film. This film is a modern version of
Double-Indemnity with the comedic rhythms of Some Like It Hot
with Marilyn Monroe.

If you’re not sure what I am talking about, please rent those
Billy Wilder films and watch them before watching Machiavelli
Hangman. You will almost think that
&lt;A HREF=&quot;&quot;&gt;Shervin Youssefian&lt;/A&gt;
is the reincarnation of Wilder in the way he writes the material.
Like Wilder, he is of foreign descent and stands only 5’6 tall.

It’s definitely been a while since a good comedy has turned up
without any of the easy jokes or cheap shots taken at geeks and
every other minority group. Napoleon Dynamite, although
successful, refrained often to that type of humor and the
audience laughed but often quite uncomfortably. Machiavelli
Hangman does not take itself so seriously either, but it respects
each of its characters as if they were real human beings. The
relationships vibrate and radiate beyond the screen and you feel
part of that classic gangster underworld.

It truly comes as no big surprise that
&lt;A HREF=&quot;&quot;&gt;Machiavelli Hangman&lt;/A&gt; is
gaining momentum and is predicted to become the film to beat in
2006. It is truly a cinematic gem that interweaves so many genres
without coming out like a calculated collage clichés. Like in
life, we live horror and comedies and drama and just as we do
everyday, the characters in the film live it in two hours.

This film was made with a budget of only a hundred fifty thousand
dollars but it nevertheless going up in my top 10 all time
classics list. It sizzles, dazzles, crackles at times and it
leaves you wanting more. I’m going back for seconds and waiting
impatiently for the sequel.
