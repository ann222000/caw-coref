WARSAW They spent their childhoods in the rich, layered Jewish life of
prewar Poland, then survived Hitler's mission to wipe out European
Jewry in the ghettos and gas chambers of occupied Europe.
Now, men such as Tad Taube, Sigmund Rolat and Severyn Ashkenazy, after
making fortunes in the United States, have returned to Poland as
philanthropists to nurture a grass-roots revival of Jewish life in
their homeland.
Some Jews outside Poland cannot comprehend why the philanthropists
would return to a land where their ancestors suffered such pain and
loss. But members of Poland's Jewish community praise the help as
crucial to the small renaissance now underway.
&quot;What the philanthropists have done along with the importance of the
material donation is also empowered us, encouraged us, let us know
we're not alone,&quot; said Poland's Chief Rabbi Michael Schudrich, an
Orthodox leader from New York. &quot;And that cannot be underestimated.&quot;
Following Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939, about 3
million Polish Jews were murdered in Nazi-run death camps in occupied
Poland. Of those who survived, many later fled in reaction to
anti-Semitic violence or repression under communism, which eventually
fell in 1989.
Of those who remained, many suppressed their identities and
intermarried with the Roman Catholic majority, making it difficult to
say how many Jews live in this country of 38 million today. Some
estimate between 10,000 and 30,000 Polish citizens have some Jewish
ancestry.
&quot;The population doesn't have a reasonable chance if there aren't
institutions in place to support them,&quot; says Taube, who now lives in
San Francisco. He left Poland weeks before Hitler's tanks rolled across
the border in their Blitzkrieg attack that started World War II.
And so foreign donors have stepped in to fill the void, funding
everything from Hebrew classes and rabbis to big ticket items like the
annual Jewish Culture Festival in Krakow and Warsaw's landmark Museum
of the History of Polish Jews, due to open in 2009.
Ronald S. Lauder, the U.S. cosmetics heir, was among the first foreign
philanthropists to take an interest in rebuilding Jewish life in Poland
and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s. More recently, as the indigenous
Jewish community has grown in this young democracy, more
philanthropists have begun to help.
Since launching operations in Poland more than three years ago, Taube's
foundation has donated about $2 million annually and encouraged other
donors to contribute another $8 million to help fund rabbis,
educational programs, summer camps and day schools, as well as the
Krakow festival and the Warsaw museum.
&quot;The preoccupation of Jews in most of the diaspora is of Poland as a
cemetery for Jews,&quot; he said during a recent visit to Warsaw. But his
philanthropy efforts are &quot;about Jewish life in Poland, not Jewish
death.&quot;
Rolat, from New York, closely cooperates with Taube and is involved in
a host of similar projects, has worked extensively in his hometown of
Czestochowa to put its tiny surviving Jewish community back on its feet.
And there are signs of renewed vigor and complexity in Jewish life
across Poland.
Severyn Ashkenazy, who lives in Los Angeles, survived the war in an
underground bunker in the Polish city of Tarnopol, in what is now
Ukraine. After the war he moved to France before settling in the United
States where he, like Taube, made his fortune in real estate.
Ashkenazy got involved in Poland in 1999, when he helped launch Beit
Warszawa, Poland's first Progressive, or Reform, community since World
War II.
Beit Warszawa, which started as a handful of foreigners meeting in
their homes, now has some 200 active members, and its own center for
Sabbath services, meals, bar mitzvahs and other events.
Rabbi Burt Schuman from New York arrived last year, becoming the
country's first full-time Progressive rabbi since the Holocaust, and a
second rabbi started this year, Tanya Segal, a Russian-born Israeli who
is the country's first permanent woman rabbi.
&quot;Someone needed to do it, and the perennial question is if not me, who,
and if not now, when,&quot; Ashkenazy says. &quot;It needed to be done. It still
needs to be done. It's in its infancy, progressing, taking roots. We
need support, we need help.&quot;
Rolat, who worked as a slave laborer in camps near his hometown of
Czestochowa during the war, left Europe for the U.S. in 1948 as the
sole survivor of his family. He grew wealthy running international
finance companies.
He has helped fund Warsaw rabbis, book publishing and educational
programs to promote Jewish culture in Polish schools, but has also
spent great effort to revive the Jewish community in his native
Czestochowa. He is also involved in efforts to promote Polish-Jewish
relations.
All three men speak openly of their love for Poland, and stress that
the country was a true home for Jews for a millennium, where their
people achieved great things in the arts, sciences and politics.
&quot;Poland really was more than just a country where Jews took refuge,&quot;
Rolat said in Warsaw. &quot;Poland was really our home.&quot;
