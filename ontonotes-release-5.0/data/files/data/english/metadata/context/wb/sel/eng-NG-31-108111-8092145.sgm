I have set up a photobucket account and uploaded some pictures I had on my
laptop.  I'll have to get other pictures from other sources some other
time.  At least you can all see what a Gumper looks like.

My username is mmmtoblerone.  I think this is the URL to get there:

Maui is jealous of Sammie's mohawk.

Those are good pictures but where's Scooter?

Your pictures are wonderful!  I sat here laughing my head off when I wasn't
oohing and aahing over your lovely daughters.

Never a dull moment at your house!

Thanks,

All the pictures we have of Scooter are in my daughter's camera, which
she has with her at her dad's house.  I'll have to add them later.  Anna
took all the other pictures on there, too, but those were already in the
computer.

Great pix! So nice to finally see your dogs! They all look so happy and
agreeable. I love Faith in the tiara! And Sammie does *not* look like
himself in a poodle cut, but he does look excellent with a mohawk.
Gunther and Molly look very sweet. Gunther seems to like head/neck gear
-- perhaps you want to keep updating his haberdashery?

Oh, and your kids are very beautiful!

He officially belongs to Mimi.  She hates the poodle cut.  That was when
he was a brand new baby and came with a poodle cut.  Ever since then, he
gets a bichon puppy cut.  Short on the body so he can run with the big
dogs and get into lots of trouble and still be easy for Mimi to bathe and
brush and a little longer on the head so they can give him mohawks and
such.  He just isn't a froofy dog, so the total poodle thing doesn't work
for any of us.  When his hair gets so long that I can't see his eyes, he
has to go back to the groomer even if it means that they can't do as much
with his hair until it grows out a bit more.  I have my limits.

I CAN'T AFFORD IT!!!  If you saw the wardrobe Faith has because Anna
loves to dress the dogs up (she's also responsible for the hat and
princess pictures) and loves Faith most of all, you would know we can't
encourage another dog to expand his wardrobe.

Faith loves to be dressed up.  Sammie doesn't like it except for shirts.
I'll have to see if the girls can find his Harley Davidson shirt and take
a picture.  Oh, he also LOVED the bows they put on his ears when he got
groomed shortly before Christmas.  I think it was because everyone who
saw him gushed over him like nobody's business.  If it gets him attention
and snuggling, he loves it no matter what it is.

Gunther likes everything that has been put on him, but all they've put on
his is head gear and the neckerchiefs he gets after grooming.  Molly
hates to have anything put on her.  She put up with the princess crown
with ribbons, but only because ordered to.  She got it off her as soon as
she was released.  She also tries to get her groomer neckerchiefs off.

Thank you!  I think so, but I don't even pretend to have an unbiased
opinion on my kids.

Yay!  Now I've seen more than &quot;just&quot; Faith, which I realize should be
enough for anyone (but only if she asks).

Your girls are beautiful--it's not just your bias, it's true--and the dogs
are fantabulous, too!

I don't think you're supposed to! It's really best for all concerned if
moms think their kids are beautiful.

My mom has always told me that I was quite possibly the ugliest baby she has
ever seen, and she doesn't quite know how I made it past my first year.

Of course, I made up for all that by being an angel the rest of the way.

Anna doesn't think she is beautiful.  She says the boys in her class call
her ugly.  I don't get that.

When she had her annual dance recital, she performed her competition
dances as well as the dances her classes put on.  The woman in front of
me saw her in the jazz number that there is a picture of on that site and
asked the person with her, &quot;Is that the hip hop girl?&quot;  (Anna's was the
only hip hop solo.)  They had an argument about it and finally looked up
the names in the program and marveled that the girl in the sparkly girly
outfit dancing to the fun, sweet jazz number was the same girl hitting
her hip hop dance so hard.  When I told her that story after recital, she
laughed.  She likes having multiple dance personalities and looks.

I don't get it either. I think sensitive kids get picked on more, though.
That's how I explain my own childhood...
