Does it hurt worse then an ear piercing and does your nose swell up?
Just for a emerald stud not for a hoop to be dragged by.

No Aine, I was actually waiting for a good friend to have it done...to
make sure her nose did not swell up or fall off. She chickened out,
so, I have nothing to compare the pain to.

I think you should have it done though. It would be really cute, just
watch the boogers on the posts. I will do it if you will~

Yes and Yes. Ever rip out a nose hair with tweezers? Imagine that pain
constantly for weeks. Like a belly button piercing, (or anything lower)
it seems like it takes forever before its not tender anymore. I'm told
each person is different, though so your mileage may very.

It swells a little. Enough so you notice it, but others will probably
only notice the redness. (that is if you get a GOOD piercer. I had a
friend who got one and he looked like he broke his nose!)

And for goodness sake take it OUT if you have a cold. Yuck.

Ah the insanities of youth. I took mine out and let it grow back years
ago and never regretted it.

I answered myself. You should hear me in real life. I am talking
myself into it. Others create sock puppets to make posts. Not me, I
don't care who knows I am strange.

I have a very high pain tolerance as long as I have a grip on the
length of time I will have to deal with it. Natural childbirth lasts
only so many hours. The actual pierce I coud get through.

Constant irritation or pain starts getting to me. Thats a fair amount
of ouch time to deal with something for an accessorie.

Thats what I heard. Unless the post is really short. Not sure how much
time I want to invest in booger checks. So much more to do in life.

The pierce itself is more of an ouch! jump! than painful. The reaction
afterwards seems to vary *very* widely with different people. My first one
was like a permanent toothache, and it swelled horribly. I was daft enough
to think it had settled, and put a butterfly-back on it, as it was a
short-post stud and I didn't want it to fall out. It promptly swelled more,
and you do *not* want to know about the fun I had removing it:( Shall we
say, if it wasn't for longnose jewellers' pliers and a non-squeamish friend,
I would have ended up in the ER.

The second attempt, the channel didn't &quot;scar over&quot; and so when the stud fell
out, as they do, I found myself redesigning my nose from the inside, rather
than just putting the stud back. That was painless, but rather disturbing to
watch in the mirror. A bit like those body-builders who make the muscles
&quot;dance&quot;, but in miniature? Very weird, especially as I then had to massage
the lumps out in order to restore some sort of symmetry. Anyway, after that,
I decided nose-piercings were not for me, and gave up.

OTOH, I know many, many people who have not had any problems; I suppose the
answer is to try it, but not persevere if it really doesn't work for you.
Personally, I think nose-studs look *very* pretty, but you can get the same
effect with stick-on jewels; depends if you want &quot;a piercing&quot; or just a
facial decoration, I suppose.

Very Ouch, Baby. Hmm..I considered these types of things since I had
to give up a couple of my ear pierces that gave me problems. The lobe
ones are fine but higher up kept infecting.

My kids had the eyebrows, lip, tongue and belly pierce and never had
problems. Except my son broke 2 teeth on the tongue pierce. I think he
was sky diving at the time and did not take it out.

No matter how pretty the look if you are fighting it half the time it
is not worth it, especially dead center nose. Thanks, I had some great
visuals going on you there. I was rather entertained but I am sure it
was not fun for you at the time. Needle nose pliers are great for so
many things. ;)
