I highly recommend reading the interview below, which appeared in the
Logos Journal (I'm not
sure when).
Racheli.

Raul Hilberg - background (from Wikipedia).

Born in Vienna, Hilberg left Austria with his family in 1939. After a
brief stay in Cuba, the family moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he
attended Abraham Lincoln High School and Brooklyn College. He entered
the graduate Public Law and Government program at Columbia University
after completing military service in World War II, writing his Ph.D.
under the supervision of Franz Neumann. Much of his teaching career has
been spent at the University of Vermont, where he was a member of the
Department of Political Science and later a member of the &quot;President's
Holocaust Commission&quot;.
The first edition of The Destruction of the European Jews went to press
in 1961. The German edition was made possible in 1982 by Ulf Wolter,
Olle &amp; Wolter, Berlin, where Gerhard Schröder, later chancellor, was an
author.

Is There a New Anti-Semitism?
A Conversation with Raul Hilberg

Q: You have famously argued that there were three solutions to the
Jewish problem; conversion, expulsion, and finally extermination. Could
you explain what you mean by that?

Raul Hilberg: This is an underlying pattern to which I came to early on
in my research. Looking through the sweep of history it is clear that
conversion was an object of the Christian world. The expulsions began
in the late Middle Ages when it would appear that the Jews were not
willing to become Christians. That pattern existed for several hundred
years in Europe. You could take it back to Oxford and then go to Spain
in 1492 and Portugal a few years later. So we are really talking about
the later Middle Ages and the beginning of modern times for the
expulsions.

Now, the business of a final solution, that permanent solution, is a
Nazi idea. You go back even to the beginnings of the Nazi party and
find that they are still thinking in terms of the emigration of the
Jews \—there was a plan called the Madagascar plan, which was actually
a thought in Poland and even in France (Madagascar was a French
possession), maybe all of the Jews could be shipped there. So this idea
was still floating in the German foreign office and all the way up to
Hitler as late as 1940, especially 1940 when France surrendered.
However, when the War did not end as the Germans had hoped it would
with the West (they were already making preparations to attack the
Soviet Union), the serious thought of annihilating the Jews emerged.
The earliest indication of this is a meeting Hitler had with a bunch of
party members early in February of 1941. He had by then not quite
formed the decision, but it was on the way.

Q: There was the revisionist conference in Iran several months ago. How
worried should scholars and the general public be about the capacity of
this kind of revisionism to engender anti-Semitism?

Hilberg: This revisionism began in the 1960s. It is not new. I
boycotted Germany for quite a while, but when I passed through a while
back Munich I went to a kiosk and bought a local right wing paper, a
German paper, I found to my great astonishment that I was mentioned on
the title page as a Zionist leader. Now, that was a big surprise to me,
but the headline was: “The Lie of the Holocaust”. So, Germany in the
sixties had adherence to this belief, even though there they should
have known better than anywhere else. There was a Frenchman who was
already in print in the 1960s. Half of his book was devoted to me. It
was a neo-Nazi publication. As soon as my book, The Destruction of the
European Jews, was out in 1961, I became a target of these groups.

To me, the later developments in Holocaust denial were just a very slow
spread, not even a growth, but a spread from France/Germany to the
United States to Canada and ultimately picked up by the Arab world. The
Arab world is very disoriented when it comes to Europe anyway. They are
as confused about the West as we are about them. Even so, the
conference in Iran did not even succeed in Iran - it was needless
difficulty and trouble. There were Iranians who publicly denounced this
conference. So, I am not terribly worried about it even though at the
time that that conference took place last December I was asked by the
German government to take part in a counter-conference as the keynote
speaker that was held the same day in Berlin. I ordinarily do not
engage in debates with Holocaust revisionists. I did not do so at the
Berlin conference either, but the essence of my talk was that, yes,
there was a Holocaust, which is, by the way, more easily said than
demonstrated. I demonstrated this and people did come to it.
Nevertheless, the German papers did not publicize the
counter-conference in Berlin because they could not resist publishing
the faces of the Rabbis who had gone to Iran.

I have come to the conclusion, not once but several times, that, as far
as I am concerned, I do not agree with legislation that makes it
illegal to utter pronouncements claiming that there was no Holocaust. I
do not want to muzzle any of this because it is a sign of weakness not
of strength when you try to shut somebody up. Yes, there is always a
risk. Nothing in life is without risk, but you have to make rational
decisions about everything.

Q: Many of the recent anti-Semitic incidents in Europe have led people
to talk of a new anti-Semitism. Is this really something we should take
seriously or is this simply a continuance of the older anti-Semitism?

Hilberg: It is not even that. It is picking up a few pebbles from the
past and throwing them at windows. I am old enough to remember what the
effects of an anti-Jewish attitude are. Here, at the University of
Vermont it was unthinkable, even in this liberal state, to have a Jew
as a dean as late as the seventies, let alone president. In other
words, there was still a lot of segregation in the United States. If
you go back and you pick up any New York Times in the thirties or even
the forties you will see ads for apartments in New York City and the
word “restricted”. This is a Jewish owned newspaper and they printed
ads barring Jews. And this was an embedded anti-Jewish regime, which
the society itself supported and it’s gone. It’s simply gone.

We cannot even talk about restrictions on Jews in the Islamic world
because the Jews have left the Islamic world. They are not there
anymore except in Morocco and maybe some tens of thousands still here
and there, but that is a remnant of the two hundred thousand that were
still there when the state of Israel was created. So the anti-Semitism
of the past belongs to the past, and particularly the word
“anti-Semitism.” There was an anti-Semitic party in Germany and there
was an anti-Semitic party in Austria. The leader of the Hungarian
regime, Admiral Horthy, who, when some extreme right wing guys were
trying to take over Jewish businesses shouted them down. He said, and I
am paraphrasing, “you are not going to take over these businesses
because the Jews at least know how to run them and who are you? And
don’t you talk to me because I was an anti-Semite before you were
born.” Adolf Hitler himself, and nobody reads Mein Kampf, makes a
statement that his father would not be an anti-Semite because it would
degrade him socially. Nietzsche’s sister married an anti-Semitic leader
and he referred in letters to his sister in the whole correspondence
“to your anti-Semitic husband.” Now, you can see that anti-Semitism was
somewhat correlated with some backward glance. It belongs to the
nineteenth century with its other “-isms,” with imperialism, with
colonialism, with racism. It sounds bizarre if I tell you that the
Nazis did not call themselves anti-Semites. You do not even find the
word.

Q: Really?

Hilberg: Yes, there was a sense that Nazism was something new. The
anti-Semite had stopped at a certain point; the anti-Semite could talk
about eliminating Jews, but did not know how to do it. The anti-Semite
did not have the power, the anti-Semite was a propagandist. The Nazis
were serious and this was a far different proposition. When you see the
actual legislation in Germany, Austria, and elsewhere that states that
it is criminal to deny that there was a Holocaust, it is because these
governments have to distance themselves from Nazism. Nowadays of course
Nazism and anti-Semitism are conflated into one kind of ideology, but
it is a different phenomenon. There was an extreme anti-Semitic
newspaper in Germany, Der Stürmer, which was published by Julius
Streicher. I do not remember now whether it was Höss, the Auschwitz
commander, or somebody else who was asked, “Did you read Der Stürmer?”
He said, basically, “Look, I’m a lieutenant colonel of the SS, I
wouldn’t be caught dead reading Der Stürmer.” It was like reading the
lowest of the low gossip rags in the United States. There was an issue
of social standing.

Q: What are your thoughts on the rhetorical and symbolic usage of the
word “Holocaust”?

Hilberg: I resisted the use of the word “Holocaust” to begin with
because of its religious underpinnings. In the end, it is like anything
that becomes usage; you do not escape from it. But, “Holocaust” becomes
problematic in a number of ways, and the one which is least discussed,
because it’s politically incorrect to do so, is that everything is
becoming a Holocaust. I will give you one example: I was walking in
Berlin one day and I see a sign “Holocaust” and saw some street
demonstrators with signs reading “Holocaust, Holocaust, Holocaust.” I
could not figure out what they were demonstrating about until I saw a
cage and realized they were talking about cruelty to animals. The word
“genocide” is also being bandied about, and of course the Genocide
Convention has a definition which goes beyond what they call a
“Holocaust.” So if you kidnap children in order to make them do
something that’s genocide, if you use opium that’s genocide, etc.
Because it’s an international convention, the Greeks put something in
there, the Chinese put something in there and so on and so forth.

“Holocaust” is a misused word again and again because it means,
especially when it is capitalized, the Jewish catastrophe and once you
pin it on all sorts of things it loses its effectiveness. There are now
books being written that state the Armenians were not really subjected
to genocide or the Gypsies were not really subjected to genocide - even
though in my opinion both were - but it results in these arguments and
it’s an unavoidable situation. As soon as the President’s Commission on
the Holocaust was set-up—that’s the same President Carter who is now
being called an anti-Semite who created the Commission—everybody showed
up: the Armenians, of course, showed up, the Poles showed up, the
Ukrainians showed up, the Czechs showed up. There are all of these
definitional problems and arguments that emerge when using words like
“Holocaust” or “genocide.”

Q: Moving beyond the way these words are symbolically and rhetorically
employed, what do you see as the kind of relation of the Holocaust to
other historical and current genocides? How can we use the lessons of
it to confront the kind of violence and persecution of groups which are
occurring today, whether or not sociologically we consider them
genocides?

Hilberg: I did not know what to do with Cambodia or other events like
that, but Rwanda convinced me. That is why in the third edition of my
book I got Rwanda in there. Why I put it there is the answer to your
question. In Buchenwald and possibly some other camps as the war ended,
the inmates put up big signs that said “never again.” I think it was
really the Communists who were behind that, but I am not sure. The
signs said “never again” in various languages because there was a Babel
of languages in these camps. Millions of people, men, women and
children killed only because they were classified as Jews. Now, that
should not happen again and that is the responsibility of the world.
The result was, in fact, the Genocide Convention. The word genocide was
a made up word by Raphael Lemkin, a Jewish lawyer from Poland whose
previous speciality was terrorism. When the Holocaust happened he
published a book in 1944, Axis Rule in Occupied Europe. In that book he
invented the word genocide because he argued that the law has to have
that concept as a crime. Of course the United States did not want to
sign the Genocide Convention because the State Department and other
representatives had their doubts. One major doubt was that if we had a
Genocide Convention, then the blacks in this country would challenge
all the segregation laws. The Genocide Convention is a treaty, and if
it’s a treaty under Article six of the Constitution we cannot sign this
convention because it would override our sacred state laws which
discriminated against blacks. That was their argument. Eventually that
argument collapsed.

What remains today, however, is that the “never again” is implicit.
Yet, come Rwanda and President Clinton refused to call it genocide when
it really was! We said that we will never tolerate this sort of thing
again, but allow half a million people plus to be killed in three or
four months in Rwanda. After ten Belgians were killed withdrawals began
of the international peacekeeping force. It was the same thing as in
Germany, the Hutu decided now we are going to solve the Tutsi problem
like the Germans did with the Jews. It is even clear that they decided
it months before they started killing because they imported machetes
and made preparations like the Germans. So here we were, the whole
world, there’s no World War II going on, there is no excuse that we
need all the aircraft we have, so we cannot bomb Auschwitz because we
need them on the Western Front, and nothing is done. It’s peace, it’s
the nineties, and nothing is done. So much for “never again.” So the
problem has obviously not disappeared.

You have to make decisions. When you are sitting in the Defense
Department or the State Department in the White House you never can
predict exactly what configurations some happening will show you. You
have to think it through and these people haven’t got any time to
think. They have to do all their thinking before they took office. This
is a major problem. Nevertheless, this is the first time in history
that we take a sort of global responsibility. I am not saying we are
alone, we have our partners doing this and the notion of a gloabl
responsibility is really brand new, it is post-World War II.

Q: What are your thoughts on the current debates over how to interpret
the Holocaust and its legacy in the work of people like Norman
Finkelstein or Daniel Goldhagen?

Hilberg: Well Finkelstein is now maligned all over the place. There
were obviously lobbies who tried to dislodge him from his position.
Finkelstein is a political scientist. I believe he has a PhD degree
from Princeton and, whatever you may think of Princeton, this is a
pretty strong preparation to be a professional political scientist. He
wrote to me a couple of times. He was the first one to take Goldhagen
seriously. He attacked Goldhagen in a very long essay which I could
never have written because I would have never had the patience.
Goldhagen is part of an academic group that in my kind of research is a
disaster...

Q: Why is that?

Hilberg: Because [Goldhagen] was totally wrong about everything.
Totally wrong. Exceptionally wrong. In other words, this whole fury of
his anti-Semitism was, at the root, that it was especially
eliminationist anti-Semitism, was totally absurd. He talks about
anti-Semitism among Germans, Estonians, Ukrainians, Latvians, and
Lithuanians, but where did this unique eliminationist anti-Semitism
come from? It is just totally absurd. I mean, totally off the wall, you
know, and factually without any basis. Finkelstein took this seriously.
I took it less seriously, but I was a latecomer in attacking this
Goldhagen fellow.

Now Finkelstein had a second point, which, in my opinion, was one
hundred percent correct and that is that the response to the issue of
the Swiss banks and German industry, which had coincided during the
War, was not only coercive on the part of the Jews who mobilized, but
also on the part of all the insurance commissioners, the Senate, the
House, and the critical committees. The only thing they could not break
through was to the courts, which still have independence. So they lost
at court, but they threatened people like Alan Hevesi in New York. They
could make threats because Swiss banks wanted to expand here. For
Finkelstein, this was naked extortion and I’m not sure who agreed with
him except for me and I said so openly. In fact, I said so to the press
in maybe seven countries.

The press did not expect my answer. The World Jewish Congress was led
by a man who was appeared to be from his own autobiographical
statements to be totally, not even average, but like a child almost.
What this tycoon, who took over the World Jewish Congress, was saying
was totally preposterous. The claims lawyers, joined by the World
Jewish Congress, made an incredible display of totally inappropriate
behavior.

Now when he talks about the Arabs, some Jews feel that he is also
anti-Zionist, that he is anti-Israel; that he seems to always emphasize
the suffering of the Arabs. I do not join him in this particular
venture because I have my own view, but you cannot say he is altogether
wrong either. Would you like to be an Arab citizen in Israel? Think of
the doors that are closed. You may eat better and have a better income
than if you lived in a slum in Cairo. The great irony is that the
economic condition of Israeli Arabs is considerably better than the
proletariat in some other Arab countries, but a person needs something
more. A person needs a feeling of dignity. Think of the security check
points. It is a life that certainly something ought to be done about it
in one way or another. This particular battle cannot be fought forever.
It cannot be. The Israelis will tire of it. The Israelis will simply
tire of mistrusting people. It is not possible to go on this way
forever. Finkelstein has the corner on the germ of correct vision in
these matters because he is pretty sharp. More often than not,
especially with regard to these other matters like Goldhagen and the
Swiss banks he has been right.

Q: One last question, as time goes on in the twenty-first century what
direction should research on the Holocaust take now?

Hilberg: Well, if you had asked that question first, it would have
needed a half hour. Rightfully so, the research today is oriented
towards finding out details and especially what happened at the local
level. This research has already started. It is not very well developed
in this country, but it is very much in progress in Europe. The
principle researchers of the Holocaust today are Germans and Austrians.
There are also some French and Italians. There are not many Holocaust
researchers worth mentioning in this country.

The second thing that we should and must do is look at those aspects of
what happened which are still taboo. What is taboo is the life of a
terminal Jewish community in some ghetto and the notion that some
people died first, then other people died next, still other people died
last, and then, better yet, some of them survived. What accounts for
these very discernible developments? Example: the first to die were the
poorest of the poor. We have got to face this issue. We have got to
realize that it will not do in the academic world to call all of the
Jewish dead – as I have heard one Rabbi call them, Kedoshim, which
means holy people. This is not my language. We cannot do that. We have
to see them as they were and we have not done this. We have had the
lectures. This is one aspect in which I do not agree with Elie Wiesel
although I have known him for a long time. He says “listen to the
survivors and listen even to their children.” I say, yes, we will
listen to the survivors. We have listened for quite a long time, but it
is not enough. It will not tell us what happened to the people that did
not survive. You are not a random sample. This requires a lot of
assiduous research through a lot records that have been buried and have
not been examined.

The third thing that needs to be done is: you have to identify more
clearly who the neighbors of the Jews were. How they were impacted if
at all? How their reactions were motivated, be it to join the
perpetrator or help the victim or, in most cases, remain neutral.
Neutrality does not mean ignoring something. It means a decision not to
do anything. We have to examine that as well. So we have to examine the
Holocaust in all ways and it boils down to doing a lot of local
research because at the local level are the records that tell us
something. For example, if I read in local records that the
Byelorussians are not delivering enough grain to the Germans because
they secretly steal it to make vodka and in such huge quantities under
the German occupation, you would have to begin to ask the question what
percentage of that population was perpetually drunk? Now these are
very, very important questions and that is the direction the research
needs to go in. It is not for amateurs, it is not for untrained people,
it is not for philosophers, it is for people who know languages, who
know history, who know political science, who know economics, etc. At
the root they must be well trained. The Holocaust is not today, as it
might have been in the beginning, a subject for the laymen.
