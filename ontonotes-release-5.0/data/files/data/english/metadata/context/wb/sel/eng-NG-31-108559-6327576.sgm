VSWR doesn't matter?

We are all told that VSWR doesn't matter when using low loss
transmission lines, since the RF energy will travel from the
transmitter up to the mismatched antenna, where a certain amount of
this RF energy will reflect back towards the transmitter; after which
the RF will then reflect back up to the antenna -- where the energy is
eventually radiated after bouncing back and forth between the
transmitter and antenna.  I understand the concept, but what I don't
quite understand is why the reflected RF energy isn't simply absorbed
by the 50 ohm output of the transmitter after the first reflection?
For the RF to bounce back and forth, wouldn't the transmitter's
impedance have to be very, very high (or low) when the reflected RF
energy hit its output stages?  I know I'm missing something vital
here...

Thanks!

That's assuming you use an antenna tuner.  The tuner will transform the
transmitter's output impedance* just as it transforms the line.  Were
the transmitter output impedance actually at 50 ohms, on the other side
of the tuner it would have the same VSWR as the line when everything was
tuned up.

Having said that, the VSWR _does_ matter somewhat when using low loss
lines, both because the line loss is low but not zero, and the tuner
loss will tend to go up as you correct for higher and higher VSWR.

* I am _not_ going to start the Big Transmitter Output Impedance Debate.
sed denizens -- just don't comment on what a transmitter's "actual"
output impedance may be, lest you start a flame war.

Yep, you are missing the "total destructive interference"
happening toward the source caused by a Z0-match. Here's
an article that might help:

A Z0-match eliminates reflected energy from reaching
the source.

Well, I was never taught that -- which is a good thing because it is
not true.

The most intuitive way to prove this (antenna tuner or not), is to
simply supply more and more power to the load.  You will eventually
burn it up.

Now, had the VSWR been better (ie. a better network Return Loss), it
would have taken even more power to achieve the same "charcoal"
results.  So VSWR matters.

The active part of the transmitter output isn't 50 ohm.
That would cause half the power to be lost as heat in
the output stage. It's only 50ohm once it becomes a moving
wave in the transmission line.

Hi Bob,

Well, aside from the initial misunderstanding of how power gets to the
load (much less back, and then to the load again);  I will put to you
a question that has NEVER been answered by those who know what the
transmitter output Z ISN'T:
"What Z is it?"

Two problems:

1)  The transmitter may well have output impedance matching the
characteristic impedance of the transmission line.  RF power reflected
back in this case gets converted to heat in the output stage of the
transmitter, in addition to whatever heat the output stage already has to
dissipate.

1a)  The reflection may increase requirement of the output
tubes/transistors to both drop voltage and dissipate power.  This can be a
problem for many transistors, especially a lot of bipolar ones.  It is not
necessarily sufficient to stay within power, current, voltage and thermal
ratings.  Many bipolar transistors have reduced capability to safely
dissipate power at voltages that are higher but within their ratings -
sometimes even at voltages as low as 35-50 volts.  This problem tends to
be worse with bipolar transistors that are faster and/or better for use
with higher frequencies.  The keyphrase here is "forward bias second
breakdown", a problem of uneven current distribution within the die at
higher voltage drop.

2)  It appears to me that transmitters can have output stage output
impedance differing from the intended load impedance.
An analog is common practice with audio amplifiers - output impedance is
often ideally as close to zero as possible, as opposed to matching the
load impedance.

If zero output impedance is achieved in an RF output stage, I see a
possible benefit - reflections do not increase output stage heating but
get reflected back towards the antenna.  Then again, the impedance of the
input end of the transmission line could be low or significantly reactive
depending on how the load is mismatched and how many wavelengths long the
transmission line is, and that can increase heating of the output stage.
In a few cases transmitted power can also increase.

Not only is increased output stage heating possible and maybe fairly
likely, high VSWR also causes a high chance of the output stage seeing a
partially reactive load.  RF bipolar transistors often do not like those
due to increased need to dissipate power with higher voltage drop.  As I
said above, RF bipolar transistors are likely to really dislike
simultaneous higher voltage drop and higher power dissipation.

*Sigh*

The same misconceptions keep coming up, as they have countless times on
this newsgroup and I'm sure they will for decades or perhaps centuries
to come. After one of the many previous discussions, I wrote a little
tutorial on the topic. Originally in the form of plain text files, I've
combined it into a pdf file for easier viewing. You can find it at
http://eznec.com/misc/Food_for_thought.pdf .

On page 8 you'll find the statement "THE REVERSE POWER IS NOT DISSIPATED
IN OR ABSORBED BY THE SOURCE RESISTANCE". Above it is a chart of several
examples which clearly show that there's no relationship between the
"reverse power" and the source dissipation. The remainder of the
tutorial explains why.

Any theory about "forward" and "reverse" power, what they do, and their
interaction with the source, will have to explain the values in the
example chart on page 8. Does yours?

All true.
Also normally, there is a pi type filter (to prevent harmonics), between
amplifier and antenna.
This filter _WILL_ match the antenna to the output impedance of the
transmitter, so _even_ if the transmitter output impedance is very
very low (low voltage high current output stage for example), the reflected
power will be nicely converted to match the transmitter, and heat up the
output amp, with its possible destruction as result.

It really doesn't matter except for overall

into a local load of R +/- jX sources the same

Mine does. All of your values can be understood by looking
at the destructive and constructive interference and applying
the irradiance (power density) equations from the field of
optics. You see, optical engineers and physicists don't have
the luxury of measuring voltage and current in their EM waves.
All they can measure is power density and interference and
thus their entire body of knowledge of EM waves rests upon
measurements of those quantities. Those power density and
interference theories and equations are directly applicable
and 100% compatible with RF theories and equations. Any
analysis based on power density and interference will yield
identical results to the ones you reported in your "food for
thought" article which includes the following false statement:

"While the nature of the voltage and current waves when
encountering an impedance discontinuity is well understood,
we're lacking a model of what happens to this "reverse power"
we've calculated."

We are not lacking a model of what happens to this
"reverse power" we've calculated. The model is explained
fully in "Optics", by Hecht. When one has standing waves of
light in free space, it is hard to hide the details under
the transmission line rug.

In general, it is just as easy, and sometimes easier, to deal
with the energy values and then calculate voltage and current
as it is to start with voltage and current and then calculate
the power.

All this is explained in my WorldRadio article at:

http://www.w5dxp.com/energy.htm

The great majority of amateur antenna systems are Z0-matched.
For such systems, an energy analysis is definitely easier to
perform than a voltage analysis. Here's an example:

100W------50 ohm---+---Z0&gt;50 ohms-----load
Pfor1=100W--&gt;       Pfor2--&gt;
&lt;--Pref1=0W         &lt;--Pref2

The power reflection coefficient is 0.5 at point '+'.
The power reflection coefficient is 0.5 at the load.

What are the values of Pfor2 and Pref2? What is the physics
equation governing what happens to Pref2 at point '+'?

Some gurus will say that it's the voltage and/or current
that is destroying the final, not the reflected energy.
They have yet to explain how those dangerous voltages
and/or currents can exist without assistance from the
ExH joules/second in the reflected energy wave. Depending
upon phase, the E in the ExH reflected wave is what causes
the overvoltage due to SWR. The H in the ExH reflected
wave is what causes the overcurrent due to SWR.

The impedance seen by the source is

Z = (Vfor+Vref)/(Ifor+Iref)

Where '+' indicates phasor (vector) addition.

The above equation also gives the impedance anywhere
along the transmission line and anywhere along a
standing-wave antenna.

Unfortunately, that article doesn't explain where the
power does go. A much better treatment of the subject
is in "Optics", by Hecht. To understand where the
power does go, one must understand destructive and
constructive interference. Please see my transmission
line example in another posting.

The energy content of a transmission line during
steady-state is always exactly enough to support
the forward traveling wave and the reverse traveling
wave without which there would be no standing wave.

Of course, that was a tongue-in-cheek posting.

&gt;This filter _WILL_ match the antenna to the output impedance of the

&gt;very low (low voltage high current output stage for example), the reflected

Hi Jan,

Actually, there is a transformer there in the typical Ham transmitter
(and probably in every general purpose power source) that typically
transforms the native Z to the output Z.  This is a step up for solid
state, and step down for tubes.  In the solid state rigs, it is a
literal transformer feeding the 1-2 Ohms through a 5:1 winding ratio
to a switched bank of low pass filters.  This stuff is mud ordinary.

As for the reflected energy, depending upon the phase it will either
combine destructively (heat) or constructively (cool) in the extremes.
There are, of course, 179 degrees of variation between these extremes
before they repeat themselves again.  Cooling, of course, is something
of a misnomer as nothing useful is happening (poor power transfer) so
perhaps the terms should be destructive through uselessly benign.

In my opinion the simplest way to answer your question is that you are assuming
that the transmitter is equivalent to a 50 ohm load, which is not true because
the transmitter is instead equivalent to the series of a 50 ohm load and a
voltage generator.

A simple DC example grossly clarifies thre issue: connect a 12V battery to the
series of a 50-ohm load and another 12V battery. How much current flows through
the load? Naught (assuming the correct polarity). So no power is dissipated in
it.

As pointed out, VSWR does matter. A lot of bouncing means you heat the
transmission line with the power instead of radiating the power.

Here is what you are missing. In the case of the output, (real/resistive
component of the transmitter), seeing the reflected wave, it is _not_
reflecting that power back up the transmission line as you think it is.
It would go back to that real impedance and heat the transmitter. Here
is what is done with a miss match in the real world.

trans-output -&gt; match -&gt; line -&gt; antenna

The 'match' is where the magic happens. All the energy coming down the
line that got reflected from the antenna 'sees' the 'trans-output -&gt;
match' as a perfect reflector and gets bounced back[*]. On the other
side of the match is the trans-&gt;output. There the trans-&gt;output sees a
perfect impedance, (technically, the conjugate of the trans-&gt;output), so
that all the power travels through the match toward the antenna.

The magic is that when the match is tuned, both of the above conditions
are satisfied.

*The reflected wave sees a purely reactive reflector not just because of
the network but also because of the output power of the transmitter.
Without transmitter power the impedance as seen from the load will
dramatically change.

Best, Dan.

Correct but I just want to remember that the purpose of the tuner is to
match the impedance of the transmitter to the impedance of the antenna/
transmission line.The standing waves can be viewed as a reflect voltage, a
reflect current or as a reflected impedance. Besides I thought there had
been enough quanitative analysis of the question and was hoping a simple
answer may be enough to turn on the light bulb for the OP. If he still

Of course. Mine was just a DC example to illustrate things in a simple manner.

When the transmitter is properly tuned, the phase relationship is such that the
reflected wave does not get dissipated at all into the 50 ohm output of the
transmitter, and is then reflected back to the antenna

Saying that SWR doesnt matter is a rather broad statement(like saying never
or always) but I have know of antenna systems having an SWR of 30:1 and his
was normal. The feedline was balanced line made of 1 inch copper. Of course
an SWR lie this on coax could be fatal to coax and equipment. A more common
example of this is the 1/4 wl matching section on a J-pole antenna. It
matches 50 ohms to a few Kohms so an SWR of 60: 1 or so would not be unusal
here.S oas long as the feedline can handle the current and voltage peaks
without much los it doesnt matter much as long as the source impedance is
matched to the impedance at the input to the transmission line.Im sure there
is a practical limit though.

Hi david

Wouldnt it be OK to have a high VSWR along the transmission line if the
"tank ckt" can be adjusted to match the load to the transmitter output
impedance?   That is, the VSWR along the transmission could concievely be
high, yet, with proper "tank ckt" adjustment that impedance seen by the
output circuit (plate) wouldnt result in a "cherry red plate".
What I am asking is ? is the transmission line VSWR directly related to
"plate reddening"?
I'm more asking than *telling*.

Unfortunately, you'd be learning the wrong lesson.

The cherry color is due to the transmitter being loaded with an
impedance it's not designed for, causing the final to run at low
efficiency. You can disconnect the antenna and replace it with a lumped
RC or RL impedance of the same value and get exactly the same result.
Alternatively, you can attach any combination of load and transmission
line which give the same impedance, resulting in a wide variation of
"reflected energy", and get exactly the same result. All that counts is
the impedance seen by the transmitter, not the VSWR on the line or the
"reflected power".

The problem is that the idea of "reflected energy" turning the plates
hot is so easy to understand, that people aren't willing to abandon it
simply because it isn't true.

Yes! All that matters to the transmitter is the impedance it sees. It
doesn't know or care that you've mathematically separated the delivered
power into "forward" and "reverse" components. It doesn't know or care
what the SWR is on the transmission line connected to it, or even if a

It appears that you agree with that part of my post but you are

an invalid conculsion from it. I never suggested that the passive

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's assuming you use an antenna tuner.  The tuner will transform the
&gt;&gt;&gt; transmitter's output impedance* just as it transforms the line.  Were the
&gt;&gt;&gt; transmitter output impedance actually at 50 ohms, on the other side of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the tuner it would have the same VSWR as the line when everything was
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuned up.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Having said that, the VSWR _does_ matter somewhat when using low loss
&gt;&gt;&gt; lines, both because the line loss is low but not zero, and the tuner loss
&gt;&gt;&gt; will tend to go up as you correct for higher and higher VSWR.

&gt;&gt;&gt; * I am _not_ going to start the Big Transmitter Output Impedance Debate.
&gt;&gt;&gt; sed denizens -- just don't comment on what a transmitter's &quot;actual&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; output impedance may be, lest you start a flame war.

&gt;&gt; If you want a quick lesson in high vswr find a ham with an old tube
&gt;&gt; transmitter and see if he will hook it up to a mismatched load. The cherry

&gt;   Hi david

&gt;   Wouldnt it be OK to have a high VSWR along the transmission line if the
&gt; &quot;tank ckt&quot; can be adjusted to match the load to the transmitter output
&gt; impedance?   That is, the VSWR along the transmission could concievely be
&gt; high, yet, with proper &quot;tank ckt&quot; adjustment that impedance seen by the
&gt; output circuit (plate) wouldnt result in a &quot;cherry red plate&quot;.
&gt;   What I am asking is ? is the transmission line VSWR directly related to
&gt; &quot;plate reddening&quot;?
&gt;   I'm more asking than *telling*.

&gt;                    Jerry

Jerry;

The point I  was trying to make is that the reflected current is
disapated as heat in the finals if the transmitter isn't matched to the
load.
In a tube radio the tank circuit is the equivilent of an antenna
match/tuner and converts the 2000 or so ohms at the plate to the 50 ohms
of the transmission line and the unknown ohms of the mis matched antenna.

&gt; Hi Bob,

&gt; Well, aside from the initial misunderstanding of how power gets to the

&gt; a question that has NEVER been answered by those who know what the

&gt;         &quot;What Z is it?&quot;

&gt; 73's
&gt; Richard Clark, KB7QHC

As Tim Williams alludes, it depends on the transmitter design.
It will often be complex rarther than resistive. Since the active
device changes impedance during a single cycle of the RF
signal it may not even be adequately described by a single
value in ohms for a paticular frequency if you wish to
analyse the case of forward and reflected power.

Consider a class C or class E output stage with an
output transistor that is low impedance during
most of the positive half of a cycle of signal and mostly
somewhere near open circuit for the negative half
of the cycle. It seems to me that the effect of reflected
power is going to be different depending its phase
relative to the forward power.
I think this also applys to a lesser extent to a class
A PA with a nice hi-Q tank circuit.

As usually whan this topic comes up, It don't feel
like we have arrived at a usefull and convincing model
of what happens, possibly because simple
descriptions don't cover everything.

Hi Bob,

No quantifiable answer I see.  It's not unexpected, everyone who knows
what it isn't has never been able to say what it is.  It seems like
the stock answer you give the cop who asks if you know the speed
limit.
"No.  But I wasn't speeding!"

The dependency here started with a conventional Ham transmitter, one
so ordinary as to be a commodity.  The design is not so exotic as to
elude a very simple value - except for those who know it isn't 50
Ohms.

_____________

But reflected energy/power does exist.

For an easy example, such reflections are evident in the picture seen on an
analog TV receiver when the match between the transmit antenna and the
transmission connected to it is bad enough.

In analog TV transmit systems with a typical 500+ foot length transmission
line from the tx to the antenna, a 5% reflection from a far-end mismatch can
be quite visible, showing as a "ghost" image that is offset from the main
image as related to the round-trip propagation time of the transmission
line.

&gt;&gt;Here is what you are missing. In the case of the output, (real/resistive
&gt;&gt;component of the transmitter), seeing the reflected wave, it is _not_
&gt;&gt;reflecting that power back up the transmission line as you think it is. It
&gt;&gt;would go back to that real impedance and heat the transmitter. Here is
&gt;&gt;what is done with a miss match in the real world.

&gt;&gt;trans-output -&gt; match -&gt; line -&gt; antenna

&gt;&gt;The 'match' is where the magic happens. All the energy coming down the
&gt;&gt;line that got reflected from the antenna 'sees' the 'trans-output -&gt;
&gt;&gt;match' as a perfect reflector and gets bounced back[*]. On the other side
&gt;&gt;of the match is the trans-&gt;output. There the trans-&gt;output sees a perfect
&gt;&gt;impedance, (technically, the conjugate of the trans-&gt;output), so that all
&gt;&gt;the power travels through the match toward the antenna.

&gt;&gt;The magic is that when the match is tuned, both of the above conditions
&gt;&gt;are satisfied.

&gt;&gt;*The reflected wave sees a purely reactive reflector not just because of
&gt;&gt;the network but also because of the output power of the transmitter.
&gt;&gt;Without transmitter power the impedance as seen from the load will
&gt;&gt;dramatically change.

&gt;&gt;Best, Dan.

&gt; Saying that SWR doesnt matter is a rather broad statement(like saying never
&gt; or always) but I have know of antenna systems having an SWR of 30:1 and his
&gt; was normal. The feedline was balanced line made of 1 inch copper. Of course
&gt; an SWR lie this on coax could be fatal to coax and equipment. A more common
&gt; example of this is the 1/4 wl matching section on a J-pole antenna. It
&gt; matches 50 ohms to a few Kohms so an SWR of 60: 1 or so would not be unusal
&gt; here.S oas long as the feedline can handle the current and voltage peaks
&gt; without much los it doesnt matter much as long as the source impedance is
&gt; matched to the impedance at the input to the transmission line.Im sure there
&gt; is a practical limit though.
">

Hi Jimmie,
Keep in mind I'm answering in the context of the op's post. And the
theoretical SWR on a stub is infinite. The point of the stub at the
antenna is to keep the SWR on the transmission line in a reasonable
range, to make a match if you will. To put high SWR on the feedline
instead of matching at the antenna isn't a great idea in my book.

OTOH.
I finally did some sidebanding a couple of months ago. (First time on
HF.) I got my hands on an old swan 500c. After changing the 6je6's and
supply caps, I had to find out what it was like to get on the air. I ran
outside and hung a wire between the lab and the shop. 40-50 feet. Put a
couple of alligator clips on the end of a chunk of rg-58 and into the
window. I started looking for the antenna through the trans-match with
an antenna bridge. The tuning was very sharp, lots of Q. I don't know if
I could have found it without the bridge :) I was willing to tolerate
the miss match to get on the air.

Well, it worked out. I made some great QSLs across the mid west and into
northern CA. I live in Vernon AZ. I'm pleased this turned out to be as
great a radio location as I thought. It shouldn't be long before I get a
beam on a tower. By then I'll look to match at the antenna and keep the
SWR off the feed line as much as possible.

Best, Dan.

Well, without a line, you don't have a real component to tune into.
Drawing arcs on a smith chart from an open line with capacitors and

The fact that any transmission line and antenna combination can be

What I've never understood is why so many hams have a problem with
the concept of equivalent circuits only when antennas and transmission
lines are involved.

Sure yoiu can, that stub is a transmission line. It would matter if it s a
1/4 wl long or 21 1/4 wl long. If it is designed to handle the current and
voltage peaks it can transmit power with low loss when a high VSWR is
present. Its just that most people dont make there feedlines out of inch
copper tubing. Even with 450 ohm ladder line 10:1 VSWR is very acceptable.

Would it be fair to say there are a number of Hams (no need to go into
