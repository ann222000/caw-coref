I think a lot of people will agree that people in Europe are far more
demanding about cars than the USA.
We have more corners and high speed limits and the European market tends to
be a higher benchmark to meet.

It's is widely excepted over here that the ford focus is the best hatch back
you can buy in it class by a long way.
No other car (in it's class) handles as well.

I own both, and both vehicles have manual transmissions.

The all wheel drive on the Suburu is the big reason we purchased it,
but in driving it for years and comparing it to my 2002 Ford Focus SE,
I would take the Subaru anyday over my Focus.  From a quality
perspective, I am concerned about how many miles I will get out of my
Focus before the maintenance costs start to grow.  The original factory
brakes wore out fast, though the quality replacement brake pads I
installed at 40,000 miles are holding up very well.  I'm a bit
concerned about how many other items on my vehicle that Ford went with
the cheapest and most minimal supplier.  However, I have 82,000 miles
on it, and the only thing that has failed so far is the vehicle speed
sensor.

I got a fantastic deal on my Subaru by using

we purchased it from Maita Subaru in Sacramento California -- they gave
us a great deal and they didn't play any games with us - they rock!!!

To be honest I am not sure if the European Ford focus is the same as the
American one.

The do say over here that people are shocked to see how cheap American cars
are to buy.
It's not untill they start falling apart that they understand why they are
so cheap.

About the same as Subaru. In fact, judging by recent model statistics, seems
like Subaru really cheaped out on wheel bearings. Ford did much better.
Current Focii rate right up there with Toyota, Honda and, yes, Subaru.

However, I have 82,000 miles

Surely seems reliable to me. Don't forget to mention that the Focus get
*much* better MPG. Handles better and it's quicker too.

I have owned Fords, Toyotas, Mazdas, and a Saab. Some held up better than
others. the Corrolla was the worst, the Mazda 626 perhaps the best. My
current car is a Sable with the 24V 6-v (1996) and its no rocket but it
still has good power compared with whats out there. My F-150 (300 CI 6
cylinder) Has run great and been used like a truck, I move metal lathes,
Mills and what ever weekly, the 150 still looks good and still runs great
gas milage is a joke. My wifes Contour with 166,000 miles on it runs fine in
fact its still a fun car to drive and handles great, so to say Ford or
American cars don't hold up thats crap. We looked at some used A4 s and if
they had many miles on them had a list of expensive repairs done, brakes
$1000, new suspension $1500, timing belt $1300.
As to the Subaru I had one YEARS ago that was good but it was a whole
different car. A good friend of mine sold his outback wagon because all the
problems however it had the 4 valve per cylinder engine they used for just a
few years that had problems all over the board. he had a burnt valve at
70,000 miles.

love my 2004 Focus with the 2.3L motor, lots of zip. But the ford dealers
around here (NYC) are all idiots and rip off artists in the service dept.
And when I called Ford Corporate to complain they said we stand behind our
dealers.

Especially when customers are pelting rocks.  ;)

What you said about NYC dealers, doesn't seem limited to only ford.
Since it appears that customers are willing to settle for a level of
customer service, that's what is being provided there.  Now I'm
speaking more from Brooklyn stories, but I'm guessing it's almost
universal the behavior in all of NYC.

later,
