~~ On This Monday The 22 Day of January 2007 ~~

Festival of the Muses. Each year on this date, the invisible spirits
that inspire and watch over all poets, musicians, and artists are
honored and invoked with Goddess-inspired poetry, Pagan folk songs,
music and dancing A powerful square between buoyant Jupiter and
unpredictable Uranus -- a pattern that lasts through October --
provokes extreme action and offers great rewards for bold behavior. But
we are subdued by an isolating opposition from warm Venus to cold
Saturn that challenges our self-esteem and makes us wonder if we are
truly loved. A supportive sextile from communicator Mercury gives us
hope, while the Moon in Pisces stirs our imagination.

Dipped from the Milky Way,
Neither man nor woman,
Looking ahead in time,
Whose gift is Newness,
Bless us with the ability
To be ready for the future

And welcome rather than fear changes.

You challenge us
To be open to new things,
And never to give in to stagnation.
May we all go forth in wonder.

in sweet and savory dishes in a variety of cuisines. Nutmeg increases
the intoxicating and soporific effect of alcoholic drinks and is
claimed to be an aphrodisiac. It is prescribed for flatulence and
nausea. The essential oil is added to perfumes, soaps, hair oils,
tobacco, and fumigants. The nuts yield an oil, nutmeg butter, used in
skin creams. Large doses of nutmeg are toxic, because of the presence
of the hallucinogen myristicin.

IMBOLC (February 2)

(Candlemas, Brigid's Day) Not common to all Pagans, this is very
popular with Wiccans and various Celtic sects. Brigid is the Celtic
goddess of fire and inspiration (Poetry, smithcraft and healing) as
well as yet another representation of the Fertility of Femininity and
Love. Brigid had such a strong following among the Celtics that the
Christian church decided it was easier to assimilate her into their own
system, and so there came about the making of Saint Brigit and all the
stories they created about her so that her followers would leave their
old beliefs enough so they would not side with the Druids, who were
known at that time as 'the snakes' because of their tendency to have
tamed snakes that were used to help produce various healing mixtures
via their venom, and who were violently opposing the Catholic church.
In History, of course, the druids lost against the overwhelming odds
presented by the church, led by a man who would then be himself sainted
by the church, their Saint Patrick (who was no clergyman but a
warrior). Thus Christian rule of various sorts came into Ireland.
Handcrafts are often sacrificed to Brigid or dedicated to her as they
are started on this day. Its celebration is done with many candles and
as usual much feasting. The Christians also took, moved slightly and
used this date by creating St. Valentine and using the day for one of
chaste love reflections. Imbolc marks the recovery of the Goddess after
birth of the God. The warmth of the power of the God fertilizes the
Earth and so the earliest beginnings of spring occur. This is a sabbat
of purification

Luis (Rowan) January 21 to February 17

ROWAN
Also known as Mountain Ash, Witchwood and Sorb Apple has long known as
an aid and protection against enchantment. Sticks of the Rowan were
used to carve Runes on. Rowan spays and crosses were placed over cattle
in pens and over homes for protection. Its lovely red berries feed the
birds in winter. The berries have a tiny pentagram on them and are
especially poisonous. The pentagram is the ancient symbol of
protection. The Rowan tree indicates protection and control of the
senses from enchantment and beguiling. The Rowan was sacred to the
Druids and the Goddess Brigit. It is a very magical tree used for
wands, rods, amulets and spells. A forked Rowan branch can help find
water. Wands are for knowledge, locating metal and general divination.

The serious Capricorn Moon reminds us that we gain strength as we
overcome the obstacles in our lives. Capricorn's key planet, Saturn,
is opposed today by Mercury the Messenger. A tense atmosphere arises
when our thoughts and ideas are stymied. This can be a discouraging
day as authority wields its power. The key is to use the resistance we
encounter to tighten our thinking and to make our plans for the future
more solid. In the Shetland Islands, a centuries-old fire festival
known as Up-Helly-Aa is held each year on the last Tuesday of January
(which normally falls around this date). The festival, which marks the
end of the traditional Yuletide and pays tribute to the old gods and
goddesses of the ancient Viking religion, climaxes with the torching
of a replica of a Viking ship. The day ends with a traditional prayer
to drive away evil entities from village homes.

In the Solar Year
Sun at 8 Aquarius Day 38 of Yule Period
Wolfmonath 28
Ritual: Day of Rules: Eunomia's Day

Color: Black
Element: Air
Altar: Upon a black cloth light a single white candle, and lay upon it
a copy of the Principles, a book of the House rules, and various
implements of measuring.
Offering: Discuss the Rules.
Daily Meal: Any food that is wholly correct.

Invocation to Eunomia

Hail, Eunomia, Keeper of Rules,
Hora of the Upraised Hand!
We gather here to praise you,
Even though you seem most stern and forbidding,
For without Rules there are no boundaries,
No accountability, no way to stop the ravages
Of another's passions. Though we value those passions,
We must also value their limits,
For all things must be kept in balance.
These Rules are not merely the chains that bind us,
They are the ropes that hold us up,
Keeping us from falling into confusion.
We honor your gifts, Lady of Rules,
You who are not afraid to stop
What is not honorable behavior,
You who will not stand by
In the face of deeds of shame.

Call: Hail Eunomia, Keeper of Rules!
Response: Hail Eunomia, Keeper of Rules!

Call: Speak the Rule of Iduna, Lady of the Nectar of Immortality!
Response: I will maintain purity of body.
Call: For the body is the sacred temple given to us that we may
experience life,
And to harm it is to disrespect the Will
Of those who bestowed it upon you.

Call: Speak the Rule of Hestia, Keeper of the Hearth!
Response: I will maintain simplicity in my possessions.
Call: For waste leaves empty mouths and empty hands,
And greed has a cold heart and no soul.

Call: Speak the Rule of Agni, Fire and Truth!
Response: I will strive for clarity of words.
Call: For words are weapons of great power,
And should not be used in ways that deliberately confuse,
Or add to the blindness in the world;
Rather they should open eyes and minds.

Call: Speak the Rule of Gaea, the Earth beneath our feet!
Response: I will strive to live sustainably on the Earth.
Call: For She is our Mother, and She gives us all that we need,
And to harm her is to destroy our own future.

Call: Speak the Rule of Artemis, Virgin Huntress implacable, of the
purest intent!
Response: I will place no commitment of the heart above my commitment
to my path.
Call: For we are placed here in this world to learn and to do what we
must,
And a promise once made must be kept.

Call: Speak the Rule of Ogoun, hunter and smith, leopard-god without
mercy!
Response: I will commit only to honorable work.
Call: For work that aids what is wrong
Is tainted with wrongness in itself,
And we will not be part of that wrongness.

Call: Speak the Rule of Athena, clear-eyed virgin warrior, Lady of
Strategy!
Response: I will maintain clarity in all relationships.
Call: For Love too must have its rules, and honesty,
And there must be distance between each,
That the Spirit may lay between us and join us.

Call: Speak now the Rule of Parvati, Dancer and Mother, Sacred Whore!
Response: I will strive for purity in my sexuality.
Call: For the power of the Root Chakra is not to be defiled
By the soul's shame and the heart's despair;
The tides of the body are sacred, and are the libation of that
Temple.

Call: Speak now the Rule of Odhinn, All-Father and Magician, who
speaks to his own!
Response: I will sustain clarity of faith.
Call: For faith is what bears us up when all else falls,
And before the altars of the Gods we are all mortal.

Call: Speak now the rule of Prometheus, Titan who defies the King's
corruption!
Response: I will submit humbly to honorable authority.
Call: For although there must be leaders, lest we lose our way,
Leadership is not given, but is earned by right behavior,
And must be held to a higher standard.

Call: Speak now the Rule of Brigid, Eternal Flame of the Abbey!
Response: I will maintain loyalty to the endurance of my Order.
Call: For we will not survive unless we survive together,
And though we are all lights, only a great flame will warm us.

Call: Speak now the Rule of Shiva, Lord of the Cremation Ground,
Destroyer of Illusions!
Response: I will strive always for mindfulness and clarity of soul.
Call: For this discipline is great above all others.

Call: Hail Eunomia, Keeper of Rules,
Hora of the Upraised Hand!
Response: Hail Eunomia!

~~  The day of the sun god. ~~
~~ Helios, Apollo, Ogmios ~~

Throughout Japan the evil demons of winter are exorcised annually on
this day with a festival called the Setsu-bun. Beans are placed in
every corner of a family's house, and pointed branches and sardine
heads are mounted over the doors. Centuries-old purification rites are
performed by priests in all temples and shrines. Prayers are written
on slips of paper and then cast from bridges into the rivers below.

detail-oriented Virgo Moon helps us to better appreciate the little
things in life. We may attempt to keep our feelings in perspective,
yet something can unexpectedly set off current frustrations as the
Moon opposes unpredictable Uranus at 11:19 am EST. It's time to
separate the extraneous information from what is useful. We can learn
from analyzing even the most difficult situations and then applying
what we know as constructively as possible.

Summer's Joy
Queen of the Sky
Giver of Life
To our entire world
Weaver of sunbeams
Into golden robes of finery
Which you drape over us
Each time we emerge
Into your sacred light.
Laugh, Queen of Day!
Laugh and let your delicate
Fingers play across our eyes
That we may blink, and sting
The tears from them,
And open them again to see
Your golden world break
Over the eastern horizon.

Chant: Omikami Omikami Arigato Omikami

(Each person takes a candle and a procession is led from the room,
which divides into several groups. Each group goes to a different room
in the building and shines the light of their candle into all dark
places, corners, closets, under beds and in drawers, bringing light
and the gaze of Amaterasu into all places. Then the candles are
returned to Her altar to burn down, and are not snuffed until
sunset.)

A SPELL FOR WELL BEING
When you have been sick, but are beginning to feel better, this is a
good spell to cast.
It is energizing and will leave you feeling healthier than when you
began.
For periodic maintenance, you may want to use the spell twice a year.
Things you will need:
1 white or pink image candle powdered rose petals
push-pin thumbtack Star Oil (see below)
Carve your name, or that of the person for whom you are casting the
spell, onto the candle.
Anoint the candle with the oil and sprinkle with powdered rose petals.
Raise energy and focus on general well-being as you charge the candle.
Burn under the waxing moon, chanting:
Earth, Air, Fire, Water
Peace, Health, Joy, Laughter.
Peak the energy and let it fly out to the universe. Let the candle
burn completely.
(If you use runes you may also carve Sigil, Flame, and Caduceus in the
wax before
anointing the candle with oil.)

"Powers of Moisture and Wind
Blow away the darkness
And cleanse us with your life-giving dew
As life here on Earth begins anew!"-

OSTARA

(circa March 21)
(Eostar, Spring Equinox, March 20-23 dependent on actual astronomical
event) The Goddess blankets the Earth with fertility as the God
stretches and grows to maturity. The hours of day and night are equal
and light is overtaking darkness. This is a time of beginnings,
action, planting spells, and of tending the gardens.  This is the
start in the pagan year of spring, at least among Wiccans and Celtics.
The first flowers are praised and the God and Goddess thanked for the
true return to happier times for all. Ostara is one of the more
colorful holidays, not one of the somber colors found in Yule and
Candlemas. Feasting and socializing are the important factors in this
holiday as well as the celebration of the return of color to the
natural world.

In the Christian calendar, again to draw early worshipers, they marked
this as the final days and  rebirth of Jesus when according to
history

He died in June 7th 34 AD
