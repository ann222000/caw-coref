I have chipboard floors and will lay ply on top of that and then the tiles.
The `new floor` will butt up to a double sliding door runner and the ply +
tiles will be standing proud of the runner by a height of approx .75 of a
centimetre. Any ideas on how to edge this I have included a link (picture)
to explain better.

Laminate flooring threshold strip?

Plenty of choice.
