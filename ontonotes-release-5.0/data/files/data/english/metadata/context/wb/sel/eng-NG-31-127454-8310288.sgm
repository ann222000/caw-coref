If we are to think that the strange abandoned baby at King's Cross is a bit
of Voldemort, and King's Cross is a place that is not in the realm of the
dead (maybe some place between the living and the dead), then he may be
left there forever, unable to become fully dead, nor go back to the realm
of the living.

Is that what is meant by a fate worse than death?

This is something that only Rowling can conclusively answer, but yes, all
indications are that that is what she conceives of when she thinks of
a &quot;fate worse than death&quot;.

The King's Cross chapter intrudes more into the realm of theology and any of
the others, across all the seven books.

A fate worse than death would be to have nobody but Pettigrew to talk

Oh I can probably quote a few dozen Harry Potter erotic fanfics which
make a &quot;Fate Worse Than Death&quot; seem tame.

This could be wrong but here's what I gather of what happened to Voldemort.
His soul was so damaged and split that he wouldn't have had the choice, like
Harry did and most people should, to choose whether or not to pass on, so
yeah, he'd be eternally like the baby at King's Cross, unable to choose
anything different. I suppose the only way to have chosen anything different
is to have had real remorse during life?

Yeah, Harry tried briefly, but I think it was too late.  I'd have to
go back and read it again, but I seem to remember reading something to
the effect that having remorse was the only way to undo the horcruxes
(put his soul back together again)  But as the horcruxes had all been
killed, I guess that wasn't possible.

As I say, all we can do is guess wildly. There's no indication of _how much_
soul Voldemort had left after his final death, if he had any at all. We
also don't know what exactly King's Cross is supposed to represent and
whether it's just a unique figment of Harry's mind or an occurrence in the
after-life journey of all souls.

Also I hate to through around words like eternity. Their real import is not
even comprehendable to the human mind, so it's a word which, in almost all
contexts, is greatly diluted in meaning.

Hmmm ... I somehow don't think that was meant. Usually, &quot;a fate worse than
death&quot; implies living with something so horrible that being dead would be
preferable. Snape, knowing that he caused Lily's death would be pretty close
to such a fate. And I guess in Dumbledore's book living with just a 7th of
your soul qualifies, too.

The whimpering baby-like creature in Harry's King's Cross vision gave every
evidence of undergoing some very severe form of agony. It *might* be
physical, but it's more likely to be mental.

Look this is a toned-down description of what is supposed to happen to souls
that get trapped in the Hell-state, as described by most mainstream
religions. Rowling seems to be implying that Voldemort, because of his
ghastly deeds and lack of remorse till the very end, is now prevented
from &quot;moving onwards&quot;, as healthy souls do, and is caught in a place or
state of &quot;limbo&quot;, neither living nor &quot;dead and moved on&quot;, perpetually
undergoing acute suffering.

Dumbledore says as much when he tells Harry that the whimpering creature is
something beyond his or Harry's help.

A phrase like &quot;fate worse than death&quot; is bound to be interpreted in as many
manners as there are people. Snape lived a hellish life, true, but I
hesitate to call it &quot;fate worse than death&quot;, because if it was, Snape
would've committed suicide. It's as simple as that.

OTOH, Moaning Myrtle, and other unhappy ghosts, come(s) much closer to this
state, and she can't escape from it too. Remember Nearly-headless Nick says
to Harry in OotP that he regrets having feared death, since he's
now &quot;neither here nor there&quot;.

Except that Nearly Headless Nick is apparently supposed to be correct when
he (or JKR?) says that only wizards can be come ghosts; muggles always just
go on directly.

At that point in the story, Voldemort still has a horcrux in Nagini.  He
wouldn't have become the baby-thing until the rest of the book happens.
I believe that King's Cross is a kind of vision or Near Death Experience,
during which Harry sees psychically what Voldemort might become - essentially
a ghost infant, too frightened to go on and possibly held back by some of the
other things Voldemort did to try to become immortal, yet incapable of being
active in any way.  Since by JKR's definition NHN and the other ghosts are
sort of dead yet not properly dead (soul still on earth), Voldemort's last
piece of soul is suffering a fate worth than true full death would have been.

Each horcrux was destroyed, killing the soul fragment in it.  I believe that
the soul fragments weren't strong enough by themselves to survive after being
horcruxed and then de-horcruxed (remember the small animals that died after
being possessed by Voldemort).  The soul fragment that harry saw psychically
was the one that was still in Voldemort, and thus was not horcruxed.  Since
Voldemort had accidentally made seven horcruxes - thus splitting his soul
into eight parts, not seven - the fragment of soul left is barely able to
whimper.

So only humans can die? What about other magical creatures like Centaurs and
House Elves? Obviously they do die, but then what's different? Is it that
they lack a soul? Has Voldemort destroyed all his soul when he finally

That was said in the first one.  he might not be human enough to die.
