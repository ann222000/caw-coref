&gt; I support Julia's request for a new thread about Kali's puppies.
">

Thank you Julia and Montana for the thread.  I posted it here, simply
because Kali's name was in the subject line, so it would be easy to keep up.
Back home for a break.  Good news is, the pups can't possibly be Drakes, the
CBR down the road, because I have it on second hand authority that Drake is
fixed and has been fixed for years.  Just talked to Jen up the street, who
told me about Drake.  She said the 'farm dog' from up the gravel road that
leads into our road isn't fixed.  She caught him *on* her female pup just
the other day.  Her female hasn't been fixed yet, she was waiting for the
six month *rule* to have it done.  Farm dog is most likely an Aussie or
Aussie mix.  Robin said it's a very sweet dog, temperament wise, very much
like Kali.  And pretty close to Kali in size.

Kali's water hasn't broken yet, but she is definitely pacing, panting, etc.
The woman Robin met at SNAP (spay van) the other day has been in close touch
today.  She's from the next county over from us, to the north.  She's given
Robin her home and cell phone numbers, and set up an appointment on Monday
for Kali and the pups, if they are born this week-end,  to be seen by the
doctor that works with their county humane society.  Plus, she said if Kali
should need anything this week-end, if she can't give birth herself, this
doctor would do a C-section on her to deliver the pups.  So we feel much
better about it now, having somebody local to call.  We tried our own county
humane, but they never returned any calls.  It's a good thing Robin happened
upon this woman on Tuesday, because she has been a god-send.  Her program
will supply the worming medicine and the shots, although we will have to
administer the shots ourselves.

Kali is set up in our make-shift box, and appears to be contented in it
finally.  She really wanted to get outside and under the shed, didn't want
any part of the box.  But while I was over there, I filled the box with big
towels and laid down on the garage floor beside it.  Once I laid down there,
Kali got right in and settled into the softness.  I laid there beside her
stroking her and telling her how lucky she is to have a home and all, just
soothing her with my voice, etc.  She seemed quite content as long as I
stayed there with her.  Anyway, I stayed long enough I for her to become
*comfortable* that this was to be the place.  Robin's husband got home from
work and he's working in the garage now, where we have Kali all set up, so
she is being looked after.  Craig is a gem, he will be very good at all
this.  It was him that took care of the twins after they were born, because
Robin had a C-section and needed to stay in bed, not lift, etc.  So Craig is
very good with tiny little newborn beings.  He's very gentle and patient.
Hopefully they will come this week-end while he is home.

Will update if anything else happens.  Good news though that the pups can't
be Drakes.  And we have 'on-call' people, as none of the local vets do after
hours or week-ends.  We checked all 'round.

Way to go, TD!  Looks like you've dodged the first bullet, the
probability of pups too large to be birthed naturally. And you have
some local shoulders to lean on, too, and available by phone, even
including a vet, in case of problems.

Quite a turn-a-round.

Fingers and toes are crossed here.

Keep up the good work!

Td
about Kali and the pups
____________________
Td
Good luck and please do keep us posted.  It sounds like it is show
time/D-Day, but if you have time a whelping box may be a good thing.  It
can be nailed together in no time and consists of 2x?, squared off.  It
allows the Mama to step out and over, but not the pups, as time goes on.
Do we have any idea what the Mama dog is?
I got all freaked out about the only litter I ever bred.  It was
uneventful.  I had the luxury of a spare BR right across from ours, so
that was where we placed the whelping box.  The more I think about it,
you could construct it after birth.  It was quite handy to contain the
pups and allow the Mama a break.
The first pup was born in my bed, then we whisked her across the hall,
everything was all good from then on.  Of course she was used to us, our
house, etc.  unlike Kali.
Kali is one fortunate little girl.  I wish her well, oh yeah, same goes
for you and the rest of the family.  It is exciting and nerve-racking
especially when you have nothing to compare it to, and I did not.  I had
read all the books, counseled with the breeder, had the Vet on standby,
but all of that was out the window when it happened.  Best of Luck.

We don't have a whelping box, per se, but Robin read online about using a
baby pool.  Now I had that baby pool I bought this summer for my dogs to
cool off in.  They never used it to cool off, only as a HUGE water bowl.  ;)
It's not too big, definitely just the right size for Kali and pups, unless
she produces a gazillion of 'em or something.  ;&gt;   Which I doubt.  It's
probably got about 8 or 10 inch high side walls.  Kali can step in and out
very easily, but the pups won't be able to get out.  I filled it with big
beach towels and it's set on top of a big rug in the garage, so it's not
even on the hard cement floor.  That's why I was able to somewhat
comfortably lay on the garage floor beside it until Kali became accustomed
to using it herself.  Now she steps in and out at will.  We have her hooked
up to Merlins drop line, and the garage door open, so she can step outside
if she wants, get some fresh air, lay in the sun, etc., but she can't get
away.  She's been doing just that, laying in her *pool* for awhile and then
getting up and walking around outside some.  It's warm here, probably mid to
high '70's, sunny and beautiful weather predicted for the next 5 days at
least.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Some people suggested she might be some kind of Husky mix.  That's what she
looked like to me too.  She's small though, not as big as a Husky, but she
has black and white fur and markings similar to a Husky.  And her fur is a
bit longish like a Husky too.  Perhaps she's also mixed with some Aussie or
something like that.

We need to keep Kali in the garage because of Whisky and Monte and the three
toddlers.  ;-)   But the garage is attached to the house, and the door to
the garage leads straight out from the family room, so it's like just having
her in the next room.  And craig is sleeping downstairs on the family room
couch.    They are trying to recruit me for the midnight to 8 a.m. shift
though.  ;&gt;

Huskies really don't have &quot;longish&quot; coats, unless they're
woolies (mutants, basically).  They can have thick, dense,
plush coats, which isn't the same thing.  35-pound female
Siberian Huskies are pretty common and you occasionally see
smaller ones.  Show her to someone who knows what a Siberian
Husky actually looks like.

Thanks Jack, I'm feeling quite a bit better, less stressed.  John across the
road, is saving all his newspapers for us, and Jen down the road is
gathering up old towels and sheets and stuff to help out too.  Poor Jen
feels guilty because her's was the house Kali went to first.  But she had
her hands full with their full bred lab pup, and she just couldn't face also
taking in a stray.  Jen fed her and gave her water, but didn't let her come
into her house, so she moved two doors down to Robin's house.   She lucked
out in this road, because our house would have been the next one down.  ;)

Td, that sounds ideal (baby pool) easy to clean out, too.  I just sent
you an e-mail with some tips, but I am sure you are all prepared.  It
would be a good idea to locate some baby scales to weigh them at birth
to make sure they are continuing to thrive, as time goes by.  Also,
rifle through your sewing stuff and come up with yarn, ribbon, rick
rack, etc in a multitude of colors so you can differentiate between
them.  I used yarn and needed EIGHT colors with my Dobes.  I do believe
Montana used ribbon.  Anyway, I am sure you have everything all dialed
in, and are way ahead of the game.  Oh yeah, I used newspapers under the
towels, so call on your friends and family to save em up for you.
No doubt, the puppies are going to be cuddly and adorable.
Dang, why didn't I think of using a baby pool:)  They probably didn't
make them then:)
I think you should take the midnight shift, you are up all night:)

When I was a pre-teen or so I had an inflatable chair (hey,
it was the late '60s), which turned out to be completely
incompatible with a litter of kittens.  However, it'll be a
few weeks before they're active enough to damage it.

baby pools are commonly used. And I used a larger baby pool when they

Baby pools make fine whelping boxes.
If you get recruited for the midnight to 8 shift, my money is on you to do
the whelping. Their loss.

Sorry, I think I shot a blank, I'm so tired, three so far.  As for the
twins, they usually call 'em baby boy A and baby boy B.

In my friend's experience, the moment she knew she was carrying twins,
she was put in touch with a &quot;twins group,&quot; an informal club of parents
that got together and shared practical advice.  They had a little book
collection they loaned out, laughed about the sort of silly comments
people make to them, knew about schools and teachers, and basically
shared stuff to make the difficult parts easier.

From the start, the doctors labeled the twins fetus A and fetus B.  My
friends picked out 2 boy names (Ian and something I don't remember) and
2 girl names (Rose and Elizabeth).  When it was evident that they were
girls, B became Elizabeth because she'd be called Betsy, and A became
Rose by default.  When enough hair grew in, Betsy got hers cut in bangs,
B- Betsy- bangs for a mnemonic.  Before their hair grew in, Betsy was
the one with the portable oxygen tank.

Still, for all their matching DNA, parents and caregivers can tell their
children apart from a remarkably early age.

Six total, and all appear fine.  Kali ate a big breakfast, she hadn't eaten
yesterday.  Wasn't interested in any food.  They are so cute, a couple that
are shades of light sandy brown, one a bit lighter than the other, one black
one, one all white one, and two that somewhat appear to be boxers.  As of
the time I came home, they were all nursing fine.  Robin &amp; I were the ones
there.  Craig, phhht!  Here I thought he'd be good at this.  ;)   After the
first one popped out, he ran upstairs to get Robin out of bed saying &quot;Robin,
I need you, come quickly!&quot;  and she called me.  Craig went back to his bed
on the sofa.  Robin used those disposable surgical gloves and removed the
placentas when Kali was finished with each pup birthed, and occasionally we
had to help a pup find a tit, again with surgical gloves so as to not leave
our scent anywhere.  But other than that, we left them alone, not touching
or moving them around.   None of them needed assistance breathing.  Robin
had a syringe ready in case we needed to do any aspirating, but it wasn't
necessary.  Kali is a good momma, protecting her babies.  But she isn't
*uncomfortable* around either Robin nor me.  I petted her, crooned to her
during her delivery process.  She seems to enjoy that, being petted and told
what a good momma she is.  She also doesn't seem to mind either of us around
the babies.  We had a little portable electric heater running in the garage
all night long, still going.  Soon enough it should be sunny and in the high
seventies here, much like yesterday.  I'll send pictures to diddy and
montana.  I don't have a site, nor know how to make one for all to view, so

Hm. You may want to keep an eye on the all white one; in some breeds - and
boxers are one of them** - all-white or mostly white coloration can be
linked to deafness.
It's also linked to deafness in Border Collies and Australian Shepherds,
but in those breeds the white coloration combined with deafness (and
sometimes eye defects) is usually the result of breeding two merles
together.

They wouldn't necessarily look like him. This is a gross
oversimplification, but the dam could have passed on dominant traits that
override ones that would make the pups resemble the sire; or either parent
could have passed on recessives that aren't expressed in the parent but get
expressed in the offspring.
Also, it's possible for a litter of puppies to have more than one sire if
the mother had free choice while in heat. (As a side note, it's not
impossible in humans, either; IIRC, there are a couple of cases on record
where DNA testing showed human twins to have different fathers.)

Hit send too soon - the ** indicated my intent to note that some of the

Just returned home from puppy check.  We changed out a nice soft cotton
comforter/blanket for all the messy towels.  Kali was very good about it.  I
sat cross-legged on the floor with a big pillow in my lap while Robin placed
each of the pups on the pillow.  Kali was properly *concerned* but we
explained to her that we were cleaning her nest, putting nice fresh bedding
in for her.  Robin got the quilt down and I immedately began replacing the
pups, gloved hands, of course.  It was so cute to watch Kali do a 'head
count' when we were finished.  ;-)

From what we can tell, the two pups that resemble boxers are both male and
the other four are females.

We want so badly to touch the pups sans the gloves.  Any idea when we can do
that?  We both want to feel their tiny little pads and their puppy fur.  I
love the feel of puppy pads before they walk around on hard surfaces.

It's okay to touch them now, just carefully wash your
hands, say, up to your elbows, beforehand. Like a doctor would wash
his hands, scrub your nails, etc., to be on the safe side.

But don't handle them too much these first few days, if you can avoid
it.

&gt; &gt; Sorry, I seem to be shooting a lot of blanks lately, over-tired I guess
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; now running on finishing up a 10 cup coffee maker.  ;)   Did you get the
&gt; &gt; pictures, flick?  I sent them to you.

&gt; Yes, I got the pictures.  Thanks!

&gt; I tried to upload them to a flickr account, but with this dialup
connection,
&gt; it times out and I can't do it.

&gt; I see HJM put them up, though, which is great.

&gt; DD has fallen in love with the solid golden-white one.  Good thing we
don't
&gt; live very close to you, lol.

Don't start feeling too smug yet, I'm sure I could figure out a way to ship!
;-P    Robin loves the two that look like little tiny boxers.  Me, I haven't
decided yet which one I love.  I guess I'm waiting to see a bit of
personality, the whole package.  Right now I love them all equally still.
:-)

As I stated earlier, we are trying to handle them as little as possible
right now, as we had been advised.  A couple of them, probably the *ladies*
(yes, it's a JOKE folks), are doing a pretty good job at keeping their legs
together.  ;-&gt;

We've already had the loan of a puppy enclosure offered to us.  Or I think
Robin said it was a puppy play pen.  Anyway, it's been gratefully accepted,
so the friend of Robin's who offered it, is going to bring it over in the
near future, so we will be all ready when the need arises.

Great to know.  It was one of the Franklin County Humane people who told us
the puppies shouldn't have *our* scent on them because they wouldn't be able
to find Kali's nipples then.  We couldn't figure that out, but we thought
we'd better be safe than sorry, so we've rigidly followed those
instructions.  Today, as we were doing it, Robin said to me, &quot;since we've
both been petting and stroking Kali continually, to be sure she understands
we are there to help her only, and so that she trusts us completely around
both her and the pups, wouldn't you think we'd have enough of Kali's scent
on us to not confuse the pups?&quot;  To which I replied, 'yeah, one would think
that.'  But like I said, they told us to not get our scent on the pups as it
would *confuse* them.

I'll tell Robin &quot;Diddy says we can touch 'em'.  She'll be glad to hear that.

I
&gt; &gt;&gt;love the feel of puppy pads before they walk around on hard surfaces.

&gt; It's okay to touch them now, just carefully wash your
&gt; hands, say, up to your elbows, beforehand. Like a doctor would wash
&gt; his hands, scrub your nails, etc., to be on the safe side.

Yeah, we've been doing the hand scrubs even with the gloves.  ;-)   Can't be
too careful, 'eh?

All the while I was sitting there cross-legged, I'd have to keep pulling
back my hand, cause my natural instinct was to reach out and touch a little
puppy foot, or stroke a little scrunched up puppy forehead.  Thankfully, now
when I go back over, I can touch those little puppy pads.  They look so soft
and pink.  My absolute favorite part of new puppies, their little pads.

TD, in your photos, the puppies are on partial bare plastic. Put carpet in
there, or something that keeps the slick stuff covered. Otherwise those pups
are at risk of becoming swimmer pups. Ability to maintain traction is
critical to their development.

They seem a bit small, make sure you take daily weights on each and every
puppy.

With Danny's litter, I did not. On Day three, i picked the big one up and
compared his weight with the charts. He was the biggest puppy, and he lost
1/3 of his birth weight and i never noticed. (easy to do) And everyone else
lost proportionally. At that point, i realized they were not getting enough
milk, and in fact, she dried up totally. They quietly suckled, so being
contentedly quiet means nothing.

Check weights daily. Make sure they stay gaining.

baby scales are about $30 at babies-r-us.  A good investment I'd think.
I bought one to weigh my infirm cat!  My sister has borrowed it to weigh
things for ebay shipping.

&gt; You three (Kali, td &amp; Robin) did a GREAT job! Well done!

Thank you montana.  We were a bit nervous/scared/stressed when the first one
was born.  It seemed to take Kali a little while to catch on to what was
happening.  But once she got going, everything fell into place.  Thank
goodness that part is over anyway.  At least now we know how many we are
dealing with and all.

Never thought about shoes, but that's okay cause when Robin called last
night I just grabbed my robe to put on over my nightgown and a pair of
sweatpants to put on under my nightgown, and slipped into my crocs to run
next door.  It got pretty chilly last night, so I also grabbed a pair of
clean white socks out of my drawer, knowing that my feet would get damp in
the crocs from the nightdew on the grass.  So when I got there, I could slip
off my crocs at the door and pull on nice, clean white socks.  ;)   So
unknowingly, I was covered.  ;-)
