When you have some tiny (like pinpricks) rust spots and areas where the
original bluing shows holster-wear, will cold bluing deal with these
problems?  A recommended brand?

First thing is you must get rid of the rust or it will continue to eat away at
the metal, even if it's underneath a coating of blueing.  Judicious - and only
if you have practice with them - use of a fine cratex wheel on a dremel type
tool usually works but be warned, it's *extremely* easy to make a tiny problem
speck into a very large problem blemish.  Use extreme care when cleaning out
these tiny areas.  In fact, if they are small pits (and there are not too many
of them) I've used a needle and magnifying glass in the past with fairly good
results.

I've used both Birchwood Casey Perma Blue (in a toothpaste type tube) and lately
Brownells Oxpho Blue.  The Brownells seems to give a somewhat deeper blue color
on the first try.  Ultimately, they both have their applications and I still use
both but they are not compatible colorwise.

Also be aware that the larger the area, the more it's going to 'stick out'
compared to the rest of your firearm.  They also seem to me to wear much faster
than the surrounding blueing, something I guess we should expect.
Good luck,
Cheers,
jc

Just remember cold blue is for small areas and any area that the hand
constantly touches, like the grip area will result in the cold blue
wearing off no matter what brand you use and it will wear off in no
time at all.

The industry standard for years has been 44/40 Gun blue available from
Brownell's the gunsmithing supply house.

I have tried them all on small areas and &quot;Black Magic&quot; by
Kleen Bore
is the best by far.  I have heard that, that is what some gun
manufacturers use
for small touch up jobs on their guns. You will probably have to mail/
internet
order it. But it really works and gives a deep black/blue.

Brownell says about Oxpho-Blue -- &quot;The chemical goes through the oil on
the gun, removes thin rust and blues the steel underneath. No
after-rust.&quot;

Perhaps they are overstating things a little? Especially about the rust &amp; oil?

When trying to touch up small spots (holster wear), does it discolor
surrounding areas that have the factory bluing and give a mottled
appearance?

You've had luck with Kleen Bore products?  I haven't, except for their
bore brushes.

I use Oxpho blue and it works a whole lot better and much more consistently when
the area is clean.

My 2 cents and experience is to shell out the extra buck and a half
and get Birchwood Casey's &quot;Super Blue&quot;. Much better than the other
grades such as Permablue.

# The main thing is to have the reblued section absolutely clean ,no

Can't say it enough!! Absolutely clean.  I take it one step further.
After degreasing wash and rinse with some laundry detergent and water.
Small parts I boil with a dab of automatic dishwasher detergent. Do
not use dish soap it contains lanolin to keep your wife's hands soft.
The liquid blueing can leave a nasty stench in your finger nails that
takes days to go away, use rubber gloves.

Oxpho isn't the blue-blackest or the prettiest of the cold blues but
it is far and away the most durable and rust-preventative I've used.

I cold blued 3 guns in my life- a single barrel Victor Ejector 28 gauge, a
double barrel Ithaca 12 gauge that was sawed off, and an 1858 Remington
cap/ball revolver repro kit gun.

It's better than no bluing at all, but wears off faster than hot bluing.

If you only blue certain areas, you'll be able to see where you patch blued
it- you have to do the entire gun, for it to match.

Cold bluing tends to look &quot;shiny&quot; as well.

IMHO, there's no sub for a hot bluing done by a skilled 'smith.  The
qualifier is the latter, because my dad had a Browning A-5 Sweet 16 hot
blued, and the 'smith didn't do a good job at all- he should have left it
original.
