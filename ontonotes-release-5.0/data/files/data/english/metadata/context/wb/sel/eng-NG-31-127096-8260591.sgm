Democrats Refocus Message on Iraq After Military Gains
Criticism Shifts to Factional Unrest

By Jonathan Weisman and Anne E. Kornblut
Washington Post Staff Writers
Wednesday, August 22, 2007

Democratic leaders in Congress had planned to use August recess to raise the
heat on Republicans to break with President Bush on the Iraq war. Instead,
Democrats have been forced to recalibrate their own message in the face of
recent positive signs on the security front, increasingly focusing their
criticisms on what those military gains have not achieved: reconciliation
among Iraq's diverse political factions.

And now the Democrats, along with wavering Republicans, will face an
advertising blitz from Bush supporters determined to remain on offense.

Thereby forcing the Democrats on DEFENSE. -- DSH

A new pressure group, Freedom's Watch, will unveil a month-long, $15 million
television, radio and grass-roots campaign today designed to shore up
support for Bush's policies before the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq,
Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, lays out a White House assessment of the war's
progress. The first installment of Petraeus's testimony is scheduled to be
delivered before the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees on
the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a fact both
the administration and congressional Democrats say is simply a scheduling
coincidence.

Hilarious! -- DSH

The leading Democratic candidates for the White House have fallen into line
with the campaign to praise military progress while excoriating Iraqi
leaders for their unwillingness to reach political accommodations that could
end the sectarian warfare.

They also reiterate the Democrat Mantra &quot;We thank you for your service&quot; to
all the folks who have served or are serving -- thinking it will protect
them from criticism.  They have learned NOT to repeat that mistake from The
Vietnam War -- of dumping on, excoriating and castigating the TROOPS -- as
John Kerry did before Congress in 1971. -- DSH

&quot;We've begun to change tactics in Iraq, and in some areas, particularly in
Anbar province, it's working,&quot; Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) said in
a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Monday.

&quot;My assessment is that if we put an additional 30,000 of our troops into
Baghdad, that's going to quell some of the violence in the short term,&quot; Sen.
Barack Obama (D-Ill.) echoed in a conference call with reporters Tuesday. &quot;I
don't think there's any doubt that as long as U.S. troops are present that
they are going to be doing outstanding work.&quot;

And just where were Hillary and Barak on the SURGE in the First Place? --
DSH

Advisers to both said theirs were political as well as substantive
statements, part of a broader Democratic effort to frame Petraeus's report
before it is released next month by preemptively acknowledging some military
success in the region. Aides to several Senate Democrats said they expect
that to be a recurring theme in the coming weeks, as lawmakers return to
hear Petraeus's testimony and to possibly take up a defense authorization
bill and related amendments on the war.

BINGO!  They are attempting to FRAME THE DEBATE -- to their ADVANTAGE.  But
will they be able to shut up and muzzle Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi? -- DSH

For Democratic congressional leaders, the dog days of August are looking
anything but quiet. Having failed twice to crack GOP opposition and force a
major change in war policy, Democrats risk further alienating their restive
supporters if the September showdown again ends in stalemate. House
Democratic leaders held an early morning conference call yesterday with
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton (D-Mo.), honing a new
message: Of course an influx of U.S. troops has improved security in Iraq,
but without any progress on political reconciliation, the sweat and blood of
American forces has been for naught.

And what will Cindy Sheehan DO and SAY? -- DSH

House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel (D-Ill.) made a round of calls
yesterday to freshman Democrats, some of whom recently returned from trips
to Iraq and made news with their positive comments on military progress.
&quot;I'm not finding any wobbliness on the war -- at all,&quot; Emanuel said.

Whereas some Democrats definitely WANT wobbliness. -- DSH

The burst of effort has been striking, if only because Democrats left for
their August recess confident that Republicans would be on the defensive by
now. Instead, the GOP has gone on the attack. The new privately funded ad
campaign, to run in 20 states, features a gut-level appeal from Iraq war
veterans and the families of fallen soldiers, pleading: &quot;It's no time to
quit. It's no time for politics.&quot;

BINGO! -- DSH

&quot;For people who believe in peace through strength, the cavalry is coming,&quot;
said Ari Fleischer, a former Bush White House press secretary who is helping
to head Freedom's Watch.

&lt;G&gt; -- DSH

GOP leaders have latched on to positive comments from Democrats -- often out
of context -- to portray the congressional majority as splintering. Rep.
Ellen O. Tauscher (D-Calif.), an Armed Services Committee member who is
close to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), said many of her colleagues
learned a hard lesson from the Republican campaign.

&quot;I don't know of anybody who isn't desperately supportive of the military,&quot;
she said. &quot;People want to say positive things. But it's difficult to say
positive things in this environment and not have some snarky apologist for
the White House turn it into some clipped phraseology that looks like
support for the president's policies.&quot;

&quot;Desperately Supportive&quot; -- Aye.  Hilarious! -- DSH

Rep. Jerry McNerney (D-Calif.), who made waves when he returned from Iraq by
saying he was willing to be more flexible on troop withdrawal timelines,
issued a statement to constituents &quot;setting the record straight.&quot;

&quot;I am firmly in favor of withdrawing troops on a timeline that includes both
a definite start date and a definite end date,&quot; he wrote on his Web site.

He's afraid of the Loony Left in his own Party. -- DSH

But in an interview yesterday, McNerney made clear his views have shifted
since returning from Iraq. He said Democrats should be willing to negotiate
with the generals in Iraq over just how much more time they might need. And,
he said, Democrats should move beyond their confrontational approach, away
from tough-minded, partisan withdrawal resolutions, to be more conciliatory
with Republicans who might also be looking for a way out of the war.

&quot;We should sit down with Republicans, see what would be acceptable to them
to end the war and present it to the president, start negotiating from the
beginning,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;I don't know what the [Democratic] leadership
is thinking. Sometimes they've done things that are beyond me.&quot;

HILARIOUS! -- DSH

In the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination, former senator John
Edwards issued a scathing attack on Clinton's remark. But he said there has
been &quot;progress in Al-Anbar province.&quot;

Is this the same John Edwards who said there IS NO War On Terror -- that
it's just a &quot;Bumpersticker Slogan&quot;? -- DSH

&quot;Senator Clinton's view that the President's Iraq policy is 'working' is
another instance of a Washington politician trying to have it both ways,&quot;
Edwards campaign manager David Bonior said in a statement. &quot;You cannot be
for the President's strategy in Iraq but against the war. The American
people deserve straight talk and real answers on Iraq, not double-speak,
triangulation, or political positioning.&quot;
---------------------------------------------------------

DEEEEEELIGHTFUL!

However, Hillary is VERY accomplished at talking out of both sides of her
large, German mouth and at TRIANGULATION and POLITICAL POSITIONING.  Hill &amp;
Bill turned it into an ART FORM during their two previous Administrations.
Now Hillary wants two more.
