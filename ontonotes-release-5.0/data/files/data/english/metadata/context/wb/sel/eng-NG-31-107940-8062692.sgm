Wow what a week! AirVenture 2007 was amazing... people... planes...
toys... planes... food... planes... beer... and more planes. What
could  be better?

I have posted more thoughts and 35 photos on my blog at
http://cheerfulcurmudgeon.com/2007/07/29/oshkosh-airventure-2007-part-2/

Fantastic, Art -- and, hey -- the best picture on your site is the one
of you and Dave that I took!

:-)

BTW: I personally saw you take 35 pictures in about 20 minutes one
day.  Where are the other 2000 pics?

Jay,

Oh c'mon, you exaggerate. I shot 336 pictures last week, not
2000. :-)

When I was a kid, my dad taught me that if 10% of my pictures are
worth sharing with other people and 3% are worth printing, I'm doing
darned well. I was tickled pink this morning when I counted out 35
pictures and realized that I had hit the 10% (because I don't count
the one you took [which is outstanding, BTW] or the one of the balsa
wood glider).

So the other 313 pictures are on my laptop and nobody will ever see
most of them and the world is a better place because of it.

Cheers,
-- Art Z.

True enough.

The part that kills me about digital photography is the amount of time
it takes to go through and view, enhance and crop them.   If it takes
only a minute to do each picture (and I've found it takes longer,
usually), you're looking at over 5 HOURS of time (without a break) on
your computer!

They lied to us when they said that computers would save us time...

They did, indeed. But hearken back a mere 10 years when you could
shoot the same number of pictures in the same amount of time, wait a
week to see them AND pay 9 dollars a roll before you realized you
needed to shoot that last one again. Lessee: about 10 rolls of film at
about $5 a roll plus at least $ for developing is $110. So 7 days and
$110 could get you the same pics, maybe.

Yeah, computers suck but they satisfy that need for immediacy! ;)

It is (still) in Beta.  Animated Weather, DUATS support, W&amp;B, A/FD, route
planning all working (and lots more).  Expiration page needs work.  If you
have the Smartphone version, make sure that you upgrade to 2.0.0.5 Beta.

I'm working 24/7 on WingX.  In fact, a user was having some problems on his
Q that we could not reproduce.  I met up with him at Oshkosh on the
flight-line.  Spoke with him about the problem; we weren't able to reproduce
it because it seems to be very 'location-specific' (cell phone tower and
reception specific).  I drove back to the hotel and worked on a fix to
handle poor reception areas for several hours 9connected remotely to my
machine in San Jose, CA), then posted the fix on our web site so that he
could automatically upgrade his WingX while at Oshkosh and test it the next
day.  So, I promise, we're working really hard at getting it out.  It will
be released (non-Beta) in August.

Screen shots: http://www.hiltonsoftware.com/sp

If anyone is interested, send me an email and I'll get the install
instructions out to you.

NEWPS: Please call or email and let's talk about what you'd like to see in
WingX and/or what you'd like improved.

Thanks,

Hilton

Jay,

That would certainly be true if I edited every photo. I only tweak the
few that I will post and, most of the time, I don't tweak at all.

BTW, Nikon Capture NX http://www.capturenx.com/ makes &quot;basic&quot; image
editing very quick and easy. Highly recommended. It's not Photoshop,
you *cannot* paint or smudge or combine images, etc. But it trivially
corrects lighting, exposure, shadows that are too deep, etc.

Cheers,

Art,

I cheat a little. I don't have any idea what operating system you use
but there's a free Power Toy for Windows XP which makes pretty short
work of getting the picture size under control for the web. It's
called, simply, the Image Resizing tool. Install it, select a bunch of
images, right click, choose Resize and then select the size you want
all those pictures to be. A couple minutes later and all you've got to
do is the HTML work!

I would like the Beta version.  I even got an email from you saying to
go ahead and try the Beta.  I downloaded something that said it was for
Windows Mobile, it doesn't work on the Smartphone.  It installed but it
doesn't do anything when you launch it.  I have the link to directly
from the Smartphone to your site but all it says is the Smartphone
version will be downloadable here.  As for features I like what you're
doing.  I'm not hoping for much with the radar picture as I have a
program and a couple of websites for that already for the Q.  It frankly
just isn't all that good.  I really want the W+B and flight planning
like on my Axim X51.  Personally I don't need or want the FAR's.  Just
wastes space.  Don't care if you include the airport freq's, etc.  I
have that already on my 296 as well as my Flight Guide, both of which
are easier to access than a PDA.  Maybe a link to the Beta version?
That would be great.  Thanks.
