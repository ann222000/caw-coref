Big Houses Are Not Green: America's McMansion Problem
By Stan Cox, AlterNet
Posted on September 8, 2007, Printed on September 15, 2007

In Los Gatos, Calif., controversy has raged this summer over the city planning
commission’s approval of a proposed hillside home that will occupy a whopping 3,600
square feet – and that's just the basement.  Atop that walkout basement will be 5,500
more square feet worth of house.

The prospective owner says he’ll build to &quot;green&quot; standards, but at the Aug. 8 meeting
where the permit was approved, the city's lone dissenting planning commissioner stated
the obvious when he told the owner, &quot;You have a 9,000-square-foot house with a
three-car garage and a pool. I don't see that as green.&quot;

The just-popped housing bubble has left behind a couple of million families in danger
of losing their homes to foreclosure.  It has also spawned a new generation of big,
deluxe, under-occupied houses bulked up on low-interest steroids.

The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) estimates that 42 percent of newly
built houses now have more than 2,400 square feet of floorspace, compared with only 10
percent in 1970.  In 1970 there were so few three-bathroom houses that they didn't
even to show up in NAHB statistics.  By 2005, one out of every four new houses had at
least three bathrooms.

Smaller families are living in bigger houses.  In the America of 1950, single-family
dwellings were being were built with an average of 290 square feet of living space per
resident; in 2003, a family moving into a typical new house had almost 900 square feet
per person in which to ramble around.

Not surprisingly, monster houses are especially popular in Texas; in Austin, regarded
as the state’s progressive haven, 235 new houses of at least 5,000 square feet each
were built in a single recent year; 41 of them had between 8,000 and 29,000 square
feet. In the size of our dwellings, North Americans are world champions. The United
Nations says houses and apartments in Pakistan or Nicaragua typically provide
one-third of a room per person; it’s half a room per person in Syria and Azerbaijan,
about one room in Eastern Europe, an average of a room and a half in Western Europe,
and two whole rooms per person in the United States and Canada (not counting spaces
like bathrooms, hallways, porches, etc.)

The U.N. defines a room as &quot;an area large enough to hold a bed for an adult&quot; -- at
least 6 feet by 7 feet.  That's not an uncommon size in many countries, but it’s not
exactly the kind of room that an American real-estate agent would be eager to walk
through with a prospective homebuyer.  (A dozen such rooms would fit into a single
bedroom in

href=&quot; http://www.deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,695193773,00.html &quot;&gt;this surgeon’s
house.)

To go along with those big primary homes, Americans now own 5.7 million non-rental
vacation houses with a median size of 1,300 square feet; together, those second homes
represent enough surplus living space to accommodate the nation’s homeless population
ten times over. Challenges to the oversized-house trend are being mounted across the
country, most often on aesthetic grounds.  Monumental bad taste can be morbidly
fascinating (as when CBS’s 60 Minutes paid a visit to the suburbs of &quot;Vulgaria&quot; last
March), but a far more serious issue is the lasting environmental damage these
incredible hulks can do. Since 1940, the average number of people living in an
American home has dropped from 3.7 to 2.6, but the average size of new houses has
doubled.  That extra space has gone partly to free children from having to share a
bedroom, partly to accommodate Americans’ ever-growing bulk of material possessions,
and partly to make room for more lavish entertaining.

But if there seems to be no limit to the size of the material- and energy-hogging
houses built in recent years, it's thanks most of all to that good old law of
supply-and-demand run amok.

A little brown house beats a big green one

The current slump notwithstanding, homebuilding continues to account for a big slice
of the nation's resource consumption.  For example, the manufacture and transportation
of concrete to build a typical 2,500-square-foot house generates the equivalent of 36
metric tons of carbon dioxide.

Construction and remodeling of residences accounts for three-fourths of all the lumber
consumed each year in the US.  In this business, there’s no substitute for good
old-fashioned wood. Laid end-to-end, the pieces of lumber required to build a typical
3,000-square-foot house would stretch for more than four miles.

In its review of the year 2004, the Western Wood Products Association (WWPA) crowed
that &quot;an all-time high of 27.6 billion board feet of lumber was used in residential
construction, framing some 2.07 million housing starts recorded for the year. Lumber
used in repair and remodeling surpassed 20 billion board feet for the first time in
history.&quot;  Consumption broke records again in 2005 for the fourth straight year, only
to fall with the housing slump that began in 2006. Wood, unlike concrete, gets some
credit for being a &quot;renewable&quot; resource.  Spokespeople for the lumber and construction
industries emphasize that they are taking greenhouse carbon out of the atmosphere and
locking it away in wood-frame houses.

That’s correct, as far as it goes; about half of the mass in a stick of lumber is
carbon.   But putting that wood into a house is a one-time capture, whereas the house
itself will spend decades cranking out carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Over
a 50-year lifetime, greenhouse emissions caused by the standard American house account
for 30 to 40 times the weight of the carbon that's socked away in its wood frame.  The
bigger the house, the bigger the emissions.

Furthermore, with the currently popular focus on the sheer quantity of greenhouse gas
emissions, the ecological impact of uprooting complex forest ecosystems in favor of
industrialized wood plantations doesn’t figure very prominently.  And a &quot;green&quot;-built
house can require almost 50 percent more wood than a standard house of the same size.
Hard times in the housing market will provide forests and the atmosphere at least a
little bit of much-needed rest.

The current bust has already curbed lumber consumption, although WWPA expects demand
to &quot;rebound&quot; in 2009.  Meanwhile, the American Chemistry Council reports that
production the plastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) fell sharply in 2006.
Environmentalists have long sought to stem the highly toxic production of PVC, 80
percent of which is used in construction.

But, as environmentally significant as construction materials are, it’s estimated that
only about one-tenth of a house’s total energy consumption occurs while it's being
built; the other 90 percent happens while it’s being lived in.  That can be reduced by
&quot;green&quot; construction, but making green houses too big can cancel out all of those
gains.  A 2005 article (pdf) in the Journal of Industrial Ecology concluded,

[Block quote] A 1,500-square-foot house with mediocre energy-performance standards
will use far less energy for heating and cooling than a 3,000-square-foot house of
comparable geometry with much better energy detailing. Downsizing a conventionally
framed house by 25 percent should save significantly more wood than substituting the
most wood-efficient advanced framing techniques for that house. And it is easier to
reduce the embodied energy of a house by making the house smaller than by searching
for low embodied-energy materials.

Note the important word &quot;geometry.&quot;  To make outsized suburban manors more
interesting, builders tend to avoid boxy forms, loading up their product with multiple
rooflines and gables, dormers, bay windows, and other protuberances.  Such houses have
more surface area than does a squared-off house of the same size, thus requiring more
fossil-fuel to cool and heat them.  Additional energy is wasted by the longer
heating/cooling ducts and hot-water pipes in a big house. And for a given house design
– &quot;green&quot; or standard, monolithic or pseudo-Victorian -- the bigger its square
footage, the bigger its environmental footprint.

A question of &quot;want&quot;

Although American houses have been growing since World War II, the low mortgage rates
and hot housing market of the past decade are widely credited with pushing square
footage to record levels. It’s partly simple math and partly not-so-simple psychology
-- and it's all about money.

At the interest rates prevailing in 2003, according to the Wall Street Journal’s
Jonathan Clements, you could buy a 40-percent bigger house and owe $273 less per month
on your mortgage than if you were buying the smaller house at 1983-level interest rates.

Of course, noted Clements, you could show some restraint, buy a smaller house at the
2003 interest rate, and save another $281 per month.  But the real-estate industry
isn’t all that interested in helping you downsize and stow the savings in your bank
account or 401(k) plan.  The question that the industry urges homebuyers to ask
themselves is not, &quot;How much do I want to save on my monthly house payment and utility
bills?&quot; but rather, &quot;How much house can I afford?&quot;

The heavy-breathing house market of the past few years added to the pressure by
shifting many buyers’ emphasis away from acquiring shelter and toward making an
investment.  Within a given neighborhood, houses are sold more or less by the square
foot.  So in boom times, the bigger and more expensive the house you buy, the bigger
the profit you can make by selling it a few years later.

The steep inflation in house prices that hit some cities during the bubble spurred
big-home sales all across the country.  At the height of the boom, the Wall Street
Journal cited the example of a San Jose, Calif., couple who bought a 1,250-square-foot
house in 2000 for $415,000, sold it in 2004 for $593,000, and bought a house in
Bozeman, Mont., for $425,000 – a house nearly three times as large as the one they
sold, giving them plenty of cash left over to fill it with furniture and appliances.

Ollie Bohnert, a real-estate agent in St. Louis -- where the housing boom-and-bust has
been milder than in many other big cities -- says that she sees houses of all sizes
selling well.  From her experience with house shoppers, she told me, &quot;Buying a big
house is not a question of need but a question of 'want'.&quot;  I asked her if, for a
realtor, a big house has a bigger commission payoff per hour of time invested.  She
said, &quot;Large houses typically take a little more time, because there are a limited
number of buyers.  But it depends.  I've had small houses sell  quick, and I've had
large houses sell very quick.&quot;

When you can't afford not to tear it down

Square-footage fever emerges in a doubly wasteful form in cities where normal-sized,
sound, comfortable houses are being demolished to make way for bigger, more luxurious
ones.

In North Carolina’s thriving Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill triangle, demolition permits
for single-family homes are currently being issued at the blistering rate of 42 per
month.  Speaking to the Raleigh News and Observer in June, the city’s planning
director described homeowners’ motivation this way: &quot;They have homes that are built in
the '50s and '60s that are somewhat outdated for the lifestyle.&quot;

Last year, Les Christie of CNNMoney.com attempted to provide homeowners with an answer
to the question, &quot;Is your house a teardown candidate?&quot;  He advised that &quot;even
beautiful homes in excellent shape can be torn down,&quot; if they have come to be
surrounded by larger ones.  But taking a wrecking ball to your home-sweet-home makes
the most sense when real-estate prices are running wild.

Christie used the example of &quot;a little bungalow&quot; in suburban Dallas valued at
$500,000.  The demolition cost would be comparatively trivial, and it would cost a
builder about $600,000 to replace it with a &quot;new, upscale house&quot; of 3,000 square feet.
In that situation, &quot;if nearby new homes are valued at $1.2 million or more,&quot; economic
logic dictates that the owner of a perfectly good house should tear it down and
replace it -- or sell it at a big profit to a mansion-building company that will
demolish the house to get the lot.

Edmund C. Grant, an attorney in Lexington, Mass., who works in land-use and real
estate law, told me that Lexington got an early start on the &quot;mansionization&quot; trend
when 1950s- and '60s-era ranch and Cape-Cod style houses began being demolished in the
1990s to make way for houses two-and-a-half to three times their size.  The trend drew
renewed energy from the early-2000s boom, when, says Grant, &quot;Property values rose 65
percent in just five years.&quot;

A long-time opponent of teardowns, Grant sees the future as unpredictable: &quot;It remains
to be seen whether the jumbo loans that support these houses can continue&quot; in light of
the current turmoil in the mortgage industry.   But, he laments, &quot;There seems to be a
certain inevitability about it.  The trend started in older, more densely populated
parts of the country [like Lexington], but it has spread to most markets.  People
object to the first teardowns that happen in their neighborhood, but eventually, they
seem to get used to it – especially when they see studies showing that teardowns tend
to raise all property values in the neighborhood.&quot;

I asked Grant -- who was on his city’s planning commission in the '90s and currently
serves on its board of assessors -- if there have been attempts to put legal limits on
square footage of houses in Lexington, as has been done in some other liberal cities
like Boulder, Colo.  To do so, it turns out, would actually be illegal, because
Massachusetts state law forbids local governments to restrict the amount of indoor
floor space that a house can have.  &quot;It’s considered a property-rights intrusion,&quot;
Grant says.  Can the law be overturned?  &quot;I don't know.  The real-estate lobby is
pretty strong in this state.&quot;

When questions of property rights and house size come up, things seems to move in only
one direction, and that's up.  Many neighborhood homeowner associations across the
country mandate a minimum size -- often 2,500 to 3,000 square feet – for new houses.
Under their rules, property rights are sacrificed for the sake of perceived property
values.

An SUV that runs for 100 years?

The long-term impact of titanic houses parallels that of gas-gulping SUVs and pickup
trucks.  Sales of the big vehicles may be ebbing, but the buying binge of the past
decade means they’ll still be out there by the millions, belching pollutants, for
years to come.  In the same way, even if the mania for big houses fades, Americans
will be stuck with heating, cooling and powering the millions of them already
littering the landscape – not for years like SUVs, but for decades.

To tackle the problems created by these multistory SUVs-without-wheels in a
resource-limited world, Don Fitz, editor of the Green journal Synthesis/Regeneration,
has suggested a mathematically obvious but too-often overlooked solution: to have more
people living in each house.  For example, he says, extended families could regroup,
or all-too-common municipal laws against unrelated people living under the same roof
could be eliminated.

In the current climate, though, political pressures are pushing in precisely the
opposite direction. In July, the commissioners of Cobb County, Ga., passed an
ordinance requiring all houses in the county to have at least 390 square feet of
living space per adult.  The new law, widely seen as a weapon to be used against
immigrant residents, would prohibit more than four people over 18 from living in a
1,600-square-foot house.

Very few houses now being built are as energy-efficient as they could be, and there is
no good excuse for that.  In one recent survey of 33 nonresidential green buildings
across the country, their construction costs were found to average only about two
percent more than what they would have cost had they been standard buildings (pdf).
Built according to specifications of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
(LEED) system, the green buildings are predicted to provide energy and environmental
savings averaging about 75 cents per square foot per year over 20 years.

Yet such prospective savings, if they can also apply to single-family homes, might
simply serve the industry as yet another inducement that sells even more square
footage -- as in, &quot;Hey, with this bigger LEED house, you'll get a couple more rooms,
and it'll be like you're heating and cooling them for free!&quot;

Clearly, the issue of mansionization will have to be yanked out of the tangle of other
housing issues and dealt with as a serious problem in its own right.  The individual
question, &quot;How much house can I afford?&quot; will have to give way to the public policy
question, &quot;How much house can we afford?&quot;

Still the most concise explanation of how we are who we are:

&quot;Let me give you a word of the philosophy of reform. The whole history of the progress
of human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to her August claims, have been
born of earnest struggle. The conflict has been  exciting, agitating, all-absorbing,
and for the time being, putting all other tumults to silence. It must do this or it
does nothing. If there is no struggle there is no progress. Those who profess to favor
freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the
ground, they want rain without thunder and lightening. They want the ocean without
the awful roar of its many waters.&quot;
&quot;This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may be
both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a
demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly
submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will
be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words
or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those
whom they oppress.&quot;
