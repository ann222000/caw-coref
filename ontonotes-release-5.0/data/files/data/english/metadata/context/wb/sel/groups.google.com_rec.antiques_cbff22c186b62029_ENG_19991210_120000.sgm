Well, the chances of cats having souls is absolutely equal
to the chances of human beings having souls.
And that is the cold hard truth of it.

And since no one really knows, despite what they may say,
what one chooses to believe, you have put this question
in it's tenderest form, and what to tell the kiddies, is laregely
a matter of expediency. Personally, I plan to try to have the
courage to just be scared shitless when I see the face of
the Grim Reaper. But, I am not going to castigate myself for
it if I find that I do not have the courage to do so. If I
fail and find myself irresistably drawn back to the stories
of eternal life I was told when I was a kid myself, then
that will be just the best I could do in a really, really bad
situation.

I have been thinking lately that I might like to have this
epitath- &quot;Here lies 13 Ghosts. He believed in Jesus the
best that he could.&quot;

On the other hand, and it is difficult to be objective about
such things, there have been certain experiences of mine
that might count as evidence of some sort of higher power.
Who knows, perhaps there is such a thing. But if there is
such a thing, it is so far outside our ability to understand
it that it just about doesn't matter.

Which kind of gets us back to where we started. The interpretation
of such things, our subjective experiences, are many fold.
All over the world men have grappled with these same ideas
and come to various conclusions, conclusions that are at
odds with each other. And they hate each other for existing.
Not for existing as fellow humans, but for existing as a threat
to the belief system they have that keeps the Boogie Man away.

Which again, brings us back to where we started. Surely we
must keep the Boogie Man away from our children, surely
that is the right thing to do. We must all say to each other
in dire circumstances, even though we know that it is not
true, something like, &quot;There, there. It is going to be all right.&quot;

So, the answer is yes, cats have souls, whether it is true or not.

Hi, T. First, I gotta say that I've been pretty pissed at your
treatment of Mari. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't really
think that kind of cruelty is called for here. But ... and it's a
BIG but ... I have to say that this is an absolutely wonderful post.
I could not agree more with everything that you said -- and that you
said so well. Thanks.

Sorry you think so, Marshall.
It's a long story and it would take an hour
or more searching Deja News to provide
examples to prove my point, but you know
that I am not a liar, I think. So, I hope
you will just trust me when I say that
she has repeatedly come here and started
trouble. And, please note this, I have tried
repeatedly to exercise a live and let live
policy with her. Those are facts.

It's also a fact that she is a liar. I don't suppose
I need to say how liars tear at the fabric of
society. Take any group, a family, a union, a country
and see what liars bring to it. Nothing but grief.

Imagine a Usenet group. Say, rec.plumbers.discussion.
Someone starts posting there who claims to have
been a plubmers assistant for 25 years. And yet
they don't know shit from sewer pipe. How would
that poster fare there? How would that poster fare
there if they had from the first been stirring up shit,
starting trouble, making senseless arguements
and generally being a real pain in the ass? The
plumbers would hoot her out of there in a heartbeat,
right?

Well, Marshall, I tried repeatedly, forgive me
if I repeat myself, to exercise a policy of live and let
live. But Mari just kept stirring up shit. And about
the time she started giving Charleen a hard time
for giving her (Mari) a dose of the cold hard truth,
which was and is that Mari does not know jack
shit about antiques despite her claim to have
been in the biz for 25 years, I decided to give
her (Mari) some shit AND the sewer pipe upside the
head. Charleen practically started this group and
she is one of the best contributors we have.
I'll be damned if some lying moron is going
to run Charleen off.

So, if after reading this, Marshall, you think I am
just a big meanie, beating on poor innocent Mari,
there is nothing I can do about it. I think that my
actions are justified and that they are justified
by the nature of Mari's repeated lies and repeated
disruptions. You might not agree, Marshall.
And I am sorry if you do not. But I did what I thought
was the right thing to do.

Oh, Hi Charleen. I was just talking about you.
Were your ears burning? ;)
Griffin and Sabine? Nope. I looked
in Bibliofind and it just gives the title,
&quot;Griffin &amp; Sabine: an extraordinary correspondence&quot;.
No, I am sure I never read it. Is it good?

You know, I think I know why people think I am you.
It's because I occaisonally fuck with people who fuck
with you. I do this because you are one of our very
best contributors AND because you stood up for me
once long ago, you probably don't even remember.
But I have never forgotten it.

Long ago, back when I was a normal person with
a normal job, I was a bartender. And I noticed a strange
thing. Wnenever the shit started to fly (I used to work
in some places that might as well have been named
&quot;The Bucket of Blood&quot;) other guys who were bartenders
at other bars would stand up. Literally stand up.
This meant a lot to me. If you have never had some
coked out psycho in your face, you just haven't lived. ;)
And if you have never had friends who would stand
up when some psycho starts up, you have never lived
at all.

Ah, poor Mari. Innocent victim of the spite of the meanies
of rec.antiques.

;)

&gt;&gt;You *did* tell him they have nine lives, of course?

"/> Nine lives on cats, I can account for that one. I had a really nice gold/white
striped tigger cat years ago. He lived for 9 years no matter what trouble he
got in. Until one day he caught a cat virus that he had all his shots for. As
for souls I look at it this way. God made all of creation. When we died our
body's go to the ground our souls go to heaven or hell as he so chooses from
the life we have lived. I think we could see animials in heaven. He created
them.

Here's a sad but, kinda nice story that will make you think &amp; scratch your
heads on.

After we put Baby my cat at peace cause there was nothing we could do for him,
the vet couldn't even save him. We buried him in my husband favorite T-shirt
Baby loved to sleep on. wrapped him in it &amp; buried him in our flower bed at the
apartments we lived at the time.

That flowerbed wouldn't grow anything no matter what you did to it. After we
layed him to rest a beautiful rose bush starting blooming their on it's own.
It's there as of today. Every time spring comes around I go over to see how
it's doing. The new resident has no idea why it keeps growning. She says all
she does is water it &amp; that area has no sunshine. She has put a fence around
the area to keep kids out.

You tell me. I think it's baby's way of saying I'm still here in spirit, don't
ever forget me. I tell that rose bush I won't.

Not wanting to get involved in a religious debate at Christmas, but your
argument is flawed logically. The choice is not to be a Christian or to
be an atheist. The world has thousands of religions. Therefore, by
choosing to practice Christianity, you are eschewing other faiths which,
from a purely logical standpoint, may be the one true faith, and
therefore you could be giving up your chance at redemption. I'm not
trying to argue this is the case, I'm just saying that you're argument
here is flawed.

I'm not trying to attack you religious beliefs, just your logic on this
point. You can't choose to believe in a particular religion because it
is &quot;safer&quot; to believe. The only reason to believe is because you do
believe. True religion is based on faith, and a person who professes
faith he doesn't possess is a hypocrite.

Now I'll get off my soap box.

I must say, in retrospect, that was pretty damn insensitive thing for
me to post. I have a dry sense of humor coupled with a healthy dose
of skeptacism. Although my quip was funny in it's own right, it
wasn't really appropriate. I'm sorry, Paula, for making a joke of

Heck no, Bob. Glad to see another point of view on the subject.
Lord knows I don't claim to know the secrets of the universe. ;)

I might hazard a guess as to why being ethical would still
be a good idea in a world that had no heaven and hell, though.
It would be prudent to do so. The world runs better, things
are better for everyone, when there are honesty and social
justice etc. The fruits of this sort of behavior are in this
world. If those kinds of actions bear fruit in some other
existence, good. But the reason for them is not IMO some
reward in the great beyond. The reason for behaving
honestly etc. is that the reward for them is something
we experience in the here and now.

And yeah, sure, liars and cheaters do gain by their behavior.
But their gain is at the expense of us all. That's what is so
galling about their behavior. Anybody can lie and cheat. It
is childsplay. But doing so violates the social contract we
all have with each other. It tears at the very fabric of society.
And the gains we have made, take the recent advances in
medicine for example, we have made as a group. If we were territorial
animals like bears who live mostly apart, we would not
have made these advances, advances we all benefit from.
And it is those benefits, the benefits we get by hanging together,
that are threatened by those who break the social contract.

Just thinking aloud, none of this is carved in stone,

&quot;Oh the mud splattered victims
Have to pay out all along the ancient highway
Torn between half truth and victimisation
Fighting back with counter attacks

&quot;It's when that rough god goes riding
When the rough god goes gliding
And then rough god goes riding
Riding on in

&quot;I was flabbergasted by the headlines
People in glasshouses throwing stones
Gaping wounds that will never heal
Now they're moaning like a dog in a manger

&quot;It's when that rough god goes riding
And then the rough god goes gliding
There'll be nobody hiding
When that rough god comes riding on in

&quot;And it's a matter of survival
When you're born with your back against the wall
Won't somebody hand me a bible
Won't you give me that number to call

&quot;When that rough god goed riding
And then that rough god goes gliding
They'll be nobody hiding
When that rough god goes riding on in
Riding on in

&quot;There'll be no more heroes
They'll be reduced to zero
When that rough god goes riding
Riding on in
Riding on in
Riding on in
Riding on in

Even as a young child, the subject of reincarnation
fascinated me &amp; I read everything I could get my hands on.
This in turn led to reading about the occult, witches,
ghosts &amp; even the study of people with ESP.

There are some documented cases of reincarnation where the
new body was born with the former soul's past memory intact.
This brings up a question about reincarnation that has
always puzzled me &amp; to which I have never discovered the
answer.

People who have had near-death experiences, or were
technically dead for several minutes, report walking toward
a light &amp; being met by family who either led them onward or
told them to return to their body.

If reincarnation exists, then how can we meet the souls of
our loved ones in heaven? The only possible explanation
I've come up with would be a time factor, but there are
reports of souls being transferred from the instant of their
body's death immediately into the body of a newborn child.

Other reports of people being regressed into past lives
through hypnosis may have gaps of 50+ years between lives,
so maybe it is possible that we will only meet part of our
loved ones. Still, it's a comforting thought.

I'm not an expert on medical matters, but I do know that the clinical
definition of death involves an irreversible cessation of brain
function. (I know we have at least one nurse in the group, but I don't
recall who it is.) Most of these stories revolve around people whose
heart has stopped beating. Using this definition as death, tens of
thousands of people with open heart surgery have died and then been
brought back to life. None of the stories I have seen ever involved
someone who was clinically dead, just someone whose heart had stopped
beating but whose brain was still functioning, and these people are
still very much alive.

Here's my cue.....IMO, negative energy begets negative energy. The old adage
, what goes around comes around is very true. Maybe Heaven is a haven of
positive energies, while Hell is a negative void where the demons dwell! We
have a choice..we can live with positive energy or negative. The after life
could very well mirror how we choose to live our life here on Earth....
Heavy discussion for an antiques group!

&gt; Heart and Mind
&gt; Meet me on the river of time&quot;
&gt; ======================

"/> Ronnie,
While I hesitate to call it a soul with all the religious implications, there is
something which is the essence of what each of us is, and when that leaves us,
death occurs. While I can only claim this as an opinion, it's based on personal
observation.
My most recent experience was with the death of my best friend/partner of 23
years, the father of my son who died here at home 4 years ago this coming New
Years day. He had been very sick for a few years, and the medical community had
done all that they could do when we brought him home in a hospice program.
Fortunately, he was not in any pain once they stopped experimenting on him, and
on his last day he was awake, reading his favorite book (Black Cat Raiders) and
barking orders in his usual curmudgeonly tone while I circled like a mother hen.
At one point, he laid his book on his chest and said &quot;I'm going to take a nap.&quot;
I guess I was hovering too much, because after a minute or two, he opened his
eyes and said &quot;Are you still here? Go away and leave me alone!&quot; I left the
room, but returned within 5 minutes, and I could tell as soon as I looked through
the door that he wasn't &quot;in there&quot; anymore. His heart was beating, and he
continued breathing, though ever more slowly for another 3 hours, but it was
clear that whatever it was that made him a separate person was no longer in that
body and it wasn't coming back. To bring cats back into the story, when I went
into the room his cat, who had been sitting at the foot of his bed all that last
day, hissing and spitting at anyone who went near him, including me, was lying on
her back in front of the door, all four legs in the air, eyes wide open staring
into space. My friends and I called her, poked her, and clapped our hands in
front of her wide open eyes, but could get no response from her. She stayed like
that for about an hour and a half, but regained composure and yowled till we let
her out, and this was still before his body had completely stopped. I like to
think that she was keeping him company on his journey to wherever. There's a lot
more to this story, including his conversations with long dead comrades while he
was drifting in the weeks before his death, but that would get too long.
My other experience 15 years ago involved my best friend who had moved to LA with
her husband and 6 kids. I got a call from her husband saying that she had an
undiagnosed aneurysm which had burst and she was in the hospital diagnosed as
brain dead. He was keeping her on life support, but didn't know what to do. I
flew down there to help with the kids, and while there in her house, I could feel
her very alive all around me, and I felt that there was no question but that she
would be all right. After 3 days there, I got to go to the hospital to see her,
but they had to show me who she was in the hospital bed. There was a body of a
blonde woman in the bed, but Mary wasn't &quot;in there&quot;. She was back home with her
kids.
Call it a ghost, a soul or an essence, I believe that it's there. Actually I
envision a layer of energy circumnavigating the globe like the jet stream or the
ocean currents, and when we're born the chunk of energy that's overhead at the
time enters us, and when we die it leaves and re enters the stream, but that's
another story.

Perhaps that is why they call it a near-death experience,
because the brain is still functioning when other vital
signs are missing. I'm pretty sure that the brain is the
last organ to cease functioning.

Can't the brain survive for something like 5 minutes without
oxygen or blood before causing permanent damage? Plenty of
time for a soul to leave &amp; return to the body.

Touches on spirits, souls, reincarnation.

It was at least a year after my cat Baby's death. David was working at
apartment complex at the time, just fixing stuff &amp; doing his job. He was
picking up trash by a fence that surrrounded the property, with his back to the
fence. He said he heard a niose &amp; turned around &amp; he saw Baby our cat come out
of some bushes &amp; walk the top of the fence. So, he called his name while seeing
this &amp; the cat vanished before his eyes.

Exsplain this one.

&gt;&gt; Ronnie
&gt;&gt; =====
&gt;&gt;&quot;Body and Soul
&gt;&gt; Heart and Mind
&gt;&gt; Meet me on the river of time&quot;
&gt;&gt; ======================

&gt; Ronnie,
&gt; While I hesitate to call it a soul with all the religious implications, there is
&gt; something which is the essence of what each of us is, and when that leaves us,
&gt; death occurs. While I can only claim this as an opinion, it's based on personal
&gt; observation.
&gt; My most recent experience was with the death of my best friend/partner of 23
&gt; years, the father of my son who died here at home 4 years ago this coming New
&gt; Years day. He had been very sick for a few years, and the medical community had
&gt; done all that they could do when we brought him home in a hospice program.
&gt; Fortunately, he was not in any pain once they stopped experimenting on him, and
&gt; on his last day he was awake, reading his favorite book (Black Cat Raiders) and
&gt; barking orders in his usual curmudgeonly tone while I circled like a mother hen.
&gt; At one point, he laid his book on his chest and said &quot;I'm going to take a nap.&quot;
&gt; I guess I was hovering too much, because after a minute or two, he opened his
&gt; eyes and said &quot;Are you still here? Go away and leave me alone!&quot; I left the
&gt; room, but returned within 5 minutes, and I could tell as soon as I looked through
&gt; the door that he wasn't &quot;in there&quot; anymore. His heart was beating, and he
&gt; continued breathing, though ever more slowly for another 3 hours, but it was
&gt; clear that whatever it was that made him a separate person was no longer in that
&gt; body and it wasn't coming back. To bring cats back into the story, when I went
&gt; into the room his cat, who had been sitting at the foot of his bed all that last
&gt; day, hissing and spitting at anyone who went near him, including me, was lying on
&gt; her back in front of the door, all four legs in the air, eyes wide open staring
&gt; into space. My friends and I called her, poked her, and clapped our hands in
&gt; front of her wide open eyes, but could get no response from her. She stayed like
&gt; that for about an hour and a half, but regained composure and yowled till we let
&gt; her out, and this was still before his body had completely stopped. I like to
&gt; think that she was keeping him company on his journey to wherever. There's a lot
&gt; more to this story, including his conversations with long dead comrades while he
&gt; was drifting in the weeks before his death, but that would get too long.
&gt; My other experience 15 years ago involved my best friend who had moved to LA with
&gt; her husband and 6 kids. I got a call from her husband saying that she had an
&gt; undiagnosed aneurysm which had burst and she was in the hospital diagnosed as
&gt; brain dead. He was keeping her on life support, but didn't know what to do. I
&gt; flew down there to help with the kids, and while there in her house, I could feel
&gt; her very alive all around me, and I felt that there was no question but that she
&gt; would be all right. After 3 days there, I got to go to the hospital to see her,
&gt; but they had to show me who she was in the hospital bed. There was a body of a
&gt; blonde woman in the bed, but Mary wasn't &quot;in there&quot;. She was back home with her
&gt; kids.
&gt; Call it a ghost, a soul or an essence, I believe that it's there. Actually I
&gt; envision a layer of energy circumnavigating the globe like the jet stream or the
&gt; ocean currents, and when we're born the chunk of energy that's overhead at the
&gt; time enters us, and when we die it leaves and re enters the stream, but that's
&gt; another story.

&gt;&gt;I'm not an expert on medical matters, but I do know that
&gt; the clinical
&gt;&gt;definition of death involves an irreversible cessation of
&gt; brain
&gt;&gt;function. (I know we have at least one nurse in the group,
&gt; but I don't
&gt;&gt;recall who it is.) Most of these stories revolve around
&gt; people whose
&gt;&gt;heart has stopped beating. Using this definition as death,
&gt; tens of
&gt;&gt;thousands of people with open heart surgery have died and
&gt; then been
&gt;&gt;brought back to life. None of the stories I have seen ever

"/> What most people refer to as &quot;near death experience&quot; is generally
referred to as &quot;anoxia&quot; by the medical profession. It is the
hallucinations caused by the lack of oxygen to the brain. While many
people who experience this feel they've been lifted through the air
towards a bright light, others find themselves swimming underwater
through a tunnel towards some goal (a possible explanation for some
cultures' idea of death as a ferryman). This happened to a friend of
mine after a motorcycle accident. Both seem to see scenes from their
lives going by as if on film. I think that all through history these
experiences have helped define our (or their) collective beliefs in the
passage at death into another place where we can live on.
The brain can survive for a while without oxygen (the blood supplies the
oxygen). There are documented cases of drownings in very cold water
where the victim has been resuscitated after 45 minutes without
significant brain damage. In the case of death from natural causes,
when the higher brain functions cease, there is lower brainstem activity
(the &quot;crocodile brain&quot;) which can keep a body breathing for as long as
48 hours waiting to see if the brain will come back before it stops and
the person is declared dead. There are degrees of &quot;brain dead&quot; . Flat
line, actual brain death means that all brain activity has stopped and
the body is being kept alive by the grace of machines and insurance
payments. Death will occur immediately on removal of life support.
When all higher brain function ceases &quot;clinical&quot; brain death depends on
how much lower brain activity continues. There are people who have been
declared brain dead who have gone on after the removal of all machines
(witness Karen Ann Quinlan). I have no idea where I'm going with this,
except maybe to say that some people who are breathing are dead, and
some who are not breathing are not dead, and I've been hanging around
hospitals way too long. 8-)

I never read or heard anything about the underwater

in a boat, set it adrift &amp; then aflame with burning arrows.
Besides the mythical Volga ferryman, what other cultures

"/> Rhiannon, I don't disagree with that. However, I have problems
believing that the &quot;soul&quot; has immortality. That a soul can continue to
exist outside a body and the body of a living being can exist without
a so called soul. I like to think of the soul in the terms of the
&quot;capacity for consciousness&quot;, or crudely put, intellect. When that
ceases to function then one is the dead and the essence that made life
has gone and neither body nor &quot;soul&quot; can then exists, one without the
other. And believing in a &quot;soul&quot; existing separately in any &quot;form&quot; in
an &quot;after life&quot; following brain-stem death occurs is not going to make
us immortal nor will it give us another chance in a new life in
another material world, or another time warp. When the lights go out,
they stay out. :)

"/> I am not in anyway being cynical or hurtful here, but early in the
18th century Stephen Hales, tied a ligature around the neck of a frog
and cut off its head. The heart continued to beat for a while, as it
usually does in the brain dead. Thirty hours later, the limbs of the
animal still withdrew when stimulated. In fact, the elicited movements
only ceased when the spinal cord itself had been destroyed. This
observation gave rise to a great controversy. It is now known that
such purely spinal reflex movements may occur below a dead brain. It
was shown during the 19th century that individuals executed on the
guillotine might retain the knee jerk reflex for up to 20 minutes
after decapitation.

I think liars and cheaters do pretty well. And I have
seen lots of great people get sick and die. I just
don't think there is much real evidence to support
your position on this, a sort of Instant Karma.

I just haven't seen enough evidence of this,
bad things happening to the wicked as opposed
to some sort of &quot;good luck&quot; (call it a lack of bad
things happening to them) that the righteous might have,
to think that this is really a valid point.
It looks to me like the rain falls on the just and the unjust
without a care which is which.

But that is just my opinion. I haven't done a scientific survey.

Thanks to all for your great input on the subject I posted below.
While many of us will not ever agree on Religious matters, I think it was
good to find out the many different ideas we all have when the spiritual
world comes up.
Thanks to the Ghost for making the statement that caused me to respond.
I also really liked Richard Ward's follow-up (By the way Richard, I didn't
mean to leave the impression of Christianity or nothing. I only meant to
contrast the notion of a belief in a higher power vs. no belief at all.) But,
there is much food for thought in your post, and also in Rhiannon's post.
In my case, I have to be a glutton and think hard in order to think at all.
Now, let's leave this off topic subject and talk about antiques. ME!
Thanks for letting a lurker hop in.

he created them from the year DOT for HIS own benefit, his own

&gt;don't wish to discuss from the &quot;faith&quot; point of view or the
teachings
&gt;of the holy scriptures, all of which have been the work of
man, not of
&gt;any divine force, it was man that created religion and their gods
and
&gt;he created them from the year DOT for HIS own benefit, his own
&gt;justifications and his own comfort ... and that's the truth. :)

&gt;Ronnie
&gt;=====
&gt;&gt;&gt;The trouble is, when you **know** the truth about anything, not

"/> just believe it to be true, it makes the discussion really
difficult...it's like convincing my daughter that 5 + 5 =10 not 32, or
my son that Tokyo is not in Australia when they produce all the
counter arguments and also believe that they are right.

Anyway, everyone has the free will to believe anything they like and
Christians are wrong if they try and force their belief on anybody.
Theywere only asked to discuss their belief and affirm their faith.
It's up to the listener to take it from there.

What really upsets me are people who don't get the opportunity to even
hear or think about these beliefs. Only one child in my wife's large
group of 5-7 year olds (white, Oxfordshire kids, not mixed faith/race)
knew what the word 'nativity' meant this week.It just makes me so
incredibly sad to think of these children in a totally God-less
environment.

"/> No I beg to differ Jon, you &quot;Know&quot; nothing of the sort, it's a faith
and I would suggest that YOU look at the &quot;bigger picture.&quot; As to how
we the humble human animal and our self-created beliefs fit into the
great expanse of the universe, an mere insignificant species. If we
ALL including this 3rd rock from the sun ceased to exist tomorrow it
wouldn't make one iota of a difference to the &quot;bigger picture&quot;, the
universe would continue without us. It *all* has existed for billions,
billions and billions (quantity X) of years without the need for human
life on this planet now that's a fact, not a blind belief. We are the
ones that overstate our importance in the &quot;bigger picture&quot; with a set
of intolerant religious beliefs. We are but a mere speck in time with
no real significance in the greater universe, the greater order of
things and by in large, the Christian faith, is at complete odds and
conflict with the rest of the cosmos.

"/>  I don't get that one .... Jon, 5+5=10, that is a proven fact, it's
not a blind faith, and Tokyo is in Japan, that is also a **fact** not
a matter of conjecture at all, there are NO counter arguments to these
proven facts. The argument is only difficult when the Christian faith,
expects everyone else, to accept without question, that the &quot;Holy
Bible&quot; (the New Testament) is the undisputed word of God handed down
solely to the man-animal by some great divine force, a single creator
of an **ever evolving** ever changing universe, and a creator that has
the power and the will to punish us all if we don't believe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Anyway, everyone has the free will to believe anything they like and
&gt;Christians are wrong if they try and force their belief on anybody.

"/> Huh? ... The Christian message is one of fear with the promise of
everlasting damnation to those that freely choose NOT to believe. It
is saying, unless YOU believe in MY god then &quot;HE&quot; is going to punish
your soul for eternity. That doesn't sound like a very tolerant or
free thinking attitude to me. The Christian faith is *threatening* the
non-believer and enforcing their beliefs through this fear of mayhem
and the promise that the world will end and we shall all be judged by
YOUR Christian God, but there's an alternative, the alternative that
you believe ME?? a bunch of terrorists if you ask me .. that is most
certainly wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Theywere only asked to discuss their belief and affirm their faith.
&gt;It's up to the listener to take it from there.

"/> I think that is a rather simplistic. I don't really want to get into
this, but, the Christian faith has a notorious reputation of
deplorable intolerance towards those that choose not to listen and in
many cases, throughout the Christian era, the non-believer and the
non-conformist has suffered because of their refusal to believe and
because they dare to think something different from the establishment.
And it continues today, people that choose NOT to believer are heavily
discriminated against by the Christian attitudes and the Christian
faith.

"/> Well if that is the case, then the state school system on mainland
Britain is totally different from here. And I for one wasn't aware
that the state system in England so differed from the rest of the UK
and Ireland. The state system here is that (most state schools)
schools have a Christian ethos, we do have intergradation in some
schools here, but even in these school a broad band of *religious*
morals are still adopted. One is of course free to choose for their
child to opt out on the Christian and religious teaching within the
state system, or to choose for one's child to attend an independent
school that has no Christian or religious ethos. It's a free choice
and whilst it may sadden you Jon, I am still of the opinion we don't
need a set of gods in order that we have a moral philosophy.

From Ulysses to Lovejoy, there is something in us that cheers for
the crafty. We had a dog once who walked up to the house on a
Sunday afternoon with a huge sirloin steak in his mouth and we
found this riotously funny.The family down the street who lost
their dinner probably didn't think the matter was amusing.

The thing is lying and stealing are relatively easy to do. Working
and standing behind your word are most often a royal pain in
the butt. So, when the wicked prosper, it is a temptation to us
all to just say Fuck It. And I don't suppose it takes a majority
of liars and theives in any society to ruin it. Just one more might
be enough to turn the tide.

The function of religion has been the telling of fairy stories.
For what is there in the end to keep the man with the wet
head from just saying Fuck It? What's to keep him from
just stealing someone else's umbrella? God knows he
might feel a wee bit justified in doing so.

So far all we have been able to come up with is, ironicly,
a lie to keep people honest. The collective good just does
not seem to motivate people the way the threat of eternal
torment does. We are just funny that way.

On the bright side, at least we don't live in Romania.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;At least to me, Christmas has another dimesion.

"/> Hey Jon, by coincidence I hope you caught that C4TV programme around
about 8pm Sat 19th ... &quot;The Real Jesus Christ&quot; ... here a short
preamble for the programme.

THE REAL JESUS CHRIST

&quot;An alternative and controversial biography of Jesus Christ, as it
would have been told by those who knew him better than anyone - his
closest followers and his family.Two decades after the death of Jesus
the movement he had inspired was in crisis, split into two bitterly
opposed factions. In a final attempt to heal the rift, a summit
meeting was called in Jerusalem. The leading antagonists were the two
key figures in 'the Jesus movement' Paul - later St Paul - and James
the brother of Christ.

&quot;James is one of the most mysterious figures in history. After the
death of his brother James had become head of the Jesus Movement which
became known as the Jerusalem Church. Together with the disciples
James spread the message of Jesus as a strictly Jewish Messiah. They
regarded Jesus as a religious and political leader whose mission was
to liberate the Jewish people from the oppression of the Romans who at
that time were occupying Palestine.

&quot;Paul's visionary encounter with the risen Christ on the road to
Damascus turned him from persecutor of the followers of Jesus to one
of their leaders. He became an emissary of the Jerusalem Church. But,
sophisticated, cosmopolitan, erudite and well travelled, Paul was a
very different character from the pious James and was working to his
own agenda, one that insisted that Jesus was the Son of God. He
embarked on a mission to reach all corners of the Roman Empire with
the message of the risen Christ. Soon his recruits were no longer
expected to observe Jewish custom. For a period James reluctantly
tolerated this in the conversion of non-Jews but when Paul began to
encourage Jews to break the laws of the Torah in pursuit of
'Christianity' James had to act. He called Paul back to Jerusalem for
the summit meeting. The result had far reaching effects on which
version of Christ's message prevailed and on the whole future of the
Christian Church.

&quot;For the last 2000 years St Paul has been credited with being the
mainspring of Christianity. His interpretation of the message of Jesus
moved it far away from Judaism and his dynamic determination led to
the eventual adoption of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire and
its continuing position as one of the most profound and primary
religions of the world. Paul, who never met or heard the teachings of
the earthly Christ, achieved sainthood.

&quot;However, the influence of James withered and virtually disappeared.
By the second century A.D. the Jerusalem Church was no more than a
small Jewish sect called the Ebbionites, viewed as heretics by the
mainstream Christian Church.

&quot;The Real Jesus Christ looks back at one of the major turning points
in history to create the lost biography of Jesus: an alternative
version of the life as it would have been told by his family and
disciples. They were the people who knew Jesus best but they lost the
battle for immortality.

&quot;The Real Jesus Christ features interviews with leading academics and
theologians of modern biblical thought. Contributers include
Professor ROBERT EISENMAN of California State University, Professor
HYAM MACCOBY of Leeds University, Professor MICHAEL GOULDER of the
University of Birmingham, Professor JOHN DOMINIC CROSSAN of De Paul
University in Chicago and Dr MARK GOODACRE of the University of
Birmingham.&quot;

The practice of placing coins on the eyes of the deceased goes back to
Roman times... can't remember the ferryman's name at the moment, but the
two coins were payment to him to transport you across the River Styx.
(wasn't there a song about the Ferryman about 10 years ago?).

Thanks Ronnie... yes it was Charon I was thinking of. But upon further
reflection (and your note of the coin in the mouth), I think it was in
Midieval times that they placed the coins over the eyes instead.... dern
fuzzy memory! I'm finally getting to see a new doctor today that may
actually be able to help... I hope... wish me luck!
