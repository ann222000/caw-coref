I just finished watching the miniseries ("The Lost Room" on SciFi)

Wow.

If you haven't sen it, see it as soon as you can.

For those who haven't, the premise is-

There's a room full of ordinary Objects from a motel room in 1961, The
Objects all (?) have some extraordinary ability, some trivial, some
significant, some useful, some not.  For instance the Pencil makes a
penny appear when you tap it, the Bus Ticket transports anyone it
touches to a point outside of Gallup New Mexico.  The Cufflink lowers
blood pressure, the Wristwatch hard boils an egg if you put one the
loop of the band, etc.  There are about 100 such Objects.  Some people
know about them and are seeking them out for various reasons.  Outside
of the Room the Objects are indestructible, inside they are normal and
lose their powers.  The powers objects have do not seem related to
their initial function, for instance neither the Watch nor the Clock
stops time, but the Comb does (for 10 seconds).

Not everyone who knows about the Objects is seeking them.  They all
seem to be cursed with bad luck, at least owning them often makes
people's lives worse than they were before, even aside from the people
with guns chasing them   Some people deal in information about the
Objects but refuse to deal with the Objects themselves.  Objects
appear normal, but can be verified by their invulnerability.

The star gets his hands on the Key (when used any ordinary door leads
to the Room, and exiting the Room can take you to any door in the
world) without knowing about it, and the people seeking Objects
(especially the Key) kidnap his daughter.  In the commotion she ends
up in the Room and the door closes.  When the door closes anything
that doesn't belong in the Room disappears, and anything that does
belong is put in its rightful place (if it's present).  This is called
a reset.  At one point the star needs an Object out of a safe, so he
puts the safe in the room and resets it- the safe disappears and the
object is put in its rightful place.

The rest of the series is his search for a way to get his daughter
back, and learning about the Room and the Objects and the people and
groups seeking them.  (the ending is kind of weak, but he may have
been lied to so it doesn't have to be taken at face value- I don't)

I think it's a terrific idea for a 'real' world, modern day campaign.
All you need is the real world, and a list of Objects and abilities,
*which I would like suggestions for*.

One change from the series (maybe) I will make is that if you put the
key in the room and close the door, the room doesn't reset, and the
door stays linked to the last door used to enter.  It's not that easy
to get rid of the Room.

What happened (my version)- there was a cosmic accident.  In a
parallel universe there's a motel with a room 10 that got switched to
our universe where the motel only has 9 rooms.  In the process
everything in the room got charged with some reality warping power.
The only way to undo this is to return everything to the Room and
close the door.  The Room will then cease to exist (in our universe).

Some rules-

The Objects are powered and indestructible outside the Room, and
unpowered (utterly ordinary) in the Room.

An object damaged in the Room will be returned to its initial state on
a reset.

An object destroyed in the Room will be restored on a reset.

Damaged Objects cannot be taken from the Room- they will disappear at
the threshhold.  More specifically- a piece of an Object will
disappear, a damaged Object still in one piece will be restored at the
threshhild (or on a reset).  If you tear the Bus Ticket in half and
leave the room the part you have will disappear.  If you tear it but
leave it in one piece it will be fixed when you leave (this is to
prevent some hijinks of people 'trapping' objects in the Room until a
reset)

I think characters should be allowed to pay points to own an Object
with the usual provisos- if they pay points for it it's theirs, if
they find it it's the GMs.  What they pay with should be some mental
disadvantage , social disadvantage or bad luck- the star (a police
detective) lost his daughter and became a wanted fugitive shortly
after getting the Key, some of the Collectors were more than half way
around the bend.  Renouncing ownership of Objects (for real) may
eliminate the disadvantage(s).  Losing an Object(s) does not.  Some
people who had Objects but don't anymore are still warped.  EVERYONE
pays a price.  That doesn't mean you have to be a cripple to own
multiple powerful objects.  Characters should only be required to pay
for the first one and the rest can remain 'GM property'.

The Occupant...  The Objects belonged to him (or the motel, but mostly
him).  He's an ordinary person who happens to be an Object now.  He
doesn't age and can't be injured in any way outside the room (same
rules for other Objects).  He MAY be able to control an Object in his
possession in ways that others can't.  He MAY have knowlege about the
Objects that others don't (aside and in addition to anything he's
learned in the interim).  If he's in the Room in a reset he might even
retain his memories afterward rather than be reset to what he knew in
1961.  He definitely hates and fears the Objects and will not
knowingly have anything to do with them, and he can sense their
presence.  Yes, he's definitely need to close the Room permanently.
He had a normal life with a family before the event, but no analogue
of him existed in our universe.  His universe and ours were otherwise
indistinguishable before the event.

Objects in general can sense the other Objects, and owners will find
themselves crossing paths with other owners with surprising frequency
given the actual probability of doing so.

Unlike the series, Objects don't synergize in unexpected ways- no
combining 6 random Objects and causing a rift in reality.  The
Wristwatch and the Pocket Knife together won't grant you telepathy.
This is NOT to say that not closing the Room permamently by a certain
time won't destroy reality, if you need to add time pressure to the
campaign.

Why no synergistic effects? That was one of my favourite parts of the
show.
