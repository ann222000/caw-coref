This is a great poem for this time of the year.  The people away from home
need to be remembered as they are where they are so we can have peace.  It
is harder for them than us as they are away from their families and friends.
Barbi/Mom
Different Christmas Poem

The embers glowed softly, and in their dim light,
I gazed round the room and I cherished the sight.
My wife was asleep, her head on my chest
My daughter beside me, angelic in rest.

Outside the snow fell, a blanket of white,
Transforming the yard to a winter delight.
The sparkling lights in the tree I believe,
Completed the magic that was Christmas Eve.

My eyelids were heavy, my breathing was deep,
Secure and surrounded by love I would sleep.
In perfect contentment, or so it would seem,
So I slumbered, perhaps I started to dream.

The sound wasn't loud, and it wasn't too near,
But I opened my eyes when it tickled my ear.
Perhaps just a cough, I didn't quite know, Then the
Sure sound of footsteps outside in the snow.

My soul gave a tremble, I struggled to hear,
And I crept to the door just to see who was near.
Standing out in the cold and the dark of the night,
A lone figure stood, his face weary and tight.

A soldier, I puzzled, some twenty years old,
Perhaps a Marine, huddled here in the cold.
Alone in the dark, he looked up and smiled,
Standing watch over me, and my wife and my child.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; I asked without fear,
&quot;Come in this moment, it's freezing out here!
Put down your pack, brush the snow from your sleeve,
You should be at home on a cold Christmas Eve!&quot;

For barely a moment I saw his eyes shift,
Away from the cold and the snow blown in drifts..
To the window that danced with a warm fire's light
Then he sighed and he said &quot;Its really all right,
I'm out here by choice. I'm here every night.&quot;

&quot;It's my duty to stand at the front of the line,
That separates you from the darkest of times.
No one had to ask or beg or implore me,
I'm proud to stand here like my fathers before me.

My Gramps died at ' Pearl on a day in December,&quot;
Then he sighed, &quot;That's a Christmas 'Gram always remembers.&quot;
My dad stood his watch in the jungles of 'Nam ',
And now it is my turn and so, here I am.

I've not seen my own son in more than a while,
But my wife sends me pictures, he's sure got her smile.

Then he bent and he carefully pulled from his bag,
The red, white, and blue... An American flag.
I can live through the cold and the being alone,
Away from my family, my house and my home.

I can stand at my post through the rain and the sleet,
I can sleep in a foxhole with little to eat.
I can carry the weight of killing another,
Or lay down my life with my sister and brother..
Who stand at the front against any and all,
To ensure for all time that this flag will not fall.&quot;
&quot;So go back inside,&quot; he said, &quot;harbor no fright,
Your family is waiting and I'll be all right.&quot;

&quot;But isn't there something I can do, at the least,
&quot;Give you money,&quot; I asked, &quot;or prepare you a feast?
It seems all too little for all that you've done,
For being away from your wife and your son.&quot;

Then his eye welled a tear that held no regret,
&quot;Just tell us you love us, and never forget
To fight for our rights back at home while we're gone,
To stand your own watch, no matter how long.

For when we come home, either standing or dead,
To know you remember we fought and we bled.
Is payment enough, and with that we will trust,
That we mattered to you as you mattered to us.&quot;

PLEASE, would you do me the kind favor of sending this to as many people as
you can? Christmas will be coming soon and some credit is due to our U.S.
Service men and women for our being able to celebrate these festivities.
Let's try in this small way
To pay a tiny bit of what we owe. Make people stop and think of our heroes,
living and dead, who sacrificed themselves for us.

I am on my way to the Doctor this morning and I am in a hurry as I have to leave in an hour  but I want to take time to wish you all a very thankful thanksgiving because that is what it is all about.  It really isn't about a better meal than we have the rest of the year or about sports and parades, neither a weekend for shopping as our Nation seems to think about today.  It is strange that we still have thanksgiving and yet so many people or trying to remove God from our presence.  Thanksgiving is a time to praise the Lord and thank him for all our blessings and as he told me I couldn't count them if I really tried that I should meditate on them and to have a thankful heart.  It is time that we ask God to teach us how to love him, and how to be thankful.  Our God is good and in him is always love and mercy and we do nothing to earn it.  He loves not for who we are but because of who he is.

I love you all,

Gerrie

Good Morning
Cherished Friends:

Praise the Lord with me ok!
How was your
Thanksgiving with Jesus?
Please come share what
you ate, and if you went visiting
or had alot of company ok.

My precious son
Thomas did
not make it home to us, he
came down with a terrible
flu bug, fever and is very ill,
please pray for him
to be totally healed.
He works very hard, he
works 3 different jobs,
one is as a volunteer for the
fire dept., and he has a full
time job working for a very
large resort. His 3rd job is
his car detailing business
that he started a yr. ago, he
does boats too. and in his
spare time he tries to go fishing
Hubby and i had an awesome
dinner, and he got to rest with
me awhile, we watched some
good Christian t.v. and a
couple Hallmark Family movies.

I am so Blessed to rest with you

So hard to wake up this
morning, but here
i am, thank u Jesus
hope you all had a good nights
rest and that you woke up
with the presence of the
Lord all over you and your
home, if not just praise
Him and thank Him for
waking you, and keep
your mind on Jesus ok,
He will draw near to you
if you draw near to Him
and want Him more
than the worlds stuff...
Todays lets all share what
we are thankful for ok!
for me, i am thankful that
Jesus is alive and He loves me,
knows my heart,and Sees me
and knows me personally,
and i never have to worry
because His angels encamp
all around us, and we are
protected in the Secret place,
Psalm 91Did you know
that we are all family?
Wherever Christians gather
together in fellowship they
become family. That is true
even if the gathering place
is on the internet; and the
individuals who gather
here are scattered across
the face of the whole world.
Sometimes it is so easy to
take these relationships
for granted.  Sometimes we
don't realize just how much
of a family we are until
one of us leaves the group,
or goes home to be with
our Father God.

Lets Pray
Together

Dearest Father God,
we are starting a brand new
day that you have given us
to do with as we please.
Father we want to do with this
day as you want us to do.
We want to walk in the
light of Jesus Christ.
We want to follow in Jesus' footsteps
and grow closer to you Father God.
Show us  the way Father with
guide us with your Holy Spirit
presence!  Show us
what it is you want us
to do today Father God.
Give us your Godly wisdom
and the knowledge
so we will show others your
love and the light of Jesus.
Let us lead someone to the salvation
of Jesus;  Father God for
without Jesus we are nothing.
Heal our bodies Father God
give us the strength to be
able to do what it is that you
want us to do today.
Heal our Spirit Father God so that
others will see you in us each day.
Father there are so many that
are sick and hurting in this world.
There are so many living on the
streets with no food or clothing.
There are so many hurting souls
out there Father God
that need you.
Father our country is hurting
and decaying from sin.
Father we ask that you send
us your angels to protect
us as we go about your business
and the business of Jesus Christ.
Father send your Holy Spirit to
give us your Godly wisdom and
knowledge to know how to witness
to each soul you send
in our pathway today.
Father I ask that you heal
all our spirits today and give
each one of us the strength
&amp; comfort to not be afraid to stand
up for you and Jesus today.
Make us bold Father God and
take away all the worldly fear
that satan is trying to
place on us each day.
Jesus please walk with us today
on the path that God has
placed us on Thank you
Father God for your
love and for your Holy Spirit
and for Jesus Christ.
Thank you Father for being with
us when we feel that we are all alone.
Oh Father God we love you so very much.
Thank you for all your love Father God.
Thank you Jesus for loving
us so much that you died for
us so that we can live for You forever.
In  Jesus name we pray Amen
Holy and almighty God, please
break down the walls that separate your
people and keep us apart.
Forgive us for our arrogance
and selfishness
and bring us to unity as we
seek to serve the world
as your Son did. As
we focus more on Jesus,
please conform us more
to your will. In Jesus'
name I pray. Amen.

If you have a prayer request
please share that with us each day.

From: Jacob

We are dependent on the Lord even for the very breath of life. We see
many people on our right and left pass away from this life suddenly,
reminding us that life on earth is very uncertain. The Psalmist said
that all flesh is like the grass that is here one day and disappears
soon (Ps.103:15,16). Accidents and sicknesses can suddenly change our
plans. Disappointments and frustrations mark many of our days. There
are people who betray our trust and others who scheme against us in
secret. Who can be sure what a day can bring?

One thing we can do is to brood over such things and become gloomy,
depressed, hopeless, cynical, callous, etc. That is certainly not
going to make things better, but will drive us further into despair.
The other thing we can do is to draw closer to the Lord and find
shelter under His wings (Ps.61:4). He does not promise us a bed of
roses or to take away all the hardships of life. But on the other hand
He does promise that even when we go through the water or the fire He
will be with us (Is.43:2). He will see to it that none of these things
overwhelm us. Even when our enemies scheme against us, God will will
cause us to receive a blessing - a feast - from His hands (Ps.23:5;Ro.
8:28). He comforts us with His protective presence with us so that we
can feel secure (Ps.23:4).

The knowledge of God that we can get through the hardships of life -
as we hold tightly to Him - is of such precious value that God thinks
it is better to let us go through suffering and gain it, than to let
us have an easy life and miss it. The Bible refers to it as going
through suffering to glory (Ro.8:18). But we are all in danger of
missing the glory, because when suffering comes we respond by
complaining and turning away from God instead of drawing closer to
Him.

The Lord tells us to draw near to Him so that He can draw near to us
(Jas.4:8). He tells us to draw near to Him, but He won't draw near to
us before we draw near to Him. This is because He doesn't wish to
intrude upon our free choice. But when we do draw near to Him, even if
it is in panic, fear, doubt, distress, sorrow, pain, etc., He will
come close to us and comfort us.

One way that can help us to remember to draw near to Him is to develop
the habit of telling ourselves how dependent we are on God. When we
make our plans, when we tell others what we are going to do, when we
set out to do something - we can say or at least think of the phrase,
&quot;God willing&quot; (Jas.4:15). This will remind us of our dependence on God
and help us to draw close to Him.

Some people think that this is a lack of faith, and that we ought to
affirm things through our words in order to express our faith. It is
silly to say &quot;God willing&quot; if we already know His will. But many times
we don't. What greater expression of faith is there than to
acknowldege our utter dependence on Him and to submit to His
soevereign will?

From: Jacob

We are dependent on the Lord even for the very breath of life. We see
many people on our right and left pass away from this life suddenly,
reminding us that life on earth is very uncertain. The Psalmist said
that all flesh is like the grass that is here one day and disappears
soon (Ps.103:15,16). Accidents and sicknesses can suddenly change our
plans. Disappointments and frustrations mark many of our days. There
are people who betray our trust and others who scheme against us in
secret. Who can be sure what a day can bring?

One thing we can do is to brood over such things and become gloomy,
depressed, hopeless, cynical, callous, etc. That is certainly not
going to make things better, but will drive us further into despair.
The other thing we can do is to draw closer to the Lord and find
shelter under His wings (Ps.61:4). He does not promise us a bed of
roses or to take away all the hardships of life. But on the other hand
He does promise that even when we go through the water or the fire He
will be with us (Is.43:2). He will see to it that none of these things
overwhelm us. Even when our enemies scheme against us, God will will
cause us to receive a blessing - a feast - from His hands (Ps.23:5;Ro.
8:28). He comforts us with His protective presence with us so that we
can feel secure (Ps.23:4).

The knowledge of God that we can get through the hardships of life -
as we hold tightly to Him - is of such precious value that God thinks
it is better to let us go through suffering and gain it, than to let
us have an easy life and miss it. The Bible refers to it as going
through suffering to glory (Ro.8:18). But we are all in danger of
missing the glory, because when suffering comes we respond by
complaining and turning away from God instead of drawing closer to
Him.

The Lord tells us to draw near to Him so that He can draw near to us
(Jas.4:8). He tells us to draw near to Him, but He won't draw near to
us before we draw near to Him. This is because He doesn't wish to
intrude upon our free choice. But when we do draw near to Him, even if
it is in panic, fear, doubt, distress, sorrow, pain, etc., He will
come close to us and comfort us.

One way that can help us to remember to draw near to Him is to develop
the habit of telling ourselves how dependent we are on God. When we
make our plans, when we tell others what we are going to do, when we
set out to do something - we can say or at least think of the phrase,
&quot;God willing&quot; (Jas.4:15). This will remind us of our dependence on God
and help us to draw close to Him.
