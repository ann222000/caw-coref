Iran's Hot Summer Offensive - By Erick  Stakelbeck - CBN News Terror Analyst
CBNNews.com - Leaders from Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, and Hamas gathered in
Damascus last month to discuss their vision for the Middle East.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad summed up the meeting: &quot;We hope that
the hot weather of this summer would coincide with similar victories for the
region's peoples and with consequent defeat for the region's enemies.&quot;
Those enemies include the United States and Israel. Iran is leading a summer
offensive against these rivals, but is staying behind the scenes.
&quot;They use proxy fighters,&quot; Peter Brookes, from Heritage Foundation, said.
&quot;They use Hezbollah in Lebanon. They use Hamas in the Palestinian territories.
They're using Shia militias in Iraq. They're using the Taliban in Afghanistan.
And they often will allow others to do their dirty work.&quot;
Ex-Pentagon and CIA Official Peter Brookes says America and Israel stand in
the way of Iran's plan to dominate the Middle East.
Brookes said the plan involves &quot;... an Iranian arc of influence across the
entire Middle East, across the Sunni Arab world, going from the Persian Gulf to
the Mediterranean Sea. And that's what they're hoping for.&quot;
This Iranian arc begins in Iraq. U.S. officials say Iran backs both Sunni
insurgents and Shiite militias. Iranian agents have been captured in Iraq
recently and some are members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard.
&quot;There's lots of money going from Iran into Iraq,&quot; Brookes said. &quot;They're
bank-rolling some politicians, they're bank-rolling some real troublemakers like
Muqtada al-Sadr.&quot;
Military officials say Iran is also responsible for the deadly roadside bombs
that killed 23 U.S. soldiers in July.
&quot;There will be consequences for people transporting, delivering EFP's --
highly sophisticated IED's that kill Americans in Iraq,&quot; President Bush warned.

Weaponry being smuggled into Iraq from Iran and placed in the  hands of
extremists over which the government has no control is a destabilizing  factor. And
the goal is to kill innocent lives.
Middle East Expert Walid Phares believes Iran's goal is to force a hasty U.S.
withdrawal from Iraq.
&quot;As soon as the last U.S. soldier or Allied soldier would be leaving Iraq,
you don't need a political scientist to figure out that the Iranians will
overrun -- through their miltias and friends and allies -- two thirds of Iraq,
from Baghdad all the way down to Basra,&quot; Phares explained.
Phares, a native of Lebanon, says his home country is the next to fall under
the Iranian umbrella, along with Syria.
Last year's war with Israel weakened the Lebanon-based terrorist militia,
Hezbollah. But Israeli intelligence says the group is back near full strength
thanks to Iran.
&quot;It is not a proxy or an ally or some partner -- it is part of the Iranian
regime,&quot; Phares said. &quot;It receives hundreds of millions of dollars directly
from  the Iranian regime. It moves in Lebanon in coordination -- in full,
absolute  coordination -- with the Islamic Republic of Iran.&quot;
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah boasts the group's missiles can reach any
city in Israel. Analysts believe Nasrallah is gearing up for a rematch, but he
may first turn his sights closer to home.
&quot;Hezbollah's war room today is preparing for the crumbling of the Lebanese
government between now and the end of this year,&quot; Phares said. &quot;They are taking
advantage of presidential elections coming soon -- the end of September or
early  October.&quot;
Syria also funnels arms and money to Hezbollah. The Syrians are blamed for a
wave of assassinations inside Lebanon. U.N. peacekeeping troops have been
unable  to stop this Syrian and Iranian meddling.
&quot;The international community must immediately take charge of the
Lebanon/Syria borders. Because these borders are allowing Hezbollah to arm,  rearm, and
rearm again,&quot; Phares said.
The final sphere in Iran's web of influence is the Gaza Strip. The terrorist
group Hamas seized full control there in June. Again, Iran is the main source
of  weapons and money.
This sets the stage for another perfect storm like last summer, in which
Israel was attacked from both sides.
&quot;What they're doing basically is heating up Gaza -- arming the Hamas forces,
arming the Hezbollah forces,&quot; Phares said. &quot;They want to squeeze Israel
between  two enclaves in Gaza and southern Lebanon.&quot;
Iran's wild card may be al-Qaeda. Several high-ranking al-Qaeda operatives
have been in Iranian custody since fleeing Afghanistan in late 2001. U.S.
intelligence officials believe Iran may be providing a safe haven for the group,
so it can coordinate attacks.
&quot;As long as it supports Iran's objectives, I think they're willing to have a
marriage of convenience, maybe a marriage of necessity,&quot; Brookes said.
&quot;Because  both of them see the United States as the biggest obstacle to what they
want to  achieve.&quot;
A senior military intelligence source tells CBN News the Iranian regime is
debating whether to unleash chaos in Iraq before summer's end. Some Iranian
factions feel it may be better to keep bleeding America slowly until it
withdraws.
All of this, of course, continues to shift focus from Iran's nuclear weapons
program, which continues full speed ahead.
