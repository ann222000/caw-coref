Egyptian Researcher Muhammad Al-Buheiri: Jews Still Use Christian
Blood to Bake Passover Matzos

Following are excerpts from an interview with Egyptian researcher
Muhammad Al-Buheiri, which aired on Nile Culture TV on February 25,
2007.

Interviewer: What is this story of the blood matza, which some authors
-even Arab ones - say is anti-Semitic lies and nonsense, while others
say it is true?

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: Unfortunately, some Arabs want to be holier than
the
Pope...

Interviewer: A journalist like Salah 'Issa, for example, wrote in
Nahdhat Masr that we don't need to decide whether the blood matza
story was true or not, but that we should examine how we deal
strategically with the Jews and the Israelis in the 21st century.

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: That's true, but it doesn't mean that we
shouldn't deal with such issues. Let's not forget that the West in its
entirety globally celebrated Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses. So
why shouldn't we do the same? I called for a Nobel Prize to be awarded
to the Israeli Jewish historian, the son of the chief rabbi of Rome...

Interviewer: He's the son of the chief rabbi of Italy...

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: He's the son of the chief rabbi of Rome, who is
still alive at 90 years of age.

Interviewer: He wrote Bloody Passover, the book we are discussing.

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: This man proved scientifically and objectively...
He's an academic, who heads the department of Jewish history at the
Israeli Bar-Ilan University. We are not talking about an amateur, a
fraud, or someone looking to get famous. We are talking about an
academic, who follows
scientific and objective principles. He reached the conclusion that
there was indeed a group of extremist Jews, who used to slaughter
Christian children, and to collect their blood in order to make the
Passover matza. It had to be a child who had not reached puberty. They
would abduct him, and put him into a barrel designed for this purpose,
which had holes in the sides at the place of the arteries. They would
insert iron skewers through the barrel, and make the boy's blood flow
that way. Then they would collect the blood, and use it for Passover.
Some sources in Jewish halacha say that preparing a single matza on
Passover this way is sufficient for all the Jews. Others believe that
such matzos should be prepared in each country separately.

Interviewer: They sacrifice Christian children... When was it? In what
century?

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: It has been substantiated since the Middle Ages.

Interviewer: Since then?

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: Yes.

Interviewer: My question is: Until when did it happen?

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: That is the question we must ask. Have the Jews,
with all their extremists, especially in Israel, given up... Have they
given up these customs and religious rituals, which are important to
them? There were very many cases. There were similar cases in Syria.
There were similar cases in 1700 and 1800. Such children were
abducted.

Interviewer: I have another question. Who are the people who prepare
these matzos? Are they Jewish extremists or moderates? As a researcher
specializing in inter-faith dialogue, do you believe this still occurs
in Israel? I'm rephrasing the question.

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: I believe it does, because these are religious
rituals.

[...]

Interviewer: In some Israeli newspapers and media, we have seen that
they take an Israeli hen or rooster, and shed its blood, and they say
that this is a form of Israeli sacrifice that brings blessing. We have
witnessed this on several occasions. The question is why this
important book, Bloody
Passover, provoked  the Jews throughout the world, who said that this
renowned Israeli historian is anti-Semitic.

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: First of all, we should be aware that the Jews
always implement a rule they consider basic: A loud voice is capable
of erasing the truth.

Interviewer: A loud voice?

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: Yes.

Interviewer: They are quite loud, aren't they?

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: Precisely. If they attack somebody, they announce
in the media and propaganda tools, which they control so skillfully,
throughout the world... They turn the facts upside down. They turn the
attacker into the attacked.

Interviewer: The media are controlled by the Jews.

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: The Jews have made great efforts to conceal the
issue of the Passover blood. They even called it &quot;blood libel.&quot; In
Jewish culture, this is called &quot;blood libel&quot; - the lie about the use
of Christian blood to prepare matzos.

Interviewer: Some people say that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion
- and we are talking about the Israeli blood matza - is a complete
fabrication about the history of the Jews and Judaism. How do you
respond to this as a researcher?

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: By Allah, even if I did not have historical
proof, like the proof obtained by the Israeli historian Ariel Toaff,
the current reality proves that it is true, or, at the very least,
raises the possibility that it is true. We await a generation of new
Israeli historians, who are characterized by scientific objectivity,
and, incidentally, deserve our respect. We're waiting for them to look
into this issue, and it will surely turn out to be true.

[...]

Interviewer: Are the Jews of the Banu Nazir and Banu Qurayza tribes,
from the time of the Prophet Muhammad - are they the same Jews who
live in Israel today? Some commentators, historians, and professors
say that this is not true - that the Jews from the time of the Prophet
Muhammad and the Jews of Al-Madina are not the same Jews who live in
Israel today. What do you think about this?

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: Of course, this is true. No Israeli researcher
can claim that his lineage goes back to the Jews of Banu Nazir or Banu
Qaynuqa, or to the Jews of the Arabian Peninsula. They are all from
Romanian, Polish, Russian, or English families. Not a single one...
Only very few... There are
Jewish families who have lived since bygone times in Palestine, and,
by the way, these families are very...

Interviewer: Your response is very important, because it will make us
consider the Jews in Israel in a different light - that they are not
the accursed Jews, that they are not the Jews mentioned in the Koran.
What do you think?

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: No, the fact that they are the accursed Jews is
not restricted to any geographical region. This is because of their
religion. If you believe in this religion, you believe some
instructions that contradict the true religions and the instructions
of monotheistic religion, and
therefore, you deserve this  curse. So this issue is not connected to
any specific geographical region, but to an ideological theory.

Interviewer: What you are explaining now is that the Jews of Israel
are not
the Jews of Al-Madina.

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: That's right.

Interviewer: But this does not mean they are not the Jews cursed in
the Koran.

Muhammad Al-Buheiri: No, because they were cursed on account of their
behavior. If you adopt this religious theory and these rituals, you
deserve to be cursed.
