No video or audio in normal or test modes.  Just a slight hum. Voltage
is good.  LED on PCB is lit.  LED's on buttons are on but not
flashing.  I used the logic probe at the 16 Mhz test point and am
getting a pulse.  Not sure where to go next.

Thank you to all who helped get the Defender going.  These both belong
to a friend of mine and I'm just trying to help him out.  I'm a total
amateur but can follow directions pretty well.  Any ideas out there?
I've researched the Asteroids logs and the Asteroids Repair
Encyclopedia.  But still stuck.

First, make sure the +5 volt line is actually nice and clean, with no AC
ripple on it.

Reseat all of the socketed chips.  These go bad frequently.

Check pin 40 of the 6502 processor and see if it's pulsing.  If it is, then
the watchdog circuit is contantly resetting the board.

Well what does it mean if pin 40 is constantly low?  I understand it
should be high and pulsing indicates a watchdog....but what does low
mean?  I'll go check for AC on the +5 right now....

I've already reseated all socketed chips.

That means the processor's /RESET signal is constantly being held low,
therefore the processor is never getting the command to start.

Sounds like a problem with the main clock generator on the motherboard.
Check the aforementioned _Asteroids_ repair FAQ for more data.

Hold the probe on pin 40 and tap on the on-board reset button if it's
still present. It's a flat grey round button that likes to form
corrosive deposits inside and short it closed. Most people remove them
altogether for this very reason. If it's there and doing the above
manages to make pin 40 glitch or flicker, remove the button and
reboot. Else set your probe to it's memory setting and hold it on pin
40 with the power off, then turn it on while probing. If the signal
starts low and stays low with no indication of a pulse, trace the
reset line back.

Hope that helps

Thank you all again.  I got the game working last night.  I ended up
finding another board that was missing some components and
transferring the missing ones from the other board.  Other than a bad
trace next to a ram everything else worked fine on it.  So I'm not
going to even troubleshoot the other board any more.  I really do
appreciate all of your insightful tips though!
