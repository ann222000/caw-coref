Is It Moral to Drive a Gas-Guzzling Vehicle?

By Your Voices
Sunday, February 2, 2003; Page C11

I agree with religious leaders who say it is morally
irresponsible to drive an SUV. There are at least three moral
issues here: failure to steward the Earth's resources, greed in
taking a far larger share of these resources than is equitable,
and failure to consider or care about the potential physical
harm to others from such a large, heavy, and higher vehicle.

In several places in the Bible, we are told to be stewards of
the Earth. Despoiling it with oil rigs and squandering its
resources is not stewardship. We are all guilty, but SUV
drivers more so because of the SUV's lousy gas mileage.

I believe people who drive larger, gas guzzlers should be
made to pay higher prices for gasoline.

Each gas station should have three lines - one for compact
cars, one for medium sized cars and one for SUV's.

Compact: $1.00 per gallon
Medium: $1.75 per gallon
SUV's: $2.50 per gallon

And enjoy your expensive ride. Quit robbing our natural resources.

"/> Driver A buys a 15 MPG SUV and drives 50 miles a week because he
bought a house downtown near where he works.

Driver B buys a 30 MPG compact car and drives 500 miles a week because
he wants to live way out in the country.

Drivers C and D live close to each other and work at the same company,
but choose to drive their own compact cars 20 miles a day instead of
carpooling.

"/> Ugh! I can't believe people actually think like this. It's the old blame the
problem on someone else syndrome. Let the guy who does just a little more
than me take the blame. It's the same thing as using the excuse &quot;the guy in
front of me was going faster than I was&quot; when pulled over for going 10 over
the limit. You are both just as guilty. Now these liberal eco-nut twits need
to stop bitching, or at least bitch a little more logically.

Then we get into this &quot;potential physical harm&quot; bullshit. Are these sissy
assed tree huggers gonna live tehir whole lives afraid of anything that car
hurt them? Because I assure you a small vehicle can easily do more damage
than a large one. Either way, why not have some neo-Nazi dictatorship in
which every aspect of our lives are micro-managed by the gov't for what
officials think is best for us? That's what these tree huggers are saying.

"/> Boo freakin' hoo! Those of us who drive inefficient cars already pay more at
the pump. If your car has a 13 gallon tank and goes 300 miles on it then you
will pay less than me who can go the same distance on a 24 gallon tank. Us
drivers of large vehicles already pay more than you liberal tightwad twits
driving your precious foreign cars. Also, stop being such a typical liberal
extremist and only attacking SUVs. My 67 and 68 Galaxies get 11-13 MPG. At
least bitch consistently!

Just venting at how incredibly moronic these eco-nuts are. They need to get
a little more consistent and listen to both sides. My girlfriends cousins
are liberal eco-nuts who demand everything instantly. They can't seem to
comprehend the fact that there needs to be compromise in the present to get
there smoothly, or even at all. I find most liberal eco-nuts I talk to are
like that, so extremist that they are uneducated about the other side of the
story, and are unwilling to listen. Nor do they show any consistency in
their arguments. Then they wonder why they find it so hard to get any
credibility. LOL

"/> He's making up a hypothetical situation. Similar situations undoubtedly
exist in tons of places, just like the opposite situation surely exists in
many places as well. The point is that the eco-nuts are going after one
small group of people because they are more noticeable on the road due to
their larger vehicles. When you look at an SUV you are likely to think &quot;look
at that gas guzzler&quot; or &quot;wow, another crazy driver&quot; due to stereotypes. When
you look at a classic car you are more likely to think &quot;that's a nice car&quot;
or &quot;I haven't seen one of those in years&quot;.

I drive about 150-175 miles per week in a 67 or 68 Galaxie (the 67 is apart
now, so I've been driving the 68 lately), neither of which have seen more
than 16 MPG when driving _very_ lightly for best mileage and both of which
usually get 12-13 MPG. The 67 has a 289 and the 68 has a 302.

At least I'm doing the environment a favor by having a smaller engine. But
guess what these eco-nuts also ignore. The fact that older car don't have
the same emmisions controls newer cars have. Neither of my cars has any
emmisions controls except a PCV valve. Even though I get better mileage than
half the SUVs out there I still pollute 5x as much as the ones getting the
worst mileage. If they were consistent with their beliefs they would attack
those who pollute, not just pick on a group with a bad stereotype already.

Perhaps, but if the environment is a chief concern with these eco-nuts why
is mileage the big thing they bitch about? Why not tax by pollution too? Or
more specifically the amount of pollution put out per mile a a 50/50 average
of city/highway driving.

It's pointless to argue over this.

Now what we should argue over is what to do about it. Taxing more is not the
answer, it just gives the gov't more money to blow on uselesss crap. Better
and more logical mileage requirements are the way to go to reduce oil
imports. But to go all out to mileage we need to relax pollution standards,
as many pollution controls adversely affect mileage. We need to go one way
or the other, or more logically, stop bitching and make a good plan to do
both.

Is It Moral to Troll in the name of God?

I agree with religious leaders who say it is morally
irresponsible to troll newsgroups. There are at least three moral
issues here: failure to steward the net's resources, greed in
taking a far larger share of these resources than is equitable,
and failure to consider or care about the potential physical
and mental harm to others from such stupid posts.

In several places in the Bible, we are told to be stewards of
our relationships. Despoiling them with hate posts and squandering
intellectual resources is not stewardship. We are all guilty, but
trolls and those with vendettas more so because of their lousy
attitudes.

I believe people who troll and crosspost should be
made to pay higher prices for net access.

Each ISP should have three rates - one for single posting responsible
users, one for crossposters, and one for spammers.

Responsible: $1.00 per month
Crossposters: $175.00 per month
Spammers: $2,500.00 per month

Enjoy your expensive ISP. Quit robbing our net resources.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;I drive about 100 mi. per week in a small car with a 4-cyl.

"/> Do you car pool?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;How many per week for you and what engine size?

"/> I live within a 1-hour walk (15 minute bike ride) of work and drive
about 50 miles a week (mostly shopping and visiting) in a small SUV
(S10 Blazer) with a 2.8L engine. The truck is 18 years old and was
headed for the junkyard when I acquired it. A considerable amount of
energy would have had to be expended melting the whole thing down and
turning it into a new vehicle if I didn't spent so much of my time
scrounging the junkyards for the parts to keep it running - thus
recycling those parts, too, until they're worn to the bone. (Not that
I do all that work solely out of concern for the environment - I just
enjoy taking a piece of scrap and turning it into a reliable,
smoothly-running vehicle on-the-cheap. At the moment I have about
$4,000 invested in this truck, purchase price and all, and fully
expect it to last me at least ten more years).

The reason I want a 4x4 SUV is that I live in a snow state and when
blizzards settle in for the long haul I volunteer my free time to
drive nurses to patients' homes, deliver food and medications to the
elderly, run them to important doctor appointments, etc. I need the
space in the back of the truck to carry fold-up wheelchairs and
groceries, or I can fold the seat up and carry three other people and
still have room in the back for all their luggage.

In the summers I drive well into the backcountry with some friends and
a truckload of tools, where we spend anywhere from a day to a week
doing volunteer maintenance on the hiking trails. Mostly that means a
lot of hard labor fixing erosion problems to keep runoff from turning
some section of trail into an ugly gouge in the mountainside.

You know the sad part? Wherever possible we drive on the trail to get
ourselves and our 600 pounds of tools, food, water, and camping
supplies where we're going without leaving marks on the countryside.
Occasionally some hiker shakes his fist and curses us &quot;drunken 4x4
rednecks&quot; for stupidly thinking a hiking trail is for driving on.

Once someone even threw a big rock at my truck and gashed the hood,
but we never found out who because they were part of a group and
nobody would talk. On another occasion we parked at the trailhead and
just lugged some basic tools in for some simple work. When we got back
tired and beat later in the day, all the SUV's there - and ONLY the
SUV's - had all been keyed and the air let out of their tires.

The self-righteous are like that. They're oh-so-ready to preach
responsibility to everyone else, but don't expect them to step forward
and take responsibility for their own actions.

laws federally mandate that one cannot live in the same neighborhood
as one works in.

I take the train to work, and bike the rest of the way, and it's a
hair-raising ride - narrow lanes, no bike lane at all, cars zooming by
at 45mph. Not very safe at all.

no longer the flow restrictive beasts they were. There is still some

out the catalysts is not going to do your vehicle any good. The only place
yanking them is going to make any difference worthwild is the same place
where it's legal to run straight pipes without mufflers, the track.
Modern EGR is trivial really. If your building a drag car and need that

I think keeping really old cars is bad (15+yrs)... Something like 90% of
auto pollution comes from 10% of cars (i.e. the old ones). My numbers are

Statistically, the average SUV owner and the average econo car owner are the
same... this is assuming a large sample pool (which we have in the US)...
So, on average, SUV drivers are doing more harm to the environment than
econo car drivers. Sure we could all car pool more, SUV and econo drivers
alike. But it is clear that SUV drivers are using unnecessary amounts of
fuel, period.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Now who's being &quot;irresponsible&quot;?

&gt;&gt;How can you assert that the difference is an any way related to the
&gt;&gt;vehicle?

&gt; I'm merely pointing out the hypocrisy of attacking SUV owners as
&gt;&quot;environmentally irresponsible&quot; while ignoring the many-times-greater
&gt; number of people in more fuel-efficient cars who refuse to carpool,
&gt; won't ride a bike 5 miles to work or make use of mass transit, etc.

&gt;&gt; It could easily be presented the other way. Do you have
&gt;&gt;actual numbers for distance traveled, or are you just fabricating
&gt;&gt;hypothetical situations to suit your opinion?

&gt;&gt;I drive about 100 mi. per week in a small car with a 4-cyl.

&gt; Do you car pool?

&gt;&gt;How many per week for you and what engine size?

&gt; I live within a 1-hour walk (15 minute bike ride) of work and drive
&gt; about 50 miles a week (mostly shopping and visiting) in a small SUV
&gt; (S10 Blazer) with a 2.8L engine. The truck is 18 years old and was
&gt; headed for the junkyard when I acquired it. A considerable amount of
&gt; energy would have had to be expended melting the whole thing down and
&gt; turning it into a new vehicle if I didn't spent so much of my time
&gt; scrounging the junkyards for the parts to keep it running - thus
&gt; recycling those parts, too, until they're worn to the bone. (Not that
&gt; I do all that work solely out of concern for the environment - I just
&gt; enjoy taking a piece of scrap and turning it into a reliable,
&gt; smoothly-running vehicle on-the-cheap. At the moment I have about
&gt; $4,000 invested in this truck, purchase price and all, and fully
&gt; expect it to last me at least ten more years).

&gt; The reason I want a 4x4 SUV is that I live in a snow state and when
&gt; blizzards settle in for the long haul I volunteer my free time to
&gt; drive nurses to patients' homes, deliver food and medications to the
&gt; elderly, run them to important doctor appointments, etc. I need the
&gt; space in the back of the truck to carry fold-up wheelchairs and
&gt; groceries, or I can fold the seat up and carry three other people and
&gt; still have room in the back for all their luggage.

&gt; In the summers I drive well into the backcountry with some friends and
&gt; a truckload of tools, where we spend anywhere from a day to a week
&gt; doing volunteer maintenance on the hiking trails. Mostly that means a
&gt; lot of hard labor fixing erosion problems to keep runoff from turning
&gt; some section of trail into an ugly gouge in the mountainside.

&gt; You know the sad part? Wherever possible we drive on the trail to get
&gt; ourselves and our 600 pounds of tools, food, water, and camping
&gt; supplies where we're going without leaving marks on the countryside.
&gt; Occasionally some hiker shakes his fist and curses us &quot;drunken 4x4
&gt; rednecks&quot; for stupidly thinking a hiking trail is for driving on.

&gt; Once someone even threw a big rock at my truck and gashed the hood,
&gt; but we never found out who because they were part of a group and
&gt; nobody would talk. On another occasion we parked at the trailhead and
&gt; just lugged some basic tools in for some simple work. When we got back
&gt; tired and beat later in the day, all the SUV's there - and ONLY the
&gt; SUV's - had all been keyed and the air let out of their tires.

&gt; The self-righteous are like that. They're oh-so-ready to preach
&gt; responsibility to everyone else, but don't expect them to step forward
&gt; and take responsibility for their own actions.

Old enough to be worn and out of tune, new enough that they are on
the roads in great numbers. That's where the pollution comes from.

The few really old cars that are in bad shape as to emit large amounts
of pollution are a self correcting problem, because
a) Someone fixes them, restores them, restomod them with a more modern
drivetrain, etc..
or
b) They are scrapped because they eventually become undrivable.

&gt;Is It Moral to Drive a Gas-Guzzling Vehicle?

&gt;By Your Voices
&gt;Sunday, February 2, 2003; Page C11

&gt;I agree with religious leaders who say it is morally
&gt;irresponsible to drive an SUV. There are at least three moral
&gt;issues here: failure to steward the Earth's resources, greed in
&gt;taking a far larger share of these resources than is equitable,
&gt;and failure to consider or care about the potential physical
&gt;harm to others from such a large, heavy, and higher vehicle.

&gt;In several places in the Bible, we are told to be stewards of
&gt;the Earth. Despoiling it with oil rigs and squandering its

Hummer of a $75,000 tax write-off

Bush proposal would triple what some see as SUV loophole
Hummer sales lots like this one in Schaumburg, Ill., have been busy
with prospective buyers. The Hummer 2 seen here can cost around
$50,000, while the larger Hummer 1 tops $100,000.

By Miguel Llanos
MSNBC

Jan. 31 — Ever thought of buying a Hummer? If you run a small
business, and if President Bush’s proposal to triple a tax deduction
is approved, you could write off up to $75,000 of the cost. The
possibility has raised protests, because the current deduction —
originally meant for farmers and construction firms — is being used by
some realtors, doctors and lawyers to write off costs of the most
gas-guzzling SUVs. Defenders of the proposal counter that even if some
abuses exist, limiting the write-off would penalize legitimate uses.

LEADING THE CHARGE against the SUV deduction is Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif. She introduced legislation Thursday to disallow the
heaviest SUVs from being deducted as a small-business capital expense.
Used also for office equipment like computers, the deduction
currently is limited to $25,000 a year. The president wants to
increase it to $75,000 as part of his economic stimulus plan.
The SUV deduction critics don’t object to the president’s plan,
just the potential abuses. Under a 1986 provision aimed at helping
business owners with heavy equipment, vehicles weighing more than
6,000 pounds when fully loaded may be deducted as a capital expense —
and therein lies the controversy.
More than a dozen SUV models — the 10- to 15-mpg Hummer H1 and
H2 among them — break that weight barrier, making them eligible for
the tax write-off. That’s true even if the small-business owner is a
realtor, doctor, lawyer or the like who might use the vehicle for
personal use part of the time.

ALL VEHICLES EQUAL?
Boxer’s bill would treat these heavier SUVs like cars and
lighter SUVs: an expense that can be depreciated over five years for
up to $14,460.
“Some people are inappropriately using the small-business
capital expense tax deduction to deduct a significant portion of the
cost of the largest and most environmentally destructive sports
utility vehicles on the market,” Boxer wrote the Senate Budget
Committee last week following press reports about the issue.

“As a result, people who do not need a large vehicle for
business purposes are buying the largest Hummer SUVs, Mercedes SUVs,
BMW SUVs and other supersized SUVs.”
Other critics include David Nemtzow, president of the Alliance
to Save Energy, who called Bush’s proposal “outrageous,” especially
since tax credits for fuel-efficient gasoline-electric hybrids “remain
in a congressional traffic jam.”
Given “possible (oil) price and supply shocks if war with Iraq
materializes, the president should be preaching fuel economy, not
encouraging the purchase of vehicles that take the opposite route,” he
said.

Some accountants are advising small business clients -- from farmers
and developers to doctors and lawyers -- to purchase heavy vehicles in
order to claim a special tax write-off for users of heavy equipment –
identified as weighing more than 6,000 lbs. Many SUVs also fall into
that category, raising concerns that some people might be abusing a
deduction originally meant for small farmers and construction firms.
President Bush’s proposal to triple that small business deduction has
fueled the debate. Click on a vehicle maker to see which models

OTHER SUV DISPARITIES
Critics note that the deduction also exempts the heaviest SUVs
from the 3 percent tax on luxury vehicles and can be used in
conjunction with two other small-business write-offs: a bonus 30
percent depreciation on capital expenses, enacted as part of
post-Sept. 11 legislation; and a 20 percent deduction of any remaining
purchase price, part of the normal depreciation for business vehicles.
A $55,000 Hummer H1, for example, could qualify for the $25,000
deduction, plus $9,000 from the 30 percent bonus, plus $4,200 from the
depreciation.

On top of that, critics say, carmakers get a break from the
federal government because their SUV fleets aren’t required to meet
the same mileage benchmark as smaller vehicles.
A separate bill introduced Thursday would raise the SUV and
pickup mileage standards from 20.7 mpg at present to 27.5 mpg, the
current average for smaller vehicles. Two Senate Republicans, Olympia
Snowe and Susan Collins, both of Maine, joined Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., and several other Democrats in sponsoring the bill. A
similar measure died last year.

TREASURY DRAIN SEEN
The IRS doesn’t keep tabs on how many of the capital expense
deductions go to write off SUVs. But Taxpayers for Common Sense, a
watchdog group against government waste, estimates that the
president’s proposal could mean $900 million a year in lost treasury
revenue for every 100,000 SUVs written off.
“This will make any luxury SUV priced under $75,000 completely
deductible in the first year, while making a $106,000 Hummer H1 a
ridiculous value,” said Aileen Roder, the group’s tax program
director.
“We do support helping small business,” Roder said. “But under
the Bush economic stimulus plan, it’s a no-brainer for businesses to
buy gas-guzzling SUVs” instead of more practical vehicles.

&gt;now, so I've been driving the 68 lately), neither of which have seen more
&gt;than 16 MPG when driving _very_ lightly for best mileage and both of which
&gt;usually get 12-13 MPG. The 67 has a 289 and the 68 has a 302.

&gt;At least I'm doing the environment a favor by having a smaller engine. But
&gt;guess what these eco-nuts also ignore. The fact that older car don't have
&gt;the same emmisions controls newer cars have. Neither of my cars has any
&gt;emmisions controls except a PCV valve. Even though I get better mileage than
&gt;half the SUVs out there I still pollute 5x as much as the ones getting the
&gt;worst mileage. If they were consistent with their beliefs they would attack
&gt;those who pollute, not just pick on a group with a bad stereotype already.

"/> The &quot;econuts&quot; are not concerned about you because you are highly
unusual. The other day I counted 50 SUVs (not counting the CRV/RAV4
class vehicles) commuting in from the suburbs with an average of 1.1
persons in each one. i counted 25 SUVs in the modest-size parking lot
where I work. I did not see one Galaxie 500. In fact I can't recall
the last time I saw a Galaxie 500 on my way to work - maybe never.

So what is the stereotype you are thinking about? The owner of the
monster SUV who uses it for his 20+ mile commute in from the burbs,
never uses it for anything that a minivan couldn't do and doesn't give
a rat's ass that he is guzzling gas, polluting the environment and
risking the life of everyone else? Or the 5 - 10% of them who do all
that and drive like assholes too?

&gt;&gt;&gt; For email, remove the first &quot;y&quot; of &quot;whineryy&quot;

&gt;&gt;He's making up a hypothetical situation. Similar situations undoubtedly
&gt;&gt;exist in tons of places, just like the opposite situation surely exists
in
&gt;&gt;many places as well. The point is that the eco-nuts are going after one
&gt;&gt;small group of people because they are more noticeable on the road due to
&gt;&gt;their larger vehicles. When you look at an SUV you are likely to think
&quot;look
&gt;&gt;at that gas guzzler&quot; or &quot;wow, another crazy driver&quot; due to stereotypes.
When
&gt;&gt;you look at a classic car you are more likely to think &quot;that's a nice
car&quot;
&gt;&gt;or &quot;I haven't seen one of those in years&quot;.

&gt;&gt;I drive about 150-175 miles per week in a 67 or 68 Galaxie (the 67 is

"/> The stereotype I was thinking of is the one where all SUV drivers are
inconsiderate fools who drive dangerously and account for 95% of unsafe
actions on our roads. The fact of the matter is that SUVs aren't endangering
anyone's life. Bad drivers are and they are equally distributed among the
full range of vehicles on our roads, from SUVs to compacts to classics. SUVs
are simply more noticeable (as you pointed out) because they are bigger,
which means they will take more brunt of the criticism from those who aren't
educated, or just plain lack common sense.

Because of this stereotype it makes it less of an issue for eco-nuts to pick
on them, if they're unsafe _and_ they pollute more then who wants them on
our roads, eh? What they fail to realize is it's the drivers that make a
vehicle do scary things, not the vehicle itself.

My grandparents used to have a Chevy Blazer which got &gt;15 MPG and now they
have a Chevy Venture that gets &lt;20 MPG. Not a huge difference in mileage
there going from SUV to minivan. I personally wouldn't want to drive either
of those cars, but given the choice I'd take the Blazer. It gets better
mileage than I got now, but not enough worse than the minivan to be a big
issue. 4wd and better towing capacity make it a more practical vehicle (yes,
I enjoy off-roading now and again).

The only thing I would enjoy about the minivan is it's tank is about as big
as that of my Galaxies, so it can go ~500 miles between fill-ups. Both cars
are modern enough ('96 Blazer and '00 Venture) to have plenty of safety
features so I would not feel as though I am endangering my life or anyone
else's in the unlikely event of an accident. I must admit though, in the 67
I've never been seriously bothered by the lack of safety features, though I
do feel safer in the 68 with shoulder belts and a collapsible steering
column, should anything unfortunate ever happen to me.

Well either way, I for one would prefer not to drive a SUV or minivan. I'm
perfectly happy in full-sized cars. I've driven both SUVs and minivans
before and they are all too big for my tastes, perform too badly, and have
too many blind spots.

&gt;&gt;&gt;How can you assert that the difference is an any way related to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;vehicle?

&gt;&gt; I'm merely pointing out the hypocrisy of attacking SUV owners as
&gt;&gt;&quot;environmentally irresponsible&quot; while ignoring the many-times-greater
&gt;&gt; number of people in more fuel-efficient cars who refuse to carpool,
&gt;&gt; won't ride a bike 5 miles to work or make use of mass transit, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It could easily be presented the other way. Do you have
&gt;&gt;&gt;actual numbers for distance traveled, or are you just fabricating
&gt;&gt;&gt;hypothetical situations to suit your opinion?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I drive about 100 mi. per week in a small car with a 4-cyl.

&gt;&gt; Do you car pool?

&gt;&gt;&gt;How many per week for you and what engine size?

&gt;&gt; I live within a 1-hour walk (15 minute bike ride) of work and drive
&gt;&gt; about 50 miles a week (mostly shopping and visiting) in a small SUV
&gt;&gt; (S10 Blazer) with a 2.8L engine. The truck is 18 years old and was
&gt;&gt; headed for the junkyard when I acquired it. A considerable amount of
&gt;&gt; energy would have had to be expended melting the whole thing down and
&gt;&gt; turning it into a new vehicle if I didn't spent so much of my time
&gt;&gt; scrounging the junkyards for the parts to keep it running - thus
&gt;&gt; recycling those parts, too, until they're worn to the bone. (Not that
&gt;&gt; I do all that work solely out of concern for the environment - I just
&gt;&gt; enjoy taking a piece of scrap and turning it into a reliable,
&gt;&gt; smoothly-running vehicle on-the-cheap. At the moment I have about
&gt;&gt; $4,000 invested in this truck, purchase price and all, and fully
&gt;&gt; expect it to last me at least ten more years).

&gt;&gt; The reason I want a 4x4 SUV is that I live in a snow state and when
&gt;&gt; blizzards settle in for the long haul I volunteer my free time to
&gt;&gt; drive nurses to patients' homes, deliver food and medications to the
&gt;&gt; elderly, run them to important doctor appointments, etc. I need the
&gt;&gt; space in the back of the truck to carry fold-up wheelchairs and
&gt;&gt; groceries, or I can fold the seat up and carry three other people and
&gt;&gt; still have room in the back for all their luggage.

&gt;&gt; In the summers I drive well into the backcountry with some friends and
&gt;&gt; a truckload of tools, where we spend anywhere from a day to a week
&gt;&gt; doing volunteer maintenance on the hiking trails. Mostly that means a
&gt;&gt; lot of hard labor fixing erosion problems to keep runoff from turning
&gt;&gt; some section of trail into an ugly gouge in the mountainside.

&gt;&gt; You know the sad part? Wherever possible we drive on the trail to get
&gt;&gt; ourselves and our 600 pounds of tools, food, water, and camping
&gt;&gt; supplies where we're going without leaving marks on the countryside.
&gt;&gt; Occasionally some hiker shakes his fist and curses us &quot;drunken 4x4
&gt;&gt; rednecks&quot; for stupidly thinking a hiking trail is for driving on.

&gt;&gt; Once someone even threw a big rock at my truck and gashed the hood,
&gt;&gt; but we never found out who because they were part of a group and
&gt;&gt; nobody would talk. On another occasion we parked at the trailhead and
&gt;&gt; just lugged some basic tools in for some simple work. When we got back
&gt;&gt; tired and beat later in the day, all the SUV's there - and ONLY the
&gt;&gt; SUV's - had all been keyed and the air let out of their tires.

&gt;&gt; The self-righteous are like that. They're oh-so-ready to preach
&gt;&gt; responsibility to everyone else, but don't expect them to step forward
&gt;&gt; and take responsibility for their own actions.

have
&gt;&gt; too many blind spots.

&gt; referring to the last generations of Impala family, Diplomat family and of
&gt; course the last few years of real good full size wagons. Currently there
is
&gt; only 2 &quot;real&quot; full size cars available in the market the Crown Vic and the
&gt; Grand Marquis.

&gt; Snow...

"/> Why is that? I would think there would be a larger demand for full-size
cars. For a lot of people a SUV or minivan is just too big but they
want/need a big car.

If I was ever to buy a new car (doubtful, repairs are cheaper and more fun
than car payments), I would want a full-size car with few 'creature
comforts' or 'extra feautures', and preferably a manual transmission. I'm
sure you can't get a manual with a full sized car anymore so that's out.
Looking at Fords site the base Crown Vic has a bunch of 'features', some
that seem particularly useless which I would rather not have are:

- Headlamps, Wiper Activated
- Luxury Cloth Seats w/8-Way Power Driver

I'd also prefer not to have ABS, though I'm sure there ought to be a way to
disable it. I guess it would be a nice thing to play with, if it can quickly
and easily be toggled on/off. Probably good on ice, but I'd rather not have
it when the ground is dry or just wet.

Too much stuff I don't need or want. I would be perfectly happy with a
no-frills car (well, overdrive would be nice) with a big engine. The Crown
Vic also lacks the big engine. With a big car I'd prefer a big engine with
torque down nice and low.

Large and obnoxious SUVs endanger other smaller vehicles on the road

It's mostly about attitude. And SUV drivers certainly have been
projecting a very negative image with their &quot;bad attitude&quot; and bad road
manners. Perhaps we should send those as*hole SUV drivers to the
frontline fighting for the oil in Iraq?

On a more positve note: I saw a large SUV driver got beat up after he cut
a small car off. After a few minutes of road rage, the SUV driver stopped
the Toyota Corolla and started yelling at the Corolla driver. The Corolla
driver calmly got out of his car and plunged the Excursion driver's head
on the side of the Excursion. In less than a minute, the Excursion driver
was covered with blood. Many bystanders cheered!

A lesson well taught. May it happen more often.

There's many legitimate reason that would affect the purchase of a
vehicle that consumes more then the others. For example, towing,
off-roading, emergency response, security and safety (safety is another
can of worms, but many SUV owners feel safer in a bigger heavier
vehicle…usually the type that ends up ramming their way out of an
accident situation). However, as most of us know on this NW, most of the
SUV owners do not fall under one the legitimate reasons mentioned above.
In my opinion, the two biggest reasons for a SUV purchase (obviously
being a 'greenie' and environmentally conscious is not a consideration)
is Status and Power. Having a large and impressive looking vehicle is a
display of ones wealth and success. Even if the common SUV is not as
expensive as a high-end sedan, it's grand stature gives it some accept
among the more affluent vehicle/owner. Being in a larger vehicle and
being able to look down on the lowly sedans gives one a sense of power.
Most of these power hungry type are somewhat insulted by the fact the
weenie vehicle dares to pass them on the left lane, but then they're
comforted in knowing that they can always crush the teenie pest with
their big and mighty SUV.

&gt; Each gas station should have three lines - one for compact

&gt; On a more positve note: I saw a large SUV driver got beat up after he cut
&gt; a small car off. After a few minutes of road rage, the SUV driver stopped
&gt; the Toyota Corolla and started yelling at the Corolla driver. The Corolla
&gt; driver calmly got out of his car and plunged the Excursion driver's head
&gt; on the side of the Excursion. In less than a minute, the Excursion driver
&gt; was covered with blood. Many bystanders cheered!

As someone who owns a full sized truck (15 mpg) and a Honda Insight (55
mpg), I think there are uses for both.

The Insight gets really great gas mileage, but it's kind of limited in that
it only carries 2 people, has a 365 pound total weight limit (people and
cargo).

The truck (or SUV) have their benefits too. These can include:
1) Carrying many people
2) Carrying heavy stuff
3) Safely pulling trailers
4) Safely carrying bulky stuff.

Have you ever gone to Home Depot and have seen people with 2x4s sticking 6
feet (2 meters) out of the window? That's more dangerous on the road than
the SUV/truck that would carry it safely.

Also, a big car is probably just as 'bad' gas wise and other car safety wise
than a SUV. I've been
rear-ended with a full size truck when driving a Ford T-bird. The truck had
a lot more damage than the
car. I'd rather be hit by a suburban than a large Mercedes any day.

It would be nice if they made it easier to have 2 cars. But with a commuter
car being taxed and doubled insurance it makes people just have the more
practical vehicle.

&gt; the two biggest reasons for a SUV purchase (obviously

&gt;The stereotype I was thinking of is the one where all SUV drivers are
&gt;inconsiderate fools who drive dangerously and account for 95% of unsafe

&gt;anyone's life. Bad drivers are and they are equally distributed among the
&gt;full range of vehicles on our roads, from SUVs to compacts to classics. SUVs
&gt;are simply more noticeable (as you pointed out) because they are bigger,
&gt;which means they will take more brunt of the criticism from those who aren't
&gt;educated, or just plain lack common sense.

"/> It's hard to say without accurate statistical evidence but I believe the
prevailing opinion is that you are wrong there - SUV drivers *are*
definitely less considerate drivers. We've even heard the &quot;excuse&quot; that
&quot;I'm not a very good driver and I feel safer in my SUV&quot;... which kinda begs
the question: &quot;what about the rest of us&quot;? To paraphrase: &quot;if I'm in an
accident I want to be sure it's the other guy that gets killed/maimed, not
me&quot;. Another one: &quot;I like the high commanding view&quot;... without any notion
that if we all drove SUVs the high view would no longer be &quot;commanding&quot;.

When the left lane of a freeway is blocked by a procession of vehicles,
while the right lanes are relatively uncluttered my, observation is that
most are SUVs; at take-off from traffic lights the people who use the
accelerator as a On/Off switch are usually driving SUVs; when I've narrowly
missed being knocked down, on a crosswalk, in a downtown area it's
invariably an SUV with the on/off switch in the On position; when I get
blinded by some mindless fool with fog-lamps on when there is no fog, it's
usually an SUV. I'm afraid that the stereotype fits for many - those
people are very often buffoons.

&gt;&gt; While they're better than they used to be, catalysts are still a power

&gt;Any significant power loss is generally due to a poor stock design

&gt;restrictive? (putting aside the crappy aftermarket parts)

"/>&lt;sigh&gt; We'll have to disagree then. The facts are out there and the Euros,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I'm not talking about ripping or yanking anything out - an absurd
&gt;&gt; comparison since the entire engine system is designed to work with a cat

&gt;&gt; optimized for low emissions and compare with the same basic engine, without
&gt;&gt; a cat and EGR, with all its parameters optimized for power and economy
&gt;&gt; there will be a substantial difference in max power - somewhere in the
&gt;&gt; region of 10-15bhp in a 2L engine, or worth about 400cc of engine capacity.

&gt;10-15hp seems rather high, considering entire aftermarket exhaust systems
&gt;from the headers back (with or without cats) don't seem to yield much
&gt;more than that. Unless by optimized you mean totally ignoring emissions
&gt;and going with new cam profiles, etc and so on....

"/> It *is* possible to get to quite low emissions with a properly designed
engine, induction and exhaust systems and without a catlyst or EGR, so they
don't need to be *totally* ignored. Notably, Honda and VW managed to
satisfy federal regs without either until the early/mid-80s... until the
regs became more restrictive. I don't know why you insist on harping about
mods to a system which is designed for a catalytic converter - that's not
the issue. The fact is that without the efficiency compromises -
induction, valve timing, combustion control, exhaust - necessary to cope
with after-treatment emissions devices. you can get significantly more
power and economy. In many cases 10-15bhp would be modest.

&gt;Is It Moral to Drive a Gas-Guzzling Vehicle?

&gt;By Your Voices
&gt;Sunday, February 2, 2003; Page C11

&gt;I agree with religious leaders who say it is morally
&gt;irresponsible to drive an SUV. There are at least three moral
&gt;issues here: failure to steward the Earth's resources, greed in
&gt;taking a far larger share of these resources than is equitable,
&gt;and failure to consider or care about the potential physical
&gt;harm to others from such a large, heavy, and higher vehicle.

&gt;In several places in the Bible, we are told to be stewards of
&gt;the Earth. Despoiling it with oil rigs and squandering its
&gt;resources is not stewardship. We are all guilty, but SUV
&gt;drivers more so because of the SUV's lousy gas mileage.

"/> By those standards, it is not moral to drive (or ride in) any vehicle.
Since oil is a finite resource (the world is only so big) ANY level of use,
no matter how parsimonious, will eventually use it all up and leave future
generations to do without (and since the Sun is expected to shine another 6
billion years (that's billion with a 'b&quot;) we can expect a lot of future
generations). And ANY vehicle (well maybe not a unicycle), even a
horse-drawn cart, heck, even a horse, is large and heavy compared to a human
and thus potentially dangerous.

To be even a little consistent, those same &quot;religious leaders&quot; should be
pro-birth control and pro-abortion. Fewer people, after all, would consume
fewer resources.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Statistically, the average SUV owner and the average econo car owner are the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;same... this is assuming a large sample pool (which we have in the US)...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So, on average, SUV drivers are doing more harm to the environment than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;econo car drivers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;As a group, it's the econo-car drivers who are doing more harm - they
&gt;&gt;&gt;outnumber the SUV's by about twenty-to-one.

&gt;&gt;That is simply untrue for the US market. Look at 2002 sales. Small
&gt;&gt;cars were a little over 13% of total sales. Mid sized SUVs were
&gt;&gt;11.6%.

&gt;Sorry, your numbers fail the common-sense test of just looking at
&gt;what's on the road. What I see is that SUV's of all types are in fact
&gt;about 1 out of 20 vehicles, and people here are very big on SUV's
&gt;compared to most cities.

&gt;&gt;Large SUVs accounted for 5.24%. Granted that this only
&gt;&gt;reflects what was sold last year, not what is on the road, but clearly

&gt;Not that I was talking only of large SUV's, but 5.24% is roughly one
&gt;out of 20...

larger, not CRVs) outsold economy cars by 30%. If you like, I will

&gt;&gt;vehicle altogether, but it is far less harmful than buying a Suburban.

&gt;Self-righteous SUV-haters aren't targeting individual SUV drivers,
&gt;they're targeting *ALL* SUV drivers. I therefore reserve the right to

&gt;&gt;&gt;be doing if I had to drive to work. Anything less is hypocrisy.

&gt;&gt;There is no bright threshold separating conservationists from energy

&gt;&gt;on a global scale. (Even thought I think it is great that you can
&gt;&gt;live near your work place and bike to work.)

&gt;It isn't mere happenstance that I can do so. If everyone else were
&gt;just as insistent on living close to work, we wouldn't have zoning
&gt;laws today that put clean industry on one end of town and housing 30
&gt;miles away on the opposite side.

"/> The biggest culprit is urban sprawl. I work at a big, old factory
that has houses literally across the street. Almost no one who works

for the same company but at the professional park near the factory.)
Almost no one who works there lives nearby. These two factories are
more than 50 miles apart so there is no way we could can avoid 100
miles of commuting per day. (My wife has used public transportation

&gt;novel new idea - they've been doing it for at least the past 20 years.

Today I had an incident with a SUV driver. I'm cruising home around 8:15
doing a nice relaxing 60 MPH in the rightmost lane (traffic on this road
usually goes 70-75 MPH), I was worn out from a long day and just wanted to
relax and enjoy the drive so I stayed right with the slow traffic.

A SUV in the middle lane (3 lane road) was slowly passing me. Out of nowhere
this other SUV blows by me and just barely squeaks through the gap between
me and the SUV that just passed me (no turn signal of course). I laid on my
horn real good when I saw what he was gonna do. Musta been doing at least
80+ MPH as he was out of sight within a second or two as he weaved through
just as narrow gaps between other cars.

I caught the first couple characters on his plate, but that's all. I was
surprised when I saw him get off at my exit which was less than a mile after
he weaved by me. I decided I'd play a little and follow him menacingly like.
An 18 wheeler got off in front of me so that slowed me down a bit, but I saw
which way he went and followed. Floored it after him. Put on my brights
since no other cars were around. I'm sure he saw me coming up on him at ~70
MPH when he was doing half that at best. A few blocks later he turned into a
driveway and I stopped in the middle of the street in front of the driveway
since no one else was around. I stuck my hand out the window and made a gun
with it, pretending to shoot him several times as he walked to the door and
went inside. Spun the tires a bit after he went inside.

I know what I did was a bit irresponsible, but hey, he deserved it. I was
just cruising along, winding down with a nice relaxing drive home and this
wacko nearly slams into my front fender. Just trying to vent some stress as
I see twits like this almost every day. Usually to other people, but more
often than I'd like they do this shit to me too. Heck, for all I know he was
drunk. Now that I'm thinking back on it I shoulda called 911 on my cell
phone and told them I suspected he was drunk as he was weaving through
traffic at high speeds. Woulda been nice and easy after I followed him home.
:) Oh well, I'm sure he didn't expect what he got. At the very least I hope
he recognized my car as one he nearly hit weaving through traffic. Probably
did as I was one of the last he passed, and a 68 Galaxie stands out a bit
over all those plastic cars.

Either way, I don't attribute his bad driving to being a SUV driver. I
attribute it to his being an ass hole who needs a good old fashioned
shooting in the face. I see more fags driving like that in rice-mobiles than
SUVs, but not many people pick on ricers for endangering people's lives. Why
is that? They don't get the attention of the eco-nuts for killing the earth,
since they drive crappy Hondas and other tiny foreign cars.

&gt;&gt;The stereotype I was thinking of is the one where all SUV drivers are
&gt;&gt;inconsiderate fools who drive dangerously and account for 95% of unsafe
&gt;&gt;actions on our roads. The fact of the matter is that SUVs aren't
endangering
&gt;&gt;anyone's life. Bad drivers are and they are equally distributed among the
&gt;&gt;full range of vehicles on our roads, from SUVs to compacts to classics.
SUVs
&gt;&gt;are simply more noticeable (as you pointed out) because they are bigger,
&gt;&gt;which means they will take more brunt of the criticism from those who
aren't
&gt;&gt;educated, or just plain lack common sense.

&gt; It's hard to say without accurate statistical evidence but I believe the
&gt; prevailing opinion is that you are wrong there - SUV drivers *are*
&gt; definitely less considerate drivers. We've even heard the &quot;excuse&quot; that
&gt;&quot;I'm not a very good driver and I feel safer in my SUV&quot;... which kinda
begs
&gt; the question: &quot;what about the rest of us&quot;? To paraphrase: &quot;if I'm in an
&gt; accident I want to be sure it's the other guy that gets killed/maimed, not
&gt; me&quot;. Another one: &quot;I like the high commanding view&quot;... without any notion
&gt; that if we all drove SUVs the high view would no longer be &quot;commanding&quot;.

&gt; When the left lane of a freeway is blocked by a procession of vehicles,
&gt; while the right lanes are relatively uncluttered my, observation is that
&gt; most are SUVs; at take-off from traffic lights the people who use the
&gt; accelerator as a On/Off switch are usually driving SUVs; when I've
narrowly
&gt; missed being knocked down, on a crosswalk, in a downtown area it's
&gt; invariably an SUV with the on/off switch in the On position; when I get
&gt; blinded by some mindless fool with fog-lamps on when there is no fog, it's
&gt; usually an SUV. I'm afraid that the stereotype fits for many - those
&gt; people are very often buffoons.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well either way, I for one would prefer not to drive a SUV or minivan.
&gt; I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt; perfectly happy in full-sized cars. I've driven both SUVs and minivans
&gt;&gt;&gt; before and they are all too big for my tastes, perform too badly, and
&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; too many blind spots.

&gt;&gt; Just keep in mind, that what yourself, a few others and I refer to as a
&gt;&gt;&quot;full-sized&quot; car doesn't currently exist as we have known it to. I am not
&gt;&gt; referring to the nice old cars the size of small countries either, I am
&gt;&gt; referring to the last generations of Impala family, Diplomat family and of
&gt;&gt; course the last few years of real good full size wagons. Currently there
&gt; is
&gt;&gt; only 2 &quot;real&quot; full size cars available in the market the Crown Vic and the
&gt;&gt; Grand Marquis.

&gt;&gt; Snow...

&gt; Why is that? I would think there would be a larger demand for full-size
&gt; cars. For a lot of people a SUV or minivan is just too big but they
&gt; want/need a big car.

"/> OK, think like a car manufacturer.

Your fleet-wide average fuel economy for all of the passenger cars
that you sell must be at least 27.5 mpg. The fleet-wide average fuel
economy of all the light trucks (including minivans and passenger
trucks) must be at least 21.7 mpg.

Now, you have a target market that's people with two or three teen or
pre-teen children and you are designing and building a vehicle for
them. They might want to go someplace with Grandma from time to time,
so seating for 5 to 7 adults would be good. Also, they might want
enough luggage capacity so they can take the vehicle on a long family
vacation trip once or twice a year. Are you going to make a car for
their needs that must count toward the required 27.5 mpg average? Or
are you going to make a truck for them that counts toward the required
21.7mpg average? Manufacturers don't make larger cars any more because
they get punished by CAFE laws for doing it.

Also, purchasers of large cars get punished by gas guzzler taxes
(which apply only to cars, not to trucks).

&gt; Is It Moral to Drive a Gas-Guzzling Vehicle?

&gt; By Your Voices
&gt; Sunday, February 2, 2003; Page C11

&gt; I agree with religious leaders who say it is morally
&gt; irresponsible to drive an SUV. There are at least three moral
&gt; issues here: failure to steward the Earth's resources, greed in
&gt; taking a far larger share of these resources than is equitable,
&gt; and failure to consider or care about the potential physical
&gt; harm to others from such a large, heavy, and higher vehicle.

&gt; In several places in the Bible, we are told to be stewards of
&gt; the Earth. Despoiling it with oil rigs and squandering its
&gt; resources is not stewardship. We are all guilty, but SUV
&gt; drivers more so because of the SUV's lousy gas mileage.

&gt; -- Anne Ambler, Silver Spring

&gt; More reader's responses at:
&gt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7332-2003Jan31.html
&gt; ==============

&gt; I believe people who drive larger, gas guzzlers should be
&gt; made to pay higher prices for gasoline.

&gt; Each gas station should have three lines - one for compact
&gt; cars, one for medium sized cars and one for SUV's.

&gt; Compact: $1.00 per gallon
&gt; Medium: $1.75 per gallon
&gt; SUV's: $2.50 per gallon

&gt; And enjoy your expensive ride. Quit robbing our natural resources.

&gt; -Jack

"/> Jack,

I'm just curious. How much do you think about the environment in your
everyday life? Do you carpool? Do your recyle? Those are good starts,
but they aren't all you can do for the environment on your own. Do you
avoid buying goods made in places where polution laws are lax or
non-existant?

I'm amazed at how many &quot;environmentalists&quot; think nothing of buying
goods made in China (one of the biggest polluters on the planet),
India or other third world locations because these are the cheapest
goods available. They do this even when similar competing goods are
available that are of higher quality and that are made in more
environmentally responsible locations like the United States, Canada
and western Europe. These &quot;environmentalists&quot; actually care very
little about the environment. They certainly won't spend any of their
own money to help save the planet. They just want the power to tell
others what to do. They couch their quest for power as &quot;caring about
the environment,&quot; but in reality, by their actions, they really don't
try to save the environment themselves. They just want to force others
to be environmentally friendly. They rarely take personal action to
protect the environment.

So, Jack, do you put your money where your words are? Or are you a
hypocrite who just wants to tell others what they can and can't do, or
what you think they should do.

"/> If you mean CO2 / &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; emissions, then higher fuel economy
automatically reduces emissions.

If you mean HC, CO, NOx, and particulate, it isn't necessarily true
that higher fuel economy automatically reduces emissions. For example,
lean burn internal combustion tends to produce more NOx. Diesel engines
fit into this category (and cannot reduce NOx very effectively by exhaust
after-treatment until the diesel fuel sulfur level is reduced). Gasoline
engines can also be tuned for lean burn, but that can make their NOx
emissions worse. Although, to the extent that better engine controls
burn the fuel more completely, improving fuel economy can help reduce
HC and CO emissions.

Also, the primitive first generation emissions controls of the 1970s
tended to result in significantly worse fuel economy and power (as
well as drivability in many cases) than in slightly older cars without
or with fewer emissions controls.

It is hard to argue that the emissions controls costs the Escape 15 hp
when the Honda has nearly double the horsepower and still meets LEV
standards.

Obviously, a 2L engine can be tuned to a wide range of hp and still
meet emissions standards. For a given hp, the necessity to meet
emissions regs presumably costs some fuel efficiency, if for no other
reason than having to pull the extra weight of a catalytic convertor.
How severe is that mpg penalty? Pretty hard to say, but I don't think
it is too much at this point. For one thing, the interests of not
destroying the engine will limit how close you are going to get to
perfect stoichiometry. IOW, you will always want to be a little on
the rich side, which works well with a catalytic convertor.

will bring the numbers I'm talking about.

With the current talk of NASCAR, and maybe other racing series, being on
the brink of implementing emission controls, to combat CO poisoning, we
*may* even get to hear some revised numbers for racing engines.

&gt;&gt; Why is that? I would think there would be a larger demand for full-size
&gt;&gt; cars. For a lot of people a SUV or minivan is just too big but they
&gt;&gt; want/need a big car.

&gt; OK, think like a car manufacturer.

&gt; Your fleet-wide average fuel economy for all of the passenger cars
&gt; that you sell must be at least 27.5 mpg. The fleet-wide average fuel
&gt; economy of all the light trucks (including minivans and passenger
&gt; trucks) must be at least 21.7 mpg.

&gt; Now, you have a target market that's people with two or three teen or
&gt; pre-teen children and you are designing and building a vehicle for
&gt; them. They might want to go someplace with Grandma from time to time,
&gt; so seating for 5 to 7 adults would be good. Also, they might want
&gt; enough luggage capacity so they can take the vehicle on a long family
&gt; vacation trip once or twice a year. Are you going to make a car for
&gt; their needs that must count toward the required 27.5 mpg average? Or
&gt; are you going to make a truck for them that counts toward the required
&gt; 21.7mpg average? Manufacturers don't make larger cars any more because
&gt; they get punished by CAFE laws for doing it.

&gt; Also, purchasers of large cars get punished by gas guzzler taxes
&gt; (which apply only to cars, not to trucks).

&gt; Racer X

"/> Seems like the system is pretty ridiculous. The system should apply to what
the vehicles designed use is. Now don't anyone tell me someone getting a
leather interior in their SUV is _ever_ going to take it off road. The fact
that we now have luxury SUVs underscores that. Why is a leather interior
even an option in a truck? Anyway, I don't see the current system changing
for the better anytime soon, but with any luck a new (hopefully smaller) fad
will come along in a few years.

What is Europe's equivalent of CAFE like? You see tons of miniature cars
over there, but I wouldn't be caught dead in one of those things (like the
Geo Metro). My cars are easily twice the length of those miniature cars. Oh,
I have tried the miniature car thing and it didn't work. I could have got my
dad's Geo Prizm for next to nothing. The thing is that I'm 6'3&quot; and it's
downright uncomfortable in there. Not to mention how my visibility is
limited by the post in the middle of the car (right next to my face blocking
all peripheral vision) and I have to contort to overcome the blind spots.
Doesn't feel very safe. My 67 has excellent visibility, the best of any car
I've driven. The 68's visibility is alright, though the back sail panel on
the left blocks the view of my blind spot a bit. Still a hardtop so no post
to block view.

Come to think of it I'm a bit cramped in nearly every car I've driven except
my old Fords. The only one I don't remember not being annoyed over little
leg or head room is my aunts Durango and my grandma's Blazer. My mom and
grandparents minivans are cramped, my grandfathers Intrigue is miniature
(he's 6'1&quot; so I don't know how he does it, but my head hits the roof), my
other aunts pathfinder is a little cramped, but not terribly bad, my
friend's Saturn is tiny. My other friends Pontiac Sunfire isn't too bad, but
then that's fuel injected, computerized, and probably doesn't have any V8
option so it's out of the question for me. Oh well, just going though a
mental list of cars that are uncomfortable to drive. But of course those
that tend to be roomy enough are SUVs which I wouldn't get becuase I want a
car, that and it has to be 80's or older since I don't want that computer
junk on it. :)

I personally think SUVs have horrid visibility, they are just like minivans
in that respect. Go look at some cars with bad visibility. How about early
Mustang fastbacks? Not the best visibility at all. Anyway, if you are
complaining about blocking other people's visibility that's just a
nonsensical argument. If you are following that close to SUVs that your
visibility is hindered that much then what you are doing is called
tailgating and is part of unsafe driving. Just fall back to a safe following
distance and you will be fine. What constitutes a safe following distance is
not just being able to stop and react quickly enough, but being able to see.

"/> 8000rpm is a little extreme, but I'm sure Honda's engine can still return good emission
levels at 6000rpm at open throttle. Having a car that can rev like a motorcycle is lots
of fun, but it's not practical for every day driving. The engine's power should be a
even build-up to the redline, not a mad rush for the last 2000rpm of the rev range.
Utilizing the high rev power is very demanding in aggressive driving (especially in the
city).

Putting on a 4500 rpm cap is plain ignorant. All it will do is give the big dumb
American engine an edge over the smart and fuel efficient japanese engine. The
government should only be concerned about the emission level that are produced by the
vehicles (under all type of driving situation) and leave the vehicle's design up to the
manufacture. What does dumb-ass bureaucrat know about cars anyways?

Many years ago, after revieving a series of richly deserved tickets for

precisely the speed limit (45 mph IIRC) westbound on a friday night,
sometime around 8:00, when i learned an important lesson: by driving 20
mph slower than the other n-thousand cars around me i made myself into
an unanticipated, dangerous impedance.

My car's paint never even got scratched. But the fellow at fault --
some punk kid passing on the right at 75 -- didn't expect my poking
along, and his loss of control when he tried to avoid me caused a six

fault; i know that if i hadn't been driving differently than the other
ten thousand people leaving chicago that night the kid probably, very
likely, wouldn't have taken five other cars out and shutdown the
outbound IKE for an hour.

Of course, everyone reassured me it wasn't my fault. But when almost
the same exact profile occured a week later (!), ending instead with
only the right-side passer grinding his car against the Ike's northern
retention wall, and a _lot_ of smoke coming from other cars' tires (but
no contact) I decided that ... driving the limit on semicongested high

"/> I totally agree with you. Obeying the law while driving is often hazardous.
I believe the laws ought to be more relaxed to let people make their own
judgments of what safe behavior is. Any cop can tell what safe and unsafe
driving is and take whatever action he deems appropriate.

I'm not saying we should modify our behavior to accommodate those who don't
know how to drive safely, but I am saying laws are laws. They are nothing
more and nothing less. Just because it's a law doesn't make it right, safe,
moral, or anything else you want to tag on it (be it good or bad). Just like
many cops say &quot;The law is the law and it's my job to enforce it&quot;. That is
the downfall of the police, they can't enforce safety, but have to work
within the law and common sense goes out the window as soon as an officer is
on duty. They ought to patrol the highways looking for unsafe behavior, not
just speeding. That is why I resent the police and do as little as legally
possible to make their job harder if they choose to approach me.

&gt;&gt;It wasn't the push for lower emissions, it was the push for higher fuel

&gt;&gt;something that gives people an incentive to want more fuel efficient
&gt;&gt;cars, not something that tries to force car makers to create them. If
&gt;&gt;people want them, car makers will move to fill that demand.

&gt;&gt;I'm not sure what the best way to do this would be. Eventually rising
&gt;&gt;gas prices will do it. A tax on new vehicles based on their EPA fuel
&gt;&gt;economy might work, or a serious tax credit for more efficient vehicles.
&gt;&gt; (The current setup of offering a $2,000 tax deduction for a hybrid and
&gt;&gt;a $75,000 tax deduction for an SUV just doesn't cut it.)

&gt; It seems to me that the best way to do this would be a higher gas tax,
&gt; to pay for the rebuilding of our road infrastructure.

"/> If I use our roads 100 miles a weekin my 68 Galaxie and my buddy uses the

half the mileage his car gets. However, we both used the roads the same
amount, explain how that is &quot;the more you use, the more you pay&quot;.

&gt; A &quot;gas guzzler&quot; tax is disproportionally hard on those who do what's
&gt; wanted - drive less.
&gt; I know Arizona was stupid enough to offer to pay most of the price of
&gt; a new 'multi-fuel' vehicle... Who else?

"/> I think tax incentives or 'rebates' sound good for hybrid vehicles. That
will make them more affordable, and within the reach of more people.

A hybrid is more expensive to own and operate than an older traditional car.
Lets do some math with my current daily driver vs a new Honda hybrid...

-68 Ford Galaxie 500, 302 auto-
150,000 miles / 13 MPG = 11,539 gallons
11,539 gallons * $1.50 per gallon = $17,308 in gas over 150,000 miles
$17,308 for gas + $2,500 for the car = $19,808 total cost

-03 Honda Civic Hybrid-
150,000 miles / 50 MPG = 3,000 gallons
3,000 gallons * $1.50 per gallon = $4,500 in gas over 150,000 miles
$4,500 for gas + $19,550 for the car (in it's most basic form) = $24,050
total cost

The Honda's TCO is $4,242 more than the 68 Ford which gets much worse
mileage. If it's cheaper to own a car that old getting that bad mileage then
it's likely cheaper to own a newer car (80's-90's) which gets better than 13
MPG. Thi sof course isn't considering repairs, but the 68 Ford has a big
advantage over the Honda seeing as how domestic parts are cheaper, and if
you don't do the work yourself you pay less for labor since the mechanic has
more room to work in and less to get in the way of the particular thing
needing repair. So the Ford starts off with a big cost advantage that is
likely to stay about the same, if not end up with an even cheaper TCO of the
Ford.

When you consider that newer used cars which are more fuel efficient can be
had for $500-$2,500 you see how TCO of a fuel efficient traditional car vs a
new hybrid can easily put the hybrid out of reach of many people. My uncle
just got a Mitsubishi that gets nearly 30 MPG for $350. I won't even do the
math on that one, as the savings are astronomical.

Anyway, make the TCO of the hybrid more affordable and it will sell better.

the vehicles to protect the occupants in the inevitable accidents
without posing undue risks to other drivers? This is not some
futuristic, pie-the-sky proposal. Those cars are on the road now.

&gt;I personally think SUVs have horrid visibility, they are just like minivans

&gt;visibility is hindered that much then what you are doing is called
&gt;tailgating and is part of unsafe driving.

&gt;Just fall back to a safe following
&gt;distance and you will be fine. What constitutes a safe following distance is
&gt;not just being able to stop and react quickly enough, but being able to see.

"/> That's OK if you are following one on a country highway, but in rush
hour traffic you can't stay 50 feet away from every SUV in the city.
The vision thing is not just a problem when you are following an SUV

to keep as much space as necessary between them and the SUVs, road use
efficiency would plummet and traffic would snarl.

&gt; What is Europe's equivalent of CAFE like?

"/> Europe has nothing analogous to our CAFE laws. In Europe,
manufacturers are free to make whatever vehicles they want, and people
are free to buy whatever vehicles they want.

However, the taxation structures over there are significantly
different from what we have in the USA. First, fuel is heavily taxed.
Gasoline prices in Europe right now range from about $3.00 (USD) to
$5.00 (USD) per U.S. Gallon. Diesel prices are in the same general
range. The wholesale cost of petroleum and the refining costs are
similar to the costs in the United States. The primary difference is
taxes.

Also, the anual taxes on automobiles are very different over there.
Often, the taxation is based on engine displacement, power or vehicle
weight. And the tax rates are very progressive. Typically, a vehicle
with a 2.0 liter engine will cost about 4 times as much in taxes as a
vehicle with a 1.0 liter engine. Some countries are even more
progressive. Even the taxes on a vehicle with a 1.0 liter engine are
generally higher than anual taxes and tag fees in the United States.

Because of the tax structure, most Europeans prefer much smaller, much
more fuel efficient vehicles. Actually, they often can't afford the
taxes and fuel expenses for larger vehicles.

Any attempt to raise fuel taxes and vehicle taxes anywhere near
European levels would be politically impossible in the United States.
The Republicans would never want to increase taxes to those levels.
The Democrats wouldn't want it because it would really hurt &quot;working
familes&quot; and the &quot;evil rich&quot; would barely be affected. Also, the
economic consequences of a sudden increase in fuel taxes to long haul
truckers and other transportation industries would be devastating.

Finally, there's no real constitutional authority for an anual federal
tax on motor vehicle use, and the states wouldn't all raise their
motor vehicle taxes to anything close to European levels and scales.

&gt;&gt;&gt;there will be a substantial difference in max power - somewhere in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;region of 10-15bhp in a 2L engine, or worth about 400cc of engine
&gt;capacity.

&gt;&gt; So a 2L 4-cyl Ford Escape could have perhaps as much as 142 hp. But
&gt;&gt; the 2L 4-cyl Honda S2000 already makes 240hp. Would it also be
&gt;&gt; eligible for a 15hp gain? Cool, but that is only worth about 125cc.
&gt;&gt; It is hard to argue that the emissions controls costs the Escape 15 hp
&gt;&gt; when the Honda has nearly double the horsepower and still meets LEV
&gt;&gt; standards.

&gt;&gt; Obviously, a 2L engine can be tuned to a wide range of hp and still
&gt;&gt; meet emissions standards. For a given hp, the necessity to meet
&gt;&gt; emissions regs presumably costs some fuel efficiency, if for no other
&gt;&gt; reason than having to pull the extra weight of a catalytic convertor.
&gt;&gt; How severe is that mpg penalty? Pretty hard to say, but I don't think
&gt;&gt; it is too much at this point. For one thing, the interests of not
&gt;&gt; destroying the engine will limit how close you are going to get to
&gt;&gt; perfect stoichiometry. IOW, you will always want to be a little on
&gt;&gt; the rich side, which works well with a catalytic convertor.

&gt;That Honda may make more HP than my V8s (sad, aint it?), but I guarantee you

&gt;doesn't peak till 5000 RPM (about as high as either of my V8s rev) then
&gt;that's a lot of RPM to gain that may not come quickly enough to get you out
&gt;of a hazardous situation.

"/> Not that it has anything to do with the discussion at hand but
technically, torque does not &quot;move cars&quot; i.e. accelerate them
quickly. Give me a 500 hp motor of reasonable weight - I don't care
at what rpm - and I can accelerate a car quickly. OTOH an engine that
makes 500 ft-lb of torque won't do crap if it redlines at 50 rpm.
Furthermore, it does not matter where the torque peak is, but what the
hp is at the current rpm. That Honda engine will always be running
faster than your Galaxie 500 (except at idle), so comparing torque/hp
at any given rpm is misleading.

For a light car with a good transmission and a skilled, attentive
driver, these high reving motors are great. And they will certainly
avoid accidents better than a Galaxie 500.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The stereotype I was thinking of is the one where all SUV drivers are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;inconsiderate fools who drive dangerously and account for 95% of
unsafe

&gt;&gt;endangering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anyone's life. Bad drivers are and they are equally distributed among
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;full range of vehicles on our roads, from SUVs to compacts to
classics.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But our cars and our roads have been engineered to protect occupants
&gt;&gt;&gt; in car collisions. Two cars colliding together are much less likely
&gt;&gt;&gt; to produce injuries than an SUV and a car or even two SUVs. This is
&gt;&gt;&gt; due to bumper/frame alignment and the use of unibody construction.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The incompatibilities are not all to the benefit of the SUV driver.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The guard rail that safely guides a car to a stop will flip an SUV
&gt;&gt;&gt; when it catches a wheel. Or the SUV may just crash through it. SUVs
&gt;&gt;&gt; are far worse handling, require greater avoidance space and are prone
&gt;&gt;&gt; to flipping. The impair the vision of car drivers to a greater extent
&gt;&gt;&gt; than they improve the vision of their own drivers.

&gt;&gt;All these accident situations you describe can easily be prevented with
safe
&gt;&gt;driving. There's an inherent risk in driving any vehicle, if you don't
want
&gt;&gt;to take that risk then take a bus, walk or bike.

&gt; Then lets put a high explosive charge in every vehicle rigged to blow
&gt; up all the passengers upon any impact greater than 10 mph? After all,
&gt; can easily be prevented with safe driving and there's an inherent risk
&gt; in driving any vehicle. Or does it perhaps make more sense to design
&gt; the vehicles to protect the occupants in the inevitable accidents
&gt; without posing undue risks to other drivers? This is not some
&gt; futuristic, pie-the-sky proposal. Those cars are on the road now.
&gt; But their safety systems are rendered largely ineffective when they
&gt; are hit by an overweight, overheight, stiff-frame monster truck.

"/> Okay, so what do you propose we ought to do to better protect the occupants
of _all_ vehicles (including SUVs) in crashes?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;I personally think SUVs have horrid visibility, they are just like
minivans
&gt;&gt;in that respect. Go look at some cars with bad visibility. How about
early
&gt;&gt;Mustang fastbacks? Not the best visibility at all. Anyway, if you are
&gt;&gt;complaining about blocking other people's visibility that's just a
&gt;&gt;nonsensical argument. If you are following that close to SUVs that your
&gt;&gt;visibility is hindered that much then what you are doing is called
&gt;&gt;tailgating and is part of unsafe driving.

&gt;&gt;Just fall back to a safe following
&gt;&gt;distance and you will be fine. What constitutes a safe following distance
is
&gt;&gt;not just being able to stop and react quickly enough, but being able to
see.

&gt; That's OK if you are following one on a country highway, but in rush
&gt; hour traffic you can't stay 50 feet away from every SUV in the city.
&gt; The vision thing is not just a problem when you are following an SUV
&gt; but anytime one is near, even if it is parked. And if everyone tries
&gt; to keep as much space as necessary between them and the SUVs, road use
&gt; efficiency would plummet and traffic would snarl.

"/> What can I tell you, stop bitching and get used to it. If you can't adapt to
a couple taller vehicles disrupting your visibility then you shouldn't be
driving. Trucks are everywhere, get used to it or get off the roads, as you
are a hazard to everyone else on them if you can't handle driving when
trucks are around.

Your 'arguments' are getting more nonsensical as this thread goes on, so
please, start to make some sense, because at this point I'm just humoring
myself by responding.

and gets very little driving but is in mint condition (I took it for a 4x4 spin in

avoidance, but at low speeds and parking lot type places you want torque to

93 Geo Prizm has gotten in 4 or 5 accidents I believe. I have only gotten
into one, and I wasn't even moving at the time. He was rear ended once, hit
a deer another time, and twice lost control in bad weather. My girlfriends
father who drives a 93 Toyota Camry &quot;wagon&quot; lost control of the car in snow
a month ago and slammed into a guard rail. I've driven the 67 through worse
snow quite a few times and never had any trouble. I guess that may have more
to do with the vehicles weight aiding in a better grip, or perhaps I just
drive more safely in bad weather.

To top it off, there have been more than a few times in which I woulda
slammed into someone making a stupid move or gotten hit by an inattentive
twit. I attribute my not being a parapalegic to that car's great brakes
(replaced everything in the brake system when I got it), as well as to it's
quick revving 289 which has the torque to move the car quickly out of
danger. What I can say is that had I been driving my dads Geo I can think of
at least one time where I woulda been in an accident in which I would have
been hit in the side from someone quickly pulling out across two lanes
without looking first.

What I am saying is that a car with a bigger engine is inherently safer that
one with a small 4 cyl. I'm not talking about performance 4 cyl engines
(LOL, performance 4 cyl... anyway...), but comparing a typical 4 cyl with a
typical 8 cyl (260-390) the 8 cyl will get a car moving faster than a 4 cyl.
I value that torque since parking lots are the most dangerous thing since
sliced bread (in my opinion), and I prefer to be able to both stop and get
out of people's way quickly. Both of which my 67 Gal does better than my
dad's Prizm.

I have the same problem, but I've gotten used to it. It probably affect me
even more than most since the hood on my car is about 5 feet long, and the
whole car is about 20 feet long. This is one of the reasons I say parking
lots are one of the most dangerous places. I have a hard time seeing over
SUVs and trucks in parking lots, just like most people, but I don't bitch
and whine about it, saying we ought to get rid of them. Nor do I express a
disgusting prejudice against the people who drive these vehicles.

What I usually do in parking lots in situations like you decribe is to try
to peer thorugh the windows or around it to see if something is coming.
Usually I can see if something is coming from fartehr away and decide when
to pull out from there. I will pull out _very_ slowly if I'm not 100% sure
it's clear so anyone coming will see me. This gives them a chance to honk
and alert me that they are coming, or stop if they chose to let me go. I
don't recall having that problem too often normally, it happens more often
if I back into a spot or pull through a spot so I'm forward facing to drive
straight out. Maybe it's just a coincidence, or maybe I just have better
visibility to the rear or can see around the truck better when I'm more
forward on it.

I personally have no trouble seeing over and around them on the road, but my
cars sit higher than msot modern cars. When I drove my dads Geo up to Maine
(I'll never do that again, felt unsafe and my ass and back hurt after only
an hour) I had a harder time seeing around SUVs and trucks, but it wasn't a
big deal. I was just attentive and kept my following distances appropriate.

The compact car drivers are just as guilty of not carpooling, or not making
the most efficient routes, or whatever you want to blame on SUV owners. The
fact that the SUV gets half the mileage of the compact is not the issue,
it's what the driver is doing with their choice of vehicle to use the least
gas as is practical. So it's exactly like you say, there is no comparison,
since we are not comparing mileage, but things a person does to reduce the
amount of driving that is done (or miles traveled). Carpooling and planning
routes are great ways to do that, and simply relaxing your driving behavior
will greatly reduce the amount of fuel used... I always wonder why everyone
is in such a hurry to get to a red light.

Mileage of a person's choice of vehicle, once again, is not the issue. It is
not moral to restrict what vehicles a person can buy. If I want a certain
vehicle I'll get it so long as I can afford it. Then if that vehicle is my
daily driver I'll drive it the same as I would any other daily driver. That
is to say relaxed, not uptight racing to red lights and flooring it off
every light. I don't even think about fuel economy in my driving habits, I
just sit back and relax... Ya know, just cruise along and enjoy the drive.

&gt;If you have proper gearing that 50 RPM with 500 ft-lb will move the car just

lower speed, you have even less. Gear it any way you want, but please

&gt; A lot
&gt;of it depends on gearing vs the weaight of the car vs the engines ability to

&gt;Well if you're looking at high speed accident avoidance then perhaps the
&gt;Honda may have an edge, but getting out of the way of things at low speeds I
&gt;think the Galaxie would have the advantage. At higher speeds the suspension
&gt;and weight of car would usually play a more significant role in accident
&gt;avoidance, but at low speeds and parking lot type places you want torque to
&gt;get the car out of the way quickly.

"/> You can always construct a scenario where a vehicle with inferior

&gt;&gt;&gt;endangering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anyone's life. Bad drivers are and they are equally distributed among
&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;full range of vehicles on our roads, from SUVs to compacts to
&gt;classics.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But our cars and our roads have been engineered to protect occupants
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in car collisions. Two cars colliding together are much less likely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to produce injuries than an SUV and a car or even two SUVs. This is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; due to bumper/frame alignment and the use of unibody construction.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The incompatibilities are not all to the benefit of the SUV driver.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The guard rail that safely guides a car to a stop will flip an SUV
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when it catches a wheel. Or the SUV may just crash through it. SUVs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are far worse handling, require greater avoidance space and are prone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to flipping. The impair the vision of car drivers to a greater extent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than they improve the vision of their own drivers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;All these accident situations you describe can easily be prevented with
&gt;safe
&gt;&gt;&gt;driving. There's an inherent risk in driving any vehicle, if you don't
&gt;want
&gt;&gt;&gt;to take that risk then take a bus, walk or bike.

&gt;&gt; Then lets put a high explosive charge in every vehicle rigged to blow
&gt;&gt; up all the passengers upon any impact greater than 10 mph? After all,
&gt;&gt; can easily be prevented with safe driving and there's an inherent risk
&gt;&gt; in driving any vehicle. Or does it perhaps make more sense to design
&gt;&gt; the vehicles to protect the occupants in the inevitable accidents
&gt;&gt; without posing undue risks to other drivers? This is not some
&gt;&gt; futuristic, pie-the-sky proposal. Those cars are on the road now.
&gt;&gt; But their safety systems are rendered largely ineffective when they
&gt;&gt; are hit by an overweight, overheight, stiff-frame monster truck.

&gt;Okay, so what do you propose we ought to do to better protect the occupants
&gt;of _all_ vehicles (including SUVs) in crashes?

"/> There is no way to make the traditional SUV safe. The only way to
improve safety is to reduce the number of them on the road.

&gt;&gt;&gt;complaining about blocking other people's visibility that's just a
&gt;&gt;&gt;nonsensical argument. If you are following that close to SUVs that your
&gt;&gt;&gt;visibility is hindered that much then what you are doing is called
&gt;&gt;&gt;tailgating and is part of unsafe driving.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Just fall back to a safe following
&gt;&gt;&gt;distance and you will be fine. What constitutes a safe following distance
&gt;is
&gt;&gt;&gt;not just being able to stop and react quickly enough, but being able to
&gt;see.

&gt;&gt; That's OK if you are following one on a country highway, but in rush
&gt;&gt; hour traffic you can't stay 50 feet away from every SUV in the city.
&gt;&gt; The vision thing is not just a problem when you are following an SUV
&gt;&gt; but anytime one is near, even if it is parked. And if everyone tries
&gt;&gt; to keep as much space as necessary between them and the SUVs, road use
&gt;&gt; efficiency would plummet and traffic would snarl.

Here's my reason for disliking big, gas-gulping, SUVs. Aside from their
ghastly inefficiency, they are dangerous. Most people driving these things
should NOT be doing so. They think they are still in a car b/c it's such a
nice vehicle w/ leather interior etc. etc. I was stopped at a red light
behind several cars and a big 4SS SUV (suburban) rear ended me, totaling my
civic, and pushing me into the car in front of me. Granted, if she were a
safe driver this would not have happened, but accidents DO happen. If she
were in a car and not a TANK, then my car would not have been totaled. If
people insist on driving these beasts around town, then they should be taxed
like H3LL and they should be required to have a commercial drivers license,
so that MAYBE they will be more aware of the limits of their vehicles.

Why do you assume large SUV's are dangerous? According the NHTSA
stasticts the injury and death rate for children has
fallen dramatically over the past five years. Teh reduction is
attributed to that fact that a greater percentage of children are
getting out of small cars and riding in the larger SUV's

YES! But what about those of us who don't/can't/don't want to - own an
SUV!!!
The SUV fanatics are forcing borderline buyers to go bigger and bigger for

nice try on using logic.
but the mass of the truck absorbs more energy than the
mass of the car, hense minimal damage to the truck.

so yes, if you had a tank you could go about your business

Who ever originally posted this is just giving a small example
of the wrongs of the US.

in particular he's tackling the environment. but car polution is
a very small percentage of the overall polution and resource
consumption. if you wanna make a difference you would need
to change you whole life-style and the foundation of the entire
country.

the US(pop 290M) is 2nd only to china(pop 1.3B) in consumption and
pollution. keep in mind china is in the middle of industrization, like the
US was 50-100 years ago and before major standards.

sure smaller cars help...as does: less a/c, no air travel, fewer electrical
appliances, fewer factories.

before you attack the SUV drivers...attack yourself.

one last point: the A/C in a 4 banger decreases the engine efficiency
to the level of a small V8. should they be forced from the compact
line to the SUV line at the pump, as you proposed???

american comfort and convenience comes at a price that the world must pay.

&gt; Is It Moral to Drive a Gas-Guzzling Vehicle?

&gt; By Your Voices
&gt; Sunday, February 2, 2003; Page C11

&gt; I agree with religious leaders who say it is morally
&gt; irresponsible to drive an SUV. There are at least three moral
&gt; issues here: failure to steward the Earth's resources, greed in
&gt; taking a far larger share of these resources than is equitable,
&gt; and failure to consider or care about the potential physical
&gt; harm to others from such a large, heavy, and higher vehicle.

&gt; In several places in the Bible, we are told to be stewards of
&gt; the Earth. Despoiling it with oil rigs and squandering its
&gt; resources is not stewardship. We are all guilty, but SUV
&gt; drivers more so because of the SUV's lousy gas mileage.

&gt; -- Anne Ambler, Silver Spring

&gt; More reader's responses at:
&gt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7332-2003Jan31.html
&gt; ==============

&gt; I believe people who drive larger, gas guzzlers should be
&gt; made to pay higher prices for gasoline.

&gt; Each gas station should have three lines - one for compact
&gt; cars, one for medium sized cars and one for SUV's.

&gt; Compact: $1.00 per gallon
&gt; Medium: $1.75 per gallon
&gt; SUV's: $2.50 per gallon

&gt; And enjoy your expensive ride. Quit robbing our natural resources.

&gt;&gt;Not necessarily true. Any energy that doesn't go into deforming sheet
&gt;&gt;metal on the vehicle is energy that's transmitted to the occupants.
&gt;&gt;That's why &quot;I hit something and the truck was hardly damaged&quot; is not a
&gt;&gt;good argument for the safety of a truck. In an accident you want to
&gt;&gt;spread out the deceleration as long as possible, and that means letting
&gt;&gt;the vehicle crumple and deform.

&gt;Or let the other vehicle absorb the energy - which sounds like it
&gt;might have been the case here. Hitting a brick wall, I'd tend to
&gt;agree with you.

&gt;&gt;BTW, I've found modern pickups and SUVs to have terribly fragile
&gt;&gt;bumpers. This isn't surprising considering there's no government
&gt;&gt;standard for them. I once did $900 worth of damage to a Ford truck's
&gt;&gt;bumper by backing into it with a Crown Victoria. The damage to the
&gt;&gt;Crown Vic was limited to a smashed tail light.

&gt;So which is it - are they too sturdy, or too fragile? You seem
&gt;determined to criticize it for both.

The bumpers of at least some trucks are too flimsy. I once backed

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;actions on our roads. The fact of the matter is that SUVs aren't

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anyone's life. Bad drivers are and they are equally distributed
among
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;full range of vehicles on our roads, from SUVs to compacts to
&gt;&gt;classics.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But our cars and our roads have been engineered to protect occupants
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in car collisions. Two cars colliding together are much less likely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to produce injuries than an SUV and a car or even two SUVs. This is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; due to bumper/frame alignment and the use of unibody construction.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The incompatibilities are not all to the benefit of the SUV driver.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The guard rail that safely guides a car to a stop will flip an SUV
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when it catches a wheel. Or the SUV may just crash through it.
SUVs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are far worse handling, require greater avoidance space and are
prone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to flipping. The impair the vision of car drivers to a greater
extent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than they improve the vision of their own drivers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All these accident situations you describe can easily be prevented
with
&gt;&gt;safe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;driving. There's an inherent risk in driving any vehicle, if you don't
&gt;&gt;want
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to take that risk then take a bus, walk or bike.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then lets put a high explosive charge in every vehicle rigged to blow
&gt;&gt;&gt; up all the passengers upon any impact greater than 10 mph? After all,
&gt;&gt;&gt; can easily be prevented with safe driving and there's an inherent risk
&gt;&gt;&gt; in driving any vehicle. Or does it perhaps make more sense to design
&gt;&gt;&gt; the vehicles to protect the occupants in the inevitable accidents
&gt;&gt;&gt; without posing undue risks to other drivers? This is not some
&gt;&gt;&gt; futuristic, pie-the-sky proposal. Those cars are on the road now.
&gt;&gt;&gt; But their safety systems are rendered largely ineffective when they
&gt;&gt;&gt; are hit by an overweight, overheight, stiff-frame monster truck.

&gt;&gt;Okay, so what do you propose we ought to do to better protect the
occupants
&gt;&gt;of _all_ vehicles (including SUVs) in crashes?

&gt; There is no way to make the traditional SUV safe. The only way to
&gt; improve safety is to reduce the number of them on the road.

"/> I can just as easily say the same thng about cars, can't be made safe, only
by reducing the number on the road can safety be improved. So far you've
given no logical reason for singling out teh SUV, it's just your opinion to
pick on the SUV as opposed to teh car.

&gt; The newer crossover vehicles are a step in the right direction. If
&gt; further lowered to align with car bumpers, they would probably be
&gt; acceptable. Whether anyone would want them or think they were &quot;real
&gt; SUVs&quot; is another issue.

"/> Well that's the beauty of America. You can buy whatever car you want and not
be restricted by eco-nuts or safety-nuts. The key to safe cars is not so
much preparing them for crash survivability but doing more to make the cars
capable of avoiding a crash. Bigger engines, better brakes, better
suspensions, etc...

I would personally rather drive a car with good power, strong brakes and a
solid suspension coupled with good visibility. My Galaxies fit that bill,
except the 67's suspension is loose and worn. Either way, I feel safer in
either the 67 or 68 than I do in most other cars I've driven. That is even
without shoulder belts or a collapsible steering column in the 67. It's all
about crash avoidability. In the event of a crash you can easily place the
blame on of bodily injury on either vehicle (ignoring which driver is at
fault), claiming one of the vehicles didn't conform to the other enough to
be safe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I personally think SUVs have horrid visibility, they are just like
&gt;&gt;minivans
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in that respect. Go look at some cars with bad visibility. How about
&gt;&gt;early
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Mustang fastbacks? Not the best visibility at all. Anyway, if you are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;complaining about blocking other people's visibility that's just a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;nonsensical argument. If you are following that close to SUVs that
your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;visibility is hindered that much then what you are doing is called
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tailgating and is part of unsafe driving.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just fall back to a safe following
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;distance and you will be fine. What constitutes a safe following
distance
&gt;&gt;is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not just being able to stop and react quickly enough, but being able
to
&gt;&gt;see.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's OK if you are following one on a country highway, but in rush
&gt;&gt;&gt; hour traffic you can't stay 50 feet away from every SUV in the city.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The vision thing is not just a problem when you are following an SUV
&gt;&gt;&gt; but anytime one is near, even if it is parked. And if everyone tries
&gt;&gt;&gt; to keep as much space as necessary between them and the SUVs, road use
&gt;&gt;&gt; efficiency would plummet and traffic would snarl.

&gt;&gt;What can I tell you, stop bitching and get used to it. If you can't adapt
to
&gt;&gt;a couple taller vehicles disrupting your visibility then you shouldn't be
&gt;&gt;driving.

&gt; Sure, let's all just evolve X-Ray vision. One adaptation I have
&gt; developed is that I don't let them in front of me if I can help it.
&gt; This requires some tailgating but it makes me feel safe.

"/> Alright troll. You admit to tailgating, which isn't so bad in and of itself,
because you can modify your behavior without much trouble. The thing that
peeves me is that you say you tailgate because it makes you feel safer. How
safe will you feel when the driver in front of you slams his brakes to avoid
hitting a car that cut him off (trying to get in front of him like you do to
SUVs), and you can't stop as fast or avoid him since you are blocked in? I
don't imagine you'll feel too safe when you are testing your vehicles crash
survivability.

Galaxie 500 (289) to standard 4 cyl road cars. An S2000 is not your run of
the mill 4 cyl car, though it's just as much a fruity car in my not so
humble opinion. Either way, my 67 Galaxie was a good standard of performance
way back when, and standard (i.e. run of the mill 4 or 6 cyl car on the
road)modern cars just don't have the same power. It's all about crash
avoidance. Obviously a high performance car built with autocross in mind is
going to outperform a 67 full-size Ford in autocross. A good torquey V8 can
get you going, but it takes a lot more than that for autocross type stuff.

&gt; fallen dramatically over the past five years. Teh reduction is
&gt; attributed to that fact that a greater percentage of children are
&gt; getting out of small cars and riding in the larger SUV's

"/> Mike, as the poster said, the increased danger is not to the person
driving the large SUV or his passengers. It's to the people walking or
riding in smaller vehicles that the SUV driver *hits*. Obviously a
large vehicle can do a lot more damage than a small one as in his
example.

&gt;most accidents happen at low speeds (in and around parking lots being a
&gt;chief hazard). I'm also stressing crash avoidance. I was comparing my 67
&gt;Galaxie 500 (289) to standard 4 cyl road cars. An S2000 is not your run of
&gt;the mill 4 cyl car, though it's just as much a fruity car in my not so
&gt;humble opinion. Either way, my 67 Galaxie was a good standard of performance
&gt;way back when, and standard (i.e. run of the mill 4 or 6 cyl car on the
&gt;road)modern cars just don't have the same power. It's all about crash
&gt;avoidance. Obviously a high performance car built with autocross in mind is
&gt;going to outperform a 67 full-size Ford in autocross. A good torquey V8 can
&gt;get you going, but it takes a lot more than that for autocross type stuff.

Before going any further let me repeat from my first post in this series:
&quot;If you threw away the pollution &quot;correction&quot;
devices, and I'm not saying one should....&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Take the BTCC racing Civic Type R, which gets up to
&gt;&gt;290bhp(restricted by regs) from its 2L, detune it for road use and what do
&gt;&gt;you think it'd get?... more than 200bhp!

&gt;How many hundred thousand miles do they get out of that racing engine?
&gt;How is the Fuel economy? How does it idle?

"/> You really should get some facts before pulling your trigger. The BTCC
engines are production blocks and there are penalties for changing engines
during the course of a season. If one took a stock Civic and ran it on
red-line indefinitely do you think it would last 100s of thousands of
miles? As for fuel economy and idling, I guess you missed &quot;detune for road
use&quot;... or you are not aware of what that entails.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Obviously, a 2L engine can be tuned to a wide range of hp and still
&gt;&gt;&gt;meet emissions standards. For a given hp, the necessity to meet
&gt;&gt;&gt;emissions regs presumably costs some fuel efficiency, if for no other
&gt;&gt;&gt;reason than having to pull the extra weight of a catalytic convertor.
&gt;&gt;&gt;How severe is that mpg penalty? Pretty hard to say, but I don't think
&gt;&gt;&gt;it is too much at this point. For one thing, the interests of not
&gt;&gt;&gt;destroying the engine will limit how close you are going to get to
&gt;&gt;&gt;perfect stoichiometry. IOW, you will always want to be a little on
&gt;&gt;&gt;the rich side, which works well with a catalytic convertor.

&gt;&gt;Oh it's more than the weight of the converter and the penalty *is*
&gt;&gt;substantial.

&gt;How do you know this?

"/>&lt;gasp&gt; How do you know different? Just look at the numbers: in 2k thru
2002 Honda lost 5bhp with its SULEV system compared with the same LEV
engine... with the only visible difference being a different catalytic
converter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Keeping peak RPMs in the same ballpark, even if you only
&gt;&gt;boost the compession ratio a touch - IOW keep a road-drivable system - the
&gt;&gt;optimized redesign of the induction, combustion control and exhaust systems
&gt;&gt;will bring the numbers I'm talking about.

&gt;&gt;With the current talk of NASCAR, and maybe other racing series, being on
&gt;&gt;the brink of implementing emission controls, to combat CO poisoning, we
&gt;&gt;*may* even get to hear some revised numbers for racing engines.

&gt;Haven't heard about the CO problem. It would explain a lot about
&gt;NASCAR fans ;]

&gt;Seriously, we were talking about fuel efficiency. Any car spewing
&gt;copious CO is obviously not being tuned for economy.

"/> Go back to combustion engineering school. Carbon conversion efficiency is
only very loosely related to combustion power efficiency.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My assertion is
&gt;that you can tune a (road car) engine to a wide range of performance

&gt;drivability, durability, etc. Yes, there is some theoretical loss of
&gt;fuel efficiency when tuned for emissions. Citing horsepower output of
&gt;race engines does not prove it is significant.

"/> You seem to have changed your assertion then. The fact is that EGR reduces
burn efficiency and a catalytic converter restricts flow - both lower power
and fuel efficiency directly and both require compromises in engine system
design which further reduce both. There is nothing theoretical about the
losses.

entirely stock and feels it. It's a slug compared to the 67's performance.

standard Mustang no problem in the 67, Mustang GT is about even. As far as
handling and stopping power I'm sure eitehr Mustang would stomp my Galaxies.
My point is that compared to a typical mid-sized car on the roads today my
Galaxies outperform them in acceleration (which brings safety), braking is
about the same under most conditions, and the suspension is a bit less tight
(on the 68, which has new shocks). Both cars have 4 wheel drums, but they
are never a problem except when doing repeated quick stops from _very_ high
speeds. This has never been a problem when normally driving, or when I've
had to maneuver to avoid an accident. Obviously a full-size car from the

&gt; crowd. BTW, I don't see how this fits the definition of trolling.

"/> Not quite trolling, but close to it when you come to a driving newsgroup and
boast of tailgating because you feel it's safer. Driving a SUV isn't any
more or less safe than driving a road car for normal driving. It is not
inherantly less safe, so you are coming totally from left field on this one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; How
&gt;&gt;safe will you feel when the driver in front of you slams his brakes to
avoid
&gt;&gt;hitting a car that cut him off (trying to get in front of him like you do
to
&gt;&gt;SUVs), and you can't stop as fast or avoid him since you are blocked in?
I
&gt;&gt;don't imagine you'll feel too safe when you are testing your vehicles
crash
&gt;&gt;survivability.

&gt; Well, I don't tailgate in the parking lot so it must be safe.

"/> Ha. Ha. Eitehr way, tailgating at any speed is unsafe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Trucks are everywhere, get used to it or get off the roads, as you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are a hazard to everyone else on them if you can't handle driving when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;trucks are around.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Trucks are a hazard. If they are moving freight or serving heavy
&gt;&gt;&gt; labor then they are a necessary evil. Allowing more on the road for
&gt;&gt;&gt; the sake of fashion or selfish interest is foolish. There is no
&gt;&gt;&gt; satisfactory way to adapt to it, there are only compromises.

&gt;&gt;I could jsut as easily say small cars are a hazard by your logic
(assuming
&gt;&gt;accidents are unavoidable). A hazard to our health, by being more
vulnerable
&gt;&gt;in a crash.

&gt; Modern small cars do very well in collisions even with much larger
&gt; cars. It is the non-conforming trucks that are most dangerous and the
&gt; size of your car isn't much help. Even being in another SUV may not
&gt; protect you.

"/> It all depends on the circumstances of an accident. But again, I'm not
talking about crash survivability. I'm talkin about avoiding accidents.
Better driving is the way to do it, but cars that perform better are a good
step supporting it. I would never want to drive a SUV daily for that reason,
they don't handle anywhere near what a car does. Most have more power and
acceleration than a typical car, but it's not much good for crash avoidance
as the thing is so top heavy.

don't really care as they are more of a standard road vehicle. The same

the left lane with a matress tied to your roof.

These people aren't making their car buying decisions based on the
environment, and you can't force them to. There's nothing wrong with getting
an inefficient vehicle if you want it. It's not like these people say
&quot;Hmm... Which car gets the worst possible mileage?&quot;. They simply pick the
car they want and can afford. From there it is their responsibility to not
use an excess of gas more than what is needed.

The fact of the matter is that we are not all eco-nuts. I am not an eco-nut
by any stretch of the imagination. But within my lifestyle I do whatever I
can for the environment. I'll turn the heat down when I'm not home, and when
I'm home I'll turn it off in rooms I don't use. I conserve electricity and
buy appliances that use less energy (often energy star certified). I'll turn
things off when not using them. It's the same thing as when I drive the car
of my choice, for normal driving I don't use it any more than needed and
drive lightly.

When I go out in nice weather for a cruise I'll occasionally stomp on it and
play a little. Using that gas for recreation in my car it's no different
than riding a dirt bike, or watching TV, or going to the movies. They all
use energy and pollute. It's just my choice of what I want to do to enjoy
myself in my free time. I believe I'm more responsible than a lot of people
when it comes to the environment, but a lot of people are better than me. I
don't really care, I commend them for being more environmentally conscious,
but going crazy on it doesn't suit my lifestyle. No one can force it upon
me, I'll do what I'm comfortable doing within my lifestyle but that's it. If
you have suggestions, I'm open to them, but again, if it doesn't fit my
life, I won't do it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not that it has anything to do with the discussion at hand but

&gt;&gt;&gt; at what rpm - and I can accelerate a car quickly. OTOH an engine that
&gt;&gt;&gt; makes 500 ft-lb of torque won't do crap if it redlines at 50 rpm.

&gt;&gt;If you have proper gearing that 50 RPM with 500 ft-lb will move the car
just
&gt;&gt;fine. With a normal 3.00:1 rear and normal tranny gears the car won't
move
&gt;&gt;much anywhere.

&gt; Bzzzzt. Oh, I'm sorry. The correct answer is a top speed of maybe 15
&gt; mph and it will take a minute or two to get there. If the 500 ft-lbs
&gt; is right at 50 rpm, you have less than 5hp. If peak torque is at some
&gt; lower speed, you have even less. Gear it any way you want, but please
&gt; keep it off the road.

"/> I find that hard to believe. You just need to have enough gears to keep the

gears, little horsepower, and gobs of torque.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Furthermore, it does not matter where the torque peak is, but what the
&gt;&gt;&gt; hp is at the current rpm. That Honda engine will always be running
&gt;&gt;&gt; faster than your Galaxie 500 (except at idle), so comparing torque/hp
&gt;&gt;&gt; at any given rpm is misleading.

&gt;&gt;Actually my Gal probably runs at a higher RPM a good bit of the time as
no
&gt;&gt;doubt the Honda has overdrive or at elast a lockup torque converter.

&gt; If we are still talking about the S2000, it certainly doesn't have a
&gt; lockup torque converter. In top gear it probably runs 3000rpm at 60
&gt; mph. What does your Galaxie turn at that speed?

"/> I don't know what the obsession is with that S2000, but no, I was not
referring to the S2000. My Galaxie with a 289 is _not_ by any means a
perforamnce car. It's a normal road car. Comparing it to other normal road
cars (or modern vintage), it will turn more RPM at a given speed in lots of
scenarios.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; A lot
&gt;&gt;of it depends on gearing vs the weaight of the car vs the engines ability
to
&gt;&gt;rev quickly. The 289 in my 67 _loves_ to rev, it's pretty fun to drive
&gt;&gt;because of that.

&gt; The S2000 goes from idle to 9000+ rpm in about two seconds in first
&gt; gear.

"/> I'm sure a perforamnce car like that is geared quite high. I'm talking about
road cars, designed to be practical transportation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; For a light car with a good transmission and a skilled, attentive

&gt;&gt;&gt; avoid accidents better than a Galaxie 500.

&gt;&gt;Well if you're looking at high speed accident avoidance then perhaps the
&gt;&gt;Honda may have an edge, but getting out of the way of things at low
speeds I
&gt;&gt;think the Galaxie would have the advantage. At higher speeds the
suspension
&gt;&gt;and weight of car would usually play a more significant role in accident
&gt;&gt;avoidance, but at low speeds and parking lot type places you want torque
to
&gt;&gt;get the car out of the way quickly.

&gt; You can always construct a scenario where a vehicle with inferior
&gt; overall performance would have an advantage. It appears you have done
&gt; so in this case. When most people talk about accident avoidance they
&gt; are not thinking about parking lots.

"/> I'm not talking solely about in and around parking lots, but also at speed,
where I have had to both accelerate and brake quickly to avoid accidents. I
was jsut coming up with a more specific example. At higher speeds the
average suspension on your typical rice-mobile will be better if nothing
else due to the fact that the Honda has a good 1,000 lb advantage.

&gt;&gt; Unfortunately when I was struck in the

&gt;&gt;crossing the street in front of me, a car to my left and a car behind me.
&gt;&gt;All the torque in the world won't do any good when you can't get out of
the
&gt;&gt;way.

&gt;&gt;Speaking of avoiding accidents... In the past year or so my dad who
drives a
&gt;&gt;93 Geo Prizm has gotten in 4 or 5 accidents I believe. I have only gotten
&gt;&gt;into one, and I wasn't even moving at the time. He was rear ended once,
hit
&gt;&gt;a deer another time, and twice lost control in bad weather. My
girlfriends
&gt;&gt;father who drives a 93 Toyota Camry &quot;wagon&quot; lost control of the car in
snow
&gt;&gt;a month ago and slammed into a guard rail. I've driven the 67 through
worse
&gt;&gt;snow quite a few times and never had any trouble. I guess that may have
more
&gt;&gt;to do with the vehicles weight aiding in a better grip, or perhaps I just
&gt;&gt;drive more safely in bad weather.

&gt; I suspect it is the latter and a little luck. In driving light weight
&gt; FWD vehicles I have only had one accident in the last 19 years. I was
&gt; rear ended at a stop light. The guy in front of me heard the
&gt; squealing wheels and blew the light to get out of the way so I wasn't
&gt; pushed into him. He didn't have a 4 cylinder engine, he had a 2
&gt; cylinder engine. Anecdotal evidence isn't worth much.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;To top it off, there have been more than a few times in which I woulda
&gt;&gt;slammed into someone making a stupid move or gotten hit by an inattentive
&gt;&gt;twit. I attribute my not being a parapalegic to that car's great brakes
&gt;&gt;(replaced everything in the brake system when I got it),

&gt; So you think your Galaxie 500 can out-brake an S2000?

"/> No, again, I am not comparing my Galaxie to an S2000. They are completely
different cars designed for completely different roles.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; as well as to it's
&gt;&gt;quick revving 289 which has the torque to move the car quickly out of
&gt;&gt;danger.

&gt; As well as out-accelerate one?

"/> Like I said, an S2000 is not a typical road car. My Galaxie is (or was at
one point in time), I make no claims to out-accelerate a car designed for
race or autocross, simply that a modern typical road car in most cases does
not have the same acceleration as either of my cars. You see, my car and a
typical mid-full sized sedan have something in common, they were designed to
move people. They weren't designed as toys, that's what 427's are for.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; What I can say is that had I been driving my dads Geo I can think of
&gt;&gt;at least one time where I woulda been in an accident in which I would
have
&gt;&gt;been hit in the side from someone quickly pulling out across two lanes
&gt;&gt;without looking first.

&gt; And that Geo performance somehow compares to an S2000?

"/> I don't understand why you keep thinking I'm comparing everything to an
S2000. If you ask me you're a bit obsessive over this car. A Geo Prizm is a
typical road car. It's a compact sedan. I see several of Geo Prizms and
Toyota Camrys every day on my commute. I have yet to see a single S2000. A
stock small block 67 or 68 Galaxie has nothing in common with a S2000, it
does have something in common with a Geo. That is that they are both
passenger cars designed for normal road use.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;What I am saying is that a car with a bigger engine is inherently safer
that
&gt;&gt;one with a small 4 cyl. I'm not talking about performance 4 cyl engines
&gt;&gt;(LOL, performance 4 cyl... anyway...),

&gt; And that 0-60 times in the 5 second range is not performance?

"/> Sure it is, it just makes me laugh when I think of a 4 cly torqueless wonder
having performance. It's plenty possible though with all this modern
technology and a lightweight car. Put that S2000 engine in my Galaxie and
I'd be surprised if it could move the car.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Safety is a package, not just a torque curve. Active safety (accident
&gt; avoidance) of your G 500 cannot compare to an S2000 or probably any
&gt; modern car (unless you have heavily modified it and even then...) My
&gt; non-Japanese car is a '92 Volvo wagon with a 2.3L engine. Certainly
&gt; doesn't out-run much but it was statistically the safest car on the
&gt; road when I bought. Like I said, it's a package.

"/> Here I will agree with you. I definitely feel safety is a package. It
consists of both performance (power, braking, suspension...) and safety
features in the event of a crash (shoulder belts, collapsible steering
column, air bags, head restraints...). Again, my Gals don't compare to an
S200 in that respect, and the 67 doesn't even compare to a modern car. The
68 though, with shoulder belts and a collapsible steering column, compares

But still, in the event of a crash I would think in most cases I'd be safer
in the Geo Prizm. My dad walking away from 4-5 accidents without a scratch
on him is a pretty good testament to it's safety. Though if that car got
struck by something big, I sure as hell would rather be in the 68 Gal,
though I'm not so sure I'd want to be in the 67 (no shoulder belts of
collapsible steering column).

"/> Well here you get into the issue of accidents while people are playing vs
accidents while people commuting. I know a lot of people who go to far in
how they play with their cars. The most I ever do is a simple 0-60 (or speed
limit) race off of a stop light. I'm done after that. People just plain
driving unsafely are going to have a higher accident rate no matter what you
do.

After a certain point in torque (relative to gearing) the car will become
unsafe to drive in adverse weather, as it won't be able to get any grip on
the road to accelerate. That is the point at which a car with more power
becomes less safe (in adverse weather at least).

buy the bigger car. That IS what you said. I merely pointed out that if

&gt;&gt;and failure to consider or care about the potential physical

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Statistically, the average SUV owner and the average econo car owner are the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;same... this is assuming a large sample pool (which we have in the US)...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So, on average, SUV drivers are doing more harm to the environment than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;econo car drivers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As a group, it's the econo-car drivers who are doing more harm - they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;outnumber the SUV's by about twenty-to-one.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That is simply untrue for the US market. Look at 2002 sales. Small
&gt;&gt;&gt;cars were a little over 13% of total sales. Mid sized SUVs were
&gt;&gt;&gt;11.6%.

&gt;&gt;Sorry, your numbers fail the common-sense test of just looking at
&gt;&gt;what's on the road. What I see is that SUV's of all types are in fact
&gt;&gt;about 1 out of 20 vehicles, and people here are very big on SUV's
&gt;&gt;compared to most cities.

&gt;Sorry, but you said economy cars outnumber SUVs by &quot;about
&gt;twenty-to-one.&quot; You did not say, &quot;All other vehicles combined
&gt;outnumber SUVs by nineteen to one.&quot;

"/> Gotta watch 'em when you get 'em cornered - they turn on you and
quibble you to death...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Large SUVs accounted for 5.24%. Granted that this only
&gt;&gt;&gt;reflects what was sold last year, not what is on the road, but clearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;the twenty-to-one figure is way off base.

&gt;&gt;Not that I was talking only of large SUV's, but 5.24% is roughly one
&gt;&gt;out of 20...

&gt;And this would be relevant how? SUVs (counting only mid-size and
&gt;larger, not CRVs) outsold economy cars by 30%. If you like, I will
&gt;send you the spread sheet detailing all sales of every make and model.
&gt;Or you can just trust me. In case you haven't heard the news, light
&gt;trucks now outsell cars in the US.

"/> We've already been through this. Sales figures say nothing about how
much those vehicles are being driven or what steps the drivers may be
taking to offset the effects of lower gas mileage by, for example,
driving less, carpooling more, or buying a cheap small car for around
town so as to extend the life of their expensive SUV.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Even if it were true, it is still hard to argue that an individual
&gt;&gt;&gt;Civic driver is harming the environment more than a Suburban driver,
&gt;&gt;&gt;simply because there are more of them. The individual can only
&gt;&gt;&gt;control what he does. Owning a Civic is not as good as forgoing a
&gt;&gt;&gt;vehicle altogether, but it is far less harmful than buying a Suburban.

&gt;&gt;Self-righteous SUV-haters aren't targeting individual SUV drivers,
&gt;&gt;they're targeting *ALL* SUV drivers. I therefore reserve the right to
&gt;&gt;similarly treat small-car drives as a group.

&gt;Fair enough. As a group they use about a third as much fuel as SUV
&gt;drivers.

"/> I hope you didn't get that from sales figures again, or by
simplistically comparing the mpg of economy cars to to the mpg of
SUV's.

See, I don't know what the overall figures are, and I'm not inclined
to use any of my time looking anything at all up until you've
convinced me you have some modicum of a case. If you want to persuade
me that SUV's should be taken off the road, it's up to YOU to provide
winning arguments and supporting documentation. So far all that you
and all the other SUV-haters have give me to go on is a lot of whining
and some idiotic claims that, for example, sales somehow relate to
amount of fuel being wasted.

The number I want to see is, how many passenger-miles-per-gallon do
economy-car drivers use up in the US each year, and how many
passenger-miles-per-gallon do SUV's use up in the US each year, and I
want those numbers from an impartial source that everyone here can
verify on the web. I will also want the option of easily checking out
the full details of how the study was conducted.

The next thing I want to see before we start talking about banning
SUV's, is more small-car drivers carpooling. As I said I'm not
inclined to go looking things up until you present a serious argument,
but offhand most of my friends with small cars claim around 25-30 mpg.
A large well-maintained large SUV will get about 12-15 MPG around
town, and the smaller SUV's approach 18-22 MPG (my S10's lower mpg is
a freak among smaller SUV's - Chevrolet did a terrible job of matching
the carb to thee engine, compounded the error by choosing a too-small
engine for the vehicle mass, and then the early-technology pollution
controls made a bad design even worse).

So, I'd guess that on average an SUV gets somewhere around half the
mileage of the average small-car. The amount of gas an SUV driver
would save by driving a small car instead, is thus about the same that
one small-car driver would save by carpooling the same distance. So,
it's hypocritical for small-car drivers who refuse to carpool to whine
about the amount of extra gas an SUV uses, or for those who DO carpool
not to devote the same amount of energy to discouraging solo driving
that they do to whining about SUV's.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Do you know that for a fact? Most of the people I know with the big
&gt;&gt;gas-eating SUV's plan their trips very carefully, split expenses
&gt;&gt;through carpooling, etc. because it *is* so expensive to feed those
&gt;&gt;gashogs. They're pretty much on the same gasoline budgets as everyone
&gt;&gt;else around here and use about the same amount of gasoline per month
&gt;&gt;as the small-car drivers.

&gt;I am somehow skeptical that the drivers of the $45,000 Lincoln
&gt;Navigators that share my commute into work are counting out their
&gt;pennies at the gas station. Especially the ones who are tailgating
&gt;and driving them at 80+ mph.

"/> I've no doubt there's some small group of SUV owners out there who are
filthy-rich enough not to mind blowing their money on fuel while
wearing out a $48,000 SUV on around-town driving. For a middle-class
worker a $48,000 vehicle is at best a twice-in-a-lifetime purchase so
they do everything they can to stretch it out. For someone with a
monster SUV and lot of around-town driving to do, the difference in
fuel costs is more than enough to make monthly payments on a small car
so they can get more years out of their precious SUV.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;My S10 gets horrible around-town mileage (around 15-18 mpg) yet a
&gt;&gt;friend who drives a tiny little Kia laughs that he spends more on
&gt;&gt;gasoline than I do. Why is somone who burns up X amount of gas by
&gt;&gt;driving a large vehicle any worse than a small-car driver who wastes
&gt;&gt;the same amount of gasoline on poorly-planned shopping rounds and
&gt;&gt;unnecessary trips?

&gt;No, there is no difference. But I don't believe that the average SUV
&gt;owner drives fewer miles than the average subcompact owner - certainly
&gt;not enough less to make up the difference.

"/> My personal observations say SUV drivers drive less (because of the
expense of a low-mpg vehicle), carpool more, and plan their trips more
carefully so they get better use out of each gallon of gas. That's not
a very scientific way of making the determination for all SUV's across
the country, and I certainly don't expect you or anyone else to accept
it, but for me it's better than some SUV-hater's wild guesses and
uninformed assumptions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Using one as a single seat commuter car is like wearing a sign that
&gt;&gt;&gt;says, &quot;I am a pig intent on destroying the Earth, and I don't care if
&gt;&gt;&gt;I kill it or you.&quot; Is that unfair? Maybe in some cases, but too bad.

&gt;&gt;You're being hypocritical. No matter how much gas each is using, the
&gt;&gt;principle is the same whether the solo driver is in a monster SUV or
&gt;&gt;an economy car.

&gt;What principle is the same? The Otto cycle and Newton's laws of
&gt;motion?

"/> The principle of wasting gas is the same whether it's a gallon or a
pint.

You're going to have to do a lot better than all these assumptions and
evasions if you want to persuade anyone that SUV's should be taken off
the roads.

I've heard many surveys in local papers as to why people buy SUVs, and quite
often the reason is they feel safer in a bigger vehicle... why do they feel
the need? Because of other large SUVs... So, no, I'm not full of SH1T as

"/> What about people who heat their homes with oil? Is that just as immoral?
If you burn the refined equivalalent of 1500 gallons of crude oil (27
barrels) heating your house per year and 350 gallons of crude oil (6
barrels) in your SUV per year, is that SUV still more immoral? Seems to me
that everyone with an oil burner in their furnace is at least as bad as an
SUV driver (or a Honda Civic driver that burns a lot of gas in a year), if
not a lot worse. Shame on them for heating their homes! Shame!

True, but the fact remains no mater what you believe to be moral
or what you would like others to do to fit into your opinion on
the subject, people will legally continue to buy the vehicles
they need, want and can afford. Bitchin about SUV's in multiple
NG's for weeks or months on end will not make a bit of difference
in the REAL world. Get over it and get on with your life, WBMA.
Perhaps if you got a girlfriend, you might have something more
enjoyable to do with all your free time, rather than sitting in
front of a PC at all hours of the day and night? ;)

&gt; OK, lets talk about avoiding accidents. SUVs take longer to stop

drive a classic every day conflicts with safety. Most of the upgrades one
does to a classic with safety in mind are to the mechanics, such as a dual
circuit brake system for pre-1967 cars or disc brakes. When it comes down to
it though, if bumpers don't align, bad things will happen as the crash is
not absorbed the the part of the car designed to absorb the crash.

&gt;&gt;referring to the S2000. My Galaxie with a 289 is _not_ by any means a
&gt;&gt;perforamnce car. It's a normal road car. Comparing it to other normal
road
&gt;&gt;cars (or modern vintage), it will turn more RPM at a given speed in lots
of
&gt;&gt;scenarios.

&gt; Like at idle? Name one other?

"/> In overdrive I've seen cars typically turning 2,000 RPM whereas my car will
turn 2,500+ both doing 65 MPH. I'll ask my girlfriends mother who drives a 4
cyl Beetle about what RPM it turns in overdrive at highway speeds.

By the way, my car idles around 450 RPM, I think a 4 cyl would barely be
running at such an idle speed. A performance 4 cyl definitely wouldn't be
able to run at that idle speed. The cam would simply be too big.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A lot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of it depends on gearing vs the weaight of the car vs the engines
ability
&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rev quickly. The 289 in my 67 _loves_ to rev, it's pretty fun to drive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;because of that.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The S2000 goes from idle to 9000+ rpm in about two seconds in first
&gt;&gt;&gt; gear.

&gt;&gt;I'm sure a perforamnce car like that is geared quite high. I'm talking
about
&gt;&gt;road cars, designed to be practical transportation.

&gt; I'm sure its first gear ratio is not much different from a plain-jane
&gt; Civic. What makes it go fast is the power of the engine.

"/> Well the rear end ratio (whatever equivalent FWD cars have) is higher, that
much I'm sure of (just like in a performance RWD car you have a higher rear
ratio). That is why it will turn such high RPM at a given speed vs a typical
road car.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To top it off, there have been more than a few times in which I woulda
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;slammed into someone making a stupid move or gotten hit by an

brakes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(replaced everything in the brake system when I got it),

&gt;&gt;&gt; So you think your Galaxie 500 can out-brake an S2000?

&gt;&gt;No, again, I am not comparing my Galaxie to an S2000. They are completely
&gt;&gt;different cars designed for completely different roles.

&gt; I would be amazed if your G 500 could out-brake a Civic under any but
&gt; the most contrived circumstances.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;I don't understand why you keep thinking I'm comparing everything to an

&gt; You are saying that you wouldn't feel safe with a 4-cyl engine due to
&gt; poor acceleration. I am giving examples to the contrary.

"/> I see. I was referring more to the typical 4 cyl road car. I've never
thought of a 4 cyl engine as being capable of real performance before this
thread. It's really an interesting and bizzare concept at first. I guess it
can work in a light car though.

A
&gt;&gt;stock small block 67 or 68 Galaxie has nothing in common with a S2000,

&gt; Well, I see a lot more S2000s than I see Galaxie 500s. One parks in

"/> I see more Galaxie 500's (and/or Custom 500's) than _any_ performance 4 cyl

one of those before. I see BMWs a lot, though I don't know if they are 4 cyl

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;does have something in common with a Geo. That is that they are both

&gt; I don't see how the S2000 fails to meet that definition. But if you

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not that it has anything to do with the discussion at hand but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; technically, torque does not &quot;move cars&quot; i.e. accelerate them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quickly. Give me a 500 hp motor of reasonable weight - I don't care
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at what rpm - and I can accelerate a car quickly. OTOH an engine
that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; makes 500 ft-lb of torque won't do crap if it redlines at 50 rpm.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you have proper gearing that 50 RPM with 500 ft-lb will move the car
&gt; just
&gt;&gt;&gt;fine. With a normal 3.00:1 rear and normal tranny gears the car won't
&gt; move
&gt;&gt;&gt;much anywhere.

&gt;&gt; Bzzzzt. Oh, I'm sorry. The correct answer is a top speed of maybe 15
&gt;&gt; mph and it will take a minute or two to get there. If the 500 ft-lbs
&gt;&gt; is right at 50 rpm, you have less than 5hp. If peak torque is at some
&gt;&gt; lower speed, you have even less. Gear it any way you want, but please
&gt;&gt; keep it off the road.

&gt; I find that hard to believe. You just need to have enough gears to keep
the
&gt; engine around it's torque peak. It's similar to trucks, which have tons of
&gt; gears, little horsepower, and gobs of torque.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Furthermore, it does not matter where the torque peak is, but what
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hp is at the current rpm. That Honda engine will always be running
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; faster than your Galaxie 500 (except at idle), so comparing torque/hp
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at any given rpm is misleading.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually my Gal probably runs at a higher RPM a good bit of the time as
&gt; no
&gt;&gt;&gt;doubt the Honda has overdrive or at elast a lockup torque converter.

&gt;&gt; If we are still talking about the S2000, it certainly doesn't have a
&gt;&gt; lockup torque converter. In top gear it probably runs 3000rpm at 60
&gt;&gt; mph. What does your Galaxie turn at that speed?

&gt; I don't know what the obsession is with that S2000, but no, I was not
&gt; referring to the S2000. My Galaxie with a 289 is _not_ by any means a
&gt; perforamnce car. It's a normal road car. Comparing it to other normal road
&gt; cars (or modern vintage), it will turn more RPM at a given speed in lots
of
&gt; scenarios.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A lot
&gt;&gt;&gt;of it depends on gearing vs the weaight of the car vs the engines
ability
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;rev quickly. The 289 in my 67 _loves_ to rev, it's pretty fun to drive
&gt;&gt;&gt;because of that.

&gt;&gt; The S2000 goes from idle to 9000+ rpm in about two seconds in first
&gt;&gt; gear.

&gt; I'm sure a perforamnce car like that is geared quite high. I'm talking
about
&gt; road cars, designed to be practical transportation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For a light car with a good transmission and a skilled, attentive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; driver, these high reving motors are great. And they will certainly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; avoid accidents better than a Galaxie 500.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well if you're looking at high speed accident avoidance then perhaps
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Honda may have an edge, but getting out of the way of things at low
&gt; speeds I
&gt;&gt;&gt;think the Galaxie would have the advantage. At higher speeds the
&gt; suspension
&gt;&gt;&gt;and weight of car would usually play a more significant role in
accident
&gt;&gt;&gt;avoidance, but at low speeds and parking lot type places you want
torque
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;get the car out of the way quickly.

&gt;&gt; You can always construct a scenario where a vehicle with inferior
&gt;&gt; overall performance would have an advantage. It appears you have done
&gt;&gt; so in this case. When most people talk about accident avoidance they
&gt;&gt; are not thinking about parking lots.

&gt; I'm not talking solely about in and around parking lots, but also at
speed,
&gt; where I have had to both accelerate and brake quickly to avoid accidents.
I
&gt; was jsut coming up with a more specific example. At higher speeds the
&gt; average suspension on your typical rice-mobile will be better if nothing
&gt; else due to the fact that the Honda has a good 1,000 lb advantage.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunately when I was struck in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;side while sitting at a red light I couldn't go anywhere as there was a
&gt; guy
&gt;&gt;&gt;crossing the street in front of me, a car to my left and a car behind
me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;All the torque in the world won't do any good when you can't get out of
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;way.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Speaking of avoiding accidents... In the past year or so my dad who
&gt; drives a
&gt;&gt;&gt;93 Geo Prizm has gotten in 4 or 5 accidents I believe. I have only
gotten
&gt;&gt;&gt;into one, and I wasn't even moving at the time. He was rear ended once,
&gt; hit
&gt;&gt;&gt;a deer another time, and twice lost control in bad weather. My
&gt; girlfriends
&gt;&gt;&gt;father who drives a 93 Toyota Camry &quot;wagon&quot; lost control of the car in
&gt; snow
&gt;&gt;&gt;a month ago and slammed into a guard rail. I've driven the 67 through
&gt; worse
&gt;&gt;&gt;snow quite a few times and never had any trouble. I guess that may have
&gt; more
&gt;&gt;&gt;to do with the vehicles weight aiding in a better grip, or perhaps I
just
&gt;&gt;&gt;drive more safely in bad weather.

&gt;&gt; I suspect it is the latter and a little luck. In driving light weight
&gt;&gt; FWD vehicles I have only had one accident in the last 19 years. I was
&gt;&gt; rear ended at a stop light. The guy in front of me heard the
&gt;&gt; squealing wheels and blew the light to get out of the way so I wasn't
&gt;&gt; pushed into him. He didn't have a 4 cylinder engine, he had a 2
&gt;&gt; cylinder engine. Anecdotal evidence isn't worth much.

&gt; I suppose it all depends on the individual situation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;To top it off, there have been more than a few times in which I woulda
&gt;&gt;&gt;slammed into someone making a stupid move or gotten hit by an
inattentive
&gt;&gt;&gt;twit. I attribute my not being a parapalegic to that car's great brakes
&gt;&gt;&gt;(replaced everything in the brake system when I got it),

&gt;&gt; So you think your Galaxie 500 can out-brake an S2000?

&gt; No, again, I am not comparing my Galaxie to an S2000. They are completely
&gt; different cars designed for completely different roles.

&gt;&gt;&gt; as well as to it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;quick revving 289 which has the torque to move the car quickly out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;danger.

&gt;&gt; As well as out-accelerate one?

&gt; Like I said, an S2000 is not a typical road car. My Galaxie is (or was at
&gt; one point in time), I make no claims to out-accelerate a car designed for
&gt; race or autocross, simply that a modern typical road car in most cases
does
&gt; not have the same acceleration as either of my cars. You see, my car and a
&gt; typical mid-full sized sedan have something in common, they were designed
to
&gt; move people. They weren't designed as toys, that's what 427's are for.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What I can say is that had I been driving my dads Geo I can think of
&gt;&gt;&gt;at least one time where I woulda been in an accident in which I would
&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;been hit in the side from someone quickly pulling out across two lanes
&gt;&gt;&gt;without looking first.

&gt;&gt; And that Geo performance somehow compares to an S2000?

&gt; I don't understand why you keep thinking I'm comparing everything to an
&gt; S2000. If you ask me you're a bit obsessive over this car. A Geo Prizm is
a
&gt; typical road car. It's a compact sedan. I see several of Geo Prizms and
&gt; Toyota Camrys every day on my commute. I have yet to see a single S2000. A
&gt; stock small block 67 or 68 Galaxie has nothing in common with a S2000, it
&gt; does have something in common with a Geo. That is that they are both
&gt; passenger cars designed for normal road use.

&gt;&gt;&gt;What I am saying is that a car with a bigger engine is inherently safer
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;one with a small 4 cyl. I'm not talking about performance 4 cyl engines
&gt;&gt;&gt;(LOL, performance 4 cyl... anyway...),

&gt;&gt; And that 0-60 times in the 5 second range is not performance?

&gt; Sure it is, it just makes me laugh when I think of a 4 cly torqueless
wonder
&gt; having performance. It's plenty possible though with all this modern
&gt; technology and a lightweight car. Put that S2000 engine in my Galaxie and
&gt; I'd be surprised if it could move the car.

&gt;&gt; Safety is a package, not just a torque curve. Active safety (accident
&gt;&gt; avoidance) of your G 500 cannot compare to an S2000 or probably any
&gt;&gt; modern car (unless you have heavily modified it and even then...) My
&gt;&gt; non-Japanese car is a '92 Volvo wagon with a 2.3L engine. Certainly
&gt;&gt; doesn't out-run much but it was statistically the safest car on the
&gt;&gt; road when I bought. Like I said, it's a package.

&gt; Here I will agree with you. I definitely feel safety is a package. It
&gt; consists of both performance (power, braking, suspension...) and safety
&gt; features in the event of a crash (shoulder belts, collapsible steering
&gt; column, air bags, head restraints...). Again, my Gals don't compare to an
&gt; S200 in that respect, and the 67 doesn't even compare to a modern car. The
&gt; 68 though, with shoulder belts and a collapsible steering column, compares
&gt; to some of the older cars still on the road.

&gt; But still, in the event of a crash

&gt;&gt;&gt; so they can get more years out of their precious SUV.

&gt;&gt; Most SUV owners I've known considered it far beneath their dignity to

&gt;What about people who heat their homes with oil? Is that just as immoral?

&gt;that everyone with an oil burner in their furnace is at least as bad as an

&gt;not a lot worse. Shame on them for heating their homes! Shame!

But that is assuming average maintenance (or lack thereof.) The
average person doesn't maintain their car worth shit. There's no
reason a *well maintained* older car can't produce emissions figures
close to those of those when the car was new for 1-200K miles at least
without major work.

"/> No, actually, you're not correct on that one. Your information is 10 years
out of date; the EPA no longer agrees with the position you've stated.

There was a big push for Accelerated Vehicle Retirement programs in the
late '80s and early '90s. These programs sought to scrap vehicles made
before a certain year on the premise that &quot;old = dirty&quot;. When EPA
prescribed scrappage programs for various states that were on the list of
air quality nonattainment areas, several of those states said &quot;This is not
going to work&quot; and got in a tiff with EPA.

What happened next was very interesting; EPA went back and took another,
more detailed look, including evaluating the emissions of vehicles bought
for scrappage in existing such programs, and found -- to the agency's
admitted surprise -- that within the bounds of model years significantly
represented in the on-road fleet, there is no direct correlation between
vehicle age and emissions performance.

Rather, they found, *for vehicles of similar design parameters*, it is
state of vehicle maintenance that is by far the prime determinant of
emissions. It turns out that in an emissions-versus-age projection, the
bulk of auto exhaust pollution comes from vehicles four to fourteen years
old on a rolling basis (1988 to 1998 models last year, 1989 to 1999 models
this year, and so on). Other, non-EPA studies of the issue came to very
similar conclusions (e.g. Donald Stedman's work at the University of
Denver). EPA support for scrappage programs was rapidly and drastically
downscaled on this basis. More refined programs targeting these vehicles
for emission testing and repair have replaced the &quot;Scrap the old cars&quot;
programs, and results thus far appear promising.

The explication for this rolling, 4-to-14-year-old group is rather simple:
Generally, vehicles newer than 4 years old are too &quot;young&quot; to have had any
failures or deterioration in the emission control systems. Vehicles 4 to
14 years old are increasingly likely to have both some degree of
deterioration or failure in their emissions-related systems, and to have
owners who will not or cannot spend the money for preventive maintenance
if the car runs and drives at all. Most state emission inspections are set
such that only truly gross polluters get flagged for repair, in order to
avoid long waits and peeved constituencies.

Vehicles older than 14 years are not in the target group, for several
reasons: There aren't enough of them left on the road to contribute
significantly to air pollution, and as they survive each year beyond 15
years, they are increasingly likely to be in the hands of enthusiasts or
collectors who tend both not to drive them much and to keep them
fastidiously maintained. So it may be true that one particular 1973
Chevrolet Caprice may emit ten times the HC, CO and NOx of *ten combined*
particular 2003 Honda Civics, giving an emissions ratio in this
hypothetical of 100:1, but the ratio of '03 Civics to '73 Caprices is far,
far greater than 100:1. EPA calculated there would be &gt;&gt;no significant
improvement in air quality if all pre-1981 cars were taken off the road&lt;&lt;,
for these reasons. That's why you don't see EPA pushing scrappage programs
as they did 10 to 15 years ago.

State emission regulations are gradually catching up to this finer
understanding of where the bulk of auto-source pollution comes from. Many
jurisdictions now exempt vehicles 2 or 3 years old or newer from emissions
tests, begin testing them every other year at 4 years old, begin testing
them every year at 10 years old, and stop testing them at 15 or 20 years
old.

Your &quot;90 percent of the pollution comes from 10 percent of the cars, and
those are the older ones&quot; statement is a soundbite that was popular a
decade and a half ago, but it has been rigorously tested and found not to
hold up to scientific inquiry *by the EPA*.

"/> In principle, PMVI (Periodic Motor Vehicle Inspection) is a terrific idea.
However, before an effective PMVI program can be implemented, there must
be uniform and enforceable vehicle safety and equipment regulations.
This is NOT a situation that exists in North America. In America, each
state has its own safety and equipment standards. Many of these standards
are unenforceably vague. Many of them are hopelessly outdated,
inapplicable to current vehicles, and unenforceably vague and subjective
in nature. There are national Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, but
many of these, too, cannot be used for the purpose of determining vehicle
equipment compliance in the field. This is because of the byzantine manner
in which they are written and the lax fiduciary marking requirements as
much as it is due to the *a posteriori* self-certification rubric upon
which they are based. And to top it all off, not all of the states have
laws requiring that vehicle safety equipment meet US Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standards.

This is quite opposite to the situation in most of the rest of the world,
which uses internationally-promulgated ECE auto safety and equipment
regulations. These regulations tend to be very precisely written and, more
importantly, they are implemented on a type-approval basis so that there
is some assurance, rather than just a vague promise, that an item of
safety equipment actually complies with the requirement. What is more,
countries that adhere to these regulations have, by and large, fully
adopted these regulations into their own national vehicle codes. All this
means there is a uniform, objective, clear standard by which to judge the
compliance of all vehicles. We just haven't got that in the USA, and it
will be a long time coming.

What is more, PMVI programs, which used to be present in most all states,
are politically unpopular here, because most of the ones that used to be
in place were screamingly corrupt. The inspectors would &quot;find&quot; stuff wrong
with every car they inspected and refuse to grant a sticker until $$$ were
spent to &quot;correct&quot; the &quot;problem&quot;. Changing to
inspection-only/get-it-fixed-elsewhere setups didn't address this;
inspection stations took kickbacks from local repair businesses and the
corruption continued. On top of all that, a PMVI program that is rigorous
enough to be effective takes more time and costs more money than Americans
are willing to accept.

The situation is similar in Canada, though some provinces (such as
Ontario) still have required safety inspections. They are an excellent
illustration of why such inspections are no longer popular: They don't
work. You pay your $25, you waste your hour-plus, and you still see way
too many obviously-unsafe cars on the road.

Let me elighten you. Simple colliding body model is valid for rigid bodies
in a closed system (which, for your info., does NOT apply to 2 cars
colliding).

From Newton's 2nd law, force equals change in momentum with respect to time:
F=dp/dt

So, yes the smaller body experiences a larger change in momentum (dp). This
dp per unit time is felt as a force by the passengers. The larger dt (i.e.
the longer time elapses for momentum transfer to take place) the smaller the
force. And guess what crumple zones do, they increase the time by allowing
the momentum transfer to occur over a larger distance
(time=velocity/distance). So, YES, crumple zones have a lot to do with it.
Why do you think car manufacturers spend the time and money building them
into vehicles? As mentioned earlier, the crumple zones also absorb
energy... without crumple zones more energy would be transfered from one
vehicle to the other as kinetic energy, but with crumple zones some energy

&gt; I am referring to the overall gear ratio. IOW, most Honda 4-cyl
&gt; motors turn about 3000 rpm at 60 mph in top gear. (I don't think any
&gt; would be as low as 2500.) The high performance motors just make more
&gt; power (especially at higher rpm) and have higher redline.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stock small block 67 or 68 Galaxie has nothing in common with a S2000,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, I see a lot more S2000s than I see Galaxie 500s. One parks in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the same lot as me at work.

&gt;&gt;I see more Galaxie 500's (and/or Custom 500's) than _any_ performance 4 cyl
&gt;&gt;(unless you count ricers as performance, LOL). I know of 4 other's in around
&gt;&gt;my area. I wouldn't know what a performance 4 cyl car looks like for sure,
&gt;&gt;though I checked out some pics of the S2000 and know for sure I've not seen
&gt;&gt;one of those before. I see BMWs a lot, though I don't know if they are 4 cyl
&gt;&gt;or not. Haven't a clue about their performance either.

&gt; I assume you mean the BMW roadsters. Some of the early ones were 4s -
&gt; very pathetic. The V6s are good, but not as fast as the S2000 - at
&gt; least they didn't used to be.

&gt; Most high performance 4-cyls don't look like that. They look like
&gt; sporty coupes with wings on the back. The problem is that the low
&gt; power versions don't look much different from the high power versions.

&gt;&gt;I was remembering when you said the S2000 pulled some really high RPM at a
&gt;&gt;pretty low speed. Seemed pretty impractical for a daily driver/commuter car
&gt;&gt;to me. I'll keep my eyes open for some of these performance 4 cyl cars this
&gt;&gt;week. Probably most of them I don't even notice because they mostly look
&gt;&gt;like every other new car.

&gt; Here are a few you can see for yourself. All of these are 4-seat
&gt; daily drivers ranging in price from the high teens to the low 20s.

&gt; Acura Integra GS-R - 170 hp (this site has engine mods but exterior
&gt; looks pretty stock) check the dyno, milage and quarter mile data.
&gt; http://integra.bright-noise.com/&gt;
&gt; Subaru WRX - 227 hp
&gt; http://www.subaru.com/partners.jsp

&gt; Acura RSX Type S - 200 hp
&gt; http://www.acura.com/models/types_perf.asp?model=rsxs&amp;page=index

&gt; Honda Civic Si - 160 hp
&gt; http://makeashorterlink.com/?O13152863

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, then you would be surprised. It has 240 hp. It just needs the
&gt;&gt;&gt; right gear ratios and it would pull it pretty quick. (An extra-heavy
&gt;&gt;&gt; duty clutch would help too.)

&gt;&gt;I suppose it's possible, but they don't make 15:1 rear end gears. :) My Gal
&gt;&gt;probably weighs twice what an S2000 weighs. Would be interesting to see
&gt;&gt;anyway.

&gt; The S2000 weighs about 2700 lbs. Even with the same gearing as the
&gt; S2000, I don't think there is any doubt that it could drive the
&gt; Galaxie. With a little optimization it could be pretty quick. If you
&gt; are right about the Galaxie weighing 3700 (and less when you swap the
&gt; 4 for the V8), it has the same or better power-to-weight ratio as my
&gt; GS-R and that goes pretty good.

&gt;&gt;&gt; By the same token as a Mustang being typical than so is a GS-R or a
&gt;&gt;&gt; WRX.

&gt;&gt;I see your point, but again, it's just that RPM comment you made a few posts
&gt;&gt;back that made me doubt these performance 4 cyl cars ability to do commuter
&gt;&gt;duty.

&gt; My '94 GS-R redlines at 8000, fuel cut-off at ~8400 rpm, turns 3000
&gt; rpm at 60 mph in top gear. I drive it every day and it has 106,000
&gt; miles on it now. Engine still screams all the way to redline. It
&gt; sees 6000 or 7000 rpm pretty much any day the roads are dry.

&gt; That is the great thing about these cars. They are totally docile
&gt; when driven with a light foot. Stomp on it and it goes like a scalded
&gt; cat. The S2000 is only a little less Jeckle/more Hyde in its
&gt; personality.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How can you assert that the difference is an any way related to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;vehicle?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm merely pointing out the hypocrisy of attacking SUV owners as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;environmentally irresponsible&quot; while ignoring the many-times-greater
&gt;&gt;&gt; number of people in more fuel-efficient cars who refuse to carpool,
&gt;&gt;&gt; won't ride a bike 5 miles to work or make use of mass transit, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It could easily be presented the other way. Do you have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;actual numbers for distance traveled, or are you just fabricating
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hypothetical situations to suit your opinion?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I drive about 100 mi. per week in a small car with a 4-cyl.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you car pool?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How many per week for you and what engine size?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I live within a 1-hour walk (15 minute bike ride) of work and drive
&gt;&gt;&gt; about 50 miles a week (mostly shopping and visiting) in a small SUV
&gt;&gt;&gt; (S10 Blazer) with a 2.8L engine. The truck is 18 years old and was
&gt;&gt;&gt; headed for the junkyard when I acquired it. A considerable amount of
&gt;&gt;&gt; energy would have had to be expended melting the whole thing down and
&gt;&gt;&gt; turning it into a new vehicle if I didn't spent so much of my time
&gt;&gt;&gt; scrounging the junkyards for the parts to keep it running - thus
&gt;&gt;&gt; recycling those parts, too, until they're worn to the bone. (Not that
&gt;&gt;&gt; I do all that work solely out of concern for the environment - I just
&gt;&gt;&gt; enjoy taking a piece of scrap and turning it into a reliable,
&gt;&gt;&gt; smoothly-running vehicle on-the-cheap. At the moment I have about
&gt;&gt;&gt; $4,000 invested in this truck, purchase price and all, and fully
&gt;&gt;&gt; expect it to last me at least ten more years).

&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason I want a 4x4 SUV is that I live in a snow state and when
&gt;&gt;&gt; blizzards settle in for the long haul I volunteer my free time to
&gt;&gt;&gt; drive nurses to patients' homes, deliver food and medications to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; elderly, run them to important doctor appointments, etc. I need the
&gt;&gt;&gt; space in the back of the truck to carry fold-up wheelchairs and
&gt;&gt;&gt; groceries, or I can fold the seat up and carry three other people and
&gt;&gt;&gt; still have room in the back for all their luggage.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In the summers I drive well into the backcountry with some friends and
&gt;&gt;&gt; a truckload of tools, where we spend anywhere from a day to a week
&gt;&gt;&gt; doing volunteer maintenance on the hiking trails. Mostly that means a
&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of hard labor fixing erosion problems to keep runoff from turning
&gt;&gt;&gt; some section of trail into an ugly gouge in the mountainside.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You know the sad part? Wherever possible we drive on the trail to get
&gt;&gt;&gt; ourselves and our 600 pounds of tools, food, water, and camping
&gt;&gt;&gt; supplies where we're going without leaving marks on the countryside.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Occasionally some hiker shakes his fist and curses us &quot;drunken 4x4
&gt;&gt;&gt; rednecks&quot; for stupidly thinking a hiking trail is for driving on.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Once someone even threw a big rock at my truck and gashed the hood,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but we never found out who because they were part of a group and
&gt;&gt;&gt; nobody would talk. On another occasion we parked at the trailhead and
&gt;&gt;&gt; just lugged some basic tools in for some simple work. When we got back
&gt;&gt;&gt; tired and beat later in the day, all the SUV's there - and ONLY the
&gt;&gt;&gt; SUV's - had all been keyed and the air let out of their tires.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The self-righteous are like that. They're oh-so-ready to preach
&gt;&gt;&gt; responsibility to everyone else, but don't expect them to step forward
&gt;&gt;&gt; and take responsibility for their own actions.

"/> Your car's air conditioner compressor probably turns on and off, too,
but you may not notice it. Mine certainly does. The ECU (engine
computer) controls the compressor clutch to regulate the evaporator(?)
temperature.

Another difference is that the home A/C has a thermostat for the room
temperature, and the car might not. In many cases, once the car has
been cooled from its initial temperature, my car A/C provides more
cooling than is necessary, and I mix in heated air or turn the A/C off
by hand periodically. At the very least, I turn down the fan, which
results in the compressor coming on less frequently. And this is a
relatively small Civic A/C unit in SoCal.

&gt; buy appliances that use less energy (often energy star certified). I'll turn

&gt;&gt; environment.&quot; That just doesn't fly.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So, because all drivers don't make good choices, it excuses the ones
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; make worse choices?

&gt;&gt; I don't have any figures, but there is one big difference between my car and
&gt;&gt; my house when it comes to air conditioning. That is, when I'm air
&gt;&gt; conditioning my car, it's on constantly. The house unit, in contrast,
&gt;&gt; periodically shuts itself off. I really should say, periodically turns on -
&gt;&gt; most of the time it's off.

&gt;Your car's air conditioner compressor probably turns on and off, too,
&gt;but you may not notice it. Mine certainly does. The ECU (engine
&gt;computer) controls the compressor clutch to regulate the evaporator(?)
&gt;temperature.

&gt;Another difference is that the home A/C has a thermostat for the room
&gt;temperature, and the car might not. In many cases, once the car has
&gt;been cooled from its initial temperature, my car A/C provides more
&gt;cooling than is necessary, and I mix in heated air or turn the A/C off
&gt;by hand periodically. At the very least, I turn down the fan, which
&gt;results in the compressor coming on less frequently. And this is a
&gt;relatively small Civic A/C unit in SoCal.

"/> well...all I know is that the interior of a car has just about *zero*
insulation. For example, in the winter just as soon as you turn the
engine/heat off, the interior will get very cold. Same holds true for
the summer, once the a/c is shut off, the interior heats up
immediately. In a house, the insulation will keep the current temp
for a significantly longer time.

You don't know what a dirty environment is. Years ago everything
was powered by dirty soft coal fired steam power and everything
was dumped into the rivers. Sure we needed enviromental
regulations to change that but we did it not by allowing the
manufactures to develop newer cleaner ways of doing things, we
did it by forcing insupportable retro fix quick fixes and high
costs on our manufacturing base while allowing imports to
undersell American companies. The result was the closing down of
most of our oil production, steel mills, tanneries, cement
plants, paint plants and chemical plants among many other things
like the loss of mining and lumbering companies. Now we must
import and send out capital and most of those jobs and the
pollution to other counties and American can't find work at a
living wage. Today two people must work to provide what one
person could twenty years ago. People better soon wise up and
start looking at labels and return to buying American before you
and your children have no work at all unless you count you call
'Welcome to Wal Mart and 'Do you want fries with that?' work.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Hmm... Which car gets the worst possible mileage?&quot;. They simply pick the
&gt;&gt; car they want and can afford. From there it is their responsibility to not
&gt;&gt; use an excess of gas more than what is needed.

&gt;&gt; The fact of the matter is that we are not all eco-nuts. I am not an eco-nut
&gt;&gt; by any stretch of the imagination. But within my lifestyle I do whatever I
&gt;&gt; can for the environment. I'll turn the heat down when I'm not home, and when
&gt;&gt; I'm home I'll turn it off in rooms I don't use. I conserve electricity and
&gt;&gt; buy appliances that use less energy (often energy star certified). I'll turn
&gt;&gt; things off when not using them. It's the same thing as when I drive the car
&gt;&gt; of my choice, for normal driving I don't use it any more than needed and
&gt;&gt; drive lightly.

&gt;&gt; When I go out in nice weather for a cruise I'll occasionally stomp on it and
&gt;&gt; play a little. Using that gas for recreation in my car it's no different
&gt;&gt; than riding a dirt bike, or watching TV, or going to the movies. They all
&gt;&gt; use energy and pollute. It's just my choice of what I want to do to enjoy
&gt;&gt; myself in my free time. I believe I'm more responsible than a lot of people
&gt;&gt; when it comes to the environment, but a lot of people are better than me. I
&gt;&gt; don't really care, I commend them for being more environmentally conscious,
&gt;&gt; but going crazy on it doesn't suit my lifestyle. No one can force it upon
&gt;&gt; me, I'll do what I'm comfortable doing within my lifestyle but that's it. If
&gt;&gt; you have suggestions, I'm open to them, but again, if it doesn't fit my
&gt;&gt; life, I won't do it.

In general however, the scary thing is that manufacturing is being

the competiton of another technological nation like it was with japan.
It's US companies and those of other nations relocating their manufacturing
in China, teaching china, while reaping the benefits of no environmental

manufacturing to china. Pollution isn't being reduced all that much,
it's being relocated, so more of the world can be polluted.

People in the US complain about a lack of factory jobs, etc but the
same people will consider me insane for trying to avoid made in china
products. It's pushing it's way into professional jobs now. Company execs
seemingly are now thinking it's best to have engineers who speak chinese
and are close to or at the manufacturing site doing the design. Also, if
what I heard is correct, only make $300 a month.

I can understand a say a japanese or german company importing superior
products and taking over market share. What I cannot accept is relocated
manufacturing with known US and other quality nameplates on made-in-china
crapola. If it was just a question of US companies not meeting the
competition from a nation with similiar labor and environmental regs
on a product design and manufacturing quality level, then so be it.
But that just isn't the case now. It's companies relocating china to
make things at third world costs cheating on materials and processes and
sell them as if they were made in the USA to the highest standards with
the price set to that image.

If the consumer didn't buy imported products they would not be
imported. American companies have no choice but to to go off
shore to compete with low cost foreign manufactures that need no
comply to American environmental regulations. Soon you will see
even more and more American companies moving their corporate
headquarters off shore as have 250 since 1995 so they can avoid
American federal income taxes on things built in the US, as do
Japanese automobile manufactures.

American workers are the most productive in the world, no other
country comes close. The difference is how do they compete with
countries like Russia and China where the average yearly wage is
$300, even if it should become $6,000 in twenty years? The
Japanese are much smarter than Americans in that they buy only
those products from outside of Japan that they do not produce
themselves, even if they cost more. American consumers had
better some become as smart and less greedy for their own good.

chicago has the damn tree killing beetles. You try competing with
manufacturing that pays workers didly squat where's no such thing as
environmental regulation or even simple rules to prevent sending critters
to where they don't belong.

I may not always buy from a US manufacturer, but I will buy from
manufacturers in countries with comparable labor and environmental
requirements as much as I can. I don't want to live poor and in and
industrial cesspool, and I don't want to support the creation of such
with my money. Rewarding companies for the creation of such things is
what happens when one buys third world goods at first world prices.
I will also not reward actions that serve to cause local harm, such
as these beetles. Not to mention consume tax dollars to fight.

execs and their secretaries are located overseas, it pretty much ceases

people can earn in the USA, part of the goal. Do you want to live like
the average person in China? I don't. Better yet, live in the USA on
the average wage of China? The corporation doesn't care if you have
enough to live on, they want to pay the least out of their pocket while
getting the most out of you.

And let's say these people can end up rubbing some nickels together and
buy some of the products. Well, that comes at the expense of the people
who used to make those products not being able to buy them. It's a wash.

And then there's the generousity argument, why don't we help them?
Fine. help them. sell the products made there, there. That will help
them far more. To make products there and sell them there at prices they
can afford. That will start to build up their economy, and their wages
so they can eventually afford products made in the USA, etc. Long term
far more profitable, but doesn't do much for next quarter's stock price.

It's going to require a group effort, from executives to management to
blue collar to bring manufacturing costs down. I've yet to see a
union willing to do anything other than grab more for themselves
instead of sacrificing a little to save a job.

The bottom line is that costs need to be reduced to compete. If
Americans could find a way to do so, they'd be able to compete with
foreign companies. Instead they cry for protectionism, like the steel
tariffs, and the softwood lumber tariffs. And then they wonder why no
one will buy American.

US buy a Japanese company, none of whom including Kawasaki (as

Harley. In five years it will be still be worth what you paid

In your dream perhaps, but not in the real world. If the Jap
bikes are so good where are all the old bikes and why do they
loose 50% of their value in two years while Harleys still bring
what the cost new or even more?

&gt; ..they do pay state and federal taxes just like any other corporation.
&gt; Additionally, the US workers there pay income taxes both to state and

&gt; Many of these companies are also listed on the US stock exchange

&gt;&gt; Buy the
&gt;&gt;Harley. In five years it will be still be worth what you paid

&gt;&gt;its value in two years. ;)

&gt; I wish that were true. Those days are long gone. Inventories are
&gt; rising and many dealers are now offering discounts for bikes that
&gt; remain gathering dust on their showroom floor. The VRod, touted to be
&gt; the &quot;next generation&quot; Harley has had lagging sales. However, I never
&gt; bought the bike as an investment anyway. The *only* way I'd sell it
&gt; is to trade it in for an Electra Glide or Road King, (I have a Wide

It's about companies relocating to various 3rd world countries. That's
what is very different about this. And it's not just factory work anymore.
This is wage to wage, people as replacable bits in a machine. It's like
going to a cheap corporate chain discount autoparts store and geting their
cheap reman starter vs. a new one from the manufacturer's dealer or
rebuilding your own with quality parts. That quick and dirty here and
now savings is what motivates the decision makers. They could care less
what it does to the company in 5 or 10 years. They want their bonus THIS
YEAR, their stock options to be highly profitable THIS YEAR.

If a US company made a crappy or more costly product than a european
company fine, so be it, they deserve to loose business. However it's
becoming more of a eurpoean company's made in china crap vs. a US
company's made in china crap sold for the same price before the
relocation of factories. Is this a good thing for those of us living
in developed countries? Short term at best, just like the cheapy reman

&gt;&gt;&gt; If we were to tax the shit out of gasoline in America like they do

&gt;&gt;&gt; overnight.

&gt;I've lost track of the proper attributions, but whoever wrote this statement
&gt;is talking through their hat - in the year 2000 the European Union imported
&gt;about 50% of its oil, and this figure is expected to rise to about 70% by
&gt;2020. But if we accept the &quot;reasoning&quot; expounded in the sentence quoted
&gt;above, we'd be led to believe that Europe (or at least the part encompassed
&gt;by the Union) was self sufficient in oil.

"/> Though the Euros are no more sulf-sufficent than the U.S., the import of
50% does not reflect the true situation of sufficiency. The oil companies,
who own the reserves, move crude oil around all over the world to the place
where the quality and spec of that oil yields the best return. IOW Europe
is an oil exporter and importer and some of their crudes are among the
sweetest and lightest around - very desirable for producing fuels.

At least that's been the situation but now that the N. Sea has passed its
peak production rate and will tail off gradually over a period of years
there will, as you say, be a steady increase in their relative level of
imports.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;An often overlooked fact is that, in 2000 the U.S. was the world’s second
&gt;largest oil producer. Saudi Arabia produced the most, 441.2 billion barrels,
&gt;followed by the U.S. at 353.5 and the Russian Federation at 323.3 billion
&gt;barrels. That year, the US imported slightly more than 50% of its oil.

&gt;Despite high taxes on gasoline, Europe doesn't do any better than the US
&gt;when it comes to dependence on foreign oil.

something which is going to get a lot worse now that building new roads is

crumple zones and airbags. As far as I'm concerned any car 1968 and up is
comparable to modern safety standards, and optionally equipped cars (with
shoulder belts, or otehr safety features) from before 68 are as well.

safer, just they don't beat a typical road car from the 60's or 70's in
every category. Blanket statements aren't gonig to do too good here, as
every car is unique.

Blindly assuming anything isn't going to do anyone any good. People still
drive late 70's and early 80's cars with great crash survivability. After
the early 70's safety upgrades were only incremental. Shoulder belts and
head restraints were the biggest safety enhancements ever made in my
opinion.

&gt;&gt; Like at idle? Name one other?

"/> Again, I don't understand what RPM has to do with anything. You sound like
the people that like DOHC because it has many theoretical advantages. RPM
is related to the economy and performance, but it is overshadowed by other
factors. I'd rather look at overall economy and performance.

Of course, I'm not afraid of RPM. I had a friend that complained to me
that he didn't get the Integra GS-R, but the GS Limited Edition instead.
The only material difference is the engine. He said he would like to have
had the better engine. I've ridden with him, and I pointed out that, with
his driving, he will lose mileage because of the gear changes for the more
powerful engine. He never got above 3000 rpm, unless he was in top gear
and had no other gear to shift to. I just had to laugh at him. He wanted
(as far as it would practically be for him) worse performance because
someone told him it was better.

S2000s are relatively torqueless, even in VTEC range.

When they are driven outside of VTEC, they are even more torqueless. The
&quot;difficulty&quot; is that they are torqueless wonders at &quot;daily driver&quot; RPMS and
they indeed drive like a Civic, etc. in &quot;daily driver&quot; mode.

less general education.

You certainly are entitled to your opinion but I have owned over
two dozen bikes in my time, the majority of which were Japanese.
My last three have been Harleys. ALL of them
were great bikes. The problem with Jap bikes is they are not
worth much after two years. I sold my first Harley for $4,000
more than I paid for it. Why? The price of ALL new bikes go up
every year and Harleys appreciate, simple. If you bought any new
bikes in the past ten years you would understand that.

&gt; bikes selling at MSRP with NO wait. Why would *anyone* buy a used
&gt; bike for MORE than what a new bike sells for? Anyone who buys a
&gt; motorcycle for an investment is only fooling themselves. Buy a Harley
&gt; because you want one, not because you think it's patriotic.

Have you gone into a dealership recently? I mean *really* recently?

There is no WAY in hell you'll sell a used Harley for $4,000 more than
MSRP. NO WAY. You're dreaming. That's the facts, not some clouded
memory of how things were when the economy was stronger, people had
more spendable income and Harley couldn't keep up with demand.

My local dealer has 2001 and 2002 used Harleys on the floor on
consignment *right now*. Most with less than 10k miles on them.
*None* of them are anywhere near MSRP, let alone $4k over.

Don't believe me? Go on over to rec.motorcycles.harley and ask if
anyone there thinks you can sell your used Harley for $4k over MSRP.

Once the laughter dies down, come on back and we'll talk *reality*.

I have a bunch of seat time in my dad's S2000, on the road and at the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but no, I was not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;referring to the S2000. My Galaxie with a 289 is _not_ by any means a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;perforamnce car. It's a normal road car. Comparing it to other normal
road
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cars (or modern vintage), it will turn more RPM at a given speed in
lots of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;scenarios.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Like at idle? Name one other?

&gt;&gt;In overdrive I've seen cars typically turning 2,000 RPM whereas my car
will
&gt;&gt;turn 2,500+ both doing 65 MPH. I'll ask my girlfriends mother who drives
a 4
&gt;&gt;cyl Beetle about what RPM it turns in overdrive at highway speeds.

&gt; What's wrong with RPM? The EPA tests are done with the same transmissions
&gt; as they are sold. If a car runs 50% more RPM than a truck, then that will
&gt; be reflected in the EPA ratings. A car at 3000 RPM will probably get
&gt; better mileage than a truck on the same highway at 2000 RPM.

"/> You are assuming the car has a small 4 cyl and the truck a V8. What if the
car is a Fairlane with a 390 and the truck is a F100 with a 390? The truck
will probably get better mileage, since it either has a lower rear ratio or
an overdrive transmission.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;By the way, my car idles around 450 RPM, I think a 4 cyl would barely be
&gt;&gt;running at such an idle speed. A performance 4 cyl definitely wouldn't be
&gt;&gt;able to run at that idle speed. The cam would simply be too big.

&gt; Again, I don't understand what RPM has to do with anything. You sound
like
&gt; the people that like DOHC because it has many theoretical advantages. RPM
&gt; is related to the economy and performance, but it is overshadowed by other
&gt; factors. I'd rather look at overall economy and performance.

"/> Well me too, but I see no point to a small engine geared out the wazoo so
you can get to the torque (which doesn't kick in till 5,000) fast enough to
use it. I would much rather have a more practically geared V8 that doesn't
rev as high, but doesn't need to. V8's still can rev though when built for
it, Ford built the 427 SOHC for NASCAR and it could sustain 7,500+ RPM and
not miss a beat. NASCAR outlawed it because they were afraid. Not much of a
street engine I hear, but supposed to be great for drag racing, which is
what Ford used it's limited production on since it couldn't be used in
NASCAR. A V8 built to rev and not need to have 4.50:1 gears (289s can be
built fairly easily to see 7,000+ RPM every day due to their short stroke,
I've heard of this guy that built one that saw 12,000 on every pass!),
though such an engine will need higher gears, and past a certain point and
it's not streetable. RPM does play an important role in performance and
economy, but you are certainly correct that there are other factors as well.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Of course, I'm not afraid of RPM. I had a friend that complained to me
&gt; that he didn't get the Integra GS-R, but the GS Limited Edition instead.
&gt; The only material difference is the engine. He said he would like to have
&gt; had the better engine. I've ridden with him, and I pointed out that, with
&gt; his driving, he will lose mileage because of the gear changes for the more
&gt; powerful engine. He never got above 3000 rpm, unless he was in top gear
&gt; and had no other gear to shift to. I just had to laugh at him. He wanted
&gt; (as far as it would practically be for him) worse performance because
&gt; someone told him it was better.

"/> There's no reason to be screaming down the highway at 3,500+ RPM doing 75-80
MPH. Simply put you don't need that kind of RPM to sustain the speed. It
could be just as sustainable at 2,500 with plenty of acceleration power.
More RPM puts more wear and stress on an engine. There's no reason to lug
around on the highways at 1,500 RPM and put all that stress on the bearings,
but there's no reason to do the opposite either.

&gt;&gt; What's wrong with RPM? The EPA tests are done with the same transmissions
&gt;&gt; as they are sold. If a car runs 50% more RPM than a truck, then that will
&gt;&gt; be reflected in the EPA ratings. A car at 3000 RPM will probably get
&gt;&gt; better mileage than a truck on the same highway at 2000 RPM.

&gt;You are assuming the car has a small 4 cyl and the truck a V8. What if the
&gt;car is a Fairlane with a 390 and the truck is a F100 with a 390? The truck
&gt;will probably get better mileage, since it either has a lower rear ratio or
&gt;an overdrive transmission.

"/> Modern vehicles.

Trucks get worse city mileage because they weigh more.

Trucks get worse highway mileage because of the aerodynamics.

This presumes that the engines are the same, which doesn't appear to be the
case. Even the same size engines from the same factory are rated quite
differently between applications.

There is no current truck I know of with an engine similar to a car that
gets better mileage. If you know of one, please let us know.  www.epa.gov
should have all the mileage for cars and trucks.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;By the way, my car idles around 450 RPM, I think a 4 cyl would barely be
&gt;&gt;&gt;running at such an idle speed. A performance 4 cyl definitely wouldn't be
&gt;&gt;&gt;able to run at that idle speed. The cam would simply be too big.

&gt;&gt; Again, I don't understand what RPM has to do with anything. You sound
&gt;like
&gt;&gt; the people that like DOHC because it has many theoretical advantages. RPM
&gt;&gt; is related to the economy and performance, but it is overshadowed by other
&gt;&gt; factors. I'd rather look at overall economy and performance.

&gt;Well me too, but I see no point to a small engine geared out the wazoo so
&gt;you can get to the torque (which doesn't kick in till 5,000) fast enough to
&gt;use it. I would much rather have a more practically geared V8 that doesn't
&gt;rev as high, but doesn't need to.

"/> And I don't care. If my engine needs high RPM to do well (like my Miata
did), then I will be bouncing off the rev limiter at least weekly and
running it into the red on nearly every trip. 3 years, and not a single
unscheduled stop before I let it go.

My current car has 217 ft-lbs at 4000 rpm in a 2.0 4-cyl, so I don't have
to press as hard or high for the kick. It's torque and power peaks are
1000 rpm less than the Miata that preceded it. And the literature (and
butt-o-meter) say that a good bit of the torque is available well before
the peak.

My current car also feels more &quot;practically geared&quot; as you would call it.
The Miata stayed pretty high in the revs with highway driving, especially
at 70+.

Just my opinion, but I think the AC compressor cutout
is activated during acceleration for maximum perform-
ance, rather than concerns for any fuel economy issues.

Apparently, you can't go fast, and be cool while doing
so....

&gt;&gt;I know mine does, because the speed changes a little when it kicks on or
&gt;&gt;off. It's mostly only noticable at really high revs, though, like if it
&gt;&gt;kicks in or out when I'm accellerating hard.

&gt; That's probably not the same thing at all. The compressor will kick out
if
&gt; you're accelerating hard because the system is built to do that as a fuel

I have driven the vehicle in the manner it was designed and I'm still

&gt; Well geeze, George. Embarrassment? LOL.

&gt; I have a bunch of seat time in my dad's S2000, on the road and at the
&gt; track, so I'm quite familiar with VTEC range, its relative lack of torque,
&gt; and the way that it drives.

it's the truth. Might make one blind to the fact that there are folks
out there who find Honda's implementation of the automobile to be
wanting in some respect.

I have not had the pleasure of driving an S2k on the track, but have
driven one around a larger NW U.S. city. I came away with the opinion
that it was less fun and more work to drive than it was worth. Around
town, I would have preferred a V6 Accord, if I had to drive around a
Honda. Or a MY2000 Civic Si. To tell the truth, the Gen3 RX7 that I
drove on the same streets was much more enjoyable in an urban setting.

Where did you drive the S2k on the track?

the high pitched whining the engine ran at was irritating as hell. I

If it's going to become a 6 year degree or something fine, but I don't
think students can really afford that.

Also narrowly define oneself is fine if one wants to work at the same
company for life or have only a narrow scope of jobs available to them.
But to narrow one's self down to say injection mold tool design really
limits the options as it goes in-mass over to china. It's best to gain
expertise in several areas else come down-sizing time it's going to
really hurt.

That said, however there are engineering schools that do offer
engineering degrees that are completely geared to one aspect
of mechanical engineering. I worked with two guys who got degrees
in plastics engineering. Their whole world was plastics, but what
did the company do with one? assigned him to make test fixtures for
the factory... in machined metal, a combination of manufacturing
engineering and measurment systems.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That figure doesn't address the &quot;why&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In the US, children who have children do incredibly stupid things to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their bodies while they are pregnant, starting with a lack of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pre-natal care because they don't want to tell their parents they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pregnant. Then add drugs to teh mix, and the babies are pre-mature and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sick when born.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Some neo-natal ICU units are actually getting 22-week term babies to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;survive; The problem is that there are so many of them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We DO have the best health care in the US, but the infant mortality
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rate reflects the sad state of the way mothers treat their pregnancy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;much more than the state of health care offered.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So we have good health care and crappy social care? And you think that is
&gt;&gt;&gt;a good thing?

&gt;&gt;What's &quot;social care&quot;?

&gt;Care for the society on the whole. When children are having unprotected
&gt;sex and are unwilling to consult adults. When children are doing drugs in
&gt;a manner to harm themselves and others.

&gt;Children are being raised poorly, and you seem to not care, other than it
&gt;making a convenient excuse for infant mortality rate being worse than
&gt;countries with worse health care.

"/> I don't care?
You, sir, are grasping at straws, because you don't know shit about
what you're talking about.
As usual.

Part of my point is (that I didn't make very clear in my original post) that
in the 25 years that I've been driving, we've gone from being a relatively
defensive &amp; courteous type of driving to a much more offensive, &quot;I don't
give a crap about you, get outta my way&quot; type of driving. If people
standing in line at a bank treated each other the same way they do when
they're behind the wheel, there would be a freakin' riot at every bank every
day. What is it about getting behind the wheel of a car/truck/suv that
causes people to lose all consideration for other people? We *DO* realize
those are people in those other cars, right?

then I'll be doing the same thing. People driving too slow in *any* lane
are just as hazardous as any other bad driving habit. The point is, if I'm
in my truck, in the right lane, doing the same speed as everyone else, you
will probably come up behind me, and feel the need to pass, just because I'm
in a truck. And if you're like a lot of people (and maybe you're not), I'm
going to end up with less following distance and have to brake harder than I
would otherwise have to, because of the decision *you* made to do that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mortality rates?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;24th.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That figure doesn't address the &quot;why&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In the US, children who have children do incredibly stupid things to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their bodies while they are pregnant, starting with a lack of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pre-natal care because they don't want to tell their parents they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pregnant. Then add drugs to teh mix, and the babies are pre-mature and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sick when born.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Some neo-natal ICU units are actually getting 22-week term babies to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;survive; The problem is that there are so many of them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We DO have the best health care in the US, but the infant mortality

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;much more than the state of health care offered.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So we have good health care and crappy social care? And you think that is

&gt;&gt;&gt;What's &quot;social care&quot;?

&gt;&gt;Care for the society on the whole. When children are having unprotected
&gt;&gt;sex and are unwilling to consult adults. When children are doing drugs in
&gt;&gt;a manner to harm themselves and others.

&gt;&gt;Children are being raised poorly, and you seem to not care, other than it
&gt;&gt;making a convenient excuse for infant mortality rate being worse than
&gt;&gt;countries with worse health care.

&gt;I don't care?
&gt;You, sir, are grasping at straws, because you don't know shit about
&gt;what you're talking about.
&gt;As usual.

"/> Mental health is health. You are claiming that health care isn't bad
because the infant health care is good. But that the stats are bad because
the mental health care of the parents is poor.

Bad health care is bad health care. If you are talking strictly medical
expertise, I'd agree. We are second to none. However, the care given to
the general health of a person is grossly lacking, and is represented well
by the excessively high infant mortality rate.

You are correct, for example Ford didn't pay federal income taxes
in 2001 but it was because they had an annual LOSS, not profits.
Every American corporation making a profit pays federal INCOME
taxes. Enron is a commodity corporation that did not earn profits
because they reinvested their income in energy futures. When the
market for energy dropped they went into bankruptcy. By the way
no one from Enron has been indicted because they did nothing
illegal. Japanese corporations operating in the US do not pay
any INCOME taxes on the profits the earn in the US. I would not
tell anyone what to buy, its your money spend it were you wish,
but personally I would not buy a Ford built in Mexico or a Honda
assembled in Ohio. I own a 2003 Mustang GT convertible and a
2002 Lincoln LS both of which are built in America of primarily
American parts by an American corporation. I bought many foreign
cars prior to 1997 but when I realized that by doing that I was
hurting the county that my children and grandchildren must earn a
living. I stopped doing it. By the way I find my last six
domestic vehicles to be just as good as any Japanese vehicle I
have owned and they cost a lot less to buy and replace. My first
Lincoln LS V8 cost $20,000 less than it would have cost me to buy
another V8 Lexus at the time.

That may be your opinion but if you had ever been in the Harley
plant in York Pa you would see they build them as fast as quality
control will allow. If you get around us bikers often enough,
three things will become obvious. The longer the guy is a biker
the more likely he will get a helmet that does not cover his
face, that eventually he will get one that does not cover his
ears and without a doubt he will end up buying a Harley. When I
fist joined our cycle club over forty years ago we met at the
Honda dealers, because we all owned Hondas. Today out of sixty
some members there are only about sixteen that do not own
Harleys. The guys that don't are young guys still with the full
face helmets and even some of them are buying BMWs ;)

&gt;&gt; Is It Moral to Drive a Gas-Guzzling Vehicle?

&gt;&gt; By Your Voices
&gt;&gt; Sunday, February 2, 2003; Page C11

&gt;&gt; I agree with religious leaders who say it is morally
&gt;&gt; irresponsible to drive an SUV. There are at least three moral
&gt;&gt; issues here: failure to steward the Earth's resources, greed in
&gt;&gt; taking a far larger share of these resources than is equitable,
&gt;&gt; and failure to consider or care about the potential physical
&gt;&gt; harm to others from such a large, heavy, and higher vehicle.

&gt;&gt; In several places in the Bible, we are told to be stewards of
&gt;&gt; the Earth. Despoiling it with oil rigs and squandering its
&gt;&gt; resources is not stewardship. We are all guilty, but SUV
&gt;&gt; drivers more so because of the SUV's lousy gas mileage.

&gt;&gt; I believe people who drive larger, gas guzzlers should be
&gt;&gt; made to pay higher prices for gasoline.

&gt;&gt; Each gas station should have three lines - one for compact
&gt;&gt; cars, one for medium sized cars and one for SUV's.

&gt;&gt; Compact: $1.00 per gallon
&gt;&gt; Medium: $1.75 per gallon
&gt;&gt; SUV's: $2.50 per gallon

&gt;&gt; And enjoy your expensive ride. Quit robbing our natural resources.

&gt;&gt; -Jack

&gt; Jack,

&gt; I'm just curious. How much do you think about the environment in your
&gt; everyday life? Do you carpool? Do your recyle? Those are good starts,
&gt; but they aren't all you can do for the environment on your own. Do you
&gt; avoid buying goods made in places where polution laws are lax or
&gt; non-existant?

&gt; I'm amazed at how many &quot;environmentalists&quot; think nothing of buying
&gt; goods made in China (one of the biggest polluters on the planet),
&gt; India or other third world locations because these are the cheapest
&gt; goods available. They do this even when similar competing goods are
&gt; available that are of higher quality and that are made in more
&gt; environmentally responsible locations like the United States, Canada
&gt; and western Europe. These &quot;environmentalists&quot; actually care very
&gt; little about the environment. They certainly won't spend any of their
&gt; own money to help save the planet. They just want the power to tell
&gt; others what to do. They couch their quest for power as &quot;caring about
&gt; the environment,&quot; but in reality, by their actions, they really don't
&gt; try to save the environment themselves. They just want to force others
&gt; to be environmentally friendly. They rarely take personal action to
&gt; protect the environment.

&gt; So, Jack, do you put your money where your words are? Or are you a
&gt; hypocrite who just wants to tell others what they can and can't do, or
&gt; what you think they should do.

&gt;| &gt;When they are driven outside of VTEC, they are even more torqueless. The

&gt;Well geeze, George. Embarrassment? LOL.

&gt;I have a bunch of seat time in my dad's S2000, on the road and at the
&gt;track, so I'm quite familiar with VTEC range, its relative lack of torque,
&gt;and the way that it drives.

&gt;What's your excuse?

"/>&lt;sigh&gt; VTEC is a system which allows changing cam profiles according to
engine load and rpms - there's no such thing as a VTEC range. You are
always on one of the cam profiles for any given valve actuation - you can
be on a low profile cam or a high profile cam - both are part of the VTEC
system. BTW I believe the S2000 is an i-VTEC engine so it also has
variable timing at the pulley for the inlet cam.

The only torque that matters is where the rubber meets the road. You have
a right to prefer an engine/drive train suystem which requires less active
driver input and comes with the necessary compromises in weight
distribution and handling. IOW don't blame the car because it doesn't suit
your umm, preferences.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I bet you also think &quot;we have the best heathcare system in the world&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So where does the U.S. rank among industrialized countries in infant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mortality rates?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;24th.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That figure doesn't address the &quot;why&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In the US, children who have children do incredibly stupid things to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their bodies while they are pregnant, starting with a lack of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pre-natal care because they don't want to tell their parents they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pregnant. Then add drugs to teh mix, and the babies are pre-mature and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sick when born.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Some neo-natal ICU units are actually getting 22-week term babies to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;survive; The problem is that there are so many of them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We DO have the best health care in the US, but the infant mortality
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rate reflects the sad state of the way mothers treat their pregnancy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;much more than the state of health care offered.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So we have good health care and crappy social care? And you think that is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a good thing?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What's &quot;social care&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Care for the society on the whole. When children are having unprotected
&gt;&gt;&gt;sex and are unwilling to consult adults. When children are doing drugs in
&gt;&gt;&gt;a manner to harm themselves and others.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Children are being raised poorly, and you seem to not care, other than it
&gt;&gt;&gt;making a convenient excuse for infant mortality rate being worse than
&gt;&gt;&gt;countries with worse health care.

&gt;&gt;I don't care?
&gt;&gt;You, sir, are grasping at straws, because you don't know shit about
&gt;&gt;what you're talking about.
&gt;&gt;As usual.

&gt;Mental health is health. You are claiming that health care isn't bad
&gt;because the infant health care is good. But that the stats are bad because
&gt;the mental health care of the parents is poor.

&gt;Bad health care is bad health care. If you are talking strictly medical
&gt;expertise, I'd agree. We are second to none. However, the care given to
&gt;the general health of a person is grossly lacking, and is represented well
&gt;by the excessively high infant mortality rate.

"/> In this country (the US) we can't force people to consult with their
parents.
This isn't a case of health care, but rather the more-or-less normal
state of affairs with adolescents.

"/> 1) On most major highways, there is too much traffic most of the time to
use the second-to-right lane just for passing. That is why highways
are built with three and more lanes! We don't pay for extra lanes
on highways with the expectation that they will not be used. I
wouldn't put it past our pork-loving bureaucracies, but on the whole,
I think generally roads are rarely wider than they _need_ to be. If
a highway has four lanes, then, expecting everyone to use only the
two right lanes (one only for passing) is just silly.

2) Changing lanes increases the likelihood that you will not be where
another driver expects you to be. All other things being equal, a
driver who changes lanes frequently will be involved in more
accidents. If we are to keep right except to pass, this strategy
must offset the danger caused by changing lanes more frequently.
Off the top of my head I don't see any compelling evidence that it
does provide a net increase in safety.

3) Simply by staying in the right lane, you are making it more difficult
(i.e. dangerous) for those entering the highway to merge. The more
cars are in the lane you're merging into, the less space there is
for you and the more risk there is. If everyone stayed in the right
lane even when there was no real need to, merging would be VERY
dangerous indeed. It is already one of the most dangerous parts of
highway driving.

4) You can't control other people; you can only control yourself. Thus
whether you believe &quot;everyone&quot; can keep right except to pass is
utterly irrelevant to what you should &quot;expect.&quot; You should _expect_
other drivers to be actively trying to kill you and be pleasantly
surprised when it turns out that they are not. ;)

"/> 4 wheel drums have plenty of stopping ability, often more than disks due to
the design of drum brakes. Of course this is all assuming the drums are of
sufficient size for the car. Their only bad point is that they will heat up
quickly, like when coming to an abrupt stop from highway speeds or making
many hard(ish) stops rapidly from lower speeds. If you're Mav has such bad
brakes that you fear you cannot stop quickly enough in an emergency
situation (i.e. moronic drivers who need a good kick in the teeth cutting
you off), then I suggest you upgrade your brakes. My two Galaxies have
11&quot;x2.5&quot; drums, which stop them very well, about as quick as my dad's Geo
stops. Pretty impressive. Coming to an _abrupt_ stop from 70+ MPH though, is
when they will heat up and get hard, not stopping as quickly. I mean abrupt
stop, not normal stop.

I'm guessing your Maverick has those little 10&quot; drums, maybe even 9&quot; as it's
a small car.If I were you I would see if I could grab the front backing
plates and drums off of a full-size Ford at one of your local yards and put
them on your Maverick. I know station wagons had 11&quot;x3&quot; drums, was something
I was considering swapping to my cars if I ever come across a suitable
donor. Much cheaper than going to disks, and would make the car a lot safer.
It's an easier swap to if you can use your original spindles. Just a
thought, worth considering anyway.

I don't know what the deal is with this monster thread, but I
can tell there's some debate about good drivers vs bad drivers
and the so called American &quot;me first, FU&quot; attitude.

I recently visited Taiwan, and it has given me a much greater
appreciation that American drivers are generally polite and
orderly. Really. If you're trying to pull into traffic, it doesn't
matter how bad the traffic is--someone will let you in. American
drivers give big rigs and motorcycles extra room as a matter
of common sense. Tailgating is uncommon enough that it's
simply considered rude and unsafe. The overall result is that
our traffic is relatively smooth and fast.

Traffic in Taiwan, in contrast, is a perfect exemplification of
the &quot;everyone for him/herself&quot; attitude. There are practically
no rules of the road, other than be ready to dodge anything
anytime anywhere. All of the road symbols and traffic lights
are the same as in the US, but they're treated as mere suggestions.
All modes of transportation, from busses to mopeds to
PEDESTRIANS are treated absolutely equal. You NEVER
wait for an opening to enter traffic or change lanes, because
no one will ever offer an opening. Instead, you just go--others
will dodge out of the way to accomodate you. (Honestly, this
is really how it works. I read it on the Internet before visiting
Taiwan and didn't really believe it until I got there.) Tailgating
is the norm, because the smallest opening is an invitation for
masses of mopeds to bunch in in front of you. Needless to say,
this results in a constant heave-ho accelerate-brake cycle.

The overall result? I'd wager Taiwanese drivers are among
the most skilled in the world. It's like they have eyes in the
back of their heads and reflexes of a housefly. Unfortunately,
the only way they manage to survive is that the average speed
of traffic is SLOW. It only feels fast because it's so hectic.

I've been all across America and everyone seems to think
their drivers are the worst. They're not. In my experience,
it's more or less the same all across America, and American
drivers are generally pretty considerate.

BTW, you'd think that the massive popularity of gas-sipping
mopeds in Taiwan would make it an environmentalist's dream.
It isn't. The polution is so bad that some places are trying to
restrict/ban those mopeds.

"/> One of the (dis)advantages of growing old(er) is that you remember the way
things used to be before they became the way they are now.

It used to be, for instance, that car radiator fans were belt driven, ran
whenever the car was turned on, and spun faster the faster the engine was
revving (which tends to be the opposite of what we need the fan for in the
first place). After the Arab Oil Embargo of the 1970's, one of the fuel
economy measures that was built into cars was today's system - the fan is
now temperature controlled, and runs only when needed. So the fan tends to
run when you're idling at a red light and not moving, but on the highway,
the wind of your speed flowing through the radiator is enough to keep the
engine cooled to the right temperature and the fan shuts off, saving gas.
It has the additional benefit that cars are much less likely to &quot;boil over&quot;
when sitting at idle for an extended time, but that was not the original
intent.

Similarly, it used to be that auto air conditioning ran when it ran, without
regard to the gear the car was in or how close the pedal was to the metal.
Kicking the compressor off during heavy acceleration was introduced as a
fuel economy measure - the engine didn't have to simultaneously accelerate
the mass of the car and run the compressor, resulting in an upward tick in
the fuel economy numbers. That also means there's an increase in
performance if you define that word as quicker acceleration, but performance
was not the original intent.

I think Marc just doesn't feel comfortable revving an engine above 4,000

you shifted an S-2000 at 3,500 RPM it'd seem pretty sluggish.

I would suggest you search the IRS site and get yourself educated
before you make anymore foolish statements like that. Japanese
corporations that operate holding companies in the US receive
dollar for dollar tax credit for taxes paid in Japan. As a
result they have no tax liability on profits earned in the US,
period. Many US corporation are moving their corporate
headquarters off shore to gain the same tax advantages, so they
can compete. 250 in just the past five years. One senator wants
legislation to change the practice or at least prevent foreign
corporations for selling to the government or to any government
contractor. The problem is even the military buys from foreign
governments. I wonder what will happen when we go to war.

end up stuck in or behind this rolling road block with each passing second.
Durring peak travel times these are one of the sources of what becomes
bumper to bumper to bumper crawling traffic. With keep right except to pass
the faster traffic gets through without being added to the clump.
This increases the throughput of the road and reduces/prevents congrestion.

I'm not going to continue to debate somtning that is factual
simply because you are uninformed. They get state subsidies in
some instances but not federal and they get tax deductions like
every other corporation but they also get tax CREDITS. Again I
would suggest you search the IRS site. You can also get
information for the Japanese stock market site. The taxes paid
to the federal government by public corporations is public record
in the US. The amounts are list there to see. Honda pays zero,
as does Toyota. The amount of tax paid by GM and Fords are
listed, although Ford had a loss in 2001 and therefore no tax
liability. Japanese corporations do pay taxes in Europe because
of the difference in tax laws there. That is one reason they are
much less successful in Europe, they don't have the tax advantage
they have in the US.

&gt;&gt; corporations that operate holding companies in the US receive
&gt;&gt; dollar for dollar tax credit for taxes paid in Japan. As a

&gt; taxes paid overseas (its no dollar for dollar due to borrowings at home). A

&gt; the US (doesn't happen for US tax law) then you don't get credits for other
&gt; taxes not related to US operations. The main way to avoid taxes is through
&gt; transfer pricing such as selling parts to the US sub at such a high price
&gt; that they (the US sub) doesn't make money. Second would be by capitalizing
&gt; them with mainly debt to get very high interest payments. All these are
&gt; known to the IRS. US companies moving off shore is due to the fact that
&gt; they don't get a dollar for dollar credit and have to pay on profits that
&gt; never come to the US. Unless you're viewing Honda, et al, US tax returns
&gt; you can't say if they pay taxes in the US.

&gt;&gt; Many US corporation are moving their corporate
&gt;&gt; headquarters off shore to gain the same tax advantages, so they
&gt;&gt; can compete. 250 in just the past five years. One senator wants

"/> Your survival had nothing to do with you driving a SUV and everything
to do with you driving a heavier vehicle than the Camero. That is
simple physics. There are very few vehicles around that are heavier
than your Yukon. If you had a head on with another Yukon, you would
most likely both be dead.

There is a University of California study that found that SUVs are the
second deadliest vehicles around. When you look at deaths per
accidents, only sports cars have a higher death rate than SUVs. One
reason is that a SUV is 4 times more likely to have a rollover
accident and those accidents account for 1/3 of traffic deaths. So it
is not those Cameros you have to worry about. It is you in a single
vehicle accident caused by driving too fast around a curve because you
think it is safe to do so in your Yukon.

&gt;&gt;&gt;One of the (dis)advantages of growing old(er) is that you remember the
&gt; way
&gt;&gt;&gt;things used to be before they became the way they are now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It used to be, for instance, that car radiator fans were belt driven,
ran
&gt;&gt;&gt;whenever the car was turned on

&gt;&gt; Even with a belt, there was a clutch to engage/disengage the fan.
&gt;&gt; see:  http://yarchive.net/car/fan_clutch.html

&gt; (snip)
&gt; minor nitpick- before electric radiator fans, clutches were extremely
rare.
&gt; 240Z car evidently had one, but no traditional RWD American car I ever saw
&gt; or worked on did. Fan blade was hardmounted to front of waterpump- if
engine
&gt; was spinning, fan was spinning, as long as belt didn't break. Your
'ancient'
&gt; Ford Tempo was modern format- FWD sidewinder engine. It HAD to use an
&gt; electric fan, since the front of the engine pointed to the side of the

"/> car.

ISTR some audis or volkswagens using a transverse engine, with the radiator
facing the side.

"/> The Ford Econoline and Ford Crown Victoria I had both had fan clutches.
They were a metal finned thing built into the fan hub. If you tried
to turn the fan by hand with the engine off and cold, it would turn
independendtly of the water pump/belt pulley. If the radiator was good
and hot, it would be locked to the shaft.

people that aren't consulting their parents. It is the people that have no
parents or whose parents don't care (or are afraid of their safety if they
were to consult their parents).

And I think that if people were forced to consult their parents, the
situation may not improve.

It's only a matter of time before the infection crosses into domestic
cattle - the &quot;species barrier&quot; is known to be weak. There *have* been
deaths from prion disease in the U.S. and it *is* known that people
diagnosed with Alzheimer's really had a spongiform encephalopothy.

Even the blood supply has been compromised by some hunting enthusiast in
Utah who regularly ate the venison and who got his pocket money, while in
college, from weekly visits to the blood bank. He is dead... from CJD...
at age 30. Some of his blood apparently ended up in Canada and the
Canadian health authorities have refused to trace/dump it, bar the plasma.

The rendering companies in the U.S. are clamoring to process the carcasses
of culled CWD infected deer. U.S. cattle are fed a variety of feedstuffs
over their lifetime, including animal protein enriched feed. It's also
standard practice in deer and elk farms - don't even think about eating
venison of unknown source just now. The U.S. and state govts., like the
U.K. govt. did, are burying their heads in the sand and refusing to ban the
practice of feeding animal protein to various livestock.

It's possible that there are many farms which, especially for beef cattle,
feed only vegetable matter but the favorite American snack very often comes
from dairy cattle carcass, where animal protein is a standard feed. It's
also a fact that prions are virtually indestructible - they even survive
fire - and that one method of transfer is through take up of faecal residue
in grazing pasture land.

I hate to see this thread drift even further but right now, the U.S. and
Canada are playing with... umm, prions - much more dangerous than fire.:-(

pretty good about everyone going 70+ mph at 1/2 second following distance.
In Dallas, I've counted 6 cars in a 2s span at 70 mph or so. That was a
little tighter than usual, as usually it was more like 3-4 in a 2s span in
high-speed high-congestion times.

But when the speeds shrink, the effect of the length of the cars
themselves, as well as disproportionate distances (people seem to keep
shorter time distances at high speeds than low speeds) lead to worse
utilization of the road.

slightly better...

The closest thing I've found to cattle being fed ground up cow is
this letter:  http://www.OrganicConsumers.org/madcow/warning11801.cfm
Which is a very trimmed down copy of a warning about cross contamination
of prohibited and non-prohibited material. Hard to say what it is really...

Then another letter about cross-contamination....
http://www.OrganicConsumers.org/madcow/warning8801.cfm

that states cattle are being fed ground up cow as a matter of practice,
on purpose, in the USA?

&gt;&gt; The good news is SUV sales are
&gt;&gt; flattening out and &quot;hybrid&quot; sales growing - the hybrids being essentially
&gt;&gt; station wagons, that is on a car chassis which puts their frame/bummpers
&gt;&gt; at an equal height instead of the override SUV issue. It's marketing at
&gt;&gt; work, &quot;hybrid&quot; vs station wagon.

&gt; Yes, they're station wagons just with a different spin. The
&gt; most extreme example is the Corolla Matrix, of course. It's
&gt; a Corolla station wagon, pure and simple, no matter how
&gt; you look at it. But from the advertising you'd think it was
&gt; some bizarre alien UFO.

"/> The Matrix/Vibe is more of a 4-door hatchback (which some manufacturers
are calling &quot;5-doors&quot; to avoid the dreaded h-word) than a station
wagon. A wagon has a squared-off back end with a rear gate that
typically folds down or outward horizontally, while the hatchback has
sloping rear glass over what would normally be the trunk (if the car
were a sedan) and a rear gate that lifts up. A wagon is also often a
bit longer than the sedan model of the same car, while a hatchback is
usually the same length.

A wagon, of course, holds the most cargo. The hatchback is a nice
compromise because it holds more than a sedan but doesn't look as dorky
as a wagon. Saab has been making them for years. In addition to the
Toyota/Pontiac twins, Ford, Mazda, Hyundai and probably a couple others
I'm not aware of are making this style now. (I bought an Elantra
hatchback myself recently.)

I don't know who the self rigteous individual is that started this thread
but I highly doubt it was an American. At any rate, if you follow the logic
of the thread then owning an Ford Escort instead of a Honda is immoral since
the escort is less efficient causing the use of more resources. In addition
the Ford Escort has a shorter lifespan creating more pollution yet again
when it is hauled to the dump.

&gt; Your survival had nothing to do with you driving a SUV and everything

&gt;of prohibited and non-prohibited material. Hard to say what it is really...

&gt;Then another letter about cross-contamination....
&gt;http://www.OrganicConsumers.org/madcow/warning8801.cfm

&gt;It's alot to weed through, could you please point out the article

"/> There *is* a lot of material, giving both the good and bad on what's

practice&quot; to feed &quot;ground up cow&quot; to cattle. There *are* also other animal
proteins in routine use where the risks are still being evaluated and early
results are very scary.

Also, the fact is that there is easily accessible info, from the above link
and others through it, on the abuses at U.S. rendering plants where the
1997 ban on feeding ruminant animal parts back to ruminants has been widely
ignored. The commingling you mention above is just part of the story,
serious enough in itself since a prion doesn't care how it gets to its
victim - it's not even alive... the mislabeling is quasi-criminal. &quot;Do not
not feed to ruminants&quot; is a simple enough label - no?

The U.S. farming industry only &quot;voluntarily&quot; refrained from using ruminant
animal parts in cattle feed in 1996. If this &quot;ban&quot; was necessary I think
it's fair to conclude that the practice was widespread before then. Given
the U.K. experience, this was kinda late... and apallingly complacent.

&quot;no US cow has come down with BSE&quot; is naive - not reported would be more
accurate... hardly the kind of thing that is easily admitted. The deer &amp;

It's only since 1997 that the U.S. has banned the feeding of ruminant
animal parts back to cattle and there are rendering companies which have
been found violating the guidelines of the ban. The current stance in the
U.S. mirrors the attitudes which resulted in the spread of the disease in
the U.K.

cases of human CJD in the U.S. which do not come close to fitting the age

there is an apalling lack of urgency about those cases, here in the U.S.

&gt;Increased THROUGHPUT reduces congestion. Increased throughput prevents

the throughput, vehicles per lane per hour is essentially constant.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I hate to see this thread drift even further but right now, the U.S. and

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd suggest you visit &lt;www.mad-cow.org&gt; for some very scary reading
&gt;&gt;&gt; material - look for the Doug McEwen story as told by his wife... oh, here
&gt;&gt;&gt; it is: &lt;http://www.mad-cow.org/99_tracie.html&gt;.
&gt;&gt;I've long become numb to scare stories. Other than that there is just
&gt;&gt;a mass of text here to weed through, but I havent yet run across anything
&gt;&gt;of US cattle being fed ground up cow. In fact I call up one that I expect
&gt;&gt;to be a real story, even these so called articles appear to be webmaster
&gt;&gt;summaries and interpetations with some quoting of the orginials.
&gt; Calling it a scare stories site is simply untrue. I'm probably more
&gt; suspicious of &quot;scientist&quot; stories than most people - evidence is on the
&gt; record here in the Honda NG - so I figure my scepticism gives me a good
&gt; perspective on weeding out the &quot;self-interest&quot; angle.

"/> Clearly the site you referenced does have an axe to grind and want to

&gt;&gt;everyone will feel they need them. I just don't have any respect for a

&gt; Both sides of the story are well reported at the site. To pretend

"/> Another story on cross contamination. Where is the purposeful
feeding of ground up cow to other cows?

This is about slip ups, paperwork errors, and idiotcy that allows some
cross-contaimation of different feed stocks but I am not seeing anything
regarding a practice, by design, of feeding ground up animals to the cows.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Following to the new site  http://www.purefood.org/madcow.htm  it seems

&gt;&gt;The closest thing I've found to cattle being fed ground up cow is
&gt;&gt;this letter:  http://www.OrganicConsumers.org/madcow/warning11801.cfm
&gt;&gt;Which is a very trimmed down copy of a warning about cross contamination
&gt;&gt;of prohibited and non-prohibited material. Hard to say what it is really...

&gt;&gt;Then another letter about cross-contamination....
&gt;&gt;http://www.OrganicConsumers.org/madcow/warning8801.cfm

&gt;&gt;It's alot to weed through, could you please point out the article
&gt;&gt;that states cattle are being fed ground up cow as a matter of practice,
&gt;&gt;on purpose, in the USA?
&gt; There *is* a lot of material, giving both the good and bad on what's
&gt; happening on both sites. I did *not* say it was currently a &quot;matter of
&gt; practice&quot; to feed &quot;ground up cow&quot; to cattle. There *are* also other animal
&gt; proteins in routine use where the risks are still being evaluated and early
&gt; results are very scary.

"/> If it's not a matter of practice, exactly what is your objection then
to my orginial statement, that cows are fed grain not ground up cow? In

goes way down. So what exactly is your difficulty with my statement,
unlikely because cows in the USA are fed grain, not ground up cow?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I your looking at the RAV4 and CRV you should really look at the

that why it outsells the other two.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Secondly, driving faster doesn't reduce congestion.
&gt;&gt;Ahem...
&gt;&gt;Increased THROUGHPUT reduces congestion. Increased throughput prevents
&gt;&gt;vehicles from building up in the system, on the road. When too many
&gt;&gt;vehicles build up in the system congestion occurs. When LLBs and the
&gt;&gt;like are not decreasing the throughput of the road system, the point
&gt;&gt;where congestion starts is pushed further back.
&gt; And that's exactly, precisely what the next paragraph addressee, even though
&gt; you think it might as well be talking about space aliens. Faster traffic
&gt; does not increase the THROUGHPUT, as you put it. Each car may be on the
&gt; road a shorter amount of time, but the distance between cars is greater, and
&gt; the throughput, vehicles per lane per hour is essentially constant.

"/> You've never driven the edens. Same average spacing at 80mph as at 40mph.
Anyway....
Throughput is vastly effected by lane discipline. A scattering of slow
drivers across all lanes causes a clump to form. Where all the those
going faster than the slow drivers end up in a clump trying to get by
this blockage. Once beyond the clump there is wide open space. The clump
is reducing the rate at which vehicles leave the system and retaining
more in the system. These clumps thereby accelerate the creation of
congestion. The clump works much like a muffler's baffles and/or filter
paper in a funnel. The scattered slow drivers reduce the space to get
by and require direction changes that slow the flow.

4wd or AWD is really useful. The rest of the year, you are stuck with the
handling, MPG, and upkeep penalties of the raised platform and more complex
drivetrain. And the rear cargo area on many of the SUVs, full size or
compact, is SMALLER than a traditional station wagon. (Especially ones with
the oh-so-trendy sloping rear roof and liftgate, like the Matrix. )

As the best choice among poor alternatives, a minivan is the best substitute
for a wagon as a hauling vehicle. But unless you have a budget to cover one
of the fancy ones with fold-flat seats, or a garage with room to store the
seats (and the physical strength to remove/reinstall them), they haul even
less cargo than a SUV.

If I was a rich man, I'd go down south and find a rust-free 20 year old RWD
wagon shell, and have it rebuilt with a modern engine. But since I'm not,
guess I'll have to get by with my $5000 used minivan for a couple more
years.

2002 US sales
Ford Escape 145,471
Honda CRV 146,266
Toyota RAV4 86,601

Of course, the Ford has worse than average reliability. The CRV is
better than average, that's why it outsells the Escape. If the Escape
follows the Focus pattern, it's sales will drop as the newness wears
off and buyers find out how unreliable it is.

&gt;&gt; I'm not going to continue to debate somtning that is factual
&gt;&gt; simply because you are uninformed. They get state subsidies in
&gt;&gt; some instances but not federal and they get tax deductions like
&gt;&gt; every other corporation but they also get tax CREDITS. Again I
&gt;&gt; would suggest you search the IRS site. You can also get
&gt;&gt; information for the Japanese stock market site. The taxes paid
&gt;&gt; to the federal government by public corporations is public record
&gt;&gt; in the US. The amounts are list there to see. Honda pays zero,
&gt;&gt; as does Toyota. The amount of tax paid by GM and Fords are
&gt;&gt; listed, although Ford had a loss in 2001 and therefore no tax
&gt;&gt; liability. Japanese corporations do pay taxes in Europe because
&gt;&gt; of the difference in tax laws there. That is one reason they are
&gt;&gt; much less successful in Europe, they don't have the tax advantage
&gt;&gt; they have in the US.

&gt;Your not going to debate because you have no proof. Explain Subpart F
&gt;income and we'll talk. That's where the credits come into play and it only
&gt;applies if they get dividends from overseas subsidiaries which doesn't occur
&gt;when you're the subsidiary. As I said transfer pricing is the method. You
&gt;can't get this off the sound bits on CNN etc, you need to spend time with
&gt;international tax lawyers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would suggest you search the IRS site and get yourself educated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before you make anymore foolish statements like that. Japanese
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; corporations that operate holding companies in the US receive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dollar for dollar tax credit for taxes paid in Japan. As a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; result they have no tax liability on profits earned in the US,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; period.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You should try reading it again in English. US companies get tax credit
&gt;for
&gt;&gt;&gt; taxes paid overseas (its no dollar for dollar due to borrowings at
&gt;home). A
&gt;&gt;&gt; foreign tax payer would only get that credit for subsidiaries of the US
&gt;&gt;&gt; portions of the japanese companies. Unless the Entire Company is taxed
&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the US (doesn't happen for US tax law) then you don't get credits for
&gt;other
&gt;&gt;&gt; taxes not related to US operations. The main way to avoid taxes is
&gt;through
&gt;&gt;&gt; transfer pricing such as selling parts to the US sub at such a high
&gt;price
&gt;&gt;&gt; that they (the US sub) doesn't make money. Second would be by
&gt;capitalizing
&gt;&gt;&gt; them with mainly debt to get very high interest payments. All these are
&gt;&gt;&gt; known to the IRS. US companies moving off shore is due to the fact that
&gt;&gt;&gt; they don't get a dollar for dollar credit and have to pay on profits
&gt;that
&gt;&gt;&gt; never come to the US. Unless you're viewing Honda, et al, US tax
&gt;returns
&gt;&gt;&gt; you can't say if they pay taxes in the US.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many US corporation are moving their corporate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; headquarters off shore to gain the same tax advantages, so they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can compete. 250 in just the past five years. One senator wants
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; legislation to change the practice or at least prevent foreign
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; corporations for selling to the government or to any government
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contractor. The problem is even the military buys from foreign
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; governments. I wonder what will happen when we go to war.

&gt; You've never driven the edens. Same average spacing at 80mph as at 40mph.
&gt; Anyway....
&gt; Throughput is vastly effected by lane discipline. A scattering of slow
&gt; drivers across all lanes causes a clump to form. Where all the those
&gt; going faster than the slow drivers end up in a clump trying to get by
&gt; this blockage. Once beyond the clump there is wide open space. The clump
&gt; is reducing the rate at which vehicles leave the system and retaining
&gt; more in the system. These clumps thereby accelerate the creation of
&gt; congestion. The clump works much like a muffler's baffles and/or filter
&gt; paper in a funnel. The scattered slow drivers reduce the space to get
&gt; by and require direction changes that slow the flow.

"/> Reminds me of the Zen Driving sermon I gave my younger siblings when I
taught them to drive- traffic is a fluid, and anything that disrupts the
smooth flow of that fluid slows things down for everyone, and increases
risk. Become one with the traffic, neither faster or slower, and avoid
whenever possible doing anything that will require anyone else to change
speed or direction.

I'd suggest you read and inform yourself further about such things as the

reading on the subject.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Following to the new site  http://www.purefood.org/madcow.htm  it seems
&gt;&gt;&gt;slightly better...

&gt;&gt;&gt;The closest thing I've found to cattle being fed ground up cow is
&gt;&gt;&gt;this letter:  http://www.OrganicConsumers.org/madcow/warning11801.cfm
&gt;&gt;&gt;Which is a very trimmed down copy of a warning about cross contamination
&gt;&gt;&gt;of prohibited and non-prohibited material. Hard to say what it is really...

&gt;&gt;&gt;Then another letter about cross-contamination....
&gt;&gt;&gt;http://www.OrganicConsumers.org/madcow/warning8801.cfm

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's alot to weed through, could you please point out the article
&gt;&gt;&gt;that states cattle are being fed ground up cow as a matter of practice,
&gt;&gt;&gt;on purpose, in the USA?

&gt;&gt; There *is* a lot of material, giving both the good and bad on what's
&gt;&gt; happening on both sites. I did *not* say it was currently a &quot;matter of
&gt;&gt; practice&quot; to feed &quot;ground up cow&quot; to cattle. There *are* also other animal
&gt;&gt; proteins in routine use where the risks are still being evaluated and early
&gt;&gt; results are very scary.

&gt;If it's not a matter of practice, exactly what is your objection then
&gt;to my orginial statement, that cows are fed grain not ground up cow?

"/> Your ignorance or naivete on the subject notwithstanding, U.S. cattle are
currently fed on a diet which includes other things besides &quot;grain&quot; -
everything from potato skins to ground up fish, pig and poultry parts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In
&gt;the UK it was standard practice, hence the problems. If in the USA there
&gt;is some cross contamination due to idiotcy and not practice the likelyhood
&gt;goes way down. So what exactly is your difficulty with my statement,
&gt;unlikely because cows in the USA are fed grain, not ground up cow?

"/> You are simply wrong - get the facts on what cows are fed in the U.S. -
it's grain plus other things. Grain, potato skins and other waste
vegetable matter are used for &quot;finishing&quot;. Actually grain is not a natural
food for ruminants and causes all kinds of digestive problems which require
medicated intervention.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Also, the fact is that there is easily accessible info, from the above link
&gt;&gt; and others through it, on the abuses at U.S. rendering plants where the
&gt;&gt; 1997 ban on feeding ruminant animal parts back to ruminants has been widely
&gt;&gt; ignored.

&gt;Easily accessible? Ok, which of the 7,651+ articles they claim to have
&gt;is it? And that's just the old site. There's no search, just a two collom
&gt;list of links with partical titles and links to the archives. Where?
&gt;what is easily accessible mean? It appears to you to means for those
&gt;who have checked the website daily since 1996 who know where everything
&gt;is. Your insults on me not finding YOUR supporting cites is nothing more
&gt;than diversion.

"/> But you've just justified my &quot;insults&quot;. A search link (actually to Google)
is right in front of your face. A click on the News Archives link has
instructions on how to proceed... for those who can't figure it out for

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The commingling you mention above is just part of the story,
&gt;&gt; serious enough in itself since a prion doesn't care how it gets to its
&gt;&gt; victim - it's not even alive... the mislabeling is quasi-criminal. &quot;Do not
&gt;&gt; not feed to ruminants&quot; is a simple enough label - no?

&gt;You are trying to turn this into something it's not. US cattle are not
&gt;fed ground up cow by practice and intent correct? Then you should have
&gt;no objection that it is much less likely for US cattle to be infected
&gt;than cattle that are fed ground up cow on purpose.

"/> Ok let's say that cattle in the U.S. are not currently fed ground up cow...
uhh, intentionally that is and mislabeling apart. The facts support that
they were... otherwise it wouldn't have to be banned, first voluntarily and
then by govt. order. Again you can be obtuse if you like but the necessity
of a govt. order seems to indicate to me that the voluntary restrictions
were not sufficiently effective. The fact that the govt. orders are being
flouted further confirms it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The U.S. farming industry only &quot;voluntarily&quot; refrained from using ruminant
&gt;&gt; animal parts in cattle feed in 1996. If this &quot;ban&quot; was necessary I think
&gt;&gt; it's fair to conclude that the practice was widespread before then. Given
&gt;&gt; the U.K. experience, this was kinda late... and apallingly complacent.

&gt;You are making assumptions. SHOW ME it was widespread, because on what I
&gt;have heard/seen/read on the subject it wasn't.

Yesterday I was stuck in a parking structure for 20 minutes. The
reason? Well over half of the vehicles trying to get out were SUVs,
which are not allowed on the express exit ramps. (They're too tall, and
can't turn sharp enough.) They backed up traffic so badly the car
drivers couldn't get to the express ramps either.

Actually the comment was made by me and I'm quite comfortable revving the
S2000 to redline. Been there and done that as they say.

And yes, the S2000 is relatively anemic, even at 0-60 in 5.5, especially
considering 0-100 in 14 something seconds. Like I noted before, I like
something with more torque, especially more torque that is useful in lower
rpm ranges, and something that is faster.

The S2000, while it's a fun little car, just doesn't provide that neck
snapping acceleration from apex to exit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this letter:  http://www.OrganicConsumers.org/madcow/warning11801.cfm

&gt;&gt;&gt; There *is* a lot of material, giving both the good and bad on what's

&gt;&gt;&gt; proteins in routine use where the risks are still being evaluated and early
&gt;&gt;&gt; results are very scary.

&gt;&gt;If it's not a matter of practice, exactly what is your objection then
&gt;&gt;to my orginial statement, that cows are fed grain not ground up cow?
&gt; Your ignorance or naivete on the subject notwithstanding, U.S. cattle are
&gt; currently fed on a diet which includes other things besides &quot;grain&quot; -

&gt; You are simply wrong - get the facts on what cows are fed in the U.S. -
&gt; it's grain plus other things. Grain, potato skins and other waste

&gt;&gt;&gt; The good news is SUV sales are
&gt;&gt;&gt; flattening out and &quot;hybrid&quot; sales growing - the hybrids being essentially
&gt;&gt;&gt; station wagons, that is on a car chassis which puts their frame/bummpers
&gt;&gt;&gt; at an equal height instead of the override SUV issue. It's marketing at
&gt;&gt;&gt; work, &quot;hybrid&quot; vs station wagon.

&gt;&gt; Yes, they're station wagons just with a different spin. The
&gt;&gt; most extreme example is the Corolla Matrix, of course. It's
&gt;&gt; a Corolla station wagon, pure and simple, no matter how
&gt;&gt; you look at it. But from the advertising you'd think it was
&gt;&gt; some bizarre alien UFO.

&gt;The Matrix/Vibe is more of a 4-door hatchback (which some manufacturers
&gt;are calling &quot;5-doors&quot; to avoid the dreaded h-word) than a station
&gt;wagon. A wagon has a squared-off back end with a rear gate that
&gt;typically folds down or outward horizontally, while the hatchback has
&gt;sloping rear glass over what would normally be the trunk (if the car
&gt;were a sedan) and a rear gate that lifts up. A wagon is also often a
&gt;bit longer than the sedan model of the same car, while a hatchback is
&gt;usually the same length.

&gt;A wagon, of course, holds the most cargo. The hatchback is a nice
&gt;compromise because it holds more than a sedan but doesn't look as dorky
&gt;as a wagon. Saab has been making them for years. In addition to the
&gt;Toyota/Pontiac twins, Ford, Mazda, Hyundai and probably a couple others
&gt;I'm not aware of are making this style now. (I bought an Elantra
&gt;hatchback myself recently.)

"/> What do I own? I bought a WRX. The rear swings up. The rear window is

I'm confused.

Yes but they LOVE all those Harleys that don't leak oil and the

You forgot to mention the bad head gaskets on Toyotas and the bad
oil seals on Honda that fry the engines, or Honda tranny and
brake problems, or the coils of VW that cause them to stall all
over the place, or the the Toyotas and BMWs that are frying the
engines with oil problems. It seems every manufacture has
problem now and again. So called superior Japanese cars is more
myth than reality from what I see in our business. Did you mean
the cold solder joints, on the IMPORTED channel selector boards,

When I think of station wagons, I sometimes find myself thinking that
it's not a REAL station wagon unless the back window rolls down. But I
imagine they did away with that some time ago due to concerns with the
exhaust getting back into the car.

I also have a hard time thinking of a wagon as a small car. Wagons
should be BIG. If it's small, it's a hatchback.

I have to admit that classifying these vehicles is harder than I
initially thought. My Elantra's definitely a hatchback; they used to
make a wagon version of the car, and it looks very different from mine.
But it's hard to pick a single feature that makes the difference that
would apply broadly across makes.

SUVs don't need snow to flip. I recall a trip around DC last fall when

I was merely suggesting for you to also look at the Escape and
compare prices. We service a lot of them and they have been great
vehicles. It's you money spend it where you wish, but if you
think imports have a lock on good vehicles you are in for a rude
awaking. We service all brands in our business and I can tell
you foreign brands have just as many problems, if not more than
domestic brands. I suppose you don't know that Toyota and Honda
also had the SAME head gasket problem? I was not a quality or
design problem by either manufacture, but one caused the the US
governments requirement to remove asbestos. All manufacture
building engine in the US over several years were affected. Ford
was the ONLY manufacture to extend the warranty
on the gasket to seven years 100,000 miles, however. Most simply
washed their hands, if the vehicle was out of warranty, or did
courtesy repairs if the buyer complained loudly enough.

&gt; For certain uncommon definitions of a &quot;lot&quot; less money. We
&gt; looked at most SUVs and hatchbacks within our price range,
&gt; but frankly we have had too much experience with Fords to
&gt; take the Ford models seriously.

&gt; Toyotas and Hondas cost a bit more, but for good reason.
&gt; People pay more for reliability and technical excellence. I'll
&gt; take a Honda 4 cylinder over a Ford 6 cylinder any day!

&gt; This is coming from someone who's just had his wife's '95
&gt; Mustang blow its head gasket. This vehicle has been recalled
&gt; twice already, and apparently the head gasket was &quot;sort of&quot;
&gt; recalled. The Ford dealer didn't care to inform my wife
&gt; about the head gasket issue either time the Mustang was
&gt; recalled.

I don't know where you come up with your numbers but
'Automotive News,' the bible of the industry, list Escape as #1,
CRV #2, and RAV4 #3. You have posted bogus percentages in the
past, like domestic have on 46% of vehicle sales when it is
actually the percentage of CAR sales not total vehicle sales, so
I can only imagine. I don't know were you get you ratings either,
but our real world fleet records show the Escape has not had any
major problems any more than have the Honda or Toyota. What is
average? Set's see brand 'A' the tranny died, brand 'B' a door
handle was loose and the lighter didn't work. Brand 'C' AM radio
reception poor, screw loose on door, seat latch sticks. Therefore
brand 'A' is better than average, brand 'C' worse.

&gt; Of course, the Ford has worse than average reliability. The CRV is

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I just bought a Matrix last week, and have to get used to its size and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;length after 11 years of a Mazda 323. The cargo area is superb if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;need one, which I do (dogs, trash/recycling to the dump). It feels like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a sporty pickup truck, sort of. Good mileage so far. I had a Corolla
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;years ago and was very happy with it. It's been very annoying that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;entry-level&quot; hatchback cars and hatchback wagons (the good ones) have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;disappeared in recent years. I think people buying &quot;cute utes&quot; might
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;actually want a small hatchback wagon. If so, I heartily recommend the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Matrix.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Whatever you want to call it, it's basically a the heart and soul
&gt;&gt;&gt; of a great car with a more roomy body for extra utility. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; other &quot;cute utes&quot; are the same--the popular Rav-4 is also based
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the Corolla. Anyone looking at the Rav-4 should also be looking
&gt;&gt;&gt; at the Matrix and vice-versa.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Similarly, both the CR-V and the Element are based on the Honda
&gt;&gt;&gt; Civic. We looked at all of the alternatives, and settled on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Element as fitting our needs the best. Underneath the hood, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;cute utes&quot; are based on proven car designs so really it comes
&gt;&gt;&gt; down to what passenger/cargo features suit you the best.

That's the point my friend. Those reports are for the number of
problems listed by types rather than severity. What they don't
point out is that compared to prior years most every manufacture
is having fewer and less severe problems every year, that is why
the always use the term average. It's like saying someone with
an IQ of 140 is above average simply because the two people below
in the test have an IQ of 138 and 136. The fact is they are all
pretty cars good today, the only real differanc is size, style
and price. As to C.R., there reports they are useless because of
the way they poll readers and only test a sinble vehicle. They
don't quantify that fact that the more you sell the higher number
of defects will show up even when the percentage remain the same.
I would expect Toyota figures as they drop off now that they are
selling over a million vehciles rather than just hundreds of
thousands. Hell the number and location of cup holder affect the
reports, never mind that one should not even be drinking coffee
while driving. JD Powers sells the service and it is expensive,
they make sure that most every manufacture can take something
from their surveys and run with it. If you pay their fee and get
the real numbers as we once did, you will see the vast majority
of problems today are minor. The loose screw, missing or blown
fuse, out of place trim, not rust, bad engine or tranny like ten
years ago..

"/> I found that these &quot;cute utes&quot; just don't cut it when it come to cargo
room.

We have a 70 lb. dog that travels with us. I drive an Explorer which
has just enough room, with the rear seat up, for a large dog crate.
We often strap our luggage into the back seat when the dog is in the
rear cargo area. When someone needs to sit back there for trip, we
often have to put luggage in a container on the roof (I really hate
doing that).

The &quot;cute utes&quot; have squat for cargo space. The dog crate will not
fit in most of them without lowering at least one seat.

I don't have near the need for 4WD as I used to, but it comes in
handy. I regularly used it for the first few years I had the
Explorer, but my driving needs have changed. I still need at least
3500 lbs of towing capacity. I think we will be mini-van bound next
year when I consider replacing the Explorer.

Is the Windstar still built on the Lincoln platform? My parents have
been getting a new Merc Sable every couple of years, but took a break
a while back and drove a Windstar for a while. I thought it was a
pretty nice ride ... I am looking at the utility of a vehicle before
it's &quot;style&quot; - I don't worry about being seen in a minivan.

go up in price at roughly equal rates with comparable equipment.

"/> I think you are confusing the standards of the Japanese manufacturers
attending to even small problems in their products with some high rate
of failure. Even with the reports of TSBs and extended warranties on
things like transmissions and head gaskets, the reliability ratings of
these systems is still better than the Big Three. And we don't see a
huge number of reports on these problems in the newsgroup. I looked
at the reports of head gasket failures in Honda groups and most were
on cars 12+ years old and/or 140K+ miles. I only saw one that would
have been covered under a 7/100 warranty.

Compare that with the oil burning and timing chain problems in Saturns
that went on year after year with no acknowledgement by the
manufacturer. Unlike the Honda defects, this one is clearly seen in
CR reliability ratings.

&gt; Your survival had nothing to do with you driving a SUV and everything

&gt; There is a University of California study that found that SUVs are the

&gt; accidents, only sports cars have a higher death rate than SUVs. One
&gt; reason is that a SUV is 4 times more likely to have a rollover
&gt; accident and those accidents account for 1/3 of traffic deaths. So it
&gt; is not those Cameros you have to worry about. It is you in a single

&gt; The Matrix/Vibe is more of a 4-door hatchback (which some manufacturers
&gt; are calling &quot;5-doors&quot; to avoid the dreaded h-word) than a station
&gt; wagon. A wagon has a squared-off back end with a rear gate that
&gt; typically folds down or outward horizontally, while the hatchback has
&gt; sloping rear glass over what would normally be the trunk (if the car
&gt; were a sedan) and a rear gate that lifts up. A wagon is also often a
&gt; bit longer than the sedan model of the same car, while a hatchback is
&gt; usually the same length.

&gt; A wagon, of course, holds the most cargo. The hatchback is a nice
&gt; compromise because it holds more than a sedan but doesn't look as dorky
&gt; as a wagon. Saab has been making them for years. In addition to the
&gt; Toyota/Pontiac twins, Ford, Mazda, Hyundai and probably a couple others
&gt; I'm not aware of are making this style now. (I bought an Elantra
&gt; hatchback myself recently.)

&gt; | &gt; | &gt;&quot;difficulty&quot; is that they are torqueless wonders at &quot;daily driver&quot;
&gt; RPMS
&gt; and
&gt; | &gt; | &gt;they indeed drive like a Civic, etc. in &quot;daily driver&quot; mode.
&gt; | &gt; |
&gt; | &gt; | Given that you seem to know nothing of what VTEC or Torque means.
&gt; you'd
&gt; | &gt; | save your self embarrassment if you refrained from posting.;-)
&gt; | &gt;
&gt; | &gt; Well geeze, George. Embarrassment? LOL.
&gt; | &gt;
&gt; | &gt; I have a bunch of seat time in my dad's S2000, on the road and at the
&gt; | &gt; track, so I'm quite familiar with VTEC range, its relative lack of
&gt; torque,
&gt; | &gt; and the way that it drives.
&gt; | &gt;
&gt; | &gt; What's your excuse?
&gt; |
&gt; |
&gt; | He's an unrepenetant Hondaphile. I don't know if it's an excuse, but
&gt; | it's the truth. Might make one blind to the fact that there are folks
&gt; | out there who find Honda's implementation of the automobile to be
&gt; | wanting in some respect.
&gt; |
&gt; | I have not had the pleasure of driving an S2k on the track, but have
&gt; | driven one around a larger NW U.S. city. I came away with the opinion
&gt; | that it was less fun and more work to drive than it was worth. Around
&gt; | town, I would have preferred a V6 Accord, if I had to drive around a
&gt; | Honda. Or a MY2000 Civic Si. To tell the truth, the Gen3 RX7 that I
&gt; | drove on the same streets was much more enjoyable in an urban setting.
&gt; |
&gt; | Where did you drive the S2k on the track?

&gt; Well lookey here, SBC's newserver burped this out 6 days after it was
&gt; supposedly posted. Amazing.

"/> Heh.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have driven an S2k at Buttonwillow and Thunderhill.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I've been a passenger in one at Laguna Seca and Sears Point (now Infineon)

"/> Cool. FWIW, I've always wanted an excuse to drive a genIII RX7 around
Willow Springs. I don't think I'd have the stones to go at in in
anything less than four wheels. But the folks who do make it look
like a helluva lot of fun. In any case, The S2k was an amusing enough
ride, and for the money, not to bad, but it's just not as much fun as
I think it could be with a little more &quot;go&quot;. Or a lot more. :)

accidents there's no difference in injury rates. Also, at least 94%
of crash safety is in crash avoidance, according to GM (they may have

"/> First it wasn't an 'F' chassis, rather a Ranger chassis.

Second, I had two minivans (Voyager LEs - '85 and '90) with 5-

to buy a bigger vehicle just because he's seen bigger vehicles on
the road, the decision, and the responsibility, is his alone. Or
more likely, hers. I find that more often than not, the bigger

SUVs annoy me as much as they do anybody, but for a reason that's
entirely practical: I'm getting *really* tired of spending so
much of my driving time behind vehicles that I can't see around.
Be that as it may, I stand foursquare behind people's right to

"/>  More than any other vehicle, I drive a bicycle. But I drive cars also.
Drove bikes 10K miles a year every year for 18 years, drove cars 4-5K
miles a year in the past 5.5 years. So I should have some idea how to
stay alive on the road.

In my experience, I have found that 18 wheelers and other large trucks
seem to be driven by people who drive for a living and who have a need to
keep down the points on their licenses and to have insurance with rates
they would rather minimize. Same for buses.

Those who drive more aggressively tend to drive cars, light trucks, and
SUVs. I also see plenty of aggressive cyclists, but I don't fear being
hit by a bike as much as I fear being hit by something bigger. A few
motorcyclists are reckless, but most seem to have most of the survival
instinct that most bicycle messengers that stay in that business more than
6 months have. Moped/scooter drivers are if anything more cautious.

It seems to me that those most likely to kill me or total my vehicle are
driving something with weight in the range of 2,000-8,000 pounds (900-3600
Kg). Within that range, I think heavier weight is worse for damaging my
car or my body while I am in my car.

&gt;&gt; The difference is back then they were about 15% of the vehicles on

"/>  Pickup trucks are a little more popular than they were 2-3 decades ago.
So 25% SUVs and 25% pickups and other light trucks means a lot more
trucks/SUVs now than the 15% pickups/light-trucks of back then.

I should think that all vehicles that are usually used for the purposes
that cars are usually used for need to meet the same crash safety and fuel
economy and emissions standards that cars have to meet. It may take a
while to make such regulations practical and applicable to most pickup
trucks, but it sure seems to me that a vehicle with seating for at least 4
and not registered as a commercial vehicle is a family car more than a
work tool.

while his bicycle was moving with him driving it. He could be an

to be doing that 6 months from now? NYPD is a bit famously reasonably
effective against scofflaw reckless cyclists!
And reckless cyclists to some extent eliminate themselves from the road.

And are bicycles the only vehicles driven by people who vandalize other
vehicles? What vehicles are usually driven by drivers who damage vehicles
and vehicle occupants in general, and not just with chains? Seems to me
most of the time a driver damages other vehicles and their occupants with
a weapon, the weapon is usually either a gun or the offender's vehicle and
the offender's vehicle (whether it or a gun is the weapon) is usually a
4-wheeler with weight 2,000-8,000 pounds.

I live close enough to Philadelphia to hear about enough of their
drive-by shootings, and I have only heard of one done by a cyclist since

Face it, you just don't like SUVs.
If it really were a vision thing, you'd dislike semis more, because
they are bigger.

&gt;&gt;&gt;What portion of the driving fleet is 18 wheeler? What about SUVs?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Semis are there because they have to be there, SUVs are there strictly
&gt;&gt;&gt;due to the owner's decision to drive a big vehicle. Much like wearing
&gt;&gt;&gt;a big hat to a movie.

&gt;&gt;You're doing *exactly* what the previous poster is talking about.

&gt;Perhaps in his opinion I am, and he's welcome to that opinion. It
&gt;doesn't change the fact that the vast majority of SUVs are bought as a
&gt;fashion accessory, and one that interferes with other drivers to boot.
&gt;When people are commuting in semi trucks, the 18 wheeler argument will

&gt;they don't have to meet car pollution standards nor car crash safety
&gt;standards, let alone car fuel economy standards.

.05%? How did you come to that conclusion?
Did you even think that what you see isn't anywhere near the total use
range? How many do you think are NEVER used for towing?

"/> One does not drive by the tail lamps of the vehicle directly in front
to tell what is going on ahead of them, even if one can out stop that
vehicle. Doing as you propose above makes one dependent upon
the questionable driving ability of the barn-on-wheels steerer ahead.
This is why it is important to look and be able to see further ahead,
such that one can see what the driver ahead is going to need to react
to, to plan accordingly.

If there should be something in front of the vehicle you
are following it may simply duck aside leaving you with a stationary
object too close to stop for. The only way to correct for this blindness
is increased following distance, to the point where one can stop even
if the vehicle ahead stops instantiously. Which, effectively would
occur if the vehicle ahead rear ends a stationary vehicle ahead of it.

Your technique above is therefore not on unadvisable, but a prescription
for chain-reaction

&gt;&gt;&gt; In that case, you probably need to adjust your driving such that

&gt;&gt;off to have the same vision blockage as a regular passenger car
&gt;&gt;will cause is about a half a block or more.

(Omitting any safety arguments unrelated to seeing)

On highways, there is a significant safety advantage to seeing the road
many car lengths ahead. It is all too common to be unable to stay behind
by a really safe stopping distance - gaps that big invite others into
them. (Unless you know for sure your reaction time is always up and your
tires never have worse traction than those of the vehicle in front of you
and that your brakes never distribute braking effort among your wheels
less optimally than is the case for any vehicle in front of you...)
There is such a thing as large potholes, view of which are obstructed
more by trucks than by cars, and so this seems like a good reason to not
have car-regulation exemptions for trucks being used as cars.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;God, I love it when MORONs say this.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ummm... 18-wheelers NEED to be huge so they can haul huge trailers.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is not the same as hauling a few (or often only one) bodies

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How does *need* enter into a visibility problem at all?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;18 wheelers don't make up a significant part of the driving fleet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;right now, which SUVs now do. Need enters into it because 18 wheelers

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;haul one person around.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And, as I asked, what does that have to do with the ability/inability

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Face it, you just don't like SUVs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If it really were a vision thing, you'd dislike semis more, because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they are bigger.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How many here have came out of a store to find 2 SUV's parked on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;either
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;side of their vehicle blocking their view as they tried to back out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a parking space? How many have came out and found 2 tractor trailers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;parked on either side blocking their view? That's what it has do with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the ability to see around either.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've never had my view blocked by a semi pulling up beside me as I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tried to exit a bank or parking lot. That is a daily occurance with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;SUV's.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then you need to get used to it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Adjust your driving to take reality into account.

&gt;&gt;This IS the reality. Enjoy your Explorer.

On every kind of road, not just highways.

A bright, sunny day. A wide, two-way, posted 30 MPH street with a
combination of businesses/residences and parked cars lining the right
side.

My passenger was talking and I was driving the small car at the speed
limit. Looking about three blocks ahead, I saw a young couple in their
front yard playing with two dogs. The dogs were unleashed and having the
time of their lives.

As I approached their location, I slowed to 15/20 MPH. My passenger was
perplexed and demanded to know what the heck I was doing. Nobody was
behind me at the time, but I imagine that if there had been, they would
have been as pissed as my passenger; drivers on that street often travel
40-45 MPH. At that moment, out from between the cars parked on my right
bounds a young, happy, golden retriever--right in front of my car. The
dogs' owners screamed from their yard. My passenger's jaw dropped. And I
slowed easily without mishap because I was covering the brake the whole
time. The dog ran back into the yard and the owners put him in their
backyard and looked at me with gratitude. Felt pretty good.

It wasn't precognition or anything like that. My passenger thought it
was spooky: &quot;how did you know???&quot; she asked me.

Well, I just looked, that's all. I _saw_ what I was looking at, and it
was obvious that it presented a hazard. So I took appropriate action.

The point is, I could see. There were no rolling billboards in front of
me. The problem with the plethora of large, tall vehicles on the road is
that even when following at a safe distance (using the 2-second rule), a
large swath of the smaller vehicle's driver's field of view is blocked.
This obstruction is further compounded when there are many large, tall
vehicles in oncoming traffic. *Nobody* can drive safely when they can't
see ahead.

People have asked about tractor-trailers. Well, an SUV's driver's vision
is blocked by them in much the same way as a sedan driver's vision is
blocked by large SUVs. It's a legitimate complaint that has little to do
with silly accusations of vehicle envy. It also doesn't really have a
lot to do with SUVs per se, nor so much about the way they are
driven--there are outstandingly stupid and arrogant drivers in every
kind of vehicle. No, the complaint seems to me to be far more about
traffic congestion than anything else. Big vehicles--especially huge
numbers of big vehicles--contribute proportionally more to congestion,
simply by virtue of the space they take up, so they tend to get dinged
more in conversations about congestion.

As others have pointed out repeatedly, it isn't the SUVs themselves that
make other drivers nuts; it's the sheer numbers of them encountered on a
daily basis.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But those passenger cars won't tow what the trucks &amp; SUVs do; that's

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They very well can. In one of these threads I compared the explorer to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Explorers do not define the SUV.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The explorer is representitive of the great bulk of SUVs and light
&gt;&gt;&gt;trucks for the purpose of towing capacity.

&gt;&gt; Really?
&gt;&gt; And who made this decision?

&gt;Considering it's size and production figures it's representive. You

&gt;I am sure I can find a car in the world with a comparable towing rating.

&gt;&gt; Ah, we are back to &quot;need&quot; again.
&gt;&gt; You still don't understand that as time goes on, things change.
&gt;&gt; You fail to grasp that you should change with them.

&gt;The fact remains, large numbers of trucks on the road are a change for

&gt;So much for your aspousing 'free choice' and buy what you want, you

&gt;&gt;&gt;You are confused. I proposed making it such that cars like the 2003
&gt;&gt;&gt;ford fairlane sold in austraila could be sold in great numbers in
&gt;&gt;&gt;the USA again. Simply raising truck cafe to meet passenger car cafe
&gt;&gt;&gt;would not result in that, I feel that it would cause something worse
&gt;&gt;&gt;than the SUV to take hold in the market. It is my belief that if
&gt;&gt;&gt;traditionally sized intermediates and full size with towing capability,
&gt;&gt;&gt;RWD and AWD were on the market with choices beyond senior citizen
&gt;&gt;&gt;mobilies and taxi/cop car that the SUV would return, abit slowly to
&gt;&gt;&gt;it's pre-craze levels.

&gt;&gt; It woul dindeed be nice if CAFE could be done away with.

also, when in an unregulated left turn lane, if the vehicle directly across

&gt;&gt; And I suppose a car won't?
&gt;&gt; You are so fixated on SUVs, you fail to recognize that it's the
&gt;&gt; DRIVERS who can be unsafe.

&gt; the only beef i have with them is that its difficult to see around em...
&gt; such as when backing out of a parking space.

&gt; also, when in an unregulated left turn lane, if the vehicle directly across
&gt; from you also making a left turn is a taller wider vehicle, its difficult to
&gt; gauge oncoming traffic.

&gt; i run into this problem daily.. on my scooter or motorcycle, its not bad,
&gt; since i can just creep out and check the traffic, but in a car its more
&gt; difficult.

&gt; YMMV... if i wanted a SUV, id buy one.

&gt; as for the gas price issue? anyone whos bought one since the last time gas
&gt; was $2/gal has no right to bitch... its been $2/gal before, and itll be
&gt; $2/gal again.

"/> And yet they do. Again and again. They know gas is high or will be, but
they can't resist the temptation to drive that flashy, rugged vehicle like the
the other people at the supermarket are driving.

I had a Tracker for a few years. They roll over easy (nope didn't roll mine)
and the gas mileage is horrible (about 18 in town and 20 on the freeway).

Now have a Honda Civic. There is lots of room inside and truck space too.
Like the fact the back seat folds down. We've hauled a cabinet 6 feet tall
in the car.

&gt;How so?
&gt;If I can stop in time, I can also maneuver in time.
&gt;Have you ever even tried?

"/> To be able to stop in time for all events in front of the car in front of
you, you would need to be able to completely stop in the distance between
you and the car in front of you.

If you travel like that, you are leaving excessive space, reducing the flow
of traffic on roads, and if everyone followed that, the roads would cease
being functional. If you leave less, then you will hit the car in front of
you if the were to stop instantaneously (possibly by rearending a pile of
stopped cars, like the huge pile-ups that happen in fog because people are
following the car in front at the same 2s without being able to see past).

So, if you drive without looking past the car in front of you, you are
either an unsafe driver, or you'd leave excessive space compared to a safe
driver that was looking past the car in front.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And I suppose a car won't?
&gt;&gt;&gt; You are so fixated on SUVs, you fail to recognize that it's the
&gt;&gt;&gt; DRIVERS who can be unsafe.

&gt;&gt; the only beef i have with them is that its difficult to see around em...
&gt;&gt; such as when backing out of a parking space.

&gt;&gt; also, when in an unregulated left turn lane, if the vehicle directly across
&gt;&gt; from you also making a left turn is a taller wider vehicle, its difficult to
&gt;&gt; gauge oncoming traffic.

&gt;&gt; i run into this problem daily.. on my scooter or motorcycle, its not bad,
&gt;&gt; since i can just creep out and check the traffic, but in a car its more
&gt;&gt; difficult.

&gt;&gt; YMMV... if i wanted a SUV, id buy one.

&gt;&gt; as for the gas price issue? anyone whos bought one since the last time gas
&gt;&gt; was $2/gal has no right to bitch... its been $2/gal before, and itll be
&gt;&gt; $2/gal again.

&gt;And yet they do. Again and again. They know gas is high or will be, but
&gt;they can't resist the temptation to drive that flashy, rugged vehicle like the
&gt;the other people at the supermarket are driving.

A few examples from a recent 2800 mile trip I'm just back from:

Idiot BMW driver doing about 90 in a 70, playing speed racer games in heavy
traffic. Damned near ran a Trailways bus off the road right in front of me.
Pulled over by SC State Police shortly after passing me. Saved a LOT of
time there, huh?

Some Celica slut thinking it was a bright idea to flash her tits to every
trucker she saw on the road.

Camary driver, about 105 years old, driving 45 in a 65 and causing all
sorts of problems because of it.

Beater driver towing a pop-up with their obviously underpowered piece of
junk damn near causes a multiple car pile up because they cant even stop
the rolling trash heap in the distance they were following the SUV in front
of them.

Honda whatever driver who thinks it's a good idea to drive while reading
their map. Should have been pulled over for DUI if nothing else. All over
the road, and typically oblivious to anything around them.

Suzuki Swift &lt;laughing&gt; driver whose rolling a &quot;cigarette&quot; while driving
with their knee in 80 MPH traffic.

Family of 4 in a VW Quantum Stationwagen with the back packed to the roof,
preventing use of the rear view mirror, and fighting about God knows what.
Another potential DUI stop. All OVER the road.

of miles and scores of years behind the wheel, tells me that it's you idiot

understands how to drive well. Light trucks have an overall negative
effect with regards to usage of the road system. When few in number
these negatives are trivial, however year after year of roughly half
the new vehicles being light trucks has greatly altered the make up
of the vehicle fleet to having a much greater proportion of light
trucks. In turn this has made those once trivial downsides measurable
and significant. Be it the blocking of vision, the inability to clear
intersections in a timely manner, the need for more road space to
counteract some of the vision blocking, the roll overs, the
incompatibility in collisions with passenger cars, etc and so forth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are so fixated on SUVs, you fail to recognize that it's the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DRIVERS who can be unsafe.

&gt;&gt;&gt; the only beef i have with them is that its difficult to see around em...
&gt;&gt;&gt; such as when backing out of a parking space.

&gt;&gt;&gt; also, when in an unregulated left turn lane, if the vehicle directly across
&gt;&gt;&gt; from you also making a left turn is a taller wider vehicle, its difficult to
&gt;&gt;&gt; gauge oncoming traffic.

&gt;&gt;&gt; i run into this problem daily.. on my scooter or motorcycle, its not bad,
&gt;&gt;&gt; since i can just creep out and check the traffic, but in a car its more
&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult.

&gt;&gt;&gt; YMMV... if i wanted a SUV, id buy one.

&gt;&gt;&gt; as for the gas price issue? anyone whos bought one since the last time gas
&gt;&gt;&gt; was $2/gal has no right to bitch... its been $2/gal before, and itll be
&gt;&gt;&gt; $2/gal again.

&gt;&gt;And yet they do. Again and again. They know gas is high or will be, but
&gt;&gt;they can't resist the temptation to drive that flashy, rugged vehicle like the
&gt;&gt;the other people at the supermarket are driving.

&gt; See? Again you post your envy.
&gt; If it were otherwise, you wouldn't assume that people do things for
&gt; the same reason you do them.

"/> Since you seem to be clueless as to what constitiutes envy,

1 : painful or resentful awareness of an advantage enjoyed by another
joined with a desire to possess the same advantage.

I have yet to post anything remotely close to show I have a desire
for an SUV. I see no advantage to owning one to simply commute,
get groceries, etc. If I wanted one, I would simply buy one. It's
that easy. Nothing prevents me from purchasing one except I do not 'need'
one. The majority of owners don't 'need' them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Since you seem to be clueless as to what constitiutes envy,
&gt; 1 : painful or resentful awareness of an advantage enjoyed by another
&gt; joined with a desire to possess the same advantage.

&gt; I have yet to post anything remotely close to show I have a desire
&gt; for an SUV. I see no advantage to owning one to simply commute,
&gt; get groceries, etc. If I wanted one, I would simply buy one. It's
&gt; that easy. Nothing prevents me from purchasing one except I do not 'need'
&gt; one. The majority of owners don't 'need' them.

"/> Keep in mind that one of the reasons SUV owners often bought their
passenger truck was to show off what kind of vehicle they could afford,
even if they really couldn't afford it. (why the TV news is full of
SUV drivers crying about the price of gasoline everytime it jumps a
nickle or more a gallon) These people then project their reasons
for vehicle choice on others. IE, everyone would drive an SUV if
they could afford it, everyone in their mind aspires to the same things.

The fact that probably all of us who dislike SUVs could buy one or many
for that matter doesn't seem to register with them. The concept of buying
a vehicle for handling, braking, acceleration, etc doesn't register
well with them either. They buy vehicles as a symbol of their status, and
nothing says status to them more right now than a big gussied up truck.
My guess is that if someone drove an aston martin and disliked SUVs
they would use the same 'envy' claim.

And this is where the envy arguement falls flat on it's face, for those
of US who dislike SUVs, all like expensive vehicles that aren't SUVs.
Be they aston martins, ferraris, BMWs, jaguars, etc... Vehicles which
could be claimed as 'status' symbols, but are liked. The reason is the
ability of these vehicles and their not having a negative effect on
everyone else sharing the road with them. So the envy arguement fails for
if it were emotional hate generated by envy, then the expensive
passenger cars would be hated at least as much as the cheapest SUVs.

"/> Hardly. What I did was simply defensive. Nothing aggresive about it.
Let me use a basketball anaolgy to the situation.

A defender is standing between the offensive player with the ball and
the hoop. The defender stands still and the offensive player drives too
the hoop and runs into him. A foul of charging is called on the offensive
player. The defensive player played a perfect defense, making no
aggressive move. He stood his ground.

I did as the defensive player did, held my ground. If basketball were
played by the way you would want people to drive, the defensive player
would have stepped aside and let the offensive player drive through a
clear path to the hoop. But that is what you want, others to surrender,
allowing for aggressive moves. This of course rewards aggression,
generating more of it.

In the this case, your recommendation to be would be to steer off the
road and over the curb (damaging my vehicle) to allow the aggressive move
of the SUV driver. However, the rules of the road, like the rules of
basketball place the foul on the driver who is forcing his way into a
space already occupied by another vehicle. By holding my ground there
was no damage as the aggressive driver had to back off.

I learned the value of defense on a bicycle. A bicycle is by far the
weakest vehicle on the road, and as such backing down to any other
vehicle ment a great increase in travel time, inefficency and danger.
Being defensive and confident makes for a much safer situation by not
encouraging aggressive action by rewarding them.

This driving case is a direct anology to a common cycling problem,
being squeezed off the road by operators of larger vehicles. I did
the same as I would have done on bicycle, remained on the road. Diving
off the road is certain vehicle damage and/or injury. Holding ground
rightfully on the road will most certainly get the other person to
back off. And in this case like all the others where ground was held,
no damage or injury. On bicycle when I moved aside I have been injured
and the bicycle damaged, I'll keep holding my ground, it has a much
better track record when facing an aggressive driver.

&gt;Hardly. What I did was simply defensive. Nothing aggresive about it.
&gt;Let me use a basketball anaolgy to the situation.

"/> There's nothing defensive about calling someone's bluff, when that
could very possibly lead to violence.
You are simply in dire need of counseling.
I sincerely hope you recognize this before you hurt yourself or
someone else.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;A defender is standing between the offensive player with the ball and
&gt;the hoop. The defender stands still and the offensive player drives too
&gt;the hoop and runs into him. A foul of charging is called on the offensive
&gt;player. The defensive player played a perfect defense, making no
&gt;aggressive move. He stood his ground.

&gt;I did as the defensive player did, held my ground. If basketball were
&gt;played by the way you would want people to drive, the defensive player
&gt;would have stepped aside and let the offensive player drive through a
&gt;clear path to the hoop. But that is what you want, others to surrender,
&gt;allowing for aggressive moves. This of course rewards aggression,
&gt;generating more of it.

&gt;In the this case, your recommendation to be would be to steer off the
&gt;road and over the curb (damaging my vehicle) to allow the aggressive move
&gt;of the SUV driver. However, the rules of the road, like the rules of
&gt;basketball place the foul on the driver who is forcing his way into a
&gt;space already occupied by another vehicle. By holding my ground there
&gt;was no damage as the aggressive driver had to back off.

&gt;I learned the value of defense on a bicycle. A bicycle is by far the
&gt;weakest vehicle on the road, and as such backing down to any other
&gt;vehicle ment a great increase in travel time, inefficency and danger.
&gt;Being defensive and confident makes for a much safer situation by not
&gt;encouraging aggressive action by rewarding them.

&gt;This driving case is a direct anology to a common cycling problem,
&gt;being squeezed off the road by operators of larger vehicles. I did
&gt;the same as I would have done on bicycle, remained on the road. Diving
&gt;off the road is certain vehicle damage and/or injury. Holding ground
&gt;rightfully on the road will most certainly get the other person to
&gt;back off. And in this case like all the others where ground was held,
&gt;no damage or injury. On bicycle when I moved aside I have been injured
&gt;and the bicycle damaged, I'll keep holding my ground, it has a much
&gt;better track record when facing an aggressive driver.

"/> So, what you are saying is that people should back down at the first
sign of aggression from another person. All this does is reward the
aggressor. The aggressor wanted to get ahead, and he has, it's positive
reinforcement. He will then repeat this behavior. Others who will see
the aggressive behavior rewarded and follow suit. Not to mention when
someone backs down, the aggressor will push to see how much he can
take. Holding ground initially prevents that sort of escalation.

Ever watch what happens in heavy traffic after the first aggressor
decides to use the shoulder or acceleration lane to pass people and
is let in up ahead when the shoulder narrows or the acceleration lane
ends? More people then do it. It's positive reinforcement in action.

This is bad overall, but it appears that you think good people should
'just let them do it' because one of em might have a gun or something.
Well, if that's case, then it's better to be an aggressor, with only a
moral arguement not to become one.

&quot;Because of the hitch design, all Fifth Wheels will require a pickup

the largest Fifth Wheels will require a medium-duty RV hauler. &quot;

People who need trucks will buy trucks, those who need a car

adjectives to describe them.

it. You, and every other anti-SUV poster here, use these same types of

&gt;&gt;&gt;You're right, it's probably closer to 98%. Manufacturers will tell
&gt;&gt;&gt;you that less than 5% of their vehicles are used for offroading or
&gt;&gt;&gt;other rough usage.

&gt;&gt;Offroading isn't towing.
&gt;&gt;You did know that, right? Why change the complaint?

&gt; Given that it's heavy duty use, it's a pretty safe assumption that
&gt; they see similar rates of usage.

"/> OK. For the sake of discussion, I will stipulate that my SUV is not
towing anything 99% of the time. But for that 1% of the time, I am
towing a boat that 99% of the passenger cars on the market can't tow.
And 4WD is useful for launch and recovery. That 1% contributes a lot
to my lifestyle.

My boat isn't that big. I can tow it with an Explorer. But if it
were even 50% heavier (and lots of trailer boats are heavier than
mine) I would be looking at a full size SUV or truck.

I don't know what point you are trying to make with manufacturer
estimate of vehicle usage. Less than 5% off all vehicles they sell
are used off road? What percentage of trucks or utility vehicles are
used off road? What some would call &quot;off road&quot; may differ. I would
guess that far more than 5% of SUV owners have used their SUV in a
manner they wouldn't consider in a regular passenger car, and they
have a certain level of appreciation for the ability to do so. I know
I have.

IMHO, people buy SUVs because they don't sell 6-passenger RWD station wagons
any more. Some switched to minivans, but those are actually less useful for
hauling than a wagon in most cases, because you have to yank the seats out
instead of just folding them down. And no FWD I've seen or owned seems to
hold up to 'Family Truckster' abuse as well as RWD does. Last car I owned
that I truly liked was a 1978 Ford Fairmont wagon, RWD with a 5.0 liter v8.
Abused the hell out of it, and it never gave me a lick of trouble. Nothing
since then has been as fast, as much fun to drive, or as useful in real
world. If I was a rich man, I'd search the southwest for a clean rolling
shell, and have a modern drivetrain dropped in it.

personally know at least a dozen SUV owners. And only one or two actually
tow or go offroad or whatever. Most bought them and use them as the closest
equivilant to the station wagons they grew up with. They would be perfectly
happy with a wagon, and should have had that choice available to them. They
probably would have the choice available if CAFE hadn't been imposed on us
all. Since it was, they drive heavier vehicles that get lousier mileage than
the effectively-banned wagons. Law of unintended consequences, etc.

&gt;&gt;How many SUVs on the roads do you see towing? For me, the answer is

there are other regulatory loopholes favoring SUVs over cars. SUVs can be
classified as light trucks, which do not have to meet the emissions, fuel
economy, and crash safety burdens that cars have to meet. Because of all
of these loopholes, car buyers are subsidizing buyers of light trucks (and
all SUVs that get regulatory exemptions by being classifiable as light
trucks).

engine RPM (that was about 8-10%), plus at least some of whatever
difference there was in torque that the engine had to supply. Don't have
a number for this one but it's obviously significant.

One fact: The force of aerodynamic drag is largely proportional to the
square of airspeed. Reduce airspeed by 29.3% and you half the force of
aerodynamic drag. Reduce airspeed by 10% and you reduce the drag force by
19%. And when moving steadily at 60 MPH, most of the work done by your
engine is fighting aerodynamic drag.

Sadly, they have been misled. On average, SUVs are somewhat less safe
for them, and much less safe for people outside the vehicle. And this
danger is completely unnecessary, for some car-based designs have shown
that SUVs _can_ meet car safety standards, _if_ their makers wish to do
so.

The safest SUV, the Chevy Suburban, is less safe on the inside than
a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry, while being more than twice as deadly
outside. A Ford Explorer is less safe on the inside than a Honda Civic
or VW Jetta:

attribute this almost entirely to the fact that kids nowadays are

considered reasonable are still expected to turn the other cheek,
Amish-style. All this does is make whatever clique has discovered
that bullying really *does* get you what you want more arrogant and

in the ass is all it takes to make someone realize that not everyone
is easily pushed around. Don't get me wrong, if I did have kids and
found out that my kid had been in a fight, I'd be very concerned...
but I wouldn't be *pissed* unless I found out that he'd been the
aggressor. There's *nothing* wrong with defending yourself.

This is pretty personal with me because until I went to college, one
or the other of my parents was a teacher at whichever school I was
attending (both my parents were schoolteachers) and as a teacher's kid
I was expected to stay out of trouble at all costs. I took a lot of
shit that I'd never expect my own kid to take, because God forbid that
I'd get in a fight and have to take detention - it would look bad.
Had I to do it over again, I'd have stood up for myself a lot more...
The good news is I've become a lot less thick skinned over the years,
and I haven't seen any of the assholes from my school years in a
decade or more. And my life is infinitely better because of it. I
can only imagine what kids these days go through, because it seems
that if anything they're held to a higher standard than I was, and yet

Let's for a moment say that passenger car CAFE was applied to light
trucks, leaving only largish SUV left, say the explorer. (The crown vic
is actually the down-sized full-size). Not every buyer looking for a
passenger truck is going to be happy with an explorer. Same with
the crown vic (and sisters), especially in senior-citizen guise.

CAFE has narrowed large car choice to the point where only a small
segment of buyers have one to their liking. I wouldn't buy a 4 crown
vic, but a 2 door fairlane GT fastback or galaxie 500 XL convertible or
fastback would be nice. But those don't exist in the new car market anymore
thanks to regulation. The choice in cars of this kind is simply too
narrow to have a wide appeal.

Compare the choices of the SUV catagory to that of 3 big fords.
The SUV catagory hasn't had that narrow of a choice band since 1947.

&gt;&gt;And when those happen, are you better able to see the dog when following a

Sadly, you are incorrect.

Once again, &quot;some people&quot; buy an SUV because they want a safe vehicle for their family,
because they
want something to tow with, because they want something that is capable off road, etc.
etc.

There are SUVs out there that are very safe and that aren't much less safe for people
outside the vehicle.

While broad generalizations make the anti-SUV loons feel righteous, they are nontheless
inaccurate when they are applied to specific SUVs.

Is it smart to spend $75,000 on something you don't need so that you
can save $20,000 on your tax bill?

Hell, I am not a big fan of tax deductions, but if you are going to
have them, why not &quot;level the playing field&quot; by expanding the
deduction to passenger cars?

The complaint (though based on a pretty weak foundation) is that a
business person that would normally buy a passenger car is choosing
the SUV because of a big tax break. So instead of &quot;closing the
loophole&quot; and increasing the taxes on people that have a business need
for SUVs and trucks, why not allow business to write off passenger
cars that same way?

Not according to this site:

2002 Station Wagon models

which states the biggest wagon that Ford sells is the Taurus/Sable.

People who once bought station wagons are suppose to buy minivans
or SUVs.

This implies that towing a 5th wheel trailer is something that can't be

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If I can stop in time, I can also maneuver in time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Have you ever even tried?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To be able to stop in time for all events in front of the car in front of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you, you would need to be able to completely stop in the distance between
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you and the car in front of you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That goes for all vehicles, not just SUVs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course. Which is easier to see through/around, a light truck or a car?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Seeing is not stopping.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No. It is not. Which is easier to see through/around, a light truck or a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;car?

&gt;&gt;&gt;That's not the point, is it?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Which is easier to stop before hitting?
&gt;&gt;&gt;A vehicle that's close to you, or one farther away?

&gt;&gt;One that's farther away. Which is easier to see through/around, a light

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;being functional. If you leave less, then you will hit the car in front of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you if the were to stop instantaneously (possibly by rearending a pile of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stopped cars, like the huge pile-ups that happen in fog because people are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;following the car in front at the same 2s without being able to see past).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh, well, let's just figure on the worst possible.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In that case, you should stay in bed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What to do???

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Right. Since we are helpless to deal with anything bad that may happen, we

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So, if you drive without looking past the car in front of you, you are

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;driver that was looking past the car in front.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sounds like a real dilemma, doesn't it?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you yourself prepare for the worst possible outcome?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you drive as though that car in front may suddenly jam on iots
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;brakes for a dog that runs in front of it that you can't see?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How about the possibility of a car losing it's front end due to a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or any of the multitude of things that could happen that would cause
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that car in front to stop faster than usual?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or the truck in the oposing lane that loses a wheel, and careens into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;your lane in front of you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And when those happen, are you better able to see the dog when following a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;light truck or a car? Are you able to see the multitude of things that may
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be occurring in front of the vehicle ahead of you if the vehicle ahead of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you is a light truck or a car?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You won't see the dog as soon as the other driver will.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You still don't get it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've seen the dog *before* the person in front of me. I slowed and was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;nearly stopped (of course keeping a lookout behind me as well) by the time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the person saw the dog and came to an emergency stop as I calmly watched
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the whole thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Right.
&gt;&gt;&gt;How did you see the dog that wasn't in front of that other car?
&gt;&gt;&gt;What about the idjits that just stop for whatever reason, even with no
&gt;&gt;&gt;other vehicles in front of them?

&gt;&gt;They are rare. They always have a reason, even if it isn't good. Just
&gt;&gt;because you are too incompetent to be able to reasonably predict other's
&gt;&gt;actions does not mean we are all as inept.

&gt;SO now I'm supposed to be able to read a driver's mind?
&gt;I find it much easier to just back off.

"/> Non sequitur. Predicting actions based off an upcoming hazard you can see
(that you couldn't see if they were in a blocking light truck) is not
reading the mind of the person. You know they will stop, there is no
guessing. The only question is whether they will stop instantly by hitting
it or stop earlier under their own power. Since the hazard is visible
ahead, you can react before them, regardless of their actions or thoughts.

I find it better to be able to see, regardless of my distance to the car
ahead.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I couldn't do that if I couldn't see past the car in front of me.

&gt;If you're following too closely, you can't stop in time *after* they
&gt;start stopping.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Better visibility increases safety. But you still don't get it (actually,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think you get it, but will argue just anyway).

&gt;&gt;&gt;Wrong.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I deal with reality, something you don't seem to be able to do.

&gt;&gt;What reality? Do you leave sufficient distance in all traffic situations
&gt;&gt;such that you can come to a complete stop in the distance from you to the
&gt;&gt;car in front of you?

&gt;Who's arguing for that? Certainly not me.

"/>&quot;SO now I'm supposed to be able to read a driver's mind?

everyone, making up straw men and lying about what they said (even when the
history is included), and telling them they are wrong, but you don't
actually state what it is you believe/do.

stop between you and the person in front? If not, why not?

&gt;when it comes to the arguing about the safety of SUVs or light trucks.
&gt; But I always question whether or not it's worth it to spend a
&gt;shitload of money just to get a tax break.

&gt;Is it smart to spend $75,000 on something you don't need so that you
&gt;can save $20,000 on your tax bill?

&gt;Hell, I am not a big fan of tax deductions, but if you are going to
&gt;have them, why not &quot;level the playing field&quot; by expanding the
&gt;deduction to passenger cars?

&gt;The complaint (though based on a pretty weak foundation) is that a
&gt;business person that would normally buy a passenger car is choosing
&gt;the SUV because of a big tax break. So instead of &quot;closing the
&gt;loophole&quot; and increasing the taxes on people that have a business need
&gt;for SUVs and trucks, why not allow business to write off passenger
&gt;cars that same way?

"/>  Expanding tax break for cars usually means tax-exemption of buying a
more luxurious car. Bigger tax break for SUVs (which we have) means
tax-exemption of buying a heavier vehicle that pollutes more, bids up gas
prices more, increases the U.S. trade deficit more, and has a higher risk
of killing people in other sub-4-ton vehicles.
I do believe that a mere 30% or whatever deductability will make the
difference in vehicle choice in some cases, and this will be at my
expense!
I believe that tax deductability of a truck beyond that for a car should
depend on evidence that the truck would be used for &quot;ordinary and
necessary and reasonable&quot; business purposes that a car cannot be used for.
Along with evidence that the chosen truck is a good choice of truck.
(Easy if you haul tons of freight, hard if all you want is a taller
vehicle for having a special subsidized vision advantage over other
vehicles).

It seems to me that your claims are dependent on SUVs being subsidized
by cars. The SUVs are exempt from the regulations that hinder the cars
which you desire. I believe the regulations are good and I also believe
in a level playing field, so I advocate extending to SUVs the car
regulations.

&gt;How many people do you figure are interested in buying a large senior

&gt;Let's for a moment say that passenger car CAFE was applied to light

&gt;is actually the down-sized full-size). Not every buyer looking for a
&gt;passenger truck is going to be happy with an explorer. Same with
&gt;the crown vic (and sisters), especially in senior-citizen guise.

&gt;CAFE has narrowed large car choice to the point where only a small
&gt;segment of buyers have one to their liking. I wouldn't buy a 4 crown
&gt;vic, but a 2 door fairlane GT fastback or galaxie 500 XL convertible or
&gt;fastback would be nice. But those don't exist in the new car market anymore
&gt;thanks to regulation. The choice in cars of this kind is simply too
&gt;narrow to have a wide appeal.

&gt;Compare the choices of the SUV catagory to that of 3 big fords.
&gt;The SUV catagory hasn't had that narrow of a choice band since 1947.

"/> You can currently write off $25,000 of them, under proposed rules it
would be $75,000.

http://www.detnews.com/2003/autosinsider/0301/20/a01-64218.htm

&quot;The Internal Revenue Service allows much more generous tax treatment
for trucks, which the IRS defines as any vehicle with a gross weight
of 6,000 pounds or more, regardless of whether it is used to haul
goods or a single person.

The definition was originally intended to exempt farmers and other
small businesses who needed a pickup or cargo van from limits that
apply to luxury vehicles. But the definition was written well before a
wide array of upscale trucks and SUVs, such as the Lincoln Navigator,
Cadillac Escalade and Lexus GX470, hit the market. And well before
U.S. consumers started using trucks and SUVs as a substitute for the
family car.

The proposed $75,000 deduction on business equipment means that
businesses choosing between a car and an SUV have an even bigger
incentive to go for the SUV. Cars are not eligible for this
deduction.&quot;

The real stupid bastards are the conservative SUV owners. Quite aside from
any issue of morality--I leave that to others-- it is fun to see some
Bush-leaguer with a Bush 2000 sticker on his Navigator whining about the
price of gas. Just wait until such folks find out the theRepublicans in
Congress have sent a letter to the administration proposing an increase in
the federal gas tax.

May gas go to 3.00/gallon.

The vehicle is as safe as the driver is. A few vehicles might have
tendencies towards things like rolling over but if people drove cautiously
that would much less of a problem.

"/> It *IS* true... fewer SUV owners die in their vehicles than do passenger
car owners. Plain and simple. That's contradictory to the position that
they're not as safe. You suggested one theory on why this statistic may be
misleading to SUPPORT that contradicted position. You obviously fail to be
able to support your theory, or acknowledge that doing so in the way you
describe contradicts another anti-SUV theory that SUV's are used mainly as
passenger transportation... something that logic dictates would cause them
to be driven as much as passenger cars.

Regardless, the unchallenged statistics I posted above tend to contradict

once again by proving your insinuation that in spite of their increasing
numbers, SUV's are driven far fewer miles than passenger cars. If this is a
fact, it explains the disparity between per-million deaths in each type of
vehicle, but thoroughly demolishes your anti-SUV &quot;experience&quot; of seeing so
many SUV's on the road. If your notion is INcorrect, it upholds the
conclusion supported by the data itself... that SUV's are simply safer for
both their drivers and those around them as evidenced by the decreases in
ALL fatalities in spite of their increasing numbers, and their usage as
reported by you and your brethren.

In short... the facts just painted the entire anti crowd into a very small
corner. It's going to be quite amusing watching them use every trick in the
book to weasel out of it. So far, I've seen you decry the same sources your

I don't like SUV's myself ( I used to own one) but many people don't care
about their gas mileage or the amount of pollutants they put into the air.

&gt;&gt;invite me to provide the data.

&gt; It *IS* true... fewer SUV owners die in their vehicles than do passenger

&gt; they're not as safe. You suggested one theory on why this statistic may be
&gt; misleading to SUPPORT that contradicted position. You obviously fail to be
&gt; able to support your theory, or acknowledge that doing so in the way you
&gt; describe contradicts another anti-SUV theory that SUV's are used mainly as
&gt; passenger transportation... something that logic dictates would cause them
&gt; to be driven as much as passenger cars.

"/> It's not his place to prove or disprove that. You're the one that made
the &quot;safer&quot; claim, now back it up. If nothing else, I'd like to see you

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;What I know empirically is that:

&gt;&gt;SUVs in general don't handle nearly as well as comparably priced cars.
&gt;&gt;They have higher centers of gravity.
&gt;&gt;They are designed to understeer when carrying a full load, thus will
&gt;&gt;understeer even more when they are unloaded.

&gt; Totally and completely meaningless. Irrelevant, rhetoric based grabbing of
&gt; straws. Vehicles range widely in their characteristics, from the road
&gt; hugging ability of the best racing machines to the obvious inability of a
&gt; tandem semi to turn out credible times on a slalom course. All types of
&gt; vehicles need to be driven accordingly, and any failure to do so is a
&gt; driver problem, NOT a vehicle problem.

"/> True. But empirical evidence shows that SUV's tend to be driven in
exactly the same manner as passenger cars and are consequently
consistently driven closer to their ultimate performance limits. They
also tend to be less &quot;progressive&quot; in loss of control situations - it
may be perfectly possible to execute a nice controlled four wheel drift
in a passenger car, but you couldn't pay me to do that in an SUV on
anything grippier than packed snow. Yes, demographics, yadda yadda
yadda, but when you come right down to it, I personally am safer in a
good handling passenger car than in any SUV on the market today. I have
zero doubt of that. Why? Because I know the performance limits of my
car and have confidence in my ability to drive it and avoid 99.44% of
the hazards out there. And if you never have a wreck, it's kind of hard
to be killed in one. I do *not* have that confidence factor in a SUV,
in fact quite the opposite -when driving one I'm constantly reminded of
how close to the edge I am, and how if anything really ugly happens how
small an envelope I have to work with.

&lt;snip rest&gt;

didn't someone have a list of real (i.e. non-IIHS, using standard
metrics) cites on SUV safety? I never bookmark such stuff, although I
should start, seeing as this tpoic never truly dies. Well, that and the
folks that don't believe me when I talk about ABS (WHY did that thread

&gt;&gt;&gt;You are of course correct. OTOH, it would also undermine the very things

&gt;&gt;&gt;the road. Do the math. Even a 50% market share driven 1/3 less miles than a

&gt;&gt;&gt;3rd vehicle is an SUV (or whatever yanked out of thin air figure you nuts
&gt;&gt;&gt;are passing off as &quot;experience&quot; these days). And SUV's don't even have a
&gt;&gt;&gt;50% market share... yet.

&gt;&gt;Market share is irrelevant for the information we need.

&gt;Bull SHIT! Your entire argument REVOLVES around the premise that their
&gt;numbers in relation to other vehicles have, and are, growing, thus posing
&gt;an increasing danger. Market share is at the very center of the problem as
&gt;you see it, and that has been plainly stated more time than anyone can

determine can only be relevantly expressed in per miles traveled. If

equally safe. What if one fleet traveled 10 times the distance of the
other? Would that make a difference in your overall safety
determination?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;So by all means feel free to defeat your own arguments by disproving the

&gt;&gt;&gt;more evident. Doesn't really matter to me. :)

&gt;&gt;You've completely missed the point. Per units sold tells us
&gt;&gt;absolutely *nothing* about how safe they are unless we know how much
&gt;&gt;use they were put to.

&gt;I agree, and that's why I offer you the opportunity to contradict yourself
&gt;once again by proving your insinuation that in spite of their increasing
&gt;numbers, SUV's are driven far fewer miles than passenger cars. If this is a
&gt;fact, it explains the disparity between per-million deaths in each type of
&gt;vehicle, but thoroughly demolishes your anti-SUV &quot;experience&quot; of seeing so
&gt;many SUV's on the road. If your notion is INcorrect, it upholds the
&gt;conclusion supported by the data itself... that SUV's are simply safer for
&gt;both their drivers and those around them as evidenced by the decreases in
&gt;ALL fatalities in spite of their increasing numbers, and their usage as

But newer SUVs have a much higher risk of
rollovers than cars because they stand
higher off the ground and thus raise their
centers of gravity. The Insurance Institute
says single-vehicle rollover crashes in 2001
accounted for 47 percent of deaths in SUVs,
36 percent in pickups and 20 percent in cars.

Small SUVs, those that weigh less than
3,000 pounds, were the worst; they
accounted for 55 rollover deaths per million
vehicles, nearly five times higher than large
cars.

"/> NOT. Try again. Like here, from the IIHS itself, not filtered
through a trade rag:

HTTP:// www.hwysafety.org/fed/testimony%5Fbon%5F022603.pdf

&quot;It often has been claimed that overall occupant death rates are lower
in SUVs than in cars. The implication is that SUVs are safer. But this
results largely from the heavier weights of SUVs compared with cars. For
example, only 5 percent of all 1997-99 model cars weighed more than 4000
pounds, while the corresponding percentage of SUVs was 49. So it is
disingenuous for defenders of SUVs to claim they are safer than cars.
Most of their advantage in terms of self protection is simply due to
mass. It is also undeniable that SUVs, as a group, have a rollover
problem. They are about twice as likely as cars to be in fatal single
vehicle rollover crashes.&quot;
-- IIHS, February 26, 2003

Just above this entry is a stark set of graphs showing how much
more death is caused when cars are hit by an SUVs and by pickups
than when hit by cars _of_the_same_weight_.

In short, SUVs &quot;win&quot; only by running up the body count of the
&quot;enemy&quot;. Is this what safety is all about?

"/> While your statistics are not directly relevant to a discussion of SUV
safety, as they are data gathered for &quot;light trucks&quot;, we *can* glean some
information from page 17 none the less...

If you examine this data with the knowledge that pickup truck deaths per
million registered vehicles actually increased 10% from 1998 to 2001, the
quoted decrease in &quot;light truck&quot; deaths per million during the same period
(from 27.75 to 26.23) points to an even BIGGER increase in SUV safety. If
one subset of this &quot;light truck&quot; category showed a 10% increase, other
subsets of that same category would have to have provided the offsetting
decrease to result in an overall decline in deaths per million.

I suppose this would be a good time to thank you for providing more
evidence of increased SUV safety, but I'll hold that heart felt
congratulation until we examine the actual VMT figures from table 8 of your
own quoted source. Said table provides us with the following data for the
same time period (1998 to 2001):

Numbers of registered light trucks increased from 69,783,500 to 79,005,848,
and total light truck miles traveled increased from 861,951 Million to
972,649 Million. An increase in both total numbers of vehicles and total
miles driven.

Light truck fatality rates per 100,000 decreased from 15.34 to 14.78, and
fatalities per 100 Million VMT decreased from 1.24 to 1.20. A drop in both
per vehicle and per mile deaths in SPITE of a marked rise in both numbers
of vehicles and miles traveled.

Even WITHOUT the knowledge that a specific subset of &quot;light trucks&quot; showed
an increase in per vehicle death rates, the numbers prove that this
classification of motor vehicle has shown a significant improvement in
safety. Breaking out the 10% increase attributed to pickup trucks, and one
can only conclude that SOME subset of this light truck classification is
responsible for a drop in the per-VMT death rate, and that the overall
decline has to be fueled by a corresponding large difference in that
subset. If you remove &quot;pickup trucks&quot; from the general classification of
&quot;light trucks&quot;, what's left?

This would be a good time to offer you that &quot;kudos&quot; I owe you, except for
one thing... &lt;evil grin&gt;

Table *7* from your provided source is the real killer. It deals with the
per vehicle and VMT figures for your darling passenger cars, and *it* shows
without any doubt that passenger cars are less safe that ALL light trucks.
While the per VMT death rates for trucks dropped from 1.24 to 1.20 in the
relevant time period, passenger car VMT rates showed a similar trend yet
remained *HIGHER*... 1.36 and 1.28 accordingly. And guess what... the
INJURY rates per VMT show an even *larger* difference. So when using your
&quot;only thing that matters&quot; VMT figures, even WITHOUT compensating for pickup
trucks, SUV's are proven beyond a shadow of a doubt to be safer than
passenger cars.

So here ya' are Nate... THANK you for pointing me directly to a source that

new ones have to be put into service. This is why I might attribute some of
the declining SUV death rate to newer (better) SUV's, but the sheer volume

Certainly, the first installment that went into effect in 2001
reduced the tax RATE on everyone. That $300 per person rebate
you got last year was not a onetime thing, it was money you
overpaid during the first six months of the year in withholding
taxes. The first taxable amount of everyone's taxable income went
down from 15% to 10%, a saving of $600 per person, every year.
Some millions of Americans will no longer have any tax liability
as a result of the 5% reduction. Future installments over the
next nine years will reduce the tax rates for everyone even
further. The President wants the future installments moved up to
help the economy even sooner. The more you earn, the higher your
tax RATE, the more you will save in taxes. Contrary to what many
would have you believe lower tax RATES do not reduce income to
the federal government. Any economist will tell you that in a
capitalistic system the more often money changes hands the more
often it is taxed and lower tax rates mean more of it changes
hands more often. When President Kennedy reduced the marginal tax
rate from 90% to 50% the INCOME to the federal government
tripled. When President Reagan reduced the marginal tax rates
from 50% to 35% the income to the federal government DOUBLED.
Budget problems are cause by increases in spending, not reduced
tax RATES.

&gt;It's interesting that you snipped this, particularly after I

&gt;Forgive my hyperbole. If SUVs don't have to be driven differently
&gt;than cars, why do they roll over a lot more than cars do?

"/> Yes, Brandon, you're right. I sincerely apologize. If I were the type to
make excuses I might say that my knee jerk snip was a product of some sort
of frustration with what I saw as a flat denial of the facts by multiple
posters. But then, I'd never consider trying to excuse away such an error.
&lt;big grin&gt;

I *am* sorry. I made the mistake of getting about as far as my &lt;snip&gt; and
neglecting to take the time to comprehend your post in total. Oddly enough
that's something I just typed a rather long winded rant about, and should
be looking for a towel to remove the egg from my face as we speak. ;)

But... rollover problems considered, we're still left with the fact that
&quot;light trucks&quot; in general, and SUV's by way of association with that group,
show a considerable difference in safety in both per-vehicle and
per-mile-driven statistics given for cars and trucks. They are in fact the
safer choice of vehicle over all.

Yes, SUV's shouldn't be driven like a Venom Viper. They're simply not up to
the task. They do, however, provide their owners with an extra margin of
safety, and *if* that owner takes their limitations into consideration, as
any driver of any vehicle should, they will logically be a FAR safer
vehicle than your average passenger car. The statistics and opinions
provided by people on BOTH sides of the SUV fence support this conclusion
without fail.

And yes, a larger vehicle would obviously pose a greater risk to the
passengers of a smaller vehicle should the two mix. However, the steady
overall decline in the per-vehicle and per-mile-driven death and injury
rates among those who choose to travel in those smaller vehicles, combined
with the accepted and verified &quot;boom&quot; in the numbers of SUV's on the road,
would tend to show that those SUV's simply aren't producing the effect that
the anti-SUV crowd claims. While the ratio of SUV's to passenger cars has
grown closer, passenger cars STILL become safer over all.

Obviously you know little of how our income tax system works.
I would suggest you do more research on the subject before you
reply next time. Some like to use percentages when it suits them
but switch to actual dollars when that suits their point. Of
course the richer get a larger percentage of the total amount of
money in a tax rate reduction, they pay by far the highest amount
of money in taxes. The more one earn in this country the HIGHER
the RATE of taxation not merely the amount. Of course the more
one earns the more dollars they save with a RATE reduction, but
it is by far the SMALLEST percentage reduction. The people at
the lower rates get the largest PERCENTAGE of any tax RATE
reduction. For instance those in the old 15% tax RATE that
dropped to 10% actually got the highest RATE reduction, one third
of their previous tax liability, to the point they some will no
longer have any tax liability. A real world 100% reduction in
their actual dollar amount, whereas the super rich who pay the
biggest majority of tax DOLLARS get less than a ONE percent
reduction in those same dollars.

If you listen to some politicians one might think they do that
NOW. How many times have you heard some of them say we can't
reduce income taxes because we need a drug benefit for seniors
and to shore up Social Security? They rely on the fact that most
people know little or nothing about their own tax system.
Personally I can't afford anymore 'free' government services.
Why should my children and grand children have to pay for my
prescription drugs, anyway? What's next? Will the governments
buy me the car I need it to go to my doctor because they is no
public transportation or taxi service where I live? Paying for
retirement and other social programs for the general population
out of general revenue, as we do with SSI for the indigent, would
turn the US into a socialist society. Something I believe will
never happen in the US, nor should it.

&gt;&gt; danger in light of the fact that this &quot;danger&quot; appears to have changed
&gt;&gt; inversely to their numbers.

&gt;Consider yourself challenged:

&gt;After three decades of declining highway death tolls, total traffic
&gt;deaths bottomed out in 1992 at 39,250. They have since trended up,
&gt;to 42,116 in 2001.

disparities in increases in total numbers of each type of vehicle as shown
by the very same source you're quoting here.

To be brutally honest, the single most significant factor in crash deaths
and injuries seems to be the use of restraints. It accounts for
approximately a 10X difference in both. It may be that seat belt use is the
major controlling factor in these statistics, and trends in their use the
reason for the varying rates of change in all areas. This theory would tend
to hold water, given the statistics shown in table 21. Restraint use
increased at a greater rate prior to 1994 than after. That alone could
account for your &quot;slower rate of change&quot; during those later years.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;That link doesn't present any hard numbers on the likelihood of any

&gt; You claim the numbers don't exist, then quote this...

&gt;&gt; says single-vehicle rollover crashes in 2001
&gt;&gt; accounted for 47 percent of deaths in SUVs,

&gt; three times 20 percent of a higher ratio of a larger quantity, or are you

"/> They don't tell me anything in absolute terms how likely a vehicle is
to roll over. A useful statistic would be rollover incidents per
vehicle mile traveled - if you had that you could make pronouncements
on likelihood of rolling over with some authority. All those numbers
are telling you is that *if* you wreck a car and die, statistically
there's a 20% chance that it rolled over, and *if* you wreck a SUV and
die, there's a 47% chance that it rolled over. Now if you had
fatality per vehicle mile stats for the three classes of vehicles
(which I don't have handy - and the NHTSA .pdf that I posted the link
to yesterday seemed only to break it down into &quot;light truck&quot; and
&quot;passenger car&quot;) you could do a bit of number crunching and get a
&quot;fatal rollover per vehicle mile&quot; stat - not *exactly* what you're
looking for, but close enough that it might be meaningful to your
argument.

I believe that somewhere in that .pdf file is something of the nature
of a rollover incident per vehicle mile table for light trucks and
passenger cars, but I don't recall and I'm still at work and that file
is saved on my home computer. Either way, I am neither defending nor
attacking the claim that SUV's are &quot;3x as likely&quot; to roll, because I
don't have the data handy. All I was stating in my previous post that
the link you quoted, while not having the data to prove or disprove
that statement, didn't paint SUV rollover resistance in the rosiest of
hues.

&gt; same time period (1998 to 2001):

&gt; Numbers of registered light trucks increased from 69,783,500 to 79,005,848,
&gt; and total light truck miles traveled increased from 861,951 Million to
&gt; 972,649 Million. An increase in both total numbers of vehicles and total

&gt; Light truck fatality rates per 100,000 decreased from 15.34 to 14.78, and
&gt; fatalities per 100 Million VMT decreased from 1.24 to 1.20. A drop in both
&gt; per vehicle and per mile deaths in SPITE of a marked rise in both numbers
&gt; of vehicles and miles traveled.

"/> Hmm, there appears to be an inconsistency here. The table on page 17
(table 3) says that in 2001 the fatality rate per 100 million VMT was
1.73 for cars and 2.13 for light trucks. However, tables 7 and 8 do
appear to support your claims. I really can't explain this as the data
sources are the same and there's no footnotes explaining what the
differences between the two sets of data are.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Even WITHOUT the knowledge that a specific subset of &quot;light trucks&quot; showed
&gt; an increase in per vehicle death rates, the numbers prove that this
&gt; classification of motor vehicle has shown a significant improvement in

&gt; can only conclude that SOME subset of this light truck classification is
&gt; responsible for a drop in the per-VMT death rate, and that the overall
&gt; decline has to be fueled by a corresponding large difference in that
&gt; subset. If you remove &quot;pickup trucks&quot; from the general classification of
&gt;&quot;light trucks&quot;, what's left?

"/> Of course, the same steady increase in safety has been seen by *all*

&gt;&gt;&gt; Some of it might be attributed to a better SUV of course, but the numbers
&gt;&gt;&gt; sold in 2001 are a mere drop in the bucket compared to all SUV's on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; road.

&gt;&gt;Hmm, only the IIHS says that. NHTSA disagrees.

&gt; I'm sorry, but that's simply untrue. Both the IIHS and NHTSA provide
&gt; numbers that show while raw, total numbers of crashes and deaths have
&gt; risen, the rates per vehicle and VMT has declined. There is simply NO way
&gt; to explain that without a relatively large increase in the total numbers of
&gt; vehicles on the roads, and both sources verify that as a correct
&gt; conclusion. This means that older vehicles have to remain in service, and
&gt; new ones have to be put into service. This is why I might attribute some of
&gt; the declining SUV death rate to newer (better) SUV's, but the sheer volume
&gt; of change in relationship to the total death figure simply makes it
&gt; incomprehensible that new SUV sales account for the entire difference...
&gt; unless of course you assume that everyone bought a new SUV in 2001, or
&gt; something equally silly.

"/> That's actually not as silly as it sounds. Last I heard light truck
sales were actually about 50% of the market, with a large proportion of
that figure being SUVs. (no, I didn't look that up, but I'm fairly sure
that it's close to the mark. Feel free to research it if you like.) So
seeing as the light truck fleet is still smaller than the passenger car
fleet we have no choice but to conclude that a larger percentage of the
light truck fleet than the passenger car fleet is relatively new.

Once again, the broad generalization regarding SUVs hoists its ugly head.

There are certainly SUVs that incorporate features not found on many passenger cars, like
traction control, stability management, brake assist, etc. that make them more capable
than many passenger cars in response to &quot;emergency&quot; maneuvers.

Additionally, there are SUVs that handle better than many passenger cars and have a higher

this document, originally cited by one of the &quot;anti&quot; crowd...

quite the opposite is true. Not only have these figures steadily decreased
in spite of the growing popularity of these &quot;dangerous&quot; vehicles, but they
are actually somewhat LESS than the same figures for passenger cars.

&gt;&gt;My main vehicle weighs 22 lbs, and uses no fossil fuels whatsoever.

&gt;That's just dandy if you're 12 years old. For adults it's not an option.

"/> Too harsh. Often depends on the choices one makes.

In the last three places I have lived (Fort Collins CO, San Jose CA
and Chelmsford MA), I made explicit choices to live in a place that
would allow me to bicycle to places I travel daily e.g. work,
groceries, etc. I explicitly traded off cheaper (further away)
housing with other factors.

Obviously there are places where weather is tougher or one could have
made choices to live far enough away or via busy freeways that make it
tougher particularly to retrofit cycling back into an existing
situation. Weather can play a factor (e.g. in New England I stopped
cycling winter months with the dark/ice... but in Colorado I cycle
through the winter). Destinations can play a role (riding from here
to Denver 50+ miles is not practical on daily basis, but if I needed
to ride to Denver each day I would instead move very close to work).
Family/children can make things a lot tougher, but again I know of
people who have made choices to allow that as well. Health can also
play a role.

In my particular case, I sold my automobile two years ago and took off
for a 12 month trip to travel by bicycle. In 17,700+ miles that year
I crossed the US, did one lap around Australia and spent time riding
in New Zealand and India. Each day meant I took my limited belongings
packed them all with me and traveled to the next place. On other
cycle trips I've pretty much cycled through half of the largest metro
areas in this US as well as 45 states.

On return from that trip 12 months ago, I made some choices that would
enable me to keep riding my bicycle as primary transportation. In
particular, I chose to live close enough to work, shopping, etc. In
twelve months I haven't yet purchased an automobile but I have rented
three or four times for destinations that are more practical via car.
At $50-$70 total cost for a weekend rental and four weekends a year, I
can't own a car for that cost. My perspective on destinations is a
bit different (e.g. I'll look at 15 miles away as being an hour of
travel and so may not go there as frequently as someone else would hop
in their car)... but I also feel more connected to weather, moon
phases, sights/smells/sounds around town than if I were always in a
car/SUV. I will ride 80-100 miles in a day on weekend, mostly for
recreation but potentially to visit further away. I might purchase a
car in next few months but even then don't expect it to become my
primary vehicle (and this will not be as frugal as renting
occasionally).

I would assert that many (obviously not all) adults could make choices
to lessen auto usage and some even could even choose to use bicycle as
a primary transportation. I am one example. Retrofitting a choice of
bicycle as primary transportation in an existing situation may likely
be considerably more difficult than making up front choices of the
situation you get into.

It is not a choice I force on others and I do respect choices others
make. But, a &quot;only for 12 year olds&quot; attitude also doesn't
necessarily reflect the choices I have been able to make.

&gt; | &gt;Yes, SUV's shouldn't be driven like a Venom Viper. They're simply not up to
&gt; | &gt;the task. They do, however, provide their owners with an extra margin of
&gt; | &gt;safety, and *if* that owner takes their limitations into consideration, as
&gt; | &gt;any driver of any vehicle should, they will logically be a FAR safer
&gt; | &gt;vehicle than your average passenger car. The statistics and opinions
&gt; | &gt;provided by people on BOTH sides of the SUV fence support this conclusion
&gt; | &gt;without fail.
&gt; |
&gt; | They provide an extra margin of safety should the driver be involved
&gt; | in a collision. They reduce the margin of safety for collision
&gt; | avoidance though by having poorer handling. They also demonstrate a
&gt; | poor response to emergency maneuvers by having significantly larger
&gt; | roll over deaths than cars.

&gt; Once again, the broad generalization regarding SUVs hoists its ugly head.

&gt; There are certainly SUVs that incorporate features not found on many passenger cars, like
&gt; traction control, stability management, brake assist, etc. that make them more capable
&gt; than many passenger cars in response to &quot;emergency&quot; maneuvers.

"/> Those devices are just add-on band-aids that can help less skilled
drivers, but don't do a thing about the inherently poor dynamics of a
vehicle with a high CG and less optimal suspension design. All of
these devices are also available on passenger cars.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Additionally, there are SUVs that handle better than many passenger cars and have a higher
&gt; margin of safety for collision avaoidance, especially when supplemented by the electronic
&gt; aids describe above.

A gimmick? Your kidding right. Look at the 2000 and 2001 tax
rate schedules and prove it to yourself. As to increased income
to the feds being brought on by tax rate reductions all one need
do is research what actually happened when President Kennedy and
Reagan lowered marginal tax rates and one can prove that to
themselves as well. Try that first then comment.

&quot;Involvement&quot; statistics are more than misleading in determining causes and
effects. For example, if a drunk passenger car driver sideswipes an SUV,
looses control, and drives over a 300 foot embankment killing everyone in
the car, it's an &quot;SUV involved fatality&quot;... probably more than one... but
obviously it's not the fault of the SUV, nor did the SUV have any bearing
at all on the deaths. And that's just *one* of the problems with these
types of statistics...

If you examine table 3 intelligently, you begin to see the numbers clearly
aren't acceptable at face value. The most glaring indication of this fact
is that table 3 seems to indicate that an approxamately 50% minority market
share is responsible for a nearly 25% higher fatality rate in the
majority... a majority that is known to only have an approxamately 6%
higher occupant fatality rate. Can you explain any of this *without*
admitting that &quot;involvment&quot; in no way proves liability?

Oddly enough, we see a convergence with occupant statistics in the

disparity is going to be skewed more heavily in the case of the larger
vehicle as the statistical &quot;mistake&quot; is made that much more frequently.

that these &quot;partner protection&quot; problems, as valid as they may be in

Think about it... the numbers of registered vehicles of all types have
risen. So have the VMT numbers, across the board. Raw numbers of the larger
vehicles have gained considerable ground on raw numbers of smaller
vehicles, yet there's no discernible difference in the rate of change of
occupant fatalities/injuries in the smaller vehicles between the years
prior to the SUV &quot;boom&quot;, and those after. Now if SUV's were a real life
problem to passenger cars, wouldn't you expect to see a corresponding
change in passenger car data as SUV's became more popular?

"/> I read the testimony. It's quite a long winded expose on the differences
between SUV's, trucks, and cars, but it's a bit &quot;lacking&quot; in raw data. More
of an opinion piece than a serious reference as far as I'm concerned. But
then one would expect this sort of summation in a testimonial.

None the less, it does bring up some interesting points like the notion
that the SUV problem is more of a vehicle weight problem than anything
else. It specifically calles out very small vehicles as a more prevalent
problem in SUV/car crashes, and suggests that an inverse situation arises
when a passenger car approaches or exceeds the weight of an SUV... or when
a tiny car meets a large one. It ALSO plainly states that a significant
difference could be made by improving the safety features of small
passenger cars. Of course this is a no-brainer, but it does indicate that
there's a &quot;solution&quot; that doesn't require SUV's to become extinct.

It might be interesting to actually see data concerning the results of
&quot;econo-box&quot; vs &quot;mid sized sedan&quot; accidents. I'd bet steak dinners all
around they're similar to SUV/car statistics. I'd also wager that the
differences in economy between &quot;econo-boxes&quot; an standard passenger cars are
similar to the differences in cars and SUV's. And I'd bet my last DIME that
not a single anti-SUV'r would argue against modern full size cars based on
those facts. ;)

"/> A rather meaningless bit of information, even assuming it's true. The
simple fact that one thing is potentially more dangerous than another, and

nothing about where the blame lies. As stated above, a drunk in a car who
drives over a cliff after sideswiping an SUV shouldn't be counted as a SUV
problem. With &quot;involvement&quot; statistics, it is.

Actually, the drunk thing is a glaring example of the fallacy of
&quot;involvement&quot; statistics. It's widely accepted that DUI figures are
artificially inflated this way. If an intoxicated driver is involved in an
accident that's entirely caused by a sober driver, it's put down in the
record books as an &quot;alcohol related&quot; accident. And no, that's not an
endorsement for DUI. It's simply a common knowledge example of a problem.
But since driving under the influence doesn't have any redeeming qualities,
nobody really gives a damn. ;) Another semi-relevant example is
unemployment figures. THOSE statistics are typically low because once a
person is no longer able to draw unemployment they're &quot;UNrelated&quot; to the
jobless problem... even if it's because they've simply been out of work for

&gt; passenger car deaths have declined in spite of an increase in the numbers
&gt; of larger vehicles and a corresponding rise in their VMT figures, tell me
&gt; that these &quot;partner protection&quot; problems, as valid as they may be in
&gt; theory, simply don't materialize in the real world to the degree that the
&gt; anti's would like to have us believe.

&gt; Think about it... the numbers of registered vehicles of all types have
&gt; risen. So have the VMT numbers, across the board. Raw numbers of the larger
&gt; vehicles have gained considerable ground on raw numbers of smaller
&gt; vehicles, yet there's no discernible difference in the rate of change of
&gt; occupant fatalities/injuries in the smaller vehicles between the years
&gt; prior to the SUV &quot;boom&quot;, and those after. Now if SUV's were a real life
&gt; problem to passenger cars, wouldn't you expect to see a corresponding
&gt; change in passenger car data as SUV's became more popular?

"/> A lack of a decrease in fatalities would be interesting enough. As
safety features of automobiles have generally been improving every year,
as well as other factors (improved roads, signals, signage, etc.) one
would expect fatalities to keep decreasing at a more or less steady
rate. This appears to have been happening, although there is a slight
leveling off of the rate over the past few years. However, this is a
relatively small leveling off and also the SUV explosion is a relatively
recent phenomenon so drawing any concrete conlusions may be a little
premature. However, we can't rule out the possibility of SUV's being a
factor as the lack of an increase is not disproof of that theory.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;the IIHS testimony. Or go look up past reports dealing with crash
&gt;&gt;compatibility.

&gt; I read the testimony. It's quite a long winded expose on the differences
&gt; between SUV's, trucks, and cars, but it's a bit &quot;lacking&quot; in raw data. More
&gt; of an opinion piece than a serious reference as far as I'm concerned. But
&gt; then one would expect this sort of summation in a testimonial.

&gt; None the less, it does bring up some interesting points like the notion
&gt; that the SUV problem is more of a vehicle weight problem than anything
&gt; else. It specifically calles out very small vehicles as a more prevalent
&gt; problem in SUV/car crashes, and suggests that an inverse situation arises
&gt; when a passenger car approaches or exceeds the weight of an SUV... or when
&gt; a tiny car meets a large one. It ALSO plainly states that a significant
&gt; difference could be made by improving the safety features of small
&gt; passenger cars. Of course this is a no-brainer, but it does indicate that
&gt; there's a &quot;solution&quot; that doesn't require SUV's to become extinct.

"/> You are correct in that weight is a factor, but it is not the only
factor. As SUV's are generally (not always, anymore) built off of light
truck chassis, they tend to have bumper heights that are higher than
that of passenger cars. If a SUV (or light truck) crashes with a
passenger car in such a way that the bumpers completely miss each other,
the car will definitely get the short end... much more so than in a
collision with a passenger car of similar weight. Another factor is the
general rigidity of the average light truck chassis - it is done that
way by necessity as they are designed to be able to haul heavy loads and
tow heavy trailers. However, this rigidity becomes a liability in a
crash, both for the occupants of the SUV or light truck, and the
occupants of whatever vehicle the SUV or truck has crashed into. The
reason for this is simple - because the truck chassis does not crumple
in a controlled manner like a (well designed) modern passenger car, the
passenger area of both vehicles is subject to a much higher deceleration
than would be the case in a car-car crash. This immediately puts
occupants of both vehicles at risk for deceleration-induced brain or
organ damage, even without passenger compartment intrusion or contact
with anything other than seatbelts/airbags. Furthermore, the rigid
chassis of the truck forces the crumple zone of the passenger car to
dissipate more than its share of the energy of the crash, causing an
increased risk of intrusion into the passenger compartment of the car,
with obvious results.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; It might be interesting to actually see data concerning the results of
&gt;&quot;econo-box&quot; vs &quot;mid sized sedan&quot; accidents. I'd bet steak dinners all
&gt; around they're similar to SUV/car statistics. I'd also wager that the
&gt; differences in economy between &quot;econo-boxes&quot; an standard passenger cars are
&gt; similar to the differences in cars and SUV's. And I'd bet my last DIME that
&gt; not a single anti-SUV'r would argue against modern full size cars based on
&gt; those facts. ;)

"/> You're on, for the first one at least. I doubt that a similar weight
and power passenger car would fail to achieve greater economy than a
SUV, and I'd be the first to welcome the return of the full-sized car.

Only in your mind is there no correlation apparently. Kennedy
was a Democrat and Reagan was a Republican and they both reduced
marginal tax rates for the same reason, to grow a stagnate
economy. I worked both times. The problem has always been the
Congress spends too much money in the effort to buy votes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Too harsh. Often depends on the choices one makes.

&gt; In the last three places I have lived (Fort Collins CO, San Jose CA
&gt; and Chelmsford MA), I made explicit choices to live in a place that
&gt; would allow me to bicycle to places I travel daily e.g. work,
&gt; groceries, etc. I explicitly traded off cheaper (further away)
&gt; housing with other factors.

&gt; Obviously there are places where weather is tougher or one could have
&gt; made choices to live far enough away or via busy freeways that make it
&gt; tougher particularly to retrofit cycling back into an existing
&gt; situation. Weather can play a factor (e.g. in New England I stopped
&gt; cycling winter months with the dark/ice... but in Colorado I cycle
&gt; through the winter). Destinations can play a role (riding from here
&gt; to Denver 50+ miles is not practical on daily basis, but if I needed
&gt; to ride to Denver each day I would instead move very close to work).
&gt; Family/children can make things a lot tougher, but again I know of
&gt; people who have made choices to allow that as well. Health can also
&gt; play a role.

&gt; In my particular case, I sold my automobile two years ago and took off
&gt; for a 12 month trip to travel by bicycle. In 17,700+ miles that year
&gt; I crossed the US, did one lap around Australia and spent time riding
&gt; in New Zealand and India. Each day meant I took my limited belongings
&gt; packed them all with me and traveled to the next place. On other
&gt; cycle trips I've pretty much cycled through half of the largest metro
&gt; areas in this US as well as 45 states.

&gt; On return from that trip 12 months ago, I made some choices that would
&gt; enable me to keep riding my bicycle as primary transportation. In
&gt; particular, I chose to live close enough to work, shopping, etc. In
&gt; twelve months I haven't yet purchased an automobile but I have rented
&gt; three or four times for destinations that are more practical via car.
&gt; At $50-$70 total cost for a weekend rental and four weekends a year, I
&gt; can't own a car for that cost. My perspective on destinations is a
&gt; bit different (e.g. I'll look at 15 miles away as being an hour of
&gt; travel and so may not go there as frequently as someone else would hop
&gt; in their car)... but I also feel more connected to weather, moon
&gt; phases, sights/smells/sounds around town than if I were always in a
&gt; car/SUV. I will ride 80-100 miles in a day on weekend, mostly for
&gt; recreation but potentially to visit further away. I might purchase a
&gt; car in next few months but even then don't expect it to become my
&gt; primary vehicle (and this will not be as frugal as renting
&gt; occasionally).

&gt; I would assert that many (obviously not all) adults could make choices
&gt; to lessen auto usage and some even could even choose to use bicycle as
&gt; a primary transportation. I am one example. Retrofitting a choice of
&gt; bicycle as primary transportation in an existing situation may likely
&gt; be considerably more difficult than making up front choices of the
&gt; situation you get into.

&gt; It is not a choice I force on others and I do respect choices others
&gt; make. But, a &quot;only for 12 year olds&quot; attitude also doesn't
&gt; necessarily reflect the choices I have been able to make.

"/> You must either work in the middle of nowhere most of the time, have no
problem living in a tiny studio apartment, or make a fortune at your job,
considering living outside of the ghetto and yet within 5 miles from your
job means you're paying a psychotic premium in most major cities... You
mentioned moving close to work in Denver; you better make hundreds of
thousands per year independantly if your job is close to downtown Denver.
For many people, living close to downtown areas isn't an option, unless they
want to live in the ghetto and send any kids they have to ghetto schools,
which - to me - is a problem waiting to happen. Your lifestyle choice is
not applicable to much of the US population, and even if it were, it's not
an attractive choice to many who live in major cities and can't afford a
$1400+/month 2-bedroom apt, or aren't willing to put their children at risk
in a cheaper neighborhood... Granted, my outlook is largely influenced by
living in CA and knowing how high our costs-of-living are, but most cities
outside of middle America have insanely high costs... One can't ride their
bicycle a reasonable distance to work and keep their kids in a safe
environment - here in Sacramento - unless your workplace AND your house are
in a suburb, and even then most suburbs around here are either psychotically
expensive or are developing into ghettos. Downtown Sac? Forget about it,
unless you make several hundreds of thousands per year, or don't care about
your kids passing the homeless, the addicts, and the psychotic every day.
Things aren't as simple as you make them out to be, for most of the country.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I suppose a car won't?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are so fixated on SUVs, you fail to recognize that it's the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DRIVERS who can be unsafe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the only beef i have with them is that its difficult to see around
em...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such as when backing out of a parking space.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also, when in an unregulated left turn lane, if the vehicle directly
across
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from you also making a left turn is a taller wider vehicle, its
difficult to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gauge oncoming traffic.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; i run into this problem daily.. on my scooter or motorcycle, its not
bad,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; since i can just creep out and check the traffic, but in a car its
more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; YMMV... if i wanted a SUV, id buy one.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as for the gas price issue? anyone whos bought one since the last
time gas
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was $2/gal has no right to bitch... its been $2/gal before, and itll
be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; $2/gal again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;And yet they do. Again and again. They know gas is high or will be, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;they can't resist the temptation to drive that flashy, rugged vehicle
like the
&gt;&gt;&gt;the other people at the supermarket are driving.

&gt;&gt; See? Again you post your envy.
&gt;&gt; If it were otherwise, you wouldn't assume that people do things for
&gt;&gt; the same reason you do them.

&gt; Since you seem to be clueless as to what constitiutes envy,

&gt; 1 : painful or resentful awareness of an advantage enjoyed by another
&gt; joined with a desire to possess the same advantage.

&gt; I have yet to post anything remotely close to show I have a desire
&gt; for an SUV. I see no advantage to owning one to simply commute,
&gt; get groceries, etc. If I wanted one, I would simply buy one. It's
&gt; that easy. Nothing prevents me from purchasing one except I do not 'need'
&gt; one. The majority of owners don't 'need' them.

Please stay away from the livestock Haven't the suffered enough?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;gotten to the point where our government has to shove hormone

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;by threatening trade sanctions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Those countrys' governments don't want it. Yet when I was in Germany
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there were places proudly advertising &quot;U.S. Beef&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Just wait until a US cow comes down with BSE (mad cow disease.) They
&gt;&gt;&gt;won't be advertising it then.

&gt;&gt;Rather a non sequitur, isn't it? Since in fact no US cow has come
&gt;&gt;down with BSE. Nor foot-and-mouth disease, anytime recently.

&gt;It isn't a non-sequitur when you understand that the reason various
&gt;countries have merchants advertising US beef is because there have
&gt;been no US BSE cases. It wasn't long ago they were advertising
&gt;French, German and japanese beef for that reason.

&gt;&gt;There are controls in place to prevent the transmission of FMD to the U.S.
&gt;&gt;If you don't test for BSE, partly due to the incubation period you likely
&gt;&gt;won't find it - the protocols for the detection and prevention of FMD and
&gt;&gt;BSE do not bear comparison at all - talk about a non-sequitur. To say that
&gt;&gt;&quot;no US cow has come down with BSE&quot; is naive - not reported would be more
&gt;&gt;accurate... hardly the kind of thing that is easily admitted. The deer &amp;
&gt;&gt;elk farms kept quiet about their CWD cases.

&gt;The interesting thing about CWD is that it is rampant in natural herds
&gt;which are presumably not cannibalistic nor even carnivorous. And I
&gt;don't think that the sheep were being fed ground-up sheep when scrapie
&gt;emerged in the early 18th century. This agent is murderously
&gt;infective. Ask a medical examiner if he wants to autopsy a suspected
&gt;CJD.

&gt;Assuming that this thing couldn't emerge in US herds is naive, even if
&gt;there are no dubious feeding practices.
