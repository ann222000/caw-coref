Daily Reflections

ATTRACTION, NOT PROMOTION

Through many painful experiences, we think we have arrived
at what that policy ought to be. It is the opposite in many
ways of usual promotional practice. We found that we had to
rely upon the principle of attraction rather than promotion.
TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, pp. 180-81

While I was drinking I reacted with anger, self-pity and
defiance against anyone who wanted to change me. All I wanted
then was to be accepted by another human simply as I was and,
curiously, that is what I found in A.A. I became the custodian
of this concept of attraction, which is the principle of our
Fellowship's public relations. It is by attraction that I can
best reach the alcoholic who still suffers. I thank God for
having given me the attraction of a well-planned and
established program of Steps and Traditions. Through humility
and the support of my fellow sober members, I have been able
to practice the A.A. way of life through attraction, not
promotion.

Twenty-Four Hours A Day

A.A. Thought For The Day

The A.A. way is the way of sobriety. A.A. is known everywhere
as a method that has been successful with alcoholics. Doctors,
psychiatrists and clergymen have had some success. Some men
and women have got sober all by themselves. We believe that A.A.
is the most successful and happiest way to sobriety. And yet
A.A. is not wholly successful. Some are unable to achieve
sobriety and some slip back into alcoholism after they have had
some measure of sobriety. Am I deeply grateful to have found A.A.?

Meditation For The Day

Gratitude to God is the theme of Thanksgiving Day. The pilgrims
gathered to give thanks to God for their harvest, which was
pitifully small. When we look around us at all the things we
have today, how can we help being grateful to God? Our families,
our homes, our friends, our A.A. fellowship; all these things
are free gifts of God to us. &quot;But for the grace of God,&quot; we would
not have them.

Prayer For The Day

I pray that I may be very grateful today. I pray that I may
not forget where I might be but for the grace of God.

***********************************************************

As Bill Sees It

High and Low, p. 314

When our membership was small, we dealt with &quot;low-bottom cases&quot;
only. Many less desperate alcoholics tried A.A., but did not succeed
because they could not make the admission of their hopelessness.

In the following years, this changed. Alcoholics who still had their
health, their families, their jobs, and even two cars in the garage,
began to recognize their alcoholism. As this trend grew, they were
joined by young people who were scarcely more than potential
alcoholics. How could people such as these take the First Step?

By going back in our own drinking histories, we showed them that
years before we realized it we were out of control, that our drinking
even then was no mere habit, that it was indeed the beginning of a
fatal progression.

Walk In Dry Places

*** **Spaces in Togetherness
Friendship
One of the beautiful aspects of AA is the bonding that develops among
members.  We truly do achieve a closeness with some people that is
unlike anything we ever had before.
The danger in such friendships is that we may become too close in some
ways.  Without realizing it, we may be making too many demands on
others' time.  This can become suffocating to them and eventually
detrimental to the friendship.
In such situations, we need to remember the words of Kahlil Gibran; &quot;Let
there be spaces in your togetherness.&quot;   However, close we feel to
others, we must allow them their space.
We should also remember to respect others' privacy as well as their
anonymity.  AA should give us close friendships, but not to the point of
suffocation.
I'll remember today not to overstep my boundaries in any friendship.
There must be spaces in our togetherness.

Keep It Simple

*** ** The purpose of freedom is to create it for others.---Bernard Malamud
Sobriety is freedom. With this freedom, we have a responsibility to help
other addicts who still suffer. The program tells us this in Step
Twelve. We do this by telling our stories and offering hope.
We must be ready to care, to give ourselves. This is what spirituality
is about. When we help others, we prepare the road for those who enter
the program after us.
Tradition Five of the Twelve Traditions says, &quot;Each group has but one
primary purpose---to carry its message to the alcoholic who still
suffers.&quot; It means we get better by helping others.
Prayer for the Day:  Higher Power, help me create more freedom. Bring me
to where I'm needed. Help me carry the message well.
Action for the Day:  Today, I'll think of ways I can help the addict who
still suffers. Then I'll chose one way I can be of help. I'll talk with
my sponsor about it, and I'll follow through with my plan.**

**Alcoholics Anonymous - Fourth Edition

BUILDING A NEW LIFE - Hallucinating and restrained by sheriff's deputies
and hospital staff, this once-happy family man received an unexpected
gift from God--a firm foundation in sobriety that would hold up through
good times and bad.

That year I went to an alcohol treatment program twice.  The first time
I was in treatment, I was shaving at the mirror in the bathroom and it
seemed to me that my beard was growing back in as fast as I could shave
it off.  Even though I was in a hospital gown, I escaped, running down
the streets and jumping up and over fences.  I was on the porch of a
woman's house banging on the door for her to let me in when the police
arrived.  I tried to convince them she was my life and my children were
inside, but they saw the hospital bracelet on my wrist, and they took me
back to the program.

Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions

Step One - &quot;We admitted we were powerless over alcohol--that our lives
had become unmanageable.&quot;

When first challenged to admit defeat, most of us revolted. We had
approached A.A. expecting to be taught self-confidence. Then we had been
told that so far as alcohol is concerned, self-confidence was no good
whatever; in fact, it was a total liability. Our sponsors declared that
we were the victims of a mental obsession so subtly powerful that no
amount of human willpower could break it. There was, they said, no such
thing as the personal conquest of this compulsion by the unaided will.
Relentlessly deepening our dilemma, our sponsors pointed out our
increasing sensitivity to alcohol--an allergy, they called it. The
tyrant alcohol wielded a double-edged sword over us: first we were
smitten by an insane urge that condemned us to go on drinking, and then
by an allergy of the body that insured we would ultimately destroy
ourselves in the process. Few indeed were those who, so assailed, had
ever won through in single-handed combat. It was a statistical fact that
alcoholics almost never recovered on their own resources. And this had
been true, apparently, ever since man had first crushed grapes.

Resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.

Father Leo's Daily Meditation

CERTAINTY

&quot;The certainties of one age are
the problems of next.&quot;
-- R. H. Tawney

I was a religious bigot. I did not know that I was a bigot, but now I
see how closed and
narrow my thinking was. I craved for certainty because I felt it would
give me security
and happiness but it never did. I argued dogmas that I did not believe;
the plight of the
unhappy hypocrite!

Today I live only in the certainty of the day. Today I know that what
worked for me
yesterday will work for me today if I am open to love, truth, honesty
and change.
Change is not necessarily &quot;difference&quot; if I see it as part of a process
rather than an
event. Yesterday is linked to today, and together they forge tomorrow.
The one thing
of which I can be certain is change. The God of Truth is revealed in the
change;
the acceptance of this fact is spirituality.

May I continue to grow in the spiritual life by my continued desire to
change and be
tolerant.

***********************************************************

&quot;But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made
us alive with
Christ even when we were dead in transgressions--it is by grace you have
been
saved.&quot;
Ephesians 2:4-5

&quot;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you
rest. Take my
yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart,
and you will find
rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.&quot;
Matthew 11:28-30

Daily Inspiration

Tranquility lies in self-improvement. Lord, help me to worry less about
the faults of others and use my energy to enhance my own strengths and
eliminate my weaknesses.

If you have more than you need, but still feel it isn't enough, then you
are poor. Lord, may I take time to recognize and enjoy my blessings.

*Ask and you shall receive,*
*Seek and ye shall find, *
* Knock and it shall be opened unto you. *
* Matthew 7:7
