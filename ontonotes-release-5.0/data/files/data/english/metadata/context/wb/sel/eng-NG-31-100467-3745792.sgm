In the interest of saving what little sanity I have left, I hope one of
the math types out there will be able to provide a solution to this
little problem:

I recently had occasion to calculate the series of incremential solar
returns tabulated in the table below.

Date         Sun            MC         LST
2-24-1959   5 PI 25   12 AQ 52    21:01:18
3-26-1959   5 AR 25    5 AR 08    00:18:49
4:26:1959   5 TA 25    1 SA 34    15:57:49
5:27:1959   5 GE 25   18 CP 27    19:19:55
6-27-1959   5 CA 25    6 CA 56     6:31:02

My data is 2-24-43, 3:41:10 CWT, Chicago. The charts were calculated
for Whittier, CA.

One would assume that in returns of this type, where the Sun is
advanced by exactly 30 degrees, that the MC would advance in an orderly
manner on the order of 37-38 degrees, since it moves about 450 degrees
per year. Yet one can see from the table that this is not the case.

When I first saw this I suspected an error in Winstar (I have found
several), so I calculated th same charts by hand, and got essentially
the same numbers in all cases.

I cannot believe that as the Sun is advanced in even 30 degree
increments, the MC would jump around like this. Can anyone offer an
explanation?

Thanks in advance,

Bob

Bob,

A solar return is calculated for the exact moment when the sun returns
to the exact position it held in your natal chart.

So the charts above are correct.

It never deviates or it would not be a "solar return". Get it? The
dates may change because the sun returns at different times every year
to that position.

Sorry, Bob. I misread your question.

Apologies. :P

No, the MC and ASc will change not exactly as some signs are fast
rising and some are slow rising, the the angles will be different each
year and not exactlty the same amount.

With due respect to LL it has little to do with signs of long/short
ascension.

In the time between the two solar returns the Sun has travelled 30°
exactly.

But the sun's motion is 1.0056° per day (in Feb) so that there is a
residual 0.0056° per day. After the sun has travelled 30° to reach its
return  30.056 days have elapsed. The residual is a bit over 1.5 hours, and
in addition 2 hours of sidereal time = about 3.5 hours. This is what
compounds the periods in successive returns that you observe.

Your assumption about the MC positions changing in orderly increments
would only be true if there were 360 days in the year, so that exactly
30 days elapses between the angle charts in question, but as you can
see from the dates that you give, that is not the case - the dates and
the time of day of the solar return angle charts are all over the
place.

This is the beauty of solar returns.  The lack of relationship between
one year's solar return chart and the next year's solar return chart
adds an element of unpredictability and freedom to the individual's
life, and makes it worthwhile to study each year's solar return chart.
This is as opposed to secondary progressions, where one year's
progressed chart is little changed from the previous year's progressed
chart.

Halloran Software has implemented the Volguine Method of Interpreting
Solar Returns, which is a 15-step method.

Whew, finally some "learned professionals" Martin and John have shown
up to clarify. I was hoping you guys were hanging about and might drop
in. :)  Thank you! LL

This has nothing to do with the Asc, it has to do with why the MC
doesn't move forward in an even manner. Look at the data I posted: the
MC actually moves back and forth!

RM: Libralove has put you on the right track already, but this simplified
answer will help some more:
The TIME that successive solar returns occur, may as well be considered
random. That TIME (sidereal time) is actually the same thing as an MC. An MC
is the sidereal time divided by 15 and then with a bit of fiddling it is
turned into a zodiac degree. The Ascendant is then derived from the MC, or
more specifically, from the sidereal time.

I understand about the Sun's rate of motion changing, especially after
the winter solstice, when it is slowing down, and I had considered that
as the explanation.  But it seems to me that the change in the ST for
each 30 degree movement of the Sun would increase in a fairly smooth
and uniform manner. If you look at the differences between each
succeeding ST it is apparent that they are lurching all over the place,
like a drunk staggering down the street!

What I'm going to do is calculate a return for each 30 degree increment
from one SR to the next, so I can plot the ST as a curve. I'll post the
results here, on the off-chance anyone is interested.

This raises another question, regarding the progressing of SR's. I'm
not really up on this, but isn't the PSSR calculated in some way that
results in a smooth advance of the angles from one year to the next? If
the angles really do lurch around as my data seem to indicate, then I
wonder how one could find such a system valid?

OK: I conducted my little experiment. I did tell a little lie however:
I'm not going to post all the numbers, as I said above. Too many to
type out. If anyone is interested I'll scan in my worksheet and email
it to them.

Here's what I did: I had the computer calculate my SR for 1959, and
then 12 incremental 30 degree returns, the last incremental return
being equivalent to the 1960 SR. As a check I did the 1960 return in
the usual way, and got the same results. OK so far.

The MC for the 1959 return was 12Leo22, and that for 1960 was
13Scorpio25, an advance of about 90 degrees, which is what we would
expect. OK so far.

I tabulated the JD for each return, and then took the difference
between each return. The differences behaved exactly as I thought they
would, increasing until the June return, then decreasing until
December, when they started increasing again. A nice smooth curve. OK
so far.

Now the ST increases by 0:03:56 per day, and is (I believe) uniform
throughout the year. Also, the only changes made to the ST at Greenwich
and the LST (which is what the computer gives me) is the correction for
the longitude. That is constant, so can be ignored. There is the
correction for the interval, but that is no more than a few minutes, so
can be ignored here. OK so far (I think).

If all of the above is true, then it seems to me that the change is LST
from one incremental return to the next should be equal to the
difference in JD's times 0:03:56 per day, which is about two hours. A
glance at the list of LST's of the returns shows that none of the times
are two hours apart, or even close. For example, the one from 6-26 to
7-28 goes from 17:49 to 6:36! Not OK so far.

I know I'm missing something here, but could some kind-hearted soul
please explain to me what it is?

For your example involving the dates and times when the sun is 30
degrees apart on June 26, 1959, 17:49 and on July 28, 1959, 6:36, the
distance in JD between those is 31.53 days.  Are you expecting the
angle charts to happen at roughly the same time of day?  Since in the
example, it takes the sun 31.53 days to move 30 degrees, and in other
months the fractional JD distance will be different, it is unrealistic
to think that the time of day will be generally the same.  If you are
not convinced, post the fractional JDs as well as the distances between
them that you calculated for each 30 degree angle chart that year.
