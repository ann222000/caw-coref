Bush the Empire Slayer
By Bernard Chazelle
Created Jan 23 2007 - 9:01am
If you fancy losing an argument, try shooting down my contention that
Mikhail Gorbachev is the leading historical figure of our time. Not one to
miss a shooting opportunity, Dick Cheney tried. To my surprise, he won.

Westerners fondly remember Gorbachev for finishing off an ailing Soviet
empire left bleeding from its Afghan travails. Defusing half a century of
nuclear tension can leave a mark on impressionable minds. On Cheney's-not so
much. The former Defense Secretary had a tender spot for the Cold War and
never forgave Gorbachev for ending it with not even a kind word for defense
contractors. Cheney is the quintessential warrior, with plenty of dead
quails and birdshot-peppered lawyers to prove it. He is the gallant
hussar-one day greenlighting "Shock and Awe" to give Guernica a second
chance; the next day apprising US Senator Pat Leahy of his favorite sexual
technique: "Fuck yourself!" (1)

Quite the martial wag, the man Maureen Dowd calls Big-Time Dick saluted the
fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 by persuading his boss to invade Panama (for
reasons no one seems able to remember). And today it is anybody's guess
which Caribbean island the United States will invade to celebrate its
victory in Iraq.

Dick Cheney is a man of war, and a man on a mission: a crusader who won't
rest until the name Bush Jr is etched in the history books-not lost in the
microscopic print of the endnotes section, mind you, as is destined to be
Senior's fate, but glowing in the radiant typeface of a chapter heading.
That mission, for once, is all but accomplished. In January of 2001, George
W. Bush took-er, grabbed-the reins of an American Empire at its zenith. He
will soon hand back a smoldering wreckage of broken lives, enduring hatred,
and vanished influence. Michael Ignatieff has called Pax Americana Empire
Lite. (2) A better phrase would be Empire Short-Lived, or, if you're William
F. Buckley Jr and the vernacular ruffles your literary feathers, Imperium
Brevissimum. At a recent ceremony for his son Jeb, George H. W. Bush was
caught on national television sobbing uncontrollably. Pity the man who
stands one short letter away from the worst president in US history. The
letter is H, as in H for hubris.

"We're winning! " exulted Bush last October. (3) Well... actually, "We're
not winning," he clarified a few weeks later, but "We're not losing" either.
(4)

So "We're wosing," quipped the Guardian's cartoonist Steve Bell. Indeed, we
are; and for you, Mr President, I shall count the wosing ways.

" You smug-faced crowds with kindling eye
Who cheer when soldier lads march by,
Sneak home and pray you'll never know
The hell where youth and laughter go. "
- Siegfried Sassoon
Somewhere, deep in the cold, worm-infested soil that a mother will keep
watered by tears, lies one of 3,000 young Americans. (5) Dispersed across
the land, thousands more will forever carry the scars of war in their
battered bodies and hollowed souls, mutants battling hellish shadows and
silent phantoms. And the Iraqis, yes those, Mr President, see them spiral
into Dante's lower rings of hell, as they join the fastest-growing sect in
the land: the dead-hundreds of thousands strong. (6) Watch the White Man's
Burden devolve into an orgy of torture and mayhem. (Has it ever devolved
into anything else?)

The words Abu Ghraib, Guant√°namo, detainee bill, and extraordinary rendition
are seared in the world's consciousness as the badges of shame of a
democracy gone mad. According to Pew's most recent "Global Opinion" survey,
"anti-Americanism is deeper and broader now than at any time in modern
history." (7) The war effort's claim on the US treasury will soon exceed
$600 billion: more than Vietnam; (4) more than all the money ever spent on
cancer research; (8) more than enough to "race for the cure" all the way to
Alpha Centauri. We're wosing big, Mr President.

Historians will ponder how one gangly caveman and nineteen scrawny
associates turned America into the land of the kind-of-free (53rd freest
press in the world, tied with Botswana (9)) and the home of the petrified.
The sons and daughters of the nation that stood up to Hitler and Tojo now
file through airport security barefoot, much as they would walk, shoeless,
into a mosque-a mosque, they pray, empty of Muslims.

Cravenness is bigotry's favorite nourishment, and cynics might expect the
political class to gorge on it by blaming our imperial agony on the natives.
In America, today, cynics rarely go wrong; and the air, indeed, is thick
with talk of fainthearted hordes of Mesopotamian ingrates, who quail at the
latest bombing and wail at the moon in exotic garb.

Not long ago, the achingly earnest Nicholas D. Kristof, a New York Times
columnist whose only sin is to be more virtuous than you-and keep you
informed of this in each and every one of his bromidic columns-reassured his
readers that the trouble is not with the Muslims but with the Arabs. They
are too violent and they give Islam a bad name. (10) Well, that settles
that. Funny, though, that in the last twenty years Americans have outkilled
Arabs in a ratio in excess of one hundred to one. But there I go again,
nitpicking, while Saint Kristof is back in Cambodia, rescuing teenage
prostitutes one Pulitzer prize at a time.

Not to be undone, The Times' resident flat-earther, Thomas L. Friedman,
never tires of recycling Golda Meir's racist rant about hateful Arabs. He
writes:

"We can't keep asking Americans to sacrifice their children for people who
hate each other more than they love their own children." (11)

The hate-lovers never asked for anybody's sacrifice, Mr Friedman. To steal a
thought from the heroic Robert Fisk, all they ever craved was the one
freedom you've always refused to grant them: freedom from you! The
Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen, a man who's never met a heap of
moral compost he did not want to climb, wrote recently that "the prudent use
of violence [against Muslims] could be therapeutic." (12) Being a kind soul,
I'll assume that Cohen is unaware of the ideological pedigree of that phrase
and that he doesn't read what he writes-apparently, a skill highly prized in
American punditry.

" Your new-caught, sullen peoples,
Half-devil and half-child. "
- Rudyard Kipling
To talk the neocolonial talk from the plush comfort of the imperial capital
is easy. To walk the walk is not. US military expenditures exceed those of
all nations on earth combined. And yet battling a ragtag band of lightly
armed insurgents was more than the world's mightiest army could take. It is
"about broken," laments Colin Powell-and, by the way, "We are losing." (13)
A recent Marine Corps memo concedes that Coalition Forces "are no longer
capable of militarily defeating the insurgency in al-Anbar. " (14)

Last summer's stabilization push in Baghdad, Operation Together Forward II,
proved a dismal failure: the violence actually rose by 43 percent! (15)

The US military has been fighting in Iraq longer than it did in World War
II. What does it have to show for it? Not much. Unlike Vietnam, Iraq is a
country-wide killing field, one giant Sniper Alley where sporting the Stars
and Stripes can get you killed any time, anywhere. Not a square inch of
Iraqi soil is safe for the Americans outside the high walls of their
fortresses. To borrow from Cheney's vast repertoire of bons mots, the US
counterinsurgency is in its last throes; hence the "surge" and kindred shows
of desperation. Israel's finest military historian, Martin van Creveld, does
not mince words: "The American military have proved totally incompetent."
(16)

In Iraq, the world's sole superpower has been the world's serial
superbungler. (I've always wondered if the trope of the "sole superpower"
serves any purpose other than teaching us how thin the line is between the
sublime and the farcical.)

Whose fault? (The wrong question for a moral perspective-starting the war
was the sin, not losing it-but the right one here.) Breathtaking as they
were, the majestic vistas of Rumsfeld's ineptitude were little more than a
convenient excuse for war advocates with egg on their faces. The grand
whining parade has already begun, and mealy-mouthed apologists are being
wheeled in on bloated floats to proffer lame excuses about inadequate troop
levels, insufficient 4GW training, political fecklessness, etc. Eventually,
the chest beating will die down as it always does, with the blame for the
debacle pinned on the dirty antiwar hippies.

But hippies don't fight wars. The Pentagon does. It did, and it lost. One
reason-not even the most important-is the military's endemic inability to
win hearts and minds. Early in the war, the Guardian sounded the alarm:

"Senior British military officers on the ground are making it clear they
are dismayed by the failure of US troops to try to fight the battle for
hearts and minds. They also made plain they are appalled by reports over the
weekend that US marines killed Iraqi civilians, including women and
children, as they seized bridges outside Nassiriya in southern Iraq." (17)

The emphasis on force protection is a far cry from past imperial practices.
The Romans, Spaniards, British, French, and conquerors of yore seldom
agonized over their own casualties. To their credit, Americans do. But this
comes at a moral cost: US soldiers are brave but the casualty-averse
military doctrine of their commanders is cowardly. That, in essence, is what
Susan Sontag, Arundhati Roy, and Bill Maher said-right before the lynching
began. (18-20) In a similar show of disgust diplomatically stripped of the
C-word, this British officer echoed the sentiment:

"US troops have the attitude of shoot first and ask questions later. They
simply won't take any risk... Unfortunately, when we explained our rules of
engagement which are based around the principle of minimum force, the US
troops just laughed." (21)

Lebanon and Somalia notwithstanding, the United States rarely cuts and runs.
It did not in Vietnam. It fought to the death-of the other guy-and then cut
and walked when victory proved elusive. Iraq is too central to US hegemonic
fantasies to allow a speedy retreat: it'll be done cut-and-crawl style, with
enough pit stops to admire the fireworks over Iran. Bush's playbook: (1) run
out the clock; (2) anoint successor as "the dope who snatched defeat out of
the jaws of victory and handed Iran the victor's crown"; (3) let the etching
in the history books begin.

Could the invasion have succeeded? Not a chance. All the grousing about
incompetent planning is the age-old excuse-making prattle of losers. Leave
aside the not-so-trifling fact that the United States never had the proper
DNA for empire (lite or otherwise). It is the incontrovertible reality of
the 21st century that the time for the White Man's Burden has passed. Not
only is the era of empire gone, but the days of the so-called liberal
hegemonic order are numbered. Even before 9/11, the cumulative impact of
European integration, the rise of Asian powers, and the resurgence of Muslim
identity sounded the death knell for American hegemony. To hasten the burial
will be one of Bush's legacies. Alas, incalculable misery in the Middle
East, enduring anti-American hatred, and future terrorist attacks in London,
Paris, and Seattle will be another one.

The same Madeleine Albright who called the United States "the indispensable
nation"-presumably to avoid confusion with the dispensable ones-taunted
Colin Powell with the wickedest double-entendre since Mae West: "What's the
point of having this superb military you're always talking about if we can't
use it? " (22) To paraphrase an old line, it is better for a big country to
keep its superb army idle and let the world think it's not much of a
superpower than to use it and remove all doubt.

* * *

Bush's neoconservative doctrine seeks to apply Straussian philosophy to the
unfettered pursuit of US energy interests. Its unspoken motto: "perpetual
war for perpetual peace." The rough idea-and the idea is, indeed, rough-is
to play this century's Great Game (first prize: control of Mideast oil
supply) under the banner of national security. Until we whacked them on the
head, Iraqis had never expressed much desire to attack us. To the lesser
minds, therefore, the idea of fighting them there so we wouldn't have to
fight them here always teetered on the edge of insanity. To the neocons'
delight, 9/11 came to cleanse the public discourse of the yelpings of lesser
minds.

And so, today, we gather to honor the superior minds, all of these men (they
are mostly men) who so decisively turned out the lights on the American
empire. Heading the roll call is none other than the Decider himself. If
you're among the wise who chose to sit out the Bush years at the bottom of a
well, you need to know only two things about the man: the first is that he
is President of the United States; the second is that he said:

"One of the hardest parts of my job is to connect Iraq to the war on
terror." (23)

To connect it to the war for terror would indeed be easier. A self-declared
uniter, Bush is beginning to unite the country around the belief that he is
the worst president in US history. (24) Whether his reelection, ipso facto,
makes the electorate the dumbest ever is a logical inference that a
political culture drunk with self-admiration will have trouble getting its
woozy head around.

To call Team Bush a thundering herd of galloping loons is to be
unnecessarily kind. For rarely has daftness been elevated to such a lofty
plane of power and influence. The early days of the Iraq adventure set the
tone. A year after Defense strategist Ken Adelman infamously called the
coming liberation of Iraq a "cakewalk," Paul Wolfowitz, then Rumsfeld's
deputy, used the occasion of an interview with NPR's Melissa Block to stamp
the prediction with the Pentagon's gold seal.

"We're seeing today how much the people of Poland and Central and Eastern
Europe appreciate what the United States did to help liberate them from the
tyranny of the Soviet Union. I think you're going to see even more of that
sentiment in Iraq. There's not going to be the hostility that you described
Saturday. There simply won't be." (25)

Hostility? What an idea! On the eve of the war, in a vice presidential
reprise of Tom Cruise's couch-hopping antics, Cheney stepped on the set of
NBC's "Meet The Press"

to share the love: "We will, in fact, be greeted as liberators." (26) For a
mere $44 billion a year,(27) all we got from US intelligence was a silly
update of an old movie script:

Renault: And what in Heaven's name brought you to Baghdad?
Bush: The sweets and the flowers. I came to Baghdad for love.
Renault: Love! What love? We're in the Middle East.
Bush: I was misinformed.

Christmas 2003 came early in Iraq and WMD-stuffed stockings were spotted
everywhere by late March. Or so Rumsfeld told ABC News' George
Stephanopoulos: "We know where they are. They're in the area around Tikrit
and Baghdad and east, west, south and north somewhat." (28) East, west,
south and nowhere somewhat. In September of that year, the part-time AEI
scholar, full-time slimeball Richard Perle got all his neurons firing at
once to produce this marvel of crystal gazing:

"And a year from now, I'll be very surprised if there is not some grand
square in Baghdad that is named after President Bush." (29)

Or perhaps some grand morgue? Which naturally leads us to the 600-billion
dollar question: where did they find these people? The answer: in that dank
rodent house known as the American Enterprise Institute. Often found gnawing
on the chicken wire, the rabid ferret Michael Ledeen needs no cage rattling
to work himself into a froth of hysteria:

"Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up some small
crappy little country and throw it against the wall, just to show the world
we mean business." (30)

In their knockoff of Mein Kampf, retitled An End to Evil, Richard Perle and
former Bush speechwriter David Frum give voice to their full-blown dementia
by recommending all-out attacks on anybody ever so slightly Muslim. Why?
Because "There is no middle way for Americans: It is victory or holocaust."
(31) Salon's Gary Kamiya calls the Perle-Frum worldview "a strange
combination of Hobbes and Popeye." (32) Harsh on Popeye. Me, I have no
patience for moral midgets who've seen their Napoleonic hour arrive. Like
Alexander in Gordium, I head straight for the deliciously obvious: to end
evil, end Perle and Frum.

The American Enterprise Institute serves to mitigate the most glaring
defects of our democracy. Take the current escalation in Iraq, for example.
President Bush alone grasps the full cosmic immensity of its wisdom, even
calling the idea a "surge" to convey its irresistibility. Alas, the Forces
of Darkness, aka the Pentagon, the Congress, and the American public, will
have none of it. Enter the AEI and its paunchy, double-chinned warmonger,
Frederick W. Kagan. Faster than a chickenhawk can flap its wings, Kagan
demothballs his fave retired general, Jack Keane, and whips up The Surge.
Voil√†. Rasputin would be proud.

* * *

It would be unfair to let Team Bush steal all the credit for the imperial
collapse without a tip of the hat to the White House Dictation Office, also
known as the mainstream media (MSM). Skipping right over the miniskirted
hyena Ann Coulter (a risky stunt but I've got my spiked pogo shoes on), the
oafish junkie Rush Limbaugh, and the assortment of one-trick performing
fleas hopping mad on the AM dial, I shall ascend Mount Olympus to gaze at
the brainy stars of the MSM.

Few shine more brightly than Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, the
supernova of the Murdoch empire-unless red dwarf is a tighter cosmic fit for
someone known to his friends and pet hamster as "Dan Quayle's brain." The
day after the 9/11 attacks, the surrogate brain seized the moment and began
pounding the war drums: "There's a fair amount of evidence that Iraq had
very close associations with Osama bin Laden in the past." (33) There was
not a shred of evidence. A year later, Kristol nuzzled up to The New
Republic's Lawrence F. Kaplan to break into a cakewalk jig on the National
Review dance floor: "Having defeated and then occupied Iraq, democratizing
the country should not be too tall an order for the world's sole
superpower." (34)

Brilliance of this magnitude is Kristol's trademark. Time magazine took
longer than most to realize that and only this month got around to adding
Kristol to its roster of columnists.

Two influential Canadians with a nasty case of empire envy, Mark Steyn and
Michael Ignatieff pulpiteered the good news-one from his stool at the
Chicago Sun-Times, the other from his booster seat at the Harvard Kennedy
School. From Steyn we learned that "Imperialism is the answer" (35) and from
Ignatieff that "The case for empire is that it has become, in a place like
Iraq, the last hope for democracy and stability alike." (2) (I don't know
about you, but the dazzling acumen of the expert never fails to give me
goosebumps!) Former TNR editor Andrew Sullivan, another heavy smoker of the
imperialist's hookah pipe, found his knees wobbly after 9/11 and his left
flank badly exposed: "The decadent Left in its enclaves on the coasts is not
dead-and may well mount what amounts to a fifth column." (36)

Of course, no account of MSM malfeasance would be fitting without at least a
passing glance at the yapping chihuahuas. Newsweek's Howard Fineman woofed a
few choice words of his own: "We had controversial wars that divided the
country. This war united the country and brought the military back." (37)
Well said, Howard. His colleague Chris Matthews yaks at such vertiginous
speeds that his brain emits exotic particles of synchrotronic quirkiness.
One month into the war, he blurted out, "We're all neocons now." A few weeks
later, Matthews highlighted a side of war that too often gets short shrift:
what great, clean fun it is! "Check it out. The women like this war! I think
we like having a hero as our president." (37)

Must a TV show be pornographic just because it's called "Hardball"?

The war has given the American mainstream media a brilliant opportunity to
prove its essential worthlessness. It has shown itself to be little more
than a circus of entertainers and cheerleaders for whom every season is the
silly season. Tragically, the media has failed in its sacred duty to keep a
vigilant, skeptical, critical eye on the centers of power. Who is the
American Robert Fisk, Gideon Levy, or Amira Hass? Whoever they are (and Sy
Hersh proves they exist), why are their writings not filling the op-ed pages
of the great American newspapers? How can the nation that produces the bulk
of Nobel prize winners be stuck with such a sullen bunch of journalistic
mediocrities? The sycophantic enablers of the Fourth Estate have blood on
their hands.

* * *

The unfolding catastrophe in Iraq had a single cause: the reassertion of US
hegemony after 9/11. Its trigger was a rare astral alignment. Big Oil, the
neocons, the Christian fundamentalists, the liberal hawks, AIPAC, the MSM,
and 9/11 all formed cosmic dots in the sky that only one power could-and
did-successfully align: the president of the United States. No American
leader has so much owned a war.

And none has so little owned up to it. Victors are never war criminals.
That's because they get to write the history books. Bush won't have that
chance. The die has been cast and the hour is too late for him or anyone to
alter the unforgiving judgment of posterity. Therein, paradoxically, lies
our quandary. For, if freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose,
then Bush is a free man-free to pursue the most malignant policies, heedless
of the consequences to his unworsenable presidential standing. Beware the
desperation of a cornered man.

The apostle of imperial dominance, Bush slew the "last empire." The towering
figure of our time, he is a piteously small man. The self-anointed emissary
of a "higher father,"

he is servant to no power but himself. The captain of the sinking ship has
laid his command upon his fellow Americans: "Ask not what your country can
do for you; ask what you can do for me." No sacrifice of life shall be too
great, no damage to civil liberties too high, no expenses too vast for a
vainglorious man deluded by fantastic dreams of redemption by force.

But who besides the bereaved will mourn? Who besides the orphan will
whimper? Who besides the humiliated will stare back? Who besides the thugs
and the craven will lead? Patriotism is a lovely thing. In its name, some go
dying by the side of an Iraqi road in twitching agony; others go shopping in
oversized automobiles festooned with yellow ribbons. We all play our
part-and nobody else's.

Yeats bemoaned an era when the best lacked all conviction, while the worst
were full of passionate intensity. Today, Kristol blusters and hectors,
Cheney scolds and forebodes, Bush struts and smirks. Meanwhile, the giant,
timid chorus listens politely to the deafening silence of the outraged-and
the mad march of war goes on.

" The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall;
Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds,
And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds."
