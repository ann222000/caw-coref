Absolutely no BDSM:

I had a learning experience this evening.

It had to do with a new countertop oven that is not just microwave, but
also convection (and broils &amp; roasts, too) ...

and some plastic wrap.

Apparently something to do with the pre-heat part of convection cooking.

I just don't get it!!!!!

I don't get it either, from what was written, but 'pieces'
sounds like there was an explosion.  My experience with microwave
ovens taught me they will give it to me in unpleasant ways when I
fail to follow directions carefully.

Nothing BDSM unless you count burning a few fingertips because I also
forgot that "convection" means HOT.  HOT HOT.

Burning plastic wrap is somehow so .... not ... ironic.

obBDSM:  for those into the whole "mummification" thing, can you learn
*anything* from this in your experiments?

Were you going for some sort of plastic food to *CAVORT* over to some special

You know that when the plastic melts/burns it gives off some really nasty
chemicals don't you?  Picking out the pieces might not be so smart.  More like
removing the outer 1/4 inch just to be sure.

I once made a sponge in my microwave. The outside two thirds were nice, but
the circlur bit near the middle was  the consistency of concrete. Now I
understand why you need to do it a bit, then move it on the turntable...

Yes, in fact, I am familiar with it, but only in very small diameters.
Handy stuff, though!

IIRC one could use a hair dryer to shrink it a bit.

But I don't think I've ever seen it in anything close to a size for
*any* body parts ... and I surely do not want to contemplate what you
could possibly mean by your comment!!

For a cool factor in you have an old but excess microwave and want to
destroy any of those old CDs or DVD's, give one about 10 seconds. But
like shredders you will need replacements from time to time.

&gt; Yes, in fact, I am familiar with it, but only in very small diameters.
&gt; Handy stuff, though!

&gt; IIRC one could use a hair dryer to shrink it a bit.

&gt; But I don't think I've ever seen it in anything close to a size for *any*
&gt; body parts ...
">

I've seen larger heatshrink.
Telephone engineers had to move the switchboard in a building I was working
in.
The cable was 200 pairs, I think. About 1.5" in diameter.
They used heatshrink with an original diameter of 2 -2.5" over the join
between the new cable and the old.
Even larger heatshrink is made.
A quick google found layflat heatshrink tubing 300mm (approx 12") wide.
It's not clear if this is the width when laid flat or is the diameter.
Certainly large enough to go over hands or feet.

Although a hair drier can be used on some tubing, it isn't hot enough for
other stuff.
It depends on the material the tubing is made from and the diameter.
Where more heat is needed, a hot air paint stripper can be used.

I would be very wary of using a hairdrier for long periods on 'dangly bits'.
The vic^H^H^H sub could get very burnt.

But I have always thought it was brought on by natural selection:
Mother Nature has a bias toward violence, cruelty, and ruthlessness.
(Watch a cat that has caught a mouse or bird.  Watch any species
attack its prey.)  What better way to perpetuate these traits through
the world than to create more males?  Testosterone all the way!

(Seriously, though, I had not previously thought of sex ratios
at birth, and was interested to learn that the majority of nations
have between 101 and 117 boys born for every 100 girls.  Per a page at
http://www.photius.com/rankings/population/sex_ratio_at_birth_2006_0....
which refers to the US CIA World Factbook 2006.  Thank you for provid-
ing the spark that set me looking for this.)

Nononono.  These are the things that girls do not know, and when
they (girls) discover boys do know them, usually by walking into the
room in the middle of an experiment, the girls become hysterical or
begin lecturing about blowing out the windows.

There is (at least in my experience) a concerted effort by the
girls to keep the boys from learning about interesting and exciting
phenomena.  Or to keep the boys from sharing their own discoveries
with each other.

I ought to describe some microwave oven experiments here, but
that is getting far, far OT.

But there's always that shrinking plastic used to make cheap double
glazing.  I actually use it to make cheap triple glazing, but I had
thought of using is as a sort of shrink wrap corset.  The amount of
shrinkage isn't enough to be dangerous but, in my fervid imagination,
the effect is fantastic.

It also tears easily if you just pull a bit out and nick it with a pair
of scissors, so it can be removed quickly and easily.

On top of which, for the sub, theres the feel of the hair dryer heat.
