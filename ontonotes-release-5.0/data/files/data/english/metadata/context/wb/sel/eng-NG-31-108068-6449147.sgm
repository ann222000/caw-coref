I'd like to have a small gun in .410 caliber
that can be used in my canoe for defense, rather than offense; for
cottonmouths within six feet.  I found an interesting candidate
here...
http://www.bondarms.com/

I'd like to look at, and hold, the one at the top of this
page...
http://www.bondarms.com/ifirearms.htm

I have a Davis Derringer in .22 Mag, which I bought out of
curiosity.  I wouldn't bet my life on that thing except as a last
resort.  You don't pull the trigger to fire it.  The trigger pull is
so hard that you have to squeeze the entire gun, trigger and all, to
make it shoot.  If you hit a barn with it, it means that you weren't
aiming well.

The Davis is only four inches over all, and is light as a
feather.  The Bond Derringer is six and a quarter inches, and weighs a
pound and a half.  It's made of stainless and has a trigger guard, so
it should be just right for a single canoe.

Has anyone out there ever owned a Bond Derringer?  Are they
well-built and reliable?

Not sure about the Bond Arms, but for the same price you can purchase
"The Judge" from Taurus.

Friend of mine bought 2 at the last gun show.. He loves them.

Well built? ... yes.  Reliable? ... yes.  .410? ... can I film ya fer
AFV?

I got the .357 and started with 158gr LRN at 'round 750fps ... WAY too
stout.  Ended up with somethin' that's much closer to .22short.

Ya'd be WAY better off with a compact (K-frame) revolver in .44spl
'er .45colt ... check Taurus, I used to have a lightweight .45colt
that was purdy good.  I'm sure it was lighter than the Bond.  But a
LOT easier to control.

Otherwise, if ya can find one of the old Ruger .45colt Sheriff's
models, that'd be real nice ... and probly not too much heavier.

Actually, I think that new Ruger P345 ('er whatever) would be kinda
neat ... and not a huge loss if it ends up at the bottom of the river.

The Bond's mostly fer lookin' at.  ;-)

Also look at Taurus' various .45 LC / .410 revolvers.  I saw one; it
looks impressive.  Choice of snubby or long barrel.

If you are going to get something that size, you might as well get a .44
Special Bulldog revolver and have a few more shots, using snake loads.
Most of the time I don't support the use of snake loads anyways, since any
snake you have time to draw and aim at, you can also just avoid,  and if he
is being a pest, just smack him with the paddle.  The paddle, handheld,
manual, M1A1      is a great tool for shoving or smacking snakes.  LOL

I think that's true of the old ones. I have one of those (can't get rid
of it). It's an awful gun!   But it shoots, so it resides in the desk
drawer out at the shop.
I have looked at a lot of derringers, including the Bond guns, and
they look to be a lot better quality. In these days of cheap CNC,
there's just no excuse for any simple gun to be anything BUT
well-machined.  I'd gladly trade my old chrome and plastic derringer for
one of those new SS and wood variations, with some cash thrown in.
Of course, as soon as I did the cheapies would become cult collector
items and the price would shoot up.

I agree. My el-cheapo Derring is .38 Spl, and I don't want to ever shoot
it again. It's hurts like hell!
And a few weeks ago I shot a friends lightweight Taurus revolver in
.45LC. That was also painful.
Now I'm not  averse to recoil particularly, at least I don't think
so. A 1911 doesn't bother me at all. My .380 Keltec that others seem to
find painful is no problem, I can shoot it for hours.
I cannot imagine a .410 in a derringer, even an up-sized one.
Confronted with a cottonmouth and having a .410 derringer at my side, I
might have a difficult choice between a snake bite and having to shoot
that thing!

Or any .38 Special four-incher with CCI's ratshot loads.  Their 9mm
one is impressive.

My cousin has one.  He lives on a very snakey place in the country.  He
keeps it with shot shells in it, and it has served him well.

Now, that, it will do.  I've put 100 .22 Mags through mine,
and there has never been a hint of a misfire.  I can't get rid of
mine, though, either.  It's a curiosity gun.  I take it along when I
go shooting, and let others shoot it.  Lots of folks have never shot a
derringer, and want to see what it handles like.  It's super easy to
clean, too.

I would never use it for concealed carry, though.  If I'm
going to carry a gun, it's going to be a good quality firearm of at
least 9mm caliber.  And I don't want the exposed hammer snagging on my
clothes.

I drooled over that one, first, but I think the derringer
would fit in my life jacket pocket better.

I've got a .44 and I load my own snake loads in .44 and .38.
I've also got a .38 Chief's Special that I could use.  I'm just
looking for something small and with a flat profile that will fit in
the pocket of my life jacket.
