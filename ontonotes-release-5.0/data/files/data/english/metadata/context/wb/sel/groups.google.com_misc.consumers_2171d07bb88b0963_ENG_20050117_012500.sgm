Morris woman fights big cell bill

Text-messaging feature running up wild charges

By Rob Seman, Daily Record

VICTORY GARDENS -- Avis Byfield owes T-Mobile more than $2,000 because
a text messaging function on two cell phones she bought continued to
run after she had turned the phones off and put them away.

The company is standing behind its billing and Byfield has hired a
lawyer to straighten out the mess, which now has gone to a collection
agency and threatens her credit -- and patience.

At one point when she called to complain, she was told: &quot;Your bill is
going up as we speak.&quot;

Byfield doesn't claim to be technology-savvy.

So when she decided to buy her teenage daughters cell phones to keep
in touch with her, Byfield chose T-Mobile, drawn in by the its
television commercials featuring actress Catherine Zeta Jones.

She was only looking for a way to communicate with her daughters, she
said. She didn't know much about text messaging, let alone that such a
feature was included on the phones she purchased.

She found out when her daughters ran up an extra $20 for using the
text-messaging feature. She took the phones away, turned them off, and
figured that would be the last she heard of text-messaging charges.

Wrong.

In October, Byfield received a 742-page document in the mail. It was
her new cell-phone bill. A month later, she received another, 454
pages. Combined, they called for her to pay more than $2,000, most of
which is the result of continued text-messaging fees.

&quot;I didn't know what to do,&quot; Byfield said. &quot;I was besides myself.&quot;

So far in the battle, T-Mobile has credited Byfield $200 as a
courtesy, and another $400 for terminating her account, bringing her
bill to $2,023.

But Byfield, who is unemployed and has gone back to college full-time,
said she does not have the money to pay the bill and is infuriated.

&quot;I just think it's plain simple abuse,&quot; Byfield said.

She hired Rockaway attorney Morris Leo Greb to plead her case to the
company. Greb said that he believes the fees could have been the
result of a glitch, but said his first priority is to get Byfield's
account out of the collection agency's hands before her credit is
ruined.

On Dec. 28, Greb received a reply from T-Mobile, saying the phones'
identifying numbers and signal verified the messages, and said that
Byfield was aware of the charges associated with the service.

&quot;It's very easy, especially when kids are involved, it's very easy for
text messages to accrue,&quot; said T-Mobile spokesman Kyle Warnick in a
Thursday interview.

Warnick said that subscribers who have text messaging must log off the
service to avoid further incoming messages. A subscriber's account is
charged every time the service updates the user's &quot;buddy list,&quot; which
occurs when other friends who use AOL Instant Messaging log on and
off.

&quot;Just turning the phone off does not log the user off,&quot; Warnick said.

Byfield said she might not have been aware that the text-messaging
service was still running even though she turned the phones off.

&quot;Maybe, but after I called them â€¦ shouldn't something be done?&quot;
Byfield asked.

Byfield said she called T-Mobile after receiving the first giant bill
and was instructed to input a code into the phones in order to log off
the service.

When the code did not work, she called the company again, and said she
was told that the code is sometimes unreliable. She said she was also
told &quot;your bill is going up as we speak.&quot;

Byfield said that she was told by the T-Mobile representative that
nothing could be done to help her. Warnick did not have an immediate
response to that allegation.

When she received the second huge bill, she wondered why the company,
now aware that there was a problem, hadn't intervened to stop the
fees, or simply contacted her to inquire about them, like a credit
card company.

&quot;Even after I called them and said 'Do something about it,' I get
stuck with another huge bill,&quot; Byfield said.

Byfield said she wants to make others aware that hidden dangers can
exist in buying cell phones.

&quot;I think they're misleading the public, and I think they're using the
commercials to mislead the people,&quot; Byfield said. &quot;They should tell
the people of all the dangers that can happen.&quot;

Byfield's phones were being charged 5 cents per text message every few
minutes, according to the massive bills, of which only a few pages and
few dollars were dedicated to voice calls made on the phones. Some of
the messages included &quot;bulletins&quot; by America Online, which provides
T-Mobile's text-messaging feature.

&quot;I don't know how I got bills,&quot; Byfield said. &quot;(The phones) weren't
being used.&quot;

I've had T-Mobile for awhile now and think they're the best carrier around.
Never had the slightest problem and have always found their reps responsive
and friendly.

Sounds like another case of teenagers ruining their parents credit and folks
buying cell phones who don't have a clue.

"/> I tend to differ. I just received my December's bill from T-mobile. I have
text messaging on my phone and my daughter experimented a few times... no
big deal. Then just before christmas I got my wife a phone without text
messaging. My daughter used it there as well... I got a 26.00 bill on that
phone for text messaging alone. At least it wasn't 2000 like the article.

I called t-mobile and the news story was confirmed that even updates to the
buddy list (even if phone is off) will incur a .05 charge every time someone
gets online from your buddylist (not sure about going off)

When I talked to the rep her solution was to add text messaging to the
second phone for an additional monthly fee so not to incurr the .05 each
time someone jumps on or off. I didn't want to do that. She said the
alternative was to go on t-mobile's web page and create a filter for the
phone number so not to accept forwarded messages. It was a rather
convoluted process and I'd probably recommend being on line with a tmobile
rep the first time one changes their filtering.

I've alwayw like tmobile but this one leaves a very sour taste in my mouth
To think how many people are being hit with this and not realizing it.

Voicemail works that way, too.

Sending a text message to somebody's phone by email is very different
(free to send via computer, free to receive by receiver, at least via
ecallplus/AT&amp;T), but I would hesitate to do it because the receiver
might be driving at the time and might think the message was important
enough to read at 75 mph on the freeway.

I think that is disgusting-- and it is NOT ignorant on the woman's part--
there should be a no brainer way to have the text setting turned off or
ignored...in all cell phone services!

It is deceiving in an obvious way...no one can control how many text
messages ones gets and should be able to accept them them voluntarily...what
if someone wants to purposely screw with you and leave 100 text messages an
hour?? T-Mobile will allow it and charge you.... even if you choose NOT to
...that is insane....and making it purposely hard to filter the text
messages is pure deceit....

One more reason not to have a cell phone touch a kids hands-- too damn
luring in too many ways.... I cannot wait until my sprint contract
expires...

&gt; Morris woman fights big cell bill

&gt; Text-messaging feature running up wild charges

&gt; By Rob Seman, Daily Record

&gt; VICTORY GARDENS -- Avis Byfield owes T-Mobile more than $2,000 because
&gt; a text messaging function on two cell phones she bought continued to
&gt; run after she had turned the phones off and put them away.

&gt; The company is standing behind its billing and Byfield has hired a
&gt; lawyer to straighten out the mess, which now has gone to a collection
&gt; agency and threatens her credit -- and patience.

&gt; At one point when she called to complain, she was told: &quot;Your bill is
&gt; going up as we speak.&quot;

&gt; Byfield doesn't claim to be technology-savvy.

&gt; So when she decided to buy her teenage daughters cell phones to keep
&gt; in touch with her, Byfield chose T-Mobile, drawn in by the its
&gt; television commercials featuring actress Catherine Zeta Jones.

&gt; She was only looking for a way to communicate with her daughters, she
&gt; said. She didn't know much about text messaging, let alone that such a
&gt; feature was included on the phones she purchased.

&gt; She found out when her daughters ran up an extra $20 for using the
&gt; text-messaging feature. She took the phones away, turned them off, and
&gt; figured that would be the last she heard of text-messaging charges.

&gt; Wrong.

&gt; In October, Byfield received a 742-page document in the mail. It was
&gt; her new cell-phone bill. A month later, she received another, 454
&gt; pages. Combined, they called for her to pay more than $2,000, most of
&gt; which is the result of continued text-messaging fees.

&gt;&quot;I didn't know what to do,&quot; Byfield said. &quot;I was besides myself.&quot;

&gt; So far in the battle, T-Mobile has credited Byfield $200 as a
&gt; courtesy, and another $400 for terminating her account, bringing her
&gt; bill to $2,023.

&gt; But Byfield, who is unemployed and has gone back to college full-time,
&gt; said she does not have the money to pay the bill and is infuriated.

&gt;&quot;I just think it's plain simple abuse,&quot; Byfield said.

&gt; She hired Rockaway attorney Morris Leo Greb to plead her case to the
&gt; company. Greb said that he believes the fees could have been the
&gt; result of a glitch, but said his first priority is to get Byfield's
&gt; account out of the collection agency's hands before her credit is
&gt; ruined.

&gt; On Dec. 28, Greb received a reply from T-Mobile, saying the phones'
&gt; identifying numbers and signal verified the messages, and said that
&gt; Byfield was aware of the charges associated with the service.

&gt;&quot;It's very easy, especially when kids are involved, it's very easy for
&gt; text messages to accrue,&quot; said T-Mobile spokesman Kyle Warnick in a
&gt; Thursday interview.

&gt; Warnick said that subscribers who have text messaging must log off the
&gt; service to avoid further incoming messages. A subscriber's account is
&gt; charged every time the service updates the user's &quot;buddy list,&quot; which
&gt; occurs when other friends who use AOL Instant Messaging log on and
&gt; off.

&gt;&quot;Just turning the phone off does not log the user off,&quot; Warnick said.

&gt; Byfield said she might not have been aware that the text-messaging
&gt; service was still running even though she turned the phones off.

&gt;&quot;Maybe, but after I called them . shouldn't something be done?&quot;
&gt; Byfield asked.

&gt; Byfield said she called T-Mobile after receiving the first giant bill
&gt; and was instructed to input a code into the phones in order to log off
&gt; the service.

&gt; When the code did not work, she called the company again, and said she
&gt; was told that the code is sometimes unreliable. She said she was also
&gt; told &quot;your bill is going up as we speak.&quot;

&gt; Byfield said that she was told by the T-Mobile representative that
&gt; nothing could be done to help her. Warnick did not have an immediate
&gt; response to that allegation.

&gt; When she received the second huge bill, she wondered why the company,
&gt; now aware that there was a problem, hadn't intervened to stop the
&gt; fees, or simply contacted her to inquire about them, like a credit
&gt; card company.

&gt;&quot;Even after I called them and said 'Do something about it,' I get
&gt; stuck with another huge bill,&quot; Byfield said.

&gt; Byfield said she wants to make others aware that hidden dangers can
&gt; exist in buying cell phones.

&gt;&quot;I think they're misleading the public, and I think they're using the
&gt; commercials to mislead the people,&quot; Byfield said. &quot;They should tell
&gt; the people of all the dangers that can happen.&quot;

&gt; Byfield's phones were being charged 5 cents per text message every few
&gt; minutes, according to the massive bills, of which only a few pages and
&gt; few dollars were dedicated to voice calls made on the phones. Some of
&gt; the messages included &quot;bulletins&quot; by America Online, which provides
&gt; T-Mobile's text-messaging feature.

&gt;&quot;I don't know how I got bills,&quot; Byfield said. &quot;(The phones) weren't
&gt; being used.&quot;

"/> It seems to me that the amount of text messages this woman received in
order to accrue such an expensive cell phone bill over a relatively
short amount of time is akin to mail bombing in the email world. A 742
page bill in Oct. and a 454 page bill in Nov.? There's got to be more
to it than ignorance on the part of the woman...esp. at 5 cents per
message. Yikes!

I don't use text messaging and am unfamiliar with it. Does the bill NOT
show where the message originates? It appears that after the initial
$20. her daughter used, the rest of the messages were received, not
sent. Is there no way to track those?

up to such a huge amount. Does TMobile have so many non-commercial
accounts with those kind of totals that it's their &quot;norm&quot; and they
don't alert the customer? A few months ago I purchased a computer
(under $700.) online with my credit card. The credit card company was
on the phone to me in no time flat. They even confirmed 3-99 cent
iTunes purchases while they were at it!!! And, I was nowhere near my
credit limit! I was extremely appreciative of their attention to my
account. I would certainly hope that AT&amp;T/Cingular would do the same
thing should my cell bill unexpectedly skyrocket.

To my way of thinking (and I'm not terribly techie!), TMobile has lotsa
'splainin' to do! That, or there's more to the story that hasn't been
told!

As the case suggests.

Bob's claim (which you appear to be supporting) is that once the message is
placed in the inbox the service is provided.

It logically follows (using Bob's definition of a provided service) that
should the inbox be lost or destroyed the recipient is obligated to pay since,
in your joined opinion, the service was provided as soon as the message was
placed there.

The fact that the message never made it to the recipients phone seems to not
trouble you a bit.

:&gt;&gt; In my opinion, until the end user receives the message the service is
:&gt;not
:&gt;&gt; provided.

:&gt;Your opinion is wrong. Read your contract.

Ain't in MY contract.

"/> Actually that is pretty much how it has to work. For example we use text
messaging in our business to receive messages from various equipment

never guaranteed that the phone will be in contact with the system. So
say I am on a subway, in a bad coverage area, change my battery or
whatever the phone system will queue any messages that were sent to my
phone and when it sees my phone reregister itself it will send the
message(s).

I don't see any (nor would I want any) logic that the phone system can

my phone.

In the case of this thread and use of aim the user decided to associate
their phone to a high traffic external system that is not controlled by
the phone carrier. When the phone was turned off the system queued the

"/> My mother-in-law, who has a cell phone and uses it maybe once a
month (on a $40 a month plan, don't get me started) had a couple
of incoming text messages on her cell phone when I looked at it
recently (she has Verizon, which charges for incoming text
messages, as most carriers do). I told her about it (she of
course had not noticed it), and she got all concerned about who
is calling her number and she is going to call Verizon and tell
them to stop, and she's not paying, etc. I finally had to tell
her not to bother with it. I figured if she is wasting $40+taxes
a month on the phone, another dime wasn't going to make any
difference. I definitely agree that there should be a way to
disable incoming text messages, at least those that cost money
to receive (I believe you can get Verizon to send you a text
message with account info and that's free, so you would not want
to disable the feature entirely, but I suspect many people would
be happy doing without them altogether to avoid fees.

I get free incoming text messages with my AT&amp;T TDMA phone. Not
sure if they do this with GSM, I assume not.

Just wanted to add an update....
I got on tmobile's web and checked out the current usage for messaging
and found there was still some showing up on my DW's phone even after
supposedly turning on the filter to disable. What I was getting was
messages from what they called 500 series messages as opposed to 4690
ones that are from aim updates. These were things like horoscopes,
stock alerts, and the likes. I have no clue how these features were
ever turned on but I called tmobile again and had them turned off.

You can be certain I will be checking my current usage from time to
time for the next few days.

what IS DEAD wrong about this text messaging crap is the difficulty for some
to understand what it can turn into-- and I am sure the dimwits at the
cellphone stores are never going to explain this properly to the customer...
even if you are savvy...this company is soo damn deceptive and sneaky it is
not funny -- if you have no children and do not use text messaging
well...ok-- but this whole business of them text messaging who is on who
gets off ..and unwanted ads...that is plain awful.... trying to get this

&gt; Morris woman fights big cell bill

&gt; Text-messaging feature running up wild charges

&gt; By Rob Seman, Daily Record

&gt; VICTORY GARDENS -- Avis Byfield owes T-Mobile more than $2,000 because
&gt; a text messaging function on two cell phones she bought continued to
&gt; run after she had turned the phones off and put them away.

&gt; The company is standing behind its billing and Byfield has hired a
&gt; lawyer to straighten out the mess, which now has gone to a collection
&gt; agency and threatens her credit -- and patience.

&gt; At one point when she called to complain, she was told: &quot;Your bill is
&gt; going up as we speak.&quot;

&gt; Byfield doesn't claim to be technology-savvy.

&gt; So when she decided to buy her teenage daughters cell phones to keep
&gt; in touch with her, Byfield chose T-Mobile, drawn in by the its
&gt; television commercials featuring actress Catherine Zeta Jones.

&gt; She was only looking for a way to communicate with her daughters, she
&gt; said. She didn't know much about text messaging, let alone that such a
&gt; feature was included on the phones she purchased.

&gt; She found out when her daughters ran up an extra $20 for using the
&gt; text-messaging feature. She took the phones away, turned them off, and
&gt; figured that would be the last she heard of text-messaging charges.

&gt; Wrong.

&gt; In October, Byfield received a 742-page document in the mail. It was
&gt; her new cell-phone bill. A month later, she received another, 454
&gt; pages. Combined, they called for her to pay more than $2,000, most of
&gt; which is the result of continued text-messaging fees.

&gt;&quot;I didn't know what to do,&quot; Byfield said. &quot;I was besides myself.&quot;

&gt; So far in the battle, T-Mobile has credited Byfield $200 as a
&gt; courtesy, and another $400 for terminating her account, bringing her
&gt; bill to $2,023.

&gt; But Byfield, who is unemployed and has gone back to college full-time,
&gt; said she does not have the money to pay the bill and is infuriated.

&gt;&quot;I just think it's plain simple abuse,&quot; Byfield said.

&gt; She hired Rockaway attorney Morris Leo Greb to plead her case to the
&gt; company. Greb said that he believes the fees could have been the
&gt; result of a glitch, but said his first priority is to get Byfield's
&gt; account out of the collection agency's hands before her credit is
&gt; ruined.

&gt; On Dec. 28, Greb received a reply from T-Mobile, saying the phones'
&gt; identifying numbers and signal verified the messages, and said that
&gt; Byfield was aware of the charges associated with the service.

&gt;&quot;It's very easy, especially when kids are involved, it's very easy for
&gt; text messages to accrue,&quot; said T-Mobile spokesman Kyle Warnick in a
&gt; Thursday interview.

&gt; Warnick said that subscribers who have text messaging must log off the
&gt; service to avoid further incoming messages. A subscriber's account is
&gt; charged every time the service updates the user's &quot;buddy list,&quot; which
&gt; occurs when other friends who use AOL Instant Messaging log on and
&gt; off.

&gt;&quot;Just turning the phone off does not log the user off,&quot; Warnick said.

&gt; Byfield said she might not have been aware that the text-messaging
&gt; service was still running even though she turned the phones off.

&gt;&quot;Maybe, but after I called them . shouldn't something be done?&quot;
&gt; Byfield asked.

&gt; Byfield said she called T-Mobile after receiving the first giant bill
&gt; and was instructed to input a code into the phones in order to log off
&gt; the service.

&gt; When the code did not work, she called the company again, and said she
&gt; was told that the code is sometimes unreliable. She said she was also
&gt; told &quot;your bill is going up as we speak.&quot;

&gt; Byfield said that she was told by the T-Mobile representative that
&gt; nothing could be done to help her. Warnick did not have an immediate
&gt; response to that allegation.

&gt; When she received the second huge bill, she wondered why the company,
&gt; now aware that there was a problem, hadn't intervened to stop the
&gt; fees, or simply contacted her to inquire about them, like a credit
&gt; card company.

&gt;&quot;Even after I called them and said 'Do something about it,' I get
&gt; stuck with another huge bill,&quot; Byfield said.

&gt; Byfield said she wants to make others aware that hidden dangers can
&gt; exist in buying cell phones.

&gt;&quot;I think they're misleading the public, and I think they're using the
&gt; commercials to mislead the people,&quot; Byfield said. &quot;They should tell
&gt; the people of all the dangers that can happen.&quot;

&gt; Byfield's phones were being charged 5 cents per text message every few
&gt; minutes, according to the massive bills, of which only a few pages and
&gt; few dollars were dedicated to voice calls made on the phones. Some of
&gt; the messages included &quot;bulletins&quot; by America Online, which provides
&gt; T-Mobile's text-messaging feature.

&gt;&quot;I don't know how I got bills,&quot; Byfield said. &quot;(The phones) weren't
&gt; being used.&quot;

I see no need for text messaging. When i call someone it is a lit
easier when they do not answer to leave a voice message of a few seconds
than to punch in some text.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't use text messaging and am unfamiliar with it. Does the bill

&gt;&gt;&gt; As noted, most of the charge was for &quot;updates&quot; of the AOL Instant
&gt;&gt;&gt; Messenger list. It keeps track of who is online, and notifies the
&gt;&gt;&gt; user when specific individuals are online. Every time someone logged
&gt;&gt;&gt; on or off, a message was sent to the account (which was then charged
&gt;&gt;&gt; $.05), even though the phone was turned off and not being used.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How much more deceptive can you get? Anyone with an ounce of
&gt;&gt;&gt; intelligence would expect the account to log off when the phone's
&gt;&gt;&gt; power is off.

&gt;&gt; Thanks for the explanation. I just can't wrap my head around the # of
&gt;&gt;&quot;messages&quot;/log on, log offs it took at 5 cents a pop to drive the bill
&gt;&gt; up to such a huge amount.

&gt;It would require a text message every 8 1/2 minutes, 24 hours a day for 2
&gt;months to generate that size bill.

"/> And, if you have a moderately sized &quot;Buddy List&quot; with a dozen or so
people logging on or off every few minutes, it could take far less
time. Remember, AIM users online via computers are not logged in
continually.

&gt;&gt; I think that is disgusting-- and it is NOT ignorant on the woman's part--
&gt;&gt; there should be a no brainer way to have the text setting turned off or

&gt;My mother-in-law, who has a cell phone and uses it maybe once a
&gt;month (on a $40 a month plan, don't get me started) had a couple
&gt;of incoming text messages on her cell phone when I looked at it
&gt;recently (she has Verizon, which charges for incoming text
&gt;messages, as most carriers do). I told her about it (she of
&gt;course had not noticed it), and she got all concerned about who
&gt;is calling her number and she is going to call Verizon and tell
&gt;them to stop, and she's not paying, etc. I finally had to tell
&gt;her not to bother with it. I figured if she is wasting $40+taxes
&gt;a month on the phone, another dime wasn't going to make any
&gt;difference. I definitely agree that there should be a way to
&gt;disable incoming text messages, at least those that cost money
&gt;to receive (I believe you can get Verizon to send you a text
&gt;message with account info and that's free, so you would not want
&gt;to disable the feature entirely, but I suspect many people would
&gt;be happy doing without them altogether to avoid fees.

&gt;I get free incoming text messages with my AT&amp;T TDMA phone. Not
&gt;sure if they do this with GSM, I assume not.

I don't think the article mentioned whether the kids had computer access

If I want to chat online (which is very rare) I use IRC, so I don't mess

Well, I'm either going to eat my previous words or show my ignorance of
technology in general and text messaging in particular! Probably both!
Contrary to a previous post I made in this thread, my cell phone does
have text messaging and I use it!!! I've never sent a message; don't
even know how and I don't know anything about buddy lists. However I
have set up cell phone notification via my pobox.com email account. I'm
notified via text messaging when pre-selected clients or family members
send me an email. Since I use an online fax service, I also receive
cell phone notification when a fax comes in. This notification service
is incredibly handy when I'm not near a computer as it allows me to
respond to the sender immediately via a phone call. Lucky for me,
incoming text messages are free!

Those handy-dandy incoming notification messages are great but I can't
imagine spending time &quot;typing&quot; messages via the phone's keypad! Maybe
it's just an age related issue but I'd rather call the person or, if
near my computer, email the person using a standard keyboard. Possibly
I just need a newer cell phone with a better key pad! Or maybe I just
need more time to learn all these newfangled, technological services!

Aloha...Sue
