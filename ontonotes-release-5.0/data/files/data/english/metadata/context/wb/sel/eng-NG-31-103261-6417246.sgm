---

i am going to give a go at further describing the concept of zoning
using a practical everyday example. it is a complex scenario which
will be evaluated, it deals directly with issues of religion and the
state, and being complex, it is also paradoxical and requires
balanced consideration of all the issues from many angles.

in other words, what is about to be described exists as a fuzzy
condition, as part of existence today, and it could even be said,
'worldwide' or globally, as it then is mediated in various ways via
local perspectives.

this is one of the most difficult questions i have dealt with,
regarding the electromagnetic infrastructure, as it has been proposed
an artifact of 'culture' and in that, designed and informative, as to
this em culture. it is thus a great question how the existing
symbolism arose within this infrastructure, and for what intent.

i have written about this subject before, several times, and will
only minimally engage what this is referring to, in specific terms.
it could be said to be 'western enlightenment' as a project that
imbues infrastructure, as it extends through the machinery of state,
from Roman times, into today, and along with it the symbols of both
the state in its profane and sacred dimensions. else, it could be
said that there are aspects of the use of capital punishment and
crucifixion as an etched-in memory for the large populations that
this grid of power, energy, and technology overlays. and so too, with
it, the Christian symbolism which takes this cross and subverts it
against the state, as a form of liberation through sacrifice, etc.

[note: previous study has shown the link between this symbolism of
cross and 'light' with that of the snake, via the cobra-head
streetlight, a worldwide icon of modernist infrastructure, and of
'shared' cultural order. thus, the streetlight, electrical pole
(cross) combination then enter into further relations to various
religious if not esoteric aspects of 'religion' and the state, as
manifest through the power system. further, it can then be evaluated
in terms of enlightenment ideology, how the powerplant itself
(generator) could be seen as analogous to the 'godhead' (ref. Virgin
and Dynamo), and how of this all fits together quite nicely indeed.]

the point of writing the following is to seek to demonstrate that in
this ambiguous and complex situation, it is possible that there are
'many dimensions' simultaneously at work, in a given encounter. and
the intent here is to seek to clarify what the actual issues are,
that are involved in this realm of infrastructure, as it is related
to via people, citizens. and in this way, to go from today's mixing
of public and private in a single confluence of relation,
undifferentiated -- to a more clear understanding of what is 'public'
and what is 'private' about this cultural infrastructure -- not with
the intent to take away any 'truth' that may exist in such a
configuration, and instead to clarify what this infrastructure is and
is not, at its base, in the state, so as to do away with whatever
bias, distortion, and warping this infrastructure may extend as an
ideology.

it may all sound very abstract and ungrounded. so here is an example,
from photographer Walker Evans... it is of a row of wooden
distribution poles as they recede back into what appears to be a
giant machine...

a few things to note. the background is like a giant machine,
potentially symbolic of 'powerplants' in that there are smokestacks
which under imaginary conditions could supply 'power' to these
electrical poles, and thus to the houses they supply with
electricity. so, this is going to be assumed part of the symbolism
involved, (e.g. as if referencing Pink Floyd's The Wall, as a
reference for the symbolism of this image). the other dynamic to make
note of are the 'crossarms' on the wooden electrical poles. these
poles come in various configurations, sometimes a single crossarm,
sometimes multiple (as above) and sometimes there are only poles with
electrical wires. as this photo is from 1936 it can be assumed that
this is electric power and telephone (lowest lines), yet let's
imagine that this is 'today' in 2007 -- and that it could also have
the internet via telephone lines, and cable television (which would
be strung similarly to the telephone). so, in other words, this
picture can be assumed to be 'seeing cyberspace' in the sense that
there is the speed of light transmission of data (telephone, internet-
computing) alongside the delivery of power in these lines.

and that this is occurring in a context of infrastructure which also
operates in 'symbolic' dimensions, which people may or may not relate
to, consciously or subconsciously. so, the ordinary street (in the
west) may have some wooden poles, many of which may have this cross
symbolism associated with it (e.g. parti).

another aspect to note is that this is considered 'neutral' or
'normal' in that it exists as the state of affairs. as if this
situation 'just is', in itself, as if an act of nature, if not divine
providence even. people are not going around 'questioning the
symbolism of the infrastructure', it seems. it is mundane, accepted,
status quo.

[note: doing so, one may be reminded of Kurt Douglas's role in
Spartacus (1960), and the associated imagery of the character being
executed via crucifixion, on a scene resembling these everyday
'cross' poles of the infrastructure. the context then, and now, is
once again that of the machinery of state and the individual, as they
relate, reconcile and rebel via issues of governance.]

in any case, the main point is not to cause any additional problems
with this situation as it already exists, and instead to try to
examine this 'knot' and untie it, so that it can function most
effectively with regard to issues of shared cultural value, in an
enlightened state served by its infrastructural machinery...

the idea then is to consider this issue of 'zoning' with regard to
this everyday landscape as people relate to it (mindscape). all this
can be brought back into the terminology of dimensions, shared
dimensions, shared relations, and so on. and what is claimed here is
that this image, this banal everyday image, is itself one of 'bias,
distortion, and warping' as to a neutral perception of what exists,
as it exists, via a subtle yet also all-pervasive presence of
subliminal meaning, within this context of infrastructure, which then
gives the state the aegis of 'religion' and the mantel of Christian
ideology, while at the same time subverting the religion itself
because of this very same agenda.

in other words, there is a giant worldwide global infrastructure
which carries with it the symbolism of the 'Roman state' as an
automated machinery of development, if not that of Christiandom,
within infrastructure as it is designed via modernism, yet at the
same time this subverts whatever values may be 'believed' to exist in
such a system, as they are mediated in terms of this machinery as it
then overpowers humanity.

still sounding very abstract. so let's see what can be done about
clarifying the basic idea. here is an altered image: (crosses)...
essentially it is to say that a person can relate to this embedded
'cross' in the infrastructure, in symbolic terms, via pattern
matching -- and that this is not irrelevant yet may function only
subconsciously, as to the effects it has on a person or given
people... that is, if everyone grows up with giant wooden crosses on
the their street, as part of the infrastructure, that this has some
effect...

and what this is to then convey is that this is in essence a
'private' aspect or realm, created with this same infrastructure, via
this symbolism - which may then reference the cultural story (of the
west, for example, as it relates infrastructure to the Roman grid,
the columnar poles to the classical orders, and so on).

in other words, if someone looks up and sees 'crosses' in the context
of 'western civilization' - this means something. and its meaning
could range from the secular (capital punishment / execution by the
state) to the parochial -- yet, more likely 'both-and'... some of
each, intermixed as 'more public' and 'more private' dimensions may
overlap in various circuits of relation. i.e. consciously or not --
people are relating to these crosses, however disguised, in the
infrastructure. yet, what exactly do they mean? why are they t/here?

it is proposed that their very existence (being) may thus begin to
bound or limit 'infrastructure' to a certain paradigm - say of
western civilization. such that, in a Muslim or non-western country
this may become a question, what is with the giant wooden cross on my
street? and so on. it may be tied to aesthetics, to the origins of
the structures in wooden boats and their masts, as this is a tensile
system similar to that used in sailing with rigging, etc. yet this
symbolism is not itself irrelevant. it must be mediated,
rationalized, in some way, and in a worldwide panopticon in which
such infrastructure design is associated with 'modernity' itself.

once again, this is complex, and fuzzy. and interesting. intriguing
as a question, as it has diverse meaning. to some it may be seen as
conquest, to others, the state as religion, to others still, as the
Christian state as it is manifest in machinery, and others still,
seeing this automated machinery slaughtering on autopilot, with these
crosses as a proxy. what is this interface. is it 'western', what are
its limits, boundaries, forms? why does it exist this way. what does
it mean? what are the issues involved in such a cultural scenario?

it is beyond the scope of this writing to get into this in detail,
including the legitimate grievances which are based in more
specificity as to this condition -- yet it is proposed this can be
engaged, within a shared POV and that a stable infrastructure can be
modeled and developed which can clarify what infrastructure is, what
its roles are in the state, and what dynamics of culture may be
extended in publicly and privately, and why 'zoning', thus, 'makes
sense' of what now is of a convoluted nature, unable to mediate its
self.

a sweeping generalization would be to say that, in general, the
wooden crosses are of a private aesthetic, when in a context of the
western democracies where the cultural system is mediated within the
state using 'christian' terms (i.e. Christian nation-state, etc).
yet, in other nations it may have more of a flavor of the Roman
infrastructure and aspects of capital punishment, as its predominant
interface with various citizens, yet in doing so, have an aesthetic
'other' than what may originate in a given place and inform a people
as to their own unique existence and belonging. in other words, this
'grid' provides a common global context via this symbolic
infrastructure, and it just so happens it is in a western paradigm,
via aesthetic symbolism. potentially. seemingly. likely. probably.
and how is this mediated?

when a McDonald's shows up in town, or a Starbucks coffee store, it
is plugging into this infrastructural 'grid'. that is what the grid
is all about, electromagnetism (power/energy) and information. yet
the context it is plugging into is one of a 'universality' of this
cross-arm pole as symbolic of a common world ordering...

and what it is claimed here is that this is based in a type of
ideological pseudo-neutrality, which sees in this cross structure,
'nature' itself. as if it simply exists, outside particular
influences, as it is an equal condition for 'all people' versus a
western worldview (reality, inc). these ideas can go thousands of
years in depth, as to what is going on, and across a vast array of
issues and disciplines, as to what is involved in such a situation,
as it is mediated (war, 'globalism', culture, art, identity,
economics, trade, and so on).

yet the most basic point here is that, for some people (not all, it
is assumed) these 'crosses' are of a private realm, and have implicit
meaning to a particular context (or 'side') of what may be a split
condition (in relation to 'world order' say). some people may see or
relate to coquest and crusaders, in the cross... yet is it simply the
'Christian state' or may it be more complex, a machinery of state
extending over many thousands of years, from Roman times if not
before (Megamachine of Lewis Mumford), which has thus effectively
lined the planet with this 'infrastructural order', crucifixes which
may have the context of both capital punishment and Christianity
within this framework -- yet more fundamentally, an architectural
order which is based in the geometrical defining of space and time,
place itself, into a common organization... and via this system,
order, and control, the 'grid' thus largely today covers the planet
and all capitals, in this way, in which the many governments function
as 'one', albeit with the problems of binary reality (inc) that still
stand in the way, to getting beyond paradox, as to how to govern as
humans over this machine.

and in such a context, it would then seem that part of what may be
involved in this scenario is identifying the aspects or dimensions of
this infrastructure which are 'added' or 'beyond' the fundamental
ordering... and which may be imbued with a 'foreign' view or
understanding which is not native, nor 'grounded' nor to possibly
serve the aesthetic needs of a population as to enlarge shared
relations, as to co-existence, etc.

thus, issues of church/mosque/temple and state may arise in this
context of infrastructure. what if 'crosses' are then implying a
certain assumption whereby the state=church, via the all encompassing
infrastructure? it would place the state in the role of 'god', no
less. this is why public and private zoning are all important. this
ambiguous situation creates a superposition of all potential
positions, simultaneously acting at once.

to seek clarification, then, it would be to consider the same
photograph again, this time altered so as to show only 'poles'
without any crosses... and in the same context of this machinery (in
the background)...

this is proposed to be a more generic or general view, in which
specific 'christian' and 'roman' symbolism are recontextualized, and
this then could be a more primal architectural (aesthetic/
infrastructural) relation between the poles and the machinery of
state. this is about as basic as it gets for the power grid, with the
use of powerlines. and such a scenery of poles can be found in
Africa, Asia, North and South America, and elsewhere. it is indeed a
'universal' aesthetic, a shared and common order of human relation,
in an electromagnetic civilization. i.e. in the context of industrial
machinery of modernism as a shared culture.

so, this 'blank' image is going to be used as a reference, about what
the actual 'machinery of state' is, that is functioning underneath
this 'cross symbolism' -- crosses or no crosses -- this is what is
grinding away. the power system, and people serving this power
system, which it seems oftentimes is only serving itself. that is,
out of control, running amok, ideologically detached from what is
going on outside of this machine.

this is still more complex than described. this 'utility' could be
run by the state, or it could be of private ownership, and-or acting
on behalf of the public. so this is still not simply a 'public
realm', this viewpoint. it is only 'more public' than having the
crosses in this same image, which is proposed as 'more private'. and
that there are dimensions involved in evaluating these dynamics. how
people relate to environments. etc.

in any case, this is the basic question which will be explored
somewhat further to try to seek to provide an example of why this
'cross' symbolism is distorting the underlying dynamics of this
machinery of state. and when politicians get on television and
present themselves as 'Christians' they are doing so within a context
of this infrastructure -- in which this symbolism has been
'converted' into an aesthetics of state machinery. that is, when a
politician is referencing a 'christian nation' that this is then
referencing also this subliminal realm of cross-symbolism as it has
been incorporated into the infrastructure - within which every street
can be seen to have these crosses occupying its 'place' (space-time)
in this given "christian" framework -- yet how much of this is only
'virtual' (information circuits) and how much of this machinery is
actually grounded in 'Christian' values, shared by people as the
state is governed, as communities relate, and so on?

it is proposed instead that this 'christian' symbolism can become
subverted, a camouflage or screen which then can be 'believed' to
have the state functioning as a 'christian' organization, yet that
this is only in the context of this 'superficial' symbolism -- in
which the symbolism becomes hollowed of its actual meaning, or
diluted through ideological appropriation. for instance, whereas the
'cross' may have certain religious symbolism within a community of
those practicing and sharing this philosophy of beliefs and
knowledge, to repeat this cross outside of the context of 'believers'
may only be copying another 'the cross' as an idea, and creating a
ubiquity of crosses which lose their spiritual charge, as to this
symbolism, as it relates to grounded beliefs, faith, and so on. in
other words, these crosses may be all over the place, yet there may
be few who 'believe' in this cross, as a private belief as to how
things work and function in the cosmos.

it is this issue of the public-private mixture of the state and
religion that is at issue. it is necessitated this way, due to
constituting the state in private terms. that is likely how such
ideas evolve as universals, or so it seems very likely that one time
there may have been a shared belief or faith, in some complex sense
-- yet as it functions it can begin functioning against this very
sense, in its inversion. again, not trying to get too abstract -- yet
what if these 'crosses' are delivering 'anti-Christian' valuation,
within these wires/lines? what then does the cross symbolize? is it a
carrier of its own demise. say with pornography, what if there is a
sea of crosses and wires connecting the internet within this grid, to
masses of people who then are relating in these ways, within this
ideologically 'religious' context? if believed to be 'sacred', that
is. what does this do to the cross symbolism itself, as a sacred
object for those who may believe in such a view?

the great thing about boundaries is that they can also protect
things, ideas, people. the private boundary of rights in the state
can guarantee a person their beliefs, religion, spiritual values --
and protect this from being infringed by another. to place this
'belief' into the public context of the state as it operates as and
in machinery, then necessitates grounding this belief in the profane,
as it may mediate affairs of necessity. if instead there were a
'public metaphysics' of shared being, this value system would be
capable of existing in a public realm which could define a shared
realm, beyond any one religion, as to this co-existence-- as to legal
rights, etc. yet at the same time, it would enable a moral grounding,
in a way that private religious views can begin to distort against
other private religious views, the higher in the state, the more
extreme.

this is to propose it is possible to have 'moral' dimensions in the
infrastructure, in a shared public realm, yet without specific
'religious' values of a particular monotheistic view, that may be
relativistic and distort a shared condition to only certain terms.
in dealing with machinery, it is proposed that a grounded morality of
metaphysics (em-info) can operate within a public realm, in a way
that religion today cannot, which can best function in a private
realm, to retain its 'sacred' dimensions as part of the state which
it is a part of. (note: this is very complex, it is to suggest that
there are more effective roles for religious organizations in the
state, rather than trying to equate each with the other, because the
issues of governance then lead to problems as the above -- where the
overlap becomes the problem - moral clarity is confused if not lost.]

this may sound way out. too far out of any normal consideration to
make sense. yet to me it is of highest importance to begin to relate
to how everyday existence is today 'privatized' in a distorted
environment, which is complexly both 'ideologically christian' and
also, 'inhumanely machinic' in its daily operation. and this is the
state people exist in, try to steer/govern, and relate their self to,
with, and through, via being in it.  part of it. what is this thing?
is it really assumed to be some enlightened higher-order nature of
reality? or may it instead be part of a beastly dynamic of a global
civilization, in which people are pawns for various sides and states
of existence, which then are mediated in ideological terms until
there is conquest, and a winner? and what if there are no more
winners, in that there is a paradox - there is not a binary reality,
it is instead actually a 'unified' reality, a singular being
(monotheism) to which we as humans belong... then what? what if
accepting this context is itself part of the problem -- in that it is
a basic distortion, a bias that then has repercussions worldwide,
that global wars are fought over, even if it is not about 'religion'
itself and instead about the machinery underneath it, which then
functions as and effectively becomes 'god'?

what if this is happening and the shared values, the 'morality'
beneath this symbolism is vanished into the ideology of relativism,
of nothingness -- and there is no there there -- in terms of this
greater being, nor of this greater existence, in this state? said
Christian, Muslim, Jewish, etc. and what if this is happening in the
guise of religion, these wars, this exploitation, yet it is actually
for an ancient machinery of automated state development - extended
once through classical architecture and now, electromagnetic
infrastructure? what side are you on, in the daily functioning of
this event -- the human or the machine? what if it is this machinery
which is 'winning' and only 'sense' will reclaim the shared values,
'shared being' (i.e. spirit) that may be believed held between
people, privately, yet publicly via facts, truth, and logic of
metaphysics -- that this is part of the human birthright -- what if
the governance of state has made this impossible, that is,
unreasonable, in the status quo working of this machinery - however
it may be believed and-or perceived-- that, as it functions -- it is
not engaged in this grounding of ideas with actual physical
existence, and let to run its course -- what if like the macroscale
civilization, each human is also running their self as a machine and
detached from a greater accounting -- and it is because of this
confusion, in 'states' (i.e. in individual and group governance) that
this sharing of value, relation, existence, being, is then mediated
within only a limited context, a private framework 'inherited' from
the past, which distorts, biases, and warps the basic situation to
only a certain ideological view -- which ultimately detaches itself
from 'reality' altogether and exists instead as opinion and belief
separated from grounding in shared truth -- free-floating, anything
goes, relativistic views which never match or line up, beyond the
confines of binary ideologues, as the state is then privately managed
and manipulated, to ill effect, in this dysfunctional ecological
circuitry.

at what point is this 'christian infrastructure' actually outsourcing
shared values for an ideological worldview based on a faulty premise,
that the power of the belief is in the symbol itself and not in the
people who are to generate and sustain this belief, through action?
at what point does this 'cross' short-circuit any actual sacrifice,
for that of the ideological sacrifice, taking away the responsibility
of people to uphold values, as they are enshrined in the
infrastructure instead? and what if this is a false-reality, a false-
impression of the nature of the machinery at work, or its subversion
and co-opting in order to pursue political-economics?

this will be gone in to in further detail, to try to seek to describe
the process by which the crosses on these streets can then replace
the actual 'sacred' values, with those of a machinery of state,
instead. and leave the question of belief to that of 'belief in a
machine' over that of belief in 'one being', including the self, as
it relates to this being, grounding the individual and the larger
cultural enterprise. it is once again said that it is of this
question of zoning that then enables a 'public zone' to mediate this
shared being, via metaphysics which can be shared in this state, and
guide this machinery via human laws grounded in physical nature, as
to moral direction, and that in the issues of psychological identity
(private man) and patriarchy that the problem that exists, which
undermines this shared being, is the limits of private religion as to
'one being'.

this is one of two major issues. better understanding the public and
private realm of zoning, and the other is to go beyond the binary
reality, in a shared panoptic condition, so that the shared truth is
the basis for co-existence, and the bias, distortion, and warping is
removed from these relations, in such a process. the next few posts
will go further into this symbolism as it relates to zoning, seeking
to engage this situation, and the next series will seek to resolve
the binary conundrum, as to how diametrically opposed views may find
a way to bridge difference, and co-exist, if what is 'true' remains,
and what is not, is then left behind.
