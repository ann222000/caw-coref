Hi, I'm new here, and I'd just like to hear some schools of thought on
a few questions. Is there a god (AKA Supreme Being)? And if so, is it
in your best interest to follow an organized religion? I am personally
lost on whether or not theres a supreme being. I sometimes feel that
there has to be a God, and yet I also realize that humans have an
need/desire within them to lay all at the feet of a being more powerful
than them, upon which all responsibility can rest, a desire for an
all-powerful father figure, and this knowledge leads me to question
myself. Am I feeling truth, or am I feeling a deception caused by my
sub-conscious mind in response to a deep seated human desire? I think
organized religion is a joke. Most of the major religions are in
reality a type of business, and half of the ones that truly want to
help you are so &quot;out there&quot; that you don't feel comfortable. The ones
that are truly helpful and comfortable are rare. Which leads me to
finding faith in yourself, or &quot;Self-Discovery&quot; religion. I may be
wrong, but I'm guessing this developed in America. Enough said about
that. Feel free to respond in whatever way you see fit.

I think reliqion has more to it then you distribe. In believe men finds
confort and peace. Good and Bad is in all of us, we are all influenced
by our surroundings, education, parents, art and litarature that makes
us do good and bad things. On the other hand, who or what defined good
or bad. Our western ideas are based on christianity and thus, these
goods and bads are based on a religion. Saying we dont need a basic
religion is something we dont know, we have not been in that possision.

At the end would a world with one religion, love and peace perfect?
Yes, i think it will. The road the that world is to 'Bad' to consider.

I think allot of really intelligent people started having faith not
because of believe but because of that conclusion.

Hello and welcome Mike,

Heh good question. Personaly to belive or not in a God is a personal
choice that only you can make. I do believe and I share your views on
organised religion.

It is good that you mention 'Self Discovery' although I would say that
a faith that is entirly made up of an amalgamation of differing parts
is not worth much, I totaly agree that discovering God for oneself is
ideal.

Myself I chose my 'organised religion' based on my persenal
understanding of what God is and what Gods plan is.

What I say about this is my faith may not be the right one, but it is
the right one for me.

Cheers,

Lee.

Hello Lee,

May i ask how is it you find God or 'your God'. Is it that you find
anwsers or confort, does he/she/it help you in difficult times or is it
just a feeling that guides you. How does one discover 'he's/he'r God'?

Are the criteria, findings, moments, feelings?

Hi,

I'm new here too. I have been laying low the last couple days just
trying to follow the various trains of thought in this group. I have a
lot of the same questions as you - actually, I started out in your
shoes. I have felt how frustrating it is to find a definitive source
about God - Spirituality - to guide or just enrich your life. My most
reliable comfort so far has been, as you suggested, to look within
yourself. I know that's not a particularly popular method (believe me,
I live in a small farming community!) but it just seems to feel more
'dependable' to me. I read a great deal about spirituality also, and I
take from those books the philosophies that ring true for me. I have
come to think, at this point in my spiritual journey, that there IS a
higher, gently guiding Intelligence, and we are - as ants are to the
universe, or cells are to the body - a conscious part of that. Its
hard to say that without thinking, &quot;that's all we are?&quot; but I believe
the greatness comes in the ability to try to reach beyond our human
limitations and consciously connect with that Higher Intelligence, to
whatever level we can achieve. As for Organized Religion - I do have
my own Faith. And I think its important. Its like having a home to
visit and reconnect with like-minded people. Its a way, I think, of
grounding that Understanding of &quot;Higher Intelligence&quot; in our everyday
world. I think the problem arises, obviously, when one organization
says &quot;My way is right - and the only way&quot;.

Oh, and I'm sorry about the double posting. My computer touchpad has a
hair trigger.

(Pottsie)

Hey, Snefsky!

I can ditto Lee's comments. (Maybe he's not such a heathen after all!)

I can add my personal perspective to it.

All my life I was told &quot;You have to have a personal relationship with God.&quot; So I went out and tried to develop that relationship. The first thing I had to do was just what you are doing.....I had to get a definition of God. How in the world could I have a relationship with something if I didn't even know what he/she/it was?

The seacn brought me down. And in bringing me down, I found some meaning.

The search brought me down....because God cannot be defined. How can limits (definition) be placed on The Infinite?

(Snefsky)

And if so, is it in your best interest to follow an organized religion?

(Pottsie)

MOST organized religions will spoon feed you a belief system, and tell you if you follow their path you will be saved (whatever that means). I found, by walking my own path, that I never was in need of salvation.......and what's more, I see that as a paradox the REAL teachings of the major religions is exactly that! You are exactly who and where and what you are supposed to be right NOW. There is no where to get to. But, if you don't believe that, you'd better start walking! =)

(Snefsky)

I am personally lost on whether or not theres a supreme being. I sometimes feel that
there has to be a God, and yet I also realize that humans have an need/desire within them to lay all at the feet of a being more powerful than them, upon which all responsibility can rest, a desire for an all-powerful father figure, and this knowledge leads me to question myself.

(Pottsie)

Good! You are well on your way!

(Snefsky)

Am I feeling truth, or am I feeling a deception caused by my
sub-conscious mind in response to a deep seated human desire?

(Pottsie)

Maybe it's both.

(Snefsky)

I think organized religion is a joke. Most of the major religions are in
reality a type of business, and half of the ones that truly want to
help you are so &quot;out there&quot; that you don't feel comfortable. The ones
that are truly helpful and comfortable are rare.

(Pottsie)

But, it's not about &quot;Them&quot;, is it?

(Snefsky)

Which leads me to finding faith in yourself, or &quot;Self-Discovery&quot; religion. I may be
wrong, but I'm guessing this developed in America. Enough said about
that. Feel free to respond in whatever way you see fit.

(Pottsie)

You might look into Science of Mind. Or any of the Esoteric branches of the major religions. Zen.....Buddhism Sufiism......Islam Kabballah........Judaism A number of disciplines within Hinduism. Studying any of the Christian Mystics will give some insight also. Merton and Meister Eckhardt

Hello J,

Heh now that is possibly one of the hardest questions to answer without
writting an essay, but I shall try.

Within my faith(I'm a Sikh) there is a saying, it goes: 'If you take
one step towards God, God will take 1000 steps towards you'

Couple that with this from our holy scripture The Guru Granth Sahib:

'sach milai sach oopjai sach meh saach samaa-ay.
Meeting the True One, Truth wells up. The truthful are absorbed into
the True Lord.

surat hovai pat oogvai gurbachnee bha-o khaa-ay.
Intuitive understanding is obtained and one is welcomed with honor,
through the Guru's Word, filled with the Fear of God.'

What you get then is an understanding that to find God you just have to
start looking. The more you look, and the more effort that you spend
looking, the greater increase does God give you in the form of
'intuitive understanding'

Are you asking what my faith in God gives me?
If you are then the answer is very simple, I don't worry overmuch about
anything.

The criteria for knowing if you have found God? Heh well I couldn't
vouch for you but for meself, you know when you just know something is
right?

Like when I disagree with Kierkecraig about human free will, and an all
knowing God.(if you caught that thread) I don't know why I'm right,
and I guess I could argue all night about it, and even if Kiekecraig
makes a very persasive argument.

I know I'm right, I can feel it deep down, and anyhow it makes sense to
you. That is one of my criteria, if it just deep down makes sense.

Cheers,

Lee.

how is it that you come to the conclusion that we 'are as ants to the
universe'.

That's not to suggest its an insignificant thing. I have great respect
for everything in the world of matter. Ants - rocks - you name it.
Are we any better than they are? I don't know. My 'religion' says
humans were made in God's image. I have to conclude that there is
something about our species that desires to know its source, to return
there. As Lee suggested, from written religious history, personal
testimonials through time and from my own experience, God does seem to
reach for us also. Does this mean ants are lacking this? Perhaps the
other creations in our universe don't require that to stay 'one' with
God at any given moment. Maybe they already are, consciously (on
whatever level) that is. Maybe that's the thing that makes us differ.
The desire to &quot;search&quot;. If I were to point out one significant
example, I think, of how we may be different from the ants........I
might liken it to an artist. I believe God is the Creator - the Artist
- A Source that uses all the whimsey, beauty and practicality (He)
wishes to bestow on His Art. (Some would argue that &quot;Life&quot; is just a
natural progression of creations - that just cuts it too dry for me)
With the ant, a piece of art is created, yet the ant is fairly limited
in his own creativity in this world within his instincts. Yet I still
believe the ant is consciously connected to God on some level. With
us, God created a work of Art that can - in turn - create his or her
own works of art ...with all the whimsey, beauty and practicality we
strive for. And not just on a material (paint on paper) level. I
believe with our own consciousness we create our everyday realities to
the extent that they co-exist with other's realities. However, I speak
only in pondering.

Religion in and of itself is a joke, when that is all a person is a
part of. I grew up in a Christian family and was taken to Church
regularly, but by the time I was in High School I had come to the same
conlusion that you have made and I was asking the same questions. That
is because I had never participated in anything other than what seemed
to be a traditional ritual. I essentially became an agnostic, rather
than an atheist (An Agnostic is not sure there is a God and an Atheist
is confident that he/she knows there is no God).

You can summarize the major religions of the world in this way: All
the religions of the world center on what man does to reach God or
become a god. They center on man's actions, imagination, and nature.

What I have come to discover is that Christianity is not a religion,
because it is based upon what God did through Jesus Christ to reach
mankind because we could not reach or be like Him. It is evidently a
relationship that God wants us to have with Him and not a religion,
because that is what He worked so hard to establish. This relationship
with Him does manifest itself in the lives of believers as they gather
together with others who have that relationship to learn about and
worship Him together. That is what you see in Churches that are
Biblically-based, but never simply a religion.

As for the question: &quot;Is there a supreme being?&quot; Well, regardless of
where you stand intellectually or spiritually, you must ask the
question if there is anything that cannot be explained except for God's
intervention. No evolutionist has ever been able to explain where the
elements came from that became the building blocks of life. Nor has
anyone been able to explain how so many lives have been totally changed
like mine by simply, but completely, believing in the resurrected Jesus
Christ of the New Testament.

Hello everyone,
I'm new here as well - been through a few postings and after this
posting its not likely I get the time to post before my Yr12 exams are
over (3rd of June) - but anyway - just a hi to everyone, brief intro:
I'm 17, m, living in Western Australia - Sikh by religion - and I was
invited here by Lee (thanks for the invitation).
As lynore asked about organised religions without a written text -
there are certain tribal faith systems that I suppose we could call
organised religion in which religious teaching is passed down by
'shamans' or head priests etc - however these are really minority
faith systems (not that being minority makes it less valid though)
that I came across when I did my own study into world religions.
The way I have come to understand it is the reason for written texts
is so that the words of the Prophets / Gurus / the Great men who had
reached that level of spiritual understanding and were 'one' with all
again (my understanding of God is that 'God is' - there is probably no
better way in lanuage, being limited as it is to describe innumerable
concepts, so 'God is' - an analogy could be to understand God (I
refrain using him/her and 'it' sounds too lame and disrespectful) as
an underlying concious say, hmm, energy (this sorta throws one off the
concept but for the sake of the analogy it works) - that composes all
that is and beyond - like a continum so to say) - however without
straying off the topic of written texts too much, the reason for
written texts is so nobody can merely go ahed and alter or use any
religion (at least that was the idea) and use it as a 'power tool' -
however (I apologise if I offend but I only state what I have come to
realise - and I am not anti-Christian, I am more so anti-fanaticism in
any faith and I vehemently oppose the apparently 'modern' and
inherently flawed education system) - from history we know that
Christianity itself is today far from what it started off as - from my
readings and research into other faiths (Christianity in this case) -
I noticed that much of Jesus' original concepts of faith, and God, are
really different to the common perception of God and 'Reality' today
in Christianity - for example - the common personification of God as
an old man (Zeus?) - the controversy (and finding of the 'Gospel of
Mary' - however Christian festivals (like the much debated Christmas)
and the way Easter is celebrated etc - are essentially pagan and were
not introduced into Christianity until missionaries started going on a
(quite literally) 'conversion spree' across Europe and the famous
Constantine who converted to christianity (many would say that it was
due to the fact he knew it was the best way to gain power and expand
his empire) - but integrated paganism in it to make it more
'acceptable' to the pagans. The concept of satan as well - the horns,
pointed tail and trident - all symbols of original pagan gods to make
Christianity seem more 'valid' than pagan beliefs, that 'image' of
satan was introduced. So Christianity has been moulded and re-shaped
throughout the ages - I may not go as far to make a statement as a
good agnostic friend of mine said a while ago 'Christianity has been
moulded and has become a religion for convenience and control' but I
would say that it has been used for the purpose of power (Anglicanism
coming about because King Henry wanted to divorce his wife - again, an
example of a denomination of a religion forming for the purpose of
power).
The importance of written texts is unquestionable - if Jesus himself
had written a single text, and hand-chosen a few others to include of
prophets like Moses, etc and said 'This is the bible and no changes /
alterations are to be made, and these are the teachings of this faith'
- perhaps then the numerous scribes who re-wrote the bible hundreds of
years after the passing of Christ would not have been able to change
it as much.
In Sikhism as well (the religion Lee and myself follow) - our Gurus
wrote the Sri Guru Granth Sahib (SGGS) which is the Sikh religious
text composed and compiled by the Gurus with writings of some saints
which the Gurus themselves added into the scripture - it stands
unaltered and shall remain so due to the fact that the 10th Guru, Guru
Gobind SinghJi himself said before his passing that 'All sikhs are to
regard this 'Granth' (compendium/book) as your Guru hereon' - so the
original teachings and philosophy of Sikhi was preserved (however,
most scriptures not just the SGGS, but the hindu vedas and shastras,
the Quran as well (I probably wouldn't say entirely but
predominantly), and other religious texts are written in poetry. I
suppose the reason is that when it comes to values, beliefs and God,
there is a degree of resilience required and self-analysis as well
when it comes to this because if one were to merely say ' you shall
not lie ' - then in certain circumstances one does need to lie
justifiably if, say, someone was going to be murdered and the
intentional killer asked you where the person was hiding, anyone who
does not know the reasons for both sides acting in this manner would
not just go ahed and reveal the location before knowing what is going
on so it would be just to lie and say 'I don't know' - be that a lie,
its for a good reason and I wouldn't say one should be condemned for
saying so - and this need for resilience does come out in Sikh
philosophy, but it is cautious as to not provide a justification for
sin, and it certainly leaves no room for it. So thats just how, from
my perspective, the reason I spoke more about Sikhi is because I am
myself a Sikh - I hope that clarifies however the importance of
written scripture - because in a faith where religious teaching is not
based on some base precepts and principles that are established and
written, that faith can be moulded and used however by the carriers of
the faith who would predominantly be the high-priests and it would be
all to easy to misuse the power that would come with it.
Well, back to homework for me, will keep my eye on future postings and
shall post again when the days begin to have 25 hours again ;o...
Regards,
--
Manraj 'RENATH' Singh Bhullar
P.S. I'd like to ask though, what do you all think of inter-faith
relationships, like a guy of one faith marrying someone of another (of
course on the consent of both sides)? and - When it comes to the
matter of 'truth' - what would you say in terms of 'self discovery'
and 'faith', how would one come to be able to say 'this is true' and
'that is false'? - just some food for thought, a few philosophically
inclined friends of mine have been having discussions on the same
topic of late - would like to see what you all would say. - Thanks :)

Hello Renath,
I enjoyed reading your post. I believe you're absolutely right about
the corruption of a Faith without some concrete foundation to preserve
its purpose, such as written texts. Even with them, as you pointed out
- corruption happens. The lifespan of a good but otherwise small
belief might also be forgotten or overshadowed without these texts. And
I like the idea of the poetry. I think that if a person is spoon-fed a
religion, it doesn't leave much room for Spiritual growth, and may
cause a faith-based identity crisis, perhaps later on in life. You
asked of faith-based mixed marriages. I am in one of 21 yrs. A lot
of what I have come to believe myself has been gleaned from that &quot;which
is true&quot; question you mentioned. Especially when you have children.
And they start asking questions. As a parent, I don't believe its
right to sit on a fence in matters of Spirituality. For the record, we
both - my husband and I still practice our own religions, though
perhaps scaled back. I could count the number of arguments we have
had over the years on this on one hand, however, we have had some
incredible family discussions!

Hello,

In the last posts you write that without a written text, the concrete
foundation to preserve the purpose of the believe will not hold. But it
is not the purpose that is written in the texts. E.g. the purpose of
faith is to find confort, joy in life and happyness. The purpose of
faith shouldn't be a set of rules with corresponding concequences.
Because then, The purpose of the Faith will be uphold the purpose of
that Faith.

But you must ask yourself. After you have found the purpose of faith,
you do not need to faith. Why? Because you are aware of the fact that
the text-based-foundation of the faith is made up by people that are
aware of the purpose of faith. And thereby those who don't understand
the purpose of the faith, but do live by the religeon live a happy
life.

Since when has Faith become some vague feeling? The purpose of faith
is not &quot;to find comfort, joy in life, and happiness.&quot; Faith has one
purpose: to trust your life to something or someone that you cannot
see by sight. Some would call that a blind faith and they would be
right if such faith was focused upon something or someone not proven to
be reliable and accurate.

I have met people that have &quot;blind faith&quot; that leaves them empty and
searching still, but I have placed my Faith (trusted my life) in
someone reliable, God. I found Him reliable because of the amazing
accuracy and reliability of the Bible. When I began to trust what the
Bible said about Jesus Christ and to attempt living the principles that
He espoused, I found that my faith in Him was only a small part of the
real strength that He has given me. Blind Faith ends in religion and
nothing more. Real Faith ends in a relationship with the One True God,
Jesus Christ.

Now the first thing you will attack me with is the so-called
&quot;inaccuracy of the Bible,&quot; but I challenge you to actually try to find
those errors yourself and not go on what others have said about it.
The Bible confirms itself in amazing ways especially in the prophecies
concerning Jesus that were fulfilled although written hundreds of years
before (Psalm 22, Isaiah 53, etc...).

Then for you, the cause of your faith is &quot;confort, joy and happyness&quot;.
The purpose is trusted your life to God.

For me, the purpose of faith is &quot;confort, joy and happyness&quot;. But that
is because i believe the bible was made up by people who share my
vision. And realized that in the end, people would enjoy confort, joy
and happyness if they would truly believe in the bible.

'Lo Free-N-JC,

I've read your other posts with interest and appreciate your thoughts. I'm Christian, though not fundamentalist, and respect your views. (Particularly your post on Original Sin)

However, I disagree with the statements above regarding &quot;Blind Faith&quot;.

Most people feel that &quot;faith&quot; is like a religious novice looking down into the abyss in terror while being told to jump by his Guru, preacher or mentor. The guru, preacher, or mentor asks the apprentice to jump and have &quot;faith&quot; that God will catch them. And, as proof, they trot out the Bible or some other scripture, read it to the novice, and tell him once more to jump.

The novice, having faith in the Guru, Preacher, or Mentor and the proof that was read to him, jumps. God catches him, and the novice believes. Praise God. All is well!

REAL Faith is looking into the abyss, not seeing God, and jumping anyway! God still catches the jumper. Praise God. All is well.

The difference is.....the first jumper will give thanks to his Guru, Preacher, Mentor and the Scriptures.

The second will give ALL the Glory to God!

There is a Buddhist saying which can be paraphrased for faith in scripture..........&quot;The Bible is a finger pointing at the moon.....it is not the moon!&quot;

Namaste

Mornin', Lee! &lt;grin&gt;

Thanks. I'm not too familiar with Sikhism, and am glad to know (From Renath's Post) that there are some Sikhs on the list. I've been told in conversations that some of my views have a tinge of Sikhism in them, so I'm looking forward to expanding my understanding.

Renath's post sure shows a deep insight. Sheeeese, wish I had been that insightful at 17!!!!!!!

is not the purpose that is written in the texts.

J,
I read back over my post. Maybe instead of purpose, I should have used
the word 'Ideals'; maybe 'instructions' or 'advice'. I don't believe
that to experience Faith's comfort, joy and happiness you necessarily
need texts. Abraham and Moses developed their faith without them. For
some people, they may be the tool to 'open the door', or maybe a
tangible connection to the basis of their religion, but I think Faith -
and God - can be discovered and felt personally in many different ways.
Wasn't it Budda who discovered God's Infinite Wisdom sitting under a
tree?
I don't wish to offend anyone, please forgive me if I do - I am still
learning myself.

Hi Lynore,

Thanks for you anwsers. We are here to learn and discuss so thats what
we do :)!
As a a non-believer i tend to have a problem defining God. Because of
that i can't believe that without any outside interaction one can find
god or faith. In my opinion it is the fiction of the mind that creates
a name for that that is unexplained. Its a good thing, dont get me
wrong. I have just not seen 'the light' yet.

Hey Wuvbear,

Now I don't mean to come over all 'convert the heathen'-ish here

Some would say that to find God one has to look within. So it's a safe
bet in my book that you will never get that 'I've seen the light'
feeling waiting for external influense.

It is a mistake, I suspect, to simply look to religious documents and
&quot;faith&quot; for the answer to the existence or non-existence of a supreme being
(and the truth of the rules he/she/it would have you live by). It's rather
more interesting to look to the implicit moral psychology of the source--the
source being the individuals who wrote the original texts or the people who
preach it.

The truth is ugly indeed and it lies within our own sub-conscious
(something, sadly, we as individuals have only fleeting privilege to
access). The truth is the driving force of all natural phenomena and the
dynamic to which all other causal powers can be reduced, and Nietzsche
perhaps described it best as: &quot;The will to power.&quot;

Hi Ian,
In an essay about the conundrum of Christian Intellectualism, I wrote
the following:

&quot;By its biblical definition, faith is anti-logic; holding beliefs
without any rational evidence. It is the sublimation of the
intellectual self, to deny sensory evidence to the contrary that there
is an external force, intelligent, benevolent, and omnipotent. It is
the trusting surrender of personal desire to the perceived will of an
exalted being who desires for us to be as perfectly transcendant as
he/she/it.&quot;

Full essay here:  http://dubiousprofundity.com/article.php/20050516223933202

I brought this up because of your point that it is a mistake to look
simply to religious documents and faith. I think to have a true belief
in a supreme being absolutely requires to simply look at those
sources; a rational approach to the existence of something inherently
not measurable by known science will only result in one possible
outcome. Quoting Nietzche, I assume you're a rationalist of sorts,
perhaps an atheist, and so familiar with that route (forgive my
assumption if wrong). While not taking a position on the Universal
Truth of any beliefset pertaining to spirituality, I do think that if
one feels called to a spiritual path of some sort, or just believes in
some sort of supreme being, that individual truth is what is found
within one's self. Inherently, rational analysis is the enemy of
faith, and faith is the cornerstone of metaphysical belief.

Reviewing my comments, I guess I am more existentialist than rationalist... :)

Hi Chris,

You make an excellent point in that quote. Intellectualism is, if I'm
honest, wholly incompatible with faith. This is one of the reasons why I
ceased believing, firstly, in the teachings of Joseph Smith (I was LDS), and
then the Bible.

I suppose by suggesting that people consider a hermeneutic thesis or a
psychoanalysis of moral psychology or the genealogy of morality itself, they
would obtain enlightenment about the history and so the source of the things
they &quot;feel&quot; compelled to believe. People feel the need/want to believe, but
they rarely bother to investigate the pyshcology of Why; seemingly feeling
that some vague/intangible explanation is sufficient. &quot;It's the Holy Spirit
talking to me&quot; or similar muddying of the waters to make things look deeper
than they really are is the order of the day here.

I'm not an atheist, but I do distrust every major religion I have come into
contact with.

I fully recognize, and commiserate with a distrust of every major
religion I have ever encountered, but recognize that it is because of
two things: the fact that organizations are self preserving by nature,
and thus act in their own best interests, and the fact that said
organizations are comprised of people, who are inherently flawed.

My question for you, Ian, is understanding that there is a vast
difference between spirituality and religion, do you think there is a
place for spirituality, or do you consider it a vestigial human
psychological response to fear of the unknown?

&gt;&gt;&gt; (something, sadly, we as individuals have only fleeting privilege to
&gt;&gt;&gt; access). The truth is the driving force of all natural phenomena and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; dynamic to which all other causal powers can be reduced, and Nietzsche
&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps described it best as: &quot;The will to power.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm new here, and I'd just like to hear some schools of thought on

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in your best interest to follow an organized religion? I am
&gt; personally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lost on whether or not theres a supreme being. I sometimes feel that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there has to be a God, and yet I also realize that humans have an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; need/desire within them to lay all at the feet of a being more
&gt; powerful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than them, upon which all responsibility can rest, a desire for an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all-powerful father figure, and this knowledge leads me to question
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; myself. Am I feeling truth, or am I feeling a deception caused by my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sub-conscious mind in response to a deep seated human desire? I think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; organized religion is a joke. Most of the major religions are in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reality a type of business, and half of the ones that truly want to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; help you are so &quot;out there&quot; that you don't feel comfortable. The ones
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that are truly helpful and comfortable are rare. Which leads me to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; finding faith in yourself, or &quot;Self-Discovery&quot; religion. I may be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrong, but I'm guessing this developed in America. Enough said about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that. Feel free to respond in whatever way you see fit.

Heh do my eyes see correctly?

Chris said:

&lt;&lt;By its biblical definition, faith is anti-logic; holding beliefs
without any rational evidence. It is the sublimation of the
intellectual self, to deny sensory evidence to the contrary that there
is an external force, intelligent, benevolent, and omnipotent. It is
the trusting surrender of personal desire to the perceived will of an
exalted being who desires for us to be as perfectly transcendant as
he/she/it.&gt;&gt;

What though if all of your sensory evidance suggests the opposite,
that indeed it would be foolish to belive that a higher power does not
exist? What constitutes rational evidance?

And then Ian said:

&lt;&lt; Intellectualism is, if I'm honest, wholly incompatible with faith.&gt;&gt;

What, how, does not compute?

When we talk about religious faith, we call it faith because we cannot
prove the existance of God. That is fair point, and I can see how
statments like the one Ian made come about. While we cannot prove the
existance of God, we also can not disprove Gods existance.

What does logic suggest is the correct course of action here?

If you choose to believe on the avaliable evidance, then you are acting
no less intelectualy, then if you choose not to believe.

Why do I say this.

Easy, consider that nothing can be proved one way or another, nothing.
We can look, listen, taste, and in all other ways percive our
surroundings, but can we truley say that what we percive is the truth
of things?

Ohhh now don't get me wrong, of course I belive that the Earth revolves
around the Sun, and that in fact both the Earth and Sun do exist. It's
just that I cannot be totaly 100% sure of that, nor can I be of
anything.

So the question of faith vs intellect is really a moot point, because
all intellect is still faith based.

Cheers,

Lee.

In the scientific realm, one is never asked to prove a negative; it is
irrelevant. I would not ask you to prove that there are no flying pink
elephants in the universe. However, when you make a statement of faith,
you are espousing a positive belief: &quot;There is a God&quot;. When I say
&quot;Prove it to me&quot;, you cannot supply rational, scientific evidence of
any sort that there is a God. And, if God is what has been described,
then you would not ever be able to provide evidence of that, because
the description is outside anything science can quantify. Rational
evidence to suggest there is no god is as follows: I cannot see him. I
cannot hear him. I cannot measure him in any scientific way.
Additionally, I have the sum total of historical and empirical data to
show that no one has ever been able to scientifically prove the
existence of God, in experiments of every form. If a hypothesis is
unsupportable with measurable evidence, then the hypothesis has no
scientific merit. Faith is not intellect based. Faith is &quot;the substance
of things hoped for, the evidence of things unseen...&quot;. A Christian's
simple faith in Christ's plan of salvation is no more intellectual than
my simple faith in the Glorious Flying Pink Elephant who will carry me
to Nirvana when I die.

I am not stabbing at anyone's faith here; I believe that faith can be
very powerful, and is a valid part of many well adjusted people's
lives. It is, however, clearly delineated from rational thought and
intellectualism.

No Chris given what you have said here then I'll concede that faith is
not science. If though you belive that faith and rational though do
not fit together then what does this say about the whole field of
theology? Is it, in your mind not an intellectual persuit?

As to rational proof of Gods existance, I can see that all around me
every day. Yes I may not be able to prove to you, but to my self it
has been proven to my satisfaction a multitude of times.

When I first joined this forum, I contributed a post entitled 'What
really gets my goat' and this is just the subject.

Chris I understand that perhaps you don't mean to be insulting, but
when I am told that my faith has not been thought about, or that
because I am a man of faith then I am flawed in my thinking, or that my
well thought out faith is not thought out at all then, I guess you can
understand my attitude.

As what people call a theist one of my biggest problems lies in the
typicaly atheistic view that you have stated.

Faith is very much a process of the intellect, to say other wise is not
only wrong, but dismisive of a whole way of thought.

Cheers,

Lee.

Lee,
first, let me make it clear that I am not in any way attempting to
demean Christians. I have the utmost respect for your faith, and
whenever I post on this issue, I take great care to make sure that
there is no sense of judgement or emotion connected to it; it is merely
observation and analysis. Keep in mind I am not an atheist, I'm
agnostic at best. That being said...

My father has a four year theology degree from ECBC. I don't think
there is anything invalid about it, however, it is one of the very few
'ologies' which is not a science. When I say that it is a failing
proposition to be a Christian Intellectual, I suppose I should clearly
define intellectual. I don't mean someone who uses their intellect, I
mean a rationalist, which is why I spent so much time in the post
illustrating how God and Christian doctrine do not stand up to rational
analysis. This does not imply that Christians are stupid; rather it
says that faith based positions do not hold up in the arena of rational
thought. They are, by their very nature, irrational. That's ok, Pi is
irrational too... ;). This observation does not invalidate faith or the
Christian belief, it's just one contest where Christians are better
served to not allow themselves to be baited in. The Christians who
scream and holler on the atheist boards, trying to make a point they
can never make to an audience that finds them amusing are the same ones
who fight established science because it does not match their cobbled
together viewpoints. The best example of this is creationism.

I don't know how many times someone has sneered &quot;evolution is JUST A
THEORY&quot;...and then go on to tell me how God made a man out of mud and
animated him with a breath. Now that belief is fine, but we need to
make sure that we keep religion and science seperate (see the other
thread on Religion V Science for the point on how the Muslim nations
stagnated). I can accept the concept of intelligent design, I see
inherent patterns from the microcosm to the macrocosm that tell me that
at the very least, our Universe is order based, and not chaos based.
Yet creationists, instead of looking at the scientific findings that
have lead to the theory of evolution, throw that out and insist that it
happened in seven literal terran days, and god put his finger on the
earth. Instead of interpreting their beliefs through the facts
available, they look for anomalous data they can use to attack
established scientific viewpoints, to espouse a faith based position
which lacks any real evidence, and they call it science. This is not
only detrimental to the progression of our understanding of the
universe, it is misleading, and morally wrong. Creationists would be
better served to remember that the texts they are basing their LITERAL
interpretation of were written by people who didn't know what
electricity was. No matter how God inspired it is, the language and
vocabulary of these people was highly limited in comparison to today. I
see no problem in believing that God created the heaven and the earth,
and recognizing evolution as the process by which his will manifested
itself on earth. Perhaps God told Moses that it took him seven
days...what is a day to an Omnipotent, Omniscient, and Omnipresent
being who spans all of time? Perhaps a God day is equal to a human era.

There are exceptions to everything, and I am sure that there are some
Christian Intellectuals who are quite secure in their faith, and also
make rational, reasonable arguments for the existence of God that don't
hinge on &quot;proving&quot; God does or doesn't exist, and who have found the
balance between literal interpretation of biblical idealogies and
analysis of all available scientific datum...they are just the extreme
minority. 99 times out of 100 when I have watched one of those debates
occur, as all scientific backing for the position is stripped away, the
Christian falls back to &quot;Because I believe it&quot; and &quot;Because the Bible
says so&quot;. Both are valid spiritual or theological viewpoints, but
neither is a valid scientific or intellectual stance.

I hope this provides some clarification to my position. I have a large
number of Christians around me in my friends and family, including my
Father (and no, I don't hate him or anything...he's who I bounce alot
of these questions off, because I respect his education and viewpoint).
Faith is an admirable, even enviable quality to have...but it requires
the ability to deny the analytical voice in your head which attempts to
dissect the doctrine, its texts, and the people who purport to have it.

Hey, Chris - ever seen &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;? If not, you might like it.
(Just wait - I'm going to keep adding to the movie list :-) )
While I agree blindly following a faith might not best serve man's
evolution.........okay - it won't - people need to think for
themselves; I don't believe we would have made the major steps in
scientific evolution in the first place had not someone just &quot;wondered&quot;
about something that had yet to be proven. That 'gut feeling' or
'driving curiosity', that might have no measurable significance was the
spark that discovered continents, etc. Could this not be the same
inner voice that compels one to search for or believe in God - or the
&quot;Source&quot;? Because this drive-voice-intuition has yet to be
recorded-measured-proven, does that make it any less valid? And why,
pray tell, Christopher Walken? Got that Dead Zone kind of thing going
on?

Actually, it was Gabriel from 'The Prophecy' that did it. :) And
because he has a certain sense of wisdom/insanity that I find
appealing.

I do think that those two thing are related...humans, as a generality,
are inherently spiritual beings, seeking a sense of something greater.

I haven't seen that movie, but I'll add it to the list... ;) Have you
seen 'Waking Dream'? That's a good one for physics and metaphysics.

And speaking of the source, have you read Michener's 'The Source'?

Hey Chris,

Heh okay please let me first say sorry for the rant, obviously it is a
pet hate of mine that you have touched upon.

Secondly, I know you are not an Atheist, you just used an Atheist line
of reasoning I have heard a lot.

Thirdly I am not now, have never been and doubt I shall ever be a
Christian.

Chris I understand why you say what you say, and your reasons. My
objection is on the grounds that I also understand that faith(certianly
mine, and I'm not so big headed to think I'm any differant) is not just
a belief in the unproven, but is reached by a process of intelligent
well thought out logical, and yes intuitive steps and thought
processes.

Personley my belief in God is something that I question everyday, yet
still come to the same conclusion. My faith is there because logicaly
I can see no other answers to the questions that I have. For me the
'grand unifing theory of everything' is God.
Just one more quickee for you, I have stated that I have no common
grounds with a Christian belief, this means of course that to call into
question biblical or Christian truths or belifes has no effect on me at
all. Of course the universe was not created in 7 days, I don't really
know many Christians that actualy read the Bible that litraly.

Cheers,

Lee.

"/> You're right, it was created in 6 days. :P

I know plenty who believe the Book of Genesis in very literal terms.
And why not, eh?

Personally, I think it's no more or less believable than anything else
in the Bible. If you believe that part is literal, then why not
believe in the existence of the many-headed sea monster Leviathan or
the horsemen of the apocalypse?

Actually, I am being facetious; I'm perfectly aware of the use of
symbolic realism and reductionism in some of the more poetic parts of
the Bible. I even gave a lesson on the subject back when I was a good
LDS boy. It went down like a lead balloon.

Once again - &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;. You need to see it. Keep
questioning. It's creative - which puts you on the' hot' list. Let go
of what you've heard - make your own decision.
