&quot;Can Germany Be Saved?&quot;

While Germany has seen an economic upswing in the last two years a lot
of the proposed reforms have been toned down. Longtime readers of this
blog will be familiar with Germany's demographic outlook but there a
number of issues including social, labour, business, and market reform
that still need to be resolved. One of the most prominent critics in
Germany is Prof. Hans Werner Sinn, also president of the German
Economic IFO institute. Back in 2004 Sinn wrote a book giving an
historic overview of how Germany's wirtschaftwunder came to be and how
Germany came into the positon it is now in, &quot;Ist Deutschland noch zu
retten?&quot; Which, to the dismay of others, took a hard and critical look
at Germany's economic problems and what solutions are possible. As
they say: &quot;die wahrheit tut weh&quot;.

Prof. Sinn has now published an updated english edition available from
MIT Press: &quot;Can Germany Be Saved?-The Malaise of the World's First
Welfare State&quot;. This book is meant for Germany but a lot of the
lessons apply to other countries as well. Germany will be the first
country to face these challenges but not the last.

What has happened to the German economic miracle? Rebuilding from the
rubble and ruin of two world wars, Germany in the second half of the
twentieth century recaptured its economic strength. High-quality
German-made products ranging from precision tools to automobiles again
conquered world markets, and the country experienced stratospheric
growth and virtually full employment. Germany (or West Germany, until
1989) returned to its position as the economic powerhouse of Europe
and became the world's third-largest economy after the United States
and Japan. But in recent years growth has slowed, unemployment has
soared, and the economic unification of eastern and western Germany
has been mishandled. Europe's largest economy is now outperformed by
many of its European neighbors in per capita terms. In Can Germany Be
Saved?, Hans-Werner Sinn, one of Germany's leading economists, takes a
frank look at his country's economic problems and proposes welfare-
and tax-reform measures aimed at returning Germany to its former vigor
and vitality.

Gee, and all the time I thought that what happened was that the Berlin
Wall came down and West Germany, and economic dynamo, merged with East
Germany, a thoroughly depressed, sick, polluted and confused Communist
State. The result was an economically unbalanced country whose
aggregated economic power was now diminished by the profound problems
dragged into it from the East.  Despite the shock of the
reunification, Germany hasn't done that badly. It will eventually
recover, and will eventually become the most economically powerful
state in Europe.

Perhaps.

But China is going to run into one huge mess in the next decade, as
the 'one child per family' generation begins to support the retiring
numerous-children-per-family generation.

Huge problems lie therein.  And they will only be compounded by the
requirements necessary to field a superpower-caliber military.

The abject stupidity inherent in this closed ended horseshit bean counting
mindset is mind blowing.  Technological innovation, artificial
intelligence, and economies of scale will absolutely dwarf any sort of
&quot;demographic problem&quot;.  There ain't gonna be enough &quot;jobs&quot; to go round as
it is.  Meanwhile we have nut cases that think the correct solution is to
have more babies, thus increasing the overall population and straining the
limited natural resources all the more. Abject, stone cold, stupidity and
throwback mentality.  Must be a Republican.

China's problem, and the problem for all of us is going to be how to live
decent lives without destroying the planet.

When I was taking a Western Civilization course, we were talking about past,
present, and future super powers.  One of the subjects was; if there was to
be another super power after the United States and former Soviet Union, who
would it be.  Without a doubt, most all agreed China.

The United States will not always be a super power, in fact the United
States is past the peak in our status as world super power.
We are seeing a shift in power, and it's not likely to change any time too
soon.  China is on its way to becoming the next world super power.  A nation
only need three strong areas in order to be a super power, those being:
Military power, Technology, and Trade.  As we know, China is fast growing on
all three.

If you look at world history, no nation remained a super power for a long
time, except maybe the Roman Empire.

What bothers me with China right now is their increasing military power and
their industry.  We are in a time of concern over global warming, caused by
man and by natural causes.  We know, that industry is a primary enemy to
emissions that aid in accelerating global warming.  China has no problems
doing as we did decades ago with no environmental protection controls in
place.  They are using fossil fuels faster than can be produced.

I have no doubt they would rule with a super iron fist, as we have seen them
demonstrate before.

China's trade is heavily dependent on Western consumerism. It would take
a very long time for them to create internal demand that rivals the
West. And doing so will only create more wealth disparity, a source of
unrest. Their primary imports are raw materials. They are a resource
poor country, hence my comment about imperialism. They have already
started their dig in Africa.

We would also have to assume a status quo in world growth. As the price
of oil escalates, production is beginning to decline. Demand destruction
is beginning to have its way.

If Romania had not joined the axis it would have surely been invaded
early on for their oil.

Things are not much different today. China desperately wants strategic
reserves.

Why don't you learn to do some research and leave the big discussions with

Don't you have some insults or something to trade back and forth with Tom,

And seriously, if you're going to talk about schools learn to puntuate and

Now buzz off, I'm looking for intelligent conversation.

&gt; China Boosts Military Spending

&gt; China announced Sunday that it will increase military spending at a sharply
&gt; higher rate this year, budgeting a rise of nearly 18 percent, and a senior
&gt; U.S. official immediately called for clarity on the planned expenditures.

so an 18% increase after a 20-year hiatus following a 60% cut worries
you?

no wonder your school is rated 4th tier.

would you like to know the increase in the usa military budgets since
1989, coward osprey, you illiterate buffoon.

You are a fool.

China faces a very real problem.  And given their population,
continued population growth is clearly not a solution.  The solution
is learning to live with what they have emerging: a comparatively
small generation which must support a comparatively large generation
that is going to live much longer (and thus need support for much
longer) than any previous Chinese generation.

Your assumption that I am a Republican is not only incorrect, it is a
stupid assumption.
Your assumption that I support the Chinese &quot;having more babies&quot; is not
only incorrect, it is a stupid assumption.

The Chinese have problems to which there are solutions, and those
solutions don't include your nebulous &quot;Oh, there will be
'technological innovations' &quot;.  They do include foregoing the massive
armaments buildup required to attained superpower status.

You have problems yourself: making stupid assumptions.  The solution?
Stop making stupid assumptions.  Not only will you be wrong less

I don't think China has that great a problem.  It is true they will
have a larger population of old people, but the Chinese need
not encourage or even allow the healthy ones to retire.  Old
people use up less resources than young people, so many of
them will be able to support themselves even with part-time
work.  The main unusual expense with the aged are the heroic
medical measures applied to wring out a few more months for
the dying, and more than a few more dollars for medibusiness,
but the Chinese need not go that route.  My guess is that the
Chinese leadership has thought this one out in advance and
something like that is their plan.

Also, it is hard to say exactly what a superpower-caliber
military is and who has one.  The Chinese, observing the
misfortunes of the United States, may be persuaded to
forgo the pleasures of empire.

Yes.  When you have virtually no force-projection capability, it's

Wow.

China is going to spend $45 billion on defense in 2007.  That's almost
much as Japan is spending.  And we know what a vaunted and fearsome
military the Japanese possess ...

Oh, wait ... the Japanese have no force projection capacity
whatsoever, and their entire defense budget is genuinely, not
euphemistically, devoted to actual defense.  And they're a much
smaller and much easier defended country than China (being an island
nation is kinda handy in that regard).  And yet, given their natural
defenses, their utter lack of interest in playing offense, and the
fact that they have over 30,000 troops from the world's most powerful
nation participating in their national defense, they still manage to
outspend China.

Sorta puts Chinese military spending in perspective.  And perspective
is a wonderful thing.

But only if you have it.

China has overtaken the US in consumption of some raw materials and is
heading fast towards exceeding US demand for energy resources. Quite how
this demand is going to be met from current energy resources is interesting.
Given that new sources, particularily of petroleum, are barely keeping pace
with current demand and expiration of older fields, where this extra
production is going to come from is probably going to be a key factor in the
next couple of decades. One way is for China to economically bully its way
into the 'prime customer' slot that the US has held for so long. Venezuala
perhaps points to how they can achieve that in some producing nations, using
disenchantment with US foreign policy methods to fuel long-term supply deals

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It will be tough. Growth have civil unrest on hold. Inflation and a

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If they are to become the next super power, they will have to rule

&gt;&gt; &gt; Actually, they are copying the US-style method : check out what is

&gt;&gt; &gt; in Africa. A combination of bank-rolling politicians and infrastructure

&gt;&gt; &gt; Give it another decade and they will be invading some Arabistan nation
&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt; 'protect' their oil.

&gt;&gt; That's my concern as well, China is dependent on oil and they will
&gt;&gt; need to be able to import more than most countries running at the pace
&gt;&gt; they are.  How much longer can they continue to operate like they are
&gt;&gt; now, without controlling some of the oil production for themselves?
&gt;&gt; Also, keep an eye on Venezuela and their relationship with China.

&gt;&gt; http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4123465.stm

&gt;&gt; &quot;Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez has offered China wide-ranging
&gt;&gt; access to the country's oil reserves.&quot;

&gt;&gt; China's thirst for fossil fuels...

&gt;&gt; &quot;China's oil imports doubled over the past five years and surged
&gt;&gt; nearly 40% in the first half of 2004 alone. These increases vaulted
&gt;&gt; the mainland ahead of Japan and into second place among the world's
&gt;&gt; biggest oil consumers, behind only the U.S.&quot;

&gt; China has overtaken the US in consumption of some raw materials and is
&gt; heading fast towards exceeding US demand for energy resources.

That's scarey too, given their size and population.

Quite how

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; this demand is going to be met from current energy resources is

&gt; Given that new sources, particularily of petroleum, are barely keeping

You are mostly right, and this is coming from a bean counter. China
needed capital in order to industrialize their nation and subdividing
their farmes for yet another generation of damn near medeival peasant
wasn't going to cut it. The reduction of population has come at the
same time the've retooled the agriaian sections of their economy to
become more mechanized, and done massive restructuring of their
educational systems. Gee, in a centrally planned economy all the
elements needed to come about for the shift to a industrial production
economy occuring at the same time? Coincidence? Exactly when it has
become readily apparent superpower status in the 21rst century will
have little to do with number of troops on the ground, and more to do
with economy and industrial might? Do you think maybe they planned it
since about the mid-eighties?

China isn't sentimental or dogmatic about its communism like the USSR
was. It sees the folly of empire in the US. It isn't going to slow
them down a whole lot.

That isn't saying much.  Big questions left unanswered are

I think the situation is more complicated than what you

thus unable to act as a major power.  I don't think (sorry)
the aging population business is that critical, and I think
(sorry again) that there are many ways of affecting world
events without trying to control them directly with
military force.  Meanwhile, competing world powers may
go in the can.  I can think of one that is definitely on the
edge.

I don't think that &quot;they&quot; screwed up at all by doing the one baby thing.
It was obvious that the people could not survive more population growth
unless &quot;they&quot; made war on other nations and took their resources.  That
single act, to me, indicates the ability of a people to deal with reality
without imperialism and war.  I frankly do not look at Chinese planning
since the 80's and see a nation that lusts after world domination or even
one that seeks the status of superpower. It may be that they will have no
choice if they are to provide for themselves.  But they do not want to be
kicked around and starved by a US military invading and occupying Iran and
Venezuela and thus controlling the world's oil supply. They will need
access to oil if they are to even survive.  That is not an aggression or a
threat.  It is reality. So yes they have been planning.  But that does not
infer EEEEEVVVILLLL.

However: What is troubling is their accumulation of US money in the form
of dollars or T-bills. In doing this they are financing the invasion of
Iraq and the possible invasion of Iran.  That does not compute unless
they wish to destroy the dollar so as to destroy US economic hegemony.
Are they colluding with the Republicans?  That is the appearance.
Instead of trading those dollars for more _real_ capital and energy to
grow their economy and make it more prosperous they are essentially
throwing the money into the sea or waiting to an appropriate time to do
something with it. Perhaps they are looking at just flat buying the state
of Wyoming or something. I can't tell what they are up to but they are not
going to be real happy with the inflation and the devaluation of the
dollar and Americans will not be happy with a depression. And that seems
to be where we are.

The real worry is the loss of that tiny semblance of our representative
government that still remains.  If it is true that we have the best
Congress that money can buy (and that certainly seems to be the case),
then America is in deep shit indeed. If the Chinese have all that money
then the Chinese own the Congress.

&quot;I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers
of society but the people themselves; and
if we think them not enlightened enough to
exercise their control with a wholesome
discretion, the remedy is not to take it from
them, but to inform their discretion by
education.&quot; - Thomas Jefferson
