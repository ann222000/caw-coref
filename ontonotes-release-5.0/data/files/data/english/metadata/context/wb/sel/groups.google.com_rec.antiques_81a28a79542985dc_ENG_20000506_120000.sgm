This is my post here, and I'm not sure this is the correct newsgroup for my
subject. I'd welcome suggestions, if that's the case.

I bought an &quot;antique&quot; Tibetan chest in Macau which continues to emit a
smoky, charred smell months after the purchase. I suspect it was &quot;aged&quot; in
some way, perhaps by intentional charring of the paint or varnish on the top
of the chest. The top is actually the part that smells. Can anybody tell
me how I might be able to get rid of this smell? It really reeks.

Thanks.

Fill it with activated (aquarium) carbon, wrap it in a plastic bag for a
couple of days?

The smoky smell might be subsided if you put the box in a closed room with an
air mover (fan) and an ozone machine.

The ozone machine is used to help dissipate smoky odors, but NOT a cure-all.

You can rent an ozone machine from your local fire restoration company or a
rental shop.

Good-Luck
