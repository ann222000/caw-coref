Well, the &quot;discussion&quot; of Pattern glass seems to be in need of a boost! I was
wondering after reading the recent posts on guide prices, what pattern glass
collectors seemed to think about price guides. In particular I've noticed a
trend here in Texas and I wonder if the same thing happens in other places.
What seems to happen around here is that if a dealer identifies a piece of
glass correctly it gets priced well above &quot;guide&quot; price regardless of
condition, or rarity. Unidentified or mis identified pieces are generally
available under guide price. For instance I bought an AUSTRIAN pattern 8in vase
this weekend that was only labelled old pattern glass goblet for about 25% of
the price listed by Measel in his Greentown Glass book. I'm convinced that if
this dealer had known what he had it would have been priced at twice the guide
price. Has anyone else encountered this recently?

"/>  Norm,

Here in Southeastern Kansas, the dealers are usually willing to
work with me. I hardly ever buy pattern glass for posted price. Plus,
I try to buy from dealers I know.

What do the other pattern glass dealers know about checking pattern
glass with a black light? I know a dealer, a sweet old lady, who
swears by it.

"/> The black (UV) light is not infallible. Basically, it works by causing
fluoresence of trace elements added to the glass to either increase
clarity or to modify the glass color (both slightly or obviously). The
common fluorescing element found in most PG from the last century is
Manganese -- this is the same trace mineral that causes purpling if the
glass is &quot;sun purpled&quot;. (Solar ultraviolet gives the glass a purple
&quot;tan.&quot; I suspect that prolonged exposure to the UV lamp would cause the
same thing but faster. I, at least, regard purpled glass as &quot;damaged&quot;
and so do many other collectors.) Getting back to the point, not all
glass manufacturers of the last century added manganese minerals to their
batch, and some present day manufacturers do add it. Other trace
elements may be more reliable, but you'd have to check with an expert.
(Uranium, for example, was used to color &quot;vaseline&quot; glass -- but it isn't
well-regarded in this nuclear age to include this in tableware, although
the radioactive (and fluorescing) element is probably well-sealed in the
glass and is unlikely to leach out.)
