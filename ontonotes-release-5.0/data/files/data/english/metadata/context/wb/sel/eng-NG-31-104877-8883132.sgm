125. VERO NIHIL VERIUS. THE MOTTO OF THE VERES,
.  THE MOST DISTINGUISHED EARLS OF OXFORD
.
Veritable, more veritable, and most veritable,
these three demonstrate that something can be truer than true.
That vero nihil verius is therefore wrong.
But this is truth. Nothing is truer than Vere.
This vere is sometimes understood narrowly, and sometimes loosely.
But, Vere, you do not admit a &quot;more&quot; and a &quot;less.&quot;

&lt;&lt;The Gutenberg Bible (also known as the 42-line Bible or the Mazarin
Bible) is a printed version of the Latin Vulgate translation of the
Bible that was printed by Johannes Gutenberg, in Mainz, Germany in the
fifteenth century. Although it is not, as often thought, the first
book to be printed by Gutenberg's new movable type system, it is his
major work, and has iconic status as the start of the &quot;Gutenberg
Revolution&quot; and the &quot;Age of the Printed Book&quot;. The detailed format of
printed bible is a possible imitation of a Mainz illuminated
manuscript, the so called Giant Bible of Mainz (Biblia latina), whose
1300 pages were written between 1452 and 1453.
.
The name 42-line Bible refers to the number of lines of print on each
page, and is used to differentiate this edition of the Gutenberg Bible
from the rarer 36-line Bible, which is also referred to as a Gutenberg
Bible. The term &quot;Gutenberg Bible&quot; is most commonly used to refer to
the more familiar 42-line edition.
.
Preparation of the bible began soon after 1450, and the first finished
copies were available in 1454 or 1455, using a printing press and
movable type. This Bible is the most famous incunabulum and its
production marked the beginning of the mass production of books in the
West. It was printed in the type styles that would become known as
Texture and Schumacher. A complete copy comprises 1282 pages, and most
bibles were bound in at least two volumes.
.
It is believed that about 180 copies of the Bible were produced, 45 on
vellum and 135 on paper, a number which marks a sharp contrast with
the prior technology for societies which, from time immemorial, had to
produce copies of written works laboriously by hand. Gutenberg
produced these Bibles (which were printed, then rubricated and
illuminated by hand, the work of specialized craftsmen) over a period
of a year, the time it would have taken to produce one copy in a
Scriptorium. Because of the hand illumination, each copy is unique.
.
In some copies of the Bible, the headings on a few of the sheets at
the top are printed in red; the initial pages were re-composed, and
the later copies for those pages are in black only, with the red
headers lettered by hand. On all later pages the red headings are
added by hand, and a printed list of the text to be added to each page
survives. This presumably represents a failed experiment.
.
As of 2007, there are 48 extant Gutenberg 42-line Bibles known to
exist. This includes eleven complete copies on vellum, and one copy of
the New Testament only on vellum. In addition, there are a substantial
number of fragments, some as small as individual leaves - at least one
copy is known to have been partially broken up to be sold in parts.
.
The country with the most copies is Germany, which has twelve. Mainz,
Moscow and the Vatican City contain two copies, Paris and London have
three copies, and New York has four copies. Three identified copies
have been lost - two disappeared from Leipzig after the end of the
Second World War, and one is known to have been destroyed along with
the library of the Catholic University of Leuven in 1914. However, the
former two were rediscovered in recent years, both in Moscow, where
they had been taken.&gt;&gt;

But Art -- the first line above is so inelegant -- you added
*three* cubes to produce a cube rather than two.

I have an idea, Art -- why don't you do something productive for a
change: why don't you look for examples of pairs of cubes of positive
integers whose sum is a cube?  Such a search would be far more likely
to succeed than your futile and farcical search for the author of the
Shakespeare canon.  MoreoVER, I can confidently predict that you will
be famous if you succeed.  Incidentally, Art, if you find such an
example, you might wish to notify your coreligionist &quot;Dr.&quot; Faker -- I
am sure that he would be keenly interested.

&lt;&lt;In Leonhard Euler's original proof for Fermat's Last Theorem n=3, he
made a mistake. For anyone interested in seeing the details of the
proof, it is perhaps comforting to know that a genius like Euler was
capable of getting the details wrong. The mistake came when Euler
tried to prove the key lemma of his proof. In his published proof,
Euler attempted to prove this lemma using imaginary numbers. Euler is
credited with the invention of the notation for imaginary numbers and
one of the most fascinating equations ever derived which is known as
Euler's Identity:

eiπ=-1

So, it is not too surprising that he would apply this method to
Fermat's proof. It is also very interesting to note that a less
innovative method can be constructed based on Euler's other work. This
is what I did in the proof that I presented earlier.

Also interesting is the fact that this technique turns out to be a
very important innovation which makes possible additional proofs for
n=5, n=7, and Kummer's proof for regular primes.

Euler tries to prove the following lemma:

Lemma: Given that p2 + 3q2 is a cube, show that there exist a,b such
that p = a3 - 9ab2 and q = 3a2b - 3b3.

Here's Euler's idea. What if we presuppose that there exists numbers
of the form:
a + b√-3

If we allow that these numbers exist, then we have the following
equation:

p2 + 3q2 = (p + q√-3)(p - q√-3)

So far so good. Mathematicals in general will allow any extension of
numbers as long as the extension is logically consistent. The rational
numbers extend the integers. Real numbers extend the rational numbers
and Complex numbers extend the real numbers.

Euler proceeds to show that the two complex numbers (p + q√-3, p -
q√-3) are relatively prime to each other. His proof here also works.
He then concludes that the two complex numbers must, therefore, be
cubes based on the reasoning of the Relatively Prime Divisor Lemma.
This is the mistake!

In modern notation, Euler assumed that Z[√-3] was characterized by
unique factorization. This is not completely correct. In actual fact,
Z[(-1 + √-3)/2] is characterized by unique factorization. This result
would be greatly extended by Carl Friedrich Gauss.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;But here I cannot omit to REVEal something to the reader concerning
the number of our prisoners, of whom those who weighed one, were
seven; those who weighed two, were twenty one; they who three, thirty
five; they who four, thirty five; those who five, twenty one; those
who six, seven; but he that came to the seventh, and yet could not
well raise it, he was only one, and indeed the same whom I released.
Besides these, of them who wholly failed there were many; but of those
who drew all the weights from the ground, but few. And as these each
stood before us, so I diligently numbered them and noted them down in
my table-book; and it is very admirable that amongst all those who
weighed anything, none was equal to another. For although amongst
those who weighed three, there were thirty five, yet one of them
weighed the first, second, and third, another the third, fourth, and
fifth, a third, the fifth, sixth, and seventh, and so on. It is
likewise very wonderful that amongst one hundred and twenty six who
weighed anything, none was equal to another; and I would very
willingly name them all, with each man's weight, were it not as yet
forbidden me.&gt;&gt;

.. the Virgin asked us whether we desired to begin the wedding.
.
&quot;Yes, noble and virtuous lady,&quot; said one. Whereupon she privately
despatched a page, and yet in the meantime proceeded in discourse with
us. In brief she had already become so familiar with us, that I
ventured to request her Name. The Virgin smiled at my curiosity, but
yet was not moved, but replied:
.
&quot;My Name contains five and fifty, and yet has only eight letters; the
third is the third part of the fifth, which added to the sixth will
produce a number whose root shall exceed the third itself by just the
first, and it is the half of the fourth. Now the fifth and the seventh
are equal, the last and the fifth are also equal, and make with the
second as much as the sixth, which contains just four more than the
third tripled. Now tell me, my lord, what am I called?&quot;
The answer was intricate enough to me, yet I did not leave off, but
said, &quot;Noble and virtuous lady, may I not have only one letter?&quot;
.
&quot;Yes&quot;, she said, &quot;that may well be done&quot;.
.
&quot;What then,&quot; I replied again, &quot;may the seventh contain?&quot;
.
&quot;It contains&quot;, she said, &quot;as many as there are lords here&quot;.
.
With this I was content, and easily found her Name, at which she was
very pleased, and assured us that much more should yet be *REVEalED*
to us.
