Elec Fan recommendation? SB Chev 66 Impala
</HEADLINE>

I am looking for any recommendations for an electric fan for my 66
Impala ragtop.
Has a mildly built 350. &lt;just got an implant of a comp cams 268H with
new springs/valves and roller tipped rockers and has 'camel hump'
heads.
Has a tendency to overheat when cruising/sitting in traffic so my
thinking is upgrading from the current Flex-a-lite blade fan (yes
running factory steel shroud) to an electric fan.
I did flush the radiator myself while it was removed from the car.

Subject: need help on a 71 paint issue

just recently finished repainting my 71 coupe with the 2002 corvette
electro
blue. It looks great and the painter did a really nice job.

The problem that has come up, is that on the hood, just above the air
breather area, the paint has air pockets.  The guy who painted it, took the
hood back and repainted it again and while the air pockets are not as many,
it is still occuring.  We did paint the inside a flat black, as many other
vettes that we looked, were also painted a flat black.

Could this be caused by the heat of the motor?? and if so, what would be
the
fix??

Any suggestions as to why or how, and what can be done would be
appreciated.

I would put a stock fan back on it and make sure it has the extension on
it (If it originally had one) so the fan sits completely up inside the
shroud. Also make sure it has a thermostat in it and it isn't stuck
open. I have had new ones open once and never close because of binding.
Another thing to check would be the heat riser, if it is stuck closed or
partially open it could cause what you are seeing. If you're running
stock compression ratio I see no reason this combo should be overheating.

I'm not sure how you get spammer out of a guy that posts a question
about a 66 Impala in an antique auto group and a Corvette question on a
Corvette group and happens to use a different name...... If he had
posted both questions on a bunch of different groups I might tend to
agree but not under the circumstances.

That's too cool Robin! I once owned a '58 Citation 2Dr. H.T. with  the
"teletouch" shifter and wish I'd kept it. Everyone used to think that the E
475 on the valve covers meant either 475 Cubic Inches or 475 horsepower.
They were usually disappointed to find that it was "only" 410 Cubic Inches
and 345 horsepower. But they were always impressed to hear that it had 475
ft-lb Torque @2600 rpm !

Are you running the stock E 400 engine? Sorry to hear that you're having
cooling problems. How hot is it running? Have you tried any fixes yet? I
never had heating issues with the Citation. Just lucky I guess.

The wagons are extremely hard to find in any condition. I was surfing the

And '58 is eye candy to me and gets me wishing again. Gee, that Caddy would
be a pretty sweet ride too! My memory's a bit foggy on the engine in the
'53. My brother had a '57 Coupe de Ville and I recall that it had a 365 c.i.
engine. I think the 365 came out in '56. I know the '53 had an overhead

&gt; few of them around, and it's fairly rare to see one pull up.  I have to
&gt; add at
&gt; least an hour to each vacation day for all the questions and such at gas
&gt; stops, restaurants, rest areas, etc.
">

I really think that the Edsel was ahead of its time Robin. Years later,
Pontiac used a very similar nose style. One of the reasons that I love the
Edsel, other than just because I think that it is a beautiful car, is simply
because they only made them for three years. Most older cars you buy are
still being made today in some form. Not the Edsel.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Most people just get all &quot;gee whiz&quot; when I tell them the engine is a 361.
&gt; The
&gt; never understand the &quot;E400&quot; on there.  The Teletouch really gets 'em
&gt; though,
&gt; especially when I show how it stays stationary when you turn the wheel.
&gt; (Be
&gt; pretty hard to shift if it didn't!  &lt;LOL&gt;)

&gt;&gt; Are you running the stock E 400 engine?

&gt; Completely.  Even has the original Edsel-specific Autolite carb (4100),
&gt; still
&gt; has points too, but will be getting a Pertronix ignition come spring.
">

As I recall, the E 400 was like the E 475, in that the 400 respresented the
ft-lb torque. Ford had such a variety of engines back in the late '50's.
People often don't believe me when I tell them that Chrysler wasn't the only
one with a 383 c.i. engine. Mercury had one too. Have you had any problems
with the Teletouch Robin? Mine had a habit of dropping down a gear as soon
as I let off the gas and dragging the rear end. I ended up dropping a 3
speed manual, out of a Mercury pickup, into it. I put a floor shifter on it.
Man, it hauled!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On some cruises, he'll heat up pretty bad if there's a lot of stop and go,
&gt; more so on a hot day.  The grille just doesn't lend itself to much airflow
&gt; when standing still, even worse with someone else's exhaust blowing into
&gt; it.

&gt;&gt; Have you tried any fixes yet?

&gt; Nothing.  I'd really like it if I could come up with a solution that would
&gt; allow me to use electric fans for cruises, then if I needed to have the
&gt; original fan back on, I could.  If that's not possible, I'd go with all
&gt; electric fans.  I'm not into showing or judging, so points mean nothing to
&gt; me
&gt; in the long run.

&gt;&gt; I never had heating issues with the Citation. Just lucky I guess.

&gt; We drive the Edsel all the time in the summer.  I take it to work even
&gt; (secure
&gt; parking), but the overheating is only really a problem on really hot days
&gt; where there's a lot of stop/go traffic or during slow car cruises.
">

I doubt that there are any aftermarket hi-flow water pumps available for an
Edsel, so the electric fan(s) may be the way to go. Before going that route
though Robin, you may want to try Red Line Water Wetter, which ia an
additive for your coolant. It's available at most suppy houses like Pep Boy,
etc.  A buddy of mine swears by it, after it dropped the running temperature
of his '55 Chevy by 30 degrees! And it's a lot cheaper than the electric fan
route!

LMAO! You're talking to a guy who worked on a lake freighter one summer
while in high school, so I know how quickly they stop and turn! Do you live
around the Great Lakes? I'm near Toronto, Canada on Lake Ontario. By the
way, I notice that the Caddie's a lady, while the Edsel is male. Other than
the obvious "Dagmars" on the Caddie, is there any other reason for that?
&lt;lol&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Edsel just has more of a &quot;wow factor&quot;, meaning people
&gt; mainly say &quot;Wow!&quot; when I pull up in it.  The Caddie scares 'em more, since
&gt; it's like a house pulling up.  &lt;laugh&gt;

&gt; I picked up the Edsel in Texas, and drove it 1400 miles home over two
&gt; days.
&gt; (as much as possible on Route 66) That's when I first experienced how
&gt; people
&gt; crowd around it.  One guy almost sideswiped a semi because he was too busy
&gt; staring at me than his driving.  (OK, that was a little scary)  I stopped
&gt; to
&gt; buy some windshield washer solvent at some auto parts place in Oklahoma,
&gt; and
&gt; they insisted on putting it in for me just to look the car over.  I got a
&gt; kick
&gt; out of that.
">

Again, I think that the Edsel does have a lot of "wow factor" because the
marque died in 1960, whereas names like Cadillac are still with us.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I really think that the Edsel was ahead of its time Robin.

&gt; As do I.

&gt;&gt; Years later, Pontiac used a very similar nose style.

&gt; Hell, there's a LOT of cars that look a lot like the Edsel grille now.
&gt; There's
&gt; a Suzuki (I think it is) that looks almost the same from the front.
">

Actually, now that you mention it,  a couple of Peugot models have a similar
nose. I don't know whether or not you've ever seen the Bugatti EB 16-4
Veyron supercar, but it has a variation of the Edsel snout. Check it out at
this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Veyron_16.4

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is a certain something to owning a car that you're not going to see
&gt; 20
&gt; others of at any car get together.  Usually, I'm the only Edsel there,

&gt; On the downside, parts are a little harder.  Well, some parts.  Some, I
&gt; just
&gt; look for a 57-59 Ford replacement.  58 Fairlanes make good donors for some
&gt; parts.  Ford 352 engines also offer many parts that'll fit on the Edsel's
&gt; 361
&gt; engine.  (That's where my left exhaust manifold came from.)
&gt; Of course, since there were two sizes of 58 Edsel (large:
&gt; Citation/Corsair,
&gt; small: Pacer, Ranger &amp; Wagons), that can complicate some parts as well.
&gt; I sometimes think owners of '59 Edsels have it made.  All models are
&gt; pretty
&gt; much the same, and a lot more of their parts are straight '59 Ford.  Of
&gt; course, 1958 was the only year where Edsel was it's own division of Ford.
&gt; By
&gt; '59, it was part of M-E-L.  (Mercury, Edsel, Lincoln)... and about 5000
&gt; cars
&gt; into the 60 production, it was gone altogether.

Someone once told me that many of the engine components of the 430 Lincoln
and Mercury engines were pretty much interchangeable with the 410 in the
Edsel. I never had occasion to find out if that was fact though.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Some people don't know it, but the Comet was supposed to be an Edsel.
&gt; I've

&gt; another where it says &quot;COMET&quot;.

&gt; Exactly.  Have you ever looked at www.edsel.com? Lots of Edsel
&gt; info/pictures
&gt; there.

I'll be cruising over to that site as soon as I send this message robin.
Thanks for the link!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Have you had any problems with the Teletouch Robin?

&gt; I'd never replace my Teletouch if I could avoid it.  That's one of the
&gt; things
&gt; people want to see.  Folks walk around it, then head right to the driver
&gt; door
&gt; and start pointing at the steering wheel to their friends.
">

The reason that I changed transmissions and shifters is simply that I
couldn't find anyone in my area who knew anything about the Edsel
transmission or Teletouch.  And it was quite a scare to have it drop into
low gear when I let off on the gas while doing 70 m.p.h.! &lt;laugh&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'd forgotten about that.  I've heard others talk about Red Line.  Perhaps
&gt; I'll have to add that when I do the spring anti-freeze change.  I figure
&gt; it
&gt; can't hurt, right?
&gt; 30 degrees would probably do me perfect, and cheaper is always nice.  :-)
&gt; Thanks for refreshing my memory on Red Line.

Glad to be of help Robin.

No problem...nothing worse than spammers/scammers in my opinion, but this
is as low as it gets...posing as a person with an auto-related problem-- is
nothing sacred??

Happy Holidays!

&gt; Very much so.  To the point where I found the Caddie while exploring Great
&gt; Lakes lighthouses, though she was found in the Green Bay peninsula.
&gt; (Dykesville, WI, to be exact)  I have pictures of both cars in front of
&gt; some
&gt; great lighthouses.  :-)

My wife and I were up that way in July while on our way back from Calgary,
Alberta, Canada. We decided to come home stateside and it was the right
decision. We saw some amazing scenery, not only around the Great Lakes, but
coming through Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.

&gt; I dunno.  The Edsel immediately became &quot;Eddy&quot; on the ride home, so he's a
&gt; he.
&gt; The Caddie is more a Grande Dame of a car.  I think of it as more
&gt; matronly, so
&gt; it's a she.

Makes sense to me! &lt;laugh&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That's what I've heard too.  After all, the &quot;large&quot; Edsels were build off
&gt; a
&gt; Merc frame, the &quot;small&quot; Edsels off a Ford one.

&gt; I've heard that you can almost take a 1958 Fairlane and bolt it right on
&gt; an
&gt; Edsel chassis &amp; vice-versa, but I don't think I'll be trying that anytime
&gt; soon.

Hey, I hope you Edsel owners don't cannibalize too many of those 1958
Fairlanes! I hope to get my hands on one some day. My dad passed away from a
heart attack at a young age, when I was just a kid and the last car he owned
was a '58 Ford 2 dr. sedan (Custom, I believe) and I'd really like to get a
nice Fairlane for nostalgic reasons.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt; Exactly.  Have you ever looked at www.edsel.com? Lots of Edsel
&gt;&gt; &gt; info/pictures
&gt;&gt; &gt; there.

Thanks again for that link Robin. I spent a lot of time in there last night.
I couldn't believe the huge database.
