Indijenus skolur Ward Churchill issues what the Denver Post calls a "stinging rebuttal" to a report finding him guilty of academic misconduct. What the Post calls "stinging" is what I call conclusive evidence of illiteracy.

Still, Churchill makes one telling point:

Ethnic Studies programs were introduced into universities precisely because the standard practices of mainstream disciplines (history, sociology, anthropology, etc.) had failed to incorporate historical and contemporary knowledge they [who's "they"] found inconvenient, thereby producing inaccurate and misleading “academic truth.” To rectify this, Ethnic Studies not only bases itself in the perspectives of diverse communities, but employs its own set of research practices and methodologies.

[...]

In this connection, it should be noted that all of the indigenous witnesses confirmed that my work conforms to the expectations of native tradition concerning scholarship. An expert from the affected nations confirmed my assertions concerning the oral traditions on the deliberate infection of the Mandan, Arikara and Hidatsa peoples. Nonetheless, this entirely non-Indian committee took it upon itself to declare that I “was disrespectful of Indian oral traditions when dealing with the Mandan/Fort Clark smallpox epidemic of 1837.”

In other words, "You hired me to sling this bullshit--I mean 'work conforming to the expectations of native tradition concerning scholarship'-- and now you're condemning me for doing precisely that."

Every pinhead who had anything to do with hiring and promoting this fraud needs to go. Abolish Ethnic Studies and every other academic department that seeks to insulate itself from the requirements of authentic scholarship by employing, as Churchill puts its it, " its own set of research practices and methodologies."

Of course this won't happen. Instead, the remedy, as the University sees it, is to redouble its committment to the same noxious ideology that created Churchill in the first place.

How can you be illiterate and write a telling point?

"How can you be illiterate and write a telling point?"

Some people's only purpose in life is to be a cautionary example to others.

It's too bad that Ward shares a last name with a worthwhile human being; it makes his use in this way more linguistically challenging: "Don't be such a Churchill" scans well, but is regrettably ambiguous.

Do you mean that I made a telling point, your contradicting yourself, even though I am unable to write? Did I follow your comment?
