Hello Vince, Bill, Liz and everyone else,
I have a question. Apart from going back to Thamkrabok to re-connect
in that way, how does one manage to maintain some kind of spiritual
perspective in the midst of what seems to me to be a jungle of samsara?
I am training to be a nurse and I must say that although on the one
hand it is exciting to be doing what I am doing, on the other hand I
feel kind of lost. Two subjects to be avoided at all costs with most of
my peer group (all trainee nurses) - spirituality (any talk of buddhism
or sitting or such like)and of course addiction matters. People around
me are generally in to either going out, getting drunk, getting laid
and so on or talking about it.
I attend a buddhist meditation class weekly and I sit three or four
times a week by myself and this really helps. Nonetheless I really miss
being around like-minded people who have had and are going through
similiar experiences to me. Anyone remember a guy called Buddha???
Anyhow, anybody got any wisdom or experience they would like to share
I would sure appreciate it!
I really hope everybody is doing well and staying strong. Those downs
do come on strong, and temptation comes hand in hand with them. It's
tough alright sometimes.
May the whole world and every living thing in it be happy for ever.
Over and out.
David.

Everywhere is a &quot;jungle of Samsara&quot;. The dukkha and confusion are
determined by your
Kamma and your practice. I've seen some people who just keep on turning
up at Thamkrabok hoping to &quot;re-connect&quot; again and again, and sinking
into confusion and listlessness in between, because actually walking
the path never feels as exciting as that first step when you feel full
of hope and new possibilities, but haven't yet encountered any
obstacles. I can tell you from experience that it's just as possible to
feel bewildered and hopeless in TKB as it is in Deptford - the place
itself has no magic Sajja-power to tank up on, and in fact; in the last
year or so, the monastery has been infested with western ex-patients
reluctant to go home, most of whom quickly revert to chemical and
general mayhem for precisely that reason - they believe that the power
of Thamkrabok lies outside themselves. They are asking us to save them,
basically. We can't.

However, going back could be an excellent thing to do, with a clear
purpose in mind, such as some heavy Buddhist practice, preferably as a
monk (or nun). Particularly the tudong in April, which is when the
entire monastery decamps to the forest (the detox centre is closed) and
the monks are free from all duties and distracting contact with
laypeople. There is nothing to do except meditate, and the senior monks
are also much more available for consultation. Many Thai disciples do
this every year, and I'm intending to ordain again this year for the
tudong. The rain-season (mid-July to mid-October) is also a traditional
time for temporary ordination (in fact Thai law gives you the right to
leave-of-absence from work, like maternity leave - how very civilised),
but then the emphasis would be more on work around the monastery.

If you wish to strengthen your Sajja practice right here and now, I
would recommend integrating &quot;small&quot; sajjas into your daily life. This
is a major part of what TKB monk practice is anyway. For example; next
time you meditate, do as the monks do - say a short sajja-prayer in
your own words, undertaking to meditate, and for how long, as of...NOW.
Try to feel conscious of the moment when the Sajja begins; this is the
moment when a vague intention becomes determined action, which is
crystallysed in the moment of speaking it. The traditional Sajja-prayer
closes with the words &quot;together with body, word, and heart&quot;, or in
other words, &quot;action, speech and intention&quot; which are the three ways in
which Kamma is made. Sajja means &quot;truth&quot;, and the action of &quot;being
true&quot; means a lot more than just &quot;not lying&quot;, it means uniting these 3
elements absolutely. You must always cross-check each one against the
other two - if you mean it, say it. If you say it, do it. If you don't
want to say it or do it, perhaps you don't really mean it, etc.

In Lokutara-Tam, which is the (minority) form of Buddhism practised at
Thamkrabok, Sajja has been turned into a formal practice of taking vows
which control our actions from that point onwards. Practitioners will
often take many Sajjas in the course of a day (alone, not in the formal
way with a senior monk present) which might be as mundane as &quot;I will
sweep this yard until it's swept&quot;. Then you sweep - the phone rings:
don't answer. It starts raining: never mind. Beyond this, you try to do
nothing BUT sweep the yard - don't hum a tune in your head, don't
mentally write your shopping list for when you go out. When it's time
to shop; shop. Now you you're sweeping.

But don't think that this is just an exercise for training the will in
some kind of gritted-teeth way: &quot;i've said it, so I'll do it, no matter
what&quot;. What if the phone rings, and you remember that it might be
something important? Well, if it's important enough, break Sajja and
answer it. What you've learned is to think before you take Sajja. As I
said, uniting intention, speech and action. You intend to meditate -
ask yourself; &quot;is my intention right? is there anything else I should
deal with first?&quot; if it's the right thing, then ask yourself whether
now is the right time; if it is, then don't mess around, don't have
another cup of coffee first, don't light a cigarette, speak your Sajja,
and do it. If you might get an important call, take a Sajja to meditate
for however many minutes, no matter what, ignoring mental distractions,
agonising leg-cramps, etc. &quot;unless the phone rings, in which case, I'll
answer&quot;. Sajja is a tool for developing mindfulness, as well as
determination.

Since you've been to Thamkrabok, I wonder whether Luangpor Charoen, or
Ajahn Chien also gave you an &quot;abstract Sajja&quot; to practice, as well as
your no-drugs Sajja. What I mean, is: something like; &quot;I will depend
only on myself&quot;, ie. related to purely mental action. Monks are
sometimes given a set of Sajjas like this to practice daily on a
rotating cycle. I always found that the best way to deal with this is
to meditate on Sajja first thing in the morning, meaning &quot;meditate&quot; in
the sense of reflect, rather than concentration-meditation. What are
you undertaking today? What are the ways in which you could fail? Many
people presented with this particular Sajja say &quot;sure, I depend on
myself&quot;, and think no more about it. Really? While practising this
Sajja you must identify every single thing, no matter how tiny, which
you demand or expect from outside yourself. Suppose I offer to make you
a cup of tea - from that moment, you expect me to do it - if I forget,
then I've let you down, so you are (mildly, I hope) annoyed with me.
Why? because you depended on me. Imagine you see your friend and sit
down for a chat - you are now depending on him to be your friend and
welcome your company, like he usually does. Maybe he doesn't want to
talk today - perhaps you should ask if he minds: now you are depending
on him to tell you how things are, rather than your own senses. Now
your senses tell you that he is agitated and wants to go and do
something else. You are depending on your senses - are your senses
&quot;you&quot;? You have some heavy physical work to do, but you strain your
back - is your back you? Someone passes by and offers to help, are you
breaking Sajja if you accept? Surely one part of you is your ability to
communicate and request help? What if the work doesn't get done? What
is depending? On what? What does it mean to depend? etc. Soon you start
wondering whether you should not have taken Sajja at all, since
intention without understanding is as bad as intention without
determination, but if we think too much, we'll never do anything - we
have to find our limitations and personal compromises, and work with
them.

Reflecting on these sorts of things before and after Sajja practice are
a training for constant awareness of what you intend to do, whether and
how well you are doing it, what the reasons for it are, what the
factors are in success and failure, and they teach us to simultaneously
be determined, and self-questioning - which may seem like two
opposites, but all opposites eventually reconcile in Buddhism. By
making Sajja a
continual daily practice, your &quot;big&quot; Sajjas, such as abstaining from
all drugs, will be renewed and re-inforced. This too is a daily
practice; not something that happened in the past.

Finally, I'll just say, don't worry too much about not having anyone to
talk to about these things - talking can be a terrible trap, both
substituting for real action, and encouraging us to &quot;sum up&quot; and
package our experiences too neatly, for someone else's consumption.
Once someone has asked you &quot;what is Sajja?&quot;, or &quot;what did Thamkrabok do
for you?&quot;, your over-simplified explanation can define and limit your
understanding, as you begin to believe your own words too much. This is
another implication of &quot;body, word, and heart&quot;. People talk so much and
so easily, without constantly referring words to actions and
intentions: if you didn't meditate this morning, and you probably won't
tomorrow, then don't bother talking about it now. If you think it's a
good thing to be doing then go and do it. Not that discussion is a bad
thing, if it is truly related to an exchange of information regarding
real things that will be done, but it too often happens for its own
sake, and dissipates energy which could be better used in actually
doing something. On this subject, by the way, I think it would be
easier if you meditated every day at a regular time - routine is a very
useful tool, however much free-spirited types may recoil from it.

If you want any more specific advice on what Sajjas would be good for
you to practice, how, and when. Try to put a question in a reasonably
succinct paragraph, and I can translate it and forward it to Ajahn Tong
at Thamkrabok, who is the most computer literate of the senior monks
there, in addition to being the nicest, smiliest, and most patient man
I have ever met.

Many thanks for your wisdom Pete. Taking sajja on the meditating daily
is what I now will do for the next 9 days (till I go away for Xmas).
Meditation works for me but my mind doesn't like it at all! the more I
meditate the emptier I feel and then the more my mind creates a whole
drama that meditating is this or that and I invariably end up listening
to my mind again and stalling practice. Will post back to the forum in
10 days or so the result of taking this sajja - I know it will be
positive.
Up to my hind teeth in college stuff up till summer - no time to return
to TBK for the Tudong in April, but it has been on my mind.
I wish everyone in the compound there the best, and all of you outside
of it too.
David :)

Hey Pete,

I'm impressed! Not only did you fail to inform me of this, but you have
also opened my mind up to something new. I never looked at it in that
way and it explains alot. I often find myself making prommises that I
can't, don't or won't keep. I think that going to TBK will do more then
detox and help me off my addiction, but show me ways in which I can
life a better and more fuller life.

Thanks for opening my mind that little bit more.

Darko

Dear Friends,

The Festive Season is once again here, and some describe it as the &quot;Season of Goodwill&quot;

Would that the season of goodwill were to extend over the entire year. With all folk, from all nations, discarding both avarice and anger. Adopting in their stead &quot;Loving Kindness&quot;

At this time of the year I believe it is appropriate to extend sincere thanks to everyone within the Thamkrabok Monastery, and to those around the world who have a committed link to promoting, helping and facilitating entry for those seeking to take that very special step.

To those who have taken that step, those who will be taking that step. To those within Thamkrabok who hold out the hand of welcome and guidance throughout the course of detoxification, and to those around the world who are associated with the programme I wish you all the Compliments of the Season.

Sawasdee Pee Mai, and with Metta,

Brian

David - here's another idea for you. Vince's stuff about the
precepts being positive practices, instead of just restrictions, made
me think of it.

When I was a monk I was under the five precepts that all Buddhists
follow, but I tried to think of them in a more holistic sense, eg. If
you don't tell lies, you can say that you are keeping the 4th
precept, okay, good, but a monk should try to be as completely true as
he can in every way; to avoid all the little tricks which are not
actual lying, and, deeper still, the whole subtext of contrivance and
emotion - I can tell you something that is factually true, but in
that situation, what I am really saying but be different, or even
totally unrelated: it might be simply attempting to get you to see me
in a certain way, as the kind of person who thinks this or that way. I
can lie to you by the way I say &quot;good morning&quot;, I can lie without
speaking. Once you start trying to be mindful of all this, you can
really tie yourself in knots, but this is one luxury which a monk has
- to immerse himself so totally in practice that he can hardly do
anything else, because this is all he has to do. Precept no.2 - what
can I take that may not be given? Your time? Your attention? Making you
care about me? I can steal lots of things before you could actually
have me arrested as a thief. And there are ways of asking which make it
harder to refuse - I can steal your consent, if I'm clever. Etc.
etc.

How this relates to precept number 5 (or equally, your drug Sajja,
which is pretty well the same thing), to abstain from intoxicating
liquor and drugs, is - I tried to abstain from all intoxication of
any kind. However, I took this to mean not the literal meaning of the
English word &quot;intoxication&quot;, ie. to poison myself (which probably
shouldn't be given too much weight, because the precepts were not
written in English), but with the meaning of &quot;drunkeness&quot;. When I
&quot;did&quot; drugs, I didn't really &quot;do&quot;them - I just took them
and got on with something else. What I mean is; it's not often like
it is in Trainspotting, where you float away on a fluffy cloud of
chemicals which occupy your whole attention (unless it's an
overdose!); it quickly becomes utterly mundane - for me it was more of
a smokescreen which I put around myself to make my contact with reality
less intense, less urgent. It was basically a tool for reducing
mindfulness(sati), in Buddhist terms, because mindfulness leads to
awareness that maybe action should be taken - to change my
circumstances, myself. Mindfulness can be a blessed state, but also an
accursed one, if it's not part of a bigger picture of morality -
the precepts - Sajja - skillful kammic actions: and also acceptance
of reality, as opposed to childish fantasy.

So, I asked myself, &quot;what else to I do to hide from the world, or
cloud my mindfulness and perception of reality?&quot; and I soon wished I
hadn't, because there was shitloads. Obvious things were books and
movies, so I gave these up (while I was a monk). Of course, you can
watch a movie with active interest and engagement; and it doesn't
even have to be a highbrow &quot;educational&quot; one - some stupid comedy
can be watched as a meaningful activity, as long as you are fully
engaged and know what you are doing - but it so easily slips into
just chewing gum for the mind. I figured that, anytime I am doing one
thing and beginning to think about something else - at least one
(sometimes both!) of these, is intoxication and I should decide which
requires my attention - or neither. If I'm watching TV and also
talking to you, then maybe I'm not sufficiently interested in either,
and I should think harder about how I want to spend my time. I began to
see that enormous amounts of time in my life had been devoted to
activities the only purpose of which was to make this day go by, to get
through to tomorrow. For what, exactly? I found that I had an enormous
impulse to quite simply waste my time, and that drugs had come along
and done this magnificently for me, and that this was perhaps what I
liked about them. Then it got really bad - . I found that pretty well
anything I did, if done without active mindfulness, could verge on
intoxification - work, conversation, even meditation. EVERYTHING,
even &quot;good&quot; things, if done absent-mindedly, could be no more than
just keeping my body and mind busy, until I was tired enough to go to
sleep, feeling pleased with myself because I'd &quot;done something&quot;.
I came to Thamkrabok thinking I'd spent 5 years off my head, and then
found that it was more like a lifetime.

When I stopped being a monk after 2 years, for a while I was quite
overwhelmed by the outside world, seeing meaningless sense-input and
pointless activity everywhere. I'm back in it now and thoroughly
corrupted, but I still feel that when you can walk into a bar in any
town-centre and see music-videos with the sound off, another song
blasting out of the stereo, a football match on another screen, while
people sit with one group of their friends, texting someone else (AND
drinking beer), then getting up and moving to another bar with exactly
the same stuff, that a lot of people are working very hard to do
anything, consume anything, to avoid actually experiencing their actual
lives. I don't really see a big difference between what you pour down
your neck, and whatever else you put in your head by other routes. So I
try to monitor what goes in, and it's frightening how much
crap-cunningly-disguised-as-my-life manages to sneak past.

To practise this way, you don't have to go all grim and joyless -
you can sit and talk rubbish with a friend, sometimes that's a good
thing; we just need a moment of human closeness - but to apply sati,
so we know we're doing that, deciding when to do that, and when to go
and do something else. You can even take a night off and be a couch
potato, watching rubbish TV, if you know that you're worn out, and
that's what you need to do to get your energy back for tomorrow. We
can't always be scurrying about doing great and meaningful things; we
have to know our limits. But hardcore practice helps us to learn where
these limits are, and I totally recommend devoting some time to this
- either a period of your life as a monk, or a regular hour or two
when you try to just screen out absolutely everything that robs your
attention for no good reason.

So this is what I now think of as &quot;intoxication&quot; - everything
that is going to contribute to me being suddenly 60 years old, and
saying &quot;what the hell happened? Where did all the time go?&quot;. In a
practical sense, also, for just trying to stay straight, I hope that
cultivating this awareness will prevent me from getting to the point
where I've just chopped out a fat line of coke and thinking &quot;maybe
I shouldn't do this&quot;, because I think that any factors which are
making me feel like fogging my mind up and wasting my life, are those
leading back to drugs - the best way I've yet found to achieve
these two things. I don't find unhappiness, sadness, or pain
particularly challenging to sobriety - what I think most dangerous to
me now are those drifty, wooly, bored, unmotivated days, when I can't
decide what to do, when my mind starts catching onto trivial things.

In the end, it's just the precepts - what's wrong with drugs?
They destroy mindfulness. So cultivating mindfulness will keep us off
drugs, and in an active, interesting, joyful way - we don't just
&quot;not do drugs&quot;, we go and &quot;do&quot; the exact opposite.
