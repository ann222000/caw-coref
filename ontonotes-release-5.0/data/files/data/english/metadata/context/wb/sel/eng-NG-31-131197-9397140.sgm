WEDNESDAY, 11/6/07

Well, Neville and Julie are having fun.  I haven't even had time to  write
about our adventures!!  He thinks I'm the worst driver in the world  and he
pretends like he knows where we're going and we've gotten lost everyplace  we have
gone!!  He figured out how to use the GPS that I have and didn't  know how to
use so I have to listen to him telling me to go left in 2.1 miles,  1.9
miles, 1.7 miles.......  I hate the GPS.   LOL.  We went  out to eat at the
Columbia Restaurant in Ybor City with a group from the event  and it was lovely.  I
hadn't been there before.  We've eaten at the  beach and went shopping
yesterday.  Julie made a good breakfast yesterday  morning and she's even getting her
hair done faster.  IN FACT we had to  wait for Neville day before yesterday
before we could leave.  He's trying  to teach Lucy how to dance but she doesn't
understand a word he says.  We  went to Arline's class last night and it was
packed!!  John Robinson taught  Shades; Geoff taught Firecracker and Neville
taught Looking for Something.   It was great to see so many people at our little
Tuesday night class.  We  danced a bunch of the hits from the weekend and it
was fun!!  It's good to  know that so many people will be coming back again
next year and bringing their  friends.  Remember tomorrow night (Thursday) we're
going to Dallas Bull and  the lessons are in the upstairs area and then we
always go downstairs after the  lessons to just dance.   Lessons start at 7:30.
Hope to see you  there.  Neville and Julie and John Robinson will be there
for sure and I  haven't heard from Craig Bennett but he got directions from me
at the Tampa  event so I guess we'll know when we get there.

SUBJECT: Tampa Bay Classic
Just a quick  note to say how much I truly enjoyed the Classic....I feel so
honored to have  been asked to instruct this year. Arline is so poised and
professional when it  comes to running this event...everything went so
smoothly...(even the fire alarm  'drill'????) Anyway, it was my pleasure to meet some of
my favorite  choreographers and learn some of the awesome dances they write. I
just keep  wondering where they come up with all this creativity? It was
pretty cool to rub  elbows with the likes of Vivienne Scott, Zac, Rosie Multari,
Bill McGee, Robbie  McGowan Hickie, Neville, Pepper, and the list goes on and
on; and Olivia  Ray....great DJ, always there keeping the beginner/improver
room hopping! DJ  Louie kept the main floor hopping late into the night. What a
great event...it's  certainly on my list for next year. A big hand to Arline
for hosting such a  great event!

Subject: Tampa Line Dance Classic
From: John Korman _page ... @comcast.net_ (mailto:page ... @comcast.net)

My first time attending the Tampa Line Dance Classic was great! Just weeks
ago, I saw most everyone at Windy City and it was a thrill to see folks from
all  over the world once again. Glad to see Feni and hear she was doing okay
(taking  it one day at a time) due to the wildfires in CA, my gals Janet and
Sheryl from  AZ did not get eaten by scorpions, and put a face to a name (Joseph)
from a  write up in the newsletter about FL Masters. Of course, it was good to
see for  the first time Robbie McGowan Hickie, Shaz Walton, and Big Dave, and
once again  see Dee Musk and Craig Bennett.

Arrived late on Thursday night so the dance floor was not packed, but was
told early in the night it sure was. I recommend attending the Thursday night
open dancing - time to warm up your feet, visit with friends before rushing
between workshops, scarfing down a meal, and joining everyone on one dancefloor.

But it all started 9AM early Friday and workshops did not stop for me until
Sunday at 3PM! At night after lessons, I roamed between the dance rooms (main
dance floor with &quot;the one&quot; Louie St. George), Big Dave and the Brit Pack and
Maggie Gallagher room, and Olivia Ray, not to miss workshop reviews with the
instructors. With my slicked back hair, cigarette pack rolled up in the
sleeve,  and a cig hanging behind my ear, I was ready to rock the jukebox. The
buffet  dinner on Saturday night was good; sat with folks from NY, FL, and the UK
(hello  Katie!). I liked the idea of two dinner seatings--eat dinner first,
then dance,  or dance and then eat dinner (I did the latter). Louie did a great
job of  playing older songs and line dances that had a jive feel to them to
fit the 50s  theme of the night--CALIENTE, NO RETURN. For those that &quot;got the
memo&quot; outfits  were cute, especially Kathy G, ladies with their poodle skirts,
and the women  from the Shotz Brewery. For those that did not get the memo,
John Robinson and  Junior Willis still rocked the crowd during their show numbers
with Michael  Barr. Hot Pepper and DJ Jam were the ultimate crowd pleaser
with her serving him  at the drive-in on rollerskates. The Brit Pack was not to
be outdone, even  getting Big Dave to join the fun taking his shirt off
catching some sun from the  bright lights on the floor. Like always, Sunday was
depressing knowing the fun  was going to end. I just wish there was more open
dancing after the last  workshop before the floor was picked up.

Workshops were coordinated well and Arline Winerman made her presence
throughout the weekend, even managing to teach a few. The hotel accommodations  were
great (minus the fire alarm which balanced out an hour more of dancing or
sleep, depending), the main dance floor and Big Dave's floor were awesome. Kudos
to all the volunteers! Now the workshops:

I'LL MAKE YOU DANCE (fitzgerald/harris) - this line dance sure does! Great
dance to a hip song from American Idolist Elliott Yamin. The last half of the
dance was the trickiest for a lot of people with the turns, but by Sunday most
had it down. Well taught to a full workshop floor; this is my favorite dance
of  the weekend. Highly recommend.

BOOM BOOM BOOM - cute number taught by Bill McGee. The stomps/holds at the
end really fit the music and picking it up again &quot;boom boom boom.&quot; Good dance
for high beginners. If you like Southern Delight, you will enjoy this.

ONE HEART TOO MANY (musk) - so many dance styles in this line dance:
cha-cha, rhumba, niteclub. The music is quick, but you can feel the beat.  Another
dance I recommend.

APOLOGIZE (walton) - a tricky number especially the first 8-counts, but  stay
with it and learn the rest of this dance. Well choreographed and taught.
Because the teach did not fill the hour, dancing it several times thereafter and
review at night, I apologized to myself for almost giving up. Because of the
restart and short song length, you only go around the room once.

BOARDROOM (rowe/detweiller) - Fun dance with some hand movements, but just
sing Patty Cake to yourself and you can get through it. Another great song from
Timbaland. If you like GIVE IT TO ME, this one's for you.

TOO LITTLE TOO LATE (willis/hot pepper) - THE dance I had to master before
carrying my luggage to the airport van. It was only my 15th lesson (okay 3rd)
but it's never too late to pick it up again. Great NC2 line dance by Junior
and  Pepper with some very different moves that fits the music by JoJo. Highly
recommend this dance.

LET'S GET SAVED (mcinerney) - Awesome song by Prince and the dance fits
every beat, even the walk &amp; holds, and syncopations thereafter. Well
choreographed. Floor filler in the workshop room and open dancing. Highly  recommend this
dance. A perfect teach by FL's own Marilyn McNeal which Big Dave  added high
remarks to.

CLOTHES OFF (craig) - fun dance to a Gym Class Heroes song even with your
clothes on; won choreography competition at Windy City 2007. Well choreographed,
especially the last 8-counts. The dance may look harder than it is. Well
taught  by Kathy &quot;cute cute cute&quot; G to filled workshop floor.

SHIM SHAM BOOGIE (clark/king) - cute number to a musical group I had not
heard of before, but introduced me to. John R did a great job of breaking down
the steps and talking about Shim Sham and where some of the steps originated
from. Many people were boogeying on the packed dance floor.

CHARLESTON FREEZE (herbert/robinson) - easy number to an upbeat Vince Gill
song. Highly recommended for beginners-advanced, especially those just learning
line dances. Taught in 3 minutes to a packed floor.

GRAVITY (mcwherter) - fun dance to a John Mayer song that is growing on me.
The last half of the dance needed the most review during the workshop, but
everyone had it come music time. Did you know this is Bryan M's first waltz he
has choreographed? Nice dance where a lot of personal styling can be  added.

LOOKIN' FOR SOMETHING (fitzgerald/harris) - liked this dance, but I'd  rather
look for I'LL MAKE YOU DANCE. Once the &quot;sighs&quot; were let out learning this
was choreographed to a Brittany Spears song, no one seemed to care when the
music was played. Great track with sampling by the Eurthymics. Another good
teach to a crowded floor.

DANCING IN LINE (hickie) - Good dance with similar moves from Keep On
Dancin' although the song is not Latin. Like all the write ups, another good  song
by Rick Guard with dance matching the music.

SEXY OREO (rowe/amato/miranda) - Semi-fast paced dance to a great/classic
song by Tom Jones. Many of the steps match the lyrics (just reach out and touch
me) which makes the dance fit the music. Just remember to start the dance
after  the rockets. Well taught to a crowded workshop floor.

WTF (mcwherter) - fun dance to yet another great hip-hop song by Timbaland.
I said &quot;WTF&quot; to myself taking this on early Sunday morning, but by the hour's
end, I said W.T.F. (What the Funk?). Well taught for early Sunday morning,
and  everyone had their own funk by hours end. Although this is choreographed to
the  album version of the song, Bryan did say it will work to the dance mix
so there  can be a floor-split for other dances to the same song.

BETTER OFF ALONE (musk) - wonderful waltz to another American Idolist,
Katharine McPhee. Easy restart on wall 3 and the steps flow nicely with the  music.
Well taught to a packed workshop floor, considering Dee had a flight to
catch right after. Highly recommend.

THE DANCE (bennett) - a great NC2 line dance to the track by Westlife, and
for those that can only dance country music, it will work to the Garth Brooks
version. Well choreographed with some tricky moves and spins, but don't let
these steps sway you. Modify them for yourself and dance The Dance away. Highly
recommend.

HOT STUFF (bennett) - premiered at Tampa to a great song by Craig David  with
sampling of David Bowie. Different sequence of moves in this dance compared
to Craig's others, and worth learning because the dance flows with the  music.

FREAKY SKILLS (walton) - fast-paced dance Walton-style with bounces and
syncopations that fit every beat. Great song by Play-N-Skills that grows on you.
Hardest part was learning this as the last dance of the event, rather than
earlier in the weekend. Good teach to a packed floor where everyone got their
freak on. This is the next Fuego!

Subject: Tampa!
From: Norma in Brooksville FL
If you missed this awesome event, you want to be sure to  come next year! It
was wonderful! Hob knobbing with all these globe trotting  professionals was
just not to be believed. And Arline was everywhere at once, as  she always is,
just making sure everyone is having a good time, which of course,  we all
were! She sure is a very dignified gracious lady. However, when she  almost lost
her skirt, the audience just about fell off their chairs!! Arline  took it in
her good grace, and just continued on with Barry Durand and they  finished
their 'class act' dance number, no problem! Arline is the best! I won't  go into
all the dances taught, as I'm sure someone else will, but I do want to  say
that this is the most organized, fun event ever. The instructors were all  very
nice, always stopped to say hi, even though they didn't know most of the
dancers there. I loved seeing lots of old dear friends that I haven't seen in
ages, some since last Classic! The beds were very comfortable, the food court  was
great, the a/c was perfect, the vendors were a nice variety (especially the
shoes!) and the music was supurb. This Tampa Bay Line Dance Classic is must go
and have a good time event, for sure! Remember, mark your calendar for the
second weekend in November for next year! My group is already making  plans!

Subject: Japan  Country Dance Challenge - Part 2
From: Lilian Lo

Tokyo is one of Hong Kong people's favorite holiday spots. So, it  took
little effort for me, Lilian Lo to drum up the interest of our Hong  Kong
group for JCDC.

We arrived a few days early to make sure and find time to enjoy  some
shopping, fine dining, sight-seeing and hot spring bathing before  hitting
the highlight of our trip, the event. As teasers, we joined a couple  of
workshops hosted by some Tokyo groups and began to expose ourselves to  the
vibrations and friendliness of the Japan line dance community.

Yokohama is an hour's subway ride from Tokyo. We were delighted to find  our
hotel rooms facing the enchanting Yokohama waterfront. The five minute  walk
to the event hall in the refreshing autumn weather was a pleasure.

Prior to the event, the organizers had compiled an open dance play list  put
together from lists submitted by the various participating groups. So,  at
the Friday evening kick off party, the floor was filled at all times.  At
the top of the play chart was DOORS OF LIFE done to a Japanese song.  Next
came A GIGOLO, IT'S UP TO YOU, RIO, ROSE GARDEN, BOSA NOVA, CHILL  FACTOR,
CUTE CUTE CUTE, DON'T FEEL LIKE DANCING, GEEK IN THE PINK, LAST  MINUTE....

On the next two days, I apportioned my time between teaching, watching  the
compeititon and taking classes. There were 150 participants throughout  the
event with the majority Japanese. Dancers in my classes were fast  learners
and attentive to every instruction given. Whenever necessary,  interpretors
translated my instruction into Japanese. In a similar manner,  non-Japanese
speaking dancers enjoyed the warm assistance of the  English-speaking
hospitality staff throughout the event.

The Individual, Team, Choreography and Honky Tonk competitions injected  a
lot of energy into the event. I was suitably impressed by the big leap  that
Japan dancers have taken on their dance skill over the last few  years.
My main goal in attending JCDC was to learn from the superstars. I was  glad
that I could attend Lee Easton's technique class on turning. Lee taught  all
kinds of swirls and twirls like monterey turn, spin, chaine turn,  rolling
turn.... Brian Barakauskas showed us how to dance with attitude in  his
cuban movement class. Andrew Sinclair, with the assitance of Lee gave  a
session on couples west coast swing, in which the interest is growing  in
Japan. When I got home, I couldn't stop bragging about having  couple-danced
with a Superstar.

And next up is Robin Sin from Singapore. You can read his report  tomorrow.

SUBJECT:  WHERE TO  DANCE IN EL PASO, TEXAS
We invite you all to visit us in  person or on our website
_ www.elpasolinedance.com_ ( http://www.elpasolinedance.com )  Our location  and map with time etc.
can be found on the site as well as a schedule and a lot  more.
We are happy to announce that the El Paso Line Dance Association is  now a
year old. It came about in an effort to bring universal line dance to this
town. 4 Instructors got involved in all the jamborees and workshops they could
get to. A couple of years ago we were several years behind the line dance world
and didn't know step sheets existed or how to use them. We are now doing some
of  the latest dances and have learned more steps in the last 2 years than we
had  used in the past 20 years. Many thanks go out to
Choreographers/Instructors, all  over the country,who took time to show us how sailor steps, coaster
steps etc.  were done . A special thanks to Glenda
Harney/Choreographer/Instructor in  Melbourne, Florida, who first set us on the path to success, without
her none of  this would have been possible. Other choreographers who have made
a difference  for us are: Sylvia Schell, Kathy Brackett, Michael Barr, Lana
Wilson, Jackie  Miranda, Kathy Heller and many, many more. These folks gave
advice freely and  patiently, but most of all they treated us like longtime
friends. Out of our 4  Instructors, 2 have completed Level 1 training offered by
the National Teacher's  Association for Country Western Dance. My husband and I
have started a weekly  workshop under the name Dance On, and Joann and Sonjia
have a weekly class as  well. Some thought this could not be done, but the
best advice I was given was,  offer the best of the best and they will come. It
is working. We are so glad to  be a part of the line dance world, you are the
nicest people to be around. In  closing I would like to say thanks to my fellow
instructors Joann, Sonjia and  Marvin for all their hard work, without them
this challenge would have fallen  apart very quickly. Thanks for reading this.

Hi There, My name  is Paul, and I teach in the UK in Notts &amp; Derbyshire, I do
this full time I  have been instructing since early 1996, I have recently
visited your site to  obtain some scripts and I am very grateful for this.
However it's at this  point where there is a BUT.As we now are aware of the
state of the planet and  how we should all do our bit to save the enviornment.
Would it be possible for  all these choreographers to get their scripts on one
page, and not use half of a  page just for the Title.
I obtained two in particular from Ian R Dunn. both  dances were 32 counts but
he wasted so much space that the script had to occupy  2 pages.
Many thanks, and sorry for the grumble. But I do think that it  would be
better.
Very best Wishes Paul [CHAPPS WESTERN DANCE ]
