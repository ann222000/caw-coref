Rove Was On The Grassy Knoll, Update V
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>I know I'm coming a bit late to the "new" news about the Plame affair
but better late then never. It appears some of the Grand Poo-Bah Idiots
have held a Congressional hearing with all the schizo's spewing their
conspiracy theories: Washington — Revisiting the issue that helped spur
her ouster from Congress three years ago, Rep. Cynthia Mc­Kinney led a
Capitol Hill hearing Friday on whether the Bush administration was
involved in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The eight-hour
hearing, timed to mark the first anniversary of the release of the Sept.
11 commission's report on the attacks, drew dozens of contrarians and
conspiracy theorists who suggest President Bush purposely ignored
warnings or may even have had a hand in the attack — claims participants
said the commission ignored. "The commission's report was not a rush to
judgment, it was a rush to exoneration," said John Judge, a member of
Mc­Kinney's staff and a representative of a Web site dedicated to
raising questions about the Sept. 11 commission's report. Lots of
problems with this one but the main one being those involved in this
sham. What precipitated this hearing is this letter signed by Melvin
Goodman, David MacMichael, Ray McGovern, Col. Patrick Lang, and Vince
Cannistraro...all outspoken critic's of Bush and the war. No bias in
this letter huh? The letter just reeks of hypocrisy and partisanship.
This letter was just the opening salvo against the White House by the
unelected employee's of the CIA who feel as if they are scapegoats. That
they screwed the intelligence up so bad is no matter. They could care
less about Plame, this is the start of their battle. Right Wing Nuthouse
has an excellent biography on these so-called non-partisan critic's:
(I've pasted selected part from his piece, go read the whole thing)
MELVIN GOODMAN: But dig a little deeper and what you find is someone who
worked in a section of the CIA - Soviet Affairs – that got it more
wrong, more often, with the subsequent effect on policy that was nearly
ruinous. When some intelligence reports from that era were declassified
in 2001, it was discovered in a 8 year period between 1978 and 1985 the
CIA consistently overestimated the nuclear threat the Soviets posed.
From 1982 until 1987 CIA estimates regarding Soviet economic strength
were also grossly exaggerated. And in the area of Soviet intentions, we
were virtually blind thanks to this attitude Mr. Goodman describes in an
interview with CNN: I think, in looking back at the work of the CIA,
we’ve seen the exaggeration of the value of clandestine reporting. ... I
think the Cold War would have evolved no differently whether we were
doing clandestine reporting or not—that there were no overwhelming
successes with regard to clandestine reporting. You can’t say that about
satellite photography, and you can’t say that about signals
intelligence. Satellite photography and signals intelligence really gave
us a means of understanding what the Soviets were doing with very scarce
resources in the way of military deployment. Mr. Goodman’s love affair
with satellites and signals intel is admirable except for one small
detail. Both the Senate Intelligence Report on Pre-War Iraq Intelligence
and the 9/11 Commission excoriated the CIA for their lack of human
intel. These two intelligence failures – arguably the biggest failures
since Pearl Harbor – along with missing the fall of the Soviet Union,
would be puzzling except for this statement by Mr. Goodman that reveals
a mindset prevelant at the time in the Soviet Affairs section at CIA
about being able to glean Soviet capabilities from satellite and signals
intel: This was extremely valuable material to all American negotiators
and policymakers who had any interest in arms control whatsoever. ... [I
think this] worked to lessen tensions, because it’s given the United
States a very good idea, at the highest levels, of what is actually in
the Soviet inventory. This was the basis for the “war” the CIA waged
against the Reagan Administration. To be fair, it was a war that raged
across the entire national security establishment; arms control or
military build up? There was a suspicion among the William Casey faction
at the CIA that people like Mr. Goodman were overstating Soviet nuclear
capabilities to push the Administration towards arms control. As we now
know, Casey shared President Reagan’s belief that the whole rotten
edifice would come crashing down if pushed hard enough. Guess who was
right. RAY MCGOVERN To put it bluntly, Ray McGovern is a moonbat. A 30
year man at CIA , McGovern has gone off the deep end on the Iraq war.
Despite not being in the CIA for nearly 15 years, he has taken the hard
left talking points on the reasons for going to war with Iraq and run
with them. In an interview with the Atlanta -Journal, McGovern had this
to say about the lead up to the war: A: We’re trying to spread a little
truth around. I’ve just been watching very, very closely how
intelligence has been abused in the lead up to the Iraq war and, now,
after the war. I fear for what this will mean for a very crucial part of
our government. If the president can’t turn to the CIA for straight
answers, whether he knows it or not, he’s in bad shape. He has nowhere
to turn for a straight answer. He can’t expect [Deputy Defense Secretary
Paul] Wolfowitz or [Defense Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld to tell him,
“Sorry boss, we didn’t think of A or B or C. We thought it would be a
cakewalk.” He’s getting slanted advice from the people running the
policy toward Iraq. Sounds like he’s concerned for the President. Guess
again: Q: Do the American people care that they were misled on Iraq?
Does Congress? The press? A: There’s still a lot of torpor, but there
are two new elements now. No. 1: The men and women who are being killed
every day in Iraq. No. 2: The fact that no one—- not even the press—-
likes to be lied to. I’m an American, and I never thought the president
would lie so often and so demonstrably. Which is it? Is the President
being ill served or is he lying through his teeth? Mr. McGovern also has
this to say about Iraq and al Qaeda: The other main thing, of course,
was the alleged tie between Iraq and al-Qaida. CIA analysts spent a year
and a half poring through each and every report and found none to be
persuasive or reliable. Then [Secretary of State] Colin Powell made his
speech to the United Nations on Feb. 5, where he produced some
cockamamie evidence suggesting that al-Qaida types were roaming around
Iraq with Saddam Hussein. In the period leading up to the war, the
president would say that we have to go after Iraq because of 9/11. That
is the way that the president played on the trauma of 9/11 to persuade
the American people that we couldn’t take a chance on Saddam Hussein.
... McGovern is also a founder of the radical group Veteran Intelligence
Professionals for Sanity (VIP) whose Op-Ed’s, articles, and interviews
have been featured in every far left magazine imaginable and who
demanded in a “ Memorandum to the President ” that Bush fire VP Cheney.
Yup, two moonbats sitting in a tree. Then there is Larry Johnson (the
author of another letter recently): "Larry Johnson, a former CIA agent
and registered Republican, accused Bush of flip-flopping on his promise
to fire anyone at the White House implicated in the leak and said
Americans deserved better. "We deserve people who work in the White
House who are committed to protecting classified information, telling
the truth to the American people, and living by example to the idea that
a country at war with Islamic extremists cannot focus its efforts on
attacking other American citizens who simply tried to tell the truth,"
Johnson said." He claims to be a Republican but has been an outspoken
critic of Bush for quite some time, with plenty of venom....he is a
partisan hack, plain and simple. Who do you think gave this last
Saturday's radio response to President Bush? Yup, Larry Johnson....no
partisanship there huh? Even more interesting is this article he penned
a few months before 9/11: "Judging from news reports and the portrayal
of villains in our popular entertainment, Americans are bedeviled by
fantasies about terrorism. They seem to believe that terrorism is the
greatest threat to the United States and that it is becoming more
widespread and lethal. They are likely to think that the United States
is the most popular target of terrorists. And they almost certainly have
the impression that extremist Islamic groups cause most terrorism. "None
of these beliefs are based in fact. ... While terrorism is not
vanquished, in a world where thousands of nuclear warheads are still
aimed across the continents, terrorism is not the biggest security
challenge confronting the United States, and it should not be portrayed
that way." --Larry C. Johnson, "The Declining Terrorist Threat," New
York Times, July 10, 2001. Johnson, a former CIA officer, was deputy
director of the U.S. State Department's Office of Counterterrorism from
1989 to 1993. A more detailed version of this argument appears here.
Yup, that's right....he was waaaaay wrong on the terrorist threat before
9/11. Just as it appears most of these people were at the CIA. I think
this tells us even more about the direction the CIA was in up to the
point when Bush came into office. The wrong direction. This might also
tell us where the venom and hatred comes from, these agents and the CIA
were told by many that they screwed the pooch so they're pissed. This
Plame non-story comes out and they see a chance to jump on the moonbat
bandwagon, to dig the knife in a little more. These people all have an
agenda, just looking at their papertrail with all the articles they have
written will prove this to anyone but the blind (or the left). This is
starting to smell alot like some rogue agents in the CIA had a
completely idiotic view of world terrorism and was told to change their
thinking. Bush puts in Goss who then sweeps the place clean. An
excellent analysis of this comes from JunkYard Blog back in Nov: Two
senior CIA agents resigned today, amid tales of internicine warfare
gripping the agency. Depending on whom you believe, either President
Bush is engaging in a post-election purge of agents and officials he
deems personally disloyal, or he is bringing a rogue agency to heel by
ridding it of agents who have become cocky freelancers with sinister
designs. I go with the latter, as does Sen. John McCain, who used the
very phrase above--" rogue agency "--to describe the CIA on Meet the
Press this weekend. What follows is this blog's very speculative read of
events surrounding the CIA's role in the war, both against terrorists
and against the Bush administration. Since the inception of the Iraq
war, and really even before, some officials inside some government
agency in a position to know secrets and leak them to a hungry press
have been working a scheme with two apparent purposes. The first purpose
was to oust President Bush by undermining his case for war with Iraq and
his handling of Afghanistan (remember all those leaks to Sy Hersch
during the early phases of the ground war there? Those leaks didn't come
from DoD). The second purpose was to undermine US intelligence generally
and dent our ability to win the larger war--a war that requires the
entire intelligence community's best and brightest to perform at their
peak. Which of these purposes was primary and which was secondary is up
for grabs. To be fair to the CIA, the entire agency is not to blame for
the leaks and underhanded games. The CIA has performed well on the
ground in both Afghanistan and Iraq, where its agents have been on the
front lines and played pivotal battlefield roles. The majority of the
CIA is in all likelihood composed of hard-working and patriotic officers
who only want to do what is right and help America win the war. But
within the CIA there is apparently a cabal, scope unknown, acting in a
rogue fashion entirely outside the agency's mission and against stated
US government policy. They are the leakers and schemers who have been on
a mission to bring down the President. The dimensions of this cabal need
not be very large. It only took a few, maybe as few as a dozen or so,
officers to concoct the Joseph Wilson Africa gambit. It only takes one
or two officers to leak the right secret--war plans prior to the
invasion of Iraq, bleak long-range agency assessments of the war's
progress leaked in the run-up to the election, etc--to the right
reporter to make maximum impact. And it only took one officer and a few
other officers in the upper echelons to author the "Anonymous" books
that castigated Bush admininstration war policy. At most you need a
couple dozen officers for these operations, with perhaps one overseeing
it all from a strategic point of view. Most if not all of the officers
involved will be career types with years of experience. Rookies would
not be in positions to pull off the stunts this group has accomplished
and be able to keep themselves in position as long as they have. The
Bush White House has in all likelihood known about the cabal for some
time, but due to electoral realities was never in a position to act
against it until now. This group had created the Joseph Wilson fiasco,
and when someone either in the White House or allied to it offered up
the feeble but in hindsight reasonable defense of "look, the guy's wife
sent him on that trip," that group was smart to turn things around so
that talk of an independent prosecutor was soon in the air. This group
of evidently very experienced officers had leaked creatively and
intelligently to create an air of futility in the early Afghan campaign,
and then continued to leak with great effect all the up through the
election. The Bush White House obviously feared that such a group could
always have one more secret to leak at the most advantageous moment and
spin it so that it might well decide the election against the President.
In chess terms, the cabal had the President in a perpetual state of
"check" as long as the election was in the future. So the President
waited, and even with the departure of George Tenet he wisely held his
fire. He named Porter Goss, a man with a long record in intelligence and
with a long and trusted relationship with the President, to replace
Tenet. And I believe the plan to move post-election against the rogue
elements within the agency began to take shape then. First, the
President just had to win the election. This is a partisan hackjob and
the spotlight WILL begin to shine on these folks....they just don't
understand the power of the blog. The MSM can't just put a few
soundbites of these idiots up anymore without the blogosphere answering
back . MacRanger puts it well: While every pundit (instant and
otherwise), are speculating that Fitzgerald is looking at what Rove said
and whether or not someone in the agency leaked info, the fact is that
no leak occured. No matter what people are saying, Valerie simply
doesn't fit the bill. I believe, and from what I gather from ears at
"the office", the top of the "tent" is coming off this game, and rather
quickly. The proof of that is the re-emergence of key "ex-CIA ops"
hanging around with Democrats and clogging up the airwaves. Why all this
"increased activity?". Simple, The false Plame Leak was a decoy to throw
the scent off the real culprits in the story, namely the rogue CIA ops
who designed to undermine the War on Terror. Look for even more "leaks"
and "ex-op" appearances to come - trust me on that. He goes on to
highlight the importance of Goss: As noted in this Article from American
Thinker , the CIA is undergoing sweaping changes from Peter Goss,
housecleaning at Langley: "Porter Goss's new broom should also sweep
away: 1) personnel who utterly failed to thwart critical technology
theft by China during the Clinton years; 2) those who constantly
undermine the war on terror; 3) the ones who make a regular habit of
dropping media stinkbombs against the White House. 4) Finally, there is
the faction that supported Saddam Hussein's hold on power, as Joe Wilson
did. It could be a bloodbath, and the Permanent Establishment knows it.
Has Fitzgerald come across an even bigger crime perpetrated by this unit
in the CIA? Or is he now just after a perjury charge? Who knows....But I
have a feeling this is a bit bigger then a perjury investigation now.
And finally, today the WaPo has a article which contain's the usual
amount of conspiracy theories we are familiar with on the left: Attorney
General Alberto R. Gonzales said yesterday that he spoke with White
House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. immediately after learning that
the Justice Department had launched a criminal investigation into the
leak of a CIA operative's identity. But Gonzales, who was White House
counsel at the time, waited 12 hours before officially notifying the
rest of the staff of the inquiry. ... In the New York Times yesterday,
columnist Frank Rich cited news reports from 2003 that when Gonzales was
notified about the investigation on the evening of Monday, Sept. 29,
2003, he waited 12 hours before telling the White House staff about the
inquiry. Official notification to staff is meant to quickly alert anyone
who may have pertinent records to make sure they are preserved and
safeguarded. Asked on CBS's "Face the Nation" about the column, Gonzales
said the Justice Department had informed his office around 8 p.m. and
that White House lawyers said he could wait until the next morning
before notifying the staff. He did not say why he called Card. Yup,
there you have it...even tho the Justice Department said he could wait
till the morning, the fact that he did is enough to believe CONSPIRACY!
They were shredding documents I tell ya. As JustOneMinute has shown,
this inquiry was known quite some time before the official notification:
First, this referral was delivered from Justice to Gonzalez on the
evening of Monday, Sept. 29. However, NBC News reported late on Friday,
Sept 26 that a criminal referral was imminent, and the Sunday, Sept 28
WaPo front-paged the story that broke this case open. Inquiring minds
have wondered why the Justice Dept waited until the evening of the 28th
to tell Gonzalez the obvious, but any criminal conspirators had plenty
of warning. This is getting more interesting as time goes on, but you
know what? Rove will still come out of it clean because he didn't do a
damn thing wrong. The lefty CIA agents and their cronies might not make
it out so clean tho. Previous: Rove Was On The Grassy Knoll, Update IV
