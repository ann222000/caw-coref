Lumpy Diaper Burrito

1 12&quot; flour tortilla
3 eggs
2 Tbsp of baked beans
2 Tbsp cream cheese cubed and at room temp.
1 hot dog cut into disks

Heat up your egg pan with a bit of oil and start browning your hot dog
disks.  Once browned, and your baked beans and eggs and finish
cooking.  In another pan, heat up your tortilla with the cream cheese
on top.  When the scrambled mixture is done, plop it on top of your
tortilla.  Now put the tortilla on a plate and fold it into a diaper
shape.
