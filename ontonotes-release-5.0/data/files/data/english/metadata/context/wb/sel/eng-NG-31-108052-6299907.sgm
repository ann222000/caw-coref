Rob has rebuilt several power supplies for me and they work great.  Plus
he's a real nice guy to deal with!

Or you can always buy Bob's rebuild kit (and the additional transistor
he doesn't put in the kid) and rebuild it yourself

Absolutely!  This is just one option for the collector who doesn't have
the time and or equipment to repair it themselves.

I just thought I'd offer my services in case anyone would like to
reclaim a switcher or restore the originality back to their Robotron,
Defender, Stargate, Sinistar, Joust, Bubbles, etc. :-)

You've got to be joking right?  These things are so easy to fix and the
cost of parts is very cheap.  I'd put the cost of "problematic caps" as
you call them at around $4.00.  By "problematic" I assume you're not
even replacing the large filter cap.  Most of the time the transistors
are the issue on these anyway.  Replacing the caps is just something to
do while you're in there.

So $45 for fixing one huh?  Tell you what, if anyone has one to be
fixed then you can send it to me and I'll fix it at cost.  As a matter
of fact I have 3 spares.  If you want to buy one then drop me a note
and I'll let you have it for the cost of repairs.  Otherwise you can
have one (non-working) for $10.

What is it with people on this forum hijacking other people's for sale
ads?  If you don't like the price of this service, that's fine, simply
move on.

I didn't start this thread so you could sell your old power supply
boards - that's just plain rude.

Every power supply board that I've repaired has been a cap or rectifier
issue.  And yes, the 18kuf cap is replaced with this service.  In my
experience, the MPSA55 transistors hold up remarkably well.

There's no way you can provide the components to re-cap these boards
for $4.00 (every cap w/regulators) and possibly one of the three bridge
rectifiers.  This was a knee jerk and completely uninformed response.

Tell someone how easy these are to fix when they don't have soldering
equipment.  I know plenty of collectors who don't get into the
nitty-gritty of soldering and just like their stuff to be fixed and
work.

Thanks for showing us all how much of a class act you are.

I agree jbuck. People always have a comment and have to stick their
nose in where it don't belong..

People are trying to help out and this is what they get. If people do
not like your price they don't have to use your service or they can
send you an email in private saying they think your price is high and
you can decide to adjust.

Lets face it some people just don't know.  Some people don't have the
skills or the time to do this repair and it is good for those people.
It is different if you were some #ss and did the same to others but you
don't.

Dude - wtf is wrong with someone trying to provide a service for
someone?  There are many people that don't have the time to do it but
have more $$ than time.

I'd love to see you get 25 wms power boards sent to you and your 'I'll
do it at cost.'  Then we will see how you like spending your time
working on other's stuff free.

JB just simply put it out there that he will fix boards for X price -
take it or leave it.

But, since you're offering to do it free (cost of parts) - please - by
all means - post your address and turn around time for all to take
advantage of.

So predictable...

You're welcome by the way.  Oh, and as long as you're thanking the
"profiteers" on RGVAC, you should also extend a warm cozy to our good
friend Art, big dog (arcadechips.com), Andre at AMC Solutions, Matty-t,
Wish-Bringer, Dick M., John O. and the many others that sell boards,
parts and services here.

Oh, and don't forget to give yourself a big pat on the back for fixing
boards for people when you're "in the mood" and the $3,000.00+ you
made from the Berzerk/Frenzy multi-boards.  I'm sure you donated all
that money to your favorite local charity.

Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

Since you obviously haven't figured it out, pcb repair and design of

Nice job of attacking me instead of ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS about

WTF guys... It's a service for crying out loud... easy or not is a
service...
If all this was so easy for everyone we would have the girl scouts
doing our
repairs... Its sicking to see repair guys out there cutting each others
throats...
TAKE WHAT YOU LIKE, LEAVE WHAT YOU DON'T.  Is changing your
oil easy? Yes. And guess what, millions of people pay gear heads to
change it and
get paid for it! Stick in mail, wait a week, boom, working ps...
That's fricken awesome, worry free, convenient, and to me is more

LOL!  I guess the truth hurts no matter how you try and justify it.

Lest I forget how great your skills are and how you feel you have to
try and prove to/show everyone how "smart" you are.  Thank you so very
much for gracing this thread with your omnipotent presence (gag).

It's pretty clear that you have a hard-on for me Spaeth.  Rest assured,

No, that doesn't hurt a bit.

What parts do you replace for your $45 fee, scammer?

The point is, he's not saying what he's actually doing in his 'service',
just quoting a price.

When a newb with little experince is offering a service, don't you think
people should know what's actually going to be done?  We asked about
transistors, and he's talking about the MPSA55's that turn on the SCRs
in an over-voltage condidiont, not the transitors that actually matter
for the proper functioning of the power supply.

After about 30 mins of training in basic soldering, I'd trust a
girl scout to shotgun a williams power supply :)

Don't throw a fit because I offer to help people out.  The purpose of
knowing other collectors is to help each other.  Share common
knowledge.  BS about the hobby.

Having said that, it's perfectly reasonable to charge a fee for fixing
or selling something.  You just shouldn't expect that you're the only
one allowed to do it.  Neither should you expect that someone else
won't provide the same thing for free.  I personally think your offer
is ridiculous for a number of reasons.  That's why I offered to do the
same thing for free.  I've also done a lot of other repairs for free
and sold items to other people at cost.  What's wrong with helpin' a
brother?

I've fixed enough of these power supplies to know that it doesn't cost
$45.  The $4.00 (actual $3.90) is the cost of all caps on that power
supply minus the large filter cap.  I added the total before I
responded.  I don't know why so many people think they require money to
help out a fellow collector.  What next?  I'll answer your arcade
questions for $19.99 a month?  You're obviously not a friend to anyone
here.  You just want to profit from other collectors.  Open up a
storefront but don't complain because I'm willing to help someone
without charging them money.  "That's just plain rude" as you say.

Mark are you for real? Do you really think a tech's time isnt worth at LEAST
$45 a half hour, plus parts?
$45 including parts is a deal - and an example of why I wont do arcade or

industrial controller repair

Of course it doesnt cost $45 to fix one - he would have to be an asshole to
advertise to fix it at cost.  No different than when I fix a TV with a
transistor that cost me $8 and charge $250 - it isnt the cost of the repair
that determines price, it is the perceived value of the repair to the
customer.  We have guys in the TV repair business that think its cute to
charge $35 for an in home estimate (I get $70, the big outfit in Albany gets
$90).  When people call me to ask why I cant match the other guy, I just
tell them to keep my number and call me when the item needs re-repair in a
week or 2 - I convert about 40% of the "well the other guy said $35" calls.

I'm more of one for preventitive maintenance... you know, like brushing your

If I were to need a filling, a DDS on the wall is worth a lot more to me

Honestly,

In this great Country of USA, charge whatever you like. If rebuilding
power supplies is something that someone would rather not do and just
have a working tested supply sent to their home, $45.00 shipped is not
a bad price at all. I don't think anyone wants to do this for $20 as
time is money. Nor would it be worth the time. Everyone has the option
to bargain shop. If they feel it's too high, learn to do it yourself.
Everyone who's talking here is making profit, not loss. If that they
were making loss, then they wouldn't even be here. Sometimes prices are
too high and you have to move on in other directions. I agree with Art.
Charge what you like. If someone doesn't like it, move on. No need on
comments.

John

You forgot to read the whole thread John.  I offered to fix these for
other collectors for free.  That's 0 profit as in "Zero".  That means
no, everyone here does not make a profit off of other collectors.  I
offer to do a lot of things like burning ROM's, printing back door
sheets, etc at cost.  If you live near me and want me to stop by and
help you fix a machine then I'll do that for free.  If you have a
technical question I can answer here then the answer is free.  Simply
put, I'm not trying to gouge money out of everyone.  I'd like to see
more people who help each other out because they're  fellow collectors.
The people who get irate about me offering something free or two
people offering the same product/service are only driven by greed.
Their greed shouldn't dictate what others do.

Long thread made short, if you have a game that's down and you want
your WMS power supply fixed then send JBuck $45 and he'll replace a
bunch of caps for you.  He'll also stick it in his Williams machine and
let it run for 24 hours.  You could also send it to me and I'll fix
what's broken and verify the output quality is good.  I'll also replace
anything else on the PCB that you want at cost.  Choose either option
(or none) that you like.  I'm only making the offer to help other
collectors.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I'd love to see you get 25 wms power boards sent to you and your 'I'll
&gt;&gt; &gt; do it at cost.'  Then we will see how you like spending your time
&gt;&gt; &gt; working on other's stuff free.

&gt;&gt; Not a bad idea - I have 15 or so I can ship out for repair and refurb -
&gt;&gt; anyone else want to join me in swamping this guy?
&gt;&gt; Art

&gt; How about the alternative of sending those to jbuck and paying $45 a
&gt; pop for them?

&gt; If you really want them fixed then drop me an e-mail and we'll work it
&gt; out.

that is a good point - never hurts to scope the outputs to make sure they're

Not everyone that come to this group is a collector. Most collectors
can fix things them selves. Also there are so many people here that are
selling or doing services for a profit and I think this hole thread is
bull.

Todd,

That is very noble of you. It's fun fixing things and getting things
running. I missed your thread before. It's nice to know you're willing
to contribute.That's awsome. If I could help out a fellow collector
near my area, I always try to do so. I pass on some games from time to
time for a great deal too. I think helping someone goes a long way. I
just recently passed on a great deal and offered a Missile Command to a
fellow collector for the cost of a what the pcb goes for. But, I gained
a friendship and it was worth the effort. Kudos to ya.

John

I'm in this business to make $$.

I've made a profit on every product I've made, and every game I've sold.

I don't have the time to do work for someone else for free.  I don't
have time to do work for someone else for $$.

I don't care if someone else makes a profit or not in this business.

We live in a free market.  If the $45 wms ps repair service benefits the
provider and the receiver, then it will probably continue.  If one
side is unsatisfied, then it won't.

There have been times where it is more cost effective for me to repair
something myself.  There are other times where it is more cost effective
to pay someone else to fix it, even though I'm more than capable.

Correction:

I've made $$ on every game I've sold except a Pole Position II.  Bought
it for $300, cleaned it up, and sold it for $200, tired of the PP headaches.

Free Enterprise, That's what it is called in the free world. If he is
fixing them for $45 or $450 who cares? If I need it bad enough then I
will pay it. If someone comes in and says they will fix it for free,
then great send thousands to him, let see how long he does it. If
someone can't put in a rebuild kit then he can buy a rebuilt unit. I
don't see the problem. Many guys here have profited from this "Hobby"
more power to them. But don't price gouge. But for $45 it isn't bad.
How much do you pay for some mechanic to look at your car and tell you
that it needs a new "ass grappler grommet" and you get the $250 bill.
The part is only $5. The rest is labour. Is that fine to do? Just
because a car is bigger? More important? Take your PC to a store and
have them reload it for you how much did that cost? And there are NO
PARTS involved. But them main point is, just get along everyone and if
someones price is too high, then just don't buy from him. And if you
advertise a service for $45, and someone says they can do it for less,
then be prepared for it. Someone will always do that to you.
