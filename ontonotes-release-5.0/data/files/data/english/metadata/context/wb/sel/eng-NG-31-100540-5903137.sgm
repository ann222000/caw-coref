Where exactly is the reset button for the fuel pump in this particular
vehicle?...A friend of mine recently filled up his gas tank and then
after driving about 3 blocks had to lock his brakes up and now the car
won`t turn over..I know some of them had some sort of emergency cutoff
thing for the fuel pump and in most cases it was in the trunk...But we
nosed around in there and saw nothing..He lost the owners manual..Thanks

Then take your lazy ass somewhere else and figure out where the
non-existant button is.

Thanks to the two nice guys who answered my question directly....That`s
what these groups are for and I`m sure one day you will need info on a
subject you aren`t up on and will go to the appropriate board seeking
answers and it`s nice to get what you want....To the one sarcastic
guy..Bite me :-)
