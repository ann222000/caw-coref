It wasn't Seamus' fault. Not really. It only happened because he was supposed to be testing a new Deep Sleep spell for Charms class, but he'd forgotten to do it before bedtime, so he wound up waking up when Harry had one of his nightmares.&lt;p&gt;
Although it probably was his fault that he'd forgotten to do the spell, what with being three sheets to the wind last night after Gryffindor's &quot;Not Dead-Last For the Quidditch Cup&quot; party. Or, as Dean had called it, Gryffindor's &quot;Congratulating the Seeker Who Beat Our Seeker Because His Own House Can't Be Arsed To&quot; party.&lt;p&gt;
The party that was probably also the reason Draco had forgotten to fully close the curtains around his and Harry's bed. Or set privacy wards.
