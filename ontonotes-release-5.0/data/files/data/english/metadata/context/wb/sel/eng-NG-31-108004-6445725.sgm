For the last month or so, stitching has been very difficult. Can't really
see the chart or the piece, especially at the same time. Was getting
headaches reading too.

Well, the other day, I took a good look at my glasses. The anti-glare
coating was all fogged. Visited the place I bought them and they are
replacing the lenses for free. I have my old glasses on now - very nearly
the same Rx, so no worries about getting around and I can actually stitch.

I expect I actually need to upgrade and get readers....

Actually, I've been fighting the bifocals/separate readers &amp; close work pair

in on this issue.
The best way to describe the way the lenses looked was fogged, as if I'd

&gt; I'm glad the shop is doing right by you.  I had to have one of the bows on

&gt; They couldn't do it for free because I didn't get my glasses there but they

I am reasonably happy with these guys. They are part of the practice I use

Glad you can see again.  Something about so many of the glasses wearers I
know - the ignoring either really dirty or damaaged lenses - or maybe it's
time to get a check-up!  Girl - take care of yourself, eh!

Readers - as a friend of mine said when in Optometry school - pretty much
you can tell someone is 40 because that's when they need readers. Evidently
for most people that is the age when the shape of your eyeball changes (I
guess the viscosity of the vitrous humor changes or the muscles that help
maintain shape show age - don't know which it really is) and an amazingly
large, significant portion of the population need to get reading glasses
just around age 40.

DH is finally admitting that he probably needs readers, bifocals or maybe
trifocals.  He can't read if he has his contacts in, and just looks under or
over his regular glasses at this point.

You might be able to just get some clip on things for your regular glasses -
else ---bifocals.  Good luck - and glad you can see again.

Awww www...I had bifocals from age 12 to age 19 (or something like that,
I can't really remember when I got them).  Anyway, the eye doc took them
away from me when I was 19 and I've missed them for 20 years.

So last fall I went and begged my eye doc for bifocals again because I
was doing so MUCH stitching.  (My begging had gone unanswered for years
because, "You don't need them.")  Anyway, when I told him how much
stitching I was doing, he gave them back to me.  I can't tell you how
much difference they make in eye strain.

If you get the ones that don't have the line (smooth transition lenses
or something like that), you don't really notice you have bifocals but
your eyeballs are grateful.

PS...Speaking of eyeballs, I had to scrap the Eye of God chart I'm
working on and start over again.  :/

.My dd got those antiglare lenses one time - they were absolutely the
worst glasses she has had!  They scratched when you said "boo" at
them.  We had to replace them after six months, even though her
prescription was OK, because the lenses were in such bad shape.  The
new eye place we went to said the *never* give antiglare lenses to
kids for just that reason - they don't take good enough care of their
glasses and they wind up looking like they've been smeared in a month
or two.

I've been wearing anti-glare glasses for years and because I'm nearsighted
and only need glasses for distance I'm always taking them off, or moving
them up to read and putting them back on to see what's ahead.    And of
course I usually plop them down on whatever's handy so I don't think you
could describe me as being careful.  I have every pair of sunglasses coated
and fortunately have never had a problem.

I did have one pair of sunglasses start to bubble and peel, but that was
apparently a manufacturers defect and the optical place replaced them for
me.

Dh has the high index, super-light glasses.  Actually he has some of those
hingeless titanium (read this expensive) frames from Silhouette - you pick
the color, the lens shape and then the opticians make them - pretty sweet -
totally rimless.  And they have the anti-glare coating - since he's in an
office all day, and spending much time in front of a computer - it's worth
it.  Anyhow - he has had no problems with the coating scratching, or wearing
off.  Only on his glasses that are about 4 years old, and the dog played
with - that he insists on not tossing - regardless of the presecription.
With those, there is some sections that you can see the coating or something
has come off.

We have a good friend that is an optician - she did his glasses.  I can ask
her - I know that she takes good care of him, and their clients (they do a
lot of serious vision correction work).  And, of course, she's a hockey ref
(runs the SE District Women's Officiating Program for USAH).

&gt; Mine did too.  It's been quite funny the past few months.  I'm
&gt; near-sighted and always have been since he's known me.  I only wear
&gt; glasses for driving, as I always found walking with my glasses on more
&gt; detrimental than squinting to see (yeah, I am a clutz to begin with).
&gt; So our conversations over the years have been (typical fishing trip):
&gt; Him:  Is that a deer or moose up on shore?
&gt; Me:  Where?
&gt; Him: Shore?
&gt; Me:  Shore?  That would be where the blue bottom meets the green
&gt; middle?
&gt; Him:  No, Shore?  Is that a deer or moose up on shore?
&gt; Me:  &lt;Pointing about 50 feet out&gt; I can barely make out that's rock at
&gt; that distance, and you want ME to tell you what's on shore?
&gt; Him:  That's a seagull on a floating log...never mind.

&gt; But my close vision is still great.  My Blackberry is set to smallest
&gt; font so I can see more text on the screen.  I forget he's losing his
&gt; reading vision and will hand it to him to read something. He'll just
&gt; hand it back to me and say &quot;Shore?&quot;.

&gt; He finally got tested in January, and the doc said just to buy the off
&gt; the rack reading glasses (same in both eyes).  I bought him a fairly
&gt; nice pair for Valentine's Day, and he's wondering why he never did
&gt; this sooner.

&gt; I think a trip to the dollar store and another few pairs might be in
&gt; order.  Then he can keep a pair in my purse, his van. etc.  He's not
&gt; yet used to carrying them around with him.

&gt; Tara
">

It's possible he may never get used to carrying them with him.  My husband
never did.  He just had about 8 pair and stashed them all over the place.
The he got annoyed because I'm nearsighted and he couldn't borrow my glasses
to read a menu.

I have the same problem with distance and here in the relentless Florida sun

Every so often someone screams and I really need to clear up the blob on the

me knows who was either murdered or was the murderer.  They're also
necessary when I watch something like Project Runway so I can actually see
the fashions that are being created.

I have these also and really really like them.  My first pair I got
the lenses too small.  I ended up with some problems as my
prescription changed a bit.  I thought I'd have to get a whole new
pair - not so.  I got new larger lenses with the new prescription and
they used the same frames which saved me a lot of money.

&gt;&gt; DH is finally admitting that he probably needs readers, bifocals or maybe
&gt;&gt; trifocals.

&gt; Mine did too.  It's been quite funny the past few months.  I'm
&gt; near-sighted and always have been since he's known me.  I only wear
&gt; glasses for driving, as I always found walking with my glasses on more
&gt; detrimental than squinting to see (yeah, I am a clutz to begin with).
&gt; So our conversations over the years have been (typical fishing trip):
&gt; Him:  Is that a deer or moose up on shore?
&gt; Me:  Where?
&gt; Him: Shore?
&gt; Me:  Shore?  That would be where the blue bottom meets the green
&gt; middle?
&gt; Him:  No, Shore?  Is that a deer or moose up on shore?
&gt; Me:  &lt;Pointing about 50 feet out&gt; I can barely make out that's rock at
&gt; that distance, and you want ME to tell you what's on shore?
&gt; Him:  That's a seagull on a floating log...never mind.
">

LOL - I totally understand this conversation.  DH has always worn glasses -
well since high school I imagine.  He's got a pretty significant
prescription.  I, OTOH, have been 20/20 since I was 5, except for about 18
months in college.  Consequently - I think when I'm having any difficulty
that I must need glasses.  DH and my ophthmalogist think I'm spoiled and
nuts.  Evidently my vision had actually been more like 20/15, so now that
it's barely 20/25 I'm paranoic.  But, I do definitely need readers for fine
print and stitching.  At first, they were slighlty different as in 1.20/1.40
diopters - so I got really nice prescription ones, and a cheaper set from
COSTCO.  The dog ate the nice ones.

We have conversations that go "hon - what does that say - I don't have my
readers" - him: "you know I can't read anything with my contacts in"  or him
" what does the playbill say" - me " do you see my purse - cause that's
where my readers are - in the car"

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But my close vision is still great.  My Blackberry is set to smallest
&gt; font so I can see more text on the screen.  I forget he's losing his
&gt; reading vision and will hand it to him to read something. He'll just
&gt; hand it back to me and say &quot;Shore?&quot;.
">

DH has been like that - but the fact that he's starting to struggle a little
is certainly hitting the vanity point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He finally got tested in January, and the doc said just to buy the off
&gt; the rack reading glasses (same in both eyes).  I bought him a fairly
&gt; nice pair for Valentine's Day, and he's wondering why he never did
&gt; this sooner.
">

Yup.  I actually got 2 sets of 3-packs at COSTCO - one at 1.25 &amp; the other
at 1.50, and then DH swapped them around so that I had 3 sets to leave
around.  Then as my vision "worsened" the doctor said to just buy 1.50 off
the rack.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think a trip to the dollar store and another few pairs might be in
&gt; order.  Then he can keep a pair in my purse, his van. etc.  He's not
&gt; yet used to carrying them around with him.

It's a good thing to do. The only thing - just be sure that one pair has
real optical quality lenses for any serious reading, etc.

&gt;&gt; With those, there is some sections that you can see the coating or something

&gt;&gt; We have a good friend that is an optician - she did his glasses.  I can ask

&gt;&gt; lot of serious vision correction work).  And, of course, she's a hockey ref
&gt;&gt; (runs the SE District Women's Officiating Program for USAH).

&gt; We're assuming the lab did a bad job that day.

&gt; Funny - I didn't like the Silhouettes - they didn't feel right some how. And
&gt; out of the price range.

He tried on a lot of them, and liked the lightness - but he was also able to
try several diffent lens shapes, and I think a couple of different bridges
til he picked.  It definitely helped getting a big discount from our friend
- though still really pricey.

I had them several years ago and they didn't hold up for me at all.  I think
probably because I'm nearsighted and I'm constantly taking them off and
putting them back.  I'm not terribly careful and usually just grab one ear
piece and I guess they just didnl' like that kind of rough handling.  The
screws loosened up to the point where they were tightened so many times that
they got stripped.

&gt; That would be the pair I bought him for VD (optical quality).  I think
&gt; I'll pick him up some dollar store pairs this week to have handy
&gt; elsewhere.  He's had them less than a week and I've already heard &quot;I
&gt; wish I'd brought my glasses&quot; nearly a dozen times.  So it seems he's
&gt; not that vain, just untrained (to carry them with you). :-)

Those are really nice (but I bet someone says something about not attaching

&gt; A binary was posted in order to show some glasses.   On a text only

This is not true.
Old posts fall off news servers whenever any message is posted. More old
posts than normal fall off if a binary is posted. No one's new messages were
dumped or prevented from being posted because cocoa made a mistake and
posted a picture.
