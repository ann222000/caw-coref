Hi again folks,

Sorry again for the delay in the weekly update.  I guess I'm not all that good at concentrating on my intended tasks right after I've gotten a new technological toy.  So it goes, I'm afraid; I just wouldn't be the same without my nerdery.

&quot;Computer Classes for Kids&quot;

I came home from my meeting in Bangkok to a bad thing and a good thing.  The bad thing is that my gas stovetop has gone a little wacky.  Instead of creating a nice calm inch-tall blue flame that barely caresses the bottoms of the pots and pans, my stove is now sputtering out these half-foot flares that are completely licking around the outside of my tea kettle.  It no longer seems reasonable to try cooking anything in a wok on the flame.  Fortunately, it's easy enough to tell the landlord about the problem (I just took pictures of the flames and showed them to him), but that doesn't necessarily mean the thing will be fixed anytime quickly.

Ah well; there are other ways of making myself food beside using the wok.  Jai yen yen (be cool...).

The good thing I found upon my return has a bit less of a direct effect on me, though it's great for other volunteers.  Wilpen Gorr, my main IT professor in grad school, was kind enough to gather some workbooks on using Dreamweaver from his students.  His main large lecture class teaches how to make databases in Access and websites in Dreamweaver, and the weekly labs involve these fairly simple workbooks.  Once you know how to use the programs, the workbooks are no longer all that particularly useful, so I asked him to ask his students if I could have their workbooks to share with other volunteers.  The result: three workbooks to put into the volunteer resource library here.  I'm thrilled that I was able to use one of my contacts for something so inherently useful for so many volunteers (both current volunteers, and the ones to come).

Other than coming into the office and discovering the workbooks from Wil, though, my Monday morning was fairly nondescript.  I brought my laptop into the office and spent a fair amount of the morning getting the updates that I was unable to get while I was traveling to Bangkok.  And yet, I wasn't being completely unproductive; I also spent some of my internet time trying to come up with something extra to use for my computer classes.

Yep, I taught my first computer class later that day.  And while it didn't necessarily go perfectly, I think it went pretty well.

After spending the previous week pondering what to teach, I finally decided on a lesson I call (to myself) &quot;fantastic fonts.&quot;  The lesson is fairly simple, overall: I have the kids start up Word, type up a few sentences, and then methodically work through all of the font-altering buttons.  I start with size, so that they can make the words larger (and thus easier to see the differences), then I have the kids play with the font styles (which can be tricky when the words are in Thai; only a third of the fonts on their computers are Thai fonts) and show them what the Bold, Italics, and Underline buttons do.  And then, since the buttons are right there anyway, I cover the left-, center-, and right-justifications.  Finally, since there's always some advanced kid in the class who insists on changing the colors of his text anyway, I cover that text color and highlight color buttons.

From that point, I move away from fonts, and show them the copy, paste, and cut functions.  It's hard to be sure if they really understood the difference between copying and cutting, since I'm not at all able to talk it out in Thai (theoretically my co-teachers can, but that depends on them understanding the difference too).  But anyway, after I've at least shown them the functions in Word, I have the kids open up PowerPoint and use the paste function there, to demonstrate that something copied from one program can have an effect in another.  Once in PowerPoint, I have them use the same font functions, to try pushing across the idea that these are common things for programs to use.

Finally, as a last step, I have the kids close up Powerpoint, go back to Word, and open up a file that I put on all of the computers (which is itself a mini-lesson for the kids in moving around computer files).  The file is something that I found online on Monday morning: a simple Thai children's story (think Aesop's fable kind of thing) where I was able to take the Thai text and strip it of any exceptional style.  I tell the kids to make the text as pretty as possible, and then just sit back and watch for the last ten minutes of class.

All in all, I think it's a pretty good lesson for something I created largely on the fly.

But having a decent lesson isn't necessarily good enough.  I actually got off to a bit of a rough start at that first school.  The teachers there who I had met before weren't around, having been sent off on some workshop or something.  The one (and ONLY) teacher who I could track down hadn't really known anything about the project, except that it was her impression I was to come to the school on Tuesday.*

I explained my need for a co-teacher, thinking that I was going to have to give up on teaching that day.  Somehow, though, and the school staff made it work for me, coming up with a helper just as I was about to leave.  Even with help, however, I feel like that first day went a little less well than I would have hoped.  It was hard to demonstrate things at the school--the teaching monitor is on the opposite side of the room from the computer it's attached to, and the clarity is lousy.  I'm thinking I might be better off trying to abandon the monitor altogether and just work with the students one computer at a time.

Still, with my first class under my belt, I was able to have a pretty good conversation that evening with a more experienced CBOD (my program) volunteer, who mentioned doing computer classes when she came to our second training.  Her name, if you can believe it, is Pamela Anderson; she looks absolutely nothing like the Baywatch star, though.  Pam used to be some high-stress manager, but here she's spent most of her time teaching English and computer classes.  In fact, Peace Corps just sent out copies of a fabulous CD from her the has all of the stuff she's used for her English classes, and a lot of the stuff can be useful for computer classes as well.  Talking to her, though, was key in helping my gears get in motion thinking about future classes.  I'm still not one for formal lesson plans in advance, but I shouldn't have as much trouble coming up with my general lesson idea in the future.

*To skip back a little, now that I've reached the end of the day: there was a bit of a scheduling snafu.  I had written down the days when I intended to teach at each school, Monday through Friday, and gave the schedule to the Rong Nyoke so that the AwBawTaw secretary could send a letter to the school.  I even made a point of hand-writing in the days in Thai to make it clear.  I had mistyped my starting date as the 7th, however, and the secretary somehow extrapolated that out to mean that I would be teaching Tuesdays through Saturdays.  (I can guess at how I could mistype the day, given the Thai calendars run mostly Monday through Sunday instead of the America Sunday through Saturday, but I really don't know how the secretary could have thought I'd be ABLE to teach at a school on a Saturday.)  Comically enough, the Thais kept trying to insist that I wanted to use the new semi-nonsensical schedule, even as I tried pointing at what I had written down.  I finally won the
argument simply by going to the schools when I had originally intended.

&quot;M&amp;Ms Are Excellent Packing Material&quot;

Theoretically speaking, I'm supposed to spend Tuesdays and Thursdays out and about in the tambon, with little more than a &quot;checking in to say hello&quot; kind of visit to the AwBawTaw.  My Rong Nyoke, in fact, agreed during the counterpart conference that I should spend two days per week going around and meeting people.  He doesn't really have time to take me around and introduce me to folks (which is his conception of the thing), but we are in agreement as to the basic theory that I shouldn't just sit around the AwBawTaw all the time.

In practice, though, I don't think I've managed to go out on Tuesdays YET, and I'm still working on getting past the general mental block about at least stopping by the AwBawTaw, even when I think it shouldn't be necessary.  This past Tuesday, though, the simple act of going to the AwBawTaw was enough to convince me that it wasn't a very good day for randomly biking around.  In fact, the morning was so hot (just by 9 AM), that I was utterly dripping with sweat by the time I had biked the lone mile to the office.  I went inside and collapsed in the air conditioning (which they usually don't turn on nearly so early in the day), and it was a lost cause to consider going back out again before my class in the afternoon.

Even though it was kind of a change of plans for me, I was still able to keep myself busy at least.  I was so intent on my reading (in the air-conditioning) that it took me several hours to look in on my regular office and realized that my desk had been moved.  It's probably a move for the better, too--when the doors are open now (i.e., when the air conditioner isn't running), I'll been in the direct line of sight of anyone visiting the AwBawTaw's administrative jaonatee.

Thankfully, the weather seemed a bit less unbearable by the time I went off for my computer class.  This class seemed to go a little bit better than the one on Monday, and I'm not sure if there's a single clear reason, or if I simply had an easier time because it was my second class on the same material.

I mean, there were definitely things that COULD have caused an easier class for me.  The teacher who I had been introduced to before (presumably the guy who was in charge of computers otherwise) was available to help out, though he was no more able to do pre-class prep than at the first school (I think I may have to drop that idea entirely, or else start planning ahead enough to be able to do it a week in advance after the previous class).  The teaching monitor situation was also less of an issue, since this school's monitor is attached to the front computer instead of the back one.  I also took one of Pam's suggestions and turned the final part of the lesson (free-form changing of the Thai story) into a contest to see what group could make the story look prettiest (notably, this did not necessarily involve making it more legible).  The prize was one of my random packs of candy (cheap enough to provide), and the kids were thrilled.

So yeah, somewhere in there, I ended up with a much better-seeming class.  Hurray for that!

Afterwards, it wasn't quite 4PM, so I decided to go back to the AwBawTaw.  It was a good thing I did so: there was an unexpected box of goodies from my maternal grandparents waiting for me.  They packed a bunched of the in-depth bible study books (mostly written by William Barclay), which I tend to find are excellent reading.  My mother had previously sent me one of the books, covering the gospel according to Mark, and my grandparents sent me the others, as well as a few other books of interest (like a sudoku book).

One of the most charming parts of the package, though, was that they used M&amp;Ms and Sunmaid dried fruits as packing materials (with a top layer of paper, just in case someone decided to peak inside the box).  I can only hope that I'll be able to meet up with other volunteers and share some of the bounty before I devour it all myself.

&quot;Closed for Sports Day&quot;

I spent most of the day on Wednesday just out in the AwBawTaw, feeling slightly off, physically.  I basically just stayed in the air-conditioning the whole morning.  I did a little bit of Thai reading, but my minor headache made catching up on general reading (from Newsweek and whatnot) seem a whole lot more attractive.

I also spent a fair amount of time throughout the week reading through &quot;Culture Shock: Thailand.&quot;  For those of you who are considering visiting Thailand eventually, I heartily encourage you to check out the book from your library before doing so.  It's a nice little guide for those people who don't start off their time in the country with a ten week training on the ways of the locals.  Heck, even with all the Peace Corps training (which gets discounted in my mind, since a lot of it is &quot;wait and observe and learn how to guess&quot;) and the seven months of living in the country, the book still had a few minor new ideas to present to me.  There's some small hope now that when I get invited to my first local wedding (point of interest: the weeks just after the end of Buddhist Lent are a popular time for it), I might actually understand some of what's going on.

Meanwhile, I was periodically pulling my head out of my various reading materials to chat with the jaonatee throughout the day.  They kept telling me about the sports day activities that were happening at 3 o'clock, and I replied that I would be along as soon as I finished teaching my computer class at 4:00 (the Wednesday school is the closest to my house, so biking somewhere else afterwards was no big deal).  This was a conversation repeated multiple times with several people, and each of them just said something to the effect of &quot;okay, see you there.&quot;

Imagine my dismay, though, when I biked over to the school and found it deserted.  There were neither teachers nor students in evidence, other than three kids playing on the playground (and not in their school uniforms).  I asked the kids (in reasonably decent Thai) where everyone was, and they just kind of stared at me.  I tried it in English, just in case they would except that better from me, but still no response.  Slightly exasperated, I went home to drop off my computer, take a couple tylenol, and change shirts* before biking off to sports day, about five kilometers away.

*The shirt I put on was actually given to me by the AwBawTaw.  It's a nice shade of blue, and kind of a mix between a sports jersey and a polo shirt.  My favorite part about it, though, is the back.  The team name, AwBawTaw Chiang Rang, is written in Thai in the familiar arch such things tend to have on the back of jerseys.  Then, since I didn't have a team number, it has the word &quot;STAFF&quot; written in nice clean bold ENGLISH block letters.  I really rather hope that the shirt lasts long enough for me to bring it home as a souvenir eventually; it just cracks me up a little.

Anyway, when I got to the district office, where the &quot;sports day&quot; activities (volleyball and soccer, being played from 3:30 until presumably sunset) were being set up, I found my coworkers (also in the blue jersey/polos, so of which with numbers) and told them about the school being closed.  These fine people who had so casually accepted my plans throughout the day didn't even blink at hearing my problems: &quot;of course the school was closed; it's a 'wan yut' [holiday] for them.&quot;  And why is it a holiday?  &quot;Because it's sports day.&quot;

At this point, I was directed toward the small cheering section of 10-year-old girls waiting for the volleyball match to start.  Yeah, the kids weren't actually PLAYING at all (nor were very many teachers, that I could tell), but they by-golly got out of school to go show their Chiang Rang spirit.  It would almost work in my head, except I can't help but note that there are a LOT more kids of the appropriate age to have been able to come than the mere 15 students.

Even so, I have to admit that having the loudest cheering section for our volleyball team seemed like a nice psychological boost.  I wasn't even playing, and I felt a small boost in morale.  I even managed to let go of most of my annoyance with the lack of cancellation notice.  It probably helped that our team won.

The volleyball team, it should be noted, was all women (about half made of the jaonatee and half made of women who I didn't recognize at all), while the soccer team was all men (most of whom I recognized as council members).  The two teams were playing at completely different times, so there was no need to split our little cheering section apart, and the men were able to watch most of the volleyball match.  The women, alas, did not return the favor; many of them left right after establishing their victory.

I can't really hold that against them, though.  I left before our round of soccer started as well, having decided that my headache really wasn't putting me in a proper mood for sitting around watching sports (and certainly not to join in, though I was repeatedly offered the opportunity).  I actually found myself texting a complaint to another volunteer that I was forced to endure the activities without alcohol (what with it being Buddhist Lent, they don't pass it out as regularly).  This is actually a double-first for me, since I don't usually feel the need to drink when watching sports (though, to be fair, I don't watch sports too regularly outside of the championship games), and I don't remember ever before finding myself wishing for unavailable alcohol here.

But fortunately, I was able to leave with fairly decent grace after the end of the volleyball game, so I didn't have to endure the tedium of the soccer sidelines as well.  Whenever the next sports day comes along, it will be all too soon for my tastes.

&quot;Fruit Picking&quot;

Unlike Tuesday, I made a point of leaving the AwBawTaw on Thursday morning to go meet folks in the community.  It was a little easier to convince myself to do, since I've scheduled myself to be at the furthest village (and specifically, its animai) at 1:30, and that means I need a way to avoid (politely) being included in the AwBawTaw lunch count.  I'm sure I could simply try to explain my time-table to the jaonatee, but as Thais, they're probably not going to understand my western desire to stick so closely to a schedule.  All in all, it was just easiest to follow my natural inclination and bike out into the community.

On a whim (albeit a somewhat unending one), I opted to bike down the back roads again, and simply talk to whoever I might come across.  And unlike my last attempt at doing that (maybe as far back as June? golly...), I actually had some good IRBing luck this time.

About 2 or 3 kilometers out (which can seem a bit far when you're biking slowly along a dirt road you don't know), I met a family that was hanging out in the shade between bouts of fruit picking.  Their orchard (and apparently most all of the other orchards I see around my place) grows a fruit called lamyai (or something that sounds kind of like that), a small (cherry-sized, or slightly larger) yellow fruit with a brittle skin and white flesh surrounding a hard black seed.  And I can't help but think, as I type up that description of the fruit, that it's remarkably easy to buy into the idea of evolution, considering how very many other fruits here seem to have similar descriptions....

Anyway, after hanging out with the family in the shade for a few minutes, they decided it was time to get back to work.  This wasn't a brush-off, thankfully--they actually invited me to come along and watch them at work (as part of my introduction with the farmers, I tend to say that I'm interested in learning about Thai farming).  Rather than just standing around watching, I sat down and joined in.

The way it worked was basically that some third guy was trimming fruit-laiden branches from the trees and dumping them in a pile in front of the couple and I.  Each branch could have anywhere from just one decent fruit to 6 or 8, and we would pick those off and put them into buckets.  When the buckets were full, we poured them into large bags for eventual transportation.  Between the three of us, we ended up working at almost exactly the same rate as the one guy who was grabbing the branches en masse.

This wasn't a hushed high-concentration work zone by any means.  As we were picking the fruits, I had a slightly extended version of the standard where-am-I-from conversation with the couple, and in return, I inquired about their livelihood and what happens to the fruit.  At the time, my best understanding of it was that the fruit were to be taken to the AwBawTaw and then exported to China.  [More on that in Friday's entry.]  When not picking langyai, the couple apparently grows corn, which led me to share with them about the cornfields of Indiana.  It wasn't exactly a detailed description, mind you; about all I could think how to say is that there's a lot of cornfields, and we only get to use them for one season per year.

But anyway, that bout of IRBing lasted about an hour or so, and it was a pretty nice way of passing the time.  But I had to get going to the animai, so I bid the couple farewell after we finished up the last pre-lunch batch of picking.  (I don't expect to run into them again with any regularity, but at least I've left them with a strong impression that I'm 'jai dii', or good-hearted.)  With fingers firmly crossed, I made my way back toward the main highway by means of a different dirt road (it worked out just fine), and I started pushing toward the animai.

But then, before I had even gone a single kilometer on the main road, I got flagged off it by a couple of old guys eating lunch at one of the many roadside shelters.  I had some time to spare, so I went over and joined them.  This, of course, led them to offer me some of their food.

Now, this was a fairly predictable scenario; if your timing is good enough, it's almost always theoretically possible to get free food from the rural Thais.  Nevertheless, I had made a point of packing a pair of peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches before I left home in the morning, and I was not to be dissuaded from eating them.  Also, the men were eating glass noodles, which I find are almost always either surprisingly spicy or else covered in fish sauce.  Either way, I rank them lower than a nice PB&amp;J sandwich, as do the other volunteers to whom I've related this story (and not just fish-adverse folks either).

Strangely enough, the men themselves stopped eating the glass noodles after I saw down as well.  In retrospect, I wonder if I missed some cultural clue along the way or what; I prefer to think that they were simply opting to focus squarely on me for a while.  And as egotistical as that might sound, it's not terribly implausible, given that another half-dozen men came and gathered around while I was sitting there eating my sandwiches.  I ended up having the standard conversation in a pseudo-interrogation style, surrounded by strangers.  I'm sure they didn't mean for it to come across that way, though; it was simply what I was feeling in being surrounded by people who had nothing better to do than ask me questions and watch me eat.

Continuing on toward the animai afterwards, the recent dry(-ish) spell allowed me the rare treat of taking the back road to go there as well.  I like doing it just for the change in scenery and the reduction in the number of cars whizzing by me at high speeds, but my bike's odometer provided an alternative justification as well: taking the dirt road is about 25% shorter than the main road.

When I actually reached the animai (slightly early for my scheduled 1:30 visit), it turned out that the worker who originally led me to pledge to help teach them computers wasn't going to be around.  But that was beside the point, since the computers themselves were also down.  Having nothing better to do to pass the time until I was supposed to stop by the village's elementary school (the one where I'm supposed to teach a teacher rather than a class of students), I just hung out for a while. (Joe called while the animai staff were otherwise occupied, which helped pass some time).

As I was preparing to leave, the &quot;doctor&quot; of the animai told me that there was some kind of gathering of all of the district's animai volunteers (the people who actually spread health news in the villages) at the nearby waterfall.  She invited me to come along, going so far as to write down my phone number and everything, but then she kind of backed away from the offer by saying she might not go herself, and that if she decided she was too tired to attend, she simply wouldn't call me.  I, subsequently, never got a phone call, so I'm kind of left wondering what was the point of mentioning it in the first place.  (It's just as well, since I was pretty tired myself by the end of the day from all the biking I did.)

So then I went to the school at the appropriate time, whereupon I found that the principal (the only one there who I've ever spoken with) was gone on some kind of conference or something.  The teacher I ran into, meanwhile, promptly started setting up the television monitor in his classroom to attach it to his computer.  Apparently he was expecting me to teach about computers to a dozen kids using just the one machine.  I don't believe any amount of teaching practice will get me to the point of being able to make a meaningful lesson in a scenario where none of the kids have the chance to interact with the computer.

And so, in as face-saving a manner as I could do, I quickly and quietly explained the whole &quot;1 machine for every 2 kids&quot; thing to the teacher.  Once he understood, he was pretty cool about simply sitting down with me to see what all I had been teaching at the other schools.  In as much as it's the best I could do by this school, I'm still not convinced that it helps or is in any way sustainable.

Oh well; if nothing else, I'll be building up a relationship with another teacher.  Surely that's going to be worth SOMETHING in the long run.

&quot;Fruit Sorting&quot;

Friday was once again a bring-my-laptop-to-work day, ostensibly for my weekly updates.  What I ended up spending most of the day doing, though, was working my way through the list from wikipedia of some 50+ wiki farms.  I actually made some amazing progress, as it turns out.  I managed to do a brief check on all but the last seven or so on the list, and pared down the ones that I checked into a shortlist of maybe half a dozen plausible candidates.  And even that will be easy to trim down further, just as soon as I can reach a conclusion on issues of password protection, site size, and how much we might be willing to pay for such a site (if any money at all).  So yay for progress!

But why, you ask, did I stop short of those last few?  Well, I had to stop short to go do my computer class at the final elementary school.  At least, I had to stop and pack everything up and bike over to the school (thankfully not very far away) and wander around until I could find a teacher and get told that the (then upcoming) Monday holiday somehow meant that I couldn't do anything with the kids on Friday afternoon.  I'm sure the explanation is perfectly reasonable (well, there's at least a chance that the explanation is reasonable), but I couldn't really understand what they were telling me beyond the simple fact that my trip over to the school was somewhat of a waste of time.

The upshot of having to bike back to the AwBawTaw was that I had the opportunity to check out the activities going on in the main meeting building.  I had largely ignored them before, since I had been focused on my computer up until the minute that I rushed off to teach.  What I had seen hadn't really excited me, either; I saw some trucks and contraptions that, in my rush, looked to me like they were making floats for a parade for the Queen's birthday.  In Thailand, after all, few people seem to plan far in advance with their floats, and just about any holiday (or even just the addition of a few more Buddhas at a wat) suffices as a reason to have a parade.

This is all well and good, except that on closer inspection, my first glance was completely wrong.  The trucks were all apparently there after being used to transport bags upon bags of the langyai fruits to the AwBawTaw.  The random machinery that had been brought to the building was actually designed to sort out the fruit by size.

The machine was basically like a mix between a coin sorter and a giant bingo drum: a rolling metal cage into which they poured the fruits from one end.  The openings in the cylinder got progressively larger and larger from the end where the fruits were being poured, so that the smallest (unusable) ones would fall out first, followed by the grade &quot;C,&quot; then grade &quot;B&quot; and grade &quot;AA.&quot;  The graded fruit was collected in crates as it was sorted, and then the crates were weighed and labeled.  Apparently the fruit gets shipped to China and dried, though that might not be the order of actions.

The thing that I couldn't understand from just watching this all happen was the question of WHY the orchard farmers did it this way.  As far as I could tell, the grade AA fruits are paid out at 9 baht per kilogram, and the other grades sold for even less.  Contrasted with this, a random sampling of prices at the local markets seemed to be 20 or 25 baht per kilogram, with the branches sometimes even taking part in the process.  I mean, I can understand the value of group bargaining and having a guaranteed sale of ALL of your fruit, but that's a pretty large price cut.  I'm also left wondering what the AwBawTaw's cut is for providing all of this help to the farmers.  Unfortunately, I wasn't quite comfortable with stumbling through such questions in Thai, and I couldn't get the time to ask the Rong Nyoke about it in English.

Of course, there's a fair chance that he would be unable to give the answers in English for the questions I cannot ask properly in Thai.  Hmmm....

&quot;Lazy, Nerdy Weekend&quot;

There's actually not a whole lot of story to pass along about my weekend, even with the extra day mixed in from the holiday.  All weekend long, the weather kept looking like it was on the verge of raining, which meant that I mostly stayed inside the whole time.  I didn't actually go shopping for my new phone until after 4 on Saturday, by which point I was so impatient from having been cooped up all day (when it hadn't ever QUITE rained) that I was a bit less willing to hunt for the absolute cheapest phone than I might have been otherwise.

This is not to say that I went for the first shiney thing in site.  I actually stopped at two shops, the first of which had no phones in my price range.  Instead, the shopkeeper kindly showed me a weekend-circular kind of thing with pricing and descriptions for various phones.  It was quite helpful for helping to frame just how much I might end up paying for a phone.

On the other hand, the second shop didn't exactly have the wide variety of phones from the circular either, so I still ended up going for a slightly pricier phone than I might have otherwise purchased.  It's a Nokia 2760 flip phone, which connects to my computer via bluetooth technology.  Except...I don't actually have built-in bluetooth technology for my laptop, so I also had to buy a (relatively cheap) USB device to enable the capacity.  My total cost for the phone and USB doo-dad was 4,100 baht, or about $130.  It's far and away the costliest phone I've ever owned, not that I've ever actually had anything resembling a costly phone before.

At the same time, it's a pretty nice phone, too.  It comes with a built in video camera / recorder, which (though I'm mostly unlikely to use very often) could come in handy from time to time when I'm unable to use my normal camera.  The screen is full color, 128 x 160 pixels, and I discovered this because I realized that I could put my own pictures on there for desktop images.  It can also record sounds and play MP3s (though there are major limits to its memory capacity), so I'm able to set my own ringtones as well.  It now plays the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; when someone calls.

Another function that could be handy in the longer run is that the phone accepts contact information from Outlook, which means I don't have to type things in all the time using a tiny little keypad.  This also has the side effect of making me type up a secondary record of my contacts, in case something unpleasant should ever happen to the phone.  Unfortunately, this line of communication seems to be a one way street; in spite of numerous efforts, I've been unable to move contact or calendar information from my phone to Outlook.  But that's no big deal; I'll just have to use Joe's (my training roommate) perspective on PDAs: they're better for carrying around appointment information than for putting it is.

In terms of other fun extras (beyond the bluetooth technology and the internet connection, of course), the phone also has a radio and a decent headset.  The radio actually depends on the headset as its antennae, which seems fairly clever to me.  The headset itself offers pretty good quality, as far as I know.  I've been using it for most of my phone conversations (including the one with my family in America), and no one has complained of the sound quality in the least.  Meanwhile, I'm kind of jazzed at the hands-free conversation, since it means I can cook or do my laundry (my two most time-consuming chores) while maintaining a regular conversation.  And of course, with the bluetooth technology I now have the option of going for a wireless headset if I really want to geek out.

All in all, it's a fun new toy.  I'll just have to work on keeping it from distracting me from my e-mail writing.

Speaking of e-mail writing, I'd love to hear more about life from more of you.  I'm not looking for anything grandiose or at all approaching the size of my messages; even the daily &quot;dull&quot; stuff can be pretty nice to read about when you don't get to experience it yourself.  Plus, I'm regularly praying for y'all to be well; I want to find out how those prayers are doing.

Your patiently waiting friend (and/or relative),

Standard Post-Script Note: The preceding was comprised of a bunch of my own thoughts on my most current situation with the Peace Corps.  Under no circumstances should the opinions expressed be taken as an official stance of the Peace Corps.  Thai words are likely to be poorly spelled. If I should ever rant about something negative or frustrating, please don't file that negativity away in your mind--it will surely pass eventually.  If you should ever want to be removed from my e-mail distribution list, please let me know.  And if you like getting my e-mails, let me know that too, and let me know how life has been treating you--I'd love to get messages.  If you would like to pass this message along, please only share it with people I actually know, and invite them to e-mail me and get on the distribution list.  Under no circumstances should this or any future messages be published or reprinted without my express permission.
