Lesbians Who Terrorised Foster Girls Given Glowing Report by Social Workers

London Mirror | March 11 2004

A LESBIAN couple who terrorised two foster girls in their care were given
glowing reports by social workers.

Lesley Broughton, 31, and Lynne Sheridan, 30, were were said to offer an
&quot;excellent placement&quot;.

But secretly they put the two sisters, aged 11 and nine, through two years
of hell, a jury heard.

They punched and slapped them, made them drink washing up liquid, stand in
silence for hours and sit with their noses pressed against a wall.

Neighbours at Little Holton, near Bolton, called police after seeing the
girls frogmarched around the garden.

An investigation was under way yesterday after Broughton and Sheridan
admitted cruelty and administering a noxious substance.

At Minshull Street crown court they were given community service orders and
banned from working with children.

That's right, they made these poor children drink it. That is not a laughing
matter you fag. Dykes are well known to be violent and sadistic. They have a
domestic abuse rate of 70% while normal couples are 1%.
Dykes and unmarried spinsters should never be trusted alone with children
and it should be illegal for them to adopt.

Here's a few &quot;single mother&quot; for you:

The case of Peggy Hilt is still going on. The accused brutally beat up Vika
Bazhenova, a 2-year-old Russian girl adopted in Russia. The girl died on the
following day. A new round of preliminary hearing is slated for October 4th.
A forensic psychiatrist will give his expert opinion on certain
circumstances pertaining to the crime. An expert's opinion will play a
crucial role in the outcome of the trial. Peggy Hilt will get a term of
imprisonment lasting from 4 years up to 40 years if she is found guilty as
charged.

Another:

One Irma Pavlis is another American mom who killed her adopted Russian son.
According to her, she got completely out of hand. First she was whipping the
boy's buttocks with a rubber cord. Then she began banging his head against
the toilet wall until the boy passed out and stopped breathing.

Irma Pavlis was found guilty of killing her 6-year-old foster son. She was
sentenced to 12 years in jail. The jury acquitted her of the charges related
to premeditated murder under aggravating circumstances. She would have been
jailed for 45 years without parole if the court had found her guilty of the
first-degree murder of a child. The prosecutor Michael Gerber expressed his
disappointment about the verdict and said he would seek maximum punishment
for Irma Pavlis.
