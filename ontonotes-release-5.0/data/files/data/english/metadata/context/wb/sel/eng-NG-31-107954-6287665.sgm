My bicycle is rides perfectly. It has every desired accessory and it
shines so bright it hurts the eyes to gaze upon it.

What more can I do?

I did say it "rides" perfectly.

Truly though, I'm at my wit's end.

I have been scouring the ng for weeks now looking for anything more I
can do.

Maybe I'll just get another one.

Build more wheels.

That's what I do. I look for any excuse to build another set of
wheels.

It just occurred to me - I don't have any sew-ups with a generator
hub. I need to do something about that.

Ride lots. Get it filthy. Find some cute young thing to help you clean
it now and again. Ride. Repeat.  Fun isn't it?

Not a bad idea. I wouldn't have to get another bike if I fixed up some
cute young thing's---bicycle.

I did that in Mexico once. A girl that would put Salma Hayek to shame
lent her bike once. I returned it with new brake levers and then
borrowed it again.

She promptly asked me how much property and money I had in the bank in
the U.S. and if I was afraid to talk to her (very muscular) father.

I said no. I said I wasn't confortable asking a man if I could marry
his daughter when he was young enough to be my son.

She said it didn't matter (in Mexico).

I said O.K.; and did talk to him.

I was alright with him and I advanced to the next step: the mother.

After that talk I returned her bike for good.

Maybe I'll take a hammer to one of my wheels.

You don't have *everu* accessory, do you have 16, 28, 32, 36, 40 and 48
spoke wheels for the bike. Swap them out according to some desired speed
vs. load formula.

Uhhh. I've never counted the spokes. The wheels are just fine though I
did change the tires on them for a necessary (comfort) improvement.

As far as "speed vs. load formula," I really don't need one. It glides
along, uphill or downhill, loaded down with four or five bags of
groceries well enough that I regularly pass bicyclists carrying none
while exerting less effort than they are.

When I'm not loaded down, I actually have to concentrate on slowing
down---unless I'm daydreaming and simulating my riding style when I
was a kid.

I have yet to really find out just how fast the bike can go. I go fast
enough as it is.

Lots of nonsense out there, but the bike should disappear beneath you.
The object of the ride is the ride, not the bike. Bike is just the
tool, means to the end...the ride.

You don't know how many spokes are in your wheels? Well, then, I suggest
you just hang around here. There's plenty of discussion on related
topics; enough to keep you too busy to ride!

Or you could get some Hokey Spokes and start programming.
