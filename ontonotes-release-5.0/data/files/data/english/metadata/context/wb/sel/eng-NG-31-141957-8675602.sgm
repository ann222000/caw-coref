&quot;Wholesome former THE BRADY BUNCH star MAUREEN MCCORMICK is set to
reveal the beloved 70s TV series' most shocking secret in a new book -
she and her on-screen sister had a lesbian fling. MCCormick's tell-
all, Here's The Story, won't hit bookstores until 2008, but publishers
are already buzzing about the big reveal.
As well as talking candidly about her well-documented eating disorder
and drug problems in the book, TV's Marcia Brady will come clean about
a romance she had with co-star Eve Plumb, who played her sister Jan on
the hit show.
A source tells America's National Enquirer, &quot;The most explosive
comments will be how the then-blonde, blue-eyed cutie developed a
crush on Eve Plumb, which led to some sexual play. &quot;This book will
certainly come as a shocker. While Maureen is not a lesbian, she
reveals there were some sexual hijinks going on behind the scenes.
&quot;It's bizarre because she played such a virginal character on the
show.&quot; &quot;

I don't trust anyone with a book to sell. Drugs &amp; drinking problems,
sex stuff. It's all selling points. Maybe a bit of it's true, but a
lot is mostly blown out of proportion to sell the book and give an
initial buzz. I've heard of people with bio's getting turned down
because it's too boring. So they have to juice it up somehow.

These &quot;reality&quot; shows perform the same service. Make up some &quot;reality&quot;
to sell to the public. No such thing as bad publicity. Especially for
has-been's and never really was'.

Lots of teenaged girls experiment like that with their friends. It's

I think he's trying to say that even in spite of all the evidence that
shows how the lifestyle is corroding the fabric of our society, not to
mention the probability of eventual death from HIV and AIDS and the
tendency to misspell simple words such as &quot;it's&quot;, the practice of
homosexuality is OK among adults.

You do know that the lowest incidence of HIV/AIDS among any sexual
orientation group is among lesbians, right? (basically, the only way
lesbians can get it is through something unrelated to their sexual
preference, i.e. drug use, transfusion etc.)

If HIV/AIDS is a punishment visited by God, as some on the religious right
have argued, then clearly lesbians are God's chosen people.

Brady Bunch Sex History

What follows is the complete history of hearsay, speculation, and rumored
sexual activity on the Brady Bunch, whether gay, straight, lesbian,
bisexual, or asexual.

a.. Marsha and Jan had lesbian encounters. (Maureen McCormick and Eve Plumb)
a.. Greg (Barry Williams) was doing Marcia.
a.. Greg was also doing mom, Florence Henderson, at the same time.
a.. Cindy Brady (Susan Olsen) was almost a porn actress.
a.. Dad died from AIDS. He was definitely not doing mom.
a.. Alice was doing Sam the Butcher, everyone knows that.

&gt;&gt; I don't trust anyone with a book to sell. Drugs &amp; drinking problems,
&gt;&gt; sex stuff. It's all selling points. Maybe a bit of it's true, but a
&gt;&gt; lot is mostly blown out of proportion to sell the book and give an
&gt;&gt; initial buzz. I've heard of people with bio's getting turned down
&gt;&gt; because it's too boring. So they have to juice it up somehow.

&gt;&gt; These &quot;reality&quot; shows perform the same service. Make up some &quot;reality&quot;
&gt;&gt; to sell to the public. No such thing as bad publicity. Especially for
&gt;&gt; has-been's and never really was'.

On wiki, it says she first discussed this crush and kiss on Vibe in

&gt; Brady Bunch Sex History

&gt; What follows is the complete history of hearsay, speculation, and rumored
&gt; sexual activity on the Brady Bunch, whether gay, straight, lesbian,
&gt; bisexual, or asexual.

&gt; a.. Marsha and Jan had lesbian encounters. (Maureen McCormick and Eve Plumb)
&gt; a.. Greg (Barry Williams) was doing Marcia.
&gt; a.. Greg was also doing mom, Florence Henderson, at the same time.
&gt; a.. Cindy Brady (Susan Olsen) was almost a porn actress.
&gt; a.. Dad died from AIDS. He was definitely not doing mom.
&gt; a.. Alice was doing Sam the Butcher, everyone knows that.

Bored TV viewers can care.  They can go back and rewatch syndicated
Brady Bunch episodes and spot unintentionally amusing/ironic scenes.
What seemed to be innocent remarks by Marcia in the past now have
another meaning.

The best thing about watching episodes of the TV show Gomer Pyle: USMC
are the knowledge Jim Nabors is gay.  Almost every episode has at
least one amusing scene with an unintended special meaning.  For
example, Gomer might try to hug the seargent (who recoils in disgust)
or say, &quot;Sarge, I love you&quot;.  Often when Gomer is around a woman, he
shows no romantic interest in her at all.  Apparently Nabors didn't
have to act much for those scenes!

Tabloids are completely correct and accurate about 5% of the time.
The rest of the time it is gross exaggeration, facts taken out of

It is extremely difficult for celebrities to win a libel suit; a very

LORELAI: I am so done with plans. I am never, ever making one again.
It never works.  I spend the day obsessing over why it didn't work
and what I could've done differently.  I'm analyzing all my shortcomings
when all I really need to be doing is vowing to never, ever make a plan
ever again, which I'm doing now, having once again been the innocent
victim of my own stupid plans.  God, I need some coffee.
