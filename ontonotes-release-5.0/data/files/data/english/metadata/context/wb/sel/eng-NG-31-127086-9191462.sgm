Hi folks,

I would really appreciate some comments on the blog about this one.
Once again, I've gotten into a scrap with Scalpel where he has revealed
my real name, and this is my response. One of the reasons I started the
blog was to highlight this kind of behavior, and Scalpel has certainly
been obliging in that regard. Not that my real name is any state
secret, but it's the principle of the thing. He has taken to moderating
his posts and refusing anonymous posts, so you rpobably can't respond
there.

The &quot;Old School&quot; has closed its doors forever. It used to be, back in
the day, that even punks and bullies had a code of honor, and if you
stood up to the bully, he would take his medicine like a man and that
would be the end of it. Nowadays, they come back with their crew and
machine-gun your entire family, or if the punk in question happens to
be a doctor, he will come back with his crew and try to destroy your
medical care by blacklisting you, or publishing your name on the
Internet in the hopes that other doctors will deny you treatment, or
simply to intimidate you into silence. The days when even enemies could
treat each other with honor and respect and there were rules of
engagement to be followed are over. Now, it seems, malignant narcissism
is the rule of the day, and there is no limit to the depths of
sleaziness and cant some people will sink to get revenge against
someone for &quot;dissing&quot; them. Drive-by-shooting or medical sabotage, the
goal, and the mindset underlying it, are the same.

Case in point: the author of Scalpel and Sword, a patient-bashing site
by an &quot;ER doc in Texas,&quot; has twice responded to my criticism of his
hate-filled articles about chronic pain patients by revealing my real
name on his blog and on other blogs. In his latest outing, he has
called on ER docs in my area to be on their guard around me, as if I am
some dangerous criminal. I don't need to explain to anyone who has been
shut out by the &quot;Good Ole Boy&quot; network for speaking out what the effect
of this is likely to be. Scalpel has boasted on his website of
violating the HIPAA laws by blacklisting patients, and has admitted to
making people in pain wait in the ER or denying them treatment
altogether for failing to show him proper respect, so this kind of
behavior is hardly out of character for him. There is a code of conduct
among bloggers where we respect people's anonymity and right to
confidentiality, as we often know the names, e-mail addresses and IP
addresses of people who visit our blogs, even when they post
anonymously. It's abundantly clear that Scalpel has no more respect for
this code than he does for the right of his patients to confidentiality
under the HIPAA laws, or their right to be treated with dignity and
respect. It is a fundamental tenet of medical ethics that a doctor
should respect patient confidentiality and should &quot;do no harm&quot; and it
is readily apparent that Scalpel, like far too many doctors nowadays,
has no respect for these standards. Though I am obviously not Scalpel's
patient (thank God for small miracles), one would expect similar
conduct from a true doctor even in non-medical contexts. Scalpel
obviously disagrees.

Scalpel is also in violation of Google's Terms of Service/Content
policy, which states:

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION: We do not allow the
unauthorized publishing of people's private and confidential
information, such as credit card numbers, Social Security Numbers, and
driver's and other license numbers.

Needless to say, Scalpel has no respect for the policy under which
Google generously allows him and other bloggers to express their views
for free.

In his latest post, Scalpel is responding to my article entitled &quot;More
ER Asshattery&quot; where I address many of the fallacies presented in his
article on the numeric 1 to 10 Pain Scale and a related article where
he proposes an alternate pain scale. He then responds to my criticism
by revealing my real name and accusing me of having a &quot;revenge fantasy&quot;
against doctors. I hope you will forgive me for not repeating my real
name here or linking to the original article, as I obviously don't want
to paint a roadmap to this info, though in fact any narcissistic ER doc
with a little downtime in between abusing patients could probably find
this info in the same manner Scalpel did:

Courtesy of [my name omitted], a chronic pain sufferer in [my state
omitted] who used to be anonymously known as Redhawk but who now blogs
under the pseudonym Payne Hertz. I won't link him, but with a little
internet sleuthery you can find his whiny blog yourself, if you are so
inclined. He thought I was on the wrong track with my pain scales, so
he came up with this:

After which he quotes my tongue-in-cheek pain scale and accuses me of a
revenge fantasy. While my humor may be a little offensive and over the
top to some, it is just that, humor, and not a call to violence against
doctors. No unethical, arrogant doctors were harmed in the production
of Payne Hertz that I'm aware of, though Scalpel's ego has obviously
gotten a good bruising. Interestingly, he posts a &quot;revenge fantasy&quot; of
his own, though in fact revenge is no fantasy for him but a real life
activity he engages in regularly, as evidenced by his blog and the
behavior I am describing here. This is a guy who has boasted of
inflicting pain and suffering on his patients and attempting to
sabotage their medical care, and he is attempting to do the same to me.

[My name omitted], I would love for you to try that out sometime.
But my question for you is, if you are already at a &quot;level 10&quot; from
your chronic mystery pain and someone were to hypothetically spray you
in the eyes with pepper spray, stab you in the neck with a pencil, or
break your elbow by vigorously hyperextending it, would that not bother
you at all because you're already maxed out, or would your pain level
go up to a 15 or so? Just wondering.

My advice to Scalpel would be to stick to what you know and continue to
backstab your patients in the manner you're accustomed to. Direct
physical confrontation with your latest victim might not be in your
best interest, and you might find out the hard way what level 10 pain
feels like.

Interestingly, in a classic case of projection, Scalpel quotes an ER
nurse blog complaining of patients with &quot;personality disorders&quot; and how
tiresome they can be:

I have seen a couple of people get out of control when they didn't
get their narcs. I read an article in emergency medicine magazine that
takes about a doctors role in treated chronic pain in the emergency
setting. What's fascinating about it is that the author says that 50%
of chronic pain sufferers have personality disorders or affective
disorders. I can vouch for that. They wear you out, the people who come
in for chronic pain because they are people who are neurotic and
difficult to work with. Antidepressants have been found to be very
helpful in these people, along with psychological help. They seldom get
it.

It has been my personal experience reading and hearing hundreds of
stories from abused chronic pain patients that those doctors who are
most willing to play amateur psychologist by branding their patients
with the &quot;personality disorder&quot; label are the ones most likely to be
suffering from severe personality disorders themselves. After all, what
kind of personality does it take to blacklist a patient and willfully
sabotage his or her medical care because you perceived him to be
manipulative or disrespectful to you, or to leave another human being
writhing in agony by refusing to treat his pain? Or for that matter, to
violate a blogger's right to blog anonymously? Maybe it's this kind of
personality:

Their lack of self respect is even more damning. Because of it,
nothing is beneath them. No lie is too mean to tell. No trick is too
lowdown, dirty, and rotten to play. Things you or I couldn't stoop to,
because sinking to that level would make us feel like we are wallowing
naked on our bellies in sewage, narcissists glory in like mud-wallowing
hogs. Ironic, isn't it? that such deep, unbearable shame makes one
shameless? But it does.

...This is why every malignant narcissist has two middle names: one
is &quot;Abuser&quot; and the other is &quot;Slanderer.&quot;

Scalpel certainly fits the bill on all counts, particularly as abuser
and slanderer and willing to low crawl where most people wouldn't dare
to go, all because his ego got bruised.

Here is where Scalpel plunges the knife:

Indeed. If anyone reading this happens to work in an Emergency
Department in [state omitted] and is unfortunate enough to come across
this gentleman....you might want to guard your nuts.

This is an unequivocal attempt by Scalpel to libel me and sabotage my
medical care, and an attempt to intimidate me into silence. I can
promise you, it will have the opposite effect. It is sad that a doctor
with a so-called code of ethics would feel the need to sink to this
level, but this kind of thing happens all the time. If it weren't for
the high prevalence of ruthless, amoral and egotistical doctors like
Scalpel, Payne Hertz wouldn't exist. While I have no intention of
sinking to his level by revealing his real name, location or place of
employment, Scalpel might do well to heed the warning some other people
have made to him about karma, because he's got a lot to lose if his
real identity was ever revealed, and he most definitely has it coming
to him. The next person he screws over might be a hacker looking for
some payback.

&gt; lowdown, dirty, and rotten to play. Things you or I couldn't stoop to,
&gt; because sinking to that level would make us feel like we are wallowing
&gt; naked on our bellies in sewage, narcissists glory in like mud-wallowing
&gt; hogs. Ironic, isn't it? that such deep, unbearable shame makes one
&gt; shameless? But it does.

&gt;     ...This is why every malignant narcissist has two middle names: one
&gt; is &quot;Abuser&quot; and the other is &quot;Slanderer.&quot;

&gt; Scalpel certainly fits the bill on all counts, particularly as abuser
&gt; and slanderer and willing to low crawl where most people wouldn't dare
&gt; to go, all because his ego got bruised.

&gt; Here is where Scalpel plunges the knife:

&gt;     Indeed. If anyone reading this happens to work in an Emergency
&gt; Department in [state omitted] and is unfortunate enough to come across
&gt; this gentleman....you might want to guard your nuts.

&gt; This is an unequivocal attempt by Scalpel to libel me and sabotage my
&gt; medical care, and an attempt to intimidate me into silence. I can
&gt; promise you, it will have the opposite effect. It is sad that a doctor
&gt; with a so-called code of ethics would feel the need to sink to this
&gt; level, but this kind of thing happens all the time. If it weren't for
&gt; the high prevalence of ruthless, amoral and egotistical doctors like
&gt; Scalpel, Payne Hertz wouldn't exist. While I have no intention of
&gt; sinking to his level by revealing his real name, location or place of
&gt; employment, Scalpel might do well to heed the warning some other people
&gt; have made to him about karma, because he's got a lot to lose if his
&gt; real identity was ever revealed, and he most definitely has it coming
&gt; to him. The next

Sean,

Compliments on the Payne Hertz blog. Lots of good opinion, discussion,
info, etc. A valid platform for the concerns/problems of cp patients.

I don't mind the pointedly barbed nature of some posts. The situation is
such that &quot;soft and gentle&quot; language is sometimes entirely inappropriate.

I see that you have engaged &quot;scalpel&quot; more-or-less on a one-to-one
basis. Given the extremely contentious nature of much of the medical
industry, I suppose it was inevitable that you would run into an rv
(rabid/vicious) medico sooner or later.

Following questions are respectfully submitted:

1.) To what extent is &quot;scalpel&quot; truly representative of ER, PM, etc
docs in the industry?
2.) Are personal diatribes i.e. with &quot;scalpel&quot; and/or similar reptiles
100% consistent with the stated objectives of the blog?

I read the title (&quot;The Demise of Medical Ethics ...&quot;) and thought it
might be something general about the de-personalized assembly-line
approaches that modern docs seem to favor (&quot;We'll start with -this-
$1000 test/injection, then we'll do -that- $1000 test/injection,
then ...&quot;). Or perhaps the diminished judgment that ER, PM docs seem
to exercise in prescribing opioids (easier for them to just refuse).
The article was, of course, about something totally different.

It's kinda like asking &quot;To what extent might &quot;The Scalpel Dialogs&quot;
become just a blog-oriented Pissing Contest?&quot;.

Your opinion is solicited.

Cheers,
Puddin'

&gt;Sean C

&gt;The &quot;Old School&quot; has closed its doors forever. It used to be, back in
&gt;the day, that even punks and bullies had a code of honor, and if you
&gt;stood up to the bully, he would take his medicine like a man and that
&gt;would be the end of it. Nowadays, they come back with their crew and
&gt;machine-gun your entire family, or if the punk in question happens to
&gt;be a doctor, he will come back with his crew and try to destroy your
&gt;medical care by blacklisting you, or publishing your name on the
&gt;Internet in the hopes that other doctors will deny you treatment, or
&gt;simply to intimidate you into silence. The days when even enemies could
&gt;treat each other with honor and respect and there were rules of
&gt;engagement to be followed are over. Now, it seems, malignant narcissism
&gt;is the rule of the day, and there is no limit to the depths of
&gt;sleaziness and cant some people will sink to get revenge against
&gt;someone for &quot;dissing&quot; them. Drive-by-shooting or medical sabotage, the
&gt;goal, and the mindset underlying it, are the same.

&gt;Case in point: the author of Scalpel and Sword, a patient-bashing site
&gt;by an &quot;ER doc in Texas,&quot; has twice responded to my criticism of his
&gt;hate-filled articles about chronic pain patients by revealing my real
&gt;name on his blog and on other blogs. In his latest outing, he has
&gt;called on ER docs in my area to be on their guard around me, as if I am
&gt;some dangerous criminal. I don't need to explain to anyone who has been
&gt;shut out by the &quot;Good Ole Boy&quot; network for speaking out what the effect
&gt;of this is likely to be. Scalpel has boasted on his website of
&gt;violating the HIPAA laws by blacklisting patients, and has admitted to
&gt;making people in pain wait in the ER or denying them treatment
&gt;altogether for failing to show him proper respect, so this kind of
&gt;behavior is hardly out of character for him. There is a code of conduct
&gt;among bloggers where we respect people's anonymity and right to
&gt;confidentiality, as we often know the names, e-mail addresses and IP
&gt;addresses of people who visit our blogs, even when they post
&gt;anonymously. It's abundantly clear that Scalpel has no more respect for
&gt;this code than he does for the right of his patients to confidentiality
&gt;under the HIPAA laws, or their right to be treated with dignity and
&gt;respect. It is a fundamental tenet of medical ethics that a doctor
&gt;should respect patient confidentiality and should &quot;do no harm&quot; and it
&gt;is readily apparent that Scalpel, like far too many doctors nowadays,
&gt;has no respect for these standards. Though I am obviously not Scalpel's
&gt;patient (thank God for small miracles), one would expect similar
&gt;conduct from a true doctor even in non-medical contexts. Scalpel
&gt;obviously disagrees.

&gt;Scalpel is also in violation of Google's Terms of Service/Content
&gt;policy, which states:

&gt;    PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION: We do not allow the
&gt;unauthorized publishing of people's private and confidential
&gt;information, such as credit card numbers, Social Security Numbers, and
&gt;driver's and other license numbers.

&gt;Needless to say, Scalpel has no respect for the policy under which
&gt;Google generously allows him and other bloggers to express their views
&gt;for free.

&gt;In his latest post, Scalpel is responding to my article entitled &quot;More
&gt;ER Asshattery&quot; where I address many of the fallacies presented in his
&gt;article on the numeric 1 to 10 Pain Scale and a related article where
&gt;he proposes an alternate pain scale. He then responds to my criticism
&gt;by revealing my real name and accusing me of having a &quot;revenge fantasy&quot;
&gt;against doctors. I hope you will forgive me for not repeating my real
&gt;name here or linking to the original article, as I obviously don't want
&gt;to paint a roadmap to this info, though in fact any narcissistic ER doc
&gt;with a little downtime in between abusing patients could probably find
&gt;this info in the same manner Scalpel did:

&gt;    Courtesy of [my name omitted], a chronic pain sufferer in [my state
&gt;omitted] who used to be anonymously known as Redhawk but who now blogs
&gt;under the pseudonym Payne Hertz. I won't link him, but with a little
&gt;internet sleuthery you can find his whiny blog yourself, if you are so
&gt;inclined. He thought I was on the wrong track with my pain scales, so
&gt;he came up with this:

&gt;After which he quotes my tongue-in-cheek pain scale and accuses me of a
&gt;revenge fantasy. While my humor may be a little offensive and over the
&gt;top to some, it is just that, humor, and not a call to violence against
&gt;doctors. No unethical, arrogant doctors were harmed in the production
&gt;of Payne Hertz that I'm aware of, though Scalpel's ego has obviously
&gt;gotten a good bruising. Interestingly, he posts a &quot;revenge fantasy&quot; of
&gt;his own, though in fact revenge is no fantasy for him but a real life
&gt;activity he engages in regularly, as evidenced by his blog and the
&gt;behavior I am describing here. This is a guy who has boasted of
&gt;inflicting pain and suffering on his patients and attempting to
&gt;sabotage their medical care, and he is attempting to do the same to me.

&gt;    [My name omitted], I would love for you to try that out sometime.
&gt;But my question for you is, if you are already at a &quot;level 10&quot; from
&gt;your chronic mystery pain and someone were to hypothetically spray you
&gt;in the eyes with pepper spray, stab you in the neck with a pencil, or
&gt;break your elbow by vigorously hyperextending it, would that not bother
&gt;you at all because you're already maxed out, or would your pain level
&gt;go up to a 15 or so? Just wondering.

&gt;My advice to Scalpel would be to stick to what you know and continue to
&gt;backstab your patients in the manner you're accustomed to. Direct
&gt;physical confrontation with your latest victim might not be in your
&gt;best interest, and you might find out the hard way what level 10 pain
&gt;feels like.

&gt;Interestingly, in a classic case of projection, Scalpel quotes an ER
&gt;nurse blog complaining of patients with &quot;personality disorders&quot; and how
&gt;tiresome they can be:

&gt;    I have seen a couple of people get out of control when they didn't
&gt;get their narcs. I read an article in emergency medicine magazine that
&gt;takes about a doctors role in treated chronic pain in the emergency
&gt;setting. What's fascinating about it is that the author says that 50%
&gt;of chronic pain sufferers have personality disorders or affective
&gt;disorders. I can vouch for that. They wear you out, the people who come
&gt;in for chronic pain because they are people who are neurotic and
&gt;difficult to work with. Antidepressants have been found to be very
&gt;helpful in these people, along with psychological help. They seldom get
&gt;it.

&gt;It has been my personal experience reading and hearing hundreds of
&gt;stories from abused chronic pain patients that those doctors who are
&gt;most willing to play amateur psychologist by branding their patients
&gt;with the &quot;personality disorder&quot; label are the ones most likely to be
&gt;suffering from severe personality disorders themselves. After all, what
&gt;kind of personality does it take to blacklist a patient and willfully
&gt;sabotage his or her medical care because you perceived him to be
&gt;manipulative or disrespectful to you, or to leave another human being
&gt;writhing in agony by refusing to treat his pain? Or for that matter, to
&gt;violate a blogger's right to blog anonymously? Maybe it's this kind of
&gt;personality:

&gt;    Their lack of self respect is even more damning. Because of it,
&gt;nothing is beneath them. No lie is too mean to tell. No trick is too
&gt;lowdown, dirty, and rotten to play. Things you or I couldn't stoop to,
&gt;because sinking to that level would make us feel like we are wallowing
&gt;naked on our bellies in sewage, narcissists glory in like mud-wallowing
&gt;hogs. Ironic, isn't it? that such deep, unbearable shame makes one
&gt;shameless? But it does.

I can only go by my own experience and the perception I have from
reading and listening to the experiences of others. I have read and am
familiar with a lot of the medblogs out there, particularly the more
popular ones. I have also been to forums for doctors, nurses and med
students. I can say without the slightest exaggeration that Scalpel's
opinions are representative of 98 percent of the owners of those blogs
and forums and the medical professionals who post there. They are also
respersentative of a a fair number of lay people and even some chronic
pain patients, particularly when the conversation turns to &quot;drug
seekers.&quot; The only dissenting opinions come from pain patients, and a
handful of doctors here and there. I don't know if you read my article
&quot;Finally, Some Enlgihtened Attitudes,&quot; but I was motivated to write
that by the fact that I have rarely encountered positive attitudes like
that about pain patients in any medical forum. It was likely finding a
diamond in a septic tank.

As for the real world, I would venture to say those attitudes are
extremely common among medical professionals as a whole, and ER docs in
particular. There is a strong, authoritarian mindset in this country
that regards people who are sick, or poor, or who have made mistakes
with their lives as scum who deserve to be punished. You have only to
look at who our president is and ask yourself how he got there to
realize that the  Scalpel mindset is not an isolated one.

The article was about medical ethics. I wrote about the fact that
Scalpel labels his patients as &quot;drug-seekers&quot; and blacklists many of
them, which is a violation of patient confidentiality and the HIPAA
laws. That *is* a violation of medical ethics and one that is
surprisingly common, as just about every ER in the country maintains a
blacklist and the &quot;White Wall of Silence&quot; is a very real phenomenon
that works against patients who challenge the system in any way,
particularly people who have been injured through malpractice. I
ventured the opinion that Scalpel's revealing my real name was an
attempt to blacklist me in much the same way, and enforce my silence.
The part about the &quot;Old School&quot; was to point out that this kind of
thing would have been unthikable in the past, but is common practice
today.

Are you honestly suggesting I should refrain from saying anything about
that?

I understand that the whole Scalpel thing can degenerate into a flame
war, at which point I may have to disable posting on that article, but
I also think it important that the public gets a real world view of how
a lot of doctors in this system operate, and to see that the things I
am saying about blacklisting, bigotry and abuse are not just the
opinion of some erstwhile anonymous blogger, but a very real phenomeon
that they need to be aware of, and should work to eliminate from the
system. Scalpel's behavior as illustrated in his postings on my blog
tells the story of what chronic pain patients have to go through better
than anything i can write myself, becasue it is coming straight from
the horse's mouth and not third party from me. I feel in allowing
Scalpel to sputter, it is raising awareness and illustrating a very
powerful reality.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's kinda like asking &quot;To what extent might &quot;The Scalpel Dialogs&quot;
&gt; become just a blog-oriented Pissing Contest?&quot;.

&gt; Your opinion is solicited.
">

I think I should make a few things clear, so people know where I am
coming from with this blog. The very thing that motivated me to start
that blog was reading all the medblogs out there and the extremely
nasty, negative and bigoted stereotypes of cp'ers most of them are
peddling to the public. On these blogs, as I said, it is rare to find
dissenting views from medical professionals, perhaps becasue the owners
delete them, or because there aren't too many docs expressing a
contrary opinion in the first place. I felt it was necessary to get
another message out there, about the realities of what people with pain
go through and just how dehumanizing it can be to be treated this way.

These blogs are incredibly popular with the public, and receive
widespread support and approval, including in the media. Blogs which
tell our side of the story are relegated to the backwaters of the
internet, receiving very little support from anybody. As an example
take the article I wrote about in &quot;More ER Wisdom&quot; which  was called
&quot;Ten ironies and truisms of the ER.&quot; That article was picked up on
Digg, a social bookmarking service, and recived over 790 Diggs, meaning
it is a very popular article. The more &quot;diggs&quot; you get, the more people
see your article, the more popular it becomes. People can also give
negative diggs or &quot;bury&quot; an article.

http://digg.com/offbeat_news/10_truisms_of_the_ER

Compare this now to Dr DeLuca's profile. Dr DeLuca is the author of the
excellent War on Drugs/Pain Crisis blog, which is one of the blogs of
the Pain Relief Network. He has gotten a grand total of maybe 10 diggs
for all his articles, one of the diggs was by me.

http://digg.com/users/docalex
http://www.doctordeluca.com/wordpress/

Are you getting my point? Snarky, patient-bashing articles full of
ignorant and defamatory comments about people in pain are wildly
popular with the public; fact-filled, informative and well-written
articles sympathetic to people in pain receive little support from
anybody, not even those in pain. I think we need to work to change
these attitudes and wake people up to the fact that what happens to us
can happen to them, too.

The old saying goes that the only thing necessary for evil to triumph
is for good men to do nothing. In that vein I think it is extremely
important that we expose and challenge these views, and to let people
know that if they are treated this way, it is not their fault, and they
have a right to be angry at the system. I think we need to get over
this &quot;Marcus Welby,&quot; ER TV show mentality of doctors being these
benign, caring people who never do anything wrong and if they label a
bunch of people as drug seekers or treat them like shit, it can only be
because they deserve it. I think we need to get past the idea that a
medical system that kills 250,000 people a year and denies pain
treatment to millions of human beings is some kind of Willy Wonka
wonderland of love and joy, but instead a very ruthless machine whose
primary purpose is the creation of profit, not the wellbeing of
patients.

I realize that many people are uncomfortable with the idea of
challenging this system. There seems to be a &quot;don't rock the boat&quot;
mentality, particularly among those who are receiving proper pain
treatment who are afraid that expressing anger towards doctors or the
system will result in more doctor refusing to treat pain, perhaps even
their own doctors. I doubt my blog has gotten more than 400 or 500
unique vistors so far, but I have already received e-mails suggesting
that I should go after the drug seekers, who are the real cause of the
problem, and we should just be nice and cooperate with the good
doctors. I absolutely don't agree with that.

I get the point you are trying to make, Puddin, and I respect your
opinion. It may be counterproductive to let a carnival develop on the
blog, but it might just be the right thing to do. Let me let it sit for
a while and see what develops.

I can't say much more than what i said to Puddin, but I am strongly
considering going to the media with this. My anonymity is already
destroyed, and I doubt Google will enforce its user policy against this
bozo. I do have an agenda here, and that agenda is to expose patient
abuse and the sleazy, underhanded way a lot of the players in this
system operate. I haven't made my decision yet, but I think blowing
this out in the open might be a good thing.

Most of the comments there are from other users, and I pretty much have
the policy that so long as no one is being abusive towards a particular
poster, I am not going to delete comments. Scalpel has it coming to him
so I am not going to delete any of the negative comments directed
against him. I realize that this is generating a lot of anger, and a
lot of people would probably do well to just avoid the post in question
because even seeing these attitudes can be infuriating and demoralizing
to patients looking for a ray of hope in their lives. This is why I try
to emphasize that Payne Hertz isn't a support group, and not the best
place to go if you're looking for ways to get better pain care. I want
to shine a light on the dark underbelly of the medical system, and I
realize that when I do so I will expose a few trolls, and they are not
pretty to behold.

&gt; &gt; The &quot;Old School&quot; has closed its doors forever. It used to be, back in
&gt; &gt; the day, that even punks and bullies had a code of honor, and if you
&gt; &gt; stood up to the bully, he would take his medicine like a man and that
&gt; &gt; would be the end of it. Nowadays, they come back with their crew and
&gt; &gt; machine-gun your entire family, or if the punk in question happens to
&gt; &gt; be a doctor, he will come back with his crew and try to destroy your
&gt; &gt; medical care by blacklisting you, or publishing your name on the
&gt; &gt; Internet in the hopes that other doctors will deny you treatment, or
&gt; &gt; simply to intimidate you into silence. The days when even enemies
&gt; &gt; could treat each other with honor and respect and there were rules of
&gt; &gt; engagement to be followed are over. Now, it seems, malignant
&gt; &gt; narcissism is the rule of the day, and there is no limit to the
&gt; &gt; depths of sleaziness and cant some people will sink to get revenge
&gt; &gt; against someone for &quot;dissing&quot; them. Drive-by-shooting or medical
&gt; &gt; sabotage, the goal, and the mindset underlying it, are the same.

&gt; &gt; Case in point: the author of Scalpel and Sword, a patient-bashing site
&gt; &gt; by an &quot;ER doc in Texas,&quot; has twice responded to my criticism of his
&gt; &gt; hate-filled articles about chronic pain patients by revealing my real
&gt; &gt; name on his blog and on other blogs. In his latest outing, he has
&gt; &gt; called on ER docs in my area to be on their guard around me, as if I
&gt; &gt; am some dangerous criminal. I don't need to explain to anyone who has
&gt; &gt; been shut out by the &quot;Good Ole Boy&quot; network for speaking out what the
&gt; &gt; effect of this is likely to be. Scalpel has boasted on his website of
&gt; &gt; violating the HIPAA laws by blacklisting patients, and has admitted to
&gt; &gt; making people in pain wait in the ER or denying them treatment
&gt; &gt; altogether for failing to show him proper respect, so this kind of
&gt; &gt; behavior is hardly out of character for him. There is a code of
&gt; &gt; conduct among bloggers where we respect people's anonymity and right
&gt; &gt; to confidentiality, as we often know the names, e-mail addresses and
&gt; &gt; IP addresses of people who visit our blogs, even when they post
&gt; &gt; anonymously. It's abundantly clear that Scalpel has no more respect
&gt; &gt; for this code than he does for the right of his patients to
&gt; &gt; confidentiality under the HIPAA laws, or their right to be treated
&gt; &gt; with dignity and respect. It is a fundamental tenet of medical ethics
&gt; &gt; that a doctor should respect patient confidentiality and should &quot;do
&gt; &gt; no harm&quot; and it is readily apparent that Scalpel, like far too many
&gt; &gt; doctors nowadays, has no respect for these standards. Though I am
&gt; &gt; obviously not Scalpel's patient (thank God for small miracles), one
&gt; &gt; would expect similar conduct from a true doctor even in non-medical
&gt; &gt; contexts. Scalpel obviously disagrees.

&gt; &gt; Scalpel is also in violation of Google's Terms of Service/Content
&gt; &gt; policy, which states:

&gt; &gt;    PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION: We do not allow the
&gt; &gt; unauthorized publishing of people's private and confidential
&gt; &gt; information, such as credit card numbers, Social Security Numbers, and
&gt; &gt; driver's and other license numbers.

&gt; &gt; Needless to say, Scalpel has no respect for the policy under which
&gt; &gt; Google generously allows him and other bloggers to express their views
&gt; &gt; for free.

&gt; &gt; In his latest post, Scalpel is responding to my article entitled &quot;More
&gt; &gt; ER Asshattery&quot; where I address many of the fallacies presented in his
&gt; &gt; article on the numeric 1 to 10 Pain Scale and a related article where
&gt; &gt; he proposes an alternate pain scale. He then responds to my criticism
&gt; &gt; by revealing my real name and accusing me of having a &quot;revenge
&gt; &gt; fantasy&quot; against doctors. I hope you will forgive me for not
&gt; &gt; repeating my real name here or linking to the original article, as I
&gt; &gt; obviously don't want to paint a roadmap to this info, though in fact
&gt; &gt; any narcissistic ER doc with a little downtime in between abusing
&gt; &gt; patients could probably find this info in the same manner Scalpel did:

&gt; &gt;    Courtesy of [my name omitted], a chronic pain sufferer in [my state
&gt; &gt; omitted] who used to be anonymously known as Redhawk but who now blogs
&gt; &gt; under the pseudonym Payne Hertz. I won't link him, but with a little
&gt; &gt; internet sleuthery you can find his whiny blog yourself, if you are so
&gt; &gt; inclined. He thought I was on the wrong track with my pain scales, so
&gt; &gt; he came up with this:

&gt; &gt; After which he quotes my tongue-in-cheek pain scale and accuses me of
&gt; &gt; a revenge fantasy. While my humor may be a little offensive and over
&gt; &gt; the top to some, it is just that, humor, and not a call to violence
&gt; &gt; against doctors. No unethical, arrogant doctors were harmed in the
&gt; &gt; production of Payne Hertz that I'm aware of, though Scalpel's ego has
&gt; &gt; obviously gotten a good bruising. Interestingly, he posts a &quot;revenge
&gt; &gt; fantasy&quot; of his own, though in fact revenge is no fantasy for him but
&gt; &gt; a real life activity he engages in regularly, as evidenced by his
&gt; &gt; blog and the behavior I am describing here. This is a guy who has
&gt; &gt; boasted of inflicting pain and suffering on his patients and
&gt; &gt; attempting to sabotage their medical care, and he is attempting to do
&gt; &gt; the same to me.

&gt; &gt;    [My name omitted], I would love for you to try that out sometime.
&gt; &gt; But my question for you is, if you are already at a &quot;level 10&quot; from
&gt; &gt; your chronic mystery pain and someone were to hypothetically spray you
&gt; &gt; in the eyes with pepper spray, stab you in the neck with a pencil, or
&gt; &gt; break your elbow by vigorously hyperextending it, would that not
&gt; &gt; bother you at all because you're already maxed out, or would your
&gt; &gt; pain level go up to a 15 or so? Just wondering.

&gt; &gt; My advice to Scalpel would be to stick to what you know and continue
&gt; &gt; to backstab your patients in the manner you're accustomed to. Direct
&gt; &gt; physical confrontation with your latest victim might not be in your
&gt; &gt; best interest, and you might find out the hard way what level 10 pain
&gt; &gt; feels like.

&gt; &gt; Interestingly, in a classic case of projection, Scalpel quotes an ER
&gt; &gt; nurse blog complaining of patients with &quot;personality disorders&quot; and
&gt; &gt; how tiresome they can be:

&gt; &gt;    I have seen a couple of people get out of control when they didn't
&gt; &gt; get their narcs. I read an article in emergency medicine magazine that
&gt; &gt; takes about a doctors role in treated chronic pain in the emergency
&gt; &gt; setting. What's fascinating about it is that the author says that 50%
&gt; &gt; of chronic pain sufferers have personality disorders or affective
&gt; &gt; disorders. I can vouch for that. They wear you out, the people who
&gt; &gt; come in for chronic pain because they are people who are neurotic and
&gt; &gt; difficult to work with. Antidepressants have been found to be very
&gt; &gt; helpful in these people, along with psychological help. They seldom
&gt; &gt; get it.

&gt; &gt; It has been my personal experience reading and hearing hundreds of
&gt; &gt; stories from abused chronic pain patients that those doctors who are
&gt; &gt; most willing to play amateur psychologist by branding their patients
&gt; &gt; with the &quot;personality disorder&quot; label are the ones most likely to be
&gt; &gt; suffering from severe personality disorders themselves. After all,
&gt; &gt; what kind of personality does it take to blacklist a patient and
&gt; &gt; willfully sabotage his or her medical care because you perceived him
&gt; &gt; to be manipulative or disrespectful to you, or to leave another human
&gt; &gt; being writhing in agony by refusing to treat his pain? Or for that
&gt; &gt; matter, to violate a blogger's right to blog anonymously? Maybe it's
&gt; &gt; this kind of personality:

&gt; &gt;    Their lack of self respect is even more damning. Because of it,
&gt; &gt; nothing is beneath them. No lie is too mean to tell. No trick is too
&gt; &gt; lowdown, dirty, and rotten to play. Things you or I couldn't stoop to,
&gt; &gt; because sinking to that level would make us feel like we are wallowing
&gt; &gt; naked on our bellies in sewage, narcissists glory in like
&gt; &gt; mud-wallowing hogs. Ironic, isn't it? that such deep, unbearable
&gt; &gt; shame makes one shameless? But it does.

&gt; &gt;    ...This is why every malignant narcissist has two middle names: one
&gt; &gt; is &quot;Abuser&quot; and the other is &quot;Slanderer.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Scalpel certainly fits the bill on all counts, particularly as abuser
&gt; &gt; and slanderer and willing to low crawl where most people wouldn't dare
&gt; &gt; to go, all because his ego got bruised.

&gt; &gt; Here is where Scalpel plunges the knife:

&gt; &gt;    Indeed. If anyone reading this happens to work in an Emergency
&gt; &gt; Department in [state omitted] and is unfortunate enough to come across
&gt; &gt; this gentleman....you might want to guard your nuts.

&gt; &gt; This is an unequivocal attempt by Scalpel to libel me and sabotage my
&gt; &gt; medical care, and an attempt to intimidate me into silence. I can
&gt; &gt; promise you, it will have the opposite effect. It is sad that a doctor
&gt; &gt; with a so-called code of ethics would feel the need to sink to this
&gt; &gt; level, but this kind of thing happens all the time. If it weren't for
&gt; &gt; the high prevalence of ruthless, amoral and

Sean was asking for comment on his PAYNE HERTZ blog in answer to a post
he made about a vindictive doctor who posted Sean's name and location on
the Drs blog, just because Sean has been a critic of this doctor's
opinions. The doctor is a mean-spirited a'hole who constantly brags
about his ability to ferret out &quot;drug seekers&quot; who present at his ER in
great pain. He also brags about maintaining a &quot;blacklist&quot; which is
unethical if not illegal. It is our opinion (mine and Sean's and some
others) that this doctor is denying a lot of people proper pain control
who really deserve it.

Sean has been using his blog to bring attention to the way chronic pain
patients are being mistreated by some doctors. He also posts on doctors
blogs when he is able to comment on things the doctors say. That is what
attracted this doctor to go after him to try to shut him up. The doctor
had to go to a lot of effort to dig up Sean's real name and address,
just so he could put it on his blog. And if that weren't bad enough the
doctor called Sean a drug seeker and he called upon all ER doctors in
Sean's area to watch out for him.

This is outrageous and some of us are upset about it. The question is
what to do next. &quot;Puddin'  Man&quot; rightly pointed out that there is
nothing to be gained by continuing this pissing match with the Dr.

I reluctantly agreed and I told Sean that he should let it go. But
understandably Sean doesn't want to let it go. He pointed out that he
has defined his blog as vehicle for taking doctors like this on and so
he has no intentions of backing down.

I'm not so sure that my explanation is any more understandable than
reading this thread and looking at the blogs yourself. But since you
asked, I took a shot.

For po' me, it has to do with the intended audience and the intended objectives.

&quot;The mission of Payne Hertz is to educate and inform the public of
the continuing abuse and maltreatment of people with chronic pain,
and to advocate for civilized and humane treatment based on our
highest conceptions of individual liberty, human rights, and
morality. &quot;

I assumed the intended audience to be:
1.) The Public at large
2.) The Med community at large
3.) RVM's (Rabid and Vicious Medicos)
4.) cp folk

How many of each of &lt;above&gt; are active in the &quot;Blogosphere&quot; ?
Of those, how many will take time to follow Flame Wars?

There are thousands of &quot;dumb kids&quot; out there who look kinda like
&quot;lost souls&quot;, who are not in serious pain, who've discovered that they can
jive certain docs, get vicodin (or whatever) for a safe &quot;buzz&quot;.

Some medicos put up a &quot;front&quot; to discourage this. Their message is
essentially &quot;We've heard all the jive, and we aren't buying any
bills of goods anymore&quot;. Some of these same medicos might render
proper treatment when presented with conclusive evidence of
a responsible patient with severe and/or chronic pain. In an ER
or other med setting. Other medicos (presumably a small minority)
have taken the &quot;front&quot; to ridiculous extremes.

I've been assuming that the average medico is simply seeking to
maximize revenue whilst minimizing risk. They perceive risk largely
in both regulatory and moral aspects of dispensation of opioids.
Given that patient treatment, as a priority, comes third or lower,
there's a definite tendency to under-treat or even refuse treatment.
A tendency to paint all patients with the same &quot;Brush Of Suspicion&quot;.

That's a bunch different from Scalpel, who has likely given up
on effective treatment long ago and appears to be declaring
some kind of mutant &quot;war&quot; on pain patients.

True or False:
&quot;The majority of medicos are not true RVM's and don't even blog.&quot;

True or False:
&quot;If you paint them all (The Med community at large) with the &quot;Scalpel
Brush&quot;, they will cease listening to you and the blog (muy pronto).&quot;

I assumed (perhaps incorrectly) that the intended audience was 1.)
and (directly or indirectly) 2.). Given a degree of polish and
objectivity, the blog could draw attention from certain non-
sensationalist media folk, i.e. the gal that wrote
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/magazine/17pain-t.html?_r=1&amp;oref;=sl...
or other sympathetic folks who won't be the least bit interested
in what they perceive to be &quot;two extremists in a flame war&quot;.

Bottom line: From where I stand, it looks like a Catch-22. If the
*primary thrust* of the blog is ultra-confrontational stuff with
RVM's, then the audience, aside from some cp patients, will be
mostly RVM's. And those are precisely the critters that you cannot
reach. Their minds are closed on the subject. There's nothing that
you/I can say to them that won't be like water off the proverbial
duck's back.

There might also be a question re the relevance of focusing on
-any- ER personnel. Most PM takes place in different settings.
For all I know, the average ER could see 10 'dumb kids' for
every 1 valid pain patient. For years, I've (personally) viewed
ER's only as a place to die.

I'm not telling you what to do with the blog. When it comes down
to the decision of which direction is appropriate, I 'spect it will
be *your* blog, and you can do what you want with it. You said
you would really appreciate some comments, and &lt;the above&gt; was
simply what occurred to me. Merely &quot;Food For Thought&quot;.

Best,
Puddin'

&gt;&gt; Sean,

&gt;&gt; Compliments on the Payne Hertz blog. Lots of good opinion, discussion,
&gt;&gt; info, etc. A valid platform for the concerns/problems of cp patients.

&gt;&gt; I don't mind the pointedly barbed nature of some posts. The situation is
&gt;&gt; such that &quot;soft and gentle&quot; language is sometimes entirely inappropriate.

&gt;&gt; I see that you have engaged &quot;scalpel&quot; more-or-less on a one-to-one
&gt;&gt; basis. Given the extremely contentious nature of much of the medical
&gt;&gt; industry, I suppose it was inevitable that you would run into an rv
&gt;&gt; (rabid/vicious) medico sooner or later.

&gt;&gt; Following questions are respectfully submitted:

&gt;&gt; 1.) To what extent is &quot;scalpel&quot; truly representative of ER, PM, etc
&gt;&gt;     docs in the industry?

&gt;I can only go by my own experience and the perception I have from
&gt;reading and listening to the experiences of others. I have read and am
&gt;familiar with a lot of the medblogs out there, particularly the more
&gt;popular ones. I have also been to forums for doctors, nurses and med
&gt;students. I can say without the slightest exaggeration that Scalpel's
&gt;opinions are representative of 98 percent of the owners of those blogs
&gt;and forums and the medical professionals who post there. They are also
&gt;respersentative of a a fair number of lay people and even some chronic
&gt;pain patients, particularly when the conversation turns to &quot;drug
&gt;seekers.&quot; The only dissenting opinions come from pain patients, and a
&gt;handful of doctors here and there. I don't know if you read my article
&gt;&quot;Finally, Some Enlgihtened Attitudes,&quot; but I was motivated to write
&gt;that by the fact that I have rarely encountered positive attitudes like
&gt;that about pain patients in any medical forum. It was likely finding a
&gt;diamond in a septic tank.

&gt;As for the real world, I would venture to say those attitudes are
&gt;extremely common among medical professionals as a whole, and ER docs in
&gt;particular. There is a strong, authoritarian mindset in this country
&gt;that regards people who are sick, or poor, or who have made mistakes
&gt;with their lives as scum who deserve to be punished. You have only to
&gt;look at who our president is and ask yourself how he got there to
&gt;realize that the  Scalpel mindset is not an isolated one.

&gt;&gt; 2.) Are personal diatribes i.e. with &quot;scalpel&quot; and/or similar reptiles
&gt;&gt;     100% consistent with the stated objectives of the blog?

&gt;&gt; I read the title (&quot;The Demise of Medical Ethics ...&quot;) and thought it
&gt;&gt; might be something general about the de-personalized assembly-line
&gt;&gt; approaches that modern docs seem to favor (&quot;We'll start with -this-
&gt;&gt; $1000 test/injection, then we'll do -that- $1000 test/injection,
&gt;&gt; then ...&quot;). Or perhaps the diminished judgment that ER, PM docs seem
&gt;&gt; to exercise in prescribing opioids (easier for them to just refuse).
&gt;&gt; The article was, of course, about something totally different.

&gt;The article was about medical ethics. I wrote about the fact that
&gt;Scalpel labels his patients as &quot;drug-seekers&quot; and blacklists many of
&gt;them, which is a violation of patient confidentiality and the HIPAA
&gt;laws. That *is* a violation of medical ethics and one that is
&gt;surprisingly common, as just about every ER in the country maintains a
&gt;blacklist and the &quot;White Wall of Silence&quot; is a very real phenomenon
&gt;that works against patients who challenge the system in any way,
&gt;particularly people who have been injured through malpractice. I
&gt;ventured the opinion that Scalpel's revealing my real name was an
&gt;attempt to blacklist me in much the same way, and enforce my silence.
&gt;The part about the &quot;Old School&quot; was to point out that this kind of
&gt;thing would have been unthikable in the past, but is common practice
&gt;today.

&gt;Are you honestly suggesting I should refrain from saying anything about
&gt;that?

&gt;I understand that the whole Scalpel thing can degenerate into a flame
&gt;war, at which point I may have to disable posting on that article, but
&gt;I also think it important that the public gets a real world view of how
&gt;a lot of doctors in this system operate, and to see that the things I
&gt;am saying about blacklisting, bigotry and abuse are not just the
&gt;opinion of some erstwhile anonymous blogger, but a very real phenomeon
&gt;that they need to be aware of, and should work to eliminate from the
&gt;system. Scalpel's behavior as illustrated in his postings on my blog
&gt;tells the story of what chronic pain patients have to go through better
&gt;than anything i can write myself, becasue it is coming straight from
&gt;the horse's mouth and not third party from me. I feel in allowing
&gt;Scalpel to sputter, it is raising awareness and illustrating a very
&gt;powerful reality.

&gt;&gt; It's kinda like asking &quot;To what extent might &quot;The Scalpel Dialogs&quot;
&gt;&gt; become just a blog-oriented Pissing Contest?&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Your opinion is solicited.

&gt;I think I should make a few things clear, so people know where I am
&gt;coming from with this blog. The very thing that motivated me to start
&gt;that blog was reading all the medblogs out there and the extremely
&gt;nasty, negative and bigoted stereotypes of cp'ers most of them are
&gt;peddling to the public. On these blogs, as I said, it is rare to find
&gt;dissenting views from medical professionals, perhaps becasue the owners
&gt;delete them, or because there aren't too many docs expressing a
&gt;contrary opinion in the first place. I felt it was necessary to get
&gt;another message out there, about the realities of what people with pain
&gt;go through and just how dehumanizing it can be to be treated this way.

&gt;These blogs are incredibly popular with the public, and receive
&gt;widespread support and approval, including in the media. Blogs which
&gt;tell our side of the story are relegated to the backwaters of the
&gt;internet, receiving very little support from anybody. As an example
&gt;take the article I wrote about in &quot;More ER Wisdom&quot; which  was called
&gt;&quot;Ten ironies and truisms of the ER.&quot; That article was picked up on
&gt;Digg, a social bookmarking service, and recived over 790 Diggs, meaning
&gt;it is a very popular article. The more &quot;diggs&quot; you get, the more people
&gt;see your article, the more popular it becomes. People can also give
&gt;negative diggs or &quot;bury&quot; an article.

I appreciate your comments but I need to point a few things out. The

of a particular doctor, coupled with a discussion of how that behavior
is both unethical and becoming increasingly common. I cannot control
what people write in the comments without practicing censorship.

&gt; There are thousands of &quot;dumb kids&quot; out there who look kinda like
&gt; &quot;lost souls&quot;, who are not in serious pain, who've discovered that they can

That's what we're told, but doctors always have an excuse for
everything. 250,000 dead a year but to hear doctors, the malpractice
&quot;crisis&quot; is solely the result of litigious patients filing frivolous
lawsuits. The epidemic of untreated pain? Blame the drug seekers and
the DEA. Medical costs spiraling out of control? Blame patients who
demand too many tests. The medical profession never accepts personal
responsibility for anything, least of all for its often inhumane
treatment of its customers and the willingness of all those &quot;good
doctors&quot; out there to look the other way when it happens.

I don't doubt that doctors have to deal with drugs seekers, but it is
also clear that the majority of legitimate chronic pain patients report
being treated as a drug seeker, malingerer or psych case at some point
in their journey through the medical system. We know based on studies
that malingering is relatively rare (less than 2 percent) and
psychogenic pain near non-existsent (if it exists at all), less than 1
in 3000. I'll bet if a study was done determining the actual number of
drug seekers, it would be around 1 percent if that. Until some studies
are done, I'll continue to assume this whole &quot;drug-seeking&quot; thing is
just the usual excuse-making, moral panic apology for their abuse of
pain patients.

&gt; Some medicos put up a &quot;front&quot; to discourage this. Their message is
&gt; essentially &quot;We've heard all the jive, and we aren't buying any
&gt; bills of goods anymore&quot;. Some of these same medicos might render
&gt; proper treatment when presented with conclusive evidence of
&gt; a responsible patient with severe and/or chronic pain. In an ER
&gt; or other med setting. Other medicos (presumably a small minority)
&gt; have taken the &quot;front&quot; to ridiculous extremes.

It's not a &quot;front&quot; but a well-recognized mindset common to narcissists
and people with right wing authoritarian personality types. When such
individuals are put in positions of power, they have a tendency to
abuse people, who they consider to be beneath their contempt. Right
wing authoritariann types are common in our society, which is why we
have the president we have.

Dr Alan Chino talks about how doctors are actualy trained to behave
this way in his book &quot;Validate Your pain: Expsoing the Chronic Pain
Cover-up.&quot; It is definitely a must read for cp'ers.

&lt; http://www.amazon.com/Validate-Your-Exposing-Chronic-Cover-Up/dp/096734

When you read these things and think through them you will realize the
reason doctors treat us the way they do is simple: becasue they don't
like us, and because they can. We probably can't do anything about the
former, but we can do something about the latter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I've been assuming that the average medico is simply seeking to
&gt; maximize revenue whilst minimizing risk. They perceive risk largely
&gt; in both regulatory and moral aspects of dispensation of opioids.
&gt; Given that patient treatment, as a priority, comes third or lower,
&gt; there's a definite tendency to under-treat or even refuse treatment.
&gt; A tendency to paint all patients with the same &quot;Brush Of Suspicion&quot;.

&gt; That's a bunch different from Scalpel, who has likely given up
&gt; on effective treatment long ago and appears to be declaring
&gt; some kind of mutant &quot;war&quot; on pain patients.
">

Actually, Scalpel claims to treat some of his patients with narcotics,
and I believe him. You couldn't last in an ER forever if you *never*
prescribed pain meds. If nothing else, you would of necessity be forced
to use them on people who were literally screaming in agony, if only to
shut them up. What I don't believe is when he claims he has never
denied pain treatment to an &quot;honest&quot; patient, becasue you have only to
read his blog to realize he considers the majority of his patients to
be either dishonest, psych cases or whimps. If we could ask Stalin, he
would probably tell you he never victimized anyone who didn't deserve
it either.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; True or False:
&gt;  &quot;The majority of medicos are not true RVM's and don't even blog.&quot;
">

It is not a black and white situation, and can't be answered with a
simple true or false. In New York State, only 35 percent of doctors
have the request prescription pads to prescribe strong narcotics. That
means that right off the bat, 65 percent of doctors in NY are unwilling
to treat pain aggressively. Of the remaining 35 percent, many of them
will also not treat aggressively except in very clear cut cases.

I consider any doctor unwilling to treat pain to be a barbarian and a
fraud, so based on that staistic alone, never mind all the horror
stories I've heard, I would say most docs in NY state are willing to
allow their patients to suffer if not treat them abusively.

&gt; &quot;If you paint them all (The Med community at large) with the &quot;Scalpel

I am not painting every doctor with the same brush. I am criticizing
aspects of the medical system that are all too real and which need to
be challenged.

&gt; I assumed (perhaps incorrectly) that the intended audience was 1.)
&gt; and (directly or indirectly) 2.). Given a degree of polish and
&gt; objectivity, the blog could draw attention from certain non-

&gt; or other sympathetic folks who won't be the least bit interested
&gt; in what they perceive to be &quot;two extremists in a flame war&quot;.

&gt; Bottom line: From where I stand, it looks like a Catch-22. If the
&gt; *primary thrust* of the blog is ultra-confrontational stuff with
&gt; RVM's, then the audience, aside from some cp patients, will be
&gt; mostly RVM's. And those are precisely the critters that you cannot
&gt; reach. Their minds are closed on the subject. There's nothing that
&gt; you/I can say to them that won't be like water off the proverbial
&gt; duck's back.

The blog is aimed primarily at chronic pain patients, and not the
medical profession. I believe that the solution to our problem lies
with us waking up to the realities of our situation, and taking
responsibility as a group for making changes occur, rather than waiting
for sympathetic doctors to have another conference, committee, luncheon
or symposium discussing how something needs to be done within the next
20 years or so to get pain under control.

I think the time for calm, measured debate is over. This is a holocaust
in which millions of lives are being destroyed, and we need to speak
out loudly and forceably and inflame people's emotions to the point
that they are willing to rise up as a group and do something about it.
No one of us can tackle this problem on his own, and there is no
cavalry over the horizon we need to convince to come ride to the
rescue. We have to fight this battle ourselves. We have to put control
over what we will or will not put in our bodies back in our hands.

There are two kinds of doctors out there: those who recognize that
leaving other human beings writhing in agony is an abomination, and
everyone else. There is some interlap between the two groups, but for
the most part, the first group doesn't need a lecture from me, and the
other group is unapproachable. Since the first group isn't doing much
to tackle the problem, that leaves us.

My goal with Payne Hertz is to get people to recognize that doctors are
not gods, that we can and should have control over our own destinies
with regards to managing our pain, and we don't have to take all this
bullshit just to avoid upsetting the &quot;good doctors.&quot; The good doctors
are &quot;Good Germans&quot; who are looking the other way while our lives are
ruined. We need to move beyond begging with hat in hand for the medical
profession to do something for us and start doing for ourselves.

&gt; There might also be a question re the relevance of focusing on
&gt; -any- ER personnel. Most PM takes place in different settings.
&gt; For all I know, the average ER could see 10 'dumb kids' for

&gt; ER's only as a place to die.

I am not just addressing ER doctors, as these attitudes occur in other
specialties as well. I am addressing the entire system.

The unique thing about all these medblogs out there is that this is the
first time in history that doctors as a group have opened up their
thoughts and feelings to the general public, and the results have
been...appalling. Though doctors have of course written articles and
memoirs, these blogs are really very personal and most of them are just
rants about everything they hate, namely, their patients. These blogs

&gt;Hi folks,

&gt;I would really appreciate some comments on the blog about this one.
&gt;Once again, I've gotten into a scrap with Scalpel where he has revealed
&gt;my real name, and this is my response. One of the reasons I started the
&gt;blog was to highlight this kind of behavior, and Scalpel has certainly
&gt;been obliging in that regard. Not that my real name is any state
&gt;secret, but it's the principle of the thing. He has taken to moderating
&gt;his posts and refusing anonymous posts, so you rpobably can't respond
&gt;there.

&gt;The &quot;Old School&quot; has closed its doors forever. It used to be, back in
&gt;the day, that even punks and bullies had a code of honor, and if you
&gt;stood up to the bully, he would take his medicine like a man and that
&gt;would be the end of it. Nowadays, they come back with their crew and
&gt;machine-gun your entire family, or if the punk in question happens to
&gt;be a doctor, he will come back with his crew and try to destroy your
&gt;medical care by blacklisting you, or publishing your name on the
&gt;Internet in the hopes that other doctors will deny you treatment, or
&gt;simply to intimidate you into silence. The days when even enemies could
&gt;treat each other with honor and respect and there were rules of
&gt;engagement to be followed are over. Now, it seems, malignant narcissism
&gt;is the rule of the day, and there is no limit to the depths of
&gt;sleaziness and cant some people will sink to get revenge against
&gt;someone for &quot;dissing&quot; them. Drive-by-shooting or medical sabotage, the
&gt;goal, and the mindset underlying it, are the same.

&gt;Case in point: the author of Scalpel and Sword, a patient-bashing site
&gt;by an &quot;ER doc in Texas,&quot; has twice responded to my criticism of his
&gt;hate-filled articles about chronic pain patients by revealing my real
&gt;name on his blog and on other blogs. In his latest outing, he has
&gt;called on ER docs in my area to be on their guard around me, as if I am
&gt;some dangerous criminal. I don't need to explain to anyone who has been
&gt;shut out by the &quot;Good Ole Boy&quot; network for speaking out what the effect
&gt;of this is likely to be. Scalpel has boasted on his website of
&gt;violating the HIPAA laws by blacklisting patients, and has admitted to
&gt;making people in pain wait in the ER or denying them treatment
&gt;altogether for failing to show him proper respect, so this kind of
&gt;behavior is hardly out of character for him. There is a code of conduct
&gt;among bloggers where we respect people's anonymity and right to
&gt;confidentiality, as we often know the names, e-mail addresses and IP
&gt;addresses of people who visit our blogs, even when they post
&gt;anonymously. It's abundantly clear that Scalpel has no more respect for
&gt;this code than he does for the right of his patients to confidentiality
&gt;under the HIPAA laws, or their right to be treated with dignity and
&gt;respect. It is a fundamental tenet of medical ethics that a doctor
&gt;should respect patient confidentiality and should &quot;do no harm&quot; and it
&gt;is readily apparent that Scalpel, like far too many doctors nowadays,
&gt;has no respect for these standards. Though I am obviously not Scalpel's
&gt;patient (thank God for small miracles), one would expect similar
&gt;conduct from a true doctor even in non-medical contexts. Scalpel
&gt;obviously disagrees.

&gt;Scalpel is also in violation of Google's Terms of Service/Content
&gt;policy, which states:

&gt;    PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION: We do not allow the
&gt;unauthorized publishing of people's private and confidential
&gt;information, such as credit card numbers, Social Security Numbers, and
&gt;driver's and other license numbers.

&gt;Needless to say, Scalpel has no respect for the policy under which
&gt;Google generously allows him and other bloggers to express their views
&gt;for free.

&gt;In his latest post, Scalpel is responding to my article entitled &quot;More
&gt;ER Asshattery&quot; where I address many of the fallacies presented in his
&gt;article on the numeric 1 to 10 Pain Scale and a related article where
&gt;he proposes an alternate pain scale. He then responds to my criticism
&gt;by revealing my real name and accusing me of having a &quot;revenge fantasy&quot;
&gt;against doctors. I hope you will forgive me for not repeating my real
&gt;name here or linking to the original article, as I obviously don't want
&gt;to paint a roadmap to this info, though in fact any narcissistic ER doc
&gt;with a little downtime in between abusing patients could probably find
&gt;this info in the same manner Scalpel did:

&gt;    Courtesy of [my name omitted], a chronic pain sufferer in [my state
&gt;omitted] who used to be anonymously known as Redhawk but who now blogs
&gt;under the pseudonym Payne Hertz. I won't link him, but with a little
&gt;internet sleuthery you can find his whiny blog yourself, if you are so
&gt;inclined. He thought I was on the wrong track with my pain scales, so
&gt;he came up with this:

&gt;After which he quotes my tongue-in-cheek pain scale and accuses me of a
&gt;revenge fantasy. While my humor may be a little offensive and over the
&gt;top to some, it is just that, humor, and not a call to violence against
&gt;doctors. No unethical, arrogant doctors were harmed in the production
&gt;of Payne Hertz that I'm aware of, though Scalpel's ego has obviously
&gt;gotten a good bruising. Interestingly, he posts a &quot;revenge fantasy&quot; of
&gt;his own, though in fact revenge is no fantasy for him but a real life
&gt;activity he engages in regularly, as evidenced by his blog and the
&gt;behavior I am describing here. This is a guy who has boasted of
&gt;inflicting pain and suffering on his patients and attempting to
&gt;sabotage their medical care, and he is attempting to do the same to me.

&gt;    [My name omitted], I would love for you to try that out sometime.
&gt;But my question for you is, if you are already at a &quot;level 10&quot; from
&gt;your chronic mystery pain and someone were to hypothetically spray you
&gt;in the eyes with pepper spray, stab you in the neck with a pencil, or
&gt;break your elbow by vigorously hyperextending it, would that not bother
&gt;you at all because you're already maxed out, or would your pain level
&gt;go up to a 15 or so? Just wondering.

&gt;My advice to Scalpel would be to stick to what you know and continue to
&gt;backstab your patients in the manner you're accustomed to. Direct
&gt;physical confrontation with your latest victim might not be in your
&gt;best interest, and you might find out the hard way what level 10 pain
&gt;feels like.

&gt;Interestingly, in a classic case of projection, Scalpel quotes an ER
&gt;nurse blog complaining of patients with &quot;personality disorders&quot; and how
&gt;tiresome they can be:

&gt;    I have seen a couple of people get out of control when they didn't
&gt;get their narcs. I read an article in emergency medicine magazine that
&gt;takes about a doctors role in treated chronic pain in the emergency
&gt;setting. What's fascinating about it is that the author says that 50%
&gt;of chronic pain sufferers have personality disorders or affective
&gt;disorders. I can vouch for that. They wear you out, the people who come
&gt;in for chronic pain because they are people who are neurotic and
&gt;difficult to work with. Antidepressants have been found to be very
&gt;helpful in these people, along with psychological help. They seldom get
&gt;it.

&gt;It has been my personal experience reading and hearing hundreds of
&gt;stories from abused chronic pain patients that those doctors who are
&gt;most willing to play amateur psychologist by branding their patients
&gt;with the &quot;personality disorder&quot; label are the ones most likely to be
&gt;suffering from severe personality disorders themselves. After all, what
&gt;kind of personality does it take to blacklist a patient and willfully
&gt;sabotage his or her medical care because you perceived him to be
&gt;manipulative or disrespectful to you, or to leave another human being
&gt;writhing in agony by refusing to treat his pain? Or for that matter, to
&gt;violate a blogger's right to blog anonymously? Maybe it's this kind of
&gt;personality:

&gt;    Their lack of self respect is even more damning. Because of it,
&gt;nothing is beneath them. No lie is too mean to tell. No trick is too
&gt;lowdown, dirty, and rotten to play. Things you or I couldn't stoop to,
&gt;because sinking to that level would make us feel like we are wallowing
&gt;naked on our bellies in sewage, narcissists glory in like mud-wallowing
&gt;hogs. Ironic, isn't it? that such deep, unbearable shame makes one
&gt;shameless? But it does.

&gt;    ...This is why every malignant narcissist has two middle names: one
&gt;is &quot;Abuser&quot; and the other is &quot;Slanderer.&quot;

&gt;Scalpel certainly fits the bill on all counts, particularly as abuser
&gt;and slanderer and willing to low crawl where most people wouldn't dare
&gt;to go, all because his ego got bruised.

&gt;Here is where Scalpel plunges the knife:

&gt;    Indeed. If anyone reading this happens to work in an Emergency
&gt;Department in [state omitted] and is unfortunate enough to come across
&gt;this gentleman....you might want to guard your nuts.

&gt;This is an unequivocal attempt by Scalpel to libel me and sabotage my
&gt;medical care, and an attempt to intimidate me into silence. I can
&gt;promise you, it will have the opposite effect. It is sad that a doctor
&gt;with a so-called code of ethics would feel the need to sink to this
&gt;level, but this kind of thing happens all the time. If it weren't for
&gt;the high prevalence of ruthless, amoral and egotistical doctors like
&gt;Scalpel, Payne Hertz wouldn't exist. While I have no intention of
&gt;sinking to his level by revealing his real name, location or place of
&gt;employment, Scalpel might do well to heed the warning some other people
&gt;have made to him about karma, because he's got a lot to lose if his
&gt;real identity was ever revealed, and he most definitely has it coming
&gt;to him. The next person he screws over might be a hacker looking for
&gt;some payback.
