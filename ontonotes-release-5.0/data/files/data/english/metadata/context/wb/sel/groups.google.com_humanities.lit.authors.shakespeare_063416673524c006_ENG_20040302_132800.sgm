________________________________________________________________

Strats, unlike Oxfordians, have 'authorship evidence,' but it's
exactly the evidence Strats would require if they were making
the case that Shakspear was brokering plays for a poet writing
under the stigma of print.

Strats have a name printed on title pages and the rest
a miscellany muddled by the selective censorship of Whitgift
and the bitterly envious trickstering of Jonson.

This weak, purely inferential evidence, is the reason the
Oxfordians, armed only with the most superficial and subjective
evidence, are rapidly gaining on Strats.

Strats have responded by making William Shakspear a Catholic
(he was a Catholic) but Strats will sooner or later have to admit
what the seminarians who edited the (great) Catholic Encyclopedia
were correct:

The Shakespeare works are mildly anti-Catholic.

This does not help the Oxfordians because the Jesuits at the
English College at Rome have Oxford's records of reconciliation with
the Roman Catholic Church (Fr. Thomas McCoog, S.J. in
The Catholic Historical Review 87.2. 2001).

In strategically damaging the Renaissance philosopher Francis Bacon
(an ugly, lying campaign minutely documented by the Spanish scholar
Nieves Matthew in History of A Character Assassination, Yale University
Press, 1999) Strats have removed the single obstacle to Oxford's
authorship--his genius cousin Francis.

Delia Bacon: Hawthorne's Last Heroine* by Nina Baym

&lt;&lt; Delia Bacon had been victimized in a nasty little scandal
that fractured the New Haven Congregational community in 1847. Her
brother Leonard Bacon, a minister, formally accused Alexander McWhorter,
also a minister, of attempting to evade an engagement with Delia Bacon
by defaming her. Leonard was backed by the town clergy,

McWhorter by the YALE faculty.

The evidence supported Leonard's claim, but the church proceedings
that followed produced only the equivalent of a slap on the wrist
for the culprit and exposed Delia Bacon to public humiliation.&gt;&gt;

Exactly! To show Shakespeare was a play-broker, I would look for contemporary
testimony that he was a poet, actor and playwright! I would look for his name
on title-pages! I would look for his picture in a book of plays said to have
been written by him. I would look for a monument to a great poet with his name
and death date on it! Having found all these things, I would know he had to
have been a play-broker.

Wait. First I'd have to make sure that there was no evidence that he was a
play-broker!

Okay, I'm willing to do all this, Elizabeth. Are you willing to show why Bacon
wasn't an essay-broker?

The Stratford actor's documents look like the play-brokering, pandering,

As Franklin B. Williams amply demonstrates in his
collection of 15,000 literary dedications collected from
between 1560 and 1642, a name on title pages was
meaningless in that era of stigma of print.

Oxford is the only authorship candidate who was not
bothered by the stigma of print. That, and the fact that
Oxfordians have no smoking gun, disqualifies Oxford
from Shakespeare authorship.

The gentry, i.e., 'gentle' Shakepseare, wrote behind
initials, masks, classical author pseudonyms ('Vergil'),
fake names, their husband's names, and variations of
Anon. and Anonymous. There was a stigma of print,
Grumman.

Shakspear was obviously terrified by the stigma of print
and didn't sign his name to anything for over ten
years--it was all By Anonymous until he rashly put his name
on the treasonous Richard II Q2--rather odd timing.

Marlowe put his name on nothing until a year after his own
death and Bacon wouldn't even publish his acknowledged
works under his own name. Almost nothing was published
of Bacon's in his life time--he preferred to circulate it in
manuscripts among the Court coteries and on the Continent.
The reason we've lost so much of Bacon's work--well, he was
a genius. He didn't have to revise.

That's just what I'm saying, Elizabeth! If one of Shakespeare's contemporaries
had said, &quot;My friend Will Shakespeare is an excellent playwright,&quot; (while
Shakespeare was alive, of course), then we would have cause to think he was a
poet. But all we have are Shakespeare's contemporaries saying, more or less,
&quot;Shakespeare is an excellent playwright,&quot; which is near-proof that he was a
play-broker.

At the risk of self-promotion, let me note that the only thing that
&quot;Price demonstrated to stunned Strats&quot; was her modest ability to
manipulate data. As I show in my review of her book, the unbiased
application of her own criteria to Shakespeare of Stratford gives him
as good a literary paper trail as any of his contemporaries.

-- More academics coming out for Oxford.
Lax Strat response. If Nelson had
been writing for the Oxfordians his book would be
promoted. Strats ignored it.
-- More authorship interest in the newspapers.
-- Many more books on Oxford.
-- Plays being written about Oxford.
-- Oxfordians organized like a religion--a messianic
drive to 'convert.'
--'Authorship' being taught in high school and college
lit classes.
-- Veres and De Veres out there pitching for Oxford (can they
really believe it?) --speaking at universities, on television.
-- Increasing number of Oxfordian websites--up 2,000+ since I
las checked. More .edu pages--currently over 600.
-- Some of the more prominent lit crit profs hinting that they
are for Oxford, i.e., Garber and Vendler.

I seriously doubt that but I'll definitely take a look.

I would guess that you've never looked into the Baconian evidence.
I subjected Bacon to Price's CPLE and Bacon aced it. For a

works without being fired--Bacon's father was evicted from the
Privy Council for writing a book--Bacon's contemporaries had
much to say about his concealed literary activities.

The point is that it looks nothing like the Stratford

Garber wrote a mildly anti-Stratfordian paper or book

Sorry, but it's called the &quot;Asbourne Portrait&quot; of

She just prefers the Asbourne portrait of
'Shakespeare'. It has a high forehead. It's
Elizabethan (more-or-less). He's quite good-

aristocratic. What more could anyone
want for a portrait of the great Bard?

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's almost certainly a portrait of Hugh Hamersley,

&gt;&gt; Why would Garber put up a jpg of Hugh Hamersley?

&gt; Sorry, but it's called the &quot;Asbourne Portrait&quot; of
&gt; Shakespeare. It was 'produced' to be yet another
&gt; picture of Shakespeare, since the image in the
&gt; Folio doesn't begin to look like a human being,
&gt; and we are all desperate to know what the true

&gt; No one knows what the Stratford grain-

The Strats don't claim that portrait.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The statistics on academic opinion on the &quot;authorship question&quot;
currently stand about as follows:

The Stratford Grain Merchant 99.9%
Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxenford 0.1%
The Renaissance Genius Francis Bacon 0.0%

If Stratfordians should be &quot;alarmed&quot; by the drop in their candidate's
support (perhaps he was at 99.99% ten years ago), what ought a
Baconian to be feeling?

An excellent question! A simple query regarding Elizabeth's supposed
sources almost always elicits a torrent of unintentional comedy of the
highest order.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Google brought up 300 academic pages for 'earl of oxford'
&gt; + 'de vere.'

"/>

Elizabeth's notion of an &quot;academic page&quot; is most amusing!
Apparently, to her it means any page with an .edu domain name! For
quite a while there was a well-known eccentric employed as a dishwasher
by an Ivy League institution who promulgated his &quot;Atom Totality&quot; theory,
a bizarre brand of alternative physics asserting (among many other
things) that the entire universe is a single atom of plutonium, that the
protons in that single atom's nucleus are the Greek gods of antiquity
whom we should all praise, etc.) on his .edu web site. According to
Elizabeth, this would qualify as an &quot;academic&quot; page.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Searched English pages for &quot;de vere&quot;&quot;earl of oxford&quot; site:.edu.
&gt; Results 1 - 100 of about 300

"/>

Did Elizabeth actually *examine* this putative plethora of evidence?
Of course not! I just performed the very Google search suggested by
Elizabeth, and the results (summarized below) are most entertaining.

The first two hits,

&lt;&gt; and
&lt;&gt;,

are from Prof. Alan Nelson's web site. Nelson is not exactly teaching
alternative authorship courses, as even Elizabeth is presumably aware.

The third hit,

&lt;&gt;,

is not exactly indicative of authorship being taught in colleges either.
In fact, the page concludes with &quot;Written by: Barbara Van Duyn&quot;. A
quick check of &lt;&gt;
confirms that Barbara Van Duyn is not a member of the faculty of Calvin
College. More interestingly, a look at

&lt;&gt;

shows that Ms. Van Duyn's page is only one of many student projects,
submitted by students of English 346A during Fall 1998 at Calvin
College. If one actually *reads* these papers, as Elizabeth quite
plainly has *not* done, one finds that, for example, another student
named Jamie Dillon submitted a project called &quot;Shakespeare's Twins&quot;
which refers explicitly to the twins Hamnet and Judith Shakespeare --
clearly, Mr. Dillon is not discussing the Earl of Oxford here. The
student project of Sarah Kinney discusses Shakespeare's marriage with
Anne Hathaway and his family in Stratford. Plainly, Ms. Kinney is not
discussing the Earl of Oxford either. In fact, a visit to
&lt;&gt; affords links to
the student projects submitted in English 346 for three years in
succession, projects from which it becomes quite plain that English 346
is a pretty standard Shakespeare course, not a course dealing with crank
alternative authorship theories. That one student submits a paper
dealing with one such crank theory is not surprising; in particular, it
certainly does not suggest that Oxfordians are taken seriously by
Shakespeare scholars.

The fourth hit from Elizabeth's Google search is merely another link
to Baraba Van Duyn's student project in English 346.

The fifth hit is a post to an online forum, Exlibris (for those
interested in rare books and manuscripts, special library collections,
etc.) that happens to be hosted by a server at Stanford; it is not an
&quot;academic page&quot; by any stretch of the imagination (even by a stretch of
Elizabeth's hallucinatorily vivid imagination), and the reference to
Oxford was posted by &quot;John Barton&quot;&lt;bartonlan ... @free.net.nz&gt;, who may
or may not possess any academic affiliation.

The sixth hit,
&lt;
ml&gt;, is the page of one Kristin Hall, a former college music major who
now evidently works in a lab at MIT. Ms. Hall has placed some of her
family's genealogy online, and the page in question appears to be one of
several genealogical charts. The chart makes no mention whatever of
Shakespeare. Nor, for that matter, does it ever mention Edward de Vere,
the Earl of Oxford to whom a handful of harmless eccentrics attribute
the Shakespeare canon. Rather, the Veres mentioned therein include
Aubrey de Vere, Hugh de Vere, and two Robert de Veres, both Earls of
Oxford, but unfortunately a mere three centuries too early for
Elizabeth's purposes. So much for Elizabeth's charminly naïve belief
that Ms. Hall's is an &quot;academic&quot; page, or that it even remotely suggests
the increasing appearance of crank authorship theories in college
courses.

The seventh hit is a page of Michael Delahoyde, a Senior Instructor
at Washington State University. This is the *only* hit on the list thus
far even remotely reminiscent of an &quot;academic page.&quot;

The next hit is merely another reference to Mr. Delahoyde's pages.

The ninth hit is a submission to a Call for Papers mailing list
hosted by a server at U. Penn. However, the submission itself comes
from the Rev. Prof. Dr. Daniel Wright, Ph.d., of Concordia, a well-known
authorship eccentric who has been flogging the same dead horse for many
years. In particular, his submission of a call for papers to his annual
Edward de Vere Studies Conference at Concordia is certainly no
indication that academics are taking Oxfordians more seriously; as
noted, Wright has been doing this for years. (This is the same Dr.
Wright who approved and therefore presumably read Dr. Stritmatter's
thesis, apparently without ever noticing any of the copious, hilarious
howlers therein, including the now celebrated confusion of Mary Tudor
with Mary Queen of Scots.)

The tenth hit is a newsletter item from the University of Washington
concerning Brame and Popova's amusing book. Both Brame and Popova are
linguists; neither, as far as I am aware and can ascertain, possesses
any expertise in Elizabethan literary history, and I see no indication
that any academic researcher with expertise in the area is viewing the
Brame/Popova book as anything other than a joke. Nor can I find any
indication that either Brame or Popova teaches Shakespeare, let alone
teaches a course on Shakespeare authorship.

The next two hits, of which
&lt;&gt; is typical, are pages
hosted by Virginia Millitary Institute. For more of the same, one can
visit &lt;&gt;, and to see
these pages in context, &lt;&gt;.
I quote from the page in question:

&quot;The General Education Pilot Project for Spring 1998 comprised four
different areas of research. Seventeen History majors investigated
four mysteries and controversies under the direction of Profs. David
Rachels (English), Rose Mary Sheldon (History), Karl Sienerth
(Chemistry), and Gordon Williams (Mathematics): the Mystery of
Dinosaur DNA; the Mystery of the Pyramids; the Kennedy Assassination;
and the Shakespeare Authorship Question. Each of the four issues had
a strong interdisciplinary component. The question of dinosaur DNA
fingerprinting and cloning focused primarily on chemistry, but
students also read _Jurassic Park_ in conjunction with their
experiments. The mystery of the construction of the pyramids blended
history, mathematics, and chemistry (see the link 'Were the Pyramids
Made of Concrete?' below). The Kennedy assassination controversy
involved history and the mathematics of trajectories. And the
Shakespeare Authorship Question involved literature, history, and the
mathematics of cyphers.&quot;

While some of the students in the program have written papers
enthusiastically endorsing Oxfordian authorship theories, I can find no
indication that the institution itself or any of its faculty endorses
any alternative authorship theory. Indeed, VMI's &quot;Shakespeare &amp;
Renaissance Home Page&quot; at
&lt;&gt; contains only
conventional &quot;Stratfordian&quot; references (one of them is to the excellent
page &quot;Shakespeare and His Critics,&quot;&lt;&gt;, of
h.l.a.s.'s own Thomas Larque, an outspoken and articulate
&quot;Stratfordian&quot;). In particular, the profile of Lt. Col. David Rachels,
who supervised the cadets' investigation of the &quot;controversial&quot;
authorship question, furnishes no indication that Lt. Col. Rachels is
sympathetic to Oxfordian theories. Nor is there any indication that he
possesses any expertise in the area: his interests are listed as
Southern literature, Civil War literature, American humor, the short
story, bad poetry, and the blues. If Lt. Col. Rachels is indeed an
Oxfordian (and I can find no indication whatever that he is -- employing
Elizabeth's own method, a Google search for &quot;David Rachels&quot; and &quot;Vere&quot;
returns a single lone hit, and an utterly irrelevant one, at that),
perhaps his interest in Oxford arose naturally from his interest in bad
poetry.

The next hit, &lt;&gt;, is
an essay by University of Wisconsin student Chris St. Peter, reviewing
C. Richard Desper and Gary c. Vezzoli¹s ³A Statistical Approach to the
Shakespeare Authorship Question,² _The Elizabethan Review_, Fall 1993.
It suffices to quote the essay's concluding sentence:

&quot;It is for this reason that the article must be taken skeptically,
as the weight of the evidence found by inductive statistical logic
doesn¹t tip the scale in de Vere¹s favor.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Garber's portrait of Oxford is still on her Harvard webpage.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~laa41/&gt;

&gt; There's even a link to the online *Oxford* English Dictionary, clinching
&gt; your identification!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Vendler's link to the main Oxfordian site has been taken
&gt;&gt;&gt; down but it had been there for several years before I posted
&gt;&gt;&gt; on it in HLAS. Of course Vendler noticed it. Do you think
&gt;&gt;&gt; she wouldn't check out her own website?

&gt; I think whoever put it there was dishonest (probably some Oxfordian
hacker),
&gt; and I think the fact that the link was very tiny and hidden out of the way
&gt; supports the notion that she did not know it was there. University
&gt; professors aren't, as a rule, egomainiacs who slavishly edit their Web
&gt; sites, which are usually maintained by their university.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I doubt that you can intimidate Garber into removing
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford's portrait but give it a try, Reedy.

&gt; And what power would I have to intimidate anybody?

&gt; You know what I think?

&gt; I wonder whether you are retarded or just mentally ill, or possibly both.
&gt; One thing I do know: you are probably the most dishonest person who has
ever
&gt; posted on hlas.

I retract and apologize for my remark about retardation. That is an insult
to the people who are stricken with mental retardation and I am sorry I
wrote it. My other two points stand.

&gt;&gt; It's almost certainly a portrait of Hugh Hamersley,
&gt;&gt; Lord Mayor of London. It was altered at some
&gt;&gt; point to appear more 'Shakespeare-like' -- with a
&gt;&gt; high forehead. Some Oxfordians think that it's
&gt;&gt; really a portrait of Oxford. But then,you can
&gt;&gt; imagine almost anything with anonymous
&gt;&gt; portraits -- with the aid of a little credulousness.

Amazingly, many of the &quot;academic pages&quot; to which Elizabeth alludes

Evidently it's just another of her bizarre fantasies -- not unlike
her fantasies about J.-P. Hsu, Akrigg, Rips, Dogariu, Kuzmich, and Wang,
etc.

It's really pretty remarkable to find multiple instances of prominent
people *explicitly* saying *exactly the opposite* of what Elizabeth
hallucinates that they think -- but that circumstance merely underscores
starkly how tenuous Elizabeth's connection with the real world actually

Yes, it's in exactly the same spirit as her claim concerning
Professor J.-P. Hsu. Incredibly, Elizabeth evidently doesn't believe
what people like Vendler, Hsu, Rips, etc. say *themsevles*, even when
they express themselves as unequivocally as in the following instances:

(1)
&quot;...our work on Taiji Relativity is not a repudiation of Einstein's
work at all. As you know, abundant experimental evidence exists
showing the utility of special relativity for predicting and
explaining physical phenomena. [...]

&quot;I do feel that trying to argue with cranks is hopeless task

[Plainly, he is quite right.]

and in fact, that arguing with them might inadvertently lend them
some legitimacy in some people's eyes.... I can only hope that
readers of her posts will take note of the source and view her
claims about the work of others in a skeptical light.&quot;

(2)
&quot;Our experiment is *not* at odds with Einstein's special relativity.
The experiment can be well explained using existing physics theories
that are consistent with Relativity. In fact, the experiment was
designed based on calculations using existing physics theories.&quot;
[Emphasis in the original]

(3)
&quot;It all adds up to one thing: nothing would be less surprising
than to learn that during certain periods of his early life
Southampton passed through homosexual phases but, until better
evidence is found, only a fool will declare that he did.&quot;

(4)
&quot;PUBLIC STATEMENT BY DR. ELIYAHU RIPS Professor of Mathematics Hebrew
University Jerusalem, Israel

I have seen Michael Drosnin's book _The Bible Code_.

1) There is indeed serious scientific research being conducted with
regard to the Bible Codes.

2) While I did meet and talk to Mr. Drosnin, I did not do joint work
with him.

3) I do not support Mr. Drosnin's work on the Codes, nor the
conclusions he derives.

4) There is an impression that I was involved in finding the code
relating to Prime Minister Rabin's assassination.  This is not true.

5) However, I did witness, in 1994, Mr. Drosnin find the tableaux
about Prime Minister Rabin, which now appears on the cover of his
book.

6) For me, it was a catalyst to ask whether we can, from a scientific
point of view, attempt to use the Codes to predict future events.
After much thought, my categorical answer is no.  All attempts to
extract messages from Torah codes, or to make predictions based on
them, are futile and are of no value. This is not only my own
opinion, but the opinion of every scientist who has been involved
in serious Codes research.&quot;

Elizabeth's wilful, even perverse disregard for the unequivocally
expressed -- indeed, sometimes quite forcefully expressed -- opinions of
people like Hsu, Akrigg, Dogariu, Kuzmich, Wang, etc. certainly make
Elizabeth look like a fool. She need not, of course, share those
opinions, but only a cretin would deny that those persons indeed
expressed the views quoted explicitly above.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Garber's portrait of Oxford is still on her Harvard webpage.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~laa41/&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; There's even a link to the online *Oxford* English Dictionary, clinching
&gt;&gt;&gt; your identification!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vendler's link to the main Oxfordian site has been taken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; down but it had been there for several years before I posted
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on it in HLAS. Of course Vendler noticed it. Do you think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she wouldn't check out her own website?
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think whoever put it there was dishonest (probably some Oxfordian
&gt; hacker),
&gt;&gt;&gt; and I think the fact that the link was very tiny and hidden out of the
&gt; way
&gt;&gt;&gt; supports the notion that she did not know it was there.
&gt;&gt; That's conjecture, Reedy. Support for the Stratfraudian
&gt;&gt; candidate is soft in academia and you know it.
&gt; More ignorant pontification (don't you ever get tired of it?).

"/>

Apparently, it's the only type of pontification she's capable of, so
one presumes that the fact she never appears to tire of it is merely a
matter of making a virtue of necessity.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In
&gt; twenty-four years I've never met a single colleague who even supposes there
&gt; to be a genuine question about Shakespeare's authorship. Perhaps you
&gt; imagine that support for an oblate spheroid Earth is soft among
&gt; geophysicists, too.

"/>

Perhaps so. She *certainly* believes that support for special
relativity is soft among physicists:

&quot;What you're missing, Kennedy, is that qualified physicists
are still harranging [sic]

[Elizabeth's colorful neologisms alone make her posts worth reading.]

about Einstein's coordinates, flashing lights, platforms,
elevators, rockets, twins, porters as if it were 1905. Go to
any Usenet physics form [sic] and see for yourself.&quot;

&lt;&gt;

Remarkably, Elizabeth *actually believes* that &quot;qualified physicists&quot;
engage in serious discussions of cutting-edge theoretical physics in
unmoderated Usenet newsgroups! One would think that even a cursory
perusal of h.l.a.s. would have long since disabused Elizabeth of the
bizarre notion that the community of Shakespeare scholars discusses much
serious scholarly work here; the situation is, if anything, even starker
in mathematics and physics, whose unmoderated newsgroups harbor ignorant
cranks whose nonsensical fulminations drown out the sensible posters,
resulting in a near-zero signal-to-noise ratio.

Elizabeth continues in a followup:

&quot;Physicists post on Usenet, Kennedy and you can verify that
by going to their webpages on .edu sites.&quot;

Remarkably, Elizabeth *still* has not figured out that not everybody who
posts from an .edu domain on physics is a physicist! Indeed, it appears
to have escaped Elizabeth's attention completely that the number of .edu
accounts that belong to students, secretaries, janitors, dishwashers,
librarians, bookkeepers, adminstrative assistants, computer support
staff, grounds personnel, campus police, and other campus staff dwarfs
the number of faculty accounts. Indeed, the post in which Elizabeth
reports triumphantly upon the outcome of her Google search (for &quot;Oxford&quot;
and &quot;de Vere&quot; at .edu domains) is one of the funniest I have ever read!

As I wrote the last time she spouted this nonsense, I would like to
see Elizabeth find a reasonable number of Usenet posts from reputable
physicists affiliated with research universities asserting that special
relativity is wrong. However, we all know by now that Wayback doesn't
have a search function yet, and that Elizabeth would be incapable of
using one even if it existed, so I'm not going to hold my breath.

The question is merely whether Delahoyde is qualified to

Gayley's theory that the Strachey letter is found in
The Tempest. What other 'Strachey theory' is there?
There's a mention of 'Strachy' in Twelfth Night but as
we all know, Twelfth Night was written for the Inns of Court
and ONLY a member of an Inn was permitted to write
plays for the Inns. Since there is a record of Bacon's
friendship with William Strachey--Strachey dedicated his
'Travailles Into Virginia Britannica' to his 'friend Sir Francis Bacon,'
we can conclude that Bacon wrote the allusion to 'Strachy' in
Twelfth Night. Oxford didn't know Strachey and Kathman certainly
has not proven that the Stratford grain merchant ever knew him.

As Dr. Webb would say, &quot;Huh?!&quot; Baconian conspiracy theories had a much
higher profile in years past than today. (Not that it ever seriously
threatened the orthodox view that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare, of course.)
Popular writers such as Holmes could throw in a passing reference to the
Bacon as Shakespeare cult in their books (see Holmes' book &quot;Over The
Teacups&quot;) and expect the reader to understand it. You've read Alain C.
White's comments from the 1916 Pittsburgh chess column I've posted. Again,
White expected his readers to get the reference.

It would be an interesting research project to map the rise and fall of
Baconianism, from D. Bacon's book to the Weir-bot. It would be a study in
public reaction to the Baconian nuttiness, a history of the movement. Any
chance I can get a grant for it?

Is this the same thing as saying that medium varies degree of attenuation?
And I presume that the 'light' in your citation is between 400 and 750
nanonmeters, rather than invoking all radiation x-ray through far IR? (from
0.2 to 30 microns?)

One can in fact increase apparent speed within the photopic spectrum by
interupting a wave-path by the non-transmissive means of a modified [&amp;
super-cooled] fabry-perot barrier, comparing it to an uninterupted path. The
first instance registers arrival of a photon before the second over the same
path-length at the detector (in 7 from 10 instances), however, in the first
instance the shape of the photon is changed, becoming blunted into a
whale-like formation, rather than the uninterupted 'torpedo' of the later
'natural' photon envelope, and one measures only photon receptivity of a
given plano-detector.

However, and since you both discuss Bacon, is he not responsible for
suggesting principally /method/ as means of modern scientific investigation,
and specifically not limiting method to Aristotlian procedure? It is a very
interesting question, and probably more provocative of our modern situation
[at least by volume of work undertaken as a result] than any of the Works of
the Author.

Together, these two chaps considered as meta-practitioners, and within the

As physicists realized well before Einstein, merely enunciating the
principle of relativity does *NOT* suffice, as the relativity principle
enjoyed by Newtonian mechanics is flatly inconsistent with Maxwell's
electrodynamics. Indeed, Maxwell's equations predict a *specific*,
computable velocity of electromagnetic radiation. The question becomes:
in what reference frame do Maxwell's equations hold? They *cannot* be
valid in *all* reference frames (which can be in relative motion) as
required by the relativity principle, at least if Newtonian velocity
addition is to hold, since two Newtonian observers in reference frames
in relative motion will measure different velocities of light -- yet
Maxwell's equations predict a *specific* velocity.

Thus Newtonian mechanics and the relativity principle were mutually
contradictory -- until Einstein's beautifully simply reformulation of
kinematics *restored* the principle of relativity that Maxwell's
equations had banished from Newtonian mechanics. The problem lay
squarely in Newtonian kinematics, and Einstein was the first to grasp
this simple point.

I have of course explained this at length many times, but since you
have never studied mathematics or physics (or apparently anything else,
for that matter) at even the most rudimentary level, explanations are
wasted on you; perhaps someone else might be slightly interested, though.

I don't have Akrigg's book handy, but I know that the source
for the story about Southampton having sexual relations
with a man in a tent in Ireland is a letter by William Reynolds,
a former soldier who became mentally ill (probably schizophrenic,
in modern parlance) and wrote many letters in the 1590s to
Lord Burghley and other government officials, letters which survive
because they were put into what amounts to a &quot;nutcase file&quot;.
Reynolds is the one who wrote to Burghley in 1593, a few
months after Shakespeare's *Venus and Adonis* was published,
because he was convinced that the poem had been published
to make Queen Elizabeth fall in love with him. (See Katherine
Duncan-Jones, &quot;Much Ado with Red and White: The Earliest
Readers of Shakespeare's *Venus and Adonis* (1593)&quot;, Review
of English Studies 44 (1993), 479-501.) In a letter from about
1598, Reynolds wrote that while in Ireland, Southampton slept in
a tent with Piers Edmondes, a fellow officer, and that &quot;the
earle Sowthampton would cole [embrace] and huge [hug]
him in his armes and play wantonly wth him.&quot; Reynolds is
not exactly a reliable source, though it's not impossible that
he was reporting an actual rumor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;It all adds up to one thing: nothing would be less surprising

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton passed through homosexual phases but, until better
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence is found, only a fool will declare that he did.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton was twenty-seven when he was caught in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; act sodomizing one of his inferiors in a tent in Ireland. That hardly
&gt;&gt;&gt; qualifies as 'passing through a phase in a period of his early life.'
&gt;&gt; But you claimed that *Akrigg's book* was one of the sources for
&gt;&gt; Southampton's putative homosexuality! Of course, you had never *read*
&gt;&gt; Akrigg, as soon became abundantly clear, the best response you could
&gt;&gt; muster being &quot;Why else would a site on queer studies have a book on
&gt;&gt; Southampton listed in the biography [sic]?&quot;

&gt;&gt; Where, precisely, does Akrigg say anything about Southampton being
&gt;&gt;&quot;caught in the act sodomizing one of his inferiors in a tent in
&gt;&gt; Ireland&quot;? Can you supply a page number? I thought not.

&gt;&gt; In fact, what *is* the source of your claim about Southampton being

&gt; I don't have Akrigg's book handy, but I know that the source
&gt; for the story about Southampton having sexual relations
&gt; with a man in a tent in Ireland is a letter by William Reynolds,
&gt; a former soldier who became mentally ill (probably schizophrenic,
&gt; in modern parlance) and wrote many letters in the 1590s to
&gt; Lord Burghley and other government officials, letters which survive
&gt; because they were put into what amounts to a &quot;nutcase file&quot;.

"/>

I see -- the Elizabeth Weird file, in other words.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Reynolds is the one who wrote to Burghley in 1593, a few

&gt; Readers of Shakespeare's *Venus and Adonis* (1593)&quot;, Review
&gt; of English Studies 44 (1993), 479-501.) In a letter from about
&gt; 1598, Reynolds wrote that while in Ireland, Southampton slept in
&gt; a tent with Piers Edmondes, a fellow officer, and that &quot;the
&gt; earle Sowthampton would cole [embrace] and huge [hug]
&gt; him in his armes and play wantonly wth him.&quot; Reynolds is
&gt; not exactly a reliable source,

By Elizabeth's standards, he is probably an unimpeachable source --

I have answered it many times, and in great detail. That Hsu's
theory extends and generalizes Einstein's theory does not mean that the
former's theory is in any sense a repudiation of the latter's, nor does
Prof. Hsu's generalization, interesting though it is, vitiate Einstein's
achievement in any way; rather, Hsu's contribution merely clarifies
Einstein's theory and exhances its utility. In the same way, Lagrange
and Hamilton both *dramatically* extended and clarified Newtonian
mechanics, thereby greatly enhancing that theory's usefulness, yet their
contributions in no way repudiate Newtonian mechanics nor vitiate
Newton's achievement. Indeed, both men were loyal admirers of Newton's
achievement, as is virtually everyone else who has studied the theory
and actually understood it.

I realize, of course, that you don't know the Hamiltonian from
hamburger or the Lagrangian from liverwurst, so such explanations are
lost on you. However, you might at least have taken the trouble to
*read* the sources you cited (even thought you would so, of course,
without the slightest understanding); this you plainly did *not* do, as
you cannot even distinguish the description by Dogariu, Kuzmich and Wang
of their *own experiment* with the theoretical papers of Hsu (whom you
have never read either). Here is the pertinent selection again, for
your delectation:

-------------------------
[I quote Dogariu:]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; (2)
&gt;&gt;&quot;Our experiment is *not* at odds with Einstein's special relativity.

"/>

[Elizabeth replies:]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It only relegates Einstein to a 'special case.'

"/>

[I explain to Elizabeth, to Elizabeth, who has not even read her own
sources:]

No, Dogariu, Kuzmich, and Wang, the authors of the paper in question,
make no mention whatever of having relegated Einstein to a special case.
You're confusing Dogariu, Kuzmich, and Wang (who performed a cesium cell
experiment) with Hsu (whose work on the subject is theoretical). The
above quotation is taken directly from Arthur Dogariu's web page, not
from anything that Hsu wrote. Plainly, you have not read either -- but
by now eveyone has come to expect that!

[Continuation of the quotation from Dogariu:]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The experiment can be well explained using existing physics theories
&gt;&gt; that are consistent with Relativity. In fact, the experiment was
&gt;&gt; designed based on calculations using existing physics theories.&quot;

"/>

[Elizabeth continues her comic confusion:]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; By 'relativity' Hsu means

"/>

[Once again I attempt to enlighten Elizabeth concerning the author of
the text that she has misattributed to Hsu:]

Once again *HSU DID ***NOT***(!) WRITE THE ABOVE!* It comes from
Arthur Dogariu's web page,

&lt;&gt;.
-----------------------------------

However, since you even misattribute your own words to others and carry
on bizarre online conversations with yourself because you cannot even
recognize your own words, a farcical gaffe like the above is merely
normal routine for you.

I note, incidentally, that all my other questions remain unanswered.
For example, what *is* the source of your claim about Southampton being
&quot;caught in the act sodomizing one of his inferiors in a tent in
Ireland&quot;? Some farcically vague and unreliable source like the one
about &quot;shake-scene&quot;? Or your own vivid, if lurid, imagination?

Finally, I note that you evidently have no explanation for your
wilful, even perverse disregard for what the many people whose words you
misquote ridiculously and whose opinions you misrepresent farcically
*actually said* quite explicitly and unequivocally. That number
includes Akrigg, Dogariu, Kuzmich, and Wang, Hsu, Kathman, Rips, myself,
and others. The obvious conclusion from your absurd denial is that you
simply cannot read, and that you lack even the slightest regard for
scholarly accuracy -- all of which makes nonsense of your ridiculous
pretensions. Formerly, I would have said &quot;pretensions to scholarship,&quot;
but it now appears that the locution &quot;pretensions to literacy&quot; is much
closer to the mark.

Nobody said *anything whatever* about &quot;those not enrolled in the

long ago to be &quot;enrolled in the Strat cult.&quot; Were you unable to read
what Dave wrote? Dave has mentioned Reynolds before:

&quot;A former soldier named William Reynolds, then living with his
mother, wrote a long and rambling letter to Lord Burghley in which
he charged in passing that *Venus and Adonis* was really about Queen
Elizabeth, and had been published by the Privy Council to get
Reynolds to believe the Queen was in love with him. For William
Reynolds was certifiably insane, as his many letters attest. His
letters survive in British Library MS Lansdowne 99, alongside other
letters by madmen written to Burghley, gathered in an apparent
'nutcase file' for amusement.&quot;

I have not seen these persons characterized as &quot;psychopaths&quot; because
of an eccentric authorship belief. Can you furnish a quotation? It is
true that Nietzsche indeed went insane late in life, as did Cantor and
Delia Bacon (perhaps this is an occupational hazard among Baconians?),
but that sad fate does not expunge Cantor's or Nietzsche's intellectual
contributions. Nor does the existence of sane Baconians who achieved
distinction in other fields necessarily imply the nonexistence of
crackpot Baconians. I can think of at least one example of the latter.

I'm laughing out loud. You wrote a tittle tattle post to Hsu and
you didn't even know what in the hell his theory was all about or
whether I had Hsu right or whether Hsu rejects Einstein.

I've given you the link countless times and you STILL haven't
figured it out.

The main thing you need to know is that Hsu has
relocated w (time) in Newton's First Postulate:

. . . the first principle of relativity DICTATES that &quot;time&quot; must have
the dimension of length. In other words, the variable w in (w,x,y,z) is
the PHYSICAL TIME, and must have the same dimension as x, y, or z.
This property must hold in any inertial frame. In this new theory, one
can write down form invariant Maxwell?s equations (emphasis Hsu).

&lt;&gt;

Hsu may be a 'theoretical physicist' but he has taken relativity
away from the aesthetician Einstein and reconnected it to the
physical world (we now have to worry about what those neo-Kantian
fucks were fooling around with at Alamogordo).

In paragraph {4} Hsu explains what I saw which is that the First
and Second Postulates are in fact disconnected. Einstein's
universal light constant was really only a superfulous 'measuring
stick' for physical laws in the First Postulate, a redundant
'second clock' in effect.

It's beginning to appear that Elizabeth sees nothing abnormal about

Reynolds's epistle. Indeed, I'm beginning to fear that Elizabeth
replies eagerly to the sort of daily e-mail that I routinely receive:
about quack nostrums that permit one to live forever, once-in-a-lifetime
investment opportunities, salves that enlarge certain body parts (by
either three inches or three cup sizes), too-good-to-pass-up Ponzi
schemes, and of course the weekly private and confidential e-mail from
the widow of the late Nigerian oil minister who earnestly implores my
help and promises to deposit a large sum of money in my back account if
I will only e-mail her the number. (The ones I especially like are the
ones with a subject line like &quot;Confidential: the private information you
requested is enclosed&quot; -- but sent to multiple recipients _en masse_.)
It is *really* a pity that Elizabeth evidently has not read Mr.
Streitz's book -- she is exactly the sort of &quot;reader&quot; (I use the term
exceedingly loosely) on whom that magisterial monograph might make a
deep and lasting impression.

&gt; Since William Reynolds was not, so far as anyone knows, an
&gt; anti-Stratfordian and his allegations about the Earl of Southampton,
&gt; if true, would not in any way undermine the Stratfordian position,
&gt; exactly why should &quot;Strats&quot; falsely accuse him of being a psychopath?

The Strats don't want their grain merchant's 'patron' to be a
homosexual. It doesn't fit their myth.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Second question: Is anyone surprised that Miss Weir sees nothing

What is that supposed to mean? Kathman admitted that Reynold's
account of Southampton's homosexual acts might be true whether
or not Reynolds had other fixations. I'm essentially going on what
Akrigg reported and then discounted as Southampton's homosexual
'phase.' That means that Akrigg accepted Reynold's version but
then dismissed it as Southampton's adolescent experiment. The
problem with that particular Strat Excuse is that Southampton was
in his mid-twenties at the time.

To refresh Elizabeth's severely dysfunctional memory, I reproduce the

the &quot;&gt;&quot; character:

------------------------------------

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Nietzsche was a Baconian for that matter.

"/>

Nietzsche was also completely insane for the last decade of his
life, but that fate seems to be an occupational hazard for Baconians.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; His sister released his Baconian papers after his death.

"/>

His sister Elisabeth was also responsible for a number of gross
distortions and outright forgeries of Nietzsche's writings, chiefly in
an attempt to remake her brother into an Aryan-supremacist simulacrum
of herself and her late husband Bernhard Förster, a crude, anti-Semitic
propagandist and blowhard who had tried unsuccessfully to found a
racially pure Aryan homeland in Paraguay. You can learn more about
Nietzsche's proto-Nazi sister and unscrupulous literary executor in
_Zarathustra's Sister_ by H.F. Peters, as well as in the brief but
captivating case history of Wagner by Martin van Amerongen. The
Britannica article succinctly summarizes the main points:

&quot;An early believer in the superiority of the Teutonic races, she
[Elisabeth Nietzsche] married an anti-Semitic agitator, Bernhard
Förster. In the 1880s they went to Paraguay and founded Nueva
Germania, a supposedly pure Aryan colony, but the enterprise
failed, and Förster committed suicide. Amid a major financial
scandal, Elisabeth failed to make a national hero of her husband
or to salvage the colony as an island of Teutonic Christianity.
She next served as Nietzsche's guardian at Weimar after his mental
breakdown in 1889. On his death (1900) she secured the rights to
his manuscripts and renamed her family home the Nietzsche-Archiv.
Refusing public access to her brother's works, she edited them
without scruple or understanding.

While Elisabeth gained a wide audience for her misinterpretations,
she withheld Nietzsche's self-interpretation, Ecce Homo, until
1908. Meanwhile, she collected some of his notes under the title
_Der Wille zur Macht_ (_The Will to Power_)....After her death
scholars reedited his writings and found some of Elisabeth's
versions distorted and spurious: she forged nearly 30 letters
and often rewrote passages. The discovery of her forgeries and of
the original texts had a profound influence on subsequent
interpretations of Nietzsche's philosophy.&quot;

As I have noted many times (but Elizabeth cannot read, so such
clarifications can only benefit lurkers), I have *never* defended the
work of Rips of the so-called &quot;Bible Code.&quot; However, I do think that,
however eccentric Rips's views may be, he deserves at least the courtesy
of not having his views farcically misrepresented. In particular, Rips
does not claim to be able to predict the future by means of equidistant
letter sequences, as Elizabeth asserts; Elizabeth is *still* confusing
Rips with Drosnin -- neither of whom she has read, so her confusion is
not surprising. In fact, Rips quite explicitly *denies* that this is
possible, and repudiates some of the work of Drosnin and others.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&lt;snip&gt;

Emerson is flatly stating 'who he was we know not.' That is the
same as if Emerson had stated 'we don't know who he was.'

Emerson is also stating 'what he was we know not.' That is the
same as saying 'we don't know that he was the playwright.'

Emerson earlier stated that he had 'an obscure life.'

'An obscure and profane life.' --Ralph Waldo Emerson.

1. Covered over, shaded, or darkened; destitute of light;
imperfectly illuminated; dusky; dim. -- Websters, 1913.

Emerson is also saying that 'Shakespeare was a voice and
nothing else.'

That means that he is 'a player's hyde' that conceals the
'tyger's hart' of the anonymous playwright.

Emerson said he had a 'profane life.'

2. To put to a wrong or unworthy use; to make a base
employment of; to debase; to abuse; to defile. -- Websters,
1913.

A playwright speaking through a mask.

A 'parrot' or an 'eccho' as Jonson put it.

A 'voice merely.'

You've evaded answering it many times and offered no substantive

Buuhhhahaaaa!!!!!. 'Enhances it's utility!!!!'

It has no utility, Webb. As Hsu states, inertial states are extremely
rare if they even exist in nature. Einstein's STR has been 'proven
thousands of times' only on the mathematically slippery level of
quantum physics and then only because, as Hsu states, Einstein's
universal light constant--an artificial and (quote) ARBITRARY
measurement MEASURES ITSELF!!

The math always comes out right. A thousand percent of the time.
Anyone who has even a basic understanding of experimental
design would be alarmed by results that never fail.

We're still using Newton as if Einstein had never been born.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In the same way, Lagrange

Nice try but this is irrelevant to the question of why Hsu has tossed
the Second Postulate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The subject under consideration--Hsu's rejection of the Second Postulate
to come up with a WORKING theory of relativity--Einstein's is obviously
not working and Hsu explains specifically why that is true--has nothing
to do with your detour into Hamilton and Lagrange.

Newtonian physics IS successful and you'll note that Hsu doesn't toss
Newton's First Postulate. Hsu's theory was peer-reviewed for NINETEEN
YEARS in the most prestigious physics journals and I believe that
Hsu, not Einstein, solved the problem of Maxwell invariance.

Your ignorance is astonishing! Special relativity as conceived by
Einstein is emphatically *NOT* a quantum theory, but a classical theory.
It is an ingenious modification of *classical* kinematics to make
Newtonian mechanics compatible with the *classical* electromagnetic
theory of Maxwell (prior to Einstein, the two theories had appeared
mutually contradictory). Relativistic quantum theories (Dirac's theory
of the electron, the quantum electrodynamics of Feynman, Scwinger,
Tomonaga, Dyson, etc.) were later developed, but special relativity
itself was a completely classical theory.

As for general relativity, it too is a classical theory; indeed, it
is at present incompatible with quantum theory, although there are many
ingenious attempts to develop a quantum theory of gravitation that would
specialize to general relativity in the limit when Planck's constant is
negligible.

doubt (certainly not since you declared the geometry of Minkowski space
to be hyperbolic), but this clinches it at a much more fundamental level.

&gt; Anyone who has even a basic understanding of experimental

There is no &quot;experimental design&quot; involved here; we are discussing
theory. However, the predictions of Einstein's theory have been
robustly confirmed by experiments of all sorts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We're still using Newton as if Einstein had never been born.

"/>

Your ignorance is truly boundless! Physicists have not been &quot;using
Newton as if Einstein had never been born&quot; since well before Einstein
ever published his landmark paper on special relativity. Indeed, it was
known well before Einstein that the predictions of Newtonian mechanics
and classical electrodynamics were *completely wrong* at atomic scales,
since in Maxwell's theory an accelerated charged particle emits
electromagnetic radiation -- indeed, those theories predicted that an
electron orbiting an atomic nucleus would radiate away its energy and
hence that the hydrogen atom would be unstable (it would decay almost
instantaneously). In a Newtonian world, no atoms could exist because of
this intrinsic instability. In fact, a satisfactory quantum theory of
the atom emerged by modifying Newton's mechanics far more drastically
than Einstein's modification in the special theory of relativity.

Even some everyday technology used in consumer electronics (e.g., GPS
systems) cannot use classical Newtonian mechanics, but must incorporate
relativistic corrections predicted by Einstein's theory. Even the
general theory of relativity has evolved from a theoretical speculation
into an everyday engineering necessity.

Newtonian mechanics was one of the greatest intellectual achievements
in human history, and it is still widely studied and serves as a useful
approximation, but *only* in systems large enough that quantum wave
function interference effects can be ignored yet small enough that the
cumulative effects of gravitation do not dominate.

&gt;&gt; In the same way, Lagrange
&gt;&gt; and Hamilton both *dramatically* extended and clarified Newtonian
&gt;&gt; mechanics, thereby greatly enhancing that theory's usefulness, yet their
&gt;&gt; contributions in no way repudiate Newtonian mechanics nor vitiate
&gt;&gt; Newton's achievement.
&gt; Nice try but this is irrelevant to the question of why Hsu has tossed
&gt; the Second Postulate.

"/>

Hsu was by no means the first to discard the second postulate.
Indeed, as I have already told you before (but you can neither read nor
remember, so I'm not sure why I bother), that step was taken in as early
as 1909, a scant four years after Einstein's landmark paper, by a
Russian physicist, Ignatowski, who summarized his observation thus (in
Coleman's translation):

&quot;On the basis of the relativity principle alone, it is possible
to prove that a universal cosmic constant must exist, in contrast
to [the method of Einstein], who in parallel with the relativity
principle assumes a priori the velocity of light as a universal
constant.&quot;

Indeed, the fact the second postulate is not a logical necessity is one
of the reasons that I have emphasized, over and over, that Einstein's
great innovation was *not* the second postulate, as many popularizations
suggest, but rather his new kinematics. Einstein was apparently led to
his new kinematics in part by an exploration of the consequences of the
relativity principle coupled with the invariance of the speed of light,
but the important insight in retrospect was Einstein's striking revision
of Newtonian kinematics. Nowadays some people develop and extend the
theory by beginning with Einstein's kinematics together with some
relatively mild assumptions (spatial and temporal uniformity, etc.) and
dispensing with the second postulate, or indeed dispensing with
Einstein's underlying assumption that relativity necessarily involves
electromagnetic theory. Indeed, David Mermin's paper &quot;Relativity
without light&quot; (which I believe appeared while I was still a student --
at any rate, I was certainly aware of it as a student) has been out for
some twenty years; it describes how one can deduce a universal velocity
directly from the relativity principle. Experiment shows that velocity
to be the velocity of light. See also a paper from last year by Pal in
the European Journal of Physics. None of these physicists disputes
either the correctness of or Einstein's priority in the discovery of
relativity.

Many people have since pointed out that, by making alternative
assumptions, one can eliminate the second postulate. But you would
already *know* this if you had actually *read* the Coleman paper you
attempted to cite; indeed, Coleman mentions Ignatowski's observation
*explicitly*. Of course, I realize with sadness that an attempt by you
to read Coleman would be about as effectual as an attempt by my poodle
to do so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Indeed, both men were loyal admirers of Newton's
&gt;&gt; achievement, as is virtually everyone else who has studied the theory
&gt;&gt; and actually understood it.

&gt;&gt; I realize, of course, that you don't know the Hamiltonian from
&gt;&gt; hamburger or the Lagrangian from liverwurst, so such explanations are
&gt;&gt; lost on you.
&gt; The subject under consideration--Hsu's rejection of the Second Postulate
&gt; to come up with a WORKING theory of relativity--

"/>

First, Hsu was not the first to discard the second postulate (there
are many schemes for doing so, as you would know if you had the remotest
familiarity with the literature), and second, the theory was working
just fine long before any of these revisions. Your ignorance is truly
boundless!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Einstein's is obviously
&gt; not working

Can you name a *single* experimental result that shows that
Einstein's theory is &quot;obviously not working&quot;? Of course not! This is
the perishable internet, and Wayback doesn't have a search function yet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and Hsu explains specifically why that is true--has nothing
&gt; to do with your detour into Hamilton and Lagrange.

"/>

It has everything to do with Hamilton and Lagrange. Newton did not
envision the way his theory would be refined by other great minds, and
neither did Einstein.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Newtonian physics IS successful

Not at the atomic scale or at the astronomical scale -- although I do
not doubt that this is news to you. Your ignorance is, sadly, boundless.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and you'll note that Hsu doesn't toss
&gt; Newton's First Postulate. Hsu's theory was peer-reviewed for NINETEEN

No, you plainly have not the remotest clue how peer review works.
