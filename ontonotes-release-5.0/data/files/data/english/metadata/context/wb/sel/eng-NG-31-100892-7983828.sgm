It is clear to me that some blacks/African-Americans are sincere in wanting
the use of the N-word to stop.  As a benevolent and merciful cracker (or is
it cracka) I am moved by their pleas and so I will inform all of you as to
the requirements for this.  If blacks/African-Americans were to insist on
the use of the word 'negro' instead or either of the monikers 'black' or
'African-American' then that would stop blacks/African-Americans from using
the N-word amongst themselves... maybe two or three generations from now.
The reason why whites/crackers/crackas use the N-word is because it can't be
a hate crime if blacks/African-Americans/negroes are using the N-word
amongst themselves.  So putting an end to hate crime law would make it much
easier to end the use of the N-word.  The obvious question is, will the use
of the N-word ever stop?  Probably not, because for reasons known only to
blacks/African-Americans/negroes, the word 'negro' constitutes as attack on
their 'manhood'... whatever.

yeah, black people calling each other niggers is just ignorance. like
when someone calls themselfs a fool thay woulden't much appreciate
another calling them that, unless they were really self-concious or
something of that. i would say most blacks who use the word associate
it to the meanig of &quot;brother&quot;. what's up &quot;brother&quot;. of course that is
not the meaning, so ignorance. but shit, listen to the rappers these
days. the black youth doesen't have much a chance. why in the hell do
people believe them. no sence i guess. me being white i do enjoy rap
like project pat, ugk, jay-z, ice cube, etc, but the lyrics are
degrading.

One of the advantages of being a honkey is that there is nothing you
can call me that will elicit an emotional response. Some niggers have
figured that out.

PBS, the network for oreos and nigger lovers, has yet to get it.

The debate concerning words as applied to racism is a complete red-
herring.
It is not the words that are used but the way in which those words are
employed.
Quentin Tarrentino can say &quot;nigger&quot; because we get the idea that he
employs black people in his films and thinks they are cool. In fact he
probably wants to be black.
There are aspects of black culture that are very difficult to
criticise due to suspicion of racism, just like the assumption that to
criticise Israeli politics is to be anti-semitic. This is another
tragic consequence of race relations PCness.
Blacks who enjoy, listen to, and pay for &quot;gansta wrap&quot; and other
musical forms which revel in the protrayal of black youth as
misogynistic and criminal are participating in their own exploitation.
They encourage the negative image of the black-male as monsterous
gorrilla who you would not trust with a job involving any
responsibility. And the white-led music industry feeds the frenzy to
keep &quot;niggers&quot; in their place.
You might say  - well we all know that most black people are fair hard
working decent family loving humans no different from the best white
folks, but how many employers hesitate and think of the image of
&quot;niggers&quot; in the media?

On the Jewsish question...
Is it antisemitic to suggest that Israel is an army of occupation: by
a foreign force which has disenfranchised millions of Palestinians? Is
it antisemitic to ask if the Jews have a valid claim for that piece of
land granted to them via the British mandate aquired after the fall of
the Ottoman Empire in 1918?
Was there ever a Jewish state? The last claim the such a thing ended
for the last time during the reign of Emperor Hardrian. If Europe were
to use the second century AD as a model for modern national boundaries
then all of England would have to be turned over to the Welsh, Cornish
and Scots, and the English would have to return to Germany as would
the French. If you were to be really serious about it and not disclude
the Roman Empire then Italy would have to be given totalitarian
control of the European Union. What would happen to the USA, Australia
- need I go on.?
So the modern myth which suggest that the Iranian president's view
that there is no such place as Israel is not correct to lambast him.
Israel is an occupied colony, it does not have a natural right to
exist anymore than Iraq.

In the USA the constitution guarantees free speech and there a laws
which punish speech that becomes slanderous or can cause a riot. We
just make agreements and compromises to determine which is which. It
evolves.

It is sometimes suggested that we distinguish offending from harming.

But surely it is implausible to think that the giving of offense is
never harmful to the offended party. People may be deeply offended at
witnessing what they regard as immoral or obscene acts and behavior. A
deeply religious person may be significantly pained by seeing or
hearing about what he regards as a sacrilegious speech or play.
Virtually anyone in contemporary Western societies would be disgusted
by public defecation. In at least some such cases, the offense given
can be not only upsetting but can induce rage, affect health, and
perhaps even alter the course of a person's life, e.g., as when
someone makes it her or his life work to stamp out pornography.

Can the claim to liberty be reconciled with the claim to be safe from
constant offense? A first step at reconciliation would involve
distinguishing easily avoidable from unavoidable offensive acts. If
the act or behavior that is regarded as offensive can be avoided with
a minimum of effort, it is not unreasonable to expect those who object
to make the minimal effort required. Surely, liberty is of great
enough value to outweigh the minimal effort required to avoid offense.
Thus, having sexual relations on the subway during rush hour may be
legally prohibited. Sex between the proverbial consenting adults in
private should be beyond the scope of the law. Anyone should be free
to watch a pornographic movie if they so wish but such freedom should
not extend to lurid billboard advertisements that passers-by cannot
help but witness.

How exactly is the boundary between the avoidable and the unavoidable
to be drawn. It is doubtful if any precise formula can be constructed
that then can be applied to cases in a mechanical fashion. In
practice, the boundary should be established by democratically enacted
statute, as applied by the judiciary. However, there are limits on how
far democracy may go here. These limits are set by the value of
liberty itself. In view of the importance of individual liberty, the
burden of proof is on those who would limit it to show at least: (a)
that the allegedly offensive behavior cannot be easily avoided; (b)
that it is not feasible to provide a restricted area where the
behavior in question need not be witnessed by the general public; (c)
that the behavior is widely regarded as deeply offensive in the
community as a whole; and (d) that the allegedly offensive behavior is
not the expression of an ideology or ideal that ought to be protected
under the heading of free speech. We also should remember that since
any act may offend someone, we cannot prohibit all offensive behavior
without surrendering liberty entirely.

In practice, the courts often have appealed to the standard of what
the community in general finds offensive, obscene, or revolting. The
trick, which has not yet been performed satisfactorily, is to
characterize the relevant community properly. Presumably, one should
not define the community so narrowly that the showing of the very same
movie is allowed in one and prohibited in the other of two neighboring
suburbs. Yet one might not want to define the community so broadly
that what is permissible on 42nd Street in New York City must also be
permissible in an Amish community.

It is reasonable to conclude that the guidelines sketched above should
be interpreted as placing a heavy burden of proof on those who would
restrict liberty to minimize offense. This is a moral judgment
concerning the importance of liberty that we hope is warranted in view
of the arguments for liberty in Chapter Three, as developed in later
sections of this chapter.

The phrase &quot;shouting fire in a crowded theater&quot; has since come to be
known as synonymous with an action that abuses free speech rights or
uses such rights to place others in physical danger. Examples would be
publicly publishing lists of undercover police officers within the
communities which they were operating or posting classified military
secrets on the internet which could affect national security.

http://wiki.lawguru.com/index.php/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater

&quot;Shouting fire in a crowded theater&quot; is an expression that misquotes
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.'s opinion in the United States Supreme
Court case Schenck v. United States in 1919, but is used anyway by
lawyers and politicians to express the limits upon which free speech
may be expressed under the terms of the First Amendment of the United
States Constitution.

Holmes, writing for a unanimous majority, ruled that it was illegal to
distribute fliers opposing the draft during World War I. Holmes argued
this abridgment of free speech was permissible because it presented a
&quot;clear and present danger&quot; to the government's recruitment efforts for

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
the war. Holmes wrote:
">

The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man
falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic. [...] The
question in every case is whether the words used are used in such
circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and
present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that
Congress has a right to prevent.

Holmes wrote of falsely shouting fire, because, of course, if there
were a fire in a crowded theater, one may indeed shout &quot;Fire!&quot;.
Falsely shouting &quot;Fire!&quot; in a crowded theater, i.e. shouting &quot;Fire!&quot;
when one believes there to be no fire, this lying speech in order to
cause panic is not protected by the First Amendment.

Schenck was later overturned by Brandenburg v. Ohio, which ruled that
speech could only be banned when it was directed to and likely to
incite imminent lawless action (e.g. a riot), the test which remains
until this day. Some now see the Schenck argument to be mistaken,
contending that pamphleteer was more like yelling fire outside a
building to prevent people from entering than it was trying to
encourage people to stampede out.

Despite Schenck being overturned, the phrase &quot;shouting fire in a
crowded theater&quot; has since come to be known as synonymous with an
action that the speaker believes goes beyond the rights guaranteed by
free speech, reckless or malicious speech, or an action whose outcomes
are blatantly obvious.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theatre

In law, defamation is the communication of a statement that makes a
false claim, expressly stated or implied to be factual, that may harm
the reputation of an individual, business, product, group, government
or nation. Most jurisdictions allow legal actions, civil and/or
criminal, to deter various kinds of defamation and retaliate against
criticism.

The common law origins of defamation lie in the torts of slander
(harmful statement in a transitory form, especially speech) and libel
(harmful statement in a fixed medium, especially writing but also a
picture, sign, or electronic broadcast), each of which gives a common
law right of action.

&quot;Defamation&quot; is the general term used internationally, and is used in
this article where it is not necessary to distinguish between
&quot;slander&quot; and &quot;libel&quot;. Libel and slander both require publication. The
fundamental distinction between libel and slander lies solely in the
form in which the defamatory matter is published. If the offending
material is published in some fleeting form, as by spoken words or
sounds, sign language, gestures and the like, then this is slander. If
it is published in more durable form, for example in written words,
film, compact disc (CD), DVD, internet blogging and the like, then it
is considered libel.

Gosh, aren't we so civil these days.  I was so so primed for the accusation
of... the b-word (bigotry).  It is not a complete red herring because there
are people making a big deal lately about the use of the n-word... and so I
was prepared to compromise my position (such that I would not be guilty of
bigotry).  Nobody is really that serious about it and I think the reason why
might be due to the fact that the middle class wants desperately to distance
themselves from the class immediately below it.  I think one thing that
rap/hip-hop music has accomplished is to greatly diminish the notion that
class is purely a function of wealth distribution/income.  The middle class
wants everybody put on notice that you are not a part of their group if you
are not in compliance with their rules no matter how much money you have.  I
personally have always believed because of my upbringing that class is
purely a function of intelligence/level of education.

On the Jewish question...
What was kind of an obstacle to overcome growing up for me is that there is
all this religion based on the Bible which came from the Hebrews and it is
perplexing.  Well, you know, what I say is that the Hebrews were the
intelligencia of the ancient times.  If you really want to put a stick in
the craw of the Jews/semites it would pay to make a clear distinction
between semetic and Jew.  Semetic is an ethnic designation and Jewish is a
religion.  There is no such thing as an atheistic Jew although there may be
such a thing as an atheistic semite.  Jews think that they can hide behind
ethnicity as a means to avoid scrutiny and it doesn't fly in a free country
with free speech rights.

If the niggers had no emotional reaction to the term nigger, like I
have no reaction to the use of the word honkey, then they would
empower themselves, and not have to ask the honkey not to use a word
which upsets them. Which means, that they leave it in my power to
upset them by simply calling them niggers.

But of course, that is a trait of niggers.

Now, as for the Jews, it'd really be interesting to get samples and
trace the Y chromosomes- which in most cases I expect will not trace
back to the area around Jerusalem, but in fact from various Aryan
lines. For, ever since Trajan, &quot;Jewish&quot; women have been raped by the
Aryan leaders of the local power structure. That may have something to
do with the synagogues recognizing anyone with a Jewish mother as a
&quot;Jew&quot;.

Its consistent with the pattern, that ever since Alexander, Aryans
have come into the Levant with relatively small forces and maintained
themselves, &quot;Israel&quot; being the latest example. But this does not
negate the right of the mtDNA to reclaim the land of their ancestors
the same as Native American women mite make the claim.

Might makes right, and now that the brave heart, strong right arm,
sword in hand... no longer cuts it, that might comes out of the
ability of women to reach consensus and wield weapons that only
require fine muscle control and better planning.

I've probably put too much thought into this but here goes... As a general
rule, I avoid using expletives in my speech although I consider them to be a
valid means to add emphasis to my prose.  As a tool or weapon, expletives
leave something to be desired because of their overuse and because of
inappropriate use.  Negro is a more effective tool or weapon then the
n-word, IMHO.  Both negro and the n-word will provoke an emotional response
but negro especially is more potent by virtue of the fact that there is
nothing inappropriate about it by way of reason.  Negro is a term which
simply means a black person.

&gt; distinguishing easily avoidable from unavoidable offensive acts. If
&gt; the act or behavior that is regarded as offensive can be avoided with
&gt; a minimum of effort, it is not unreasonable to expect those who object
&gt; to make the minimal effort required. Surely, liberty is of great
&gt; enough value to outweigh the minimal effort required to avoid offense.
&gt; Thus, having sexual relations on the subway during rush hour may be
&gt; legally prohibited. Sex between the proverbial consenting adults in
&gt; private should be beyond the scope of the law. Anyone should be free
&gt; to watch a pornographic movie if they so wish but such freedom should
&gt; not extend to lurid billboard advertisements that passers-by cannot
&gt; help but witness.

&gt; How exactly is the boundary between the avoidable and the unavoidable
&gt; to be drawn. It is doubtful if any precise formula can be constructed
&gt; that then can be applied to cases in a mechanical fashion. In
&gt; practice, the boundary should be established by democratically enacted
&gt; statute, as applied by the judiciary. However, there are limits on how
&gt; far democracy may go here. These limits are set by the value of
&gt; liberty itself. In view of the importance of individual liberty, the
&gt; burden of proof is on those who would limit it to show at least: (a)
&gt; that the allegedly offensive behavior cannot be easily avoided; (b)
&gt; that it is not feasible to provide a restricted area where the
&gt; behavior in question need not be witnessed by the general public; (c)
&gt; that the behavior is widely regarded as deeply offensive in the
&gt; community as a whole; and (d) that the allegedly offensive behavior is
&gt; not the expression of an ideology or ideal that ought to be protected
&gt; under the heading of free speech. We also should remember that since
&gt; any act may offend someone, we cannot prohibit all offensive behavior
&gt; without surrendering liberty entirely.

&gt; In practice, the courts often have appealed to the standard of what
&gt; the community in general finds offensive, obscene, or revolting. The
&gt; trick, which has not yet been performed satisfactorily, is to
&gt; characterize the relevant community properly. Presumably, one should
&gt; not define the community so narrowly that the showing of the very same
&gt; movie is allowed in one and prohibited in the other of two neighboring
&gt; suburbs. Yet one might not want to define the community so broadly
&gt; that what is permissible on 42nd Street in New York City must also be
&gt; permissible in an Amish community.

&gt; It is reasonable to conclude that the guidelines sketched above should
&gt; be interpreted as placing a heavy burden of proof on those who would
&gt; restrict liberty to minimize offense. This is a moral judgment
&gt; concerning the importance of liberty that we hope is warranted in view
&gt; of the arguments for liberty in Chapter Three, as developed in later
&gt; sections of this chapter.

&gt; The Individual &amp; the Poliical Order
&gt; An Introduction to Social &amp; Political Philosophy
&gt; -Norman E. Bowie &amp; Robert L. Simon http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0847687805/

&gt; The phrase &quot;shouting fire in a crowded theater&quot; has since come to be
&gt; known as synonymous with an action that abuses free speech rights or
&gt; uses such rights to place others in physical danger. Examples would be
&gt; publicly publishing lists of undercover police officers within the
&gt; communities which they were operating or posting classified military
&gt; secrets on the internet which could affect national security.

&gt; http://wiki.lawguru.com/index.php/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater

&gt; &quot;Shouting fire in a crowded theater&quot; is an expression that misquotes
&gt; Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.'s opinion in the United States Supreme
&gt; Court case Schenck v. United States in 1919, but is used anyway by
&gt; lawyers and politicians to express the limits upon which free speech
&gt; may be expressed under the terms of the First Amendment of the United
&gt; States Constitution.

&gt; Holmes, writing for a unanimous majority, ruled that it was illegal to
&gt; distribute fliers opposing the draft during World War I. Holmes argued
&gt; this abridgment of free speech was permissible because it presented a
&gt; &quot;clear and present danger&quot; to the government's recruitment efforts for

&gt; the war. Holmes wrote:

&gt; The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man
&gt; falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic. [...] The
&gt; question in every case is whether the words used are used in such
&gt; circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and
&gt; present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that
&gt; Congress has a right to prevent.

&gt; Holmes wrote of falsely shouting fire, because, of course, if there
&gt; were a fire in a crowded theater, one may indeed shout &quot;Fire!&quot;.
&gt; Falsely shouting &quot;Fire!&quot; in a crowded theater, i.e. shouting &quot;Fire!&quot;
&gt; when one believes there to be no fire, this lying speech in order to
&gt; cause panic is not protected by the First Amendment.

&gt; Schenck was later overturned by Brandenburg v. Ohio, which ruled that
&gt; speech could only be banned when it was directed to and likely to
&gt; incite imminent lawless action (e.g. a riot), the test which remains
&gt; until this day. Some now see the Schenck argument to be mistaken,
&gt; contending that pamphleteer was more like yelling fire outside a
&gt; building to prevent people from entering than it was trying to
&gt; encourage people to stampede out.

&gt; Despite Schenck being overturned, the phrase &quot;shouting fire in a
&gt; crowded theater&quot; has since come to be known as synonymous with an
&gt; action that the speaker believes goes beyond the rights guaranteed by
&gt; free speech, reckless or malicious speech, or an action whose outcomes
&gt; are blatantly obvious.

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theatre

&gt; In law, defamation is the communication of a statement that makes a
&gt; false claim, expressly stated or implied to be factual, that may harm
&gt; the reputation of an individual, business, product, group, government
&gt; or nation. Most jurisdictions allow legal actions, civil and/or
&gt; criminal, to deter various kinds of defamation and retaliate against
&gt; criticism.

&gt; The common law origins of defamation lie in the torts of slander
&gt; (harmful statement in a transitory form, especially speech) and libel
&gt; (harmful statement in a fixed medium, especially writing but also a
&gt; picture, sign, or electronic broadcast), each of which gives a common
&gt; law right of action.

&gt; &quot;Defamation&quot; is the general term used internationally, and is used in
&gt; this article where it is not necessary to distinguish between
&gt; &quot;slander&quot; and &quot;libel&quot;. Libel and slander both require publication. The
&gt; fundamental distinction between libel and slander lies solely in the
&gt; form in which the defamatory matter is published. If the offending
&gt; material is published in some fleeting form, as by spoken words or
&gt; sounds, sign language, gestures and the like, then this is slander. If
&gt; it is published in more durable form, for example in written words,
&gt; film, compact disc (CD), DVD, internet blogging and the like, then it
&gt; is considered libel.

&gt; I've probably put too much thought into this but here goes... As a general

&gt; leave something to be desired because of their overuse and because of

It's funny, but as a human being, I understand the feeling that I have
the right to address myself and those close to me in ways I would
never tolerate from other people.  From the simple calling myself an

My mother taught me never to say it - it was one of the four words I was
taught to never use.

I used to hear it somewhat frequently up until about the 1980's.  Before
then, it seems I very rarely ever heard blacks use it at all, and then
only in anger.  When I ever heard it used by whites, it was always in
conversation among other whites about blacks, and always derogatory.

But even back then, I never heard a black person called it to his face
by a white person, except on TV or in the movies (and I lived near
Gratiot and St. Aubin in Detroit at the time)

Now, I hear it frequently spoken in public ONLY by blacks, both in anger
and in ordinary conversation, and I haven't heard a white person say it
for over 20 years (again, except in the media).

&gt; Oh, yeah, you're right.  White people never use that word as a hateful

Negro is a hateful racist term?  Not according to the dictionary.  You'd
better call them.  In any event, I could be mistaken about what the term
'negro' evokes in the mind of a negro and if I am living in a 'little realm

I've observed this too.  What 'flagwords' really work on the white guy?  You

that we may laugh at ourselves, there are some ready to go war.  Careers
have been lost, lives destroyed.  And now we are on the verge of 'hate
speech' law.  But it's all 'one way' because that's the only way it can be I
think.  It's a matter of nerves me thinks...you know, the raw ones open to
the air, sore to the touch.  An example might be where a fat man never likes
to be told the truth of his fatness; nor an ugly woman the likelihood of her
mating.  Ergo, look to the 'nerve' perhaps to find...well, where fat and
ugly really exist anyway. You can call a skinny person fat all day and it
not count.  Where is that raw nerve on the white guy...for I know it must

Certainly useful in identifying how a gene pool will develop, or fail
to.
but almost useless on a face to face basis. For that, you mite surf
for the work of Dr. Paul Ekman. He studied primate facial expressions
for years, and then realized that these *autonomic* responses still
affect hominids.

If you know what to watch for, and especially if you have high speed
video of the face, you can tell when some one is lying.

Next question. Why does the CIA want to use something as obsolete
as torture? Answer: Because they know once that genie is out of the

The question is what is the 'kernal of truth'?
Most people have a common sense about this...why the 'N' word is so
inflammatory perhaps.

BTW, my observation is that ever since civil rights, civilization has bent
over backwards to sweep certain 'kernal of truths' under the rug and pretend
they aren't there.  We've created a whole 'wall of burden' now to keep these
'kernals' buried, away from public discourse.  Like gamma rays searing
through metal, we can't  bury them however.  But we can destroy civilization
in the meantime, LOL.

(sigh)  'k, a little introspection should get me to admit that I offered up
a red herring.  The truth is that I know that the term 'negro' is not an
assault on a negroes manhood.  An introspective negro would admit that the
term 'negro' is *not fashionable*.  But the thing about that is that if my

Its really pretty simple. the Stoics worked it out thousands of years
ago. If you have no emotional reaction to a word, then you
*disempower* those who utter it. Thus niggers use the word freely, and
some have made lotsa money with it in comedy routines, which niggers
would generally applaud.

Likewise, when Lenny Bruce began cursing on stage 60 years ago, it
launched a career. Its time to grow up; the niggers who dont react to
the use of the term, especially by honkeys, know that. As for the
rest, they are such fucking loosers, this issue hardly matters.

&gt; &gt; One of the advantages of being a honkey is that there is nothing you
&gt; &gt; can call me that will elicit an emotional response. Some niggers have
&gt; &gt; figured that out.

&gt; I've observed this too.  What 'flagwords' really work on the white guy?
&gt; You
&gt; know, that might 'really' rustle his feathers?  Honkey?  Nah...contrite.
&gt; White Trash?  Only if one is born on the wrong side of the tracks perhaps.

&gt; Small dicked corn fed cracker?  I smile at the cleverness.

&gt; There really isn't much there.  Hell, I'll agree with most...and laugh
&gt; along
&gt; with the spearchucker (uh... meaning the one throwing the barbs).  But
&gt; see...no sense of humor by some, and though it was meant with light tone
&gt; that we may laugh at ourselves, there are some ready to go war.  Careers
&gt; have been lost, lives destroyed.  And now we are on the verge of 'hate
&gt; speech' law.  But it's all 'one way' because that's the only way it can be
&gt; I
&gt; think.  It's a matter of nerves me thinks...you know, the raw ones open to

&gt; the air, sore to the touch.  An example might be where a fat man never
&gt; likes
&gt; to be told the truth of his fatness; nor an ugly woman the likelihood of
&gt; her
&gt; mating.  Ergo, look to the 'nerve' perhaps to find...well, where fat and
&gt; ugly really exist anyway. You can call a skinny person fat all day and it
&gt; not count.  Where is that raw nerve on the white guy...for I know it must
&gt; exist.  My mutha' really did wear army boots.
">

The closest thing that I think that they have come up with is 'hater'.
Other times they simply get white girls to do the talking for them.  The
harsh reality that negroes have never been able to face up to is that nobody
is going to tell them what people think about the way that they are
behaving.  You know, there is this really stupid thing that they are doing
with their pants right now and the strange thing is that you wount see it
advertized anywhere.  They are wearing their pants such that their underwear
and butt is completely showing.  The only ones telling them to stop doing
that is other negroes.

Its been suggested that they are shaking their pants like that to make
a turd
fall down a pantleg, and are so fulla shit that they keep their pants
low so that
they can take a dump quicker.

But let me try to be more clear. I have known and worked with black
men of
character and talent. That they are less common in the gene pool is no
excuse to treat them with less respect.

But likewise, subjecting a lot of men, from whatever race, to systems
of
education when they lack the qualities needed to actually benefit from
it
only pisses them off and makes them less cooperative.

The greatest harm has been done with the hype that any mother could
raise any child sired by any man and expect to have good results. Some
gene pools dont have enough men of character &amp; talent to meet the
needs
of the nuclear, monogamous family model. We'd do well to offer women
who
feel their choices are too limited fertility clinic services where
they could
choose Y chromsome lines, of whatever genetic background they want, to
conceive children who would have far more promise.

Highly successful career white women already are availing themselves
of
these services, and getting analyses of their own mtDNA markers to
identify gifts and challenges, to help them decide whether they'd do
better
with a donated egg. Fertility clinics also offer computerized matches
of
the various haplotypes and DNA markers to do PGD to elimate problems
as well as morphing software so that the prospective mothers can get
an
idea of what the grown child would look like.

But of course, this is only offered to the women who can afford it.
Poor
women, who need the service the most, have no access to the service.

You are quite wrong here. You have no evidence of their &quot;gene-pool&quot;
you are simply making assumptions based on a false genetic myth when
in reality the true reason that blacks of &quot;charcter and talent&quot; are
fewer is because white society demands that they conform to a white

Refer to Accaim's Razor...or if it walks like a duck, talks like a
duck,...etc.
One has only to look to Africa and see the rich and technologically advanced
civilizations that black Africans have created to solve this puzzle.  Their
humanity and great moral character and industriousness...such shining
examples for the rest of the world.  Without their help, we'd never have
made it to the moon, much less solve such major problems facing us now like
global warming.  They've provided us with just about every major scientific,
artistic, or religious advancement since the beginnings of human
socialization, so it is a great moral travesty that they have not been given
their just due.

So I agree, chazwin here has it all 'spot on'...his/her mind fully open and
sober to the realities of the world.  Us whites are evil, malcontented,
rebel rousers, that have nothing better to do than to sit around smoking
crack all day, exploiting white 'ho's, and infecting the minds of poor,
disestablished negroe youngsters starting from kindergarten through high
school with our vileness.  But we have one saving grace I
suppose...hehe...boy can we play hockey.

I have known and worked with black men of character and talent as well and
all of them were ex-military.  You'd be surprized how much contempt the
military has for the civilian sector.  It's a completely differant world
once you put on that uniform.  It's possibly one of the biggest reasons why
liberals don't want to see America's military gain power and status by
fighting in wars.
