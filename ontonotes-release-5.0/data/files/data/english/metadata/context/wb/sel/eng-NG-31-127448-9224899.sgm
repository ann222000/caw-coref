Here's a convenient list of things what I expect the Darwinists to
give me when I win the debate:

- 1 handwritten book by all Darwinists, cover to cover with on each
line&quot;I &lt;name&gt; am a &lt;swearword&gt;&quot; per every name I've ever been called
on talk.origins and evcforum

- an invisible pink unicorn. You all came up with it, so then it's
your problem to create it.

- total 100 million dollars. one small amount for each Darwinist, one
giant leap for my bankaccount

- worldpeace. by paying attention to basic humanity in stead of
progress.

The following debatingpoints I should win:
- natural selection theory / differential reproductive success, is
false
- natural selection theory leads to ideologies that deny freedom
- freedom is real, and is everywhere in the universe
- people can make decisions in their actual heart
- intelligent design theory, creation theory is fundamentally true
- consciousness is manifest at a point of decision
- at the location of a decision is nothing, or zero
- love, hope, fear and such, are spiritual, they are inside decisions
- the spiritual realm can only be discovered per decision

This will all be acknowledged by science, when they generally
acknowledge freedom is real, which is on occasion that strong
anticipation theory produces sophisticated enough artificial
consciousness.

No evidence in support of either, with tons of consistent evidence to

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - consciousness is manifest at a point of decision
">

You have never experienced conciousness and decision-making in a fast-
paced situation. In sports, one must be able to react and make
decisions without conscious input to excel. When I played basketball,
sometimes I would see a possible passing lane open briefly and close
before I could decide to throw the ball and decide to hold onto it
only to see that I had already made the pass.

I have read that tests show that consciousness lags decision-making by
about a third of a second.

Further, there is no &quot;point of decision&quot; as it is a part of all that
leads to it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - at the location of a decision is nothing, or zero

All my decisions are processed by my brain. Is your case different?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Since the first wish has already been falsified, the rest of your
wishes have collapsed. Therefore, you should deliver to each of us the
things you wanted from us. I can't rightly speak for the rest of them,
but I'm sure they would forgo the handwritten book and the unicorn if
you can deliver they other things. Heck, if you can deliver the world
peace, we would probably feel bad for insisting on the money, but if
you can't manage the peace, then SHOW ME THE MONEY!

- comparisons and succes have not actually been observed in nature,
and finding actual freedom in nature will force natural selection
theory to be found basically false for it's use of that language, and
that construction.

- historians do have an interest in sociology, and how intellectual
climate of opinion develops on account of false ideas like natural
selection

- freedom of people in some countries is oppressed, it is still there
basically. The rights are acknowledged by the constitution, not given
by it.

- the heart is a good center for making decisions, a center that is
well placed further away from the enormous computationpower of the
brain, a place which rhythmically governs the entire body. The heart
is electrochemical just as well as the brain is, and in direct
connection with the brain, so there is no reason to say that the brain
is the center.

- fastpaced action is just evidence that decisions are made in the
heart, without getting caught up in unneccesary thinking with words or
images in the brain.

- you've read that some electric thingy shows up in the brain a third
of a second later then the action, which means that the brain is not
the location of the first decision but a later consequence of a
decision, which function it is to rationalize the first decision for
communication and memory purposes.

- the role of hormones and such is to cause an interference pattern at
a basic level in the rhythmic decisionmakingprocess. the basic
molecular level, and the location of the hormones is more evidence
that the heart is a decisioncenter rather then the brain.

If so, I have an ongoing argument with a person at work who claims
that &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; is the best rock song of all time.  My
position- Is not! The best rock song of all time has to actually rock,
and thus can't be mostly a ballad.  He says my opinion doesn't count
because I'm not enough of a rock music fan.  By this standard, your
opinion (if you're in fact that Lee Ving) would render his opinion

I've hung with Ving on occasion. A stupid crack like that and your friend
would have to untangle the barbed wire from his neck before doing
anything else. And maybe a beer bottle in some other inconvenient
location.

Fukkin' great rock is what you hear when the lead is spraying sweat on
you and your ears are about to be blown inside out because you're
standing four inches away from the stacks and you're tripping over
mostly-empty bottles. If he didn't experience Plant/Paige/Bonham/Jones,
then he's never heard Stairway to Heaven - just a copy of it.

&quot;The Best Rock Song of All Time&quot; is what the &quot;Rock n Roll Hall of Fame&quot;
says you need to put on your iPod. Yeah, tunes help get you through the
day, but listening is re-heated McDonalds compared to experiencing.

Best Rock Song of All Time? Better to look for the best Rock experience -
and that involves getting out, going to shows, and finding something
inspiring. Preferably in some dive instead of a stadium.

&quot;nando_rontel ... @yahoo.com&quot; &lt;nando_rontel ... @yahoo.com&gt; writes
&gt; - you've read that some electric thingy shows up in the brain a third
&gt; of a second later then the action, which means that the brain is not
&gt; the location of the first decision but a later consequence of a
&gt; decision, which function it is to rationalize the first decision for
&gt; communication and memory purposes.

You've read that one incorrectly, it shows up in the *consciousness* a
couple of hundred milliseconds after activity in *other* parts of the
brain.

All it means is that the consciousness lags slightly behind the rest of
brain and that the consciousness not where decisions are made.

http://www.dichotomistic.com/mind_readings_chapter%20on%20libet.html

Look for &quot;the freewill experiment&quot;

&gt; After several hundred trials, the EEG data was averaged. Timing
&gt; themselves, the students reported they first became aware of an
&gt; intention to act about 200 milliseconds before they moved their
&gt; hands. Yet the ERP trace showed that even with such a simple and
&gt; impulsive decision, their motor planning areas had begun to stir even
&gt; earlier, showing flickers of activity around 500 milliseconds before
&gt; any movement was made. In other words, the decision to flex a finger
&gt; or wrist must have started out subconsciously and only emerged as a
&gt; conscious wish about a third of a second into the processing cycle.

First of all, it is simply not true. Patients generally perceive
differences in their decisionmaking after a hearttransplant. Second,
the heart has little or no memory. So since people's decisionmaking is
largely based on memory, one would expect little difference in
decisionmaking from a hearttransplant. But that memory is much the
basis for decisionmaking, does not mean that the memory is neccesarily

&gt; First of all, it is simply not true. Patients generally perceive

If decision making is done in the heart, one would expect a huge
difference in decision making with a mechanical heart - a sudden
inability to decide anything.

Where, specifically, do you suppose the decision making occurs? What
if the right atrium disagrees with the left ventricle? Does the aorta
figure into the decision?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But that memory is much the
&gt; basis for decisionmaking, does not mean that the memory is neccesarily
&gt; the location for decisions.
">

A computer processes a program data in the CPU, not on the hard drive
and not in the RAM.

I'm not so sure about whether the memory storage areas of the brain
doesn't process information. A recent magazine article (Scientific
American, most likely) described how the retina preprocessed visual
input, breaking the image up before sending the signal to the brain.
Many years ago, I read that scientists had noticed that hearing one's
own name, resulted in a stronger signal along the nerve to the brain.
(Your reply brought both those to mind at the same time and makes me
wonder if the same mechanism is involved.)

So, I suppose a decision could be affected by processing done in areas
other than the primary decision making areas of the brain.

How does the heart draw information from the memory of the brain and
how does it transmit its decision back up to the brain so one might
know what decision the heart made? The corpus callosum seems to be the
main bridge between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. The
diameter of the c.c. seems to correspond to the degree that the two
hemispheres can draw upon each other for overall mind function such as
creativity and language skills. Studies of people with a severed c.c.
shows they can view an object with one eye, know what it is, even draw
a picture of it, but cannot think of the word for it.

Clues about the sensitivity of an organ can often be determined by the
size of path of the nerves between the organ and the brain. The nerves
to the fingertips are larger than nerves to large areas of the torso,
because they transmit more information.

A chest pain has more than a dozen causes other than a coronary, but
the nerves don't carry enough information for one to distinguish
between the different causes.

So, where is the &quot;coronary callosum&quot; that allows either or both
hemispheres of the brain to communicate with the heart with enough
information to make a valid decision?

Natural selection is differential reproductive success. You compare
two slightly heritably different sorts of organism in a population on
the number of offspring they have. The comparison is just in the mind
of the Darwinist, it does not actually happen in nature. So Darwinists

So all animals of a particular species all have identical numbers of
young do they?   I think you will find that it's rather easily shown
that animals of a particular species have varying numbers of offspring
in their lives.

The ones that have more offspring will pass more of their genes on to
the next generation (because they have produced more young which contain
those genes).   There you go, that's  differential reproductive success.

Which part of it do you disagree with?

You have no evidence whatsoever that I am racist, fascist or any other
-ist. I have expressed no views here, nor made any argument which
would not be supported by people with strong religious faith,
including your own. What's more, I know many people of faith who
accept the findings of science and demonstrate their dedication to
their religious conviction by how they live their lives. They do not
resort to the moral and intellectual cowardice you demonstrate so
frequently on this forum.

You have nothing other than unfounded assertions, based on a &quot;theory&quot;
so vague that you cannot formulate it in any coherent manner, and
which you cannot defend.  That you resort to such objectionable name-
calling when faced with the fact that it is indefensible, unsupported
by evidence, and untestable shows how facile your &quot;theory&quot; is, and
that your behaviour is hypocritical.

Look to your own behaviour, and what that tells the world about you
instead of making abhorent and disgusting accusations.
