&quot;Lawyers despise each other, despise themselves, are despised by their

Why are lawyers miserable: want a list?
Sathnam Sanghera: Business Life

The juxtaposition of two stories in The Times last week - one
reporting that top-flight City lawyers were charging as much as £1,000
an hour for their expertise, another that a quarter of lawyers wanted
to leave their profession - raised a pertinent question: just why are
those in the legal business so miserable?

The Law Society has recently been trying to provide an answer, but its
&quot;quality of life&quot; review, taking the form of workshops, debates and
online surveys, has been dragging on inconclusively like a complex
fraud case and also seems to have missed some vital evidence from
across the pond.

You see, as with everything else, America has been doing lawyer
dissatisfaction bigger and better than us for decades. Polls have at
various times established that not just a quarter, but up to 40 per
cent of US lawyers want to leave their profession; and whereas British
lawyers are only just waking up to the fact they are miserable and
want to die, their American counterparts have been alert to it since
1989, which saw the publication of Deborah Arron's Running From the
Law: Why Good Lawyers are Getting Out of the Legal Profession.

Indeed, there are now almost more books, articles and websites
dedicated to the subject of legal despair than there are American
lawyers. Which is saying something, given that the USA has more
lawyers than people.

And last week, to help the Law Society get to the point, I spent two
bleak days sifting through the literature, a process that made it
clear City lawyers are unhappy because of:

1. the dehumanising hours. Remember that bit in The Firm where Tom
Cruise's character is told that if he even thinks of a client in the
shower, he should bill it?

Not only can one imagine this actually happening now - lawyers
generally charge on the basis of billable hours, and annual targets
can be brutal - but the shower might even be taken in the office. Many
City firms offer beds and washrooms in offices to enable staff to work
longer.

While those entering the profession may be prepared for this - an
excessive workload is seen as a rite of passage - many don't seem to
realise that their reward for selling the best years of their lives is
simply the privilege of being allowed to sell the rest of their lives
in the capacity of partner.

Which, of course, negates the only advantage of being a lawyer: the
cash. Leaving aside the question of whether money can make you happy,
it is pretty obvious it won't if you have no time to spend it.

2. the yawning gap between their intelligence and the mind-numbing
nature of their work. The word &quot;lawyer&quot; may trigger images of
attractive people making clever arguments in wood-panelled courtrooms,
but most spend the majority of their time in back offices drafting and
redrafting small print that almost no one will read. At least if you
flipped burgers for a living you'd have the satisfaction of giving
people momentary pleasure.

3. the yawning gap between the ideals of those entering the profession
and the reality. Some go into law because they dream of fighting
injustice, but discover on entering that most of what lawyers do
benefits big business.

Others enter the profession because they are seduced by the apparent
glamour of the trade, as portrayed in Ally McBeal and LA Law, only to
find that the work is about as glamorous as getting a verruca (cf
point 2). Then there are those graduates - as much as 47 per cent of
the profession, according to a recent survey - who drift into the job
because they don't know what else to do, assuming vaguely that it
might be fun, and find on entering that it is about as amusing as
breaking a limb in a traffic accident (cf point 1). Repeatedly. For 90
hours a week.

4. the cumulatively lowering nature of the work. We all end up being
shaped by our careers. Journalists become rude, incorrigible gossips.
Police officers start believing what they read in the Daily Mail.
Lawyers, meanwhile, become competitive, aggressive, judgmental,
analytical, adversarial, emotionally detached, paranoid of being sued
and, worst of all, pessimistic. Being a good lawyer involves assuming
that people will do the most awful things and that treachery is to be
expected. It's inevitable that this negativity eventually seeps into
their personal lives.

5. the vortex of hatred that envelops them entirely. I'm not only
referring here to those surveys that put lawyers among politicians and
journalists as the least popular of professionals. I'm also referring
to the fact that lawyers despise each other (cf point 4), despise
themselves (cf points 1, 2, 3,4), are despised by their clients (for
charging too much, not always winning cases) and, in return, despise
their clients back.

Handling others people's problems, unless you are Mother Theresa or
Esther Rantzen, eventually becomes tedious, especially when most of
those problems relate to money.

6. the self-inflicted nature of their suffering. Because of the way
City firms work, most senior lawyers, as well as having to spend too
long doing too much dull work, are under intense pressure to attract
new business. When dissatisfaction kicks in, it's amplified by the
fact that the work making them unhappy is self-imposed. It's like
waking up to find someone drilling a hole into your head, only to
realise the sadist wielding the Black 'n' Decker is actually you.

Looking back over this list, I realise little of it is going to elicit
much sympathy. Somehow, I can't see the Red Cross diverting resources
away from Darfur to come to the rescue of professionals earning £1,000
an hour.

But human misery isn't relative, and I can't help thinking these
problems could be solved. All City firms need to do is take a moment
or two to take a good look at themselves. But that must be difficult
when time is (so much) money.
