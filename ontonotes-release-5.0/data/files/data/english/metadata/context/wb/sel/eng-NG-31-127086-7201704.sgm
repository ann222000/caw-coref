Dear Sadhant,

I wonder what kind of site this is going to be. I read all the articles
quoted on from Yahoo news about "lack of proof of narcotics effectiveness on
long term pain", and dismissed them out of hand.(I read them on Yahoo
yesterday) They were a quasi-compilation of a bunch of anecdotal reports. No
studies or science to back up any of the statements and they quoted the same
empty report 4 different ways to make it look like it was a consensus of
several scientific studies.
They all basically said 'narcotics may have no effectiveness on long term
chronic pain, but no studies have been done, just collections of article
titles from SAMHSA, NIDA, The White House Office on Drug Abuse, and the good
Old DEA, basically all the organizations that depend on bad drug news for
funding, and the best shot they can conclude at taking is there's been no
scientific studies done and they need more research (money). Like most drug
warrior bullshit, it was all fluff and no substance. Must be DEA and all
these other organizations budget begging season. A word from the AMA or
World Health Organization who has studied the chronic pain crisis for
decades would have been nice, but not quite what they were looking for, much
less the dozens of chronic and Cancer pain organizations who have also been
in the pain business for decades.
I know they just report the stories they see but those 4 from the wore
services should have been allowed to quietly pop, just like the air filled
soap bubbles they so resembled.
But thanks for the posting. They will bear watching.--og

If it was my website I wouldn't have wasted the hard drive space to quote
the same story that says nothing 4 times. If they want to succeed, they need
to read the stories before they put them in print.

og- it's too bad the site doesn't have a digg/reddit-like thing to
allow voting/commenting on story quality.  i notice it has a place to
start blogs, though, and that got me thinking: people like you and Sean
should have a cp blog going someplace (whether that site is a good
host, i have no idea).  it would seem that a popular blog - and no
doubt you'd have a loyal readership starting the first day you posted a
link here - can be an effective political voice, which we need more of.

thanks for your voice, either way.
