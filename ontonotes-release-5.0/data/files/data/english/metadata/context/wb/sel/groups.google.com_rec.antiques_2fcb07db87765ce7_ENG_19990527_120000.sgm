I have two Hiroshoge prints that look like they are in turn of the century
frames, how do I get more information on if they are authentic originals or
what exactly are they worth?

"/> Hiroshige ... Japanese woodblock prints.

There's an excellent discussion on the very subject (authenticity of
Hiroshige prints) at:

http://www.shogungallery.com/wwwboard/message5/375.html

The main board can be read at:

http://www.shogungallery.com/wwwboard/wwwboard.html

So you may want to inquire there. The board is populated by helpful and
scholarly people, so please be nice to them even if they refrain from
pricing your prints for you.
