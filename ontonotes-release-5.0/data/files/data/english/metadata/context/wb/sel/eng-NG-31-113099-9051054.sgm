Talks: India, Russia, China
The joint communiqué issued on October 24 after the meeting of the Foreign
Ministers of India, China and Russia is completely silent on the events and
issues relating to Afghanistan and Iraq. This communiqué reiterated the
triangular relations evolving between India, China and Russia are not
targeted against a third country. It was perhaps feared that comments or a
coordinated approach to the Afghan or Iraq crisis would offend the US and
some NATO members.
However, if the India, China and Russia triangular relationship has to
assume a substantive character, ignoring significant issues, such as
Afghanistan and Iraq would spell disaster. Simply making rhetorical
statements related to terrorism, drugs trafficking etc. would not hold well.

It is true that these three countries do not have identical positions on
Afghanistan and Iraq. But there are certain similar perceptions, which could
have found a place in the joint communiqué and would have indicated a desire
on the part of a resurgent Russia, rising China and the emerging India to
come to terms with the two most significant dangers challenging Asian
stability and peace.

There are indications that the Western alliance under the US leadership is
incrementally failing to stabilize and reconstruct Afghanistan and Iraq.
Afghanistan is central, in addition to Pakistan, to tackle international
terrorism. Iraq is one of the key actors in the maintenance of long term
energy security in the world. Both these countries are under the military
control of the Western powers for years.

Four years after the US military intervention, Iraq appears to be much worse
off than it was earlier. Iraqi nationalism has become a thing of the past
and various ethnic groups are at war with one another.

The plan to create a cooperative federalism is not working and a centrally
controlled Iraq is now next to impossible. What is increasingly becoming
likely is the emergence of multiple states out of the present Iraq or an
unstable, fragmented and weak Iraq posing enormous security challenges to
regional peace and stability.

More significantly, an increasing number of Americans are skeptical of the
Bush Administration's approach to Iraq. The Democratic Party is not only
opposed to the continuation of the troops presence in Iraq, the leading
Presidential nominee for the 2008 election Hillary Clinton in an article in
Foreign Affairs has promised to initiate US troops withdrawal within six
days of entering the White House, if elected. Even the Republican Party does
not appear to have a united voice on Iraq any more.

The situation in Afghanistan is even worse. Six years after the US military
intervention and removal of the Taliban Government, the State-building
efforts in that country are going nowhere. The Taliban is rapidly
re-grouping and spreading its influence. More and more Afghans have been
expressing their support to the return of a Taliban-led Government.

The opium production in that country was negligible during the last days of
the Taliban Government and today Afghanistan accounts for more than 90 per
cent of the world opium production.

The US got almost unanimous support from the international community in its
fight against the Taliban regime in Kabul. NATO for the first time in its
history invoked the self-defence clause and offered complete support to the
US.

While Pakistan reluctantly distanced itself against the Taliban, Iran too
came out in favour of the US action in Afghanistan. A large number of the
Afghan people welcomed the US soldiers into their territory with the hope of
seeing a renewed, peaceful and stable post-Taliban Afghanistan.

But today, the situation has completely changed. Attacks against the US and
NATO forces are rising day by day. There were hardly any suicide bombers
during 2001-2004. This year alone there are more than 70 instances of
suicide bombings in Afghanistan. Not only are the Afghan insurgents turning
against the Western forces, even Pakistan is allegedly hesitant to give its
best in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda.

Significantly, Pakistan has begun to witness and experience the impact of
terrorism in the hands of those it once trained and equipped to fight
against its perceived enemies and adversaries. Recently more than six dozen
Taliban soldiers have reportedly been killed in the Helmand province in
Afghanistan in one of the fiercest battles with the NATO forces.

In the meantime, the United Nations has expressed a desire for more NATO
forces to protect the UN aid workers who have been under attack from the
insurgents. According to UN sources, more than 30 aid workers have been
killed, more than 70 abducted and more than 100 convoys have been looted
this year. And unless this trend is checked, UN aid efforts would face
substantial hurdles.

It appears that six years after the removal of the Taliban regime in Kabul,
the law and order situation in the country has been going from bad to worse.
It reminds one the bloody years of the Soviet military presence, the
post-Soviet troop withdrawal chaos and bloodshed and the steady rise of the
Taliban as a force to reckon with.

The US fairly swiftly overthrew the Taliban regime after the 9/11 terrorist
attacks, but has failed to capture or kill the top leadership. It has also
failed in State building efforts. The Taliban was defeated for a short
while, but regrouping of the cadres seems to be taking place at a faster
rate now. According to an unpublished report prepared for the Pentagon,
popular support to the idea of a return to the Taliban-controlled Government
in Kabul has doubled since May among the Afghan people.

The American legislators have begun to question the wisdom of Bush
Administration's policy toward Afghanistan. There are complaints that the $3
billion expenditure in countering drug production has failed to produce
results. The US has spent about $6 billion in training a new police force in
Afghanistan.

More than 76,000 police forces have been trained, but US legislators are
concerned that &quot;no one knows how many report for duties and how may are
capable of handling situations.&quot; Moreover, there is no accountability of
weapons supplied to police stations and no end use verification.

One legislator argues: &quot;...the Bush Administration scaled down the nation
building efforts in Afghanistan in less than two years and diverted it to
Iraq. There was bipartisan support in the US, global support, including by
Iran to set Afghanistan right and even the Afghan people shed their
traditional xenophobia and invited coalition forces to end the Taliban
excesses. But the US Administration failed to capitalize on this.&quot;

Russia, China and India have to take note of the fact that continuing
failure of the Western country to stabilize Iraq and Afghanistan will spell
disaster to this region. There is less likelihood of the US being challenged
in its territory, as was done on September 2001, by Al Qaeda or other
terrorist bodies. There are more likelihood of Russia and China and India
facing the brunt of chaos and instability in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Let us hope that the triangular talks involving the Foreign Ministries of
these three countries will take serious note of these events in the
subsequent rounds.

What does this article really say:

NATO for the first time in its history invoked the self defence clause and
offered complete support to the US. 90% of the world opium production now
comes from Afghanistan when in the waning days of the Taliban, it had been
cut to a negligable amount. It seems that the finances, not only of the
Brits and the US, but also of NATO depend on opium. Another strike against
the medium of exchange-money-Babylon. If money-the medium of
exchange-Babylon was not an obstacle to the well-being of the human race,
opium would not even be raised.

It is in the money nation's corner. It has the best of both worlds,
the Financial greed and hunger of Western capitalists, and the desire
of the Russian oil and gun traders to fulfil!

All abroad ahoy!
