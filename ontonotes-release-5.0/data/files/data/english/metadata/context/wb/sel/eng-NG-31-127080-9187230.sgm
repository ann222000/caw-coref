Hmmm. It says I have a 100% chance of getting diabetes :D  and
virtually no chance of having any other problem in the next 30 years.
I hope it's right...

I hope this is accurate. Other than 100% Diabetic, I show less than 15% for
a stroke (at age 92) and everything else is less. Encouraging but I won't
let it be a reason for me to slack off.

I have a 100% chance of getting diabetes.  Duh!  45% chance of heart attack.
11% chance of stroke.  2% chance of kidney failure.  1% chance of eye
problems.  And 10% chance of foot problems.  I did think it was odd that it
only allowed a fasting BG of 126 to 300 upon diagnosis though.  I'm sure
some were &gt;300.

Like mine. 340 IIRC (my labs are downstairs and I am not so much
downstairs).
