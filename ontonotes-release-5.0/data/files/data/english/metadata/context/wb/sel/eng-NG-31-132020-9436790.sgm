It is quite striking to the fair researchers how the Holy Qur'aan and Sunnah
cared about the environment. For example, the Holy Qur'an says, &quot;Do they not
look at the camels how they are created.&quot; (88:17)

Here, the Holy Qur'an mentions camels rather than other animals. The reason
behind that is to attract the attention to this remarkable animal and
calling people to contemplate about its structure, properties and benefits,
as it is the closest of the grazing live-stock to the Bedouins who are
addressed directly by the Qur'aan.

The Qur'aan speaks repeatedly of grazing live-stock (camels, sheep, cattle)
rather than other animals that might exist in other areas. The reason is
that it wants to attract the attention of the addressed people to the
animals present in the surrounding environment in order to make use of them;
be grateful to the bounties of Allah, to eat its meat and drink its milk.
&quot;Pure milk palatable to drinkers.&quot; (16:66)

Also, to enjoy their sight when you are leading them in the morning and
bringing them back in the evening. &quot;And wherein is beauty for you, when you
bring them from home in the evening and as you lead them forth to pasture in
the morning.&quot; (16:6)

The same is mentioned in the Qur'aan about the bees; their homes, various
kinds, nutritive and medical values in a Surah called &quot;The Bees&quot;.

Likewise, the Qur'aan talks about the date-palm, grapes, crops of diverse
flavour, the olive and the pomegranate similar and different. Here, the
Qur'aan stresses on two important aspects:

1. Enjoying its beauty: &quot;Look at their fruits thereof when they bear fruit
and upon its ripening.&quot; (6:99)

2. Making use of its substance, but paying the due Zakat prescribed by Allah
Almighty. &quot;Eat of their fruit when they bring fruit, but pay the due thereof
(its Zakat according to Allah's order) on the day of its harvest. But be not
extravagant.&quot; (6:141)

It was repeatedly mentioned in the Qur'aan: Forbidding from spoiling the
earth after Allah (Exalted and Almighty) has created it suitable and well
prepared for the successive human generations. It announced that Allah does
not like spoiling or those who spoil in life, this includes spoiling
environment, polluting it or being aggressive with it. Also, it is forbidden
to abuse it in any way that would make it deviate from the purpose for which
Allah created it. This would be like showing ingratitude to Allah, that
would cause vengeance from Allah, and becomes like a warning to those who
perpetrated this, that severe penalty will almost come upon them as what
happened before to the `Aad and the Thamud and those who came after them.

&quot;Who did transgress beyond bounds in the land (in the disobedience of Allah)
and made therein much mischief. So, your Lord poured on them different kinds
of severe torment. Surely, your Lord is Ever-Watchful.&quot; (89:11-14)

This is like the punishment that came upon the Saba, who did not appreciate
the bounties that Allah gave them: the fertile land, the fresh pure water,
the sweet-smelling gardens, and they showed reluctance, neglected the land
and wasted their source of bounty. Allah (Exalted and Almighty) said:

&quot;Indeed there was for (the) Saba sign in their dwelling place. Two gardens
on the right hand and on the left (and it was said to them): Eat of the
provision of your Lord and be grateful to Him, a fair land and an
Oft-forgiving Lord. But they turned away from the obedience of Allah, so We
sent against them Sail al-`Arim (flood released from the dam) and we
converted the two gardens into gardens producing better bad fruit and
tamarisks and some few lote-trees. Like this We required them because they
were ungrateful disbelievers and never do We require in such a way except
those who are ungrateful disbelievers.&quot; (34:15-17)
