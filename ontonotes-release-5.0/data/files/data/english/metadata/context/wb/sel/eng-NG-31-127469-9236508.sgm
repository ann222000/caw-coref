All angels help you to know, if only you will but let them.

They have practiced for millions of years precisely how to get you to know
things that you need to know to obtain life.

There are two types of angels.  All angels except for Gabriel fall into one
of these two types.  The two types are: cherubim and seraphim.  Gabriel is
uniquely both.

Cherubs teach directly.  They bring information to you from the outside.
Seraphs teach indirectly.  They bring information to you from your own
inside,
where all information is already created within you.

So Cherubs are handy with declarations.
And Seraphs are handy with questions.

You will need both.

You need cherubim to propel you forward,
and you need seraphim to properly be.

Cherubs bring information from without;
Seraphs bring information from within.

You are so blind that you cannot even see the dark.

&gt;&gt;&gt;immobilize people that do, troll.

&gt;&gt;Prove your accusations like i prove mine and maybe someone will believe
&gt;&gt;you. Your attempts at propaganda could be thwarted by a six year old
&gt;&gt;child,
&gt;&gt;and your lies are obvious to all except yourself.

&gt; Again, you speak for no one.  You are all by yourself in the little rat boat
&gt; you built
&gt; for yourself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Read what the Bible says Mark, and quit making things up like a demon.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You believe the Bible?  That is a laugh.  What happened to love thy
&gt;&gt;&gt;enemy?

&gt;&gt;Take your hatred of the Bible away, Mark, and read it instead.

&gt; Making up lies as a smokescreen to hide that you don't believe it?

&gt;  Educate yourself

&gt;&gt;on its words. Just because you cannot love your enemies now, doesn't mean
&gt;&gt;you
&gt;&gt;cannot learn to do so. The true meaning is to have only love and the
&gt;&gt;meaning
&gt;&gt;of enemy vanishes. Take your hatred away from this news group Mark, and
&gt;&gt;please
&gt;&gt;learn to read. The Bible was the primary instrument of teaching millions
&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;people to read. It would do you good to read it even if you don't believe
&gt;&gt;in it.

&gt; You don't believe it, or else you would love your enemy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So Cherubs are handy with declarations.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And Seraphs are handy with questions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Where does it say that in the Bible, Mark? You are making things up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and causing confusion. Please go away and post your demon-troll
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;religion somewhere else.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I already told you.  I am not going to tell you again right now.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe later.

&gt;&gt;You are the epitome of darkness Mark.

&gt; You sir, are projecting.  You don't even know what an angel is.
&gt; Where is God?  You have neither seen him nor know him.

&gt;  You haven't ever backed up any of your

&gt;&gt;claims nor accusations about me nor anyone else in this group, most
&gt;&gt;especially
&gt;&gt;Allan. You have not told anyone anything about where in the Bible your
&gt;&gt;statements
&gt;&gt;are mentioned. You made up a phony religion in order to fool people that
&gt;&gt;don't
&gt;&gt;know any better. Shame on you Mark, and shame on all of your works.

&gt; I prove everything I say.  Light is proof of itself.  You just try to snuff
&gt; out the light,
&gt; because it shows you up for the liar that you are.  Every time I post
&gt; something peaceful
&gt; about angels, it shows everyone what a liar you are.  So you descend into a
&gt; lower level
&gt; of hell, to try to destroy the damage you have done.

&gt; Give it up, you are defeated.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You will need both.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You are not anyone's teacher Mark. Nobody is your student. You haven't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;any right to be saying what people will need because you can't even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;take care of your own needs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Duh...I was talking about angels being teachers...you are not very bright
&gt;&gt;&gt;are you?

&gt;&gt;Insults and hatred belong somewhere else, Mark. Take your hatred and
&gt;&gt;insults
&gt;&gt;to the demon groups where you can teach your religion successfully since
&gt;&gt;your followers will love to be confused. Preaching on this newsgroup about
&gt;&gt;things that you made up is the same as attempting to teach others. You are
&gt;&gt;wrongful and deceitful, Mark. Why do you insist on trolling here?

&gt; Again, I am discussing angels.  You are trying to stop discussion of angels.
&gt; You clearly are the troll.

&gt; Leave you in peace?
&gt; Am I not minding my own business every day, posting about angels?
&gt; You are a liar, sir.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You need cherubim to propel you forward,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and you need seraphim to properly be.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cherubs bring information from without;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Seraphs bring information from within.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Take your self-created religion somewhere else Mark. You are not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a preacher, a teacher, or a prophet. Go read the Bible and pray
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for your soul and apologize to this news group for all of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hate you have caused here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Whom in this group appears to be a demon?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Only those like you, whose only agenda is to try...in futility...to snuff
&gt;&gt;&gt;out
&gt;&gt;&gt;all light.

&gt;&gt;Again you lie to yourself, Mark, because all that the people in this group
&gt;&gt;have ever done is try and show you the light.

&gt; No, actually, most here try to cover up the light, like you.

&gt;  How many times in this very

&gt;&gt;conversation have i tried to persuade you to read the Bible?  And how many
&gt;&gt;of your statements are only from the darkness inside you?  The darkness is
&gt;&gt;surely inside you, Mark, because the definition of darkness is &quot;i do not
&gt;&gt;know&quot;.
&gt;&gt;You are so blind that you cannot even see the dark.

&gt; Where is God?  Where are the angels?  Show them to me.
&gt; You don't know: it is you in darkness.

&gt; Now, idiot, go write this all backwards to try to reverse it!
&gt; You are crazy!
">

Shoo Troll, nobody wants your hatred in this group. Be gone and teach your
phony religion somewhere else.

Like everything else you make up, nothing you said in this entire thread
was backed up by any evidence.

Mark, at the beginning of this thread you wrote:-
'All angels help you to know, if only you will but let them.'

About half way through you wrote:-
'I prove everything I say.'

In your post replying to Bruce, you wrote
'And about faith, it is the only thing that heals in hospitals, and it
is
what keep jet airliners and bumblebees aloft on such tiny flotation
devices.'

In regards to bumble bees you have been provided with scientific proof
that a) their flight is entirely in accordance with aerodynamics, and
b) how the myth of their theoretical inablility to fly came about.

Aircraft fly because of the shape of their wings produces lift, if you
google you will even find the formula to work out how much lift a
given wing shape will produce at a given speed.

How do you reconcile these seemingly totally contradictory facts?

It may be scientific proof, but it still does not explain how a bumble bee's
and a jet airliner's tiny wings keep them aloft.  Scientists think that they
have scientific proof, but in fact they do not.  Observe the relative sizes
of their wings to what they have to lift and you may figure it out.

actually, IMHO, becoming dangerously too alike Using past statements
of yours as a base line, especially those referring to a point when
you have lost the argument, and are appealing for help, that one is a

Mark, it is perfectly clear that your ideas and mine are totally at

because of your inabilitiy to debate, lack of knowledge, and reliance

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In regards to bumble bees you have been provided with scientific
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; proof
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that a) their flight is entirely in accordance with aerodynamics,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; b) how the myth of their theoretical inablility to fly came
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; about.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It may be scientific proof, but it still does not explain how a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bumble
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bee's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and a jet airliner's tiny wings keep them aloft.  Scientists think
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; they
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have scientific proof, but in fact they do not.  Observe the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; relative
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sizes
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of their wings to what they have to lift and you may figure it out.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The wings produce lift, they fly. Science quantifies it, and it fits

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why did it not occur to you that just because scientists observe a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; phenomenon
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; does not mean that they understand it?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Science observes, postulates, and explains. It's obvious you don't
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; understand science at all, but it is also obvious that further
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; discussion is impossible because of your lack of knowledge.

&gt; &gt;&gt;     So why do you think what scientists say is the last recourse?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Aircraft fly because of the shape of their wings produces lift,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; if
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; google you will even find the formula to work out how much lift a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; given wing shape will produce at a given speed.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How do you reconcile these seemingly totally contradictory facts?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Please be more specific.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Ummmmmmmmmm try switching your brain on. It is obvious to anyone
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; else
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reading this post you are simply being evasive (at best) or totally
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dumb (at worst).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Allan, you and I are of different cultures, so language is not the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; same
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; between us

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Our language is the same apart from a few spelling variations and the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; USian insistence of the use of gotten. The grammar is the same, words
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are interchangeable etc etc. Unfortunately the two 'cultures,' are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; actually, IMHO, becoming dangerously too alike Using past statements
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of yours as a base line, especially those referring to a point when
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you have lost the argument, and are appealing for help, that one is a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doozy.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Culture must make a difference, because your words make little sense to
&gt; &gt;&gt; me.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Mark, it is perfectly clear that your ideas and mine are totally at
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; odds, it is perfectly clear that I can't discuss anything with you,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because of your inabilitiy to debate, lack of knowledge, and reliance
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on wild imagined ideas, so you have the last word you pitiably
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ignorant motherfucker.

Because they work with facts about how the universe really is, not
some crazy notion that you dreamed up from an episode of Star Trek.
According to your own theories if you jumped hard enough, in a lift
(elevator) going down, you would go into orbit. It doesn't work that
way, though your theory says it should. Gravity does not behave in the
way you think it does, but because you do not understand basic physics
no one can explain your own errors to you.

Most of the posters here always show the same reaction to you Mark,
kindliness, followed by frustration, then abusive language, and total
intolerance. Why do you think that might be?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In regards to bumble bees you have been provided with scientific
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;proof
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that a) their flight is entirely in accordance with aerodynamics,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;b) how the myth of their theoretical inablility to fly came
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;about.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may be scientific proof, but it still does not explain how a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bumble
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bee's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and a jet airliner's tiny wings keep them aloft.  Scientists think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;have scientific proof, but in fact they do not.  Observe the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;relative
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sizes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of their wings to what they have to lift and you may figure it out.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The wings produce lift, they fly. Science quantifies it, and it fits
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the observations.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why did it not occur to you that just because scientists observe a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;phenomenon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;does not mean that they understand it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Science observes, postulates, and explains. It's obvious you don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;understand science at all, but it is also obvious that further
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;discussion is impossible because of your lack of knowledge.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    So why do you think what scientists say is the last recourse?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Aircraft fly because of the shape of their wings produces lift,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;google you will even find the formula to work out how much lift a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;given wing shape will produce at a given speed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How do you reconcile these seemingly totally contradictory facts?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Please be more specific.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ummmmmmmmmm try switching your brain on. It is obvious to anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;else
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reading this post you are simply being evasive (at best) or totally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;dumb (at worst).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Allan, you and I are of different cultures, so language is not the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;between us

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Our language is the same apart from a few spelling variations and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;USian insistence of the use of gotten. The grammar is the same, words
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are interchangeable etc etc. Unfortunately the two 'cultures,' are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;actually, IMHO, becoming dangerously too alike Using past statements
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of yours as a base line, especially those referring to a point when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you have lost the argument, and are appealing for help, that one is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;doozy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Culture must make a difference, because your words make little sense to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Mark, it is perfectly clear that your ideas and mine are totally at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;odds, it is perfectly clear that I can't discuss anything with you,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;because of your inabilitiy to debate, lack of knowledge, and reliance
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;on wild imagined ideas, so you have the last word you pitiably
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ignorant motherfucker.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Tell me if you are so smart: what is an ultimate premise?

&gt; Mark Earnest proved he was inept at even insanity:

&gt;&gt; Fact is, if you don't know what an ultimate premise is, you cannot know

&gt; How do you know that, Mark?

I use premises that lead to the ultimate premise to find out.
Which is,  by the way,  the only way to know anything at all.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; else
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reading this post you are simply being evasive (at best) or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; totally
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dumb (at worst).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Allan, you and I are of different cultures, so language is not the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; same
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; between us

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Our language is the same apart from a few spelling variations and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; USian insistence of the use of gotten. The grammar is the same,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; words
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are interchangeable etc etc. Unfortunately the two 'cultures,' are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; actually, IMHO, becoming dangerously too alike Using past statements
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of yours as a base line, especially those referring to a point when
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you have lost the argument, and are appealing for help, that one is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doozy.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Culture must make a difference, because your words make little sense
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; me.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Mark, it is perfectly clear that your ideas and mine are totally at
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; odds, it is perfectly clear that I can't discuss anything with you,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because of your inabilitiy to debate, lack of knowledge, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reliance
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on wild imagined ideas, so you have the last word you pitiably
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ignorant motherfucker.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Tell me if you are so smart: what is an ultimate premise?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you do not know, then it is you who are ignorant.- Hide quoted

&gt;&gt; &gt; By the way, a while ago, when you were convinced that you were the
&gt;&gt; &gt; cleverest person alive, and replete with dipomas and the like, I
&gt;&gt; &gt; offered to post mine for verification, as long as you reciprocated.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Then it turned out that all your qualifications, like your 'angels,'
&gt;&gt; &gt; were just other figments of your imagination. Are you really sure you
&gt;&gt; &gt; want to go down this road again?

&gt;&gt; I am in no way interested in the papers the lemmings make to make
&gt;&gt; themselves look good.

&gt;&gt; If papers are so good, then why can't those with the most of them, 38
&gt;&gt; years
&gt;&gt; after landing a man  on the Moon, not get us out of Earth orbit?- Hide

&gt;&gt;Mark Earnest proved he was inept at even insanity:

&gt;&gt;&gt;Fact is, if you don't know what an ultimate premise is, you cannot know
&gt;&gt;&gt;anything
&gt;&gt;&gt;at all.  Without knowing this, you can only have inclinations toward
&gt;&gt;&gt;knowledge, but not hard facts at all.

&gt;&gt;How do you know that, Mark?

&gt; I use premises that lead to the ultimate premise to find out.
&gt; Which is,  by the way,  the only way to know anything at all.
">

Liar. Show the work. Nobody believes you.

In other words... list the premises that led you there, etc.

You lied when you said you, &quot;prove everything that you say&quot;.
