Season in review: Defensive line

By SFI staff

Posted Jan 18, 2007

SFI breaks down the 49ersâ€™ 2006 season by position, analyzing what
went right and wrong during the year and identifying the changes that
took place and the players who stood out during the course of the
season. Who's the unit MVP, the biggest disappointment and the biggest
surprise? Who overachieved and underachieved? Who's on the rise and on
the slide? It's all here. Today: Defensive line

Defensive linemen on final 53-man roster: DE Bryant Young, DT Isaac
Sopoaga, DT/DE Marques Doulgas, DE Melvin Oliver, DT Anthony Adams, DT
Lance Legree, DT Damane Duckett, DE Roderick Green

Starters in season opener: LE Bryant Young, DT Anthony Adams, DT
Marques Douglas, RE Melvin Oliver

Starters in season finale: LE Bryant Young, DT Isaac Sopoaga, DT
Marques Douglas, RE Melvin Oliver

Unit MVP: Bryant Young

Top newcomer: Melvin Oliver

Most improved: Ronnie Fields

Biggest disappointment: Isaac Sopoaga

Biggest surprise: Melvin Oliver

On the rise: Ronnie Fields

On the slide: Anthony Adams

Overachiever: Marques Douglas

Underachiever: Isaac Sopoaga

What went right: The 49ers found a keeper in rookie Oliver, the third
of the team's three sixth-round draft picks in 2006 who established
himself as one of San Francisco's top 11 defenders a few weeks into
training camp, convincing the 49ers - who still don't have the ideal
to personnel to play their preferred 3-4 defensive scheme - to switch
back to a 4-3 to take advantage of Oliver's strength defending the
run. That alignment was better suited to San Francisco's personnel,
and for much of the 2006 season, the 49ers got the most out of this
unit, which still is lacking in quality talent and playmakers. Young
continued to play at a high level in his 13th NFL season, recording
another fine season with 60 tackles and 5.5 sacks, the most among the
team's defensive linemen. He could still be a disruptive force and
attract double-team attention, though not at the same level as recent
seasons, and was named an NFC alternate for the Pro Bowl. Douglas had
his finest season as a 49er, challenging Young for unit MVP honors and
playing much more stout against the run than it would seem possible as
an undersized 285-pound tackle. Douglas led defensive linemen and
finished third on the team with 75 tackles, and he also contributed
three sacks, two forced fumbles and one fumble recovery. The 49ers got
a big push in October from the much-improved Fields, who took away the
starting inside tackle position in Week 6 from Adams, who had held it
for much of the past three seasons. Fields provided some run-plugging
bulk the 49ers were missing in the middle and played well within in
the system. Adams made contributions (29 tackles, two sacks) both
before and after losing his starting role and Sopoaga also made
occasional contributions (28 tackles, 1.5 sacks). Green, who was
picked up before the season opener and then released after the team's
second game, was re-signed in Week 10 and came on as a pass rusher
from the edge, recording 4.5 sacks over a six-game stretch late in the
season. Green is more of a 3-4 linebacker, but the 49ers used him
primarily as a defensive end in third-down pass-rushing situations.
Playing collectively better than the sum of its parts, this unit held
five opponents to 90 yards or fewer rushing in 2006 as the 49ers
finished 19th in the NFL against the run and 16th in rushing average
allowed, San Francisco's best finished among 12 defensive categories
recorded by the NFL.

What went wrong: This unit had to overachieve to be competitive and
keep the 49ers in games, and it often was too much to ask. The 49ers
had problems matching up with opponents here in both size and talent.
In a scheme that demands he occupy interior blockers, the 5-foot-11,
297-pound Adams simply was too small for the role and the 49ers had to
turn to the 310-pound Fields after the 332-pound Sopoaga - who has the
best size for the role - did not display enough consistency or fire to
handle the job. Fields was adequate - and sometimes better - until he
broke his arm in practice in late December, forcing him onto the
injured reserve list for the final two weeks of the season. The 49ers
went back to Sopoaga as the starter in those final two games, and he
played better than earlier in the season, when his play slipped to the
point that he was made inactive in favor of Duckett for a Week 8 game
at Chicago. While Oliver is solid against the run, he is not much of a
factor rushing the passer and finished with just one sack as he often
was replaced on passing downs. The unit as a whole did not provide
enough push in the pass rush for the 49ers to be successful, perhaps
because it held the responsibility for the entire defense to provide
pressure when opponents went into passing mode. The team's leader in
sacks, linebacker Brandon Moore with 6.5, often lined up as a
defensive end on passing downs to help provide better pressure. Young,
while still an effective player, showed some signs of wearing down and
he could be handled by the extra blockers opponents sent his way
because nobody else on the line required such attention. This was a
unit that could be worn down by opponents, as was demonstrated in the
nine games in which the 49ers allowed 123 or more yards on the ground.

Looking forward in 2007: This is San Francisco's biggest area of need
in 2007, and a place the 49ers have to upgrade if they intend to take
the next step defensively. The biggest need is an effective edge pass
rusher who also can stay on the field in more than just third-down
situations. The 49ers will seriously consider entering the bidding
wars for top free agents such as pass-rusher premier Dwight Freeney
(Colts), though the team might be more included to focus on adding a
better all-around end who also can upgrade the pass rush such as
Charles Grant (Saints), Patrick Kerney (Falcons) or Cory Redding
(Lions), among others. The 49ers also need a big-bodied tank to plunk
down in the middle of their defense since Sopoaga doesn't appear up to
the role, at least on a regular basis. If the team finally makes the
switch to the 3-4 scheme this year as it intends, having a big body in
the middle is essential. While the 49ers probably can get by with
Fields and Sopoaga if both players continue to improve, adding another
player to upgrade the competition and depth at nose tackle should be a
top priority. Adams, though he still has something to offer as a
quick, versatile tackle who also can slide out to end, probably won't
be asked back as an unrestricted free agent simply because the team
needs to get that big body at the position, which is the roster spot
Adams occupies. The 49ers will take a long look in the draft at some
of the top defensive linemen coming out of college, including tackle
Alan Branch (Michigan) and ends Gaines Adams (Clemson), Quentin Moses
(Georgia) and Lamarr Woodley (Michigan), among others. The 49ers also
have to be prepared for the possibility Young might retire rather than
return for a 14th season with the team, though it appears he intends
to come back. If Young does return, he's still good enough to start on
this line, but the 49ers will need to find his eventual replacement
and start rotating that player into the position to keep Young fresh
and playing at a top level. Douglas, Oliver and Fields all are players
who will make key contributions in San Francisco's future rotation
along the defensive line, but the 49ers could stand to upgrade their
starting talent at either of those three spots, and need to upgrade at
least one of them to get better up front defensively.

Final 2006 unit grade: C
