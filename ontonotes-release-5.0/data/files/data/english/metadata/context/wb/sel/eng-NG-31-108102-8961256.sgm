Hello ,
I am writting to see if anyone can help me ,. My baby parakeet can
not sit on a perch , she is 4 months old and out of the nest , but she
just sits on the bottom of the cage , I have worked with her every day
and try to help her learn how to perch , but she just falls off . When
she moves across the bottom of the cage she uses her legs to help push
her along but does not ever stand up on her legs .What could be wrong
with her ??

Please visit an avian vet immediately. It's the only way you are going to
find out what might be wrong with your bird, and if there's a way to help
it.

Your parakeet probably has splayed legs. (Are you asking about a budgie?)
