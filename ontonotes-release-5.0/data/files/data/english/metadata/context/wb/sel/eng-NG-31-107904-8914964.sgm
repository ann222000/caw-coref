&gt;Valid point my ass.

&gt;I'm talking about pedestrians who are legally in a marked crosswalk
&gt;and yet asshole drivers either aren't paying attention (too busy
&gt;looking he other direction for cross-traffic) or who purposely try to
&gt;intimidate the pedestrians.

&gt;Case in point: at approximately the 2:50 mark, the driver in this
&gt;video fails to yield properly to a group of pedestrians in a marked
&gt;crosswalk. He brush-passes them so close he practically runs over
&gt;their heels. The law requires drivers to wait until the pedestrians
&gt;are sufficiently far away that even if they do an about-face there is
&gt;no chance of them being struck, yet this driver is far too impatient
&gt;for that.

&gt; http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1102772954458963270

&gt;Tell me, what did the pedestrians do wrong in this video? Were they
&gt;&quot;not paying attention?&quot; Or were they merely the unwitting victims of a
&gt;MFFY driver?
">

I saw nothing in the video that would lead me to believe the driver
passed too closely to the pedestrians. In fact, that the pedestrians
never bothered to glance at the car leads me to believe they felt had
sufficient distance from the vehicle to be safe.

The older couple trailing the group leaves the frame at 2:53 into the
video. At about 2:58, the driver appears to be about to cross the line
they were walking beside, so the pedestrians had a good 5 seconds to
clear the lane.

Seemed like a fairly safe and efficient maneuver, IMO. Not like most
of the crap I see when I cross the road daily.

Today the cops were pulling cars out of traffic and giving them smog
checks.  The geek within appreciated the portable dyno on a trailer,
but the inner Racer-X got butterflies.  Even though the Chrysler just
passed first smog with flying colors (160K miles, surprised the heck
outta me, ah BELIEVE in slick-50, can you give me a halleluljah!).  EB
Harvard a couple blocks W of Alton.  Cop waved in Oriental driver in

Told my cow-orker with the drift-special Nissan about it, he had come
up a parallel street.  Was _he_ lucky.

So what head-games could we play with the bluish?  Sneak a smoke-bomb

&quot;About Face&quot; may only be executed from the position of &quot;attention&quot;.

See FM-22-5, (Drill and Ceremonies) Section I (Stationary Movements)
Paragraph  3-4 (Facing at the Halt), Subparagraph (b)-  &quot;turn to the
right 180 degrees on the left heel and ball of the right foot,
resuming the position of attention.   Arms remain at the sides,
as in the position of attention, throughout this movement&quot;.

I believe you have mistaken &quot;About Face&quot; for &quot; Rear March&quot; (Section I,
Paragraph 5-7 Subparagraph (c).
http://35.8.109.2/resources/fm22_5.pdf

And your description of the &quot;law&quot; seems to vary -just a tad- from CA
Section 21950, as it fails to mention any reference to About Face.

According to the car magazines, new cars are going to have flatter
&quot;faces&quot; and be higher in the front in order to conform to new Euro-
pean pedestrian-safety laws.  My first thought upon seeing a reference
to this is always, &quot;Wouldn't it have been more cost-effective simply to
teach people to look both ways before crossing the street?&quot;

That's something we Americans are taught as small children.  It would
appear that European society isn't as advanced as its liberal American
admiriers would have us believe it is.

I pay attention, but I won't stop for anyone unless they've
actually stepped off the curb into the street.  I don't pay
any mind to the timid souls who stay up on the sidewalk.  And
why should I?  For all I know, they'ere just taking in the
view, and it's a coincidence that they happen to be standing
next to a crosswalk.  Any pedestrian who wants me to stop for
him had best make his intentions clear.

I've noticed that women drivers will slam on the brakes for
anyone who's standing within fifty feet of a crosswalk and
looks like they're even considering crossing the street.
One reason for that is that women are such passive drivers.
Another reason is that, outside of the downtown areas of major
cities, most street-crossing pedestrians are women, and so they
can relate.

Ever notice that women pedestrians always have to press the button
for the Walk signal, even when there's no traffic? I had that
happen to me at 4:30 the other morning in Santa Clara.  I was the
only car visible on the road, from one horizon to the other -- and
yet, this dumb broad had to push the button and turn all the lights
red instead of just waiting for me to go by and then hoofing it
across the street.

It was an example of the female serial mind in action -- the same
serial mind that causes women drivers to bring one side of a city
street to its knees by trying to turn left against impossible
traffic, rather than proceeding to the next traffic light and making
a U-turn.  Or  to paralyze an entire parking garage by slamming on
their brakes and waiting for someone to back out of a parking space.

This past Friday, I was behind a woman driver who waited for at least
four minutes for a car to pull out of a parking space on her left in a
small parking lot. But the kicker was there were two adjacent EMPTY
parking spaces to the right of her that she could have easily parked in.

BUT NO... She wanted to park in the space on the left (possible SLIGHTLY
closer to the store).  So she waited, and waited, and waited.

four additional drivers were waiting for us to move so they could

Choosing a space far from the entrance to the store, and nearer to the
exit of the parking lot, seems to avoid these issues for me.

But you want to be far enough from the parking lot entrance/exit that
you don't get blocked in by a line of entering/exiting vehicles.

I'm always amazed by the number of drivers who choose to drive past
store entrances.  I can only assume they expect to find the closest
spot just like they did, once, 20 years ago.

I guess it -could- happen...

I agree with your points if it's a large parking lot like those at
Target, Costco, Home Deport, or at any large shopping center.  But this
was a small corner strip mall U-shape parking lot with two aisles and
about 40 parking spaces all together.  Basically, you enter the lot on
one aisle and circle around to the other aisle looking for an open space.

I generally favor the &quot;close to the exit&quot; approach, for a
quick and easy getaway.  However, there's one way in which
driving past the store entrance can pay off.

Most parking lots are designed with traffic flow in alternating
directions.  The aisles where traffic moves in the direction of
the building are far less likely to have vacant parking spaces
than the ones where traffic moves away from the building.  This
means that I can often score a space that's surprisingly close
in if I bite the bullet and plod through the congestion around
the entrance.

Of course, it's a gamble.  The closer in I am, the more likely
I am to be caught behind someone who slams on the brakes and
waits for another driver to vacate a prime space.  So I only
take a chance on that approach if I'm feeling lucky.

I think I'd have been tempted to get out of my car and go have a

This phenomenon amazes me.  Not just because of the sheer thought-
lessness of it, but because it never seems to occur to these dumb
bimbos that simply parking the goddam car and walking to the store
entrance would get them inside and shopping so much sooner.  And
by the looks of a lot of 'em, they could use the exercise.

But, to borrow a term, it's a spurious conclusion to say they were or

Their state of alertness, however, has no bearing on the five seconds

&gt;&gt; I generally favor the &quot;close to the exit&quot; approach, for a
&gt;&gt; quick and easy getaway.  However, there's one way in which
&gt;&gt; driving past the store entrance can pay off.

&gt;&gt; Most parking lots are designed with traffic flow in alternating
&gt;&gt; directions.  The aisles where traffic moves in the direction of
&gt;&gt; the building are far less likely to have vacant parking spaces
&gt;&gt; than the ones where traffic moves away from the building.  This
&gt;&gt; means that I can often score a space that's surprisingly close
&gt;&gt; in if I bite the bullet and plod through the congestion around
&gt;&gt; the entrance.

&gt; Meanwhile, while you're wading through all the congestion around the
&gt; entrance, I have already parked my car and am walking into the front
&gt; door. I am PART of that congestion you're wading through. :)

&gt; The advantages of parking far away from the front doors are many: you
&gt; spend less time driving to/from the parking lot entrance; fewer people
&gt; parking near you means fewer opportunities for inconsiderate boors to
&gt; ding your car with their doors; walking a little farther is good
&gt; exercise; parking in a well-lighted, highly-visible location near the
&gt; street and the entrance driveway keeps your car safer from theft and
&gt; burglary; AND I can often park my car and walk all the way across the
&gt; parking lot while the the soccermom in her minivan is still circling
&gt; for a close-in space.
">

But at a greater risk to your own personal safety.  Walking through a
parking lot can be hazardous to one's health -- especially the farther
away you are from the store.  It's around the outer fringes of large
parking lots where one tends to encounter the crazed drivers would like
to zip around the parking lot at 35+ MPH, making sharp blind turns while
racing to get the best parking spot.

For me, the less distance I have to walk through a busy parking lot, the
safer I feel.  There are far too many clueless and reckless drivers
roaming around parking lots these days.

Whether I use that technique or park farther away from the entrance
depends on the situation.  It isn't difficult to assess the conditions
and decide which to use.  If I'm at, say, Home Depot on a summer week-
end afternoon, or the Sunnyvale Fry's Electronics during lunch on a
weekday, there's no way in hell I'm going to drive anywhere close to
the store entrance; there's just too much foot traffic.  But at other
times and in other places, that approach works well.

I'll tellya, given that two of my last four cars were totalled, and
a third nearly so, there's a certain Zen-like peace of mind that comes
with driving a car that's mechanically sound but cosmetically, somewhat
less that show quality.

Well, good for you for &quot;doing the needful,&quot; as our Indian
friends like to say, and taking responsibility for avoiding
damage to your car.

One time I was parked at a local shopping center, close in
where the spaces were a bit small (though not small enough
to be marked as compact spaces).  The space to my left was
open when I got out of my car, but when I returned, there
was a brand-new, brght red Toyota pickup paked there.  Four
wheel drive, extended cab, color-coordinated camper shell,
custom wheels, the works.

The space between the Toyota and my car (I was drving a small
first-generation Accord sedan at the time) was so narrow that
I had to contort myself to get into my car.  I've always been
really conscientious about not dinging other people's cars,
and so I placed my hand between the endge of my door and the
side of the truck as I slipped into the driver's seat.

Unfortunately, I had to pull my arm inside my car sooner or
later, and when I did, my car's door tapped the side of the
Toyota pickup, making a small mark.  Not a scrape, but a short
line of beige paint that could've been removed with some pol-
ishing compound.

I cringed inwardly, but reassured myself that I'd honestly
done my best to avoid any damage, however slight, to the
truck...and that if its owner were at all tense about
parking-lot dings, he'd have parked farther out rather
than in the very front row of spaces next to the door of
a shopping mall.

As I put my car into gear after backing out of the parking
space, I looked over at the truck.  There'd been no one
within 50 yards of it when I'd gotten into my car, but the
truck's owner had materialized out of nowehere.  It was
weird, as though Scotty had beamed him down or something.

The guy was leaning over, lightly fingering the tiny mark I'd
placed on his truck like the way someone would rub a bruise on
his own skin.  He was staring at me accusingly, and he had this
comical look of horror and shocked disbelief on his face, as if
to say, &quot;How *could* you?!&quot;

Some people just plain don't understand the principle of cause
and effect.  I had a roommate in college who was like that; he
had a prized poster taped to the inside of the door of our dorm
room, a travel poster for Jamaica -- with a dartboard hung right
above it.  He'd freak out when the occasional, and inevitable,
stray dart would put a hole in the poster.

I tried to explain to him that if he hung a dartboard over the
goddam  poster, he forfeited the right to bitch when a dart hit
it -- and that no matter how careful people were, that was going
to happen.  All that ever did was piss him off.  Well, this guy
with the shiny new Toyota pickup was of the same mindset; if
he didn't want his truck to get dinged, there were more intel-
ligent parking choices he could've made.

&gt;&gt; I rather have the door being dinged than myself being nicked.

&gt; In 1991, I had owned my very first brand new car less than a week when
&gt; some doddering old fool named &quot;Emil&quot; opened his car door into the side
&gt; of my car, leaving a 1&quot; scrape. Sinced that day I have followed my
&gt; parking lot strategy. Since that day I have not received another door
&gt; ding or any other damage on any of my vehicles. Since that day I have
&gt; also not been nicked.

&gt; In short, you're being overly paranoid.
">

Not really, I'm just not overly paranoid about my car being dinged and I
happen to value my safety more.  Besides, during the past three years my
latest car had been scratched only once (no dents).  And that scratch
was easily fixed with a simple application of touch-up paint from the
car dealer.

Still, getting dinged is a risk I accept when I park next to other cars.

To me, it's no big deal.

Scott, it's hard to respect your opinions when you make such broad
accusations.

People who don't care about door dings aren't necessarily the type who
cause them. The reasons for not caring about cosmetic damage to a
vehicle are not definitively linked to blatant disregard for the
property of others. They could be driving a vehicle that has otherwise
been cosmetically compromised and simply feel that further damage to
their own vehicle is insignificant. Perhaps they're they sort who
don't intend to resell their car in several years and aren't concerned
about the devaluation caused by a common door ding. Neither of these
people sound like deranged lunatics engaged in some perpetual parking
lot door demolition derby to me. Unless they sound like that to you, I
think you should reconsider your sweeping accusations.

That would be one option, I guess, but that hardly seems like Brent.

Perhaps the same reason that I have for keeping all manner of auto

I drive a 4x4 Off-Road edition truck.  When I bought it there were
plenty of scratches, and I've added many more driving down trails
where branches stick into the middle.  I like the condition of the
truck because I don't have to cringe when I hear branches scraping
down the side.  Future mods include tree &amp; rock shaped dents.

I've had 2 show quality vehicles in the past, and likely will again.
I have lots of respect for property, both mine and other peoples.

Hey, whatever works.  We each have our own system.

Personally, I think it makes more sense to keep cleaning supplies
in the garage.  I only ever use them when I'm at home, and I dislike
clutter in my car.

There are a few items I keep in the trunk, but they're for on-the-road
contingencies: a small tool kit, an air compressor, a set of jumper
cables, and in case of a flat tire, a pair of work gloves, a plastic
tarp, and a cruciform lug nut wrench.  All that stuff is neatly stowed
in one of those Rubbermaid &quot;Action Packer&quot; plastic crates, which is
secured in the forward end of the trunk with a pair of bungee cords.

The point isn't the number of items in my trunk, or that I carry &quot;some&quot;

useful when I'm on the road.  I only wax my car when I'm at home, so
home is where the wax is.

As for garages, I don't have one, either; that was literary license.
But I do have a storage shed, and it's there that my wax (and tools,
and oil, and car washing stuff) is stored.

Pre-emptive:

And if I didn't have a storage shed, I'd have a closet.

And if I didn't have a closet, I'd be homeless and probably wouldn't
be able to afford to run a car anyway, and the matter would be moot.

No garage here either. Or storage shed. Those are key factors for when
the lady and I go house-hunting next year, but at our current
apartment it's just not an option. I do have closets, but I don't
think she'd be overly appreciative of my taking them over for car
supplies at the moment. For what it's worth, most of the cleaning
supplies are for the interior, save a collapsable squeegee and some
glass cleaner.

I'm a little curious about the air compressor. I know my dad has a
neat little combination air compressor/battery jumper, but I assume
you're carrying something different since you listed jumper cables
separately. How big is the compressor you're carrying? Just wondering
what the size and weight difference is versus the can of Fix-A-Flat I
keep in the back (same principle, should give me enough pressure to
limp it to a location where I can take care of the situation
properly.)

My closet was filled with big auto stuffs.... fenders... a trunk lid...
basically all the spares I had collected up to that point. it made
perfect sense to have the wax and polish in the car at that time ;) Back
in grad school I parked 3 blocks away from my apartment, that's where I
got into the habbit ;)

Ah yes, the female factor; I didn't consider that.  Living by
myself, no one gives me any trouble for leaving the odd case of
Mobil 1 sitting on the floor next to the entertainment center
overnight when I come home tired and don't want to bother taking
it out to the shed.

&gt; I'm a little curious about the air compressor. I know my dad
&gt; has a neat little combination air compressor/battery jumper,
&gt; but I assume you're carrying something different since you
&gt; listed jumper cables separately. How big is the compressor
&gt; you're carrying?

Well, I keep it packed in the box it came in, which is about
the size of a shoebox only not quite as deep.  It weighs three
or four pounds.  I got it at Sears; the last time I looked, the
same model was still being offered.  It plugs into the cigarette
lighter.  I think the price is about $35.

The advantage of a compressor over Fix-A-Flat is that it can be
used for routine pumping up of the tires, not just for emergencies.
