Some of you will  remember the   film a  week or so ago  and the
discussions about how the blind parents were relying on the older  child.

The BBC  has since  done some interviews  about the film.

The following is a transcript  of the BBC  Radio programm "INTOUCH"
presented by  Peter  White.

White
Good evening.

Our discussion last week with producer Jane Treays about her Channel 4
programme.   It portrayed at couple who were visually impaired, and who had
other disabilities, bringing up a family of six.  The premise of the film
was that the two eldest daughters were losing their childhood, because of
the amount of support they were required to provide to their parents.
Well I don't think I can ever remember reaction to anything we've done
being more polarised between visually impaired and sighted listeners, with
those who are blind or partially sighted deeply worried and angry that the
film had misrepresented the extent to which blindness is generally a bar
to bringing up children, and it caused many good blind parents a great deal
of harm, and then sighted listeners saying either that we're worrying
unnecessarily about that, or that we're being over-sensitive and even paranoid.
Judge for yourselves.

Feedback from listeners
"I am a sighted listener and I was dismayed to hear that some blind people
were upset by the programme.  It was very clear to me that it was not saying
that blind parents couldn't cope with child rearing but that this particular
couple were over-dependent on their daughters.  Seeing the programme ..."

"I am a blind parent with two grown up children.  Already my adult children
have been asked how their parents coped and what out of the ordinary things
they had to do to help.  Frankly they were embarrassed ..."

"Although I can see that the blind couple involved had a point, I can also see
that the producer who volunteered her time had a point too.  What I cannot
see is why the producers of In Touch felt it was appropriate for the BBC to
so clearly take sides in the discussion and for Peter White to harass the
producer.  No attempt was made to address the point she raised but she was
bullied by White for not sharing his views ..."

"I switched off at the point where the interviewer was giving the 15-year-old
what amounted to the third degree.  Her attitude, far from being sympathetic
was extremely judgmental.  Why, for instance, should blind people not have
a drink or smoke any less than the rest of us ..."

"As a blind non-parent I was horrified by the Channel 4 programme and the way
in which it depicted the parents.  The filmmaker quite obviously simply did
not understand just how badly she was portraying the vast majority of blind
"parents ..."

"The film called for compassion for child carers and indirectly drew attention
to Your Carers - a charity.  Viewers of an average sensibility could judge
from the carers' eyes and body language that the film wasn't contrived nor
manipulated.  Your programme hijacked the child carers' issue, drawing
attention entirely to the blind ..."

"In last night's programme I found myself firmly on the side of the TV
producer.  Far from thinking that the TV programme showed the blind in a bad
light I rejoiced in the fact that despite parental disabilities and some
obvious sibling rivalry the family seemed very happy ..."

"I'm not visually impaired.  I agree with the visually impaired audience.
As an objective observer I felt that the film was a misrepresentation of
blind and visually impaired people ..."

"As a totally blind person with no children I feel sorry for all my blind
friends who took their children to school this morning, knowing that some of
the public would have seen this programme and would be judging them."

White
Well in a moment we'll be discussing these issues with both the Channel 4
commissioning editor who bought the programme, and with a highly experienced
and respected blind TV programme-maker.

But first, we were contacted after our programme by the father of the
family which featured so large in the film. We're calling him simply Paul, as
the programme did, and he and his eldest daughter Louise join us on the line.

Paul, first of all, we were told last week by the producer, Jane Treays, that
you and Amanda were completely happy with the film, having seen it twice.
Were you, is that true?

Paul
I wasn't happy with it - the way we was portrayed.  We wasn't actually sure
if that was what was going to go out as a finished article because we thought
there may have been more of the other family involved as well.

White
Can I ask you - I mean why did you agree to do the film in the first place?

Paul
We actually thought we'd be doing a - helping out the Young Carers organisation
by trying to highlight the fact that there is young carers and children that
do help their parents.  Whether they be blind or any other disabilities as well.

White
And what have the reactions been like since the programme went out?

Paul
Well we've been virtually a prisoner in our own home, frightened to go out,
myself and the wife, because the amount of hate e-mail against us shown on
some internet websites has been absolutely phenomenal.  Louise did react with
quite a strong e-mail on one of the internet sites telling people, you know,
back off, leave us alone.

White
Can I bring Louise in at this point?  I mean Louise, you I think have been
on the internet, what kind of things have you seen that have been said about
you - you and your family?

Louise
They're saying that we're doing too much, we should be taking off our parents,
rats running around the place, we're not brought up properly.

White
I mean the impression that people have come away with and which was the
concern of the film was that you and Jenny were having to do far too much for
your parents and that you were being robbed of your childhood.  What would
you say is the truth of that situation?

Louise
My mum and dad ask us if we'd like to do something but we either say yes we'll
do it or no we can't be bothered and they either do it their self or me and
Jenny go and do it.  But like the film crew pushed us further to do more stuff,
saying it would look good on TV.

White
Some people, Paul, including blind listeners, have been critical of you as
parents and the implication being that this has harmed other blind parents,

how do you react to that?

Paul
I think it's disgraceful that the way that Jane portrayed us as blind
parents.  I mean she should have shown a lot more of what we do, do and not
pushed and made it look like the girls do it all, which I feel is a very
unfair portrayal and obviously I can only apologise to other visually impaired
listeners as well.  If I'd have known that she was going to portray us like
that I'd have never done the programme.

White
Paul and Louise, thank you very much indeed.

Well joining us now and listening to that is Meredith Chambers, who's
Commissioning Editor for Documentaries at Channel 4.

Meredith, first of all, this is not just complaints from our programme, to
date Ofcom has received 97 complaints, they've told us, and we know that a
number of big charities have also written to them and to Channel 4 - that
includes the RNIB, the Children's Society, the NSPCC, the Princess Royal's
Carers Trust and also the Disabled Parents Network.  So this is not just a few
people having a moan.

Chambers
It's true but at the same token I'm aware of a lot of e-mails that I've read
are ones saying well done for airing this difficult subject in this way.

White
I don't think anyone, including a lot of blind listeners, would object to you
airing the subject or indeed, as was suggested, weren't concerned about the
children.  What they were concerned about is the fact that in doing that it
was completely ignored that many blind people bring up children very
successfully and it would only have taken really a line to have pointed this
out to have probably prevented a lot of this reaction.

Chambers
This particular programme was a programme about young carers and I think the
issues that were raised in those families were about a number of people -
about a number of things but they were issues about choices in terms of the
way one parents, they were issues about a number of things and that's the
human experience, the human experience is one that has a diverse number of
factors.  One of the issues in Paul and Amanda's family is one of blindness
but there are other issues going on there.

White
But you really wouldn't have thought that there were other issues than the
blindness in some of the scripting and in some of the ways it was shown.
It was stated, for example, that Paul and Amanda couldn't cook, it was stated
that they couldn't change nappies, they could do a lot of those things, it
was suggested that they couldn't drive a car - with the implication being that
that would be dreadful for children.

Chambers
It's certainly true those numbers of things were stated and those number of
things are true.  I think what's also true in that family is that there a
number of children and that people have other issues.  What Paul said in the
programme was that he wanted to prove we can do it, he said some people
make assumptions that we can't, it's up to us to prove the critics wrong.
I think that film was a reasonably fair and true observation of life in that
household.

White
This is, to some extent, a question of perception isn't it, and minorities
are particularly vulnerable to portrayal that can be seen as archetypal and
that's really at the heart of what blind people have objected to - that this
portrayal, without any kind of balancing explanation of what blind people
could do - would have a very bad effect on the perception of blind people as
parents.  Did nobody think of that in Channel 4?

Chambers
I think that life is complex in the documentaries we transmit and all our
programmes across the board.

White
Well wasn't this documentary simplistic rather than complex?

I don't know about you Derek, but I thought that the blind couple needed
a swift kick up the arse for being so feckless.

That is not to say that sighted people do not treat their kids in the
same way, many do. It was just that they were just using their
disability as an excuse to offload the responsibility of their youngest
children to their daughters.

I don't know of any other people with disabilities (sight or otherwise)
that behave like this.

However, I do know plenty of able bodied families in places like
Wythenshawe in Manchester that behave like that.
