... of today's kids.

I'm a big movie fan.  Next to gaming, it's probably my biggest
techno-hobby.  I've loved movies ever since I was a little kid.
Today, I love my movie collection as much as my games, and I
eagerly watch my mailbox to see what flicks Amazon will deliver
for me each week.  Of course, I like high-quality DVDs and Blu-Ray
discs, and I don't have much use for VOD downloads.  I don't really
have any enthusiasm for the rental services offered by the XBox 360
and PS3.

However... looking back... I would have loved this as a kid.
When I was a kid, I lived in a rural area where there was NOTHING
within walking distance.  If you wanted to rent a movie, you had to
drive several miles to rent a VHS tape. (I was on a first-name basis
with the local tape rental store) I could order a movie out of a
catalog (in the days before the internet, you actually wrote down
what you wanted, mailed it to the company, and they mailed you stuff
after about a month) but that would require me to have a credit card
or a checkbook, and I had neither.  If you wanted a movie and your
parents weren't around, you were S-C-R-E-W-E-D.

But dang... if I had something like the 360 when I was nine years
old, I'd have been in paradise!  Not only could I rent any movie they
had without leaving my house... but I wouldn't need a credit card!
Just XBL points, which I could buy with my allowance money!  Man,
when I think of how many times I scrounged for spare change so I
could rent a tape...

Today, I'll probably never use the video download services since
I have the resources to get what I want on disc... but after thinking
about it, I'll probably never be able to rag on these VOD services
like I used to.  There's too many kids out there hoarding their
allowance money just to rent movies... this is a godsend for them.

Don't blow it, kids.

Heh..I have access to the service for 360, but when I was a kid...
there weren't no such thing as VHS tapes or cable (or videogames
for that matter; Pong came out when I was 10) I had seen a service
called Qube in Columbus at a sister's house when I was 14 or so,
and the first time we had cable was when I was 18 years old.
Closest movie theater for me was at the old Lockbourne AF Base
(now Rickenbacker) near Groveport OH.; a friend's father
was an NCO on base, so I could go with him.
We woulda killed to have had such a service then, but then
again, money was tight for a family with 9 kids in it...
OTOH, courtesy of my mother's large book collection, I never
lacked for reading material. Man, now I'm feelin' old..^_^

Now if I would have come here talking about my PS3, I'd have been

You, sir, have found a way to &quot;cleverly disguise&quot; your &quot;pro 360

But I noticed, just to let you know.

Where in the above did I indicate a preference for the 360?  I do
believe I
made a point to say the PS3 had a similar service.

Where in the above did I have any of my facts wrong?

Where in the above did I delve into fanboy ranting about how my system
was better than _____?  (BTW, I do not own a PS3 or 360)

You want to start noticing stuff?  Try noticing why you get flamed and
I don't.
I respect this group, it's charter, and its participants.  You, on the
other hand,
frequently do not.

Wah, why me????

That's what we see from you, space cadet.

Many of us have current systems, but they are an evolutionary place.  We
hold passions to our collections.

You, on the other hand, rant on about how the ps3 (piece of shit, the
third) is the saviour of video games today.  You drone on repeatedly on
the PS3, where others mention on occasion the 360.  But we don't
evangelize the newer stuff, and try to convert others to our way of
thinking, as you ALWAYS have.

All I'm seeing is being able to watch movies and shows
on a 360; Can you do that on another current-gen
system?

I repeat; CAN you DL TV shows and movies on a PS3?
IF you cannot, then the conspiracy theories,
like most conspiracy theories, come off as just
more paranoid ravings.
