The Wretched Years

By William Rivers Pitt
Created Oct 15 2006 - 10:22am

"History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with
courage, need not be lived again."
- Maya Angelou

George W. Bush gave a press conference this past Wednesday in an attempt to
snatch back the conversation from North Korea's nukes and Mark Foley's
instant messages. A reporter from CNN asked him about the Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health report that puts the civilian death toll
in Iraq at 655,000. "I am, you know, amazed that this is a society which so
wants to be free that they're willing to - you know, that there's a level of
violence that they tolerate," he responded.

Yes. That's what he said.

This is, to a degree, not terribly surprising. Mr. Bush has a penchant for
casually saying the most abominable things imaginable without blinking.
Recall, if you will, the days following the attacks of September 11th. A
pall of poison smoke still hung low over New York City. Americans were
suddenly living in fear of blue skies and airplanes. The as-yet-unsolved
anthrax attacks on Congress and the media had us all collecting our mail
with oven mitts while holding our breath.

On October 4th, 2001, less than a month after the attacks, Mr. Bush said,
"We need to counter the shock wave of the evildoer by having individual rate
cuts accelerated and by thinking about tax rebates."

Yes. That's what he said.

These two statements serve as bookends for the wretched years we have
endured. The worst attack in American history is used to pimp a plan for tax
cuts, and the unimaginable slaughter of Iraqi civilians is a platform for
praising the survivors of the carnage because they are so darned good at
tolerating it.

What will history have to say about these times? History, it has often been
said, is written by the victors, but who really wins anything after all
this? If the most delectable left-wing fantasies come true - the Democrats
take Congress in November, Bush and his cronies are impeached by a
fire-breathing Conyers Judiciary Committee - little will be left to win.

People will still be dying in Iraq and Afghanistan. New Orleans will still
be destroyed. The environment will still be poisoned. Laws that all but
eviscerate the Bill of Rights will still be on the books. The same
unimaginably wealthy industrialists will still have the same clout. The news
media will still be controlled by people whose interests lie far afield from
telling us the truth.

Much of this can be undone or contained, to be sure, except for all the
death. The laws can be rolled back. Sensible policies can be applied to the
wars we are losing. New Orleans can be rebuilt. The media can be
re-regulated. With a proper amount of effort and attention, most of the
damage that has been done can be fixed. Except for all the death.

But that is not winning, not really, because the problem is not so much that
these things happened and now have to be fixed. The problem is that they
were allowed to happen at all. A lot of things have gone astonishingly wrong
in America if a passage of time such as this exists in the first place. It
has happened, all of it. This is no long nightmare. It is as real as the
nose on your face.

It is a disgrace, a scar on our history and our consciousness. Worse, the
fact that all this did happen means it can happen again. The power-hungry
now have a marvelous blueprint for the unmaking of a republic, and they will
likely be surprised at how trifling easy it is to pull off. Americans, it
seems, have at least one thing in common with Iraqis. We are great,
apparently, at tolerating the intolerable.

Is George W. Bush the cause of all this, or merely a symptom? I used to be
fond of telling people that blaming Bush for everything that has gone wrong
is like blaming Mickey Mouse when Disney screws up. This is still true, to a
large degree. But then again, he said those things. Perhaps he is a little
of both.

History is written by the winners. Be it resolved, then, that winning means
trying to fix everything that is broken, that it means holding the proper
people accountable for their actions. Be it likewise resolved that winning
means not forgetting, that it means something good absolutely must come from
these wretched years. If that good boils down to two words - "Never Again" -
then that is victory enough.
