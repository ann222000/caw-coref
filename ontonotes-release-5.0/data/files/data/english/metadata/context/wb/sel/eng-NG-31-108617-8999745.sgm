It will get easier as we move out. From Mars-Phobos-Deimos, Earth will
sway back and forth across the sun 66 degrees over a period of 2 1/7 years.

From Wolf or Alpha Centauri, Sol will be a fixed star in a constellation.

If the Sol happens to lie on a star system's axis of rotation it'd be
real easy - Just look towards a fixed point in the sky as we do with the
Polaris.

26th century Islam will need fewer chiropractors than 22nd.

But they also have their flaws. When taken to an extreme, as
seems to be the case with Islam, such control structures do
far more harm than good. The real world is coevolutionary.
All things need to change and evolve to ensure a better
future. Â An unchanging morality is a man-made flaw
that defies nature and tends to destroy.

I think almost all of the horrors of humanity can be
laid firmly in the laps of man-made concepts that
attempt to control nature. Whether that man-made
control structure is morality, religion, military
or economic dictatorships and so on, a rigid
control structure generally dooms all that
come within it's grasp to endless conflict
and total destruction.

Just look at the last century. Almost every
major crime against humanity began with
the few imposing their rigid structure on
the many.

When the control structure flows from the
many, just the opposite occurs. A democracy
constantly changes which naturally brings
it into conflict with anything unchanging.

It is entirely obvious why the US and extreme
Islam is in conflict as they represent the
greatest examples of each type of control
system. One is changing too fast perhaps.
The other wanting to return too far in time.

Such opposite extremes are destined for
conflict, it is natural. Just as natural as the
eventual outcome. Which is a synthesis
of opposite extremes, so one can't
tell which-is-which.

Which would be a single system where democracy
and religion are fervently worshipped. Unfortunately, as
long as religion beleives in an unchanging (man-made)
structure the two cannot possibly coexist
and are destined for conflict.

The only way to reconcile this timeless struggle
is really quite simple.

We must worship Nature as God.
Bringing science into religion, as nature
is open to rational observation.
Our morality and control structure must
mimic what nature does.

The processes which are responsible for life
from lifelessness, and intelligence from instinct
are our Creator. We should worship that which
evolves. In this way religion and democracy become
dedicated partners coevolving to the optimum
...all by itself.

And of course one of the things that got the ball rolling was the
&quot;Bomber Gap&quot; followed by the &quot;Missile Gap&quot;, both of which proved to be
illusionary. Eisenhower was right to warn us about the
military-industrial complex in his farewell speech; once that thing got
rolling there was no way to stop it then, or now. And the unfortunate
thing is that after the taxpayers foot the bill for all the fancy
weapons they have to be used somewhere to show them they are getting
their money's worth...so then it's time to start a war somewhere.
Kennedy took the money being spent on a huge arms build-up, and threw a
huge space program in on the side, with the proceeds from both going to
many of the same companies.
The massive spending on &quot;Homeland Security&quot; is the latest incarnation of
this. A whole new way of justifying massive spending on high-tech
widgets whose main concept seems to be a lot more related to spying on
our own citizens than spying on enemies
who have snuck in when no one was looking. Even the name &quot;Homeland
Security&quot; has a Stalinist/Nazi ring about it, rather like Minipax and
Minitrue out of 1984, or or wonderfully ironically named &quot;Patriot Act&quot;
which primarily seems to be about removing the constitutional rights
real patriots fought and died for during our history. Why should we
worry about Arabs taking away our liberties when we are quite willing to
do it all on our own?
It's amazing how Orwell hit the nail right on the head in his book; the
president has promised us we will be battling radical Islam for decades
to come, whether they are battling us or not. If they attack us, then it
shows how wise we were to guard against them, and how more effort is
needed...if they don't attack us, then that shows how well our efforts
have succeeded, and how even more effort is needed to continue to keep
us safe.

Yes, and what I see is that extreme Islam is dominating
and defining Islam. With a system we are looking for the
primary forces that are causing the...change.
It is the change that is being studied, and what caused it
not so much the system itself.

Objective methods almost always try to look at system details
when it's near or at equilibrium. Complexity science looks
for a system driven /far from equilibrium/ and studies what
caused it

A rumor, for instance, that drives down a stock price.
Or a political movement, that takes a nation to war.

The beautiful thing about this approach is that how a
system responds to the event/distubance tells you
the basic relationships of the primary system variables
that are hidden within the system. Â So you don't have to
study the Â system details, they become irrelevant
and obvious at the edge.

The question in complexity science would be &quot;Is that an
external force (rumor) or internal force (fact) Â that has
caused the change in system behavior?&quot;
A simple qualitative question. Where precise quantities
aren't very important. A subjective approach.

If a stock price suddenly plunged due to some
rumor or event, it would be /very nice/ to know
with certainty whether the rumor was true or not.
As if I were some insider with access to the true
internal facts of that system. Which of course
is not possible beyond a few companies
a typical person might have some insider
access to.

If it's true, then the change is likely to persist.
If it's some bloody rumor...look-out...the price
is certain to rebound once that becomes clear.

And here's how to tell. If the system is driven
far enough from equilibrium, just to it's own
breaking or phase transition point, the system
will respond in only one of two possible ways.
At the edge, there are only two possible choices
of behavior. Just as with a body of water heated
right to the boiling point, but not quite.
Either water or vapor. No other choices as even
the slightest change will force it into one basin
or the other. In non-living systems it's very hard to
maintain an edge state for long.

And this bifurcation takes place just as the system
is approaching the (complex) bottom, in time to do
something about it.

So you see I can essentially have insider like knowledge
concerning the character of the disturbance for...any...
stock at all. Anywhere the change is sufficient to drive
it to it's own edge of chaos. Which also happens
to define the point of highest system volatility.
....where the price change and potential is at
a maximum.

Or, the only place where a complex dynamic system
...a real world messy system such as the weather...
..or art...or philosophy...or public opinion..or flocks
becomes simple and predictable is at the edge of chaos.
Where predictability and volatility converge to
simultaneous maximums.

As in a thunderstorm, or a hurricane
We have all watched such things cycle over and over
so that we can look at them and say with confidence...
&quot;I know what they will be doing tomorrow.&quot;
And with only minimum system detailed knowledge.
I mean...once you hear that first crack of lightning
you know a rainshower is coming. When a hurricane
just hits land, you know it'll fall apart. The edge of chaos
signals these basic phase changes in...any...complex
dynamic system.

You see, if you play a stock chart like you play the
weather, and practice, you can figure out what'll
happen for a few days. Which in a highly volatile
stock aleady poised at the bottom/edge
...is more than enough time.

This frame of reference change of complexity
science makes the real world messy systems
to easiest of all to predict. Provided you have the
luxury to sit and wait for them to ...come to you.
You wait for the system to be driven to it's own
edge of chaos.

I mean it's simple, if you inverse your frame of
reference you inverse the results.
From objective to subjective.
From the input to the output
From equilibrium to the breaking point.
From quantitative to qualitative.
From the simplest the universe has to
offer, particles, to the most complex...life
as a source of fundamental law.

From studying reality in two seperate
ways, classical and quantum.
To looking to where the two realms are already one
and starting over from scratch.

&quot;Modern science&quot; starts with the simplest particle.
Chaos theory starts with a simple everyday cloud.
A system already poised at its own edge or transition
point between opposite and simple extremes
in possibility.

I give cold war anxiety some credit for stampeding us into the
non-optimal Apollo architecture. But that's not what I was thinking of.

Turn on the radio and you can hear songs glorifying alcohol and drug
abuse, prostitution, and violent crime. Pornography is everywhere. A lot
of kids at our school have no dads at home and some don't even know who
their dads are.

A few years ago I was very enthusiastic about substitute teaching. That
enthusiasm dampened when I found high school kids who didn't know how to
do long division, or even their times tables. Many didn't even
understand decimal notation, they couldn't tell you if 4.34 was greater
than 4.25.

Over the lunch hour groups of kids would go to a house about a 1/4 mile
north of campus. After they came back they were unable to learn,nor
would they let other students learn. The drugs kids have access to now
are much more addictive and destructive than the ones floating around
when I was a kid.

When I was a kid students were often paddled. A child punished at school
could count on getting punished again when he got home.

Now paddling a child will get a teacher a law suit. If a child gets into
trouble at school, many parents could care less. Parents who do care
enough to discipline their child can run afoul of Child Protective Services.

The current issue of Discover Magazine laments the erosion of U.S.
competence in science. They make President Bush the scapegoat. While I
don't particularly care for Bush, I don't blame him for the Britney
Spears zeitgeist we find ourselves in. In my opinion, a good portion of
the blame belongs to media whores like the Gucciones (who own Discover,
Spin, and used to own Pent House).

The last one is &quot;Penthouse&quot;; I know this, because pornography is

Although &quot;Pent House&quot; might be a clever name for a television show about

of Â &quot;This Old Quonset Hut&quot; for generals.
Anyway, back when I was in school, it was &quot;multiplication&quot; tables, not
&quot;times&quot; tables.
And if we misbehaved, we were sentenced to die in the arena as sport for
the Roman mob.
You try that nowadays, and they'd crucify you. ;-)

Pretty much all magazines for that matter; National Geographic is
getting mighty slim, and the news magazines are so thin they look like
store sales brochures.
Of course this started quite a ways back - Tom Wolfe had a ball tearing
The New Yorker a new asshole back in 1965:

I have a copy of a Mechanix Illustrated magazine from 1956, and it's
truly amazing to think they could whip up something that had that much
packed into it on a monthly basis; it's 224 pages long, and has 54
separate articles and departments in it...even the table of contents is
two pages long, and there is virtually no square centimeter of printable
page area that doesn't have either writing or a illustration on it.

Guilty as charged.

But the fact I indulged in stupid behavior doesn't make it right.
Perhaps having two daughters contributed to my change of attitude.

Our generation should've made more progress than we did to make our

I'm not going to get into &quot;decline and fall&quot; or culture wars:

1) because I'm not convinced (at 57, FWIW) that there *is* more to it
than old-fartitis. One can choose to remember Yeager and Hickam and
young X-15 pilot Neil Armstrong as emblematic, and ignore the fact
that the 1950s had plenty of their own &quot;decline and fall&quot; concerns
about teen gangs, rock &amp; roll, rigged quiz shows, etc., etc. YMMV.

2) because you don't *need* such broad changes in &quot;cultural mores&quot; (is
there another kind?) to explain why we're still &quot;dicking around in
LEO.&quot;

Whatever the broad cultural context, the Cold War and its cranked-up
concerns about national security and national prestige were the
necessary and sufficient proximate reasons why we and the USSR

1) spent several Apollo budgets each from the late 1940s to early
1960s pushing V2-level technology into the array of technologies --
big liquid-propellant engines, avionics, advanced materials, cryogenic
handling, tracking, re-entry, etc. -- that made the 1957-1969 space
race possible

2) from Sputnik onward, applied those technologies to satellites and
then human spaceflight.

In other words, eliminate the Cold War from the picture, and even with
the best of your idealized 1950s &quot;mores&quot; -- and Yeager and Hickam and
Armstrong and von Braun, too -- there simply wouldn't have been
anything like enough scale and duration of funding to get into space
by the 1960s (or IMHO the 1970s or 1980s).

By the same token, there's an explanation for the slowdown and
&quot;plateau&quot; after Apollo that doesn't require any broad cultural lament
about how we Lost the Vision yadda yadda yadda:

Even as the space race was proceeding, the military planners of the US
and USSR were gradually realizing that ICBMs with thermonuclear
warheads, plus good surveillance satellites, were &quot;good enough&quot; in a
fundamental sense. They didn't really *need* the nuclear-powered
bomber, or Dyna-Soar and other HyperSanger skip-glide spaceplanes, or
the manned orbital reconnaissance/battle station, as much as they had
thought in 1955-1960: once you can push a button and blow up Moscow or
Washington DC in ~22 minutes, those goodies didn't (and don't today)
offer enough additional strategic bang/buck to justify their
incremental cost.

So from the early 1960s on, the DoD money increasingly went to
refining that model: multiple basing/platforms, solid fuels for
storeabilty and quick launch, ever-better guidance, ever-better early
warning systems... all techno-cool enough, but no longer the Â huge _de
facto_ subsidy towards space that the ICBM efforts had been. Again:
take away whatever 1960s-and-after cultural changes you don't like,
and that would *still* hold true

Bottom line: from 1957 to 1969, we enthusiasts piggybacked our own
&quot;let's start the endless Conquest of Space&quot; -- a minority goal -- on
the national, or at least working-majority, goal of &quot;let's beat the
Reds [in missiles and in space].&quot; And we *did* beat them. And then the
rest of the country, predictably, returned to more typical,
terrestrial concerns... while ever since, the space fans have kept
beating the big drum and looking over their shoulder, wondering what
happened to the rest of the parade.

I find my version, which deals with why actual money and engineering
effort was applied (or not applied) to actual space-related
technologies, more compelling than a lot of handwaving about '&quot;mores.&quot;
I think we're still dicking around in LEO simply because we haven't
yet applied the money and effort needed to master the art of *getting*
to LEO at a reasonable cost -- and until we do, activity beyond LEO,
no matter how inspiring, is going to remain limited and sporadic.

But if you think it's more useful to explain the same history in terms
of pornography and drugs and rap and not being able to paddle
disobedient students, that's your privilege.

Don't blame me, Tavistock is where Mr. Pither was when he fell off the
bicycle and was knocked unconscious, only to be picked up by Mr.
Gulliver in the sketch. They ended up at the North Cornwall District
Hospital after Mr. Gulliver picked him up and their car crashed:

Anyway, the names in what will soon be redivided into Scotland, Wales,
and New Ireland are confusing.
The Parliament Of New Ireland, located in Dublondon, shall have to be
consulted regarding this. ;-)

It's a bit, ummm, geographically challenged to say the least. He's in
East Devon for nearly a fortnight, finally gets over the Moor to West
Devon, tells the hospital in Cornwall that he was still in Somerset at
the time of the accident and never gets within 20 miles of Bude.

Probably following signs for Porthemmet.

If you're going to split hairs, I'm going to piss off. ;-)
You note that the script says they show him bicycling through East
Devon, Â but have him saying he's touring North Cornwall.
So maybe it's supposed to be a joke of some sort, that the English
audience is supposed to get, but flies right over our heads in America.
I think MP had a lot of humor in it that was very tied to Britain and
the things going on in the news when the shows were broadcast...I'm
fairly sure the Piranha brothers are based on the Cray brothers, for
instance...they would have probably been amazed to know that the show
they were turning out was going to join Chaplin, Laural &amp; Hardy and The
Marx Brothers as one of the all-time works of comic genius, and even
eclipse &quot;Not Only, But Also&quot; and &quot;The Goon Shoe&quot; as the funniest thing
Britain ever came up with in ensemble comedy, except for the secret
&quot;Lethally Funny Joke&quot; from WW II, of course.
My two faves are still &quot;AbFab&quot; and &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; for British comedy.
In Basil Fawlty, Cleese created one of the greatest comedy figures ever,
right up there with Seller's Inspector Clouseau.
In a interview with Cleese, he said he couldn't understand why people
liked Basil, as he was a pretty awful person when you came right down to
it. What he didn't realize was Basil was Everyman; the person whose bad
karma was going to screw up his life, and the way he was going to react
to that was through more bad karma in a ever-increasing spiral until one
day he just had a aneurysm and fell over dead while frothing at the
mouth in his anger at the world.
Our cars all break down, and when they do, who doesn't have the instinct
to rip a branch off of the nearest tree and start beating the crap out
of the car with it? Basil just does what we all want to do...and feel
frustrated because we can't do it, because it wouldn't be &quot;right&quot; or
&quot;smart&quot; to do. So we're on his side. :-)
I always thought it would be wonderful to do a movie where Patsy and
Eddy showed up at Fawlty Towers, because those two would be his guests
from hell, and as soon as they figured out what he thought of them, they
would set out to destroy him as only they could. :-P

I'm going to have to find a video of the sketch and see if I can spot
any of the actual towns, or if it's all bits of Ealing Broadway as
usual.

I'd have thought the sketch would have stuck in my mind more, at the

Tavistock had got a mention.

&gt; they would have probably been amazed to know that the show
&gt; they were turning out was going to join Chaplin,

British!

&gt; Laurel &amp; Hardy

Half British!

&gt; and The Marx Brothers

Ummm, visited Britain!?

Sounds like the sort of thing that could get revisited for Red Nose day
or a Secret Policemans Ball if Amnesty ever get over the last one.

Here's the actual quote from the beginning of the sketch script,
regarding the scene:
&quot;The green lush Devon countryside. Theme music. The camera is tracking
along a hedgerow beside the road. We see a head whizzing along,
sometimes just above the hedgerow and sometimes bobbing out of sight,
occasionally for long periods.&quot;
As I said, here in America the difference between Devon and Cornwall is
about as easy to recognize by name...and what it looks like...as the
difference between the Great Salt Flats and the summits of the Rocky
Mountains would be to the British.

American humour has a lot of jokes that are tied to America - but some
