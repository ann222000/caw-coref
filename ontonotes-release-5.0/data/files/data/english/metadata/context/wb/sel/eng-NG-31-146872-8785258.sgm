Here's a proposal, for a &quot;title trigger&quot;, an alternative to the
abbr-design pattern. Patrick Lauke did mention it originally, some time
ago, but it seems to have been overlooked:

Use a class name; say &quot;ufusetitle&quot; (for &quot;microformat, use title&quot;) or
something equally unlikely to otherwise occur in the wild, on any
element, to trigger the use of the title attribute.

e.g.
&lt;span
class=&quot;dtstart ufusetitle&quot;
title=&quot;2007-08-16&quot;
&gt;

16th August this year

&lt;/span&gt;

It strikes me as simple, easy to learn, easy to author and easy for
parsers to adapt to.

It has the added advantages of working on *any* element; and being
usable on CMSs (e.g. MediaWiki) which do not allow use of 'abbr'.

There's more, at:

I'm not so sure it is that simple. It also feels like it's aimed at
making life easier for parsers at the expense of publishers (although
that is also kind of true of the abbr design pattern too).

This is a reasonably good solution. For what it's worth, I'm
waiting until this very long-standing issue has been resolved
before implementing hCalendar and hAtom for my CMS software.
(It already supports XMDP, XFN, rel-tag, rel-license and hCard.)

Really, microformats.org needs to &quot;bless&quot; one of the many
replacements for the abbr-design-pattern. I'm sure I'm not the
only one who's waiting for a clear direction before proceeding.

PS: I'm still looking for feedback on my metadata profile
&lt; http://demiblog.org/schemes/metadata?ver=0.2.3 &gt;. Does it comply
with the spirit of the XMDP spec (I know it slightly deviates from
the letter)? How about GRDDL?

Read the class name as &quot;has microformat-usable title&quot;.

I don't see what that would add, or how it would be easier for publishers.

That's true enough; but the availability of microformat in Firefox 3
(towards the end of 2007?) will be a notable watershed, and raise the
level of awareness, and this use, in the wider community.

It would be good to have a resolution before then, if possible within the
above constraints, in order that people do not least bad (&quot;abbr-abuse&quot;)
practise which we must then expend energy attempting to &quot;unteach&quot;.

Indeed, in an ideal world, I would have a moratorium on new proposals, and
tidy up several that are either actively being developed, or on a
back-burner, before then; including hAudio, species, currency and measure;
but I realise that that may not be possible with a volunteer community,
and should not be done at the expense of rushing through bad decisions.

The HTML 4 spec (which XHTML 1.x specs use as a normative reference)
defines a valid use of the class attribute as being:

* For general purpose processing by user agents

which I'd say covers this usage.

Whatsmore, I'd disagree that it's an instruction any more than the href
attribute for &lt;a&gt;. It's a pointer to a particular location where some data
is kept: not an instruction to do something in particular with that data.

Personally, I'd also be in favour of:

&lt;span class=&quot;dtstart value:2007-08-16&quot;&gt;16 Aug&lt;/span&gt;

Colon and dashes are allowed values for class names in HTML. Not 100% sure
about the plus sign which is needed for timezones, but I think that's
allowed in class names too.

Though this is likely the best place to ask abou XMDP, there aren't
many here with significant experience authoring XMDP documents.

Questions about GRDDL would probably best be directed towards the
GRDDL working group.

I see assertions about the correct use of the class attribute stated
quite a bit, as well as criticisms of particular uses as being
abuses, anti patterns and so on. I don't want to weigh into any
specific debates, but do want to draw people's attention to the
specification itself, from which in the first instance at least,
justification for any such arguments needs to be drawn.

HTML401 defines the class attribute thus
&quot;The class attribute, on the other hand, assigns one or more class
names to an element; the element may be said to belong to these
classes. A class name may be shared by several element instances. The
class attribute has several roles in HTML:

As a style sheet selector (when an author wishes to assign style
information to a set of elements).
For general purpose processing by user agents.&quot; [1]

So, in effect, all the uses we make of the class attribute outside of
using it for CSS selectors fall into the heading of &quot;general purpose
processing&quot;.

In that, there's no mention of using class for semantics (which is a
use pattern developed over time and sanctioned by convention), of
restrictions for data over description, and indeed, Andy's suggestion
of  &quot;ufusetitle&quot; is arguably more strictly speaking for &quot;general
purpose processing&quot; than applying a class value for semantic purposes
(though the name 'class' does imply classification, taxonomies, and
semantics more generally).

Microformats have made use of clever interpretations of the HTML
specification, and discovering appropriate uses of little used
elements and attributes, or through intelligent interpretations of
their definitions. Perhaps we are overlooking powerful and useful
features of HTML, such as using class (and id) for 'general purpose
processing'?

This seems somewhat clumsy to me, since a conforming HTML parser
should read
&lt;abbr class=&quot;honorific-suffix&quot; title=&quot;Doctor of Philosophy&quot;&gt;Ph.D&lt;/a&gt;
as something along the lines of 'Ph.D is an honorific suffix, which
is an abbrevation of Doctor of Philosophy'. So, it seems to me, a
more elegant solution would be to require microformats parsers to be
conforming parsers, in terms of the HTML spec.

Adding additional classes to account for non-conforming parsers just
feels icky to me.
