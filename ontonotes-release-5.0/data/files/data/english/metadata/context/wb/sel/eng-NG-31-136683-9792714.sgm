I went out to a party last night.  I was told it was women only.  Not
only was it not women only, but it was a halloween party.  My friends
and I were not in costumes.
However, I was feeling socially awkward to say the least, not wanting
to dance, and not drinking alcohol as I gave it up 10 months ago.
this is the second time I went to a dance since not drinking.  the
first one was disastrous in a big way.
Anywho, this guy comes over chatting with my friend and me.  He is
talking and the music is loud so I'm pretending to catch every word he
says, because I don't want to go &quot;What?  What?  What?&quot;
He says something like, &quot;Usually it's the pretty girls like you who
are beating them up.&quot;  I realise he actually said, &quot;Usually it's the
pretty girls like you who are beating them off,&quot; meaning prospective
dates.  Well, I never meet anyone when I go out and I wasn't expecting
to meet anyone last night.  My friends were pressuring me to dance,
and to mingle, and at least go home with a phone number.
God.
So my mind interprets this guy's statement as, &quot;There is something
wrong with you that you can't get a date.&quot;  I feel like a knife is
stabbing me in the heart.  I go to the bathroom and cry.  And then I
decide to leave.
I wait in the rain for a cab for about a half hour.  I feel like shit.
I go home, and decide that I'm NEVER going out again.  I just can't
handle social situations.   It's the crowds, it's the pressure.  I
can't even fake it, I just collapse  inside.

Now, I know that this has everything to do with the wrong core beliefs
that I talked about in the other thread.  My core belief is that I am
defective and no one can love me.  This is a feeling that I've had all
my life.  And boy is it hard to shake.  It cripples me.  It cripples
my social life and kills me inside.  It is a self-fulfilling
prophesy.  I feel disgusting, I put out &quot;go away I'm horrible&quot; vibes,
I get no one, and my belief is confirmed.

I don't think there is an answer to this problem; I just wanted to
share it with you all.

Hi Michelle,
I think that I can relate. Parties make me feel uptight and awkward. I
never feel like I belong in those situations. I am self-conscious when
I dance. I do drink, but I don't really like drinking if that makes
any sense. On the other hand, I do like conversations in small groups.
But, parties and music don't really lend themselves to conversations.

Over the years, I have trained myself to get along at parties and
dancing, but I still don't like it and I still leave as quickly as
seems socially acceptable. There's a part of me that wishes that I
could enjoy myself in those situations.

A piece of advice that I picked up a long time ago was that it's not
so important how we feel as it is how we make others feel. I used to
beat myself up thinking, oh, I should have said 'x' or I should have
done 'y.' So... I have this idea, what if in each case I think about
how could I make this other person feel comfortable and tell me
something about themselves? It's like I have this social conversation
disability or something... but, what I try to do is treat each
encounter with a person as a new chance to try to make someone else's
day a little bit brighter - that's my theory anyway. Now, I look for
those opportunities and it's getting easier for me. The measure of
success is to learn something new about someone.

Parties would still not be my preferred venue, but we did go to a
party last weekend and I didn't have a bad time.

As for meeting someone, the person that you want to be with is not
going to be somewhere that you don't want to be - JMHO.

I hope that tomorrow isn't so bad,
-Den Fox

Den,
I'm glad you said that because I think you're right.  In these
situations I get totally wrapped up in myself and I'm not thinking of
others.
I won't give up on parties - I'll try your advice.  thanks.
Michelle
