-=[ Flicking The Switch ]=-

Judith was 35 years old.

While her best friend had put together a small party of their mutual
society friends, Judith just was not in the mood to celebrate.

The mood had been building for several weeks now, culminating with this
impromptu party. Here she was, dressed in her best Bitch blacks,
looking indescribably edible with her red hair loose, and her normal
glasses exchange for contacts, making her eyes glow.....and she felt
like a mouse, willing to crawl someplace and just hide.

She idly played with the stem of the goblet, the white wine unusually
dry tasting, and raised her hazel eyes, glancing around the room full
of Dommes and subbies..celebrating her birthday. As she set the goblet
aside and rose to leave, her friend pushed her gently back down by her
shoulder.

"Judith..not yet, hon," Sharon gazed at her smiling with bright eyes,
the deep purple suede outfit suiting her dark hair. "I have a surprise
for you."

"Sharon..," Judith started with a sigh, and then was startled when one
of their other friends came forward with a small box tied with a bow.

"Hey Judith...ya old bitch you" Melissa said laughing, and then stopped,
seeing the hurt in Judith's eyes. "Anyways, Happy Birthday, hon!"

Judith just held to the box, fighting down the urge to rake her nails
against Melissa's snooty face. She mustered her civility and coolly
replied, "Thank you dear."

Sharon watched this exchange, more than mildly interested. She had been
watching, listening, and talking to Judith for twenty years now,
knowing her in high school, throughout their college years, and then
professionally. She knew it was time to really talk to her.

"Judith, ....come upstairs with me. I want to show you what I found at
an antique market last weekend," Sharon said, taking her arm and
tugging slightly.

Judith followed and as they entered Sharon's bedroom, she flung the
prettily wrapped package across the room.

"Damn it Sharon, I'm tired of it," Judith was really ready to get into
it with her friend. One of their favorite pastimes was called 'Bitch
session' and it was just screaming at each other about anything.

"Sit down, Judith," Sharon's tone was quiet, but was full of authority.
Judith sat on her friend's beautiful designed Laura Ashley bed, looking
at Sharon oddly, viewing her in a new light.

Sharon stood there, her arms crossed, eyes steadily staring at Judith
and calmly continued. "We have known each other the longest of the
group out there. You want to talk to me and tell me what the hell is
going on? I don't know how to talk to you anymore. I want YOU to tell
me and I want to hear it NOW."

Judith flinched as she heard the emphasis in her friend's words, but
then she breathed in deeply."I'm thinking of leaving the scene,
Sharon." She put it quickly and bluntly. "I've trained and searched,
I've whipped and cuddled. I have gone from wide eye excitement ten
years ago, going from party to party to being a full-fledged career
woman. I have no time anymore to deal with pandering to subs, the
responsibility has become overwhelming. I'm just thankful I don't have
a collared currently. It would just make this all the harder to do."

"I think you're lying to yourself," Sharon retorted, and picked up the
package. She looked at it carefully and handed it back to Judith. "Open
it."

"Oh for Christ's sake! I don't want another fucking vibrator to point
out that I'm alone. I have my job, I have the Chamber meetings, I'm
just ...just...," Judith looked up, "existing."

"Judith...shut the fuck up and open the present. I have one for you too,
but I want you to open that first. Melissa told me what she had found
for you and NO it's not another fucking vibrator," Sharon pushed the
package into her hands.

Judith ripped through the ribbon and paper to open the box, sharply
breathing in at the dark sapphire suede flogger lying within the
tissue.

"Oh my!" Judith pulled it out and fingered it slowly, testing the weight
of the grip, the feel of the flails.

Sharon nodded. "Melissa said she found a leather smith that does custom
jobs. Seems you told her once you like that color. And now that you
have a new toy..." She walked to the door that adjoined to her guest
room, opening it slightly and tugging on something with her hand.
"....Here's my present!"

Judith raised her eyes, watching the man enter on the end of Sharon's
chain. He was physically fit and well defined. Naked save for chains,
collar, and hood, which covered his eyes and hair but left his nose and
mouth visible.

With a quick tug on the chain and a barked "Down" from Sharon, the man
was kneeling before her, and Sharon was making her way to the door.

Sharon looked back and laughed. "Happy birthday, Judith my love..Have
fun."

As the door shut behind her friend, Judith looked down at the man. From
the peppered strands of chest hair, this was a mature man, not a mere
boy. With a nudge of her toe, he immediately opened his thighs wider,
his cock hanging erect before him. Judith slid completely off the bed
and circled this gift, critically eyeing the few marks remaining on his
back from what looked liked a bullwhip.

"What is your safe word, pet?" She held the flogger loosely in her hand,
trailing the tails over his shoulders.

"Mistress...red is my safe word," his voice was like fine cognac,
mellowed with time, just low enough to be husky.

She looked at the flogger once more, and told him to get on all fours,
watching as he did so quickly and quietly.

"Good boy," she praised, but then did something she promised herself
never to do. She vented her anger, all the frustration she had been
feeling, all the confusion and flogged his ass until it was black and
blue with stripe marks. Not once did he complain, not once did he utter
the safe word, but as Judith threw the flogger to the ground in disgust
of herself, he lifted his head and she could see his cheeks shining
from the tears.

His voice cracked slightly as he spoke. "Did I please the Mistress?"

"Yes pet," She walked to the door, leaving the flogger lying on the
floor next to him. "You pleased me."

Judith went downstairs to Sharon. Her eyes spoke volumes but her voice
only came to her once. "I'm sorry." Judith collected her coat and purse
and left quietly, her life changed.

In the next two weeks, Judith immersed herself in work. Judith went to
one meeting after another, reassuring Chamber members that a merger
coming up would not affect the commerce of their small community.

But her stability was shaken. She no longer had the edge that she used
to. She heard soft whispers regarding herself and how she had become
soft. And as she went into the Friday afternoon meeting with the merger
representative of the other company, she breathed a deep sigh of
relief, just thinking of rest for the weekend.

He had flown in specifically for this, and she knew that his schedule
was tight, as the CEO of the corporation was constantly relying on him
to do certain tasks.

She had dressed today in her power suit, thinking that her favorite
sapphire blue would perk her mood back up. She even wore blue suede
pumps.

As she dropped a slew of files to the conference table, her eyes took in
the very smart and very expensive suit that was standing and looking
out the window. Late 40's early 50's easily, with dark hair starting to
turn gray. He turned around and caught her looking and she smiled
awkwardly.

"Hi I'm Judith N~. We've never really talked have we? I mean..well gee,
we've sent a whole gob of emails back and forth and then those damn
faxes..." What the hell was she doing?!?! She was rambling like a
schoolgirl. But she had caught his eyes, and the blue there was
reflecting her outfit, making them seem darker.

His gaze took her all in and as she was about to make a comment, he
shuddered and clung to the chair.

"Are you alright? Do you need some water?" She asked anxiously.

"I'm fine." His answer was quick, but...something.

"Have we met before?" She looked at him deeply.

"I don't believe so...Judith did you say?" He offered his hand out.
"Allen J~. Shall we get this going so we can sneak out and start the
weekend early?"

Judith laughed, a bit too shrill, but then nodded. "Yes. Have a seat. I
want to go over the addendums on the merger agreement. There was one in
particular.." She broke off, watching as he sat in the chair, his face
contorting slightly. His eyes met hers and held steady. "Umm...the one
in particular..was right he..."

"Well you know what Judith? I'm sorry to say that those amendments will
stand. The CEO would never offer you something that was below
expectations. But if you wish to discuss it with him, I'd be more than
happy to give you a lift." He meant the corporate jet and he meant
cross country.

"Damn right I want to discuss it with him," her adrenaline was pumping.
Pissed she had lost her fire, she was willing to tear one more person
to bits to make sure this merger went through with no hitches.

An hour later in the jet, she was just starting to have second thoughts.
He had made her a glass of wine and had made non committal conversation
to the point of being a bore. She had flipped idly through her reports
over and over again, checking note after note meticulously.

They made the descent to the private runway, a car waited to take them
directly to the estate. Each of their arms full of papers, neither one
saying a word on the short drive.

The entered the estate and Allen took her immediately to a sunken den,
furnished sparingly but surprisingly with some rather unique antiques
and Amish works that made the sparseness reflect elegance without being
overbearing.

Allen watched her as she moved from piece to piece and then moved behind
her, leaning his head down slightly to whisper into her ear.

"You left me..

With a quick grasp, he had her wrists in restraints and had turned her
around, pressing his chest against her.

"You left me.."

He bent down, biting against her lips, leaving teeth marks against their
swelling state.

It hit her and she became frighten..oh my NO SHIT NO....She looked back
into his eyes.

He grasped her hair, pulling it back slightly, exposing her throat, and
forcing a low guttural moan from her lips. As his tongue rasped against
her throat, he mumbled once more.

"You left me.."

The cuffs that he had around her wrists tightened and he pulled her body
back into an arch, attaching her wrists to her ankles with a length of
rope.

"How DARE you! Let me go this INSTANT!" her Domme instincts came back
with the fury.

"No," he quietly replied, continuing to secure the ropes around her.

She continued to spew insults, illicit warnings, and all out threaten
him with his behavior and yet he continued very quietly, setting their
business papers aside, and then leaving the room and lowering the
lights.

Her mind was reeling, going over and over what was happening. Fear.. so
much fear that she smelt it on herself. Anger so bad that although she
was restrained she was shaking. And..damn...she was getting wet.

An hour passed. She had calmed herself down, but her limbs were aching
from being tied. She was hungry and cold, but still didn't know what
was going to happen.

She had already figured out who he was, but for a sub to be treating a
Domme like this, she couldn't understand. Her heart was pounding so
loud, remembering how she HAD just left him there, no release, no
explanation, just left him.

The soft sounds of voices reached her and the lights came back up in the
den. Judith lifted her head, her eyes flashing in anger, and then bit
back a gasp as several distinguished looking gentlemen entered the den,
Allen with them. All had drinks in their hands and they were discussing
something in low tones. As they came closer, the discussion ended and
all their eyes were on her.

"But it looks as though you haven't unwrapped your present statue,
Allen," one man with silver grey hair came forward and gripped Judith's
chin, raising it.

Judith hissed and tried to bite the hand, and was mortified when it
slapped her face.

Allen laughed. "She isn't ready yet, but I did want you all to see this
lovely piece I've acquired as I unveil it." He stepped up to Judith and
was oblivious to her glares of hatred. He pulled out a penknife and
gently cut away her prized suit, leaving her naked and bound.

Judith gasped and then blushed deeply, feeling the group of eyes on her,
her head bowed involuntarily, hiding her confused eyes.

"Oh yes, lovely indeed, Allen" another man came forward, slowly touching
her back, tugging her red hair, and then coming around in front of her.
"The hair color is natural I see."

"One of the things that drew me to her, Jeff" Allen replied, sitting
down and staring at her, slowly raising the drink and sipping it.

"So what are your plans with this little one?" The last man came
forward. His suit was Armani, Judith knew just from looking at him that
he was a mover and shaker.

"Well Peter...she's a bitch. Through and through. I've been observing
her for months. Got finagled into a deal with her company, got close to
her friends. I think it was worth the investment though."Allen gazed at
Judith and she felt shivers down her spine, listening to his words. For
months he said. He has been watching her for months. Way before her
birthday.

She moved slightly, and cried out as the ropes cut into her. The men
nodded appreciatively, congratulating Allen on his find, reminding him
that he had one month.

Judith's head whipped up. A month? A month for what? She watched as
Allen led the others out, listening as the conversation moved away from
her, the lights going down once more.

She lowered her head, and finally let it sink in that she was in deep
trouble. She had often thought about the other side of her lifestyle,
but never to the point of experiencing what she was experiencing now.
She felt as if she was being ripped open, exposed. With a soft sigh,
she felt tears sting at her eyes, and then each one tumbling down her
cheek...something she hadn't felt since childhood.

The lights came back on and Allen reentered the room, wearing a smoking
jacket and holding a snifter of brandy. He lit the fire and pulled a
chair in front of Judith, sitting down with a soft groan.

"Do you know why you're here yet?" He asked, gazing intensely at her.

"You've kidnapped me, you fucking pervert," she hissed out. She cried
out once again as her face was slapped.

"No. You came willingly. That is not kidnapping. Shall I tell you why
you're here?" His voice was still soft, but the steel beneath it was
unmistakable.

Judith lowered her head in assent, the tears streaming down her cheeks.

"I wanted you. Do you understand that? You are precious to me. I saw
what I wanted and went after it." His decisive tone again sent shivers
down her spine.

Judith finally croaked out, "Why..why me? You obviously don't want a
Domme."

Allen reached out, lifting her chin and gazing to her eyes. "But you are
not a Domme anymore are you?"

Judith retorted, "And you sure as hell aren't a sub!" earning another
slap across her cheek.

"I am a switch, little one..something you will learn about, because as
I've watched you, I've learned that that is what your heart needs to be
fulfilled. You NEED to be dominated," his voice stroked against her,
just as his thumb was caressing her lips, her chin. "If I had not done
this, you would have gone on in confusion and never have been
complete."

He settled back into the chair and looked at her. "Judith, your life has
been in the fast track for too long."

Judith looked up, her eyes shining. "May I ask a question?"

Allen smiled. "You are learning, good girl. Yes you may."

"What about my fucking business, my life, my career???" Her voice became
strong as she voiced her concerns.

Allen laughed deeply. "Your life is mine. Your business? A wee bit
egotistical, eh? As for your career, well that's been handled. You are
now registered as an Account Executive within my firm, which..if you
remember was being merged with the pathetic little business you worked
for." He paused, looking at her. "Your office has been told that you
accepted the position immediately, and that you are on a very intense
training program..which is not altogether untrue. For you will be
training, Judith."

Judith lowered her eyes once more. "How can you do this? What if I don't
want this? What if you're wrong in your assessment of me?"

Allen reached out suddenly and grasped her taut nipple twisting it
violently, making her gasp and then moan, her eyes closing.

"I will ask you in a week if you wish to continue. If not, you will go
back to your worthless life, your meaningless job, your unfulfilled
sex, and have nothing to say about this week but that you have changed
your mind over the benefits offered. If you do decide to continue..."
He trailed off, finally releasing the nipple, letting the blood flow
back and she reacted gasping and then panting softly. "Now...are you
ready to be released from the restraints?"

"Yes," Judith kept her head lowered, but then whispered softly,
"please."

Allen nodded and rose, coming around behind her and slowly untying the
knots binding her hands to her ankles. He undid the cuffs binding
chafing against her wrists and then looked critically at them. He
reached into his smoking jacket and pulled a tube of lotion out,
pouring the lotion softly into his hand and sitting on the ground next
to her, gently applying the lotion to her wrists.

A man came to the door, looking austere in a simple suit and his voice
had the clipped accent of being from the United Kingdom. "Sir...would
you care for your dinner here or within the dining room?"

Allen looked up from rubbing Judith's wrist, noting the flush crossing
her skin. "Here is fine, Basil."

"Very good, Sir," Basil replied, unreacting to the scene before him.

"And Basil, the dish." Allen looked back at Judith.

"Yes Sir," Basil withdrew only to return a few moments later with a
rolling cart.

"Judith, this is Basil. You are to speak to him only if your personal
needs require it, do you understand?" Allen said quietly, watching as
Basil removed covers from platters and setting steaming dishes on the
low table by the fire place.

Judith swallowed nervously. "Yes."

Allen reached out and grabbed her nipple once more, twisting it.

"OWWWWWWWWWWW!" Judith cried out, confused, and then reacted from gut
instinct. "SIR, yes Sir, yes I understand!"

Allen released her once more, caressing her cheek. "Good girl."

"Will there be anything else, Sir?" Basil spoke dryly.

"No Basil. You may retire for the night. Thank you for staying up late."
Allen was already looking at the food, eyeing it.

"Yes Sir. Good evening Sir" Basil bowed slightly and left.

"First lesson, Judith. You will now refer to me as Sir. You will keep a
note of respect in your voice when doing so. Any sarcasm will imply
discipline, do you understand?"

"Yes Sir," Judith replied meekly, her nipple tight but sore.

"Second lesson. Prepare my plate for dinner." Allen rose and returned to
his chair, gazing at her.

Judith slowly clambered to her feet, looking down at the one piece of
clothing remaining, her pumps. She sighed deeply and stepped out of
them, yanking the shredded hose that remained clinging to her thighs
away. She turned to the dishes and found a warmed plate, setting
moderate portions of meat and vegetables to the plate and then walking
to Allen, holding the plate down to him.

Allen looked up. "On your knees."

Judith balanced the plate carefully and lowered down, her thighs falling
apart into a position she had loved in her own subs, and held the plate
up to him.

Allen took the plate and looked at her. "On all fours."

Judith bent over, pondering what the hell he was thinking and then
gasped out loud when she felt the warmth of the plate on her back.

"Stay still. You are a table, do you understand?" Allen picked up the
silver utensils and slowly started to eat his dinner, feeling rather
pleased with Judith, knowing it would not take a month as his friends
had foreseen.

Judith stayed as still as she could, her own mouth watering at the smell
of the food, remembering her meager lunch so many hours ago.

Allen finished the fine meal Basil had provided, and sat back, leaving
the plate on Judith's back. "Do not move little one." He rose and found
the dish he had asked Basil to bring with the dinner. Nodding in
pleasure, he filled the bowl with bare scraps of meat, a bone with some
meat still remaining on it, several stalks of broccoli. He turned to
Judith and lifted the plate from her back. As he squatted down beside
her, he showed her the Oneida silver dog dish he had found. "Read it."

Judith gazed at the etched words, and felt her soul wrench. "Bitch,
Sir."

"A bitch is a female dog. For the time being, you are MY bitch, until an
appropriate name can be decided upon." Allen set the bowl down before
her face. "Eat your dinner."

Judith reached her hand out to the bowl and then whimpered as a slap was
delivered to her ass.

"Did I say to use your hands, bitch?" Allen said strongly.

"No Sir," Judith said shakily and lowered her face to the bowl, eating
the meal with relish. She had known of some Dommes that had fed their
subs this way, and one she knew had even fed her sub dog food. She was
heartened that this was just regular food served and eaten differently.
She did find it difficult to gnaw on the bone though, and ended up
drooling all over it.

"There's my good bitch," Allen said approvingly. He had returned his
plate to the cart. Placing the covers back on the food.

"Finished? Good girl," Allen snatched the bowl from her face placing it
on the cart. "Time to get ready for bed. To your feet."

Judith stood up slowly, pausing to rub her knees. It had been a long
time since she had ever been on her knees for so long. She gazed at
him, and then lowered her eyes, waiting.

"Lift your eyes, bitch. You are going to take a quick tour of the house
before we go to bed." Allen took her hand in his and with a soft pull,
lead her from the den.

What she had not noticed earlier, she drank in now. The front room was
gracefully decorated. Not too plain, but severely high chic. A room
that belonged in a magazine rather than in an actual home.His quiet
running commentary about certain aspects of each room were dutifully
nodded at. Each room had its purpose and whether a house big or small
they were generally the same.

As they entered a hallway, Allen spoke up. "This is MY wing. You will be
placed here at MY request. If you should dissatisfy me, know that you
will be removed to the other wing." He opened one door to a beautiful
decorated blue room. "This is YOUR room when you earn it. Note I said
WHEN you earn it. This is not where you will be sleeping right now." He
continued on and opened the door to the bathroom. No. This was no
bathroom: this was more of a miniature health spa, with a sunken tub,
several exercise machines, a massage table, and a steam room. He led
her through the room to two large double doors and opened them to his
bedroom. In dark hunter green and burgundy with the warmth of mahogany
wood, it was a very male room. He led her to the side of his bed and
pointed down. There on the floor was a large dark blue dog bed
embroidered with 'bitch'. "There is your bed for now. I want you near
me. For now though, let us bathe and wash away some of your fear."

He led her back to the bathroom, running the taps on the tub and adding
a good amount of bubbles to it. "You will be expected to do this. I do
it tonight because your mind is reeling and I don't want you scalding
me because of ignorance." Allen shed his clothes flinging them to a
hamper, and then inspected the welts that were subsiding on his ass. He
looked at Judith and pointed down. "You did this to me."

Judith turned her head away from the angry welts that still seemed so
vivid.

Allen climbed gingerly into the bath, hissing as the water hit him and
then looked at her. "Come bitch."

Judith stepped tentatively into the water, and then lowered down into
it. As she lifted her eyes, a washcloth was being held out to her.

"Wash me, and then we'll see about getting you clean," Allen said
quietly.

With experienced hands, Judith gently cleaned him, skirting the welts
but then returning to them with an even gentler touch. She moved around
in front of him, keeping her eyes lowered, and gently cleaned his
chest.

"Mmmm. Good girl. Now lets see about you." Allen grabbed the washcloth,
dousing it liberally with the liquid soap and turning to her breasts,
casually trailing the silkiness across her nipples. He lifted each arm,
cleaning her with a touch inspiring a trail of heat, and then grasped
the hair at her sex, tugging on it. "This will have to go."

Judith squirmed against him, feeling very aroused in the water, and then
gasped at his words. "No please..."

"Up you go bitch," Allen lifted her from the water, setting her on the
edge of the tub. He collected the razor and cream from the shelf next
to the tub and turned to her. "It needs to be done." With a finger
sliding into her lips and parting them, he liberally coated her sex
with the shaving cream, smiling as she winced from the coolness. With
extreme patience, he carefully set the razor against her pubic hair,
carefully shaving away a defense. "Don't move little one."

He continued to shave her with intricate care, his thumb and finger
playing against her clit, tugging her lips from one side to the other.
Judith closed her eyes and hissed slightly, recognizing the boil of
passion simmering beneath the surface of her skin. And then warm water
was splashing against her clit, rinsing the hair away, leaving her sex
bald for the first time in over 20 years.

"Time for bed, bitch," Allen stood and reached his hand out to her.
Judith was so aroused that she didn't think she could stand securely,
but with an insistent tug, she was to her feet. Warm voluminous towel
enfolded around her, drying her softly as he draped it against her.
Allen briskly toweled himself off and crooked a finger at her. "Come."

He led her once more to the bedroom, the towels still wrapped around
them. "Tomorrow, you will have a list of duties. Consider it training.
You are to complete the tasks well. You are not known for slipshod work
in your business, therefore it will not be acceptable here. Do you
understand?"

"Yes," Judith whispered, and then cried out as the hand slapped her face
once more. Trembling she croaked out "Yes Sir."

"Good. Many of the things I have done tonight you will do from now on.
They are to be yours to accomplish." Allen snapped his fingers.
"Towel."

Judith relinquished the towel to him, standing there shivering from
chill, nervousness, general shock finally giving way to strong arousal.
She knew her nipples were tight and her skin flushed and embarrassed
her head ducked down again.

Allen hissed out a breath, saying more to himself, "Yes a very fine
investment." He jerked her chin up. "Do you need the restraints
tonight, bitch?"

Judith remembered the soreness from earlier quickly shook her head, "No
Sir."

"Good girl. To your bed then."He indicated the dog bed on the floor and
she looked at him in disbelief, but then catching his eyes and seeing
the determination there, lowered down, curling into the softness of the
cushion.

Something must have touched him, for he fetched a light cover, placing
it gently over her. He turned climbing to his own bed and doused the
lights.

The dawn broke.

Judith woke slowly, feeling awkward in her place, eyes blinking, and
then shutting again.

She rubbed her cheek against the rough fabric of the pillow she was
laying on, the memories flooding back.

She was naked but beneath a soft warm cover. She was not at home. She
was in a house far from home, an estate really. She was being offered a
view from another side of life. The other side of life that she had
meted out with extreme prejudice.

Judith looked up at the windows with the hint of sunlight coming
through, and then to the bed that she was laying beside. The comforter
was askew and the form was belly down. Judith moved up to her knees,
stretching her arms over her head and looked down at the confusing man
that had taken her.

She thought about running. But to where? She thought about tying him up,
oh but if he got free. She gazed down at Allen, her eyes flooding once
more as the futility of the situation engulfed her. She raised her
hands to her face and silently wept, feeling a change occuring within
her.

She wiped the last tear from her face, bold determined now to make it
through the week and then tell him to go to Hell. Judith couldn't wait
to see the look on his face when she pronounced it. Oh sure, she would
do his bidding for a week, and had been called much worse than a bitch
before. She could do this.

She looked at Allen once more, and was curious as to why he hadn't
awoken when it was so clearly morning. Judith laughed quietly, and said
to herself "A female dog am I?...and how does a dog wake it's Master?"

Judith climbed softly to the bed, slowly so as to not make the firm
mattress move. She lowered her head to the welts on his buttocks and
with great deliberate strokes, her tongue flickered out, licking him.

"JESUS!" Allen backhanded her off the bed, sitting bolt upright. "You
bitch! It's Saturday. Do you mind if I sleep in?" His hand went
carefully to the welts, touching them gingerly. His eyes shot down at
her, cringing on the floor, her hand to her cheek.

Judith croaked out, "Good morning, Sir," before lowering her eyes. WOW,
she wouldn't do that again.

Allen looked at her sharply, and then his face became a silent mask,
contemplating her.

"And good morning to you, my little bitch," He spoke calmly, but Judith
could hear the tone change. "Go find Basil. Tell him to feed you
breakfast, and to prepare mine. Tell him also to call the stable. If
I'm up this early, I may as well ride."

"Yes Sir," Judith rose to her feet, and turned to walk away. Allen was
off the bed in a flash, gripping her hair, pushing her to the floor.

"On your hands and knees, bitch," He growled at her.

Judith cried out, and then lowered her head, "Yes Sir." She slowly
crawled out the door.

Judith remembered the brief tour from the night before, and thought it
would be best to make her way to the kitchen. The going was slow, and
she thought once or twice to rise to her feet to continue, but knowing
that she had upset him already was niggling at her mind.

Judith entered the kitchen and immediately saw a pair of legs wearing
slacks. She didn't raise her head but whispered, "Basil?"

The legs turned around, facing her. She felt the hot flush covering her
bare body in embarassment, but she had her orders.

"Yes bitch?" Judith almost sunk into the floor, hearing Allen's major
domo calling her that as well.

"Allen has sent me to..." She stopped horrified. Judith bit her lip
deeply and started again. "Sir would like his bitch fed and his
breakfast prepared. He would also like to ride this morning and has
asked you to call the stables."

"Surprising that Sir is up so early on a Saturday," Basil voice was
monotone, nothing could be construed from the modulation, but his words
were merely repeating what Allen had already said. "Okay bitch. No dogs
allowed in my kitchen. Out to the dining room. I'll bring you your
breakfast there."

"Thank you Basil,"Judith whispered softly. She crawled to the dining
room, and finally rose, seating herself in a chair.

Judith was looking around the room admiring the intriquing taste of
simplistic art when Allen entered. He was dressed in English riding
gear: leggings, jacket and boots.

Allen stood in the doorway and their eyes locked. He strode forward
angrily and yanked her out of the chair.

"What are you?" He asked.

"A dog? Sir?" Judith trembled as she replied, not knowing what she had
done now.

"You are a bitch. And do bitches sit at tables?" He sat down where she
had been sitting, looking down at her.

Oh shit, she had done it again. She lowered her head and whispered, "No
Sir." She rose up slightly and stayed on her hands and knees, waiting.

Basil entered the room and leaned down, sliding the dog dish before her
face. "Good morning Sir! Beautiful morning for a ride."

"It is indeed, Basil. Papers?" Allen sat back as Basil slipped a plate
before him. Basil had prepared a lovely omelette for himself. For
Judith, there was oatmeal.

"Yes Sir, but the London Times. It was delayed in shipment." Basil
poured coffee and orange juice and then stood still, waiting.

"Very good Basil. Have you rang the stables?" Allen bent to the task of
cutting the omelette, smiling at the luscious cheese dripping from it.

"Yes Sir. Sherazad will be brought up in thirty minutes."

"Excellent! That will be all, Basil," Allen picked up the coffee cup,
ignoring the raised eyebrow of his manservant.

"Very well, Sir," Basil left quietly.

Allen looked down at Judith who was staring at the bowl in disgust.

"Is there a problem, bitch?" Allen asked, taking a bite of the omelette.

"Sir, I can't stand oatmeal. I have hated it with a passion since I was
a child. Please Sir," Judith replied.

"Too bad. Either eat that or go hungry." Allen made smacking sounds as
he chewed on the omelette.

Judith bent her head sullenly, eyeing the bowl and then bent down more,
eating it slowly while making slight gagging noises. Allen looked up
once, but then ignored her for preference of the news that lay before
him in the papers, eagerly eating his own breakfast.

When Judith had finished half the bowl, Allen glanced over and then
dipped a finger into his coffee and tracing against her lips, smiling
as her mouth opened, sucking the caffeine from him. He knew from his
investigations that she barely survived without coffee in the morning.

He finished the coffee and the orange juice, pushing his chair back to
stand and noting that she had cleaned the bowl completely."Good girl!
Ready for some exercise?" He stretched, wincing slightly.

Judith nodded. She was in dire need of exercise having been curled up in
the dog bed all night. She needed to stretch, and wondered if he would
allow her to use the equipment within his mini-spa.

"Did you forget something?" He stood there looking down at her.

Judith gasped and whispered, "Yes Sir, the bitch would like to be
exercised."

"Better. Remember it first next time," He reached out his hand and
helped her to her feet before quickly yanking her arms back to restrain
her wrists. "Follow me bitch."

Judith had really no choice. She kept her eyes lowered, watching his
boots walking away and then followed him through the house and out a
back door. They stepped out onto a deck in the brilliant morning
sunshine, the warm breeze lifting her hair from her shoulders. Allen
walked down stairs from the deck and she followed, her body flushing
deeply as she realized there was a new person there at the bottom as
well as a beautiful black stallion.

"Aye Master...see yer got a fine creature there yerself," A thick Scot's
brogue made Judith's eyes creep up to see an elderly man, a face
caressed with wrinkles of time, yet a quick smile lit his face, his
eyes sparkling at her.

Allen swung himself into the saddle, moving his hips positioning himself
and then held his hand out to the Scotsman for a crop. "Who that?
That's just my bitch." Allen turned and leaned down, grabbing Judith's
hair and pulling her close to his left stirrup. "This is where you are
to remain. Do you understand?"

"Yes Sir," Judith said quickly, her mind grasping that she would be
walking along beside him.

Allen reached the crop out, caressing it against her buttocks and
thighs. He bent his head down and whispered, "Keep up," and put the
horse to a gentle walk with a soft chirrup from his lips.

Judith moved her legs, shaking slightly, keeping her gaze fixed to make
sure her bare feet wouldn't step into anything, and moved easily,
keeping next to him.

The stallion snorted and tossed his head as they entered a groomed
meadow. Allen held the reins loosely within his hand, slowly brought
the crop back and then

::::THWAP::::

right on Judith's buttocks, making her stumble slightly and speed up, as
the horse was nudged to a trot.

Allen spoke once more, leading the horse to a small clearing. "Keep up."

Judith felt her heart racing, she jogged along, still feeling confident
that she could keep up. Her ass was stinging from the crop, and with
her hands bound behind her, her balance was off. Her thoughts shut down
to a mere chant, "keep up, keep up..." over and over in her mind.

Allen loosened the reins, digging in his heels to take the stallion to a
canter, eyes glancing down at the woman running beside him. Her body
was now glistening from the workout and the heat of the morning, her
hair flying wildly around her. And she kept pace, increasing to a run,
her shoulders coming forward and back as she tried to keep balance.

It was only when Allen urged the horse to a gallop did she falter, the
off balancing of her arms tripping her feet up and she fell down face
first into the sweet grass.

Allen ignored her, letting the horse have free rein for a full minute
before slowing the horse down, and tugging the reins to return to her.
As he came upon her, she was still lying there, panting heavily, head
down.

Allen leaped from the saddle, clenching the crop tightly. He walked to
her and said, "FIVE..count them!"

::::THWAP::::

"NOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooowwwwwwwwwwww....."Judith wailed.

"That adds one. Count them bitch!"

:::::THWAP::::

"One ONE!!" Judith screamed out.

::::THWAP:::

"TWO!"

:::THWAP:::

"THREE OH GOD!"

:::THWAP:::

"FOURRRRRRR" Judith was wailing now, her tears streaking down her face.

:::THWAP:::

"FI*groan*VE" Judith huddled to the ground, pain flexing through her
buttocks and thighs where his crop had hit true to the mark.

Allen climbed back into the saddle, turned the horse around to the house
and looked down at her. "Get up."

Judith wearily climbed to her feet, her whole front of her body covered
with the sweet meadow grass, her buttocks warmed to red. She lowered
her head sniffling and went to his left stirrup, waiting.

"Good girl."Allen chirruped the horse to a walk and they quietly made
their way back to the house.

Judith was really truly frightened now. This man wanted more than she
could fake. Her thoughts sunk lower as they approached the rear deck
once more, the Scotsman leaning against the railing, smoking a pipe.

"Grand ride, Master?" The stable man looked up as they came nearer.

"It was indeed. I do miss riding during the week,"Allen slipped from the
stallion's back once more, giving the long neck a loving caress.
"Sherazad misses the exercise too, don't you boy?" He gave a scratch
along the horse's nose and then looked at the quiet woman beside him.
"Into the house, bitch."

"Yes Sir," Judith whispered softly and made her way to the deck, her
backside still smarting. As she made her way up the stairs, she heard
Allen and the stable man laughing about something. Judith fought back
the tears that threatened to fall once more, knowing how many times she
had worked a sub over because she had asked them to go beyond their
physical capabilities.

She waited, her head bowed, just inside the door. Allen came in and
looked at her carefully. She still had grass sticking to her and her
face was dirt streaked where she had cried. He gently said, "To the
bath, bitch."

Judith slowly looked up, meeting his gaze for the first time in a
while."Sir..if you wish me to go to the bath as your dog, please
release my wrists so that I may crawl as you specified early."

Allen hrumphed. "Just walk there."

Judith sighed softly, relieved of not having to crawl. "Yes Sir"

Judith made her way through the halls, entering his wing once more.
Allen followed behind her, admiring the color against her thighs.

She entered into his bathroom once more and knelt down, bowing her head.

"GOOD girl!" Allen was pleased. She was turning into an extraordinary
find. Already her true feelings and placement were showing through. He
reached down and undid her ties at her wrists, watching as her
shoulders rolled forward, her hands softly rubbing her wrists. "Strip
me."

Judith stood and turned around, nearly choking as she saw through the
riding breeches how aroused he was. First removing his jacket, her face
blushing bright red, her eyes lowered, she set it aside and removed his
thin shirt, fingers curling softly against his chest hair. He leaned
against the wall and raised his foot so that she could remove his boot.
She did so with a minimum of grunts and pulls. As she took the second
boot off, she whimpered as her bottom raked against the carpet. She
paused for mere seconds, focusing once more to her task and stood up.
Her hands encircled Allen's waist, fingers slipping along the waistline
and then peeling the leggings down. Judith wasn't too surprised to find
no underwear beneath.

As she gathered the clothes, taking them to the hamper, she found
herself extremely aroused, despite the pain. Serving this virile man,
smelling his sweat and passion as she stripped him made her sex twinge
uncontrollably.

Judith walked back and knelt once more, her eyes lowered, waiting.

Allen gazed at her, his heart beating fast, and then a swiftness to his
step, went to her, grasping her by her sex, two fingers driving deep
into her. Her sex betrayed her, tightening around his questing fingers
as a slow soft moan rose to her lips, her eyes darting up. He bent his
head, biting her lips savagely, thrusting his exploring tongue to her
soft mouth. With a deep moan of arousal, he brought her to her feet,
fingers still deep inside her, and guided her to the enclosed shower.
After securing the door behind them, he turned, adjusting the water and
switching it on. Cascades of water shot down at them as his eyes met
hers, fingers finally drawing out and then with a cruel harshness,
thrusting back in, spreading deep inside her as he guided her to the
tiled seat in the shower.

With a hoarse whisper above the sound of the water crashing around,
Allen grunted out, "Who's bitch are you?"

Judith whimpered, her arousal knowing no rest at the deep probings of
his fingers, her cropped bottom wincing in pain from the coolness of
the tiles. Finally gasping, she screamed out in need, "YOURS."

The water pounding at his back, Allen reached up for the massager,
grabbing it from it's holder, and turning the spray to pulsate. He
watched Judith closing her eyes as her body reacted to his fingers, and
then directed the spray right against her clit.

"OH GOD NO OHHHHHHHHHHOHHHHHHHHH" Only once before had Judith
experienced this wild feeling of pleasure as the water continually
pounded her clit. Her hips rose, rocking back and forth, fucking his
fingers inside her, mind melting to puddles of lust and need. Her
inhibitions fell away as her hands urgently grasped upwards, her neatly
manicured nails breaking as they ripped into his back.

He continued thrusting his fingers, feeling her heat, slowing the power
of the massager when she became a shivering pool in front of him, her
sex tight against his fingers. He watched as the pulsate turned into a
simple metronome, tapping against her clit at each thrust of his
fingers. He whispered once more, "Do you want me?"

Her eyes snapped open as huge gasps of air worked out of her lungs,
"Yessssssssssssss."

"Tough shit." He roughly pulled his fingers out and placed the massage
back in place, throwing her a washcloth. "Wash me bitch."

Judith sat there stunned. Her whole body trembled with desire and it had
been denied. She willed herself to her feet, reaching the washcloth out
and tenderly caressing against him washing the sweat from the horse
ride away. She moved closer rubbing her body against him, soft
whimpering moans escaping her mouth.

He looked down at her washing his legs, bent over as the shower spray
pounded against her back. The lively marks of the crop burning bright
against her pale flesh. He sighed with deep contentment, knowing the
first part of the training had been completed in less than a day. She
had felt the arousal that good discipline brought out. And he had
stopped it, holding her in check, the passion brewing just beneath the
surface of her skin. As she came around to the front of him, gently
cleaning his chest, he pulled her against him. "You have duties.
Complete your shower and return to the room."

She whispered with obvious regret, "Yes Sir."

Allen yanked open the shower door and strode away, hearing the door shut
quietly behind him.He grabbed a towel and went once more to the
bedroom, pulling open a night stand drawer to retrieve the list he had
worked on from the reports of the investigations. Allen glanced through
the open double doors, seeing her standing before the stream of water,
quite still, just letting the water hit against her.

"Hurry bitch! You have a busy day." Allen called out, seeing her jump.

"Yes Sir" was called back as the water was shut off and the shower door
open. She stood there looking like a drowned rat, and then asked, "Is
your bitch allowed a towel, Sir?"

"Yes yes yes," Allen said impatiently, drying himself off, as he
reviewed his own things to do today.

Allen pulled on a pair of sweat pants and a t-shirt, pressed against his
tight chest. He was lacing up his shoes as she entered the his bedroom,
kneeling beside the dog bed.

He reached out his hand patting the top of her head. "Good girl."

Allen looked at her and then pull out a black leather collar with D
rings on it. He fitted it around her neck, buckling it shut, and then
snapped a leash to it. He stood up, stretching once more and tugged the
leash."Come bitch."

Judith lowered to her hands and crawled quietly after him.

Allen led her to a library. The smell of fresh cut wood permeated the
room and row upon row of wall to wall shelves stood empty. There were
boxes of books scattered around and a computer terminal. Allen reached
down and unclipped the leash. "Here, each day..you will work on
cataloging and placing the books into the shelves. Do you understand?"

"Yes Sir," Judith replied quietly.

Although the task looked monumental, Judith was confident she could
handle it. During her college years she had taken on a community
center's library with much the same task.

"There will be other tasks as well. But this is your main job." Allen
reached down and softly caressed her hair. "Be a good girl now and I'll
send Basil along with your bowl for lunch."

"Yes Sir," Judith sighed softly at the gentleness in his touch.

Most of the morning Judith indulged herself going through the boxes
pulling out books randomly. She was amazed by the sheer eccentric mix
of volumes. Classics, texts, novels...All jumbled together. By the time
Basil had arrived with lunch, she was sitting at the computer terminal,
her lips set in concentration, typing into a database program, setting
up several different fields. She didn't looked up from the computer,
and waved her hand as she normally did at work. Basil coughed, holding
the tray with the bowl on it within her sight.

Judith finally looked, and then blushed deeply, sliding from the chair
and lowering herself to all fours, bending her head down. Basil slipped
the bowl under her face, patted her head and retreated from the room.

Judith looked at the bowl, and felt tears stinging her eyes. He wasn't
here. Why couldn't she just eat normally? Finally, the smell of the
thick stew grew too appetizing and the absence of utensils made her
head bend once more, lapping the food from the bowl.

Allen silently walked in behind her, smiling to himself. He watched as
her head bent to the bowl again and again, eating her lunch. He
beckoned Basil in and then put his fingers to his lips, motioning to
Judith. Basil walked in and set a bowl of water beside the stew and
then left again. Judith paused in her eating, staring at the bowl of
water, lifted her hand for a mere second and then placed it on the
floor again. Allen's smile deepened as she bent her head, drinking the
water. He nodded to himself and slipped out once more to make some
phone calls.

The dusk of the evening came, and Judith absently flicked on the light
beside the computer. She had finished her lunch hours ago, yet Basil
had never come to fetch the bowls. She had waited perhaps twenty
minutes before rising from her knees, and heading back to the computer
chair.

She was immersed into figuring out what kind of category a certain book
would fall into when Allen return, clicking the snap of the leash.

Judith slipped from the chair, going to her knees and hands, her head
down.

"Good girl!" Allen was so pleased by her reactions. He snapped the leash
to her collar and looked carefully at the database, tapping it to save
mode and shutting down the computer. He pulled the leash tightly and
smiled again as Judith quietly followed. "You have other duties to
perform tonight, bitch."

Judith was weary from the computer work, her mind was spinning from so
many titles and authors she had catalogued. She crawled quietly behind
him, wondering what he had planned.

Allen led her to his room once more. He unsnapped the leash and looked
at her. "Stand up."

Judith rose to her feet, keeping her eyes down.

"I am having guests for dinner. You will be helping Basil serve. Do you
understand?" Allen said quietly.

Judith gasped back a cry of protest and then bit her lip. She whispered,
"Yes Sir."

"You will wear appropriate garments." Allen picked up a maid's outfit
from the bed and held it against her. "Very nice. Put it on."

"Yes Sir," Judith was pleased. She was finally able to wear something.
Somehow, the humiliation of having to serve a dinner to unknown persons
diminished because she would have clothes on. She struggled into the
very short black uniform, eyeing the garter straps hanging down from
it. She still had no underwear, but the upper part of the uniform fit
like a corset, pushing her breasts up so that they appeared to be
barely held in check.

Allen watched her and nodded. He handed her the short white apron and
gazed at her as she wrapped it around her waist, tying it into a bow in
the back. When he handed her the thigh stockings, his hand touched hers
and their eyes met. He raised his hand and stroked her cheek with the
back of his hand. "Good girl." He face grew serious and he turned away,
stripping the tshirt and sweatpants from his body as he walked
impatiently into the bathroom. Before he shut the door, he gruffily
said, "Report to Basil when you get your shoes on." With that, the
adjoining door was slammed and she heard the shower turned on.

Judith pulled the stockings on, attaching them to the garter belt, eyes
fixed to the bathroom door. She slipped on the high heels, standing
unsteadily in them for they were a good two inches higher than she
would have normally worn. She paused before the mirror, noting the blue
circles under her eyes, and made her way carefully to the kitchen.

Basil looked up as she came in. He had a cook's apron tied around his
suit and was stirring a large pot. He pulled the spoon out and walked
forward, eyeing Judith up and down. "You do clean up nice bitch." He
motioned her to turn around, and she did so, jumping as the spoon
struck against the back of her thigh. "Yes needed just the right bit of
color. Now...go into the guest bathroom. You'll find hair implements
and makeup to complete your outfit, as well as a hat. I will NOT
tolerate an incomplete maid."

Judith whispered, "Yes Basil," and made her way to the guest bathroom,
blushing deeply. Was she now to be disciplined by Allen's major domo as
well? She sighed and wound her hair up, pinning it into place and then
placed the hat on top. To the makeup, well...she never did like heavy
makeup, so she put some concealer under her eyes, and a bit of color to
her lips and cheeks and then returned to the kitchen once more, her
eyes lowered.

"Better...Ok...go set the table..four place settings. China and silver
are in the sideboard." He spoke quickly, appraising her with a glance,
and then pointing to the door to the dining room.

Judith went to work. She had long admired the correctness of a formal
dinner party, but had never actually put one together herself. She
flipped out an Irish lace cloth, positioning it on the table before
fetching wedgewood china plates and strewing them about. She recalled
what she had seen Basil fixing in the kitchen and placed soup bowls out
and coffee cups and saucers. With a tremble she lifted the waterford
crystal from it's velvet cases and placed the wine goblets at each
setting. The last item was the heavy utensils, and as she was pondering
placement, Allen walked in straightening the bow tie of a tux.

She paused, and felt slightly weak at the knees, wanting to go down to
kneel, but Allen looked at her sharply. She was held captive in his
eyes, and then her eyes lowered. "Good evening Sir," she whispered.

"And good evening to you, bitch," Allen replied and then went into the
kitchen.

Judith took several deep breaths, calming herself, and then completed
the table. It was lacking something, and she wasn't sure of what it was
until Allen came back with a floral arrangement and twin candles.

"Here. You'll find candlesticks in the top drawer. In the next drawer
down, you will find napkins and rings," He handed the articles over and
strode back out.

Judith did as she was told, pleased with the table and then went back
into the kitchen.

"Finished? Good, the guests will be arriving shortly. Comfortable in
those shoes?" Judith detected a slight sarcastic tone, but kept silent.
"When the door rings, I will answer it. You will wait five minutes and
then circulate with wine, do you understand?" Basil pointed to a tray
filled with flutes of white wine.

"Yes Basil," Judith said.

"Ah....," Basil raised his head, listening. "There it is now. Now
remember what I said, five minutes!"

Basil untied the apron, hanging it to a hook and bustled out to get the
door. Judith studiously looked around the kitchen, noting a tray of
appetizers and the steaming pots upon the stove. With careful steps,
she lifted the tray of glasses, and then moved to the door leading to
the living room.

As she came closer, making smaller steps to steady herself, she heard
the low rumbling of a conversation, and then a full throated laugh that
she recognized. She stopped in her tracks, all color leaving her face.
No it couldn't be. She continued forward, and entered into the living
room, biting lightly on her lips.

Basil stopped her, straightened the bow of her apron and then nudged her
forward, whispering, "Serve the one lady first, the other ignore,
understand?"

Judith whispered back quickly, "Yes Basil." Her eyes raised and her
heart dropped. Sharon was leaning against the fireplace her head thrown
back as she laughed once more.

Her best friend. The woman that knew her better than she knew herself.
And she was here.

Judith moved forward with the tray and held it tightly before Sharon.
"Would Mistress care for a drink?"

"Why yes, dear...I believe I will," Sharon studiously avoided her eyes
as she lifted a flute to her lips, leaving a red gash of lipstick
against the crystal. As Judith stood there, silently pleading with
Sharon to look at her, there was a slight cough from the other side of
the room. Her eyes darted over to Allen, who was beckoning her with a
finger.

"I really must apologize Peter. Seems she has had no serving experience
at all," Allen looked down at the man she had only seen last night. It
was the man who had worn the Armani. Judith moved before him, lowering
the tray to him.

"Would Sir care for some wine?" She tried to sound as pleasant as
possible, but her throat was screaming to be released. And then she saw
her. Next to Peter behind him a bit was a gorgeous woman, sleek and
black haired, skin the color of ivory. She was dressed in silks, but
around her neck was a collar. She was kneeling casually, her bottom
resting against her ankles, her fingers playing with the dress folds.
Judith stared. She had seen subs before, but this was totally
different. This woman looked like a pampered pet. Judith shot her eyes
back at Peter, and then respectfully lowered them, holding the tray
steady.

"Wine is a lovely idea," Peter lifted a glass from the tray but held it
casually.

Judith turned to Allen, her cheeks felt like they were flaming. "Your
wine, Sir."

Allen lifted the last glass from the tray, traced it against her lips,
and smiled. "Good girl. Fetch the appetizers."

Judith moved away with the empty tray, glancing back at Sharon once
more, who had turned to look at some thing on the mantlepiece.

Allen whispered, "Move it, bitch." Judith scurried from the room.

Judith fought back heart wrenching sobs as she made her way back to the
kitchen. Her own best friend. DAMN. Someone she thought she could
trust. Treating her like SHIT. She was about ready to fling the tray
across the room when she saw Basil watching her.

"Little surprised by the guests, I see," Basil said snidely.

Judith breathed deeply and set the empty tray down and picked up the
tray of appetizers. She would show them. She would make it and continue
with her plan to tell Allen to Go to Hell. She would lose her best
friend, she would lose so much, but she would survive this blasted
week.

As she entered the living room once more, she detected a strained
atmosphere. Both Allen and Sharon were watching Peter closely as he
dripped wine from his fingertips to the collared woman's mouth.

Allen spoke up. "Her training... how long ago?" He motioned with his
hand to serve Sharon first and Judith circulated quietly, keeping her
eyes lowered.

"Her training is continuous, but I acquired her two years ago. She had a
month of breaking in, such as we spoke before. Once properly broken,
she has been yet a sparkling gem that gets polished." Peter dipped his
finger into his glass once more, dripping the wine to his girl's mouth.

"From what I've seen she's exquisite, Peter love," Sharon spoke as she
carefully lifted the canapes from the tray.

Judith moved away from Sharon, silently seething, but storing the anger
to be dealt with at a later time. She moved before Peter, holding the
tray out silently, keeping her eyes lowered, but watching the girl
discreetly. She was taken by surprise when Peter took several canapes,
and then held one out to the woman. She moved her head down, quietly
nibbling from his hand.

Judith backed away, forgetting where she was, eyes fixed on the woman.
Her attention turned to Allen and the glance of his deeply sparkling
eyes upon her made her move to him quickly, holding the tray out.

"Hungry, bitch?" Allen asked as he took an appetizer popping it in his
mouth.

"No Sir," Judith said quietly. She backed away once more and went back
to the kitchen. She was somehow intrigued by the woman. She knew of
subs, but this one seemed less but more. She gathered her courage and
whispered softly to Basil as he puttered around, making last minute
detailed preparations. "Basil..the woman there. Is she Peter, Sir's
sub?"

"No bitch. That is his slave. There is a difference you know." Basil
ducked his head down basting a large roast.

Judith had heard of such things, but she had never really seen such a
relationship within her own circle of BDSM friends. Most of her group
was Domme/sub. Occasionally a Dom would come to one of their
sessions/discussions, but then they would turn out to be perverts or
assholes and would loose interests rather quickly when the Dommes would
find out their true nature. Oh sure, she knew that there were more
Doms/subs out there then there were Dommes/subs, but within her group,
it just didn't seem to be the majority.

Basil removed the apron once more and moved to the door. "Stay!"

"Yes Basil," Judith whispered gently, keeping her eyes down.

Judith listened hearing the manservant announcing dinner and looked
quickly around the room, trying to figure out what her next task would
be. Basil returned and motioned to her. "Go collect the empty goblets
from the living room and then come back here." He picked up an opened
bottle of wine and brushed past her into the dining room. Judith lifted
the empty tray and made her way to the living room once more, lifting
the flutes one by one, straining to hear the conversation.

As she walked back into the kitchen, Basil hissed at her. "About time,
bitch." He thrust a soup tureen to her hands. "Go serve. Make sure
Peter's girl is served last."

Judith held the tureen carefully and made her way into the dining room.
By now her feet were killing her and her steps were mincing. She made
her way to the sideboard and removed the lid of the tureen, stirring
the ladle. She turned and collected Sharon's bowl, filling it quietly,
mindful of Allen's eyes upon her. She stood up a bit straighter and
collected Peter's bowl, walking it to the sideboard and filling the
cream soup into the bowl. As she brought it back, bending slightly as
she returned it in front of him, she felt his broad hand caressing down
her thigh. She muffled a gasp, her skin warming, and stood up, becoming
very still.

"Yes, Allen. I do agree." Peter stroked down her thigh once more and
then pinched the skin at her hip. She stumbled slightly in the shoes,
whimpering.

"Enough Peter," Allen said quietly. He snapped his fingers, catching
Judith's attention and she moved, collecting his bowl and filling it
quickly before returning it before him. Her hands were trembling and he
caught one in his own until her eyes met his. He gave a curt nod and
released her hand. She moved to the last bowl, before the quiet woman,
and lifted it bringing it to the sideboard.

"Anya..utensils," Peter said sharply.

"Yes Master," the woman replied and gathered the silver so carefully
placed beside her setting and handed them over, bowing her head.

Judith placed the soup before her, feeling her heart go out to her, and
slipped silently back to the kitchen, pausing at the door as Peter
pointed to the bowl and Anya lowered her head, lapping the soup
lightly.

Judith pushed her way into the kitchen, clinging to the door, panting
slightly.

"What are you doing, bitch?" Basil asked gruffily. He was still at the
stove, fixing various dishes. "Get over here."

Judith let go of the door, and felt her ankle give way beneath her. She
cried out and fell to the floor. The door flew open and Allen stood
there looking down at her.

"Get up bitch," Allen growled softly.

Judith struggled to her feet, holding her hurt ankle up slightly and
looked at him pleading. "Sir please..No more."

"Continue..Basil, main course immediately!" Allen swept out, and Judith
felt tears stinging at her eyes.

Basil walked over carrying a large platter of sliced roast, hissing at
her. "Get going bitch."

Judith bit her lip deeply and pushed back through to the dining room,
limping slightly, holding tightly to the tray.

Allen was arguing something with Sharon, but stopped, looking up at her.
"Bring it here, bitch." Sharon gasped and looked at Judith finally.

Judith walked forward, holding the tray before her and stood next to
Allen's chair as he lifted slices out, placing them around at his
guests' plates. She kept her eyes down balancing on her one foot.

Sharon started again. "It's too much."

"Don't!" Allen dropped the serving fork with a clatter onto the tray.

"All I'm saying is..."Sharon began once more.

Allen raised one finger pointing at Sharon, freezing the words on her
lip. "I said enough." Allen turned back to Judith. "Place the tray on
the sideboard and return to my side."

"Yes Sir," Judith said quietly and moved to the sideboard, placing the
platter down. When she limped back to his side he pointed down. Judith
kneeled down beside him, lowering her eyes.

"Good girl," Allen stroked her hair and returned his attention to the
table.

Peter began a conversation discussing a specific stock, and Judith soon
lost the thread of the conversation. Her ankle was just wrenched, she
could tell, but it still hurt like hell. Funny how she seemed to have
stopped hurting from the crop lashes this morning, was it only this
morning? Judith remembered her heat from the shower, pressing against
him, their wet bodies together, her need....her cheeks flushed deeply
and her eyes looked up. Allen choose that moment to look down at her,
he reached down his hand, softly caressing her cheek and turned his
eyes back to the conversation. Judith shut her eyes, sighing. His
fingers remained on her, tracing along her ear, down her jawline. His
touch was gentle, hypnotic and then his thumb brushed against her lips.
Electricity shot through her, and her lips pursed softly kissing his
thumb in response. The fingers stopped, and her eyes shot open, slowly
cringing inside. Allen held her chin in his palm and was looking down
at her, smiling.

"Good girl. Hungry?" He asked her quietly.

Judith thought of her bowl, and whispered again, "No, thank you Sir."

Allen nodded and returned to the conversation. His fingers once again
began their sensuous assault on her lips. Before she realized it, he
had slipped a bit of roast into his fingers and was teasing it against
her lips. She opened her lips, softly licking her tongue out against
his fingers. He did not release the bit of meat though and her eyes
shot up to his again.

He completed talking to Peter, recommending an alternative stock to look
into, and then looked down at her saying, "Beg."

Judith was hungry, deeply so. Her stomach was rumbling now from the
brief taste she had gotten before he had pulled it away. She swallowed
her pride and whispered softly, "Please, Sir.."

All conversation stopped and four sets of eyes swiveled to her. Allen
gazed at her eyes. "Louder,bitch."

"Please Sir..." Judith spoke her normal tone, her eyes lowering.

"Please, what?" Allen asked, waiting.

"Please Sir, may your bitch be fed?" Judith gulped and trembled on her
knees.

"Good girl." Allen held the bit of roast to her lips again. She closed
her eyes and slowly licked the meat from his fingers. She chewed it
slowly, savoring the juice running down her throat. When she opened her
eyes and looked up to thank him, he had another piece waiting.

Peter laughed out loud. "Jesus Allen! What the hell did you do to her?"
He was looking appraisingly at Judith. Judith felt herself turning
bright red, and just ignored looking up, prefering to lick the meat
from Allen's fingers again.

"Not a thing. Well, not like you are used to Peter." Allen lifted
another piece of meat offering it.

"Then what you said about this woman was wrong," Peter waved his hand.

"No Peter," Sharon spoke up, her eyes twinkling at Judith and then
turning to Peter. "I think that's why Allen asked me here tonight. I
can vouch for his story. This," Sharon pointed to Judith, "was a Domme.
I've known her for a long time. Not once has she been on the other
side."

"I am still not convinced that this wasn't a setup," Peter said, lifting
his wine glass.

Allen reached down with his hand, yanking out Judith's breast from the
tight uniform and twisted her nipple. "Who's bitch are you?"

Judith's mind went wild. The words from the shower. The heat. Her mouth
opened and she cried out, "Yours, Sir!" She moaned softly, wavering a
bit, the pain on her tender nipple causing her sex to twitch.

Just as quickly, Allen released his grip.

Peter laughed again. "Very nice!"

"Indeed." Allen replied and fed Judith another bit of roast.

The rest of the dinner was served by Basil. Judith remained at Allen's
side, being fed bits here and there, and being caressed openly.

As the cognac was served, Allen looked at Sharon. "Ready?"

"I'm convinced. Sorry about earlier." Sharon replied, her eyes going to
Judith once more.

"Let's do it then." Allen pulled out the leash from his inner jacket
pocket and nudged her chin up, snipping it on. He stood up from the
chair, collecting the brandy in one hand and tugging the leash with the
other. "Come bitch."

Peter rose and followed them and Judith felt his eyes on her the whole
way. When she had thought it difficult to crawl earlier, crawling with
the high heels on and the tight maid's outfit was sheer hell.

Allen led the small party into a darkened room, and yet when he flicked
the lights on, it didn't get much brighter. There were several small
lamps, but the wattage in the bulbs was low enough to cast shadows
around the room. Allen tugged Judith over to a chair, and sat down
heavily into it, indicating her to kneel once more to his side.

Sharon moved to another chair, her long legs wrapping under her as she
sat down.

Peter, on the other hand, led Anya before them.

With a soft push against the wall, it rotated revealing a St. Andrew's
cross. Peter bent to Anya's ear and whispered something. Anya
immediately stripped the silk dress from her body and faced the cross
her legs wide and arms up.

Judith watched, her curiousity rising. Anya had a tattoo on her lower
back, a small crest. Her body seemed free of any other marks.

Peter attached the cuffs to her wrists and ankles and then stood
immediately behind her, stroking down her skin, whispering. Judith
caught some of what he was saying, and it seemed like he just kept
repeating over and over again "slut slut slut slut slut slut..." Peter
stepped back and retrieved a wicker cane from the wall, stoking it up
and down Anya's back. And then with a sharp twitch, struck the cane
against her hitting the tattoo dead on.

Anya flinched, but didn't cry out. A bright red welt appeared on her
skin.

Peter continued striking with the cane, but his strikes were not in
anger. Each one was well-placed and by the time he paused, Anya was
squirming against the cross. Soft whimpers were coming from her mouth
and her hips were actually grinding against the wood. It opened
Judith's eyes. What she had felt this morning, after the exercise, in
the shower. The intensity of desire.

Peter walked up to Anya, bending to her ear once more while his hand
slowly manipulated against her sex.

Anya screamed out, "Please MASTER!" and he whispered once more. Anya
exploded against his fingers, dripping her fluids against him. She hung
from the cross panting as Peter turned around, showing his full hand.

Sharon spoke up sardonically. "How long has she been denied release,
Peter?" She lifted the brandy, sipping it, her eyes glowing in the dark
room.

"Three weeks," Peter said briskly and placed his hand at Anya's mouth to
clean it.

"Three weeks? That's close to being neglect," Allen said firmly.

Peter whirled around, looking at Allen. "It was part discipline part
training. Do NOT start to tell me how to train my slave."

Allen lifted Judith's chin. "Do you trust me, bitch?"

Judith whispered quietly, "Yes Sir."

Allen looked up at Peter. "This woman has been denied two days, and is a
sexual creature by nature. Perhaps we will see the difference."

Peter turned back to his slave, pulling her out of the cuffs and laying
her belly down by a chair, before turning and sitting in it himself. He
picked up the brandy snifter and motion to the cross. "Show me your way
then." He tilted the glass, the brandy hitting against the open welts
on Anya's back. Anya moaned and clung to the ground.

Allen stood and tugged the leash. Judith crawled silently to the cross,
trembling at the thought of a caning. Allen reached down and unhooked
the leash saying softly, "Up." Judith stood and faced the cross.
"Strip." Judith stepped gratefully out of the shoes, wishing she could
burn them but bent down, and retrieved them, setting them aside. She
reached under the skirt and unhooked the garters, rolling the stockings
off and then shaking them. Her hands went to the small of her back
untying the apron and then she felt his lips press against the back of
her neck. His hands drew the uniform from her body. "Against the cross,
bitch." Judith was panting softly and she knew her nipples were rock
hard. She leaned up against the cross, trying to emulate Anya's
position. Allen quietly restrained her in. But...he pulled a silk
blindfold and placed it around her eyes. "Sharon.."

"Right here, Allen." Sharon's voice was closer.

"Check her restraints." Allen's voice sounded deeper, huskier.

"Sure!" Judith felt the cuffs being tugged tightly and then felt nails
scraped down her spine, and she shivered. "She's secured."

The room was so quiet, Judith could almost hear everyone's breath above
her own wildly racing heart. With extreme softness, she felt a caress
at her shoulder, and then at her thighs. It wasn't a hand though.
Trailing up and down her back, swishing..she knew..a flog. Carefully,
mesmerizing, gently teasing it aroused her, not knowing where he would
move it next. Despite herself, she uttered a single moan, and then bit
her lips back.

"Let the feelings go, bitch...let it envelop you," His voice was soft,
right near her ear. She melted against the cross, feeling her body arch
and twitch to each teasing kiss of the flog. He stopped and pulled the
flog away. Judith felt like crying in frustration. "Pleaseeeeee Sir,"
she whispered softly. With a quickness she never realized, the flog
struck hard against her lower back, the tails flaying against her skin.
Judith cried out, clinging to the restraints.

"Please what, bitch?" Again, he was caressing her with the flog. She
felt goosebumps up and down her skin. God! She was getting wet!

"Please Sir, don't stop," Judith was panting now. She couldn't get
enough of the caresses. She never realized that it felt so damn good.

Allen stopped again, his hand caressing where the flog had struck her.
"More then, bitch?"

"Yessssss, please Sir..," Judith cried out. Allen struck her buttocks
with the flog. "Thank you Sir." Judith groaned.

Allen looked back at Sharon and smiled, he nodded to Peter. He turned
back to Judith's trembling body and continued to caress her with the
flog. He reached his other hand around and pinched her nipple.

"OH GOD SIR!" Judith bucked against the cross. She needed...she needed
to...THWAP the flogger hit against her inner thighs. Judith screamed
her need. "Please Sir..may your bitch CUM?"

The flog was pulled away and his quiet words came to her. "No."

Judith sobbed deeply. Allen turned to Peter. "See what I mean? I think
the alternating between soft and hard has a better result. That was
what..15 minutes? 20 minutes? And already her passion is flared. But,
yes I see you Sharon, looking at your watch. Perhaps we should adjourn
and continue this discussion another time."

Peter's voice spoke up. "I am impressed with your method. Unfortunately,
it is not for me. But yes, I need to get home."

The voices became softer and Judith realized that they had left the room
and left her hanging on the cross blindfolded. Her cries started anew,
thinking to herself how weak she was.

His lips were gentle once more at the back of her neck, brushing against
the tendrils of her hair. Judith stopped crying, willing his lips to
stay there. His hands reached up uncuffing her wrists and then
uncuffing her ankles. She could barely stand. When he removed the
blindfold, her eyes blinked, tear bright. Judith realized that he had
shed his tuxedo and was standing next to her naked. His hand lifted and
showed her the dark sapphire flogger. Her eyes dropped. "No!" He
whispered urgently. He lifted her chin, feathering her face with
kisses. "Control. Control is the key, bitch. You lost control when you
used this against me. See how I kept control."

Judith lifted her tear stained face, her eyes searching his for anger
and seeing none. He had used the flog to arouse her and nothing more.
He was not 'getting her back'. He was not getting even. He had kept his
feelings from her abuse buried. He lifted her into his arms and carried
her back to his room, placing her gently to his bed. His hands held her
wrists down and he positioned himself above her. His eyes looked down
at her.

The lovemaking was sweet and gentle, and this time when she cried for
release, he let her go..exploding with her as their passions met and
matched evenly. He held her and stroked her skin quietly afterwards.
But towards the dawn he nudged her and whispered, "You have pleased me.
Go to your room."

Judith quietly slipped from his bed, standing there, unsure. She turned
and made her way down the hall to the room she had been shown as hers.
She didn't bother to turn on the light, but nudged the comforter on the
bed aside and fell to the sheets. Her last spate of tears for the night
was not for physical pain. But for being sent away from his warmth.

Another dawn, this time Judith woke up to an interesting sound.

After checking the clock and seeing it was way too early in the morning
for activity, she rose drowsily from the bed, stretching. A small smile
played at her lips, remembering the passion from the night before, but
then it slipped away, remembering he sent her away.

A small silver tray was next to the bed on it lay a sterling silver rose
and a coffee service with several rolls. Judith's eyebrow lifted, but
then she saw the note tucked under the rose and read it while pouring a
cup of coffee.

"Bitch: This is a day of rest. You may enjoy the pool. You may walk in
the meadow. You may read some books. Do not expect to see me until
dinner. Master Allen"

Judith quietly reviewed the last couple of days as she snuggled back
into the covers with the cup of coffee. Her will had been stroked to a
different level of arousal, carefully, artfully by this man. She tried
to think of him once again within a submissive role, but his dominance
over her had left her not willing to see that side of him again. But
then she thought, could she ever see herself within a Dominant role?

The sound that had awoken her happened again and Judith rose from the
bed, setting the coffee cup aside and smoothing the comforter down. She
poked her head out the door, and listened, hearing the sound again.

She made her way down the hallway, pausing at the library she was to
work on, peeking in. But nothing was there, not even the computer was
on.

She continued down the hall looking into the living room and the den,
even risking a glance to the kitchen, but they were all empty.

She jumped as she heard the sound again, finally recognizing it. It was
the sound of a bull whip being cracked. She continued down the hall to
the room she had been in the night before, gazing in and holding her
breath at the sight before her eyes.

Within the dawn, the room still seemed dark, but the spotlights that had
created the atmosphere last night were on and between the glow, Judith
could see what was occuring.

Against the rack, a man was restrained, red welts bright against his
white skin, skillfully criss crossing in an intricate pattern. Another
man dressed in full leathers including a hood was coiling the whip,
preparing to strike again. His words reached Judith, just as she
realized who it was being whipped.

"You are nothing but a fucking slut. You think you are so HIGH and
MIGHTY. You are NOTHING. WHO is your MASTER, slut?"

Allen cried out as the whip struck him again. "The COMPANY is my Master.
I serve the company, willingly completely...OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH
ARRRRGHHHHHH."

As the man started to coil the whip again for another strike, he caught
the eyes of Judith and motioned her in.

Judith tried to back away discreetly, but seeing the man was insistent,
moved forward until she was next to him. The man spoke, but making it
seem as he was speaking to Allen, and Judith knew who was behind the
mask.

"You should see your precious back now, slut. So wonderfully red and
full of welts. Will your bitch be able to sooth THAT pain from you?
Won't she wonder where you got your stripes from slut?" The accent was
unmistakeable. It was Basil. And sure enough, he removed the hood and
gazed at Judith, reaching down and handing her the sapphire flogger.
Judith quickly shook her head, but Basil placed it in her hand and
moved her closer to Allen. He pointed to Allen's buttocks and thighs.

"COUNT slut!" Basil said firmly.

To feel the grip of the flogger within her hand, to see the man that had
caused her so much turbulence bound so helplessly, Judith started to
feel the anger rise. But then she remembered the discussion. Control.
She stared at his buttocks and then flicked the flogger out, caressing
first and then quickly striking the flails against him.

Allen moaned deeply but then rasped out, "One Master."

Judith turned and lifted her eyebrow to Basil, but he indicated to
continue, sitting down in a chair to view.

She continued flogging, smiling softly to herself as his ass matched the
shade of the welts, and then alternated strikes to his thighs, sighing
with each moan, grunt, groan he exhaled while counting.

When he had reached 30, she paused, turning to look at Basil. He nodded
at her pointing to the other toys, and rose...stepping quietly out of
the room.

Judith reviewed the toys laid out, and chose a plug, lubricating it well
before nudging it against Allen's ass. With a quick wrench of her hand,
the plug was in, and Allen was trembling in the restraints.

"Master?" he said softly.

Judith didn't answer...not yet. She picked up a piece of rabbit fur and
started to smooth it, back and forth against the welts. Mesmerizingly
slow..hypnotic traces against his flaming skin. Up and down his back,
down over his ass, slowly caressing. By this time Allen was moaning
deeply, arching his back to meet the fur, his ass clenched tightly
against the plug. Judith reached around his waist and drew her nails
gently down his erect shaft.

Allen cried out sharply, fighting the restraints to turn around. "No
DAMMIT Noooooo, not after all my work!!"

Judith bit sharply into his shoulder, finding a welt with her finger and
sliding her nail against it.

"Quiet, slut," Judith said firmly.

Allen gasped and shuddered against the cross. His head slowly started to
drift downward.

Judith slapped his ass hard, right against the plug. He moaned aloud,
and then replied, "Yes Mistress."

Judith continued to tease him further with the fur, delighting in the
reactions, the gentle swaying of his body to meet the caress. She
reached around again and held his shaft firmly. He was rock hard and a
bit of precum was slowly dewing at the tip. Judith smeared it against
her fingertips and raised it to his mouth. She stepped closer and laid
her nipples against his back, slowly dancing against his skin, lowering
her head to his ear and whispered, "Do you want to cum, slut?"

Allen hissed out the reply. "Yesssssss Misssssstresssss."

Judith released her hand from him. "No."

Allen groaned deeply. He was just at the edge. God dammit, she knew it.

Judith smiled softly and set aside the toys. She reached up, releasing
the restraints, watching as Allen slowly drifted to the floor. She
walked to a chair and sat down, gazing at him.

"Come here slut," Judith spoke softly but the authority had returned to
her voice.

Allen crawled across the floor and kneeled at her feet, slowly lowering
down until his lips were pressed against her foot. His mind was racing.
What would she do to him now?

Judith reached her hand down softly stroking his hair. "Good slut."
Judith was thinking the very same thing, her eyes glowing. She felt
alive. Spark had returned to her emotions. And this man was hers to
play with. She gazed down at the marks upon his back. Basil had marked
him well. And then her mind decided.

"Back to you room slut," She said, letting go of his hair. "And make
sure you crawl..."

"Yes Mistress," he replied. Judith watched as Allen crawled slowly away
and then rose, collecting a few items from the toys and following him.

She caught up with him in the hall, and thwicked the crop against his
thighs and reddened ass. "Faster slut," She said softly.

"Yes Mistress," As it had been with Judith, it was true for Allen as
well. It had been a long time since he had been required to crawl.

Judith followed him in, shutting the door securely and looking down at
him. "Up slut." Allen rose to his feet, but kept his head slightly
inclined, his eyes lowered. He grunted as Judith placed the nipple
clamps on and then moaned deeply as she tightened the tension.

His eyes raised to Judith's and she saw, she saw the arousal there
despite the warring conflict of his body with the pain. What he had
said about 'craving' was true. His mouth and body may be denying to
her, but his soul was crying for more more more...begging to be taken.

As Judith interlaced the chain through the clamps, she tugged softly,
watching his reaction. His eyes closed, grunting groaning with
pain/pleasure. Judith led him carefully to the bed and lay back,
parting her thighs. One hand reached out, grasping his hair and drawing
him to her heated sex . "Serve me slut, serve me well."

Allen rasped his tongue deeply against Judith, whimpering softly with
each tug of the chain. He continued, noting the rythymn of his tongue
was matching the sharp yanks that she was giving to his nipples,
causing his own arousal to grow. Judith started to arch her hips to his
tongue, moaning softly and Allen took a deep breath and increased his
rythym, nearing passing out as the chain was jerked violently.

"GOD! YES SLUT" Judith screamed out her pleasure and reached down
twisting the clamp from his nipple, watching his face contort as the
blood rushed back, his tongue working feverishly to battle the cry of
pain.

Judith gasped deeply and pulled him up, twining her legs around him.
"Fuck me now!! NOW!!" With no hesitation, Allen plunged his cock deeply
into her, just as she yanked the second clamp from him. This time he
DID scream. Fucking her wildly, his cock so hard he needed to burst.
His cry was mingled with her deep moan of pleasure angling up to a
scream of joy. Her arousal, her slut, her need.

"Mistress PLEASE, PLEASE may this slut cum?" Allen hissed out the words,
his body slamming deeply into her, feeling like he was ripping her
apart so hard his thrusts.

"WHO'S SLUT?" Judith was floating from the intense feelings.

"YOURS MISTRESS OH MISTRESS YOURS!" Allen moaned out, shaking trembling,
holding back.

"CUM NOW SLUT!" Judith gasped deeply as her sex tightened around him,
holding him inside her just as his explosion of cum splattered deep
inside her, his moan combining with her cries of pleasure.

Judith whispered almost to herself. "As I am your bitch, Allen..so are
you my slut."

But Allen heard, his heart bursting at her finally understanding. "Yes
Judith, my darling Mistress, my sexy bitch." His arms encirled her,
holding her trembling body as she came again and again, her cum
flooding from her, dripping against his cock.

Holding her softly, the soft sweet aftermath of their break through, he
nuzzled closely.

"Stay.." he whispered.

"Yes.." came her reply.
