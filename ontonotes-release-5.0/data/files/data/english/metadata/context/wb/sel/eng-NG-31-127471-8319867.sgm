The inmates have taken over the insane asylum!

On a more serious note, I read briefly in an old email from the Imbas list that
Lughnasadh was specifically associated with blackberries.  Other than this is
the time of year they are ripe for the picking, are there other specific of note
associations?  Sources and references please.

Thanks,

Stacey

We have many bushes here I throw myself on so they do not get taken
out because they are sacred to Bridghid. Which I never quite got
because Imbolc would not even see a berry ripe.

I started looking beyond just the berry to the plant as a thorn bush
and like the Scottish thistle they are warrior plants. I know I
researched the Lughnasadh approach to them as this is the time of year
they ripen.

Someone else will probably answer you before I find references but I
wanted to let you know I would give it a shot.

I went out for a short stroll yesterday evening to have a look.
There are no blackberries ripe enough to pick &amp; eat at the moment,
down my way that is. End of this month is when they come ripe.
Source and reference is nature herself.
So why blackberries are associated with Aug 1, is beyond my
understanding.

I've never heard of this. In Ireland (and Britain) you won't find many
ripe blackberries until the end of august or often not until
september. The idea of 'first fruits' would be associated with
Lughnasagh but blackberries are a 'late crop'.

So I wonder if this association is a modern thing from other climates,
or possibly another 'potato trap' type faux pas? If this is a genuine
association I'd be interested to know where it comes from.

Stacey reckons the 'Imbas' email list.
Mind you the 'Imbas' list is about as reliable as a long-term weather
forecast ;)

I've heard it's bilberries associated with Lughnasadh, not blackberries.
Blackberries are usually just starting to ripen nearer end of August
than beginning around here, but they started early this year.

One psychiatric consultant in the Kilkenny psyciatric hospital fell
down her stairs, drunk, broke her neck, and died. Another local
psychiatric consultant from the same hospital is now awaiting trial in
custody, locked up in the Central Mental Hospital for the Criminally
Insane, Dundrum, Dublin, charged with drowning her 16-year-old
daughter in the bath in the fanily home.

All are insane, a psychiatrist is she who can diagmose her delusion.

It couldn't be any worse if the inmates took over ! Cheers, Michael.

I actually picked just a couple of blackberries and about half of them
were sweet. I saw a woman taking two bowls of them home for cooking
but she may use a lot of sugar I think!

Strange, Dr. Dwyer, the backberries should be superb around Killasser
with its high earth energy charge.
I really do hope you pick a bad one, though ! As you are a horribly
bad egg yourself.
Now everybody here knows how I offered you Peace - and the nasty way
in which you responded, you and Connor.
Well, now it's Google HQ and the Medical Council too.
Google now has All the info on you, Connor, and your basty little
mates. I shall enjoy meeting them in Dublin.
Not an ISP in the world will tolerate you if you are found to be
interfering with Google, you idiot.
Better take down that fake Druid ... @gmail.com fast.
But it's too late now, as I believe we have located it

Look Forward,

Michael.

Not sure who you are replying to, but...
we're at about half-sweet too, here on west coast Canada.
Blackberries in recent years would only be starting to darken. When the
elder children were in school, we wouldn't be picking them much before
first week of September for jams and tarts.
We had blackberry tart last night, and yeah, it was pretty tart. ;)

It's been an odd year for summer crops though, everything is out of
kilter here.

Blackberries come in season in Virginia close to Equinox. Tis the same
with raspberries in Virginia.

Maybe you need to research where the reference originated. I know that
I tend to use the native fruits in their proper season when it comes
to festivals. For me, that seems more in keeping with nature than
following the fruit seasons of another area.

Good luck on your hunt for information.

Blessings,
El

ps. The inmates need to be ignored and put in the corner until they
can behave with some decorum and decency. It brings to mind the laws
against unjust satire. And I would think a grown man would behave a
such and not behave like a 3 year old child who hasnt gotten his way
and prefers to flail about on the floor screaming.

McGrath cannot can behave with any decorum and decency because he is a
catholic fascist fake druid that intends to destroy all that is
positive and life affirming about the true Druid Path. See the
recently updated Geis on this most awful of gobshites at
http://orderofdruidsinireland.wetpaint.com/

If McGrath said it weas sunny I'd bring my umbrella -
