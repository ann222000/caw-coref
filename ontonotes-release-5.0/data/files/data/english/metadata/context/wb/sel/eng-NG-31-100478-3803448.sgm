Hi all,

Okay, I'm thinking of buying a 156, 5 years old max, looking to spend
4.5-5 GBP.

First a few assumptions (correct me if I'm wrong):

I'm planning to look at only the 1.8 and 2 litre engines - I'm ignoring
the 1.6 since I'm assuming this will be a little underpowered (hence
more likely to have been thrashed), ignoring the 2.5 V6 because of the
extra insurance costs and weight.

I'm only looking at manual transmissions since they're less likely to
have problems than the selespeed and cheaper to fix when they do. If I
was buying new, I would probably consider the selespeed to make driving
in stop-start traffic a bit easier.

Now, a few questions:

1. Do all 156s come with climate control? I've seen some advertised
with A/C - is this the same ?

2. What's the difference between momo leather, and normal leather as
far as 156s are concerned?

3. When did the new nose shape come in ?

4. What are obvious things to check for in a 156? I know about the
cambelt change at 36k. I've heard warnings about people scraping the
bottoms on speed bumps etc - is this a major issue ?

5. Any benefits/downsides to the colour choice? I'll probably end up
with a silver since there's so many of them. Quite fond of the light
blue, but it seems quite rare. Not too keen on the darker colours,
don't think they really do justice to the design.

6. Are sideskirts, spoiler etc usually aftermarket additions? I think I
prefer the spoilerless shape. Do the sideskirts/spoilers add any real
benefit?

I'm sure I'll think up some more questions later :-)

Cheers,

Rody

Depends on how thye drive.  I adjusted to mine pretty fast.   Make sure the

I don't think there were any that came without any sort of aircon, but
there seems to be a 50/50 split between aircon and climate out there.
Climate seems to be pretty much specified on all the 2lt cars, though.

I've not had any issues with ground clearance, but that comes from years
of driving stupidly low cars - the 156 seems to have huge amounts of
clearance compared with some I've had.

I hate bodykits, personally, and I'm not keen on the bigger wheels.

*snort*

We bought a '99V for آ£2800, from Veloces with a 12 month warranty.

Thought it was a good deal, but, these days it's around آ£500 overpriced.

Even a 5 year old 2.4JTD can be bought for around آ£4k now - I know,
because I'm looking at having one very soon.

I don't understand why folk are so quick to dismiss the v6 in favour of less
powerful models.

Sure, insurance is a bit more, servicing can be like awaiting the birth of
your first born, but the weight? I don't intend to push mine around, and the
first time I'm faced with this prospect, the bugger will get sold.

OK, so the car is nose heavy, and yes you do have to be extra careful over
speed humps, and perhaps there is more understeer than 'lighter' models, but
sheesh - have you driven one?

My past four cars have been Golf VR6, Golf VR6, and ... a Golf VR6 and for
the past 5 years a 156 V6. Yea, I am converted.

The VR6 is a fine machine - build quality, reliability (yet my S plate 156
has never let me down), fast, relatively economical (30+mpg) and cheap
servicing (250+), holds its value, but at the end of the day it's a
Volkswagen Golf.

The 156 is... well just drive one. To 60 it's quicker than the VR6
(afterwards though, the VR6 is a dot on the horizon), but it's the way that
it gets there. Like a good woman - virtually silent for most of the time,
but a screamer when you ask her to be.

Go and test drive one.

You really, really wont be disappointed.

FWIW - as far as my experience of the heavier 164/166 goes - the 2.5 seems
to be the worst of both worlds, lacking the economy of the 2.0 and the power

Granted, fuel economy is pretty poor- around 25, 28 if you're lucky, but
when you buy the v6, economy obviously isn't at the top of your list.

As for power, for the 156 to be able to outsprint (just) a VR6, the lack of
it is not one of it's owner's worries.

&gt;&gt; I don't understand why folk are so quick to dismiss the v6 in favour
&gt;&gt; of less powerful models.

&gt; FWIW - as far as my experience of the heavier 164/166 goes - the 2.5 seems
&gt; to be the worst of both worlds, lacking the economy of the 2.0 and the
&gt; power
&gt; of the 3.0

&gt;You really, really wont be disappointed.

Unfortunately the masses were not happy with it. It was a rubbish
seller and Alfa dropped it (in the UK at least).

Agreed. There's not a huge performance step from a TSpark to a 2.5V6 and
I know which one I'd want to punt along a twisty road.

Well there is nearly 30% difference in power and a huge difference in
engine characteristics. The V6 is a smoother and even more free revving
engine than the TS, plus it has more low down torque (though not huge
compared with some engines) and really takes off at high revs. The TS is
much more linear in its power delivery and doesn't have the adrenaline
rush as the power comes in. Both sound purposeful and sporty enough in
their different ways.

I like both engines and these are the engines in mine and my wife's car
so I do know about them!

Overall I think the V6 is a remarkable engine in that it delivers
incredible smoothness whilst sounding like a real engine - not some
anaethetised swooshy over soundproofed thing. I am not sure there is
anything really comparable.

With my 03 Veloce I never have any issues with grounding and it handles
neatly enough, though clearly it loses out significantly in economy.

FWIW my wife finds the V6 too free revving and too darned quick...

Cheers
Tony
