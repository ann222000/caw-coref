'More than 100' Taliban killed

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Article from: Reuters

THE number of Taliban killed in a major operation under way in
southern Afghanistan passed 100 today, the US-led coalition said after
earlier announcing 61 were dead.

The fighting, involving international ground and air forces, started
yesterday in the Musa Qala district of the southern province of
Helmand, the coalition said.

&quot;The initial estimate by the ground force commander assessed that more
than 104 insurgents were killed thus far in the engagement,&quot; the
statement said.

Musa Qala district centre was captured by the extremist Taliban in
early February and has been in rebel control since then, becoming one
of the insurgents' major strongholds.

There have been a handful of major battles in Afghanistan this year in
which international militaries have said the number of rebels killed
had passed 100.

The NATO-led force, which operates alongside the coalition, said in a
separate statement today that more than 65 rebel fighters were killed
late Tuesday in a similar battle in the south-central province of
Uruzgan.

Divide the  number by 2 and subtract 30 to get the true number of insurgents
killed or wounded in this round of Afghani stomping.

Multiple the number by 3 and add 55 is to get the true number of Afghanis
killed or wounded as collateral damage during this escapade.

Gee, I saw pics of the Saudis chopping the head off a Royal Princess

One Canadian commander said that *ALL* Afghans are deemed to be
Taliban until verified otherwise.

So when an Afghan is killed he's DEEMED to be Taliban.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; September 26, 2007 07:32pm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Article from: Reuters

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; THE number of Taliban killed in a major operation under way in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; southern Afghanistan passed 100 today, the US-led coalition said after
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earlier announcing 61 were dead.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The fighting, involving international ground and air forces, started
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yesterday in the Musa Qala district of the southern province of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Helmand, the coalition said.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The initial estimate by the ground force commander assessed that more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than 104 insurgents were killed thus far in the engagement,&quot; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; statement said.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Musa Qala district centre was captured by the extremist Taliban in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; early February and has been in rebel control since then, becoming one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the insurgents' major strongholds.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There have been a handful of major battles in Afghanistan this year in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which international militaries have said the number of rebels killed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had passed 100.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The NATO-led force, which operates alongside the coalition, said in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; separate statement today that more than 65 rebel fighters were killed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; late Tuesday in a similar battle in the south-central province of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Uruzgan.

&gt; &gt; &gt; How reassuring. It's good to know that they weren't innocent
&gt; &gt; &gt; civilians. Those 'correspondents in Kabul' are usually spot on. Thank
&gt; &gt; &gt; God we are free.

&gt; &gt; If anyone watched the fate of Afgan women under the Taliban on ABC's
&gt; &gt; foreign correspondent recently would be happy to see these reports.
&gt; &gt; Their repressive regime should be forever crushed.

&gt; What could be more repressive than a foreign invasion/occupation breaking down
&gt; doors and killing innocent civilians?

&gt; Rightwing truism.  &quot;If it fears right, it must be true.&quot; --rg

&gt; &gt; Multiple the number by 3 and add 55 is to get the true number of Afghanis

&gt; One Canadian commander said that *ALL* Afghans are deemed to be
&gt; Taliban until verified otherwise.

&gt; So when an Afghan is killed he's DEEMED to be Taliban.

So right.  When you are at war and your life is on the line, every,
and I mean every person not wearing your own or a recognisable
'friendly' uniform is deemed an enemy until verified otherwise.

And right again, when a person is deemd to be the enemy he is killed
or, if he so wishes, surrenders and is captured.   Remember though
that the fanatics our soldiers are fighting have no concept of capture
or protecting the innocent.

Of course if the enemy wore uniforms, didn't hide behind women and
children or use them as human shields, there would probably be very
little loss of innocent life.

Now take the Left of politics in this country - they wear the same
clothes as their enemy but hide within them.  But because of their
rabid, politically motivated objection to the conflict, a conflict
that is under way and must be seen to the end,  instead of supporting
the troops, they white-ant them, and in doing so prolong the killing
and the suffering.  Well done you dipshits.

Maybe, to protect the Afghan people from harm.
Afghan people should copy an old SAS trick.
&quot;Taking it to the enemy&quot;

Couple that with an old IRA saying.
1 killed on  mainland britain is equal to 100 killed in NI. (or some
such saying)
Get it.

I personally would not hold it against the Afghan people if after all
the
Evil systematic killing of the Afghan people by US, british and Nato
forces.
They took it to the enemy.
To those that support and revell in the killing of Afghan people.
Be they first dehumanised by the term Taliban, Insurgent, militant or
such.

We are told by Wikipedia The overwhelming majority of Taliban movement
were Pashtuns from southern Afghanistan
and western Pakistan, along with a small number of volunteers from
Eurasia to China.
A heinz 57 of Muslims,
But Muslims all the same..
I would imagine many an Afghan have joined their ranks in the last few
years.
The majority of Taliban in Afghanistan must be Afghan people.
Afghan people opposed to the invasion and occupation of their country.
labeled &quot;Taliban&quot; to &quot;wash away&quot; the wrongfullness of them being
killed.

In a statement by Herbert S. Okun in a session of the UN General
Assembly on November 4, 1986,
he said amongst other things

&quot;A whole nation is dying. Even now, as we speak, innocent Afghan men,
women, and children
are being indiscriminately slaughtered.&quot;
&quot;Genocide' is a term which means, &quot;the systematic killing of, or a
program of action intended
to destroy, a whole national or ethnic group.'

He was of course refering to the actions of the Russians.
21 years later it still applies.

It seems Osama Bin laden has been granted some kind of &quot;Allowance&quot; to
kill up to
10 million people by some muslim cleric type.

He is sticking up for his faith.
Sticking up for Muslims.
Those who are actively involved in the war against muslims will feel
his wrath again.
Not neccessary those in the field of war as they are vastly out gunned
and outnumbered, but &quot;Closer to home&quot;.

THEN we won't have the armchair pundits, frothing at the mouth
shouting &quot;Kill the Argie's&quot;.

What goes on in other countries is nothing to do with us.
Afghanistan, Iraq, Burma etc.
Leave them the sod alone.

Mess about with a hornets nest and you'll get stung.
Will not people ever learn this.
Genecide is ok as long as it's people you don't like.
Is the mantra, going around in many peoples brains.

Leave the bloody Muslims alone before we get whapped again.
It'll be a thousand 11/09/2001's all at once, and more some.

What is the plan then, to kill off ALL the Muslims in the World.
Picking them off bit by bit.

You don't have to be some trendy, or not so trendy &quot;Lefty&quot; nowerdays
to object to Muslims
Getting slaughtered routinly in many places of the World, on a day to
day basis.
It's hardly anything to do with political leanings at all.
Any susequent &quot;DIPSHITS&quot; who think that, must be lacking a brain.
Maybe they have  &quot;arthur&quot; brain or even a quarter of one.

Left of politics, right of politics.....  is just bullshit.
Political bullshit.
Symptomatic of a limited, captured, contained and curtailed
mentality.
(They will take it to their grave!)

You just have to see the consequences, both short and long term.
And how this is going, that is GOING to, affect our lives AND the
lives of your offspring..
That bit they just don't quite get, and never will.
The Muslims are not on another planet.
They are on this one.
Growing some say by 250,000 a day.
Expect another clobbering off  Al-Qaeda and such.
To really get the message.
And then, these  real dipshits still won't get the message.

Afterall,  when you have an  &quot;Allowance&quot;, you might as well use it up.

Suckhole appeasement doesn't work and has been proven not to work.
Give a little and they will take a lot.

Your comments show both fear and a sad lack of knowledge about the
various conflicts that are underway, their roots and ultimate aims of
the islamic fundamentalists and the goals of the civilised world.

Your comments also show that most of my comments are true to the mark
as you seem to have taken them personally but putting your hands up
not only to show your surrender. but to also admit that you are one of
the 'dipshits' being referred to.

Don't worry, you won't be asked to contribute to our survival.  In
fact I really  can't think of any worthwhile contribution you could
make.

All it takes is for good men to do nothing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'More than 100' Taliban killed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;From correspondents in Kabul
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; September 26, 2007 07:32pm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Article from: Reuters
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; THE number of Taliban killed in a major operation under way in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; southern Afghanistan passed 100 today, the US-led coalition said
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; earlier announcing 61 were dead.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The fighting, involving international ground and air forces,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; started
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yesterday in the Musa Qala district of the southern province of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Helmand, the coalition said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The initial estimate by the ground force commander assessed that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than 104 insurgents were killed thus far in the engagement,&quot; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; statement said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Musa Qala district centre was captured by the extremist Taliban in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; early February and has been in rebel control since then, becoming
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the insurgents' major strongholds.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There have been a handful of major battles in Afghanistan this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; year
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which international militaries have said the number of rebels
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; killed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had passed 100.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The NATO-led force, which operates alongside the coalition, said
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; separate statement today that more than 65 rebel fighters were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; killed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; late Tuesday in a similar battle in the south-central province of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Uruzgan.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How reassuring. It's good to know that they weren't innocent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; civilians. Those 'correspondents in Kabul' are usually spot on.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; God we are free.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If anyone watched the fate of Afgan women under the Taliban on ABC's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; foreign correspondent recently would be happy to see these reports.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Their repressive regime should be forever crushed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gee, I saw pics of the Saudis chopping the head off a Royal Princess
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because she had secretly married beneath her station. No occupation of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Saudi Arabia by Western forces took place.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Saudis recently closed a Canadian education exhibit because it was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; staffed by WOMEN!!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When do we invade?
&gt;&gt;&gt; You need to set priorities. Can't do everything at once ...

&gt;&gt; So the heroin poppies take priority over our women?

&gt; I'm Australian. Canada will fail to look after it's women
&gt; because it is dying from the european disease.
">

There is a disease that just strikes Europeans?
How long have you had it, Reg?

Why would Canadians be more susceptible to it than Australians?

Canadians look after their women better than Aussies, they don't
put any of them in razor wire Gulags, they don't just act on child abuse
amongst the indigenous, they have a colour blind policy, and they have
a national health care system which all women can access, not one
mediated by how fat your wallet is.

After the invasion of Iraq I prefer to identify as a Canadian when
travelling overseas, we used to think we and the Canadians were a lot
alike, before Howard trashed our reputation and plunged us into
national shame.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'More than 100' Taliban killed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;From correspondents in Kabul
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; September 26, 2007 07:32pm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Article from: Reuters
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; THE number of Taliban killed in a major operation under way in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; southern Afghanistan passed 100 today, the US-led coalition said
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; earlier announcing 61 were dead.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The fighting, involving international ground and air forces,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; started
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yesterday in the Musa Qala district of the southern province of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Helmand, the coalition said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The initial estimate by the ground force commander assessed that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than 104 insurgents were killed thus far in the engagement,&quot; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; statement said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Musa Qala district centre was captured by the extremist Taliban in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; early February and has been in rebel control since then, becoming
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the insurgents' major strongholds.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There have been a handful of major battles in Afghanistan this year
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which international militaries have said the number of rebels
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; killed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had passed 100.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The NATO-led force, which operates alongside the coalition, said in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; separate statement today that more than 65 rebel fighters were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; killed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; late Tuesday in a similar battle in the south-central province of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Uruzgan.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How reassuring. It's good to know that they weren't innocent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; civilians. Those 'correspondents in Kabul' are usually spot on.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; God we are free.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If anyone watched the fate of Afgan women under the Taliban on ABC's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; foreign correspondent recently would be happy to see these reports.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Their repressive regime should be forever crushed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gee, I saw pics of the Saudis chopping the head off a Royal Princess
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because she had secretly married beneath her station. No occupation of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Saudi Arabia by Western forces took place.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Saudis recently closed a Canadian education exhibit because it was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; staffed by WOMEN!!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When do we invade?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You need to set priorities. Can't do everything at once ...

&gt;&gt;&gt; So the heroin poppies take priority over our women?

&gt;&gt; I'm Australian. Canada will fail to look after it's women
&gt;&gt; because it is dying from the european disease.

&gt; There is a disease that just strikes Europeans?
&gt; How long have you had it, Reg?

&gt; Why would Canadians be more susceptible to it than Australians?

&gt; Canadians look after their women better than Aussies, they don't
&gt; put any of them in razor wire Gulags, they don't just act on child abuse
&gt; amongst the indigenous, they have a colour blind policy, and they have
&gt; a national health care system which all women can access, not one
&gt; mediated by how fat your wallet is.

...which is so shithouse that tens of thousands of Canadians go and get
their medical help in the USA

European countries.

They are handing their futures over to
loud demanding minorities, Political correctness and
opening the floodgates to incompatable cultures through
immigration, Asylum shoppers and financial refugees.

Socialism is rampant there and half the country is French.

Illegal aylum shoppers being protected from feral PC activists

Labor has an indigenous policy of permitting child abuse as seen
by the actions of all the Labor State governments and spelled out
in this policy release

&quot;This is a statement of in-principle support by the international
community for improving the lives of indigenous people
and their children,&quot; Ms Macklin said. &quot;Australian law would always prevail.&quot;

But Mr Brough said it would give indigenous people veto
rights over legitimate decisions of a democratically elected government.

&quot;It places customary law in a superior position to national law,&quot;
Mr Brough said. &quot;There should only be one law for all
Australians and we should not enshrine in law practices
that are not acceptable in the modern world.&quot;
