NYC Man Cited for 1775 Submarine
Authorities Responded After Antique Replica
Drifted Too Close to Cruise Ship
.
By DAVID SCHOETZ Â Aug. 3, 200
.
A man in a Revolutionary War-era submarine was cited by the U.S. Coast
Guard for drifting into a security zone, and for unsafe sailing in New
York's East River near the Queen Mary 2 luxury liner, the Coast Guard
and New York City Police Department said Friday.
.
The man in the replica vessel was identified as 35-year-old Philip
&quot;Duke&quot; Riley of Brooklyn, N.Y., according to Coast Guard spokesman
Petty Officer Seth Johnson.

Authorities said it was the second time Riley had floated the vessel
in the vicinity of the cruise ship. The submarine, which reportedly
did not have a mechanical propulsion system, was being towed by two
other men in a rowboat.
.
&quot;A makeshift submarine discovered at about 10:30 this morning by an
NYPD Intelligence detective onboard the Queen Mary 2 in New York
Harbor is the creative craft of three adventuresome individuals,&quot; NYPD
Commissioner Raymond Kelly announced in an afternoon press release.
&quot;It does not pose any terrorist threat.&quot;
.
While Kelly said the Queen Mary 2 will be inspected to ensure the
boat's integrity, and Riley and the two other men could further face
NYPD charges, he chalked up the incident as a case of &quot;marine
mischief.&quot;
.
Riley was questioned by police after a guard on the Queen Mary 2
spotted the 8-by-4-foot fiberglass and wood submarine, a replica of a
1775 model called the &quot;Turtle,&quot; within 200 feet of the ship. The U.S.
Coast Guard also responded to the scene.
.
Oxygen tanks were discovered inside the vessel, but no threatening
devices or materials were found onboard.
.
The &quot;Turtle,&quot; invented in Connecticut by David Bushnell, was the first
combat submarine designed to plant explosives on the sides of ships,
according to the Encyclopedia Britannica.
.
A photo gallery posted July 17, 2007, on the photo-sharing Web site
flickr.com titled &quot;Adventures With an Egg&quot; shows a &quot;Turtle&quot; submarine
making a test run in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, near the spot
where Riley was apprehended by authorities today.
.
The photo slideshow also links to the Web site www.dukeriley.info , the
namesake of which is described as &quot;the man behind the madness.&quot; On
that site, Riley describes himself as an &quot;artist&quot; and &quot;patriot,&quot; who
combines &quot;populist myths and reinvented historical obscurities with
contemporary social dilemmas.&quot;
.
The statement concludes, &quot;Throughout my projects, I profile the space
where water meets the land, traditionally marking the periphery of
urban society, what lies beyond rigid moral constructs, a sense of
danger and possibility.&quot;
