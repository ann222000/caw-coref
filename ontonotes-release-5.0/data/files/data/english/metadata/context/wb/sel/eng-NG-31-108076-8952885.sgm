Who would win in fight between Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Tito Ortiz.

I'm not talking about a UFC fight, I'm talking about a street fight.

I'm going to say that in Hacksaws prime he would have beat the shit
out Tito Ortiz.

Hacksaw is like a monster.

Was he the one who used a chansaw, a folding chair, or was he just the
baseball bat dude. Did he wear a mask, a cape, or just facepaint?

Don't worry, when puberty finally kicks in for you it will make more
sense.

Ravishing may have a minor point, that most of the pro-wrestlers are really
gifted athletes, pretty much gymnasts in their own right.
And some are undoubtedly pretty tough.

Locker-room talk had it that Duggan was a member of the 500 club (bench
press 500#), as were a couple of others--Bruno Samartino, for sure.
Many were very good collegiate wrestlers, one or two olympic.
iirc, Ken Shamrock sposedly did or is doing pro wrestling.

With some training, I think a number of pro-wrestlers could do very well in
mma, but the money in pro-wrestling is proly 1. much better, and 2.  a lot
easier--if you have the skill for that gymnastic stuff, a super-build, AND
the knack for hamming it up.
Also, pro-wrestling, at least as televised, seems to to have a minimum
weight/height of 250# and 6'4&quot;.  You'd have to be a tough tough pro-wrestler
to deal with Arlovski, Sylvia and friends.

It is unfortunate that pro-wrestling seeks the lowest common denominator,
entertainment-wise--and seems to get lower each month, becoming basically a
low-brow soap opera.

In the past, some of it was actually very good, and very funny, if you
recall The Undertaker and his manager, Paul Bearer--get it, pall bearer??!!
Hilarious....
Paul Bearer was actually a fairly well-known bit actor in Hollywood, who
kept the two &quot;careers&quot; as separate as he could. Don't know his real name.

Notice that the recent UFC events almost look like WWF et al, with the
entrance pyrotechnics, etc.  For a moment, I thought I had the wrong
channel/time.

Absolutely.
I think only a few could make the transition--and, really, why would they
want to, given the literal poundings you get in mma, and the probable salary
differential.

However, I wouldn't call it &quot;training to keep fit&quot;, either.
Just as many pro-wrestlers would get their asses handed to them in mma,
virtually all mma people would look clumsy and foolish (more foolish?  &lt;g&gt;)
in a pro-wrestling ring, without substantial training, and possibly get
seriously hurt themselves.
These guys, first, train extensively to be able to perform their &quot;stunts&quot;
without breaking their own or their opponents' necks.
Second, altho I haven't read or heard this, I'm virtually positive that the
&quot;opponents&quot; in these matches train *together* extensively, to get the moves
right.  A kind of wrestling ballet, if you will.

It's unfortunate that pro-wrestling insisted that it was &quot;real combat&quot; for
all these years.
Sez something that most of America believed it.
But then America also bought Ab Isolators from a dude so pudgy he had to
wear a bodysuit--Tony Little.
And it is further unfortunate that they now shroud it in all this low-brow
bullshit drama.
Because athletically, it is indeed quite a show.

I really do miss Paul Bearer.  :)

Some here have even extended this type of discussion to its &quot;logical
conclusion&quot;, calling mma bullshit, in comparison to true marine-type
assassin stuff, wanting no rules whatsoever..
Which would result pretty short careers.

I personally think all of it, the way it is currently done, sets a bad
tone/karma for society.
Would be better, albeit admittedly less interesting, to present martial arts
as an example/vehicle/inspiration for self-improvement, ie, getting
individuals to practice judo/jj/etc at their own level.
Far healthier/more productive, imo, than spectators cheering for
blood-letting.
But, far less profitable.

A few things to say...

1. Bob Backland was never as big as these dudes and he won all his WWF
matches with a move that involved the reference to a chicken...

2. WWE guys VS MMA stars would be fun to watch if the WWE guys never had any
training...  Now they're training and crossing over only to find out that
their bodies are prone to injury.

3. PV!  What's up?

4. Crossposting sucks.  Sorry I participated in the suckiness...

5. 30&quot; X 80&quot; is indeed the measurement.  Only one of you will have a clue
what this means...  And I'll see you some day on my way to 35-50 E. Main
Street in Flushing I hope.

&gt; 3. PV!  What's up?

&gt; 4. Crossposting sucks.  Sorry I participated in the suckiness...

&gt; 5. 30&quot; X 80&quot; is indeed the measurement.  Only one of you will have a clue
&gt; what this means...  And I'll see you some day on my way to 35-50 E. Main
&gt; Street in Flushing I hope.

Since yer bustin up yer house, why don't you put in some nice 36&quot; x 84&quot;
doorways?? &lt;g&gt;
Bring me a doggy bag.

Vince McMahon, btw, is himself a huge built sob.  Not an ardent wrestling
fan, but still, over the years, I never saw him without his suit.  But I've
heard he's really developed.  Don't know if he can wrestle.

He used to be some little wimpy nerd looking dude...  Then he caught the
&quot;bug&quot; I guess.

I don't watch and don't even partially enjoy the WWE-style stuff...  But
it's impossible to miss clips here and there and I've noticed him in the
ring from time to time.  He is indeed huge.  Some would even whisper
(shhhhhhh) ...steroids...  (shhhhhhh)
