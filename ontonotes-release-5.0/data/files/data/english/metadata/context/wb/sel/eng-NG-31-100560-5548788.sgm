That doesn't look like her. But I love flip-flops and that's me on the
right.
I used to be more buff and studly but time and gravity has taken it's
toll so it's saggy and baggy.  But now I now if a woman likes me that
it's for my mind and my wits, not just my looks!  LOL

Doc,
You are the biggest attention whore on the planet!

You turn every thread you post in into something about YOU!  Whether
you compare the girl in the picture to someone you know, or you go on
about your sexual prowess, the size of your member, the huge number of
women you bedded, your intelligence, the pedigree of your college (a
small private school in the east,) your skill as a pornographer, and
now your latest thing, comparing yourself to the guys in pictures to
convince everyone you were a good looking guy in your youth.

This is the sign of a classic, massive, inferiority complex.  Get help!

I went to a public school, not private. It was very large, not small.

I talk about my member in the third person, but not it's size. Someone
else seems fixated on THAT one.  I don't compare my member to others.
I do love my member and endow super-human qualities to it for fun. I'm
sorry if you confuse that with reality.

I never talk about the huge number of women I bedded, and there are
plenty of guys I'm sure that have done much more. I haven't done too
many different ones in a long time.  My boy as well as most young men
do much much more.  And I was self-depracating as I'm really starting
to look like that doofus in the pic complete with the saggy body. I am
getting older pretty quick now.
And I'm having some fun trying to put some life and personality into
the group, and you can call that attention whore if you want.  I like
to fuck around.  Maybe I do need a shrink though for bothering given
the likes of the inmates who remain in here.  You can have fun and
joke around on the groups or just be grim about it and anonomously

Doc, you cannot even keep your stories straight!

I know you have said you went to a small private college in the East.
For certain you have said you were known on campus as "the skinny guy
with the big dick" - remember that?

You are always talking about the women you slept with in school, the
number of women you have filmed, the numbers of f/js you get.  Who are
you kidding?

Putting some fun and life into the group is great, but you inject
yourself into every conversation, including this one about jlo's feet,
and that is a pathetic cry for attention.

Ah no. Please find that post. I did go to a large public school and it
was in the east.  I don't recall ever saying that I was known on
campus as "a skinny guy with a big dick".  I don't think I was known
as that.  I'm not really concerned about dick size.  You can't change
what you have and once you get older you are happy with what you got,
the good, the bad and the ugly.

I've been on the groups for over a dozen years and I'm certain I've
drawn on old girlfriends, events, and experiences. I know I likely
talked about some of them but I likely didn't enumerate a number or
anything like that.
From the good to the nasty smelly fishy pussies that made me unable to
perform.
Also the number of women that I have filmed does not correllate with
the number I've gone to bed with.  I don't know if I ever mentioned
the number I have filmed. But I do know that given the long time I
have been filming, I have filmed not as many as others since I recruit
personally and like to keep ones that I like personally for many
years. One girl for 12 years, Tyler is now coming up on 10 years,
Katia and Erin almost 4 years etc. The ones that I like and that I'm
comfortable with I keep as long as I can.

F/Jobs are different and those I've had a good number of in recent
years and none at all prior to 1992. In the late 90's I was
particularly crazed. But your original attacking comment talked about
women I bedded and I responded to that.  You are are reading in things

I thought the dude was funny looking.  I invite others to re-read that
original comment as well as my last post regarding your "analysis".
Others can determine for us both who is more accurate and who is more
"pathetic". I'm comfortable with that and that is better than hurling
insults at each other publically in this group. That does not help the
group and I'm not sure if it helps you or anyone in any way.

I stand by my previous post responding to yours below. I've been here
a long time and won't change my identity, but you can go in and out
and change your "anon" potshots out of the blue. Such is the nature of
newsgroups.  I see that you are using "google" to access and post to
this thread. Likely a long time lurker would access directly but the
google thing might help you be more anonymous as maybe you are known
here some other way.

&gt;that YOU - more than anyone else here - talks about himself!

&gt;No BS, no lie.

&gt;Got it now?

Who do you want me to talk about? you?  LOL

I don't know who you are other than an anonymous flame thrower who
devoted his first and only set of posts to this all day long. (unless
you are a regular who cowardly used the anon nym for the first time, a
more probable likelihood).

Let's go back, way back, to about 24 hours ago when I commented in the
original post.  I was comparing myself to THAT dude in jest, a dude
that looked like shit compared to the lady, not some young model type
chiseled body.  I invite anyone to look at that dude, this pic, and
see what I mean.  And I did it in fun.  So what's the big brag there?
I was making fun of the funny looking dude and my own aging self.

Just go back and look at that dude.  Other much better looking dudes
have appeared here and I'm not comparing myself to them. And even if I
did compare myself to some studly model type, it would be just a damn
joke, that's all.  So don't take it all so seriously, fellah.  (Of
course I'm saying this only if you are genuine, but if you just came
in here to flame me for some other reasons and just used that post
about the dude as a dishonest excuse and anonymously, then this
wouldn't apply).

As to anything else I've said over the last 13 years on the groups,
maybe if you look real hard and thousands of posts you might find some
minor logical inconsistency, or some change in attitude (that happens)
or something like that if you are REAL lucky but you won't find
anything substantially inconsistent about me or my background.  If I
relate things that have happened to me and I sound enthusiastic or I'm
doing it in the spirit of fun or joking or whatever and you find it to
be "bragging", I'm sorry.  I've done what I've done. I draw on my
experiences. Some of my experiences are quite typical, some are not,
by virtue of the way I am and lifestyle choices made long ago.  So
don't fret or lose sleep if you think I may be a "ladies man" as you
complained.  That's not my kind of word but if you think of me that
way and it offends you, I'm sorry, I can't help it.

But if you are just a long time regular who just used google today and
came up with this anonymous "name" just to take a cowardly cheap shot
today because who dislike me for other reasons and don't have the
balls to use your regular nym and confront me directly, then all the
above doesn't apply and you can be assured of your own cowardice.
