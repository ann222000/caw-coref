I have an d aerator that puts 4 inch holes in lawn. I spent 10 hours
aerating the entire lawn, and hand inserted grass seeds into each
hole.
I am wondering if this will be ok. As Ive done it Ill just have to
see. Im sure some of the seeds landed less than 4 inches.
I also covered the entire land in 1/2 inch layer of sphagnum peat
moss.

Any answers to this I very much appreciate.

thx

Grass seed is generally surface scattered and lightly raked to spread it
'round.   Yes, four inches is too deep.  So is one inch.  But, hey, cheer
up, if you plow grass under it seems to regrow up from under 10 inch
thick upside down mud lumps so you might see something grow.

On the other hand, you might want to surface scatter some seed just to
increase your odds.  Cover it lightly* with straw to protect it from
birds.

*not four inches

I would reseed.  4 inches is too deep.  Also the seed needs to be much
closer spaced than the spikes on an aerator.

First the ground should be worked so that it is loose.  Then the seed is
surface sewn at the rate on the package, then raked lightly and then
covered with straw for shade and to hold the moisture in.

The rule-of-thumb for planting any seed is to plant it as deep as the
seed is wide.  For grass seed just scratch it into bare ground and
protect with straw.  Read and follow the directions before planting or
using any product--it will save you time and money.

I have to seed the back lawn 2x a year due to heat and shade.  I usually
aerate the lawn, water or do it right before it rains.  Then I'll throw on
some starter fertilizer and top soil if needed and then spread the seed.
Water again and it usually does just fine.

"Water again"?

When I have over seeded, I have felt like a slave.  Watering five
times a day.  It helps to work from a home office.  So I can
spend my lunch break on watering the @#&amp;*! grass.

And it still doesn't look as nice as I want.  I guess I gotta be
more disciplined.

Michael, this is nuts. There is something wrong with your lawn, and it's
more than just "heat and shade". At what times of year do you overseed it,
and what is the problem you're trying to solve?

Keeping up with the small patch of back lawn I have is a chore.  Most of
the back yard I've dug up into garden space.  The soil is not ideal for a
nice, full shade lawn and to keep it decent I have to carefully seed and
water it.  Then in August about 1/3 of it dies off anyway and I reseed in
late September.  If I could get by with it I would just till up the lawn
area and plant a veggie garden.

I'm not trying to solve anything.  It's a miracle grass grows at all.  The
soil conditions are not good for grass.  I've done everything to it to keep
it nice, to no avail.  I've even had lawn experts out.  I'm about to chop
up a third of it now ;)  I'm gonna add a small deck off of the one patio
that flows off the dining room.  That'll get rid of some of it.
