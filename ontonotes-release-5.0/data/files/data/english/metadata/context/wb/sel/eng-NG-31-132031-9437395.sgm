Ok, you aileron gurus.  I'm not sure if this is how aileron is
supposed to act, but my FJ is not rolling right.  When I do a level
flight and try to roll, it's more of a spiral than a spin.  It's
almost the same as you roll a plane with rudder only. Does this have
anything to do with the thrust angle of the motor mount?

does the &quot;spiral roll&quot; look like my Zero's roll? and the EZ's roll?

My PZ Focke Wulf would do a  perfect tight spin in leveled flight -
the Zero however fails to because my wing ailerons are not set to very
high rates...meaning, that if I set these to more angle the plane
would lose that lazy roll and literally spin in a straight line.

Yeh, it's not a straight line spin.  It's kinda like the EZ where it spirals.  Of course not that severe, but you get the picture.

Yeah, you want to increase the &quot;angle&quot; of the ailerons - increase the
rates, but make sure that your servos can take the load...not sure how
to test this out 100% but i mean increase the rates and then kind push
on the aileron and see if the servo gets stressed out and starts to
make that electric stress sound.  If it can't take the stress, you
might want to shorten the servo guide rod so that the servo can take a
little more torque (I'm talking about the wire/rod that connects the
servo arm to the aileron control arm).  Also, you might think about
beefier servos if the stress is too much.

Hey Marcus,
Thanks for taking the time to determine the problem.  But I met up
with Patrick on the weekend and he has a tool (forgot the name of it)
to measure the throw on the servos.  Apparently one servo throws more
than the other causing it do the cork screw spin.  I think I've
figured out how to fix it, but I don't have the numbers of the
deflection.  I might have to adjust the end point adjustment of the
servos to make them equal, so it will make a straight line spin,
instead of a cork screw one.

The FJ is a blast to fly though.  With only a 31&quot; wingspan this thing
glides forever.  The funny part is I think my EZ is faster than my
FJ.  I can't confirm their speeds, but the EZ looks faster to me.  The
FJ is fast enough for me, but 4s is always tempting, lol.

Get that thing up to speed and give it the spin.

Check to see if it rotates CCW different than CW.  If it does then you
can correct with endpoints.

Also try increasing the throws as far as they will go like Marcus
said.  If you make it spin like a top it may look better.  If you used
the HS65 they are plenty big enough for even 4S.  I never lost
control.

odd.

you know.  I tried to pop in 4 servos on my Berg 7 RX (+35amp CC
ESC)...the 4th servo wouldn't completely respond, was weird...it could
be that my TX didn't have the correct exponential?  anyways, i went
back down to 3 servos, should be okay...

Could be TX settings
Could be BEC current limit
Could be bad servo
Could be a lot of things.

Expo could do it, end point could do it, dual rate could do it, using
a channel that is binary could do it (like flaps or gear).

I am still here!

Yes, Patrick is correct.

1. Try a different servo in the same port, if it works correctly-servo is
bad
2. Try resetting the transmitter or changing that Channel's settings (epa,
exponentials, etc.)
3. Check if ESC at the voltage you are using can handle 4 servos (some max
at 3 and need a separate bec)

Should be simple deduction...I am sure you will solve it.

Alright,
Here's my latest.  I don't have the fancy tool that Patrick used, so I
took my poor man's ruler and tried to measure the throw on the
ailerons.  The left aileron (looking from behind the plane) seems to
throw about 1mm more than the right, hence the reason for the cork
screw roll.  When working with such small increments it is very hard
to tell, but I did my best to eyeball it.  I adjusted the EPA on the
left aileron, which is on channel 1, and lowered it by 10%, and now
they seem pretty even.  If weather permits I'll fly it and report back
if the adjustments work.

Wish me luck :)

I have been thinking about (trying to visualize) the angle the
ailerons would have to be at to cork screw. . .

So if left is down and right is up we spin Clockwise
(looking from the rear in the direction of flight)

Right is down left is up we spin Counter Clockwise

Now. . .  What would cause it to corkscrew?

(all flat to start)

Imagine if you added some up elevator

Now turn hard Right

What would happen?

It would start to rise, start to roll
after 90 degrees it would now be &quot;rising&quot; &quot;out&quot; of the spin but still rotating
after 180 it would be trying to turn down

See how it is trying to steer out of a tight spiral and fly away?

Now, if a perfect &quot;spin&quot; was say. . .  12mm up on the right and 12mm
down on the left

If you added 3mm up &quot;up&quot; it would end up looking like

15mm up on the right and 9mm down on the left

hmmm.......

Another way I have been trying to visualize it is as follows:

What if you could just lift 1 aileron and leave the other neutral?
Like if one servo was disconnected?  Lets say only the left aileron is
connected (from rear)

(this one is a good visual example)

If you tried to turn Left the aileron would lift 12mm
(return to normal)
If you tried to pull up the aileron would lift 12mm

ah ha!

What would the plane do?

It would corkscrew like a mofo!  It would be pulling up and turning at
the same time.

I think this is an extreme example of what is going on.  I think the
reason that often times a plane will spin perfect in one direction and
sloppy in the other is due to endpoints.

I have also found that having some flutter in the ailerons will cause
intermittent corkscrew. . .
On my wing:  If I go straight (fast) and go hard right it will spin like a top

If on the otherhand I slow down a little, pull up a little, then hit
hard right it will corkscrew like crazy.  I think this is due first to
the speed, but made worse by the fact that the ailerons are carrying a
little bit up up with them into the maneuver due to slop.

Other ideas?

A very unbalanced plane should corkscrew.

If a wing was very heavy at the tip It seems like it would want to
rotate about that axis causing a net effect of a corkscrew.

What do you guys think?

(As you can tell I just had my morning coffee and I am a littttttle buzzzzzed)

You only had one cup? Hahahah.  I had to read it slowly and do a
visual, but I get the idea.

I still haven't flown my plane yet, since the adjustments, but I
believe my hunch is right and know why it's cork screwing.  When I do
a level flight and try to roll left, so aileron left up, and right
aileron down, it cork screws down.  To give an extreme example what
mine is doing.  Lets say the left aileron throws 13mm and the right
10mm.  Now fly straight and roll left.  This is what will happen.
Aileron left will point up 13mm and aileron right will point down
10mm.  Since the left aileron has more resistance due to more throw it
will force the plane to bank too much to the left causing the nose to
point down.  And this is exactly what I'm experiencing.  Ok, enough of
this left and right spin.  It's giving me a headache.  I'll fly it and
let you guys know.

ah. . .  The corals!

The frog that i pushed to the back is very happy though shaded
somewhat.  I suspect it could extend further but no one on earth would
say it is anything but ecstatic to be in my tank.

The hammer is about 2 - 3 times as large as it was.  Only thing
keeping it back is the rock, the glass, and the galaxy coral I put
beneath it to keep it in check.  (another vacationing coral from some
guy with a nano that ignored my warnings of 9&quot; stinging polyp
extension)

The two ricordea rocks are happy but not juicy yet.  I would guess it
will take them a month to start splitting again.

I did 3 more 20 Gallon water changes on my GF's tank, covered her sun
tank in aluminum foil and disconnected her kalk system and now her
coral is really coming back.  Shame she let it go so far but kids need
to learn lessons.  I told her for weeks that her PH was swinging but
no listen to captain.

Just keep your eye out for 100+ gallon tanks.  we need about 5,
acrylic preferred, $1.00 - $1.50 / gallon is what we pay.  Short is
good.

It is really about floor space.

If you want to take down a 100G tank you really need 3 100G tanks - or
- at least the floor space of 3 100G tanks.

The reasoning is that when I move I like to have all the water ready.
My current 100G tank is aquascaped in three dimensions filling the
entire volume.  If I want to lay out all that rock and coral (in a
safe way) I need a lot more floor space.

Make sense?

Then I dont have to worry about things falling over, touching, etc.

Also, using a very large volume of water for a coral move is good
because it allows you to keep things more stable, dilute the chemicals
released under stress easier, etc.  Just better know what I mean?

For the first few months we will have about 800G of water in tanks on
the floor until we can settle things out.  This will allow us a big
grace period to get the computers, skimmers, lights, pumps, calc
reactors, etc. sorted out without big swings in the water chemistry /
temperature.  The last thing I want to worry about is my coral.

Ok, my latest on the FJ.  After adjusting the EPA I flew it today, and
it seems better, but I couldn't quite tell.  I'll just leave it as
is.

I'm not sure if I didn't put enough throttle today at launch, but the
plane did a horrible torque roll on me.  Right at launch it went all
the way upside down.  I didn't expect this on my first launch, so it
crashed.  Luckily for the carbon fiber all the way to the nose, there
was no damage at all.  Note to self for next FJ build.  Put CF near
the nose.  All my other launches were pretty much the same, very
erratic.  One of them I was litterally inches of the ground doing some
funky move, but I somehow managed to apply more throttle and recover,
Pheeeew!!!  Another instance to show how strong this CF is.  I landed
on the grass field and nosed it a little too much.  It plowed some
grass off the field like a golfer teeing off.  Again, nose was
unharmed.  Now I gotta go back and analyze what caused the severe
torque roll.

Add way more throttle.  Go to 3/4
Launch it nearly straight up like a rocket (say 45 degrees up from
level and HARD)

Junjet can spin all it wants

It will be 50' off the ground before you get your hands on the sticks

----  See what I mean about the shaft down the middle =)  Saved me a
ton of times.  Not so much as a wrinkle.

Alright I'll try to launch the way you said, that way it will be high enough to recover.

Yes, the CF help tremendously.  With no CF the nose would have been crumpled.
