'

There is the &quot;fantastic relief&quot; of shedding all responsibility for
what is going on and for what has gone on and (by consequence) for
what will go on.

'

The &quot;fantastic relief&quot;

- of shedding (almost all) responsibility for seeing who is
who and what individuals have done,

and what these individuals - by consequence - will do
again;

- of shedding (almost all) responsibility for knowing what your
concerns and goals were, and are,

and what - by consequence - your concerns and goals will
be again, or indeed continue to be;

- of shedding (almost all) responsibility for knowing what your
abilities were and are,

and what - by consequence - indeed continue to be your
abilities, even if dormant or taken away.

'

'

The relief is called - amongst other things - 'Death,'
by some.  *(a)

However, many people at their death do not at all
drop their responsibility for life and for people,
but

they continue to nurture and protect life, your life
too, as much as they can and feel like doing, or are
invited by you to do,

which they (try to) do as what you commonly call
angels.  *(5)

Truly loving and responsible people will do
that, when they die

- till they find an opportunity to get born
again.  *(5)(6)(7)

But you say, 'What about Heaven, then,
and what about the Judgment and what
about Hell?'

Nobody ever told you the truth
about these things,

of course not, because it
was NOT THEIR INTENTION, to
tell you the truth,

so, as always, these things then
land on my shoulders - like on
'the broad shoulders of Plato,'
as the very faithful reader would
say.  *(1a)

(See also the upcoming
HRI 20070708 'What is True
about the Bible (and the
Koran and the Torah)?')

Truth, as the faithful reader is
aware, can be defined - and is
defined indeed (in your soul) as

'What happened and who caused
it and with what intention.'

This Human Rights Issue is not intended
to remind you again of the most simple
truth about it and to remove all the
atrocious lies you have been told and
forced to believe, &quot;about your death
and about anyone's death,&quot; however.

But this is about the living, meaning, people with their
soul in their living body, so we go back to the living.

'

'

Others - knowing not at all what the present IS - do call that
'shedding of responsibility' &quot;Living in the present,&quot; or &quot;being
fully and only in the present.&quot; *(b)

'

They omit, that the present is almost completely made up of the past,
and, that

the future is almost completely carrying on from and determined
by actions and by decisions made in the past - mostly even in a
very distant past.

THE MORE YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT PAST, THE MORE YOU ARE IN THE PRESENT.

'

And that gives, as promised, the actual Definition of 'Living in the
present':

The more you are aware of the past, the more you are in the
present, because

the present is almost completely made up of the past, and

the future is almost completely carrying on from and
determined by actions and decisions made in the past -

mostly even in a very distant past, and mostly by
others, too.  *(5)(6)

'

'

I will explain it more, to your pleasure.

There is the &quot;fantastic relief&quot; of shedding all responsibility
for what is going on and for what has gone on, and what, by
consequence, will go on.  *(c)

All the problems are still there, you see, but you are not
aware of these, you are only &quot;aware of the present&quot;

- meaning thus, to you, 'being only aware of where you are
now' and of 'with whom you are now.'

Now let's take a real-life example:

Someone makes you feel very bad, or inflicts much
pain on you, and as &quot;only the present exists for
you,&quot;

the inflicted condition now, &quot;is how you are,&quot;

you can NOT get out of the Energies inflicted,
because you have no reference point to the
past, in which the pain was not, nor to the
future, in which the pain will not be present:

&quot;All that exists, is the present,&quot; which
is the pain inflicted.

'

On top of that, you, &quot;being in the present,&quot; are ONLY
aware of (you only consciously know) how they, any
people you are with, are NOW,

or how - in the case of Criminal Minds - they pretend to
&quot;be&quot; now:

you - &quot;being in the present&quot; - are only aware of how
these individuals PRETEND to be,

because you have 'switched off' your connection to
and awareness of the past, of your PAST EXPERIENCE
WITH THEM, with particular individuals,

and you have, &quot;being in the present,&quot; switched off
any connection to the future, to WHAT THEY, Criminal
Minds, WILL do to you.

Criminal Minds OF COURSE DO like you to &quot;be
in the present only,&quot;

&quot;so that you feel happy about them.&quot;
*(11a)(11b)(11c)(12)

Most of the 'Peace Activists' are in this frame of
mind, and want you to join in it too.  *(13)(14)(15)

'

This gets of course much worse, because it makes you deny
your friends,

when you are not connected to the past of your actual and
true friends, but only &quot;living in the present,&quot;

WHICH IS THEN, ACTUALLY, &quot;your being immersed
in the Energies of Criminal Minds.&quot; *(10)

And so you see, in those Religions and those
Philosophies, that friendships become blotted out,

and the greatest Criminals suddenly become
&quot;friends,&quot; &quot;because everybody is the same,&quot;
though &quot;everybody is different.&quot; *(d)
*(11a-c)(12)(16)

(That is a paradox - an obvious conflict
of data - a conflict, an impossibility,
that you will find in practically all

and that is typical of all *(17)

the Energies - the ideas, the feelings -
used by and inflicted on you by Criminal
Minds,

and that makes their lies more difficult
to detect, because &quot;somehow they are
- their idea or their feeling is -
right.&quot;)

'

This - treating actual friends &quot;as being equal to&quot;
Criminal Minds, and treating Criminal Minds as
&quot;friends&quot; - allows, relays and creates tremendous
amounts of Ugliness, Treachery, and Destruction of
Life, *(11a-c)(12)(16)

which (the destruction of life) after all, IS the
- nicely worded, and well-hidden - goal of those
Religions and Philosophies that are planted on Earth
and that are maintained

&quot;to create on Earth a Paradise for Criminal
Minds.&quot; *(4)(3)(1)(2)

'

'

Thus there is the &quot;fantastic relief&quot; brought about by shedding
all responsibility for what is going on and for what has gone
on, and what, by consequence, will go on.

This means to you, then, that you are immersed in the illusion,

and you indeed experience the illusion - &quot;living in the
present&quot; -

that all is fresh and new, and that &quot;you don't know anything
about the people you meet,&quot; that &quot;you don't know anything about
your past, about who you really are.&quot;

'

While that &quot;not knowing&quot; is merely an illusion, (in fact
you do know but you only are temporarily disconnected from
it)

it provides you with the experience, that

&quot;there is only, what you see around you,&quot; that

&quot;you are 'living in the present'.&quot;

By having found and understood the false &quot;definition,&quot; the
ACTUAL Definition of 'Living in the Present' is thus
formulated more correctly, and it follows precisely here
below (in the next three paragraphs of this Human Rights
Issue):

'

'
{Definition}

By regaining a viewpoint on the ACTUAL present - it consists of all
the past that shapes both the present and the future too - you
regain a viewpoint on yourself (and on others too) as you actually
are.

This, you can actually experience, with a great resurgence of all
that is dear and extremely valuable in you.

And THAT is true relief - resulting in correct actions and genuine
compassion that springs and flows from true identity.

Textnotes:

(a)  Some use death (they go and die) in order to accomplish such a
&quot;relief&quot;

- usually with the idea and in the hope that they will get
reborn &quot;all fresh and new,&quot; or &quot;evolved and growing up in
better circumstances,&quot; or even, &quot;not reborn at all.&quot;

Whole religions or philosophies (all planted in and originating
from India) are based on and are trying to get people to achieve
this &quot;fantastic relief,&quot;

to not face life, not only to not face Criminal Minds, but
inevitably as a result, ALSO to deny one's friends,

to inevitably pervert and having to make love very
ugly indeed.

They have all manner of - very clever - methods to get you
to become irresponsible, and they (then have to) have - very
intelligent - lies &quot;about life,&quot; and &quot;about people,&quot; and (of
course also) &quot;about the past,&quot;

in order to make you or others &quot;want to strive for and
work towards this 'fantastic relief',&quot; *(2)

and they sell this as &quot;the ultimate goal in spiritual life,&quot; and
as &quot;spiritual Darwinism,&quot; (as spiritual &quot;Evolution&quot;) but

any even superficial investigation of any of the vast
amount of past life regression data does reveal most
easily and most thoroughly,

with data that they SHOULD be VERY interested in,

but, that quite understandably, they are not
at all interested in, because it reveals
most easily and fully, that

neither of these - neither the spiritual &quot;goal,&quot; nor their
spiritual &quot;Darwinism&quot; - do exist in actuality at all.  *(1)

Quite and very much the contrary DOES exist, as the
faithful reader does know.
'

(b)  They go and &quot;live only in the present&quot; - in order to experience
that, or at least as much as possible of that &quot;fantastic relief.&quot;
'

(c)  This 'being unaware of responsibility,' is not at all necessarily
a voluntary action either *(8)

- most unawareness of the past has been (and is continuously
being) enforced on everyone, and kept up very heavily, *(8)

by those who have every reason to want you NOT aware of
the past, not only not-aware of your own past (your own
memories and your abilities from the past) but especially
they want you NOT aware of THEIR past.  *(9)

They work most violently, to reduce awareness in people,
in anybody, in you, and

they work most forcefully and persistently, to get false
ideas about the mind and about awareness accepted, and
applied (assumed and used by everyone).
