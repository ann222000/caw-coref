perhaps U've good feeling about him, ya, i agree, i guess Rover's
Santa Cruz is very nice guy and cool striker as well.
if U miss a game, U'll find some informations there.
( www.rovers.premiumtv.co.uk )
articles, pix, movies, and others.

hey, did U c him?.... his play is splendid, and i grant he's just
looks like an actor..... though he's somewhat different as my kinda
guy.
he's too much bright, i mean i feel cooling mood with high clarity
from his figure.
in my view, Bayern's Klose is such another, however Klose differ a
little from Cruz.
which of the 2,...or do U like both?

Drenthe unhurt after crashing into police car(AFP) Tuesday 28 August 2007
http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=582858.htm...

Real Madrid's new Dutch midfielder Royston Drenthe escaped unharmed
after he was involved in a road accident with a police car, Spanish
sports daily Marca reported on Tuesday.

Drenthe's Audi collided with the police vehicle in the centre of
Madrid in the early hours of Monday after the 20-year-old Dutch
international made a wrong turn on a ring road, the newspaper said.

While the player and his three passengers were not injured in the
accident, a policeman was treated for whiplash.

Drenthe, who joined Real Madrid from Feyenoord earlier this month in a
deal worth 14 million euros (19 million US dollars), passed a
breathalyser, the newspaper reported.

&gt; Real Madrid's new Dutch midfielder Royston Drenthe escaped unharmed
&gt; after he was involved in a road accident with a police car, Spanish

&gt; international made a wrong turn on a ring road, the newspaper said.

&gt; While the player and his three passengers were not injured in the
&gt; accident, a policeman was treated for whiplash.

&gt; Drenthe, who joined Real Madrid from Feyenoord earlier this month in a
&gt; deal worth 14 million euros (19 million US dollars), passed a
&gt; breathalyser, the newspaper reported.

[Materazzi plots early return] (Reuters) Thursday 30 August 2007
http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=585242.htm...

defender Marco Materazzi says he will be out of action for two months,
not four as originally forecast.

He suffered a bad thigh injury last week in italy's 3-1 friendly
defeat in Hungary and doctors said he could be out until next year.
&quot;I'll be back in two months,&quot; the Inter Milan centre back said on
Thursday as he signed copies of his new official biography 'A Life as
a Warrior'.
The book charts his rise from a misfit with English Premier League
Everton to World Cup winner.
Materazzi was in confident mood after Inter were drawn with PSV
Eindhoven, CSKA Moscow and Fenerbahce in Champions League Group G.
&quot;They are tough teams but I believe they are all within our reach. We
are Inter and we must never forget this,&quot; he said.
&quot;We clearly have a few problems with suspensions and unfortunately my
injury has added to these but we must not start crying about them.&quot;

[Kaka named UEFA's best]  (Reuters) Thursday 30 August 2007
http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=585216.htm...

AC Milan's Kaka was named European club player of the year by UEFA on Thursday.

The Brazilian also collected the award for best forward during last
season's UEFA Champions League.
Chelsea's Petr Cech was named the best goalkeeper from last season's
tournament. AC Milan's Paolo Maldini won the best defender award while
team-mate Clarence Seedorf was judged to be the best midfielder.

&gt; Materazzi was in confident mood after Inter were drawn with PSV

&gt; &quot;They are tough teams but I believe they are all within our reach. We
&gt; are Inter and we must never forget this,&quot; he said.
&gt; &quot;We clearly have a few problems with suspensions and unfortunately my

&gt; The Brazilian also collected the award for best forward during last

&gt; Chelsea's Petr Cech was named the best goalkeeper from last season's

ppl!!!! look here!! it's my Figo!!!! i'm so cheerful :) :) :)

Midas touch (Friday 31 August 2007) by Paolo Menicucci
from Milan

&lt; http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/kind=4/newsid=577121.html &gt;

After waving goodbye to David Beckham, European football was on the
verge of losing another legend in May when Luís Figo mulled over a
lucrative offer from a club in Qatar. The move, though, collapsed and
when the former Portuguese international opted to stay with FC
Internazionale Milano instead, he had one goal in mind - to help the
Italian champions win what he describes as &quot;the queen of all European
competitions&quot; for the first time since 1965.

'Determined'
&quot;I believe we have everything required to go all the way, but
obviously we'll also need a bit of luck during the competition,&quot; Figo
told uefa.com as he looked ahead to the new UEFA Champions League
season. &quot;We're determined to give something very important to this
club and the UEFA Champions League is surely the queen of all European
club competitions. Winning the UEFA Champions League is always
difficult and very complicated because there are so many competitive
teams with great quality. We just have to keep working hard because
Inter are a great club and deserve to compete for the most important
titles every year.&quot;

&quot;Figo is a great person, known and appreciated everywhere&quot; - Inter
president Massimo Moratti

Inter affection
The UEFA Champions League dream and the affection shown by the entire
Inter family were the key factors behind his decision to stay. Massimo
Moratti personally asked Figo to change his mind. The Nerazzurri
president, though, refused to take all the credit for convincing him
to remain another season. &quot;Figo's decision to stay means he is almost
like a new signing for us,&quot; Moratti said. &quot;We would have needed two
players to replace someone like him. I have only given my voice to a
collective wish. The fans, the coach, his team-mates, everyone wanted
him to stay and I also think he has a brilliant future ahead of him.
We're planning to strengthen our international relations and Figo is a
great person, known and appreciated everywhere. He would fit this role
perfectly. We have already talked about it. I hope he will accept this
offer when he decides to stop playing.&quot;

'Lucky'
Before Figo's arrival from Real Madrid CF in 2005 Inter had last won
the Scudetto in 1989. Since then the 34-year-old, who was capped 127
times by Portugal, has helped the Nerazzurri claim the title twice, as
well as the Coppa Italia and the Italian Super Cup. &quot;I don't what
happened before I came here so I cannot say why Inter were not
winning,&quot; he explained. &quot;However I was lucky enough to arrive here and
have the pleasure of winning immediately. We worked very hard to win
those titles and we've won four or five in just a couple of years.
Inter fans hadn't celebrated for a few years so we're proud to have
given them the chance to do so by winning a great Scudetto like we did
last season.&quot;

'Winning mentality'
The Nerazzurri claimed a record 97 points en route to winning the
title, 22 more than their closest rivals AS Roma. Figo may not be the
only reason behind Inter's dominance but the leader of Portugal's
golden generation certainly brought with him the class and winning
mentality needed to help turn Inter from challengers to champions on
the domestic front. After losing to Valencia CF in the last 16 of the
UEFA Champions League last season, the aim now is to make that
experience tell in Europe. &quot;[Losing to Valencia] was a bad moment but
you can't win everything,&quot; said the former European Footballer of the
Year and FIFA World Player of the Year. &quot;It's very difficult to find a
team which is able to win on both domestic and European fronts during
the same season. We had a very good year, unfortunately it was not
enough to win in Europe. But I'm sure the entire club is as ready for
another shot at it as the players are.&quot;

Workload
Figo played 64 league games during his first two seasons in Italy but
the veteran is willing to cut his workload if it would result in
placing a second UEFA Champions League winner's medal alongside the
one he earned with Madrid in 2002. &quot;Every player would like to be on
the pitch all the time,&quot; he said. &quot;I will always try to be ready and
then we'll see how many games I play. I will always respect [coach
Roberto] Mancini's decisions. If we win the UEFA Champions League I
will be happy even if I haven't played as much as I did during the
first two seasons. We know it's not easy but we have to try.&quot;

&lt; http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/kind=4/newsid=577121.html &gt;

&gt; ppl!!!! look here!! it's my Figo!!!! i'm so cheerful :) :) :)

&gt; Midas touch (Friday 31 August 2007) by Paolo Menicucci
&gt; from Milan

&gt; &lt; http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/kind=4/newsid=577121.html &gt;

&gt; After waving goodbye to David Beckham, European football was on the
&gt; verge of losing another legend in May when Luís Figo mulled over a
&gt; lucrative offer from a club in Qatar. The move, though, collapsed and
&gt; when the former Portuguese international opted to stay with FC
&gt; Internazionale Milano instead, he had one goal in mind - to help the
&gt; Italian champions win what he describes as &quot;the queen of all European
&gt; competitions&quot; for the first time since 1965.

&gt; 'Determined'
&gt; &quot;I believe we have everything required to go all the way, but
&gt; obviously we'll also need a bit of luck during the competition,&quot; Figo
&gt; told uefa.com as he looked ahead to the new UEFA Champions League
&gt; season. &quot;We're determined to give something very important to this
&gt; club and the UEFA Champions League is surely the queen of all European
&gt; club competitions. Winning the UEFA Champions League is always
&gt; difficult and very complicated because there are so many competitive
&gt; teams with great quality. We just have to keep working hard because
&gt; Inter are a great club and deserve to compete for the most important
&gt; titles every year.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Figo is a great person, known and appreciated everywhere&quot; - Inter
&gt; president Massimo Moratti

&gt; Inter affection
&gt; The UEFA Champions League dream and the affection shown by the entire
&gt; Inter family were the key factors behind his decision to stay. Massimo
&gt; Moratti personally asked Figo to change his mind. The Nerazzurri
&gt; president, though, refused to take all the credit for convincing him
&gt; to remain another season. &quot;Figo's decision to stay means he is almost
&gt; like a new signing for us,&quot; Moratti said. &quot;We would have needed two
&gt; players to replace someone like him. I have only given my voice to a
&gt; collective wish. The fans, the coach, his team-mates, everyone wanted
&gt; him to stay and I also think he has a brilliant future ahead of him.
&gt; We're planning to strengthen our international relations and Figo is a
&gt; great person, known and appreciated everywhere. He would fit this role
&gt; perfectly. We have already talked about it. I hope he will accept this
&gt; offer when he decides to stop playing.&quot;

&gt; 'Lucky'
&gt; Before Figo's arrival from Real Madrid CF in 2005 Inter had last won
&gt; the Scudetto in 1989. Since then the 34-year-old, who was capped 127
&gt; times by Portugal, has helped the Nerazzurri claim the title twice, as
&gt; well as the Coppa Italia and the Italian Super Cup. &quot;I don't what
&gt; happened before I came here so I cannot say why Inter were not
&gt; winning,&quot; he explained. &quot;However I was lucky enough to arrive here and
&gt; have the pleasure of winning immediately. We worked very hard to win
&gt; those titles and we've won four or five in just a couple of years.
&gt; Inter fans hadn't celebrated for a few years so we're proud to have
&gt; given them the chance to do so by winning a great Scudetto like we did
&gt; last season.&quot;

&gt; 'Winning mentality'
&gt; The Nerazzurri claimed a record 97 points en route to winning the
&gt; title, 22 more than their closest rivals AS Roma. Figo may not be the
&gt; only reason behind Inter's dominance but the leader of Portugal's
&gt; golden generation certainly brought with him the class and winning
&gt; mentality needed to help turn Inter from challengers to champions on
&gt; the domestic front. After losing to Valencia CF in the last 16 of the
&gt; UEFA Champions League last season, the aim now is to make that
&gt; experience tell in Europe. &quot;[Losing to Valencia] was a bad moment but
&gt; you can't win everything,&quot; said the former European Footballer of the
&gt; Year and FIFA World Player of the Year. &quot;It's very difficult to find a
&gt; team which is able to win on both domestic and European fronts during
&gt; the same season. We had a very good year, unfortunately it was not
&gt; enough to win in Europe. But I'm sure the entire club is as ready for
&gt; another shot at it as the players are.&quot;

&gt; Workload
&gt; Figo played 64 league games during his first two seasons in Italy but
&gt; the veteran is willing to cut his workload if it would result in
&gt; placing a second UEFA Champions League winner's medal alongside the
&gt; one he earned with Madrid in 2002. &quot;Every player would like to be on
&gt; the pitch all the time,&quot; he said. &quot;I will always try to be ready and
&gt; then we'll see how many games I play. I will always respect [coach
&gt; Roberto] Mancini's decisions. If we win the UEFA Champions League I
&gt; will be happy even if I haven't played as much as I did during the
&gt; first two seasons. We know it's not easy but we have to try.&quot;

Stuttgart look to Europe (Friday 31 August 2007) by Paul Woloszyn

&lt; http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/kind=16384/newsid=575893.html &gt;

German champions VfB Stuttgart have not enjoyed the most auspicious of
starts to the defence of their title but as they prepare for their
first appearance in the UEFA Champions League since 2003/04, optimism
within the camp is still high.

Memorable season
Last season's Bundesliga was one of the most exciting in recent years
with just four points separating the top three teams as Stuttgart
edged out FC Schalke 04 on the final day of the season to clinch their
first German title since 1992. It was a remarkable season for Armin
Veh's side, who embarked on a nine-game winning streak to pip Schalke
and narrowly missed out on the domestic double when they lost 3-2
against 1. FC Nürnberg after extra time in the German Cup final.

'Different situation'
This season the pressure is on to prove that their exploits of 2006/07
were no flash in the pan but just one point from their opening two
games was certainly not the start they wanted. Victory against MSV
Duisburg last week helped raise morale but midfield star Thomas
Hitzlsperger is under no illusions about the task ahead. &quot;It's a
different situation now,&quot; the 25-year-old told uefa.com. &quot;Everywhere
we go the teams are more motivated and trying to beat us because we're
champions. But we know we are a good side and I'm confident we can
still do well.

'Optimistic'
&quot;We've only played a couple of games and it's a long season with a
long way to go. We're looking forward to the next few games because I
think we've done well so far, even though we haven't got the results.
We were unlucky against Hertha [BSC Berlin], we played well first half
and just put our heads down a little in the second, but I'm quite
optimistic we'll do well this season again.&quot; Hitzlsperger began his
third campaign at Stuttgart with a goal in the 3-1 defeat against
Hertha on 18 August. It was in England, though, that he made his name
appearing 99 times for Aston Villa FC before moving back to his
homeland in 2005.

'Fantastic'
Hitzlsperger is now looking forward to making his mark on the UEFA
Champions League, where they have been drawn in a fascinating group
with FC Barcelona, Olympique Lyonnais and first opponents Rangers FC.
&quot;It's fantastic,&quot; enthused the man dubbed Der Hammer because of his
trademark left-foot shot. &quot;To play in the Champions League is going to
be really good, but we've got to focus on the Bundesliga first. It's
like a bonus being in it and we're obviously looking forward to it.
There are some big games and it's what every player aims for, to play
at the highest level.&quot;

Unique opportunity
Stuttgart will be dining at Europe's top table for the first time in
four seasons and hoping to improve on their showing last time when
after defeating Manchester United FC in the group stage they were
narrowly beaten 1-0 over two legs in the first knockout round by
Chelsea FC. The club have boosted their ranks with the signings of
playmaker Yildiray Bastürk, forward Ewerthon, goalkeeper Raphael
Schäfer and Romanian striker Ciprian Marica, and Marica, a €7m arrival
from FC Shakhtar Donetsk understands the lure of Europe's premier club
competition. &quot;Stuttgart are an important club who will play in the
Champions League,&quot; said the 21-year-old, part of the Shakhtar team
that fell at the group stage last season. &quot;To play in it is something
unique. No money on earth can replace the feeling of playing there and
the opportunities which taking part in such a competition offer to a
player.&quot;

'Friendly environment'
Marica scored twice in the group stage for Shakhtar and after making
73 league appearances over four years in Ukraine decided to test
himself at a higher level. &quot;I deeply wanted a new challenge because I
think I have the potential to play better,&quot; he said. &quot;I have found a
very friendly environment. I have been a little bit surprised, but
immediately realised I shouldn't have been. After the first training
session my new team-mates offered to help me with various issues to
adapt in Stuttgart. I feel like one of them and this is so important.&quot;

Big talents
Marica, capped 15 times by his country with five goals to his name,
was part of the Romania team that beat Turkey 2-0 last week, on a
night that Germany took a squad containing four Stuttgart players to
Wembley for the 2-1 defeat of England. As well as Hitzlsperger,
Joachim Löw's ranks also contained promising youngsters Serdar Tasci,
Sami Khedira and Roberto Hilbert, giving real hope for the future.
&quot;They've done well,&quot; says Hitzlsperger. &quot;They've all come and done
really well to make it into the squad, so overall it's looking quite
bright.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Midas touch (Friday 31 August 2007) by Paolo Menicucci
&gt; &gt; &gt; from Milan

&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/kind=4/newsid=577121.html &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; After waving goodbye to David Beckham, European football was on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; verge of losing another legend in May when Luís Figo mulled over a
&gt; &gt; &gt; lucrative offer from a club in Qatar. The move, though, collapsed and
&gt; &gt; &gt; when the former Portuguese international opted to stay with FC
&gt; &gt; &gt; Internazionale Milano instead, he had one goal in mind - to help the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Italian champions win what he describes as &quot;the queen of all European
&gt; &gt; &gt; competitions&quot; for the first time since 1965.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 'Determined'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I believe we have everything required to go all the way, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; obviously we'll also need a bit of luck during the competition,&quot; Figo
&gt; &gt; &gt; told uefa.com as he looked ahead to the new UEFA Champions League
&gt; &gt; &gt; season. &quot;We're determined to give something very important to this
&gt; &gt; &gt; club and the UEFA Champions League is surely the queen of all European
&gt; &gt; &gt; club competitions. Winning the UEFA Champions League is always
&gt; &gt; &gt; difficult and very complicated because there are so many competitive
&gt; &gt; &gt; teams with great quality. We just have to keep working hard because
&gt; &gt; &gt; Inter are a great club and deserve to compete for the most important
&gt; &gt; &gt; titles every year.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Figo is a great person, known and appreciated everywhere&quot; - Inter
&gt; &gt; &gt; president Massimo Moratti

&gt; &gt; &gt; Inter affection
&gt; &gt; &gt; The UEFA Champions League dream and the affection shown by the entire
&gt; &gt; &gt; Inter family were the key factors behind his decision to stay. Massimo
&gt; &gt; &gt; Moratti personally asked Figo to change his mind. The Nerazzurri
&gt; &gt; &gt; president, though, refused to take all the credit for convincing him
&gt; &gt; &gt; to remain another season. &quot;Figo's decision to stay means he is almost
&gt; &gt; &gt; like a new signing for us,&quot; Moratti said. &quot;We would have needed two
&gt; &gt; &gt; players to replace someone like him. I have only given my voice to a
&gt; &gt; &gt; collective wish. The fans, the coach, his team-mates, everyone wanted
&gt; &gt; &gt; him to stay and I also think he has a brilliant future ahead of him.
&gt; &gt; &gt; We're planning to strengthen our international relations and Figo is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; great person, known and appreciated everywhere. He would fit this role
&gt; &gt; &gt; perfectly. We have already talked about it. I hope he will accept this
&gt; &gt; &gt; offer when he decides to stop playing.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; 'Lucky'
&gt; &gt; &gt; Before Figo's arrival from Real Madrid CF in 2005 Inter had last won
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Scudetto in 1989. Since then the 34-year-old, who was capped 127
&gt; &gt; &gt; times by Portugal, has helped the Nerazzurri claim the title twice, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; well as the Coppa Italia and the Italian Super Cup. &quot;I don't what
&gt; &gt; &gt; happened before I came here so I cannot say why Inter were not
&gt; &gt; &gt; winning,&quot; he explained. &quot;However I was lucky enough to arrive here and
&gt; &gt; &gt; have the pleasure of winning immediately. We worked very hard to win
&gt; &gt; &gt; those titles and we've won four or five in just a couple of years.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Inter fans hadn't celebrated for a few years so we're proud to have
&gt; &gt; &gt; given them the chance to do so by winning a great Scudetto like we did
&gt; &gt; &gt; last season.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; 'Winning mentality'
&gt; &gt; &gt; The Nerazzurri claimed a record 97 points en route to winning the
&gt; &gt; &gt; title, 22 more than their closest rivals AS Roma. Figo may not be the
&gt; &gt; &gt; only reason behind Inter's dominance but the leader of Portugal's
&gt; &gt; &gt; golden generation certainly brought with him the class and winning
&gt; &gt; &gt; mentality needed to help turn Inter from challengers to champions on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the domestic front. After losing to Valencia CF in the last 16 of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; UEFA Champions League last season, the aim now is to make that
&gt; &gt; &gt; experience tell in Europe. &quot;[Losing to Valencia] was a bad moment but
&gt; &gt; &gt; you can't win everything,&quot; said the former European Footballer of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Year and FIFA World Player of the Year. &quot;It's very difficult to find a
&gt; &gt; &gt; team which is able to win on both domestic and European fronts during
&gt; &gt; &gt; the same season. We had a very good year, unfortunately it was not
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough to win in Europe. But I'm sure the entire club is as ready for
&gt; &gt; &gt; another shot at it as the players are.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Workload
&gt; &gt; &gt; Figo played 64 league games during his first two seasons in Italy but
&gt; &gt; &gt; the veteran is willing to cut his workload if it would result in
&gt; &gt; &gt; placing a second UEFA Champions League winner's medal alongside the
&gt; &gt; &gt; one he earned with Madrid in 2002. &quot;Every player would like to be on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the pitch all the time,&quot; he said. &quot;I will always try to be ready and
&gt; &gt; &gt; then we'll see how many games I play. I will always respect [coach

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions&quot; for the first time since 1965.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'Determined'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I believe we have everything required to go all the way, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obviously we'll also need a bit of luck during the competition,&quot; Figo
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told uefa.com as he looked ahead to the new UEFA Champions League
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; season. &quot;We're determined to give something very important to this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; club and the UEFA Champions League is surely the queen of all European
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; club competitions. Winning the UEFA Champions League is always
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difficult and very complicated because there are so many competitive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; teams with great quality. We just have to keep working hard because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Inter are a great club and deserve to compete for the most important
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; titles every year.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Figo is a great person, known and appreciated everywhere&quot; - Inter
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; president Massimo Moratti

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Inter affection
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The UEFA Champions League dream and the affection shown by the entire
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Inter family were the key factors behind his decision to stay. Massimo
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moratti personally asked Figo to change his mind. The Nerazzurri
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; president, though, refused to take all the credit for convincing him
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to remain another season. &quot;Figo's decision to stay means he is almost
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like a new signing for us,&quot; Moratti said. &quot;We would have needed two
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; players to replace someone like him. I have only given my voice to a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; collective wish. The fans, the coach, his team-mates, everyone wanted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him to stay and I also think he has a brilliant future ahead of him.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We're planning to strengthen our international relations and Figo is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great person, known and appreciated everywhere. He would fit this role
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfectly. We have already talked about it. I hope he will accept this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offer when he decides to stop playing.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'Lucky'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Before Figo's arrival from Real Madrid CF in 2005 Inter had last won
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Scudetto in 1989. Since then the 34-year-old, who was capped 127
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times by Portugal, has helped the Nerazzurri claim the title twice, as

&gt; &gt; Stuttgart look to Europe (Friday 31 August 2007) by Paul Woloszyn

&gt; &gt; &lt; http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/kind=16384/newsid=575893.html &gt;

&gt; &gt; German champions VfB Stuttgart have not enjoyed the most auspicious of
&gt; &gt; starts to the defence of their title but as they prepare for their
&gt; &gt; first appearance in the UEFA Champions League since 2003/04, optimism
&gt; &gt; within the camp is still high.

&gt; &gt; Memorable season
&gt; &gt; Last season's Bundesliga was one of the most exciting in recent years
&gt; &gt; with just four points separating the top three teams as Stuttgart
&gt; &gt; edged out FC Schalke 04 on the final day of the season to clinch their
&gt; &gt; first German title since 1992. It was a remarkable season for Armin
&gt; &gt; Veh's side, who embarked on a nine-game winning streak to pip Schalke
&gt; &gt; and narrowly missed out on the domestic double when they lost 3-2
&gt; &gt; against 1. FC Nürnberg after extra time in the German Cup final.

&gt; &gt; 'Different situation'
&gt; &gt; This season the pressure is on to prove that their exploits of 2006/07
&gt; &gt; were no flash in the pan but just one point from their opening two
&gt; &gt; games was certainly not the start they wanted. Victory against MSV
&gt; &gt; Duisburg last week helped raise morale but midfield star Thomas
&gt; &gt; Hitzlsperger is under no illusions about the task ahead. &quot;It's a
&gt; &gt; different situation now,&quot; the 25-year-old told uefa.com. &quot;Everywhere
&gt; &gt; we go the teams are more motivated and trying to beat us because we're
&gt; &gt; champions. But we know we are a good side and I'm confident we can
&gt; &gt; still do well.

&gt; &gt; 'Optimistic'
&gt; &gt; &quot;We've only played a couple of games and it's a long season with a
&gt; &gt; long way to go. We're looking forward to the next few games because I
&gt; &gt; think we've done well so far, even though we haven't got the results.
&gt; &gt; We were unlucky against Hertha [BSC Berlin], we played well first half
&gt; &gt; and just put our heads down a little in the second, but I'm quite
&gt; &gt; optimistic we'll do well this season again.&quot; Hitzlsperger began his
&gt; &gt; third campaign at Stuttgart with a goal in the 3-1 defeat against
&gt; &gt; Hertha on 18 August. It was in England, though, that he made his name
&gt; &gt; appearing 99 times for Aston Villa FC before moving back to his
&gt; &gt; homeland in 2005.

&gt; &gt; 'Fantastic'
&gt; &gt; Hitzlsperger is now looking forward to making his mark on the UEFA
&gt; &gt; Champions League, where they have been drawn in a fascinating group
&gt; &gt; with FC Barcelona, Olympique Lyonnais and first opponents Rangers FC.
&gt; &gt; &quot;It's fantastic,&quot; enthused the man dubbed Der Hammer because of his
&gt; &gt; trademark left-foot shot. &quot;To play in the Champions League is going to
&gt; &gt; be really good, but we've got to focus on the Bundesliga first. It's
&gt; &gt; like a bonus being in it and we're obviously looking forward to it.
&gt; &gt; There are some big games and it's what every player aims for, to play
&gt; &gt; at the highest level.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Unique opportunity
&gt; &gt; Stuttgart will be dining at Europe's top table for the first time in
&gt; &gt; four seasons and hoping to improve on their showing last time when
&gt; &gt; after defeating Manchester United FC in the group stage they were
&gt; &gt; narrowly beaten 1-0 over two legs in the first knockout round by
&gt; &gt; Chelsea FC. The club have boosted their ranks with the signings of
&gt; &gt; playmaker Yildiray Bastürk, forward Ewerthon, goalkeeper Raphael
&gt; &gt; Schäfer and Romanian striker Ciprian Marica, and Marica, a €7m arrival
&gt; &gt; from FC Shakhtar Donetsk understands the lure of Europe's premier club
&gt; &gt; competition. &quot;Stuttgart are an important club who will play in the
&gt; &gt; Champions League,&quot; said the 21-year-old, part of the Shakhtar team
&gt; &gt; that fell at the group stage last season. &quot;To play in it is something
&gt; &gt; unique. No money on earth can replace the feeling of playing there and
&gt; &gt; the opportunities which taking part in such a competition offer to a
&gt; &gt; player.&quot;

&gt; &gt; 'Friendly environment'
&gt; &gt; Marica scored twice in the group stage for Shakhtar and after making
&gt; &gt; 73 league appearances over four years in Ukraine decided to test
&gt; &gt; himself at a higher level. &quot;I deeply wanted a new challenge because I
&gt; &gt; think I have the potential to play better,&quot; he said. &quot;I have found a
&gt; &gt; very friendly environment. I have been a little bit surprised, but
&gt; &gt; immediately realised I shouldn't have been. After the first training
&gt; &gt; session my new team-mates offered to help me with various issues to
&gt; &gt; adapt in Stuttgart. I feel like one of them and this is so important.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Big talents
&gt; &gt; Marica, capped 15 times by his country with five goals to his name,
&gt; &gt; was part of the Romania team that beat Turkey 2-0 last week, on a
&gt; &gt; night that Germany took a squad containing four Stuttgart players to
&gt; &gt; Wembley for the 2-1 defeat of England. As well as Hitzlsperger,
&gt; &gt; Joachim Löw's ranks also contained promising youngsters Serdar Tasci,
&gt; &gt; Sami Khedira and Roberto Hilbert, giving real hope for the future.
&gt; &gt; &quot;They've done well,&quot; says Hitzlsperger. &quot;They've all come and done
&gt; &gt; really well to make it into the squad, so overall it's looking quite
&gt; &gt; bright.&quot;

TRANSFER RUMOURS
&lt; http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/gossip_and_transfers/6973661... &gt;

&quot;Ronaldinho has agreed to join Chelsea from Barcelona - next season. (Express)&quot;

WHAT!!!?? REALLY?????

-- * -- * -- * -- * -- * -- * --

Owen, he also! i'm not his supporter, but i'm glad 2 c it.

Newcastle 1-0 Wigan
&lt; http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6963710.stm &gt;
Newcastle striker Michael Owen scored a late winner to finally crack
the resistance of 10-man Wigan.

Newcastle boss Sam Allardyce:
&quot;It was a great goal and overall, a very, very comfortable, good performance.
&quot;We completely dominated the game, but found a little bit of hard luck.
&quot;A couple of good saves from the keeper and some poor finishing meant
we were frustrated at half-time that we were not one or two goals up.&quot;

wonderful win!

Real Madrid boss Schuster: Heinze is ready (29.08.07)

http://www.ontheminute.com/news/news.php?news=7694

Real Madrid coach Bernd Schuster says new signing Gaby Heinze is ready
to make his debut for the club against Villarreal this weekend.
Heinze joined Real from Manchester United.

Schuster said: &quot;Heinze is already in shape to play some minutes
because he is training at a good rate, but (Arjen) Robben is still not
sufficiently fit to be considered. We must treat him with more
patience.&quot;

http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=396429

New Real Madrid signing Gabriel Heinze missed his side's 2-1 win in
the Madrid derby, but is set to debut in the Santiago Bernabeu Trophy
on Wednesday as the Merengues take on Sporting Lisbon...

Gabriel Heinze is set to don the white shirt of Real Madrid for the
first time on Wednesday as Real Madrid face Sporting Clube de Portugal
(Lisboa) in the Santiago Bernabeu Trophy.

The Argentina international has been working double sessions in the
gym in order to be ready for the exhibition match, contested since
1979, and is hoping to be first-choice left back for this tie.

As well as serving as an exhibition match for the Madrid fans, coach
Bernd Schuster will use this match as practice for La Liga - and a
chance to test new ideas.

Miguel Torres and Royston Drenthe have served as left-backs so far,
with Marcelo well out of favour, and the competition will hot up as
Heinze makes his debut.

That said, Schuster seems set to use Drenthe, a new arrival from
Feyenoord, mostly in an attacking position, rather than left-back,
meaning that Heinze could yet find himself first choice - should he
displace Miguel Torres...

Real Madrid have won the Trofeo Santiago Bernabeu for the past two
seasons, defeating Belgian side Anderlecht last year and a Major
League Soccer selection in 2005.

&gt; Newcastle striker Michael Owen scored a late winner to finally crack
&gt; the resistance of 10-man Wigan.

&gt; Newcastle boss Sam Allardyce:
&gt; &quot;It was a great goal and overall, a very, very comfortable, good performance.
&gt; &quot;We completely dominated the game, but found a little bit of hard luck.
&gt; &quot;A couple of good saves from the keeper and some poor finishing meant
&gt; we were frustrated at half-time that we were not one or two goals up.&quot;

&gt; wonderful win!

Luca Toni Out Of Hamburg Clash (01/09/2007 21:23)

http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=401332

Bayern Munich striker Luca Toni will miss the trip to Hamburg after
failing to recover from injury.

The Bavarian side will have to do without their Italian striker for
the North- South clash on Sunday.  The World Cup winner has not
travelled to Hamburg with the team following a thigh injury picked up
last weekend against Hannover.

It now looks as though Miroslav Klose will play as a lone striker with
Lukas Podolski starting on the bench.

Klose missed the Hannover game with a knee injury, but there is now
nothing in his way to making his return.

Podolski will make his return for the first time since April.  Also
making a return to the squad is Argentine José Ernesto Sosa.

&gt; Real Madrid coach Bernd Schuster says new signing Gaby Heinze is ready
&gt; to make his debut for the club against Villarreal this weekend.
&gt; Heinze joined Real from Manchester United.

&gt; Schuster said: &quot;Heinze is already in shape to play some minutes

&gt; sufficiently fit to be considered. We must treat him with more

Luca Toni Out Of Hamburg Clash (01/09/2007 21:23)

Bayern Munich striker Luca Toni will miss the trip to Hamburg after
failing to recover from injury.

The Bavarian side will have to do without their Italian striker for
the North- South clash on Sunday.  The World Cup winner has not
travelled to Hamburg with the team following a thigh injury picked up
last weekend against Hannover.

It now looks as though Miroslav Klose will play as a lone striker with
Lukas Podolski starting on the bench.

Klose missed the Hannover game with a knee injury, but there is now
nothing in his way to making his return.

Podolski will make his return for the first time since April.  Also
making a return to the squad is Argentine José Ernesto Sosa.

&gt; Real Madrid coach Bernd Schuster says new signing Gaby Heinze is ready

&gt; Heinze joined Real from Manchester United.

&gt; Schuster said: &quot;Heinze is already in shape to play some minutes

&gt; Gabriel Heinze is set to don the white shirt of Real Madrid for the
&gt; first time on Wednesday as Real Madrid face Sporting Clube de Portugal

&gt; The Argentina international has been working double sessions in the

&gt; As well as serving as an exhibition match for the Madrid fans, coach

&gt; Miguel Torres and Royston Drenthe have served as left-backs so far,
&gt; with Marcelo well out of favour, and the competition will hot up as
&gt; Heinze makes his debut.

&gt; That said, Schuster seems set to use Drenthe, a new arrival from
&gt; Feyenoord, mostly in an attacking position, rather than left-back,
&gt; meaning that Heinze could yet find himself first choice - should he
&gt; displace Miguel Torres...

&gt; Real Madrid have won the Trofeo Santiago Bernabeu for the past two

Luca Toni Out Of Hamburg Clash (01/09/2007 21:23)

Bayern Munich striker Luca Toni will miss the trip to Hamburg after
failing to recover from injury.

The Bavarian side will have to do without their Italian striker for
the North- South clash on Sunday.  The World Cup winner has not
travelled to Hamburg with the team following a thigh injury picked up
last weekend against Hannover.

It now looks as though Miroslav Klose will play as a lone striker with
Lukas Podolski starting on the bench.

Klose missed the Hannover game with a knee injury, but there is now

Podolski will make his return for the first time since April.  Also
making a return to the squad is Argentine José Ernesto Sosa.

Ibrahimovic Brace Gets Inter Going (01/09/2007 22:25)

http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=401358

Empoli 0-2 Inter Milan

A brace from Zlatan Ibrahimovic saw Inter pick up their first win of
the Serie A season.

Inter managed to get their season on track courtesy of a 2-0 victory
away to Empoli.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic was the key figure for the defending champions with
a goal in each half, while Francesco Toldo - who was deputising for
the suspended Julio Cesar - also did his part in securing the three
points.

The first goal came in the 13th minute, when Maicon's superb ball
found Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and the Swede - in the right place at the
right time - simply had to tap it in.

Inter failed to find that second goal for much of the game, and one
worried whether it would be a repeat of the late disaster against
Udinese.

Empoli refused to throw in the towel, and actually grew more and more
confident with time. Indeed, they could well have been level but for
some poor finishing, and some good work from Toldo.

However, with eight minutes remaining on the clock, Ibra struck again,
this time breaking superbly to convert a pass from Cesar.

That just about finished the job for the Nerazzurri, who move to the
top of the Serie A table, though that should change tomorrow
afternoon.

First Half

Inter, who were suited up in one of their most distinct away kits in
recent history - an all white uniform with a bold red cross across the
front of the shirt - started the game brightly with some fast flowing
confident football right off the bat.

It was the hosts, however, who had the first real chance of the game.
Marzoratti rose highest to meet a corner but the precision did not
match the power of the header.

It didn't take long for the visitors to make their early dominance
count, and it was their top scorer from last season who duly did the
duties. Maicon showed some good footwork to work space for the cross
and Ibrahimovic gratefully pounced for the opener at the far post.

It bears mentioning that both teams were temporarily down to 10-men at
that point as an unintentional clash of heads in the midfield led to
Cesar and Busce both bloody and in need of treatment

There was a strong claim for a penalty just a minute later on the
other end. Once again Cordoba and Samuel were out-jumped but this time
Saudati was sent for a crash-landing by the combination of a little
hip-check and push in the back from Inter's defensive duo.  The
referee saw nothing wrong in the challenge, however, despite the fact
that neither defender got close to the ball which the Empoli striker
was poised to get his head on.

Undeterred by the perceived lack of justice, Empoli had a golden
chance to level matters on 36 minutes. Antonini would have been
disappointed to have drilled his shot wide, however, after a sublime
little chipped pass by Giacomazzi left him with only Toldo to beat.

Inter almost managed to deliver the deadly blow just before the half,
but Balli did very well to get a strong hand to a scorching shot from
the explosive Suazo, who was handed his first Serie A start for Inter.

Second Half

Suazo began the second half in the same vein. One of the many neat
interchanges between him and Ibrahimovic ended up with the Honduran
striker leaving three defenders for dead with a clever feint and
strong surge but again Balli was equal to the task.

Apart from the opening burst, the defending champions again approached
the second-half in rather lackadaisical fashion.

Empoli visibly drew confidence from their first sustained bouts of
possession and came close to a 55th minute equalize but for a strong
save from Toldo off a scorching long-distance drive from Moro.

With 20 minutes to go and his teammates all gone missing, Toldo did
even better to deny a Raggi header from close range with an agile
kick-save.

Just when it looked like another dramatic draw might be in store for
the defending champions, Ibrahimovic produced another poacher's finish
to secure the points. A quick counterattack involving Figo and Cesar
ended with the Swede alone in front of Balli and he was never going to
make a mistake from that close in.

&gt; Luca Toni Out Of Hamburg Clash (01/09/2007 21:23)

&gt; Bayern Munich striker Luca Toni will miss the trip to Hamburg after
&gt; failing to recover from injury.

&gt; The Bavarian side will have to do without their Italian striker for
&gt; the North- South clash on Sunday.  The World Cup winner has not
&gt; travelled to Hamburg with the team following a thigh injury picked up
&gt; last weekend against Hannover.

&gt; It now looks as though Miroslav Klose will play as a lone striker with
&gt; Lukas Podolski starting on the bench.

&gt; Klose missed the Hannover game with a knee injury, but there is now
&gt; nothing in his way to making his return.

&gt; Podolski will make his return for the first time since April.  Also
&gt; making a return to the squad is Argentine José Ernesto Sosa.

&gt; &gt; Real Madrid boss Schuster: Heinze is ready (29.08.07)

&gt; &gt; http://www.ontheminute.com/news/news.php?news=7694

&gt; &gt; Real Madrid coach Bernd Schuster says new signing Gaby Heinze is ready
&gt; &gt; to make his debut for the club against Villarreal this weekend.
&gt; &gt; Heinze joined Real from Manchester United.

&gt; &gt; Schuster said: &quot;Heinze is already in shape to play some minutes
&gt; &gt; because he is training at a good rate, but (Arjen) Robben is still not
&gt; &gt; sufficiently fit to be considered. We must treat him with more
&gt; &gt; patience.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Real Madrid Heinze To Debut In Bernabeu Cup (28/08/2007 11:50)

&gt; &gt; http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=396429

&gt; &gt; New Real Madrid signing Gabriel Heinze missed his side's 2-1 win in
&gt; &gt; the Madrid derby, but is set to debut in the Santiago Bernabeu Trophy
&gt; &gt; on Wednesday as the Merengues take on Sporting Lisbon...

&gt; &gt; Gabriel Heinze is set to don the white shirt of Real Madrid for the
&gt; &gt; first time on Wednesday as Real Madrid face Sporting Clube de Portugal
&gt; &gt; (Lisboa) in the Santiago Bernabeu Trophy.

&gt; &gt; The Argentina international has been working double sessions in the
&gt; &gt; gym in order to be ready for the exhibition match, contested since
&gt; &gt; 1979, and is hoping to be first-choice left back for this tie.

&gt; &gt; As well as serving as an exhibition match for the Madrid fans, coach
&gt; &gt; Bernd Schuster will use this match as practice for La Liga - and a
&gt; &gt; chance to test new ideas.

&gt; &gt; Miguel Torres and Royston Drenthe have served as left-backs so far,
&gt; &gt; with Marcelo well out of favour, and the competition will hot up as
&gt; &gt; Heinze makes his debut.

&gt; &gt; That said, Schuster seems set to use Drenthe, a new arrival from
&gt; &gt; Feyenoord, mostly in an attacking position, rather than left-back,
&gt; &gt; meaning that Heinze could yet find himself first choice - should he
&gt; &gt; displace Miguel Torres...

&gt; &gt; Real Madrid have won the Trofeo Santiago Bernabeu for the past two
&gt; &gt; seasons, defeating Belgian side Anderlecht last year and a Major
&gt; &gt; League Soccer selection in 2005.

Bundesliga Reaction: Magath Blames The Trains (01/09/2007 20:42)

http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=401298

Wolfsburg trainer Felix Magath had an unusual scapegoat for his team's
loss to Hertha Berlin. Werder win their second game in a row, while
Rostock find themselves rooted to the foot of the table. Here the
trainers give their reactions to match day 4.

Wolfsburg trainer Felix Magath had an unusual scapegoat for his side's
2-1 loss to Hertha Berlin- the German rail network.

&quot;My congratulations go to Hertha's main sponsors.  It took 'Deutsche
Bahn' three hours to get us here from Wolfsburg, a journey that
normally takes an hour.

&quot;Because of that I cannot criticise my team.  It wasn't until the
second half that we showed the good football we can play.
Unfortunately after the equaliser we stopped going forward, so in the
end the win for Hertha was deserved.&quot;

Hertha trainer Lucien Favre commented, &quot;We played very well in the
first half and should have been more than 1-0 ahead.  Wolfsburg
reacted well in the second half, and were the better side for a time.
At the end we showed great character and deserved the win.&quot;

Werder Bremen continued their recent improvement in form to secure a
2-1 home win against Frankfurt.

&quot;We've come a long way in the last two weeks, the team has improved
day after day.  Frankfurt denied us space, but we were patient and
then turned the game in our favour.  Our position in the table has
improved and I believe we will continue to move upwards.&quot;

Frankfurt trainer Friedhelm Funkel admitted, &quot;Werder deserved their
win.  We started well at the back, but offered very little upfront.
In the second half we became a little more offensive.  After going 2-0
down, we were only able to score a consolation goal.

After watching his side surrender a two-goal lead, before finally
ending up winning 3-2, Hannover trainer Dieter Hecking was delighted
with the three points against Bochum.

&quot;Over the whole game, it was a deserved win.  I'm very happy with our
first half performance, we were competitive, and controlled the ball.
Unfortunately from the 40th minute, we invited Bochum into the game.

&quot;In the second half we were unsure, and they deserved the equaliser.
But I must pay my team a compliment for the way they came back.&quot;

Bochum's Marcel Koller was disappointed with the defeat.  &quot;From my
point of view, it was an unnecessary loss.  We were asleep in the
first half and didn't play as we wanted.  We only showed what we could
do in the second period.  This defeat however won't change our
philosophy.&quot;

Cottbus and Nürnberg shared the spoils in a game that both sides
needed to win.  Petrick Sander was unhappy with the point.  &quot;We were
aggressive and showed enough desire on the day.  At the end of the day
we just lacked a little luck and we punished with a set-piece.  But
today we didn't play like relegation candidates.&quot;

Nürnberg trainer Hans Meyer was also dissatisfied with the result.  &quot;I
am not altogether happy with a point.  For parts of the game we played
as well as I could have expected.  But at the end, the work of the
team was rewarded, despite having to play half an hour a man down.  We
could have even won it at the end.&quot;

Rostock remain rooted to the bottom of the table after a 1-0 home
defeat to Dortmund.  Frank Pagelsdorf was not however totally
downhearted at the loss.

&quot;I have to compliment the team for the courage they showed.  We always
tried to go forward.  Now it's important for us to take heart from
this performance.

&quot;If we continue to play this way, then I'm sure we will get some
points on the board very soon.&quot;

Dortmund's Thomas Doll was glad of his second win on the trot.  &quot;Of
course we're delighted to have got three points.  We would have had no
complaints if we had gone behind as they attacked well and had the
better chances.  I'm particularly happy that we kept another clean
sheet.&quot;

Duisburg returned to winning ways with a 3-0 win over Arminia
Bielefeld.  Rudi Bommer declared himself unhappy with the first half
showing from his side.

&quot;I wasn't pleased with the team in the first period,  they were
nervous.  In the second half we really wanted the three points and the
risks we took paid off.&quot;

Bielefeld trainer Ernst Middendorp admitted the better team won.  &quot;I
think that today the points deserved to stay in Duisburg.  In the
second half, we had a 20 minute spell when we were not in the game.&quot;

&gt; Ibrahimovic Brace Gets Inter Going (01/09/2007 22:25)
