The first time I saw Bob Dylan play Merriweather Post Pavilion was in June
of 1981.  That show was the last time I saw Dylan play new unreleased
original songs, from the forthcoming Shot of Love.  Almost 20 years later he
returned to Merriweather in the summer of 2000 for a fully charged show.
This time around was marked by a 30 minute (at least) wait to get into the
parking lot, arriving in time to hear a terrific intense, highly political
and emotional set by Elvis Costello.  I didn't get all of the song titles so
I'm not going to go into it in detail, but he brought the crowd to their
feet several times.  He was great.

To new music behind the usual intro Bob Dylan and band took the stage and
launched into a not bad &quot;Rainy Day Women,&quot; which was immediately followed by
a very good &quot;Senor.&quot;  Dylan's voice was undoubtedly rough but strong.  Then
came one of the songs I was hoping to see, the new speeded up but it works
arrangement of &quot;Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,&quot; with Bob taking a couple of
well Bob Dylan guitar solos.  During the song he found some riff he
obviously liked and stayed with it and also handed a solo over to Denny
Freeman.  From where our seats were it was hard to see the entire band at
one time.

Dylan then moved to the keyboards for &quot;Simple Twist of Fate.&quot;  The
arrangement was good, but the feel didn't come close to the one at
Continental Airlines Arena last November.  During the song it became evident
that his voice was just not in great shape, but every now and then a line
would ring out, but overall I felt the song lost steam.

The energy returned big time however with a very hot &quot;Rollin' And Tumblin&quot;
with very funky slide by Denny on his Les Paul Gibson.

Then came what was for me the highlight of the evening, an exquisite
&quot;Workingman's Blues #2&quot; with Donnie Herron on electric mandolin.  There was
no doubt Dylan and the band were treating this song with extra special care.
Not a note was misplaced, and Dylan not only sang, but almost read the lines
like a poet in a way that made each word stand out.  It was perfect.

Almost immediately they went into a very strong &quot;Desolation Row,&quot; with new
very nice Mexican flavored solos by Denny Freeman.  Though the song started
with the usual rhythm, by the end it had taken on a distinctly Latin feel.

Next came another song I had yet to see, &quot;Beyond the Horizon.&quot;  But
something just wasn't happening.  After an intro, that left me unsure what
song it was going to be they went into a kind of &quot;Don't Fence Me In,&quot; kind
of rhythm - the same rhythm the Who use on &quot;Soon Be Gone,&quot; but it seemed to
be abandoned pretty fast for something approximating the rhythm on the
album.  It was almost as if they couldn't hear each other.  Whatever it was
they didn't seem to be in sync, sort of coming together when Denny would
solo.  Bob kind of saved it at the end with a harp solo.

A hard rocking &quot;Honest With Me&quot; came next with George Riceli playing very
loud drums.  This led into &quot;When The Deal Goes Down&quot; with the waltz rhythm
at times a little too prominent, with beautiful guitar work from Denny.

A hard grooving &quot;Highway 61&quot; led another high point, &quot;Ain't Talkin&quot; with
Donnie on viola.  Dylan's singing was great and intense letting certain
lines (&quot;walkin' through the cities of the plague&quot;) truly stand out but
stumbled almost comically on superfluous, but then quickly getting it right.

A western swing meets rockabilly &quot;Summer Days,&quot; let into a very powerful
&quot;Masters of War,&quot; and for all his claims of what the song is supposed to be
about when he sang, &quot;The young people's blood flows out of their bodies and
is buried in the mud,&quot; you couldn't help but think of Iraq.

After a fairly long break, they returned for &quot;Thunder on the Mountain,&quot; and
&quot;Blowin' In the Wind.&quot;  When I saw this arrangement in Atlantic City in
June, it seemed like they were trying for a couple of things at once, sort
of the Stevie Wonder arrangement meets Fats Domino, but this time around it
kind of settled down into a sweeter, softer and way more soulful with Stu
Kimball doing a cool descending riff, before the last line.  Dylan was truly
singing like he meant it, with extra effort and at times and definitely on
the last chorus, at times the old voice, the one that could effortlessly
send chills down your spine emerged, and then for one last time he reached
for the harp for one last very cool solo to end the night.

Hey - thanks for the notes on this show.  Wanted to attend but could not.
Ain't it great Bob is still out playing his tunes at places like this?
Glad you could be there!

Hey Peter...again we never ran into each other!!  I was down front,
stood with my fist in the air during Masters!  I had a great time, I
think Bob and the fellas were in great spirits.  I felt the show
flowed quite well, and was just plain delighted when Ain't Talkin came
on.  That has to be my favorite Blowin in the Wind....nice...very very
nice.
Wasn't Amos Lee a solo act in Philly, way back when..lol.  He was alot
like Dave Matthews.  Elvis was very gutsy and pulled off the solo
performance quite well.  I did enjoy his political songs.
hope all is well with your own work
Chris

You know how much I respect your opinions, Peter, but this is exactly what I
can't bear of some present performances.
He actually speaks, yes, he does.
He reads the lines.
Do you really think that's perfect?
Don't you prefer the studio version fair and square?
(not a rethorical question, mind you, I'd really love to have your opinion)

Oh, and thanks for the review!

It was a great peformance it made the night.  Whether or not I prefer the

Neither did I, Peter.
*he reads the lines* was supposed to be read as *he sings (them) as if he
were reading (them lines)*
