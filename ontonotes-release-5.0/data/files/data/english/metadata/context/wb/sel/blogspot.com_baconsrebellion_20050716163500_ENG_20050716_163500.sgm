Even I felt bad for Jerry before this one was over. It was
painful...like watching the Rodney King beating all over again. I
understand now why Kilgore is hesitant to debate. He should be. Watch
for any future encounters already scheduled to be cancelled.

I guess you saw the debate much differently than Larry Sabato.

I have a hard time believing either of these two serious,
public-spririted men totally dominated this debate. At the end of the
day, it's the positions and philosophy that linger. If you are a Kaine
partisan, he can't lose. The same for a Kilgore partisan.

Love that vivid imagery of clubbing baby seals and Rodney King.
Politics ain't beanbag, is it?

I think the difference is I actually SAW the debate. Hey, man, it's
hockey without the helmets! You might want to check the vet story. I lay
into you on that one too--but only because I love ya!

Sabato was present at the debate.

He did countless interviews when it was over.

I was there. Kilgore was stroger and Kaine defended well. I am from
W.Va and I have to give this one to Jerry Kilgore.

I wonder if Barnie wrote that post on Friday and set his AutoSend for
Saturday afternoon. He seems to be the only person in Virginia who
thinks Kilgore didn't edge out Kaine.
