Okay, girl, let's see if we could be a match...

You're a reasonable attractive white or Asian female that has a heated
passion for the erotic side of life.

You must be unattached - no married women, please.

You have a deep need for affection and can show the same to your partner.

You are naturally submissive and willing to please your man.

You prefer much older, men in your life.

You're between the age of 25 and 45 years old.

You enjoy writing e-mail and have both the time and
the talent to write beyond the high-school level.

*** You MUST be ***
very open minded, totally honest, serious and real!

** You MUST have a quality digital camera. **

You need not include a photo in your reply, but that would be very much
appreciated and get my attention much faster.

You just never know... this could become a 24/7 real-time relationship.
Think positive!

Com'on, now, none of those short, 1 or 2 line replies.  OK?

I am very discreet and you must be, too!

Go for it, girl!
