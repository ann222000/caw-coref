May Day's (Beltane's) Pagan Roots
what.html

Beltane is a festival of flowers, fertility, sensuality, and delight.
It is one of paganism's eight sabbats, and second in importance only
to Samhain (Halloween), which is the Witches New Year by the old Celtic
calendar. Beltane (also known as May Eve, May Day, and Walpurgis Night)
ushers in the fifth month of the year, May. &quot;Beltane&quot; is derived from
the Irish Gaelic 'Bealtaine' or the Scottish Gaelic 'Beatuinn', meaning
'Belfire', the fire of the Celtic god of light (Bel, Beli, or Belinus).
He in turn can be traced back to the Middle Eastern god Baal.

The Beltane celebration should begin on April 30 at sunset, as sunset is
the proper time to kindle the great Bel-fires on the tops of the nearest
beacon hill. These fires are said to have healing properties, and would
offer protection to nude celebrants leaping through them, or dancing
clock-wise around them. It is legend that children conceived as
a result of the festivities of Beltane (known as Merry-Be-Gots)
were gifted by the gods.

A Beltane celebration is a time of unashamed human sexuality and
fertility. This can be seen in the Maypole dance traditionally performed
on this day. The Maypole represents the male aspect of the God, as a
phallic symbol. While the brightly colored ribbons (traditionally red
and white); represent the Goddess aspect and the Goddess transition from
Maiden to Mother. Red and white ribbons traditionally represent the
blood that flows from the woman when her purity is taken. Thus this
holiday represents the Divine Union of the Lord and Lady. It is this
union that brings forth the springtime renewal of life from the long
sleep of winter.

Why isn't it like that now? It was tamed and redirected. In the 17th
century, May Day came under severe attack by the puritans who banned it
by an act of Parliament in 1644. In Philip Stubbe's &quot;Anatomy of Abuses&quot;,
which was a puritan tract against all kinds of merrymaking, there is a
section called 'Against May', where he actually tries to measure the
degree of sexual license. &quot;Every parish town and village assemble
themselves together. Men and women and children, old and young and go
off, some to the woods and groves, some to the hills and mountains,
where they spend the night in pastimes. In the morning they return
bringing with them birch-boughs and trees to deck their assemblies
withal. I've heard it credibly reported by men of great gravity,
credibility and reputation. That forty, three score, or a hundred
youths, going to the woods over night. They have scarcely the
third part of them, returned home again undefiled.&quot;

The Puritans also objected to May Day, and other festivals, because of
the way that social hierarchy was set aside, so that all were commonly
involved, from the highest to the lowest. The Puritans found this
offensive much preferring strict gradations in society. May Day did
return with the restoration of Charles II in 1660, but it didn't have
the same robust force. It had the same old image, but the elements
of sexual license and social reversal went underground. Then in the
nineteenth century, the Victorians cast a much more moral tone on the
festival, emphasizing its innocence. Instead of being a celebration
of fertility, it turned into a kind of commemoration of Merri England.
The girls taking part now wore white and held POSIES.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;When Oxford was twenty-two, a book called _A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres_
was published. Ogburn believes that Oxford wrote much of this book,
which includes a prose narrative called The Adventures of Master F. I.,
as well as poetry. This prose narrative has been called the first
English novel. A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres is, in part, a satire of a
courtier named Christopher Hatton, whom Shakespeare later satirized in
Twelfth Night as Malvolio. In both Flowres &amp; Twelfth Night, Hatton is
portrayed as the author of a love letter addressed to a woman of high
rank. Hatton is known to have been in love with Queen Elizabeth.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres was first published anonymously in 1573
with a Latin Posie Meritum petere, grave, on the title page where an
author's name ordinarily appeared. Two years later the contents of
AHSF were rearranged, altered, and published as The POSIES of George
Gascoigne. In 1576, copies of POSIES (not of AHSF) were confiscated
by Her Majesty's Commissioners. Clearly something was amiss. Literary
editors, however, have chosen to ignore the significance of POSIES'
omissions, additions and differences from AHSF. AHSF passed into
literary bibliography as the work of the soldier-of-fortune
George Gascoigne and, for what on its face it appeared to be,
a collection of innocent verses and narrative tales.

In a 1926 edition of AHSF,
Captain Bernard M. Ward advanced the theory that:

(1) AHSF was a first attempt in Elizabeth's reign of a poetical
anthology. It was compiled, edited, and contributed to by Edward de
Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford and Lord Great Chamberlain of England;

(2) the POSY on the title page, and signed to
sixteen of the hundred poems, was Lord Oxford's;

(3) the signature Si Fortunatus Infoelix was the POSY of
Christopher Hatton, a commoner, fast-rising in the Queen's favor;

(4) the initials F.I. (deliberately altered to F.J. in POSIES)
stood for the principal letters in Hatton's POSY
- thus doing away with the (1573) linking of Hatton,
in an embarrassing way, to the story of F.I.'s

Ward concluded, &quot;The full story of Flowres remains to be told.&quot;

had no-one equal to you as the subject of their laudations.

It is an old idea that time recurs in a cycle and the same state of
affairs comes into being many times, once in each cycle. Katherine
Duncan-Jones quotes Ecclesiastes chapter 1.
9. The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which
is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under
the sun.
10. Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it
hath been already of old time, which was before us.
11. There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be
any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come
after.
The speaker accepts that this may have happened to poetry, but
vehemently denies that anyone like his addressee ever existed before.
The couplet is integral to this view, not a change of focus as
Blakemore Evans says.

Line 3, 'amiss'. Not that they miscarry, but what they produce can
never be really new, except in their deluded minds.

Line 5, re-CORD is stressed on the second syllable as now in certain
legal uses. It means written records rather than memory. (So Burrow,
against Duncan-Jones.)

Line 6. This must mean five hundred years, not five hundred days,
despite Sheridan's parody in The Critic (roughly, from memory):
'Scarce four revolving suns
And three revolving moons have run their course'
where you cannot tell if he means four years and three months or four
days and three nights.
That lands us in the late 12th or early 13th century - not a flowering
period for English literature, I would have thought. Maybe there is
some connection with the family origins of the addressee?
Kerrigan suggests this is a reference to the 600-year astronomical
cycle after which the skies return to their previous configuration.
That involves taking 'hundred' to mean 120, in Old Norse style still
used for counting eggs, which seems to me a problem. (It goes back to
Ingram and Redpath, from a suggestion of Pooler.)

Line 8, 'character'. This is to be a written description, not an
ordinary picture. 'Image' is metaphorical. The words 'in character'
then mean 'in written letters'. The obvious connection with the
character of a person is there to avoid making things too easy for us.
The image is from portrait painting. 'Done' is often used to mean
'made into a portrait'. It seems more appropriate to think of one
person's portraying another's mind, rather than of a person's
expressing himself.

Line 10, 'composed' is three syllables. Though the poet is writing
about the addressee's frame (body), this word continues to keep us
thinking about literary composition.

Line 11, 'where', is taken by Blakemore Evans and others as a short
form of another 'whether'. I would think it un-Shakespearian to repeat
exactly so many times.

Robert.

Thanks for posting Sonnet # 59 and restating its contents in plain
language.

At first glance, it occurred to me that the imagery is of a kind
whereby the Sonnets' Author might 'document' the essential UNITY of the
Saga Literature of 13th century Iceland and the Shakespeare Opus of
Elizabethan/Jacobean England.

And, as I checked out the Sonnets' Cipher Values, the first two lines -

If their bee nothing new, but that which is, = 19725
Hath beene before, how are our braines beguild, = 17841 = 37566

- immediately brought to mind the prefatory material of Emblem # 34 in
'Minerva Britanna' as 'penned' by invisible Monad as on the work's
frontispiece -

Monad = 1

Ex malis moribus bonæ leges. = 11922
[From the death of evil, a legacy of good.]

To the most iudicious, and learned, = 15049
Sir FRANCIS BACON, Knight. = 10594 = 37566

How, then, might Monad as presumptive Author have built the Answer to
the Questions raised in Sonnet # 59 into its text?

Monad = 1

If their bee nothing new, but that which is, = 19725
Hath beene before, how are our braines beguild, = 17841
Which laboring for inuention beare amisse = 18626
The second burthen of a former child? = 14890
Oh that record could with a back-ward looke, = 19622
Euen of fiue hundreth courses of the Sunne, = 19855
Show me your image in some antique booke, = 18418
Since minde at first in carrecter was done. = 19258
That I might see what the old world could say, = 21138
To this composed wonder of your frame, = 18696
Whether we are mended,or where better they, = 20338
Or whether reuolution be the same. = 16629
Oh sure I am the wits of former daies, = 16788
To subiects worse haue giuen admiring praise. = 21621 = 263446

This is mirrored in the Cipher Sum 11359 + 10594 + 241493 = 263446,
where

11359 = Snorri Sturluson (d. 1241) - the Icelandic sage and literary
master, who embedded the Saga-Shakespeare Cipher Key into a single
sentence in the oldest extant Icelandic skin manuscript, whence I
extracted in 30 years ago;

10594 = Sir Francis Bacon, Knight - Snorri Sturluson's &quot;successor&quot; as
sage and literary master in Elizabethan/Jacobean England; and

241493 = the Cipher Value of the two-verse poem under Emblem # 34:

The Viper here, that stung the sheepheard swaine, = 21993
(While careles of himselfe asleepe he lay,) = 15505
With Hysope caught, is cut by him in twaine, = 20621
Her fat might take, the poison quite away, = 18154
And heale his wound, that wonder tis to see, = 20149
Such soveraigne helpe, should in a Serpent be. = 19232

By this same Leach, is meant the virtuous King, = 20053
Who can with cunning, out of manners ill, = 20110
Make wholesome lawes, and take away the sting, = 20557
Wherewith foule vice, doth greeue the virtuous still: = 28164
Or can prevent, by quicke and wise foresight, = 20037
Infection ere, it gathers farther might. = 16918 = 241493

See

for Peter Dawkins' construction of the mythical imagery reflected in
the accompanying emblem which shows Francis Bacon wielding a Rod to
kill a Serpent - the Staff of Moses in Exodus 4:1-5 &quot;That they may
believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.

A crazy-ass* notion by the lights of Stratfordian Fundamentalists -

* (Copyright David Kathman)

- documented for the record by Abraham Cowley in 'Ode to the Royal
Society' in the 17th century as follows:

Bacon, like Moses, led us forth at last,
The barren wilderness he past,
Did on the very border stand
Of the blest promis'd land
And from the mountain's top of his exalted wit,
Saw it himself, and shew'd us it.

Later, Perce Bysshe Shelley wrote of Bacon's 'exalted wit' as follows:

&quot;Lord Bacon was a poet. His language has a sweet and majestic rhythm
which satisfies the sense, no less than the almost superhuman wisdom of
his philosophy satisfies the intellect; it is a strain which distends
and then bursts the circumference of the reader's mind, and pours
itself forth together with it into the universal element with which it
has perpetual sympathy.&quot;

A strain that drives crazy-ass* Stratfordians up and off the wall.

I might have said 'even if it was as much as five hundred
years ago'. There doesn't seem to be a definite way to
decide; I picked the one I did because I really thought 500
years were not enough.

I share this problem about why 500 is an appropriate number.
Against Kerrigan, you can't say 500 when you really mean
precisely 600, unless you can find a reason for having 120
years to the century, and I find his reason fanciful.

And what about 'even'? Whether it means 'as much as' or 'as
little as', it seems to preclude a purely vague meaning. It
draws attention to the number it quotes.

But why use 500 to mean 'a great many', when a thousand
would mean it more easily and be nearer right? That is, it
would get us within shooting distance of the classical
period, though 1,700 would be better still. Or is there some
medieval French poetry in roughly the right spot? 500 years
before Shakespeare could have been chosen for its
barrenness, so far as I am aware! I feel the need for some
suggestion or possibility of eminence, though not for any
specific examples.

Is there some poet, or school of poets, who began the
practice of writing poetical character-sketches? I am at a
loss to identify any poetical character-sketches at all,
except for a few satirical squibs - Arrius in Catullus who
aspirated every word with an opening vowel, or people in
Martial or Juvenal, or Ben Jonson's Poet-Ape or Pope's
Atticus. Perhaps some of the poems on people's deaths:
'Allas, my worthy maister honorable' (Hoccleve) or 'It is
not growing like a tree' (Jonson) or Sam Johnson on Robert
Levet?

This leaves me with the impression that I have missed the
point somewhere, without being able to tell where. What I
have said seems less than completely coherent.

Re. &quot;five hundred courses of the sun&quot;.

The Phoenix Myth is an integral part of the Augustan-Saga-Shakespeare
tradition, as indicated in the Shakespeare Opus by 'The Phoenix and the
Turtle'.

According to Einar Pálsson, 500 years is the life span of the Phoenix,
with the choice of the year 1000 A.D., as in 2 x 500, for the adoption
of Christianity as law of the land in Iceland serving to relate it to
The Second Coming of Christ.

Here is an Internet posting on related issues:

The Phoenix enjoys immortality, which had to be renewed with fire every
300 to 500 years. When the end of its life cycle drew near, the phoenix
would gather aromatic herbs, woods, and spices from around the world
with which to build its own funeral pyre or nest. Sitting in the nest,
and having turned to face the rays of the sun, beating its wings, it
deliberately fans the flames for itself and is consumed in the fire.
Once the old body was consumed, the phoenix would be reborn from a
worm, its marrow, or an egg found among the ashes and would embark on
another 500 years of life. According to some legends, the renewed
phoenix carried its old bones to the City of the Sun in Egypt where
they were disposed of with special funeral rites.

So the legend of the phoenix originated in Egypt...

So what have we learned from Sonnet 59 that we didn't already
know?

Nothing much.

One word description of the poem: Unique.

Sonnet sub-group: You are so beautiful (along with 20 - 21 &amp; 53).

***************************************************

The story so far:

So after fifty-nine sonnets, what do we know?

The addressee or referent of the first fifty-nine
sonnets is probably the same person (although it has been
speculated that perhaps the speaker of the first seventeen
poems is different). At any rate, we are assuming that the
same person is the addressee of these sonnets.

We still don't know what the relationship is between
the speaker and the addressee. It is clearly an intense,
emotional relationship. Whether it is sexual is uncertain.

The speaker says the addressee is physically
attractive. The description of that beauty is in terms that
would seem more suitable to a woman than a man. (1 - 7, 9,
13, 17-19, especially 20, 41, 54)

The speaker says that the addressee is narcissistic.
(1 - 4, 6)

The speaker may be chiding the addressee's sexual
habits. (1 - 4, 6, 9, 40 - 42, 58)

The addressee is male. (3, 6, 9, 16, 19-20, 26, 33,
39, 41)

The speaker is male. (20, 32)

The addressee is of marriageable age, meaning (I
think) that he would be in the 17 - 26 age range. (1 - 4, 6,
8 - 13, 16, 17)

The speaker claims he has no interest in sexual
relations with the addressee. (20)

The addressee is sexually interested in women. (41)

The speaker is sexually interested in women. (41)

Women are sexually attracted to the addressee. (3, 16, 20,
41,)

The speaker has a wife or mistress. (40 - 42).

A snag appears in the relationship between the
speaker and addressee. (33, 34)

The snag that appeared in the relationship between
the speaker and addressee seems to concern something that
the addressee did to the speaker which caused the speaker
shame. The addressee, however, is contrite, and the speaker
has forgiven him. (34)

While it's not certain, the snag that appeared in
the relationship between the speaker and the addressee
probably concerns a love stolen from the speaker by the
addressee. (35)

It seems that the addressee *has* stolen a lover
from the speaker (40 - 42), but the speaker forgives him.
(40, 42)

The speaker expresses concern that he might lose the
affections/attention of the addressee. (48)

The speaker has a very humble opinion of himself, and is
prepared to excuse almost any behaviour of the addressee (35, 49,
57-58).

It's still uncertain what class the speaker and addressee
belong to. Some have argued that Sonnet 25 indicates that the speaker
is not a member of the nobility, while others argue that it indicates
that he is a member of the nobility. Some readers have also suggested
that certain words and phrases used in the sonnets indicate that the
addressee is of noble birth. (37, 40)

The speaker's life involved travel that took him
away from the addressee. Possibly, the travel involved
service for the addressee. (27 - 28, 39, 43 - 45, 47, 50-51)

By the time of Sonnet 52, whenever it is, the speaker
doesn't seem to be seeing the addressee very often. (52).

Note that we still don't know where the speaker or
the addressee live.

There seems to have been a lull in the speaker/addressee's
emotional relationship. (56)

The speaker has a picture of the addressee which he enjoys
looking at. (47)

The speaker is preoccupied at night by images of the
addressee. (27-28; 43)

The poet says he is in disgrace for some reason, and
that he is a self-described outcast of some sort, and that
he feels sorry for himself and envious of others, a feeling
that is dispelled when he thinks of his relationship with
the addressee. (29)

The speaker tells us that his sad memories are
dispelled when he thinks of the addressee. (30)

The speaker says that he is poor, despised and,
possibly, physically disabled. (37)

The speaker distinguishes himself from &quot;the rich&quot;. (52)

However, while the speaker says he is poor in Sonnet 37, he
then says, in Sonnet 48, that he owns jewels. (48)

The speaker so identifies with the addressee, that
any and all of the speaker's faults and shortcomings are
resolved in the positive attributes of the addressee. (37)

The speaker says he sees, in the addressee, the
embodiment of former deceased loves. (31)

The speaker says all good things are but shadows of the
addressee. (53)

The speaker says the addressee has a pleasant
speaking voice and enjoys listening to sad music. (8)

The speaker says the addressee has a gracious and
kind presence. (10)

The speaker seems to think that the addressee has
some sort of love for the speaker. (10, 25, 34, 36, 39, 41)

The speaker seems to have some sort of affectionate
feelings for the addressee, calling him such things as
&quot;love&quot;, &quot;dear my love&quot;, &quot;master-mistress of my passion&quot; and
&quot;Lord of my love&quot;. (13, 19, 20-33, 40, 54, 57-58)

These feelings are so strong that they leave the
speaker tongue-tied about those feelings in the presence of
the addressee. (23)

The speaker expresses humility about his ability to
express, in writing, his feelings for the addressee. (26,
32)

For some reason, the speaker thinks that the
addressee will be dishonoured by publicly associating with
the speaker. (36)

The speaker seems to have believed in a religious theory of
the resurrection of the dead. (55)

The speaker is an aesthetic snob. (11)

The speaker may believe in astrology. (15)

The speaker rides a horse. (50 - 51)

The speaker initially thinks that having children is
a better method than a painting or a poem for the addressee
to preserve himself. (16, 17) However, the speaker comes to
say that he can preserve the beauty of the addressee in his
poetry (18 - 19, 54 -55).

The speaker, having posed a problem for the
addressee, is offering a solution to that problem - namely
that the addressee should have children - specifically, a
son. (1-14, 16, 17). (But let's remember that it's only the
speaker's assertion that beautiful people have some sort of
obligation to the world to propagate or preserve their
beauty.)

While seeming to chastise the addressee for his
narcissistic failure to preserve or propagate his beauty,
the speaker is, at the same time, acknowledging that beauty,
and so is flattering the addressee.

Sonnet groupings (a tentative listing of the sonnets
read so far and how they might be grouped):

Get married, young man: 1 - 14, 16 - 17.

Forever young: 15, 18 - 19, 54 - 55.

You are so beautiful: 20 - 21, 53, 59.

I am unworthy: 23, 25 - 26, 32.

You're in my heart: 22, 24, 46 - 48.

Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you: 27 - 30, 43 - 45, 50 - 52.

You done me wrong: 33 - 34, 40 - 42.

We two are one: 36 - 37, 39, 42.

You're my soul and inspiration: 38.

Anything you do is alright with me: 35, 49, 57 - 58.

? - 31, 56.
