Treading cautiously

Amidst the record breaking run of the benchmark indices, the Sensex and the Nifty, it is easy to downplay or even ignore the extreme volatility that has
gripped the share markets. Volatility in stock prices is not new to the domestic markets and, within limits, is only to be expected. However, as was seen
spectacularly on Wednesday, the Sensex gyrated by as many as 665 points during one trading day. The huge intraday volatility, rather than its record breaking
closing on that day - just 150 points short of 18,000 - reflects what has become the defining characteristic of the stock markets in recent weeks. Yet
if investor attention is glued to the virtually one-way, upward movement of the Sensex and the Nifty, there are reasons for it. The Sensex had risen by
1,000 points to touch 17,000 in just five trading sessions. The more broad-based Nifty took 23 sessions to reach 5,000. Until Wednesday, the Sensex has
been scaling new highs every day for 10 days in a row. From a level of 15,669 on September 18, it climbed to 17,847 points on October 3, a 14 per cent
gain. On Thursday, the indices slipped slightly but continued their upward momentum during most of Friday. The Sensex almost touched 18,000 but closed
sharply lower at 17,723. Over the week, the Sensex gained 2.5 per cent and the Nifty 3 per cent.

Indian stocks are currently among the most highly priced in the emerging markets category. Attracted by the strong macroeconomic fundamentals and robust
corporate earnings, foreign institutional investors have been pouring money into Indian stocks. In September alone, the net FII investments were of the
order of $4.7 billion. Spurred by the cut in the interest rates in the United States and the weakening dollar, large investors have been looking to the
emerging markets for higher returns. In India the strong rally is liquidity driven. The turnover in stocks has been very high. However, the rally has not
been broad-based. It would be facile to think that the stock prices will always be moving up even over the near term. The external as well as the domestic
factors that favoured Indian stock markets may not endure for long. The U.S. sub-prime crisis might become worse and lead to a recession. In India too,
there have been a few signals suggesting a slight slowing down of the economy. Retail investors would do well to heed the advice of Union Finance Minister

P. Chidambaram, among others, to be careful with their investment strategies and to judiciously take the mutual funds route.

Undiluted commitment

An initiative to bring out a European Union declaration on the International Day against the death penalty (October 10) stands aborted, thanks to Poland's
veto. Its opposition has to do with internal compulsions rather than to the softening of its stance on the abominable practice. What is significant is
that the protest to the move came not from anti-abolitionists, but from sections in the right-wing government who wanted to push the case against abortion
and euthanasia through the backdoor. They reasoned that if the argument against capital punishment is that it violates the right to life, so does the termination
of pregnancies and assisted suicide. Such a deduction is erroneous on many counts. The case against the death penalty is that the right to life is universal,
absolute and inviolable and institutions of the state that are supposed to protect this fundamental right cannot resort to the practice even as a form
of punishment. The attempt to expand the scope of the debate presumes that abortion and euthanasia constitute a violation of life. Indeed, the right of
the mother to abort a foetus and the rights of the terminally ill to end their own lives are necessarily subject to severe qualifications. For instance,
compelling grounds of the woman's health, lack of autonomy in fertility decisions, her capacity to discharge the responsibilities of parenthood, and pregnancies
resulting from rape are factors that underpin the case for abortion. Similarly, euthanasia or assisted suicide presupposes the consent of persons suffering
an incurable illness, and the termination of life is to be carried out in a medically appropriate manner.

By implication therefore, indiscriminate recourse in either situation is precluded. Moreover, the state does not use its coercive power and, to that extent,
the right to life is not at issue. Differences over the declaration (since vetoed) take away little from the EU's common position as all the 27 states
have abolished capital punishment - a precondition for membership. But the fundamentalist overtones to the controversy over abortion are generally well
known. Given the enormous influence of the Catholic church in Poland, where public opinion on abortion is reportedly divided, it is not surprising that
the country's leadership has projected the issue in this manner ahead of the October general elections. The EU should strive to prevent any attempt to
dilute the current consensus against capital punishment by bringing in other issues over which no agreement may be possible. The episode underlines the
fact that progress on the complete elimination of capital punishment globally will depend on the effective observance of the rule of law and fostering
universal respect for human rights in general.

Staying the course in Afghanistan

M.K. Bhadrakumar

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The latest U.S. initiative on Afghanistan serves to legitimise NATO's maritime activities in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Following a three-hour meeting on September 23 in New York, India's foreign policy ship took a sharp curve. It headed in an unknown direction, no matter
the choppy waters. Inebriated with the T20 Cup victory in Durban and the gala &quot;Incredible India&quot; roadshow in the United States, most Indians did not take
notice but that should not detract from its profound, enduring significance.

On September 23, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon co-chaired a meeting with Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai to review six years of reconstruction
and &quot;good governance&quot; in the country. Participating were representatives from Britain, the United States, China, France, Russia, Canada, Germany, India,
Iran, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and Turkey. The Asian Development Bank, the European Union, the European Commission,
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, and the World Bank were also invited.

Mr. Ban later told the media that it was agreed at the meeting that &quot;there should be more efforts by [Mr.] Karzai and other leaders in promoting inclusive
political dialogue for national reconciliation.&quot; He added there was a &quot;strong desire&quot; among the participants that the U.N. should do more. Mr. Karzai amplified
that his government was working hard on peace talks to bring Taliban supporters &quot;back to the fold.&quot; The effort, he explained, was to bring back those Taliban
who are not part of the Al Qaeda. He claimed that identifying the &quot;good Taliban&quot; was easy. &quot;Deeds will tell, deeds do tell,&quot; he said.

&quot;We are already in contact . with those Taliban who are not part of Al Qaeda and terrorist networks, who are really in a majority . and we would like to
add to this process as the opportunity presents itself,&quot; Mr. Karzai added.

Speaking at the meeting, External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee chose to sail with the wind. He spoke of the need for &quot;a robust international solution
as well as a stronger internal military response&quot; in Afghanistan. But he acknowledged: &quot;At the same time, we sense that security challenges need to be
addressed realistically.&quot; He put on record India's deep concern at the security situation and cautioned, &quot;We cannot and must not underestimate the ferocity
of the Taliban and Al Qaeda resurgence. None of us can afford to improvise partial solutions that seemingly provide temporary relief. There is no option
to remaining resolute and determined.&quot; But Mr. Mukherjee sidestepped the core issue, namely, U.N.-mediated reconciliation talks with the Taliban as such.

That was not how India articulated its stance four months ago in Hamburg on the sidelines of the G-8 summit meeting. When Mr. Mukherjee spoke on May 29
in an exceptionally impassioned language, he outright rejected reconciliation with the Taliban. He concluded an unusually lengthy intervention by saying,
&quot;We cannot allow our enthusiasm to wane or improvise solutions by way of compromises - whether with the Taliban or with the others. We are dealing with
a globally and regionally interconnected alliance of terrorist groups. The Al Qaeda and the Taliban feed off each other, nourish and protect each other
and actively cooperate in carrying out attacks against their enemies . Appeasement will only embolden them and they will use every concession to undermine,
cripple and destroy the very base of the democratic and plural structure that the international community seeks to build there [Afghanistan].&quot;

What happened in the last four months? There are no easy answers. The Afghan situation shows that the Al Qaeda is a reinvigorated lot lately and is working
closely with the Taliban. Yet New Delhi has moderated its unequivocal opposition to engaging the &quot;good Taliban&quot;.

Washington is masterminding the process of reconciliation with the Taliban. The process is moving on different tracks. There is an intra-Pashtun inside
track bringing together tribal leaders on both sides of the Durand Line, aimed at reviving traditional modes of Pashtun life. There is a second track involving
Pashtun nationalist parties in Pakistan with Mr. Karzai, on one side, and pro-Taliban Islamic parties in Pakistan (principally the Deobandi party, JUI,
led by Maulana Fazlur Rahman) and the Pakistani authorities, on the other.

A clandestine track

Congratulations, General?

President Pervez Musharraf can take little comfort from winning a contentious election that was challenged at every step, whose result cannot be notified
until the Supreme Court decides if his candidacy was legal, and that has polarised Pakistan's polity. In the last six months, the entire energy of the
state was focussed on securing another five years for the General from a dying electoral college without him having to resign as army chief. Following
the botched att empt to sack the Chief Justice, General Musharraf had to go to extraordinary lengths to ensure for himself another term: sealing a dodgy
deal with one former Prime Minister-in exile, re-exiling another in the face of all democratic norms, and effecting a dubious last minute change in election
laws to favour himself. If, after all this, the Pakistan leader had not achieved his objective, it would have been a surprise. But this was a race in which
he was the only real contestant, and his supporters the only voters, with the opposition parties either resigning from the electoral college or abstaining
from the process. The judiciary gave President Musharraf a leg-up by looking away so that the election could be held but it has kept a sword dangling over
him by deciding to hear the petitions against him later this month.

Even so, barring the unlikely event of the Supreme Court ruling against him, General Musharraf is the new President of Pakistan. With his credibility already
eroded, the authority and stability of his new term will depend on the realignment of political forces in the coming months and the outcome of the general
election that must be held before January 15. President Musharraf's need for a larger and more credible political base led him to cut a deal with former
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. But the electoral fortunes of her Pakistan People's Party, which will determine its influence and role in the new dispensation,
could well turn out to be the proverbial double-edged sword for him. Continuing unrest in the polity, the seemingly unstoppable advance of extremism, and
a newly assertive media add to the uncertainty. Most important is his own standing with the Pakistan military once he carries out his promise to step down
as the army chief. As General Musharraf himself acknowledged in a recent interview, the new army chief will continue to play an important role in governance.
Managing contradictions may be a well-recognised part of politics but the challenge that President Musharraf faces is much bigger than that. On his ability
to accommodate these varying and conflicting interests hangs Pakistan's &quot;smooth transition to civilian democracy&quot; - and by extension its relations with
the world, including India.

Towards a new space age

It was 50 years ago that the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite. The beeping radio signals that emanated from the satellite
heralded the space age. Since then humans have journeyed into space and returned safely; satellites have helped study the earth, keep watch over the weather,
and broadcast TV programmes; probes have gone to other bodies in the solar system; and space-based telescopes have gazed at the far reaches of the cosmos.
Just 12 years after the launch of Sputnik, humans walked on the surface of the moon. Then the intense rivalry between the two superpowers - the United
States and the Soviet Union - that drove the space race disappeared and public interest in space waned. It is now 35 years since the last of the moon travellers
returned home. During this period, the launching of satellites and humans going out to live on the International Space Station for months at a time has
become an almost routine affair. Yet we could be on the threshold of a new and exciting age of space exploration and space travel.

In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the earth's natural satellite. Japan's first lunar probe Selene (nicknamed &quot;Kaguya&quot;) that was
launched last month has reached its orbit around the moon. China's Chang'e-1 spacecraft is likely to follow soon and India's Chandrayaan-1 is expected
to be launched in April 2008. All three countries have plans for further unmanned exploration of the moon. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) wants to retire the Space Shuttles by 2010 and concentrate on the development of a new space transportation system. It aims to have humans back
on the moon by 2020 and to begin the manned exploration of the Mars by 2037. Russia too is considering human flights to the moon and the Mars, and the
present indications are that China, Japan, and India are likely to despatch, in course of time, their own astronauts to the moon and perhaps beyond. A
new age of space exploration will surely see competition among space-faring nations. But if such exploration is to be sustained, as it must if humans are
to establish a foothold in alien and inhospitable environments, cooperation will be vital. The International Space Station has proved that it makes sense
to pool resources in an expensive venture. As a common goal, one needs to remember what Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the Russian school teacher who formulated
some of the basic principles of rocketry and came to be hailed as the 'father of space travel,' wrote in 1911: &quot;Earth is the cradle of humanity, but mankind
cannot stay in the cradle forever.&quot;

Merit? What's that? Class still rules Britain

Hasan Suroor

Figures show that social mobility in Britain has declined over the past decade and is behind other advanced nations.

British Conservative Party leader David Cameron has described Britain as a &quot;broken society&quot; blighted by a collapse of traditional family values; a growing
gun and drugs culture; a rise in anti-social behaviour among the young; &quot;uncontrolled&quot; immigration; and creaking public services - to mention just a few
things that, according to him, afflict Britain after 10 years of New Labour.

Given his own background (son of a stockbroker and educated at Eton and Oxford) what Mr. Cameron, unsurprisingly, failed to mention is Britain's continuing
class-divide. Actually, he could have made quite a thing out of it considering that the whole New Labour project was designed to move Britain away from
class and promote merit and social mobility. But then mentioning class would have exposed the class snobbery in his own party, and among its core supporters.

For all the talk of modernisation, the Tory mindset remains warped by class. Indeed, Mr. Cameron got himself into serious trouble with the Tory rank and
file recently when, in a bid to reposition it as a &quot;modern&quot; party, he opposed selection in schools and declared that under a Tory government there would
be no new grammar schools.

But what about Labour which came to power in 1997 promising to build a &quot;meritocratic&quot; society liberated from the stranglehold of the old-school-tie network
and the notorious &quot;postcode&quot; syndrome? In the new dawn that Tony Blair and company promised, merit was to replace considerations based on wealth and class.
In the summer of 2000, when a working class applicant, Laura Spence, failed to find a place at Oxford University despite good grades, Chancellor Gordon
Brown called it an &quot;absolute scandal&quot; sparking a nationwide debate on Oxbridge's elitism.

After 10 years of New Labour, however, class still rules, social mobility remains poor, and the rich-poor chasm is widening. Figures show that social mobility
in Britain has actually declined over the past decade and is behind other advanced nations. While the middle classes have benefited, the poorest sections
continue to struggle. And the &quot;post-code&quot; still matters as the following passage from the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Menzies Campbell's speech to his
party's conference in Brighton shows. He cited the example of two London neighbourhoods to highlight the social/class divide:

&quot;In London - the capital of one of the richest nations in the world - just six miles separate Hampstead from Hackney. But they might as well be in different
countries. If you live in Hackney, you are four times as likely to suffer from long-term unemployment as your neighbour in Hampstead. If you live in Hackney,
you are twice as likely to be permanently sick or disabled. And if you live in Hackney, you are four times as likely to have no qualifications at all.
Who'd have thought it, that after a decade of Labour government - a Labour government - the gap between rich and poor in this country would be wider than
it was when Labour came to office? Who'd have thought that after a decade of Labour government, social mobility would be in decline? After 10 years, these
are the facts: Fewer than one in five of the most disadvantaged children get five good GCSEs; less than one in five of the most disadvantaged children
go on to higher education; and in this country today, 1.2 million.&quot;

The area where the class divide is most visible is higher education which continues to be dominated by the middle and upper middle classes. Ironically,
this is also the one area where the government has genuinely worked hard to break down barriers even at the risk of being accused of &quot;social engineering.&quot;

There are two issues here: widening access to higher education, traditionally the preserve of the upper classes; and opening up the &quot;Ivy League&quot; institutions
such as Oxford and Cambridge universities to children from state schools and poorer backgrounds. On the first point, there has been some progress but it
is feared that the introduction, last year, of top-up tuition fee of up to £3,000 a year could slow things down with students from disadvantaged families
likely to be deterred by the cost of going to university, although so far there is no evidence to confirm this.

Experts have warned that irrespective of the fee factor, the number of students from the weaker groups going to university is set to fall sharply by

Slow but steady progress

The recent summit meeting between the Presidents of North and South Korea did not generate the excitement that the first such encounter did seven years
ago. However, in setting and attaining realistic goals, the two leaders have pushed the process of entente a little forward. With reunification still a
distant goal, Presidents Kim Jong-il and Roh Moo-hyun set for their states the more modest task of working for a peace agreement. Such a pact could provid
e a sturdier platform for durable peace than the armistice accord that has kept the conflict in the peninsula dormant for the past few decades. During
the summit, some headway was made towards conflict resolution with a maritime dispute being settled in an imaginative way. The two Korean states are to
cooperate in exploiting maritime resources in a disputed part of the Yellow Sea with each side allowing the other to use shipping lanes in the area without
hindrance. Seoul has also promised to speed up development of the Kaesong industrial complex, establish another special economic zone (SEZ) in the port
town of Haeju, and build a major highway as well as a track for goods trains. The SEZs are envisaged as the means by which North Korean labour and South
Korean capital can be married to optimal effect. Seoul also hopes that reunification will become all the more achievable as the SEZs help improve the economic
conditions of the people who live north of the 38th parallel.

While Pyongyang desperately needs foreign investment, it is determined to ensure that development in the economic field does not lead to major political
change. Even at the summit, North Korean leaders did not hide their displeasure when Mr. Roh described Kaesong as a symbol of &quot;reform and openness.&quot; The
South Koreans appear to be well aware that they cannot follow the lead of the United States in vigorously pressing their estranged cousins to carry out
'political reform.' If nothing else, Pyongyang too possesses the means to intervene in Seoul's internal affairs. Some analysts believe that Mr. Kim set
the timing of the summit to send a message to the South Koreans as they prepare for the presidential election, scheduled for December 2007. After rebuffing
Mr. Roh, who has repeatedly called for a meeting during his five-year term, the North Korean leader appears to have made an abrupt turnaround, with opinion
polls showing that the leader of the conservative Grand National Party Lee Myung-bak has a huge lead. While Mr. Lee is not opposed to entente, he takes
a harder line than Mr. Roh on political reform as well as security issues.

Using groundwater wisely

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recently told the first Congress on Groundwater organised by the Ministry of Water Resources that subsidised access to water
for economic and commercial purposes can no longer be sustained. The rising levels of water stress and deteriorating groundwater quality in many States
make this observation timely. When demand overtakes all sources of supply in three to four decades, the costs will be very high. The groundwater situation
is becoming cri tical. Groundwater meets half of all irrigation needs besides 85 per cent of rural and 50 per cent of urban water supply. But a quarter
of all blocks surveyed by the Central Ground Water Board are now classified as critical, semi-critical, or overexploited. Unsustainable groundwater extraction
coupled with profligate use by the affluent is causing distress in urban areas. Water sector reform has become an imperative but there is no agreement
on what will achieve optimal results. The expert group of the Planning Commission on groundwater headed by Dr. Kirit S. Parikh has pointed to the limited
value of regulation in curbing extraction in a country with millions of wells. A massive community-led programme to recharge groundwater and augment surface
storage may perform better.

Agriculture accounts for a major part of all water use and any savings achieved through higher efficiency can ease the pressure on groundwater, especially
in the peninsular States. Inefficient use in irrigation is partly blamed on the availability of free or highly subsidised power, a factor Dr. Singh and
the Planning Commission have taken note of. Any attempt to make changes to this politically sensitive scheme is bound to run into trouble and the benefits
to the groundwater table may be modest. Better results can be achieved by strengthening subsidies for efficient micro-irrigation techniques, with concurrent
support for rain harvesting and artificial recharge structures. In cities and towns, the value of mandatory rainwater harvesting to recharge groundwater
is tremendous - as is evident from the Chennai experience. As demand rises and supply comes under strain, the Centre, the States, and local bodies will
be under pressure to exercise their authority as public trustees of water to guarantee equity and accessibility. In fact, courts have pinpointed this responsibility
in cases involving groundwater and river basin pollution in Tamil Nadu and unbridled extraction for profit in Kerala. The task of evolving a framework
to meet the egalitarian objectives of the National Water Policy and the National Environment Policy must be taken up as a top priority.

The Muslim question in Gujarat

Vidya Subrahmaniam

By an unspoken consensus, Muslims have been excluded from the election debate in Gujarat.

Five years after Narendra Modi's stupendous victory in the Assembly election, Gujarat is set to go to the polls again - admittedly in entirely different
circumstances. Election 2002 was surcharged with sectarian emotion. The violence inherent in the Godhra aftermath extinguished all debate, forcing the
Congress, the principal opposition party, to conduct a low-key campaign that skirted the most obvious election issue: The sadism visited on Muslims.

In 2007, Mr. Modi gives the appearance of having moved on. Already in campaign mode, he avoids the past election's caustic references to Godhra, mullahs
and Mian Musharraf, focussing instead on the &quot;11 per cent growth&quot; Gujarat has achieved with him as helmsman. If he brings up the Ramar Sethu issue, it
is not with the intensity expected of him.

The 2007 election in Gujarat is what psephologists would call a &quot;normal&quot; election, unattended by passion, and without an overarching issue. Yet this normal
election seems no less contemptuous of a community that forms over nine per cent of the State's population. In 2002, the debate targeted Muslims. In 2007,
the debate has bypassed Muslims. The community has been kept out of the discourse by an unspoken consensus that includes Mr. Modi, the Congress and the
anti-Modi dissidents.

In an interview with The Hindu en route from Ahmedabad to Vadodara , Mr. Modi described Gujarat ki seva, seva, seva ( service, service and service of Gujarat)
as his single mission. The mission obsessed him, he said, adding proudly that under him Gujarat had become the &quot;number one State in Asia.&quot; Among his achievements
in five years: an almost four-fold increase in agricultural income from Rs.9,000 crore to Rs.34,000 crore; rise in cotton production from 23 lakh bales
to 1.23 crore bales and uninterrupted electricity supply to rural homes. As he spoke, it was apparent that he had programmes for every section - women,
adivasis, farmers and so forth.

Yet the Chief Minister was to turn hostile on the question of Muslims. Asked where Muslims figured in his vision of Gujarat, he flared up: &quot;I don't like
this thinking. I work for five-and-a-half crore Gujaratis. For me, anyone who lives here is a Gujarati, and I will not allow politics to come into this.&quot;

If only this were true. In Vadodara, Professor Ganesh Devy, literary critic, activist and director of the Tribal Academy at Tejgadh, took me on a tour of
Tandalja and Vasna Road, two parallel streets only six metres apart. The first was a mostly Muslim area, the second housed Hindus. The contrast wrenched
the heart. Mounds of rotting garbage, dark, damp, crowded homes, and desolate young men standing in groups made the Muslim part instantly recognisable.
The brightness of Vasna Road equally identified it as a Hindu area. The divide is as much physical as mental - and as much in Vadodara as in other Gujarat
cities. It is a symbol of complete, absolute Muslim isolation in a State that Mr. Modi claims is &quot;number one in Asia.&quot;

It is perhaps a consolation that unhygienic and wretched as their living conditions are, these Muslims at least live in their own homes. There are many
who don't. In October 2006, the National Commission for Minorities reported that over 5000 displaced Muslim families lived in &quot;sub-human conditions&quot; in
46 makeshift colonies spread across the riot-affected districts of Gujarat.

The NCM team, which visited 17 camps, accused the Gujarat Government of refusing to fulfil &quot;its constitutional responsibility.&quot; It also contradicted the
Chief Minister's claim that the families had opted to live there: &quot;In view of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the Commission finds this viewpoint
untenable and evasive of a government's basic responsibility.&quot; The team's findings brought help to the displaced families - but from the Central Government
which announced a compensation package.

However, to blame Mr. Modi alone for the social and political exclusion of Muslims would be to turn away from a truth that involves a much wider spectrum.
Holding centre-stage at the dissident-led farmers' rally in Rajkot was Gordhan Zadaphia, the Home Minister who stood by Mr. Modi during the 2002 pogrom.
A compact disc showing crucial details of his whereabouts at the time of the riots is currently before the Nanavati Commission of Enquiry.

Recently, Mr. Zadaphia told The Indian Express that while he accepted moral responsibility for the 2002 violence, that was not why he turned critical of
Mr. Modi. &quot;What happened in 2002 was different&quot;, he said,

Move on to elections

The imposition of President's Rule was as inevitable as night follows day - given the numbers in a hung Legislative Assembly elected in 2004 and the unravelling
of a second coalition arrangement based on nothing but political opportunism. By heeding advice from the Governor and others to hand in his resignation
without waiting to go through a confidence vote that was guaranteed to go against him, Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy spared the State further politica
l uncertainty and strife. His party, the Janata Dal (Secular), had burnt its bridges - first with the Congress in 2006 and 20 months later with the Bharatiya
Janata Party. Winning 58 seats in the 225-member Assembly (which includes a nominated Anglo-Indian member) in the 2004 election, it has been reduced by
political defections to an effective strength of 48. Neither the single largest party, the BJP, with its 79 legislators nor the Congress, with its strength
of 65, was in a position credibly to stake a claim for forming the next government. The Congress and the BJP concurred in demanding the dismissal of the
Kumaraswamy government but Governor Rameshwar Thakur, playing fair by the Constitution, held his hand.

The rules of constitutional conduct applicable to such situations have been clearly laid down by the Supreme Court of India in its historic March 1994 judgment
in the Bommai case. A vital rule is that, in the midst of conflicting political claims, a floor test in the Assembly (as opposed to a head count in the
Raj Bhavan) is the only legitimate way of ascertaining who has the majority. In its January 2006 judgment on the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly, the
Supreme Court held further that the apprehension of horse-trading cannot be the basis for invoking Article 356 of the Constitution and imposing President's
Rule. Had Mr. Kumaraswamy spurned the advice not to go for a pointless floor exercise on or around October 18, the political pressures on the Governor
would surely have intensified. Had the BJP made a serious attempt to form a government - as distinct from former Deputy Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa
falling into temptation by interrupting his State-wide campaign against 'betrayal' and entering into futile last-minute confabulations to get support from
JD(S) MLAs - constitutionalism would have required the Governor to exhaust that option of government-formation before the promulgation of President's Rule
and the dissolution of the Assembly. In either case, the Governor's impartiality and commitment to constitutionalism would have been put to a serious test.
Now that the fun and games are effectively over, going to the people for a fresh mandate is the only course available. The 356(1) proclamation will cease
to operate unless it is approved by both Houses of Parliament within two months. Meanwhile, the Assembly cannot be dissolved; it can only be kept in suspended
animation. What is clear is that the Karnataka situation does not warrant anything like a six-month period of President's Rule. The Election Commission
can be sounded out on the earliest feasible dates for Assembly elections. The Central government and the Governor must play scrupulously fair by the letter
and spirit of constitutional federalism. They must ensure a level playing field - and allow the people to decide as early as possible who should rule this
developmentally progressive State in the next round.

And the odds are.

Anyone familiar with old Hollywood gangster movies will remember those dimly lit, smoke-filled casinos swarming with gun-toting, cigar-chomping men flush
with the day's loot and set to gamble it all away. And when the money - and luck - ran out, they trotted off into darkness to prepare for another day.
Gangster movies may have gone out of fashion and modern-day casinos are less seedy than in the days of Buch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid but gambling is
t hriving. Welcome to Britain, which is witnessing a gambling boom - fuelled by liberal licensing laws and new technology. It has gone online and how.
There is new fangled touch-screen roulette accessible on 24,500 terminals across the country. According to The Guardian, video-roulette takes an estimated
£650 million a year - &quot;a sum almost matching the conventional casino industry's entire takings.&quot; It is also the single biggest source of loss for British
gamblers. The Gambling Commission has identified 250,000 Britons as &quot;problem gamblers&quot; - mostly those hooked on video-roulette.

A character in Mario Puzo's novel Fools Die says of another: &quot;He was a degenerate gambler.That is, a man who gambled simply to gamble and must lose.&quot; That
seems largely true of British gamblers judging from their astonishing propensity to lose. Experts estimate they lose more than £9 billion a year - an increase
of £2 billion since online gambling came into vogue in 1999. Gambling has long been a part of British social life - the original Gambling Act dates back
to 1845 - but it has moved on from the time a visit to the race course was the ultimate betting adventure. The new Gambling Act, which came into force
on September 1, allows the creation of more regional casinos and bigger slot machine payouts. Also, for the first time, gambling operators will be able
to advertise their wares on radio and television.

Behind the Hizb ul-Mujahideen's ceasefire

Praveen Swami

The head of Kashmir's numerically strongest terror group knows his organisation has its back to the wall.

In the crumpled photograph found on his bullet-ridden body, Sartaj Ahmad has his arm wrapped around the shoulder of a slender young woman: a woman, his
neighbours in the small south Kashmir village of Okay say, he hoped one day to marry. The assault rifle that Ahmad fired from at Indian troops in the minutes
before his death is draped over his right shoulder.

Hours after Hizb ul-Mujahideen battalion commander Ahmad and his bodyguard, Ashiq Husain Paddar, were shot dead near Kulgam, the Pakistan-based United Jihad
Council announced a unilateral ceasefire on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. In an October 8 statement, UJC chairman and Hizb ul-Mujahideen supreme commander
Mohammad Yusuf Shah commanded &quot;the mujahideen leadership and cadres engaged in armed confrontation to strictly comply [with] the directions with regard
to the unilateral decision to cease fire.&quot;

If the ceasefire holds - and if terror groups outside the UJC, like the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, are forced by Pakistan's military establishment
to join in in its implementation - Jammu and Kashmir will see three successive violence-free days, starting from October 12: the first violence-free Eid-ul-Fitr
in decades.

More important, though, the ceasefire could lead to the Hizb deciding to join a political dialogue on Jammu and Kashmir's future: an outcome that until
recently seemed inconceivable. Underpinning Shah's new peace bid is one stark fact: the slow, inexorable demise of what was once Jammu and Kashmir's most
feared terror group.

A dying jihad

Ever since Nisar Ahmad Bhat took charge of the Hizb ul-Mujahideen's Kashmir Valley operations in 2004, his message to his Rawalpindi-based organisation
has been simple: the terror group is comatose and its decline possibly terminal.

Operating under the code-name Ghazi Misbahuddin, Bhat was charged with rebuilding the Hizb after it lost a series of top operatives in 2003-2004. He discovered,
though, that the organisation no longer had the popular legitimacy or political influence that it needed to remain a credible force. Internecine feuding
had plagued the organisation since 2000-2001, when the Hizb first aborted a ceasefire announced by the pro-dialogue commander, Abdul Majid Dar, and then
arranged for his assassination. Bhat's strategy rested on shipping in trusted Hizb operatives from across the Line of Control to revive its dwindling fortunes.

For the most part, the strategy has failed. Hizb central Kashmir division commander Tajamul Islam Abdullah, for example, has been unable to mount a single
operation of consequence in over six months. Desperate to demonstrate success, he put in place plans for a series of bombings in and around Srinagar on
October 30, when pious Muslims across Kashmir were due to commemorate the historic battle between the forces of Prophet Mohammad and his opponents in the
tribe of Quraish at Badr.

However, Indian intelligence soon penetrated the cell tasked to execute the bombings. Shabbir Ahmad Ganai and Mehrajuddin Mir, both long-standing Hizb operatives
who had been despatched from Pakistan to help rebuild the organisation's central Kashmir networks, were arrested. A laboratory built by Mir to fabricate
electronic circuits for bombs was detected and shut down. Ganai had last served in Jammu and Kashmir in 1996-1997, while Mir had left for Pakistan in 2001.
Neither any longer commanded the kind of loyalty which could have helped the organisation grow.

Abdullah's failures, similarly, were linked to his lack of local political legitimacy. His family migrated from Srinagar to Karachi during the first India-Pakistan
war of 1947-1948, and although it retains ties of kinship and marriage within Srinagar, it has little direct relationship with the Islamist networks within
Jammu and Kashmir from which the Hizb draws its sustenance.

What influence Abdullah possesses among the Hizb cadre in Jammu and Kashmir draws on his connections in Rawalpindi, not Srinagar: his father, Malik Abdullah,
runs the Pakistan-based Hizb ul-Mujahideen radio station Sada-i-Hurriyat. Conflicts between local commanders and lieutenants of the Hizb's Rawalpindi command
have also been evident in southern Kashmir. In the wake of Mohammad Ashraf Shah's killing, his lieutenant-turned-rival Javed 'Seepan' Sheikh moved to pre-empt
the succession decision his Pakistan-based superiors would take.

He ruthlessly eliminated rivals in mafia-style hits, notably the Bijbehara-based Mohammad Jehangir

Interest rate dilemmas

The suggestion Finance Minister P. Chidambaram made recently at a joint meeting of bankers and top automobile industrialists - that the banks find ways
of raising funds at less cost and, consequentially, lower the interest rates -will have a far reaching impact. The automobile industry has done well recently,
aided to a large extent by liberal bank loans at low interest rates for buying trucks, passenger cars, and two-wheelers. Although banks, especially the
pu blic sector ones were known to be slow in dispensing retail loans, once they moved into the area, they started vying with one another in devising and
marketing attractive packages for buyers of cars and homes. Coincidentally, the interest rate cycle was down to its lowest levels a few years ago. During
2003-06, bank credit to industry increased by more than 30 per cent every year and it moderated only slightly the next year. For most banks the share of
retail loans went up from almost nothing to nearly 50 per cent. Inevitably in the rush to meet their targets, some banks ignored the prudential norms while
some others were lax with their documentation procedures. A consolidation phase was inevitable but it is the rise in interest rates rather than greater
prudence that has kept the number of eligible applicants at a reasonable level.

The strong growth of retail loans is a significant development but it is the bigger picture alluded to by the Finance Minister that is far more important.
The proliferation of these loans pushed up demand for the products of certain key industries such as automobile with abundant forward and backward linkages.
The rising interest rates rendered these loans expensive. This has moderated demand for several of the products including passenger cars. The prospect
of a slower manufacturing growth leading to a slackening in the overall GDP growth is what has been worrying the government. However, there are, as of
now, only the faintest signals of an economic slowdown. The Reserve Bank of India's GDP target for this year is 8.5 per cent and most others expect the
economy to grow at an even higher rate. More important, it is the RBI that influences the interest rate policy. For almost 18 months now, it has been signalling
higher interest rates to maintain price stability. Whether the RBI has modified its stance in favour of a softer interest rate regime will be known on
October 30 when it comes up with its review of the monetary policy. Even if the central bank does signal lower interest rates, it would be on account of
a number of factors, and a presumed slackening of demand in key industries will be just one of them.

Occupation's sleazy underbelly

Two recent incidents in which Iraqi civilians were killed by guards working for private security firms have brought into focus the problems created by outsourcing
governmental functions to contractors. On September 18, personnel hired by a company called Blackwater opened fire indiscriminately in a crowded Baghdad
square, killing 17 and wounding dozens. In another incident on October 9, more than 40 rounds were let loose at a car that did not stop at the first warning
and two women passengers were killed in the barrage. While troops of the United States Army and Marine Corps have caused the deaths of far larger numbers
of civilians, the actions by the private contractors have exposed a particularly vicious dimension of the occupation. Until recently, personnel working
for security companies were not subject to either the U.S. or the Iraqi law. Such a state of affairs created a culture of immunity that led the mercenaries
to believe they could get away with acts for which even uniformed troops would be accountable under military law. According to some reports in the media,
military law will henceforth cover private guards as well. However, as indicated by the two recent incidents, the firms seem to be in no mood to recast
the terms of engagement for their personnel. These operators know that they have the administration over a barrel. With the regular armed forces stretched
to the limit, there are not enough soldiers to provide day-to-day security to the officials of the state and other departments as they go about their business
of &quot;governing and reconstructing&quot; the occupied country. The number of personnel deployed in Iraq by private security firms is believed to run into tens
of thousands.

The lawless cruelty of the occupation aside, there is a sleazy side to this privatisation of security matters. In a recent editorial, The New York Times
provided an account of the windfall that has come Blackwater's way since the invasion. The firm, which received less than $1 million from the government
in 2001, now has about $1 billion in federal contracts. The higher echelons of the company are well known for their affiliation to the Republican Party
and its list of employees includes a number of people who worked previously for the Bush administration. Private contractors have been hired for all manner
of tasks, including the building of schools and the laying of sewerage and power lines. When governmental auditors visited sites where reconstruction work
had been 'completed,' they found the work to be substandard in many instances. Iraq might be on the fast track to ruin but the Blackwaters and the Halliburtons
are on their way to unbelievable prosperity.

A nuclear test and new realities

P.S. Suryanarayana

Washington is a wounded global power, whose preoccupations involving some West Asian countries have compelled it to play second fiddle to China as an advocate
of non-proliferation in regard to the DPRK.

One year after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) tested a nuclear weapon, China has emerged stronger as a guru of non-proliferation while
the United States has begun to lose its way in East Asia.

In a sense, the ripple effects of the DPRK's nuclear test go beyond the equation between the U.S. and China. Japan has begun to think on its own of strategic
affairs without antagonising its ally, the U.S., and there are new signs of greater ra pport between the DPRK and its southern ethnic neighbour, the Republic
of Korea (RoK).

These trends fly against the conventional U.S.-centred &quot;wisdom&quot; on matters of peace and stability in East Asia. A relevant question is whether the state
players in this region are more creative now in the strategic affairs domain than they were in the early years of the still-undefined post-Cold War period.
In a slightly different perspective, the poser relates to the net gains and losses of the DPRK, whose testing of an atomic weapon on October 9, 2006, set
off a paradigm shift in the power balances in East Asia.

About a week before the first anniversary of the detonation, China announced, in its capacity as Chair of the Six-Party Talks, that &quot;the DPRK agreed to
disable all [its] existing nuclear facilities, subject to [their] abandonment.&quot; The timeline for the &quot;disablement&quot; is the end of this year, and Pyongyang
further &quot;agreed to provide,&quot; by the same date, &quot;a complete and correct declaration of all its nuclear programmes.&quot;

The six parties, engaged in negotiating and ensuring the de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, are: China, the U.S., the DPRK, RoK, Japan, and Russia.
Surely, the peninsula is not the only East Asian arena where a potential flare-up is considered possible but the DPRK's nuclear test had pushed this theatre
to the forefront in this regard. Yet the mood right now on the Korean peninsula is upbeat indeed.

Pyongyang's latest commitments are not dramatically new, except for the firm timelines that it has now openly agreed to. The sequential ideas of &quot;disablement&quot;
and &quot;abandonment&quot; or &quot;dismantlement,&quot; and the parallel notion of &quot;declaration,&quot; were on the drawing board even when Pyongyang agreed to shut down its Yongbyon
complex. And, prior to China's latest announcement, Pyongyang did honour its pledge, made a few months ago, to shut down the complex suspected to be the
nerve centre of a nuclear weapons programme.

From a long-term perspective, the key issue in this sub-context about the post-test pattern of behaviour by the DPRK is not really its recent track record
of agreeing to, and even honouring, some aspects of de-nuclearisation. The relevant questions, simply, centre on Pyongyang's strategic retreat, or more
precisely compulsions, that can be traced to a variety of external pressures to de-nuclearise. For Pyongyang, the post-test choices have emanated from
two sources - its own strategic calculations and equally, or even more importantly, the external pressures.

These pressures have come from not only the U.S., a pivotal &quot;force for stability&quot; on the Korean peninsula, but also from neighbouring China, which, as a
rising great power, exudes passion for non-proliferation. More importantly, the DPRK's status as a nuclear-armed state can complicate the security environment
for Beijing too, despite its strong ideological links with Pyongyang since the 1950-53 Korean War. Authoritative Chinese sources told this correspondent
that the DPRK did not listen to Beijing's counsel against treading the nuclear arms path. However, China regained the initiative after Pyongyang crossed
the nuclear Rubicon; and the result is reflected in Beijing's latest announcements about the DPRK's de-nuclearisation pledges.

Among Pyongyang's other neighbours, RoK cannot easily accept an ethnically-akin country as a nuclear-armed &quot;enemy,&quot; given the current convergence of their
interests for a potentially common political future. For Japan, critical indeed are the inter-related issues of the DPRK's growing missile-delivery capabilities
and its continuing hold over a nuclear arsenal, however small it might be. Highly emotive history, involving Japan as a yesteryear imperial power, on the
one side, and the two Koreas as also China, on the other, is a political aspect that Tokyo has not yet sorted

Political folly and correction

Saying 'mea culpa' does not come easily to politicians. It took some courage for British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to admit in front of hundreds of television
cameras that he took &quot;final responsibility&quot; for the political tamasha over his government's botched plans for a snap election in November 2007. Following
weeks of intense speculation, stoked by his Ministers and close advisers and his own sudden visit to Iraq where he announced troop c uts, Mr. Brown broke
his silence and ruled out an early election - after a slew of opinion polls and private polling by the Labour Party indicated a dramatic slump in its lead
over the Conservatives. For the first time since Mr. Brown moved into Downing Street in June, the Tories were ahead of Labour in the opinion polls - actually
by up to six percentage points after announcing populist measures designed to appeal to floating middle-class voters. This meant Labour would struggle
to retain its slim 60-odd majority in the House of Commons. The worst scenario was a hung Parliament. Mr. Brown of course insisted that the negative polls
had no bearing on his decision. Labour, he claimed, would have won &quot;whether we had it [an election] today, next week or weeks later.&quot; He had decided against
an early election only because he wanted to concentrate on implementing his &quot;vision&quot; for the country. Aside from inviting ridicule from opponents and flak
from political commentators, he was blamed within his party for damaging Labour's political stock.

The pressure on the Prime Minister was piled even higher when Chancellor Alistair Darling published the government's pre-budget report, a half-year update
on spending plans and the economic state of the country. Plans to raise the threshold for inheritance tax prompted accusations that the Labour government
had 'stolen' ideas from the Conservative Party while economists accused the government of failing to be realistic about the spending cuts that would be
necessary, given the downturn in the economy. The government has cut its growth forecasts for the economy in the wake of the global credit crunch, but
some fear they are underestimating the impact it will have, so that they can continue to justify high levels of government spending. 10 Downing evidently
expects these populist measures, independent of their authorship, to help neutralise the swing against Labour and put it back in the driving seat. The
next British general election is not due till 2009-2010. Mr. Brown now has abundant time to focus on his vision, whatever that turns out to be. What his
big misstep spotlighted, aside from his own fallibility and overcautiousness, was the changeability of the popular mood in Britain and the fragility of
party leads in the polls.

Correcting imbalances

Inaugurating a national conference of Vice Chancellors, Union Human Resources Minister Arjun Singh identified higher education as the &quot;sick child&quot; of education
and indicted it for ceasing to serve the cause of youth. The question naturally arises: if higher education is the &quot;sick child,&quot; what can be said of school
education, which is shamefully neglected in vast parts of India, above all its rural areas? But that question aside, there appears to be no dearth of institutions
of higher learning and loads of talent among the country's burgeoning student population. So what is the malady? The Minister has asked the Vice Chancellors
to come up with a road map for higher education that balances the pursuit of excellence and quality with inclusiveness and access for all sections of society.
This is the principal challenge before Indian universities as they prepare themselves for prospective competition from foreign universities that may soon
be allowed to set up campuses in India, with some &quot;safeguards&quot; the Vice Chancellors want for protecting Indian universities &quot;from unwarranted competition,&quot;
whatever that might mean.

In this context, it just won't do to take a dismissive attitude towards the Indian Institute of Science and the Indian Institutes of Technology as 'elitist.'
They are world class success stories in the field of higher learning and research, even if the numbers they enrol every year are quite small and their
inclusiveness could be improved. Their exemplary academic practices and systems must be learnt from and, where appropriate, introduced in the wider field
of university education. With high economic growth rates and healthy increase in tax revenues, funding should not be a problem - if there is political
will. The phenomenon of uneven regional growth in professional education needs to be addressed. The southern States and, of course, Maharashtra have stolen
a march over the rest of India when it comes to the number of professional colleges, the opening of new universities, encouragement to autonomous institutions,
and the adoption of the semester system. Elsewhere, especially in Hindi-speaking India, the growth seen in metropolitan centres has not percolated to rural
areas. The other side of the coin is that where professional education has proliferated, other fields of higher learning, above all the basic sciences
starting with mathematics, have suffered. The UGC and the universities must work imaginatively to correct the balance in favour of the basic sciences and
also ensure that the quality of education in the social sciences and humanities is raised appreciably.

'Incredible India' right here at home

P. Sainath

The week-long 'Incredible India' campaign in New York aimed at boosting the vibrant image of an emerging, powerful India at 60 and showcasing its diversity.
But the real action was at home.

Those focussed on the $10 million event in New York are missing out on the real thing. The bharatiya khana, sangeet and natak unleashed on the Big Apple
are not a patch on the carnival at home. 'Incredible India' is happening right here. It came fully alive two weeks ago with the Congress government of
Andhra Pradesh declaring that rice would be sold to the poor at Rs.2 a kilo. It also announced a doubling of widow pensions from Rs.500 to Rs. 1000. And
the same for State-level pensions of freedom fighters. Soon after, it pledged that it would not raise power charges for the next five years. Along with
these came a slew of other pro-poor announcements. Some, if not all the measures, were things any government ought to have done long ago.

The rice at Rs.2 a kilo annoyed the opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP). After all, its founder, N.T. Rama Rao (NTR), was the true author of the scheme.
But the TDP leaders had to be cautious about describing this as 'stealing our clothes.' For, their own government had shed those clothes with alacrity
in the post-NTR era. So, instead, they announced 'nine hours of free power daily for farmers' - the very first policy the Congress signed into effect on
taking power in 2004.

The TDP also promised farmers loans at four per cent interest. Not to be left out, the &quot;Loksatta,&quot; a movement that decries the populist stunts of other
parties and which sees itself as cleaning up politics, showed itself as a force with a difference. A one-hour difference. It offered eight hours of free
power as against the more lavish nine hours of the TDP. And, of course, rice at Rs.2 a kilo. The Telangana Rashtriya Samiti closed the bidding at 12 hours
of free power for farmers. The TDP topped it off with the promise of three cents of land for poor urban families to build homes.

India is never more incredible than when polls are on or around the corner. And politics is never more focussed on real issues either. At that point, the
blah of software superstardom or nuclear nirvana is simply buried. Unlike newspaper editors and channel anchors, most politicians know who votes. To messily
paraphrase Samuel Johnson, nothing concentrates the human mind more than the knowledge that its owner is to be hanged in a fortnight. Elections appear
to produce that result in Incredible India.

To gain a sense of just how incredible India gets, look at the latest on the National Rural Employment Guarantee programme. This is the single most vital
action of the UPA government thus far. Never mind that it embraced the programme kicking and screaming in protest. Or that it badly under funded it. Never
mind that a hundred days of work for only one person per household was much less than needed. Never mind, too, that earlier this year the number of districts
under the scheme was doubled, but the funds were not.

Suddenly, it is to cover all districts of the country. The media say this happened because the request came from Rahul Gandhi. Well, good for him. Maybe,
he can even get the government to fund it better. And extend it to all seeking work, while raising the number of work days. What's incredible, though,
is the instant conversion of the Prime Minister and his Finance Minister to avid fans of a programme they cared little for and adopted under duress from
their allies.

No less impressive is the sudden hike in the minimum support price for wheat, rice and other crops. Till this moment, the government was happy to import
wheat from Australia at far higher prices than it was willing to give our own farmers. No amount of distress could move Delhi's hearts of stone. But elections
can. There is now a rise of Rs.250 per quintal in the MSP for wheat, overnight. Of course, this does not set things right. And the hike of Rs.50 per quintal
of paddy comes towards the end of the procurement season. But it is a sign of events to follow.

In Maharashtra, Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh's heart has begun bleeding for Mumbai's displaced mill workers. Mr. Deshmukh is appalled to find that mill
owners have not been honouring their commitments. (Gee, who would ever have suspected them of that?) And that workers are not getting the housing they
were promised. This is not right, says the saddened Chief Minister, to a public that has known all of

Political crisis defused

Positive statements made by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in interactions at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit against
early elections and in favour of reconciling divergent standpoints in a coalition arrangement and viewing differences on a particular issue in a wider
political perspective are a clear signal that the political crisis that set in around the second week of August 2007 has been defused. As the whole world
knows, the crisis expressed seemingly irreconcilable discord between a minority Congress-led government and the supporting Left parties over the 123 agreement
for civilian nuclear cooperation with the United States. Asserting that &quot;elections are still far away&quot; and that his government expected to complete its
full term (in mid-2009), the Prime Minister did well to clarify that while he would be disappointed if the deal fell through, &quot;one has to live with certain
disappointments and move on.&quot; He also struck a healthy political note by recognising that &quot;we are not a one-issue government&quot; and, further, that &quot;in politics,
we must survive short-term battles to address long-term concerns.&quot; In endorsing the Prime Minister's constructive remarks, Sonia Gandhi went a step further
by reiterating her party's determination to ensure that the United Progressive Alliance government would go on to implement its programmes &quot;till 2009&quot;
- a political objective that could be achieved only by practising &quot;the dharma of coalition ... [which is] to work together, try and understand and accommodate
each other's view.&quot; The sagacious decision to end the standoff was clearly hers.

Earlier, the UPA government, which had set itself a timeline that would lead to the full operationalisation of the deal in early 2008, insisted on going
forward come what may. The 61-member Left bloc led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) made it plain that it would not allow the 123 deal to go forward;
it would withdraw support to the government if it went ahead even with the first step of operationalisation by entering into negotiations with the International
Atomic Energy Agency for a safeguards agreement. Three factors have helped end the standoff. The first was direct political talks held by CPI (M) general
secretary Prakash Karat and his senior party colleagues with Pranab Mukherjee and Sonia Gandhi, in which larger political questions and common interests
were centre-staged and the discord over the nuclear issue was sought to be put in its place. The second factor was growing pressure from key UPA allies
who are against a premature general election. The Congress president evidently shares their perception. The third factor has been the talking mechanism
- the UPA-Left committee on the nuclear deal and related matters - which was perceived to be an arrangement to buy time, if only short time. This underestimated
mechanism, it seems, has been serving its larger political purpose well. Now that the standoff is over and the government appears to have realised that
nuclear deal or not it has a lot more to contribute to governance and development, no effort should be spared to build on this positive outcome.

Elections but new themes

The context in Gujarat in 2007 is certainly different from that of 2002 and Chief Minister Narendra Modi is doing his best to shift the emphasis from his
earlier image as a Hindutva icon to one as an earnest economic reformer. As the State prepares for the general election to the Assembly in December, the
polarising issues of the Godhra carnage and the anti-Muslim pogrom that dominated the 2002 poll campaign have receded to the background. Sensing that anti-Muslim
rhetoric cannot win two elections in a row, Mr. Modi is now talking of a &quot;vibrant Gujarat&quot; with the focus firmly on infrastructure and investment. The
strong man demands that he be judged only on the basis of his performance in the last five years and his promises for the next five. Yet there is no mistaking
that beneath the slogans stressing development is a reliance on the Hindutva card. Mr. Modi is no longer as popular as he was in 2002 with the Rashtriya
Swayamsevak Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Although it is unlikely that these outfits will take their anti-Modi campaign to a pitch where the Congress
will be the real beneficiary, the Chief Minister knows that a Hindutva plank without their support will fall apart. To add to his problems, the dissident
camp in the BJP led by former Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel is getting better organised and more strident.

The two-phase polling in the State will present a real challenge to the Election Commission. About 5,000 internally displaced persons, victims of the anti-Muslim
pogrom of 2002, live in dispersed camps. Notwithstanding the shift in the BJP's electoral strategy, Muslims in Gujarat remain traumatised by the riots
and their aftermath. The ECI has promised to provide photo identity cards to all the displaced persons and to enable them, and other members of the minority
community, to vote without fear. It is imperative that elaborate security arrangements, similar to those in 2002, are put in place. In this context, the
decision to keep out of election duty those officials who have cases registered against them or have been indicted by courts or have acted unfairly in
the last election is a salutary precaution.

The ways of the Canadian bureaucracy

Ramesh Thakur

The goal of rules framed and administered by civil servants should be to facilitate and enable agreed tasks. But too many take it as their mission to frustrate
and obstruct.

Returning to Canada after three decades has been instructive. After nine years in Tokyo in a high-pressure job, life in the heart of Ontario's Mennonite
farming community is a pleasure and a joy. Greener pastures indeed.

The smugness of many Canadians - who have much to be smug about - may be due to using their great and powerful neighbour as the benchmark for evaluating
themselves. In some respects, Canada may be better than the equivalent on offer south of the border yet not compare favourably to the prevailing situation
in Europe or Asia. For example, the ubiquitous automated, computer voice telephone answering here is the worst I have encountered anywhere in the world:
the U.S., Europe, Australasia, India and other developing countries. It is profoundly alienating.

The one recurring irritant is a bureaucratic culture that may surpass even the famed Japanese. Trying to re-establish Canadian identity has proven interesting:
the vast maw of bureaucracy has a difficulty for every solution. The courtesy and helpfulness of the people one deals with may ease but does not eliminate
the frustrations of the rigid regulations.

With three current driver's licences and an expired but intact Ontario licence (plus expired ones from India and Fiji), not to mention four decades of unblemished
driving record (okay, one speeding and parking ticket each), an Ontario licence should be routine, right?

Wrong. We don't have reciprocal exchange agreements with Australia and New Zealand. So licences issued by their competent authorities do not actually prove
driving ability. The expired Ontario licence has, well, expired. We do have a mutual recognition agreement with Japan. As the Japanese licence is not in
English, could I please have an official statement from the consulate in Toronto certifying that the document is what I claim?

At this point I asked if it would be simpler to go through the process of being tested and getting a fresh licence. Possible, yes. Simpler, no. I would
be treated like novice 16-19 year-old learner-drivers, the process would take up to a year, including several months with a learner's permit, and the insurance
premiums would be correspondingly higher by several factor-fold.

Phone the Japanese consulate. No problem. Please come in person, present your Japanese licence, pay the necessary administrative fee, and collect the official
statement.

Back I go to the driver's licence office, armed with all the documents, and this time, after a vision test, success and an Ontario licence once again -
the very same number I had three decades ago. I had not the heart to inform them that the Japanese licence was issued on the strength of my Australian.

To add to the absurdity, I could not buy a car without an Ontario licence. In the meantime I was driving - a rental car. I wonder how generously the rental
car companies donate to the ruling party.

The health card proved trickier. There is a Catch-22 conundrum: once you have one official document, getting others is easier. But not too easy. It brought
to mind the law that when two vehicles come simultaneously to an intersection, both shall stop, and neither shall proceed until the other has passed. A
contribution to slowing global warming perhaps, but not to efficient flow of traffic.

The health card does not take effect until three months after taking up residence in Ontario. Because I arrived at the Toronto airport as a Canadian citizen,
the passport was not stamped. How then to prove date of arrival? Would copes of airline ticket and boarding pass do? No, originals are required. (Requiring
original documents, masses of them, instead of copies, seems to be a particular Canadian fetish.) Of course, people paying for them insist on taking the
original tickets when the journey is completed. Fortunately, I was able to &quot;borrow&quot; it back for this purpose.

That still does not establish residence in Ontario. I offered agreement to purchase a house along with deposit, dated January. Sorry: that was before arrival
in March. The purchase being completed after arrival was not relevant. I was reminded of the law governing payment of pensions in Kolkata when I lived
there. If there is a break in collection, the pensioner must supply a medical certificate testifying that he is alive and well; his physical presence in
the office

Richly deserved

Of all those who won Nobel Peace Prize over more than a century, few have been more worthy of the honour than Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change. Together they brought the force of solid scientific enquiry and ardent advocacy to drag to the forefront of global consciousness an issue
that the politics of denial did its best to obscure. In some ways, the Panel had the harder task. This network of nearly 3000 scientists drawn from many
countries had to meticulously study the evidence - even as affirmers and deniers of global warming waged a furious debate in which selective science was
too often used to bolster arguments. After close to two decades of work, the Panel concluded, with qualifications that speak to extreme scientific caution,
that the rate of consumption of the earth's resources by the human race is posing a threat to the sustainability of life on the planet. In that sense,
it weighed in on the side of environmentalists, the politically weaker party in the debate. Even so, the global energy industry, along with its patrons
and affiliates, has finally come around to accepting this verdict. However, the efforts of the scientists might not have made the world wake up to the
perils of global warming if a protagonist with a powerful voice had not stepped forward to convey the message. With his name-recognition and political
skills, Mr. Gore fitted the bill admirably.

The former Vice President of the United States had to reinvent himself to become nature's oracle. While it was the U.S. Supreme Court that finally extinguished
the prospects of a Gore presidency in 2000, the Democratic candidate had only himself to blame for a verdict so close that it lent itself to what happened.
He had put off potential supporters by coming across as a candidate overly programmed by pollsters. In the years since, the 'Goracle' has discovered his
inner voice and turned into a passionate advocate of the causes he believes in. In 2003, he courageously struck out on his own to oppose the invasion of
Iraq. It was this go-it-alone spirit that gave the world An Inconvenient Truth, the splendid Academy Award winning documentary on climate change. It is
difficult to imagine another American politician putting himself at such risk of being regarded as an eccentric by highlighting an issue that the general
public did not seem to be very concerned about. Now that the man and the cause are on centre stage, the drumbeats for a Gore candidacy in 2008 have begun
to sound. Would it be better to make another try for the power to make a direct difference - or stay above the fray and provide moral leadership? That
is the question before the man who had the presidency stolen from him seven years ago.

Challenge of Islamist terror

Investigative leads point to the Harkat ul-Jihadi-e-Islami (HUJI), the Islamist organisation behind the Mecca Masjid attack in Hyderabad, as being behind
the terrorist strike at the Dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer. What can one say about an outfit so consumed by hatred as to deliver death to
the shrine of a saint who preached the oneness of god's creation? The Ajmer bombing is the latest in a series of terror strikes directed at both Hindu
and Muslim reli gious institutions. Investigators have been able to establish that many of these attacks were carried out by Islamist terror groups such
as the Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Jaish-e-Mohammad, and the HUJI. Manifestos available on websites affiliated to these organisations, conversations in Islamist
internet chat rooms, and published pamphlets make clear that these organisations despise Hindus, Christians, Jews, and atheists - but hate even more the
syncretic popular Islam followed by the overwhelming majority of Muslims. Islamist terror groups have attacked Muslim shrines not just in India, but also
in Pakistan and Afghanistan in an attempt to stamp out a form of Islam they proclaim is a heresy. The larger ideological-political project is to deepen
communal fault-lines and precipitate an apocalyptic war which their perpetrators imagine will usher in a new millennium. The calm and fortitude demonstrated
by the people of India in response mean the defeat of the terrorists' project.

The Hindu has editorially advocated the need for public institutions, including places of worship, to invest in modern security systems. There were closed
circuit cameras at Ajmer Sharif; only, they had been out of order for two weeks. Nor has the shrine management chosen to fund arrangements to frisk pilgrims
or scan their belongings for explosives. But the problem goes beyond Ajmer. India's Intelligence Bureau is among the smallest domestic counter-terrorism
services of any major country, with only half its estimated 20,000 personnel committed to covert duties. The Research and Analysis Wing lacks adequate
resources. Most State police intelligence services remain dumping grounds for out-of-favour officers. Most important of all, politicians must strengthen
India's greatest defence against the extremist project - its centuries-old traditions of religious tolerance - by opposing all forms of chauvinism and
communalism. Eight centuries ago, Khwaja Chishti did just that - and his order today commands a following that cuts across religious and caste affiliations.
Leaders searching for means to combat the fundamentalist onslaught could do worse than leaf through his books.

The Myanmar crisis and the U.N. way

P.S. Suryanarayana

With China and Russia continuing to rein the U.S. in, the Security Council has now moved away from its January posture of no collective action and towards
a politically non-prescriptive stand on the Myanmar issue.

Myanmar's ruling junta has finally failed in its bid to fly under the radar of the United Nations and avoid being held accountable for crushing a popular
uprising by Buddhist monks, students, pro-democracy activists, and others.

U.N. Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari will, on Monday, begin a new round of diplomatic efforts to persuade or pressure Myanmar's military regime to move towards
&quot;an inclusive national reconciliation.&quot; Significantly, the &quot;direct support of the U.N.&quot; is on offer to help the junta, styled the State Peace and Development
Council (SPDC), &quot;achieve&quot; such reconciliation.

New series of talks

Towards this end, Mr. Gambari will now begin a series of talks with the leaders of key states in Myanmar's extended neighbourhood - Thailand, Malaysia,
Indonesia, India, China, and Japan.

In the earlier phase of diplomacy in this regard in late September and early October, Mr. Gambari met SPDC Chairman Than Shwe and Myanmar's celebrated democracy
campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi. On that occasion, the U.N. Special Envoy held talks with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as well. Singapore chairs
the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes Myanmar.

As of now, the SPDC's bid to evade international censure was facilitated, for some time at least, by the differences among key members of the U.N. Security
Council on its own role to set right the affairs of a sovereign state. Complicating this political issue, despite its humanitarian dimension, was the argument
that the current Myanmar crisis did not pose a threat to peace and stability in that country's neighbourhood and the wider global arena.

China and Russia, both permanent members, took this line. The U.S., Britain, and France - the other permanent members with similar veto powers - wanted
to condemn the SPDC for its latest crackdown on pro-democracy activists and demanded the immediate release of all political prisoners. In the event, the
Security Council issued a presidential statement, &quot;strongly deploring&quot; the recent use of &quot;violence&quot; by the SPDC against &quot;peaceful protesters.&quot; It was also
emphasised that the SPDC should recognise the &quot;importance of releasing all political prisoners and remaining detainees&quot; in connection with the latest protest
marches by Buddhist monks and others.

A relevant question is whether the SPDC has got yet another reprieve at the hands of the Security Council. In January, Russia and China vetoed a move by
the U.S. and its allies to censure the SPDC. A subterranean political issue accounted for those vetoes - the first double veto on any matter since the
end of the Cold War over 15 years ago. China and Russia suspected that the U.S., in the name of resolving the Myanmar issue, sought big-power consensus
on Western-style democracy as the norm for internal governance of the U.N. member-states. These suspicions, by no means dissipated, have influenced the
discussions in the Security Council this time as well.

Non-ideological intervention

However, the gravity of the present situation, marked by the deaths of monks and others at the hands of the SPDC's soldiers and police, has resulted in
a non-ideological intervention by the Security Council. With China and Russia continuing to rein the U.S. in, the Council has now moved away from its January
posture of no collective action and towards a politically non-prescriptive stand on the Myanmar issue. In advocating a &quot;genuine dialogue&quot; between the SPDC,
on one side, and Ms. Suu Kyi as also &quot;all concerned parties and ethnic groups,&quot; on the other, the Council does not call for anything more prescriptive
than the generic norm of a &quot;peaceful solution.&quot;

It is true that the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, has described the SPDC's recent action against
the unarmed protesters as &quot;a brutal crackdown.&quot;

However, the Council's latest collective position has been shaped by not only China and Russia, at one level, but also the ASEAN, a special invitee, at
the other. After expressing a sense of &quot;revulsion&quot; at the SPDC's &quot;reported&quot; behaviour this time, the ASEAN gradually started advocating that Myanmar's
military establishment must be part of the solution to the current
