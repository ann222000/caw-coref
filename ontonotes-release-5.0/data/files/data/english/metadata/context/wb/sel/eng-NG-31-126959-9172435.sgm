Should the buyer get rated first?  Is he extorting me?  Am I justified
in being angry?  If I only buy, and never sell, do I care if he rates
me negatively, vindictively?

Details: Seller won't give feedback until buyer does.  Unethical?

The two situations are different, but for the second time I have
bought from a seller who, it seems clear, won't give feedback until I
do.

In both cases, I paid within an hour of buying, so since afaik, my
only responsibility is to pay, I deserve positive feedback.

In this second case.  I'm leaving on a trip at the end of this week
and learned at the last minute that I might be able to get a
short-term job on this trip, and for that I needed to buy a laptop.

Before I bid, I emailed the seller asking if he could ship the day
after the auction ended (at 7PM his time, last Wednesday). I said I
would pay by 9 or at the latest by midnight.  He wrote back that if I
paid by 9, he'd ship the next day, and I woudl get it by Monday.

I won and paid by 8PM and included a note in the PayPal payment
reminding him that he said he could ship the next day.

Later I thought I should send a separate email and did so around 1 in
the morning (We're both in the US. He's one time zone to the west of
me.)

I got an email the next day that he was at work and didn't ship it but
would the next day (Friday.) and he thought I would still get it by
Monday.   Later that day I got the tracking number and it is scheduled
to arrive on Wednesday!  It's UPS and I know it won't arrive before
the scheduled time, right?  I also got an email from the seller that
said the following, (I've erased the details after the colons.)   The
whole thing seems to me looks like a form letter, a computer generated
letter, where every one gets the same letter:

--Quote--
I have shipped the following item to you. You should be receiving it
shortly.

Item title:
Web Address:
Item number:
Buyer User ID:
Seller User ID:
Total: $100 plus dollars

Once your item arrives in satisfactory condition, please leave
feedback for me. I will do the same for you.

Thank you again!
--end quote--

This bothers me:
&quot;Once your item arrives in satisfactory condition, please leave
feedback for me. I will do the same for you.&quot;

This means he won't give positive feedback for me, unless and until I
give him positive feedback, right?

I don't know how bad it is that his shipping is running two days late,
after I specifically asked him about it. Does this seem very bad to
you all? And I don't want to ruin his very high positives 99.8% on
2500 sales.  At first I was willing to give him no feedback but still
wanted positive feedback from him (since I'm in the 20 to 30 purchase
range, with no sales by me), but the more I think about it, the more I
think the reason his positive percentage is so high is that he extorts
positive ratings, or at least suppresses negative ones.

I haven't gotten the laptop yet, and I can't test the wifi for a week
or more after that.

Plus I don't have time to test the printer port etc. though little
things liek that will probably work.

Should the buyer get rated first?  Is he extorting me?  Am I justified
in being angry?  If I only buy, and never sell, do I care if he rates
me negatively, vindictively?

If you are inclined to email me
for some reason, remove NOPSAM  :-)

The debate over who is responsible to leave FB first is an ongoing
discussion in this group. You will find many on both sides of the
fence with logical responses why one or the other should leave the
first FB. The only correct answer to this question is neither party is
responsible to leave FB first as FB is optional and not required.

mm &lt;NOPSAMmm2 ... @bigfoot.com&gt; may have trolled us with:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Should the buyer get rated first?
">

There is no &quot;should&quot;.

However, buyers make eBay transactions happen, and to the
extent that buyers care who posts FB first, they want the
seller to post first.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Is he extorting me?
">

Only if he's demanding something beyond the otherwise
agreed deal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Am I justified in being angry?
">

You're never justified about anything.
Focus on the money, the item, and learning.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Seller won't give feedback until buyer does.
">

All too common.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Unethical?
">

No, if we define ethics as rules of behavior explicitly
agreed to. The eBay User Agreement, and by extension the
Policies, have content on what FB may consist of, and
that FB extortion is prohibited, but posting FB is
completely optional, and eBay is silent on who goes first.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ... from a seller who, it seems clear, won't give
&gt; feedback until I do.
">

It's clear now, and it could have been clear before you bid.

You look for a seller's FB policy in:
a. the listing terms
b. the AboutMe/MyWorld page
c. comparing timestamps on FB received/given
d. or just ask them - the answer,
or lack thereof, can be telling

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; only responsibility is to pay, ...
">

Not so. See footnote here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I deserve positive feedback.
">

There is no &quot;deserve&quot;.
And FB before the deal is completed is foolish.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ... and for that I needed to buy a laptop.
">

Oh dear, this really is a troll.
It's insane to buy a laptop on eBay unless you
massively vet the seller, something which clearly
did not happen here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Later that day I got the tracking number and it is
&gt; scheduled to arrive on Wednesday!
">

And you don't actually have the laptop yet.
Why am I not surprised.
I wonder what will actually be in the box.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Once your item arrives in satisfactory condition,
&gt; please leave feedback for me. I will do the same
&gt; for you.
">

This is an incompetent seller.

a. Seller-first-on-acceptance is the most rational policy.
Buyer-first drives away buyers.

b. NEVER mention FB in communications between buyer and
seller. It is far too easy for it to be construed and
reported as extortion, even when it isn't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This means he won't give positive feedback for me,
&gt; unless and until I give him positive feedback, right?
">

Yes, that welt on the side of your head is from a cluestick.

If I were you, I'd be more concerned with what's in the
UPS shipment. You did make this buy through PayPal using
credit card funding, I trust.

If it arrives as advertised and in satisfactory condition,
report that to the seller (via email or Messaging).
Do not post any FB. Say nothing about FB.
If they never post FB, then you never do either.

If you're more interested in buying FB than items,
there are many other eBay sellers you can turn to.

NOT speaking for any employer, client or Internet Service Provider.

Footnote: The semi-canonical list of why buyers
don't get FB upon apparent payment:

There are tons of opportunities for routine and
all-too-ordinary buyer malfunction and
malfeasance after apparent payment.

The seller still wants ...

* That the buyer not have used a stolen
credit card or forged check to make payment.

* That the buyer provided a correct address
which is reasonably secure against the
parcel being stolen.

* That the buyer take delivery, and not refuse
it. (I've had this happen.)

* That the buyer take delivery, and not claim
non-delivery.

* And if delivery does not occur, that the
buyer requests a refund, and both parties
mutually agree to no-FB the deal. FB is FB
about the seller, not the carrier.

* That the buyer not claim damage when there
was none.

* That the buyer not complain that, dammit,
the item is exactly as described.

* That the buyer not falsely claim that the
parcel contains something other than
what the buyer bid on.

* That if there are any real issues, the buyer
communicates and gets them resolved, rather
than assumes that an instant Neg is the answer.

* That the buyer report acceptance - delivery,
complete, undamaged, as-advertised, as this
dramatically increases the odds that the
buyer will report any real problems, and
dramatically reduces the odds that the
buyer will reverse the payment.

Yes, a buyer can still go mental after reporting
acceptance, or after resolving issues, but the
transaction needs to be defined as &quot;complete&quot; at some
point, and acceptance/resolution is a suitable point.

The message you received was a form letter generated by the sellers
Seller Manager. I think he is using the standard template provided by
Ebay. It is a handy way to send a message because much of the
information is filled in automatically. It's nothing personal. I don't
think you are being extorted.

It sounds like your seller had good intentions but made promises he
couldn't keep. Unless you paid a premium for expedited UPS shipping
there was little chance that your purchase would arrive in the time
frame you needed. I don't know your locations so it's hard to say.

Many sellers prefer to leave feedback after the buyer.

Life is too short to get angry over something like this.

He said, in his original post, that he bought a laptop for $100.  I

Seems like everytime we get a new computer, it comes preloaded with a
ton o' crap that has to be removed.  I don't want a 30-day trial of
McAfee, Office, Norton, and a whole bunch more - did I mention AOL?  I
install Office 2000, which we have, but I notice that it's trying to use
the trial version and warning that it's only good for another so many
uses.  If what I hear about Vista is correct - that all files are stored
outside of the programs that create them - that shouldn't be a problem.
Maybe I should have removed the trial version before installing 2000.

Won't be a problem in this case.
The box containing the LT will be found to contain a brick.
If it actually contains an LT, the power brick will be missing.
If the power brick is there, it won't power up.
If it does power up, the LCD will be dead.
If the LCD works, it won't boot Windows.
There will be no recovery media or recovery partition.
The CD Key will be absent.
The LT will turn out to have been built for Win2K, ME or 98,
for which software can no longer be purchased.
XP and later drivers don't exist.

The only thing that depreciates faster than a
laptop computer is fresh fruit.

There's a difference between setting up a computer for use for a
business trip and setting up a computer for long-term use.  For one
trip, $100 for a basic tool to enter or view data can be worthwhile.
Theoretically, it could be worth $100 to buy the thing, take along a 1
or 2 gig thumb drive to use to bring home the data entered on the
trip, and then leave the laptop in the hotel room.

Even if the 'puter is used to show a PowerPoint presentation from a
thumb drive, $100 can be cheaper than trying to rent something on the
road in two or more locations.  And easier to arrange.

Depending on where the business trip takes you, there's even the
possibility that the buyer doesn't want to risk losing or damaging his
&quot;regular&quot; laptop.

Depending on the nature of the business trip, $100 isn't that large an
expenditure to make sure things go right.

I'm just guessin' here.  People do dumb things, but people also do
very smart things for reasons that appear to be dumb unless we
understand the circumstances.

I got a webcam for Xmas at work last year, but never hooked it up.  One
of the nice things about the Internet is that I don't have to get
dressed to use it - hair doesn't have to be combed, either.  Last thing
I want is to go on display.

The problem here seems to be doing it all at the last minute.  With the
track record on laptops on eBay, I wouldn't want to rely on an unknown
buyer to supply a working laptop right out of the box.  I did get a
laptop on eBay once - it was packaged along with an embroidery machine -
and it didn't work when I plugged it in.  Turns out that the hard drive
connection had come loose, and it was an easy fix, but not one to do
while getting ready to board a plane.

Nor would I, but I don't know what circumstances the OP was working
under.   I've been retired for a while, but I've lugged Kodak Carousel
Projectors around the country when they were the only thing we had to
work with, and there's been many a time when I would have been willing
to leave them in hotel rooms at the end of a trip rather than haul one
back home.  There just wasn't a source like eBay around then where
cheap replacements were easily available.  I'd consider $100 cheap,
even with the value of $100 in those days, just to get on a plane
after a long, multi-stop trip, with nothing more than my Hartmann
carry-on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;For a new job, at that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I still haven't fully set up my new laptop.....and had lots of un-fun
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in Boise last week.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kris

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm *still* working on the husband's laptop - a lovely Toshiba, but it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;has Vista on it, and I think I've got everything done for him except
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;getting it to talk to the printer.  In spite of downloading a driver
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;written for Vista, or so they claim.  *sigh*  I've threatened to lock
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the geek son in the office when he comes to visit, promising to shove
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;food under the door.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Joanne

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hmmm.....I wonder if we're talking about the same model?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Toshiba Satellite P205-S6277?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I haven't tried printing with it yet.   I'll save that for the printer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the trailer .... during an emergency.   ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Close.  No webcam in ours, I don't think.  Hmmmm.  Maybe I should check.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But it's downstairs and I'm not...  ;-)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;--
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Joanne

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm a luddite.   I'll have to figure out a reason to use the webcam.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I just bought it because I was at Costco and it looked nice, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;was a decent price.   And I knew that taking this computer on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;road again, wouldn't be a good idea.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Kris

&gt;&gt;I got a webcam for Xmas at work last year, but never hooked it up.  One of
&gt;&gt;the nice things about the Internet is that I don't have to get dressed to
&gt;&gt;use it - hair doesn't have to be combed, either.  Last thing I want is to
&gt;&gt;go on display.

The scam is to buy a laptop (although one worth considerably
more than $100), get the seller to ship QUICKLY because there's
some sort of emergency, so that the seller's use of a stolen
credit card won't be detected immedately.

Yes, I do.   There's more important things in life than worrying
about where the money goes.    I pay cash for them, and
keep them at least 13 years.   It's fine.

If the computer works for you, and you get it on time, that's
great.   But since it seemed there was some hurry-up involved,
it seemed dicey.

See the subject line of the thread.  My complaint was about the
apparent refusal to give positive feedback until I gave positive
feedback.

Who said I was jumping on a plane right away? If the computer came on
Monday, or even on Wednesday, or even Friday, I have time enough to
load it.  It's easy enough to put all the personal data on memory
stick or a CD or even a floppy before the laptop is even delivered.
If necessary, the programs can be downloaded at my destination.

(There were better laptops for not much more money, but their auctions
were ending a day or two later.)

Actually, all I need at first is a webbroswer plus the userid and
password of say, a Yahoo email account.  The laptop comes with an OS
and I'm sure includes a browser.  After that if I want, I can dl
FireFox.

If I get the job, it's unlikely I'll be starting right away, but if I
do, I'll probably have to buy software I have never had before.

Because we thought we had the facts?

The subject of &quot;who gives feedback first&quot; (and all variations)
has pretty much been beat to death here.   After ten years
of everyone arguing about it, we're numb.   Sometimes, a
feedback post gets no responses, when years ago there'd
have been 300.

So we talk about other stuff.   Sometimes we trade recipes.

Right.  And email arranging appointments with my prospective employer.
Actually there are several possible employers any one of which I might
be able to interest in the same project. It's been hard to decide
which to approach first.  Once one of them agrees to it, it's
conceivable that I would start on my part right away, regardless of
when they would implement their part.

There are two parts to my proposal: 1) do this and give me a bit of
money and some credit for it, but use your own employees to do the
work because they know the data already  2) hire me to do the work,
because you have very few employees already and they all have more
than enough to do, and because the data and its format is not
complicated anyhow.  (Actually I don't know how the data is stored,
but it's repetitive and I doubt it is very complicated.  Also, each
possible employer (partner in this project) has similar data, but it
is probably in slightly different formats.) _

Thanks for reminding me.  I'll take the CD for that.  (Buying that CD,
for a friend, was the other fight I had with an ebay seller who told
me flat out that if I rated him and didn't give him positive FB, he
would give me negative FB, and it would hurt me more than him because
I only had at the time about 10 purchases.  With him I made a deal
that if he sent me the only other CD he had that I thought I could
use, I woudn't rate him negatively.  That guy said he was the best
shipper on ebay iirc and it took him 10 days to ship the first CD. I
couldn't wait anymore so I downloaded it.  He had all sorts of excuses
for not send on time, and in both CD's was a printed note apologizing
for not shipping on time.

Right. I have no plans to put everything on it.    In fact I think I
could get by with nothing, but I wanted to take my banks' userids and

You remind me.  It's used, not new, so most of that stuff should have

away for 7 weeks in 1973 and my roommates didn't pay the utilities
well and one or both didn't pay the rent either.  I saw that coming
and arranged for my mother to pay the rent and them to pay her.  But
at least one didn't bother to pay her.)

&gt;Footnote: The semi-canonical list of why buyers
&gt;don't get FB upon apparent payment:

&gt;There are tons of opportunities for routine and
&gt;all-too-ordinary buyer malfunction and
&gt;malfeasance after apparent payment.

&gt;The seller still wants ...

&gt;* That the buyer not have used a stolen
&gt;  credit card or forged check to make payment.

&gt;* That the buyer provided a correct address
&gt;  which is reasonably secure against the
&gt;  parcel being stolen.

&gt;* That the buyer take delivery, and not refuse
&gt;  it. (I've had this happen.)

&gt;* That the buyer take delivery, and not claim
&gt;  non-delivery.

&gt;* And if delivery does not occur, that the
&gt;  buyer requests a refund, and both parties
&gt;  mutually agree to no-FB the deal. FB is FB
&gt;  about the seller, not the carrier.

&gt;* That the buyer not claim damage when there
&gt;  was none.

&gt;* That the buyer not complain that, dammit,
&gt;  the item is exactly as described.

&gt;* That the buyer not falsely claim that the
&gt;  parcel contains something other than
&gt;  what the buyer bid on.

&gt;* That if there are any real issues, the buyer
&gt;  communicates and gets them resolved, rather
&gt;  than assumes that an instant Neg is the answer.

&gt;* That the buyer report acceptance - delivery,
&gt;  complete, undamaged, as-advertised, as this
&gt;  dramatically increases the odds that the
&gt;  buyer will report any real problems, and
&gt;  dramatically reduces the odds that the
&gt;  buyer will reverse the payment.

&gt;Yes, a buyer can still go mental after reporting
&gt;acceptance, or after resolving issues, but the
&gt;transaction needs to be defined as &quot;complete&quot; at some
&gt;point, and acceptance/resolution is a suitable point.

&gt;EOF

I appreciate the answers to the individual statements.  No time right
to reply to them.

But regarding the footnote:

It's hard to imagine some of these things happen, but the reasons you
give make me feel a lot better about his apparent demand for my
feedback first.

OTOH, my impression is that positive feedback is what he wants, in
addition to all the problems you mention above not happening.

Actually, being two days late in delivering is probably not enough to
give negative feedback, and a complaint within positive feedback won't
be noticed for long if at all since he sells so many things, although
I might feel differently if I had been foolish enough to be leaving on
Tuesday or Wednesday.  It was the feedback issue that annoyed me, and
that was made a lot worse by the earlier experience with the Open
Office CD seller that I describe in another post in this thread.  His
actions was definitely extortion.

Being concerned about who leaves feedback first is not exactly
sharpest-drawer thinking.  Feedback is not required from either party.
If you feel that the seller should leave feedback first, and the
seller doesn't, just don't leave feedback for the seller.

Commenting in *this* newsgroup about a feedback issue indicates that
either you haven't lurked before posting or that you haven't paid
attention.  It's like wearing a &quot;Kick Me&quot; sign.

&gt;&gt; That's what negative feedback is for.

&gt;The scam is to buy a laptop (although one worth considerably

&gt;some sort of emergency, so that the seller's use of a stolen

Thanks.  I'm not quite as naive as Tony thinks but I didn't think of
that.   This must be why I've notice an enormous increase in the
number of sellers who say they'll only ship to verified addresses.

I use Adobe Photoshop 7.0 and Corel Draw 10 extensively.  I would have
to upgrade both programs, at considerable expense, if I switched to
Vista.  I've already lost Word Perfect 10 (and switched to Open
Office) because Corel will not support Version 10.  All three of those
programs, in the versions I have, are perfectly adequate for my use.

I have other programs that I use less frequently - like a video
processing program, a CD/DVD burning program, and an image viewer -
that probably wouldn't survive a change to Vista.

I have yet to see or hear anyone say &quot;Vista is better than XP&quot;.  All I
read and hear are sob stories about trying to find the right patches
to get currently-used programs to work.

Vista is still buggy as hell.  There are constant downloads of patches.
As usual, M$ released it before they cleaned it up.  I'd guess it'll
be a while.
