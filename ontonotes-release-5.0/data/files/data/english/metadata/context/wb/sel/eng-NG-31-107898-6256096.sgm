Hi all,

I know only slightly more about cars than I do about electronics, with
is to say not a whole lot.  Since I've seen many posts here about cars,
perhaps someone here can help.

Car is a 1999 Mazda Protege.  Suddenly, the car won't start.  Not
turning over, nothing.  I open the hood and the battery cables are very
badly corroded.  I clean them the best I can with baking soda and water
(no wire brush, just a tooth brush).  Still no crank.  I replace the
battery.  Still no crank.  I notice that the radio will play in the
first position of the ignition switch, but not the second (the one just
before "cranking position").  But if I turn on the dome light (which
shines dimly) or the headlights (which don't turn on at all), the radio
stops.

Just thinking logically, before the battery replacement, I was thinking
A. battery or B.  alternator.  With the new battery in place, I'm now
thinking bad battery cables.  What do you think?

Thanks for any help!

That means either the battery is flat or there's high resistance in the circuit.

You thoroughy cleaned the battery terminals and the matching connectors ?

When you replaced the battery are you sure the replacement was fully charged ?

Jenn, there's a sense wire coming off the positive terminal of the battery
that tells the alternator's voltage regulator what the voltage is. It might
be attached to the positive battery clamp with a crimped ring terminal. You
really need a wire brush along with the baking soda. A dull table knife is
also useful. Scrape until most of it is shiny. Lead forms a nonconductive
compound dull grey in color that can fool one into thinking the terminal is
clean when it isn't. That's why the little $3 rotary wire brushes are so
useful

I would stick with the obvious hypothesis, which you were pursuing with the
cables,  before moving onto the alternator. The alternator brushes might be
a little worn, the output a little low, but that probably isn't what caused
the present situation.

If you have a cheapo ohm meter, call and I can suggest a number of
point-to-point resistance tests.

Why on earth would you just start replacing parts without knowing whats
going on?
Unless your 'car' is just a hobby like audio, what you need to do is either
get a service manual and go through the actual diagnosis, or better yet take
the thing to somebody who knows how to fix it....

I replaced the battery because it was over 6 years old anyway, and I
figured it wouldn't be wasted money either way.

Obviously I'm trying to do what I can before I get it towed in.

What is making most sense to me at this point is to:
1. Re-clean the terminals with a wire brush and try again.  If that
doesn't work,
2.  Try another jump start in case the new battery isn't properly
charged.

New batteries come already charged.

If it wasn't that's a problem as it's likely been damaged as a result.

Jenn:

Cars respond better to a logical approach than to a shotgun. So, a
couple of things so as to separate the guesses from the actual:

First basic questions:

1. Does the car start when jumped?
2. After it starts, does it continue to run? Or does it die the moment
the jump battery is removed?
3. Will it run indefinitely? Or does that run-time have a limit?
4. Do you get any warning lights after it starts and runs?
5. Do you have a "Check Engine" light on by any chance?

You "replaced the battery". What does that mean? Did you take the car
to a place like Pep Boys or Sears or whatever, and have the guys in the
blue coveralls do the replacement? Or did you hike yourself to the
parts store, buy a battery and bring it to the car? Or did you go to a
Junk Yard and purchase a used battery?

_ANY_ new battery you purchase will be fully charged. Long gone (at
lease under normal climate conditions... you aren't above the Arctic
Circle, are you?) are the days that batteries were puchased 'dry' and
the acid was added upon purchase. It is *just* possible that you
purchased a defective battery, but the chances of that are quite
remote.

If you purchased a used battery, dead, then it will remain dead and
anything you do to resurrect it will fail in short order. You might get
it to hold a charge... for about 10 minutes.

If you did the replacement (with a new) battery yourself, it is just
possible that one-or-another of the small wires from the + terminal
(red) or separate ground wires from the -  terminal rotted through and
you did not connect it when you installed the new battery. Check
carefully for any stubs or such-like, and make sure that all the wires
going to the terminal clamps are secure.

As others have noted, you could have a bad ground strap. If your
vehicle is a manual, there will be (at least) one braided wire, usually
flat-braid, from the engine block to the frame (chassis) of the
vehicle. Look for this, it is usually visible from the engine
compartment, but as I am not familiar with your car, I cannot tell you
where. If it automatic, usually there is another similar strap from the
transmission.

The way starters work, there is a heavy + cable directly from the
battery, often unfused, then smaller wires to the solenoid. The
solenoid is activated by the key, and action completes the circuit to
the starter motor. So, if the connections to the solenoid are corroded
or broken, you will not get a start.

The radio plays, but when the dome light is lit, it does not? This
REALLY REALLY suggests you have at least one or several bad grounds.
_OR_ there is some electrical defect that is draining your battery in
short order such that it can do only one thing at a time.

Do you have a VOM? If so, you can check several things being:

a) the resting voltage _OF_  the battery (should be a minimum of 12.6V)
b) the idle-voltage _AT_ the battery (should be something a bit over
12.6V) @ ~650 rpm.
c) the charge-voltage again _AT_ the battery @ ~1500 rpm (should be
something over 13V to ~15V depending on the state of the battery.

If you do not get voltages close to the above, your electrical system
needs to be checked by the pros with the proper equipment.

But, unless you identify and cure this problem of a certainty, I would
advise you against driving the car until it is fixed. If you have some
kind of short somewhere causing the battery (and therefore the entire
electrical system) to drain, that will manifest as heat if you feed it
all it can eat. Which could have spectacular results. If you have (a)
bad ground(s), you could wreck the computer, an expensive result. And
if you have a defective charging system attempting to overcharge it
could boil the battery dry and/or melt it into slag... which is both
expensive and dangerous.

Robert:

Careful with offering "continuity" (AKA "resistance") advice as it
applies to vehicles. For all practical purposes, lead-acid storage
batteries may be taken as constant-voltage, infinite-current devices
such that improper connections to a VOM can be spectacularly fatal to
the instrument.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From her descriptions, it seems that her difficulties are either as
">

simple as a bad ground or other conductor (90%), bad starter solenoid
(4%), bad ignition switch (4%)  or something much more spectacular
(2%). It is that 2% that concerns me, and the potential consequences
that might arise from it.

It is generally not a good thing for someone not familiar with
automotive electrical systems to 'cut-and-try' on their own. Modern
computerized vehicles, especially those with OBDI systems are acutely
sensitive to surges and even under-voltage. Much harm can be done in a
very few seconds. You will notice these days that most service
locations will plug a small device into a car's cigarette lighter
almost upon arrival. This device will supply voltage to the computer if
the battery must be disconnected for any reason (such as servicing the
starter or alternator or similar) as even a short interruption can
cause problems ranging from hard shifting to problems with the
pollution controls.

Procedure:

(1) See if you can jump start it.

(2) See if battery will hold enough  charge to restart the car after you've
driven it around a bit.

If car can be jump started, then the problem is either the battery or the
charging system.

Action required:

replace battery or correct charging system, as required.

Jenn,

Good advice has already been given by others, which will most likely
solve the problem.

I'll just say this:

You obviously don't like random red warning lights.
Well then, never, ever buy a French or Italian car.
Please, stick to reliable Japanese vehicles.

There's a hint in there...the ignition- Replace the ignition switch.
I've had similar issues with my oolldd '67 Chevy,and replacing the
ignition was the key. (har-har.)
The battery may have been due for a replacement anyways.
The cables/connectors could use replacing since they're corroded. -Go
over the battery wiring carefully,sometimes there's "fusible links" and
whatnot that may need to be patched up.(or may have corroded.)

Possibly but that isn't gonna happen in her garage so she'll
get towed in anyway where they can run diagnostic.

I've had these symptoms and it was always a bad/corroded
battery connections.
Sometimes at the clamp to cable as much as the clamp to post.
When you figure it out and fix it...coat them with the battery
corrosion inhibitoros available at any auto parts store.
The work well.

The can usually be cleaned up.   Sometimes the battery + to
the rest of  vehicle power connection is on the starter so
those connections should be checked too. Requires going under the
vehicle while jacked up on stands....something I doubt your
willing to do.

I thought you were married?  Where's the husband?
My wifes pat answer for anything she doesn't want to do,
"thats a man's job".    I can't ever figure out what the womens jobs

This is Usenet. It is bad form to invite a transition from here to
'real life' on an open forum. If you want to do that, it is best done
via private e-mail.

It is also quite dangerous to suggest to _anyone_ who is not trained in
and fully aware of the dangers to do _anything_ on a vehicle that is
not intuitively obvious. And unless you are familiar with the
*specific* vehicle involved such that there could be absolutely no
question at all about what-goes-where-and-how when you do give such
advice, then you are rolling big dice with someone else's health and
happiness.

Jenn has/had an electrical system screw-up. If she is poking around and
inadvertently makes a connection just by pressing on a connector or
some such, the *POW* may be no fun. Again, a battery is a
constant-voltage, infinite-current device under these conditions. That
could mean A LOT of heat or LOTS of sparks... She already stated that
she has only the most basic of knowledge... Directing her remotely
would be like me advising her to test the B+ on a tube power-amp
without either an isolation transformer or telling her that it could be
well over 400V...

Of course. We used to keep a large fishing knife in the glovebox to
hit the starter motor when it jammed. Worked very well. However, one

Whacking a starter with a heavy object is a tried and true method going

That makes sense,it could be a bad ground...
Infact,now that you mention it,I'd almost bet that's what it is. The
grounding on most new cars is very poor,Maybe 2-3 small ground straps at
the most.
Add a couple more heavy jumpers,one from the battery to the
frame/body,and another from the engine block to the frame/body.
This cured alot of problems in my friends car,We just happen to notice
that the original strap between the engine block and the body was only
like 12AWG wire,and the insulation was *melted* off of both ends.
So we beefed them up,cured the electrical issues and the car even ran a
little better after that.

Double check the grounding on the ECU also..Beef it up if needed.

&gt;&gt; Really ?

&gt; Really. Not on the ground side, of course, but often on the primary
&gt; side from the battery to the main fuse block.

&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; whatnot that may need to be patched up.(or may have corroded.)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Also,check the starter/solenoid. ;)
&gt;&gt; And how do you suggest Jenn checks that ?

&gt; Whacking a starter with a heavy object is a tried and true method going
&gt; back to the very first electric starters. We keep a rubber mallet for
&gt; our sometimes-recalcitrant VW Westie... works every time. One day, I
&gt; might get around to replacing the starter... one day. It is a rare need
&gt; to-date.

The Middiot has to avoid the point, or else he'd do the right thing and go
away. Then he'd have nothing to do with all of his spare time.

Unfortunately, some lesser minds worship the Middiot. Some of the apparent
worshipers may be sockpuppets, but appearances are that he's pulled the wool
over many eyes.

Regrettably, he's not the only one around here suffering from his strain of
oral defecation.

You're forgetting his sockpuppets and dupes.  The Middiot gets a few
converts by playing the back side of "the enemy of my enemy is my friend".
If you're prone to making idiotic posts, the Middiot is your friend until he
gets bored with you.

The Middiot has mastered reverse alchemy. There is no gold so pure that he
can't turn it into crap.

We should be so lucky. Not a chance.

Mpfffff.... Have you ever given platelets? It is about a four hour
process, with a 10cm teflon needle stuck in each arm. It feels so good
when they pull out the needles that it almost makes one want to do it
again and again.... The upside is that (usually) the Red Cross nurses
are pretty good looking (at least where I go) and will scratch your
nose (or elsewhere) if needed.

The difficulty with filters as others have mentioned is that sometimes
they fail if the filtered object either answers some posts or is
quoted/answered by others. I am gradually refining them to cover this
exigency. As to the commander, I suspect that when he grows up and has
to pay for his own internet access he will mellow out some. As it is
now, he is a bitter little self-absorbed pre-pubescent with lots of
time on his hands and clearly uncaring parents... assuming he has
parents. If not, that may account for some of the bitterness. I just
find it odd that the little git should hang in tube &amp; audio-related
venues when it is so clear that he has neither experience in nor even
superficial knowledge of the subjects. I am sure there are venues where
his particular brand of bile will not only be appreciated but welcomed.
