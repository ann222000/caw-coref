Just as the question of whether material things exist objectively
(mind-independently) or only subjectively (dependent on a mind or
minds) is an unresolved question in ontology, so is the question of
whether ideas exist objectively or subjectively.  During the Middle
Ages and early modern age, the latter question was as controversial as
the former.

Today there is little debate; it is commonly assumed that ideas have a
purely subjective existence.  That conclusion does not seem to be a
product of any resolution of the question, but purely of forgetting
the question.   One reason for that has been the rreplacement of
religion with science as a source of worldviews; science does not
assign any explanatory role to ideas.

To those within the religious paradigm, though, the question is still
current, and still as controversial.  In that light comes this
treatment of the subject from the article, "Idealism," in the Catholic
Encyclopedia online. http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07634a.htm

What follows is quoted entirely from that article.  I have, though,
made liberal cuts in the material [indicated with square brackets],
and have divided the quoted material using my own headings [ditto].

[Objective Idealism]

Platonism is the oldest form of idealism, and Plato himself the
progenitor of idealists. It is usual to place in contrast Plato's
idealism and Aristotle's realism;[...] but for both, what lies deepest
down in their philosophy is the conviction that the first and highest
principle of all things is the one perfect spiritual Being which they
call God, and to which they lead back, by means of intermediate
principles--essence and form, purpose and law--the multifarious
individual beings of the visible world. In this sense idealism is
dualism, i.e. the doctrine of a higher spiritual principle over
against that which is lower and material; and this doctrine again is
clearly opposed to the monism which would derive the higher and the
lower alike out of one and the same All-being.[...]  By means of its
principles, idealism maintains the distinctness of God and the world,
of the absolute and finite, yet holds them together in unity; it
adjusts the relations between reality and knowledge, by ascribing to
things dimension, form, purpose, value, law, at the same time securing
forethought the requisite certainty and validity; it establishes
objective truth in the things that are known and subjective truth in
the mind that knows them. In this sense the Schoolmen teach that forma
dat esse et distingui, i.e. the principle which formally constitutes
the object, likewise, in the act of cognition, informs the mind.[...]

In this sense St. Augustine developed the Platonic teaching, and in
his philosophy is idealism in the genuine meaning of the term. From
him comes the definition of ideas which Christian philosophy has since
retained: "Ideas are certain original forms of things, their
archetypes, permanent and incommunicable, which are contained in the
Divine intelligence. And though they neither begin to be nor cease,
yet upon them are patterned the manifold things of the world that come
into being and pass away. Upon these ideas only the rational soul can
fix its gaze, endowed as it is with the faculty which is its peculiar
excellence, i.e. mind and reason [mente ac ratione], a power, as it
were, of intellectual vision; and for such intuition that soul only is
qualified which is pure and holy, i.e., whose eye is normal, clear,
and well adjusted to the things which it would fain behold" (De
diversis quaest., Q. xlvi, in P.L., XL, 30).

This line of thought the Scholastics adopted, developing it in their
treatises as ideology. Their theory is described not as idealism, but
as realism; but [...] this means rather that the ideal principles
possess real validity, that as ideas they subsist in the Divine mind
before the things corresponding to them are called into existence,
while, as forms and essences, they really exist in nature and are not
really products of our thinking.

[Subjective Idealism]

In this last-named sense, i.e., as subjective constructions, ideas had
long before been regarded by the philosophers of antiquity and
especially by the Stoics, who held that ideas are nothing else than
mental representation. This erroneous and misleading view appeared
during the Middle Ages in the guise of nominalism, a designation given
to the system whose adherents claimed that our concepts are mere names
(nomina), which have as their counterparts in the world of reality
individual things, but not forms or essences or purposes. This
opinion, which robs both science and moral principles of their
universal validity, and which paves the way for Materialism and
agnosticism, [...] had its champions and propagators, notably William
of Occam. For the untrained mind it was easier to consider individual
things as the only realities and to regard forms and essences as
purely mental products.

So it came to pass that the word idea in various languages took on
more and more the meaning of "representation", "mental image", and the
like. Hence too, there was gradually introduced the terminology which
we find in the writings of Berkeley, and according to which idealism
is the doctrine that ascribes reality to our ideas, i.e. our
representations, but denies the reality of the physical world. This
sort of idealism [...] does away with the reality of ideal principles
by confining them exclusively to the thinking subject; it is a
spurious idealism which deserves rather the name
"phenomenalism" (phenomenon, "appearance", as opposed to noumenon,
"the object of thought").

The doctrine of Descartes has also per nefas been called idealism. It
is true that Cartesianism is in line with the genuine idealism of the
earlier schools, inasmuch as it postulates God, thought, and spatial
reality. But, on the other hand, this system too employs idea only in
a subjective signification[....]  According to the theory of Leibniz,
which has also been regarded as idealistic, our mind constructs from
its own resources (de son propre fond) its scheme of the world; but ,
thanks to a pre-established harmony (harmonie préétablie), it accords
with reality. This view, however, furnishes no solution for the
epistemological problem.

Kant claims that his critical philosophy is both a "transcendental
idealism" and an "empirical realism"; but he declares ideas are
"illusions of reason", and such ideal principles as cause and purpose
are simply devices of thought which can be employed only in reference
to phenomena. Fichte took Kant as his starting-point but finally rose
above the level of subjectivism and posited a principle of reality,
the absolute Ego. Hegel's doctrine can be termed idealism so far as it
seeks the highest principle in the absolute idea, which finds its self-
realization in form, concept, etc.- a view which amounts virtually to
monism. The various offshoots of Kantian philosophy are incorrectly
regarded as developments of idealism; it is more accurate to describe
them as "illusionism" or "Solipsism", since they entirely sweep away
objective reality.[...]

A Catholic might make similarly disparaging comments on some of your
lifestyle choices.  However, I don't think you'd consider them as
having anything to do with the truth of your metaphysical theories.
And you'd be right, as those would be arguments /ad hominem/ -
directed against you, rather than any of your ideas.   I don't see it
your /ad hominem/ arguments against their metaphysics as being any
different.

SNIP

Befor I heard of quantum mechanics, I learned that the objective and
subjective world were interactive.ie. The ocean exists, but my perspective
of the ocean has shifted and will shift a number of times.

Zennists say "first there is the ocean, then nothing, then the ocean becomes
the ocean once again.

There are few who would suggest that observing the ocean will change its
actual structure and behaviour. It could be argued (and it is, quite
vigourously today) whether our accumulated behaviour does have an effect.
For me, there is no argument. The question , is to what extent and with what
consequence.This is a clear indication of a link between the subjective
(visions of life style and appropriate creations...pollution etc) and the
'objective' consequence.In other words, some changes (mans contribution)
starts with a subjective view.

Of course, quantum mechanics demonstrates how that occurs in a direct sense,
at the particle level .

The very essence of such observations, has validated my early teachings
regarding the observer. I have a wider perspective on myself and as such ,
have more command over "my ocean". Psychosematic is very real. When one
knows this it becomes more real.

When I read such articles as the one you posted, I see how each specific
view depicted, actually follows a chronological pattern

In a sense, those views have come full circle. Socrates, imo, already had
the full picture. Plato and his sucessors, took the picture apart, and we
are now (some that is) are putting the picture back together again.

- Yes and no; if one may equate "ideas" with "forms", biologists have
pointed out
how entirely different ... taxa? (well, some category) like mammals and
...marsupials(?),
although from different genetic pools and geographically isolated,
nevertheless have
produced strikingly similar animal types, that seem interchangeable in their
wildlife "roles"
of pastoral prey and canid-like and feline-like predators; just as if there
was an "ideal"
(no pun intended) "shape" or size for certain kinds of wildlife roles.

- Of course, this doesn't really indicate anything about the ontological
status of ideas,
merely their handiness in some kinds of description, at best perhaps
bordering on
explanation.

- Personally (if that should be relevant) the concept of a platonic idea is
a) easily illustrated by looking at a car fresh off the assembly line. It is
as per spec as it can be as a car, but the very moment it rolls out of the
factory, decay sets in. Minute specs of rubber stick to the tarmac .... the
engine starts to
degrade, the paint bonds toxic chemicals in the atmosphere .... likewise, no
existing thing is "as it should be" compared to the newly minted self, the
self as it was designed, the original, "ideal" self ...
hence,
b) the concept of an idea can provide a useful shorthand wrt. description,
as it enables us to use the (counterfactual) privative adjectives. It
enables us to talk about any given thing ("A Zebra .....") as suchh-and-such
a thing even though it lacks one ore more of the generaly understood
characteristics (" .... with three legs and no stripes").

- I have always regarded ideas as a proto-version of "pattern", which to me
have the same ontological status as e.g. numbers. They are not things, yet
they are not subjective in the sense that numbers are perhaps the only
things that are truly intersubjective, perhaps even really objective. there
is no "my" or "your" 2, only a 2 which is the same for everybody. For
details, see Frege and perhaps Hofstadter.

I have to agree with another poster in that I question the relevance of the
quoted article. It is too evidently concerned with catholic apologetics and
propaganda to be of philosophical value; it fails even as history of
philosophy.

I recently moved into a 'sky' appartment, the roof garden of which, was home
to a pair of rosellas.

I returned one afternoon , to find one in half, and the other gone.

The next day there was a photo of a hawk, caught up in some netting in a
tower just down the road.

In future I'm going to watch the hawk like a hawk, and hope I dont get
caught in a similar way....;-)

It appears that this is one of those issues where Christ changed some
tradition that had been practiced in the Old Testament. Eye for an eye
to turning the other cheek kind of thing, revision. There are a few
more things Christ supposedly changed. As an agnostic, I see no reason
to believe that this is a contradiction. Even if it were, most people
have some contradictory assumptions or had them at different times in
their lives. Am I to watch all people closely or is there a cut off
point where the level or type of contradiction needs to be attended to
by this watchfulness? What criteria would differentiate one
contradiction from another, with one resulting in the watchful eye and
the other, acceptable?

-------is this what a Catholic would say, below?

The prohibition against eating blood found in the Old Testament was a
discipline associated with the covenant between God and Noah, and
incorporated into the Mosaic Covenant. When Jesus established the New
Covenant through His death and resurrection, the disciplines of the
Old Covenant became unnecessary. The discipline was maintained for a
brief time in the early Church to protect new converts from scandal,
but was not associated with the theological understanding of grace.
When taken in context, we find that the consumption of blood is not
forbidden and, moreover, it is necessary in the Eucharist....

...Bringing the fullness of revelation to man, Jesus completes the Old
Law and brings in the New. No longer does the blood of animals signify
life for man, but rather the Blood of Jesus Himself, poured out in the
New Covenant, gives us new life. What the blood of animals signified,
the Blood of Christ provides. Because His Blood provides redemption,
He commands us to drink it (Jn. 6:54).

Unfortunately most of the geniuses I've known seem pretty throughly
wrapped up in credentiality and kudosology, not to mention
mammonology, but it's possible there might be one or two unfettered

You said you're an "agnostic" but you refer to Jesus as "Christ".

There's a lot of talk about a "Christ" and an "anti-Christ".  You
sound like you know something about the bible, does it say anyplace
who's coming to the party first?

I'm not sure exactly - I tried to find something on-line, but couldn't

Men do not learn about Ideas by direct communication from God (the way
they learn of God's grace and power, and stuff like that), but have to
puzzle them out from the things which are patterned on them.

This is true. If a claim contains a direct contradiction the claim is false.
Hypocrisy and contradiction need to be recognized as different.

Regardless, contradictions and fallacies are within the realm of logic. Since
religion is within the realm of faith, it is impervious to reason. This being
said, integrity and consistency become a big issue in religion. A major
inconsistency can rattle someone's faith.

I remember, as a boy, being struck by the similarities between the

&gt; - Personally (if that should be relevant) the concept of a platonic idea is
&gt; a) easily illustrated by looking at a car fresh off the assembly line. It is

&gt; factory, decay sets in. Minute specs of rubber stick to the tarmac .... the

&gt; hence,
&gt; b) the concept of an idea can provide a useful shorthand wrt. description,
&gt; as it enables us to use the (counterfactual) privative adjectives. It
&gt; enables us to talk about any given thing (&quot;A Zebra .....&quot;) as suchh-and-such

That's an even better example, to my mind; as an automobile (or any
other manufactured thing) clearly is idea(s) or form(s) as well as
material - all of which can in principle be discovered by reverse-
engineering.

&gt; - I have always regarded ideas as a proto-version of &quot;pattern&quot;, which to me
&gt; have the same ontological status as e.g. numbers. They are not things, yet
&gt; they are not subjective in the sense that numbers are perhaps the only
&gt; things that are truly intersubjective, perhaps even really objective. there
&gt; is no &quot;my&quot; or &quot;your&quot; 2, only a 2 which is the same for everybody. For

&gt; I have to agree with another poster in that I question the relevance of the

&gt; propaganda to be of philosophical value; it fails even as history of
&gt; philosophy.

The author's bias fairly drips off the page; though how much of that
is due to his  Catholicism, and and how much is due to his writing in
1910, is hard to tell.  I did, though, think that it was very good
history of philosophy - it presents the philosophers' ideas in contxt
of each other, showing their relation, and it fairly summarizes the
views of even the 'subjective' idealists with which the author clearly
disagrees.

To deal with your second point first; that sense of 'communication' is
not communication of any ideas; since the people being communicated to
do not see the ideas themselves, but the copies.

That answers your first point as well:  the ideas are not
'communicated' to the rational
soul either, since even the most rational soul has to use his body's
senses to get any  any information; and the senses give information
only about particular things, not about any general ideas or forms.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm still puzzled.

Here's a summary which supports my reading:

&lt;quote&gt;
There is a well-known adage of scholastic and thomist psychology,
which states that we derive the content of our abstract ideas from the
content of our sensations, and, by means of these, ultimately from the
material universe. Nihil est in intellectu quod prius non fuerit in
sensu. "There is nothing in the mind which was not first in the
senses." Our ideas of life, strength, greatness, motion, action
exercised and received, double, half, right, etc. -- all these and a
thousand others equally abstract in nature -- are derived from our
sense perception of the objects which surround us. We have proper and
direct knowledge of the material world only. Our mind is closely
united to our body, and it is in and through the corporeal bodies that
we obtain our intellectual knowledge.
It follows from this that even moral ideas (justice, right, etc.) and
our knowledge of spiritual beings (the mind, spirits, God) is derived
from, and must be expressed in terms of the material, by means of
comparison, analogy, negation, and transcendence. [...]

The problem of the origin of our abstract thoughts, however, is to be
solved in the same way in which it is solved for our sensations. But
it is more complicated on account of a special difficulty.[...]
Before meeting this difficulty, let us take note of the similarity
which exists between the processes of sensation and of thought, and
why, in the last analysis, both will be solved in the same way. This
similarity consists in the initial impression coming from an external
impulse, and followed by a characteristic reaction which belongs to
thought as well as to sensation. For, experience and consciousness
alike prove that the mind also needs to be determined or completed by
the corporeal object known, and that it does not derive merely from
itself the content of its ideas. A blind man has no idea of color.
Left to itself, our mind would be an empty desert, or a clean slate
(tabula rasa), with nothing written on it [3]. Here, as in the case of
sensation, there is a passage from potentiality to actuality; there is
an initial passive state, and there is an impression which is received
(species intelligibilis impressa). The two horses or dollars from
which I derive the abstract idea of the number 'two,' or of 'money,'
'power,' 'form,' etc., act upon my mind. And just as in the case of
sensation, the mind reacts to the stimulus and answers by a vital act,
by means of which the phenomenon of knowledge is completed (species
intelligibilis expressa).

Now, we have to deal with a special difficulty which arises in the
case of abstract knowledge. This difficulty appears because it is
necessary to harmonize the doctrine of which we have just been
speaking with a central teaching of scholastic metaphysics. We shall
see later on that the universe of all Schoolmen without exception is a
pluralistic one, and that each of the myriad beings of which it is
composed has its own separate and independent existence (VIII, A).
Each oak tree possesses its own being, independent of all others, and
this is equally true of men, animals, etc. And thence comes the
difficulty: a particular individual thing, such as an oak tree, can
give rise to a sensation of sight which is in turn particularized; but
how can it give rise to abstract notions such as life, cylindrical
form, without the particularizing conditions which belong to each real
living, or cylindrical being? How can this particular living being
give rise to the notion of life as such? How can the concrete be known
abstractly?

The external object (which we here suppose to exist outside of us)
cannot determine thought in the same way as it determines sensation.
By itself alone it is powerless. The two horses, being particularized
and individual, cannot, by means of the sensations they produce, give
rise to an impression in us which gives them a mode of being different
in kind and superior (abstract) to that which really belongs to them
(particular, concrete). Otherwise we should have a cause producing an
effect superior to itself. The less would produce the more. At this
point, Scholasticism adopts an Aristotelian theory. It is not only the
two horses or two dollars which act upon my intelligence, but the
sensation of the two horses or dollars act in cooperation with and in
dependence upon a special spiritual power within me, which "shines
upon the sense data, and makes them capable and ready to produce a
knowledge in which reality is deprived of all its concrete and
individual features." This creative power is called active intellect
(intellectus agens), and in opposition to it the mind or the
intelligence in which the impression is produced, under the twofold
influence of the corporeal beings and the intellectus agens, is called
intellectus possibilis. &lt;/q&gt;

For obvious reasons, I am no great fan of newadvent.org

sentence of the description above is the first one. Ideas
are indeed described by Kant as "illusions of reason,"
but the falsehood (perhaps even an intentional lie) is to
lump "causality" in with the rest. It's also obvious that
the Catholics are huge Kant detractors, because they
cannot stomach the thought that Kant reduced God to a

Kant detractors simply for mentioning God at all, in any

since the beginning. The benighted criticism leveled in
the above commentary has a long history.

It seems there are two ways of describing the same process.  One
description says that sense data from the physical, imperfect,
realizations of the ideal impinge on our senses and we use the special
features of our mind to generalize back to the ideal without being
able to sense that ideal directly.

The other description says the ideal expresses itself to us through an
imperfect channel, those imperfect physical manifestations, and we
"get the message" after a certain amount of effort in decoding the
message.  It is as if the ideal is communicating to us in what an
engineer would call a noisy medium.

Actually, much of human communication is of that form, like trying to
figure out what the burger flipper is trying to say throught the
distorted squawk box in the drive thru line.

We use some combination of senses and mind to dig out what the
original message is.

In this sense it seems to me to make sense to say the ideal forms
communicate to us about their essence.  It also makes sense to say
they don't, and we figure it out using  a particular combination of
observation and deduction.

Quoting Kant

And the Mystic

In respect of god, therefore, no knowledge of ours is antecedent to

Well, we're back with Already Aristotle .... what is "to be"?

Er, yes, sorry; I meant to substitute 'ideas' for 'material things' in

Agreed.  But that leaves open whether ideas exist when they're not

Agreed.
If an "idea" is a species of "information", and "information" is something
akin to "pattern",
then I get to have two conflicting intuitions, or basic assumptions:
- information must be manifest in some medium in order to inform, so to
speak.
Corollary: if it isn't manifest, it is at least not accessible.
- however, a "pattern" still gives me the feeling that it is "out there",
just like "numbers" are,
although we never encounter them as such.
Imagine a series of polygons ranked by the number of sides:
triangle, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octogon etc.
This is the 3,5,6,7,8 sides seris of polygons (if I remember my latin and
greek correctly).
What is missing is the square, the 4 (... the ... "tesseragon" ...?).
But although I don't "think" of the four, the possibility of the four-sided
polygon
is still "out there" in the sense that the possibility of it is not
dependent on me
thinking it. So while not manifest (at least not to me in this TE), it still
doesn't
give me the sense of not-being just because I don't think of it.

The question remains what we want to understand "being" to mean.
What kind of existence could non-manifest information possibly have?
Where is that crafty quadrate hiding?
It is not a physical entity.
It is not a "functional" entity (it doesn't affect anything).
Could it be something like a "possible" or "potential" entity ...?
An existence-in-storage, so to speak?

While not being able to shake the "out-there" feeling,
I have to stick with the locus that any entity which is credited
with having an overall property (like "motion") must have
a certain species of that property (flying, say, or walking, swishing,
meandering,
sauntering, resting, bobbing, weaving and ducking ....); and if it doesn't
have any specific way of
e.g. moving, it doesn't have motion in general, either.

So it is hard to say what kind of "being" pure pattern could have.
Do we lack a word? A concept? Clear understanding of patterns?

I think the hypostasis, the "reification" of Ideas as found in Plato is a
fig leaf for this kind of
embarassment - he simply invented a "realm" for them where they "hovered"
....
The easy way out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't know them at all; but I believe 'taxonomy' is the name for the
&gt; classification process in general,

Yes. IIRC, "taxis" = "grouping, order of standing", as in e.g. "tactics",
the art of grouping soldiers into a battle line.
"Nomos" is of course "law", i.e. "the rules for ...". So that would make
general taxonomy the "art of grouping", and any specific taxonomy "the rules
for grouping this kind of entities", making taxonomists the world's first
groupies.

and that's what I meant.  I didn't

Wide jump there ....
I mean, few will go along with Aristocles' reified Realm of Ideas where the
"triangle" sojourns in eternal bliss - in a kind of timeless "concept
heaven" - while the bleak copies dripping off it slowly descend earthwards
to form the cross sections of brazil nuts.
So: reverse engineer it to have been a trope - specifically: a katachresis -
all along. Enter us moderns*: What is idea a metaphor of? Nothing other than
what we please to call pattern, form, information.

Once perception gets mixed into the bowl, we shift from ontology to
epistemology, and one will probably be branded ... like New Zealand sheep,
to avoid mentioning names.
Besides form and/or pattern, we may also perceive e.g. weight, which is of
another quality altogether.

However, with "forms or properties", you are well covered indeed, at least
if "properties" is defined as "that which is perceivable of an entity"
(which, btw, would include its form; while the idea of it is not perceivable
directly, but accessible to the intellect through reflection or speculation
...).

* Seems each age borrows simila from the most advanced machinery of its age.
Certainly one could construe a sort of history from mechanics (la Mettrie et
al.), via electricity and magnetism, even hydraulics (Freud), up to our
computer age "brain software" speak.

This is in line with your excellent phrasing in another thread, about
separating assumptions from conclusions.
To avoid bias, simply state "Cx", which actually means everything, and hence
possibly doesn't really say anything; in order to actually say something,
one has to limit these extensions, sometimes just positing something in
order to get started. So (according to Me) a lot of skew isn't bias, it is
merely the unavoidable side effect of making a meaningful statement by
limiting it; the limit excludes something. Stating what is excluded, and how
and why, makes clear the underlying assumptions; it is hiding these
assumptions - perhaps in order to give a certain statement a wider
applicability or validity than it actually has - from others which
constitutes a lie, and hiding it from oneself which constitutes bias. IMHO.
OK: IMO.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; For obvious reasons, I am no great fan of newadvent.org

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sentence of the description above is the first one. Ideas

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the Catholics are huge Kant detractors, because they
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot stomach the thought that Kant reduced God to a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mere Idea. And by the same token, Objectivists are often
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Kant detractors simply for mentioning God at all, in any
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; respect. This has been the case with the Kantian criticism
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; since the beginning. The benighted criticism leveled in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the above commentary has a long history.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It's equally obvious that Kantian true believers like yourself respond
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to disagreement with their position by making unfounded accusations,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; imputing motives, and similar irrelevant ad hominem garbage.  So why
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are you bothering to demonstrate the obvious yet again?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Was the a personal ad hom attack?

&gt; &gt;Yep.  But it was both true and justified.

&gt; Justified by what?

By your ad hom attack on Willmann; in effect, all you told us was
that:  Willman is  wrong because he's a Catholic, and Catholics are a
crazy cult (just like "Objectivists") whose only mission is to distort
and suppress Kant's Rvealed Truth.

You can imitate a bot till hell freezes over, but obviously that's not
going to make what you said disappear.  Let's look at your
arguments:
1. "Catholics are huge Kant detractors."  That's false, of course most
Catholics have never heard of Kant - but it's also an ad hominem
attack on the author tht doesn't address his arguments; rather than
address them, you've merely attacked him for his religion.
2. "Objectivists are often Kant detractors."  That's not relevant to
the article in any way; you just threw it in because you don't like
'Objectivists.'
3. "So if poor, poor Willmann doesn't like it, then go find him a
boy."  That has to be 's an OTT smear - simply because Willmann made
an accurate comment about Kant, you've responded by calling him a
pedophile.

Tell you what: I'll remove your article from the backthread, and leave
it in; but rather than your cleaned-up version, I'll put in what we
can call the authorized version instead:

For obvious reasons, I am no great fan of newadvent.org
and its Catholic encyclopedia of philosophy. The only true
sentence of the description above is the first one. Ideas
are indeed described by Kant as "illusions of reason,"
but the falsehood (perhaps even an intentional lie) is to
lump "causality" in with the rest. It's also obvious that
the Catholics are huge Kant detractors, because they
cannot stomach the thought that Kant reduced God to a
mere Idea. And by the same token, Objectivists are often
Kant detractors simply for mentioning God at all, in any
respect. This has been the case with the Kantian criticism

I top you,
you top me,
We both top so easily,
So easily, then we both fall,
I top you, and that's all I know (how to do).
