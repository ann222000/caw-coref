'Shakespeare has surface beneath surface, to an immeasurable depth,
adapted to the plummet-line of EVERy reader. His works present many
phases of TRUTH, each with scope large enough to fill a contemplative
mind. WhatEVER you seek in him you will surely discoVER, provided you
seek TRUTH. There is no exhausting the various interpretation of his
symbols; and a thousand years hence a world of new readers will possess
a whole library of new books, as we ourselves do, in these volumes
old already.' -- (Our Old Home, p. 106) Nathaniel Hawthorne, 1863.

But what plays the mischief with the TRUTH is that men will insist
upon the UNIVERSAL application of a temporary feeling or opinion.

German reformer Martin Luther, at the Diet of Worms, proclaimed

THE KNIGHTS OF SAINT JOHN IN ENGLAND, SCOTLAND &amp; IRELAND

&lt;&lt;By 1567 the only English knights remaining on Malta were the
titular Grand Prior Richard SHELLEY (who was an active participant
in several plots against Elizabeth) and Oliver Starkey (commander
of Quenington), later titular BAILIFF of Egle (from 1569).&gt;&gt;

[John Shakspere was BAILIFF of Stratford (from 1568).]

&lt;&lt;Starkey, who had been La Valette's Latin Secretary
and was the only Englishman at the Great Siege,
died in 1588 &amp; SHELLEY died in 1590, when a French knight
was appointed to the titular Grand Priory.

This appointment was challenged by an Irish knight resident
in the convent, one *ANDREW WISE* from Waterford who, after
complaining, was appointed BAILIFF of Egle but, still unsatisfied,
appealed to the Pope. In 1593 Wise was appointed titular Grand Prior,
a dignity he held until his death in 1631. From thenceforth the
offices of Grand Prior of England, Turcopilier, BAILIFF of Egle
and Prior or Grand Prior of Ireland became honorifics given to
knights whom the Grand Master &amp; Council wished to honor with
the grand cross &amp; membership of the Chapter-General.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Ben wrote several plays for the Children of the Chapel Royal, a
newly-established boy acting troup. Cynthia's Revels was one of those
plays, a very informed satire of the Court. So informed was it that two
other playwrights of the time, John MArStON and Thomas Dekker, were
convinced they recognized themselves in two of the less-likable
characters. They promptly collaborated on a play satirizing Ben, which
the Chamberlain's Men performed, to the great delight of the London
theatregoing public. Ben just as promptly fired back with Poetaster, or
The Arraignment, whose main character was the image of MArStON, with
Dekker in a more minor role. Poetaster had attacked the law and
the military as well as Dekker &amp; Marston. Ben was saved by the
intervention of one DICK MARTIN, a lawyer with an actual sense
of humor, and after that, Ben d ecided that tragedies were safer.&gt;&gt;

Unfortunately David, there is a sophistry to this issue; to wit; did the
authors of the King James Bible, comtemporaneous with our period, write in
such a way... since what we know of the material is subject to their
recording it, unless of course we are able to contain the miasmic contents
of gnostic gospels, and sieve its contents, noticing possibly that more has
been excluded from our modern record than included.

Whether this occured primarily in the 3rd and 4th century, or in the
rewriting published 1610, smack in the middle of simultaneous expressions of
the Work is largely unexplored. Nicolson is good on it, using so little
material - nevertheless making a solid case - rather than a scholarly one
which also admits influences we /must/ take note therof, but which cannot be
soldily accounted.

Here is a difference between respectable history and vaguer anthropology,
yet which is greater in appreciation?

&gt;&gt;&gt; You find a keystone here of a mystery, Art, however, I submit,
&gt;&gt;&gt; as well as these written signs, the mystery is not itself a text.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think, as in much masonic writing, there must be an element of
geometry,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and a T superimposed over an H will provide three columns, or masts

&gt;&gt;&gt; But how should they 'come together' if they are parallel and remain
&gt;&gt;&gt; unfocussed?

&gt;&gt;&gt; so:-

&gt;&gt; You're [sic] point being?

&gt; Your making the same errors in you're writing as some of the least
&gt; ARTiculate and most demented anti-Stratfordians, Art. But carry on --
&gt; your parody is excellent.

"/>

I am unsure what is intended with this comment, other than that Art has
missed a referencee which is not textual, or rather, that it intended to a
[true or otherwise!] place, or even cosmogony.

And that writing C12th throught the C16th, and even into the C20th has
continued to romance of the subject.

It is undeniable David, that some analysis which Art performs unearths these
giants from our imagination - it is of course not evident which of them make
any sense. But you will admit that codification of certain texts is
extensive, even into the Work of the Author?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; ( Whether the T T T signifies a Triple Tau
&gt;&gt; or the Mt. Calvary Crosses is immaterial to me
&gt;&gt; so long as it strengthens puzzles which produce &quot;de Vere&quot;)

&gt; Translation: aneuendorffer114 ... @comicass.nut has already decided who
&gt; wrote the canon and is just fishing for random, meaningless coincidences
&gt; to serve as &quot;evidence.&quot;

It would certainly benefit Art's thesies to confound his ideas with a little
methodology. As an indicator of the value of content, it is a neutral
activity, no? One must admit that the sort of analysis that Art examines is
exactly the neoplatonic method of 'hiding in plain sight' without having to
admit that such cyphers refer to what we can acknowledge as 'real'.

Certainly David, as a mathematical person you will admit the Greek use of
Gematraic cypher beyond any possibility of coincident expression? It is even
insulting to the philospophy of such Greek composers to employ the term
'cypher', since again we expereince the influence of a subject hidden in
plain sight. Hidden since one cannot pierce the significance without
/sufficient/ learning.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; A slothful man is compared to the filth of a DUNGHILL:
&gt;&gt; EVERy man that takes it up WILL SHAKE his hand.

&gt; Let me get this straight, Art -- are you suggesting that the author
&gt; of Sirach was hinting at the identity of the true author of the
&gt; Shakespeare canon?! In the case of someone who thinks that Aleksandr
&gt; Nevskii was tsar and that Virgil predated Herodotus, one cannot rule out
&gt; *any* chronologically cretinous idiocy, no matter how ludicrous.

"/>

Intellectually, I must plead for the semiotic understanding referred above -
that the issuance of the texts we now read was sophisticated, and Art
employs techiques to notice such interpolation of a neoplatonic basis, but
whatever its meaning lays largely unexplored.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But if
&gt; so, why is Sirach deuterocanonical rather than canonical? Surely the
&gt; Priory could have arranged that it be included among the canonical books?

"/>

Surely the Priory left a goodly number of false trails, since the seeker is
not as respected as a male form, but in the [to us] more mysterious female
sense.

Even modern writers state plainly of their own feeling of inspiration that
it is they who is sought by it, rather than it by them.

Utter bloody ignorant nonsense. There are only a handful of NT
apocrypha that ever received serious attention from the Church, and they
(Clement I, the Shepherd of Hermas, the Epistle of Barnabas, and the
Epistle to the Laodiceans), when they were rejected -- all but the last

I believe that receiving &quot;serious attention&quot; from the Church was often
an unpleasant experience, even in the early years. The followers of
Valentinus spring to mind, although I hear the feeling was mutual. ;-)

It's my understanding that the method used in translation of the James
version was to parcel out various bits to different poets, who worked
on them individually, and they all worked from a single version.

Compare to the &quot;translation by committee,&quot; that created &quot;The Complete
Gospels,&quot; Robert J. Miller, Ed. The committee drew from various
versions of the source materials and then haggled out an agreement on
a translation that was as close as possible to the meanings in the
source texts. It's now in its third revision I believe.

Somebody looking for cyphers in King James should probably begin with
the identification of the translator of the section being worked on,
before reading signs into the text.

The Complete Gospels, besides the four canonical narratives (in
various versions), includes a fifth narrative, six &quot;sayings&quot; gospels,
two infancies, fragments of five other named gospels, three
jewish-christian gospels, and some &quot;orphans.&quot; Imagine what was
written that we haven't seen, either because it was repressed, or
rejected on &quot;style over substance&quot; grounds, or other reasons. And
that's only the gospels. Taking into consideration the whole of the
New Testament, imagine what was lost.

Strange as it may seem, the Church neither was nor is obligated to

Not that that has anything to do with the entirely risible proposition
that the essential NT canon is less than four hundred years old. (The
20-verse forgery known as the &quot;Epistle to the Laodiceans&quot; was not
finally dismissed everywhere until the 17th century, but it hardly

I am not aware of any book that was dismissed from the canon for style.
None of the NT is in particularly good Greek (Dorothy L. Sayers
compares it to the English used together by two educated Indian
gentlemen because they have no other language in common), and the
various writers display considerable variety. Condemnation, when it
happened, was generally on one of the three grounds of heresy, forgery,

The King James Bible is not and never was the only text of the Bible,
nor was it, by a long shot, the first English translation. The Roman
Catholic Church used St. Jerome's Latin translation, known as the
Vulgate, for over 1,000 years, and Anglicanism had been using various
English versions since Henry VIII. King James's men could no more have
set the canon of the New Testament than could Lyndon Johnson have
written the Constitution of the United States. Moreover, anyone who has
learned the basics of the matter knows that the Greek text used by King
James's men was the Textus Receptus, the first edition of which was
printed by Erasmus in 1516.

From what I've read about it, which isn't much, the four narrative
gospels were [probably] chosen for inclusion precisely because they
are narratives, and represented a better fit with the other text (a
matter of style). The other gospels aren't all that substantively
different from the canon, are they?
I still wish that the Church had preserved the other texts. My copies
of the Complete Gospels and the Nag Hammadi Library are well worn, and
it would be grand to be able to read the whole of the texts of which
we only have fragments.

&gt; set the canon of the New Testament than could Lyndon Johnson have
&gt; written the Constitution of the United States. Moreover, anyone who has
&gt; learned the basics of the matter knows that the Greek text used by King
&gt; James's men was the Textus Receptus, the first edition of which was
&gt; printed by Erasmus in 1516.

"/>

To restate my proposition:- which has nothing to do with '(re)setting the
canon' - I said that there was an opportunity for the writers of King James
to choose particular phrasing in English, and include pertinent words and
phrases...

The context was that such phrasing can be subject to sophistry.

I am unsure if this statement is why you take specific offence to my post.

I am unsure if you are joking Christine - there are perhaps another 20
'gospels' some of which are radically different from the 4 chosen. Pagels
for example points to radical differences between Thomas and John concerning
the resurrection, and also the authority of any christian church.

Of all the rejected material, the 4 chosen ones achieve the idea of a male
centrality in the religion, and the office of a Pope. Gnostic gospels speak
of a direct communion outside of need for priesthoods.

Of course the other element supressed is the role of the Magdalene. More
than less described as a whore in the chosen 4, she may have played another
role entirely according to Philip, Thomas and her own Gospel.

The 4 chosen were written in about 100 to 200 AD

Why, as a scholar, so do I. But, for the most part, it wasn't the

business today to preserve &quot;Dianetics&quot;.

And the image being pushed by contemporary new-agers and their
precursors, going back to Victorian times, of an age in which these
books were accounted Scripture by &quot;the early Christians&quot;, and only later
removed in a mass purge, is unsupported by the historical evidence.
It's like someone in the future believing that all the K/S stuff was

You don't understand the difference of what can be historically established
and what can be appreciated? ROFL!

This is the constant theme in this newsgroup; with so many instances it
seems redundant to mention any. What can be established of the Author is
often very little, and often resting upon contention, or averages, or
sociological normative factors, right?

You yourself are very fond of espostulating with 'nonsense' comments and
resting on the historical record (which is very slim) and seeming to regret
even any conversation which might be cause for other thought.

As far as I can perceive from writing here, it is this sort of indulgence by
Strats which provokes attack from others, however well-founded.

When you write to me critically like this, totally absent of any discussion
of the subject, simple or complex, what is your motive for doing so? If the

I suggest that you look up &quot;non secuter&quot; and, when you do not find

John Kennedy spelled out quite plainly what was nonsensical about
your post; since then you have asserted that that wasn't what you meant,

you meant (to which he was not privy unless he possesses paranormal
powers unsuspected by me).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Is this an assertion or a question? In either case, it is customary
to ask one's interlocutor what he or she meant only if there is some

upon readers to second guess what meaning, if any, its author had in

BACK TO THE TOP

If I may address David, one moment, rather than the barking section of the
100 acre wood:

After writing both early and late the same day, in two different languages,
I do apologise to you if If in my ambition to say too much I scrambled my
message.

However, unless you too wish to hurler avec loups, can you state your own
opinion of the subject matter?

I was unable to understand from John Kennedy other than that he was a
scholar, and not if he had actually read the title to which I was referring.
Is he angry about 'turf encroachment'?

Elsewhere I see that Art has posited two possibilities following the
rewriting of KJB. Since textual encoding is rife throughout the Work of
Shakespeare, of his contemporaries, and the KJB was rewritten during this
same period, what say you?

I am not asking you to state your opinion of the worth of such encoding, but
simply the existent that it exists.

There are 5 common codes employed in texts of the period, two of which Art
cites continuously; the anagram and the acrostic (and their variants).

certainly some Strats seem to reside in the 'prove it to me' school of

From Greek, it is a substitution code of letters for numeric values.
Actually Platonic rather than (obviously) the Neo-Platonic excitations of
the C15th. The numeric values, in turn, have significance to geometric
proportions, and especially the proportion PHI.

In short, every book of the bible is loaded with such gematraic inference,
so far beyond any 'unliklihood' of chance occurance as to be unthinkable. I
do not intend to write a thesis on this abstruse, indeed esoteric, subject
here, however, to validate investigation into textual coding, the bible
itself is a great stimulus.

Certainly people who have studied Bacon will be familiar with these ideas
(nevermind any question of Authorship) as re-emerging in assorted MSS during
the neo-platonic revival, contemporary with the writing of the Work.

Presumably then, other writers have other views? But do they have any more
information, or are such views inferences they have made? Surely the record
is anything but sewn up, so that it can no longer be questioned? In fact the
opposite seems to be true, and what be know of the period 1580-1630 is
largely conjectural, tending to normative views of the mainstream Protestant
revivalist ethic. There were enough factions operating simultaneouly, some

NO. STOP! If I wished to say that I would. However, there is another case
which I am making - a methodological case, of type of inference.

Secondly, since such encoding as exists in the bible is Platonic, and both
cases of The Work and rewriting the [KJ] Bible occured in a Neo-Platonic
revival, then the Bible and the Work may both be encoded to a mutual and
exterior reference, no? Rather than one-to-another.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; then
&gt; go right ahead. Otherwise, I see no &quot;bones of contention.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are 5 common codes employed in texts of the period, two of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Art

dates,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your method of investigation is not one that i feel i can subscribe
to

&gt; Check it yourself. Most of his &quot;anagrams&quot; involve far more than
