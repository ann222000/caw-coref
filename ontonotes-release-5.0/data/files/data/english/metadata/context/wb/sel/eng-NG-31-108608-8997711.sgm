What good does this do a mathematically illiterate AGW Bunnie like
yourself, Sir Phil of Shit??

You don't want to admit it, but climatology has no prerequisite for
mathematics, chemistry, physics or science. Just a willingness to
repeat rhetorical philosophy without question.

Your charlatan upbringing shows,,,that you cannot understand inverse
relationships.
Frequency to wavelength is an inverse relationship. It is not directly
proportional.

Because frequencies are such high numbers, and wavelength is not
directly proportional to energy of the photon or spectral line like
frequency is, the term, 'wavenumber' has come into use.

To convert wavelength to frequency onen divides by the velocity of
light. 2.99E10cm/ wavelength.
Also to convert frequency to wavelength one divides c.
2.99E10cm/ frequency.

Therefore if one just takes the reciprocal of wavelength, one gets a
smaller number that is easier to work with, but which is a direct
proportion to the energy of the spectral line, just like frequency is.
If you divide the wavelength while it is in cemtimeters you refer to
the wave number as such.

HOWEVER, THE DIMENSION OF THE CENTIMETER HAS NO RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER
TO THIS VALUE OF WAVENUMBER.

So Wiens Law is .2898cm /T
or 4.95kT / h

Frequency of highest intensity at 300K,,
c / (4.95kT / h )
2.99E10 / (4.95 x 1.3807E-23 x 300 / 6.626E-34)
= 9,6um or,,
.2892cm = 2892 microns,, 2898 / 300 = 9,66um (microns)

And the slope of the intensity of energy at lower temperatures
according to Planck, and Rayleigh-Jeans, radiation law being a square
to the frequency.

10 microns is .0010 cm. wavenumber 1/.0010 = 1000
15 microns is .0015cm. wavenumber 1/ .0015 = 666.667
1000 squared =  1,000,000
666.667 squared = 444,444.444
1000000 / 444444.444 = 2.25 times greater.

The spectral line at 10 microns on a graph of the distribution in
which vertical scale is uniform units of energy radiated at this
spectral line will be about 2.25 times higher or greater energy than
the spectral line at 15um at temperatures near or around 300K.

Therefore for the theoretical radiation curve for earth's
temperatures, the 15um band is far out of the main energy band and not
significant to the bulk of energy radiated.

Well at least I do understand these basics. I am only trying to teach
these illiterate believeres in AGW the basics. It is very clear that
they cull their ranks of any one with actual understanding of physics
or those with mathematical apptitude who would ask questions and

&gt; &gt; These two cities are about the same lattitude and elevation.

&gt; The fact that you presume that latitude and elevation (and even

&gt; remaining credibility you might have had with respect to climate.
">

In even trying to understand how your little mind closes itself off
with the term 'climate' and how I am missing this important point, you
should consider the facts of these two cities in regards to
temperature.

Each day, these locations recieve a quantity of solar energy. Each
night, the input of energy to these locations is much less without the
solar radiant energy. Therefore, each night the temperature goes
down.

A rock, exposed to the sun, aborbs energy all day, and increases it's
temperature. Then at night it loses the energy and it's temperature
decreases. The air rapidly loses it's heat energy to the upper
atmosphere. The rate and quantity of the surface losing it's heat
energy, primarily determines the air temperature. Although air
temperatures are caused also by regional air temperatures.

At 2 meters depth, the ground temperature does not change, but is near
to what the average annual temperature is at the surface. The
temperature of the ground after that increases about 1 deg F, for
every 100 ft depth.

Your tormented little dishonest mind, wishes to use the word,
&quot;climate&quot;, to avoid having to answer questions about the daily input
of energy to a particular area, and the rate that this energy is lost
back into space in a PARTICULAR AREA.

So what the hell does climate have to do with a damn thing here,
asshole.  Climate only kicks in after decades. Why are the record high
temperatures in Yuma, all of them much greater than Austin??

Austin is very dry. Look up it's stats. It has high humidity since it
is near to the gulf. But it is not so close that the ocean cools it's
temperature. Yuma is much closer to the ocean than Austin.

You wish to refer to vague statements of &quot;energy budget&quot;, and your
consensus estimation and dictated repittion of &quot;3.5 Wm-2 of increased
radiation returned to the surface and changed 'energy budget', since
industrialization. You claim an absolute readings from your intruments
of the trace gases.

BUT YOU HAVE NO REFERENCES TO WHAT MUST BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 99% OF THE
SUPPOSED GRENHOUSE EFFECT, WATER VAPOR, WHEN THIS GAS CAN BE STUDIED
IN VARIED CONCENTRATIONS. THIS IS CRIMINAL DELIBERATE FRAUD OMITTING
THESE PERTINENT FACTS

Although this sounds nice to a simplistic mentality that doesn't
analyZe the specific situation of daily energy gain, and daily energy
loss in the day-night cycle, and deal with actual energy in infrared
radiation, and even the actual value of energy density in ergs per sq
meter per second, this does not mean that you have reached any
scientific analyses of the impending apocalypse of global warming from
your nonwavering belief in your 3.5W of human heat pollution in TRACE
GASES of the millionths of part by volume.

It is clear why you accept distorting and falsfying data being in this
field as you are. You must, in order to make the entire string of
bullshit seem to hold together. YOu never get readings that suit you,
so you must distort them all.

And those in control, like Dancin Hansen, make sure that no simply
honest scientific reports get published since this would surely throw
a monkey wrench in the overzealism towards the sacrosanct goals of
governmental modification to centralized and dictated economic control
of your holy war according to your scaremongering of the
prognosticated dissaster of global warming according to your very
provable JUNK SCIENCE.

&gt; &gt;&gt;            Do you know of an observation location that is not in
&gt; &gt;&gt; a Urban Heat Island and that has been in the data set from
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1880 to present that exhibits warming in a slope that can be
&gt; &gt;&gt; associated with CO2 concentrations?

&gt; &gt; I think it's misleading to try to directly associated temperature
&gt; &gt; trends at one station with CO2 concentrations.  First of all, the
&gt; &gt; temperature trend at one location isn't necessarily indicative of the
&gt; &gt; average over the globe and will probably be subject to regional
&gt; &gt; variations that swamp the long term signal.

&gt; The long-term signal?

&gt; &gt; Second, we don't expect a
&gt; &gt; one-to-one correlation, because the earth-atmosphere system has a lot
&gt; &gt; of built-in thermal inertia.

&gt; It's also not at equilibrium.

&gt; &gt; When you put a pot of water on a stove
&gt; &gt; turned to &quot;high&quot; it doesn't instantly boil.  If you were to vary the
&gt; &gt; intensity of the heating on the stove, the response by the pot of
&gt; &gt; water will be both damped and delayed.

&gt; The rate of heating will be dependent upon the temperature (and amount)
&gt; of flame and the temperature of the water. I can see delayed, but
&gt; damped?

&gt; &gt; Having said that, there are numerous stations at remote locations that
&gt; &gt; are unlikely to be affected by any urban heat island.

&gt; I believe the Gilligan's island station is off the air. :-)

&gt; &gt; I'm sure the
&gt; &gt; folks who analyze station have singled a lot of those out for careful
&gt; &gt; study, though I don't personal know of such studies (not me specialty,
&gt; &gt; as I said).

&gt; You should look into some of the station siting errors that have been
&gt; found, from being right next to AC vents to being behind where jet
&gt; airplanes are parked.

&gt; Give this a look.

&gt; http://wattsupwiththat.wordpress.com/category/weather_stations/

&gt; Amazingly, most of the 'green' posters here don't seem at all concerned
&gt; about having good data, or even that their dataset is polluted.

&gt; And are not most of the weather stations providing temperature data
&gt; in the US?

&gt; &gt;&gt;            And do you know of any reason that, if one location
&gt; &gt;&gt; warms, another location must cool ?    [That would be required
&gt; &gt;&gt; by the premise that there should be a certain &quot;normal&quot; temperature
&gt; &gt;&gt; for the globe.]

&gt; &gt; I'm not sure I quite understand the question.

&gt; &gt; Let's put it this way: the average (&quot;normal?&quot;) temperature of the
&gt; &gt; globe over, say, a year, must be such that incoming sunlight and
&gt; &gt; outgoing longwave radiation are more or less in balance; otherwise
&gt; &gt; that average temperature would sharply change from one year to the
&gt; &gt; next.

&gt; About this &quot;average&quot; temperature. What does it mean?

&gt;  From a previous post (it's not 74.8F now)...

&gt; Let's say that right now, the pacific ocean's temperature off
&gt; the cost of N CA is 45F and the interior temperature is 74.8F
&gt; (that's what my outside thermometer reads).

&gt; The average temperature is (45+74.8)/2 = 59.9F

&gt; To what does 59.9F refer?

&gt; Should I use 59.9F for planning my local activities or for my
&gt; planned (thought) beach trip?

&gt; &gt; If you create excessive hot spots everywhere but no cool spots,
&gt; &gt; then the overall amount of OLR will increase (assuming no change in
&gt; &gt; cloudiness etc.)

&gt; Hot spots?

&gt; And we know that WRT the atmosphere, everything else will not be
&gt; equal, don't we?

&gt; &gt; so as as to drive the earth's average temperature
&gt; &gt; back to whatever the balance point is.

&gt; It's not in thermal equilibrium, it's heated for half the day,
&gt; then it cools for the other half. And it's heated more for
&gt; roughly half the year, and less for the other half.

&gt; &gt; But again, it's that balance
&gt; &gt; point for the average that is presumably drifting upward with
&gt; &gt; increased CO2 and other GHs.

&gt; That's what we are being told.

&gt; But seems to me that the climate's been getting warmer since the
&gt; end of the last ice age.

This is one of the guys (qzectb), that uses the recievers at the
surface to analyze atmospheric radiation. In order to keep their
funding and favoratism with their high priest, Dancin Hansen, in any
of their studies regardless of the instrument, or the study, they
reach the conclusion that is consistent with Dancin Hansens
contribution to the ICPP and the ICpp's conslusion, that 3.5Wm-2 of
outgoing radiation is returned to the surface due to the increased
TRACE gases caused since the beginnning of industrialization.

They give only limited data from their instruments, but brag about how
much public money they are spending, so therefore you should believe
their unsupported statements.

In Dancin Hansen's most recent paper, June 2007,
http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2007/2007_Hansen_etal_2.pdf

he talks considerably about what he calls 'long lived trace gases'. He
attributes a considerable value to the forcing of these trace gases
during the climate changes of the ice ages. Yet his consideration does
not include the supposed, 'feedback', effects of the increasing water
vapor with temperature. He barely mentions water vapor at all, and
gives no quantified values for water vapor. Of the supposed 150Wm-2
required for increase of 33C at 287K, almost all of this must be water
vapor.

It seems that Dancin Hansen knows of the data from these forms of
instruments, in which they cannot quantify the grenhouse effect from
these instruments and water vapor, which can be studied in varying
atmospheric concentrations.

So he is apparently covering his ass, by omitting water vapor from
what he produces to be an important document to the science of
climatology, as only the HIGH priest can deliver. In doing this he
leaves his little Bunnies such as 'qzectb' out on the limb, with their
theoretical format, which must include water vapor, or they must
entirely remodel their grenhouse theory to better fit their data.

Along with his vague quantifications for 1ppm reductions of GTG's, and
his irrational, indirect, and implied scaremongering of methane and
his suggestion that worldwide methane be reduced by 1/3. He doesnot
mention that as a longlived grenhouse gas. Methane in actuallity
decomposes to CO2 in 10 yrs.

Only outside analyses of Hansen's statistics revealed his 'error' that
made it seem that recent years were warmer than the 1930's. His
arrogance and willingness to promote his junk science without
supportive evidence, is clearly exemplified in this paper which was
published before he was caught using his fudged statistics.

He now proposes the propaganda slant, that he is justified in
distorting and falsifying his data due to the inherent value of the
holy mission of the AGW'ists and their cult of profit and
superstition, and that all of the little Bunnies should be proud of
him, for his overzealous attempt to support the cause of AGW.

Dear RoidrAge:

Aren't you the same guy that was hyperventilating because you had
completely misinterpreted the Trenburth et al. paper on estimating the
radiative forcing from greenhouse gases?  I'm pretty sure it was you.  Let

Well then quit posting the phoney graphs with a radiation curve for
300K having peak intensity somewhere around 17um. This is the false
graph that was used in Europe to get the false postulate of AGW
believed and passed into law.

Wien Law, is that peak intensity is a direct proportion to
temperature. Therefore it is related to temperature by the
relationship of .2898cm/T, or 4.95kT / h. For 300K the peak intensity
is 9.66um. A proper radiation curve from experiment and Planck's
Radiation Law, has intensity increasing as a square to frequency. At
low temperatures the peak intensity is not far from this slope. This
means that at earth temperatures, in which peak intensity is near 10um
(microns), the peak intensity and the band around this at which most
of the energy is transmitted, is around 2.25 times greater than the
energy transmitted at 15um.

A theoretical graph shows that the major band in which most of the
energy from the earth is reradiatied is nowhere near the 15um low
emission band of CO2. And even if it were, this low emission band has
no capability to retain energy. It only exists because the molecule
radiaties it's energy better at other frequencies, as indicated by the
lasing properties of CO2 in which it radiates most strongly around
10um.

Tell your chump ass friend who does waste and embezzle money, that his
and his comrades inablity to do science, mathematics and to
incorporate valid theory, along with their fraudulent science designed
to dictate our existence in relation to our use of energy, is going to
get them into a lot of trouble someday. Just kissing Hansen's ass is
not doing science.

The only point is to diminsh how many peoples lives they destroy
before they are brought to reason and justice. Even if this bullshit
is enacted, it will be repealed with the proper accounting for the
crimes that have been commited.

The question is of the radiation from the earth's surface, duffus. The
ocean and the land surface radiate according to Boltzman Stefan, and
the distribution of this energy follows Wiens Law and Planck's
Radiation Law. The actual distribution of energy according to the
theoretical curve may be different, but not overall energy of Boltzman
Stefan. There are direct experiments that can be done to confirm the
distribution of energy radiated near 300K.

A gas that is at a temperature, will bring a solid substance to this
same temperature. How do you explain how air inside a box, can bring
the outside of the box to a temperature in which it radiates according
to Boltzman Stefan? It is impossible that this energy is transfered
only by collisional exchange of kinetic energy, if you do the math,
since the mean kinetic energy of the molecules only increases as a
direct proportion to temperature.

I guess you haven't gotten that far with your rhetoric, since you
cannot derive the mathematics for this exchange of energy. Oh by the
way, energy is not Wm-2. Energy is in Joules or calories, ergs,
electron volts. The dimensions of time and area are not relevant to
actual quantitiy of energy.

Such peer reviewed journals only publish what is not contradictory to
their previous publication. This is really petulant also your
statement. So when I do publish this simple mathematics, then you will
look at it to criticise it directly?

You of no ability who trust in those you presume understand what you
cannot, are amazing.

Even in the trenberth paper you attack me for criticising, you accept
this as peer reviewed. Yet think of the premise. They say that with
only O2 and N2 atmosphere, there would be 240W to the surface after
albedo, and 240W out, deriving the average temperature of about 0F.

http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/abstracts/files/kevin1997_1.html

Then with the 'grenhouse gases', water vapor and trace gases, the
atmosphere blocks from the distribution, 150W. This paper accounts for
32Wm-2 form CO2.

With only O2 and N2 atmosphere, they claim there is no atmospheric
radiation returned to earth.
But now with these trace gases and water vapor, the atmosphere is
supposedly radiating 324Wm-2 back to the surface which is absorbed,
dictating the surface temperature.
The sun in this diagram, is only providing 168Wm-2 to the surface.

1-2% water vapor, 300ppm CO2, Methane at 1.5, and N2O much less. These
gases responsible for 324Wm-2 of radiation returned to the surface???

So let's see the instument readings for atmospheric radiation returned
to the earth with various water content in the air. Where does this
correlate at any point with the actual measure of heat energy which is
temperature? This is a considerable amount of heating from the return
of radiation to the surface, and if it were true, could be documented
with various water vapor content, at the same location, and at
locations of varying humidity.

These authors are insane. The fools in academics that peer review this
insanity are insane, and the fools that believe them are insane. The
NAS will eventually lose all of their accreditation for their
inability to review this fraudulent theoretical science.
You do have the right to believe me to be invalid, but these
statements are simple mathematical fact.

Eventually this will all in up in a court room for actual
determination of fact. Modern theoretical science does not believe in
proofs. So I guess the proof of this criminal fraud, will be left to a
courtroom, not a peer reviewed article in the mental masturbation
circles of theoretical science.

But I guess you will have to wait until a peer reviewed publisher
formats it for your little mind, behind names and titles with which
you have the trust to BELIEVE as a good little believer. You wouldn't
want to be called a denialist, so you must believe. You certainly have
no empirical or scientific evidence to support substantiation of fact.

Screw you again, asshole. Let's talk mathematics.

I pointed out that your theory of gases is invalid because you claim
that N2 does not absorb infrared. This is absolutely integral to your
theory of grenhouse gases. In the energy budget diagram, therefore,
without ghg's, the 240 after albedo, would return to space, with no
atmospheric absorption or radiation to the surface by the O2 and N2.
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/abstracts/files/kevin1997_1.html

And then you claim that the trace gases are radiating 324Wm-2 to the
earth. But you cannot show this with any of your readings of water
vapor effect on distribution of frequencies. When I pointed out the
statistics of Austin and Yuma, you only made a childish insult that I
knew nothing of 'climate', since elevation and lattitude are not the
ONLY factors in climate. So where is the evidence of energy returned
to the surface by much greater water vapor content.

Evade the specifics, charlatan. NO one will notice, as long as you
profess your long standing tradition and the belief in the assumption
that you are not totally full of shit.

So where would be the accounting for the evapotranspiration, and
'thermals', with no GHG's?
You don't know and don't care. Every part of this cute little picture
is invalid.

And look at the first graph, it shows the theoretical distribution for
earth's upwelling radiation to peak around 10um, but this peak is only
about 1.3 times higher from the bottom of the graph than 15um. This is
deliberate fraud.

The next graph, shows, 'grenhouse effect&quot;. It is a composite of the
satellite readings and the fraudulent theoretical graph. It is
criminal fraud, and eventually,(since it is clear your crazed nuts
will not desist), will be PROVED to be fraud in a courtroom.

This is ridiculous. You can squirt all the indirect, secondhand, semi-
related information to avoid these facts which will be proved in court
someday against your fraudulent theoretical science, and your
pursuance and complicity in other crimes.

It can be proved directly that N2 gas absorbs and radiates in all
frequencies of the infrared up to about 2um.
This is by the quantity of energy transfered by this gas to a solid
surface. This energy is not transferred by exchange of kinetic energy
in direct collisions, as is the primary basis of grenhouse theory.

According to the perfect gas law, which holds for all gases at low
pressure, P/V = NRT
So therefore, between 300K and 1000K,
Pressure increases, 233%, mean kinetic energy for the velocity of the
individual molecules increases 233%.
Average velocity of the individual molecules increases, 83%. Number of
collisions in unit time increases 83%.

However, according to Stefan's Law and experiment, the energy leaving
the surface of the solid substance, (like the outside of a box, or the
external metal of a cylinder of a heat engine operated with nitrogen
gas) increases 12,226%.

PURELY MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE ENERGY IS TRANSFERED ONLY BY
COLLISIONS OF THE MOLECULES. PROOF THAT YOUR THEORY OF GASES IS
INVALID, REGARDLESS OF YOUR CONTINUED MATHEMATICAL INEPTITUDE.

I told you.  Untold thousands of surface measurements of downwelling
longwave radiative flux are there for you to download and analyze any
way you want.  You can correlate them with humidity any way you want.
You're the one who wants to overturn the conventional wisdom.  I think
the burden is therefore on you to martial your evidence instead of
just spouting off.

Why do you suppose nighttime temperatures cool off much more rapidly
under cloud-free, dry conditions as compared with  cloud-free, humid
conditions?  It's the large difference in downwelling longwave
radiation  due to water vapor. You can measure the difference easily
with a pyrgeometer;  you can observe firsthand the effect on night
time temperatures, and you can run a model that reproduces the
observed behavior extremely well.  But you will find an excuse to
discount these very basic and well-known observations.

Deliberate fraud is a strong allegation, don't you think? Assuming
that the figure in question is anything like what I imagine, that
deliberate fraud would involve a conspiracy of thousands of
spectroscopists and other scientists going back to the 19th century.
I would think that instead of accusing the entire of scientific
community of coordinated fraud, you would instead first ask the
question, &quot;Is there perhaps a logical physical explanation for why the
spectrum of radiation looks the way it does?&quot;  It seems to be beyond
your ability to contemplate that your own thinking might be erroneous,
so others must be committing fraud.

There is likely a very logical physical explanation for whatever
figure you're talking about.  All you have to do is buy an
introductory book on atmospheric radiation and educate yourself
instead of making hysterical accusations. But I suspect you believe
the books are all fraudulent too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; that N2 gas absorbs and radiates in all

">

&quot;up to&quot;?   2 um is a very short wavelength for IR.  Which side of 2 um
are you talking about?  Anything shorter than 4 um is pretty much
irrelevant to thermal emission by the earth and atmosphere.

We have weather satellites that easily observe the Earth's surface
without obstruction at 10-12 micrometers, in the absence of clouds.
If, as you say, N2  &quot;absorbs and radiates in all frequencies of the
infrared&quot;, that wouldn't be very well possible, would it?  There are
numerous IR wavelengths where satellites CAN'T see the surface.  Most
of these wavelengths are associated with water vapor absorption, whose
reality you vigorously deny.  You can tell the absorption is water
vapor, not N2, because you can see the surface from space through very
dry parts of the atmosphere but not through humid parts.  N2 exists
more or less equally everywhere.

Or are the weather satellite images fake too?  How about the satellite
sounders that use absorption/emission by CO2 to obtain temperature
profiles?  All faked?  How about the satellite sensors that have
channels scattered throughout the IR that can easily track water vapor
because of its IR emission and absorption properties?  All faked?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

What is the point of the above calculation?  It has no bearing on the

&gt; Please spell out what you're talking about.  What 240 are you talking
&gt; about?  And what is your point?  It's not clear.

&gt; &gt; knew nothing of 'climate', since elevation and lattitude are not the
&gt; &gt; ONLY factors in climate. So where is the evidence of energy returned
&gt; &gt; to the surface by much greater water vapor content.

&gt; I told you.  Untold thousands of surface measurements of downwelling
&gt; longwave radiative flux are there for you to download and analyze any
&gt; way you want.  You can correlate them with humidity any way you want.
&gt; You're the one who wants to overturn the conventional wisdom.  I think
&gt; the burden is therefore on you to martial your evidence instead of
&gt; just spouting off.

&gt; Why do you suppose nighttime temperatures cool off much more rapidly
&gt; under cloud-free, dry conditions as compared with  cloud-free, humid
&gt; conditions?  It's the large difference in downwelling longwave
&gt; radiation  due to water vapor. You can measure the difference easily
&gt; with a pyrgeometer;  you can observe firsthand the effect on night
&gt; time temperatures, and you can run a model that reproduces the
&gt; observed behavior extremely well.  But you will find an excuse to
&gt; discount these very basic and well-known observations.

&gt; &gt; So where would be the accounting for the evapotranspiration, and
&gt; &gt; 'thermals', with no GHG's?
&gt; &gt; You don't know and don't care. Every part of this cute little picture
&gt; &gt; is invalid.

&gt; I don't understand the point you're trying to make.  Without GHG's,
&gt; there'd likely be little if any transpiration.

&gt; &gt; And look at the first graph,

&gt; I have no idea which &quot;first graph&quot; you're referring to. You didn't
&gt; include any links.

&gt; &gt; it shows the theoretical distribution for
&gt; &gt; earth's upwelling radiation to peak around 10um, but this peak is only
&gt; &gt; about 1.3 times higher from the bottom of the graph than 15um. This is
&gt; &gt; deliberate fraud.

&gt; Deliberate fraud is a strong allegation, don't you think? Assuming
&gt; that the figure in question is anything like what I imagine, that
&gt; deliberate fraud would involve a conspiracy of thousands of
&gt; spectroscopists and other scientists going back to the 19th century.
&gt; I would think that instead of accusing the entire of scientific
&gt; community of coordinated fraud, you would instead first ask the
&gt; question, &quot;Is there perhaps a logical physical explanation for why the
&gt; spectrum of radiation looks the way it does?&quot;  It seems to be beyond
&gt; your ability to contemplate that your own thinking might be erroneous,
&gt; so others must be committing fraud.

&gt; There is likely a very logical physical explanation for whatever
&gt; figure you're talking about.  All you have to do is buy an
&gt; introductory book on atmospheric radiation and educate yourself
&gt; instead of making hysterical accusations. But I suspect you believe
&gt; the books are all fraudulent too.

&gt; &gt; The next graph, shows, 'grenhouse effect&quot;.

&gt; I don't know what &quot;next graph&quot; you're referring to.

&gt; &gt; It can be proved directly

&gt; then prove it.

&gt; &gt; that N2 gas absorbs and radiates in all
&gt; &gt; frequencies of the infrared up to about 2um.

&gt; &quot;up to&quot;?   2 um is a very short wavelength for IR.  Which side of 2 um
&gt; are you talking about?  Anything shorter than 4 um is pretty much
&gt; irrelevant to thermal emission by the earth and atmosphere.

&gt; We have weather satellites that easily observe the Earth's surface
&gt; without obstruction at 10-12 micrometers, in the absence of clouds.
&gt; If, as you say, N2  &quot;absorbs and radiates in all frequencies of the
&gt; infrared&quot;, that wouldn't be very well possible, would it?  There are
&gt; numerous IR wavelengths where satellites CAN'T see the surface.  Most
&gt; of these wavelengths are associated with water vapor absorption, whose
&gt; reality you vigorously deny.  You can tell the absorption is water
&gt; vapor, not N2, because you can see the surface from space through very
&gt; dry parts of the atmosphere but not through humid parts.  N2 exists
&gt; more or less equally everywhere.

&gt; Or are the weather satellite images fake too?  How about the satellite
&gt; sounders that use absorption/emission by CO2 to obtain temperature
&gt; profiles?  All faked?  How about the satellite sensors that have
&gt; channels scattered throughout the IR that can easily track water vapor
&gt; because of its IR emission and absorption properties?  All faked?

&gt; &gt; This is by the quantity of energy transfered by this gas to a solid
&gt; &gt; surface.

&gt; &quot;quantity of energy&quot;?  Please be more specific.  State what
&gt; measurement you would make to show this.  And any other evidence you
&gt; think you have.

&gt; &gt; This energy is not transferred by exchange of kinetic energy
&gt; &gt; in direct collisions, as is the primary basis of grenhouse theory.

&gt; I don't know what you're trying to say with this.  I haven't seen
&gt; anyone describe greenhouse theory in terms of molecular collisions.

&gt; &gt; According to the perfect gas law, which holds for all gases at low
&gt; &gt; pressure, P/V = NRT
&gt; &gt; So therefore, between 300K and 1000K,
&gt; &gt; Pressure increases, 233%, mean kinetic energy for the velocity of the
&gt; &gt; individual molecules increases 233%.
&gt; &gt; Average velocity of the individual molecules increases, 83%. Number of
&gt; &gt; collisions in unit time increases 83%.

&gt; What is the point of the above calculation?  It has no bearing on the
&gt; emission of radiation, as long as the average time between collisions
&gt; is short compared with the average time between absorbing and emitting
&gt; photons, as it always is in the lower to middle atmosphere, regardless
&gt; of temperature.

&gt; Look up &quot;local thermodynamic equilibrium&quot;.

&gt; &gt; However, according to Stefan's Law and experiment, the energy leaving
&gt; &gt; the surface of the solid substance, (like the outside of a box, or the
&gt; &gt; external metal of a cylinder of a heat engine operated with nitrogen
&gt; &gt; gas) increases 12,226%.

&gt; Which has NOTHING TO DO with collision frequencies.

&gt; &gt; PURELY MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE ENERGY IS TRANSFERED ONLY BY
&gt; &gt; COLLISIONS OF THE MOLECULES. PROOF THAT YOUR THEORY OF GASES IS
&gt; &gt; INVALID, REGARDLESS OF YOUR CONTINUED MATHEMATICAL INEPTITUDE.

&gt; Proof only in the mind of someone who has no idea what the actual
&gt; physical relationship is between molecular collisions, thermal
&gt; radiation,  and thermodynamic equilibrium.

&gt; &gt; See you in court, blowhard.
">

;&gt; Better read a book on radiation before you show up.

Reading a book will not resolve a damn thing idiot. Careful
documentation of experimental data of gases and heat energy transfered
by gases. Also careful analyses of the mathematics you use to derive
your suppositions, and your deliberate and malicious modification of
theoretical physics and chemistry to fit your fraudulent conclusions.

That is AWFUL damn funny how you idiots rely so much upon your
contemporary and communal fartations for your scientific establishment
of facts, and then claim that science is not based upon proof. So
therefore you do not need proof, and you reject proofs when they are

N2 absorbs and emits the continous spectra of infrared. This occurs at
the velocity of light. Infrared radiation therefore travels throught
the N2 gas very rapidly. But there is a big difference in the
transparency of infrared, and the visible light and near infrared.

This can be proved by many means. One of these is the fact that the
absorption and emission of these frequencies, and the density of the
energy of this radiation field, determines the temperature of the gas,
and the energy that is retained into the velocities of the molecules
as kinetic energy. This retained energy which is converted to kinetic
energy according to the velocity of an individual molecule according
to 1/2mv^2, and the kinetic energy of the rotation and any vibrations
within the molecule, compose the quantity of energy of the heat
capacity, which determines the entropy of the gas.

The velocities of the molecules and their composite momentum, result
in the pressure which the gas delivers to a surface. This pressure can
be quantified according to the mass of the molecules, their
velocities, and their density.

It is impossible that the energy that a gas delivers to a solid
substance, which is then radiated according to Stefans law, (this
energy can be collected and measured), is only transfered by
collisional transfer of the kinetic energy of the molecules. Such as
pool balls on a table. Gases, including N2 and O2, absorb and transmit
in the continous spectra of the infrared, and therefore contain a
radiation field according to their temperature.

Planck derives the mean energy of the oscillator which determines the
probability of the energy level of the oscillator to be at the time of
emission of a photon of specific energy, at particular temperature.
The electron oscillator is the electron membrane of the molecules from
the relationship of kT to hv. kT is the average kinetic energy of an
individual molecule which it posseses according to it's velocity.

See 'Atomic Physics', Max Born, chapter 1, 'kinetic theory of gases'.
Max Born was a prominent physicist of the early 20th century and a
contemporary of Planck and Einstein. He was Heisenberg's mentor out of
college.

I am still looking for the segment on 'grenhouse gases' in this book
of his in which he does a very good job documenting the development of
modern physics. I can't find Tyndell or Arthenius anywhere in this
book. Although these are the prophets that the AGWBunnies believe
brought them the holy scripture from which they must remodel human
existence according to their visions of the evil of CO2.

">

Since you obviously do not know your own basic theory, I will explain
it to you, and some of the simple points in this accounting that is
overlooked but entirely disrupts this system of addition of Wm-2.

1370Wm-2 causes a temperature of 121C to anything outside the earth's
atmosphere. Regardless of how long the object stays in the solar
constant, it's temperature will not go higher. This is because at this
temperature, the energy density of it's radiation equates to the
energy density of it's absorption.

But in grenhouse theory, the simplistic view is that the solar
constant recieved by the disk of the earth or pir^2, divided by the
sphere of the earth, or it's radiating surface, 4pir^2, results in the
average surface energy of 342. Reflected radiation is not entered into
the heat energy. Therefore, the subtracted albedo, or reflected energy
considered to be .31, results in the average surface energy to be
240Wm-2, without GHG's.

In the grenhouse model, with only O2 and N2 atmosphere, this would be
the average surface temperature, since 240Wm-2 equates according to
Boltzman Stefan to about 0F. Then it is claimed that water vapor, CO2,
methane and N20, cause retention of heat which increases the average
surface energy to 390Wm-2, which equates to about 57F an increase of
33C. This is outlined in this fundamental schematic of grenhouse
theory, climatology. This is the state of the art, climatology
analysis of their most basic premise of 'energy budget'.
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/abstracts/files/kevin1997_1.html

But notice two fatal flaws in this accounting.
One is that it allows 24Wm-2 for 'thermals' which is indicated
directly in the final 390 of surface energy.
But these thermals would exist with only O2 and N2 atmosphere.
Therefore one would have to subtract somtheing like 24 from the 240.

This would be 216. This throws their estimation for forcing of 125 to
155 way off.

In fact thenumber for radiative forcing is much farther off than this.
This energy is related to the temperature by a fourth power. So in
increasing particular temperatures around the globe, by increasing the
energy which for each case must increase by a fourth power, the actual
energy to increase the average temperature is much greater than this,
which in itself is a 63% increase in energy. This fundamental of
grenhouse theory, is entirely based upon invalid mathematics, and only
sancitioned by those idiots that have succeeded in entering public
funded academic sciences although they have no honesty or valid
mathematical skills.

They say CO2 is responsible for 32W. 1/3 of this is 11Wm-2. AGWBunnies
in falsifying their CO2 concentrations for better effect, say that CO2
is 1/3 above normal levels. WHERE THE HELL IS THE 11Wm-2 in present
temperature statistics claimed from the trace gas of CO2 by these
charlatan's and criminals of this perpetrated fraud?

A detailed analysis of the energy budget theory shows it to be invalid
on every point.

The proper revision of Hansen's falsified temperature statistics shows
1934 the warmest year, and the thirties to be warmer or about the same
as recent years. No indication yet of the 'CLIMATE CATASTROPHE' that
gets the AGWBunnies all jazed up and doing their thing of committing
Bunnie Farts in everybodies face.

Another error is that it shows 77W reflected in the atmosphere, and
30W reflected at the surface. With the GHG's in the atmosphere, it
shows 67W absorbed by atmosphere. The absorption of energy by the
atmosphere must change the albedo.
A proper study of atmospheric absorption is documented in this graph.
Notice the sun which is entirely gaseous radiaties according to
Planck's radiation law, and that the slope is a square to the
frequency.
http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/images/sunbathing/sunspectrum.htm

This study shows energy to which the atmosphere is opaque and
therefore cannot be included in the theoretical estimation of what is
albedo. It can be proved that the calculations for albedo are
theoretically derived, and not direct or valid scientific
documentation.

Well at least I have proof here of your invalid ability to do basic
physics of gases. You avoid and do not understand Stefan's Law. Also,
you have invalid application of Planck's Radiation Law. Your physics
for gases and atmosphere is completely invalid.

Also, your application of science is 'read only', and you cannot
import valid scientific analyses. You should be fired from the public
payroll. You and your creed should be brought before some court and
made to pay for your pertinent liabliltiy.

This may or may not be defined as deliberate criminal fraud. YOu could
always plead in court that you are just bone cold stupid, and that you
thought repeating what you heard and were told as you perpertrated
your fraud and embezzlement, would save you from liability.

In a simple demonstration, one could make a metal container which has
a surface area of 1 sq meter.which has a small inlet and outlet
nozzle. The container is placed in a room somewhere below 0, (so that
ambient temperature is not very relevany). Now through hoses, pure
nitrogen gas is pumped from a heater into and through the tank. One
measures the temperature of the surface of the metal of the tank. The
heating of the nitrogen gas is adusted until the metal is 300K or
about 81F. At this point, this 1 sq meter of metal is radiating from
it's entire surface, 460Wm-2. This means that 460 Joules of energy is
leaving the surface of the metal. This is better defined as,
5.67E-5 ergs, cm-2, sec-1, degK-4.

Now one again adjusts the heating of the nitrogen gas. The gas in the
system is allowed to expand, so that it remains at 1atm as the
temperature increases. The heating of the gas, which is done before
the gas is feed by the hoses into the 1 sq meter container, is
continued until the temperature of the metal reaches 1000K.

At this point, the energy leaving the surface of the metal of the
container has increased according to Stefan's Law, and quantified
according to Boltzman-Stefan equation, in simple terms,
T^4 * 5.67E-8 for, Wm-2 or,
quantity in Joules of energy leaving the surface of the metal per
second, traveling through the plane of 1 sq meter at the velocity of
light. This density of this radiation energy diminshes as an inverse
square to distance.

At this point, the 1 sq meter surface area of the container, is
radiating a total of 56,700 Joules per second. This is a 12,226%
increase in energy leaving the surface of the metal which is being
transfered to the metal by the nitrogen gas. However, the pressure of
the nitrogen gas has not changed. The pressure is a product of the
velocities, (average velocity) of the molecules and the number of
collisions in unit time.

Analysis can now be done of the energy used at the heater to heat the
gas, and the rate that the gas must transfer through the container to
maintain the temperature at 1000K. All points of this setup can be
analyzed and quantitfied, such as energy loss through the tubing as
well as collection and quantification of the energy leaving the
exterior of the metal container.

This experiment can be modified in many many ways. The question to be
answered, is by what means the ENERGY is transfered to the metal which
is then radiated away from the system. One such alteration of this, is
to replace the metal container with a basic cylinder and piston of a
heat engine. The actual energy of the composite momentum of the gas
molecules can be quantified.

Your experiment, as elaborate as it is, won't answer that question.
The energy could be transferred  by radiation, by conduction, or by a
combination of both.  In actuality, it will be almost exclusively
conduction.

What are you talking about. Spectroscopic analysis of CO2, shows dark
bands. These are at full saturation, or no transmission, at 2.7, 4.2,
and 15 um. Although it is fashionalble in contemporary grenhouse
theory to say that CO2 also radiates at these bands, this is false and
there is no evidence to support this statement.

The CO2 laser is different than the lasers of visible light, Lasers of
visible light, radiate in very specific frequencies, and their
splitting, which are lines of the principle or diffuse and sharp
spectra of the atoms.

The CO2 laser radiates in bands of many frequencies. This is called
continous spectra, or continuum of all frequencies. These frequencies
are separated by the value of hv. Each successive frequency is one
value of h greater energy, without intermediate values. This
separation, although determined theoretically according to Planck's
Law, is too minute to be observed spectroscopically.

A laser beam occurs because of absorption and emission of fhe same
frequencies. The first laser beam was built by polishing the sides of
a ruby crystal to perfect parrallel, and then coating them with silver
to make the inside of the crystal a mirror. When energy is introduced
into the crystal, the energy is radiatied according to the energy
levels of the atoms, this light is reflected between the two mirrored
sides of the crystal. The same frequency is absorbed and emitted. This
converts the energy entered into the crystal into these specific
frequencies, and these particular frequencies are amplified. A small
hole was cut into the mirrored surface on one side of the ruby
crystal. The light escaping is of the very specific frequencies of the
emission spectra, and is uniformily polarized which causes it to
travel in a beam which does not diffuse like an ordinary emission of
light with random polarization.

CO2 does not emit as an infrared laser at it's dark spectroscopic
bands. It emits around 10um. This means that in functioning as a
laser, it is absorbing and emitting at these frequencies.

Just because this is not suitable for the fraudulent theoretical
science of AGW, does not mean the rhetoric and meaningless mathematics
of this fraudulent theoretical science is correct.

This statement is absolutely, utterly, and completely false.   Just

For one thing, you say that there is &quot;no transmission&quot; at the above

that you have apparently never heard of Kirchhoff's Law, which says
that a substance in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) emits
radiation at a particular wavelength in proportion to its absorptivity
at the same wavelength.  If CO2  (at normal pressures and
temperatures, and therefore at LTE) absorbs at 15 um, it MUST also
emit at that wavelength.

As I have said many times before, countless ground-based, aircraft-
based and satellite-based measurements of the emission spectrum of the
atmosphere have been made, documented, archived, and reproduced.  ALL
of them clearly show the expected amount of emission by CO2 in the
vicinity of 15 um.

What you are doing here is no more credible than claiming that the
earth is flat, and that thousands of images of a spherical earth taken
from space are all faked.

You miss the point entirely. Energy is a quantity. Heat is only a word
of relative exchange of heat 'energy'. The law of conservation of
energy is the most basic of physics. The energy inducted into the
system can be quantified, and the energy within the system can be
quantified, and all energy can be accounted for.

Conduction means direct transfer of energy from collisions or
molecular aggitation.

Suppose you have a large gymnasium in winter that was unheated. It has
no windows but has insulated walls. On one side, it has a thin metal
plate that is in contact to the outside. The outdoor temperature is
below freezing.

Now you place an air duct from the floor on one side of the room, up
to the ceiling and over to the other side of the room where it ends
just above the metal plate which is exposed to the outside.

Just above the metal plate and just beneath the opening of the air
duct, you place a thermometer. Just below the entry to the air duct on
the other side of the room, you place a normal steam radiator. The
steam radiator and the thermometer are in direct line of site across
the large room.

Now as heat is generated by the steam radiator, it does not travel
directly across the room to the thermometer. A convection current
develops, in which the ascending warm air from the radiator goes up
the air duct and back down on the other side where it warms the
thermometer. The metal plate will remain cold, but's it's temperature
can be evaluated according to it's radiation to the outside, and
inside.

The convection is due to the expansion of the air. The amount of this
expansion is due to the increased velocities, (average velocity) of
the molecules. This expansion and the energy asscociatied with the
increased velocities, can be quantified, and is clearly evident by the
degree of convective force due to the change in density of the
expanded gas.

The energy from the radiator that is absorbed and registered in the
thermometer, is transfered by the radiation field within the gas. The
rate of velocity increase of the molecules cannot account for the
transfer of energy, and this energy does not travel directly across
the room throught the air.

&gt; &gt; One such alteration of this, is
&gt; &gt; to replace the metal container with a basic cylinder and piston of a
&gt; &gt; heat engine. The actual energy of the composite momentum of the gas
&gt; &gt; molecules can be quantified.

&gt; Which will tell you exactly nothing that you can't already determine
&gt; via more conventional measurements of temperature and pressure.

&gt; &gt; Why dont you correct your post on co2 lasers, because until then you
&gt; &gt; have no place to imply fraud as long as you neglect to correct an
&gt; &gt; incorrect statement.  You like many that think like you bully others
&gt; &gt; on this subject, but your wrong, this group is not a shool playground
&gt; &gt; to get back at the bully who took your lunch money.  Dude you are no
&gt; &gt; better than anybody else, you are a joke and you always will be,
&gt; &gt; nothing you say or call others will change that...

&gt; What are you talking about. Spectroscopic analysis of CO2, shows dark
&gt; bands. These are at full saturation, or no transmission, at 2.7, 4.2,
&gt; and 15 um. Although it is fashionalble in contemporary grenhouse
&gt; theory to say that CO2 also radiates at these bands, this is false and
&gt; there is no evidence to support this statement.

&gt; The CO2 laser is different than the lasers of visible light, Lasers of
&gt; visible light, radiate in very specific frequencies, and their
&gt; splitting, which are lines of the principle or diffuse and sharp
&gt; spectra of the atoms.

&gt; The CO2 laser radiates in bands of many frequencies. This is called
&gt; continous spectra, or continuum of all frequencies. These frequencies
&gt; are separated by the value of hv. Each successive frequency is one
&gt; value of h greater energy, without intermediate values. This
&gt; separation, although determined theoretically according to Planck's
&gt; Law, is too minute to be observed spectroscopically.

&gt; A laser beam occurs because of absorption and emission of fhe same
&gt; frequencies. The first laser beam was built by polishing the sides of
&gt; a ruby crystal to perfect parrallel, and then coating them with silver
&gt; to make the inside of the crystal a mirror. When energy is introduced
&gt; into the crystal, the energy is radiatied according to the energy
&gt; levels of the atoms, this light is reflected between the two mirrored
&gt; sides of the crystal. The same frequency is absorbed and emitted. This
&gt; converts the energy entered into the crystal into these specific
&gt; frequencies, and these particular frequencies are amplified. A small
&gt; hole was cut into the mirrored surface on one side of the ruby
&gt; crystal. The light escaping is of the very specific frequencies of the
&gt; emission spectra, and is uniformily polarized which causes it to
&gt; travel in a beam which does not diffuse like an ordinary emission of
&gt; light with random polarization.

&gt; CO2 does not emit as an infrared laser at it's dark spectroscopic
&gt; bands. It emits around 10um. This means that in functioning as a
&gt; laser, it is absorbing and emitting at these frequencies.

&gt; Just because this is not suitable for the fraudulent theoretical
&gt; science of AGW, does not mean the rhetoric and meaningless mathematics
&gt; of this fraudulent theoretical science is correct.

First of all you are discussing the basic principles of light
amplified stimulated emission radiation (laser), and I just want to
clarify that because im not sure you really understand what you are
talking about, as you are mixing some things up.  So please explain
the differences between stimulated absorption, spontaneous emission
and stimulated emission, and what conditions of population inversion,
metastable state, coherence (mirrors) must exist for the observed
stimulated emission, and finally a complete description of how the co2
laser works, showing the emitted beam from a laser is an intensified
coherent highly monochromatic beam...

If I missed your point, then it's because your point is confused, or
irrelevant, or both.  None of the thought experiments you propose have
any bearing on whether CO2 or N2 emit longwave infrared radation.  CO2
does, and N2 doesn't, period, and your continued denial of those
basic, extremely well-document facts renders your opinion on AGW
worthless.

It would help if you showed that author of the post you quoted.

While I do not agree with some of the things he rants about,
I think his stated motive is reasonable to counter the certainty with
which all things about AGW being the cause-of-all-bad-things in
weather and climate plus every other conceivable bad things to
come in the future.

The images from space can be misinterpreted, and the one
thing that bothers me about images from space is the apparent
non-differentiation between albedo and solar reflected light by
some AGW writers, they are two different and unrelated things.

Albedo arises from &quot;illumination&quot; of the surface and the
atmosphere, while reflections, especially those at high incidence
angles, are just that, reflections, and satellite images actually
attempt to avoid the reflection of the sun.

If reflection of the sun in polar regions is treated as albedo
and reflection is not calculated separately in computer models,
there could be an error of 10 watts per square meter or more.
