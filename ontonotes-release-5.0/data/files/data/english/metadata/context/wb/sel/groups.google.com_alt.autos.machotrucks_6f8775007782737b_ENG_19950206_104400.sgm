I've an 86 Cherokee with a blown engine, tranny, vac/elec/epa system.
(All from a bad rebuild shop that trashed my Jeep) But the body is cherry.
I've also a 76 Scout with a great 345, frame, tranny, ect. (but anyone who
has e-maild me knows the body is 90% rust) My idea is to put the body of the
Cherokee on the Scout frame. A good friend will do all the custom welding,
and I'll do the wireing. The only problem is getting the 345 to nuzzle under
the Jeep's 6 banger hood. If anyone has tried one of these &quot;can't be
done&quot; projects, I'd love to hear from you.
