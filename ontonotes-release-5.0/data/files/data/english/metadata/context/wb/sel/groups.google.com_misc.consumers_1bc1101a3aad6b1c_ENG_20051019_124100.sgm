&gt; Associated Press

&gt; DALLAS - American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have used
&gt; advertising campaigns, catchy slogans and dueling consultant studies
&gt; to settle a dispute over air service in North Texas, and now their
&gt; eye-gouging fight has spilled over to an online encyclopedia.

&gt; Someone using an Internet service provider registered to American
&gt; edited online encyclopedia Wikipedia last week to describe Southwest
&gt; Airlines Co. as &quot;a notoriously litigious company constantly seeking to
&gt; change laws to gain an advantage.&quot;

&gt; For a time, the site also said Dallas-based Southwest is &quot;known for
&gt; its PR machine and litigious nature.&quot;

&gt; Wikipedia's volunteer monitors deleted the phrases within hours and
&gt; traced them to someone using a domain registered to American, a unit
&gt; of Fort Worth-based AMR Corp.

&gt; Tim Wagner, a spokesman for American, said the changes were &quot;not
&gt; something the company initiated or condone.&quot; He said American doesn't
&gt; have an employee or contractor by the name of the person who sent the
&gt; changes to Wikipedia.

&gt; The scrap played out on a Wikipedia entry on the Wright Amendment, a
&gt; 1979 law that limits long-haul flights from Southwest's home at Dallas
&gt; Love Field. Southwest is lobbying Congress to repeal the law, but
&gt; American is trying to block the move.

&gt; Ed Stewart, a spokesman for Southwest, said his airline would accept
&gt; American's explanation that it had nothing to do with the posting but
&gt; still wants to know who made the comments. He bristled at Southwest
&gt; being called litigious.

&gt; Although Love Field was the subject of many lawsuits before Congress
&gt; passed the Wright Amendment, &quot;there has been no litigation in this
&gt; latest fight,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;And in the earlier litigation, why was
&gt; it that Southwest won every case?&quot;

&gt; The Wikipedia entry on the Wright Amendment had changed again by
&gt; Monday. Wagner, the American spokesman, complained that the latest
&gt; version contained errors and derogatory language about American and
&gt; its ally in the anti-repeal effort, Dallas-Fort Worth International
&gt; Airport, which stands to lose flights and passengers if Southwest
&gt; expands at Love Field.

&gt; For example, Wagner pointed to Wikipedia's description of Southwest's
&gt; pro-repeal Web site as &quot;user-friendly,&quot; while an opposing site created
&gt; by DFW Airport &quot;appears to be as closed-ended as the airport is at
&gt; times.&quot; The encyclopedia also refers to American's dominance at DFW
&gt; Airport as a &quot;chokehold.&quot;

&gt;&quot;It's not the most objective of Web sites. Obviously that's language
&gt; you wouldn't find in a normal encyclopedia,&quot; Wagner said.

&gt; Still, American is concerned because Wikipedia turns up prominently
&gt; when Web surfers enter &quot;Wright Amendment&quot; on Google or other Internet
&gt; search engines. Anyone can add or edit entries to the
&gt; information-sharing site without having to prove they are an expert on
&gt; the topic.

&gt;&quot;We have no idea who they are,&quot; said Danny Wool, a Wikipedia editor,
&gt; adding that the site wouldn't disclose a user's identity anyway. He
&gt; compared the site's anonymity to news reporters who protect the
&gt; identity of confidential sources.

Wikipedia founder Jim Jimmy &quot;Jimbo&quot; Wales is/was the owner/ CEO of porn

search engine Bomis.com. That may also explain why Wikipedia is such a
libel machine in which &quot;contributor&quot; gangs have the only saying as e.g.

the gang supporting Tilman Hausherr or Marty Sharp of Chillicothe, MO
64601.

Wikipedia's &quot;Monitor Hall&quot; applies Wikipedia &quot;policies&quot; only for the
advantage of their &quot;contributing&quot; gang members and deletes any
information that reveals their &quot;contributors&quot; as the lawless people or
criminals as they are. &quot;Monitor Hall&quot; suppresses any speech that he
does not like and abuses his Wikpedia &quot;monitor&quot; postition. &quot;Monitor
Hall's&quot; Wikipedia profile says that he is a Canadian living in Liberty
Lake, Washington, who is mainly interested in sport and entertainment,
which means that he is not even qualified to edit information on me. I
hope that Wikipedia and their gang contributors are being sued for
Millions of Dollars by their victims. People who go to Wikipedia for
education purposes are fools!
They block people who they libel in articles. That is Wikipedia's way
to deal with freedom of speech. They lie and plot that a person
violated the rules and block her to post the facts. Wikipedia is not
just not fair but anti-democratic.

Marty Sharp lives at home with his dad but often posts from Olathe,
KS. He stole the ID's of many people and forged them on his website.
Sharp posts with &quot;Simkatu&quot; or &quot;Anus Simkatu&quot; (Yuk!) on Usenet and stole

the ID &quot;Vivaldi&quot; to spread lies about me on Wikipedia. Geocities just
canceled his criminal website  http://www.geocities.com/martysharpgolf/ .

The police chief of Chillicothe, MO, is very interested in any
information on Marty Sharp.
http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;q=simkatu&amp;qt_s=Search
Sharp/Sinkatu defames, libels, harasses and stalks anti-suicide
encouragement activist Patrick Sullivan and me in mentally retarted and

insulting websites, and Sharp blocks the domains in which we live that
we can't read his libel, so the corrupt fool thinks.
One day Sharp/Simkatu/&quot;Vivaldi&quot; claims to be a mechanical engineer,
another a day he claims to be a bioengineer, a biomedical engineer and
a member of the Biomedical Engineer Society. Lol!

Gosh that is pretty extreme. It is so extreme it is hard / impossible
to believe. Do you have an axe to grind or something? I find the
site very valuable and amazingly complete. Much better than an
encyclopedia.

It would be pretty easy to find out wheher the node in the AMR

I agree with the corporate firewalls argument, they're pretty tough
these days.... Wikipedia is an interesting concept, and certainly a
comment on where society is technologically... BUT, as someone already
said, it can be skewed one way or the other, and is definitely not a
reliable source of info on a contentious issue like Wright!

I agree, this sounds pretty far fetched to me--firewalls at major
corporations are pretty intense and don't really lend themselves to
things like that...

Wikipedia is an interesting resource (and comment on where society is
technologically), but certainly not a replacement for solid news
sources, especially on a contentious issue like Wright!

Moreover, &quot;contributor&quot; gangs determine who can write on Wikipedia and
who not. They also determine what information is deleted and the
deleted information is most of the time the objective one.

Wikipedia is crap. People who go there for education purposes are

Just about anything in the public eye will have nay-sayers. I don't
need to search for &quot;wikipedia sucks&quot; because I've been to wikipedia
before and know, without a doubt, it does not.
