A Brief History of the Karamanoglu Empire, Part VII: Cennet Þafak

[For Bruce. Because we can't keep the fine silver in forever.]

1476-1500

The Konya that the siblings returned to on their father's death had
changed radically from their childhood. The city where Paul preached,
with its Doric columns was of course, long gone. Though the hippodrome
plan survived, that city had been supplanted in the early years of the
dynasty by the Çiçek Palace and the Müþfik Mosque on the hill at
the city center. Though the 'city' surpassed Constantinople in size
during the early years of the Crocus Era, it swelled to over 500,000,
spilling over the city walls in the final years of Uemit Mihram's
reign. For the first time since the Sack of Baghdad, a Muslim ruler
presided over the largest city west of China. At the same time that
Konya surpassed one half million, the cities conquered by the Sultana
not only reached their former numbers, but began renewal. Cairo,
Baghdad, and Isfahan all appear to have reached some 250,000
inhabitants in this era, with Rayy, Shiraz, Basra, and Mosul at around
150,000 at the same time. These were the same cities that had had the
oldest and largest batmasihane and bahrihane.

It is little surprise that a Scientific Revolution emerged in the
context of the largest, most literate empire since the Abbasid
Caliphate; while some attribute this to the
Empire's heterodoxy of peoples and the pax Karmanica granted it a
unique position for science to flourish under the relaxed Sufi
atmosphere while Europe was trod underfoot by the Church. A simpler
explanation would be this: as the crossroads between Europe and Asia,
the Karamans were able to take and repackage much of the technology and
thought processes from Europe, China, and India to produce a unique
combination without having to do much original work themselves. This
theory is, in part driven by the development of the Scientific
Revolution in Europe revolving around clocks and
gears-correspondingly, too much is made of the prevalence of
clockwork in the mosques built by the Sultana and her successors.
Another mountain sculpted from a molehill is the network of semaphores,
observatories, as well as the dissections by Djamal Esophikian during
the Greek War.

This sort of thinking suggests that the Muslims could not have achieved
a Scientific Revolution on their own, despite the prior "Renaissance
of Islam" and the genius for war that the Karamans showed with great
regularity. Additionally, it ignores the critical pre-scientific
revolutionary precepts that the Sufi Orders and their prominence in
society; though the Society of the Rosy-Cross would later carry similar
activities in Europe, it went too far into Aristotelian blind alleys.
The Sufi belief that to know the world was to know God, and thus reach
the state of Union and Extinction longed for, led to three precursors
to a scientific revolution. First, their careful observation of the
natural world. Second, their methodical and meticulous recording of the
results of these observations. Third, publication and dissemination
thereof, including long-term archiving for future observers and
researchers.

This trend was fueled, in particular, by the interest of the Sufi
orders in the stars and planets. The invention of the sextant and the
telescope on the eve of the reign of the Sultana allowed the pirs, in
particular Ufuk Müjd, to elaborate on "The Tables of Toledo" over
nearly fifty years. His meticulous tables of the movements of the moon,
sun, the stars, and the planets were built on by Mihram Hafyz to create
excellent theories of prediction and force. They both had the benefit
of a society that had no issue with a heliocentric worldview-it was
already popularly accepted by the time they produced their works.

Djamal Esophikian is often removed from this trend and claimed as an
early harbinger of the Scientific Revolution in Europe for his
correspondence with his cousins in Paris and London. However, it should
be recalled that he worked with the Sufis who served as Karaman shock
troops and was no stranger to the way the society he lived in.
Accordingly, he is an excellent example of pre-scientific revolutionary
thought.

During the sanguine Greek War, he was attached to the Bulgarian Court,
and took the opportunity to dissect hundreds of corpses. He
methodically collated the results into a massive book, beautifully
illustrated with meticulously accurate plates. The first three copies
were given to the Tsar of Bulgaria, the Tsaritsa of Serbia, and the
Sultan in Konya to celebrate the end of the war. The book was soon
copied all over the empire due to the interest of several pirs; copies
appeared in Venice by 1450. Esophikian is often discounted for failing
to offer new ideas about anatomy or physiology; his divergences from
Galen made him disregarded in Europe until the time of Vesalius. But in
the Karaman Empire, within a quarter century of its publication, the
text was available at every batmasihane and bahrihane. At Cairo's
Bahrihane, Ahmad Khalidi, an engineering student, looked at the plates
and saw valves and pumps. Contemporaneously, Benjamin of Aleppo began
his famous "Anatomy and Theories of the Body of Man" by bribing
Dawoud Pasha to dissect the bodies of criminals. It was not until the
following century, though, that someone was able to dissect heads in
conjunction with Benjamin's earlier work, but between these two,
modern physiology was born.

7.2 People Power

Thought the ground had been prepared for these things to come, and the
empire at the time of Ender's arrival in Konya was on the edge of
transformation, many, if not most historians, confuse the pirs and the
dynasty with the population at large, which was much less interested
and receptive to this sort of thought, or the increasingly open-ended
Islam derived from Ibn Arabi. At this time, the population of the
Anatolian hinterland became fully Islamicized, and did not like the
empty gestures from the capital when they were on the border with
Byzantium, waging jihad. Likewise, the Shi'a in Persia took little
comfort in the peace the Sultan offered, unhappy to suffer the rule of
Sunnis who would not allow the celebration of Ghadr al-Khoom. The
hardened warriors who were led by the Wolf Sword likewise despised the
soft Islam of the capital as they waged war against the Ethiopian
Emperor. The Wolf Sword, heroic veteran of the wars with Jaish Allah,
the pirates, and the Ethiopians, was battle worn, having lost an arm,
an eye, and was scarred all over. At the age of fifty-seven, he was
feeling all his wounds; though he would have fallen under the influence
of hookah and hash, his grandmother's strick upbringing encouraged
him instead to turn to his faith. If he had been at home, he would have
found a Sufi pirs to guide him to serenity.

In the sun-seared deserts and wind burnt mountains he found the hardy,
harsh faith of Habib Aidid. Having begun his life as a simple soldier
in the war in Ethiopia, he found God after receiving a grievous wound
that nearly took his life and left him blind. Building on the works of
Ibn Tammiyyah and Ibn Hamza, he created a movement one might call
Salifi; aiming, as many reform movements in Islam did, to return to the
early life of the people of Medina. Aidid's work stressed the unity
and unknowableness of God (tawhid), demanding the expansion of the
Greater Jihad, [1] and brought the idea of kafir to the forefront. Used
originally as a tactic in the wars in the Horn of Africa to dispossess
Christians, Aidid honed this concept such that non-compliament Muslims
could be cast out of the House of Islam, their property and their lives
forfeit. He objected to the proliferation of alcohol, the eating of
shellfish, smoking, and the production of art. Most alarmingly, he
looked upon Sufis as practitioners of shirk, polytheism, who must be
put to death. His ascetic interpretation of Islam caught on with the
soldiers on the march, not only for its hard-bitten style, but for
Aidid's marvelous oratory, conducted on Fridays as well as in open
fields on the campaign.

To Ender, he made it possible to overcome the pain that was part of his
daily life as well as the disappointment that such a warrior had been
borne no sons. While Karaman Islam tended to discourage polygamy, Aidid
preached that Sunni Muslims should be fruitful and multiply-to
prevent being outreproduced by the fecund Shi'a, the Jews, and above
all, the Christians-which led to Ender taking his second, third, and
fourth wives, who bore him twelve sons, while his first wife was cast
aside.

This array, backed by camels and elephants, arrived in Konya in 1476 to
be dismayed by the laxity and corruption of the city. Aidid and his
apostles took to some of the mosques associated with the Hanbalis,
though were denied to the Cathedral Mosques at the cardinal points in
the city; many soldiers preached in markets, combated booksellers, and
incited riots against the Jews and Christians in the financial quarter.

Early on, many were arrested, and some were, in the words of the later
movement "martyred" by crowds that reacted to their bullying ways.
Nonetheless, the movement became popular, in part as a consequence of
their free use of the Sultan's escutcheon. In retrospect, historians
have pointed to the issues that year in feeding Konya, issues with
urban order, and the growing mass of displaced poor due to attempts at
tax farming and enclosures which turned state lands into private
property. This discounts entirely the reports of Aidid's charm and
charisma, which brought many people to his sermons.

So, within four years of his arrival in the capital, attacks were
launched on the batmasihane and bahrihane, the judges and the pirs were
driven out. Aidid and his disciples were installed in their place, and
many of the institutions that should have presided over the Scientific
Revolution were crippled and destroyed or driven from the public
square, denied finances.

Mulk's writing for 'princes.' While he does spill a lot of ink
regarding resisting temptation and piety, it is the lesser jihad for a
leader, who must defend the community, etc. This follows an arc of
literature back to the Crusader era sermons from Damascus, and back
from there the Spanish 'Tenets of the Lesser and Greater Jihad' which
goes back to the Kitab il-Jihad, which was written during the first war
against the Byzantines. It's an alternative, often particularist
interpretation of the text; Mulk's interpretation, in particular, is
dubious, but it's taken hold in a big way in the Karaman state, though
it doesn't always manifest itself.

Aidid's reactionary brand is something like OTL's Salafi and the branch
of Wahhabism favored by the House of Saud, which should be fairly
obvious.

It's got other oddities that will rear their heads later.

Question, though: given the economic importance

really take hold at this point? ISTM it would
upset too many apple carts not to provoke an

Aidid may be, the movement needs an opening wedge.
Look at the Nazis - despite Hitler's abilities,
they got nowhere to speak of till the Depression
broke down the old regime.

If there was something else going on here -
a major plague outbreak or famine or earthquake -
or a political death-match feud in the imperial
court - that would create the opening. Say, a major
Shi'a rebellion, the ruling faction moves to
conciliate, and Aidid rides a wave of anti-Shi'a
sentiment.

It's a form of revivalism that pops up throughout Islamic history,
sometimes for no particular reason. The basic 'reformist' flavor of it
is pretty common place. The other stuff is a cludge of the sorts of
Islam that becomes engendered when Islamic polities are at war with
Christian or other polities; some of it is borrowed from the populist
Islam of Outremer-era Damascus, some from the first Ummayid Caliphate,
and some from the Almoravids.

Additionally, as I noted in passing, there's a wide gap between 'court'
Islam in the Karaman state and populist Islam. While Anatolia initially
favored Rumi-style mysticism and Alevi Islam took hold in OTL, there's
a sooner and deeper influx of Orthodox Sunnis into the Empire, more and
more different holy war, as well as the fact the state has been ruled
by a woman, and that the state espouses a particularist interpretation
of ibn Arabi's Bezzles of Wisdom and other works; to an illiterate
peasant and a lot of Muslims, it'll look heretical after a while. You
just need someone to whisper trouble to get these people up in arms.

I hinted again with the urbanization of the empire; modeling from
Goldstone's "Revolt and Rebellion in the Early Modern World" which has
a chapter on semi-religious revolts in interior Anatolia that ended up
entangled in population concerns.

Additionally, I admit that I cut a paragraph that went into greater
detail about the specific relationship, which I forgot to replace with
a sentence or two.

Mind you, you're reading a gloss; I ended up editing out a three page
thing about the retreat of the Sufis to the mountain fastness. And
whatever the Shia, Jews, Christians, and Zoaroastrians have to say,
they're still in dhimmi, so, ni modo.

Part of this is inverting the experience of Mehmet IV with Yegen Osman
such that they work together.

Fair enough; I'll admit here that I cut part of the longer introduction
to this section that discussed the difficulties of the latter reign of
Ender's father. I didn't want to exceed five pages on any of these, so
mistakes are made instead.

While it wasn't any of these in particular, there was some tax farming
and corruption related to the urbanization that I went into, and then
dropped for lack of good data to flesh it out well.

That wasn't clear. It's been a long time since
the last installment, and the use of colorful
nicknames is confusing. Colorful, but confusing.

Also, the arrival of Aidid and his allies at
Konya wasn't portrayed as "the return of the
Sultan to his capital". Why would the Sultan
want to bring his whole army to the capital?

Unless there is overt rebellion, the army belongs
at the frontier, guarding against external foes,
or off duty at home, not hanging around the
capital region, sucking down pay and making a
mess. (50,000 men and as many beasts create a lot
of dung and garbage, trample a lot of gardens, etc.)

Let's say the Sultan has plans for drastic social
and religious reforms; historically, such monarchs
tend to assume that their decrees will just be
obeyed, and rebellion comes later. Pre-emptive
military occupation os just about unheard of.

Also, ISTM that what was happening was mob action
against the schools, the Sufis, and the giaours:
if Aidid had the Sultan's ear, the program would
be official and top-down - or at least half so.
There didn't seem to be the official part of the
program that I would expect.

The collateral damage from the mob action would
generate political pressure to quash the movement.
If the Sultan was minded to ignore this pressure,
he'd be so committed to the program that he would
be implementing it officially - which I didn't see.

Unless the Sultan is some sort of lightweight -
but this Sultan isn't.

The last episode marked the death of the 'Ghazi' Sultan, who attempted
to snuff out Byzantium with the help of his brothers-in-law, the Tsars
of Serbia and Bulgaria. The man lived a life of thwarted ambition
thereafter, with a fair amount of smoking and wine drinking,
corruption, tax farming, and messy urbanization.

The Kirt Kilich, his eldest son, Prince Ender, is the hero of the end
of the last part of the story. Defeated Arab rebels and pirates in
Yemen, protected the vassal state of Abel against Ethiopia which
resulted in a civil war there, with TBD results.

By the time he got the capital, as I mentioned, he was in his mid
fifties, and used up from a long life ahorse and asail.

Accordingly, he's got a large vanguard to protect him from would-be
assassins, and lots of annoying hangers on who expect goodies when his
dad dies.

His arrival in Konya would give him control of whatever the city
constabulary is, blah blah.

It's not so much an occupation as a victorious march up from the south,

S'ok. But true,

"free use of the Sultan's escutcheon"

doesn't sound like "official backing of the Sultan".
Also, ISTM, the program would be implemented in

Well, he strikes me as a forceful personality, not

If he wants it done, he'll order it done explicitly.

But pay no attention to the rantings from the

That's what I wanted it to mean; I had a whole legal process worked
out, and then, sort of lost the notebook.

An Islamic state where ibn Arabi's Sufism is the norm that has
something like institutionalized regional law will look extremely
different from the Sheikh al-Islam in the Ottoman Empire; as a gift of
the Kanuni, the Sheikh was always a nice rabid Sunni.

Without the Savafids, that's going to be less a going concern.

Ender is not entirely stupid; he lends his name to things that Aidid
launches popularly. Who exactly holds the Cathedral Mosques, I left
unsaid, as those positions rise and fall with the Sultan, though are
approved like Bishops in the Anglican Church.

The Historiography of this particularly unhappy event is fraught, I'm
afraid.

&gt; &gt;Ender's a mixed bag; his youth made him a military hero like Henry V,
&gt; &gt;but in old age, he was rather less happy, and it's unclear to
&gt; &gt;historians whether or not Aidid controlled him, or was highly
&gt; &gt;suggestive enough to generate the results that Aidid needed.
&gt; Well, he strikes me as a forceful personality, not
&gt; someone to be led by the nose, or to be a human pillow -
&gt; bearing the mark of the last person to sit on him.
&gt; If he wants it done, he'll order it done explicitly.

Folly a deux; Aidid aids and abets Ender's darker demons. Kissinger to
Ender's Nixon, as it were. Though no Starbuck to his Ahab.

Thanks, I try.

It's weird doing this so detached this far out. It's obviously highly
fictional at this point.

This post, for example, started out being entirely about the Scientific
Revolution that the Karamans enjoy, before I decided to kick it down
the road. It wasn't a direction I intentionally planned for the TL, but
it seems like an obvious consequence of the prominence of this
particularly "naturalist" brand of Sufism, as does the tension between
that and an orthodox Sunni arrangement; things will get tangled as the
Shi'a Sufis emerge during the next century and the Astronomical branch
of the Revolution. Though I get to skip past the heliocentric issues.

Part of me wants to break mode and do an episode on Europe, because
it's a really weird and different place. I may do an interlude set in
1550 or so, to cover the impact of the Karaman Scientific Revolution on
Europe, though I fear that fine-tooth vision of Europe is going to
elude me, in the end. The ripples of the Ottomans, no Ottomans, and
thus the Karamans, are too numerous and messy to accurately measure all
of.

Thoughts, Uncle Syd?

Yeah - all one can do is generate a plausible narrative.

But then either one stays conservative, to avoid the
incorporation of wildcards that are wishful thinking,
or risks turning the TL into a wank of some sort.

I assume that I've proved "plausible" so far.

I try to vary my wild cards--such as the Civil War that ended with the
rise of the Sultana--but Aidid is the second sort of Sunni
fundamentalism that I've injected into the TL. I'll probably retire
this for a while in favor of Red Hats and other such things.
