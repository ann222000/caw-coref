Hi,

I have MacMini with only one hard drive.
Is it possible to split the hard drive into two partitions?

Disk Utility says that &quot;The disk contains the startup and can't be
partitioned&quot;.

I doesn't matter if I have to erase the HD, I just want to split it ... It
is possible?

First, why partition it? for most setups it's unnecessary any more, and
can be quite wasteful of the available space.

If you really want to, then you'll need to reboot from the system disk,
and then use Disk Utility from there. You will of course lose any data
that is on the disk.

FWIW, I believe 10.5 can repartition without losing data.

It is possible. You need to boot up on something other than the drive
you want to partition. I have to ask, though: Why would you want to do
that?

Why do you want to do that?  What advantage do you expect to have by
keeping them on a second partition?

I can only think of a disadvantage - increased likelihood of running out
of space on either of the two partitions, leaving you to having to
repartition again.

That'll be a problem as soon as either your OS and home directories or
your media library grow beyond the artificially small space you've given
them. While I'm not generally a fan of the &quot;space is cheap&quot; mantra, this
is one of the scenarios where I think it's a good answer.

Get a 500GB FireWire drive and dedicate the internal drive to non-media
files. Or even better, ignore the internal drive completely. One of the
easiest (as compared to cheapest) performance upgrades for a mini is to
boot from an external FW drive. You have more performance, more space
and less heat.

Why do you want to put all your movies and music on another partition,
though?

You've created limitations where there were none. As soon as one of
those partitions fills up to capacity, you'll find yourself wishing you
hadn't done it.

RE:

than the drive
you want to partition. I have to ask, though: Why would you
want to do
that? &gt;&gt;

I have a 24&quot; white Intel iMac that I use for audio recording
and editing.

I've partitioned the internal hard drive into several
partitions, including a large &quot;boot partition&quot; and 3 small
(8gig) &quot;project&quot; partitions.

This way, I keep all my audio production files &quot;together&quot; in
a single partition, which I can then optimize without
affecting _other_ partitions.

One of the standard recommendations I've seen re audio (and
video) production is, &quot;don't use the same drive for both
your system/apps and your sound files&quot;.

The &quot;project partition&quot; concept works fine for me. In fact
it seems to work _better than_ using two drives on my older
g4. I record using a Presonus Firebox (firewire) interface
and have had virtually no input problems (cracks, pops,
etc.) since moving over to the iMac.

But then again, I also believe in defragmenting/disk
optimization, as well. Guess I'm in the minority in that
respect. But that, too, works for me. Others' mileage may
vary... :)

">

Let's be generous: it was useful up to Mac OS 8.0, if you had a large
hard drive and wanted to avoid wasting too much space due to lots of
small files and HFS block sizes getting too big. With 8.1 and HFS+ that
reason went away.

It might also be useful in the Mac OS X era if you want multiple
bootable Mac OS X systems. Apart from that, I haven't bothered for my
main drives.

I partition my backup drives for the same reason - multiple bootable
clones, possibly based on different versions of Mac OS X. It is also a
handy way to limit Time Machine's growth on a backup drive.

If is an Intel Mini, get a male/female Sata plug or a male to female
Sata cable and connect a full size 7200 rpm 300+gb Sata2 drive (about
$50-60 used now) for lots of storage space and sell of that toy hard
drive.  Your Mini will run cooler without that heat generator in there.
While you're at it, toss the slot loading optical drive and replace it
at 1/3 the price you can sell the optical drive for (you'll need a
USB/firewire external drive for that as well but that should only be
$10-15 used for USB or a little more for firewire.  The slot loading
drives tend to die a lot faster than the full size ones.  And make sure
you have a backup system that works.  And you use it.  Then you'll be
set.  OS X goes into meltdown so rarely, partitioning is almost never
used any more.  This ain't Windows baby.

Not that there's any problem whatsoever with the temperature in the
first place and, as a bonus, your brand new mini's warranty will be null

Interesting thread and now I've got a question.  I'm using a Mac Pro with
Leopard and I've used Boot Camp to install Windows XP on another drive.  Can
I dump XP and install Mac Classic (OS-9)?  I'm not sure if it will run on an
Intel machine but it certainly would serve the purpose I'm using XP for...

Yes. I'd say that someone's evaluation of the &quot;capacity of most
functioning adults&quot; is *WAY* off. Anyway, it doesn't correspond to my
observation. He must live in a pretty insular environment. Don't forget
to factor in that, by definition, you would be talking the first time of
opening the case for 99.99...% of them; such things are always harder
the first time before you can really see how it all goes (The nice
photos on the web aren't a substitute).

I've done quite a lot of work on the inards of computers (including
replacing the ac-in board on my daughter's PowerBook pro - now that one
was a PITA; made me appreciate why Apple would have charged me $700).
But I haven't opened either of my minis. I've seen the photos and
suspect I could do it, but I decided it would be enough bother that I'd
do what I could to avoid having to. That mostly  meant being sure that I
ordered a configuration that woiuld meet my plausibly projected needs
without having to crack (so to speak :-)) the case.

Admitedly, it is probably a lot easier if you don't care whether or not
you break the case latches in the process, which brings up...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Amen. I've bought two minis at various times. Both of them are used in
places where keeping the case open would be an absolute bar. With the
case closed, the mini is reasonably resistant to such things as
children's inquisitive fingers. Sure, there are things that they could
do, but it is resistant to at least basic poking and such things as
ketchup spills (soft drinks would be worse). WIth the case open... well,
the lifetime of the system sure isn't going to be determined by failures
from over-temperature. It will die from other causes long before then.

Let me guess, &quot;functioing adults&quot; almost never have children around,
right? :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Neither of my minis has show the leat sign of temperature (or any other)
problems, and I've had them both quite a while. My impression was that
my experience in that was typical.

&gt; Scanners are very inexpensive these days; they are commodity items--and

That's likely what I'll do yet this one had a few features which aren't all
that common today.  Designed for negatives/slides (I still take slides) and
the holder works wonderful.

I can't imagine wanting to do that on a Mini, but with my old Digital

I could also see wanting to experiment with ZFS as a reason, but that's

Trouble is, things kept getting more integrated - many applications

I'm new to Macs, and my Unix experience has been limited to mainframes

I help administer some linux systems at work. Partitioning for Unix
systems has been done for facilitating backups and to help manage the
various file systems involved in a typical Unix configuration.

Backups are usually done by partition. If you put stuff that doesn't
change (software applications and libraries) in one partition, and
stuff that does change (user files) in another partition, you can do
frequent backups on the rapidly-changing stuff and less frequent
backups on the more static stuff. If it is all in one, big partition,
the backup software will have to do a scan on the entire disk drive to
find out what has changed.

Another reason is to manage partition mounts. In a typical Unix system
environment NFS mounts are used to share common software and user files
among several machines. Having various types of file systems in their
own partitions affords flexibility in selecting what files are
available on any given machine.

Our Unix systems typically have partitions for 1) booting the machine,
2) local system files, 3) local user accounts, 4) shared software, and
5) shared user directories, 6) shared project data, and 7) temporary
working space (that doesn't get backed up).

The problem is that VueScan is very hit or miss.  People that do use it
have a habit of keeping old binaries around, because sometimes a

Cooler temperatures can slow the migration of metals from cathodes to
anodes, but if it's the difference between 500 and 1000 years, who cares?

Failure can result from the runaway of a leaky junction.  A few come
from the factory leaky.  Running them cool can extend their lives, but
they're likely to fail before long anyway.

At 150 C, you might have a significant number of leaky junctions in ICs
that would last indefinitely at 50 C.  There might be half as many
failures at 140 C as 150 C, but I wonder if there would be a difference
between 20 and 30 C.

Suppose there were a difference.  Some devices using the PPC G4 CPU are
advertised with a MTBF of 30 years.  If that's at 30 C, should I hope to
get 42 years at 20 C?

In my experience, failed solder joints are a big killer of electronics.
Heating and cooling can fatigue joints.  Running with a big fan and
the box open could reduce the peak temperature.  Could it also cause
rapid changes (reductions) in temperature?  Vibration can fatigue solder
joints, so I would be wary of vibration from a fan.

Much less than that. It would probably triple the lifespan of most of

Many Minis run way hotter than mine.  Compare here:
http://www.intelmactemp.com/list?v_model=mac-mini&amp;sort;=hddsize
Mine is the only one with the 320gb hard drive.  And of course the
lowest temps by far.  It should be at the top as its sorted by hard
drive size, largest to smallest.  When you feel the air blow off my
heatsink it feels the same as the ambient air.  That's cooling that
works.  I can't imagine how well it would work if it had a decent
heatsink on there.  Then you could use the fan at 5 volts at any load
for total inaudible operation.

Do they mean 15-30?  If so, that is the temperature range, not the

drive ranges between an average temperature of 15-30....
I always thought an average is a single figure and a range has 2
figures.

It is referring to various SMART parameters, each of which is a counter
which records unusual events of a particular type that the drive has
noticed.

They are comparing the average failure rate of drives which have not
counted any events in a particular SMART parameter (zero count) with
those which have had at least one event counted in the same SMART
parameter (non-zero count).

In other words, they are looking at how many drives failed which had no
recorded errors of a particular type, compared to drives which had
recorded the same error.

Again, this is referring to a particular SMART parameter (scan errors).
The drive scans itself in the background automatically and records any
errors it finds. (See section 3.5.1.) You don't need to do anything to
activate this mechanism - the drive will do it automatically.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;Previous studies have indicated that temperature deltas as low as
&gt; 15C can nearly double disk drive failure rates&quot;
&gt; What is a temperature delta? Is that a temperature range?
">

Delta means difference. This is saying that at some point on the
temperature scale they observed a doubled rate of drive failures for a
temperature change of 15C.

Looking at figure 4, it shows a failure rate of 7% +/- 0.5% at 20C, and
2% at 35C. Seems more like triple the number of errors to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In Figure 4 its mentions Probability Density.  What is that?
">

This is referring to the histogram on the graph. It shows the
distribution of samples at various temperatures. If you add the height
of all the bars, using the scale on the left margin, you will get 1.00.

The probability density is the proportion of the total samples which
were at that temperature. Note that the error (vertical lines on each
sample of average failure rate) increase as the number of samples drops:
they get more accurate figures for average failure rate if there are a
greater number of samples at a particular temperature.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In Figure 5 it shows average drive temperatures of
&gt; (15,30)
&gt; (30,35)

Not quite. Look closely: it is &quot;[15, 30)&quot; for example.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; up to 45
&gt; Do they mean 15-30?
">

Yes. This is a standard mathematical notation for a range. Square
brackets and parentheses represent a closed or open end of the range. A
square bracket means the range includes that value, a parenthesis means
the range includes everything less (or greater than) that value. Thus
&quot;[15, 30)&quot; means &quot;greater than or equal to 15 and less than 30&quot;.

The various shades of grey represent all drives which had an average
temperature within the specified range. For example, the black bars are
all drives with an average temparature between 15C (inclusive) and 30C
(exclusive). It is then measuring average failure rates of drives at
various ages, noting in particular that older drives are more likely to
fail at higher temperatures, while newer drives are more likely to fail
at lower temperatures.

So how does one access SMART info?  Where is it recorded?  I'm sure most
of us would like to see if there are any errors that SMART is detecting.
And will Disk Utility pick up SMART errors?  If not, what is the best
way of reading them?

That would indicate that once again you want a well ventilated case.
Wide temperature ranges are most likely caused by heat generated within
the case.  I don't think many of us work in ambient temperatures of 40C
or more yet many hard drives are working in that range - then they get
turned off.  Then turned on.  That sounds like its not good.  On the
other hand, people that don't use their computers in a climate
controlled environment, have wider temperature deltas/ranges too,
especially in winter sometimes with drafts.

I guess this was a technical paper.  Still one wonders why people don't
use plain English when its obviously sufficient for adequately
describing the situation.  (15-30) everybody understands.  Using square
brackets and commas just carves that down to a small minority.

Thanks David for a great little tutorial.

I guess I harp on about this so much because its so easy to cool a
component very close to ambient room temperature.  That means
consistency in temperatures.  Which seems to be good.

&gt; Not beyond what S.M.A.R.T. reports.

So when I verify a hard drive or partition in Disk Utility, it will tell
me any and all SMART error?

I was pretty bad in physics!  But later, in practical terms (when I used
the info) I really loved it.  Just had a hard time understanding it
initially.  And no calculus at all.  Thankfully people help other people
out.  A long time ago, using basic physics, I built some audio
components that were far better than the store bought competition - Mine
sold well.  But granted, it was basic stuff.

Judging from the temperature readings posted by Mac users, their hard
drives are not going to last anywhere near their potential lifespan
because of huge fluctuations in temperature between off and on.  Or
ambient air and the temperature under heavy load.
