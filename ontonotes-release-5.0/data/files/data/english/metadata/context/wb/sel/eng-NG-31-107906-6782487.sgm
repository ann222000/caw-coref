Happy holidays,

Anyone have any helpful suggestions for changing the headlamp bulbs
(both sides) in a '98 Explorer EB AWD vehicle?  That is anything besides
"be careful NOT to touch the bulbs with your bare hands".

I opened the access flaps on the shroud, and they do not look easy to
get at, hence my question.  My service CD offers little help, other then
rotate the headlamp bulb retainer and remove (pull-out) the bulb.

Thanks,

Steven

Not that hard, but you need flexible wrists.  The CD says it all - it's
exactly that easy.

Wish it were Herb, 'that easy' that is.  I opened the flaps, but could
not even see the back of the headlamps.  Guess I'll have to perform some
disassembly.

Thanks for your help,

Then you either aren't looking in the right spot or are looking for the
wrong thing.  It's in plain view, if not direct view, about 5 inches down
and a little aft.  There's a dished-out area in the radiator-supporting
front frame into which the back of the lamp intrudes somewhat.  The
narrowness makes it an awkward wrist-twist to get positioned so you can turn
it once you get your fingers on it.

I was looking in the right spot, and at the right thing.  The darn
things were just tough to get at.  I was almost tempted to remove the
battery to get at the drivers side bulb, but I noticed there would still
be a couple bundles of wires in the way.  Anyway, I got them changed and
it wasn't easy.

Thanks for your help,

Steven
