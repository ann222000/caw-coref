Archs are working on the question of why it sank. My theory is that it
filled up with water from outside.

Riddle of a Confederate Submarine

sank.

In its brief career, the H.L. Hunley was a success and a failure. Now,
years after its resurrection, the Confederate submarine is a mystery
and a research project.

The Hunley was the first submarine in history to sink an enemy vessel.
On a quiet February night in 1864--six years before Jules Verne's
fictional 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea--the Hunley rammed a spar into
the stern area, planting a torpedo into the hull of the USS
Housatonic, one of the Union ships blockading Charleston harbor. The
Hunley's crew reversed its crank drive, backing away from the
Housatonic before detonating the torpedo, sinking the Housatonic. The
Hunley surfaced to send a &quot;mission accomplished&quot; signal, but like
Verne's Nautilus, the Hunley didn't come back.

William and Mary geology student Jason Lunze is no Captain Nemo, but
shipwrecks have always fascinated him. As a kid, he would walk the
beach near his grandparents' home on Mobjack Bay and pick up Colonial-
era pipe stems and other artifacts. His interest in the Confederate
submarine dates back to grade school.

&quot;I was aware of the Hunley probably since I was about six years old,&quot;
Jason said. &quot;One of my first grade school teachers had noticed my
interest in shipwrecks and lent me one of his personal books. At that
time they were still looking for the Confederate submarine. I thought
it rather fascinating but I never thought they would actually find it;
it is rather a small article to find lost in a rather large ocean.&quot;

&quot;Where&quot; Becomes &quot;Why&quot;
Not only was the Hunley found, in 1995; it also was recovered. In
fact, the Hunley is on public display at the Warren Lasch Conservation
Center in Charleston, South Carolina. If you want to see the Hunley,
you'll have to go on a Saturday, because during the week,
archaeologists are working to preserve the Hunley and to solve the
remaining mystery-why did it sink?

&quot;The H.L. Hunley was the first submarine to sink an enemy vessel, but
it was lost shortly thereafter,&quot; Jason said. &quot;It was somewhat of a
technological marvel of its day, and that can be emphasized by the
secrecy in which it was moved from Mobile to Charleston. A special
train car was constructed to conceal its identity during its entire
journey.&quot;

Not all the work on the Hunley is being done in Charleston. Jason
Lunze is adding pieces to the solution of the mystery from the College
of William and Mary. A geology major and marine archaeology buff,
Jason got involved through Rowan Lockwood of William and Mary's
geology department, who put him in touch with M. Scott Harris of
Costal Carolina University, a William and Mary alumnus who has a
record of collaborating with faculty at his alma mater. Harris is
temporarily reassigned, working on the Hunley team.

Jason thought work involving the sedimentation of the Hunley might
make a good geology project, but Harris told him there was no suitable
sedimentation work. &quot;But he had a project on the formation of
rusticles within the submarine, and I said that I'd love to work on
the project,&quot; Jason said.

Bacterial Condos
Scientific examination of the bacterial colonies that create
rusticles--and the minerals produced by the bacteria--can provide
insight into a number of conditions, present and past, in sunken iron
vessels. Jason received five rusticles removed from the sub's
interior.

&quot;The samples that I collected from the H.L. Hunley are dead colonies,&quot;
Jason said. &quot;The submarine was in-filled with sediment, which stopped
their growth. This gives us a good view of what the inside conditions
were like before the sediment in-fill completely killed off the
colonies.&quot;

He has been using a variety of nondestructive analytical techniques to
examine his rusticles. He has worked with Bob Pike of William and
Mary's chemistry department, but does the majority of his work in the
Surface Characterization Lab in the Applied Research Center. Jason
keeps his rusticles wet, to avoid oxidation. In fact, the entire
Hunley hull is kept under water in a preservation tank.

&quot;The samples have to be dry in order to run the analytical
techniques,&quot; Jason explained. &quot;So I have to dry them out first.&quot; The
drying process involves placing a rusticle sample in a desiccating
vacuum chamber, adding argon gas, which helps the process by
displacing air.

Jason, who expects to graduate in 2008, will be busy on rusticle tests
for the next four to six months. He will write up his findings in a
senior thesis and hopes to have a paper accepted into a peer-reviewed
journal. He characterizes his work as &quot;a small brick in the wall of
knowledge&quot; on the H.L. Hunley that ultimately may solve the mystery of
the innovative warship that accomplished its mission, but didn't come
back.

water from the outside is the bane of every ship.
