Empires that won't fall

A short film was recently pulled from San Francisco's Frameline film
festival because it was said to reinforce transphobic stereotypes
articulated in Janice Raymond's 1979 book Transsexual Empire. The
question is, How has her oversimplified thinking survived?

Janice Raymond is a non-transgender lesbian feminist who was a
professor of women's studies at Hampshire College when she wrote the
1979 book Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-male. In her
book Raymond completely dismissed the notion that an individual
could have a valid belief of being a different gender from the one
assigned at birth. And with that as a foundation, Empire advanced
the following two stereotypes:

(1) Male-to-female transsexuals are merely male agents of the
patriarchy, reinforcing feminine stereotypes; and MTF lesbian
feminists are really men masquerading as women so they can invade
and dominate women's space.

(2) Female-to-male transsexuals are merely women who have copped out
of the women's movement by changing themselves rather than changing
society.

The first stereotype is no doubt one reason why the long-running
Michigan Womyn's Music Festival maintains a policy, reiterated just
last year, of limiting the festival to &quot;womyn-born-womyn.&quot; The
second stereotype, say detractors, is perpetuated in director
Catherine Crouch's short film The Gendercator, which was recently
spurned by the San Francisco LGBT film festival Frameline.

Raymond based her book on what was known about transsexualism at the
time, which was not much. Empire gave the appearance of providing
well-researched insights into a much-unknown population. Her book
became part of women's studies curricula and was widely available at
feminist booksellers. And because no counterbalancing works had been
(or could be) published for years, a whole generation of women has
an understanding of transsexuals that's been influenced by Raymond's
thinking.

But much has changed since Empire was written.

(1) As depicted in the movie If These Walls Could Talk 2, lesbian
feminists in the 1970s found themselves excluded from feminist
groups because, as the character Diane puts it, &quot;it's too risky to
take on your issues right now.&quot; It makes sense that Raymond might
therefore have viewed transsexual lesbian feminists as inhibiting
acceptance of lesbian feminists by the wider feminist community.
Fortunately, postmodern feminists are taking a more inclusive view.

(2) Raymond was alarmed by the opening of more than 20 university
gender clinics in the 1970s. She saw this growing &quot;medical
conglomerate,&quot; which united medical specialties under one roof to
&quot;create transsexuals,&quot; as the patriarchy's &quot;transsexual empire.&quot;
However, as trans woman Dallas Denny explained in Transgender
Tapestry magazine, the clinics spouted up because treatment until
then had been largely unavailable in this country. Most of the
university gender clinics had disappeared by the time Denny wrote
her piece in 1991, and services today are provided mostly by
unaffiliated professionals. So much for the empire.

(3) Empire was correct in asserting that gender clinics reinforced
gender-role stereotypes. At the time overwhelmingly male
legislatures had made it a crime in many states to impersonate a
female. Limiting treatment to those who &quot;passed&quot; in their perceived
gender allowed these small clinics to deal with the overwhelming
demand and, coincidentally, increased the likelihood of what society
would deem a positive outcome. But access to treatment today is
gated much more by an ability to pay, as treatment is usually not
covered by insurance. Surely the patriarchy would overcome this
roadblock if it were truly out to create transsexuals.

(4) Raymond grounded her thinking in part on the research of Johns
Hopkins University psychologist John Money. In the 1972 college
textbook Man &amp; Woman, Boy &amp; Girl, which he wrote with current
Columbia medical psychology professor Anke A. Ehrhardt, it was
asserted that social factors lock in a child's gender identity in
the first 18 months of life. But this assertion has in recent years
been challenged, since some babies born with ambiguous
genitalia-some of whom have been surgically &quot;made&quot; female at birth
and rigidly raised as girls-choose later to transition to male in
order to respond to a strongly held male identity. These cases
(which included Money's own star patient) as well as other new
research have led to the current thinking that gender identity is
more likely set in the womb.

(5) Raymond revealed that she had spoken with only 15 transsexuals,
of whom &quot;several.were prostitutes.&quot; Because all of our transgender
academics at the time were deeply closeted for fear of losing their
jobs, we had no voice to challenge Raymond's &quot;research.&quot; Today,
things are different. When J. Michael Bailey released his 2003 book
The Man Who Would Be Queen, based largely on interviews of
transsexuals in a gay bar, a number of out trans academics quickly
banded together to denounce his sex-obsessed findings and lack of
research. Bailey subsequently resigned as chairman of Northwestern
University's psychology department.

(6) When Empire was written we did not have visibility to the
oppression that transgender people suffer at the hands of the
patriarchy. In the 2006 report &quot;50 Under 30: Masculinity and the War
on America's Youth,&quot;the Gender Public Advocacy Coalition revealed
that 92% of victims of gender-based violence were biologically male
but presenting with some degree of femininity, and in cases where
the assailant was known, he was always male. Transgender people are
clearly not agents of the patriarchy; we are its victims too.

Interestingly, Raymond and the other feminists who have taken
transgender people to task over the years have aimed their critiques
almost exclusively at male-to-female transsexuals. In her
just-released, approachable, and thought-provoking book Whipping
Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of
Femininity, biologist and transsexual lesbian feminist Julia Serano
aptly labels this bias &quot;trans-misogyny.&quot; Finally, we might have an
academic work with the standing to challenge Raymond and get to the
heart of the issue.

But really, why do Raymond's offensive stereotypes about
transsexuals persist when history has largely absolved us from our
accused roles as accomplices of the patriarchy? The irony seems to
be that in seeking to eradicate gender-role stereotypes, Janice
Raymond actually perpetuated two more.

&quot;[T]he job of the gay community is not to deal with extremists who
would castigate us or put us on an island and drop an H-bomb on us.
The fact of the matter is that there is a small percentage of people
in America who understand the true nature of the homosexual
community. There is another small percentage who will never
understand us. Our job is not to get those people who dislike us to
love us. Nor was our aim in the civil rights movement to get
prejudiced white people to love us. Our aim was to try to create the
kind of America, legislatively, morally, and psychologically, such
that even though some whites continued to hate us, they could not
openly manifest that hate. That's our job today: to control the
extent to which people can publicly manifest antigay sentiment.&quot;
