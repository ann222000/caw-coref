VETERANS DISARMAMENT ACT TO BAR VETS FROM OWNING GUNS

By Larry Pratt
September 22, 2007
NewsWithViews.com

Hundreds of thousands of veterans -- from Vietnam through Operation
Iraqi Freedom -- are at risk of being banned from buying firearms if
legislation that is pending in Congress gets enacted.

How? The Veterans Disarmament Act -- which has already passed the House
-- would place any veteran who has ever been diagnosed with Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) on the federal gun ban list.

This is exactly what President Bill Clinton did over seven years ago
when his administration illegitimately added some 83,000 veterans into
the National Criminal Information System (NICS system) -- prohibiting
them from purchasing firearms, simply because of afflictions like PTSD.

The proposed ban is actually broader. Anyone who is diagnosed as being a
tiny danger to himself or others would have his gun rights taken away
... forever. It is section 102(b)(1)(C)(iv) in HR 2640 that provides for
dumping raw medical records into the system. Those names -- like the
83,000 records mentioned above -- will then, by law, serve as the basis
for gun banning.

----------------------

Sounds OK to me. We already have laws that ban guns for anyone convicted
of ANY felony, even non-violent ones like tax evasion or illegal drug
possession.!! If that's grounds for RKBA denial then PTSD should be.

Well, finally agreement! Who could be against a law that bans the
likes of Ultraboy and Gomer Gator from ever being the victims of &quot;gun
rays&quot;?  We don't need leftie loons such as them to be armed.

But the truth of this bill is that it changes the criteria from being
adjudicated mentally incompetent in a court of law (were all sides can
bring medical testimony and the case fairly decided) to one where some
mere government bureaucrat can declare you insane with the stroke of
his pen.  How long before we get the Soviet system where anyone who
disagrees with the current administration policy is simply declared
insane and disappears into some &quot;mental hospital&quot;?  Cripes! It's
already bad enough that a 'terrorist&quot; is now defined as &quot;anyone Dubya
says is one&quot;!

No need to when the Mental Defect is conceded by the parties involved.
The Vet knows and accepts his PTSD diagnosis from the VA, and
the disability payments and free treatments he willingly receives. The
doctors and psychiatrists know the Vet has PTSD via their professional
diagnosis. There is nothing in controversy, the patient and the doctors
both agree and accept that there is a Mental Defect, ie PTSD.

Or are you asserting the rare cases where the Vet has been professionally
diagnossed with PTSD, and the Vet personally denies and refuses that
diagnosis?

Furthermore, it is the purview of the BATFe to set the criteria for
the exclusions to firearm purchase/ownership.

It's PERFECTLY &quot;Constitutional&quot; _AND_ perfectly acceptable by all sane
people.

That's why YOU (and Poofter Jones!/¥ UltraMan ¥) are not allowed to
legaly own a firearm.
After all, _you_ are both retards, as seen and recognised by your own
peoples and Governments, as &quot;Legaly incompetent&quot;.
Poofter Jones!/¥ UltraMan ¥ are from England, and their government was
smart enough to realize a century ago, that &quot;subjects&quot; are not people,
to be trusted, or worth being able to save themselves.

Our US Constitution, protects only OUR peoples citizens, against the
likes of YOU, Judy.
YOU are a proven drunken slut, that is even afraid to stand by that
other drunken cunt, Cindy Sheehan.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sounds OK to me. We already have laws that ban guns for anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; convicted of ANY felony, even non-violent ones like tax evasion or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; illegal drug possession.!! If that's grounds for RKBA denial then
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PTSD should be.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Based on your Usenet posts, you fall into the prohibited persons
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ranks... now lets see if I can do a little data base tinkering to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get you added.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So you don't support the denial of the RTKBA toward any person
&gt;&gt;&gt; or group of persons, eh hypocrite nutter?

&gt;&gt; Speaking in your terms:

&gt;&gt; I don't absolutely not, support the RTKBA towards any person or group
&gt;&gt; of person.

&gt; Good. So when are you going to lobby for the right of Convicted Felons,
&gt; Convicted Domestic Abusers and Dishonorably Discharged Vets to
&gt; keep and bear arms ?

&gt;&gt; Hope this helps clear up your question.

The entire NICS concept is virtually worthless from the beginning. It can be
completely circumvented with nothing more than a decent fake ID with the
right clean name determined from a little simple research. College kids have
no problem getting ID's and neither will anyone who wants to fake out NICS.
It's an expensive joke and should be dismantled. It's also a nice way for
potential long term identity thieves to positively verify that an identity
they want to use has no criminal history or warrants associated with it so I
guess if you are an identity thief it's a cool tool you can use to help you
work more efficiently and safely.

&gt; VETERANS DISARMAMENT ACT TO BAR VETS FROM OWNING GUNS

&gt; By Larry Pratt
&gt; September 22, 2007
&gt; NewsWithViews.com

&gt; Hundreds of thousands of veterans -- from Vietnam through Operation
&gt; Iraqi Freedom -- are at risk of being banned from buying firearms if
&gt; legislation that is pending in Congress gets enacted.

&gt; How? The Veterans Disarmament Act -- which has already passed the House
&gt; -- would place any veteran who has ever been diagnosed with Post
&gt; Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) on the federal gun ban list.

&gt; This is exactly what President Bill Clinton did over seven years ago
&gt; when his administration illegitimately added some 83,000 veterans into
&gt; the National Criminal Information System (NICS system) -- prohibiting
&gt; them from purchasing firearms, simply because of afflictions like PTSD.

&gt; The proposed ban is actually broader. Anyone who is diagnosed as being a
&gt; tiny danger to himself or others would have his gun rights taken away
&gt; ... forever. It is section 102(b)(1)(C)(iv) in HR 2640 that provides for
&gt; dumping raw medical records into the system. Those names -- like the
&gt; 83,000 records mentioned above -- will then, by law, serve as the basis
&gt; for gun banning.

&gt; (snip)

&gt; ----------------------

&gt; Sounds OK to me. We already have laws that ban guns for anyone convicted
&gt; of ANY felony, even non-violent ones like tax evasion or illegal drug
&gt; possession.!! If that's grounds for RKBA denial then PTSD should be.

The fact that you have no argument against what was posted regarding felons
is noted. You've lost that point already. Now quote for me, you pig ignorant
imbecile, where I have ever advocated barring ownership of or posession of
guns to people simply because someone labeled them &quot;mentally defective&quot;. As
for you you don't even have the balls to state a position on the subject.

No such law exists and your entire question is just a dodge to avoid
confronting the fact that there is a difference between those convicted of a
crime, usually a felony under due process of law, and the rest of the
population at large. That said in general I don't support limitation of
constitutional rights beyond the initial time limited court imposed
punishment such as a jail term for misdemeanors and neither does the
American justice system except with regard to firearms for a few cherry
picked offenses.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (snip)

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ----------------------

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sounds OK to me. We already have laws that ban guns for anyone
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; convicted of ANY felony, even non-violent ones like tax evasion
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or illegal drug possession.!! If that's grounds for RKBA denial
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then PTSD should be.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Based on your Usenet posts, you fall into the prohibited persons
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ranks... now lets see if I can do a little data base tinkering to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get you added.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So you don't support the denial of the RTKBA toward any person
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or group of persons, eh hypocrite nutter?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Speaking in your terms:

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I don't absolutely not, support the RTKBA towards any person or
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; group of person.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Good. So when are you going to lobby for the right of Convicted
&gt; &gt;&gt; Felons,

&gt; &gt; Obviously, well obviously to anyone but a pig ignorant imbecile such
&gt; &gt; as yourself, constitutional rights can be stripped or restricted from
&gt; &gt; those convicted of crimes under due process of law.

&gt; Really?
">

Yes really you brain dead idiot.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So you don't support the denial of RTKBA for Fugitives, Mental Defectives,
&gt; or those who've ever Renounced their U$ Citizenship, since none of those
&gt; people have been &quot;convicted of crimes under due process of law&quot;, eh
">

numbnuts?

I've already covered this previously on this same NG (although you
consistently lack the balls to state a position on it). Try to keep up. I
know it's hard for you with your obvious cognitive limitations.  1. Mental
defective is nothing but a label that can be applied by anyone. I don't
support limiting the rights of someone just because someone lables them
mentally defective. The only way to restrict someones RKBA because of so
called 'mental defect' SHOULD be a finding of fact by a jury that  the
person constitutes a danger to themself or others. A finding by a judge
SHOULD be insufficient unless the person has waived a jury trial on the
matter. Further it's idiotic to say on the one hand that someone is a danger
to themself or others and deny them the RKBA but not confine them to an
institution. If they are so dangerous that a fundamental right can be denied
them then they are dangerous enough to involuntarily lock up and treat.  2.
Someone who renounces US citizenship is clearly no longer a citizen and is
not guaranted the same rights as citizens so that one is blatantly obvious
to anyone but an idiot like you. 3. Fugitives are fugitives because they
choose to be and have essentially waived the due prosess they would
otherwise be entitled to. Their prohibited status is only justified so long
as they actually remain a fugitive.

You can try to spin it all you want. Your  argument that simply because
there are prohibited classes of persons EVERYONE can be prohibited is
idiotic and defies common sense. Not surprising since you don't display any
evidence of having any. A rational person could make the point that certain
classes of prohibited persons are unreasonably broad or that due process is
lacking in the process of adding individuals to certain classes but these
are intelligent, rational, positions well beyond you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; If they couldn't those convicted of crimes could not be put in prison
since it
&gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt; be a clear violation of their constitutional rights.

&gt; So where in the Constitution does it state that &quot;a conviction under due
process
&gt; of law&quot;
&gt; is necessary to curtail, restrict, limit or prohibit outright, any &quot;right&quot;

?

Probably the stupidist thing you've written to date. It's implicit you
nitwitt. What use would a gaurantee of rights be if they could be restricted
for no reason whatsoever? If the founders had anticipated someone as stupid
as yourself they would probably have spelled it out in greater detail.
Stupidity as you commonly display was rare when the constitution was written
so they credited anyone reading it with far more intelligence than you will
ever muster. Further the constitution is  a limit on government power which
spells out what the government is empowered to do.  It does not give the
government the power to do anything simply because it isn't specifically
prohibited. Of course a drooling idiot like you who says things like:
