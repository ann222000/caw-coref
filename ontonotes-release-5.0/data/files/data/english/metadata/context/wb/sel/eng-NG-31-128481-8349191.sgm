Jewish Couples

One thing I enjoy seeing on Eretz Israel is the presence of Jewish
Couples modestly dressed that are dating with the intention of
marriage.

I can remember the beautiful couples I saw in Tel-Aviv at the Park
across from Rehov Beni Dan where the river Yarkon flows through.

I can also remember the Ivrit couples in the parks in Haifa.

So many wonderful blessings await the Jewish people each day of our
lifes.  Hashem loves us very much because we dedicate our lifes to his
service and the observance of his Mitzvoth.

In Thilim is written as follows: A maskil by Asaph.  Listen, my
people, to my teaching, incline your ear to the words of my mouth. I
will open my mouth with a parable, I will utter and explain riddles
from antiquity.  That which we have heard and know and our fathers
told us, we shall not withhold from their sons, recounting unto the
final generation the praises of Hashem, His might and His wonders that
He has wrought.  He established a testimony in Jacob and set down a
Torah in Israel, which He commanded our fathers, to make known to
their sons.  So that the final generation may know; children yet to be
born will arise and tell their own children; so that they may place
their trust in God, and not forget the works of God, and they will
safeguard his commandments.

I say David King of Israel lives and stands on Eretz Israel.  Long
live the Jewish people.  Long live David our King and Blessed be
Hashem our God, the King of the Universe and God of Israel.

Our enemies will appear with misquartah coming out of their noses and
we will kill them on Eretz Israel as the pig eating heathens they are.
