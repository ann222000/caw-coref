Went to the store last night and there was Maxine, the shop dog.  She's not
always there but she was there last night.

She's such a sweet mutt.  No particular breed that I can ascertain but she's
got brown and black rather longish fur (now going grey around her muzzle).
She's probably about 40, maybe 50 lbs; medium size dog.  When people come in
her long brushy tail sweeps the floor, she's just so happy to see people!
If you know her name and say it, her floppy ears perk up and she'll raise up
(sort of like a cat deigning to greet you).  If you approach, she rolls over
for belly rubs and smiles that doggy smile that only dogs can do while her
tail beats back and forth.  She's so sweet!  Maxine is getting up there in
age.  She has grey on her muzzle and she doesn't move so well anymore.  I
think she might have displaysia in her hips.  I haven't seen her on her feet
in a long time.  But she's such a sweetie.

I never see any shop cats, which seem to be so common in the UK.  Last time
I saw any shop cats was back in 2004 in Addison, TX, in the window of a
vet's office.  The office was closed but there were cats lounging on the
desk by the window.  John and I were on our way to Lucky's for breakfast
(outstanding brie cheese and bacon omelets, folks!) and were perusing the
shops when I noticed cats through the window.  I very much like the idea of
shop cats.  Wish more people in the U.S. would get with the idea.

Not round here in East London-in fact I don't think I've ever seen a
shop cat or dog. The nearest I've come to it was Stamford the cat who
"belonged" to the hospital I used to work at. Enormous black and white
cat- probably enormous due to the fact several staff all thought they
were the only people putting out food for her. Earned her keep through,
no mouse or rat problem there unless you count cleaning up the
leftovers she made

Lovely cat. I have a picture of her on my noticeboard at work. When we
were told the place was closing down several people were in tears not
at the thought of losing their job but who would look after Stamford
once we were all gone?

Luckily Neil was kept on to look after the gardens and whilst he claims
not to like cats he admits she is the exception to the rule

On the day I left, it was something of a rush job since Dave had just
gone into hospital and anyway everyone was at meetings about new jobs
etc. When I came out for the last time, Stamford was waiting to see me
off...come to think of it just like she was the first person I saw when
I started there and I remember thinking "They have a cat. This must be
a nice place to work"

And on the whole it was

There is a huge rodent problem in Hawaii, so most restaurants or pubs have a
resident cat.  The Health Department looks the other way because it's kind
of like, which would you rather have?  A cat or rodents?  If you serve food
in any form, if you don't have a cat, you *will* have a rodent problem.

I worked in this BBQ place on Maui called "Lone Star Cookhouse".  (Yes, the
owners were from Texas.)  We had a resident male cat, BEAUTIFUL cat, named
Starr.  He was so friendly and all the customers loved him.  He had to be
the best fed cat in the universe, I swear.  LOL.  He wasn't fat, though,
because he kept himself in shape taking care of the grounds.

I was working one night and I heard this ear-splitting scream coming from
the kitchen.  As I turned to go in, Starr came out with one of the hugest
rats I have ever seen.  The rat was screaming and, of course, Starr had to
parade around the restaurant with his prize.  He went from guest to guest
showing off his trophy as the diners pointed and laughed.  He then bounded
off the back porch and I can only assume "took care" of his efforts.

We all had a good chuckle out of that one.  :~)

I feel kind of sad for the rat, now that I have pet ones, but feral rats and
pet rats are two different animals!

Since getting pet rats, I've really come to empathise with their wild
buddies. Even before getting the pet rats, I use to enjoy watching the
wild ones eat the chicken food. So glad my cats don't hunt anymore!

My veterinarian has two shop cats (East Texas).  They are love-bugs and
clearly feel that the place belongs to them.  One had to be lifted off the
printer so a receipt could be printed the last time I was there!  One of
them is a cat that someone left for some medical work and never returned --
and the address and phone information she gave turned out to be false.
Well, she sure knew the right people to have a soft heart because that was 3
or 4 years ago and the cat clearly has a foreverhome.

Years ago in Virginia, we lived above a restaurant for a while with a female
cat named Minette, who would patrol. There was outdoor dining on the patio
too. Minette would often just lie on the floor and watch the guests, or else
go from table to table saying hello and receiving tidbits from some. She was
very happy there.

We have quite a few shop cats around here. Our vet has one, the natural
pet food store has 2, a cat store has a blind kitty that goes home with
them at night, and a couple of book stores have cats.

Oh, that would have killed me. I would have been running after the cat,
trying to free the rat. Rats are actually pretty cute once you get past
the tail, but I wouldn't want them inside either. If only they had
things like rat sanctuaries...

One of the used book stores in Manassas, Virginia (McKay's) has
a long haired black cat named "Page".  He's often found in the
front window when the sun is shining through (big surprise there
:) ).  He's a fairly no-nonsense cat, but will sometimes come
over and give a cheek rub or some such, and isn't above accepting
an ear skritch if offered correctly.  It's obviously *his* turf :)
They're usually busy, so I've never gotten the story of Page's
presence in the store.  Judging from the pictures on the back
wall, he's a big hit with the kids...:)

A tea shop west of me had a tabby and kittens running the
place a few years back.  I'm not sure if they're still there,
but I enjoyed looking at some classic British automobiles,
having a cup of tea and a biscuit (they were out of scones,
unfortunately), and petting a happily purring tabby one afternoon.
It seems that she had decided to have her kittens in the garage,
and since they didn't want her or the little ones running around
in an active auto repair facility, they moved her in to the tea
shop that adjoins the garage.  She seemed perfectly happy with
that arrangement...:)

There's also a yarn store near here in Chantilly, VA, whose
advertisements feature a nice little tabby keeping an eye on
things.  I have yet to go in and see if the store actually
is run *by* that cat, or if it's just a gimmick.

Many of the antique shops around here have had furred residents,
but in a couple of cases, people have complained about allergies
and/or fear of scratches, so some of the shop owners opted to make
their shop cats house cats instead.  Happily, I have yet to hear
of any of them that *didn't* keep the cats...:)

Purrs-

Chris

I know, but if you would have worked in an open-air restaurant in Hawaii,
you would have seen the damage that the rats do.  They chew through beer
lines, soda lines, garbage containers, boxes of produce (in coolers!).......
I feel for the little guys, but a cat helps keep them out and saves a ton of
money in repair bills.  A can of cat food is a small price to pay.

Awww, that is a cute little guy! Mickey Rat? I love that name.

That would be hard to control in Hawaii. This is kind of gross, but when
we had an inspector look at this house before we bought it -- he found
rat droppings in the unfinished basement. He said most homes have at
least one rat living underneath them.

He asked if we had cats, and he told us to put some of their droppings
in open, margarine-type tubs and put them in corners of the basement. He
said the cat smell would keep little rodents away. It worked!

So maybe in Hawaii they could surround the restaurants with a ring of
cat poop?  :)

All the veterinarians I have ever visited have had shop cats. I think
that they often "inherit" cats and/or kittens from people who leave
them and never come back. Some of the cats spend their workdays in the
shop and go home with someone at night. Others are on duty at the
office all day and night.

The bookstore I managed had Winthrop, a lovely black and white plush
shorhair. He was a feral who had been enticed indoors, along with his
brother Edgewood, at my apartment. Win was a dedicated indoor/outdoor
who would not even look at a litter box. One attempt, by my associate
Bob, to put a leash on him wound up with Bob at the emergency room.
Other than that incident, Win was affectionate with the whole staff,
especially Bob.

He was more distant with customers but many earned his trust enough to
give him skritches, etc. People would bring him treats but we tried to
monitor his diet. He did not appreciate these efforts on his behalf as
he was a most adventurous eater. He was only at the store during our
hours of operation. However, we were open 24/7.

When he had been there two years, the bookstore reached a point where
it was losing money too fast and we had to close it down. Winthrop was
clearly not at fault as his two Employee of the Year plaques testify.
One of the employees was moving to Boston where he would have an
opening for an enterprising cat to keep track of his kitchen table and
inventory his spoons. So he hired Winthrop and Win is still there,
although quite elderly as I type this.

A few blocks away, another bookstore had a very nice Doberman who was
clearly NOT an attack or security dog. She was a little nervous about
strangers but she picked up on people fast. I am pretty sure she went
home with the owner at night.

&gt; Not round here in East London-in fact I don't think I've ever seen a
&gt; shop cat or dog. The nearest I've come to it was Stamford the cat who
&gt; &quot;belonged&quot; to the hospital I used to work at.
">

I work at a laboratory where the staff maintain national standards for
measurement in the UK - &lt; http://www.npl.co.uk &gt;. They used to have a
resident cat, Herbie (RB). He was reported to have been aged nearly
thirty years old when he died, as one long-serving member of staff
remembered first meeting him when he was an apprentice in the 1960's!

One of the "Divisional Superintendents" of the time decided that Herbie
should be ejected from the buildings, as he wasn't conducive to precise
measurement. In some ways that's true - we don't want cat hair on the UK
Standard Kilogramme, do we? - but my boss objected strongly to this
edict. He wrote a requisition form for cat flaps for the building where
he worked :-)

Needless to say, the requisition wasn't approved :-( More recently,
there appear to be a couple of feral cats who roam the entire site of
more than 90 acres...

&gt; &gt; I never see any shop cats, which seem to be so common in the UK.  Last
&gt; &gt; time
&gt; &gt; I saw any shop cats was back in 2004 in Addison, TX, in the window of a
&gt; &gt; vet's office.  The office was closed but there were cats lounging on the
&gt; &gt; desk by the window.  John and I were on our way to Lucky's for breakfast
&gt; &gt; (outstanding brie cheese and bacon omelets, folks!) and were perusing the
&gt; &gt; shops when I noticed cats through the window.  I very much like the idea
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; shop cats.  Wish more people in the U.S. would get with the idea.

&gt; My veterinarian has two shop cats (East Texas).  They are love-bugs and
&gt; clearly feel that the place belongs to them.  One had to be lifted off the
&gt; printer so a receipt could be printed the last time I was there!  One of
&gt; them is a cat that someone left for some medical work and never returned --
&gt; and the address and phone information she gave turned out to be false.
&gt; Well, she sure knew the right people to have a soft heart because that was 3
&gt; or 4 years ago and the cat clearly has a foreverhome.

I remember many years ago, I was waiting on a corner for the light to
change. (Busy street). It was night, in a not so nice part of town. I
scanned around me, looking for possible threats. (inner city survival
mode - always on...).

To my delight, in the store window directly behind me, I saw a small
orange and white cat!

It was a real estate office, and the cat was laying on the window sill
watching the street.

When I came over to the window, he put his two front paws on the glass:
he was a polydactyl!

I moved my finder around the glass, and the kitty was trying to bap it
through the glass. When I stopped, he rolled over on he back, folded his
big paws on his chest, and showed me a tummy that he seemed to want to
have smurgled. It was all white, and looked soft as could be!

He certainly looked like a friendly kitty! I could see by the street
light a food and a water bowl; the bowl was filed to overflowing with
dry food. (I also saw a number of cat toys scattered around the office).
I realized it was Friday night, and perhaps nobody would be in the
office until Monday :-(

I felt sorry for the friendly little cat in the storefront window, until
I thought about how many homeless cats there are, and how many waiting
in shelters for their one true home. Perhaps this kitty was left on his
own a lot, but he had a warm place to sleep, food, water, toys, a nice
view of the street, and somebody obviously cared a lot about him.

Sadly, although I always meant to go back during business hours, I never
did.

Rats are cute, but not when they're spreading germs in a restaurant or
grocery store. And I'd rather have a cat taking care of them than rat
poison, which seems like a slower and more painful death. However you
deal with it, though, you can't have rats running around in a food

&gt; grocery store. And I'd rather have a cat taking care of them than rat
&gt; poison, which seems like a slower and more painful death. However you
&gt; deal with it, though, you can't have rats running around in a food
&gt; establishment.

No, that's why I'd love for someone to open a rat sanctuary!

We're in the Puget Sound area in Washington state.

We sometimes drive down to the big Powell's bookstore in Portland, OR,

Ha, no military dictatorships in South America, although maybe they are

Hmmm, aren't raccoons or other animals just as likely to have rabies

Weil's disease (leptospirosis), transmitted in rat urine, 10% fatal and
100% certain to make you wish you were dead.  The Scottish Mining Museum
in our village mentions it; it used to be a serious problem in coal mines.
The fix was for miners to take their sandwiches below in tightly fitted
tins, leaving no crumbs for the rats.  They date back to the 19th century,
and in Scotland they were shaped for the profile of the standard Scottish
"plain" loaf.  I haven't looked but I'd bet you can buy them in in the
mining-memorabilia section of eBay.

Well, there is the hantavirus, which is probably what Rhonda was

range includes western Europe.

Okay, I looked up some info on hantavirus. In the U.S., only six states
have had more than 30 cases in the last 14 years -- mostly around the
New Mexico area. I'm sure that's the one I was thinking of.

There is info for cleaning up rodent populations if you live in an
"hantavirus infested area." even in an infested area, that's less than 2
human cases per year.

I'm still not afraid of rats, they just don't sound so deadly to me. We
will continue to put our little cat droppings in the cellar, but
otherwise they can live in the woods if they want.

I haven't heard of that one! Looks like the answer would be to make a
little latrine for mining rats. I looked up some info from here:
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/leptospirosis_g.htm

How do people get leptospirosis?

Outbreaks of leptospirosis are usually caused by exposure to water
contaminated with the urine of infected animals. Many different kinds of
animals carry the bacterium; they may become sick but sometimes have no
symptoms. Leptospira organisms have been found in cattle, pigs, horses,
dogs, rodents, and wild animals. Humans become infected through contact
with water, food, or soil containing urine from these infected animals.
This may happen by swallowing contaminated food or water or through skin
contact, especially with mucosal surfaces, such as the eyes or nose, or
with broken skin. The disease is not known to be spread from person to
person.

Where is leptospirosis found?

Leptospirosis occurs worldwide but is most common in temperate or
tropical climates. It is an occupational hazard for many people who work
outdoors or with animals, for example, farmers, sewer workers,
veterinarians, fish workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. It is
a recreational hazard for campers or those who participate in outdoor
sports in contaminated areas and has been associated with swimming,
wading, and whitewater rafting in contaminated lakes and rivers. The
incidence is also increasing among urban children.

I think there is a Hantavirus.  Never heard of a Junta virus.  And I'm
pretty sure that is confined to a small area of the Southwest United States.
People are infected by contact with feces and urine contamination from
rodents.

While cats do carry fleas, fleas are species specific.  Rodent fleas are the
ones that carry Bubonic Plague.

We have periodic cases of infestation in chipmunks in California.  Note a
specific flea may well bite another species but can only be carried and
reproduce by feeding on its host species.

Leptospirosis was another common problem on Maui due to a large population
of feral pigs.  They pigs carried the virus, they would urinate, infecting
the waterfalls and streams.  I, personally, didn't know of any human who got
it, but I know some dogs who got really sick from drinking the pond water.
