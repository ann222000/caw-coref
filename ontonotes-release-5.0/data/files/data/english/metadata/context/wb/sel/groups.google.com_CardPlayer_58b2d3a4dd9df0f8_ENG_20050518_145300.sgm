Phil Hellmuth Tells All by Phil Hellmuth

Phil Hellmuth was kind enough to fill out our &quot;Team UB&quot; questionnaire.
Study his answers carefully: The wisdom of the ages they contain.

CAN YOU TELL AT A GLANCE WHETHER A GAME IS &quot;GOOD?&quot; HOW?

Not at a glance unless you know some of the players. At my level I can
tell at a glance because I know all of the great players, and if none
are in the game, then it is a good game. But in general, you have to
watch for at least five or ten minutes to judge a game. If the players
are playing too many hands, then I LOVE this.

WHAT SPECIFIC METHODS DO YOU USE TO EVALUATE THE STRENGTH OF YOUR
COMPETITION?

Are they aggressive, and how many hands do they play? Do they call too
much or fold too much?

HOW DO YOUR LIMIT AND NO-LIMIT TOURNAMENT STRATEGIES DIFFER?

I play both very tight for the first few levels, in limit I can keep on
playing tight, in NL, I can go either way...

HOW DO YOU APPROACH THE PLAY OF THOSE PROBLEMATIC POCKET JACKS?

I LOVE jacks...I play small pots in NL, and big ones in limit...

IS TILT A FACTOR IN YOUR PLAY? WHAT SPECIFIC STEPS DO YOU TAKE TO TAKE
YOURSELF OFF TILT?

I used to tilt way too much, but I've grown up a lot just from being a
father and husband, and having financial swings in life...

WHAT SORT OF IMAGE DO YOU LIKE TO PROJECT AND WHAT DO YOU SEEK TO
ACCOMPLISH WITH IT?

Sometimes tight, then I play loose; sometimes loose, then I play tight.

DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC APPROACH TO DEFENSE OF BLINDS?

Not really. Whatever feels right...

WHAT LEAKS DO YOU MOST FREQUENTLY SEE IN OTHER PLAYERS?

Gambling at craps, blackjack, slots, horse races, or sports betting...
alcohol or drug use, bad investments...

IF YOU COULD IMPROVE ONE ASPECT OF YOUR GAME, WHAT WOULD IT BE?

Consistency...

HOW DOES YOUR APPROACH TO ONLINE PLAY DIFFER FROM YOUR APPROACH TO LIVE
ACTION?

Online play is all about playing really tight, live is about the same,
but you need to be able to adjust in both situations...

DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC STRATEGY FOR SHORT-HANDED PLAY?

Yes, I play hands like A-rag hard, whereas I might fold them
otherwise...

DURING YOUR &quot;LEARNING PHASE,&quot; WHAT EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS HELPED YOU
THE MOST?

Studying the greatest players of the era, like the late Jack Keller....

CONVENTIIONAL WISDOM SAYS THAT A TOP PLAYER CAN WIN &quot;1.5 BIG BETS PER
HOUR.&quot; IN YOUR OPINION, IS THAT ASSESSMENT ACCURATE OR JUST A LOAD OF
HOOEY DISGUISED AS CONVENTIONAL WISDOM?

You'll do better than that in tourneys, and online if your good... But
remember that only 15% of the people consistently win in poker...

WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ARE THE TERRIFIC STRENGTHS OF YOUR GAME?

Reading people, understanding the flow of the game...
