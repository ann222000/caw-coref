Chuck worked for me for five years before I retired. My wife was on
duty yesterday in the ER when they brought him in. I've seen quite a
few cops shot over the years, but this one hit real close to home. God
bless him and his family....

As for Philadelphia, they also had a cop shot on Tuesday night, during
the democrat debate, a few blocks from where the debate was held. I
think we made the right move getting out of the city. That town is way
too wild anymore...

CRITICAL CONDITION
Officer Shot Down in West Oak Lane
Philadelphia Daily News
November 1, 2007

The life of a cop hangs in the balance, the third officer shot in a
week. Massive manhunts and fear blanket the city, and the mayor says
he's rethinking his attitude on capital punishment.

WITH PHILADELPHIA Police Officer Charles Cassidy collapsed next to a
trash can, a bullet embedded in his brain, the man who shot him
carried out one final insult against the veteran lawman.

Carrying his own gun in one hand, the brazen thug stole the officer's
police-issued revolver from the sidewalk and ran.

Cassidy, a police officer of 25 years and a married father of three,
remains in &quot;extremely, extremely, extremely&quot; critical condition at
Albert Einstein Medical Center, Police Commissioner Sylvester John-son
said.

Yesterday morning's shooting at the Dunkin' Donuts on North Broad
Street near 66th Avenue, in the city's West Oak Lane section, prompted
one of the largest and most intense manhunts in Philadelphia history.

The shooting outraged local officials reeling over the fact that
Cassidy was the fourth Philadelphia police officer shot this year -
the third this week, and the second in just 12 hours.

Cassidy was doing a routine check of the restaurant in light of a
Sept. 18 robbery there that police now believe was conducted by the
same perpetrator. As Cassidy approached the establishment around 10:30
a.m. yesterday, an employee told him that a robbery was under way
inside.

With a hand on his pistol, Cassidy opened the door, alarming the would-
be robber, who abandoned his pursuit for cash and instead fired at
Cassidy's head, lodging a single bullet deep into his brain.

&quot;He didn't try to wound him, he assassinated him,&quot; Johnson said.

Dunkin' Donuts clerk Sandra Kim said that Cassidy, who is &quot;always so
nice,&quot; comes into the store &quot;every day, twice a day&quot; and orders a
large coffee with cream and sugar. Kim was behind the counter when the
gunman came in and demanded money.

&quot;He saw the cop coming in and shot him outside just as he was opening
the door,&quot; Kim said. &quot;I heard the shot and then I ran outside and saw
him lying there. I immediately started crying. I was crying for four
hours straight.&quot;

Within minutes, officers from &quot;every single district in the city&quot;
converged on the scene, Johnson said. More than 300 multi-divisional
officers, including a large SWAT contingent, combed through the Mount
Airy and West Oak Lane neighborhoods.

Marked and unmarked police cruisers, crime-scene units, K-9 units and
medics lined a stretch of Broad Street from 65th Avenue northward.

A sheriff's van was even used to ferry police officers to the scene
from the Criminal Justice Center, where they had been testifying in
other cases.

Mayor John F. Street, who spent most of the morning at the hospital
with Cassidy's family, reiterated his calls for stronger gun laws. He
said the amount of blood on Philadelphia's streets as a result of
illegal firearms seems to have no effect on policies in Harrisburg or
Washington.

&quot;Unless we can get control over the proliferation of illegal guns,
then the people who are most at risk are, of course, the members of
the Police Department,&quot; he said. &quot;If [legislators] don't have any
concern at all for the kind of violence that we are seeing on the
streets of cities all over the country today, then I don't know what
would cause them to have a renewed consciousness.&quot;

Johnson said his officers are being &quot;basically assassinated&quot; by armed
and violent criminals.

&quot;The availability of weapons in our city . . . the availability of
guns are really completely out of hand here in the city of
Philadelphia,&quot; he said. &quot;Legislators have to realize that we have a
gun problem.&quot;

The Democratic nominee for mayor, Michael Nutter, said the recent rash
of police shootings highlights an &quot;ongoing pattern of behavior.&quot;

&quot;I think Stevie Wonder would see, or Jose Feliciano would see, that
there's obviously a problem here,&quot; he said. &quot;We have people who are
actively and aggressively taking on the Philadelphia Police
Department.&quot;

Nutter pledged that if elected, his administration, which will include
a new police commissioner, will change the &quot;entire philosophy&quot; of how
the city fights crime.

Yesterday, the city tried to fight this crime by every available
means. Police searched through apartment complexes, homes and even a
nearby cemetery. Clues were sought in sewer inlets, trash receptacles
and low-lying brush.

Officers rounded up several men who vaguely fit the description of the
suspect, a 5-foot-11 to 6-foot, stocky black male with an identifying
tattoo on his left hand. But as of last night, the assailant had not
been apprehended.

Sources at the scene said that two door handles were removed from the
front door of the Dunkin' Donuts to try to obtain the gunman's
fingerprints.

Many people watched the day's organized chaos on the sidelines,
including Moseh, a SEPTA cop for five years who asked that his last
name be withheld.

&quot;I came here in search of a better life,&quot; said Moseh, who is from
Jamaica. &quot;That life isn't here. I'm going to leave for sure.&quot;

Yet, amid the pain and suffering, small acts of kindness broke through
a bleak day.

The Salvation Army brought lunch to people on the scene, police
cruisers escorted Cassidy's family members to the hospital, and dozens
of police officers - many of them top brass in plainclothes - streamed
into the emergency room.

&quot;There is a wonderful spirit of solidarity. Everyone is helping,
everyone is praying,&quot; said Cardinal Justin Rigali, who spent about an
hour at Cassidy's side.

Rigali said that another priest had administered a last-rites ceremony
for Cassidy before he had arrived.

&quot;You can imagine the sorrow, the suffering, the immense pressure that
is on the family,&quot; he said. &quot;They are people of faith, they are people
of hope.&quot;

Street vowed to find the man responsible, and even suggested that his
views on capital punishment may have been swayed in light of the
shooting.

&quot;We're going to find the person who did this, we are going to find
them and they will be punished,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not a big death-penalty
advocate . . . but when I see an officer in the condition that this
officer is in, the grave condition, if he should lose his life in a
condition like this it really makes you start wondering.&quot;

Last night, police released an edited surveillance video of
yesterday's incident and the Sept. 18 robbery at the same location,
believed to have been committed by the same man.

Johnson noted that the assailant had a distinctive walk, &quot;some sort of
limp.&quot; There appeared to be at least three customers in the store
yesterday, when the gunman walked in with the hood of his sweatshirt
pulled up, shadowing most of his face. He could be seen on the video
pointing the gun at both cashiers and patrons inside the store.

Anyone with information on the suspect or his whereabouts is asked to
call the homicide unit at 215-686-3334 or 215-686-3335. The suspect is
considered armed and extremely dangerous and anyone who thinks they
see the man should dial 911 immediately.

A $50,000 reward has been offered by the Fraternal Order of the
Police, Pete Ciarrocchi of Chickie's and Pete's; Mike Driscoll of
Finnigan's Wake, and John Dougherty of the Electricians Local 98.

In an ironic twist, moments before receiving the call regarding
Cassidy, police officials were preparing to start a police plaque
dedication on nearby Limekiln Pike.

Police officials canceled the plaque dedication for officers James F.
Duffin and John P. Reid, who had been killed in the line of duty in
the 1970s. *

Does he have any chance, Joe? It doesn't sound like it, but you pray, you
pray.

I have twice had to call to ask if a family member had been shot on duty,
and a third time to ask if one was in the Twin Towers. In all cases, the
answer was no, but it was hard to be too happy, since that just meant that
someone else's brother, father, daughter, sister-in-law, was the victim.
It's a horribly difficult and dangerous job, and things like this are the
nightmare, the fear, of every family of every big city cop in the country.

We'll be praying for him.

And hoping like hell that they bust the SOB who shot him.

Joe:
Have they released a sketch of the shooter?  The surveillance video isn't
very clear because the guy is wearing a hoodie.  I read in the DN that
someone said the shooter goes by the name &quot;Fatman&quot;, so I presume they know
who they are looking for now.  Lets just hope Officer Cassidy somehow
recovers.

&gt; CRITICAL CONDITION
&gt; Officer Shot Down in West Oak Lane
&gt; Philadelphia Daily News
&gt; November 1, 2007

&gt; The life of a cop hangs in the balance, the third officer shot in a
&gt; week. Massive manhunts and fear blanket the city, and the mayor says
&gt; he's rethinking his attitude on capital punishment.

&gt; WITH PHILADELPHIA Police Officer Charles Cassidy collapsed next to a
&gt; trash can, a bullet embedded in his brain, the man who shot him
&gt; carried out one final insult against the veteran lawman.

&gt; Carrying his own gun in one hand, the brazen thug stole the officer's
&gt; police-issued revolver from the sidewalk and ran.

&gt; Cassidy, a police officer of 25 years and a married father of three,
&gt; remains in &quot;extremely, extremely, extremely&quot; critical condition at
&gt; Albert Einstein Medical Center, Police Commissioner Sylvester John-son
&gt; said.

&gt; Yesterday morning's shooting at the Dunkin' Donuts on North Broad
&gt; Street near 66th Avenue, in the city's West Oak Lane section, prompted
&gt; one of the largest and most intense manhunts in Philadelphia history.

&gt; The shooting outraged local officials reeling over the fact that
&gt; Cassidy was the fourth Philadelphia police officer shot this year -
&gt; the third this week, and the second in just 12 hours.

&gt; Cassidy was doing a routine check of the restaurant in light of a
&gt; Sept. 18 robbery there that police now believe was conducted by the
&gt; same perpetrator. As Cassidy approached the establishment around 10:30
&gt; a.m. yesterday, an employee told him that a robbery was under way
&gt; inside.

&gt; With a hand on his pistol, Cassidy opened the door, alarming the would-
&gt; be robber, who abandoned his pursuit for cash and instead fired at
&gt; Cassidy's head, lodging a single bullet deep into his brain.

&gt; &quot;He didn't try to wound him, he assassinated him,&quot; Johnson said.

&gt; Dunkin' Donuts clerk Sandra Kim said that Cassidy, who is &quot;always so
&gt; nice,&quot; comes into the store &quot;every day, twice a day&quot; and orders a
&gt; large coffee with cream and sugar. Kim was behind the counter when the
&gt; gunman came in and demanded money.

&gt; &quot;He saw the cop coming in and shot him outside just as he was opening
&gt; the door,&quot; Kim said. &quot;I heard the shot and then I ran outside and saw
&gt; him lying there. I immediately started crying. I was crying for four
&gt; hours straight.&quot;

&gt; Within minutes, officers from &quot;every single district in the city&quot;
&gt; converged on the scene, Johnson said. More than 300 multi-divisional
&gt; officers, including a large SWAT contingent, combed through the Mount
&gt; Airy and West Oak Lane neighborhoods.

&gt; Marked and unmarked police cruisers, crime-scene units, K-9 units and
&gt; medics lined a stretch of Broad Street from 65th Avenue northward.

&gt; A sheriff's van was even used to ferry police officers to the scene
&gt; from the Criminal Justice Center, where they had been testifying in
&gt; other cases.

&gt; Mayor John F. Street, who spent most of the morning at the hospital
&gt; with Cassidy's family, reiterated his calls for stronger gun laws. He
&gt; said the amount of blood on Philadelphia's streets as a result of
&gt; illegal firearms seems to have no effect on policies in Harrisburg or
&gt; Washington.

&gt; &quot;Unless we can get control over the proliferation of illegal guns,
&gt; then the people who are most at risk are, of course, the members of
&gt; the Police Department,&quot; he said. &quot;If [legislators] don't have any
&gt; concern at all for the kind of violence that we are seeing on the
&gt; streets of cities all over the country today, then I don't know what
&gt; would cause them to have a renewed consciousness.&quot;

&gt; Johnson said his officers are being &quot;basically assassinated&quot; by armed
&gt; and violent criminals.

&gt; &quot;The availability of weapons in our city . . . the availability of
&gt; guns are really completely out of hand here in the city of
&gt; Philadelphia,&quot; he said. &quot;Legislators have to realize that we have a
&gt; gun problem.&quot;

&gt; The Democratic nominee for mayor, Michael Nutter, said the recent rash
&gt; of police shootings highlights an &quot;ongoing pattern of behavior.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I think Stevie Wonder would see, or Jose Feliciano would see, that
&gt; there's obviously a problem here,&quot; he said. &quot;We have people who are
&gt; actively and aggressively taking on the Philadelphia Police
&gt; Department.&quot;

&gt; Nutter pledged that if elected, his administration, which will include
&gt; a new police commissioner, will change the &quot;entire philosophy&quot; of how
&gt; the city fights crime.

&gt; Yesterday, the city tried to fight this crime by every available
&gt; means. Police searched through apartment complexes, homes and even a
&gt; nearby cemetery. Clues were sought in sewer inlets, trash receptacles
&gt; and low-lying brush.

&gt; Officers rounded up several men who vaguely fit the description of the
&gt; suspect, a 5-foot-11 to 6-foot, stocky black male with an identifying
&gt; tattoo on his left hand. But as of last night, the assailant had not
&gt; been apprehended.

&gt; Sources at the scene said that two door handles were removed from the
&gt; front door of the Dunkin' Donuts to try to obtain the gunman's
&gt; fingerprints.

&gt; Many people watched the day's organized chaos on the sidelines,
&gt; including Moseh, a SEPTA cop for five years who asked that his last
&gt; name be withheld.

&gt; &quot;I came here in search of a better life,&quot; said Moseh, who is from
&gt; Jamaica. &quot;That life isn't here. I'm going to leave for sure.&quot;

&gt; Yet, amid the pain and suffering, small acts of kindness broke through
&gt; a bleak day.

&gt; The Salvation Army brought lunch to people on the scene, police
&gt; cruisers escorted Cassidy's family members to the hospital, and dozens
&gt; of police officers - many of them top brass in plainclothes - streamed
&gt; into the emergency room.

&gt; &quot;There is a wonderful spirit of solidarity. Everyone is helping,
&gt; everyone is praying,&quot; said Cardinal Justin Rigali, who spent about an
&gt; hour at Cassidy's side.

&gt; Rigali said that another priest had administered a last-rites ceremony
&gt; for Cassidy before he had arrived.

&gt; &quot;You can imagine the sorrow, the suffering, the immense pressure that
&gt; is on the family,&quot; he said. &quot;They are people of faith, they are people
&gt; of hope.&quot;

&gt; Street vowed to find the man responsible, and even suggested that his
&gt; views on capital punishment may have been swayed in light of the
&gt; shooting.

&gt; &quot;We're going to find the person who did this, we are going to find
&gt; them and they will be punished,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not a big death-penalty
&gt; advocate . . . but when I see an officer in the condition that this
&gt; officer is in, the grave condition, if he should lose his life in a
&gt; condition like this it really makes you start wondering.&quot;

&gt; Last night, police released an edited surveillance video of
&gt; yesterday's incident and the Sept. 18 robbery at the same location,
&gt; believed to have been committed by the same man.

&gt; Johnson noted that the assailant had a distinctive walk, &quot;some sort of
&gt; limp.&quot; There appeared to be at least three customers in the store
&gt; yesterday, when the gunman walked in with the hood of his sweatshirt
&gt; pulled up, shadowing most of his face. He could be seen on the video
&gt; pointing the gun at both cashiers and patrons inside the store.

&gt; Anyone with information on the suspect or his whereabouts is asked to
&gt; call the homicide unit at 215-686-3334 or 215-686-3335. The suspect is
&gt; considered armed and extremely dangerous and anyone who thinks they
&gt; see the man should dial 911 immediately.

&gt; A $50,000 reward has been offered by the Fraternal Order of the
&gt; Police, Pete Ciarrocchi of Chickie's and Pete's; Mike Driscoll of
&gt; Finnigan's Wake, and John Dougherty of the Electricians Local 98.

&gt; In an ironic twist, moments before receiving the call regarding
&gt; Cassidy, police officials were preparing to start a police plaque
&gt; dedication on nearby Limekiln Pike.

&gt; Police officials canceled the plaque dedication for officers James F.
&gt; Duffin and John P. Reid, who had been killed in the line of duty in
&gt; the 1970s. *

&gt; I have twice had to call to ask if a family member had been shot on duty,
&gt; and a third time to ask if one was in the Twin Towers. In all cases, the
&gt; answer was no, but it was hard to be too happy, since that just meant that
&gt; someone else's brother, father, daughter, sister-in-law, was the victim.
&gt; It's a horribly difficult and dangerous job, and things like this are the
&gt; nightmare, the fear, of every family of every big city cop in the country.
">

Unfortunately, he passed away the morning after he was shot. No arrest
yet, but I suspect it will be coming shortly.

The hypocrisy of the press is mind boggling. Last week they were
bitching about the undisciplined and unprofessional Philly PD killing
14 persons this year, even though 11 of them were armed with guns.
They accuse Philly cops of being too quick to use deadly force. I
guess we should compliment Officer Cassidy on his restraint.

On a positive note, there is a really fantastic memorial display at
the spot where he died. Thousands of Philadelphians have stopped by
there, leaving flowers and teddy bears. All races, creeds,
nationalities etc. Most of the visitors have been African Americans.
I'm not really surprised. I've always seen close relationships between
the police and communities in Philly, but it hasn't always been
highlighted in the media. We need more of that....

Now the press if throwing around the &quot;profiling&quot; issue...as if the
cops should be stopping white males in their search for this guy.
Here's a refreshing look at the issue...

Driven to Profile Black Males
Annette-John Hall
Philadelphia Inquirer
November 2, 2007

I am a black woman who was raised by a black man, married a black man,
and gave birth to a black son. I love black men. I am sustained by
them. I know first-hand how loving they can be. Which is why it breaks
my heart to even think this, let alone write it: I'm starting to
profile black men.

I know it's harsh. Lord knows I don't mean to sound like some of the
angry readers who are so quick to profile by race, who write
describing black men as nothing more than &quot;animals,&quot; &quot;baboons&quot; unfit
to walk the streets. Our hearts will never be in the same place.
Still, these days in this city - 336 homicides, mostly black men
killed and doing the killing, and now a 25-year veteran police officer
assassinated by another black man in a hoodie - it saddens me to know
that if I were to encounter a young black man on the street in a
hoodie, I would fear him.

I know I'm not the only one. If I were, 54 schools wouldn't have been
on lockdown during the manhunt in Philadelphia Wednesday. SWAT units
wouldn't be swarming. Stop-and-frisk wouldn't be in full effect in
West Oak Lane and all points north and south. Urban terrorism runs
rampant. Many killers are just kids who should be slinging backpacks
in school, not packing heat in doughnut shops. They are kids who look
like my 20-year-old son.

Yesterday, Officer Chuck Cassidy died, snuffed out at the hands of a
gunman trying to get money - a 6-foot-tall stocky black man with a
distinguishable tattoo on his left hand. From all reports, Cassidy,
only 54, was a good cop and loving family man who took pains to check
on a West Oak Lane Dunkin' Donuts because it had been robbed before.
People cried over him. That's how much they liked him.

Now he is dead, and his wife, son and two daughters are left to plan
his funeral. Officer Cassidy's death makes three cops shot this week,
five this year. If it's open season on the people who are supposed to
protect us, how safe are we? Not very.

I don't want to hear this nonsense about the police being the enemy in
the 'hood. Let's be real: It's not the police who are senselessly
gunning down black victims. It's mostly black perpetrators.

&quot;I'm not afraid of black men, I'm afraid for black men,&quot; Lisa Jones,
40, told me yesterday as we stood talking in front of a food store on
Ogontz Avenue in West Oak Lane. &quot;I have three sons, and I get very
nervous for them. For the good youth. They could be victims of the
perpetrators or the police.&quot; Given the all-out, unrelenting manhunt
for the gunman, Jones understandably is concerned - fearing a killer
at large and worried for the many innocent black males who fit the
profile. &quot;And I'm wearing a hoodie,&quot; sighed her 17-year-old son, Mark.
&quot;As a black man, I feel awkward. The police are going to look at you a
certain way - then you got to worry about a 12-year-old with a gun.&quot;

There was quiet tension in West Oak Lane yesterday. People went about
their business within the range of eagle-eyed officers in police cars
that cruised throughout the stretch from 77th Street south all the way
to Temple. Norma Burger, a 61-year-old retiree from Mount Airy who was
picking up her great-grandson from day-care, said that for the first
time she locked her car door when a young black man walked past. &quot;But
my main thing is, I'm embarrassed for the black race,&quot; said Burger,
who is African American. &quot;Every time you turn around, there's a black
man with a gun.&quot; She looked at me incredulously: &quot;Why do they have to
rob? Why can't they get jobs? They have no ambition. I worked 35 years
at my job, now my job is working for me. . . . I'm just ashamed about
what's happening.&quot;

As is Keisha LeCoeur, a 28-year-old African American who is, as many
are, praying for Officer Cassidy's family. &quot;It's really sad, the lack
of concern for the value of life,&quot; she said, shaking her head. On
Halloween night, LeCoeur said, she rushed into her house and stayed
in, &quot;something I never thought I'd do. &quot;I'm not scared of black men,
but I'm embarrassed, absolutely,&quot; she said. &quot;For all of this violence
to be attributed to African American men . . . it just gives cause for
other people to say, 'This is why we stereotype.' &quot;

Face it: We're in a crisis of spirit. And we're going to have to
battle it with some serious spiritual warfare. We all should be doing
our own personal gut-check, reordering our values, understanding that
no life is more precious than another. We shouldn't think twice about
turning in a killer.

African Americans once prided themselves on their dignity even in the
face of discrimination and hatred. Most of us still do. It's the
reason 10,000 African American men have committed to take a stand
against violence. Vowed to protect their women and children. That
notion doesn't frighten me. It reassures me. Still, I wonder.

On the way back from West Oak Lane, I stopped to watch the kids play
at Joseph Pennell Academics Plus School. Seeing young black boys,
innocent grade-schoolers, jockeying with each other, playing ball,
talking and laughing with girls during recess, I couldn't help but be
afraid - that one day these children might end up with a gun in their
hands or be a victim themselves. And that thought pierced me like a
bullet through the heart. Contact Annette John-Hall at 215-854-4986 or

Geez, Joe.  The Inky and the DN are owned by a bunch of wingers, so complain
to them.  The one beef I have with the media(especially TV) was I heard
tonight during a commercial break during the BC/FSU game that they have a
name for the shooter.  Of course the cocksuckers make you wait till 11 to
find out about it.  WTF is that all about?  Shouldn't the TV stations be
broadcasting the cocksuckers name and picture all over the place, to help
police?  Why say at 9 or 9:30 that they know and wait to tell us until 11?

&gt;&gt; Does he have any chance, Joe? It doesn't sound like it, but you pray, you

&gt;&gt; I have twice had to call to ask if a family member had been shot on duty,
&gt;&gt; and a third time to ask if one was in the Twin Towers. In all cases, the
&gt;&gt; answer was no, but it was hard to be too happy, since that just meant
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; someone else's brother, father, daughter, sister-in-law, was the victim.
&gt;&gt; It's a horribly difficult and dangerous job, and things like this are the
&gt;&gt; nightmare, the fear, of every family of every big city cop in the
&gt;&gt; country.

&gt; Unfortunately, he passed away the morning after he was shot. No arrest
&gt; yet, but I suspect it will be coming shortly.

&gt; The hypocrisy of the press is mind boggling. Last week they were
&gt; bitching about the undisciplined and unprofessional Philly PD killing
&gt; 14 persons this year, even though 11 of them were armed with guns.
&gt; They accuse Philly cops of being too quick to use deadly force. I
&gt; guess we should compliment Officer Cassidy on his restraint.

&gt; On a positive note, there is a really fantastic memorial display at
&gt; the spot where he died. Thousands of Philadelphians have stopped by
&gt; there, leaving flowers and teddy bears. All races, creeds,
&gt; nationalities etc. Most of the visitors have been African Americans.
&gt; I'm not really surprised. I've always seen close relationships between
&gt; the police and communities in Philly, but it hasn't always been
&gt; highlighted in the media. We need more of that....

&gt; Now the press if throwing around the &quot;profiling&quot; issue...as if the
&gt; cops should be stopping white males in their search for this guy.
&gt; Here's a refreshing look at the issue...

&gt; Driven to Profile Black Males
&gt; Annette-John Hall
&gt; Philadelphia Inquirer
&gt; November 2, 2007

&gt; I am a black woman who was raised by a black man, married a black man,
&gt; and gave birth to a black son. I love black men. I am sustained by
&gt; them. I know first-hand how loving they can be. Which is why it breaks
&gt; my heart to even think this, let alone write it: I'm starting to
&gt; profile black men.

&gt; I know it's harsh. Lord knows I don't mean to sound like some of the
&gt; angry readers who are so quick to profile by race, who write
&gt; describing black men as nothing more than &quot;animals,&quot; &quot;baboons&quot; unfit
&gt; to walk the streets. Our hearts will never be in the same place.
&gt; Still, these days in this city - 336 homicides, mostly black men
&gt; killed and doing the killing, and now a 25-year veteran police officer
&gt; assassinated by another black man in a hoodie - it saddens me to know
&gt; that if I were to encounter a young black man on the street in a
&gt; hoodie, I would fear him.

&gt; I know I'm not the only one. If I were, 54 schools wouldn't have been
&gt; on lockdown during the manhunt in Philadelphia Wednesday. SWAT units
&gt; wouldn't be swarming. Stop-and-frisk wouldn't be in full effect in
&gt; West Oak Lane and all points north and south. Urban terrorism runs
&gt; rampant. Many killers are just kids who should be slinging backpacks
&gt; in school, not packing heat in doughnut shops. They are kids who look
&gt; like my 20-year-old son.

&gt; Yesterday, Officer Chuck Cassidy died, snuffed out at the hands of a
&gt; gunman trying to get money - a 6-foot-tall stocky black man with a
&gt; distinguishable tattoo on his left hand. From all reports, Cassidy,
&gt; only 54, was a good cop and loving family man who took pains to check
&gt; on a West Oak Lane Dunkin' Donuts because it had been robbed before.
&gt; People cried over him. That's how much they liked him.

&gt; Now he is dead, and his wife, son and two daughters are left to plan
&gt; his funeral. Officer Cassidy's death makes three cops shot this week,
&gt; five this year. If it's open season on the people who are supposed to
&gt; protect us, how safe are we? Not very.

&gt; I don't want to hear this nonsense about the police being the enemy in
&gt; the 'hood. Let's be real: It's not the police who are senselessly
&gt; gunning down black victims. It's mostly black perpetrators.

&gt; &quot;I'm not afraid of black men, I'm afraid for black men,&quot; Lisa Jones,
&gt; 40, told me yesterday as we stood talking in front of a food store on
&gt; Ogontz Avenue in West Oak Lane. &quot;I have three sons, and I get very
&gt; nervous for them. For the good youth. They could be victims of the
&gt; perpetrators or the police.&quot; Given the all-out, unrelenting manhunt
&gt; for the gunman, Jones understandably is concerned - fearing a killer
&gt; at large and worried for the many innocent black males who fit the
&gt; profile. &quot;And I'm wearing a hoodie,&quot; sighed her 17-year-old son, Mark.
&gt; &quot;As a black man, I feel awkward. The police are going to look at you a
&gt; certain way - then you got to worry about a 12-year-old with a gun.&quot;

&gt; There was quiet tension in West Oak Lane yesterday. People went about
&gt; their business within the range of eagle-eyed officers in police cars
&gt; that cruised throughout the stretch from 77th Street south all the way
&gt; to Temple. Norma Burger, a 61-year-old retiree from Mount Airy who was
&gt; picking up her great-grandson from day-care, said that for the first
&gt; time she locked her car door when a young black man walked past. &quot;But
&gt; my main thing is, I'm embarrassed for the black race,&quot; said Burger,
&gt; who is African American. &quot;Every time you turn around, there's a black
&gt; man with a gun.&quot; She looked at me incredulously: &quot;Why do they have to
&gt; rob? Why can't they get jobs? They have no ambition. I worked 35 years
&gt; at my job, now my job is working for me. . . . I'm just ashamed about
&gt; what's happening.&quot;

&gt; As is Keisha LeCoeur, a 28-year-old African American who is, as many
&gt; are, praying for Officer Cassidy's family. &quot;It's really sad, the lack
&gt; of concern for the value of life,&quot; she said, shaking her head. On
&gt; Halloween night, LeCoeur said, she rushed into her house and stayed
&gt; in, &quot;something I never thought I'd do. &quot;I'm not scared of black men,
&gt; but I'm embarrassed, absolutely,&quot; she said. &quot;For all of this violence
&gt; to be attributed to African American men . . . it just gives cause for
&gt; other people to say, 'This is why we stereotype.' &quot;

&gt; Face it: We're in a crisis of spirit. And we're going to have to
&gt; battle it with some serious spiritual warfare. We all should be doing
&gt; our own personal gut-check, reordering our values, understanding that
&gt; no life is more precious than another. We shouldn't think twice about
&gt; turning in a killer.

&gt; African Americans once prided themselves on their dignity even in the
&gt; face of discrimination and hatred. Most of us still do. It's the
&gt; reason 10,000 African American men have committed to take a stand
&gt; against violence. Vowed to protect their women and children. That
&gt; notion doesn't frighten me. It reassures me. Still, I wonder.

&gt; On the way back from West Oak Lane, I stopped to watch the kids play
&gt; at Joseph Pennell Academics Plus School. Seeing young black boys,
&gt; innocent grade-schoolers, jockeying with each other, playing ball,
&gt; talking and laughing with girls during recess, I couldn't help but be
&gt; afraid - that one day these children might end up with a gun in their
&gt; hands or be a victim themselves. And that thought pierced me like a
&gt; bullet through the heart. Contact Annette John-Hall at 215-854-4986 or

&gt; CRITICAL CONDITION
&gt; Officer Shot Down in West Oak Lane
&gt; Philadelphia Daily News
&gt; November 1, 2007

&gt; The life of a cop hangs in the balance, the third officer shot in a
&gt; week. Massive manhunts and fear blanket the city, and the mayor says
&gt; he's rethinking his attitude on capital punishment.

&gt; WITH PHILADELPHIA Police Officer Charles Cassidy collapsed next to a
&gt; trash can, a bullet embedded in his brain, the man who shot him
&gt; carried out one final insult against the veteran lawman.

&gt; Carrying his own gun in one hand, the brazen thug stole the officer's
&gt; police-issued revolver from the sidewalk and ran.

&gt; Cassidy, a police officer of 25 years and a married father of three,
&gt; remains in &quot;extremely, extremely, extremely&quot; critical condition at
&gt; Albert Einstein Medical Center, Police Commissioner Sylvester John-son
&gt; said.

&gt; Yesterday morning's shooting at the Dunkin' Donuts on North Broad
&gt; Street near 66th Avenue, in the city's West Oak Lane section, prompted
&gt; one of the largest and most intense manhunts in Philadelphia history.

&gt; The shooting outraged local officials reeling over the fact that
&gt; Cassidy was the fourth Philadelphia police officer shot this year -
&gt; the third this week, and the second in just 12 hours.

&gt; Cassidy was doing a routine check of the restaurant in light of a
&gt; Sept. 18 robbery there that police now believe was conducted by the
&gt; same perpetrator. As Cassidy approached the establishment around 10:30
&gt; a.m. yesterday, an employee told him that a robbery was under way
&gt; inside.

&gt; With a hand on his pistol, Cassidy opened the door, alarming the would-
&gt; be robber, who abandoned his pursuit for cash and instead fired at
&gt; Cassidy's head, lodging a single bullet deep into his brain.

&gt; &quot;He didn't try to wound him, he assassinated him,&quot; Johnson said.

&gt; Dunkin' Donuts clerk Sandra Kim said that Cassidy, who is &quot;always so
&gt; nice,&quot; comes into the store &quot;every day, twice a day&quot; and orders a
&gt; large coffee with cream and sugar. Kim was behind the counter when the
&gt; gunman came in and demanded money.

&gt; &quot;He saw the cop coming in and shot him outside just as he was opening
&gt; the door,&quot; Kim said. &quot;I heard the shot and then I ran outside and saw
&gt; him lying there. I immediately started crying. I was crying for four
&gt; hours straight.&quot;

&gt; Within minutes, officers from &quot;every single district in the city&quot;
&gt; converged on the scene, Johnson said. More than 300 multi-divisional
&gt; officers, including a large SWAT contingent, combed through the Mount
&gt; Airy and West Oak Lane neighborhoods.

&gt; Marked and unmarked police cruisers, crime-scene units, K-9 units and
&gt; medics lined a stretch of Broad Street from 65th Avenue northward.

&gt; A sheriff's van was even used to ferry police officers to the scene
&gt; from the Criminal Justice Center, where they had been testifying in
&gt; other cases.

&gt; Mayor John F. Street, who spent most of the morning at the hospital
&gt; with Cassidy's family, reiterated his calls for stronger gun laws. He
&gt; said the amount of blood on Philadelphia's streets as a result of
&gt; illegal firearms seems to have no effect on policies in Harrisburg or
&gt; Washington.

&gt; &quot;Unless we can get control over the proliferation of illegal guns,
&gt; then the people who are most at risk are, of course, the members of
&gt; the Police Department,&quot; he said. &quot;If [legislators] don't have any
&gt; concern at all for the kind of violence that we are seeing on the
&gt; streets of cities all over the country today, then I don't know what
&gt; would cause them to have a renewed consciousness.&quot;

&gt; Johnson said his officers are being &quot;basically assassinated&quot; by armed
&gt; and violent criminals.

&gt; &quot;The availability of weapons in our city . . . the availability of
&gt; guns are really completely out of hand here in the city of
&gt; Philadelphia,&quot; he said. &quot;Legislators have to realize that we have a
&gt; gun problem.&quot;

&gt; The Democratic nominee for mayor, Michael Nutter, said the recent rash
&gt; of police shootings highlights an &quot;ongoing pattern of behavior.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I think Stevie Wonder would see, or Jose Feliciano would see, that
&gt; there's obviously a problem here,&quot; he said. &quot;We have people who are
&gt; actively and aggressively taking on the Philadelphia Police
&gt; Department.&quot;

&gt; Nutter pledged that if elected, his administration, which will include
&gt; a new police commissioner, will change the &quot;entire philosophy&quot; of how
&gt; the city fights crime.

&gt; Yesterday, the city tried to fight this crime by every available
&gt; means. Police searched through apartment complexes, homes and even a
&gt; nearby cemetery. Clues were sought in sewer inlets, trash receptacles
&gt; and low-lying brush.

&gt; Officers rounded up several men who vaguely fit the description of the
&gt; suspect, a 5-foot-11 to 6-foot, stocky black male with an identifying
&gt; tattoo on his left hand. But as of last night, the assailant had not
&gt; been apprehended.

&gt; Sources at the scene said that two door handles were removed from the
&gt; front door of the Dunkin' Donuts to try to obtain the gunman's
&gt; fingerprints.

&gt; Many people watched the day's organized chaos on the sidelines,
&gt; including Moseh, a SEPTA cop for five years who asked that his last
&gt; name be withheld.

&gt; &quot;I came here in search of a better life,&quot; said Moseh, who is from
&gt; Jamaica. &quot;That life isn't here. I'm going to leave for sure.&quot;

&gt; Yet, amid the pain and suffering, small acts of kindness broke through
&gt; a bleak day.

&gt; The Salvation Army brought lunch to people on the scene, police
&gt; cruisers escorted Cassidy's family members to the hospital, and dozens
&gt; of police officers - many of them top brass in plainclothes - streamed
&gt; into the emergency room.

&gt; &quot;There is a wonderful spirit of solidarity. Everyone is helping,
&gt; everyone is praying,&quot; said Cardinal Justin Rigali, who spent about an
&gt; hour at Cassidy's side.

&gt; Rigali said that another priest had administered a last-rites ceremony
&gt; for Cassidy before he had arrived.

&gt; &quot;You can imagine the sorrow, the suffering, the immense pressure that
&gt; is on the family,&quot; he said. &quot;They are people of faith, they are people
&gt; of hope.&quot;

&gt; Street vowed to find the man responsible, and even suggested that his
&gt; views on capital punishment may have been swayed in light of the
&gt; shooting.

&gt; &quot;We're going to find the person who did this, we are going to find
&gt; them and they will be punished,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not a big death-penalty
&gt; advocate . . . but when I see an officer in the condition that this
&gt; officer is in, the grave condition, if he should lose his life in a
&gt; condition like this it really makes you start wondering.&quot;

&gt; Last night, police released an edited surveillance video of
&gt; yesterday's incident and the Sept. 18 robbery at the same location,
&gt; believed to have been committed by the same man.

&gt; Johnson noted that the assailant had a distinctive walk, &quot;some sort of
&gt; limp.&quot; There appeared to be at least three customers in the store
&gt; yesterday, when the gunman walked in with the hood of his sweatshirt
&gt; pulled up, shadowing most of his face. He could be seen on the video
&gt; pointing the gun at both cashiers and patrons inside the store.

&gt; Anyone with information on the suspect or his whereabouts is asked to
&gt; call the homicide unit at 215-686-3334 or 215-686-3335. The suspect is
&gt; considered armed and extremely dangerous and anyone who thinks they
&gt; see the man should dial 911 immediately.

&gt; A $50,000 reward has been offered by the Fraternal Order of the
&gt; Police, Pete Ciarrocchi of Chickie's and Pete's; Mike Driscoll of
&gt; Finnigan's Wake, and John Dougherty of the Electricians Local 98.

&gt; In an ironic twist, moments before receiving the call regarding
&gt; Cassidy, police officials were preparing to start a police plaque
&gt; dedication on nearby Limekiln Pike.

&gt; Police officials canceled the plaque dedication for officers James F.
&gt; Duffin and John P. Reid, who had been killed in the line of duty in
&gt; the 1970s. *

Rumor has it that this guy's family gave him up. A 150,000 dollar

They recovered the guns from his aunt's home today, including
Cassidy's gun.
The kid's mother reported her gun stolen shortly after Cassidy was
shot. I'm not sure if that's how the police focused on them or not,
but it appears that her gun was the murder weapon. Seems that
relatives helped the kid escape to points South....now it's a
nationwide hunt. He can't hide for long, he's only 21. He's probably
holed up at some cousin's house in Baltimore or South Carolina. I
wouldn't want to be in his shoes at this point.

A veteran Linden cop here in NJ had a VERY close call just late last
week. The vest saved him:

Lucky to still be alive, Linden cop recuperates at home

A 24-year veteran is hit with a .38-caliber slug at point-blank range

Sunday, November 04, 2007
BY JONATHAN CASIANO
Star-Ledger Staff
Linden Police Officer Dave Manganiello was back home yesterday, sore,
bruised and a little tired, but thankful to be alive after being shot
Friday evening at a check-cashing store while investigating a
suspicious customer.

Manganiello's bulletproof vest stopped a gunman's point-blank shot and
as a result, the 24-year veteran officer escaped serious injury and
won't even need a hospital bed for his recuperation.

The 52-year-old officer was released from University Hospital in
Newark Friday evening, less than three hours after a man trying to
cash fraudulent checks at Speedy Check Cashing on Routes 1&amp;9 suddenly
pulled out a revolver and shot him.

Yesterday, at his home in Union County, Manganiello's wife said she
never expected her husband would be shot in the line of duty, and
expressed her gratitude for the equipment that saved his life.

&quot;He's fine. He's bruised, but he's in good spirits,&quot; Sue Manganiello
said in a brief interview, adding that her husband was resting. &quot;He's
always been a big proponent of the vest. Police officers, and
firefighters too, they deserve the best equipment available because
they're the ones who protect us.&quot;

Meanwhile, Linden police yesterday identified the alleged gunman as 34-
year-old Leonardo Grullon, whose last know address was in Elizabeth.
Grullon has been charged with attempted murder of a police officer,
armed robbery, aggravated assault, possession of a weapon for an
unlawful purpose, unlawful possession of a weapon and theft by
deception, Linden police Lt. Raymond Tyra said.

He was being held yesterday in the Union County Jail in lieu of $1.5
million bail.

Authorities were also continuing to search for an unidentified woman
who is believed to have accompanied Grullon to the check-cashing
store. The woman, who was not in the store when the shooting occurred,
drove off after the shooting and police are not sure what role, if
any, she may have played in the crime.

The incident began around 6 p.m. Friday when Grullon walked into
Speedy Check Cashing on Routes 1&amp;9 South and tried to cash a $2,000
state unemployment check using a fake permanent resident alien card,
authorities said. Two other customers were in the store at the time.

Fred Padi, owner of Speedy Check Cashing, said yesterday that he
recognized Grullon from two previous occasions when, he said, he
successfully ran the same scam.
Padi, who said his father is a retired police officer in India, said
he called police immediately and then stalled on the phone while he
waited for officers to arrive.

&quot;Two times before he got me,&quot; Padi said of the suspect. &quot;I have his
photo pasted on the wall and we called the cops ... and told them
what's going on, that this is the guy you've been investigating.&quot;

When Manganiello arrived, Grullon tried to brush past him and leave.
Manganiello grabbed him by the arm and asked him to stay, Tyra said.
Grullon pushed back.

Grullon then pulled out a .38-caliber revolver and shot Manganiello in
the chest, Tyra said.

Padi said he heard two shots, the second of which he said lodged in
the store's ATM machine.

&quot;It put a nice hole in the ATM machine,&quot; Padi said. &quot;If (Manganiello)
wasn't wearing his vest I'm sure he would've been dead.&quot;

After firing the shots, Grullon took off across the busy highway,
police said. Manganiello, though thrown against a wall of the store's
small vestibule by the force of the shot, was able to radio in a
description of the shooter.

Grullon was arrested on a side street a couple blocks away after a
brief struggle with police, Tyra said. The gun used in the shooting
was found in some bushes.

Police officials praised Manganiello for his bravery and wished him a
speedy recovery.

&quot;He has always been one of our most dedicated and conscientious
officers,&quot; Linden Police Chief Michael Boyle in a statement. &quot;We can
all breathe a sigh of relief ... that this officer is alive and well,
and that his assailant is in custody.&quot;

Lots of guns out there...&lt;sigh&gt;

&gt; &gt; was going.  Stuff like that.  The thing is, why does the news give a
&gt; &gt; tease about such a thing.  The public good ought to outweight the TV
&gt; &gt; station's stupidity in that case.

&gt; They recovered the guns from his aunt's home today, including
&gt; Cassidy's gun.
&gt; The kid's mother reported her gun stolen shortly after Cassidy was
&gt; shot. I'm not sure if that's how the police focused on them or not,
&gt; but it appears that her gun was the murder weapon. Seems that
&gt; relatives helped the kid escape to points South....now it's a
&gt; nationwide hunt. He can't hide for long, he's only 21. He's probably
&gt; holed up at some cousin's house in Baltimore or South Carolina. I
&gt; wouldn't want to be in his shoes at this point.

&gt; A veteran Linden cop here in NJ had a VERY close call just late last

He's a lucky man. Geez, It's amazing that there are still lots of cops
out there who refuse to wear those vests. He's living proof of their
value.

Meanwhile, they grabbed the guy who shot Cassidy. He was arrested in a
homeless shelter in Miami last night. One less asshole out there.

Suspect apprehended in Officer Cassidy's slaying

Philadelphia Police this morning have apprehended suspect John Lewis
in the slaying of Officer Chuck Cassidy. Lewis was caught at a
homeless shelter in Miami at 7 a.m., according to media reports.

Police have scheduled a press conference for 9 a.m. this morning.

This ends an intense manhunt for the man who gunned down the officer
during an armed robbery Wednesday.

Police identified the suspect as John Lewis, 21, an Olney High School
dropout whose mother is a corrections officer for the Philadelphia
Prison System.

Police said they learned that a relative had purchased a bus ticket
for Miami over the weekend for Lewis, and that Lewis would have
arrived in Florida late Sunday.

Miami police were alerted to the manhunt, and Lewis' name and
description were added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List.

Two guns that police said were linked to the slaying were recovered
Monday afternoon from a house in the 3800 block of North Franklin
Street in Hunting Park, the residence of an acquaintance of Lewis'.

One was the officer's 9mm Glock semiautomatic, stolen when Cassidy was
gunned down.

But a law-enforcement source said later Monday that the second handgun
recovered that day was not the firearm reported missing by Lewis'
mother, Lynn Dyches, a corrections officer in the Philadelphia Prison
System. Police initially suspected that the mother's gun may have been
used in the slaying.

Cassidy, a 25-year police veteran, was shot Wednesday after walking
into a Dunkin' Donuts in North Philadelphia as it was being robbed. He
died the next day.

An arrest warrant was issued early Sunday. &quot;Lewis expressed a desire
not to be captured,&quot; according to a federal affidavit filed in support
of the arrest warrant.

Police as well as Lewis' relatives had put out a public appeal for him
to surrender, and police said they had pressured Lewis' known
associates to turn him in.

The warrant, which suggested that Lewis might intend to flee to
Maryland, said that two witnesses identified the suspect. It also said
that Lewis' family indicated he was &quot;responsible&quot; for Cassidy's
killing.

Investigators had said they were expanding their search to another
state on the East Coast where Lewis may have acquaintances.

Police Commissioner Sylvester M. Johnson said earlier today that leads
to Lewis' whereabouts continued to pour in.

&quot;We know exactly who we're looking for, which is a positive thing,&quot;
Johnson said at an impromptu noontime briefing outside Police
Headquarters. &quot;Now our next step is apprehend him.&quot;

Police this morning questioned an individual who may have been in
contact recently with Lewis. Authorities confiscated a vehicle as part
of the investigation.

Authorities had offered a reward, which grew in the last few days to
$153,000, for information leading to the arrest and conviction of
Cassidy's killer.

Dozens of law enforcement officers last night raided a neighborhood
close to the Dunkin' Donuts where Cassidy was shot. They searched an
apartment complex at 70th Avenue and North Broad Street.

The arrest warrant, signed by Federal Magistrate Timothy Rice on the
affidavit of FBI Agent Vito Roselli, said that Lewis had a friend in
Baltimore and authorities were concerned that he might try to flee
across state lines.

An informal memorial of flowers, stuffed animals and tributes
continued to pile up outside the doughnut shop at 6620 N. Broad St.

The Dunkin' Donuts owner mounted a plaque at the memorial, noting that
the shop would remain closed until after Cassidy's funeral Wednesday
out of respect to the officer who regularly stopped in at the shop as
part of his security rounds.
