Dear Anglican and Lutheran Friends:

It is Canada Day Weekend, and we in
in this country are celebrating our
140th birthday!

This mailing begins the third year of
Colleagues List, and for the sake
of archive order, I will include a
number for every forthcoming issue.

*****

Last weekend, the Canadian Anglican and
Evangelical Lutheran churches held their
national synods in Winnipeg.

Now, I share some key news releases from
both events, and comment on what happened.

*****

Philip Jenkins offers an interesting take
on european Christianity which I have
located in the journal - Foreign Policy.
I share it with you here. As usual, the
author is well worth reading because what
happens in Europe affects North Americans
and others too.

*****

Stephen Lewis has piqued the interest
of many in the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund. I found
a helpful article on the bank in
Christianity Today, and thought you
might appreciate it too.

*****

One-time student, now colleague
Karen Turner - was intrigued by the
article by Timothy Luke Johnson
last weekend about the real issue behind
the current sexuality debates in the
churches. Karen offers her thoughts and
a conceptual model that has helped her.

Much appreciated, Karen!

*****

My gleanings from various internet
websites this week offer a potpourri
from around the world.

In Canada, a new coadjutor bishop, Father
Murray Chatlain, will be replacing retiring
Oblate Bishop Denis Croteau, Yellowknife, NT.
Croteau turns 75 this year.

I grew fond of Bishop Denis, twenty years ago,
after first meeting him while working in the
Mackenzie River Valley of Canada's far north.
At the time, I was researching my doctoral
dissertation concerning the future of the church
in the Western Arctic. This territory composes
the largest Roman Catholic diocese in the world.

I will always have a special place in my
heart for Denendeh and Deh Cho (the Dene
terms for the land and the great river)
so news about the church there always
interests me. Perhaps it will you too.

*****

Many Canadians consider their countryman
John Hutt the greatest Shakespearean actor
of our time. He died this week, and a memorial
service for him is being planned for St. James
Anglican Church, Statford, Ontario.

*****

With his July Context newsletter, colleague
Nartin Marty includes quoteable quotes from
Vaclav Havel (To the Castle and Back, 2007)
and Francis S. Collins (The Language of God,
2006). Thanks, Marty, for these gems.

*****

My teaching colleague at St. David's,
Jock McTavish, has a way with words. He also
has mounted a whole archive of poetry, which
I encourage you to bookmark and revisit.

Recently, our Adult Spiritual Development
Ministry committee had a wonderful end-of-term
BarBQue in our backyard.

The event, and a family of peregrine
falcons - an adult pair and three kids
screaming overhead (from a nest across
the street) - prompted special thoughts
in Jock's fertile mind.

I share his instructions to locate
these poems and his entire work, below.

*****

For the next two months, Colleagues
List will be delivered to your inboxes
every second week.

For those of you in the northern hemisphere,
please enjoy a good, restful summer!

Canadian Lutherans elect their first woman leader

Vancouver (ENI). The Rev. Susan Johnson is to become the first woman to hold
the post of national bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada.
&quot;I'm just overwhelmed and honoured by this incredible honour,&quot; Johnson said
after her election at the denomination's national convention in Winnipeg.
She will succeed National Bishop Raymond Schultz, who announced in January
that he will retire on 1 September 2007.  Meanwhile, the Anglican Church of
Canada, meeting in Winnipeg at the same time as the ELCIC, has elected
Bishop Fred Hiltz as its new primate, or national leader. He defeated Bishop
Victoria Matthews of Edmonton in the final ballot. [287 words, ENI-07-0488]

Bishop Fred Hiltz elected Anglican Primate

Winnipeg, June 22, 2007 -- The Anglican Church of Canada has chosen Bishop
Fred Hitz of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island as its 13th Primate or
national leader.

Bishop Hiltz was elected by the church's General Synod, meeting in Winnipeg,
on the 5th ballot, from among four bishops nominated last April by a
gathering of all Canadian bishops.

Bishop Hiltz, 53, will succeed Archbishop Andrew Hutchison, elected three
years ago, who announced earlier that he would retire at the end of the
General Synod gathering now underway.

Bishop Hiltz was elected assistant bishop of the diocese of Nova Scotia and
Prince Edward Island in 1995 and elected diocesan bishop in 2002. He was a
member of the Council of General Synod from 2001 to 2004 and, since, 2006,
has served as the Anglican Co-Chair of the Anglican-Lutheran International
Commission.

In a statement after his nomination for the primacy, Bishop Hiltz described
the Primate as &quot;a servant of the people of God (whose) ministry is the
gather the Church, to unite its members in a holy fellowship of truth and
love, and to inspire them in the service of Christ's mission in the world.&quot;

He is married to Lynne Samways and they have one son.

unions is not in conflict with the church's core doctrine, in the sense
of being credal.

The motion carried reads: &quot;That this General Synod resolves that the
blessing of same-sex unions is not in conflict with the core doctrine
(in the sense of being credal) of the Anglican Church of Canada.

The motion was carried by a vote of 152 for, 97 against in the house of

Canadian churches reject same-sex blessings

Vancouver (ENI). Canada's Anglican and Lutheran churches have each turned
down proposals to approve ceremonies of blessing for same-sex unions. The
general synod of the Anglican Church of Canada, meeting in Winnipeg,
narrowly defeated a resolution that would have allowed dioceses to decide
for themselves whether or not to bless same-sex unions. &quot;There is
disappointment - a lot of pain. Some people will be saying, 'How long, O
Lord, how long?’&quot; said Bishop Fred Hiltz of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward
Island, who was elected during the synod to be the denomination's new
primate, or national archbishop.  Meeting separately in Winnipeg, delegates
to the convention of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada defeated a
proposal to introduce same-gender blessings.

News Release from the National Office of the ELCIC
June 23rd, 2007

Motion to Encourage Synods to Develop Ways to Best Minister to People Living
in Committed Same-Sex Relationshis is Defeated

Winnipeg, 20 June 2007 -- After much thoughtful, considerate and respectful
discussion, reflection and prayer, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada
(ELCIC) voted to defeat a motion before delegates at the Eleventh Biennial
National Convention to encourage Synods to develop ways ³to best minister to
people who live in committed same-sex relationships, including the
possibility of blessing such unions². The motion was voted on by secret
ballot during the afternoon session on the third day of convention.

The motion received 181 votes in favour and 200 votes in opposition.

Introduction to the motion by Roger Kingsley, Vice-President of the ELCIC,
noted, that at the 2005 National Convention, after the defeat of a
local-option for same-sex blessing, a motion was approved by delegates
stating ³That our church's leaders, congregations and Pastors Œseek to
maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace¹ (Ephesians 4:3)
rejecting all words and actions hostile to gays and lesbians in our churches
and communities, and taking steps to create a more welcoming environment in
this Church for gays, lesbians and their families.¹²

The announcement of the motion was greeted by silence from the delegates.

Anglican Motion A187  read:

&quot;That this General Synod affirm the authority and jurisdiction of any
diocesan synod,

1. with the concurrence of the diocesan bishop, and
2. in a manner which respects the conscience of the incumbent and the will
of the parish,

- to authorize the blessing of committed same-sex unions.&quot;

General Synod commits to pastoral care of same-sex couples

Winnipeg, June 25, 2007 -- General Synod Monday approved a statement from
the House of Bishop urging the church to show pastoral understanding and
sensitivity to all same-sex couples, including those civilly married.

The statement also commits the House to develop pastoral strategies to give
effect to the acceptance of gays and lesbians to whom &quot;we are already
committed by previous General Synod and Council of General Synod
resolutions, House of Bishops guidelines and Lambeth Conference statements.&quot;

Bishop Patrick Yu of Toronto, one of the authors of the statement, said the
question now is &quot;how do we move forward in a situation of no consensus. We
bishops represent a diverse group,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a fragile situation.&quot;

On Sunday, a motion to authorize the blessing of committed same-sex unions
was passed by laity and clergy but defeated in the House of Bishops.

Same-sex unions and the Anglicans

Canada's Anglican bishops are entitled to refuse blessings for same-sex
marriages. That's legal in Canada, but no law compels clergy to endorse it.
Nonetheless, the decision is disappointing.

My Comments:

It is now over a week sincce the Anglicans and Lutherans completed their
parallel and, in a true sense, complementary synods in Winnipeg. This lapse
of time provides some distance for an assessment of what took place within
and between these two mainline denominations who, earlier this decade,
formed a partnership, not a merger.

I will present my thoughts on what I saw transpiring; using the themes of
mainstreaming, maturing and mentoring.

While each church body dealt with many important matters, what dominated in
both were the election of national leaders and the decision regarding the
blessing of same-sex relationships. So it was in terms of these activities
that I selected the news releases provided, above and concerning which I
now offer my thoughts.

Mainstreaming of Two Denominations

While it may be assumed that Lutherans and Anglicans share much in common
with their european origins and catholic liturgical tradition, they have
very different  cultural histories in Canada. The Church of England, which
became the Anglican Church of Canada during the twentieth century, has
represented Anglo-Saxon cultural privilege while the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in Canada, now but a score of years old, was formed from a series of
mergers of many north european ethnic Lutheran groups (mainly Gernman,
Scandinavian and Baltic in origin) who were linked only because of a common
Lutheran confressional tradition. Cultural privilege is not part of that
heritage.

Stated differently (as a friend once suggested to me) ³We Lutherans worked
in the factories; the Anglicans owned and operated them.³

In modern Canada, Lutherans and Anglicans have lost much of these old
stereotypical characteristics. Lutherans have emerged from their largely
agricultural  roots to share middle class values and benefits with many
other Canadians. Anglicans on the other hand, while retaining certain
archaic behaviours, have gravitated toward the middle class as part of
the democractization of Canadian society.

Mainstream middle class values, neither elitist nor minority ones, are
shared by most Anglicans and Lutherans today. On the whole, that has been
a positive development for both groups.

Maturing of Relationships

Because both now occupy a more level playing field and a similar niche in
the Canadian religious ethos, each tradition has gifts to offer the other
in ways that were not so previously evident. This opportunity has not gone
unrecognized in many local settings.

When they determined to walk together six years ago in Waterloo Ontario,
they chose a new ecumenical modus operendi. Rejecting patterns of the past
that represented a ³merger³ of traditions, Anglicans and Lutherans chose
³partership³ as their way of living the intended relationship. Each church
body would retain its individual identity, but both determined to walk
together in a covenant of mutual affirmation and admonition.  Taking their
cue from many modern marriages, they did not view their nuptuals as
supressing individuality to form a common bond. The submission of one
partner to the other is not what this relationship is about.

It can now be said - less than a decade into the marriage - that while the
opening matrimonial phase has been cautious, it has also proven the
partnership model to be a good one to follow. The fact that both
denominations held their national synods in the same city and shared parts
of their agenda in a positive way was a commendable sign of maturation.

Comparisons are inevitable.

Both elected new national leaders. For the first time in their history, and
after three men, the Lutherans chose a woman as national bishop - Susan
Johnson. The Anglicans came close to doing the same, but in the end, bishop
Fred Hiltz of Nova Scotia edged out bishop Victoria Matthews of Edmonton
for the position of primate.

While each church has been struggling in its own way with the issue of the
contentious issue of blessing same sex relationships, there is no doubt
that they are observing and learning from the experience of the other.

Mentoring of Canadian Christianity

While other Canadian mainline denominations (such as the United and
Presbyterian churches of Canada) are also contributing to what some now call
³the emerging Christian way³ to contemporary Christian church renewal,
Anglicans and Lutherans can share helpful ministry experience with other
Canadian churches; and not just with those in the Protestant mainstream.
They are demonstrating that churches with a long history of ministering
pastorally in this land can constructively work through very serious
challenges to their witness and unity.

Of course, there continues to be impatience reflected in the reaction of the
progressive wings of both denominations, and fears of losing important
values on the part of the conservatives.

Will traditional Anglican and Lutheran elements decide to go it alone in the
wake of increasing social pressures to change? Will liberals in both
communities decide to conduct blessings of same-sex couples in spite of the
close negative decisions that were made in Winnipeg?

I would like to believe that when the Canadian church history of this era is
written, it will be said that majorities in both denominations found ways to
work together. Then perhaps the concern will prove unfounded that I
expressed at the time of the Lutheran-Anglican nuptuals. What I saw
happening last weekend in Winnipeg was not a demonstration of two failing
denominations sinking together, but early signs something new and exciting
that Christians in general can celebrate - the beginnings of an Emerging
Christian Way.

EUROPE¹S CHRISTIAN COMEBACK

Foreign Policy
June, 2007

http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3881

Europe¹s Christian Comeback
By Philip Jenkins

Alarmist pundits prophesy that a secular Europe risks being overcome by its
fast-growing Muslim population. Yet for all we hear about Islam, Europe
remains a stronger Christian fortress than people realize.

The West is awash with fear of the Islamization of Europe. The rise of
Islam, many warn, could transform the continent into ³Eurabia,² a term
popularized by Harvard historian Niall Ferguson and other pundits. ³A
youthful Muslim society to the south and east of the Mediterranean is poised
to colonize‹the term is not too strong‹a senescent Europe,² Ferguson has
predicted. Such grim prophecies may sell books, but they ignore reality. For
all we hear about Islam, Europe remains a stronger Christian fortress than
people realize. What¹s more, it is showing little sign of giving ground to
Islam or any other faith for that matter.

To be fair, the trend is counterintuitive. Europe has long been a malarial
swamp for any traditional or orthodox faith. Compared with the rest of the
world, religious adherence in Europe is painfully weak. And it is easy to
find evidence of the decay. Any traveler to the continent has seen
Christianity¹s abandoned and secularized churches, many now transformed into
little more than museums. But this does not mean that European Christianity
is nearing extinction. Rather, among the ruins of faith, European
Christianity is adapting to a world in which its convinced adherents
represent a small but vigorous minority.

In fact, the rapid decline in the continent¹s church attendance over the
past 40 years may have done Europe a favor. It has freed churches of trying
to operate as national entities that attempt to serve all members of
society. Today, no church stands a realistic chance of incorporating
everyone. Smaller, more focused bodies, however, can be more passionate,
enthusiastic, and rigorously committed to personal holiness. To use a
scientific analogy, when a star collapses, it becomes a white dwarf‹smaller
in size than it once was, but burning much more intensely. Across Europe,
white-dwarf faith communities are growing within the remnants of the old
mass church.

Perhaps nowhere is this more true than within European Catholicism, where
new religious currents have become a potent force. Examples include
movements such as the Focolare, the Emmanuel Community, and the
Neocatechumenate Way, all of which are committed to a re-evangelization of
Europe. These movements use charismatic styles of worship and devotion that
would seem more at home in an American Pentecostal church, but at the same
time they are thoroughly Catholic. Though most of these movements originated
in Spain and Italy, they have subsequently spread throughout Europe and
across the Catholic world. Their influence over the younger clergy and lay
leaders who will shape the church in the next generation is surprisingly
strong.

Similar trends are at work within the Protestant churches of Northern and
Western Europe. The most active sections of the Church of England today are
the evangelical and charismatic parishes that have, in effect, become
megachurches in their own right. These parishes have been incredibly
successful at reaching out to a secular society that no longer knows much of
anything about the Christian faith. Holy Trinity Brompton, a megaparish in
Knightsbridge, London, that is now one of Britain¹s largest churches, is
home to the amazingly popular ³Alpha Course,² a means of recruiting
potential converts through systems of informal networking aimed chiefly at
young adults and professionals. As with the Catholic movements, the course
works because it makes no assumptions about any prior knowledge: Everyone is
assumed to be a new recruit in need of basic teaching. Nor does the
recruitment technique assume that people live or work in traditional
settings of family or employment. The Alpha Course is successfully geared
for postmodern believers in a postindustrial economy.

Alongside these older Christian communities are hugely energetic immigrant
congregations. On a typical Sunday, half of all churchgoers in London are
African or Afro-Caribbean. Of Britain¹s 10 largest megachurches, four are
pastored by Africans. Paris has 250 ethnic Protestant churches, most of them
black African. Similar trends are found in Germany. Booming Christian
churches in Africa and Asia now focus much of their evangelical attention on
Europe. Nigerian and Congolese ministers have been especially successful,
but none more so than the Ukraine-based ministry of Nigerian evangelist
Sunday Adelaja. He has opened more than 300 churches in 30 countries in the
last 12 years and now claims 30,000 (mainly white) followers.

Ironically, after centuries of rebelling against religious authority, the
coming of Islam is also reviving political issues most thought extinct in
Europe, including debates about the limits of freedom of speech, freedom of
religion, and the right to proselytize. And in all these areas,
controversies that originate in a Muslim context inexorably expand or limit
the rights of Christians, too. If Muslim preachers who denounce gays must be
silenced, then so must charismatic Christians. At the same time, any laws
that limit blasphemous assaults on the image of Mohammed must take account
of the sensibilities of those who venerate Jesus.

The result has been a rediscovery of the continent¹s Christian roots, even
among those who have long disregarded it, and a renewed sense of European
cultural Christianity. Jürgen Habermas, a veteran leftist German philosopher
stunned his admirers not long ago by proclaiming, ³Christianity, and nothing
else, is the ultimate foundation of liberty, conscience, human rights, and
democracy, the benchmarks of Western civilization. To this day, we have no
other options [than Christianity]. We continue to nourish ourselves from
this source. Everything else is postmodern chatter.² Europe may be
confronting the dilemmas of a truly multifaith society, but with
Christianity poised for a comeback, it is hardly on the verge of becoming an
Islamic colony.

Philip Jenkins is distinguished professor of history and religious studies
at Penn State University and author of God¹s Continent: Christianity, Islam,
and Europe¹s Religious Crisis (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007).

WHAT'S REALLY BEHIND THOSE CHURCH SEXUALITY ISSUES?
June 22nd, 2007

From Colleague Karen Turner

Wayne,

Interesting tidbit from today's colleagues list...

What it all boils down to for me is a relationship paradigm called the Drama
Triangle by a fellow called Karpman.  If you are not familiar with it, it is
an interesting look at those negative/energy sucking relationships that seem
to play out the same way, time after time, with no real conclusion.  Like a
hamster on its wheel-spinning, spinning, spinning, headed nowhere, but
exhausted because of the running.  A brief taste of it can be found at this

Traditional Japanese drama finds echoes in the Bible, says theologian

Tokyo (ENI). The classical Japanese drama form called Noh is rarely seen as
being linked to Biblical studies. However, in a new book, theologian Yuko
Yuasa suggests there are similarities in the portrayal of women in this
traditional drama and in the Christian scriptures. In &quot;Noh Drama and the
Bible - Stories of women that resonate with each other&quot;, Yuasa identifies
five  heroines of Noh drama who, she says, are related to female characters
in the Bible.  The Biblical figures range from Miriam in the Old Testament
to Mary Magdalene in the New Testament. Noh is a classical Japanese form of
performance that dates from the 14th century. It combines elements of dance,
drama, music and poetry. It features, with slow movements and distinctive
masks, gods, warriors, beautiful women, contemporary figures, and
supernatural beings. [511 words, ENI-07-0496]
