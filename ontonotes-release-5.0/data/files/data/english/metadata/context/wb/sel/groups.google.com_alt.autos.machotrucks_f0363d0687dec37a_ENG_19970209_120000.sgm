I have a chance to buy a 86 F-250 4x4 ext cab xlt with a 460. I can get the truck for about
4300.00. Its got like 120,000 mi . Its in pretty good shape, I drove it today, the only thing I
noticed was the brakes pulsated really bad, and when in 4 wheel, it sounded like universals were
sqeaking. Is this a good price for these trucks? I know the ext cabs are popular now .
Any info apreciated.
