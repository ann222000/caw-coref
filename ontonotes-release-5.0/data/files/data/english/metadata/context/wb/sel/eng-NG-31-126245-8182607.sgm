Being sensitive to the use of terms like 'spouse' and 'partner' in English,
I was quite surprise to run across the following today while translating a
newspaper article from 2001.

（彼女の）人生の伴侶も（歌手だと）。[kanozyo no zinsei no hanryo mo kasyu da to]

Wow. I had never encountered this phraseology in Japanese before. I love it.

The article in question was written by a (Japanese) cultural news reporter
for the Yomiuri Shimbun, so I wonder about the former... I suspect that the

Interesting. Thanks for that. It's still a good term to know.

Speaking of opera singers... RIP, Beverly Sills. She had a set of

Thanks, Peter! I actually don't have recent, first-hand experience of using
or hearing what they are called in Japanese, so I really couldn't answer.
Somehow the words 連れ合い and 相棒 come to mind, though. I personally like 連れ合い a
lot. :-)

パートナー can also be used to mean &quot;an equal partner in the relationship&quot;
rather than have an unbalanced relationship where one person makes all the
decisions and the other just follows.  It was used this way on a recent TV
show, 冗談じゃない.  The line was something like,

付いていくだけじゃいやよ。パートナーになりたいの

Anyway, just wanted to reinforce that you have to pay attention to the
context, not trying to say that the above is wrong.

&gt; 人生の伴侶

I don't know if anyone's bothered to google this term, but it seems
relatively common (50,000+ hits). As Brian said, he came across this
term in an article from 2001, so it is at least 6 years old and usage
has probably gone up since then.

I've only glanced at the search results, but I get the impression that
the Japanese term takes a slightly broader meaning than the English
&quot;life partner&quot;. (For example, one Amazon.com reviewer refers to heavy
metal music as his/her 人生の伴侶, and the Japanese Wikipedia article on
&quot;companion animals&quot; (コンパニオンアニマル) also uses the term: 単なる愛玩物・所有物としてのペットで
はなく、「人生の伴侶」としての動物であるとして....)

Anecdotally, my own life partner and I (still unmarried) brainstormed
a while back about how to refer to each other in Japanese. To her (a
NJS), 彼氏・彼女 just felt too weak, and strictly speaking 旦那・妻 were also
out. We (somewhat jokingly) decided to simply use パートナー.

My 学研国語大辞典 indicates 【伴侶】 has been in use for a while.

◆弥勒の野に静に幼な児を伴侶として居るさびしき友の心を思うと書いてあった
〔田山花袋(明治五～昭和五) ･田舎教師〕

◆鴎(ｶﾓﾒ)に似た鳥が一羽伴侶もなく翔(ﾄ)んだ
〔宮本百合子(明治三二～昭和二六) ･伸子〕

Google finds some 侶伴 (characters reversed) in 漢文.
&quot;の伴侶&quot;　gets variations like 魂の伴侶、生涯の伴侶、最良の伴侶、永遠の
伴侶．．．．

As for &quot;significant other&quot;, 重要な他者sounds rather chockie but is found
in the following text:
http://tms.tamacc.chuo-u.ac.jp/pdf/tankyu01.PDF
個人に影響を与える人物のことを重要な他者
（Significant other）と呼ぶ（安達，1987）。

quote from Wikipedia:

Its usage in both psychology and sociology is very different from its
colloquial use. In psychology, a significant other is any person who has
great importance to an individual's life or well-being. In sociology, it
describes any person or persons with a strong influence on an
individual's self-evaluation, which are important to this individual, as
well as reception of particular social norms. This usage is synonymous
with the term &quot;relevant other&quot; and can also be found in plural
form-&quot;significant others&quot;.

In social psychology a significant other is the parent, uncle,
grandparent, or teacher - the person that guides and takes care of a
child during primary socialization. The significant other protects,
rewards and punishes the child as a way of aiding the child's
development. This usually takes about six or seven years, and after that
the significant other is no longer needed, the child moves on to a
general other which is not a real person, but an abstract notion of what
society deems good or bad.

It's old. Kojien has a citation from the early 13th century. It also
exists in Chinese as banlu. I wouldn't be surprised if most languages

パートナー as I hear it used can mean the same-sex type, but more often I
think it means &quot;we aren't married, but we're in it for the long haul&quot; and
applies to heterosexual relationships.

I was not aware of the meaning of &quot;significant other&quot; in psychology, but I
am now.

I think we are talking about its meaning in colloquial use, which is fairly
roughly 恋人, or namely a lover but not a spouse.

It would be pretty awkward to introduce someone as one's 重要な他者 at a
party....

Mika, Mark,

Of course 伴侶 and 侶伴 by themselves are old, just as the English word
&quot;partner&quot; is also quite old. But I think Brian in the OP was talking
about the *new* meanings of &quot;partner&quot; and &quot;life partner&quot; that have
come into use as a result of GBLT awareness and an increase in non-
standard marriages/long-term relationships. The examples Mika cited
clearly do not have those meanings.

Alan,
As an equivalent for &quot;life partner&quot;, I think 彼氏 and 彼女 are pretty
weak. It's the same as if you were in a 10-year monogamous unmarried
relationship with someone, and still referred to them as &quot;boyfriend&quot;
or &quot;girlfriend&quot;. As for &quot;significant other&quot;, I agree with you that the
meaning generally means unmarried.

I think &quot;life partner&quot; in English has become a very general term for a
long-term human partner. Both married and unmarried, heterosexual and
homosexual relationships are included.

So what's a good Japanese phrase for that?

PS - from Wikipedia: &quot;A Life partner is a romantic partner for life.
This can be same-sex or opposite-sex, married or without marriage, and
monogamous or polyamorous.&quot;

I always thought that these were more closely aligned to boyfriend/girlfriend.

I sometimes refer to my wife as 「女房」 with the intent to mean &quot;my
better half&quot; although I doubt that the particular Japanese person I
may be talking to interprets it that way.

I see what you mean, but I got the feeling that 彼氏 and 彼女 can refer to a
stronger and more long-term relationship than the English &quot;boyfriend&quot; and
&quot;girlfriend.&quot; For example, I recall a fairly mature Japanese lady referring
to a somewhat younger live-in lover as her 彼氏. Maybe she was being a bit
&quot;girlish&quot; in her choice of words, but she didn't seem the slightest bit
embarrassed about it. Similarly, I recall 彼女 being used by a Japanese man
to refer to the other party in a long-term extramarital arrangement.

Somehow, I can't quite picture either of these people using パートナー.

I think there's a difference between North American and British usage
here. Over the past twenty years or so,  I've become accustomed to hear
&quot;partner&quot;  only in reference to same-sex relationships. Reading fiction
written in the UK, I was at first surprised to see characters refer to
their heterosexual lovers or spouses as their &quot;partner,&quot;  but I guess
that's the norm there.

It might be a regional thing, as you say. I have seen this same phenomenon
here in California where not only homosexual but also heterosexual live-in
lovers are also now being called &quot;partners.&quot; This may have something to do
with some recent laws that established &quot;domestic partnership&quot; status which
confers some or all of the rights and responsibilities of marriage to those
couples registering as such.

Those are interesting counterexamples. In contrast, as I explained
previously my NJS told me that I was no longer &quot;just a 彼氏&quot; after she

That's my general impression, too. I didn't know that about UK usage.
Now that you mention it, &quot;partner&quot; can also be used like in the
question, &quot;How many partners have you had?&quot; (e.g., during an STD
check). I suppose that's just short for &quot;sex partners&quot;, but it does
make &quot;partner&quot; by itself sound like someone in a short-term
relationship.

It is NOT. It has been around (as others have already shown) for
centuries.

If anything, the Japanese word 妻, which originally could be applied to
male or female, is &quot;partner&quot;. Even today, one side of a pair of things
can be called つま, especially if the item is something that hangs (like
curtains). The left and right parts of a garment that join or overlap
are also called つま。

If you want to know what gay Japanese partners call eachother, you might
want to ask some gays. Don't be surprised when words like だんな, 恋人,
and 同居人 come back at you. Although I'm not at all familiar with
what's used in any gay subcultures here, in common discourse, I haven't
noticed the use of any special words.

Another REALLY common word for husband, wife, partner, etc., is つれ or
つれあい. This is common among people who don't think the nuances of,
especially, 家内 and 女房 apply. Though far more common these days, its
use too is not new (let alone an influence from outside). I also
wouldn't be surprised if gays used it.

My favorite word for &quot;my wife,&quot; though, is one few non-Japanese seem to
be aware of (or, at least, few non-Japanese who are in the
criticize-Japan business), is かみさん. Even my 21 year old son refers
to his 23-your old wife &quot;kamisan&quot; sometimes (though he usually uses her
name).

One acquaintance who has lived with his (female) partner for about 20
years refers to her as 同居人.

Perhaps Mika or Shinya could give some better explanations about the
finer nuances of these usages.

Projecting Euro-American (especially American) concepts and perceptions
on Japanese words of seemingly similar meaning entails great dangers, if
you ask me.

Fwiw,

it is our job to be sensitive to such changes. Or to go back to the

Being partnered to a gay Japanese male, I can tell you that we usually refer
to one another as 旦那 to one another or when with friends. In English he is
my partner, although once we are legally wed here in Canada, he will be my
husband and I his. (Which reminds me how I was frequently asked by older
women, both Japanese and non-, when I lived in Japan, which one of us was
the 'wife'. Had I wanted a wife, I said, I'd have been straight.)

My partner's mother refers to me as お友達さん, which is quaint and cute. Among
our gay Japanese friends, mostly based in the Tokyo area, 彼氏 is for
relationships that are fairly new still, 旦那 is for longer-term arrangements.
兄貴 is heard now and then too, but that's another topic...

I was also talking about 人生の伴侶 as a subset of 伴侶: it's been

happened to notice it recently. I'm glad that Anthony has found an
expression he's been searching for for years, one that he's known must

and has finally (yippee!) found--that still happens to me a lot, too.

歌が歌手の人生の伴侶だ is nothing new. What an NHK program with the

Did I recommend that gays refer to their partners as 妻? It would not
surprise me if some of them did (such is the flexibility of Japanese).
Nevertheless, I was commenting on the development of the word: it is
only more recent history that tsuma has come to refer to only the female
partner in a relationship, and that although it translates into English
as &quot;wife&quot;, it can have some very different nuances.

I'm not sure when tsuma came to refer to only a female partner, much
less a (legal) spouse; nor am I sure which class began using it first.
But equating it with &quot;wife&quot; in an English sense, except in its
post-Meiji meaning, is inaccurate.

I don't expect everyone to know this sort of detail about a word--not
your Taro-in-the-steet is aware of all these things any more; but I do
if you're going to cast doubt on the information I provided.

Japan (or both).

Of course being sensitive to (such) changes in Japanese is part of our
job (as it is with regard to our other language as well--nothing can be
funnier to see a modern translation written in the language of the 1960s).
It, like maintaining confidentiality in all circumstances, is a mainstay

Probably because 人生の伴侶 belongs on the list of terms I listed. It is
the Japanese equivalent of &quot;life partner&quot; or &quot;partner for life&quot; or even
&quot;fellow traveler through life&quot;, albeit regardless of the marital status
or sexual orientation of the people involved.

To be honest, I don't think this is any kind of &quot;new concept&quot; among the
Japanese. What makes you so sure that the Japanese don't already have
expressions that are specific to gay life partnerships? (I don't know
whether they do, but I'm sure there are a few people on this list who
can speak up on that aspect of the language.)

Everybody knows what an おかま is; do you know what お鍋 and おこげ (or
おこげ族) refer to? The language is rich in such expressions.

That's what I thought might be the case. 人生の伴侶 can be just another
tool in your box, so to speak--especially in situations where naming
your partners biological sex is irrelevant or disadvantageous.

Fwiw, I think だんな implies a far tighter relationship than 同居人
would.

Btw, one more partnership term that seems to be gender-neutral, is うち
のひと, and I wouldn't be surprised if it worked among gays, too.

For whatever reasons--i.e., good (&quot;gay or straight: Does it matter?&quot;)or
bad (&quot;Gay? Get outta here!&quot;)--in Japanese, the preference seems to be to
use normal, everyday words that don't make any particular statement.

If only English were so simple.

When I was working for an extremely homophobic boss in Japan many years ago,
he would often inquire into my personal life, and I always did the pronoun
switch, something that gays did/do in English in similar situations (which I
thankfully haven't encountered since moving to Washington State in 1998 and
then to BC last year).

The (perhaps not-so-) strange thing was that I heard from so co-workers
years after I left that job that the boss knew that I was probably gay
anyway. Heck, the astronauts on the ISS can probably tell that I'm gay. Of
course, his term for what he thought I was was 普通ではない人. Which is just as
nasty on my ear as 'abnormal' is in English, but it didn't bother my partner
for a while until he heard me say, 我々は非普通ではないよ to someone else in retort.

Jim, I'm really not trying to pick a fight with you or lecture you. I
appreciate and respect the etymological knowledge you bring to the
table. But you also seem to be insinuating that some of us in this
discussion are &quot;projecting Euro-American notions&quot; or have an anti-
Japanese streak, and that's just not the case.

As for whether 人生の伴侶 *in the OP's context* is new, first consider the
English &quot;life partner&quot;. &quot;Life partner&quot;, in and of itself, is probably
older than you and I put together. But only the last few decades has
it come to take on a new meaning; specifically, &quot;a romantic partner
for life. This can be same-sex or opposite-sex, married or without
marriage, and monogamous or polyamorous.&quot; (Wikipedia). That doesn't
mean there weren't other pre-existing terms before (like &quot;partner&quot;),
just that a new term has appeared that is useful because it
specifically refers to romantic partnerships, but is general enough to
include almost any kind of committed relationship between two people.

I know that 伴侶 is positively ancient, and 人生の伴侶 has also been around
for a while. I also noted that its meaning is fairly broad (see my
first post in this thread). The question is whether 人生の伴侶 is starting
to coalesce into a term with the same kind of connotation that &quot;life
partner&quot; now has in English. You don't seem to agree, and point to the
fact that 人生の伴侶 has been around for ages. But similarly the English
&quot;life partner&quot; has been around for ages, too, but that doesn't mean
there isn't something new about the specific connotations it has
recently acquired.

words in a newspaper.

I'd say it's at least Meiji vintage, probably older. (It also comes in
the common variant 生涯の伴侶, by the way.) One clue to its age is the
not infrequent metaphorical extension of its usage. Your 人生の伴侶
could be money, a car, a house, etc. - anything you've got (or intend to
keep) for life (like it or not).

Not only that, but 人生的伴侶 and 生涯的伴侶 (something perhaps like the
Chinese equivalent, Kirill?) each get more than 20,000 hits, which isn't
too shabby for a Chinese hit.

Either way, it's been around a long time, and it's highly unlikely that
the phrase was coined on the basis of &quot;life partner&quot; which is still so
awkwardly new in English that it sounds like an inept translation from
some Japanese katakana phrase.

'S not.

Gee, Anthony didn't seem to take offense at anything I wrote; why do you?

I concede that you're right about my reading of （彼女の）人生の伴侶も（歌手だと）,
though I cannot get that she's a lesbian just from that sentence.

And I was annoyed at all the &quot;gee, I wonder ifs&quot; going back and forth,
since &quot;a little research [should] have sufficiently convinced [anyone] that
人生の伴侶 is old.&quot; (Although that doesn't mean I don't appreciate
Anthony's delight at his discovery--I DO appreciate that.)

As far as my implying anything about people on this list: Unless I wrote
otherwise, I was writing about generalities. So if the foo don't shit,
don't wear it.

But now that this branch of the thread has developed into a proverbial
pissing contest, I suppose we won't get the useful and usually
interesting input from Mika, Shinya, Shu and maybe some other Japanese
participants--all of whom probably walked away from this thread holding

&gt; One acquaintance who has lived with his (female) partner for about 20

I've also heard うちのワイフ, but that might have been for my benefit. But
it did seem to me to reflect different attitudes of young people that don't
want to use 家内or 女房。

It's not uncommon in Japan now (though of course not universal). And I've
heard middle-aged men use it too.

One of the funniest was one man who referred to his wife as 家外 rather than
家内, but only among friends who knew that his wife was very involved with a
lot of different activities outside the home.

For the latter, probably, but to the extent that anyone talks about
homosexual relationships, I'm guessing that 人生の伴侶 probably had some
currency, if only because of its metaphorical scalability. In other
words, if you a singer can plausibly call &quot;songs&quot; her 人生の伴侶, then I
doubt anyone would look askance at someone who described his better half
in those words.

Actually, I've read that homosexuality was as common among samurai as it
was among the Greeks (the classical variety), so there probably was a
whole gaggle of terms they used to describe the relationships.

&gt; As far as my implying anything about people on this list: Unless I wrote

&gt; don't wear it.

&gt; But now that this branch of the thread has developed into a proverbial

Precisely, Shinya. I suppose the reason I found it worth commenting on to
begin with is that the singer in question was describing the man (an
operatic bass) to whom she is married. Yes, I wanted to use it to describe
my own relationship, but she was using it right after she remarked on how
she wanted to be like Mirella Freni and her (now deceased) husband, Nicolai
Ghauriov, the famous basso profundo (and thanks to Wikipedia for helping me
figure out how to romanize ガウリオヴ.

1.概念レベルにおける&quot;significant other&quot;

(as used in &quot;interviews&quot;, books, blogs, and between the 2 people in
conversations defining their relationship/commitment)

伴侶 is a good GBLT neutral term, I think. I erroneously cited samples
from (1a) earlier, which confused Matthew, but the same dictionary
provides &quot;vintage&quot; samples for (1b) as well, which I will copy below.

In English, words seem to define and shape thoughts far more so than in
Japanese.
In English, as I observe, choice of words is a big deal.
In Japanese, words are relative to its surroundings.  Words can easily
be &quot;out of place.&quot;

My metaphor of the day is that Japanese is kaleidoscopic: different
words unfold just by slightly tilting the tube, even though what's in
the tube is the same.

2.日常レベルにおける&quot;significant other&quot;

At a party, a man introduces his (male partner/wife/girlfriend):
&quot;This is my significant other.&quot;
「ぼくの(人生の)伴侶です。」

Okay, an enlightened person may actually say it that way; but it has to
be said to &quot;receptive listeners&quot; in certain context.  The Japanese
statement carries far heavier message than the English
pseudo-equivalent.

At least to me, 伴侶 is too BIG of a word for person-to-person level
usage.

So, what DO they say in similar situations?
Many suggestions have been made in this thread already.

A: speaker is a married/unmarried man
○（うちの）家内です。女房です。かみさんです。連れ合いです。などなど。
×　妻です。　（Somehow, it doesn't carry the  &quot;significant other&quot;
connotation to me.)

B: speaker is a married/unmarried woman
○（私の）だんなです。
It doesn't mean &quot;my master&quot; (yuck!) at least in modern usage.
Some women (in English) use the term &quot;significant other&quot; for 情の通った
人, I think.
Therefore, だんな seems like a likely candidate for the &quot;significant
other.&quot;

○主人です。（うちの）連れ合いです。
When everything else that is shared in life is taken into account, as
opposed to 情 only.

×　夫です。(Not appropriate for the same reason above.)

C: speaker is a gay man/woman

お友達さん makes sense, and I like that.  Plus 連れ合い、同居人and
whatever else.
Understatement fits better in many cases than overdoing it, I think.
------------------
It looks like the term 伴侶　has been there for a long time, reserved
for timeless partnerships that transcends gender, marriage and social
constraints.

〔文語･文章語〕

I've been lurking through the life of this thread and I didn't want
to speak up for fear of displaying my ignorance but I notice that the
term I've heard/used most often (as a man married to a woman) has yet
to &quot;come out&quot; &lt;g&gt; on these listings and I was just curious if there's
some connotation I'm missing.  I am of course referring to 奥さ
ん.  Does the mention of this word hurt the ears? Is there any
particular reason it hasn't been brought up, considering nearly every
other word for spouse has made an appearance.  Perhaps it's not
suited for the GBLT context but the OP was talking about a
heterosexual marriage, and people have mentioned 女房、妻、配偶
者、家内、（家外）、連れ合い、かみさん、ワイフ and maybe more.
Was it just an obvious contender that needed no mention? Does it feel
cold or old-fashioned and not reflecting the warmth of the
relationship intended by 伴侶 and the others?  Is this not a
good term for polite company unless you're making an &quot;old ball-n-
chain&quot; style reference?  What am I missing?

Inquisitively,

&gt; than in Japanese.
&gt; In English, as I observe, choice of words is a big deal.
&gt; In Japanese, words are relative to its surroundings.  Words can
&gt; easily be &quot;out of place.&quot;

&gt; My metaphor of the day is that Japanese is kaleidoscopic: different
&gt; words unfold just by slightly tilting the tube, even though what's
&gt; in the tube is the same.

&gt; 2.日常レベルにおける&quot;significant other&quot;

&gt; At a party, a man introduces his (male partner/wife/girlfriend):
&gt;  &quot;This is my significant other.&quot;
&gt;  「ぼくの(人生の)伴侶です。」

&gt; Okay, an enlightened person may actually say it that way; but it
&gt; has to be said to &quot;receptive listeners&quot; in certain context.  The
&gt; Japanese statement carries far heavier message than the English
&gt; pseudo-equivalent.

&gt; At least to me, 伴侶 is too BIG of a word for person-to-person
&gt; level usage.

&gt; So, what DO they say in similar situations?
&gt; Many suggestions have been made in this thread already.

&gt; A: speaker is a married/unmarried man
&gt; ○（うちの）家内です。女房です。かみさんです。連れ合いです。な
&gt; どなど。
&gt; ×　妻です。　（Somehow, it doesn't carry the  &quot;significant
&gt; other&quot; connotation to me.)

&gt; B: speaker is a married/unmarried woman
&gt; ○（私の）だんなです。
&gt;  It doesn't mean &quot;my master&quot; (yuck!) at least in modern usage.
&gt;  Some women (in English) use the term &quot;significant other&quot; for
&gt; 情の通った人, I think.
&gt;  Therefore, だんな seems like a likely candidate for the
&gt; &quot;significant other.&quot;

&gt; ○主人です。（うちの）連れ合いです。
&gt;  When everything else that is shared in life is taken into account,
&gt; as opposed to 情 only.

&gt; ×　夫です。(Not appropriate for the same reason above.)

&gt; C: speaker is a gay man/woman

&gt; お友達さん makes sense, and I like that.  Plus 連れ合
&gt; い、同居人and whatever else.
&gt; Understatement fits better in many cases than overdoing it, I think.
&gt; ------------------
&gt; It looks like the term 伴侶　has been there for a long time,
&gt; reserved for timeless partnerships that transcends gender, marriage
&gt; and social constraints.

Chris,

奥さん cannot be used when referring to your own wife.  As a general
rule, you cannot add さん to yourself or your family, when addressing to
someone outside of your family.

奥さん is either the wife of whom you're speaking to, someone else's
wife, or the wife herself (the lady you're speaking to).

If I missed something, hope others will set me straight :)
