"/> Colin, I'd like to make a suggestion. Would you please add the cut-off
date/minimum age things have to be to be considered appropriate to the

collectibles to stop posting in these newsgroups!

"/> Jennifer,
I think it would help, too, to let people know that they can post FS
and WTB ads that are for items that are not 50 years old or even
better- 100 years old- to the rec.collecting newsgroup. If people
knew of this newsgroup, the postings of non-antiques to
rec.antiques.marketplace may decrease. Thank you-
Lynn

"/> I assume you are thinking mainly of the postings in
rec.antiques.marketplace ?

A footnote could be added if it would be helpful. Would someone like
to suggest the wording for such an appendix ?

I have just acquired an old sea/tool chest from an outdoor barn and would
like to refinish it. Not to worry, it would not be destroying a fine
speciman, someone has tacked carpet on the outside, and the handles an
grommets are missing... just a good old dovetail box.. It had a very
pretty dull green paint? on it that I WOULD LIKE TO DFGH RESTORE&lt; Any
suggestions ? Milk paint ?? Any sources ? Thanks

Karl
