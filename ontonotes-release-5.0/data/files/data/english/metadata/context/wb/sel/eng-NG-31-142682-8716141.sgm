Democrats go after Limbaugh
By Klaus Marre
October 01, 2007

Democrats on Monday called on the chief executive of Clear Channel Communications to
denounce remarks by radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, whom they say made a
“hateful” and “unpatriotic” attack on U.S. troops opposed to the war in Iraq.

At issue is a remark from Limbaugh that characterized such troops as “phony
soldiers.” Democrats have seized on the issue, allowing them to hit back at
Republicans who similarly latched onto a MoveOn.org ad that referred to Gen. David
Petraeus as “General Betray Us.”

“Thousands of active troops and veterans were subjected to Mr. Limbaugh’s unpatriotic
and indefensible comments on your broadcast,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
(D-Nev.) said in his letter to Clear Channel Chief Executive Mark Mays. “We trust you
will agree that not a single one of our sons, daughters, neighbors and friends
serving overseas is a ‘phony soldier.’ We call on you to publicly repudiate these
comments that call into question their service and sacrifice and to ask Mr. Limbaugh
to apologize for his comments.”

On his show Monday, Limbaugh blasted Democrats for their criticism, saying it is part
of a smear campaign aimed at discrediting him.

“If anybody in this country has been trying to demoralize the troops, it is you, sir,
and your members of the Democrat Party,” Limbaugh said. “You have waved the white
flag of defeat.”

Reid stated that he is confident that “Republicans join with us in overwhelming
numbers,” arguing that “anything less would be a double standard that has no place in
the United States Senate.”
The Democratic leader stated that the letter would be available all day to allow
other senators to sign on.

The letter points to a December 2006 poll that shows more service members disapproved
of President Bush’s handling of the war than voiced their support for it.

“From this figure alone, it is clear that Mr. Limbaugh’s insult is directed at
thousands of American service members,” the letter said. In remarks on the Senate
floor, Reid noted that Limbaugh’s show is broadcast on Armed Forces Radio, indicating
that this makes the matter even worse.

The Democratic leader voiced his strong support for the First Amendment but said in
this case Limbaugh went “way over the line.”

He blasted the popular talk show host for attacking the “courage and character of
those fighting and dying for him and for all of us.”

Senate led by a liar?

You're several months out of date -- Republicans have not been in
charge of the Senate since mid-January.
