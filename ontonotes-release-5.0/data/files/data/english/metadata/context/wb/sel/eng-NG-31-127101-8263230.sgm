It's a fairly complex science, but easy to understand at least the basics.
I'm doing a project just now that my dietician looks over for obvious
rubbish.
Steve asked about nutrient absorption from raw cabbage - good news is yes,
you will get MOST - if not then almost all of them, but if you want to get
the soluble fibre content in adequate amounts, you have to kick-start the
digestive process by at LEAST &quot;Wilting&quot; the vegetable with moist heat -
i.e. - steam or boil for just a minute.
Our own digestive enzymes and stomach acids are simply not up to the job of
completely processing out the soluble fibre.
An exception I'm looking into is Saladdy veggies dressed with acids - e.g. -
Lemon juice /vinegars, such as a Cole slaw made with a low-fat acid base
dressing.
Soluble fibre helps control cholesterol levels in particular HDL.
Eating veggies overcooked you've lost most of the micronutrients in the
cooking medium - unless it's a soup or stew, cooked with the lid on.
(Nutrtients esp water solubles WILL evaporate from an open pot, but in the
case of wok cookery and stir-frying, the time taken isn't long enough for
very much to be lost, especially if the heat is fierce and the cooking time
short)

Insoluble fibre can be broken down too far by excessive cooking, making it
unsuitable for the reason the Lord probably designed it - to push consumed
food through the gut and prevent constipation and the formation of
alfatoxins from only partially digested foods becoming a problem.

In fact, over here, we have a type of Cabbage sold under the name
&quot;Sweetheart&quot; which is meltingly tender and ideal for eating raw. It's pale
green and shaped like a tall pine cone. It's not so good cooked.  Winter
Cabbages and Savoy types in MY opinion (which is my own and not to
everyone's tastes) do need some cooking, especially the outer leaves - the
deep green ones, BUT be careful in eating TOO much dark-green leaved
cabbage. They contain much more Copper and Iron than the cabbage hearts do.
I'm all for eating as many veggies as near to the raw state as can be
comfortably managed.
Chasjack's Stir-fry sounds a terriffic meal and a great way to enjoy
veggies.
Right now - or for the past while, I've been working on the correct spice
mixture to sauce a meatless stir-fry that has broccoli, cauliflower,
brussels sprouts, carrot and onion and the inevitable chillies. I've started
using Walnut oil for certain stir-fries that dont require a true fiery heat.
Olive oil gets bitter and the Omega-3 content is damaged at heat.  For fiery
heat stir-fries, I use Peanut Oil which has a higher flash point and doesn't
denature so quickly at high temperatures.  It's almost impossible to buy
REAL Canola oil over here.

Hope that helps. If anyone wants specific info or help - well, that used to
be my job. Just ask.
Hughie.

Hello, Hugh:

Right now, the main ingredient in the family's stir-fry here is wax beans,
as they're ready in the garden.  Our zucchini failed, not sure why, so I
get that at the market.  We're getting some second heads on the broccoli,
and, provided the demon bunnies don't get to them first, we should be all
set.  Tomatoes very soon, too.

There was one thing you wrote that I wanted to ask about:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Is there fake canola oil sold, too?!  There was a recent report on our
National Public Radio (NPR) about fake olive oil marketed here in the
States, but I've always figured I could trust the canola oil ... Jeez!

Charlie,
I should have put that better. I didn't mean to say FAKE Canola!
There is Canola available but at hellish prices and generally only by postal
shopping.
What we DO have here is Rapeseed oil, which Canola is made from, but the
Rapeseed Oil here is loaded with Omega-6's.
The food processing industry here has still to cotton on to Canola or
refining plain Rapeseed Oil to make it a healthy choice rather than the
killer it currently is.

Thankyou for that.
I'm always interested in reading other views on diet for PCa that may help
us all.

Thanks for the signature, Idaho.  I was about to ask.

Based on your recent posts, you have researched this disease considerably
and are already aware that those are pretty good numbers.

I hope you stick around for the 40 or so years you have left.

Hi Steve,

Thank you for the well wishes!

My entire biological family lives a long time.  My mother will be 93
soon all of of her sisters reached their 90's.  My dad passed away at
84 (no cancer history at all) and could have been around longer with
better medical care than he received in So. California (btw... I'm not
bashing California... I was raised there and loved it)... my dad
didn't have the best doctors but I'm keeping all the fond memories of
him close.

Steve, I hope you're around for a long time as well !!!

It is an inspiration to have veterans around like you.

Thanks again,

Idaho
