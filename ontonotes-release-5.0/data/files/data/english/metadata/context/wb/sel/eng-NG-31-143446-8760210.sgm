1) The Sickness That Is  Wahhabi Islam

THE FAMILY SECURITY  FOUNDATION - By Adrian Morgan - August 8, 2007
The kingdom  of Saudi Arabia officially came into existence in 1932. The Al
Saud clan, led by  Abdul Aziz bin Saud (c. 1880 - 1953), had by this time
gained total control of  the region formerly known as Arabia. The process of
forcing rival clans into  submission began at the start of the 20th century. Aziz
was supported by members  of a movement called the Ikhwan, or Brotherhood. Aziz
founded the Ikhwan from  disparate Bedouin tribesmen in 1912. These religious
fanatics shared the same  brand of fundamentalist faith as Aziz, but they
later objected to the clan  leader's alliance with the British &quot;Christians.&quot;
Eventually, the relations  between the Ikhwan and Aziz soured, and by 1930 the
future monarch had  annihilated them as a force.

The Ikhwan followed the branch of Islam  known as Wahhabism. This intolerant
and extremist ideology had been formulated  by Muhammad Ibn Abd al- Wahhab
(1703-1792). Wahhab had been forced to flee from  Medina, and he found protection
in the person of Abdul Aziz's ancestor, Muhammad  Ibn Saud, in 1744. At this
time, the al-Saud family was based at the town of  As-Dariyah in Najd region,
near Riyadh. Wahhab's philosophy was derived directly  from Ibn Taymiyyah:
worship at shrines was considered forbidden, leading to a  ban on tomb markers.
Anyone who did not conform to Wahhab's strict  interpretation was a heretic,
and deserved to be killed. Like Ibn Taymiyyah,  Wahhab saw any &quot;innovations&quot;
(bida) in Islam to be heretical. For the  theologians of Al Azhar University in
Egypt, the ideology of Wahhab was  primitive.

Muhammad Ibn Saud was given religious &quot;legitimacy&quot; as a ruler  over Najd by
his association with Wahhab. By the time he died in 1765, the  family which had
developed as olive grove owners in the 16th century was as  powerful as any
other tribal group in Arabia. Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab was  virulently
opposed to the Shi'a branch of Islam, and condemned their pilgrimages  to shrines of
their saints. After his death, his followers (who called  themselves
muwahiddun or &quot;unitarians&quot;) seized the Iraqi Shiite city of Karbala  in 1802, where
they destroyed the shrine of Imam Husain. The following year,  they took control
of Mecca, prompting the Ottoman Caliphate to send a force to  reclaim the
holy city.

In 1891, the Al-Saud family was driven out of  Arabia by their rivals from
the Rashidi clan, who took control of Riyadh and its  environs. The al-Sauds
took up residence in Kuwait until January 15-16, 1902,  when Abdul Aziz bin Saud
and his supporters drove out the Rashidis from Riyadh.  The Rashidis remained
powerful, supported by the Ottomans and by Turkey. In  1921, assisted by his
camel-riding Bedouin followers of the Ikhwan, Abdul Aziz  forced the Rashidis
into submission, followed by an alliance.

British  meddling in Middle Eastern politics had seen two Hashemite brothers
placed as  rulers in Iraq and Transjordan in 1921. The Hashemites claim
descent from  Mohammed, and since the 10th century, the ruler (sharif) of Mecca was
traditionally a Hashemite. Since 1916, Sharif Hussein ibn Ali, supporting
British interests, declared Hejaz (the northwest of Arabia along the Red Sea,
comprising Jeddah, Mecca and Medina) to be independent of the Ottoman Turks.
Sharif Hussein ibn Ali's son 'Abd Allah was king of Transjordan and his brother
Faysal was king of Iraq. In March 1924 Sharif Hussein declared himself
&quot;Caliph&quot;,  shortly after the Ottoman Caliphate was abolished on the 3rd of that
month. By  September 1924, Abdul Aziz bin Saud and the Ikhwan took control of
Mecca,  leading Sharif Hussein ibn Ali to abdicate on October 5th and go into
exile.

Control of the Hashemite region of Hejaz led the Ikhwan to go north to
Transjordan in 1924, to claim that territory for themselves. The British, though
allied to and financing Abdul Aziz bin Saud, met the Ikhwan with force, leaving
alive only eight from a legion of 1,500. The Wahabbists objected to
minarets,  dancing and music. In 1921 Winston Churchill had warned the U.K. parliament
of  the extremism of the Wahhabists, saying: &quot;Austere, intolerant,
well-armed, and  blood- thirsty, in their own regions the Wahhabis are a distinct factor
which  must be taken into account, and they have been, and still are, very
dangerous to  the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.&quot;

In June 1926, the Ikhwan attacked a  traditional procession called the
mahmal. 25 people and 40 camels died. The  mahmal involved a caravan procession
carrying ornate curtains from Egypt to  Mecca, where these drapes were placed on
the Kaaba shrine during the Hajj  pilgrimage. According to Abdul Aziz bin Saud,
the violence occurred when members  of the procession had sounded trumpets in
the vicinity of a &quot;holy place.&quot; Bin  Saud had earlier tried to prevent the
mahmal taking place.

From 1926  onwards, the Ikhwan staged minor revolts against Abdul Aziz, and
one faction  even tried to destroy the Kaaba at Mecca. In 1929, antagonism
between Abdul Aziz  bin Saud and the Ikhwan led to a showdown. The religious
authorities supported  the King, and he crushed the Ikhwan. He set up a National
Guard, and in 1932  announced himself king of Saudi Arabia. He had named the
entire region of Arabia  after his clan.
Vandalism  In The Name of Allah

In 1924, the Wahhabis had begun a campaign of  destruction of graves of
Muslim saints and imams. Even the tomb of Mohammed's  daughter Fatima, from whose
lineage the Mahdi (Messiah) will be born, was  destroyed. The Ikhwan had even
tried to desecrate the tomb of Mohammed, but had  been restrained by the Al
Saud chief. Under the rule of King Abdul Aziz and his  descendants, the
destruction of religious sites has been accelerating up to the  present day. Over the
past two decades, according to the Gulf Institute, 95% of  the ancient
buildings of Mecca have been demolished. Dr Sami Angawi, a Saudi  architect, claims
that now there are only 20 buildings which remain from the  time of Mohammed.

The tomb of Mohammed is in Medina. In the 1950s, the  Saudi establishment
decided to build a library over the grave site. The  architect gained a
compromise, by allowing the tomb to remain beneath the  library. The authorities intend
the tomb to be concreted over and made into a  car park. In 1998, the tomb of
Mohammed's mother, Amina bint Wahb, was bulldozed  and razed to the ground.
The house of Khadija, Mohammed's wife, is no longer  standing. It has been
replaced with public toilets. The house of Abu Bakr, the  first Caliph and father
of Mohammed's last wife Aisha, has vanished under the  foundations of a Hilton
hotel.

Even the cave where Mohammed is said to  have received his first revelations,
at the Al Nour Mountain, is being  considered for demolition. Prince Turki
al- Faisal wrote in response to a 2005  newspaper article condemning such
destruction that Saudi Arabia was spending  more than $19 billion preserving the
heritage of Mecca and Medina: &quot;[We are  aware] how important the preservation of
this heritage is, not just to us but to  the millions of Muslims from around
the world who visit the two holy mosques  every year. It is hardly something we
are going to allow to be destroyed.&quot;

The Grand Mosque of Mecca is now becoming dwarfed by high-rise  construction
projects, including the Zam Zam tower, being built by the Bin Laden  family. A
religious ideology that can render its own heritage obsolete, in case
pilgrimage (classed as &quot;shirk&quot; or &quot;polytheism&quot;) takes place, is destructive and
anti-cultural. The tribe of Al Saud spreads this ideology around the world,
funding madrassas and schools. The human beings who live under the intransigent
rule of Wahhabism are denied some of the basic rights we take for granted in
the  West.
Abuse In  The Name Of Allah

Saudi Arabia exports its Wahhabist ideology around  the world. In 2005,
Prince Alaweed bin-Talal made $20 million grants to the US  universities of
Georgetown and Harvard to promote &quot;Muslim- Christian  understanding&quot;, yet there is no
such tolerance of any other faith within Saudi  Arabia. No Bibles or
crucifixes can be brought in by visitors, and holding  Christian religious services
can lead to imprisonment.

Since 1926, the  Wahhabists have had mutawi'oon (also spelled muttawa or
mutawi,) who are  enforcers of &quot;virtue&quot; - the religious police. These Islamic
vigilantes wear red  and white check keffiyehs or headscarves, and have the power
to arrest people.  They belong to an official body called the Commission for
the Promotion of  Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, which has 10,000 members
in 486 centers  throughout the kingdom. The president of this commission is
Sheikh Ibrahim  Al-Ghaith. He stated in March this year that a royal decree was
issued on  September 7, 1980. This decree, said Al-Gaith, made the muttawa
follow strict  procedural guidelines.

He said: &quot;The commission plays a large role in  capturing people who practice
sorcery or delusions since these are vices which  affect the faith of Muslims
and cause harm to both nationals and expatriates.  The commission has
assigned centers in every city and town to be on the lookout  for these men. As for
their fate, they are arrested and then transferred to  concerned authorities.
The commission also has a role in breaking magic spells,  which are found in
the sea. We cooperate with divers in this aspect. After the  spells are found,
they are then broken using recitations of the Holy Koran. We  do not use magic
to break magic spells, as this is against the teachings of  Islam as mentioned
by the Supreme Ulema. But we use the Koran as did the Prophet  Muhammad
(peace be upon him).&quot;

Belief in sorcery and witchcraft seems  anachronistic in the 21st century,
but in November 2005 a chemistry teacher  found himself sentenced to three
years' imprisonment and 750 lashes, for mocking  Islam and studying witchcraft.
Those who had accused Mr. Muhammad Al-Harbi were  his own students. In December,
Mr. Al-Harbi was granted a pardon by King  Abdullah.

In June last year, Sheikh Ibrahim Al-Ghaith launched a  campaign to stamp out
practices of &quot;witchcraft&quot; amongst Indian and African  migrant workers in the
kingdom. Earlier, Russian news agency RIA Novosti  reported on the case of a
naked African &quot;witch&quot; who brought traffic to a halt in  Medina. The woman had
been seen walking naked, and was tracked to a brothel. She  tried to flee
through a window, but fell through a roof and walked away  unharmed, showing her
&quot;witchcraft.&quot; She was later captured. The situation of  foreign witchcraft
practitioners led to Al-Ghaith setting up emergency centers  throughout the kingdom
to &quot;register complaints on sorcerers and charlatans,  track them and
terminate them.&quot;

When not seeking out witches, the  Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and
the Prevention of Vice targets people  who are considered to be acting
immorally. They commonly seek out people who are  &quot;in seclusion.&quot; This breach of
morality, called &quot;khalwat&quot;, happens when a man  and woman are found to be in each
other's company when they are neither married  nor blood relatives. How the
muttawa assess &quot;khalwat&quot; is - to Western minds -  bizarre.

In June, 2006 a disabled 70-year old woman entered a shop in Al  Deira market
in Riyadh while unaccompanied by a man. In the shop was the male  shopkeeper.
As a result, the woman (and not the man) was accused of &quot;khalwat&quot;.  Her
relatives were not informed of her arrest. They found her a few days later  in a
jail.

The Saudi-based Arab News reported recently that a Nigerian  man has been in
jail for at least 50 days. Ibrahim Mohammed Lawal, a recent  convert to Islam,
had been studying Islamic Law at Badiya Islamic Center in  Riyadh. When he
heard that his 63-year-old woman neighbor was ill, he offered to  drive her to
the hospital. Several hospitals refused to admit the woman. Some  time after
she was finally admitted to a hospital, Mr. Lawal wondered about the  woman's
well- being. He called to her apartment, where three of the woman's  female
friends were present. As he inquired after the woman's health, the  muttawa
arrived, and arrested Mr. Lawal and the three women.

Mr. Lawal  cannot understand why he is in jail. He said: &quot;I wanted to do a
good thing for a  woman who was sick, and this is what I get in return. I lost
the support of my  family in Nigeria, where my wife and children are upset with
me - and here I am  languishing in prison.&quot;

In May 2006, the Saudi interior minister, Prince  Nayef, announced that the
powers of the muttawa to arrest and detain suspects  for hours were to be
limited. The decree, reprinted in newspapers across the  kingdom, stated: &quot;The role
of the 'authority for the promotion of virtue and  prevention of vice' ends
with apprehending suspected individuals and handing  them to the police, who
then present them to prosecutors with a report of the  incident involved.&quot;
Despite such  rulings, the zeal of the religious police exceeds the bounds
they should abide  by. Sometimes Shi'a Muslims are apprehended by the muttawa,
and only released  when they have signed a document denouncing their faith. The
religious police  frequently take men whose hair is too long off the streets.
The individual's  locks are sheared to an acceptable length before release.
They have a reputation  for violence. This year, two men have died while in
their custody. In June this  year, local news reported that one man who had been
apprehended for &quot;khalwat&quot;  had died of a heart attack in custody. 50-year-old
Ahmed Al Bulawi had been  arrested in the northern province of Tabuk. The
woman he was accused of being  too &quot;close&quot; to was the relative of his employers.

28-year-old Salman Al  Huraisy had died in May this year, after being
arrested by the muttawa in  Riyadh. Mr Huraisy had been accused of dealing alcohol.
His relatives claimed  that he had been beaten to death.

In the same month, Saudi newspaper  Okaz reported that a woman was severely
injured after she fled from muttawa who  had broken into her home. The
religious police suspected her of &quot;indecent  activities.&quot; She panicked and jumped from
the fourth floor of her apartment  block.

The greatest abuse of the religious police's powers happened in  March 11,
2002, and only became public knowledge after a senior member of the  20,000-
strong Al Saud clan allowed the incident to be reported. A fire had  broken out
at a girl's dormitory at a school in Mecca. The girls inside tried to  flee the
burning building. Because they were inappropriately dressed, the  religious
police beat them back into the blazing dormitory. They also prevented  firemen
from reaching the trapped victims. As a result, 15 innocent girls died.  When
the fire was first reported it had been claimed that the girls had died in  a
&quot;stampede&quot; to escape.

In July last year, the muttawa caused 69 women  who worked at a chain of
cosmetics stores to lose their jobs. One woman said:  &quot;The Commission for the
Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice came to  our shop once. We were
wearing Islamic clothes and did not have any makeup on us  despite the fact we
work in a cosmetic shop. We did not look indecent as they  claim and we
definitely did not deserve to lose our jobs.&quot; A senior member of  the company which
owned the shops said that &quot;the commission issued a decision  ordering us to
close down our shops within three days. When we objected they  said either we
close down the shops or they will settle the matter by taking all  the girls by
force to their cars.&quot;

The laws enforced at Saudi's  religious courts indicate a cavalier approach
to human dignity. In March this  year, a young woman who had run away from home
was placed in a foster home for  girls and was additionally sentenced to
sixty lashes.

In November last  year, Deutsche Presse Agentur reported that a young woman,
who had been  subjected to a violent gang rape by at last four assailants, was
herself  convicted of &quot;khalwat.&quot; Before the rape had taken place, she had
been alone in a  car with a man. As a result, she was sentenced to 90 lashes.

The  following month, an Indian man working in Saudi wanted to visit his
wife, who  had just given birth to a son. He lost his way, and found himself in a
Muslim-  only area of Medina. His maroon residency visa (indicating he was a
non-Muslim)  was noticed, and he was reported to the police. A religious court
sentenced him  to be beheaded.

Beheadings take place in public, where a victim is made  to kneel before
having the head severed with a sword. There are numerous cases  of female migrant
workers, who have defended themselves from employers' rape  attacks, who have
been killed this way. The figures for decapitations in Saudi  Arabia have
increased dramatically this year. In 2005, 83 people were beheaded,  but in 2006
this figure dropped to 38. In this year alone there have been 107  public
decapitations.

Saudi Arabia is a country with no democracy, and  no religious freedoms. Yet
we in the West allow the Saudis to fund mosques and  schools, and to promote
their intolerant Wahhabist ideology. Saudi-supported  groups like CAIR complain
about Muslims' rights being abused in the West, while  Muslims and non-
Muslims have no real rights in Saudi Arabia. There is something  unbalanced in this
equation.
