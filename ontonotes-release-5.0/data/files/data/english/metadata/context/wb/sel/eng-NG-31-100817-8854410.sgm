On the outskirts of town, there was a big old pecan tree by the
Cemetery fence. One day two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat

down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts. &quot;One for
you, one for me.One for you, one for me,&quot; said one boy.

Several were dropped and rolled down toward the fence. Another boy
came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed,he thought
he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to
investigate.

Sure enough, he heard, &quot;One for you, one for me. One for you, one for
me.&quot; He just knew what it was.

&quot;Oh my,&quot; he shuddered, &quot; it's and the Lord dividing the souls at the
cemetery&quot;. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the
bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along.

&quot;Come here quick,&quot; said the boy, &quot;you won't believe what I
heard. Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the
souls.&quot;

The man said, &quot;Beat it kid, can't you see it's hard for me to
walk.&quot; When the boy insisted, though, the man hobbled to the cemetery.

Standing by the fence they heard, &quot;One for you, one for me.
One for you, one for me.&quot;

The old man whispered, &quot;Boy, you've been tellin' the truth. Let's
see if we can see the devil himself.&quot;

Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still
unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought
iron
bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of

Satan.

At last they heard, &quot;One for you, one for me. And one last one for
you. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence, and we'll
be done.&quot;

They say the old guy made it back to town five minutes before
the boy.
