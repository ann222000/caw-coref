It is  AlterNet  stories  like this  that end up killing a whole day of writing for me. It's why I generally don't read or watch or listen to anything before I write in the morning. The exception to this rule is when I am working on my comedy act. Basically, the more I know about current events the sharper my writing gets. At least in my opinion.

Since today is a day off from the novel, I decided to catch up a little on the news before I sat down at the keyboard.

I try to keep myself calm and collected most days, but I can get fairly riled up at times. I consider it a personality flaw and work to temper the impact the news of the day affects my mood.

But then I read something like this cocoa ad article and I go to my dark place, where I feel that not only am I not outraged and engaged enough, but nobody else is, either. Which isn't entirely fair to me, and certainly isn't fair to a good number of the 6.4 or 6.5 billion other people stuck on this rock.

But it honestly blows my mind.

I hate the economics that keeps this vein of reporting out of the mainstream. If the FCC needs a decent argument why meta-consolidation in media is a bad idea, they should take a look at the relationships mega-corporations have with each other and their respective media arms. [The series of corporate mergers that continues practically unhindered by anti-trust legislation at home and abroad reminds me of a liquid coalescing into a crystal. As corporations merge and acquire one another, relational dynamics lock into place, creating a stagnant economic system. Then everything dies.] [Talk about your dark moments. I may need to go grab a cup of coffee to perk myself up a bit. Clearly the soy chai hasn't lifted my mood much.]

But even if this story was the most widely reported story in the history of the cosmos, how many people would pooh-pooh it or, worse yet, make some grumbling noises about how they hate those big mega-corporations and then forget all about it in the morning.

At this point I feel I have two choices. The first is to rant on ad infinitum, which doesn't really appeal to me because I'm still a bit groggy this morning from two nights of not-so-great sleep. The second is to march around all day shouting "Power to the people!" at the top of my lungs. Or at least fairly audibly, but not so as to disturb people enough to land me in the psych ward at Harborview by lunchtime.

I choose the latter.

POWER TO THE PEOPLE!!!
