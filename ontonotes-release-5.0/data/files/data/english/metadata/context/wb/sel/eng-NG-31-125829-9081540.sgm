I'm not sure what these things are called. They enable a 3.5&quot; hard
disk drive to be mounted in a 5.25&quot; drive bay.

I need two or three sets.

I also need screws for the rails and for the HDDs.

They're for floppy disks. If you want them for hard drives then you need
something like:

I bought a couple of those when ebuyer were still selling them. (I can't
find them on the ebuyer website any more, but who knows, might still
belurking there somewhere.) I think the floppy drive frames would work for a
HDD, too, although you might need to get the hacksaw out and remove a bit
from the front.

No they aren't. 4 out of 6 are the same but often these bays don't have 2 of
the holes.

Floppy bays can be made to work but the mounting is not usually easy. The
drive tends to sit to far forward as the front of the HD is in line with
cream front. Fitting them backwards with the bezel off is usually the best
way but you tend to only get 2 screws in. For the extra few pennies I'd buy
the proper rails.

I have 2 single rails that allow the fitting of 2 hard drives and a pair of
rails for the same purpose. I've got a couple of pictures of them if you
want to see what they look like before you make a decision.

If you're interested please make me an offer by e.mail to include postage.

Thanks in advance
