*CORNS*

A corn refers to a localized thickening of the skin, especially on the toes,
and extending into subcutaneous tissue. A corn is usually small and painful.

Symptoms of corns Found over the joints of the toesCorns are usually found
over the joints of the toes and on the soles of the feet. They are shaped
like a pyramid with the apex pointing inwards. They are tender when touched.
Sometimes painful and infective warts that occur on the soles of the feet
are mistaken for corns.

Causes of corns Pressure on the toes and skin surfaces of the feet through
incorrect footwear Corns are usually formed as a result of pressure on the
toes and skin surfaces of the feet through incorrect footwear

teaspoon of sesame oil or mustard oil should be rubbed into the hardened
skin at bedtime. The skin gradually softens and the corn decreases in size.
