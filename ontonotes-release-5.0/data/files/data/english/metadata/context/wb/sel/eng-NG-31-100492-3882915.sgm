'94 Caravan with 3.0 liter engine.

Air conditioner stopped working last summer; do not want to go through
another summer without it.

Started to investigate and noticed that turning air conditioner on did not
trigger the solenoid that engages the compressor. Decided to by-pass normal
controls and wired solenoid directly to battery to determine if it was a bad
console switch or solenoid. Solenoid worked just fine. Reconnected to main
wireharness and noticed console switch started working again. (Bad contact
at harness?) However, compressor engages only for a few seconds and then
disengages for a few seconds. This engage - disengage cycle repeats
continuously.

What kind of problem(s) would produce this kind of symptom?

Your low on charge, the low pressure switch is protecting the a/c compressor
from burning up by keeping it off. if you jump the low switch and try to run
it for awhile you will mess up the compressor. without any R-134 in the
system, it will not allow the oil in the system to do its job of
lubricating. And if you keep jumping wires you may really mess something up,
leave it alone and have it looked at by someone whos knows what they are
doing
