So the Pats were stealing signals. I certainly believe it.

And they did it right after the new Commissioner told everyone not to
do it.

If I was the new Commissioner and somebody defied me like that, I'd
land on them so hard that nobody would *ever* again even think of not
taking me seriously, they'd all know there was a new sheriff in town
for sure. The Pats deserve such treatment.

That said, in what sport do teams not try to steal each others'
signals? It's time honored. In baseball stories are legendary.

More to the pount, in what sport do teams assume opponents are not
trying to steal their signals?  In football, why are those play cards
always up in front of the coach's mouth? Why do teams change their
signalling schemes continuously?

As to using signal stealing as an excuse for the Jets' miserable
performance last weekend, that's pretty darn lame.

Think what that means. The CS knows other teams try to steal their
signals in general, and that the Pats have a rep for it in particular,
and very likely has first-hand personal knowledge of the Pats actually
doing it.

With this knowledge this CS leaves its signals so open, undisguised,
and unchanged from prior games that the Pats can read them in real
time? (Obviously without any help from the seized tape.)

That strains credulity. The CS would have to be slovenly incompetents.
They'd deserve to be fired.  In reality, whatever their other faults,
this CS has a well-earned rep for being highly alert to playing every
angle.

I'd believe that this CS, knowing the Pats were going to try to steal
their signals, would send out bogus signals designed to confuse the
Pats long before I'd believe they'd be so apathetic about protecting
their signals that they'd just let the Pats do it to turn the game.

So stolen signals as an excuse for last Sunday... fuhgettaboutit.

And signal stealing generally in the NFL -- every bit as shocking as
gambling in a casino.

But if the Commish wants to ream the Pats a new one ... fine by me!

Grinch, good post. But like most folks you are ignoring what may be the
real issue. What is going on with the listening to other frequencies?
Were the Pats being overly secretive or were they listening to
communications between Mangini and the coaches upstairs and our QB? To
me that is the real concern. That would be real cheating.

The fact that media morons are not talking about it concerns me. Their
silence likely creates the opening for it to be brushed under the table.

Figure skaters aren't so subtle, they break each others' knees.
Girl figure skaters at least.

If the Pats were intercepting radio signals to the QB and feeding them
to radio receivers in the defenders' helmets then we'd be talking
about a whole 'nother universe -- I'd support confiscating the
franchise.

(Maybe ... OTOH, one can go to any electronics store and get a signal
encryption system cheap, so there's a simple remedy for that too, if
it's suspected).

But sticking to the reality of published reports, the Jets/League
security people apparently caught a guy who'd taken video recordings
of visual hand signals and such.  If that's all there was, a video
recording, then it couldn't have been used yet, or at all as things
turned out (after being seized).

And what could it really have been used for anyhow? The signals are
disguised (if the CS is competent) so how could they be decrypted and
taught to the D by the second half? Could the info on it be used for a
late-season second game, after the team's signals presumably would be
changed?  Are they sold or traded on a league black market for signal
stealing tapes? To the Ravens for next week?  (Is Mangini buying tapes
peddled from the Bengals?)

I don't doubt that such a tape would have some value to the Pats, or
they wouldn't go to the effort and risk of getting it. But it's hard
for me to see how a video tape of a half's signals would have any kind
of *dramatic* value. It kinda reminds me of baseball teams that put a
telescope up in center field to read the fingers between the catcher's
legs -- baseball teams do it and get caught, but does anybody really
pick up 10 games in a pennant race that way?

The NYC tabloids have &quot;Cheater!&quot; on the front cover, and the story at
the front of the news pages, not just in the sports pages. I don't
think they're being silent about anything, it's against their
character and $$$$ self-interest to be silent.  I think they're not
mentioning &quot;radio cheating&quot; just because they have nothing at all to
support any mention, and that if they get anything on that subject
it'll be over page one too, as soon as they do.

Remember all  the news  stories they ran in the offseason about
Belichick's girlfriend, all the money he gave her, her divorce, the
house he bought for her through an anonymous trust in Brooklyn, etc.?
They're not looking to do Bill any *favors* that will cost them a
paper-selling story.  And I suspect they've got their guys out now
tracking down any rumor they can. So, we'll see...

In the meantime, maybe Mangini should send the equipment man down to
Radio Shack to get one of those encryption circuits.

Answer from an article on ESPN today...
http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?id=3016267
But the practice of stealing signals in football does not fall under the
rubric of gamesmanship, as it does in baseball. Baseball teams don't have
700-page playbooks, as does Washington associate head coach Al Saunders. Nor
do baseball players use parts of their offseason to devise game plans for
opponents, and their teams aren't threatened with the loss of draft picks
for relaying back to the hitter the next pitch will be a curveball.
Technological espionage, however, is unacceptable in both sports. During
parts of the 2003-04 and 2004-05 seasons, opposing scouts were convinced the
Boston Red Sox were stealing signs using a centerfield camera.

No, not to me.   We would have lost anyway.   That is what makes it more
insane.   The first game of the year.   The first game after a legue wide
memo on the subject.  Against an ex-coach who knows you do it.  Against a
team would beat anyway.   But you do it anyway.   Has it become just
business as usual for the Patriots?  a

It's not yet clear whether or not the RECORDING was being used for that
game.  Others have suggested that it was for their next meeting, or even to
be passed on to other teams (perhaps in a trade).  Why else RECORD the
information?  If they had some sort of rig to be able to feed the video to a
booth or something, then they wouldn't need to record;  just transmit.  The
recording aspect indicates either that they were going to use that
information at a later date (halftime, post-game, etc), or they were dumb as
a box of rocks and kept the evidence of their wrongdoing.  My guess is the
former.  This isn't Herm.
