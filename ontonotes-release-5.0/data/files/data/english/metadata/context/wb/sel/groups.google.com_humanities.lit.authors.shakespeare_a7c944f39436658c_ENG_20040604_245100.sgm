Those howers that with gentle worke did frame,
The louely gaze where euery eye doth dwell
Will play the tirants to the very same,
And that vnfaire which fairely doth excell:
For neuer resting time leads Summer on,
To hidious winter and confounds him there,
Sap checkt with frost and lustie leau's quite gon.
Beauty ore-snow'd and barenes euery where,
Then were not summers distillation left
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glasse,
Beauties effect with beauty were bereft,
Nor it nor noe remembrance what it was.
But flowers distil'd though they with winter meete,
Leese but their show,their substance still liues sweet.

Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
Will play the tyrants to the very same
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
For never-resting time leads Summer on
To hideous winter, and confounds him there; sap checked with frost,
and lusty leaves quite gone,
Beauty o'er-snowed, and bareness everywhere.
Then, were not Summer's distillation left,
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft;
Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was.
But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,
Lose but their show: their substance still lives sweet.

(With apologies to LynnE, if she wanted this held up:

Time's winged chariot hurrying near&quot;

Is it okay if I post this even though you haven't posted your
explanation yet? I'm going to try to look at this quatrain by
quatrain, something like I did with sonnet #4. I was taught (in high
school, which was kind of a long time ago, so this is probably
inexact) that a Shakespearean sonnet starts with the introduction of
the idea, then explains it further, then expands on the explanation in
one way or another, before stating the idea in brief as a couplet.
This sonnet seems to fit the pattern very well.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; And that unfair which fairly doth excel;

The theme seems to be that the physical loveliness of a person is
temporary. Time gives but time also takes away. Time seems like a
&quot;tyrant&quot; because it ruins things (but it was time that also created
the thing now being ruined). It's interesting that the
becoming-beautiful of a human face (&quot;the lovely gaze&quot;) is described as
caused by a personified entity, as if some sentient being were
personally creating beauty and then (&quot;unfair[ly]&quot;) taking it away.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; For never-resting time leads Summer on
&gt; To hideous winter, and confounds him there; sap checked with frost,
&gt; and lusty leaves quite gone,
&gt; Beauty o'er-snowed, and bareness everywhere.

"/>

The fact introduced is explained, as we can see easily because the
first word of this group of lines is &quot;for.&quot; The idea of time
continues, but it's now described in terms of the seasons of the year,
and the idea of beauty is now transferred from a human face to a
landscape. Though &quot;beauty o'er-snowed, and bareness everywhere,&quot; is
easily applied to human old age. In the previous quatrain, it seemed
more that the &quot;addressee&quot; stood still, while time -- the hours --
moved around him or her; here, the motion described is more of being
led along a (quite long and tiring) path.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then, were not Summer's distillation left,
&gt; A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
&gt; Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft;
&gt; Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was.

"/>

Now, we have an image that's more complex. The valuable thing,
beauty, which the poem has been discussing, can be preserved in some
way (it is suggested), by a process like distillation (in which some
organic matter is heated to a high temperature, so that it expresses
some (usually liquid, sometimes gaseous) &quot;essence,&quot; the method by
which perfumes and liquors are made).

It is assumed that this &quot;distillation&quot; process will have already
occurred, at the time when winter has overtaken summer, as it were --
so that something will _not_ be the case. What will not be the case
is that one will be &quot;bereft&quot; of &quot;beauty,&quot; and without any
&quot;remembrance&quot; of &quot;beauty.&quot; There are distinctions made between
&quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;beauty's effect,&quot; and between &quot;beauty&quot; and the
&quot;remembrance [of] what [beauty] was.&quot; For each pair, the former item
(in each case, &quot;beauty&quot;) will be gone, but the latter item (&quot;effect&quot;
and &quot;remembrance&quot;) will remain.

&quot;Effect&quot; seems simply to mean what comes after, or else the word is
being used in a way that seems a bit unusual. It seems more normal to
use &quot;effect&quot; to mean something caused by (in this case) beauty. In an
Aristotelian sense, beauty might be a &quot;cause&quot; of what's distilled from
beauty, but the phrasing still seems odd. I wonder whether what's
intended is the thought that the &quot;effects&quot; of a dead person are what
remain after he is gone, and thus that anything's &quot;effect&quot; is what
remains, of what was possessed by that thing, after it's gone. And in
that case, I wonder whether this was a common usage at the time, or
just a (perhaps inspired) mistake, on Shakespeare's part, or on the
part of someone he might have heard the expression from.

So, the idea is that there is some process that starts with the beauty
present during &quot;summertime,&quot; and that ends up with something -- not
quite beauty, but related to it -- that persists throughout &quot;winter.&quot;
As the topic of the poem was introduced as a human being, we have the
idea that a person's youth or prime will not last forever, but that
something good about that person _will_ last, even when the pleasing
aspects of youth are no longer available.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,
&gt; Lose but their show: their substance still lives sweet.

"/>

From a scientific point of view, this last line is wrong: it's the
essence of the flowers that's distilled into perfume, not their
substance (which, if anything, is lying rotting in the ground, or in
the ashcan).

Nevertheless, the point is clear. What is really important remains,
in spite of time. Although flowers seem to be inseparable from
beauty, there is still something that remains when the mere &quot;show&quot; of
beauty is removed -- and this something remaining is their _true_
being. Similarly, the important part of (or aspects of) the
&quot;addressee&quot; will not have gone away even after his or her youthful
beauty is gone. In my opinion, this idea works best if &quot;beauty&quot; is
understood to have been a stand-in for all youthful attributes.
Otherwise, I don't know how to understand the idea that something _of_
the beauty still remains. (Not to mention that it seems a more
appropriate topic for a poem.)

Considering another use of distillation, I wonder whether the poem
also suggests the idea of drinking -- mead, possibly? -- in the depths
of winter, for warmth, comfort, or as an &quot;aid&quot; to reminiscence. Mead
is made from honey, which is made (by bees) from flowers.

I would say (given no further information) that probably the main idea
of the poem is a fairly conventional one: Don't fear old age, because
old age has its own rewards, even if those rewards are different from
those of youth. And expressed in fairly conventional imagery, except
for lines 9-12. Lots more could be said, but I think this is the
basic idea.

This reading does not rule out the idea that the &quot;distillation&quot;
process is intended to be a process of procreation, as seems to be the
interpretation preferred by most participants on this newsgroup.

The poet again stresses the importance of leaving
some reminder of the addressee's beauty behind.

Some other things:

There is no suggestion in this poem that the
addressee is narcissistic, for a change.

This is one of those poems that is best understood
in connection with the four poems previous to it. If we
were to read this poem by itself, would we know that the
poet is suggesting that the addressee have children to
preserve his beauty? I'm not sure. He could just as easily
be suggesting that the addressee have his portrait painted.

Again, the sex of the addressee is not explicitly
mentioned, but, taken by itself, I suspect most people would
guess that it is a woman being addressed.

I thought you were proceeding quite nicely until I
came to this paragraph. I'm not sure how it follows from
what you've written above.

I would say that the poet is saying: DO fear old
age, because of its effects on beauty. Nor do I think he is
giving any comforting thoughts about the rewards of old age
in and of itself. Rather, he seems to be saying that
despite Time's ravages, there is something that can be done
to avoid being totally demolished.

Interesting. Something we don't see too much of - a

indifferent. Usually, we're so busy analyzing that no value
judgements are made.

Memory is a fluid, unstable thing, a 'liquid pent in walls of glass'. Glass
is something we see through, as we do with our eyes. The perfume (or nectar)
image is there as well, Gary; perhaps we are both right?

&gt; Interesting. Something we don't see too much of - a
&gt; judgement on whether a particular sonnet is good, bad or
&gt; indifferent. Usually, we're so busy analyzing that no value
&gt; judgements are made.

I've never been into Bardolatry. Shakespeare can nod as well as Homer, but
many people have been trained to never admit it. Or perhaps I've become
jaded by 400 years of poetry using the change of seasons as a metaphor.

Of course Paul is going to tell me I'm wrong and proclaim this is a great
poem about royal shit and piss.

No, I think he's referring here to the preservation of beauty through the
preservation of genes. Compare those lines with these from A Midsummer
Night's Dream:-

But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

It seems he associates distillation with procreation.

Stripped of their language, most poems are conventional. When the poet says,

but you'd better be good&quot;.

D'OH! You're right - if we read this poem by

abstract this poem is, taken by itself. I unconsciously
read the first four lines as an direct address to the

The only thing, though, is line 12. If what you're

I thin that's because he's shifting the theme of the sonnet series. From the
personal theme of, &quot;You should have a child to preserve the beauty and worth
of your line,&quot; he's moving to a much more universal and profound
observation: the effects of time passing and our efforts to defeat it.

(Obviously I don't agree with Neil's pronouncement of the banality of the
theme.)

Thank you. I was trying to show I contribute more than just occasional

One other point. Human memory is never total recall; our mind refines the
images and impressions we have of a person - distilling it until we have an
essence of that person.

I find this reaction puzzling. Not that
you say it -- but because you say
nothing else at all on it -- not a whit more.

When I declare someone's statements to
be nonsense (as I often do in respect of
Strats and quasi-Strats) I feel obliged to
explain in detail why and how they are
nonsense. When they are at all challenging,
I am usually pleased to be able to do so.

How come I get nothing along these lines
in response to my detailed exegeses on
the sonnets?

How come that I don't get masses of
comments pointing out how the traditional
interpretations are superior -- in the ways
in which they accord more closely to the

the poet's grammar and expression?

They lose only their appearance; their essence continues to smell
sweet.

But for the 'gaze' in line 2, this could be a hymn to the perfumer's
art, and a very fine one too, to satisfy the most demanding perfumer.
Helen Vendler gives it five pages, including &quot;Shakespeare is attracted
to all levels of the metaphorical, from the fanciful through the
sublime, not excepting the fossilized, the mythical, and the figure
referred to as the pathetic fallacy.&quot;

After sonnets 1-4, we know what to make of talk about time. I wonder
if there is going to be a follow-on to drive it home? Here is a sonnet
that really is an allegory, and this is how Shakespeare gives us
pointers to spotting it. We should be warned against dragging in
allegories where there are no such pointers.

Line 1, 'hours'. The meaning 'seasons' seems too late for this sonnet
(Shorter Oxford, 1634) and in any case unnecessary. A lifetime
consists of a great many hours, so that the processes are very gradual
and 'gentle' in the modern sense (S.O.D. '6. Not violent or severe
1563'.

Line 2, 'gaze'. Normally we think of a gaze looking out at the world.
Shakespeare has a trap for us: he means the addressee's fine eyes that
everyone wants to see; refer to 1.5, 2.7 for mentions of these.

Line 4, 'fairly'. If we take the S.O.D. meaning '6. Completely,
'clean'; actually, really 1596' then we have Shakespeare using the
word 'fair' twice, playing with different senses as he so often does.

Lines 5-6. 'Time' is personified, so also 'Summer', but not winter -
winter is just a place or time ('there').

Lines 9-10. Line 9 on its own is not intelligible, but a little work
on line 10 gives us the splendid poetic image (a favourite of Julia of
Mistylaw, founder of the sonnet series on HLAS). 'Distillation' -
Shakespeare knows more than I do about scent manufacture.

Kerrigan's Penguin has the fullest quotation from Sidney's Arcadia:
&quot;Have you ever seen a pure rose-water kept in a crystal glass, how
fine it looks, how sweet it smells while that beautiful glass
imprisons it? Break the prison, and let the water take its own course;
doth it not embrace dust and lose all his former sweetness and
fairness? Truly so are we, if we have not the stay, rather than the
restraint, of crystalline marriage.&quot;

My scepticism does not extend to denying that this is a deliberate
reminiscence. The audience were expected to recognise it: the poet is
saying, in effect, &quot;Look, I can do this too! I can take one of
Sidney's best-known images and use it for my own purposes, and make it
just as good as new.&quot;

Line 11, 'bereft'. 'Bereave' can have the meaning '4. To remove by
violence -1718'. So 'bereft' can mean 'taken away (from someone)'.
('-1718' in the Shorter Oxford means 'last found in print in 1718'.)

Line 14: a contrast between appearance and substance, it seems. But
really 'substance' does duty for 'essence', the essential oil that is
extracted for scent. The two words, 'substance' and 'essence', were
invented to translate into Latin the same Greek philosophical term (or
roughly so) and in philosophy were treated as (roughly) synonymous,
but these days it is only 'essence' that is used for essential oils.
So the real contrast is between sight and scent.

Absolutely. That's why I do it this way - to give the rest of the
world a chance, reduce the 'Mr Toad' factor.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I'm going to try to look at this quatrain by
&gt;quatrain, something like I did with sonnet #4. I was taught (in high
&gt;school, which was kind of a long time ago, so this is probably
&gt;inexact) that a Shakespearean sonnet starts with the introduction of
&gt;the idea, then explains it further, then expands on the explanation in
&gt;one way or another, before stating the idea in brief as a couplet.
&gt;This sonnet seems to fit the pattern very well.

&gt;&gt; Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
&gt;&gt; The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
&gt;&gt; Will play the tyrants to the very same
&gt;&gt; And that unfair which fairly doth excel;

&gt;The theme seems to be that the physical loveliness of a person is
&gt;temporary. Time gives but time also takes away. Time seems like a
&gt;&quot;tyrant&quot; because it ruins things (but it was time that also created
&gt;the thing now being ruined). It's interesting that the
&gt;becoming-beautiful of a human face (&quot;the lovely gaze&quot;) is described as
&gt;caused by a personified entity, as if some sentient being were
&gt;personally creating beauty and then (&quot;unfair[ly]&quot;) taking it away.

&gt;&gt; For never-resting time leads Summer on
&gt;&gt; To hideous winter, and confounds him there; sap checked with frost,

"/>

My mistake - line ending in the wrong place. Sorry!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; and lusty leaves quite gone,
&gt;&gt; Beauty o'er-snowed, and bareness everywhere.

&gt;The fact introduced is explained, as we can see easily because the
&gt;first word of this group of lines is &quot;for.&quot; The idea of time
&gt;continues, but it's now described in terms of the seasons of the year,
&gt;and the idea of beauty is now transferred from a human face to a
&gt;landscape. Though &quot;beauty o'er-snowed, and bareness everywhere,&quot; is
&gt;easily applied to human old age. In the previous quatrain, it seemed
&gt;more that the &quot;addressee&quot; stood still, while time -- the hours --
&gt;moved around him or her; here, the motion described is more of being
&gt;led along a (quite long and tiring) path.

&gt;&gt; Then, were not Summer's distillation left,
&gt;&gt; A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
&gt;&gt; Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft;
&gt;&gt; Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was.

&gt;Now, we have an image that's more complex. The valuable thing,
&gt;beauty, which the poem has been discussing, can be preserved in some
&gt;way (it is suggested), by a process like distillation (in which some
&gt;organic matter is heated to a high temperature, so that it expresses
&gt;some (usually liquid, sometimes gaseous) &quot;essence,&quot; the method by
&gt;which perfumes and liquors are made).

&gt;It is assumed that this &quot;distillation&quot; process will have already
&gt;occurred, at the time when winter has overtaken summer, as it were --
&gt;so that something will _not_ be the case. What will not be the case
&gt;is that one will be &quot;bereft&quot; of &quot;beauty,&quot; and without any
&gt;&quot;remembrance&quot; of &quot;beauty.&quot; There are distinctions made between
&gt;&quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;beauty's effect,&quot; and between &quot;beauty&quot; and the
&gt;&quot;remembrance [of] what [beauty] was.&quot; For each pair, the former item
&gt;(in each case, &quot;beauty&quot;) will be gone, but the latter item (&quot;effect&quot;
&gt;and &quot;remembrance&quot;) will remain.

&gt;&quot;Effect&quot; seems simply to mean what comes after, or else the word is
&gt;being used in a way that seems a bit unusual. It seems more normal to
&gt;use &quot;effect&quot; to mean something caused by (in this case) beauty. In an
&gt;Aristotelian sense, beauty might be a &quot;cause&quot; of what's distilled from
&gt;beauty, but the phrasing still seems odd. I wonder whether what's
&gt;intended is the thought that the &quot;effects&quot; of a dead person are what
&gt;remain after he is gone, and thus that anything's &quot;effect&quot; is what
&gt;remains, of what was possessed by that thing, after it's gone. And in
&gt;that case, I wonder whether this was a common usage at the time, or
&gt;just a (perhaps inspired) mistake, on Shakespeare's part, or on the
&gt;part of someone he might have heard the expression from.

"/>

'Beauty' here means the flowers, surely? So it's not unnatural to say
that scent (in the air or in a bottle) is an effect of the flowers. We
are not actually told this until line 13 - another Shakespearian trap.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;So, the idea is that there is some process that starts with the beauty
&gt;present during &quot;summertime,&quot; and that ends up with something -- not
&gt;quite beauty, but related to it -- that persists throughout &quot;winter.&quot;
&gt;As the topic of the poem was introduced as a human being, we have the
&gt;idea that a person's youth or prime will not last forever, but that
&gt;something good about that person _will_ last, even when the pleasing
&gt;aspects of youth are no longer available.

&gt;&gt; But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,
&gt;&gt; Lose but their show: their substance still lives sweet.

&gt;From a scientific point of view, this last line is wrong: it's the
&gt;essence of the flowers that's distilled into perfume, not their
&gt;substance (which, if anything, is lying rotting in the ground, or in
&gt;the ashcan).

&gt;Nevertheless, the point is clear. What is really important remains,
&gt;in spite of time. Although flowers seem to be inseparable from
&gt;beauty, there is still something that remains when the mere &quot;show&quot; of
&gt;beauty is removed -- and this something remaining is their _true_
&gt;being. Similarly, the important part of (or aspects of) the
&gt;&quot;addressee&quot; will not have gone away even after his or her youthful
&gt;beauty is gone. In my opinion, this idea works best if &quot;beauty&quot; is
&gt;understood to have been a stand-in for all youthful attributes.
&gt;Otherwise, I don't know how to understand the idea that something _of_
&gt;the beauty still remains. (Not to mention that it seems a more
&gt;appropriate topic for a poem.)

&gt;Considering another use of distillation, I wonder whether the poem
&gt;also suggests the idea of drinking -- mead, possibly? -- in the depths
&gt;of winter, for warmth, comfort, or as an &quot;aid&quot; to reminiscence. Mead
&gt;is made from honey, which is made (by bees) from flowers.

&gt;I would say (given no further information) that probably the main idea
&gt;of the poem is a fairly conventional one: Don't fear old age, because
&gt;old age has its own rewards, even if those rewards are different from
&gt;those of youth. And expressed in fairly conventional imagery, except
&gt;for lines 9-12. Lots more could be said, but I think this is the
&gt;basic idea.

&gt;This reading does not rule out the idea that the &quot;distillation&quot;
&gt;process is intended to be a process of procreation, as seems to be the
&gt;interpretation preferred by most participants on this newsgroup.

&gt; I thought you were proceeding quite nicely until I
(Thank you.)
&gt; came to this paragraph. I'm not sure how it follows from
&gt; what you've written above.

"/>

I was assuming that the &quot;effect&quot; and &quot;remembrance&quot; of beauty are also,
in effect, beautiful: that is, that they are pleasing in something of
the same way the original beauty is. I feel that the basic &quot;shape&quot; or
&quot;movement&quot; of the poem is from good going bad and then getting better
again, rather than from bad to worse to worst. There's nothing
explicit in the poem that says this, though; so I suppose it's
_possible_ that the &quot;effect&quot; of &quot;beauty&quot; is a _bad_ side-effect of
beauty's having once existed. Or, maybe, that it's worse to remember
good things that are gone beyond hope of recovery, than simply not to
have that &quot;remembrance&quot; of them.

If this were the case, what would the overall main idea then be?
Perhaps that time drags us through the muck, so we ought to appreciate
the &quot;distillation process&quot; that provides us the little we do end up
being able to make use of, in the end? That we ought to &quot;let go&quot; of
whatever can't be kept intact throughout that process?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I would say that the poet is saying: DO fear old
&gt; age, because of its effects on beauty. Nor do I think he is
&gt; giving any comforting thoughts about the rewards of old age
&gt; in and of itself. Rather, he seems to be saying that
&gt; despite Time's ravages, there is something that can be done
&gt; to avoid being totally demolished.

"/>

Is what I just said, basically, what you were saying here, or do I
still not understand what you're saying?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I hesitate to call anyone's interpretation &quot;wrong&quot;.

&gt;&gt; I would as well, to a point. Crowley's sonnet interpretations remain
&gt;&gt; nonsense.

&gt; I find this reaction puzzling. Not that
&gt; you say it -- but because you say
&gt; nothing else at all on it -- not a whit more.

&gt; When I declare someone's statements to
&gt; be nonsense (as I often do in respect of
&gt; Strats and quasi-Strats) I feel obliged to
&gt; explain in detail why and how they are
&gt; nonsense. When they are at all challenging,
&gt; I am usually pleased to be able to do so.

&gt; How come I get nothing along these lines

&gt; the sonnets?

&gt; How come that I don't get masses of
&gt; comments pointing out how the traditional
&gt; interpretations are superior -- in the ways
&gt; in which they accord more closely to the
&gt; historical facts, and are more faithful to
&gt; the poet's grammar and expression?

"/>

Because, as I told you several days ago, it's impossible to take your
leg-arsy offerings seriously. That is for several reasons. Leaving out your
fascination with bodily functions, one of them is your inability to connect
with poetry as poetry. You always think it's something else. It's a pamphlet
warning the Queen about the martial Winter brothers, or urging her to beget
an heir to the throne, or delivering coded messages about Mary Queen of
Scots, or Catholics...or something.

Shakespeare wasn't a diplomat or a politician or the Queen's adviser. He was
a poet, and the sonnets are concerned with the life of the mind. If you look
through the contributions to the sonnet threads posted here, you will see
how few contributors have alluded in any way to the authorship question.
It's a peripheral issue. They deal with these poems as if they were by an
anonymous poet. How do they work as poetry? That's all we are concerned
with. But you seem to be unable to connect with that idea. About poetry as
poetry you have nothing to say, and people therefore ignore your &quot;exegeses&quot;,
as you grandly call them, just as they would ignore any from, e.g. Peter
Zenner, who has no interest in either poetry or in Shakespeare. He likes
historical puzzles, and thinks he has solved one. You belong in the same
category. Baconian crossword-puzzles with lots of naughty words in them -
those define your horizon. You're on the wrong news-group, that's all.

&gt; preservation of genes. Compare those lines with these from A Midsummer
&gt; Night's Dream:-

&gt; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
&gt; Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
&gt; Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

&gt; It seems he associates distillation with procreation.

"/>

I should have given a bit more context with that quote - and a bit more
quote. Hermia's is trying to force his daughter to marry Demetrius, and
Theseus urges compliance upon her:-

Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
You can endure the livery of a nun,
For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
To live a barren sister all your life,
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

This seems to confirm that the poet is using the idea of distilled flowers
as a metaphor for procreation, at least in that example. So it might be
reasonable to project it onto Sonnet 5 too.

On the other hand Neil's idea of memory as a kind of distillation is also an
attractive one. Beauty has an extended life when it exists in the memory.

There is also a third possibility. Several times in the sonnets,
Shakespeare refers to his own verse as a preserver - &quot;So long lives this,&quot;
etc. That meaning - beauty distilled in the poet's verse - could be inferred
here too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;...but it decays/destroys its creation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For never-resting time leads Summer on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To hideous winter, and confounds him there; sap checked with frost,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and lusty leaves quite gone,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Beauty o'er-snowed, and bareness everywhere.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Life is compared to the seasons, and time leads us to winter/death.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then, were not Summer's distillation left,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But if it weren't for the preserved image of beauty from earlier
&gt;days....

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;...we would have no idea what we had lost.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lose but their show: their substance still lives sweet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Our image of beauty lives on in our mind's eye, despite the passing of
&gt;&gt;&gt;time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Mind's eye&quot;......hmmmmmmmm. When he's talking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about flowers, isn't he suggesting that there is something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; real by which we remember them ie: their perfume in bottles?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Where does the &quot;mind's eye&quot; come into it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Memory is a fluid, unstable thing, a 'liquid pent in walls of glass'.
&gt;Glass
&gt;&gt;&gt;is something we see through, as we do with our eyes.

&gt;&gt; Whoaaaa......not bad!

&gt;Thank you. I was trying to show I contribute more than just occasional
&gt;bashings of antiStrats.

&gt;One other point. Human memory is never total recall; our mind refines the
&gt;images and impressions we have of a person - distilling it until we have an
&gt;essence of that person.

&gt;&gt; The only thing, though, is line 12. If what you're
&gt;&gt; saying is right, wouldn't the poet then be saying: if we
&gt;&gt; don't have any remembrance in our mind's eye of the
&gt;&gt; beautiful thing, then we won't have any remembrance of that
&gt;&gt; beautiful thing, which seems a tautology?

&gt;Doesn't line 12 refer to having neither the beautiful thing nor the
&gt;&quot;rememberance&quot; of the beautiful thing?

"/>

Yes, but I'm not sure if that makes any difference.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I don't see the tautology.

The gist of your paraphrase seems to be:

Our image of beauty lives on in our mind's eye, and
if it doesn't, then we will have neither the beautiful
object or the image of it in our mind's eye.

To me, that sounds tautological. But perhaps I'm
misunderstanding you.

&gt;I was assuming that the &quot;effect&quot; and &quot;remembrance&quot; of beauty are also,

I agree.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I get the sense that the movement is from good to
bad, but at least we may have a remembrance of the good.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There's nothing
&gt;explicit in the poem that says this, though; so I suppose it's
&gt;_possible_ that the &quot;effect&quot; of &quot;beauty&quot; is a _bad_ side-effect of
&gt;beauty's having once existed. Or, maybe, that it's worse to remember
&gt;good things that are gone beyond hope of recovery, than simply not to
&gt;have that &quot;remembrance&quot; of them.
&gt;If this were the case, what would the overall main idea then be?
&gt;Perhaps that time drags us through the muck, so we ought to appreciate
&gt;the &quot;distillation process&quot; that provides us the little we do end up
&gt;being able to make use of, in the end? That we ought to &quot;let go&quot; of
&gt;whatever can't be kept intact throughout that process?

No, no, no. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Don't let me confuse you.
Clearly the poet wants a remembrance of the beautiful thing,
and thinks it a good thing to have.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I would say that the poet is saying: DO fear old
&gt;&gt; age, because of its effects on beauty. Nor do I think he is
&gt;&gt; giving any comforting thoughts about the rewards of old age

&gt;&gt; despite Time's ravages, there is something that can be done
&gt;&gt; to avoid being totally demolished.

&gt;Is what I just said, basically, what you were saying here, or do I
&gt;still not understand what you're saying?

"/>

The part of your interpretation that I was
questioning, Bianca, was where you wrote:

&quot;Don't fear old age, because old age has its own rewards,
even if those rewards are different from those of youth.&quot;

In this poem, I don't think the poet has anything
positive to say about any &quot;rewards&quot; of old age. He looks
upon old age as &quot;hideous winter&quot;, and his poem is a plea to
somehow preserve some aspect of the beauty of &quot;summer&quot; or
youth from the ravages of winter or old age.

I don't know if this makes my point any clearer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I suppose I will be flamed for saying it, but I find Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;imaginative language is clothing a rather conventional poem.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Interesting. Something we don't see too much of - a
&gt;&gt;&gt; judgement on whether a particular sonnet is good, bad or
&gt;&gt;&gt; indifferent. Usually, we're so busy analyzing that no value
&gt;&gt;&gt; judgements are made.

&gt;&gt; I've never been into Bardolatry. Shakespeare can nod as well as Homer,
but
&gt;&gt; many people have been trained to never admit it. Or perhaps I've become
&gt;&gt; jaded by 400 years of poetry using the change of seasons as a metaphor.

&gt; I wouldn't call myself a bardolator but there are very few things in
&gt; Shakespeare that are not at a high level.

I'd say at varying heights.

&gt; that they are exquisitely done, the technique is flawless, or nearly so.
&gt; Of the first 17, sonnet 5 is my favorite because of the imagery and
&gt; the lines involving distillation. What exactly is conventional about
&gt; this poem? The general theme of procreating and passing on one's beauty
&gt; had been considered in some ways by other poets but Shakespeare was
&gt; the first to emphasize that theme so much, and it's not taken up

1 List and learn, ye dainty roses,
2 Roses white and roses red,

Obviously a reference to the warring houses of York
and Lancaster. Only the silliest Strat would think
otherwise.

3 Why we bind you into posies

The torture captives underwent in Tudor days included
various forms of binding. Note that the roses have been
picked, or in other words captured, for this to happen.

4 Ere your morning bloom has fled.

Another clear political reference to Essex.

5 By a law of maiden's making,

A clear reference to Elizabeth, the &quot;maiden&quot; Queen,
and the only lawmaker in all of England. Notice no
Strat has seen to fit to bring this up.

6 Accents of a heart that's aching,

A reference to the French language. The poet, fond
of a Latin word and a Greek remark, now makes
one that's French.

7 Even though that heart be breaking,
8 Should by maiden be unsaid:

The strong feelings of Elizabeth, which for political
reasons, have to be kept to herself.

9 Though they love with love exceeding,

The poet clearly accepts that both Lancaster and York
have &quot;exceeding&quot; loyalty to the Crown.

10 They must seem to be unheeding--

However, the two Tudor factions must keep their
loyalty hidden under a thin mask of civil war.

11 Go ye then and do their pleading,
12 Roses white and roses red!

Obviously a clue that the poet was waiting for me
to come along and explain the political and
authorship implications of this verse. Otherwise
some unenlightened souls might mistake this
for a verse about maidens longing for suitors.
Of course, only an idiot like Buffalo would think
that.

&gt;&gt; Now, we have an image that's more complex. The valuable thing,
&gt;&gt; beauty, which the poem has been discussing, can be preserved in
some
&gt;&gt; way (it is suggested), by a process like distillation (in which
some
&gt;&gt; organic matter is heated to a high temperature, so that it
expresses
&gt;&gt; some (usually liquid, sometimes gaseous) &quot;essence,&quot; the method by
&gt;&gt; which perfumes and liquors are made).

&gt;&gt; It is assumed that this &quot;distillation&quot; process will have already
&gt;&gt; occurred, at the time when winter has overtaken summer, as it were
--
&gt;&gt; so that something will _not_ be the case. What will not be the
case
&gt;&gt; is that one will be &quot;bereft&quot; of &quot;beauty,&quot; and without any
&gt;&gt;&quot;remembrance&quot; of &quot;beauty.&quot; There are distinctions made between
&gt;&gt;&quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;beauty's effect,&quot; and between &quot;beauty&quot; and the
&gt;&gt;&quot;remembrance [of] what [beauty] was.&quot; For each pair, the former
item
&gt;&gt; (in each case, &quot;beauty&quot;) will be gone, but the latter item
(&quot;effect&quot;
&gt;&gt; and &quot;remembrance&quot;) will remain.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Effect&quot; seems simply to mean what comes after, or else the word is
&gt;&gt; being used in a way that seems a bit unusual. It seems more normal
to
&gt;&gt; use &quot;effect&quot; to mean something caused by (in this case) beauty. In
an
&gt;&gt; Aristotelian sense, beauty might be a &quot;cause&quot; of what's distilled
from
&gt;&gt; beauty, but the phrasing still seems odd. I wonder whether what's
&gt;&gt; intended is the thought that the &quot;effects&quot; of a dead person are
what
&gt;&gt; remain after he is gone, and thus that anything's &quot;effect&quot; is what
&gt;&gt; remains, of what was possessed by that thing, after it's gone. And
in
&gt;&gt; that case, I wonder whether this was a common usage at the time, or
&gt;&gt; just a (perhaps inspired) mistake, on Shakespeare's part, or on the
&gt;&gt; part of someone he might have heard the expression from.

&gt; 'Beauty' here means the flowers, surely? So it's not unnatural to say
&gt; that scent (in the air or in a bottle) is an effect of the flowers. We
&gt; are not actually told this until line 13 - another Shakespearian trap.

"/>

It seems unnatural to me.

It would be, to my ear, like saying that a custard is an &quot;effect&quot; of
the eggs, or an ice cube an effect of the water.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would say (given no further information) that probably the main
&gt;&gt; idea
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the poem is a fairly conventional one: Don't fear old age,
&gt;&gt; because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; old age has its own rewards, even if those rewards are different
&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those of youth. And expressed in fairly conventional imagery,
&gt;&gt; except
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for lines 9-12. Lots more could be said, but I think this is the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; basic idea.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I thought you were proceeding quite nicely until I
&gt;&gt; (Thank you.)
&gt;&gt;&gt; came to this paragraph. I'm not sure how it follows from
&gt;&gt;&gt; what you've written above.

&gt;&gt; I was assuming that the &quot;effect&quot; and &quot;remembrance&quot; of beauty are
also,
&gt;&gt; in effect, beautiful: that is, that they are pleasing in something
of
&gt;&gt; the same way the original beauty is.

&gt; I agree.

&gt;&gt; I feel that the basic &quot;shape&quot; or
&gt;&gt;&quot;movement&quot; of the poem is from good going bad and then getting
better
&gt;&gt; again, rather than from bad to worse to worst.

&gt; I get the sense that the movement is from good to
&gt; bad, but at least we may have a remembrance of the good.

&gt;&gt; There's nothing
&gt;&gt; explicit in the poem that says this, though; so I suppose it's
&gt;&gt; _possible_ that the &quot;effect&quot; of &quot;beauty&quot; is a _bad_ side-effect of
&gt;&gt; beauty's having once existed. Or, maybe, that it's worse to
remember
&gt;&gt; good things that are gone beyond hope of recovery, than simply not
to
&gt;&gt; have that &quot;remembrance&quot; of them.

&gt;&gt; If this were the case, what would the overall main idea then be?
&gt;&gt; Perhaps that time drags us through the muck, so we ought to
appreciate
&gt;&gt; the &quot;distillation process&quot; that provides us the little we do end up
&gt;&gt; being able to make use of, in the end? That we ought to &quot;let go&quot;
of
&gt;&gt; whatever can't be kept intact throughout that process?

&gt; No, no, no. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Don't let me confuse you.
&gt; Clearly the poet wants a remembrance of the beautiful thing,
&gt; and thinks it a good thing to have.

"/>

Yes. The &quot;distillation process&quot; takes something good, beauty or a
flower, extracts the goodness from it, and preserves that goodness in
a very pure form that also lasts much longer than the original good
thing, and is also useable by others. (The original good thing is
turned to something like ash; in the case of the distillation of wood,
you get wood alcohol and charcoal.) In this case, the essence of a
rose blossom is used for exactly the same thing the original rose (or
other flower) was used for: smelling nice and bringing the beauty of
nature into the indoors.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; I would say that the poet is saying: DO fear old
&gt;&gt;&gt; age, because of its effects on beauty. Nor do I think he is
&gt;&gt;&gt; giving any comforting thoughts about the rewards of old age
&gt;&gt;&gt; in and of itself. Rather, he seems to be saying that
&gt;&gt;&gt; despite Time's ravages, there is something that can be done
&gt;&gt;&gt; to avoid being totally demolished.

&gt;&gt; Is what I just said, basically, what you were saying here, or do I
&gt;&gt; still not understand what you're saying?

&gt; The part of your interpretation that I was
&gt; questioning, Bianca, was where you wrote:

&gt;&quot;Don't fear old age, because old age has its own rewards,
&gt; even if those rewards are different from those of youth.&quot;

&gt; In this poem, I don't think the poet has anything
&gt; positive to say about any &quot;rewards&quot; of old age. He looks
&gt; upon old age as &quot;hideous winter&quot;, and his poem is a plea to
&gt; somehow preserve some aspect of the beauty of &quot;summer&quot; or
&gt; youth from the ravages of winter or old age.

&gt; I don't know if this makes my point any clearer.

"/>

If you're making a distinction between old age having rewards (being
rewarding) in and of itself -- and old age not having _its own_
rewards, but the memory of beauty still being a kind of reward or
pleasure for the person in old age, then I think the difference is
just in the definition each of us is giving to &quot;old age.&quot; It seems
you are defining the progression (of old age, unlike the progression
from summer to winter), as in the direction, by definition, of
decline. I'm not sure I see that in the poem, either in general or
for some particular person to whom the poem might refer.

If the poet is urging marriage, then it seems reasonable he might urge
the pleasures of domestic life and companionship in old age, or the
dangers of being old and alone. It is possible to imagine a poet
(this poet or another one) saying that old age is just plain awful and
that -- unlike with flowers -- there's nothing we humans can do about
it. I don't see that in this poem. I didn't see it at all until you
mentioned it (unless I'm misunderstanding you again), and I can only
see it with difficulty now.

&gt;&gt; No, I think he's referring here to the preservation of beauty
through the
&gt;&gt; preservation of genes. Compare those lines with these from A
Midsummer
&gt;&gt; Night's Dream:-

&gt;&gt; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
&gt;&gt; Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
&gt;&gt; Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

&gt;&gt; It seems he associates distillation with procreation.

&gt; I should have given a bit more context with that quote - and a bit more
&gt; quote. Hermia's is trying to force his daughter to marry Demetrius, and
&gt; Theseus urges compliance upon her:-

&gt; Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
&gt; You can endure the livery of a nun,
&gt; For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,

&gt; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
&gt; Than that which withering on the virgin thorn

"/>

Yes, but when Hermia accepts this choice,

So shall I live, so grow, so die, my lord,
Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.

suddenly Theseus takes it away from her, and without any comment says
she is to be married the next day, on penalty of death. I've never
seen this change accounted for, other than that Hermia's father
doesn't want her to be a nun -- the law allows for her to become one,
it's not his choice for her -- he wants her to marry Demetrius, and
Theseus is more interested in placating her father (or, if you like,
in enforcing filial piety) than in carrying out the letter of the law.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On the other hand Neil's idea of memory as a kind of distillation is also an

&gt; There is also a third possibility. Several times in the sonnets,

Of course, we haven't considered the possibility that the &quot;lovely gaze&quot; is a
thunder mug full of the queen's morning stool after a night of anal sex with
Oxford (EVERy eye, E.Ver's eye, get it? &gt;nudge nudge&lt;) that she learned from

Right. Now, what might the &quot;distillation process&quot;

13. But flowers distil'd though they with winter meete,

The poem is superficially about the March
of Time but, of course, our poet did not
write about such banalities. He used them
as a cover for his real concerns -- which
(since he was an ordinary human being
much like any of us) were almost entirely
those issues that aroused great interest
among his contemporaries at the time of
writing. Today, they'd be headline news:
events like 9/11, the hunt for Bin Laden,
the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, or the
election of a President.

Our poet had (as we know from the rest
of the canon) a passionate interest in all
things political. His task as a courtier-poet
was to comment upon current events in an
amusing and thought-provoking manner.

In adopting the cover of a 'conventional
poetic topic' he mocks the conventions, while
demonstrating that he can write verse which,
judged solely by their standards, out-classes
all that of other poets, by a very wide margin.

It is not too difficult to identify the topics,
once we know who the poet was, and
when he was writing. The principal actors
in this sonnet are
(a) a bunch of 'whores' ('howers')
(b) a female with a lovely gaze, who is also
Beauty, but who is in thrall to the whores;
(c) Summer . . who is lead on . .
(d) winter . . . probably a real person
(e) a liquid prisoner
(f) Another Beauty

The poet emphasises winter, snow, frost
bareness, and 'distillation', so we have
good clues as to which country he is talking
about -- as seen from the South of England.

I have established what the poet is writing
about, and who all these people are -- and
I have found masses of confirmatory detail.

But rather than give it to you all at once,
some of you might like to attempt your
own investigation first.

&gt;&gt; While &quot;The lovely gaze&quot; can be understood in a

&gt;&gt; this line can also be understood to refer to a *particular*
&gt;&gt; attractive sight, in this case, the addressee of the

&gt; Yes, I think it is tied to the previous sonnets, but as you observed, it is
&gt; much more abstract. I don't think you can be too concrete in this poem. For
&gt; instance, there is no specific sight, or &quot;lovely gaze,&quot; upon which *every*
&gt; eye dwells.

&gt; Of course, we haven't considered the possibility that the &quot;lovely gaze&quot; is a
&gt; thunder mug full of the queen's morning stool after a night of anal sex with
&gt; Oxford (EVERy eye, E.Ver's eye, get it? &gt;nudge nudge&lt;) that she learned from

C. S. Lewis, to 'lavish their skill on humours now confined to
the preparatory school or the barrack-room'. (English
Literature in the 16th Century, page 94) In this respect the
court of the French Renaissance at which Mary had been
reared cast at least a mantle of elegance over its corrupt morals.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, no, no. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Don't let me confuse you.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Clearly the poet wants a remembrance of the beautiful thing,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and thinks it a good thing to have.

&gt;&gt; Yes. The &quot;distillation process&quot; takes something good, beauty or a
&gt;&gt; flower, extracts the goodness from it, and preserves that goodness
in
&gt;&gt; a very pure form that also lasts much longer than the original good
&gt;&gt; thing, and is also useable by others. (The original good thing is
&gt;&gt; turned to something like ash; in the case of the distillation of
wood,
&gt;&gt; you get wood alcohol and charcoal.) In this case, the essence of a
&gt;&gt; rose blossom is used for exactly the same thing the original rose
(or
&gt;&gt; other flower) was used for: smelling nice and bringing the beauty
of
&gt;&gt; nature into the indoors.

&gt; Right. Now, what might the &quot;distillation process&quot;
&gt; mean as it is applied to a beautiful person? I've suggested
&gt; that the poet is simply repeating his mantra about having
&gt; children. Others have suggested this may be a reference to
&gt; memories.

"/>

I have some trouble working out the &quot;memory&quot; argument. I think I
prefer not to come down in any one place, at least for the moment.
The poet is clearly saying something about the passage of time, and
about various things that can happen when time passes, and comparing
one kind of thing to another. And, in my opinion, he's using the
standard, or conventional, image of youth's passing beauty, to
indicate what is wonderful for a short time but then, somehow
unexpectedly, is gone. It might mean having children, but I don't
know that yet.

Right now I'm finding it interesting to wonder what the poet may have
thought about the residues from the distillation process. I don't
know what happens, for example, to the potato after the vodka is made.
Does it become something really disgusting, or is it useful for
something or other? Maybe it tastes good? Maybe it makes a fire burn
brighter? I really don't know. (Is there anyone who's willing to own
up to having once operated a still? Some MIT fraternity brother?)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would say that the poet is saying: DO fear old
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; age, because of its effects on beauty. Nor do I think he is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; giving any comforting thoughts about the rewards of old age
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in and of itself. Rather, he seems to be saying that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; despite Time's ravages, there is something that can be done
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to avoid being totally demolished.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is what I just said, basically, what you were saying here, or do
I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; still not understand what you're saying?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The part of your interpretation that I was
&gt;&gt;&gt; questioning, Bianca, was where you wrote:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Don't fear old age, because old age has its own rewards,
&gt;&gt;&gt; even if those rewards are different from those of youth.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; In this poem, I don't think the poet has anything
&gt;&gt;&gt; positive to say about any &quot;rewards&quot; of old age. He looks
&gt;&gt;&gt; upon old age as &quot;hideous winter&quot;, and his poem is a plea to
&gt;&gt;&gt; somehow preserve some aspect of the beauty of &quot;summer&quot; or
&gt;&gt;&gt; youth from the ravages of winter or old age.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know if this makes my point any clearer.

&gt;&gt; If you're making a distinction between old age having rewards
(being
&gt;&gt; rewarding) in and of itself -- and old age not having _its own_
&gt;&gt; rewards, but the memory of beauty still being a kind of reward or
&gt;&gt; pleasure for the person in old age, then I think the difference is
&gt;&gt; just in the definition each of us is giving to &quot;old age.&quot;

&gt; I don't think the poet is saying anything positive
&gt; about the rewards of old age in and of itself. Rather, he
&gt; is looking at old age as the destroyed end result of the
&gt; effects of Time on youth.

&gt; One other thing: whether the distilled result is
&gt; memory or children, the benefit is not specifically for the
&gt; person who has gotten old, necessarily. I think it would be
&gt; for anyone and everyone who wants to appreciate the youthful
&gt; beauty of the person in question.

"/>

Yes. I _think_ I understand what you're saying. The &quot;addressee&quot;
doesn't get any rewards. He or she is (to put it somewhat crudely)
scrod. No remedy. But something can be salvaged, if only by some
elaborate process carried out perhaps in some technological manner,
and if only for the benefit of some entirely different group of people
than the one most immediately cared about by the individual involved.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It seems
&gt;&gt; you are defining the progression (of old age, unlike the
progression
&gt;&gt; from summer to winter), as in the direction, by definition, of
&gt;&gt; decline.

&gt; I think the poet is defining the progression as the
&gt; destruction of youthful beauty and the destruction of
&gt; summer's beauty.

"/>

But the beauty transmitted from a parent to a child or a grandchild is
enjoyed by a different person than the person who had initially
possessed it. The beauty reappearing in spring is possessed by the
same trees and things that had lost it in the preceding winter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure I see that in the poem, either in general or
&gt;&gt; for some particular person to whom the poem might refer.

&gt; I'm actually not sure how anyone can miss the point
&gt; I'm trying to make. Perhaps I'm not explaining it clearly
&gt; enough.

"/>

Yes, it's intuitively obvious to even the most casual observer -- no
need to give a proof. :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If the poet is urging marriage,
&gt;&gt; then it seems reasonable he might urge
&gt;&gt; the pleasures of domestic life and companionship in old age, or the
&gt;&gt; dangers of being old and alone.

&gt; If the poet was urging marriage, he might indeed
&gt; suggest those things. I don't think the poet is urging
&gt; marriage.

"/>

So not children for companionship, support, care, or a happy
hearthside circle, either?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It is possible to imagine a poet
&gt;&gt; (this poet or another one) saying that old age is just plain awful
and
&gt;&gt; that -- unlike with flowers -- there's nothing we humans can do
about
&gt;&gt; it.

&gt; He is saying that old age is awful, in the sense
&gt; that it represents beauty destroyed by time, but he is also
&gt; suggesting that there is something that can be done about
&gt; it.

"/>

Plastic surgery? Sorry.

I think I'm suggesting that (the poet is suggesting that) old age
isn't good, but that the bad parts aren't very important. In youth
you think that youth itself is good in itself, so you think that old
age (which by definition lacks youth) is bad in itself -- but in fact,
the poet (I think) suggests, you discover that the lack that develops
is not what's really important.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I don't see that in this poem. I didn't see it at all until you
&gt;&gt; mentioned it (unless I'm misunderstanding you again), and I can
only
&gt;&gt; see it with difficulty now.

&gt; We do seem to be talking past one another.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I think he's referring here to the preservation of beauty
&gt;through the
&gt;&gt;&gt; preservation of genes. Compare those lines with these from A
&gt;Midsummer
&gt;&gt;&gt; Night's Dream:-

&gt;&gt;&gt; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
&gt;&gt;&gt; Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems he associates distillation with procreation.

&gt;&gt; I should have given a bit more context with that quote - and a bit more
&gt;&gt; quote. Hermia's is trying to force his daughter to marry Demetrius, and
&gt;&gt; Theseus urges compliance upon her:-

&gt;&gt; Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
&gt;&gt; You can endure the livery of a nun,
&gt;&gt; For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
&gt;&gt; To live a barren sister all your life,
&gt;&gt; Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
&gt;&gt; Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
&gt;&gt; To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
&gt;&gt; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
&gt;&gt; Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
&gt;&gt; Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

&gt;Yes, but when Hermia accepts this choice,

&gt; So shall I live, so grow, so die, my lord,
&gt; Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
&gt; Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
&gt; My soul consents not to give sovereignty.

&gt;suddenly Theseus takes it away from her, and without any comment says
&gt;she is to be married the next day, on penalty of death. I've never
&gt;seen this change accounted for, other than that Hermia's father
&gt;doesn't want her to be a nun -- the law allows for her to become one,
&gt;it's not his choice for her -- he wants her to marry Demetrius, and
&gt;Theseus is more interested in placating her father (or, if you like,
&gt;in enforcing filial piety) than in carrying out the letter of the law.

"/>

...
No, that's not what Theseus says in reply:

Take time to pause, and by the next new moon,
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me
For everlasting bond of fellowship,
Upon that day, either prepare to die
For disobedience to your father's will,
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,
Or on Diana's altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life.

There are three possibilities.

&gt; In this poem, I don't think the poet has anything
&gt; positive to say about any &quot;rewards&quot; of old age. He looks

&gt; somehow preserve some aspect of the beauty of &quot;summer&quot; or
&gt; youth from the ravages of winter or old age.

I agree, Gary. The youth (whether male or female--only clear from the
context of the other sonnets) will become old--&quot;hideous winter&quot;--and his
only way of preserving some aspect of his/her youth is to procreate--that
would be the distillation of beauty, so important in the sonnet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was.

&gt;&gt;&gt; ...we would have no idea what we had lost.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lose but their show: their substance still lives sweet.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Our image of beauty lives on in our mind's eye, despite the passing of
&gt;&gt; time.

&gt;&gt; No, I think he's referring here to the preservation of beauty through
the
&gt;&gt; preservation of genes. Compare those lines with these from A Midsummer
&gt;&gt; Night's Dream:-

&gt;&gt; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
&gt;&gt; Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
&gt;&gt; Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

&gt;&gt; It seems he associates distillation with procreation.

&gt; I should have given a bit more context with that quote - and a bit more
&gt; quote. Hermia's is trying to force his daughter to marry Demetrius, and
&gt; Theseus urges compliance upon her:-

&gt; Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
&gt; You can endure the livery of a nun,
&gt; For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
&gt; To live a barren sister all your life,
&gt; Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
&gt; Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
&gt; To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
&gt; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
&gt; Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
&gt; Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

&gt; This seems to confirm that the poet is using the idea of distilled flowers
&gt; as a metaphor for procreation, at least in that example. So it might be
&gt; reasonable to project it onto Sonnet 5 too.

&gt; On the other hand Neil's idea of memory as a kind of distillation is also
an
&gt; attractive one. Beauty has an extended life when it exists in the memory.

&gt; There is also a third possibility. Several times in the sonnets,
&gt; Shakespeare refers to his own verse as a preserver - &quot;So long lives this,&quot;
&gt; etc. That meaning - beauty distilled in the poet's verse - could be
inferred
&gt; here too.

Good one, Buff. I think that idea is almost certainly in the sonnet also.

Another thing - you seem to be personalizing this
poem to a much greater degree than others who are commenting
on it. Most people have said this is a fairly abstract poem
addressed to the reader. If, as you say, &quot;gaze&quot; only refers
to 'eyes', does this mean that you think this poem is much
closer in nature to the first four, being addressed directly
to the fair young man? (I presume his would be the gazing
eyes that everyone would be looking at).

Some things I've noticed that others may have noticed too--as yet haven't
had a chance to read through everyone's.

Repetition of specific words that keep cropping up in different sonnets:
gaze, eye (possibly bawdy), fair(ely), frame/glasse, beauty. These must be
key words of a sort. Am also intrigued by &quot;summers&quot;. Reminds me of &quot;sum my
count.&quot; Am beginning to think this may have some kind of meaning like
&quot;tosser.&quot;

I was watching British tv last night with someone in the hotel. An American,
he didn't know that &quot;piece of crumpet&quot; had a meaning other than a bit of a
particular kind of bread. British humour, unlike American, is rife with
double entendre. It really brought it home to me the fact that the
Elizabethans had these double entendres too, but some of them are lost to us
and somehow we need to try to reconstruct them by finding out if we can see
consistent sub-meanings for them throughout the sonnets.

Also: &quot;vnfaire&quot; used as a verb: to make unfair or unbeautiful. I'm sure
everyone picked that up. Also &quot;unfair&quot; in the sense of &quot;what time does to
one is grossly unfair.&quot;

&quot;leau's,&quot; with the unusual apostrophe--Suggest this can be read &quot;water&quot;
(l'eau) as well as leaves. There might be a third meaning: &quot;leaves&quot; of a
book. That would coincide with Buff's suggestion that the poem is about
immortality through poetry. But &quot;leau's&quot; as water might have a sexual
subtext. There are &quot;wet&quot; images throughout: &quot;sap,&quot;&quot;water,&quot;&quot;distillation,&quot;
&quot;liquid&quot; can all be read as semen, and recall the earlier sonnets where the
youth is either burying or spilling his seed rather than inplanting it. In
fact the lines

Then were not summers distillation left
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glasse

remind me of sonnet 1: &quot;Within thine own bud buriest thy content.&quot;
&quot;Distillation,&quot; in some sense, is very similar to &quot;content&quot;--when it is
taken to mean substance.

&quot;Sap,&quot; of course, can also be read as (young) blood. This meaning fits well
with &quot;lustie.&quot;

barenes--&quot;bareness&quot;--has sexual overtones, but also possibly a play on
&quot;barrenness.&quot; (or &quot;distain the tillage of thy husbandry.&quot; Doesn't that lead
to barrenness?)

In other words, at some level the concerns of this sonnet are very similar
to those of preceding ones, but the &quot;tomb&quot; and legal/financial imagery has
been replaced by perfume as the offspring or distillation of the &quot;rose&quot; or
flower--i.e. the addressee. Much of the other imagery remains the
same--rose, seasons, etc.

Sorry, very disjointed. Just pointing out things as they come to me. Some
might make no sense at all--just mouse droppings.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then, were not Summer's distillation left,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But if it weren't for the preserved image of beauty from earlier
&gt;&gt;&gt; days....

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ...we would have no idea what we had lost.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lose but their show: their substance still lives sweet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Our image of beauty lives on in our mind's eye, despite the
passing
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I think he's referring here to the preservation of beauty
through
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preservation of genes. Compare those lines with these from A
Midsummer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Night's Dream:-

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems he associates distillation with procreation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I should have given a bit more context with that quote - and a bit
more
&gt;&gt;&gt; quote. Hermia's is trying to force his daughter to marry Demetrius,
and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Theseus urges compliance upon her:-

&gt;&gt;&gt; Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
&gt;&gt;&gt; You can endure the livery of a nun,
&gt;&gt;&gt; For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
&gt;&gt;&gt; To live a barren sister all your life,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
&gt;&gt;&gt; To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
&gt;&gt;&gt; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
&gt;&gt;&gt; Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This seems to confirm that the poet is using the idea of distilled
&gt; flowers
&gt;&gt;&gt; as a metaphor for procreation, at least in that example. So it might
be
&gt;&gt;&gt; reasonable to project it onto Sonnet 5 too.

&gt;&gt;&gt; On the other hand Neil's idea of memory as a kind of distillation is
&gt; also
&gt;&gt; an
&gt;&gt;&gt; attractive one. Beauty has an extended life when it exists in the
&gt; memory.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is also a third possibility. Several times in the sonnets,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare refers to his own verse as a preserver - &quot;So long lives
&gt; this,&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; etc. That meaning - beauty distilled in the poet's verse - could be
&gt;&gt; inferred
&gt;&gt;&gt; here too.

&gt;&gt; Good one, Buff. I think that idea is almost certainly in the sonnet
also.

&gt; Good one, yourself. Where have you been? I've had the Mounties combing the
&gt; district.

Yep, you are right. You're on form. Remember
that finding that 'die' pun in Sonnet 3 puts you
in a league far ABOVE that of Steven May, and
of all the standard commentators on the Sonnets.
They have never found _anything_. The very
idea that they might have found THAT is next
to inconceivable. It's as though they don blinkers/
blinders when reading these sonnets, assuming
that all that could have been found _must_ have
been found, centuries ago. I guess it's just the
academic mindset -- the dead-brain approach.

'Summer' has much the same meaning as in
Sonnet 18. And you are more-or-less right
about the rest being 'key words'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I was watching British tv last night with someone in the hotel. An American,

&gt; double entendre.

"/>

Shakespeare exploited standard ones, but
very much more than that, he developed
the 'double entendre' into an art form,
creating numerous ones of his own.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It really brought it home to me the fact that the
&gt; Elizabethans had these double entendres too, but some of them are lost to us
&gt; and somehow we need to try to reconstruct them by finding out if we can see

"/>

Start with 'howers' remembering that
(in his sonnets) Shakespeare almost
always has that mean 'whores'.
An interesting aspect there, is that as a
term of general abuse, it seems to have
gone out of fashion in the UK. It is still
one in Dublin (as you can see in Joyce)
. . 'You hoor' is (or used to be) much
more common here than 'You cunt'.
(And I'm sure that Yanks don't use it.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also: &quot;vnfaire&quot; used as a verb: to make unfair or unbeautiful.

"/>

No. You are misreading this line.
'Unfaire' here is, in effect, a noun, in
much the same way as you might say
'that beauty strolled down the street'.
'Fairely' is an adverb: ' . . which (when
in a fair state) doth excell'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Will play the tirants to the very same,
&gt;&gt;&gt; And that vnfaire which fairely doth excell:

No one has even referred to it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also &quot;unfair&quot; in the sense of &quot;what time does to
&gt; one is grossly unfair.&quot;

"/>

Forget 'Time' . . . that's for the dopes.
Shakespeare maintains the grammar of
the 'conventional theme' -- but only just.
It's not his real meaning. It's as false as
the name under which he works.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;leau's,&quot; with the unusual apostrophe--Suggest this can be read &quot;water&quot;
&gt; (l'eau) as well as leaves.

A good point. And one I had not seen.
L'eau = water = drip. The lusty drip has
gone. That fits in with 'sap' (see below).
It's a little extenuated though.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sap checkt with frost and lustie leau's quite gon.
&gt; There might be a third meaning: &quot;leaves&quot; of a book.

Nah. Such leaves are unlikely to be
'lustie' -- nor to be 'quite gon'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That would coincide with Buff's suggestion that the poem is about
&gt; immortality through poetry.

Buffalo is a dope. No one writes like that.
(Or, at least, no one who has the remotest
hope of producing decent verse or prose.)
Have you seen the film 'Troy' btw -- all the
warriors claim that they are taking part so
that their names will go down in history.
Utter bullshit. Soldiers never talk like that.
They would not dream of doing so. It
reminded me of the sort of thing we hear
from the likes of Buffalo all the time -- not
the least connection with any reality.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But &quot;leau's&quot; as water might have a sexual
&gt; subtext. There are &quot;wet&quot; images throughout: &quot;sap,&quot;&quot;water,&quot;&quot;distillation,&quot;

&gt; youth is either burying or spilling his seed rather than inplanting it. In

&gt; A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glasse

"/>

'Walls of glass' is not too hard to decipher.
Try a web search on the phrase.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; remind me of sonnet 1: &quot;Within thine own bud buriest thy content.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Distillation,&quot; in some sense, is very similar to &quot;content&quot;--when it is
&gt; taken to mean substance.

&gt;&quot;Sap,&quot; of course, can also be read as (young) blood. This meaning fits well
&gt; with &quot;lustie.&quot;

"/>

Very good -- but 'sap' can be read as 'fool,
nincompoop' as well -- and that's its principal
meaning here. Work out which 'lusty
nincompoop' fits. A good rule to apply with
this poet is to assume that if a word has an
abusive sense (when used to, or about, a
person) then that's his principal meaning.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; barenes--&quot;bareness&quot;--has sexual overtones, but also possibly a play on
&gt;&quot;barrenness.&quot;

"/>

Very good. The OED shows 'barenes' as a
16C spelling of 'barrenness'. Although, in
this instance, it's a relative minor theme.
'Bareness' (of a person, but not in a sexual
sense) was his principal allusion here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (or &quot;distain the tillage of thy husbandry.&quot; Doesn't that lead
&gt; to barrenness?)

"/>

In this context . . . yes and no. If the lady
in question had accepted the 'tillage of
thy husbandry' she would not have got
into all this fearful mess. But that scheme
was never really a runner.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In other words, at some level the concerns of this sonnet are very similar
&gt; to those of preceding ones, but the &quot;tomb&quot; and legal/financial imagery has
&gt; been replaced by perfume as the offspring or distillation of the &quot;rose&quot; or
&gt; flower--i.e. the addressee. Much of the other imagery remains the
&gt; same--rose, seasons, etc.

&gt; Sorry, very disjointed. Just pointing out things as they come to me.

"/>

But streets ahead of everyone else around here.

This place is often like one of those dreadful
'poetry society' meetings, where everyone
takes themselves oh-so-seriously. The notion
that Shakespeare might have had a sense of
humour, or used terms in any way but
absolutely straight (if with peculiar grammar)
just does not arise.

As you can gather (and as I have mentioned
elsewhere) I have sorted this sonnet out. As
always, its very different from what you might
expect on a superficial reading. It's not a
'marriage sonnet' at all. I'm holding fire on my
exegesis for the moment, to see if anyone is
interested in following clues. It's much more
fun to sort out much of the meaning for
yourself, than to have it all handed to you
on a plate.

Paul.

Epilogue To _The Hunting of the SNARK_
Lewis Carroll (1876)

Inscribed to a dear Child:
in memory of golden summer hours
and whispers of a summer sea.

[G I R T] with a boyish garb for boyish task,
[E]ager she wields her SPADE; yet loves as well
[R]est on a friendly knee, intent to ask
[T]he tale he loves to tell.

[R U D E] spirits of the seething outer strife,
[U]nmeet to read her pure and simple spright,
[D]eem, if you list, such hours a WASTE of life,
[E]mpty of all delight!

[C H A T], sweet Maid, and rescue from ANNOY
[H]earts that by wiser talk are unbeguiled.
[A]h, happy he who owns that tenderest JOY,
[T]he heart-love of a child!

[A W A Y], fond thoughts, and vex my soul no more!
[W]ork claims my wakeful nights, my busy days--
[A]lbeit bright memories of that sunlit shore
[Y]et haunt my dreaming gaze!

You'd have to ask the lawyers (and the English teachers/professors) present.
I think he gave the most cogent argument for the traditional side I've ever
heard. Usually it's the name on the quartos, the evidence of the first folio
and the monument. Repetition of such points and belittling of the other side
can become boring. May, to his credit, was above all that. Diana Price,
Roger, and others certainly triggered a fair bit of thinking too. William
Niederkorn, who at present describes himself &quot;open&quot; on the authorship
question, gave a wonderfully entertaining talk on the history of authorship
(and its legal ramifications), as reported in the New York Times over the
last 150 years or so.

Happy to speak to you, Paul, if you don't insult me when you think I'm
wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Repetition of specific words that keep cropping up in different sonnets:
&gt;&gt; gaze, eye (possibly bawdy), fair(ely), frame/glasse, beauty. These must
be
&gt;&gt; key words of a sort. Am also intrigued by &quot;summers&quot;. Reminds me of &quot;sum
my
&gt;&gt; count.&quot; Am beginning to think this may have some kind of meaning like
&gt;&gt;&quot;tosser.&quot;

&gt; Yep, you are right. You're on form. Remember
&gt; that finding that 'die' pun in Sonnet 3 puts you
&gt; in a league far ABOVE that of Steven May, and
&gt; of all the standard commentators on the Sonnets.

"/>

I would never criticise May or Vendler or Booth. They've all made
interesting discoveries. I prefer to read the sonnets for myself, though,
and come to my own conclusions in concert with people here. Someone at the c
onference told me that an author has written an interesting book on bawdy
language in the sonnets. I can't remember the name of the author, but I need
to find it and look at it. It may be that he discovered the &quot;die&quot; pun before
I did.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They have never found _anything_. The very
&gt; idea that they might have found THAT is next
&gt; to inconceivable. It's as though they don blinkers/
&gt; blinders when reading these sonnets, assuming
&gt; that all that could have been found _must_ have
&gt; been found, centuries ago. I guess it's just the
&gt; academic mindset -- the dead-brain approach.

"/>

I really feel most people are doing their best, as am I. It's only those who
are totally hampered by the authorship question, on either side of the
debate, who cannot go further than a certain point because they're afraid it
nullifies their candidate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; 'Summer' has much the same meaning as in
&gt; Sonnet 18. And you are more-or-less right
&gt; about the rest being 'key words'.

&gt;&gt; I was watching British tv last night with someone in the hotel. An
American,
&gt;&gt; he didn't know that &quot;piece of crumpet&quot; had a meaning other than a bit of
a
&gt;&gt; particular kind of bread. British humour, unlike American, is rife with
&gt;&gt; double entendre.

&gt; Shakespeare exploited standard ones, but
&gt; very much more than that, he developed
&gt; the 'double entendre' into an art form,
&gt; creating numerous ones of his own.

"/>

We have to see if certain words can legitimately have a double meaning by
reading for consistency throughout.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; It really brought it home to me the fact that the
&gt;&gt; Elizabethans had these double entendres too, but some of them are lost
to us
&gt;&gt; and somehow we need to try to reconstruct them by finding out if we can
see
&gt;&gt; consistent sub-meanings for them throughout the sonnets.

&gt; Start with 'howers' remembering that
&gt; (in his sonnets) Shakespeare almost
&gt; always has that mean 'whores'.
&gt; An interesting aspect there, is that as a
&gt; term of general abuse, it seems to have
&gt; gone out of fashion in the UK. It is still
&gt; one in Dublin (as you can see in Joyce)
&gt; . . 'You hoor' is (or used to be) much
&gt; more common here than 'You cunt'.
&gt; (And I'm sure that Yanks don't use it.)

"/>

Yes, I saw the possible play on &quot;hours,&quot; but couldn't see how it worked in
context. I still don't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Also: &quot;vnfaire&quot; used as a verb: to make unfair or unbeautiful.

&gt; No. You are misreading this line.
&gt; 'Unfaire' here is, in effect, a noun, in
&gt; much the same way as you might say
&gt; 'that beauty strolled down the street'.
&gt; 'Fairely' is an adverb: ' . . which (when
&gt; in a fair state) doth excell'.

"/>

As a part of speech it can read as both a noun and a verb. That is one of
Shakespeare's strengths. And as a verb it's very clever--a made up use of
the word that leads us to a new meaning.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Will play the tirants to the very same,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And that vnfaire which fairely doth excell:

&gt;&gt; I'm sure everyone picked that up.

&gt; No one has even referred to it.

&gt;&gt; Also &quot;unfair&quot; in the sense of &quot;what time does to
&gt;&gt; one is grossly unfair.&quot;

&gt; Forget 'Time' . . . that's for the dopes.
&gt; Shakespeare maintains the grammar of
&gt; the 'conventional theme' -- but only just.
&gt; It's not his real meaning. It's as false as
&gt; the name under which he works.

"/>

The point is, Paul, that you cannot forget &quot;time.&quot; It's an essential theme
in the sonnets. You can posit that it has other meanings also, if you like,
but you cannot get away from the notion that &quot;tempus fugit.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&quot;leau's,&quot; with the unusual apostrophe--Suggest this can be read &quot;water&quot;
&gt;&gt; (l'eau) as well as leaves.

&gt; A good point. And one I had not seen.
&gt; L'eau = water = drip. The lusty drip has
&gt; gone. That fits in with 'sap' (see below).
&gt; It's a little extenuated though.

"/>

Well, I don't get to drip from L'eau. It's too much of a stretch. I assume
you mean &quot;idiot.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sap checkt with frost and lustie leau's quite gon.

&gt;&gt; There might be a third meaning: &quot;leaves&quot; of a book.

&gt; Nah. Such leaves are unlikely to be
&gt; 'lustie' -- nor to be 'quite gon'.

"/>

That's true. I was thinking of it as a reminder that we are reading poetry.
But point taken. I do think, however, that &quot;leaves&quot; can also echo &quot;quite
gone&quot; in the sense that &quot;s/he LEAVES us, is quite gone.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; That would coincide with Buff's suggestion that the poem is about
&gt;&gt; immortality through poetry.

&gt; Buffalo is a dope.

"/>

He is far from one, and I accept his reading. It's excellent.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;No one writes like that.

"/>

Um, Shakespeare appears to have done. What is more, the idea of immortality
of the addressee by way of the poet's verse was not unknown at the time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (Or, at least, no one who has the remotest
&gt; hope of producing decent verse or prose.)
&gt; Have you seen the film 'Troy' btw -- all the
&gt; warriors claim that they are taking part so
&gt; that their names will go down in history.

"/>

No, haven't seen it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Utter bullshit. Soldiers never talk like that.
&gt; They would not dream of doing so. It
&gt; reminded me of the sort of thing we hear
&gt; from the likes of Buffalo all the time -- not
&gt; the least connection with any reality.

&gt;&gt; But &quot;leau's&quot; as water might have a sexual
&gt;&gt; subtext. There are &quot;wet&quot; images throughout: &quot;sap,&quot;&quot;water,&quot;
&quot;distillation,&quot;
&gt;&gt;&quot;liquid&quot; can all be read as semen, and recall the earlier sonnets where
the
&gt;&gt; youth is either burying or spilling his seed rather than inplanting it.
In
&gt;&gt; fact the lines

&gt;&gt; Then were not summers distillation left

&gt; Take a good look at 'summers distillation',
&gt; remembering that 'summer' is something
&gt; of 'a tosser'.

"/>

Well, I would say again that &quot;summers distillation&quot; would be semen, as well,
possibly, as offspring. At the most accessible level, of course, it simply
means perfume.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glasse

&gt; 'Walls of glass' is not too hard to decipher.
&gt; Try a web search on the phrase.

"/>

I did. Care to help out? My assumption is that at the sexual level it means
vagina or womb. So &quot;liquid prisoner pent in walls of glasse&quot; would mean
&quot;semen entrapped in a woman's body.&quot; Not sure why the glass is there,
though, although it follows the image/glass/frame imagery to be found
throughout this sequence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; remind me of sonnet 1: &quot;Within thine own bud buriest thy content.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Distillation,&quot; in some sense, is very similar to &quot;content&quot;--when it is
&gt;&gt; taken to mean substance.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Sap,&quot; of course, can also be read as (young) blood. This meaning fits
well
&gt;&gt; with &quot;lustie.&quot;

&gt; Very good -- but 'sap' can be read as 'fool,
&gt; nincompoop' as well -- and that's its principal
&gt; meaning here.

"/>

No, the principal meaning has to be the liquid of a plant. We can find all
sorts of other meanings. When was &quot;sap&quot; first used to mean a fool?

Work out which 'lusty

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; nincompoop' fits. A good rule to apply with
&gt; this poet is to assume that if a word has an
&gt; abusive sense (when used to, or about, a
&gt; person) then that's his principal meaning.

&gt;&gt; barenes--&quot;bareness&quot;--has sexual overtones, but also possibly a play on
&gt;&gt;&quot;barrenness.&quot;

&gt; Very good. The OED shows 'barenes' as a
&gt; 16C spelling of 'barrenness'. Although, in
&gt; this instance, it's a relative minor theme.
&gt; 'Bareness' (of a person, but not in a sexual
&gt; sense) was his principal allusion here.

"/>

Hard to know. But I'm glad the OED bore out my hunch.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; (or &quot;distain the tillage of thy husbandry.&quot; Doesn't that lead
&gt;&gt; to barrenness?)

&gt; In this context . . . yes and no. If the lady
&gt; in question had accepted the 'tillage of
&gt; thy husbandry' she would not have got
&gt; into all this fearful mess. But that scheme
&gt; was never really a runner.

&gt;&gt; In other words, at some level the concerns of this sonnet are very
similar
&gt;&gt; to those of preceding ones, but the &quot;tomb&quot; and legal/financial imagery
has
&gt;&gt; been replaced by perfume as the offspring or distillation of the &quot;rose&quot;
or
&gt;&gt; flower--i.e. the addressee. Much of the other imagery remains the
&gt;&gt; same--rose, seasons, etc.

&gt;&gt; Sorry, very disjointed. Just pointing out things as they come to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the poet is defining the progression as the
&gt;&gt;&gt; destruction of youthful beauty and the destruction of
&gt;&gt;&gt; summer's beauty.

&gt;&gt;But the beauty transmitted from a parent to a child or a grandchild is
&gt;&gt;enjoyed by a different person than the person who had initially
&gt;&gt;possessed it. The beauty reappearing in spring is possessed by the
&gt;&gt;same trees and things that had lost it in the preceding winter.

&gt; Gotta admit, Bianca, you've thrown me with this one!
&gt; A very unusual take, IMO. I actually don't think that the
&gt; poet was too concerned about this apparent disparity, but
&gt; who knows? And I got a chuckle out of it.

"/>

I don't think I get the joke. What's so funny about pointing out the
distinction between motion in a straight line, and motion in a circle?
Why wouldn't a poet be concerned about this apparent disparity
between what he'd intended to say, and what people might take him to
be saying? In this particular instance, obviously, nobody would think
he didn't _know_ that summer comes back around again, after winter.
But people _could_ conceivably think he'd been sloppy. And it would
be sloppy, for a poet, to ruin your message by making people think
something different from what you'd wanted to say, and later have them
realize that the problem had just been your own ineptness at writing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I think he's referring here to the preservation of beauty
&gt;&gt; through the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preservation of genes. Compare those lines with these from A
&gt;&gt; Midsummer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Night's Dream:-

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems he associates distillation with procreation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I should have given a bit more context with that quote - and a bit
more
&gt;&gt;&gt; quote. Hermia's is trying to force his daughter to marry
Demetrius, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Theseus urges compliance upon her:-

&gt;&gt;&gt; Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
&gt;&gt;&gt; You can endure the livery of a nun,
&gt;&gt;&gt; For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
&gt;&gt;&gt; To live a barren sister all your life,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
&gt;&gt;&gt; To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
&gt;&gt;&gt; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
&gt;&gt;&gt; Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

&gt;&gt; Yes, but when Hermia accepts this choice,

&gt;&gt; So shall I live, so grow, so die, my lord,
&gt;&gt; Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
&gt;&gt; Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
&gt;&gt; My soul consents not to give sovereignty.

&gt;&gt; suddenly Theseus takes it away from her, and without any comment
says
&gt;&gt; she is to be married the next day, on penalty of death. I've never
&gt;&gt; seen this change accounted for, other than that Hermia's father
&gt;&gt; doesn't want her to be a nun -- the law allows for her to become
one,
&gt;&gt; it's not his choice for her -- he wants her to marry Demetrius, and
&gt;&gt; Theseus is more interested in placating her father (or, if you
like,
&gt;&gt; in enforcing filial piety) than in carrying out the letter of the
law.
&gt; ...
&gt; No, that's not what Theseus says in reply:

&gt; Take time to pause, and by the next new moon,
&gt; The sealing-day betwixt my love and me
&gt; For everlasting bond of fellowship,
&gt; Upon that day, either prepare to die
&gt; For disobedience to your father's will,
&gt; Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,
&gt; Or on Diana's altar to protest
&gt; For aye austerity and single life.

&gt; There are three possibilities.

"/>

Oops, you're right. Thanks for pointing that out. There are two
possibilities, convent and marriage to Demetrius, she accepts the
former, and then Theseus adds the death sentence. Forget all of what
I said. :-)

Also, on the other thread, if my mother would have to be _really_ old
to have seen the A's play in Philadelphia, then she didn't see that.
It might have been the Phillies at Connie Mack Stadium. I can't keep
that straight. (Whew!)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The material was excellent. The tone of the conference was friendly
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uplifting. I left with much to think about.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully, the thinking was trigered by Stephen May.

&gt;&gt; You'd have to ask the lawyers (and the English teachers/professors)
&gt; present.
&gt;&gt; I think he gave the most cogent argument for the traditional side I've
&gt; ever
&gt;&gt; heard. Usually it's the name on the quartos, the evidence of the first
&gt; folio
&gt;&gt; and the monument.

&gt; And the other evidence as well, Lynne. Please don't play coy on this

point.

Well, apart from Steve, who spoke about style, there was very little other
new evidence given on the orthodox side. The most interesting thing was that
the traditionalists were beginning to bend. At least two (one of whom was
Carroll; the other may have been Alan N, but I'm not sure), suggested that
_Hamlet_ was at least in part Oxford's biography, but also suggested that he
had an interesting life which begged to be told--by Will Shakespeare of
Stratford.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Repetition of such points and belittling of the other side
&gt;&gt; can become boring.

&gt; When Oxfordians start coming up with something other than warmed-over
&gt; Looney, we'll come up with something new as well.

When you come to our conference, you'll be able to see for yourself what we
serve up, including a very good Sunday lunch.

&gt; May, to his credit, was above all that. Diana Price,
&gt;&gt; Roger, and others certainly triggered a fair bit of thinking too.

&gt; Price has been praised by no less than Kathman on a recent article, so
&gt; perhaps she's left the crank catagory she entered with her silly book.

Diana praised something I told her about the Davies' poem, and asked if I
were going to publish on it, so perhaps by association I might become
uncranked.

&gt; William
&gt;&gt; Niederkorn, who at present describes himself &quot;open&quot; on the authorship
&gt;&gt; question, gave a wonderfully entertaining talk on the history of
&gt; authorship
&gt;&gt; (and its legal ramifications), as reported in the New York Times over
the
&gt;&gt; last 150 years or so.

&gt; Could you elaborate on this presentation?

"/>

It was a powerpoint presentation that showed all the articles (and some
letters) published in the NYT on authorship that had some kind of legal
connection, from the beginning of the authorship controversy--with reference
to Bacon--to William's own article in 2002 . Some of the articles were
hysterical--people suing other people, for example, over authorship, and a
judge returning a verdict that Bacon did write the works. After profound
criticism, the judge withdrew from the case and abandoned his judgement
(perhaps in both senses of the word).

Nobody picked it out specifically as a verb, but it is implicit in most

The use of &quot;un&quot; to reverse an adjective has a few precedents, such as:-

My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.
(Richard II)

I also think it's the only meaning. I don't think the modern use of &quot;unfair&quot;

I think I could make a good and consistent reading for the youth not leaving
his &quot;distillation&quot; (semen, substance) in the sense of getting an heir.
&quot;Beauties effect&quot; would then mean offspring. It's rather straightforward,
but I can do it if you like.

Ditto for the conventional growing old reading. It occurred to me that
&quot;Beauty ore-snow'd&quot; could mean that as the young man ages his hair turns
white.

I think, working on what you suggested before, I could also give a
consistent reading for literary work for the following lines:

Then were not summers distillation left
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glasse,
Beauties effect with beauty were bereft,
Nor it nor noe remembrance what it was.
But flowers distil'd though they with winter meete,
Leese but their show,their substance still liues sweet.

&quot;If summer's distillation&quot; (the poem about the youth) had not been written
(for posterity)

&quot;liquid&quot;=the poem is open to different meanings by different readers

&quot;prisoner pent in walls of glass&quot;= the poem is imprisoned between the pages
of a book; the poet's &quot;child&quot; (the poem) born of his intellectual/artistic
&quot;womb&quot;

&quot;beauties effect with beauty were bereft&quot;= the (lost) possibility of the
poem and its artistic effect would die with the death of the beauty of the
youth

&quot;Nor it nor noe remembrance what it was&quot;--leaving no memory of what it was
either in the youth's now old visage or in poetry.

&quot;But flowers distil'd though they with winter meete&quot;--but youths who have
been turned into beautiful poetry, though they lose their own beauty as they
age

&quot;Leese but their show,their substance still liues sweet&quot;--only lose their
former looks (which were only on lease to them anyway) while their sometime
beauty gains immortality via the poet's verse.

&quot;Frame&quot; at the beginning also suggests capturing the beloved's likeness in
art.

Not sure at all I'm answering your question. Were you wanting me to do a
&quot;procreation&quot; reading?

Lynne, confused as usual.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the poet is defining the progression as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; destruction of youthful beauty and the destruction of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; summer's beauty.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But the beauty transmitted from a parent to a child or a grandchild is
&gt;&gt;&gt;enjoyed by a different person than the person who had initially
&gt;&gt;&gt;possessed it. The beauty reappearing in spring is possessed by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;same trees and things that had lost it in the preceding winter.

&gt;&gt; Gotta admit, Bianca, you've thrown me with this one!
&gt;&gt; A very unusual take, IMO. I actually don't think that the
&gt;&gt; poet was too concerned about this apparent disparity, but
&gt;&gt; who knows? And I got a chuckle out of it.

&gt;I don't think I get the joke. What's so funny about pointing out the
&gt;distinction between motion in a straight line, and motion in a circle?

Because that reading, in this poem, hadn't occurred

&gt;In this particular instance, obviously, nobody would think

I have to admit, it didn't occur to me (in the
context of this poem). I took it in a strictly linear sense
- here's Summer, then bang!, winter kills it, and that's
that. No sense at all that summer would return, which I
think would make a mishmash of the poem (or at least my
understanding of the poem).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;But people _could_ conceivably think he'd been sloppy. And it would
&gt;be sloppy, for a poet, to ruin your message by making people think
&gt;something different from what you'd wanted to say, and later have them
&gt;realize that the problem had just been your own ineptness at writing.

Again, Bianca, I think you have an unusual take on
this poem. Or perhaps I do. That's what makes these
discussions enjoyable.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I wonder if restricting &quot;gaze&quot; to &quot;eyes&quot; isn't a bit

&gt;&gt;Only if we can understand 'gaze' to mean not the looking, but the
&gt;&gt;thing looked at.

&gt; Exactly.

&gt;&gt;Can we really do that? As I see it, no.

&gt; And in my view, yes.

&gt;&gt;'Gaze' is different from 'view'.

&gt; True, but this is a poem we're talking about, and a
&gt;pretty ingenious poet.

&gt;&gt;So 'gaze' has to mean 'looking', reasonably
&gt;&gt;extended to 'the eyes that look'. I gave a couple of examples of
&gt;&gt;Shakespeare's referring to the addressee's eyes.

&gt; Another thing - you seem to be personalizing this
&gt;poem to a much greater degree than others who are commenting
&gt;on it. Most people have said this is a fairly abstract poem
&gt;addressed to the reader. If, as you say, &quot;gaze&quot; only refers
&gt;to 'eyes', does this mean that you think this poem is much
&gt;closer in nature to the first four, being addressed directly
&gt;to the fair young man? (I presume his would be the gazing
&gt;eyes that everyone would be looking at).

&gt;SNIP

"/>

I think that 'the lovelygaze' is fairly close to being a vocative.
Yes, the addressee is as before. Now, I have carefully refrained from
looking at the next poem, but repeat the suspicion that our problems
may arise from having only half the story!

Well you should. Read their 'exegeses' of the

If they were honest they would say in most
cases: &quot;I have not a clue what this sonnet is
about&quot; -- but they are academic shits, and
that kind of honesty is unthinkable, given
their profession. Also it does not sell books.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Also: &quot;vnfaire&quot; used as a verb: to make unfair or unbeautiful.

&gt;&gt; No. You are misreading this line.
&gt;&gt; 'Unfaire' here is, in effect, a noun, in
&gt;&gt; much the same way as you might say
&gt;&gt; 'that beauty strolled down the street'.
&gt;&gt; 'Fairely' is an adverb: ' . . which (when
&gt;&gt; in a fair state) doth excell'.

&gt; As a part of speech it can read as both a noun and a verb. That is one of
&gt; Shakespeare's strengths. And as a verb it's very clever--a made up use of
&gt; the word that leads us to a new meaning.

Crap and bullshit. I had not looked at
the commentaries before, but now I see
that this 'interpretation' goes back to
Malone. One idiot -- with not a clue in his
head -- copying another, right back to the

a vague stab in the dark by Malone, but
it's now achieved a Biblical standard of

It's a 'cover-theme' in much the same way

There was a great fashion in 16th century
architecture for 'walls of glass'. Of course,
they could only be afforded by the extremely

I'd say it was first used as far back as such

Theoretically, this sonnet could have
been addressed to any knowledgeable
person in the Elizabethan court. There
is no 'thou', 'you', 'thy' or 'thee'. It's a
commentary on current political events.
We can assume that it was addressed
to the usual person -- who loved fine
poetry, and had the capacity to
appreciate all the subtleties created by
our poet . . . . and who was _worth_
addressing with such fervour and such
dedication.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the poet is defining the progression as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; destruction of youthful beauty and the destruction of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; summer's beauty.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But the beauty transmitted from a parent to a child or a grandchild is
&gt;&gt;&gt;enjoyed by a different person than the person who had initially
&gt;&gt;&gt;possessed it. The beauty reappearing in spring is possessed by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;same trees and things that had lost it in the preceding winter.

&gt;&gt; Gotta admit, Bianca, you've thrown me with this one!
&gt;&gt; A very unusual take, IMO. I actually don't think that the
&gt;&gt; poet was too concerned about this apparent disparity, but
&gt;&gt; who knows? And I got a chuckle out of it.

&gt; I don't think I get the joke. What's so funny about pointing out the
&gt; distinction between motion in a straight line, and motion in a circle?
&gt; Why wouldn't a poet be concerned about this apparent disparity
&gt; between what he'd intended to say, and what people might take him to
&gt; be saying? In this particular instance, obviously, nobody would think
&gt; he didn't _know_ that summer comes back around again, after winter.
&gt; But people _could_ conceivably think he'd been sloppy. And it would
&gt; be sloppy, for a poet, to ruin your message by making people think
&gt; something different from what you'd wanted to say, and later have them
&gt; realize that the problem had just been your own ineptness at writing.

The return of the seasons would not be incongruous because Shakespeare is
comparing a life to a year, not to just one season. The different stages of
life have often been compared to the passage of the seasons throughout the
year.

&gt;&gt; I had not bothered to consult the standard
&gt;&gt; commentaries on this sonnet before working
&gt;&gt; out the meaning. But now I see that this crazy
&gt;&gt; invention of a verb 'unfair' dates back to
&gt;&gt; Malone. Every purblind, ignorant, saphead
&gt;&gt; Stratfordian 'scholar' has faithfully copied it
&gt;&gt; from him (directly or indirectly) down the
&gt;&gt; centuries.

&gt; I know nothing about how Malone interpreted this line, nor any other
&gt; scholar. My reading is my own.

"/>

Yes -- of course it is. What else would
anyone think?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I should think the same is true for everyone else on this ng who
&gt; has interpreted the word &quot;unfair&quot; as a verb. It needs no
&gt; advanced scholarship.

"/>

Fair point. In fact, as we all know it's a word
in common use -- a verb. I heard it on TV last
night in one of George Bush's speeches.
Although, I have to admit I can't exactly recall
the context -- something about Al-Quada
unfairing the Iraqis. Or was it about Bin
Laden unfairing the Twin Towers? Hmm . .

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They would have made a verb of it, as I did.

"/>

Yes, naturally. And you don't pretend to be
cleverer than anyone else -- just a plain
ordinary guy. Now, could you help me out
with that speech. In what context, could
he -- or ANYONE in public life -- use such
a construction?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Here it simply means &quot;de-beautify&quot;, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; has no secondary meaning.

&gt;&gt; Sure, and for what possible reason would
&gt;&gt; a poet want a secondary meaning?

&gt;&gt; And isn't 'de-beautify' an elegant concept?

&gt; Yes it is. And it's a verb, like the word I translated it from.

"/>

It is so elegant that we hear it all the
time on TV, and see it in all the best
publications. The New Yorker loves it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; So what could be wrong with 'unfair' used
&gt;&gt; in the same way?

&gt; Nothing at all. It's a fine verb, as well as a fine concept.

"/>

Indeed. It's quite surprising Shakespeare
did not use it directly in his sonnets.

Maybe it was the Pope used it when talking
to George. Perhaps he was worried that
George was de-beautifying Iraq. Or was it
about Israel de-beautifying the Palestinian
camps in Gaza?

It would help to make a good political slogan,
don't you think? &quot;Hey, Hey, LBJ, how many
kids did you de-beautify today?&quot;

Do you think you could sell something
like that the John Kerry campaign?
Or how about helping out Ralph Nader?
. . The unfairing of the environment?
You've got to admit it's catchy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; It has to be a verb, or else the line is left without one
&gt;&gt;&gt; (&quot;excel&quot; belongs to a subordinate clause), and would therefore be left
&gt;&gt;&gt; without a meaning

&gt;&gt; 1. Those howers that with gentle worke did frame,
&gt;&gt; 2. The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
&gt;&gt; 3. Will play the tirants to the very same,
&gt;&gt; 4. And that unfaire which fairely doth excell:

&gt;&gt; Line 4 is a further description of the entity
&gt;&gt; designated by 'the very same'. Let's put the
&gt;&gt; verse into the mouth of a royalist in 1641:
&gt;&gt; 'Those hoors (in Parliament) . . . will play the
&gt;&gt; tyrants to King Charles, and that unfaire . . . &quot;

&gt;&gt; Here 'that unfaire' might be a derogatory
&gt;&gt; designation of Queen Henrietta.

&gt; You've changed your mind, then?

"/>

I was just pointing out to you that you
were wrong. There is no need for a verb
in this line, when you read it in this way.
Of course, your way is SO elegant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now you'd prefer it to be a noun, though not
&gt; an elegant one.

"/>

Well, in the context, it's really an adjective that
the poet is making serve as a noun. That way
he can pun on 'unfair' meaning 'not beautiful'
and on 'unfair' meaning 'not just'.

But why would he want to do such a silly
thing as create puns -- when he can invent
fine verbs like 'de-beautify' -- or their
equivalent? Puns were not really his style.
He preferred to invent terrific verbs -- in the
manner of the Great Grumman.

5

Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
Will play the tyrants to the very same
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
For never-resting time leads Summer on
To hideous winter, and confounds him there;
sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,
Beauty o'er-snowed, and bareness everywhere.
Then, were not Summer's distillation left,
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft;
Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was.
But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,
Lose but their show: their substance still lives sweet.

So what have we learned from Sonnet 5 that we didn't
already know from the first four sonnets?

Nothing in particular. However Sonnet 5 does
represent a change in style from the preceding four. It's
more abstract. It's not as clearly addressed to the
addressee of the first four sonnets as are the first four.
Whether this is significant remains to be seen. Reading the
poem as though it were addressed to the FYM, the poet again
repeats the necessity of preserving beauty, probably in the
form of children.

*****************************************************

The story so far:

So after five sonnets, what do we know? -

In all probability the addressee of these five
sonnets is the same person (although there may be some
dispute about Sonnet 5).

The poet says the addressee is physically
attractive. The description of that beauty is in terms that
would seem more suitable to a woman than a man.

The poet says that the addressee is narcissistic.

The poet may be chiding the addressee's sexual
habits.

The addressee is male. (3)

The addressee is of marriageable age, meaning (I
think) that he would be in the 17 - 26 age range.

The poet, having posed a problem for the addressee,
is offering a solution to that problem. After all, it's
only the poet's assertion that beautiful people have some
sort of obligation to the world to propagate or preserve
their beauty.

The poet seems singularly concerned with the
addressee's beauty, and not overly much with the addressee
as a person.

While seeming to chastise the addressee for his
narcissistic failure to preserve or propagate his beauty,
the poet is, at the same time, acknowledging that beauty,
and so is flattering the addressee.

We still don't know the sex of the poet.

We still don't know which class the poet or the
addressee belong to.

We still don't know what the relationship is between
the poet and the addressee. Is he a relative or family
friend - the poems so far have an avuncular quality to them.
Or perhaps he is in a position of some authority over the
addressee - a teacher maybe. The poems can also be read as
being deferential - perhaps the poet is in a subordinate
position to the addressee. Perhaps later sonnets will make
this clear. Or perhaps not.

1. Those howers that with gentle worke did frame,
2. The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell

5. For never resting time leads Summer on,
6. To hidious winter and confounds him there,
7. Sap checkt with frost and lustie leav's quite gon.
8. Beauty ore-snow'd and barenes every where,

12. Nor it nor noe remembrance what it was.
13. But flowers distil'd though they with winter meete,
14. Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.

The poem is superficially about the March
of Time but, of course, our poet did not
write about such banalities. He used them
as a cover for his real concerns -- which
(since he was an ordinary human being
much like any of us) were almost entirely
those issues that aroused great interest
among his contemporaries at the time of
writing. Today, they'd be headline news:
events like 9/11, or the war in Iraq, or the
election of a President.

Our poet had (as we know from the rest
of the canon) a passionate interest in all
things political. His task as a courtier-poet
was to comment upon them in an amusing
and thought-provoking manner.

In adopting the cover of a 'conventional
poetic topic' he mocks the conventions, while
demonstrating that he can write verse which,
judged solely by their standards, out-classes
all that of other poets, by a very wide margin.

It is not too difficult to identify the topics,
once we know who the poet was, and
when he was writing. The principal actors
in this sonnet are
(a) a bunch of 'whores' ('howers')
(b) a female with a lovely gaze, who is also
Beauty, but who is in thrall to the whores;
(c) Summer . . who is lead on . .
(d) winter . . . probably a real person
(e) a liquid prisoner
(f) Another Beauty

The poet emphasises 'distillation', winter,
snow, frost and bareness, so we have
good clues as to which country he is
talking about -- as seen from the South
of England.

This sonnet was written in July-August
of 1567, soon after the poet had heard of
the public humiliation of Mary Queen of
Scots, and had received information about
the first few weeks of her imprisonment.
(See the excerpts from Antonia Fraser below.)

1. Those howers that with gentle worke did frame,

The 'whores' are the Scottish lairds, who
had 'framed' their Queen -- with numerous
dishonourable pacts among themselves,
including (a) one to murder Darnley, followed
by (b) one which effectively compelled her
to marry Bothwell, followed by (c) one to
pull Bothwell down, prosecute him for the
murder of Darnley, and release Mary from his
thralldom, and finally (d) one to use physical
threats to force Mary's abdication. 'Gentle'
fits their rank, but is intended entirely
sarcastically.

2. The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell

This is primarily an ironic reference to the
quite unlovely state of Mary QS at that
time, and the fact that most of Edinburgh
had seen her in this state. 'Lovely' could
also mean 'loving' at the time. Mary had
made much of how she loved all her
people and how they loved her in return,
but at this point she was so unwell and
so distraught, that she did not pretend
to love anyone. Indeed, she had spoken
of suicide soon after her marriage to
Bothwell.

There is a pun on 'eye' / 'ay' (i.e. every
Scotsman).

3. Will play the tirants to the very same,

Bothwell had five brief weeks of power,
showing all the signs of tyranny. The poet
suggests that the lords who had dislodged
him could only follow suit -- now that they
had forced the abdication of their annointed
Queen, and imprisoned her on an island
fortress.

By 'the very same', the poet is stating
that the Queen herself is seen as a whore.
That was the common opinion throughout
Scotland. The newly imprisoned Mary
had been obliged to look out on banners
displaying 'The Hare and the Mermaid' --
emblems of Bothwell, and of her as a
prostitute.

4. And that unfaire which fairely doth excell:

The Queen surrended to the Scottish lords
on Carberry Hill on June 15, 1567. Her
treatment by them, and the abuse from
the mobs as she was lead into Edinburgh
rendered her quite distraught. She lost
all self-control and was seen by the mob
leaning out of a window in Edinburgh
looking 'unfaire'. (See quote below).

While she had been herself, no one
questioned that she excelled all others
in 'fairness'. She had been 'belle et plus
que belle' of Ronsard's poetry.

The poet is also playing on 'unfaire' (and
on 'fairely) in the sense of 'unjust'. Mary
may have been foolish in getting married
to Darnley, and was far too docile after
his murder, letting herself be manipulated
by Bothwell and the lairds, but she was
quite ill at the time. However, there was
little that was fair in the treatment she
received.

5. For never resting time leads Summer on,

After the arrival in Scotland of Darnley
in early 1565, events had begun to move
with startling speed, accelerating to a
bewildering pace in the first six months
of 1567.

By 'Summer' the poet means Darnley,
punning on 'somer' from the Old French
for 'a long thin pole' (see OED). He has
played on this conceit in several sonnets
already.

6. To hidious winter and confounds him there,

Darnley had been lead into the 'hidious
winter' of Scottish politics, not taking long
to meet the fate predicted for him by those
with good knowledge of that distressed
country. The poet personalises 'hidious
winter' as Lord Ruthven, whom we have
already met as 'Rough winds' in Sonnet 18
('ruth-ven' being a macaronic pun on 'rough
winds'). The poet regards this person as
the epitome of the Scottish laird and
emblematic of 'winter' in that land. He was
believed to be a warlock (a male witch),
and was the leading murderer of Riccio.
He died soon after that, but his son and
heir was much the same, and is thought
to have had a major role in the murder of
Darnley. We meet this particular 'winter'
again in line 13.

7. Sap checkt with frost and lustie leav's quite gon.

Everyone agreed that Darnley was a 'sap'.
(The OED says it's short for 'sapskull'
or 'sap-head', first recorded in 1735; &quot;a
simpleton, a fool.&quot;) After their brief period
of infatuation he had encountered 'frost'
from the Queen; and queens can check
kings (in life as well as in chess). The
poet puns on 'leav' / 'leave' referring to
Darnley's frequent leave-taking, on his
drunken, licentious escapades, and from
the responsibilities of government
generally.

8. Beauty ore-snow'd and barenes every where,

'Beauty' refers to Mary QS. &quot;Ore-snow'd&quot;
is a pun on &quot;whores-No'd&quot; -- and to the
shouts of condemnation against her on
her surrender to the lairds. The 'bareness
everywhere' is mainly that which she
exposed to the Edinburgh mob in her
distress.

There is also a pun on 'barrenness' /
'barenes' (the OED shows the latter as a
16C spelling of the former). There was
now no possibility of further royal infants
in Scotland; and the English Queen, as
ever, shows no real sign of marrying.

9. Then were not summers distillation left

The poet brings in 'distillation' partly as
an allusion to his Scottish theme. The
Celts had long been known for their
distillation of whisky.

Here 'summers distillation' refers to
Darnley's offspring: the future James I
and VI.

10. A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glasse,

The infant James is, in effect, a prisoner
of the Scottish lairds at this time -- and
must expect to remain so until adulthood.
He is being kept in royal palaces which,
in the building fashions of the extremely
rich of the day, often had 'walls of glass'.
Richmond palace was especially known
for its 'wall of glass'.

'Liquid' is probably meant in OED sense
1c: &quot;filled with tears&quot;; and also in OED
sense 4 (now obsolete): &quot;clear, evident,
manifest&quot;.

11. Beauties effect with beauty were bereft,

The poet says that if James had not
been born (line 9), Mary would have no
influence with Elizabeth. The English
would allow the Scottish lairds to do
whatever they wished with Mary.
But since James is, in effect, heir to
the English throne, Elizabeth has to be
concerned that his mother is not too
grossly mistreated.

Likewise, if James had not been born,
Mary's claim to the English throne
would have been forgotten. But she
knows that James's claim (if he survives)
will be strong. However she has to keep
good relations with Elizabeth to minimise
the obstacles.

'Bereft' is the right word. It seems likely
that Mary will have little contact with
her infant son as he grows to maturity.
And, of course, if he dies, the political
situation will be as though he had never
existed.

12. Nor it nor noe remembrance what it was.

If James had not been born, this awful
episode involving Darnley and Mary QS,
would not have mattered much to the
English. They would have sought to
forget it all.

(I am sure I am missing something of
signficance in this line. 'Remembrance'
must have some particular resonance.)

13. But flowers distil'd though they with winter meete,

By &quot;flowers distil'd&quot; the poet refers to the
'fleurs de luce' of France (i.e. French royalty)
when transposed to Scotland. When that
meets with the harsh Scottish climate and
its rougher people, little of its culture, or
sophistication is transferred. Its show is
almost 'hired'.

Mary's chief gaoler during her first weeks
on Lochleven was Lord Ruthven; the poet
is making a particular point about their
'meeting'.

&quot;Bedford heard about three weeks later that her health was
improving. With the return of her strength, some of her
personal magnetism seemed also to be exerting itself, since
Lord Ruthven, son of that Lord Ruthven who had appeared
like a vengeful ghost at the murder of Riccio, was considered
by his colleagues to be falling under her spell, and was
removed from his post. According to the queen's ...

-------------------------------------------------------------
The Real Ada: Countess of Lovelace
By Carol L. James and Duncan E. Morrill

&lt;&lt;It was becoming embarrassing. The Department of
Defense had been working for some years on the
development of the high-order language to program its
embedded computers, but the language had no official
name -- only informal designations like DoD-1, which no
one in the High Order Language Working Group favored.

Finally, in May 1979 Commander John D. Cooper,
the Navy's HOLWG member came up with the name Ada,
to honor of an obscure but talented mathematician,
Ada, Countess of Lovelace. Ada Lovelace had worked
with Charles Babbage on his 1840 mechanical computer
the analytical engine.

Ada's father was the poet Lord Byron who, while still a
bachelor, underwent an experience that was to have
profound effects upon his only legitimate child, born
Augusta Ada Byron. At 25, he fell in love with his
married half sister, Augusta Leigh; and to deny that an
incestuous relationship existed between them is to ignore
an overwhelming body of evidence, although his paternity
of her daughter Elizabeth Medora Leigh, born in 1814, is
less certain. In January 1815, Byron married Annabella
Milbanke, a puritanical young woman of good family
and an amateur mathematician. Unfortunately, their
personalities were incompatible, and a few weeks after
Augusta Ada was born (December 10, 1815), the couple
separated. Shortly afterward, rumors concerning Byron's
previous affair with Augusta destroyed his reputation and
social acceptability, forcing him to take up permanent
residence on the Continent. However, subsequent letters
and much of his poetry show tender concern for the child
he never saw again. He died at 36, eight years after her
birth.

Lady Byron resolved to bring up her daughter (now called
Ada, for obvious reasons) to be as unlike Byron as
possibly. Setting herself up as a paragon while hinting
of unspeakable evil in her husband's character, she
encouraged Ada's mathematical talent but discouraged
any traits that reminded her of Byron.

When Ada was about 14, she suffered a severe paralytic
illness -- possibly of psychosomatic origin. Unable to
walk for almost three years, she pursued the mathematical
studies she loved and became an accomplished musician
and linguist. Like most young ladies of her social class,
she was taught by tutors -- some of whom were eminent
scientists and mathematicians, such as Augustus De
Morgan, a family friend.

At 19, Ada married William King (created Lord Lovelace
three years later). Her mother became the dominant and
domineering figure in the marriage, forming a kind of
ruling partnership with Ada's husband -- the covert
reason being that Ada -- whose mercurial Byronic
temperament they wished to control -- must be kept busy
and out of mischief. Together they freed Ada from many
of the usual feminine social and family responsibilities
so that she would have time to carve out a mathematical
and scientific career.

After the birth of her third child, (when she was 29),
Ada began to suffer both a physical &amp; mental breakdown.
Because she was subject to frequent digestive
and breathing problems, her doctor advised her to use
various dangerous combinations of brandy, wine, beer,
opium, and morphine, which led to serious personality
disorders, including delusions to the effect that her
mind -- admittedly brilliant -- could comprehend the
secrets of the universe.

After some years, she came to recognize that drugs were
disastrous to her equilibrium and managed to shake off the
addiction through sheer will power -- only to fall victim
to a new obsession: horse race gambling. Since highborn
ladies did not deal directly with bookmakers, she used
a servant and Babbage as go-betweens. Unbeknownst to
Babbage at first, she ran into catastrophic debt, pawned
family jewels, and became the target of blackmailers who
threatened public exposure. Her husband, when he learned
of her difficulties, stood by her; but consequent family
squabbles among Ada, Lord Lovelace, and Ada's mother
brought permanent estrangement on all sides.

To add to her torment, Ada was suffering from internal
cancer, to which she succumbed in 1852 at the age of 36.
She was buried, at her request, beside Lord Byron
in the Byron family vault.&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Those fine eyes that everybody looks at

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wonder if restricting &quot;gaze&quot; to &quot;eyes&quot; isn't a bit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;too narrow? Couldn't &quot;lovely gaze&quot; be understood in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sense of &quot;lovely sight&quot;, encompassing something larger than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;just the eyes?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Only if we can understand 'gaze' to mean not the looking, but the
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing looked at. Can we really do that? As I see it, no. 'Gaze' is
&gt;&gt;&gt; different from 'view'. So 'gaze' has to mean 'looking', reasonably
&gt;&gt;&gt; extended to 'the eyes that look'. I gave a couple of examples of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's referring to the addressee's eyes.

&gt;&gt;&quot;View&quot; can be both a noun and a verb, and it's typical of Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; to turn a verb that is usually found as a verb into a noun. I
&gt;&gt; interpret &quot;lovely gaze&quot; to mean &quot;lovely view&quot; as a noun, a view
&gt;&gt; that &quot;every eye&quot; dwells upon, and which was framed by &quot;those hours&quot;.
&gt;&gt; In other words, the &quot;lovely gaze&quot; is the attractive appearance of
&gt;&gt; the addressee.

&gt;I thought that Shakespeare might be turning a verb into a noun
&gt;but that is only true relative to our own most common use of the
&gt;word &quot;gaze&quot;. Apparently &quot;gaze&quot; as a noun was common in his time,
&gt;and that is the first definition given by the OED, and
&gt;among others use Shakespeare's example from Sonnet 5:

&gt;1. That which is gazed or stared at.
&gt;1542 UDALL Erasm. Apophth. 25 But this wise manne thought better
&gt;to shewe of hymself an example of paciente suffreaunce, than

The lovely gaze where eVERy eye doth dwell

And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
For neVER-resting time leads summer on
To hideous winter and confounds him there,
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
Beauty oVER-snowed and bareness eVERy where:
Then were not summer's distillation left
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of GLASS,
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,
Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.

Or if Debate by Mars were lost a space,
It might be found within the self-same place;
If Neptune's waves were all dried up and gone,
My weeping eyes so many tears distill,
That greater Seas might grow by them alone;
Or if no flame were yet remaining still
In Vulcan's forge, he might from out my breast
Make choice of such as should befit him best.
If Aeole were depriv'd of all his charge,
Yet soon could I restore his winds again,
By sobbing sighs, which forth I blow at large,
To move her mind that pleasures in my pain;
What man but I could thus incline his will
To live in Love, which hath no end of ill?
These fierce incessant waves that stream along my face,
Which show the certain proof of my neVER ceasing pains,
Fair Phillis, are no tears that trickle from my brains;
For why? Such streams of ruth within me find no place.
These floods that wet my cheeks are gathered from from thy grace
And thy perfections, and from hundred thousand flowers
Which from thy beauties spring; whereto I medley showers
Of rose and lilies too, the colours of thy face.
My love doth serve for fire, my heart the furnace is,
The aperries of my sighs augment the burning flame,
The limbec is mine eye that doth distil the same;
And by how much my fire is violent and sly,
By so much doth it cause the waters mount on high,
That shower from out mine eyes, for to assuage my miss.
I do compare unto thy youthly clear,
Which always bides within thy flow'ring prime,
The month of April, that bedews our clime
With pleasant flowers, when as his showers appear.
Before thy face shall fly false cruelty,
Before his face the doly season fleets;
Mild been his looks, thine eyes are full of sweets;
Firm is his course, firm is thy loyalty.
He paints the fields through liquid crystal showers,
Thou paint'st my VERse with Pallas' learnèd flowers;
With Zephirus' sweet breath he fills the plains,
And thou my heart with weeping sighs dost wring;
His brows are dewed with morning's crystal spring,
Thou mak'st my eyes with tears bemoan my pain.
The crystal stream, wherein my Love did swim,
Melted in tears, as partners of my woe;
Her shine was such as did the fountain dim,
The pearl-like fountain, whiter than the snow.
Then, like perfume resolvèd with a heat,
The fountain smoked, as if it thought to burn.
A wonder strange to see the cold so great,
And yet the fountain into smoke to turn.
I searched the cause, and found it to be this:
She touched the water, and it burnt with love.
Now, by her means it purchased hath that bliss
Which all diseases quickly can remove.
Then if by you these streams thus blessèd be:
Sweet, grant me love; and be not WORSE to me!
Youth's wanton SPRING, when in the raging Bull
My sun was lodged, gave store of flowers,
With leaves of pleasure, stalks of hours;
Which soon shaked off the leaves, when they were full
Of pleasures, beauty dewed with April showers.
My summer love, whose buds were beautiful,
Youthful desires, with heats unmerciful
Parched; whose seeds, when harvest time was come,
Were cares, against my suits obdurate.
With sheaves of corn bound up, which benumb
Mine heart with grief; yet made her heart indurate.
O chaste desires, which held her heart immurate
In walls of adamant unfoiled !
My Winter spent in showers of sorrow's tears !
Hailstones of hatred ! Frosts of fears !
My branches bared of pleasure, and despoiled !
These sorrowing sighs, the smokes of mine annoy;
These tears, which heat of sacred flame distills;
Are these due tributes that my faith doth pay
Unto the tyrant whose kindness kills.
I sacrifice my youth and blooming years
At her proud feet, and she respects it not;
My flower untimely's wither'd with my tears
And winter woes, for SPRING of youth unfit.
She thinks a look may recompence my care,
And so with looks prolongs my long-lookt ease;
As short that bliss, so is the comfort rare,
Yet must that bliss my hungry thoughts appease.
Thus she returns my hopes so fruitless eVER;
Once let her love indeed, or eye me neVER.
Look Delia how we steem the half-blown Rose,
The image of thy blush and Summer's honor:
Whilst in her tender GREEN she doth enclose
That pure sweet beautie, Time bestows upon her.
No sooner spreads her glorie in the air,
But straight her full-blown pride is in declining;
She then is scorn'd that late adorn'd the fair:
So clouds thy beauty, after fairest shining.
No April can revive thy withred flowers,
Whose blooming grace adorns thy glory now:
Swift speedy Time, feathred with flying hours,
Dissolves the beauty of the fairest brow.
O let not then such riches waste in vain;
But love whilst that thou mayst be lov'd again.
When Winter snows upon thy golden hairs,
And frost of age hath nipt thy flowers near,
When dark shall seem thy day that neVER clears,
And all lies wither'd that was held so dear,
Then take this picture which I here present thee,
Limn'd with a pencil not all unworthy:
Here see the gifts that God and Nature lent thee;
Here read thy self, and what I suffer'd for thee.
This may remain thy lasting monument,
Which happily posterity may cherish;
These colors with thy fading are not spent;
These may remain, when thou and I shall perish.
If they remain, then thou shalt live thereby;
They will remain, and so thou canst not die.
Weep now no more, mine eyes; but be you drowned
In your own tears, so many years distilled !
And let her know, that at them long hath frowned,
That you can weep no more, although She willed.
This hap her cruelty hath her allotten,
Who whilom was Comandress of each part;
That, now, her proper griefs must be forgotten,
By those TRUe outward signs of inward smart.
For how can he, that hath not one tear left him,
Stream out those floods that're due unto her moaning;
When both of eyes and tears She hath bereft him ?
O yet I'll signify my grief with groaning !
TRUe sighs, TRUe groans shall echo in the air
And say, &quot;FIDESSA, though most cruel, is most fair !&quot;

Some additional points -- of which a couple

substantial and important in that I have
established the force of line 12, and its
sense of 'remembrance'.

&gt; 5. For never resting time leads Summer on,

&gt; After the arrival in Scotland of Darnley
&gt; in early 1565, events had begun to move
&gt; with startling speed, accelerating to a
&gt; bewildering pace in the first six months
&gt; of 1567.

&gt; By 'Summer' the poet means Darnley,
&gt; punning on 'somer' from the Old French
&gt; for 'a long thin pole' (see OED). He has
&gt; played on this conceit in several sonnets
&gt; already.

"/>

The poet plays on 'rest' -- a key word to
him, suggesting a erect penis. The sense
probably derives from the use of lances
in tournaments (in which he was very
active) which were placed on 'rests' so
that they could point forward. He implies
that Darnley was lead into Scotland by
his erect penis.

Rubenstein has much on the term, with
examples from the Comedy of Errors
(iv.iii.25-33), LLL (v.ii.831), and R&amp;J:

&quot; 'REST' . . . Erect penis in its desired place of rest. A lance
in rest is erect, in the loop that keeps it in position for the
charge: 'And when I charge, my lance [penis - F&amp;H; P] in
rest,/ I triumph in delight' (F&amp;H, s.v. Lance, 1622). Dekker,
The Comedy of Old Fortunatus, iv.i: 'set your heart at rest,
for I have set up my rest . . . . I could get a young king or
two. . . of you'. He has set up his rest to beget a child . . .

RJ, IV.v.6, Nurse: 'Sleep for a week; for the next night,
I warrant,/ The County Paris hath set up his rest,/ That you
shall rest but little.' . . &quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 6. To hidious winter and confounds him there,

&gt; Darnley had been lead into the 'hidious
&gt; winter' of Scottish politics, not taking long
&gt; to meet the fate predicted for him by those
&gt; with good knowledge of that distressed
&gt; country.

"/>

The main sense to 'confounds' concerns
Darnley's sexual frustration and confusion
when Mary rejected him, both before and
after the murder of Riccio. But his total
defeat at the hands of the lairds, and his
confusion over religion are also suggested.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 7. Sap checkt with frost and lustie leav's quite gon.

&gt; Everyone agreed that Darnley was a 'sap'.
&gt; (The OED says it's short for 'sapskull'
&gt; or 'sap-head', first recorded in 1735; &quot;a
&gt; simpleton, a fool.&quot;) After their brief period
&gt; of infatuation he had encountered 'frost'
&gt; from the Queen; and queens can check
&gt; kings (in life as well as in chess). The
&gt; poet puns on 'leav' / 'leave' referring to
&gt; Darnley's frequent leave-taking, on his
&gt; drunken, licentious escapades, and from
&gt; the responsibilities of government
&gt; generally.

"/>

There is more in &quot;leav's&quot; (or &quot;leau's&quot;)
than I stated above. Lynne's suggestion
of &quot;leau&quot; = &quot;l'eau&quot; (French for water) is
possible, with a further extension to 'drip'
-- as a description of Darnley. But more is
necessary. He may have been called 'Lou'
at sometime, possibly from his expertise
with the lute:

&quot;Queen Mary's gift of Edward VI's lutes was well chosen, for Darnley
was later acknowledged as an expert lutenist . . &quot;
(Caroline Bingham, *Darnley*, page 60)

The description of Darnley as 'lusty' may
come from a famous conversation with
Elizabeth, when Melville used it in a non-
sexual sense (fit, pleasing):

&quot;The gesture [tickling Dudley at the point where he knelt
before her to be ennobled as Lord Leicester] which obviously
shocked Melville was perhaps less an impulse of affection
than a humiliating reminder to a proud and ambitious man
that his status was wholly dependent on her favour.
To underline the message, with Leicester still on his knees,
the Queen turned to Melville:
'Then she asked me how I liked him. I answered that as
he was a worthy subject, so he was happy who had a
princess who could discern and reward good services.
'Yet' she said 'you like better of yonder long lad',
pointing towards my Lord Darnley, who, as nearest
prince of the blood, did bear the sword of honour that
day before her. My answer was that no woman of spirit
would make choice of such a man; for he was very lusty
beardless and lady-faced'. . . &quot;
(Caroline Bingham, *Darnley*, page 85)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 8. Beauty ore-snow'd and barenes every where,

&gt; 'Beauty' refers to Mary QS. &quot;Ore-snow'd&quot;
&gt; is a pun on &quot;whores-No'd&quot; -- and to the
&gt; shouts of condemnation against her on
&gt; her surrender to the lairds. The 'bareness
&gt; everywhere' is mainly that which she
&gt; exposed to the Edinburgh mob in her
&gt; distress.

&gt; There is also a pun on 'barrenness' /
&gt; 'barenes' (the OED shows the latter as a
&gt; 16C spelling of the former). There was
&gt; now no possibility of further royal infants
&gt; in Scotland; and the English Queen, as
&gt; ever, shows no real sign of marrying.

"/>

The poet is also alluding to the extreme
barrenness of the Scottish countryside
at the time:

&quot;Surprising as it may seem to later travellers, Scotland was on
the whole a treeless country in the sixteenth century . . . when
Sir Anthony Weldon visited Scotland with James VI in 1617,
he wrote that Judas himself could not have found a tree on which
to hang himself. Scotland was also dissected to a far greater extent
than at the present day by endless and immense watery tracts in
the shape of countless lochs and lochans, many of which have
now disappeared . . . . a series of exceptionally cold winters and
stormy wet summers, and a sharp decline in the entire pattern of
Scottish weather after 1560. The fact that 1563 and 1564 saw
winters of outstanding severity with great loss of stock, 1565 an
appalling harvest, and 1567 another unremittingly wet harvest time . &quot;

&gt; 11. Beauties effect with beauty were bereft,

&gt; If James had not been born, this awful
&gt; episode involving Darnley and Mary QS,
&gt; would not have mattered much to the
&gt; English. They would have sought to
&gt; forget it all.

&gt; (I am sure I am missing something of
&gt; signficance in this line. 'Remembrance'
&gt; must have some particular resonance.)

"/>

An allusion here is very obvious to all
who know their Catholic faith. See:

or   which states:
&quot;Essentially the Mass in Catholic teaching and belief is the renewal
of the Last Supper. This renewal, Catholics believe, was expressly
commanded by the Lord when He said: &quot;Do this in remembrance of
me&quot; (Luke 22:19) . . . .
THE MIRACLE OF TRANSUBSTANTIATION
Taking the words of the Lord in their literal and obvious sense we
Catholics believe that by the power of God the Lord Jesus becomes
really and substantially but sacramentally present under the outward
appearance of bread and wine. This miracle we call transubstantiation.
It takes place every time a duly ordained priest of the Church
pronounces the words which the Lord taught and commanded at the
Last Supper when He said: &quot;Do this in remembrance of me.&quot; . . . &quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 12. Nor it nor noe remembrance what it was.

"/>

The ritual is also echoed in the last three words
of the line: &quot; . . what it was.&quot; which are an ironic
play on those in the Mass: &quot;This IS my body . .
This IS my blood . .&quot;. The same website states:

&quot;Catholics further believe that the Mass, or the Lord's Supper, is the
re-presentation of the sacrifice of Jesus on Calvary. This belief is based
on the words of the Lord: &quot;This is my body which is given for you . . .
This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood&quot;
(Luke 22:19-20). St. Matthew further quotes the Lord at the Last Supper
to this effect: &quot;This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out
for many for the forgiveness of sins&quot; (Matt. 26:28) .
. . . .
But it is more than a memorial. A memorial is usually a lifeless picture,
statue, or some such reminder of a dear friend, or an historically important
event. In the Lord's Supper there is no mere lifeless reminder or statue.
If we take His words at their face value, there is truly present the living
reality, the body and blood, the soul and the divinity of the Savior.
&quot;This IS my body.&quot;&quot;This IS my blood of the covenant.&quot;

The poet is essentially saying that religion
is no longer what it was -- not in England nor
in Scotland. Consequently -- in the absence
of the infant James -- Mary's Catholicism
would be entirely irrelevant to Elizabeth and
to her nation. But, given his existence, it
still had significance. The Church and the
continental powers would retain a hope for
the re-conversion of England.

There may also be a pun on 're-member' in
a similar manner to that in Sonnet 3. Royalty
renewed itself by reproduction (hopefully
with suitable partners) producing new
members. It &quot;re-membered&quot; itself. Here the
poet says that recent &quot;re-membering&quot; is not
of the quality that it used to be. The Guise
side of Mary's inheritance and Darnley's
Lennox inheritance had produced
disastrously bad results. Elizabeth and the
English nobility should not expect much
from the result of ...

&gt; re-presentation of the sacrifice of Jesus on Calvary. This belief is based
&gt; on the words of the Lord: &quot;This is my body which is given for you . . .
&gt; This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood&quot;
&gt; (Luke 22:19-20). St. Matthew further quotes the Lord at the Last Supper
&gt; to this effect: &quot;This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out
&gt; for many for the forgiveness of sins&quot; (Matt. 26:28) .
&gt; . . . .
&gt; But it is more than a memorial. A memorial is usually a lifeless picture,
&gt; statue, or some such reminder of a dear friend, or an historically important
&gt; event. In the Lord's Supper there is no mere lifeless reminder or statue.
&gt; If we take His words at their face value, there is truly present the living
&gt; reality, the body and blood, the soul and the divinity of the Savior.
&gt;&quot;This IS my body.&quot;&quot;This IS my blood of the covenant.&quot;

&gt; The poet is essentially saying that religion
&gt; is no longer what it was -- not in England nor
&gt; in Scotland. Consequently -- in the absence
&gt; of the infant James -- Mary's Catholicism
&gt; would be entirely irrelevant to Elizabeth and
&gt; to her nation. But, given his existence, it
&gt; still had significance. The

&gt;&gt;&gt; 13. But flowers distil'd though they with winter meete,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 14. Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.

&gt;&gt; Some additional points -- of which a couple
&gt;&gt; are minor or uncertain. However, one is
&gt;&gt; substantial and important in that I have
&gt;&gt; established the force of line 12, and its
&gt;&gt; sense of 'remembrance'.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. For never resting time leads Summer on,

&gt;&gt;&gt; After the arrival in Scotland of Darnley
&gt;&gt;&gt; in early 1565, events had begun to move
&gt;&gt;&gt; with startling speed, accelerating to a
&gt;&gt;&gt; bewildering pace in the first six months
&gt;&gt;&gt; of 1567.

&gt;&gt;&gt; By 'Summer' the poet means Darnley,
&gt;&gt;&gt; punning on 'somer' from the Old French
&gt;&gt;&gt; for 'a long thin pole' (see OED). He has
&gt;&gt;&gt; played on this conceit in several sonnets
&gt;&gt;&gt; already.

&gt;&gt; The poet plays on 'rest' -- a key word to
&gt;&gt; him, suggesting a erect penis. The sense
&gt;&gt; probably derives from the use of lances
&gt;&gt; in tournaments (in which he was very
&gt;&gt; active) which were placed on 'rests' so
&gt;&gt; that they could point forward. He implies
&gt;&gt; that Darnley was lead into Scotland by
&gt;&gt; his erect penis.

&gt;&gt; Rubenstein has much on the term, with
&gt;&gt; examples from the Comedy of Errors
&gt;&gt; (iv.iii.25-33), LLL (v.ii.831), and R&amp;J:

&gt;&gt;&quot; 'REST' . . . Erect penis in its desired place of rest. A lance
&gt;&gt; in rest is erect, in the loop that keeps it in position for the
&gt;&gt; charge: 'And when I charge, my lance [penis - F&amp;H; P] in
&gt;&gt; rest,/ I triumph in delight' (F&amp;H, s.v. Lance, 1622). Dekker,
&gt;&gt; The Comedy of Old Fortunatus, iv.i: 'set your heart at rest,
&gt;&gt; for I have set up my rest . . . . I could get a young king or
&gt;&gt; two. . . of you'. He has set up his rest to beget a child . . .

&gt;&gt; RJ, IV.v.6, Nurse: 'Sleep for a week; for the next night,
&gt;&gt; I warrant,/ The County Paris hath set up his rest,/ That you
&gt;&gt; shall rest but little.' . . &quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; 6. To hidious winter and confounds him there,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Darnley had been lead into the 'hidious
&gt;&gt;&gt; winter' of Scottish politics, not taking long
&gt;&gt;&gt; to meet the fate predicted for him by those
&gt;&gt;&gt; with good knowledge of that distressed
&gt;&gt;&gt; country.

&gt;&gt; The main sense to 'confounds' concerns
&gt;&gt; Darnley's sexual frustration and confusion
&gt;&gt; when Mary rejected him, both before and
&gt;&gt; after the murder of Riccio. But his total
&gt;&gt; defeat at the hands of the lairds, and his
&gt;&gt; confusion over religion are also suggested.
&gt;&gt; [..]

&gt;&gt;&gt; 7. Sap checkt with frost and lustie leav's quite gon.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Everyone agreed that Darnley was a 'sap'.
&gt;&gt;&gt; (The OED says it's short for 'sapskull'
&gt;&gt;&gt; or 'sap-head', first recorded in 1735; &quot;a
&gt;&gt;&gt; simpleton, a fool.&quot;) After their brief period
&gt;&gt;&gt; of infatuation he had encountered 'frost'
&gt;&gt;&gt; from the Queen; and queens can check
&gt;&gt;&gt; kings (in life as well as in chess). The
&gt;&gt;&gt; poet puns on 'leav' / 'leave' referring to
&gt;&gt;&gt; Darnley's frequent leave-taking, on his
&gt;&gt;&gt; drunken, licentious escapades, and from
&gt;&gt;&gt; the responsibilities of government
&gt;&gt;&gt; generally.

&gt;&gt; There is more in &quot;leav's&quot; (or &quot;leau's&quot;)
&gt;&gt; than I stated above. Lynne's suggestion
&gt;&gt; of &quot;leau&quot; = &quot;l'eau&quot; (French for water) is
&gt;&gt; possible, with a further extension to 'drip'
&gt;&gt; -- as a description of Darnley. But more is
&gt;&gt; necessary. He may have been called 'Lou'
&gt;&gt; at sometime, possibly from his expertise
&gt;&gt; with the lute:

&gt;&gt;&quot;Queen Mary's gift of Edward VI's lutes was well chosen, for Darnley
&gt;&gt; was later acknowledged as an expert lutenist . . &quot;
&gt;&gt; (Caroline Bingham, *Darnley*, page 60)

&gt;&gt; The description of Darnley as 'lusty' may
&gt;&gt; come from a famous conversation with
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth, when Melville used it in a non-
&gt;&gt; sexual sense (fit, pleasing):

&gt;&gt;&quot;The gesture [tickling Dudley at the point where he knelt
&gt;&gt; before her to be ennobled as Lord Leicester] which obviously
&gt;&gt; shocked Melville was perhaps less an impulse of affection
&gt;&gt; than a humiliating reminder to a proud and ambitious man
&gt;&gt; that his status was wholly dependent on her favour.
&gt;&gt; To underline the message, with Leicester still on his knees,
&gt;&gt; the Queen turned to Melville:
&gt;&gt; 'Then she asked me how I liked him. I answered that as
&gt;&gt; he was a worthy subject, so he was happy who had a
&gt;&gt; princess who could discern and reward good services.
&gt;&gt; 'Yet' she said 'you like better of yonder long lad',
&gt;&gt; pointing towards my Lord Darnley, who, as nearest
&gt;&gt; prince of the blood, did bear the sword of honour that
&gt;&gt; day before her. My answer was that no woman of spirit
&gt;&gt; would make choice of such a man; for he was very lusty
&gt;&gt; beardless and lady-faced'. . . &quot;
&gt;&gt; (Caroline Bingham, *Darnley*, page 85)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 8. Beauty ore-snow'd and barenes every where,

&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Beauty' refers to Mary QS. &quot;Ore-snow'd&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; is a pun on &quot;whores-No'd&quot; -- and to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; shouts of condemnation against her on
&gt;&gt;&gt; her surrender to the lairds. The 'bareness
&gt;&gt;&gt; everywhere' is mainly that which she
&gt;&gt;&gt; exposed to the Edinburgh mob in her
&gt;&gt;&gt; distress.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is also a pun on 'barrenness' /
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'barenes' (the OED shows the latter as a
&gt;&gt;&gt; 16C spelling of the former). There was
&gt;&gt;&gt; now no possibility of further royal infants
&gt;&gt;&gt; in Scotland; and the English Queen, as
&gt;&gt;&gt; ever, shows no real sign of marrying.

&gt;&gt; The poet is also alluding to the extreme
&gt;&gt; barrenness of the Scottish countryside
&gt;&gt; at the time:

&gt;&gt;&quot;Surprising as it may seem to later travellers, Scotland was on
&gt;&gt; the whole a treeless country in the sixteenth century . . . when
&gt;&gt; Sir Anthony Weldon visited Scotland with James VI in 1617,
&gt;&gt; he wrote that Judas himself could not have found a tree on which
&gt;&gt; to hang himself. Scotland was also dissected to a far greater extent
&gt;&gt; than at the present day by endless and immense watery tracts in
&gt;&gt; the shape of countless lochs and lochans, many of which have
&gt;&gt; now disappeared . . . . a series of exceptionally cold winters and
&gt;&gt; stormy wet summers, and a sharp decline in the entire pattern of
&gt;&gt; Scottish weather after 1560. The fact that 1563 and 1564 saw
&gt;&gt; winters of outstanding severity with great loss of stock, 1565 an
&gt;&gt; appalling harvest, and 1567 another unremittingly wet harvest time . &quot;
&gt;&gt; (Antonia Fraser, Mary QS, pages 141-2)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 9. Then were not summers distillation left
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10. A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glasse,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 11. Beauties effect with beauty were bereft,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 12. Nor it nor noe remembrance what it was.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If James had not been born, this awful
&gt;&gt;&gt; episode involving Darnley and Mary QS,
&gt;&gt;&gt; would not have mattered much to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; English. They would have sought to
&gt;&gt;&gt; forget it all.

&gt;&gt;&gt; (I am sure I am missing something of
&gt;&gt;&gt; signficance in this line. 'Remembrance'
&gt;&gt;&gt; must have some particular resonance.)

&gt;&gt; An allusion here is very obvious to all
&gt;&gt; who know their Catholic faith. See:

&gt;&gt; http://www.saintaugustinechurch.org/university/mass.html
&gt;&gt; http://www.catholic-jhb.org.za/tracts/tract_11.htm

&gt;&gt; or  http://www.cin.org/kc36-4.html  which states:
&gt;&gt;&quot;Essentially the Mass in Catholic teaching and belief is the renewal
&gt;&gt; of the Last Supper. This renewal, Catholics believe, was expressly
&gt;&gt; commanded by the Lord when He said: &quot;Do this in remembrance of
&gt;&gt; me&quot; (Luke 22:19) . . . .
&gt;&gt; THE MIRACLE OF TRANSUBSTANTIATION
&gt;&gt; Taking the words of the Lord in their literal and obvious sense we
&gt;&gt; Catholics believe that by the power of God the Lord Jesus becomes
&gt;&gt; really and substantially but sacramentally present under the outward
&gt;&gt; appearance of bread and wine. This miracle we call transubstantiation.
&gt;&gt; It takes place every time a duly ordained priest of the Church
&gt;&gt; pronounces the words which the Lord taught and commanded at the
&gt;&gt; Last Supper when He said: &quot;Do this in remembrance of me.&quot; . . . &quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 12. Nor it nor noe remembrance what it was.

&gt;&gt; The ritual is also echoed in the last three words
&gt;&gt; of the line: &quot; . . what it was.&quot; which are an ironic
&gt;&gt; play on those in the Mass: &quot;This IS my body . .
&gt;&gt; This IS my blood . .&quot;. The same website states:

&gt;&gt;&quot;Catholics further believe that the Mass, or the Lord's Supper, is the
&gt;&gt; re-presentation of the sacrifice of Jesus on Calvary. This belief is
based
&gt;&gt; on the words of the Lord: &quot;This is my body which is given for you . . .
&gt;&gt; This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood&quot;
&gt;&gt; (Luke 22:19-20). St. Matthew further quotes the Lord at the Last Supper
&gt;&gt; to this effect: &quot;This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out
&gt;&gt; for many for the forgiveness of sins&quot; (Matt. 26:28) .
&gt;&gt; . . . .
&gt;&gt; But it is more than a memorial. A memorial is usually a lifeless
picture,
&gt;&gt; statue, or some such reminder of a dear friend, or an historically
important
