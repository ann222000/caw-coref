Hello, I'm a novice trying to learn to refine silver properly / safely and
never posted to this group.  Been working with an experienced gentlemen who
is not a chemist so thought this may be a more appropriate place to post.

Subject matter is the key ingredient for refining silver, Nitric Acid.  This
stuff is somewhat difficult to come by these days, can carry a hefty fee for
a "no questions asked" type of purchase and not something you necessarily
want setting around in the garage.  Today I came across a site that walks
you through the process of creating Nitric Acid from Sodium Nitrate and
Sulfuric Acid.  Both of these are easier to come by and (I would guess)
safer to store.  True?

The formula basically calls for mixing the Sodium Nitrate (1/2 c) in hot
distilled water (16 oz) then adding the Sulfuric Acid (1 qt).  The claim is
that this will result in a relatively weak but useful Nitric Acid solution.
True?  If so would anyone be able to approximate the percentage (I.e. 20%?).
The site goes on to say that you can distill the solution in much the same
way you would alcohol to create a stronger solution, the claim being a
result of 70%.  True?

I'm the type of person who tries to verify everything before trying
anything, especially working with acids.  Any feedback is appreciated.

Regards,

- Ben

If you want nitric acid strong enough to dissolve silver, you need to
distil the nitrate-sulfuric mixture. If you use the raw mixture, you
will form silver sulfate, which is only weakly soluble. On the other
hand, distilling nitric acid is not for the home chemist.

The point here is that you really need to get concentrated nitric acid
from somewhere. It can be bought if you can establish your bona fides,
for example, by forming a company for refining the silver. The first
step is to inquire of a supplier what steps you need to take to buy the
reagent.

Dissolving silver in nitric acid is also dangerous, since it produces
toxic NO2 gas. You can inhale a lethal amount of NO2 and not know it
for hours. You'll need a fume hood or other ventilation to protect
yourself from the nitric acid vapor and the NO2 gas.

Yes, you can distill nitric acid in this way. Howewer... As you know,
nitric acid is quite corrosive. So the still will need to be an all-glass
setup (or made from steel qualities you can't get), and have you considered
what will happen if something goes wrong?

Does it matter whether battery acid or drain opener is used?  Again, I'm

test is there any other simple way to verify relative percentage?

Yes I know this and plan to do so if this hobby ends up being pursued to any
significant degree.

Definately aware of this but thanks.  Other considerations are waste and
proper disposal.  This is VERY nasty stuff and as you know adding the wrong
samples to the mixture can result in bad things too.  This is why materials
will be tested prior to adding.  The intent is to create a small amount, say
100ml of the stuff by scaling down the proportions.  Just wanted to confirm
it was valid.

Thanks for the reply.

pH won't give you anything really usefull, you need to measure the spesific

You're not thinking of doing this, are you? The glassware alone will set
you back a good bit, and unless you are familiar with dangerous chemicals
and have a fume hood you're in over your head.

As for the temperature I really don't know, I've only distilled ~100%
nitric acid. I belive you only need to look for a sharp rise in
temperature around 70-90°C, it will stay fairly constant while the nitric
acid goes over and then quickly rise when water starts to come.

You can't get above 68% this way, nitric acid gives azeotrope with water,
that's why stock solutions have this concetration.

Azeotrope boils at about 120 deg C.

Sure you can, a mixture of equal parts 98% sulfuric and 65% nitric acid
will produce 100% nitric acid. But that's beside the point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You're absolutely right, I got the temperatures all wrong. This means
you'll distill off water first, then get a fast rise up to 120C when the NA
goes over.

What I meant was that you can't go over 68% with distillation, but you are
right - you can make more concentrated acid with other methods.

Yes you can, it's called extractive destillation. It uses eithher strong
sulfuric acid or magnesium nitrate to bind the water so no azeotrope forms.
Otherwise you are right, in an aqueous system the azeotrope prevents
consentrations over 68%.

For the intent here I think even 50% is plenty strong isn't it?  Going for
silver refinement which, as I understand the process, does not require
anything near 100% Nitric Acid.  I just wanted to verify the process and
proportions of combining Sodium Nitrate and Sulfuric Acid to come up with a
Nitric Acid solution suitable for use in this process.  I assure you all
this process won't be attempted until such time as proper equipment, safety
gear, location and contingency plans are in place.  In addition to this I'll
have some assistance from a person who does have experience working with
Nitric, just not creating Nitric.

We just ahve to understand the process in detail from start to finish and
any guidance you can give from your expertise is greatly apprecaited.  The
more fully I understand what is happening, or should be happening, the safer
this will be.

Once again thanks, very much appreciate the responses.
