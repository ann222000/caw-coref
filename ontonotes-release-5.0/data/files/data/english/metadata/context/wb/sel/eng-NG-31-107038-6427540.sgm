Preface

The purpose of this book is to give some account of the mythology of the
ancient Near East. During the last fifty years the labours of archaeologists
have revealed the rich stores of documents, tablets, and inscriptions buried
in the ruined sites of the ancient cities of Egypt, Sumer, Assyria,
Babylonia, Asia Minor, and Syria. The decipherment and translation of
cuneiform and Hittite texts have made available to students a new and
surprising amount of mythological material, throwing fresh light on the
whole field of myth. An attempt is here made to describe and give examples
of this new material. We have also ventured to offer a classification of
myths from the functional point of view. A discussion of the place of myth
in Christianity has been included in this study because of its direct
connexion with the use of myth in the religion of Israel.

Introduction

Since there is a considerable amount of ambiguity in the meaning and use of
the term 'myth', it is desirable that something should be said about its use
in this book. The usual distinction drawn between myth, legend, saga, folk
story, and Marchen is based upon literary criteria; a further current usage
distinguishes between myth and historical truth, with the implication that
anything which is characterized as a myth is unworthy of belief. The
criterion used in this study is neither literary, nor historical, but
functional. The myth is a product of human imagination arising out ,of a
definite situation and intended to do something. Hence the right question to
ask about the myth is not, 'Is it true?' but 'What is it intended to do?'

In studying the very varied mythological material yielded by the ancient
Near East, and using the notion of 'function' as a criterion, it is possible
to distinguish the following types of myth (Next Section).

-----------------------------------

Types Of Myth

The Ritual Myth

It is a well-established fact that most of the texts from which our
knowledge of the myths here described is taken have been found in temple
archives. They imply the existence in the river-valleys of the Nile and the
Tigris-Euphrates of a highly developed urban civilization resting on an
agricultural basis. These texts show that the dwellers in Egypt and
Mesopotamia had created an elaborate pattern of activities, to which we give
the name of ritual. These activities were carried on by large staffs of
priests in the temples. They constituted a system of actions performed in a
fixed way, at regular times, by authorized persons who possessed the
specialized knowledge of the correct way in which these actions should be
carried out. The whole elaborate pattern of activities was designed to
secure the well-being of the community by controlling the incalculable
forces by which man found himself surrounded. But we now know that the
ritual did not consist only of actions; the actions were accompanied by
spoken words, chants, and incantations, whose magical efficacy was an
essential part of the ritual. In other words, the ritual consisted of the
part which was done, which the Greeks called the dromenon, and the spoken
part, which they called the muthos, or myth. In the ritual the myth told the
story of what was being enacted; it described a situation; but the story was
not told to amuse an audience; it was a word of power. The repetition of the
magic words had power to bring about, or recreate, the situation which they
described. We shall see later that, at a central point in the Babylonian New
Year Festival, the priests recited the chant called Enuma elish, which was
the myth of Creation; and the recitation did something; it brought about a
change in the situation which the ritual was enacting.

Thus we may understand that in a society where such rituals formed an
essential part of the life of the community, the historical truth of the
story contained in the myth was irrelevant. The function of history is to
find out and to record as accurately as possible the behaviour of
communities in the past, i.e., to discover and impart a certain kind of
knowledge. The function of the myth was not knowledge but action, action
essential for the very existence of the community. Mankind has in the past
existed for vast periods of time without feeling any need for history; but,
long before the appearance of the earliest forms of historical records, the
myth had a vital function in the life of the community; as an essential part
of ritual it helped to secure, those conditions upon which the life of the
community depended.

This is why we have called this type of myth the ritual myth. It takes its
name from its function, which is to aid in securing the efficacy of the
ritual. It is possible that this was the earliest type of myth to come into
existence.

The Myth of Origin

This type of myth is more generally called the aetiological myth. This myth
is also very early; some scholars would regard it as the earliest. Its
function is to give an imaginary explanation of the origin of a custom, a
name, or even an object. For example, we shall see that the Sumerian myth of
Enlil and the Pickaxe is a story intended to explain how that most valuable
agricultural implement came into existence through the activity of a god.
Another example is the Hebrew myth of Jacob's conflict with a supernatural
being. This story offers an explanation of an ancient Israelite food-tabu.

The Cult Myth

In the development of the religion of Israel a new use of myth makes its
appearance. The three seasonal festivals prescribed in the Book of the
Covenant were celebrated at the various local shrines, such as Bethel,
Shechem, and Shiloh, during the early stages of Israel's settlement in
Canaan. Offerings were brought, and each of the festivals, Passover,
Pentecost or the Feast of Weeks, and Tabernacles, had its own special
ritual, preserved and carried out by the priests at the local shrines. On
these occasions an important part of the ritual consisted in the public
recitation by the priests of certain central events in the history of
Israel; the recitation was accompanied by antiphonal responses from the
people. One of the most deeply rooted traditions of Israel was that of the
deliverance of the people from Egyptian bondage. At the Feast of Passover
this event was celebrated with a ritual whose origin was far older than the
historical event thus commemorated. Accompanying the ritual was the cult
myth describing the event, not in historical terms, but in terms borrowed in
part from Babylonian and Canaanite-myth. The function of the cult myth was
to confirm the covenant relation between Yahweh and Israel, and to magnify
the power and glory of Yahweh. In this new use of the myth it was divested
of the magical potency which it had possessed in the ritual myth. We can see
the cult myth still further developed in the prophetic use of it as a means
of presenting the conception of 'salvation-history' to Israel. The myth
still describes a situation, and still has the function of securing the
continuance of the situation, no longer by magical, but by moral force. The
function of the myth has been lifted to a higher plane in the cult myth as
we see it employed by the prophets of Israel.

The Prestige Myth

There is a form of the myth, distinct from any of the foregoing, which calls
for notice. Its function is to invest the birth and exploits of a popular
hero with an aura of mystery and wonder. While the story of the birth and
exposure of Moses in an ark of bulrushes. on the Nile may ' rest upon
historical tradition, it can be paralleled by similar stories relating to
Sargon, Cyrus, Romulus and Remus, and other heroes of popular imagination.
The birth and exploits of the Danite hero, Samson, are related in mythical
terms intended to glorify the tribe of Dan and its hero. It may be remarked
in passing that the attempt to find a sun-myth in the story of Samson is
generally discredited. The stories of the exploits of Elijah and Elisha fall
into the same category, although in this case the motive of magnifying the
glory of Yahweh is also present. Prestige myths also tend to gather round
the names of famous cities. Troy is built by the hands of gods, and even
Zion is described in mythical terms borrowed from Babylonian and Canaanite
mythology as being built 'on the sides of the north', the expression used in
those myths to describe the abode of the gods.

The Eschatological Myth

Although it may owe something to the eschatology of Zoroastrianism, the
eschatological myth is specially characteristic of Jewish and Christian
thought. In the writings of the prophets, and above all in the apocalyptic
literature, the conception of a catastrophic end of the present world-order
has a prominent place. The prophets believed that the 'salvation-history'
must have its consummation in a decisive divine intervention. 'It shall come
to pass in the last days' is a characteristic phrase in the prophetic
vocabulary. When the prophets attempt to describe the final situation they
have to fall back on the language of myth. The description of the conquest
of the chaos-dragon by Marduk in the Babylonian Epic of Creation supplies
them with the imagery which they use to describe Yahweh's final victory over
the forces of evil. Just as the divine act of creation lies outside the
horizon of history and can only be described in the language of myth, so the
divine act that brings history to a close can only be described in the same
terms. The eschatological use of myth was carried over from Judaism into
Christianity and appears in its fullest display in the Apocalypse of St
John.

It may, perhaps, be necessary to say that the application of the category of
myth to the Gospel narratives is in no way intended to call in question
their essential historical veracity. But for those who believe, as the
prophets of Israel and the first disciples of Jesus did, that God has
entered into human history, there are certain moments in history when events
take place whose causes and nature lie beyond the range of historical
causation. Here the function of myth is to express in symbolical terms, by
means of images, what cannot be otherwise put into human speech. Here myth
has become an expansion of symbolism.

The Diffusion And Disintegration Of Myths

There are two ways in which the presence of myths in any society may be
explained; one is by way of diffusion, and the other is through the
independent working of imagination when confronted by similar situations.
Usener's researches have shown that the myth of the Flood is to be found in
almost every part of the world. We shall see when we come to deal with the
Sumerian and Babylonian forms of the Flood myth that its presence in the
region of the Tigris-Euphrates valley can be explained as due to the
periodical occurrence there of disastrous floods. But when we find the Flood
myth in countries where such floods are not possible, as in Greece or
Canaan, for instance, it becomes clear that the myth has been brought there
from the place of its origin, even if it is no longer possible to trace the
method of diffusion. An example of the way in which myths might travel from
their source is furnished by the discovery in Egypt of a cuneiform tablet
containing the Babylonian myth of Adapa, with which we shall deal later. The
tablet had been used by Egyptian scribes for the purpose of learning
cuneiform. A similar instance occurred when a fragment of the myth of
Gilgamesh was discovered during the American excavation of Megiddo. The
legend of Cadmus tells us how the Phoenician alphabet was carried to Greece
and became the parent of all our Western alphabets. Thus there are
reasonable grounds for assuming that travel, trade movements, migrations of
peoples, arid invasions were a means of diffusion by which myths might be
carried from one country to another.

It can be observed that rituals decayed and disappeared, or were transformed
with the decay of the civilization in which they had played such an
important part. Then we find that the myths attached to the decaying rituals
were freed from their ritual associations and became literary forms, passing
into the traditions of other peoples. For example, the myth of the slaying
of the dragon which is, as we shall see, a central element in the Babylonian
myth of Creation has given birth to the legends of Perseus and  Andromeda,
Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra, Siegfried and Fafnir, Beowulf and Grendel,
and still survives in the mummers' play of St George and the Dragon.

Mesopotamian Myths

Chapter 1

Before we begin to give an account of the most important myths which have
their origin in Mesopotamia, something should be said about the early
cultural conditions out of which the myths which we are to examine came into
existence in that part of the ancient Near East. Archaeological excavation
of the sites of the ancient cities in the Tigris-Euphrates valley has shown
that this region, known as Sumer and Akkad, was inhabited as early as 4,000
B.C. by a people known as the Sumerians. Some scholars are of the opinion
that there are traces of an earlier settlement but it is certain that the
fully developed civilization revealed by excavation of such sites as Ur,
Erech, and Kish was the work of the Sumerians. They appear to have come into
the delta from the mountainous region to the north-east of Mesopotamia, and
their myths show that they came from a very different kind of country from
that which they found in their new home. The form of writing called
cuneiform was their invention, and it was they who built the strange
temple-towers known as 'ziqqurats' which are such a characteristic feature
of their cities.

Their language was of the type known as agglutinative, and its linguistic
affiliations are uncertain. Their remains, as illustrated, for example, by
Sir Leonard Woolley's excavation of Ur, show a highly developed civilization
of an agricultural type, with splendid temples, priests, laws, literature,
and a rich mythology. At an early date, but probably later than the Sumerian
settlement of the delta of the Tigris-Euphrates, the first wave of Semitic
invasion entered the region of Sumer and Akkad, gradually conquered the
Sumerians, absorbed their culture, and adopted their cuneiform script, but
not their language. The language of the Semitic invaders is known as
Akkadian, and is one of the important branches of the great Semitic family
of languages of which Arabic is the ancestor. The second wave of Semitic
invasion by a people known as Amurru, or Amorites, resulted in the
foundation of the first Amorite dynasty in Babylon, and the rise of Babylon
under Hammurabi to the hegemony of Sumer and Akkad. The date of the first
king of the Amorite dynasty has been assigned to about 2200 B.C. About 500
years later another Semitic people who had settled higher up the Tigris
valley, between the upper and lower Zab, conquered Babylon and established
the first Assyrian empire in Mesopotamia. Hence the mythology of Mesopotamia
has come to us in Sumerian, Babylonian, and Assyrian forms, and while there
is little difference between the Babylonian and Assyrian forms of any
particular myth, there are very considerable differences between, for
example, the Sumerian and the Assyro-Babylonian form of the Creation myth.
Moreover, some curious Sumerian myths have no Semitic counterpart. We shall
begin our account of Mesopotamian mythology with the Sumerian material.

Sumerian Myths

Among the great mass of mythological material which is now available through
the devoted labours of Sumerologists, three types of myth appear whose
distribution is so widespread that they might justly be called basic myths.
It is clear that, although these three basic myths appear in Semitic
mythology, their origin is Sumerian, hence we shall begin our account of
Sumerian myths with them.

The Myth of Dumuzi and Inanna

The first of these myths has long been known as the descent of Ishtar into
the underworld and existed in a fragmentary form; but as the result of
Professor Kramer's skilled labours it is now known in a complete form as the
myth of Dumuzi and Inanna. Dumuzi is the Sumerian form of the more familiar
name Tammuz, while Inanna is similarly the Sumerian equivalent of the
Semitic Ishtar, the queen of heaven. Dumuzi is the prototype of all the
vegetation gods who die and rise again with the rebirth of vegetation in the
spring. In the form of the myth underlying the Tammuz liturgies, the
imprisonment of the god in the underworld is a principal motive of the myth
and is the cause of Inanna's descent into the underworld. But in the
earliest form of the myth as given by Kramer in The Ancient Near Eastern
Texts relating to the Old Testament the reason for the descent of the
goddess is not given. The form of the myth here related follows Kramer's
version. [1]

For reasons unknown, Inanna, the queen of heaven, decides to go down into
the nether world, the 'land of no return', ruled over by her sister, the
goddess Ereshkigal. Kramer suggests that the motive may have been ambition,
the desire to bring the nether world under her dominion. To provide against
any disasters that may happen to her in the nether world, Inanna instructs
her vizier, Ninshubur, that if she does not return in three days he is to
perform mourning rites for her, and to go in turn to the three high gods,
Enlil of Nippur, Nanna the moon-god of Ur, and Enki, the Babylonian god of
wisdom, in Eridu, and entreat them to intervene on her behalf that she may
not be put to death in the nether world.

Then Inanna puts on her queenly apparel and her jewels, and approaches the
gate of the nether world. There she is challenged by Neti, the gate-keeper
of the seven gates. By the orders of Ereshkigal and in accordance with the
laws of the nether world, Inanna, as she passes through the seven gates, is
stripped of an item of her apparel at each gate; she is brought before
Ereshkigal and the Anunnaki, the seven judges of the nether world. They turn
'the eyes of death' upon her and she is turned into a corpse and hung upon a
stake. After three days, as she does not return, Ninshubur does as he was
directed by Inanna. Enlil and Nanna refuse to intervene, but Enki performs
certain magical operations by which Inanna is restored to life. Out of dirt
from his finger-nail he creates two strange creatures, the kurgarru and the
kalaturru, the meaning of whose names is unknown, and sends them to the
nether world with the food of life and the water of life. They are told to
sprinkle the food of life and the water of life sixty times upon the corpse
of Inanna. They do so and the goddess is restored to life. It is a law of
the nether world that no one may return from thence without providing a
substitute. Hence the myth goes on to describe the ascent of Inanna to the
land of the living accompanied by demons who are to carry back to the nether
world the substitute whom she provides. First Ninshubur, then Shara the god
of Umma, and then Latarak the god of Badtibira are in turn claimed by the
demons and rescued by Inanna.

Here the text as given in The Ancient Near Eastern Texts breaks off, but
Kramer adds in a footnote to his introductory summary of the myth a
surprising addition recently discovered. According to this fragment of the
myth, Inanna and her escort of demons come to her own city of Erech and
there find her husband Dumuzi. He does not humble himself before her as the
other three had done, and she therefore hands him over to the demons to be
carried off to the nether world. Dumuzi entreats Utu, the sun-god, to
deliver him, and here the fragment breaks off. Hence we do not know whether,
in the original Sumerian form of the myth, Dumuzi, who is Tammuz, was
carried away by the demons into the nether world.

This is the first of the three basic myths referred to above in its Sumerian
form. It is possible that the Sumerians brought the myth with them when they
settled in the delta, and that this is its earliest form. In this form
Inanna does not descend into the nether world to bring back her
husband/brother Dumuzi, or Tammuz, from death. On the contrary and against
all later conceptions of the myth, it is manna who allows the demons to
carry off Dumuzi to the nether world as her substitute, while the reason for
her own descent is left unexplained. Nevertheless, the Tammuz-liturgies [2]
which belong to the Sumerian period already show the later form of the myth.
They describe the chaos and desolation which fall upon the land when Tammuz
goes down into the nether world; they describe Ishtar's lamentation and her
descent into the nether world to rescue Tammuz from its powers; and they
conclude with a description of the triumphant return of Tammuz to the land
of the living.

It is also clear that the liturgies form part of a seasonal ritual, and
hence that the myth may rightly be classed as a ritual myth. A possible
reason for the change in the original form of the myth may be found in the
fact that the Sumerians, incoming into the delta, were passing from a
pastoral economy to an agricultural mode of life. In the liturgies Tammuz
and Ishtar are frequently represented under the figure of the male and
female fir-tree, and the fir-tree is not found in the Tigris-Euphrates
delta, but belongs to the mountainous region from which the Sumerians came.
Moreover, the fact that the towering 'ziqqurats' were a feature of Sumerian
temple architecture has been held to point in the same direction. Hence the
original form of the myth may have arisen under conditions of life which
were very different from the agricultural mode of life which the Sumerians
were obliged to adopt when they settled in the delta. There is evidence to
show that Semites and Sumerians were both occupying the delta for a
considerable time before the Amorite invasion and the final conquest and
absorption of the Sumerians by the Semites. We know that the Semites took
over from the Sumerians their cuneiform script and much of their religion
and mythology, and this may well be accepted as a further explanation of the
changed character of the Tammuz-Ishtar myth as we find it in the
Assyro-Babylonian period. We shall see later what changes the myth underwent
as it passed into other countries.

The Myth of Creation

The second basic myth which we find in a Sumerian form is the wide-spread
myth of Creation. It may be remarked here that we do not find the conception
of creation ex nihilo in any of the ancient myths of Creation. For all of
these, creation is the act of bringing order out of an original state of
chaos. When we come to deal with the Assyro-Babylonian material, we shall
see that the cosmogonic myth existed there in one main form, the well-known
Enuma Elish, or Epic of Creation, as it is now generally styled. But there
is nothing corresponding to this in the Sumerian material. Professor Kramer
has shown that Sumerian cosmogony has to be pieced together from various
myths of origin, and the following account is based on his researches. He
is, however, careful to remind us that there are great gaps in our knowledge
of Sumerian, and that many of the tablets upon which the myths have been
preserved are broken and incomplete. Hence, in the present state of our
knowledge of Sumerian it is impossible to give a completely coherent account
of Sumerian mythology.

For the sake of convenience the Sumerian myths of Creation may be arranged
under three heads: the origin of the universe, the organization of the
universe, and the creation of man.

The Origin of the Universe. In a tablet which contains a list of the
Sumerian gods, the goddess Nammu, whose name is written with the ideogram
for 'sea', is described as 'the mother who gave birth to heaven and earth'.
From other myths it appears that heaven and earth were originally a mountain
whose base was the earth and whose summit was heaven. Heaven was personified
as the god An, and earth as the goddess Ki, and from their union was
begotten the air-god Enlil, who then separated heaven from earth and brought
the universe into being in the form of heaven and earth separated by air.
Sumerian mythology gave no explanation of the origin of the primeval sea.

The Organization of the Universe.

This aspect of the creation motif is dealt with in a number of myths which
describe how the heavenly bodies and all the various elements of Sumerian
civilization came into being. The first of these myths is concerned with the
birth of the moon-god, Nanna, or Sin. The details are far from clear, and
further knowledge may modify them; but the outline of the myth seems to be
that Enlil, the high god of the Sumerian pantheon, whose shrine was at
Nippur, was enamoured of the goddess Ninlil and raped her as she was sailing
on the stream Nunbirdu. For this high-handed act Enlil was banished to the
underworld, but Ninlil, great with child, refused to be left behind, and
insisted on following Enlil to the nether world. As this would have involved
the birth of Ninlil's child Nanna, the moon-god, in the dark nether world
instead of becoming the light of the sky, Enlil devised a complicated scheme
by which Ninlil became the mother of the three deities of the nether world
as substitutes for Nanna, who was thus enabled to ascend to heaven. It is
clear that this curious and hitherto unknown myth gives a clue to the
transformation of the Tammuz-Ishtar myth, of which we have already spoken.
We can see from the Tammuz liturgies that Enlil is a frequent title of
Tammuz, and similarly that Ninlil is a frequent designation of Ishtar; so
that the descent of Ishtar into the nether world, which, as we have seen, is
unexplained in the earliest form of the Sumerian myth of manna's descent
into the nether world, finds an explanation in this myth of the birth of
Nanna, the moon-god.

In the Sumerian pantheon the moon-god, Nanna, or Sin, was the chief astral
deity, and the sun-god, Utu, was regarded as the offspring of Nanna and his
consort Ningal. In the later Hebrew cosmogony the position was reversed and
the sun became the major luminary, while the moon became female, as in
classical mythology. The Sumerians conceived of Nanna as journeying through
the night sky in a quffah, the circular boat used in the navigation of the
Euphrates, accompanied by the stars and planets, whose origin is not
explained.

After Enlil had separated heaven from earth, and the illumination of heaven
had been provided in the forms of Nanna, Utu, and the stars and planets, the
organization of the earthly part of the universe had to be undertaken, and
various myths deal with the different elements of the terrestrial order.

It should be observed that, somewhat illogically, the cities and temples of
the gods are thought of as existing before the creation of man, which comes
at the end of the various divine activities involved in creating the order
of the universe. Enlil is conceived of as the ultimate source of vegetation,
cattle, agricultural implements, and the arts of civilization, though he
brings these into being indirectly by the creation of lesser gods who carry
out his instructions.

In order to provide cattle and grain for the earth, at the suggestion of
Enki, the Babylonian Ea, the god of wisdom, Enlil creates two minor deities,
Lahar, the cattle-god, and Ashman, the grain-goddess, to provide food and
clothes for the gods. The myth describes the abundance which they create
upon earth; but they drink wine and get drunk and begin to quarrel,
neglecting their duties, so that the gods are unable to obtain what they
need. In order to remedy this situation man is created. The following is
Kramer's translation of part of the myth of Lahar and Ashman:

In those days, in the creation chamber of the gods,
In their house Dulkug, Lahar and Ashnan were fashioned;
The produce of Lahar and Ashnan,
The Anunnaki of the Dulkug eat, but remain unsated;
In their pure sheepfolds milk .... and good things,
The Anunnaki of the Dulkug drink, remain unsated;
For the sake of the good things in their pure sheepfolds,
Man was given breath.

In addition to myths relating to the provision of food and clothing, there
are various myths dealing with other elements of civilization and the
organization of the universe. A long poem, much of which is still obscure,
describes the creation of the pickaxe by Enlil and the gift of this valuable
implement to 'the black-headed people' to enable them to build their houses
and cities. Another myth describes the activities of Enki in providing Sumer
with the necessary elements of civilization. The myth describes how Enki,
beginning with Sumer, journeys through different parts of the world, 'fixing
the destinies', a Sumerian term meaning the creative activity of the gods in
bringing order into the universe. First Enki visits Ur, then Meluhha, which
might possibly signify Egypt, then the rivers Tigris and Euphrates which he
fills with fishes, and then the Persian Gulf. Over each of these he appoints
a god or goddess to take charge. A passage from Kramer's translation of this
interesting myth will illustrate the nature of Enki's civilizing activities:
[3]

The plough and the yoke he (Enki) directed,
The great prince Enki caused the ox to . . .;
To the pure crops he roared,
In the steadfast field he made grain grow;
The lord, the jewel and ornament of the plain,
The . . . farmer of Enlil,
Enkimdu, him of the canals and ditches,
Enki placed in their charge.
The lord called to the steadfast field,
he caused it to produce much grain,
Enki made it bring forth its small and large beans . . .
The . . . grains he heaped up for the granary,
Enki added granary to granary,
With Enlil he increases abundance in the land;
Her whose head is . . . whose face is.. .
The lady who . . . the might of the land, the steadfast support
of the black-headed people,
Ashnan, strength of all things,
Enki placed in charge.

Enki then goes on to place the brick-god, Kabta, in charge of the pick-axe
and the brick-mould. He lays foundations and builds houses, and places them
under the charge of Mushdamma, the 'great builder of Enlil'. He fills the
plain with vegetable and animal, life, and places Sumuqan, 'king of the
mountain', in charge. Lastly, Enki builds stables and sheepfolds and places
them under the shepherd-god Dumuzi.

The last myth dealing with the organization of the universe to which we
shall refer is concerned with the activities of the goddess manna, or
Ishtar. We have already had occasion to refer to the expression 'fixing the
destinies', and we shall see when we come to deal with Babylonian myths that
an object called 'the tablet of destinies' plays an important part in
several myths. The possession of it was one of the attributes of deity, and
we hear of the tablets being stolen or taken by force on several occasions.
The god who possessed them had the power of controlling the order of the
universe. In the myth with which we are now dealing, Inanna wishes to confer
the blessings of civilization upon her own city, Erech. In order to do this
she must acquire the me, a Sumerian word which appears to denote the same
power as that which is conferred by the possession of the Akkadian 'tablets
of destiny'. The me are in the hands of Enki, the god of wisdom.
Accordingly, Inanna journeys to Eridu, where Enki dwells in his house of the
Apsu, the sweet-water abyss. Enki receives his daughter Inanna hospitably
and makes a great feast for her. When he gets merry with wine he promises
her all kinds of gifts, including the me, or divine decrees which, in
Kramer's words, are 'the basis of the culture pattern of Sumerian
civilization'. The myth contains a list of over a hundred items which
constitute the elements of Sumerian civilization. Inanna receives the gifts
with joy, and loads them on her bark, 'the boat of heaven', and sets sail
for Erech. When Enki recovers from his orgy he realizes that the me are
missing from their accustomed place. The mention of a place in which the me
are kept suggests that they are in the form of tablets. On discovering his
loss Enki sends his messenger Isimud with instructions to recover them.
Seven times he attempts to do so, but each time he is foiled by Ninshubur,
Inanna's vizier, of whom we have already heard. So the goddess brings to
Erech the blessings of civilization. It will be noted that the various myths
to which we have referred reflect the rivalry which existed between the
various city-states of Sumer. The first items on the list of the me which
Inanna obtained from Enki are those referring to lordship the crown, throne,
and sceptre are mentioned, from which we may infer that the struggle for the
hegemony of Sumer is one of the motives underlying these myths of the
organization of the universe.

The Creation of Man.

We have already seen that the myth of Lahar and Ashnan ended up with the
creation of man for the service of the gods.

Another myth, the text of which is difficult and broken, describes the way
in which man was created. Although the Sumerian myth differs considerably
from the account given in the Babylonian Epic of Creation, both versions
agree in the object for which man was created, namely, for the service of
the gods, to till the ground and free the gods from having to work for their
living.

In the Sumerian myth the gods complain that they cannot get their food.
Enki, the god of wisdom, to whom the gods generally resort in time of need,
is asleep; but Nammu, the primeval ocean, the mother of the gods, arouses
him from sleep. By Enki's instructions Nammu and Ninmah, the goddess of
birth, assisted by deities, whom Kramer's rendering describes as 'good and
princely fashioners', mix clay which is 'over the abyss' and bring man into
existence.

The tablet is broken and the text is difficult and obscure, but some curious
details emerge. Enki gives a banquet to the gods to celebrate the creation
of man. Enki and Ninmah drink much wine and become drunk. Ninmah takes some
of the clay which is 'over the abyss' and creates six different kinds of
human beings whose nature is obscure, except in the case of the last two,
which are the barren woman and the eunuch. Enki decrees the fate of the
eunuch as destined to stand before the king. The myth goes on to describe a
further act of creation by Enki. He creates a human being who is feeble in
mind and body, and then asks Ninmah to do something to improve the condition
of the miserable creature, but she is unable to do anything and curses Enki
for making such a creature.

One of the Hebrew words for man is enosh, a root one meaning of which is
'weak' or 'sick'. This aspect of humanity is often emphasized in Hebrew
poetry, and this curious element in the Sumerian myth may possibly underlie
the Hebrew representation of man as failing to measure up to the place in
the universe which the divine purpose had intended for him. We shall see
later that important differences appear in the Babylonian myth of Creation
which are not without significance in their influence on the Hebrew account
of how man was created.

The Myth of the Flood

The third of the basic myths is the wide-spread myth of the Deluge. Usener's
well-known work has shown that the myth of the destruction of mankind by a
flood is to be found in some form or other in every part of the world, as we
have already seen. The central motive of the myth is that the gods decide to
destroy mankind; the means by which they do so is secondary, and we shall
see that water is not the only means used. It has long been known that the
Biblical story of the Deluge was based on the Babylonian myth which will be
dealt with when we come to the next stage of our study. But that the
Babylonian form of the myth was based on an earlier Sumerian version was not
known until 1914, when the American scholar Arno Poebel published a fragment
of a Sumerian tablet containing episodes of what was clearly the myth of the
Flood. No further Sumerian tablets relating to the Flood have yet been
discovered. The outlines of the Sumerian version of the Flood story are as
follows. At the point where the fragment continues the story, a god appears
to be declaring his intention of saving mankind from the destruction which
the gods have decided to bring upon them. The reason for their decision is
not given. Enki is the god who takes steps to save mankind from destruction.
Apparently he instructs Ziusudra the pious king of Sippar to stand by a
wall, through which he will reveal to Ziusudra the dire intention of the
gods, and tell him what must be done to escape the coming flood. The part of
the text which must have described the building of the boat is missing, but
its existence is implied in the following passage which describes the Flood
and Ziusudra's escape:

All the windstorms, exceedingly powerful, attacked as one,
At the same time, the flood sweeps over the cult-centres.
After, for seven days (and) seven nights,
The flood had swept over the land,
(And) the huge boat had been tossed about by the windstorms on the great
waters,

Utu came forth, who sheds light on heaven (and) earth.
Ziusudra opened a window of the huge boat,
The hero Utu brought his rays into the giant boat.
Ziusudra, the king,
Prostrated himself before Utu,
The king kills an ox, slaughters a sheep.

Then, after a break, the tablet describes the ultimate fate of Ziusudra:

Ziusudra, the king,
Prostrated himself before Anu (and) Enlil.
Anu (and) Enlil cherished Ziusudra,
Life like (that of) a god they give him,
Breath eternal like (that of) a god they bring down for him.

Then, Ziusudra the king,
The preserver of the name of vegetation (and) of the seed of mankind,
in the land of crossing, the land of Dilmun, the place where the sun rises,
they caused to dwell. [4]

It may be inferred from the Babylonian story of the Flood that the complete
Sumerian version contained much fuller details about the cause of the flood
and the building of the boat; but these may be left until we come to deal
with the Akkadian mythology. The question whether the myth of the Flood, the
third of our basic myths, can be classed with ritual myths, presents
difficulties; but this, too, may be left until we have discussed the fuller
form of the Flood myth, and its connexion with the Gilgamesh myth.

In addition to the three basic myths described above, there are a number of
Sumerian myths which must be included in our account of what is perhaps, the
oldest mythology in the world with the possible exception of the Egyptian
one. It must also be borne in mind that our knowledge of Sumerian is still
far from complete, and the meaning of many words in that language is
uncertain; moreover, many of the tablets are in a fragmentary condition, and
often extremely hard to read. Hence, while the account given here of the
Sumerian myths rests upon the best contemporary scholarship, further
research and fresh discoveries may well make changes and additions necessary
in the future.

The Myth of Enki and Ninhursag

A myth which has no counterpart in Akkadian mythology, so far as our
knowledge goes at present, and one which Kramer has described as one of the
best preserved of the Sumerian myths, is the myth of Enki and Ninhursag. In
The Ancient Near Eastern Texts it is described as a Paradise myth, and some
of its features may underlie the Hebrew account of Paradise.

The outline of the myth is as follows: the scene is laid in Dilmun,
described both as a land and a city, and identified by modern scholars with
Bahrain in the Persian Gulf. The protagonists are the god Enki, the
water-god, and the goddess Ninhursag, the earth-mother.

The myth begins with a description of Dilmun as a clean, pure, bright place,
where the animals do not harm one another, and where there is no sickness
nor old age. The only thing wanting in Dilmun is sweet water, and this is
provided by Enki at Ninhursag's request.

The Myth then goes on to relate that from the union of Enki and Ninhursag is
born Ninsar, or Ninmu, the goddess of plants. Ninhursag's period of
gestation is described as lasting nine days, a day for each month of human
gestation.

Enki then impregnates his daughter Ninsar, who gives birth to the goddess
Ninkurra, and she, in turn, being impregnated by Enki gives birth to the
goddess Uttu, also described as the goddess of plants. Her name must not be
confused with the name of the sun god Utu.

Then Ninhursag warns Uttu against Enki, and gives her certain advice as to
how she is to deal with Enki's approaches. Following the advice Uttu demands
a present of cucumbers, apples, and grapes, possibly as wedding gifts. Enki
brings the required gifts and is -joyfully received by Uttu; as the result
of their union eight plants spring forth, but, before Ninhursag can assign
them their names and qualities, Enki eats all the plants. Ninhursag,
infuriated, curses Enki with a terrible curse and departs. The gods are
dismayed, and Enki is stricken with sickness in eight different parts of his
body. Through the craft of the fox, Ninhursag is induced to return and cure
Enki of his sickness. She does this by creating in succession eight deities,
one for each part of Enki's body in which the sickness is located. It has
been pointed out that there is a punning relation between the name of each
deity and the particular part of Enki's body affected. The closing lines of
the poem seem to suggest that the eight deities are regarded as Enki's
children, and their destiny is fixed by Ninhursag.

This curious myth does not seem to have any counterpart in the field of Near
Eastern mythology, except in so far as the concept of a golden age in the
past is wide-spread, and the incestuous relation between father and daughter
finds an echo in the relation between Saturn and Vesta in Greek mythology,
as Milton's lines remind us:

Thee bright-haired Vesta, long of yore
To solitary Saturn bore;
His daughter she, in Saturn's reign
Such mixture was not deemed a stain.

But we have no clue to the interpretation of the details of the myth.
Professor Thorkild Jacobsen has said with regard to it, 'This myth
endeavours to trace a causal unity among many disparate phenomena, but it is
a unity causal in the mythopoeic sense only. When plants are seen as born of
soil and water, we can still follow, although with reservations. Towards the
end of the myth, however, the deities born that Enki may be healed have no
intrinsic connexion either with soil who bears them, or with water.' [5] The
myth does at least show that although the Babylonians borrowed much from
Sumerian mythology, the Semitic mind found it difficult to accept many
elements in that mythology.

The Myth of Dumuzi and Enkimdu

Another Sumerian myth is of interest as finding an echo in the Hebrew story
of Cain and Abel, but without its tragic ending. It deals with the age-long
rivalry between the agricultural and the pastoral modes of life. In the myth
Inanna, or Ishtar, is about to choose a husband. The choice lies between the
shepherd-god Dumuzi, or Tammuz, and the farmer-god Enkimdu.

Inanna's brother Utu, the sun-god, favours Dumuzi, but Inanna herself
prefers Enkimdu. Dumuzi urges his suit and claims to have everything that
Enkimdu can offer and more. Enkimdu endeavours to appease Dumuzi and offers
him all kinds of gifts, but Dumuzi remains determined to have Inanna, and
apparently succeeds in his intention, since, as we have already seen,
various myths represent Dumuzi as the husband of Inanna. Kramer's rendering
of the conclusion of the poem is worth quoting.

Enkimdu speaks:

'Thou, O shepherd, why dost thou start a quarrel?
O Shepherd Dumuzi, why dost thou start a quarrel?
Me with thee, O shepherd, me with thee why does thou compare?
Let thy sheep eat the grass of the earth,
In my meadowland let thy sheep pasture,
In the fields of Zabalam let them eat grass,
Let all thy folds drink the water of my river Unun.'

Dumuzi speaks:

'I, the shepherd, at my marriage do not enter, O farmer, as my friend,
O farmer, Enkimdu, as my friend, O farmer, as my friend, do not enter:

Enkimdu replies:

'Wheat I shall bring thee, beans I shall bring thee,
Beans of . . . I shall bring thee,
The maid Inanna (and) whatever is pleasing to thee,
The maid Inanna . . . I shall bring thee."  [6]

When we come to deal with Hebrew myths we shall see that various layers of
older myths underlie the present form of the Cain and Abel myth, and it is
possible that Dumuzi's rejection of all the farmer-god's gifts underlies
Yahweh's rejection of Cain's agricultural offerings.

Gilgamesh Myths

An important figure in Akkadian mythology is the hero Gilgamesh, who is,
according to the Gilgamesh Epic, two parts god, and one part man. But he
also belongs to Sumerian mythology, and three Sumerian texts included in The
Ancient Near Eastern Texts in Kramer's translation contain accounts of
episodes in which Gilgamesh is concerned. It should be remarked here that in
the Sumerian king-lists Gilgamesh is the fifth king of the dynasty of Erech,
the second dynasty after the Flood according to Sumerian reckoning. The
first of these texts, entitled 'Gilgamesh and Agga' in The Ancient Near
Eastern Texts, reflects the struggles for domination between the early
Sumerian city-states. It contains the story of the conflict between
Gilgamesh of Erech and Agga the last king of the dynasty of Kish, the first
dynasty after the Flood.

Much of the poem is obscure, but it seems to represent a demand by Agga for
the submission of Erech, the resistance of the demand by Gilgamesh, the
siege of Erech by Agga, and a final reconciliation of the two kings. There
is no intervention of the gods, hence the text is not strictly speaking part
of Sumerian mythology, and is only included here because of its evidence
that the figure of Gilgamesh is derived from Sumerian sources.

The second text, entitled in The Ancient Near Eastern Texts 'Gilgamesh and
the Land of the Living', clearly contains mythical material which was
utilized in the composition of the Akkadian Epic of Gilgamesh, with which we
shall deal later. Its theme is the search for immortality, a motive which
underlies much of Near Eastern mythology. As the substance of this text has
been taken up and more fully developed in the Akkadian Epic mentioned above,
it need only be briefly summarized here. Oppressed by the all-pervasiveness
of death, and conscious that he himself cannot escape it, Gilgamesh
determines to find the Land of the Living. His friend and servant Enkidu, of
whom we shall learn more in the Akkadian Epic, advises him to consult the
sun-god Utu about his adventure. Utu at first warns him of its dangers, but
afterwards helps him to cross the seven mountains and reach his goal which
appears to be the cedar mountain where the giant Huwawa dwells. Gilgamesh
and Enkidu, after some obscure preliminaries, cut off the giant's head. Here
the tablet breaks off. The importance of the text lies chiefly in the fact
that it shows the Sumerian preoccupation with the problem of death, and that
it is the source from which the Babylonians drew the materials for the
complete Gilgamesh story given in the Akkadian form of the myth.

The third Gilgamesh fragment, entitled in The Ancient Near Eastern Texts
'The Death of Gilgamesh', further develops the theme of death and the quest
for immortality. Gilgamesh appears to have had a dream which is interpreted
to him by the god Enlil as meaning that the gods have denied immortality to
mankind, but that Gilgamesh has been granted fame, wealth, and success in
battle. The second part of the poem appears to describe a funerary ritual,
which may, as Kramer suggests, throw light on the significance of the
death-chamber discovered by Sir Leonard Woolley in his excavation of Ur. The
Sumerians may, like the ancient Egyptians, have immolated the wives and
court attendants on the occasion of the death of a king; the text appears to
imply that Gilgamesh has died, and ends with a paean in his praise.

Here we may leave the subject of Sumerian mythology, and pass on to the
Akkadian, that is, the Assyro-Babylonian mythology, much of which is, as we
have already pointed out, based on the Sumerian material.

It must be borne in mind that the Semitic conquerors of the Sumerians, while
they adopted the Sumerian cuneiform script, adapted it to express a Semitic
language (Akkadian) totally unlike Sumerian. Hence many of 'the gods of the
Sumerian pantheon adopted by the Babylonians and Assyrians appear under
Semitic names in the Akkadian mythology. Inanna becomes Ishtar, Utu becomes
Shamash, the moon-god Nanna becomes Sin, although many of the names of the
temples and ritual terms retain their Sumerian forms. Many of the prayers
and incantations continued to be recited by the priests in Sumerian, which
remained the language of religious ritual and liturgy long after it had
ceased to be a spoken language, much as Latin continued, and still
continues, to be the liturgical language of the Church. The Akkadian forms
of Sumerian myths thus reflect both the altered political conditions of
Semitic domination, and the different mentality of the Semitic conquerors.

Babylonian Myths

We have, for convenience, classed the myths described in this section as
Babylonian, although many of the texts which contain them were written by
Assyrian scribes and come from the library of the Assyrian king,
Ashurbanipal. Professor Sidney. Smith has said:' 'It is certain that the
Assyrian scribes were engaged in transforming the literature they borrowed
from Babylonia from the style of the First Dynasty of Babylon to the form in
which we find it in Ashurbanipal's library.' All the gods of Assyria were
also worshipped in Babylonia, and the Assyrian religious festivals were
celebrated at the same times and in the same way as those of Babylonia.
There are a few myths or legends peculiar to Assyria, such as the legend of
Sargon of Agade, which has a very curious history. But in the main the myths
which we shall describe are of Babylonian provenance, and represent the
Semitic transformation of earlier Sumerian material.

We shall begin by giving the Babylonian form of the three basic or type
myths already described in the previous section:

The Descent of Ishtar into the Nether World

As in the Sumerian version, so also in the Babylonian form of the myth, no
reason is given for Ishtar's descent into the nether world; but at the end
of the poem, after Ishtar has been released, Tammuz is introduced as
Ishtar's brother and lover, without any explanation of how he comes to be in
the nether world. The lines that follow seem to imply the return of Tammuz
to the land of the living with rejoicings. It is only from the Tammuz
liturgies that we learn of the imprisonment of Tammuz in the underworld, and
of the desolation caused by his absence from the land of the living. In the
Babylonian version of the descent of Ishtar to the land of no return, we
have a description of the failure of all sexual fertility caused by her
absence: 'the bull springs not upon the cow; the ass impregnates not the
jenny; in the street the man impregnates not the maiden.' e It is with these
words that Papsukkal, the vizier of the great gods, announces the non-return
of Ishtar and its consequences. The description of the descent of the
goddess follows the Sumerian version in its main outlines; but there are
some interesting differences. When Ishtar knocks at the gate of the
underworld she threatens to batter down the gate if she is not admitted, and
to set free the dead who are in the underworld. A vivid passage of the poem
describes this scene:

O gatekeeper, open your gate,
Open your gate that I may enter!
If you open not the gate so that I cannot enter,
I will smash the door, I will shatter the bolt,
I will smash the doorpost, I will move the doors,
I will raise up the dead, eating the living,
So that the dead will outnumber the living. [9]

Ishtar, in this version of the myth, is a much more hostile and threatening
figure than she is in the Sumerian version. We also find in Ishtar's threat
to let loose the dead upon the living an illustration of the Babylonian fear
of ghosts which was such a marked feature of their religion and appears in
so many of their incantations. As Ishtar passes through the seven gates she
is stripped of some part of her apparel at each gate, as in the Sumerian
version. The Babylonian version omits the grim description of her being
turned into a corpse by the baleful 'eyes of death' however, she does not
return, and then follows Papsukkal's appeal to the great gods quoted above.
In answer to this appeal Ea, who is Enki in the Sumerian version, creates
Asushunamir the eunuch, and sends him down to induce Ereshkigal to give him
the life-water bag. By his charm he succeeds in doing this, and Ereshkigal
reluctantly orders her vizier Namtar to sprinkle Ishtar with the water of
life. Ishtar is released and returns, receiving back those articles of
adornment and apparel which had been taken from her as she passes through
the seven gates on her return journey. But a reference is made to the ransom
which she must pay. Ereshkigal says to Namtar, 'If she does not give you her
ransom price, bring her back.' What this is to be is not specified, but the
mention of Tammuz at the end of the myth seems to, imply his return from the
underworld, although no indication has been given as to how he came there.

We have already seen that there is a Sumerian myth of Enlil's banishment to
the underworld and of Inanna's accompanying him there, and reference has
been made to the identification of Tammuz with Enlil in the liturgies. Hence
it would seem that in the course of the development of the myth the descent
of Tammuz into the underworld came to assume increasing importance, and to
be related to the death and rebirth of vegetation. When, in the course of
time, the myth was carried into other countries, it was the death of Tammuz
and the mourning for him that came to be emphasized at the expense of other
features of the myth. Thus we have a reference in Ezekiel [10] to the women
of Israel weeping for Tammuz, and the myth of Venus and Adonis represents
the form in which the myth had passed into Greek mythology.

Milton's reference to the river Adonis running 'purple to the sea, supposed
with blood of Thammuz yearly wounded', is a reminder of the Syrian form of
the myth, and we shall see that the death of Baal in the Ugaritic mythology
may represent an earlier stage of the development of the myth in its passage
to Syria.

The Creation Myth

We have seen that in the Sumerian version of the second basic myth, the myth
of Creation, the creative activities are shared among various gods, Enlil
and Enki being the principal figures concerned in creation. But in Babylonia
the myth of Creation assumed central importance owing to the fact that it
became associated with the great Babylonian New Year, or Akitu, Festival and
was embodied in liturgical form in the poem or chant known from its opening
words as Enuma elish, 'When on high'.

In this form of the myth the Babylonian god Marduk plays the principal part.
It is he who conquers Tiamat, secures the tablets of destiny, and performs
the various creative acts described in the poem. The seven tablets
containing the myth were first discovered by the British excavation of
Nineveh, and parts of them were translated and published by George Smith in
1876.

Over-hasty enthusiasts immediately made comparisons between the seven days
of Creation in the Priestly account in Gen. 1 and the seven tablets of the
Babylonian myth, and advanced the theory that the Hebrew form of the
Creation story was entirely dependent on the Babylonian. We shall return to
this point when we come to deal with Hebrew mythology. Since then, further
portions  of the tablets have been discovered and some of the gaps in the
first discovery have been filled. Most modern scholars assign the date of
the composition to the beginning of the second millennium B.C., the period
when Babylon was becoming the leading city of the Akkadian city states. We
know from such portions of the Babylonian New Year liturgy as remain to us
that at two points of the New Year Festival ritual the priests recited the
Enuma elish with the force of a magical incantation.

The German excavation of the site of Ashur, the old capital of the Assyrian
empire, brought to light the Assyrian version of the Enuma elish, in which
the name of the Babylonian god Marduk was replaced by the name of Ashur the
chief god of Assyria.

The outline of the myth in its Babylonian form is as follows:

Tablet one begins with a description of the primeval condition of the
universe when nothing existed except Apsu, the sweet-water ocean, and
Tiamat, the salt water ocean. From the union of these two the gods were
brought into existence. The first pair, Lahmu and Lahamu (interpreted by
Jacobsen [11] as the silt deposited at the junction of the sea and the
rivers) gave birth to Anshar and Kishar, interpreted by the same scholar as
the circular horizons of sky and earth. Anshar and Kishar in turn give birth
to Anu, the sky, and Nudimmud or Ea, the earth - and water-god.

Here a break with the Sumerian tradition appears. Enlil, whose activities we
have already seen in the Sumerian mythology, is replaced by Ea, or Enki, who
appears in Babylonian mythology as the god of wisdom and the source of all
magic. Ea then begets Marduk, the hero of the Babylonian form of the myth.
But before the birth of Marduk we have an account of the first conflict
between the primeval gods and those whom they have begotten. Tiamat and Apsu
are disturbed by the noise of the younger gods and take counsel with Mummu,
Apsu's vizier, how to destroy them. Tiamat is reluctant to destroy her
offspring, but Apsu and Mummu devise a plan. Their intention is disclosed to
the gods who are alarmed, but Ea, the all-wise, devises a counter-scheme; he
casts a spell of sleep upon Apsu, slays him, binds Mummu and puts a cord in
his nose. He then builds his sacred chamber and calls it 'Apsu', and rests
in profound peace. In this chamber the birth of Marduk takes place, and a
description of his beauty and tremendous strength follows. The first tablet
ends with a description of the preparation for a renewed conflict between
the primeval gods and the younger gods. Tiamat is reproached by her other
children for having remained quiescent when Apsu was destroyed, and they
succeed in stirring her up to take measures for the annihilation of Anu and
his associates. She makes Kingu, her firstborn, the leader of the attack,
arms him, and invests him with the tablets of destiny. She then begets a
horde of monstrous beings, such as the scorpion-man and the centaur whom we
find depicted on Babylonian seals and boundary-stones. She places Kingu at
the head of this host, and prepares to avenge Apsu.

The second tablet describes how the news of the coming attack is received by
the assembly of the gods. Anshar is troubled and smites his thigh in dismay.
He first reminds Ea of his previous victory over Apsu and suggests that he
should deal with Tiamat in the same way; but Ea either refuses to go or is
unsuccessful; the text is broken at this point, and what happens to Ea is
not clear. Then Anu is sent armed with the authority of the assembly of the
gods to turn Tiamat from her purpose, but he also returns unsuccessful. Then
Anshar rises in the assembly of the gods and proposes that Marduk, the
strong hero, should be entrusted with the task. Marduk's father Ea advises
him to accept the task, and Marduk agrees to undertake it on condition that
he is given full and equal authority in the assembly of the gods, and that
his word is to determine destiny unalterably. Here the second tablet ends.

The third tablet, after recapitulating the decision of the gods, ends with a
feast at which Marduk is to be officially invested with the authority which
he had demanded.

The fourth tablet begins with the enthronement of Marduk as king and his
investment with the royal insignia. The gods require from him a proof that
he possesses the power to carry out what he has undertaken. He thereupon
causes his robe to disappear and then to reappear. The gods are satisfied
and proclaim, 'Marduk is king.' Then Marduk arms himself for the combat; his
weapons are bow and arrows, mace, lightning, and a net held at the corners
by the four winds; he fills his body with flame, and creates the seven
raging hurricanes; he mounts his storm-chariot, and advances against Tiamat
and her host. He challenges Tiamat to single combat; he casts his net to
enclose her, and when she opens her mouth to swallow him he drives in the
evil wind to distend her and transfixes her with his arrow, splitting her
heart. Her demon helpers flee, but are caught in the net and bound. Their
leader, Kingu, also is caught and bound. Then Marduk takes from Kingu the
tablets of destiny and fastens them upon his own breast, thus assuming
supreme authority among the gods. His next act is to split the body of
Tiamat in two; he places half of her above the earth as the sky, fixes it
with bars, sets guards, and charges them not to let her waters escape. He
then builds Esharra, the abode of the great gods, after the pattern of Ea's
abode Apsu, and causes Anu, Enlil, and Ea to occupy their places therein.
Here ends the fourth tablet.

The fifth tablet is too fragmentary to enable us to obtain from it a
complete account of Marduk's first steps in organizing the universe, but its
opening lines show that his first care was the calendar, one of the most
important responsibilities of a Babylonian king. Marduk is represented as
establishing the course of the year and the order of the months by the
moon's changes. He also establishes the three celestial 'ways', the way of
Enlil in the northern heavens, the way of Anu in the zenith, and the way of
Ea in the south. The planet Jupiter is placed in charge of the heavenly
order.

In the sixth tablet we have the description of the creation of man. Marduk
declares his intention of creating man for the service of the gods. By the
advice of Ea it is decided that the leader of the rebellion, Kingu, shall
die that mankind may be fashioned. Accordingly Kingu is slain, and from his
blood mankind is created for the service of the gods, 'to free them', that
is, to perform the menial tasks belonging to the temple ritual and to
provide food for the gods. Then the gods build a temple for Marduk, the
great Esagila temple in Babylon with its ziqqurat. At the command of Anu
they proclaim the fifty great names of Marduk, a proceeding which occupies
the rest of the poem.

This is the outline of the Babylonian myth of creation, and the underlying
Sumerian elements can easily be detected. But the elements which were
scattered over a number of Sumerian myths have, in the Enuma elish, been
brought together and welded into a coherent whole. We have no evidence that
the various Sumerian myths ever formed part of a ritual. They can be
explained, as Professor Thorkild Jacobsen has so ably done, on aetiological
lines. But while the aetiological factor is still discernible in Enuma
elish, the poem has now become a ritual myth; possessing magical potency,
and playing a vital part in the Babylonian New Year Festival in connexion
with the dramatic representation of the death and resurrection of the god.

The Myth of the Flood

The third of our basic myths is the myth of the Flood. In this case the
somewhat fragmentary Sumerian myth has been considerably expanded in its
Babylonian form and has been embedded in the Gilgamesh Epic. We shall deal
with the Babylonian form of the saga of Gilgamesh later, but the Flood myth
is linked up with the Gilgamesh Epic so as to form part of the adventures of
its hero.

A mythological theme almost entirely absent from Sumerian mythology so far
as we know it at present, but very prominent in Semitic mythology, is the
problem of the existence of death and sickness, and the quest for
immortality. In the Gilgamesh Epic the problem is forced upon Gilgamesh by
the death of his companion Enkidu, of whom we shall hear more when we deal
with the other parts of the Epic; but at present we are concerned with the
connexion between the Epic and the Flood myth. After the description of
Enkidu's death and the mourning of Gilgamesh for his companion, we are told
that Gilgamesh is disturbed by the realization that he himself too must die,

'When I die, shall I not be like Enkidu?
Woe has entered my belly.
Fearing death, I roam over the steppe.'  [12]

The only mortal who is known to have escaped death and attained immortality
is Gilgamesh's ancestor Utnapishtim, the Babylonian equivalent of Ziusudra,
the Sumerian hero of the Flood. Gilgamesh therefore resolves to go in search
of his ancestor in order to discover the secret of immortality. He receives
various warnings of the difficulties and dangers of the journey. He is told
before he can reach his goal he will have to cross the mountains of Mashu
and the waters of death, a journey which only the god Shamash has ever
accomplished. Nevertheless, he braves the dangers and reaches Utnapishtim at
last. The text is broken at the point where the two meet, and when it
becomes legible again Utnapishtim is telling Gilgamesh that the gods have
reserved to themselves the secret of death and life. Gilgamesh then asks
Utnapishtim how he has attained the possession of immortality, and in reply
Utnapishtim tells him the story of the Flood. This is contained in the
eleventh tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the longest and best preserved of
the twelve tablets which comprise the Epic. That the myth was widely known
in the ancient East is attested by the fact that Hittite and Hurrian
fragments of the myth have been discovered.

Utnapishtim begins by telling Gilgamesh that the story which he is about to
relate is 'a hidden matter, a secret of the gods'. He describes himself as a
man of Shuruppak, most ancient of the cities of Akkad. Ea reveals to him
through the wall of his reed-but that the gods have decided to destroy all
the seed of life by a flood, though the reason for their decision is not
given. Ea instructs Utnapishtim to build a ship into which he is to bring
'the seed of all living things'. The dimensions and shape of the ship are
given, according to which it appears that the ship was to be a perfect cube.
Utnapishtim asks Ea how he is to explain to the citizens of Shuruppak the
reasons for his actions, and Ea tells him that he is to say that he has
incurred the displeasure of Enlil and that he has been banished from Enlil's
territory. He tells them,

'To the Deep I will therefore go down,
to dwell with my lord Ea.'

He further tells them that Enlil is about to shower down abundance upon
them; so that they are completely deceived as to the god's real intentions.
Then follows the account of the building of the ship and the loading of it:

'(Whatever I had) I laded upon her;
Whatever I had of silver I laded upon her;
Whatever I (had) of gold I laded upon her;
Whatever I had of all the living beings I (laded) upon her.
All my family and kin I made go aboard the ship.
The beasts of the field, the wild creatures of the field,
All the craftsmen I made go aboard.'  [13]

Then follows a vivid description of the storm. Adad thunders; Nergal tears
down the doorposts of the gates that hold back the waters of the upper
ocean; the Anunnaki lift up the torches, 'setting the land ablaze with their
glare'. The gods themselves are alarmed and cower like dogs against the wall
of heaven. Ishtar, who apparently had incited the gods to destroy mankind,
lifts up her voice and bewails her action, while the rest of the gods weep
with her. The storm rages for six days and nights. On the seventh day it
subsides; Utnapishtim looks out and sees that the landscape is as level as a
flat roof, and that 'all of mankind had returned to clay'. The ship grounds
on Mt Nisir. Utnapishtim waits seven days, and then sends out a dove which
returns having found no resting place. He then sends out a swallow which
also returns. Finally he sends out a raven which finds food and does not
return. Then he lets out all that are in the ship and offers sacrifice. The
gods smell the sweet savour and gather like flies to the sacrifice.

Ishtar arrives, and lifts up her necklace of lapis-lazuli and swears by it
never to forget what has happened. She upbraids Enlil for having caused the
destruction of her people. Then Enlil arrives at the sacrifices and is
furious that any one has been allowed to escape. Ninurta blames Ea for
betraying the secret of the gods, and Ea expostulates with Enlil and
intercedes for Utnapishtim. Enlil is appeased and blesses Utnapishtim and
his wife and confers upon them immortality like the gods. He decrees that
henceforth they shall dwell far away at the mouth of the rivers. There the
account of the Flood ends, and the rest of the tablet, together with tablet
twelve, belong to the Gilgamesh story, and will be dealt with later.

While excavations at various Mesopotamian sites have shown evidence for
severe floods at Ur, Kish, and Erech, there is no evidence for a flood
covering the whole country; and the severity and date of the floods differ
for each of the above-mentioned cities. Nevertheless the myth undoubtedly
rests upon the tradition of a flood of unusual severity, although, as its
setting in the Gilgamesh Epic suggests, it has been linked up with funerary
ritual and with the search for immortality. There is not, however,
sufficient evidence to show that the Flood myth, like the Creation myth,
became a ritual myth. We shall now describe the other Assyro-Babylonian
myths which have been preserved in the various collections which the labours
of archaeologists have made available in recent years.

The Epic of Gilgamesh

This very remarkable literary production in which, as we have already seen,
the Flood myth is embedded, is partly myth and partly saga. It relates the
adventures of a semi-mythical king of Erech who is named in the Sumerian
king-lists as the fifth king of the first dynasty of Erech, and is said to
have reigned 120 years. The work was extremely popular and widely
distributed in the ancient Near East. Fragments of a Hittite translation
have been found in the archives of Boghazkoy; also a fragment of a Hittite
version. A fragment of the Akkadian version was found in the course of the
American excavation of Megiddo.

Professor Speiser's words about the Epic are worth quoting.

'For the first time in the history of the world a profound experience on
such a heroic scale has found expression in a noble style. The scope and
sweep of the epic, and its sheer poetic power, give it a timeless appeal. In
antiquity, the influence of the poem spread to various tongues and
cultures.' [14]

The Akkadian version consisted of twelve tablets, of which most of the
fragments come from the library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh. The longest and
best preserved fragment is tablet eleven containing the account of the
Flood, which we have already discussed. The Epic opens with a description of
the strength and heroic qualities of Gilgamesh. The gods have created him of
superhuman size and valour; he is said to be two-thirds god and one-third
man. But the nobles of Erech complain to the gods that Gilgamesh, who should
be the shepherd of his people, is behaving in an arrogant and tyrannical
manner. They beg the gods to create a being like Gilgamesh, against whom he
may measure his strength, so that they may have peace. Accordingly the
goddess Aruru fashions from clay the figure of Enkidu, a wild human creature
of the steppes, of surpassing strength. He feeds on grass, is friendly to
the wild beasts and drinks with them at their watering-places. He destroys
the hunter's snares and delivers the wild animals taken in them. When one of
Gilgamesh's hunters brings the report to him of the nature and strange
behaviour of this wild man of the steppes, Gilgamesh tells the hunter to
take a temple-prostitute to the watering-place where Enkidu is wont to drink
with the wild animals that she may exercise her wiles upon him. The hunter
does as he was commanded, and the woman lies in wait for Enkidu until he
comes to drink with the wild beasts at the watering place. When he comes she
displays her charms before him, and he is seized with desire for her. After
seven days of amorous delight Enkidu awakes from his trance and finds that a
change has taken place in him. The wild beasts now flee from him in terror,
and the woman says to him,

'You are wise, Enkidu, you have become like a god.'

She then tells him of the glories and delights of Erech, and of the strength
and fame of Gilgamesh; she induces him to discard his clothing of skins, to
shave and anoint himself, and leads him to Erech into the presence of
Gilgamesh. Enkidu and Gilgamesh then engage in a trial of strength which
ends in a compact of friendship. The two swear eternal comradeship. This
ends the first episode of the Epic.

Here we are inevitably reminded of the theme of Genesis 3, where the serpent
promises Adam that he will become wise and like God, knowing good and evil,
if he partakes of the forbidden fruit.

It can hardly be doubted that the Epic in its present form is composed of
various myths and folk-stories which have been brought together and
artistically welded into a whole round the central figure of Gilgamesh.

The next episode relates the adventures of Gilgamesh and Enkidu as they set
out to attack and slay the fire-breathing giant Huwawa, or, as his name is
given in the Assyrian version, Humbaba. The purpose of the enterprise is, as
Gilgamesh says to Enkidu, 'that all evil from the land we may banish'. It is
possible that these stories of the adventures of Gilgamesh and his trusty
comrade Enkidu may have helped to shape the Greek myth of the labours of
Hercules, though some scholars deny this possibility. [15] In the Epic,
Huwawa is represented as guarding the cedar  forests of the Amanus
stretching six thousand leagues.

Enkidu endeavours to dissuade his friend from this perilous enterprise, but
Gilgamesh is determined to attempt it, and, with the help of the gods, after
a tremendous struggle they slay Huwawa and cut off his head. In the account
of this episode the cedar forest is described as being the abode of the
goddess Irnini, another name for Ishtar, and this forms the link with the
next episode in the Epic.

When Gilgamesh returns in triumph from his victory, the goddess Ishtar is
attracted by his beauty and tries to induce him to become her lover. He
rejects her advances with insults, and reminds her of the miserable fate of
all her previous lovers. Enraged by his rejection, the goddess begs Anu to
avenge her by creating the Bull of heaven and sending him to ravage the
kingdom of Gilgamesh. The bull is sent down and wreaks havoc among the
people of Erech, but is ultimately slain by Enkidu. As the result of this
act the gods meet in council and decide that Enkidu must die. Enkidu has a
dream in which he sees himself carried off to the underworld and transformed
by Nergal into a ghost. The dream contains a description of the Semitic
conception of the underworld which is worth quoting

'He (the god) transformed me,
So that my arms were like those of a bird.
Looking at me, he leads me to the House of Darkness, The abode of Irkalla,
To the house which none leave who have entered it,
On the road from which there is no way back,
To the house wherein the dwellers are bereft of light,
Where dust is their fare and clay their food.
They are clothed like birds, with wings for garments,
And see no light, residing in darkness.'  [16]

Enkidu then falls sick and dies, and we have a vivid description of the
grief of Gilgamesh and the mourning ritual which he performs for his friend,
reminding one of the mourning rites performed by Achilles for Patroclus.
There is a suggestion in the Epic here that death is a new and dreadful
experience. Gilgamesh is represented as dreading that he must become like
Enkidu,

'When 1 die, shall I not be like Enkidu?
Woe has entered my belly.
Fearing death, I roam over the steppe.'

He resolves to go in search of immortality, and the account of his
adventures during the search constitutes the next section of the Epic.
Gilgamesh is aware that his ancestor Utnapishtim is the only mortal who has
acquired immortality, and he determines to find him in order to learn from
him the secrets of death and life. At the outset of his journey he comes to
the foot of the mountain range called Mashu, the entrance to which is
guarded by a scorpion-man and his wife. The scorpion-man tells him that no
mortal has ever crossed the mountain and braved its dangers, but when
Gilgamesh discloses the object of his journey, the guardian lets him pass,
and he travels along the sun's road. For twelve leagues he journeys in
darkness until he reaches Shamash, the sun-god. Shamash tells him that his
quest is vain,

'Gilgamesh, whither rovest thou,
The life you pursue you shall not find.'

But he will not be dissuaded and goes on his way. He then comes to the shore
of the sea and the waters of death. There he finds another guardian, the
goddess Siduri, the ale-wife; she too endeavours to dissuade him from
attempting to cross the deadly sea, and tells him that none but Shamash can
cross that sea. She tells him to enjoy life while he may in words that
strangely resemble the words of the Master of assemblies in Eccl. 9:7-9

'Gilgamesh, whither rove you?
The life you pursue you shall not find.
When the gods created mankind,
Death for mankind they set aside,
Life in their own hands retaining.
You, Gilgamesh, let full be your belly,
Make you merry by day and by night.
Of each day make you a feast of rejoicing,
Day and night dance you and play.
Let your garments be sparkling and fresh,
Your head be washed, bathe you in water.
Pay heed to the little one that holds your hand,
Let your spouse delight in thy bosom,
For this is the task of mankind.'  [17]

It is hard to resist the conclusion that the late Hebrew moralist was
acquainted with this passage in the Epic.

But the hero refuses to listen to Siduri with her jug of ale, and pushes on
towards the last stage of his perilous journey. By the shore he meets
Urshanabi who had been the steersman of Utnapishtim's boat, and commands him
to ferry him across the waters of death. Urshanabi tells him that he must go
into the forest and cut down 120 poles each sixty cubits long. He is to use
these as punt poles letting each drop as he uses it, so as not to touch the
fatal waters of death. He follows Urshanabi's advice, and comes at last to
Utnapishtim's dwelling-place. He immediately begs Utnapishtim to tell him
how he has attained to the immortality which he himself is so eagerly
seeking. In answer his ancestor tells him the story of the Flood, as we have
already seen, and confirms what the scorpion-man, Shamash, and Siduri have
already told him, that the gods have reserved immortality for themselves and
have decreed death as the lot of mankind. Utnapishtim shows Gilgamesh that
he cannot even resist sleep, much less the final sleep of death. As
Gilgamesh prepares to depart disappointed, Utnapishtim, as a parting gift,
tells him of a plant which has the property of making the old young again,
but in order to get it he will have to dive to the bottom of the sea.

Gilgamesh does so and brings up the wonder-working plant. On his way back to
Erech he stops by a pool to bathe and change his clothes; while he is doing
this a serpent smells the odour of the plant and carries it off, sloughing
its skin as it goes. This feature of the story is clearly an aetiological
myth explaining why the serpent is able to renew its life by casting its old
skin. So the quest has failed, and the episode closes with the picture of
Gilgamesh sitting by the shore and lamenting his misfortune. He returns
empty-handed to Erech, and here the epic probably ended. But, in the form in
which we have it now, an additional tablet has been appended, making the
twelfth and final tablet. It has been shown by Professors Gadd and Kramer
that this tablet is a direct translation from the Sumerian. It has also been
shown that the beginning of the tablet is a continuation of another episode
in the complex of Gilgamesh myths. This is the myth of Gilgamesh and the
Huluppu-tree. It is evidently an aetiological myth explaining the origin of
the sacred drum, the pukku, and its ritual use. According to this myth,
Inanna, who is Ishtar, had taken a huluppu-tree from the banks of the
Euphrates, and planted it in her garden, intending to make her bed and chair
from its wood. When hostile forces prevented her from carrying out her
purpose, Gilgamesh came to her help. In gratitude she gave him a pukku and a
mikku made from the base and crown of the tree respectively. These two
objects have been interpreted by scholars as a magic drum and a magic
drum-stick. It may be remarked in passing that the big Lilissu-drum and its
drum-sticks played an important part in Akkadian ritual; the description of
its making and the rituals which accompanied it is given in Thureau-Dangin's
Rituels accadiens. Smaller drums were also used in Akkadian ritual, and the
pukku may have been such a drum.

Tablet twelve opens with Gilgamesh lamenting the loss of his pukku and his
mikku, which have somehow disappeared into the underworld. Enkidu undertakes
to go down into the underworld and recover the lost objects. Gilgamesh
advises him as to the observance of certain rules of behaviour in order that
he may not be seized and held there. Enkidu breaks all these rules and is
seized and held in the underworld. Gilgamesh then appeals to Enlil for help,
in vain, then to Sin, also in vain, and finally to Ea who tells Nergal to
make a hole in the ground to allow the spirit of Enkidu to ascend.

'The spirit of Enkidu,
like a wind-puff,
issued forth from the nether world.'

Gilgamesh begs Enkidu to describe the order of the underworld and the state
of the dwellers therein. Enkidu tells Gilgamesh that the body which he has
loved and embraced is devoured by vermin and filled with dust. Gilgamesh
throws himself on the ground and weeps. The last part of the tablet is badly
mutilated, but it appears to describe the difference between the lot in the
underworld of those who have received proper funeral rites and the miserable
state of those who have not.

Here the Gilgamesh cycle ends. It clearly embodies a mass of early Sumerian
and Akkadian myth and folklore. Some of the myths contained in it come under
the head of ritual myths, while several are intended to explain various
elements in Mesopotamian beliefs and practices. Underlying the epic as a
whole is the theme which underlies several other Akkadian myths, the plaint
of the human spirit before the fact of death and the loss of immortality.

The Myth of Adapa

The same theme underlies another myth which seems to have been popular
beyond the limits of Mesopotamia, since a fragment of it was found among the
Amarna archives in Egypt. The name of its hero, Adapa, has been equated by
the Assyriologist, Ebeling, with the Hebrew name Adam, so that it may be
regarded as a myth about the first man.

Adapa, according to the myth, was the son of Ea, the god of wisdom. He was
priest-king of Eridu, the oldest of the Babylonian cities. Ea had created
him 'as the model of man', and had given him wisdom, but not eternal life.
His priestly duties are described, and one of these was to provide fish for
the table of the gods. One day he was fishing when the South Wind blew and
overturned his boat. In rage he broke the wing of the South Wind so that it
did not blow for seven days. Anu the high god observed this, and sent his
messenger, Ilabrat, to inquire the reason for it. Ilabrat came back and told
Anu what Adapa had done. Anu then ordered Adapa to be brought before him.
Ea, 'he who knows what pertains to heaven', gave his son advice as to how he
should proceed on approaching Anu. He told Adapa to put on mourning apparel
and appear with hair disordered. When he reached the gate of heaven he would
find it guarded by two gods, Tammuz and Ningizzida. They would ask him what
he wanted and why he was in mourning. He was to reply that he was in
mourning for two gods who had disappeared from the land, and when they asked
him who these gods were, he was to reply, Tammuz and Ningizzida. Flattered
by this they would speak favourably to Anu on his behalf and introduce him
into the presence of the high god. But Ea warned his son that when he came
before Anu, he would be offered bread of death and water of death; these he
must refuse. He would also be offered a garment and anointing oil, which he
might accept. All these injunctions he was to observe with care.

Everything fell out as Ea had foretold, Adapa gained the favour of the gods
who guarded the gate, and was brought before Anu who regarded him with
favour and accepted his explanation of what had happened to the South Wind.
Then. Anu asked the assembled gods what should be done for Adapa, and,
presumably with the intention of conferring immortality upon him, ordered
bread of life and water of life to be offered to him. Adapa, obeying his
father's orders, refused them, but put on the garment which was offered to
him, and anointed himself with the oil which they gave him. Thereupon Anu
laughed and asked Adapa why he had acted so strangely. When Adapa explained
that it was by the advice of his father, Ea, that he had refused what was
offered to him, Anu tells him that by his act he has deprived himself of the
gift of immortality. The end of the tablet is broken, but it seems that Anu
sent Adapa back to earth with certain privileges and disabilities. Eridu was
to be freed from feudal obligations, and special dignity was conferred upon
its priesthood; but misfortune and disease were to be the lot of mankind,
allayed, however, by the ministrations of Ninkarrak, the goddess of healing.

There are various points of interest in this remarkable myth. As frequently
in these myths, the loss of immortality is ascribed to the jealousy of one
or other of the gods, and the belief is expressed that the gods have
reserved immortality for themselves. We also see from this myth that the
disappearance of Tammuz is a recurrent element in Semitic mythology. It may
be possible to see in the garment which is provided for the hero by the gods
a link with the feature in the Hebrew story of the Fall in which Yahweh
provides Adam and Eve with garments of skin. There is also the aetiological
element explaining the origin of the special exemption from feudal dues
enjoyed by the ancient priesthood of Eridu.

The Myth of Etana and the Eagle

Many of the Mesopotamian cylinder seals represent scenes which seem to be
concerned with incidents in the myths. Several of them have been thought to
represent the exploits of Gilgamesh, but very few of them can be identified
with any certainty. There is a special interest. in the fact that the myth
of Etana can be identified with certainty as depicted on an early seal. [18]
In the early Sumerian king-lists the first dynasty after the Flood is the
legendary dynasty of Kish, and the thirteenth king of Kish is listed as
Etana the shepherd, who ascended to heaven. The seal represents a figure
rising from the ground on the back of an eagle, while sheep graze, and two
dogs gaze up at the ascending figure.

The motive of several of the myths already dealt with recurs in a different
form in the myth of Etana, in this instance connected with birth instead of
death. In the course of transmission the myth has become interwoven with a
folk-story of the eagle and the serpent. The myth opens with a description
of the state of mankind after the Flood, without the guidance and
shepherding of a king. The insignia of kinship, the sceptre, crown, tiara,
and shepherd's crook are laid up before Anu in heaven. Then the great
Anunnaki, the deciders of destiny, decide that kingship shall be sent down
from heaven. It is apparently to be inferred that Etana is the appointed
king. But in order to secure the permanence of the kingship an heir was
necessary, and Etana has no son. We are shown Etana daily offering
sacrifices to Shamash and beseeching the god to grant him an heir. He cries
to Shamash, 'O Lord, may it issue from thy mouth, grant me the plant of
birth, show me the plant of birth, remove my burden, and produce for me a
name: Shamash tells the king to cross the mountain, there he will find a pit
and in the pit an eagle imprisoned., He is to free the eagle, and the eagle
will guide him to the plant of birth.

Here the myth introduces the folk-story of the eagle and the serpent.
According to the story, at the beginning of things the eagle and the serpent
had sworn a solemn oath of friendship. The eagle had his nest and his young
in the top of a tree, while the serpent and his young lived at its base.
They undertook to protect and provide food for each other's young. For a
time all went well. But the eagle conceived evil in his heart, and broke his
oath; while the serpent was away hunting, the eagle devoured the serpent's
young. When the serpent returned and found his home desolate, he appealed to
Shamash for vengeance against the oath-breaker. Shamash showed him how to
snare the eagle, break his wings, and imprison him in a pit. Here the eagle
lay, miserably crying in vain to Shamash for help. Here, directed by
Shamash, Etana enters, and delivers the eagle, who, in gratitude for his
help, promises to carry him up to the throne of Ishtar from whom he may
obtain the plant of birth. This is the point of the story depicted by the
cylinder seal. The myth vividly describes the stages of the ascent, as the
landscape diminishes and disappears. In the middle of the description of the
descent the tablet breaks off; but as the king-list gives the name of
Etana's son and successor, the myth presumably had a fortunate ending.

It may be remarked that the folk-tale of the eagle and the serpent contains
one of the oldest elements of that type of literature. It represents the
youngest of the eagle's children as possessing wisdom, and warning his
father against the danger of breaking his oath. The myth also suggests an
underlying birth ritual, just as traces of funerary rituals appear in the
Gilgamesh Epic.

The Myth of Zu

This is another of the few myths which have an identifiable pictorial
representation on cylinder seals." The myth also represents another aspect
of the theme of life and death which we have already seen so frequently
recurring in the Akkadian myths. Zu is shown on the seals as a bird-like
figure. Frankfort calls him a bird-man, but he is rather to be regarded as
one of the lesser deities, possibly an underworld god, who, like the
monstrous offspring of Tiamat, is an enemy of the high gods. His name
frequently occurs in ritual texts, and always as in conflict with the great
gods. Another theme of this myth, also found in the myth of Etana, is the
importance and sacral character of Akkadian kingship.

The myth, in the mutilated form in which we have it, begins with the
announcement that Zu has stolen the tablets of destiny which are the
insignia of kinship. We have already seen in the Epic of Creation that
Marduk wrested from Kingu the tablets of destiny and thereby established his
supremacy among the gods. Zu is said to have stolen them from Enlil while he
was washing, and to have flown away to his mountain. There is dismay in
heaven, and the gods deliberate in council as to who shall be entrusted with
the task of vanquishing Zu and recovering the tablets. The whole scene
closely resembles the similar scene in the Epic of Creation. Various gods
are invoked, but decline the task, and finally it appears that Lugalbanda,
the father of Gilgamesh, undertook the mission and slew Zu and regained
possession of the tablets. In a hymn of Ashurbanipal we find Marduk named as
the god 'who crushed the skull of Zu'.

In one of the texts known as ritual commentaries, a footrace is mentioned as
forming part of the ritual of the Babylonian New Year Festival, and the race
is explained as signifying the conquest of Zu by Ninurta.

In the ritual of making the sacred lilissu-drum, translated by
Thureau-Dangin in his Rituels accadiens, the slaying of a black bull takes
place, and before the bull is slain the priest utters a spell into each ear
of the bull. In the incantation whispered into the right ear of the bull,
the victim is addressed as: 'Great Bull that treads the celestial herbage',
while in the other ear he is addressed as 'Spawn of Zu'. Hence it is clear
that this curious myth played an important part in the ritual traditions of
Babylon.

Before we leave the subject of the Akkadian myths one more short but
interesting myth may be added. It may serve as an illustration of the way in
which myth material might be taken up and used in apotropaic incantations
and exorcisms. The Tammuz myth was widely used in this way, and in the
example here given the myth of Creation is used.

The Worm and the Toothache

The Babylonians believed that the various diseases to which the inhabitants
of the delta were subject were due to the attacks of evil spirits, or to the
malice of wizards or witches. Hence while such remedies as were known were
used in the treatment of bodily ailments, the treatment was always
accompanied by the recitation of one or more incantations. The colophon at
the end of this incantation says that it should be repeated three times over
the sufferer after the prescribed treatment has been applied. The
translation here given is Speiser's in The Ancient Near Eastern Texts, p
100:

After Anu had created heaven,
Heaven had created the earth,
The earth had created the rivers,
The rivers had created the canals,
The canals had created the marsh,
And the marsh had created the worm,
The worm went weeping before Shamash,
His tears flowing before Ea:
'What will you give me for my food? What wilt thou give me for my sucking?'
'I shall give you the ripe fig,'
And the apricot.'
'Of what use are they to me, the ripe fig And the apricot?
Lift me up and among the teeth And the gums cause me to dwell!
The blood of the tooth will I suck,
And of the gum I will gnaw Its roots!'

Fix the pin and seize its foot.*
'Because you have said this, O worm !
May Ea smite you with the might Of his hand!'

Egyptian Mythology

While there are certain underlying resemblances between the mythology of
Egypt and that of Sumer and Akkad, the differences are more striking and
important. There is a superficial resemblance between the physical
conditions under which the two civilizations developed their mythology. Both

Preface

The purpose of this book is to give some account of the mythology of the ancient Near East. During the last fifty years the labours of archaeologists have revealed the rich stores of documents, tablets, and inscriptions buried in the ruined sites of the ancient cities of Egypt, Sumer, Assyria, Babylonia, Asia Minor, and Syria. The decipherment and translation of cuneiform and Hittite texts have made available to students a new and surprising amount of mythological material, throwing fresh light on the whole field of myth. An attempt is here made to describe and give examples of this new material. We have also ventured to offer a classification of myths from the functional point of view. A discussion of the place of myth in Christianity has been included in this study because of its direct connexion with the use of myth in the religion of Israel.

Introduction

Since there is a considerable amount of ambiguity in the meaning and use of the term 'myth', it is desirable that something should be said about its use in this book. The usual distinction drawn between myth, legend, saga, folk story, and Marchen is based upon literary criteria; a further current usage distinguishes between myth and historical truth, with the implication that anything which is characterized as a myth is unworthy of belief. The criterion used in this study is neither literary, nor historical, but functional. The myth is a product of human imagination arising out ,of a definite situation and intended to do something. Hence the right question to ask about the myth is not, 'Is it true?' but 'What is it intended to do?'

In studying the very varied mythological material yielded by the ancient Near East, and using the notion of 'function' as a criterion, it is possible to distinguish the following types of myth (Next Section).

-----------------------------------

Types Of Myth

The Ritual Myth

It is a well-established fact that most of the texts from which our knowledge of the myths here described is taken have been found in temple archives. They imply the existence in the river-valleys of the Nile and the Tigris-Euphrates of a highly developed urban civilization resting on an agricultural basis. These texts show that the dwellers in Egypt and Mesopotamia had created an elaborate pattern of activities, to which we give the name of ritual. These activities were carried on by large staffs of priests in the temples. They constituted a system of actions performed in a fixed way, at regular times, by authorized persons who possessed the specialized knowledge of the correct way in which these actions should be carried out. The whole elaborate pattern of activities was designed to secure the well-being of the community by controlling the incalculable forces by which man found himself surrounded. But we now know that the ritual did not consist only of actions; the actions were accompanied by spoken words, chants, and incantations, whose magical efficacy was an essential part of the ritual. In other words, the ritual consisted of the part which was done, which the Greeks called the dromenon, and the spoken part, which they called the muthos, or myth. In the ritual the myth told the story of what was being enacted; it described a situation; but the story was not told to amuse an audience; it was a word of power. The repetition of the magic words had power to bring about, or recreate, the situation which they described. We shall see later that, at a central point in the Babylonian New Year Festival, the priests recited the chant called Enuma elish, which was the myth of Creation; and the recitation did something; it brought about a change in the situation which the ritual was enacting.

Thus we may understand that in a society where such rituals formed an essential part of the life of the community, the historical truth of the story contained in the myth was irrelevant. The function of history is to find out and to record as accurately as possible the behaviour of communities in the past, i.e., to discover and impart a certain kind of knowledge. The function of the myth was not knowledge but action, action essential for the very existence of the community. Mankind has in the past existed for vast periods of time without feeling any need for history; but, long before the appearance of the earliest forms of historical records, the myth had a vital function in the life of the community; as an essential part of ritual it helped to secure, those conditions upon which the life of the community depended.

This is why we have called this type of myth the ritual myth. It takes its name from its function, which is to aid in securing the efficacy of the ritual. It is possible that this was the earliest type of myth to come into existence.

The Myth of Origin

This type of myth is more generally called the aetiological myth. This myth is also very early; some scholars would regard it as the earliest. Its function is to give an imaginary explanation of the origin of a custom, a name, or even an object. For example, we shall see that the Sumerian myth of Enlil and the Pickaxe is a story intended to explain how that most valuable agricultural implement came into existence through the activity of a god. Another example is the Hebrew myth of Jacob's conflict with a supernatural being. This story offers an explanation of an ancient Israelite food-tabu.

The Cult Myth

In the development of the religion of Israel a new use of myth makes its appearance. The three seasonal festivals prescribed in the Book of the Covenant were celebrated at the various local shrines, such as Bethel, Shechem, and Shiloh, during the early stages of Israel's settlement in Canaan. Offerings were brought, and each of the festivals, Passover, Pentecost or the Feast of Weeks, and Tabernacles, had its own special ritual, preserved and carried out by the priests at the local shrines. On these occasions an important part of the ritual consisted in the public recitation by the priests of certain central events in the history of Israel; the recitation was accompanied by antiphonal responses from the people. One of the most deeply rooted traditions of Israel was that of the deliverance of the people from Egyptian bondage. At the Feast of Passover this event was celebrated with a ritual whose origin was far older than the historical event thus commemorated. Accompanying the ritual was the cult myth describing the event, not in historical terms, but in terms borrowed in part from Babylonian and Canaanite-myth. The function of the cult myth was to confirm the covenant relation between Yahweh and Israel, and to magnify the power and glory of Yahweh. In this new use of the myth it was divested of the magical potency which it had possessed in the ritual myth. We can see the cult myth still further developed in the prophetic use of it as a means of presenting the conception of 'salvation-history' to Israel. The myth still describes a situation, and still has the function of securing the continuance of the situation, no longer by magical, but by moral force. The function of the myth has been lifted to a higher plane in the cult myth as we see it employed by the prophets of Israel.

The Prestige Myth

There is a form of the myth, distinct from any of the foregoing, which calls for notice. Its function is to invest the birth and exploits of a popular hero with an aura of mystery and wonder. While the story of the birth and exposure of Moses in an ark of bulrushes. on the Nile may ' rest upon historical tradition, it can be paralleled by similar stories relating to Sargon, Cyrus, Romulus and Remus, and other heroes of popular imagination. The birth and exploits of the Danite hero, Samson, are related in mythical terms intended to glorify the tribe of Dan and its hero. It may be remarked in passing that the attempt to find a sun-myth in the story of Samson is generally discredited. The stories of the exploits of Elijah and Elisha fall into the same category, although in this case the motive of magnifying the glory of Yahweh is also present. Prestige myths also tend to gather round the names of famous cities. Troy is built by the hands of gods, and even Zion is described in mythical terms borrowed from Babylonian and Canaanite mythology as being built 'on the sides of the north', the expression used in those myths to describe the abode of the gods.

The Eschatological Myth

Although it may owe something to the eschatology of Zoroastrianism, the eschatological myth is specially characteristic of Jewish and Christian thought. In the writings of the prophets, and above all in the apocalyptic literature, the conception of a catastrophic end of the present world-order has a prominent place. The prophets believed that the 'salvation-history' must have its consummation in a decisive divine intervention. 'It shall come to pass in the last days' is a characteristic phrase in the prophetic vocabulary. When the prophets attempt to describe the final situation they have to fall back on the language of myth. The description of the conquest of the chaos-dragon by Marduk in the Babylonian Epic of Creation supplies them with the imagery which they use to describe Yahweh's final victory over the forces of evil. Just as the divine act of creation lies outside the horizon of history and can only be described in the language of myth, so the divine act that brings history to a close can only be described in the same terms. The eschatological use of myth was carried over from Judaism into Christianity and appears in its fullest display in the Apocalypse of St John.

It may, perhaps, be necessary to say that the application of the category of myth to the Gospel narratives is in no way intended to call in question their essential historical veracity. But for those who believe, as the prophets of Israel and the first disciples of Jesus did, that God has entered into human history, there are certain moments in history when events take place whose causes and nature lie beyond the range of historical causation. Here the function of myth is to express in symbolical terms, by means of images, what cannot be otherwise put into human speech. Here myth has become an expansion of symbolism.

The Diffusion And Disintegration Of Myths

There are two ways in which the presence of myths in any society may be explained; one is by way of diffusion, and the other is through the independent working of imagination when confronted by similar situations. Usener's researches have shown that the myth of the Flood is to be found in almost every part of the world. We shall see when we come to deal with the Sumerian and Babylonian forms of the Flood myth that its presence in the region of the Tigris-Euphrates valley can be explained as due to the periodical occurrence there of disastrous floods. But when we find the Flood myth in countries where such floods are not possible, as in Greece or Canaan, for instance, it becomes clear that the myth has been brought there from the place of its origin, even if it is no longer possible to trace the method of diffusion. An example of the way in which myths might travel from their source is furnished by the discovery in Egypt of a cuneiform tablet containing the Babylonian myth of Adapa, with which we shall deal later. The tablet had been used by Egyptian scribes for the purpose of learning cuneiform. A similar instance occurred when a fragment of the myth of Gilgamesh was discovered during the American excavation of Megiddo. The legend of Cadmus tells us how the Phoenician alphabet was carried to Greece and became the parent of all our Western alphabets. Thus there are reasonable grounds for assuming that travel, trade movements, migrations of peoples, arid invasions were a means of diffusion by which myths might be carried from one country to another.

It can be observed that rituals decayed and disappeared, or were transformed with the decay of the civilization in which they had played such an important part. Then we find that the myths attached to the decaying rituals were freed from their ritual associations and became literary forms, passing into the traditions of other peoples. For example, the myth of the slaying of the dragon which is, as we shall see, a central element in the Babylonian myth of Creation has given birth to the legends of Perseus and  Andromeda, Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra, Siegfried and Fafnir, Beowulf and Grendel, and still survives in the mummers' play of St George and the Dragon.

Mesopotamian Myths

Chapter 1

Before we begin to give an account of the most important myths which have their origin in Mesopotamia, something should be said about the early cultural conditions out of which the myths which we are to examine came into existence in that part of the ancient Near East. Archaeological excavation of the sites of the ancient cities in the Tigris-Euphrates valley has shown that this region, known as Sumer and Akkad, was inhabited as early as 4,000 B.C. by a people known as the Sumerians. Some scholars are of the opinion that there are traces of an earlier settlement but it is certain that the fully developed civilization revealed by excavation of such sites as Ur, Erech, and Kish was the work of the Sumerians. They appear to have come into the delta from the mountainous region to the north-east of Mesopotamia, and their myths show that they came from a very different kind of country from that which they found in their new home. The form of writing called cuneiform was their invention, and it was they who built the strange temple-towers known as 'ziqqurats' which are such a characteristic feature of their cities.

Their language was of the type known as agglutinative, and its linguistic affiliations are uncertain. Their remains, as illustrated, for example, by Sir Leonard Woolley's excavation of Ur, show a highly developed civilization of an agricultural type, with splendid temples, priests, laws, literature, and a rich mythology. At an early date, but probably later than the Sumerian settlement of the delta of the Tigris-Euphrates, the first wave of Semitic invasion entered the region of Sumer and Akkad, gradually conquered the Sumerians, absorbed their culture, and adopted their cuneiform script, but not their language. The language of the Semitic invaders is known as Akkadian, and is one of the important branches of the great Semitic family of languages of which Arabic is the ancestor. The second wave of Semitic invasion by a people known as Amurru, or Amorites, resulted in the foundation of the first Amorite dynasty in Babylon, and the rise of Babylon under Hammurabi to the hegemony of Sumer and Akkad. The date of the first king of the Amorite dynasty has been assigned to about 2200 B.C. About 500 years later another Semitic people who had settled higher up the Tigris valley, between the upper and lower Zab, conquered Babylon and established the first Assyrian empire in Mesopotamia. Hence the mythology of Mesopotamia has come to us in Sumerian, Babylonian, and Assyrian forms, and while there is little difference between the Babylonian and Assyrian forms of any particular myth, there are very considerable differences between, for example, the Sumerian and the Assyro-Babylonian form of the Creation myth. Moreover, some curious Sumerian myths have no Semitic counterpart. We shall begin our account of Mesopotamian mythology with the Sumerian material.

Sumerian Myths

Among the great mass of mythological material which is now available through the devoted labours of Sumerologists, three types of myth appear whose distribution is so widespread that they might justly be called basic myths. It is clear that, although these three basic myths appear in Semitic mythology, their origin is Sumerian, hence we shall begin our account of Sumerian myths with them.

The Myth of Dumuzi and Inanna

The first of these myths has long been known as the descent of Ishtar into the underworld and existed in a fragmentary form; but as the result of Professor Kramer's skilled labours it is now known in a complete form as the myth of Dumuzi and Inanna. Dumuzi is the Sumerian form of the more familiar name Tammuz, while Inanna is similarly the Sumerian equivalent of the Semitic Ishtar, the queen of heaven. Dumuzi is the prototype of all the vegetation gods who die and rise again with the rebirth of vegetation in the spring. In the form of the myth underlying the Tammuz liturgies, the imprisonment of the god in the underworld is a principal motive of the myth and is the cause of Inanna's descent into the underworld. But in the earliest form of the myth as given by Kramer in The Ancient Near Eastern Texts relating to the Old Testament the reason for the descent of the goddess is not given. The form of the myth here related follows Kramer's version. [1]

For reasons unknown, Inanna, the queen of heaven, decides to go down into the nether world, the 'land of no return', ruled over by her sister, the goddess Ereshkigal. Kramer suggests that the motive may have been ambition, the desire to bring the nether world under her dominion. To provide against any disasters that may happen to her in the nether world, Inanna instructs her vizier, Ninshubur, that if she does not return in three days he is to perform mourning rites for her, and to go in turn to the three high gods, Enlil of Nippur, Nanna the moon-god of Ur, and Enki, the Babylonian god of wisdom, in Eridu, and entreat them to intervene on her behalf that she may not be put to death in the nether world.

Then Inanna puts on her queenly apparel and her jewels, and approaches the gate of the nether world. There she is challenged by Neti, the gate-keeper of the seven gates. By the orders of Ereshkigal and in accordance with the laws of the nether world, Inanna, as she passes through the seven gates, is stripped of an item of her apparel at each gate; she is brought before Ereshkigal and the Anunnaki, the seven judges of the nether world. They turn 'the eyes of death' upon her and she is turned into a corpse and hung upon a stake. After three days, as she does not return, Ninshubur does as he was directed by Inanna. Enlil and Nanna refuse to intervene, but Enki performs certain magical operations by which Inanna is restored to life. Out of dirt from his finger-nail he creates two strange creatures, the kurgarru and the kalaturru, the meaning of whose names is unknown, and sends them to the nether world with the food of life and the water of life. They are told to sprinkle the food of life and the water of life sixty times upon the corpse of Inanna. They do so and the goddess is restored to life. It is a law of the nether world that no one may return from thence without providing a substitute. Hence the myth goes on to describe the ascent of Inanna to the land of the living accompanied by demons who are to carry back to the nether world the substitute whom she provides. First Ninshubur, then Shara the god of Umma, and then Latarak the god of Badtibira are in turn claimed by the demons and rescued by Inanna.

Here the text as given in The Ancient Near Eastern Texts breaks off, but Kramer adds in a footnote to his introductory summary of the myth a surprising addition recently discovered. According to this fragment of the myth, Inanna and her escort of demons come to her own city of Erech and there find her husband Dumuzi. He does not humble himself before her as the other three had done, and she therefore hands him over to the demons to be carried off to the nether world. Dumuzi entreats Utu, the sun-god, to deliver him, and here the fragment breaks off. Hence we do not know whether, in the original Sumerian form of the myth, Dumuzi, who is Tammuz, was carried away by the demons into the nether world.

This is the first of the three basic myths referred to above in its Sumerian form. It is possible that the Sumerians brought the myth with them when they settled in the delta, and that this is its earliest form. In this form Inanna does not descend into the nether world to bring back her husband/brother Dumuzi, or Tammuz, from death. On the contrary and against all later conceptions of the myth, it is manna who allows the demons to carry off Dumuzi to the nether world as her substitute, while the reason for her own descent is left unexplained. Nevertheless, the Tammuz-liturgies [2] which belong to the Sumerian period already show the later form of the myth. They describe the chaos and desolation which fall upon the land when Tammuz goes down into the nether world; they describe Ishtar's lamentation and her descent into the nether world to rescue Tammuz from its powers; and they conclude with a description of the triumphant return of Tammuz to the land of the living.

It is also clear that the liturgies form part of a seasonal ritual, and hence that the myth may rightly be classed as a ritual myth. A possible reason for the change in the original form of the myth may be found in the fact that the Sumerians, incoming into the delta, were passing from a pastoral economy to an agricultural mode of life. In the liturgies Tammuz and Ishtar are frequently represented under the figure of the male and female fir-tree, and the fir-tree is not found in the Tigris-Euphrates delta, but belongs to the mountainous region from which the Sumerians came. Moreover, the fact that the towering 'ziqqurats' were a feature of Sumerian temple architecture has been held to point in the same direction. Hence the original form of the myth may have arisen under conditions of life which were very different from the agricultural mode of life which the Sumerians were obliged to adopt when they settled in the delta. There is evidence to show that Semites and Sumerians were both occupying the delta for a considerable time before the Amorite invasion and the final conquest and absorption of the Sumerians by the Semites. We know that the Semites took over from the Sumerians their cuneiform script and much of their religion and mythology, and this may well be accepted as a further explanation of the changed character of the Tammuz-Ishtar myth as we find it in the Assyro-Babylonian period. We shall see later what changes the myth underwent as it passed into other countries.

The Myth of Creation

The second basic myth which we find in a Sumerian form is the wide-spread myth of Creation. It may be remarked here that we do not find the conception of creation ex nihilo in any of the ancient myths of Creation. For all of these, creation is the act of bringing order out of an original state of chaos. When we come to deal with the Assyro-Babylonian material, we shall see that the cosmogonic myth existed there in one main form, the well-known Enuma Elish, or Epic of Creation, as it is now generally styled. But there is nothing corresponding to this in the Sumerian material. Professor Kramer has shown that Sumerian cosmogony has to be pieced together from various myths of origin, and the following account is based on his researches. He is, however, careful to remind us that there are great gaps in our knowledge of Sumerian, and that many of the tablets upon which the myths have been preserved are broken and incomplete. Hence, in the present state of our knowledge of Sumerian it is impossible to give a completely coherent account of Sumerian mythology.

For the sake of convenience the Sumerian myths of Creation may be arranged under three heads: the origin of the universe, the organization of the universe, and the creation of man.

The Origin of the Universe. In a tablet which contains a list of the Sumerian gods, the goddess Nammu, whose name is written with the ideogram for 'sea', is described as 'the mother who gave birth to heaven and earth'. From other myths it appears that heaven and earth were originally a mountain whose base was the earth and whose summit was heaven. Heaven was personified as the god An, and earth as the goddess Ki, and from their union was begotten the air-god Enlil, who then separated heaven from earth and brought the universe into being in the form of heaven and earth separated by air. Sumerian mythology gave no explanation of the origin of the primeval sea.

The Organization of the Universe.

This aspect of the creation motif is dealt with in a number of myths which describe how the heavenly bodies and all the various elements of Sumerian civilization came into being. The first of these myths is concerned with the birth of the moon-god, Nanna, or Sin. The details are far from clear, and further knowledge may modify them; but the outline of the myth seems to be that Enlil, the high god of the Sumerian pantheon, whose shrine was at Nippur, was enamoured of the goddess Ninlil and raped her as she was sailing on the stream Nunbirdu. For this high-handed act Enlil was banished to the underworld, but Ninlil, great with child, refused to be left behind, and insisted on following Enlil to the nether world. As this would have involved the birth of Ninlil's child Nanna, the moon-god, in the dark nether world instead of becoming the light of the sky, Enlil devised a complicated scheme by which Ninlil became the mother of the three deities of the nether world as substitutes for Nanna, who was thus enabled to ascend to heaven. It is clear that this curious and hitherto unknown myth gives a clue to the transformation of the Tammuz-Ishtar myth, of which we have already spoken. We can see from the Tammuz liturgies that Enlil is a frequent title of Tammuz, and similarly that Ninlil is a frequent designation of Ishtar; so that the descent of Ishtar into the nether world, which, as we have seen, is unexplained in the earliest form of the Sumerian myth of manna's descent into the nether world, finds an explanation in this myth of the birth of Nanna, the moon-god.

In the Sumerian pantheon the moon-god, Nanna, or Sin, was the chief astral deity, and the sun-god, Utu, was regarded as the offspring of Nanna and his consort Ningal. In the later Hebrew cosmogony the position was reversed and the sun became the major luminary, while the moon became female, as in classical mythology. The Sumerians conceived of Nanna as journeying through the night sky in a quffah, the circular boat used in the navigation of the Euphrates, accompanied by the stars and planets, whose origin is not explained.

After Enlil had separated heaven from earth, and the illumination of heaven had been provided in the forms of Nanna, Utu, and the stars and planets, the organization of the earthly part of the universe had to be undertaken, and various myths deal with the different elements of the terrestrial order.

It should be observed that, somewhat illogically, the cities and temples of the gods are thought of as existing before the creation of man, which comes at the end of the various divine activities involved in creating the order of the universe. Enlil is conceived of as the ultimate source of vegetation, cattle, agricultural implements, and the arts of civilization, though he brings these into being indirectly by the creation of lesser gods who carry out his instructions.

In order to provide cattle and grain for the earth, at the suggestion of Enki, the Babylonian Ea, the god of wisdom, Enlil creates two minor deities, Lahar, the cattle-god, and Ashman, the grain-goddess, to provide food and clothes for the gods. The myth describes the abundance which they create upon earth; but they drink wine and get drunk and begin to quarrel, neglecting their duties, so that the gods are unable to obtain what they need. In order to remedy this situation man is created. The following is Kramer's translation of part of the myth of Lahar and Ashman:

In those days, in the creation chamber of the gods,
In their house Dulkug, Lahar and Ashnan were fashioned;
The produce of Lahar and Ashnan,
The Anunnaki of the Dulkug eat, but remain unsated;
In their pure sheepfolds milk .... and good things,
The Anunnaki of the Dulkug drink, remain unsated;
For the sake of the good things in their pure sheepfolds,
Man was given breath.

In addition to myths relating to the provision of food and clothing, there are various myths dealing with other elements of civilization and the organization of the universe. A long poem, much of which is still obscure, describes the creation of the pickaxe by Enlil and the gift of this valuable implement to 'the black-headed people' to enable them to build their houses and cities. Another myth describes the activities of Enki in providing Sumer with the necessary elements of civilization. The myth describes how Enki, beginning with Sumer, journeys through different parts of the world, 'fixing the destinies', a Sumerian term meaning the creative activity of the gods in bringing order into the universe. First Enki visits Ur, then Meluhha, which might possibly signify Egypt, then the rivers Tigris and Euphrates which he fills with fishes, and then the Persian Gulf. Over each of these he appoints a god or goddess to take charge. A passage from Kramer's translation of this interesting myth will illustrate the nature of Enki's civilizing activities: [3]

The plough and the yoke he (Enki) directed,
The great prince Enki caused the ox to . . .;
To the pure crops he roared,
In the steadfast field he made grain grow;
The lord, the jewel and ornament of the plain,
The . . . farmer of Enlil,
Enkimdu, him of the canals and ditches,
Enki placed in their charge.
The lord called to the steadfast field,
he caused it to produce much grain,
Enki made it bring forth its small and large beans . . .
The . . . grains he heaped up for the granary,
Enki added granary to granary,
With Enlil he increases abundance in the land;
Her whose head is . . . whose face is.. .
The lady who . . . the might of the land, the steadfast support
of the black-headed people,
Ashnan, strength of all things,
Enki placed in charge.

Enki then goes on to place the brick-god, Kabta, in charge of the pick-axe and the brick-mould. He lays foundations and builds houses, and places them under the charge of Mushdamma, the 'great builder of Enlil'. He fills the plain with vegetable and animal, life, and places Sumuqan, 'king of the mountain', in charge. Lastly, Enki builds stables and sheepfolds and places them under the shepherd-god Dumuzi.

The last myth dealing with the organization of the universe to which we shall refer is concerned with the activities of the goddess manna, or Ishtar. We have already had occasion to refer to the expression 'fixing the destinies', and we shall see when we come to deal with Babylonian myths that an object called 'the tablet of destinies' plays an important part in several myths. The possession of it was one of the attributes of deity, and we hear of the tablets being stolen or taken by force on several occasions. The god who possessed them had the power of controlling the order of the universe. In the myth with which we are now dealing, Inanna wishes to confer the blessings of civilization upon her own city, Erech. In order to do this she must acquire the me, a Sumerian word which appears to denote the same power as that which is conferred by the possession of the Akkadian 'tablets of destiny'. The me are in the hands of Enki, the god of wisdom. Accordingly, Inanna journeys to Eridu, where Enki dwells in his house of the Apsu, the sweet-water abyss. Enki receives his daughter Inanna hospitably and makes a great feast for her. When he gets merry with wine he promises her all kinds of gifts, including the me, or divine decrees which, in Kramer's words, are 'the basis of the culture pattern of Sumerian civilization'. The myth contains a list of over a hundred items which constitute the elements of Sumerian civilization. Inanna receives the gifts with joy, and loads them on her bark, 'the boat of heaven', and sets sail for Erech. When Enki recovers from his orgy he realizes that the me are missing from their accustomed place. The mention of a place in which the me are kept suggests that they are in the form of tablets. On discovering his loss Enki sends his messenger Isimud with instructions to recover them. Seven times he attempts to do so, but each time he is foiled by Ninshubur, Inanna's vizier, of whom we have already heard. So the goddess brings to Erech the blessings of civilization. It will be noted that the various myths to which we have referred reflect the rivalry which existed between the various city-states of Sumer. The first items on the list of the me which Inanna obtained from Enki are those referring to lordship the crown, throne, and sceptre are mentioned, from which we may infer that the struggle for the hegemony of Sumer is one of the motives underlying these myths of the organization of the universe.

The Creation of Man.

We have already seen that the myth of Lahar and Ashnan ended up with the creation of man for the service of the gods.

Another myth, the text of which is difficult and broken, describes the way in which man was created. Although the Sumerian myth differs considerably from the account given in the Babylonian Epic of Creation, both versions agree in the object for which man was created, namely, for the service of the gods, to till the ground and free the gods from having to work for their living.

In the Sumerian myth the gods complain that they cannot get their food. Enki, the god of wisdom, to whom the gods generally resort in time of need, is asleep; but Nammu, the primeval ocean, the mother of the gods, arouses him from sleep. By Enki's instructions Nammu and Ninmah, the goddess of birth, assisted by deities, whom Kramer's rendering describes as 'good and princely fashioners', mix clay which is 'over the abyss' and bring man into existence.

The tablet is broken and the text is difficult and obscure, but some curious details emerge. Enki gives a banquet to the gods to celebrate the creation of man. Enki and Ninmah drink much wine and become drunk. Ninmah takes some of the clay which is 'over the abyss' and creates six different kinds of human beings whose nature is obscure, except in the case of the last two, which are the barren woman and the eunuch. Enki decrees the fate of the eunuch as destined to stand before the king. The myth goes on to describe a further act of creation by Enki. He creates a human being who is feeble in mind and body, and then asks Ninmah to do something to improve the condition of the miserable creature, but she is unable to do anything and curses Enki for making such a creature.

One of the Hebrew words for man is enosh, a root one meaning of which is 'weak' or 'sick'. This aspect of humanity is often emphasized in Hebrew poetry, and this curious element in the Sumerian myth may possibly underlie the Hebrew representation of man as failing to measure up to the place in the universe which the divine purpose had intended for him. We shall see later that important differences appear in the Babylonian myth of Creation which are not without significance in their influence on the Hebrew account of how man was created.

The Myth of the Flood

The third of the basic myths is the wide-spread myth of the Deluge. Usener's well-known work has shown that the myth of the destruction of mankind by a flood is to be found in some form or other in every part of the world, as we have already seen. The central motive of the myth is that the gods decide to destroy mankind; the means by which they do so is secondary, and we shall see that water is not the only means used. It has long been known that the Biblical story of the Deluge was based on the Babylonian myth which will be dealt with when we come to the next stage of our study. But that the Babylonian form of the myth was based on an earlier Sumerian version was not known until 1914, when the American scholar Arno Poebel published a fragment of a Sumerian tablet containing episodes of what was clearly the myth of the Flood. No further Sumerian tablets relating to the Flood have yet been discovered. The outlines of the Sumerian version of the Flood story are as follows. At the point where the fragment continues the story, a god appears to be declaring his intention of saving mankind from the destruction which the gods have decided to bring upon them. The reason for their decision is not given. Enki is the god who takes steps to save mankind from destruction. Apparently he instructs Ziusudra the pious king of Sippar to stand by a wall, through which he will reveal to Ziusudra the dire intention of the gods, and tell him what must be done to escape the coming flood. The part of the text which must have described the building of the boat is missing, but its existence is implied in the following passage which describes the Flood and Ziusudra's escape:

All the windstorms, exceedingly powerful, attacked as one,
At the same time, the flood sweeps over the cult-centres.
After, for seven days (and) seven nights,
The flood had swept over the land,
(And) the huge boat had been tossed about by the windstorms on the great waters,

Utu came forth, who sheds light on heaven (and) earth.
Ziusudra opened a window of the huge boat,
The hero Utu brought his rays into the giant boat.
Ziusudra, the king,
Prostrated himself before Utu,
The king kills an ox, slaughters a sheep.

Then, after a break, the tablet describes the ultimate fate of Ziusudra:

Ziusudra, the king,
Prostrated himself before Anu (and) Enlil.
Anu (and) Enlil cherished Ziusudra,
Life like (that of) a god they give him,
Breath eternal like (that of) a god they bring down for him.

Then, Ziusudra the king,
The preserver of the name of vegetation (and) of the seed of mankind,
in the land of crossing, the land of Dilmun, the place where the sun rises, they caused to dwell. [4]

It may be inferred from the Babylonian story of the Flood that the complete Sumerian version contained much fuller details about the cause of the flood and the building of the boat; but these may be left until we come to deal with the Akkadian mythology. The question whether the myth of the Flood, the third of our basic myths, can be classed with ritual myths, presents difficulties; but this, too, may be left until we have discussed the fuller form of the Flood myth, and its connexion with the Gilgamesh myth.

In addition to the three basic myths described above, there are a number of Sumerian myths which must be included in our account of what is perhaps, the oldest mythology in the world with the possible exception of the Egyptian one. It must also be borne in mind that our knowledge of Sumerian is still far from complete, and the meaning of many words in that language is uncertain; moreover, many of the tablets are in a fragmentary condition, and often extremely hard to read. Hence, while the account given here of the Sumerian myths rests upon the best contemporary scholarship, further research and fresh discoveries may well make changes and additions necessary in the future.

The Myth of Enki and Ninhursag

A myth which has no counterpart in Akkadian mythology, so far as our knowledge goes at present, and one which Kramer has described as one of the best preserved of the Sumerian myths, is the myth of Enki and Ninhursag. In The Ancient Near Eastern Texts it is described as a Paradise myth, and some of its features may underlie the Hebrew account of Paradise.

The outline of the myth is as follows: the scene is laid in Dilmun, described both as a land and a city, and identified by modern scholars with Bahrain in the Persian Gulf. The protagonists are the god Enki, the water-god, and the goddess Ninhursag, the earth-mother.

The myth begins with a description of Dilmun as a clean, pure, bright place, where the animals do not harm one another, and where there is no sickness nor old age. The only thing wanting in Dilmun is sweet water, and this is provided by Enki at Ninhursag's request.

The Myth then goes on to relate that from the union of Enki and Ninhursag is born Ninsar, or Ninmu, the goddess of plants. Ninhursag's period of gestation is described as lasting nine days, a day for each month of human gestation.

Enki then impregnates his daughter Ninsar, who gives birth to the goddess Ninkurra, and she, in turn, being impregnated by Enki gives birth to the goddess Uttu, also described as the goddess of plants. Her name must not be confused with the name of the sun god Utu.

Then Ninhursag warns Uttu against Enki, and gives her certain advice as to how she is to deal with Enki's approaches. Following the advice Uttu demands a present of cucumbers, apples, and grapes, possibly as wedding gifts. Enki brings the required gifts and is -joyfully received by Uttu; as the result of their union eight plants spring forth, but, before Ninhursag can assign them their names and qualities, Enki eats all the plants. Ninhursag, infuriated, curses Enki with a terrible curse and departs. The gods are dismayed, and Enki is stricken with sickness in eight different parts of his body. Through the craft of the fox, Ninhursag is induced to return and cure Enki of his sickness. She does this by creating in succession eight deities, one for each part of Enki's body in which the sickness is located. It has been pointed out that there is a punning relation between the name of each deity and the particular part of Enki's body affected. The closing lines of the poem seem to suggest that the eight deities are regarded as Enki's children, and their destiny is fixed by Ninhursag.

This curious myth does not seem to have any counterpart in the field of Near Eastern mythology, except in so far as the concept of a golden age in the past is wide-spread, and the incestuous relation between father and daughter finds an echo in the relation between Saturn and Vesta in Greek mythology, as Milton's lines remind us:

Thee bright-haired Vesta, long of yore
To solitary Saturn bore;
His daughter she, in Saturn's reign
Such mixture was not deemed a stain.

But we have no clue to the interpretation of the details of the myth. Professor Thorkild Jacobsen has said with regard to it, 'This myth endeavours to trace a causal unity among many disparate phenomena, but it is a unity causal in the mythopoeic sense only. When plants are seen as born of soil and water, we can still follow, although with reservations. Towards the end of the myth, however, the deities born that Enki may be healed have no intrinsic connexion either with soil who bears them, or with water.' [5] The myth does at least show that although the Babylonians borrowed much from Sumerian mythology, the Semitic mind found it difficult to accept many elements in that mythology.

The Myth of Dumuzi and Enkimdu

Another Sumerian myth is of interest as finding an echo in the Hebrew story of Cain and Abel, but without its tragic ending. It deals with the age-long rivalry between the agricultural and the pastoral modes of life. In the myth Inanna, or Ishtar, is about to choose a husband. The choice lies between the shepherd-god Dumuzi, or Tammuz, and the farmer-god Enkimdu.

Inanna's brother Utu, the sun-god, favours Dumuzi, but Inanna herself prefers Enkimdu. Dumuzi urges his suit and claims to have everything that Enkimdu can offer and more. Enkimdu endeavours to appease Dumuzi and offers him all kinds of gifts, but Dumuzi remains determined to have Inanna, and apparently succeeds in his intention, since, as we have already seen, various myths represent Dumuzi as the husband of Inanna. Kramer's rendering of the conclusion of the poem is worth quoting.

Enkimdu speaks:

'Thou, O shepherd, why dost thou start a quarrel?
O Shepherd Dumuzi, why dost thou start a quarrel?
Me with thee, O shepherd, me with thee why does thou compare?
Let thy sheep eat the grass of the earth,
In my meadowland let thy sheep pasture,
In the fields of Zabalam let them eat grass,
Let all thy folds drink the water of my river Unun.'

Dumuzi speaks:

'I, the shepherd, at my marriage do not enter, O farmer, as my friend,
O farmer, Enkimdu, as my friend, O farmer, as my friend, do not enter:

Enkimdu replies:

'Wheat I shall bring thee, beans I shall bring thee,
Beans of . . . I shall bring thee,
The maid Inanna (and) whatever is pleasing to thee,
The maid Inanna . . . I shall bring thee."  [6]

When we come to deal with Hebrew myths we shall see that various layers of older myths underlie the present form of the Cain and Abel myth, and it is possible that Dumuzi's rejection of all the farmer-god's gifts underlies Yahweh's rejection of Cain's agricultural offerings.

Gilgamesh Myths

An important figure in Akkadian mythology is the hero Gilgamesh, who is, according to the Gilgamesh Epic, two parts god, and one part man. But he also belongs to Sumerian mythology, and three Sumerian texts included in The Ancient Near Eastern Texts in Kramer's translation contain accounts of episodes in which Gilgamesh is concerned. It should be remarked here that in the Sumerian king-lists Gilgamesh is the fifth king of the dynasty of Erech, the second dynasty after the Flood according to Sumerian reckoning. The first of these texts, entitled 'Gilgamesh and Agga' in The Ancient Near Eastern Texts, reflects the struggles for domination between the early Sumerian city-states. It contains the story of the conflict between Gilgamesh of Erech and Agga the last king of the dynasty of Kish, the first dynasty after the Flood.

Much of the poem is obscure, but it seems to represent a demand by Agga for the submission of Erech, the resistance of the demand by Gilgamesh, the siege of Erech by Agga, and a final reconciliation of the two kings. There is no intervention of the gods, hence the text is not strictly speaking part of Sumerian mythology, and is only included here because of its evidence that the figure of Gilgamesh is derived from Sumerian sources.

The second text, entitled in The Ancient Near Eastern Texts 'Gilgamesh and the Land of the Living', clearly contains mythical material which was utilized in the composition of the Akkadian Epic of Gilgamesh, with which we shall deal later. Its theme is the search for immortality, a motive which underlies much of Near Eastern mythology. As the substance of this text has been taken up and more fully developed in the Akkadian Epic mentioned above, it need only be briefly summarized here. Oppressed by the all-pervasiveness of death, and conscious that he himself cannot escape it, Gilgamesh determines to find the Land of the Living. His friend and servant Enkidu, of whom we shall learn more in the Akkadian Epic, advises him to consult the sun-god Utu about his adventure. Utu at first warns him of its dangers, but afterwards helps him to cross the seven mountains and reach his goal which appears to be the cedar mountain where the giant Huwawa dwells. Gilgamesh and Enkidu, after some obscure preliminaries, cut off the giant's head. Here the tablet breaks off. The importance of the text lies chiefly in the fact that it shows the Sumerian preoccupation with the problem of death, and that it is the source from which the Babylonians drew the materials for the complete Gilgamesh story given in the Akkadian form of the myth.

The third Gilgamesh fragment, entitled in The Ancient Near Eastern Texts 'The Death of Gilgamesh', further develops the theme of death and the quest for immortality. Gilgamesh appears to have had a dream which is interpreted to him by the god Enlil as meaning that the gods have denied immortality to mankind, but that Gilgamesh has been granted fame, wealth, and success in battle. The second part of the poem appears to describe a funerary ritual, which may, as Kramer suggests, throw light on the significance of the death-chamber discovered by Sir Leonard Woolley in his excavation of Ur. The Sumerians may, like the ancient Egyptians, have immolated the wives and court attendants on the occasion of the death of a king; the text appears to imply that Gilgamesh has died, and ends with a paean in his praise.

Here we may leave the subject of Sumerian mythology, and pass on to the Akkadian, that is, the Assyro-Babylonian mythology, much of which is, as we have already pointed out, based on the Sumerian material.

It must be borne in mind that the Semitic conquerors of the Sumerians, while they adopted the Sumerian cuneiform script, adapted it to express a Semitic language (Akkadian) totally unlike Sumerian. Hence many of 'the gods of the Sumerian pantheon adopted by the Babylonians and Assyrians appear under Semitic names in the Akkadian mythology. Inanna becomes Ishtar, Utu becomes Shamash, the moon-god Nanna becomes Sin, although many of the names of the temples and ritual terms retain their Sumerian forms. Many of the prayers and incantations continued to be recited by the priests in Sumerian, which remained the language of religious ritual and liturgy long after it had ceased to be a spoken language, much as Latin continued, and still continues, to be the liturgical language of the Church. The Akkadian forms of Sumerian myths thus reflect both the altered political conditions of Semitic domination, and the different mentality of the Semitic conquerors.

Babylonian Myths

We have, for convenience, classed the myths described in this section as Babylonian, although many of the texts which contain them were written by Assyrian scribes and come from the library of the Assyrian king, Ashurbanipal. Professor Sidney. Smith has said:' 'It is certain that the Assyrian scribes were engaged in transforming the literature they borrowed from Babylonia from the style of the First Dynasty of Babylon to the form in which we find it in Ashurbanipal's library.' All the gods of Assyria were also worshipped in Babylonia, and the Assyrian religious festivals were celebrated at the same times and in the same way as those of Babylonia. There are a few myths or legends peculiar to Assyria, such as the legend of Sargon of Agade, which has a very curious history. But in the main the myths which we shall describe are of Babylonian provenance, and represent the Semitic transformation of earlier Sumerian material.

We shall begin by giving the Babylonian form of the three basic or type myths already described in the previous section:

The Descent of Ishtar into the Nether World

As in the Sumerian version, so also in the Babylonian form of the myth, no reason is given for Ishtar's descent into the nether world; but at the end of the poem, after Ishtar has been released, Tammuz is introduced as Ishtar's brother and lover, without any explanation of how he comes to be in the nether world. The lines that follow seem to imply the return of Tammuz to the land of the living with rejoicings. It is only from the Tammuz liturgies that we learn of the imprisonment of Tammuz in the underworld, and of the desolation caused by his absence from the land of the living. In the Babylonian version of the descent of Ishtar to the land of no return, we have a description of the failure of all sexual fertility caused by her absence: 'the bull springs not upon the cow; the ass impregnates not the jenny; in the street the man impregnates not the maiden.' e It is with these words that Papsukkal, the vizier of the great gods, announces the non-return of Ishtar and its consequences. The description of the descent of the goddess follows the Sumerian version in its main outlines; but there are some interesting differences. When Ishtar knocks at the gate of the underworld she threatens to batter down the gate if she is not admitted, and to set free the dead who are in the underworld. A vivid passage of the poem describes this scene:

O gatekeeper, open your gate,
Open your gate that I may enter!
If you open not the gate so that I cannot enter,
I will smash the door, I will shatter the bolt,
I will smash the doorpost, I will move the doors,
I will raise up the dead, eating the living,
So that the dead will outnumber the living. [9]

Ishtar, in this version of the myth, is a much more hostile and threatening figure than she is in the Sumerian version. We also find in Ishtar's threat to let loose the dead upon the living an illustration of the Babylonian fear of ghosts which was such a marked feature of their religion and appears in so many of their incantations. As Ishtar passes through the seven gates she is stripped of some part of her apparel at each gate, as in the Sumerian version. The Babylonian version omits the grim description of her being turned into a corpse by the baleful 'eyes of death' however, she does not return, and then follows Papsukkal's appeal to the great gods quoted above. In answer to this appeal Ea, who is Enki in the Sumerian version, creates Asushunamir the eunuch, and sends him down to induce Ereshkigal to give him the life-water bag. By his charm he succeeds in doing this, and Ereshkigal reluctantly orders her vizier Namtar to sprinkle Ishtar with the water of life. Ishtar is released and returns, receiving back those articles of adornment and apparel which had been taken from her as she passes through the seven gates on her return journey. But a reference is made to the ransom which she must pay. Ereshkigal says to Namtar, 'If she does not give you her ransom price, bring her back.' What this is to be is not specified, but the mention of Tammuz at the end of the myth seems to, imply his return from the underworld, although no indication has been given as to how he came there.

We have already seen that there is a Sumerian myth of Enlil's banishment to the underworld and of Inanna's accompanying him there, and reference has been made to the identification of Tammuz with Enlil in the liturgies. Hence it would seem that in the course of the development of the myth the descent of Tammuz into the underworld came to assume increasing importance, and to be related to the death and rebirth of vegetation. When, in the course of time, the myth was carried into other countries, it was the death of Tammuz and the mourning for him that came to be emphasized at the expense of other features of the myth. Thus we have a reference in Ezekiel [10] to the women of Israel weeping for Tammuz, and the myth of Venus and Adonis represents the form in which the myth had passed into Greek mythology.

Milton's reference to the river Adonis running 'purple to the sea, supposed with blood of Thammuz yearly wounded', is a reminder of the Syrian form of the myth, and we shall see that the death of Baal in the Ugaritic mythology may represent an earlier stage of the development of the myth in its passage to Syria.

The Creation Myth

We have seen that in the Sumerian version of the second basic myth, the myth of Creation, the creative activities are shared among various gods, Enlil and Enki being the principal figures concerned in creation. But in Babylonia the myth of Creation assumed central importance owing to the fact that it became associated with the great Babylonian New Year, or Akitu, Festival and was embodied in liturgical form in the poem or chant known from its opening words as Enuma elish, 'When on high'.

In this form of the myth the Babylonian god Marduk plays the principal part. It is he who conquers Tiamat, secures the tablets of destiny, and performs the various creative acts described in the poem. The seven tablets containing the myth were first discovered by the British excavation of Nineveh, and parts of them were translated and published by George Smith in 1876.

Over-hasty enthusiasts immediately made comparisons between the seven days of Creation in the Priestly account in Gen. 1 and the seven tablets of the Babylonian myth, and advanced the theory that the Hebrew form of the Creation story was entirely dependent on the Babylonian. We shall return to this point when we come to deal with Hebrew mythology. Since then, further portions  of the tablets have been discovered and some of the gaps in the first discovery have been filled. Most modern scholars assign the date of the composition to the beginning of the second millennium B.C., the period when Babylon was becoming the leading city of the Akkadian city states. We know from such portions of the Babylonian New Year liturgy as remain to us that at two points of the New Year Festival ritual the priests recited the Enuma elish with the force of a magical incantation.

The German excavation of the site of Ashur, the old capital of the Assyrian empire, brought to light the Assyrian version of the Enuma elish, in which the name of the Babylonian god Marduk was replaced by the name of Ashur the chief god of Assyria.

The outline of the myth in its Babylonian form is as follows:

Tablet one begins with a description of the primeval condition of the universe when nothing existed except Apsu, the sweet-water ocean, and Tiamat, the salt water ocean. From the union of these two the gods were brought into existence. The first pair, Lahmu and Lahamu (interpreted by Jacobsen [11] as the silt deposited at the junction of the sea and the rivers) gave birth to Anshar and Kishar, interpreted by the same scholar as the circular horizons of sky and earth. Anshar and Kishar in turn give birth to Anu, the sky, and Nudimmud or Ea, the earth - and water-god.

Here a break with the Sumerian tradition appears. Enlil, whose activities we have already seen in the Sumerian mythology, is replaced by Ea, or Enki, who appears in Babylonian mythology as the god of wisdom and the source of all magic. Ea then begets Marduk, the hero of the Babylonian form of the myth. But before the birth of Marduk we have an account of the first conflict between the primeval gods and those whom they have begotten. Tiamat and Apsu are disturbed by the noise of the younger gods and take counsel with Mummu, Apsu's vizier, how to destroy them. Tiamat is reluctant to destroy her offspring, but Apsu and Mummu devise a plan. Their intention is disclosed to the gods who are alarmed, but Ea, the all-wise, devises a counter-scheme; he casts a spell of sleep upon Apsu, slays him, binds Mummu and puts a cord in his nose. He then builds his sacred chamber and calls it 'Apsu', and rests in profound peace. In this chamber the birth of Marduk takes place, and a description of his beauty and tremendous strength follows. The first tablet ends with a description of the preparation for a renewed conflict between the primeval gods and the younger gods. Tiamat is reproached by her other children for having remained quiescent when Apsu was destroyed, and they succeed in stirring her up to take measures for the annihilation of Anu and his associates. She makes Kingu, her firstborn, the leader of the attack, arms him, and invests him with the tablets of destiny. She then begets a horde of monstrous beings, such as the scorpion-man and the centaur whom we find depicted on Babylonian seals and boundary-stones. She places Kingu at the head of this host, and prepares to avenge Apsu.

The second tablet describes how the news of the coming attack is received by the assembly of the gods. Anshar is troubled and smites his thigh in dismay. He first reminds Ea of his previous victory over Apsu and suggests that he should deal with Tiamat in the same way; but Ea either refuses to go or is unsuccessful; the text is broken at this point, and what happens to Ea is not clear. Then Anu is sent armed with the authority of the assembly of the gods to turn Tiamat from her purpose, but he also returns unsuccessful. Then Anshar rises in the assembly of the gods and proposes that Marduk, the strong hero, should be entrusted with the task. Marduk's father Ea advises him to accept the task, and Marduk agrees to undertake it on condition that he is given full and equal authority in the assembly of the gods, and that his word is to determine destiny unalterably. Here the second tablet ends.

The third tablet, after recapitulating the decision of the gods, ends with a feast at which Marduk is to be officially invested with the authority which he had demanded.

The fourth tablet begins with the enthronement of Marduk as king and his investment with the royal insignia. The gods require from him a proof that he possesses the power to carry out what he has undertaken. He thereupon causes his robe to disappear and then to reappear. The gods are satisfied and proclaim, 'Marduk is king.' Then Marduk arms himself for the combat; his weapons are bow and arrows, mace, lightning, and a net held at the corners by the four winds; he fills his body with flame, and creates the seven raging hurricanes; he mounts his storm-chariot, and advances against Tiamat and her host. He challenges Tiamat to single combat; he casts his net to enclose her, and when she opens her mouth to swallow him he drives in the evil wind to distend her and transfixes her with his arrow, splitting her heart. Her demon helpers flee, but are caught in the net and bound. Their leader, Kingu, also is caught and bound. Then Marduk takes from Kingu the tablets of destiny and fastens them upon his own breast, thus assuming supreme authority among the gods. His next act is to split the body of Tiamat in two; he places half of her above the earth as the sky, fixes it with bars, sets guards, and charges them not to let her waters escape. He then builds Esharra, the abode of the great gods, after the pattern of Ea's abode Apsu, and causes Anu, Enlil, and Ea to occupy their places therein. Here ends the fourth tablet.

The fifth tablet is too fragmentary to enable us to obtain from it a complete account of Marduk's first steps in organizing the universe, but its opening lines show that his first care was the calendar, one of the most important responsibilities of a Babylonian king. Marduk is represented as establishing the course of the year and the order of the months by the moon's changes. He also establishes the three celestial 'ways', the way of Enlil in the northern heavens, the way of Anu in the zenith, and the way of Ea in the south. The planet Jupiter is placed in charge of the heavenly order.

In the sixth tablet we have the description of the creation of man. Marduk declares his intention of creating man for the service of the gods. By the advice of Ea it is decided that the leader of the rebellion, Kingu, shall die that mankind may be fashioned. Accordingly Kingu is slain, and from his blood mankind is created for the service of the gods, 'to free them', that is, to perform the menial tasks belonging to the temple ritual and to provide food for the gods. Then the gods build a temple for Marduk, the great Esagila temple in Babylon with its ziqqurat. At the command of Anu they proclaim the fifty great names of Marduk, a proceeding which occupies the rest of the poem.

This is the outline of the Babylonian myth of creation, and the underlying Sumerian elements can easily be detected. But the elements which were scattered over a number of Sumerian myths have, in the Enuma elish, been brought together and welded into a coherent whole. We have no evidence that the various Sumerian myths ever formed part of a ritual. They can be explained, as Professor Thorkild Jacobsen has so ably done, on aetiological lines. But while the aetiological factor is still discernible in Enuma elish, the poem has now become a ritual myth; possessing magical potency, and playing a vital part in the Babylonian New Year Festival in connexion with the dramatic representation of the death and resurrection of the god.

The Myth of the Flood

The third of our basic myths is the myth of the Flood. In this case the somewhat fragmentary Sumerian myth has been considerably expanded in its Babylonian form and has been embedded in the Gilgamesh Epic. We shall deal with the Babylonian form of the saga of Gilgamesh later, but the Flood myth is linked up with the Gilgamesh Epic so as to form part of the adventures of its hero.

A mythological theme almost entirely absent from Sumerian mythology so far as we know it at present, but very prominent in Semitic mythology, is the problem of the existence of death and sickness, and the quest for immortality. In the Gilgamesh Epic the problem is forced upon Gilgamesh by the death of his companion Enkidu, of whom we shall hear more when we deal with the other parts of the Epic; but at present we are concerned with the connexion between the Epic and the Flood myth. After the description of Enkidu's death and the mourning of Gilgamesh for his companion, we are told that Gilgamesh is disturbed by the realization that he himself too must die,

'When I die, shall I not be like Enkidu?
Woe has entered my belly.
Fearing death, I roam over the steppe.'  [12]

The only mortal who is known to have escaped death and attained immortality is Gilgamesh's ancestor Utnapishtim, the Babylonian equivalent of Ziusudra, the Sumerian hero of the Flood. Gilgamesh therefore resolves to go in search of his ancestor in order to discover the secret of immortality. He receives various warnings of the difficulties and dangers of the journey. He is told before he can reach his goal he will have to cross the mountains of Mashu and the waters of death, a journey which only the god Shamash has ever accomplished. Nevertheless, he braves the dangers and reaches Utnapishtim at last. The text is broken at the point where the two meet, and when it becomes legible again Utnapishtim is telling Gilgamesh that the gods have reserved to themselves the secret of death and life. Gilgamesh then asks Utnapishtim how he has attained the possession of immortality, and in reply Utnapishtim tells him the story of the Flood. This is contained in the eleventh tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the longest and best preserved of the twelve tablets which comprise the Epic. That the myth was widely known in the ancient East is attested by the fact that Hittite and Hurrian fragments of the myth have been discovered.

Utnapishtim begins by telling Gilgamesh that the story which he is about to relate is 'a hidden matter, a secret of the gods'. He describes himself as a man of Shuruppak, most ancient of the cities of Akkad. Ea reveals to him through the wall of his reed-but that the gods have decided to destroy all the seed of life by a flood, though the reason for their decision is not given. Ea instructs Utnapishtim to build a ship into which he is to bring 'the seed of all living things'. The dimensions and shape of the ship are given, according to which it appears that the ship was to be a perfect cube. Utnapishtim asks Ea how he is to explain to the citizens of Shuruppak the reasons for his actions, and Ea tells him that he is to say that he has incurred the displeasure of Enlil and that he has been banished from Enlil's territory. He tells them,

'To the Deep I will therefore go down,
to dwell with my lord Ea.'

He further tells them that Enlil is about to shower down abundance upon them; so that they are completely deceived as to the god's real intentions. Then follows the account of the building of the ship and the loading of it:

'(Whatever I had) I laded upon her;
Whatever I had of silver I laded upon her;
Whatever I (had) of gold I laded upon her;
Whatever I had of all the living beings I (laded) upon her.
All my family and kin I made go aboard the ship.
The beasts of the field, the wild creatures of the field,
All the craftsmen I made go aboard.'  [13]

Then follows a vivid description of the storm. Adad thunders; Nergal tears down the doorposts of the gates that hold back the waters of the upper ocean; the Anunnaki lift up the torches, 'setting the land ablaze with their glare'. The gods themselves are alarmed and cower like dogs against the wall of heaven. Ishtar, who apparently had incited the gods to destroy mankind, lifts up her voice and bewails her action, while the rest of the gods weep with her. The storm rages for six days and nights. On the seventh day it subsides; Utnapishtim looks out and sees that the landscape is as level as a flat roof, and that 'all of mankind had returned to clay'. The ship grounds on Mt Nisir. Utnapishtim waits seven days, and then sends out a dove which returns having found no resting place. He then sends out a swallow which also returns. Finally he sends out a raven which finds food and does not return. Then he lets out all that are in the ship and offers sacrifice. The gods smell the sweet savour and gather like flies to the sacrifice.

Ishtar arrives, and lifts up her necklace of lapis-lazuli and swears by it never to forget what has happened. She upbraids Enlil for having caused the destruction of her people. Then Enlil arrives at the sacrifices and is furious that any one has been allowed to escape. Ninurta blames Ea for betraying the secret of the gods, and Ea expostulates with Enlil and intercedes for Utnapishtim. Enlil is appeased and blesses Utnapishtim and his wife and confers upon them immortality like the gods. He decrees that henceforth they shall dwell far away at the mouth of the rivers. There the account of the Flood ends, and the rest of the tablet, together with tablet twelve, belong to the Gilgamesh story, and will be dealt with later.

While excavations at various Mesopotamian sites have shown evidence for severe floods at Ur, Kish, and Erech, there is no evidence for a flood covering the whole country; and the severity and date of the floods differ for each of the above-mentioned cities. Nevertheless the myth undoubtedly rests upon the tradition of a flood of unusual severity, although, as its setting in the Gilgamesh Epic suggests, it has been linked up with funerary ritual and with the search for immortality. There is not, however, sufficient evidence to show that the Flood myth, like the Creation myth, became a ritual myth. We shall now describe the other Assyro-Babylonian myths which have been preserved in the various collections which the labours of archaeologists have made available in recent years.

The Epic of Gilgamesh

This very remarkable literary production in which, as we have already seen, the Flood myth is embedded, is partly myth and partly saga. It relates the adventures of a semi-mythical king of Erech who is named in the Sumerian king-lists as the fifth king of the first dynasty of Erech, and is said to have reigned 120 years. The work was extremely popular and widely distributed in the ancient Near East. Fragments of a Hittite translation have been found in the archives of Boghazkoy; also a fragment of a Hittite version. A fragment of the Akkadian version was found in the course of the American excavation of Megiddo.

Professor Speiser's words about the Epic are worth quoting.

'For the first time in the history of the world a profound experience on such a heroic scale has found expression in a noble style. The scope and sweep of the epic, and its sheer poetic power, give it a timeless appeal. In antiquity, the influence of the poem spread to various tongues and cultures.' [14]

The Akkadian version consisted of twelve tablets, of which most of the fragments come from the library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh. The longest and best preserved fragment is tablet eleven containing the account of the Flood, which we have already discussed. The Epic opens with a description of the strength and heroic qualities of Gilgamesh. The gods have created him of superhuman size and valour; he is said to be two-thirds god and one-third man. But the nobles of Erech complain to the gods that Gilgamesh, who should be the shepherd of his people, is behaving in an arrogant and tyrannical manner. They beg the gods to create a being like Gilgamesh, against whom he may measure his strength, so that they may have peace. Accordingly the goddess Aruru fashions from clay the figure of Enkidu, a wild human creature of the steppes, of surpassing strength. He feeds on grass, is friendly to the wild beasts and drinks with them at their watering-places. He destroys the hunter's snares and delivers the wild animals taken in them. When one of Gilgamesh's hunters brings the report to him of the nature and strange behaviour of this wild man of the steppes, Gilgamesh tells the hunter to take a temple-prostitute to the watering-place where Enkidu is wont to drink with the wild animals that she may exercise her wiles upon him. The hunter does as he was commanded, and the woman lies in wait for Enkidu until he comes to drink with the wild beasts at the watering place. When he comes she displays her charms before him, and he is seized with desire for her. After seven days of amorous delight Enkidu awakes from his trance and finds that a change has taken place in him. The wild beasts now flee from him in terror, and the woman says to him,

'You are wise, Enkidu, you have become like a god.'

She then tells him of the glories and delights of Erech, and of the strength and fame of Gilgamesh; she induces him to discard his clothing of skins, to shave and anoint himself, and leads him to Erech into the presence of Gilgamesh. Enkidu and Gilgamesh then engage in a trial of strength which ends in a compact of friendship. The two swear eternal comradeship. This ends the first episode of the Epic.

Here we are inevitably reminded of the theme of Genesis 3, where the serpent promises Adam that he will become wise and like God, knowing good and evil, if he partakes of the forbidden fruit.

It can hardly be doubted that the Epic in its present form is composed of various myths and folk-stories which have been brought together and artistically welded into a whole round the central figure of Gilgamesh.

The next episode relates the adventures of Gilgamesh and Enkidu as they set out to attack and slay the fire-breathing giant Huwawa, or, as his name is given in the Assyrian version, Humbaba. The purpose of the enterprise is, as Gilgamesh says to Enkidu, 'that all evil from the land we may banish'. It is possible that these stories of the adventures of Gilgamesh and his trusty comrade Enkidu may have helped to shape the Greek myth of the labours of Hercules, though some scholars deny this possibility. [15] In the Epic, Huwawa is represented as guarding the cedar  forests of the Amanus stretching six thousand leagues.

Enkidu endeavours to dissuade his friend from this perilous enterprise, but Gilgamesh is determined to attempt it, and, with the help of the gods, after a tremendous struggle they slay Huwawa and cut off his head. In the account of this episode the cedar forest is described as being the abode of the goddess Irnini, another name for Ishtar, and this forms the link with the next episode in the Epic.

When Gilgamesh returns in triumph from his victory, the goddess Ishtar is attracted by his beauty and tries to induce him to become her lover. He rejects her advances with insults, and reminds her of the miserable fate of all her previous lovers. Enraged by his rejection, the goddess begs Anu to avenge her by creating the Bull of heaven and sending him to ravage the kingdom of Gilgamesh. The bull is sent down and wreaks havoc among the people of Erech, but is ultimately slain by Enkidu. As the result of this act the gods meet in council and decide that Enkidu must die. Enkidu has a dream in which he sees himself carried off to the underworld and transformed by Nergal into a ghost. The dream contains a description of the Semitic conception of the underworld which is worth quoting

'He (the god) transformed me,
So that my arms were like those of a bird.
Looking at me, he leads me to the House of Darkness, The abode of Irkalla,
To the house which none leave who have entered it,
On the road from which there is no way back,
To the house wherein the dwellers are bereft of light,
Where dust is their fare and clay their food.
They are clothed like birds, with wings for garments,
And see no light, residing in darkness.'  [16]

Enkidu then falls sick and dies, and we have a vivid description of the grief of Gilgamesh and the mourning ritual which he performs for his friend, reminding one of the mourning rites performed by Achilles for Patroclus. There is a suggestion in the Epic here that death is a new and dreadful experience. Gilgamesh is represented as dreading that he must become like Enkidu,

'When 1 die, shall I not be like Enkidu?
Woe has entered my belly.
Fearing death, I roam over the steppe.'

He resolves to go in search of immortality, and the account of his adventures during the search constitutes the next section of the Epic. Gilgamesh is aware that his ancestor Utnapishtim is the only mortal who has acquired immortality, and he determines to find him in order to learn from him the secrets of death and life. At the outset of his journey he comes to the foot of the mountain range called Mashu, the entrance to which is guarded by a scorpion-man and his wife. The scorpion-man tells him that no mortal has ever crossed the mountain and braved its dangers, but when Gilgamesh discloses the object of his journey, the guardian lets him pass, and he travels along the sun's road. For twelve leagues he journeys in darkness until he reaches Shamash, the sun-god. Shamash tells him that his quest is vain,

'Gilgamesh, whither rovest thou,
The life you pursue you shall not find.'

But he will not be dissuaded and goes on his way. He then comes to the shore of the sea and the waters of death. There he finds another guardian, the goddess Siduri, the ale-wife; she too endeavours to dissuade him from attempting to cross the deadly sea, and tells him that none but Shamash can cross that sea. She tells him to enjoy life while he may in words that strangely resemble the words of the Master of assemblies in Eccl. 9:7-9

'Gilgamesh, whither rove you?
The life you pursue you shall not find.
When the gods created mankind,
Death for mankind they set aside,
Life in their own hands retaining.
You, Gilgamesh, let full be your belly,
Make you merry by day and by night.
Of each day make you a feast of rejoicing,
Day and night dance you and play.
Let your garments be sparkling and fresh,
Your head be washed, bathe you in water.
Pay heed to the little one that holds your hand,
Let your spouse delight in thy bosom,
For this is the task of mankind.'  [17]

It is hard to resist the conclusion that the late Hebrew moralist was acquainted with this passage in the Epic.

But the hero refuses to listen to Siduri with her jug of ale, and pushes on towards the last stage of his perilous journey. By the shore he meets Urshanabi who had been the steersman of Utnapishtim's boat, and commands him to ferry him across the waters of death. Urshanabi tells him that he must go into the forest and cut down 120 poles each sixty cubits long. He is to use these as punt poles letting each drop as he uses it, so as not to touch the fatal waters of death. He follows Urshanabi's advice, and comes at last to Utnapishtim's dwelling-place. He immediately begs Utnapishtim to tell him how he has attained to the immortality which he himself is so eagerly seeking. In answer his ancestor tells him the story of the Flood, as we have already seen, and confirms what the scorpion-man, Shamash, and Siduri have already told him, that the gods have reserved immortality for themselves and have decreed death as the lot of mankind. Utnapishtim shows Gilgamesh that he cannot even resist sleep, much less the final sleep of death. As Gilgamesh prepares to depart disappointed, Utnapishtim, as a parting gift, tells him of a plant which has the property of making the old young again, but in order to get it he will have to dive to the bottom of the sea.

Gilgamesh does so and brings up the wonder-working plant. On his way back to Erech he stops by a pool to bathe and change his clothes; while he is doing this a serpent smells the odour of the plant and carries it off, sloughing its skin as it goes. This feature of the story is clearly an aetiological myth explaining why the serpent is able to renew its life by casting its old skin. So the quest has failed, and the episode closes with the picture of Gilgamesh sitting by the shore and lamenting his misfortune. He returns empty-handed to Erech, and here the epic probably ended. But, in the form in which we have it now, an additional tablet has been appended, making the twelfth and final tablet. It has been shown by Professors Gadd and Kramer that this tablet is a direct translation from the Sumerian. It has also been shown that the beginning of the tablet is a continuation of another episode in the complex of Gilgamesh myths. This is the myth of Gilgamesh and the Huluppu-tree. It is evidently an aetiological myth explaining the origin of the sacred drum, the pukku, and its ritual use. According to this myth, Inanna, who is Ishtar, had taken a huluppu-tree from the banks of the Euphrates, and planted it in her garden, intending to make her bed and chair from its wood. When hostile forces prevented her from carrying out her purpose, Gilgamesh came to her help. In gratitude she gave him a pukku and a mikku made from the base and crown of the tree respectively. These two objects have been interpreted by scholars as a magic drum and a magic drum-stick. It may be remarked in passing that the big Lilissu-drum and its drum-sticks played an important part in Akkadian ritual; the description of its making and the rituals which accompanied it is given in Thureau-Dangin's Rituels accadiens. Smaller drums were also used in Akkadian ritual, and the pukku may have been such a drum.

Tablet twelve opens with Gilgamesh lamenting the loss of his pukku and his mikku, which have somehow disappeared into the underworld. Enkidu undertakes to go down into the underworld and recover the lost objects. Gilgamesh advises him as to the observance of certain rules of behaviour in order that he may not be seized and held there. Enkidu breaks all these rules and is seized and held in the underworld. Gilgamesh then appeals to Enlil for help, in vain, then to Sin, also in vain, and finally to Ea who tells Nergal to make a hole in the ground to allow the spirit of Enkidu to ascend.

'The spirit of Enkidu,
like a wind-puff,
issued forth from the nether world.'

Gilgamesh begs Enkidu to describe the order of the underworld and the state of the dwellers therein. Enkidu tells Gilgamesh that the body which he has loved and embraced is devoured by vermin and filled with dust. Gilgamesh throws himself on the ground and weeps. The last part of the tablet is badly mutilated, but it appears to describe the difference between the lot in the underworld of those who have received proper funeral rites and the miserable state of those who have not.

Here the Gilgamesh cycle ends. It clearly embodies a mass of early Sumerian and Akkadian myth and folklore. Some of the myths contained in it come under the head of ritual myths, while several are intended to explain various elements in Mesopotamian beliefs and practices. Underlying the epic as a whole is the theme which underlies several other Akkadian myths, the plaint of the human spirit before the fact of death and the loss of immortality.

The Myth of Adapa

The same theme underlies another myth which seems to have been popular beyond the limits of Mesopotamia, since a fragment of it was found among the Amarna archives in Egypt. The name of its hero, Adapa, has been equated by the Assyriologist, Ebeling, with the Hebrew name Adam, so that it may be regarded as a myth about the first man.

Adapa, according to the myth, was the son of Ea, the god of wisdom. He was priest-king of Eridu, the oldest of the Babylonian cities. Ea had created him 'as the model of man', and had given him wisdom, but not eternal life. His priestly duties are described, and one of these was to provide fish for the table of the gods. One day he was fishing when the South Wind blew and overturned his boat. In rage he broke the wing of the South Wind so that it did not blow for seven days. Anu the high god observed this, and sent his messenger, Ilabrat, to inquire the reason for it. Ilabrat came back and told Anu what Adapa had done. Anu then ordered Adapa to be brought before him. Ea, 'he who knows what pertains to heaven', gave his son advice as to how he should proceed on approaching Anu. He told Adapa to put on mourning apparel and appear with hair disordered. When he reached the gate of heaven he would find it guarded by two gods, Tammuz and Ningizzida. They would ask him what he wanted and why he was in mourning. He was to reply that he was in mourning for two gods who had disappeared from the land, and when they asked him who these gods were, he was to reply, Tammuz and Ningizzida. Flattered by this they would speak favourably to Anu on his behalf and introduce him into the presence of the high god. But Ea warned his son that when he came before Anu, he would be offered bread of death and water of death; these he must refuse. He would also be offered a garment and anointing oil, which he might accept. All these injunctions he was to observe with care.

Everything fell out as Ea had foretold, Adapa gained the favour of the gods who guarded the gate, and was brought before Anu who regarded him with favour and accepted his explanation of what had happened to the South Wind. Then. Anu asked the assembled gods what should be done for Adapa, and, presumably with the intention of conferring immortality upon him, ordered bread of life and water of life to be offered to him. Adapa, obeying his father's orders, refused them, but put on the garment which was offered to him, and anointed himself with the oil which they gave him. Thereupon Anu laughed and asked Adapa why he had acted so strangely. When Adapa explained that it was by the advice of his father, Ea, that he had refused what was offered to him, Anu tells him that by his act he has deprived himself of the gift of immortality. The end of the tablet is broken, but it seems that Anu sent Adapa back to earth with certain privileges and disabilities. Eridu was to be freed from feudal obligations, and special dignity was conferred upon its priesthood; but misfortune and disease were to be the lot of mankind, allayed, however, by the ministrations of Ninkarrak, the goddess of healing.

There are various points of interest in this remarkable myth. As frequently in these myths, the loss of immortality is ascribed to the jealousy of one or other of the gods, and the belief is expressed that the gods have reserved immortality for themselves. We also see from this myth that the disappearance of Tammuz is a recurrent element in Semitic mythology. It may be possible to see in the garment which is provided for the hero by the gods a link with the feature in the Hebrew story of the Fall in which Yahweh provides Adam and Eve with garments of skin. There is also the aetiological element explaining the origin of the special exemption from feudal dues enjoyed by the ancient priesthood of Eridu.

The Myth of Etana and the Eagle

Many of the Mesopotamian cylinder seals represent scenes which seem to be concerned with incidents in the myths. Several of them have been thought to represent the exploits of Gilgamesh, but very few of them can be identified with any certainty. There is a special interest. in the fact that the myth of Etana can be identified with certainty as depicted on an early seal. [18] In the early Sumerian king-lists the first dynasty after the Flood is the legendary dynasty of Kish, and the thirteenth king of Kish is listed as Etana the shepherd, who ascended to heaven. The seal represents a figure rising from the ground on the back of an eagle, while sheep graze, and two dogs gaze up at the ascending figure.

The motive of several of the myths already dealt with recurs in a different form in the myth of Etana, in this instance connected with birth instead of death. In the course of transmission the myth has become interwoven with a folk-story of the eagle and the serpent. The myth opens with a description of the state of mankind after the Flood, without the guidance and shepherding of a king. The insignia of kinship, the sceptre, crown, tiara, and shepherd's crook are laid up before Anu in heaven. Then the great Anunnaki, the deciders of destiny, decide that kingship shall be sent down from heaven. It is apparently to be inferred that Etana is the appointed king. But in order to secure the permanence of the kingship an heir was necessary, and Etana has no son. We are shown Etana daily offering sacrifices to Shamash and beseeching the god to grant him an heir. He cries to Shamash, 'O Lord, may it issue from thy mouth, grant me the plant of birth, show me the plant of birth, remove my burden, and produce for me a name: Shamash tells the king to cross the mountain, there he will find a pit and in the pit an eagle imprisoned., He is to free the eagle, and the eagle will guide him to the plant of birth.

Here the myth introduces the folk-story of the eagle and the serpent. According to the story, at the beginning of things the eagle and the serpent had sworn a solemn oath of friendship. The eagle had his nest and his young in the top of a tree, while the serpent and his young lived at its base. They undertook to protect and provide food for each other's young. For a time all went well. But the eagle conceived evil in his heart, and broke his oath; while the serpent was away hunting, the eagle devoured the serpent's young. When the serpent returned and found his home desolate, he appealed to Shamash for vengeance against the oath-breaker. Shamash showed him how to snare the eagle, break his wings, and imprison him in a pit. Here the eagle lay, miserably crying in vain to Shamash for help. Here, directed by Shamash, Etana enters, and delivers the eagle, who, in gratitude for his help, promises to carry him up to the throne of Ishtar from whom he may obtain the plant of birth. This is the point of the story depicted by the cylinder seal. The myth vividly describes the stages of the ascent, as the landscape diminishes and disappears. In the middle of the description of the descent the tablet breaks off; but as the king-list gives the name of Etana's son and successor, the myth presumably had a fortunate ending.

It may be remarked that the folk-tale of the eagle and the serpent contains one of the oldest elements of that type of literature. It represents the youngest of the eagle's children as possessing wisdom, and warning his father against the danger of breaking his oath. The myth also suggests an underlying birth ritual, just as traces of funerary rituals appear in the Gilgamesh Epic.

The Myth of Zu

This is another of the few myths which have an identifiable pictorial representation on cylinder seals." The myth also represents another aspect of the theme of life and death which we have already seen so frequently recurring in the Akkadian myths. Zu is shown on the seals as a bird-like figure. Frankfort calls him a bird-man, but he is rather to be regarded as one of the lesser deities, possibly an underworld god, who, like the monstrous offspring of Tiamat, is an enemy of the high gods. His name frequently occurs in ritual texts, and always as in conflict with the great gods. Another theme of this myth, also found in the myth of Etana, is the importance and sacral character of Akkadian kingship.

The myth, in the mutilated form in which we have it, begins with the announcement that Zu has stolen the tablets of destiny which are the insignia of kinship. We have already seen in the Epic of Creation that Marduk wrested from Kingu the tablets of destiny and thereby established his supremacy among the gods. Zu is said to have stolen them from Enlil while he was washing, and to have flown away to his mountain. There is dismay in heaven, and the gods deliberate in council as to who shall be entrusted with the task of vanquishing Zu and recovering the tablets. The whole scene closely resembles the similar scene in the Epic of Creation. Various gods are invoked, but decline the task, and finally it appears that Lugalbanda, the father of Gilgamesh, undertook the mission and slew Zu and regained possession of the tablets. In a hymn of Ashurbanipal we find Marduk named as the god 'who crushed the skull of Zu'.

In one of the texts known as ritual commentaries, a footrace is mentioned as forming part of the ritual of the Babylonian New Year Festival, and the race is explained as signifying the conquest of Zu by Ninurta.

In the ritual of making the sacred lilissu-drum, translated by Thureau-Dangin in his Rituels accadiens, the slaying of a black bull takes place, and before the bull is slain the priest utters a spell into each ear of the bull. In the incantation whispered into the right ear of the bull, the victim is addressed as: 'Great Bull that treads the celestial herbage', while in the other ear he is addressed as 'Spawn of Zu'. Hence it is clear that this curious myth played an important part in the ritual traditions of Babylon.

Before we leave the subject of the Akkadian myths one more short but interesting myth may be added. It may serve as an illustration of the way in which myth material might be taken up and used in apotropaic incantations and exorcisms. The Tammuz myth was widely used in this way, and in the example here given the myth of Creation is used.

The Worm and the Toothache

The Babylonians believed that the various diseases to which the inhabitants of the delta were subject were due to the attacks of evil spirits, or to the malice of wizards or witches. Hence while such remedies as were known were used in the treatment of bodily ailments, the treatment was always accompanied by the recitation of one or more incantations. The colophon at the end of this incantation says that it should be repeated three times over the sufferer after the prescribed treatment has been applied. The translation here given is Speiser's in The Ancient Near Eastern Texts, p 100:

After Anu had created heaven,
Heaven had created the earth,
The earth had created the rivers,
The rivers had created the canals,
The canals had created the marsh,
And the marsh had created the worm,
The worm went weeping before Shamash,
His tears flowing before Ea:
'What will you give me for my food? What wilt thou give me for my sucking?'
'I shall give you the ripe fig,'
And the apricot.'
'Of what use are they to me, the ripe fig And the apricot?
Lift me up and among the teeth And the gums cause me to dwell!
The blood of the tooth will I suck,
And of the gum I will gnaw Its roots!'

Fix the pin and seize its foot.*
'Because you have said this, O worm !
May Ea smite you with the might Of his hand!'

Egyptian Mythology

Chapter 2

While there are certain underlying resemblances between the mythology of Egypt and that of Sumer and Akkad, the differences are more striking and important. There is a superficial resemblance between the physical conditions under which the two civilizations developed their mythology. Both countries lay in river valleys, and the way of life of ...
