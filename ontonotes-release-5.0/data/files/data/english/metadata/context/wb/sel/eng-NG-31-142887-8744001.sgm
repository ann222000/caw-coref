Someone has constantly lambasted God for not doing something about a wide
variety of things while at the same time ignoring any actions taken by the
humans that took them.  But lets look at something else.
Why didn't God allow men to be 'softer' during the time that more and more
women are in the work force?  This would allow males to raise their children
easier, probably.  But that is not the result of this softening is it?  And
the situation has been used to make God look bad again.  The question is how
could he create that.
Did God really create that?  Or is man creating that under the guise of
slowing population growth?  While at the same time keeping some women as
their concubines, the idea being that one male can't have them.
