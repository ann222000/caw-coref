The Quran is the delight of the heart

Allaah, the Exalted, revealed the Quran, to be a beacon of light that
cannot be extinguished. It is a methodology and way of life that is
perfect in all respects. In it is strength that cannot be equaled or
repelled. It is the foundation of Eemaan (Faith) and the spring of
knowledge. Allaah willed that the Quran be what quenches the thirst
for knowledge. It is the delight of the people of wisdom. The Quran is
the greatest cure for all ailments. It is Allaah's Rope that cannot be
severed. It is the Wise Reminder and the truly Straight Path.

In the Quran are the parables of those who were before us, a prophesy
of that which will be after us and a criterion to judge between us. It
is Truth with certainty that was revealed to us. The one who lives
according to its dictations will be rewarded. The one who judges
according to it will be just. The one who calls to it is on the
Straight Path. Allaah raises and lowers people's status based on their
adherence to it. The Quran, on the Day of Judgment, will intercede on
behalf of those who recited it.

Prophet Muhammad  said: &quot;The one who reads a single letter from the
Book of Allaah will be rewarded with one good deed. (Know that) A good
deed is multiplied ten times over. I do not say Alif Laam Meem is one
letter. Verily, Alif is one letter, Laam is one letter, Meem is one
letter.&quot; [At-Tirmithi]

The Book of Allaah to mankind's guidance is like the soul in relation
to the body. Therefore, he who abandons its recitation and does not
act in accordance to its laws is in a state of spiritual death. Allaah
Almighty Says (what means): &quot;And is one who was dead and We gave him
life and made for him light by which to walk among the people like one
who is in darkness, never to emerge there from?&quot; [Quran 6:122]

A person without Quran is like a person without water, air and
medicine. Allaah, the Most Exalted, Says (what means): &quot;And We send
down of the Quran, that which is healing and mercy for the believers,
but it does not increase the wrongdoers except in loss.&quot; [Quran 17:82]

The Quran is a healing for the body and the soul. Whenever life
becomes hard and complicated, the Light of the Quran will always
brighten the way. It will be a source of solace and tranquility. It
will be a defender to you when you are powerless and in need. When the
Muslim recites the Quran, he will feel matchless tranquility in his
heart and being. This causes him only to fear Allaah alone.

Allaah Almighty Says (what means): &quot;Those to whom people [i.e.
hypocrites] said, 'Indeed, the people have gathered against you, so
fear them.' But it [merely] increased them in faith, and they said,
'Sufficient for us is Allaah, and [He is] the best Disposer of
affairs.' So they returned with favor from Allaah and bounty, no harm
having touched them. And they pursued the pleasure of Allaah, and
Allaah is the Possessor of great bounty. That is only Satan who
frightens [you] of his supporters. So fear them not, but fear Me, if
you are [indeed] believers.&quot; [Quran 3:173-175]

Sadly, many have not taken this Quran into consideration and have
neglected its recitation and implementation. They sought the worldly
life and neglected the Hereafter. Allaah Says (what means): &quot;And if
you obey most of those upon the earth, they will mislead you from the
way of Allaah. They follow not except assumption, and they are not but
falsifying.&quot; [Quran 6:116]

Tragically, there are those who recite the Quran in its entirety and
finish with little more than with what they began with in terms of
contemplation and action. Some are so concerned with how they sound,
they beautify their voice without ever listening to what is being
ordered or prohibited. Truly, there are many reciters of the Quran
that the Quran is free from them and their evil. They recite the Quran
and are oppressive to themselves and others by not following its
orders or forbidding its prohibitions.

Nothing is more valuable to a Muslim in his worldly life and in the
Hereafter than reciting the Quran and reflecting and trying to
comprehend its meaning. In doing so, an individual will become
acquainted with what is good and what is evil. He will see the effects
of disobedience of Allaah and its punishment in the parables of those
who have come before us. An example of such a punishment is the flood
that was sent upon the people of Nooh (Noah)  and others similar to
it. It is a source of inspiration and it strengthens one's belief in
Allaah. For this reason, Allaah Says (what means):  &quot;...And when His
(Allaah's) verses (Quran) are recited to them, it increases them in
faith; and upon their Lord they rely.&quot; [Quran 8:2]

This Book was sent and revealed from above the seven Heavens so that
it could be comprehended and implemented, it is not just to be recited
while the heart is pre-occupied. Allaah Almighty Says (what means):

&quot;This is a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad,
sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam], that they might reflect upon its verses
and that those of understanding would be reminded.&quot; [Quran 38:29]

What has happened to our hearts? Why are our hearts locked out and
unresponsive to the Quran? Why do the words enter from one ear and
exit out the other? Why have our hearts hardened? Let us comprehend
the Quran and implement it in our lives. Let us be from those who
implement the Quran in our days and recite it during our nights.

How many moderate Muslims gave money to victims of Islamic terrorism?
Exactly the same number of moderate Nazis gave money to victims of
Holocaust. When American Muslim named Kamal Nawash tried to organize
anti-terrorism rally in Washington, DC., Islamic organizations
condemned the rally. About 50 people showed up, mostly Jews and
Christians. Arabic proverb says &quot;first comes Saturday, then Sunday.&quot;
It means that Arabs are going to exterminate Jews before they
exterminate Christians. It also means that Israel is the first line of
defense against Islam. Our media, our politicians, and our
universities are terrorized by Muslim immigrants and corrupted by
Saudi petrodollars. The terrorists have not corrupted Islam, Islam has
corrupted them. Islam is Arabic imperialism disguised as a religion.
It must be eradicated to prevent another world war.

The most famous recent convert from Islam to Christianity is Dr.
Muhammed Rahoumy. He was the Dean of Al Azhar Islamic University in
Egypt - the oldest and most prestigious Islamic school of theology in
the world. Rahoumy (now Samuel Paul) left Islam in 2000, and now lives
in the USA.

THE ORIGIN OF ISLAM (sources: http://www.historyofjihad.org/
http://www.islam-watch.org/AnwarSheikh/JihadandCivilization1.htm
http://www.islam-watch.org/Others/Allah-and-Eurabia.htm with minor
edits)

The birthplace of Islam, Arabia was afflicted with a harsh environment
unsuitable for agriculture. Bedouins inhabited this harsh environment.
They were wandering in search of pastures and supplemented their
meager livelihood with brigandage, which meant raiding other tribes
and commercial caravans. Though it was sheer looting, it assured them
solace, security and survival, and, therefore, it was not looked down
upon as sinful but a source of power, pleasure and prestige. This
institution of brigandage known as ghazwa (razzia) had existed long
before the advent of prophet Muhammad, the greatest Arab national
hero. The Umayyad poet al-Qutami has alluded to this custom in his two
verses: &quot;Our business is to make raids on the enemy, on our neighbor
and on our own brother, in case we find none to raid but a brother.&quot;
Brigandage was a compulsive trait of the Arab national character and
this is the reason that it was not considered an act of impiety but a
mark of honor and manliness.

The chief deity of pre-Islamic Mecca was the moon-god called Hubal or
al-ilah (god), which was shortened to Allah in pre-Islamic times.
Mohammed dropped the name Hubal but retained the generic Allah. Pre-
Islamic Arabs worshipped the moon-god by bowing in prayer toward Mecca
several times a day. They also made pilgrimages to Mecca, walked
around the Kaaba seven times and threw stones at the devil. And they
fasted for one month, which began with the appearance of the crescent
moon and ended when the crescent moon reappeared. These same rites
form the core of Islam today: Muslims bow in prayer toward Mecca, make
pilgrimages to Mecca, walk around the Kaaba seven times, and they
still throw stones at the devil. They also observe the fast of
Ramadan, which begins and ends with the crescent moon.

The word Islam is not derived from the word &quot;Salam&quot; which means peace,
but from the word &quot;al-silm&quot; which means submission or surrender. The
Kaaba is actually a meteorite which fascinated the ancient tribal
Arabs who were awe-struck by its flaming rush from the skies before it
landed in Mecca.

Mohammed (yimach shmo ve-zichro - may his name and memory be
obliterated) was a murderer, a pedophile and a scoundrel of the worst
kind. Epileptic fits created hallucinations that a god was talking to
him. His first converts were his wife Khadija, his slave Zaid, and
hardened criminals who wanted to loot a harried and defeated enemy.
Having lost his father, the posthumous orphan Mohammed wanted to
perpetuate his father's memory. His father's name Abdallah was derived
from Abd-Allah which translates as &quot;Slave of Allah.&quot; This is the
reason why Mohammed chose Allah among the many pre-Islamic Arab
deities to be the only deity to be worshipped by the Muslims.

After normal marriage with Khadija, he started his spree of marriages
with his marriage of Aisha who was the daughter of his follower Abu
Bakr. Aisha was just seven years old when Mohammed married her and she
was only nine years old when he consumed this marriage! This is the
inspiration for the Arabs of today to pick up child brides.

Realizing the significance of brigandage, Mohammed converted this
institution into a religious doctrine called jihad i.e., the holy War
against the infidels. At his core, Mohammed was nothing more than a
power grabber, who slyly used religion to promote himself. And the
people of Mecca as well as those of Medina saw through that. Some
inhabitants of Medina supported him because he advocated war against
their competitors: the Jews and the Quraish tribe of Mecca. Mohammed
drilled into his followers the fantasy that if they died in a jihad,
they would reach heaven (Jann'at) where they would be served by 72
virgins (Houris) and by pearly eyed boys for the perverts among his
followers.

Two communities lived in Medina (Yathrib): the pagan, polytheistic
Arabs and the Jews. They were often on the warpath. The Arabs were
more numerous, but the Jews by virtue of being traders were more
prosperous and better organized, they also had built fortresses within
and around Medina to defend themselves during their internecine fights
with the pre-Islamic Arab tribes around Yathrib (Medina). The Jews
were usually victorious in the battles against the Arabs. The Arabs of
Medina decided to outwit the Jews by becoming Mohammed's followers and
seek his help in defeating the Jews. This is why the Arabs of Medina
(Yathrib) welcomed Mohammed, in whom they saw an opportunity to break
the trade monopoly of the Jews and also to defeat their other rivals,
the Meccans.

Islam was conceived as a political ploy of Arabs living in Medina
against Jews and Mecca, and it was marketed by Mohammed to his first
converts in Medina as a political alliance rather than as a lofty
religion. Mohammed organized them to take his first revenge on the
Meccans, and he started regularly raiding the caravans of the Meccans
that passed by Medina. He organized 64 such raids from 622 to 630, of
which he personally led 27 raids. These raids were called Ghazawats or
Razzias. The Meccans finally got fed up with Mohammed's antics and
attacked him in Medina. This led to the first major battle in
Mohammed's life - the battle of Badr. The Meccan army was led by Abu
Jahal. In this battle, he realized that the far stronger Meccan army
could only be defeated by guile. He ordered all the water springs
outside Medina to be sanded-up, so that the attacking Meccans would be
without any water. This was a legitimate tactic in war, but a true
messenger of god would not destroy water supply of his own clan. The
Meccans decided to outwit Mohammed and attack Medina during a
cloudburst, to obviate the need for water. But the heavily armored
Meccan army got trapped in the slushy sands outside Medina and they
were in disarray with camels falling over each other in total
disorder. They were defeated by the infantry charges of the Mohammed
's rag-tag, but highly motivated gang.

Many of Mohammed's followers pretended to leave Islam before they
settled in Mecca, thus becoming the fifth column during the eventual
invasion of Mecca that took place in 8 A.H. (630 C.E.). The Hudna
(temporary peace treaty) with the Meccans demonstrates the evil genius
of Mohammed. This evil genius is shared by all Muslims who trick non-
Muslims in day-to-day life in a practice popularly known among the
Muslims as Taquiyya (also spelt as Taqiyya or Taqiya) which means
deception. Pervez Musharraf (the President of Pakistan) referred to
the Hudna when he announced after 9/11 that he was making a pact with
America to fight the Taliban.

With every Muslim military victory, there was not just a change of
ruler, but a wholesale slaughter of those who refused to convert or
pay Jaziya. There was also a total destruction of the pre-Islamic
culture, its educational institutions, libraries, etc.

One of the cardinal principles of Islam is that when a Muslim commits
heinous deeds in order to bring victory to Muslims waging a Jihad
against the Non-Muslims (Kafirs), Islamic law forgives those deeds.
Mohammed preached contempt for all the non-Muslims and told his
gangsters that the non-Muslims were living in ignorance (Jahiliyaa)
and that he would lead his followers to enlightenment (Ailm or ilm).
This enlightenment forgave all acts of rape, murder, torture, as long
as they were committed against the non-Muslims (Kafirs).

Muslims respect only strength and cruelty. They treat magnanimity,
charity and noblesse with contempt. The ritual of emulating Mohammed
in everything is called the Sunnat (or Sunnah). Muslim males emulate
him in doing everything he did like drinking camel
