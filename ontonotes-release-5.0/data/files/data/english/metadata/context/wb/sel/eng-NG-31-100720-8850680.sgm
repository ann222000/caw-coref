While studying my Educational Psychology textbook a few weeks ago, I
came upon an interesting note.  Under Object Permanence, it says that
when children understand that something can exist without being seen,
it is a step toward &quot;more advanced thinking&quot; (Slavin, 2006, p. 34).

Considering that so many atheists say they will not believe what they
cannot see, I guess that means they are less advanced thinkers (stuck
in pre-operational thinking).

Kenny, further proof, that you can read, but to grasp the understanding, is
beyond you!!

See when you say, I GUESS. you show us all that you had a preconceived idea,
and use a non related piece to reinforce your idiotic assumption.

Do you ever stop and think, that when you post this kind of drivel, that you
end up looking like a complete idiot??

Smile.

And of course what Piaget studied was NOT the ability
of a child to imagine the existence of something it
had never seen -- it was the child's ability to
persist in imagining something that it HAD BEEN
SHOWN, and which was now obscured.

Piaget was judging the ability to remember balls
which, once seen, were now under blankets.

Piaget was NOT judging the ability to belive
in unicorns, fairies, or any other thing
which had never been seen.

If it were not for the fact that I know Bob and
other hightly intelligent and intellectually
honest, Christians, posts like this one of yours might
convince me that religious believers are
stuck in an early developmental level.

They are logical users of common sense.

Oh and by the way, demonizing atheists in no way makes your god any more
believable.

All you have to do is produce your god, right now,

God was not only shown to Adam and a whole host of Old Testament
figures (and their enemies often), but He walked among us as Christ,
before ascending to where He was before.  In fact, we have written
witness accounts.  Thus, it was shown, and it is not shown now.
Atheists deny what was present to exist because they cannot NOW see

&gt; God was not only shown to Adam and a whole host of Old Testament
&gt; figures (and their enemies often),
">

And Ares, Aphrodite, Poseidon and other gods were not only
seen, but took part in battles at Troy, as recorded in
lengthy detail in the Iliad.

Now that Homer has shown these to you (exactly analogous
to Piaget showing an infant a ball, if I follow your
reasoning), how can you remain a stubborn atheist
as regards Zeus?

And Krishna, of course, um...&quot;revealed&quot; himself, so to speak,
to many a gopti, as we read in the Bhagavata Purana.  Krishna
has thus been shown -- and more -- to humans, just like
the ball now beneath the blanket.  Can you no longer
remember Krishna, just because you cannot see him at
this moment?

&gt; but He walked among us as Christ,
&gt; before ascending to where He was before.

And both God the Father and God the Son walked among us, in
the form of Haile Selassie I, according to the insights
of Rasta.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In fact, we have written witness accounts.
">

And we have much more recent accounts, many written as well,
of the miracle in which the Bab, the founding figure of Baha'i,
was hung by ropes from a wall and fired upon by a squad
of 750 rifles -- and when the smoke cleared, the Bab
was found back in his prison cell, finishing an interrupted
conversation with a follower.

Is this sufficient to &quot;show&quot; you the truth of Baha'i?
Or will you remain &quot;less developed&quot;, to use your phrase?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thus, it was shown, and it is not shown now.

And similarly for the examples I have given you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Atheists deny what was present to exist because they cannot NOW see
&gt; it...thus, Piaget says they are less developed thinkers.
">

In spite of my primitive level of development, I have no trouble
distinguishing between the immediacy of a ball shown to a baby and
the somewhat more tenuous nature of 2000 year old stories.

But I do admit that I find myself able to draw sweeping metaphysical
conclusions from the results of a very specific and
limited (and somewhat controversial, actually) experiment
in developmental psychology.

Piaget doesn't say anything of the sort. What a strange extrapolation. Do
you not understand the difference between a child's cognitive development,
and an adult's reading and evaluation of written texts?

&gt; They are logical users of common sense.

Your statements about God being shown to Adam, etc., depends on a
literal intepretation of the Bible. You are, of course, entitled to
that belief, but please be honest that it is one of your assumptions.
In other words, you are saying, &quot;IF we accept a literal reading of the
Bible, then theists are more rational than atheists.&quot;

Well, duh. No one would disagree with that statement. It doesn't
require Piaget to back it up.

Piaget's concept of Object Permanence describes that point in
psychological development where an individual (usually a young child,
although some developmentally disadvantaged adults can't quite manage
it), HAVING SEEN A PHYSICAL OBJECT, continues to believe the object
exists whne it has been hidden. This is ALL Object Permanence refers
to.

It does not refer to believing that an object exists because it has
been described to you, or because you've read about it, or because you
have imagined or dreamed it. Those are other psychological phenomena.
Object Permanence requires that you, yourself, see the object first.

So believing in God because you've read in the Bible that God appeared
to Adam, or because someone told you that Jesus, who appeared to his
disciples, was God, has nothing to do with Object Permanence. I'm not
saying (right here) that it's valid or invalid. Just that it has
nothing to do with Object Permanence.

The fact that atheists do not believe in God does not mean they are
incapable of Object Permanence. If they saw God, and believed he
existed, and then God walked behind a curtain, and they then believed
that God had ceased to exist (because they couldn't see him anymore),
then that would display a lack of Object Permanence. But since that is
not an accurate description of atheists and their experience, it is
fallacious to say that Piaget's theory of Object Permanence shows that
atheists are less psychologically developed thatn theists.

You say you are studying Educational Psychology. If you are studying
it as part of an actual course, you may wish to ask your teacher or
professor about your undersanding of Piaget's theory of Object
Permanence. He or she might be able to clear up your misconceptions.

By the way, I was talking to an atheist at his home the other day,
then I went home. Later he called me to ask me a question. Although he
could no longer see me, he CONTINUED to believe that I existed
(otherwise he wouldn't have made the call). Like most atheists of my
acquaintance, he had mastered Object Permanence many years before.

Most theists of my acquaintance can do the same, but I've seen no
evidence that they are BETTER at it.

Excuse me, are you claiming that I'm an atheist?

In any case, I was extremely careful in my post to NOT say that direct
observation was the only valid means for coming to a belief. I merely
said that direct observation was necessary for Piaget's Object
Permanence theory, and therefore your claim that Paiget's OP theory
shows that atheists are less psychologically developed than theists is
false.

I didn't even state that atheists are NOT less psychologically
developed than theists. (Nor did I state the opposite. I didn't
comment on that question.) Just that using Paiget's theory does not
demonstrate that.

I feel sure that if you went back and read my post more carefully, you
will discover that (a) I'm telling the truth about what I said, and
therefore (b) your follow-up does not actually respond to anything I
said in my post.

You may be right about God and theists and atheists. Or you may not
be. But your use of Paiget's theory to back up your claims is not
valid; it's based on a misunderstanding of OP.

On a similar topic, I'm curious: the Virgin Mary appears to about
half a dozen people a week, on the average, according to the
director of the Marian Library at the University of Dayton.
Do you doubt the word of these eyewitnesses, hundreds
of them a year?

I understand perfectly well that when it is convenient to do so, religionists use passages from their historical religious
tomes to perpetrate their beliefs and when those old books do not help at all they chose to ignore or totally avoid them and
start using clichŽs like:

'a ball in front'

There's nothing odd in my understanding of religions and their followers who fail each time when they are asked to prove their
gods exist.

100%.  There are even more sightings of 'vehicles from outer space' and a gaggle of 'houses with ghosts in them' followed by
'Crop Carvings in a new field of corn' [all the work of man not visitors from another world]

All the work of crackpots.

A couple of years ago in The Philippines a marble statue of The Virgin Mary had moisture close to where her eyes were.  'She is
crying' was the message that went out, and they flocked there in thousands only to find the tears dried up when the temperature
changed and the humidity dropped.

Strange how a god that is supposed to have created the entire universe needs to be propped up by such silly notions.  What does
this tell a normally intelligent superstition free individual?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuck in an early developmental level.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --cary

&gt; &gt; &gt; God was not only shown to Adam and a whole host of Old Testament
&gt; &gt; &gt; figures (and their enemies often), but He walked among us as Christ,
&gt; &gt; &gt; before ascending to where He was before.  In fact, we have written
&gt; &gt; &gt; witness accounts.  Thus, it was shown, and it is not shown now.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Atheists deny what was present to exist because they cannot NOW see
&gt; &gt; &gt; it...thus, Piaget says they are less developed thinkers.

&gt; &gt; Your statements about God being shown to Adam, etc., depends on a
&gt; &gt; literal intepretation of the Bible. You are, of course, entitled to
&gt; &gt; that belief, but please be honest that it is one of your assumptions.
&gt; &gt; In other words, you are saying, &quot;IF we accept a literal reading of the
&gt; &gt; Bible, then theists are more rational than atheists.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Well, duh. No one would disagree with that statement. It doesn't
&gt; &gt; require Piaget to back it up.

&gt; &gt; Piaget's concept of Object Permanence describes that point in
&gt; &gt; psychological development where an individual (usually a young child,
&gt; &gt; although some developmentally disadvantaged adults can't quite manage
&gt; &gt; it), HAVING SEEN A PHYSICAL OBJECT, continues to believe the object
&gt; &gt; exists whne it has been hidden. This is ALL Object Permanence refers
&gt; &gt; to.

&gt; &gt; It does not refer to believing that an object exists because it has
&gt; &gt; been described to you, or because you've read about it, or because you
&gt; &gt; have imagined or dreamed it. Those are other psychological phenomena.
&gt; &gt; Object Permanence requires that you, yourself, see the object first.

&gt; &gt; So believing in God because you've read in the Bible that God appeared
&gt; &gt; to Adam, or because someone told you that Jesus, who appeared to his
&gt; &gt; disciples, was God, has nothing to do with Object Permanence. I'm not
&gt; &gt; saying (right here) that it's valid or invalid. Just that it has
&gt; &gt; nothing to do with Object Permanence.

&gt; &gt; The fact that atheists do not believe in God does not mean they are
&gt; &gt; incapable of Object Permanence. If they saw God, and believed he
&gt; &gt; existed, and then God walked behind a curtain, and they then believed
&gt; &gt; that God had ceased to exist (because they couldn't see him anymore),
&gt; &gt; then that would display a lack of Object Permanence. But since that is
&gt; &gt; not an accurate description of atheists and their experience, it is
&gt; &gt; fallacious to say that Piaget's theory of Object Permanence shows that
&gt; &gt; atheists are less psychologically developed thatn theists.

&gt; &gt; You say you are studying Educational Psychology. If you are studying
&gt; &gt; it as part of an actual course, you may wish to ask your teacher or
&gt; &gt; professor about your undersanding of Piaget's theory of Object
&gt; &gt; Permanence. He or she might be able to clear up your misconceptions.

&gt; &gt; By the way, I was talking to an atheist at his home the other day,
&gt; &gt; then I went home. Later he called me to ask me a question. Although he
&gt; &gt; could no longer see me, he CONTINUED to believe that I existed
&gt; &gt; (otherwise he wouldn't have made the call). Like most atheists of my
&gt; &gt; acquaintance, he had mastered Object Permanence many years before.

&gt; &gt; Most theists of my acquaintance can do the same, but I've seen no
&gt; &gt; evidence that they are BETTER at it.

&gt; So, have you PERSONALLY observed evolution or conducted research that
&gt; shows there is no God, or do you rely on the words of others?
">

And how, exactly, would you propose Anlatt -- or anyone -- go
about conducting such experiments in a scientifically valid
manner?  Personal experience?  The followers of Voudun
who have been ridden will testify to you of the extreme
personal reality of the loa.  Miracles?  The god-men
of India go about &quot;healing&quot; at a rate that would
put Benny Hinn to shame.  Personal transformation?
How many testimonials would you like from followers
of the Cult Which Must Not be Named?

Oddly enough Ken, at whom I directed that question, seems disinclined to
answer.

I find the prospect fascinating -- since Ken thinks that 2000 year
stories constitute &quot;showing&quot; us God, then do not the nigh-weekly
personal witnesses to the manifestation of Mary even more convincingly
and finally resolve some centuries-old Protestant/Catholic theological
disputes?

Perhaps he will answer this time...
