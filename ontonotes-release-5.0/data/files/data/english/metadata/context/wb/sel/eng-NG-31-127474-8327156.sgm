give us their accounts on why Christianity has been so important to
them.   If God were truly in you, one would think it would
show( without doubt) God's presence outside of you.  Why don't we
Atheist see it.  Have you been lying to yourselves and us?  Have you
been lying to your children?   If God were such a wonderfully powerful
being who gave his powers to selected people, wouldn't those people be
so alluring to the rest of us that we'd want to know more about God.
There are Rock Stars whom I was more attracted to( what they said and
did), rather than any Christian.   I'll take Bob Dillan over Jim and
Tammy Faye Bakker.   I'll take John Lennon's words  over  Pat
Robertson's any day of the week.   I'd rather listen to a U2 song than
the sermon of any televangelist.
Dillan, Bono, and Lennon have all attracted enormous audiences with
their music and lyrical eloquence.  Why don't the Christians, who
supposedly have been touched by God, attract our attention in the same
way.   All Dillan, Bono, and Lennon had were guitars and voice.
Christians however, have the blessings of God with them.   Yet they do
absolutely nothing for me.  Where is God's power in all this????
Shouldn't God be a more powerful instrument than a guitar?  Have you
Christians become so selfish as to not want to share with us that
which was so freely given to you?   No, I think not.  You are all a
bunch of liars!!   You do not possess what you claim to.   If you did
your persona would be impossible to avoid.   It seems every Christian
I meet turns me off in less than 5 minutes with their talk of God.
They are dull, boring people, who are in NO WAY inspired by any ALL
KNOWING, ALL POWERFUL, entity.

You request, is sent out to the universe, with the passion you have
displayed, your answer is YES. Yes, with in you has witness, what is
not real, Only God's Love is real. This disconnect you see. disagrees
with the part of you, that is connected to all that is. God is within
each and everyone of us, His Love depends on NOTHING, so it's
unconditional. Yet the world has put nothing but conditions on Gods
Love. The world has clouded the word LOVE, to make it fit, yet Jesus
gave us the word PEACE, it can still resonant with the soul. You see,
you feel, you KNOW, this Peace, its a remembering, becoming a member,
once again. We came from it, and we'll return, period.... We have
NEVER been separated, the world of ego, knows nothing but separation,
don't be its servant, your mind and spirit is here for your use, not
the other way. God comes THROUGH us, not to us. This Holy Spirit is
there waiting, for an open mind and heart, to become an realized Soul.
Be what it is you seek, In Being you give, in giving you recieve. So
be the answer you seek. Be Peace, and it will surround you.....

In your opinion. I think faith will literally destroy our species if
we let it. When you believe in something without a reason, ALL things
that are said without a reason that have religion backing them up are
equally allowed, including people that blow themselves up for 14
virgins in heaven. The only difference is in the nature of the
unfounded assertion, but they're still unfounded assertions. In any
case, do you think it's a good thing that George Bush thinks God wants
him to destroy Iraq? Do you think it's a good thing that most
Christians are nonplussed at the prospect of our world coming to an
end, and in most cases actually welcome it? Do you think it's good
that people deny education and focus on whatever fictitious myth suits
their fancy better?

While I agree with the sentiment of the post, I've got to point out
something about Bob Dylan.

from allmusic.com:
&quot;At the conclusion of the tour in late 1978, Dylan announced that he
was a born-again Christian, and he launched a series of Christian
albums that following summer with Slow Train Coming. Though the
reviews were mixed, the album was a success, peaking at number three
and going platinum. His supporting tour for Slow Train Coming featured
only his new religious material, much to the bafflement of his long-
term fans. Two other religious albums - Saved (1980) and Shot of Love
(1981) - followed, both to poor reviews. In 1982, Dylan traveled to
Israel, sparking rumors that his conversion to Christianity was short-
lived. He returned to secular recording with 1983's Infidels, which
was greeted with favorable reviews.&quot;

Rumor has it that Dylan has abandoned religion, and if not it at least
seems as if he has turned it into something private that he no longer
feels any reason to discuss in public. In any case, his &quot;religious
phase&quot; is basically described by any rock historian as the absolute
low point of his career and most of his fans either don't know about
it or don't want to talk about it.

He was Saved...

I was blinded by the devil,
Born already ruined,
Stone-cold dead
As I stepped out of the womb.
By His grace I have been touched,
By His word I have been healed,
By His hand I've been delivered,
By His spirit I've been sealed.

I've been saved
By the blood of the lamb,
Saved
By the blood of the lamb,
Saved,
Saved,
And I'm so glad.
Yes, I'm so glad,
I'm so glad,
So glad,
I want to thank You, Lord,
I just want to thank You, Lord,
Thank You, Lord.

By His truth I can be upright,
By His strength I do endure,
By His power I've been lifted,
In His love I am secure.
He bought me with a price,
Freed me from the pit,
Full of emptiness and wrath
And the fire that burns in it.

I've been saved
By the blood of the lamb,
Saved
By the blood of the lamb,
Saved,
Saved,
And I'm so glad.
Yes, I'm so glad,
I'm so glad,
So glad,
I want to thank You, Lord,
I just want to thank You, Lord,
Thank You, Lord.

Nobody to rescue me,
Nobody would dare,
I was going down for the last time,
But by His mercy I've been spared.
Not by works,
But by faith in Him who called,
For so long I've been hindered,
For so long I've been stalled.

I've been saved
By the blood of the lamb,
Saved
By the blood of the lamb,
Saved,
Saved,
And I'm so glad.
Yes, I'm so glad, I'm so glad,
So glad, I want to thank You, Lord,
I just want to thank You, Lord,
Thank You, Lord.

Norman Mailer speculated that if William S. Burroughs had never become
addicted to heroin, he would probably no doubt be considered the
greatest writer of the twentieth century. As such, we can only
speculate about what Dylan would have accomplished if he never found
God.

Here is one from John Lennon.  Much more intense than Dylan.  Anyone
can write about the lord and Satan, but how many people have the balls
to write that which is unpopular.  I won't have all the words
correct.  This is off the top of my head.

&quot; God is a concept by which we measure our pain.  I'll say it again:
God is a concept by which we measure our pain.&quot;

I don't believe in Gita
I don't believe in yoga
I don't believe in Mantra
I don't believe in Buddha
I don't believe in Elvis
I don't believe in Jesus
I don't believe in Magic
I don't believe in Tarot
I don't believe in Kennedy
I don't believe in Zimmerman
I don't believe in Beatles

I just believe in me.  Yoko and me, and that's reality.
The dream is over, what can I say?
The dream is over yesterday.

I was the dream weaver, but now he's gone
I was the Walrus, but now I'm John
The dream is over.

Wow!  If this song didn't reek of emotion and guts nothing does.
It's songs like this that are my God (figuratively speaking).

&gt; &gt; While I agree with the sentiment of the post, I've got to point out
&gt; &gt; something about Bob Dylan.

&gt; &gt; from allmusic.com:
&gt; &gt; &quot;At the conclusion of the tour in late 1978, Dylan announced that he
&gt; &gt; was a born-again Christian, and he launched a series of Christian
&gt; &gt; albums that following summer with Slow Train Coming. Though the
&gt; &gt; reviews were mixed, the album was a success, peaking at number three
&gt; &gt; and going platinum. His supporting tour for Slow Train Coming featured
&gt; &gt; only his new religious material, much to the bafflement of his long-
&gt; &gt; term fans. Two other religious albums - Saved (1980) and Shot of Love
&gt; &gt; (1981) - followed, both to poor reviews. In 1982, Dylan traveled to
&gt; &gt; Israel, sparking rumors that his conversion to Christianity was short-
&gt; &gt; lived. He returned to secular recording with 1983's Infidels, which
&gt; &gt; was greeted with favorable reviews.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Rumor has it that Dylan has abandoned religion, and if not it at least
&gt; &gt; seems as if he has turned it into something private that he no longer
&gt; &gt; feels any reason to discuss in public. In any case, his &quot;religious
&gt; &gt; phase&quot; is basically described by any rock historian as the absolute
&gt; &gt; low point of his career and most of his fans either don't know about
&gt; &gt; it or don't want to talk about it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; being who gave his powers to selected people, wouldn't those people be
&gt; &gt; &gt; so alluring to the rest of us that we'd want to know more about God.
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are Rock Stars whom I was more attracted to( what they said and
&gt; &gt; &gt; did), rather than any Christian.   I'll take Bob Dillan over Jim and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tammy Faye Bakker.   I'll take John Lennon's words  over  Pat
&gt; &gt; &gt; Robertson's any day of the week.   I'd rather listen to a U2 song than
&gt; &gt; &gt; the sermon of any televangelist.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Dillan, Bono, and Lennon have all attracted enormous audiences with
&gt; &gt; &gt; their music and lyrical eloquence.  Why don't the Christians, who
&gt; &gt; &gt; supposedly have been touched by God, attract our attention in the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; way.   All Dillan, Bono, and Lennon had were guitars and voice.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Christians however, have the blessings of God with them.   Yet they do
&gt; &gt; &gt; absolutely nothing for me.  Where is God's power in all this????
&gt; &gt; &gt; Shouldn't God be a more powerful instrument than a guitar?  Have you
&gt; &gt; &gt; Christians become so selfish as to not want to share with us that
&gt; &gt; &gt; which was so freely given to you?   No, I think not.  You are all a
&gt; &gt; &gt; bunch of liars!!   You do not possess what you claim to.   If you did
&gt; &gt; &gt; your persona would be impossible to avoid.   It seems every Christian
&gt; &gt; &gt; I meet turns me off in less than 5 minutes with their talk of God.

&gt; &gt; He was Saved...

&gt; &gt; I was blinded by the devil,
&gt; &gt; Born already ruined,
&gt; &gt; Stone-cold dead
&gt; &gt; As I stepped out of the womb.
&gt; &gt; By His grace I have been touched,
&gt; &gt; By His word I have been healed,
&gt; &gt; By His hand I've been delivered,
&gt; &gt; By His spirit I've been sealed.

&gt; &gt; By His truth I can be upright,
&gt; &gt; By His strength I do endure,
&gt; &gt; By His power I've been lifted,
&gt; &gt; In His love I am secure.
&gt; &gt; He bought me with a price,
&gt; &gt; Freed me from the pit,
&gt; &gt; Full of emptiness and wrath
&gt; &gt; And the fire that burns in it.

Religion ( an d conflicts in the name of religion )has been around for
5000 years - mankind did fine ( no threat of anhiliation ) till the
beginning of this century. What is new is a breed of immoral people
without respect for God or man . How else can you justify harvesting
stem cells from embryos , abortion, genetic manipulation of humans
etc.

Your right Craig.   It's just that John wrote so many songs that
opened my mind I didn't know where to begin.

Like:  Just Give Me Some Truth
Mind Games
Sexy Sady
Love
Working Class Hero        Just to name a few.   Capitalism
and Corporate interest have destroyed art.   Just as the thought of
God has stolen away the commonsensical mind.

&gt; &gt;   Wow!  If this song didn't reek of emotion and guts nothing does.
&gt; &gt; It's songs like this that are my God (figuratively speaking).

&gt; Good but I prefer &quot;Imagine&quot;. That song never fails to send chills up

&gt; &gt; &gt; He was Saved...

&gt; &gt; &gt; I was blinded by the devil,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Born already ruined,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Stone-cold dead
&gt; &gt; &gt; As I stepped out of the womb.
&gt; &gt; &gt; By His grace I have been touched,
&gt; &gt; &gt; By His word I have been healed,
&gt; &gt; &gt; By His hand I've been delivered,
&gt; &gt; &gt; By His spirit I've been sealed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've been saved
&gt; &gt; &gt; By the blood of the lamb,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Saved
&gt; &gt; &gt; By the blood of the lamb,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Saved,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Saved,
&gt; &gt; &gt; And I'm so glad.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I'm so glad,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm so glad,
&gt; &gt; &gt; So glad,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to thank You, Lord,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I just want to thank You, Lord,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank You, Lord.

&gt; &gt; &gt; By His truth I can be upright,
&gt; &gt; &gt; By His strength I do endure,
&gt; &gt; &gt; By His power I've been lifted,
&gt; &gt; &gt; In His love I am secure.
&gt; &gt; &gt; He bought me with a price,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Freed me from the pit,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Full of emptiness and wrath
&gt; &gt; &gt; And the fire that burns in it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've been saved
&gt; &gt; &gt; By the blood of the lamb,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Saved
&gt; &gt; &gt; By the blood of the lamb,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Saved,

&gt; &gt; &gt; I just want to thank You, Lord,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank You, Lord.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody to rescue me,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody would dare,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was going down for the last time,
&gt; &gt; &gt; But by His mercy I've been spared.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not by works,
&gt; &gt; &gt; But by faith in Him who called,
&gt; &gt; &gt; For so long I've been hindered,
&gt; &gt; &gt; For so long I've been stalled.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've been saved
&gt; &gt; &gt; By the blood of the lamb,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Saved
&gt; &gt; &gt; By the blood of the lamb,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Saved,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Saved,
&gt; &gt; &gt; And I'm so glad.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I'm so glad, I'm so glad,
&gt; &gt; &gt; So glad, I want to thank You, Lord,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;At the conclusion of the tour in late 1978, Dylan announced that he

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; albums that following summer with Slow Train Coming. Though the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reviews were mixed, the album was a success, peaking at number three

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only his new religious material, much to the bafflement of his long-

Good, I'm glad, but that wasn't the point. The point was that there is
a man in charge of this country that thinks that God tells him to go
to war and kill people, and 51% of the population believed him at one
point. How do we distinguish between what God tells one person to do
and another? There is no way. There is no difference between Bush

Very ironic that you should say this. In fact, this could not be

that do their immoral acts in the name of faith. George Bush is a
terrorist. So is Osama bin Laden. Both of them think God wants the
other one dead. So you're going to tell me one is right and the other
is wrong, because you're a Christian and probably agree with George W.
Terrorist. So that makes you no better than a terrorist yourself.

human. It isn't. It could BECOME a human. It could also become a
liver. Or a kidney. Or a heart. Or a skin cell. Or a hair. Or a
fingernail. Or nothing at all.

In any case, I find the objections to this strategy laughable, because
the cells in question are leftover from in vitro fertilization clinics
and will be discarded in any case. But you don't bitch about that, do
you?

To save lives, along with other reasons. As far as I'm concerned,
making abortion illegal does nothing to stop abortions (and statistics
across the world confirm this). Better to make it safe, legal, and as
rare as is humanly possible. Otherwise, you're not stopping the
problem. You're just assuaging your guilt about it, which is stupid.

This hasn't happened yet, but it will probably happen in the future,
and people are doing it because they want to save lives too.

&gt; &gt; &gt; from allmusic.com:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;At the conclusion of the tour in late 1978, Dylan announced that he
&gt; &gt; &gt; was a born-again Christian, and he launched a series of Christian
&gt; &gt; &gt; albums that following summer with Slow Train Coming. Though the
&gt; &gt; &gt; reviews were mixed, the album was a success, peaking at number three
&gt; &gt; &gt; and going platinum. His supporting tour for Slow Train Coming featured

&gt; &gt; &gt; term fans. Two other religious albums - Saved (1980) and Shot of Love
&gt; &gt; &gt; (1981) - followed, both to poor reviews. In 1982, Dylan traveled to
&gt; &gt; &gt; Israel, sparking rumors that his conversion to Christianity was short-
&gt; &gt; &gt; lived. He returned to secular recording with 1983's Infidels, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; was greeted with favorable reviews.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Rumor has it that Dylan has abandoned religion, and if not it at least
&gt; &gt; &gt; seems as if he has turned it into something private that he no longer
&gt; &gt; &gt; feels any reason to discuss in public. In any case, his &quot;religious

I think the general difference between drug addiction and religion is
that with drug addiction you hurt yourself more than anyone else,
whereas with religion it might help you but it hurts the whole world.
Theism is just a more selfish version of drug addiction.

&gt; &gt; &gt; mankind did fine ( no threat of anhiliation ) till the

&gt; &gt; I guess the near-total state of war that, for instance, Western Europe
&gt; &gt; was in from about 400-1700 AD has escaped your attention.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  What is new is a breed of immoral people
&gt; &gt; &gt; without respect for God or man .

&gt; &gt; Very ironic that you should say this. In fact, this could not be
&gt; &gt; further from the truth. The people that are the MOST immoral are those
&gt; &gt; that do their immoral acts in the name of faith. George Bush is a
&gt; &gt; terrorist. So is Osama bin Laden. Both of them think God wants the
&gt; &gt; other one dead. So you're going to tell me one is right and the other
&gt; &gt; is wrong, because you're a Christian and probably agree with George W.
&gt; &gt; Terrorist. So that makes you no better than a terrorist yourself.
&gt; &gt; Denying this is hypocrisy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; How else can you justify harvesting
&gt; &gt; &gt; stem cells from embryos ,

&gt; &gt; To save lives. You're assuming that a group of human cells is itself a
&gt; &gt; human. It isn't. It could BECOME a human. It could also become a
&gt; &gt; liver. Or a kidney. Or a heart. Or a skin cell. Or a hair. Or a
&gt; &gt; fingernail. Or nothing at all.

&gt; &gt; In any case, I find the objections to this strategy laughable, because
&gt; &gt; the cells in question are leftover from in vitro fertilization clinics
&gt; &gt; and will be discarded in any case. But you don't bitch about that, do
&gt; &gt; you?

&gt; &gt; &gt; abortion,

&gt; &gt; To save lives, along with other reasons. As far as I'm concerned,
&gt; &gt; making abortion illegal does nothing to stop abortions (and statistics
&gt; &gt; across the world confirm this). Better to make it safe, legal, and as
&gt; &gt; rare as is humanly possible. Otherwise, you're not stopping the
&gt; &gt; problem. You're just assuaging your guilt about it, which is stupid.

&gt; &gt; &gt; genetic manipulation of humans
&gt; &gt; &gt; etc.

&gt; &gt; This hasn't happened yet, but it will probably happen in the future,
&gt; &gt; and people are doing it because they want to save lives too.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While I agree with the sentiment of the post, I've got to point out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something about Bob Dylan.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from allmusic.com:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;At the conclusion of the tour in late 1978, Dylan announced that he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a born-again Christian, and he launched a series of Christian
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; albums that following summer with Slow Train Coming. Though the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reviews were mixed, the album was a success, peaking at number three
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and going platinum. His supporting tour for Slow Train Coming featured
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only his new religious material, much to the bafflement of his long-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; term fans. Two other religious albums - Saved (1980) and Shot of Love
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1981) - followed, both to poor reviews. In 1982, Dylan traveled to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Israel, sparking rumors that his conversion to Christianity was short-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived. He returned to secular recording with 1983's Infidels, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was greeted with favorable reviews.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rumor has it that Dylan has abandoned religion, and if not it at least
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems as if he has turned it into something private that he no longer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feels any reason to discuss in public. In any case, his &quot;religious
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phase&quot; is basically described by any rock historian as the absolute
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; low point of his career and most of his fans either don't know about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it or don't want to talk about it.

So anyway, I'm still waiting for some gutless Christians to step to
the plate and tell us why they are NOT showered with God's external
glory.   I see folks who win the lottery more excited, than those who
claim to be touched by God.  Is the lottery more profound and
powerful  than God I wonder?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, we agree that religion was not around since the beginning of our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; species, we had to construct that much later. But I'd include ancestor
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worship which might in fact push this date back a few tens of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thousands of years.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mankind did fine ( no threat of anhiliation ) till the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beginning of this century.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess the near-total state of war that, for instance, Western Europe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was in from about 400-1700 AD has escaped your attention.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  What is new is a breed of immoral people
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without respect for God or man .

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Very ironic that you should say this. In fact, this could not be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; further from the truth. The people that are the MOST immoral are those
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that do their immoral acts in the name of faith. George Bush is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terrorist. So is Osama bin Laden. Both of them think God wants the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other one dead. So you're going to tell me one is right and the other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is wrong, because you're a Christian and probably agree with George W.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Terrorist. So that makes you no better than a terrorist yourself.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Denying this is hypocrisy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How else can you justify harvesting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stem cells from embryos ,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To save lives. You're assuming that a group of human cells is itself a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; human. It isn't. It could BECOME a human. It could also become a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liver. Or a kidney. Or a heart. Or a skin cell. Or a hair. Or a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fingernail. Or nothing at all.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In any case, I find the objections to this strategy laughable, because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cells in question are leftover from in vitro fertilization clinics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and will be discarded in any case. But you don't bitch about that, do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; abortion,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To save lives, along with other reasons. As far as I'm concerned,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; making abortion illegal does nothing to stop abortions (and statistics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; across the world confirm this). Better to make it safe, legal, and as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rare as is humanly possible. Otherwise, you're not stopping the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem. You're just assuaging your guilt about it, which is stupid.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; genetic manipulation of humans
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This hasn't happened yet, but it will probably happen in the future,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and people are doing it because they want to save lives too.

Maybe if George Bush had as much respect for men
as he does for embryos he would not send so many out
to be killed in war. What if its your relative whose parkinsons

George W. Bush is a perfect argument against abortion. He is living
proof that an aborted fetus is liable to become the most hated man in
the world. Bush Sr. should have just pulled out before he pulled out
the coat hanger.

Seriously--arguing against _stem cell research_? Really? There's
nothing to that.

And what's this &quot;genital manipulation by humans&quot; jazz? Masturbation?
What about the genital mutilation encouraged on a massive scope by the
three central monotheisms?

How do you justify putting a blastocyst before the life of a woman, or
an embryo before the life of a sick person? Oh yeah--your religion
tells you so and you turn your brain off. Pfui.

If your god cares so much about a conceptus, can you explain why the
majority of human fertilisations end up in a toilet without any human
intervention? And why no-one was ever told to hold funerals or grieve
for the &quot;late&quot; period (let's face it, most are greeted with outright
euphoria when they arrive:)) when they are often early miscarriage?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While I agree with the sentiment of the post, I've got to point out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something about Bob Dylan.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from allmusic.com:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;At the conclusion of the tour in late 1978, Dylan announced that he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a born-again Christian, and he launched a series of Christian
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; albums that following summer with Slow Train Coming. Though the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reviews were mixed, the album was a success, peaking at number three
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and going platinum. His supporting tour for Slow Train Coming featured
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only his new religious material, much to the bafflement of his long-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; term fans. Two other religious albums - Saved (1980) and Shot of Love
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1981) - followed, both to poor reviews. In 1982, Dylan traveled to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Israel, sparking rumors that his conversion to Christianity was short-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived. He returned to secular recording with 1983's Infidels, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was greeted with favorable reviews.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rumor has it that Dylan has abandoned religion, and if not it at least
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems as if he has turned it into something private that he no longer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feels any reason to discuss in public. In any case, his &quot;religious
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phase&quot; is basically described by any rock historian as the absolute
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; low point of his career and most of his fans either don't know about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it or don't want to talk about it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the sermon of any televangelist.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Dillan, Bono, and Lennon have all attracted enormous audiences with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their music and lyrical eloquence.  Why don't the Christians, who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supposedly have been touched by God, attract our attention in the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way.   All Dillan, Bono, and Lennon had were guitars and voice.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Christians however, have the blessings of God with them.   Yet they do

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shouldn't God be a more powerful instrument than a guitar?  Have you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Christians become so selfish as to not want to share with us that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which was so freely given to you?   No, I think not.  You are all a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bunch of liars!!   You do not possess what you claim to.   If you did
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your persona would be impossible to avoid.   It seems every Christian
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I meet turns me off in less than 5 minutes with their talk of God.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They are dull, boring people, who are in NO WAY inspired by any ALL

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, nada, zero, zilch, kapout faith is actually no good. Not good at

&gt; &gt; &gt; In your opinion. I think faith will literally destroy our species if

&gt; &gt; &gt; that are said without a reason that have religion backing them up are
&gt; &gt; &gt; equally allowed, including people that blow themselves up for 14
&gt; &gt; &gt; virgins in heaven. The only difference is in the nature of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; unfounded assertion, but they're still unfounded assertions. In any

&gt; &gt; &gt; him to destroy Iraq? Do you think it's a good thing that most
&gt; &gt; &gt; Christians are nonplussed at the prospect of our world coming to an
&gt; &gt; &gt; end, and in most cases actually welcome it? Do you think it's good
&gt; &gt; &gt; that people deny education and focus on whatever fictitious myth suits

Perhaps we should have a Millet system where society is divided into
groups with different laws applied to each. No medical care products
developed using embryo stem cells for those who object to harvesting
stem cells from embryos. IVF facilities required to dispose of
objectors' surplus embryos by forcing other objectors to volunteer
their wombs. Sorry; they may not complain if their children turn out
to be of the wrong race. No abortions for families who object to
abortion; they can use coat hangers if they want abortions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While I agree with the sentiment of the post, I've got to point out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something about Bob Dylan.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from allmusic.com:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;At the conclusion of the tour in late 1978, Dylan announced that he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a born-again Christian, and he launched a series of Christian
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; albums that following summer with Slow Train Coming. Though the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reviews were mixed, the album was a success, peaking at number three
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and going platinum. His supporting tour for Slow Train Coming featured
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only his new religious material, much to the bafflement of his long-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; term fans. Two other religious albums - Saved (1980) and Shot of Love
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1981) - followed, both to poor reviews. In 1982, Dylan traveled to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Israel, sparking rumors that his conversion to Christianity was short-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived. He returned to secular recording with 1983's Infidels, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was greeted with favorable reviews.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rumor has it that Dylan has abandoned religion, and if not it at least
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems as if he has turned it into something private that he no longer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feels any reason to discuss in public. In any case, his &quot;religious
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phase&quot; is basically described by any rock historian as the absolute
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; low point of his career and most of his fans either don't know about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it or don't want to talk about it.

Extreme unction is ideally administered when a dying person is compos
mentis but in a pinch, it may be administered after physical death
since it is effective until the soul has departed the body which might
happen only some time after physical death. Or so goes the theory.

A thanksgiving mass is for cases where a dying person recovers. If a
miscarried embryo or fetus can recover, that would be a miracle.
