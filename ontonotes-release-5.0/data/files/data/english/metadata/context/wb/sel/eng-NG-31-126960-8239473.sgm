Oh sure, I guess I'll have to go first. At any given point there are a
few posters I'd choose - The Other Mickey and Moni (and a few others)
for their vast knowledge of music; Judy for her baking skills; Dave
and TC for their sense of fun; Bob R. for his brains, SantaS for his
love of animals and compassionate nature and on and on............but
I'm going to pick Flkofcguls for his whacky humor. I know there are
some in the group who take exception to Flk's style but I totally love
it and would like to make someone else laugh as hard as he's made me
laugh many a time.

Why, thank you, Fille!  I guess someone wanting to be like me cause of
my &quot;baking skills&quot;  would be a good thing? :-D If on my tombstone it
read &quot;Here Likes Judy..She Was A Great Baker&quot;, that would be better than
some things. Would rather be known for that, than being a &quot;great
housekeeper&quot; (which I am NOT!) or something along those lines!

Actually....I wouldn't mind being a  combination of several on
here....Moni (she is a peacemaker, who we REALLY need on here at times!)
and yes, SantaSteeler for his love of animals and also his cheesecakes,
and besides, how dull life would be without a Santa! Oh, yes, and
Flkofcguls for his wacky sense of humor, as well as Dave, Vandar, and TC
(I also admire him for standing up for our great country, and sticking
to his guns..no pun intended!) and for the more knowledgable ones....Bob
Rudd, The Other Mickey, Nathan, Bigolhomo, and then there is LOTS if
great other people on here-- too many to name, but always enjoy you
friend Fille, AND...Giggles, Xan, Dixichik, Greg, Mike, Don, Zob, Cal,
Callen, Sanna, Sheila, Tzigaane, Kim, KC, Itoshi, ??????? and the list

interesting, and just &quot;good people!&quot; If I could be a little of each of
you, I'd be &quot;super woman&quot; for sure!  :o)

I don't know if there's anyone else on here I'd wanna be since I have
enough trouble just being myself, but there are a bunch of people on
here I'd love to be able to hang out with in person.  I know we always
joke about our pretend barbecue parties at Bob's house, but I think it

everyone but Tin@) and grill a few burgers and have a few beers.

Suzanne.....that is one strong-minded woman.  I respect that.  I don't
think she would back down if a raging bull was running straight toward
her.

As far as current posters, I would say tziganne because she lives near
my grandchildren and I could see them more often. :)  It also helps
that she's a musician, of course.

Thank you for giving me my laugh out loud for the day. :)  When my

son would marry my daughter.  The fact that they were 4 and 3 at the

&gt; &gt; Why, thank you, Fille!  I guess someone wanting to be like me cause of
&gt; &gt; my &quot;baking skills&quot;  would be a good thing? :-D If on my tombstone it
&gt; &gt; read &quot;Here Likes Judy..She Was A Great Baker&quot;, that would be better than
&gt; &gt; some things. Would rather be known for that, than being a &quot;great
&gt; &gt; housekeeper&quot; (which I am NOT!) or something along those lines!

&gt; &gt; Actually....I wouldn't mind being a  combination of several on
&gt; &gt; here....Moni (she is a peacemaker, who we REALLY need on here at times!)
&gt; &gt; and yes, SantaSteeler for his love of animals and also his cheesecakes,
&gt; &gt; and besides, how dull life would be without a Santa! Oh, yes, and
&gt; &gt; Flkofcguls for his wacky sense of humor, as well as Dave, Vandar, and TC
&gt; &gt; (I also admire him for standing up for our great country, and sticking
&gt; &gt; to his guns..no pun intended!) and for the more knowledgable ones....Bob
&gt; &gt; Rudd, The Other Mickey, Nathan, Bigolhomo, and then there is LOTS if
&gt; &gt; great other people on here-- too many to name, but always enjoy you
&gt; &gt; friend Fille, AND...Giggles, Xan, Dixichik, Greg, Mike, Don, Zob, Cal,
&gt; &gt; Callen, Sanna, Sheila, Tzigaane, Kim, KC, Itoshi, ??????? and the list
&gt; &gt; just goes on.....I know I'm forgetting some that are fun, and
&gt; &gt; interesting, and just &quot;good people!&quot; If I could be a little of each of
&gt; &gt; you, I'd be &quot;super woman&quot; for sure!  :o)

&gt; &gt; Judy

&gt; But remember, we are all Moni so we already *are* someone else on the ng.

Lurking on and off.  I've been doing a bunch of back-to-back trips
this summer, often without reliable internet access.

would have said something then.  And the sexual orientation isn't all
that bad, except for the whole thing about being treated as a
second-class citizen... :-P)

As for the main subject of this thread...  Tzigaane and I seem to have
the same brain, so I don't think that would be enough of a change to
be worth it.  Mickey would be interesting, because there's enough
similarity to be familiar, but enough differences to be exciting.

There's a lot of musically-minded folks around here, which would be a
fascinating new life for me, because I'm pretty tone-deaf... which
sucks because part of my job is analyzing speech!  Good thing I have
computers to analyze pitch for me!

However, at 33, I'm a relative youngster in the group, so I have to be
careful who I pick.  ;-)  I know who's older than me, but I'm not sure
who's younger.

I'm guessing that was probably not Mickey's primary reason for
requesting the change :-)
