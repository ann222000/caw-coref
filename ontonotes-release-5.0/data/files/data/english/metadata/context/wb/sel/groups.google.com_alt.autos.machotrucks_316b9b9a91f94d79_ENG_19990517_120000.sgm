Diesels always get better mileage, in my experience. Gas rigs are
preffered for towing, due to more low-end torque and quicker response,
but they usually only get 8-10 mpg.
My old 454 would carry a heavy old camper and gear for 4 people, up and
down and all around the usa, up to 100 miles an hour, but , OH, the
price I paid for all that instant power ! It has gotten as low as 5 mpg.
Still, it WAS fun, hearing the throb of all that torque. Now, my Ford
diesel gets at the least, 12 mpg. That's towing. Actually, I think in
the mountains it gets less than 12, but that's the general area. I'm
used to the rumble now, and I no longer hear it. My kids sleep to the
rythm of the road, and they love the sound of the old 6.9, as it lulls
them to sleep.

You got it backwards! Diesel has the torque down low. The gas has
Horsepower
which you want for accelleration. Torgue is to get the load rolling and
keep
it moving.Ever notice how a gas engine with cruise control on will down
shift at the slightest hint of a hill. The diesel is less suseptable to
this
due to the torque being 450ft lbs at 1600 rpms versus 300 ft lbs at 3200
rpm
for the gasser....Also the turbo charged diesels dont lose horsepower as
the
altitude increases. So at 6000 ft above sea leavel a gasser with 300
horse
is down to 210 horse. But not the turbod diesels or gas with turbos or
blowers....
