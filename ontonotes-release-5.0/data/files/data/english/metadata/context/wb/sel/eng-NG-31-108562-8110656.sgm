Circuit breaker trip puzzle

The house suddenly lost power a couple of days ago and on checking the
circuit breaker box I found the one controlling the immersion heater
had tripped. But that is not switched on (it hardly ever is), so how
could a leak be detected by the circuit breaker?

After resetting that breaker there has been no re-occurrence, but with
a two week holiday imminent I'm nervous that it may happen again. It's
no big deal to return to a house with maybe some of my
electronically-controlled devices switched on (lights, radio, TV,
garden waterfall, etc), as occasionally happens due to storm
lightning, or a widespread power failure, but the fridge and freezer
would be a major issue.

The immersion heater cable from the heater coil on top of the hot
water tank in the airing cupboard goes directly to the switch on the
wall, with no intervening mains plug/socket. So presumably, to get an
ohm reading on this unit to test for leakage, I have to first switch
off at the breaker box, remove the switch panel in the airing
cupboard, unscrew a connection, and work from there?

Any practical advice would be much appreciated please.

The immersion heater switch is normally a double pole type, so if it's
switched off, the heater element is completely isolated anyway, so cannot be
responsible for for its feed MCB detecting leakage. When you say that your
house had lost all power, was the actual consumer unit breaker tripped, as
well as the immersion heater MCB, leading you to believe that an immersion
heater failure had tripped both ?

If the whole house tripped out you've probably got one RCD for
everything. This works by looking for an imbalance in current flow
between the line and neutral - if everything is ok the current in each of
these will be identical. If, however, either of those conductors has a
fault to earth - doesn't have to be a short circuit - the device will
trip. And it can happen with a single pole switched device even when it's
off.

Mineral insulated heating elements like immersions and some oven elements
are notorious for this sort of fault - you get a slight leakage to earth,
but it still works ok. And it's unlikely to be the same on both legs so
upsets the RCD which trips.

These days most recommend a split load CU where only some circuits are
RCD protected, and things like the immersion and cooker - which are hard
wired so no safety implication there - are fed from the non RCD side.

&gt;Tripped MCB or RCCD/ELCB device?

Thanks for those prompt and helpful replies. I'm responding to the
requests for more info:

The unit is a 'Crabtree', and carries a label '8A/30mA'.

It has two sections:

CIRCUIT BREAKERS:
-----------------
1. Upstairs lights: 2 shaver-sockets in bathrooms; outside security
light (from loft extension)

2. Downstairs lights: hall, kitchen ceiling &amp; under cupboard,
downstairs toilet (and fan), cupboard under stairs (and alarm)

3. Downstairs lights: lounge, dining room

4. Transformer by board (This is an add-on of my own, as part of a
gadget to detect when the front door bell was pressed, to buzz a
garden extension. Not a possible culprit IMO.)

5. Spare

RCD PROTECTED CIRCUITS:
-----------------------

1. Immersion heater. (This is the one that tripped.)

2. Sockets (radial): My office. Too many items to list here.

3. Sockets (ring): Downstairs except kitchen (5); Garage (1); Upstairs
except main bedroom (6)

4. Sockets (ring): Main bedroom including spurs (1): Hall (1); Kitchen
(6), Utility (3), upstairs bedroom

5. Cooker and 1 socket by cooker switch.

I also have two other RCD units
- In garage mains socket, protecting garden and workshop circuits
- In lounge mains socket, protecting garden pond submersed pump

After the failure I thought *all* power was lost. But now I can't be
100% sure whether I had the lights on, and I don't recall checking
them. Certainly things like fridge, microwave, etc were off.

The only switch I reset in the Crabtree unit was the RCD one
controlling the immersion heater.

I haven't unscrewed the immersion heater wall switch yet, so can't
confirm whether it's single or double pole. But doesn't the fact that
this RCD was tripped mean that it *must* be single pole, with a leak?

Hope this helps further diagnosis.

Probably just that that RCD trip is more sensitive to unbalanced inductive
load on another circuit, usually the motor of a washing machine but
theoretically could be due to a neighbour using an arc welder, anything else
very inductive, distant lightening strike etc. If definitely no problem with
the immersion wiring then change the RCD.

All agreed. If it was only the MCB for the immersion circuit that had
tripped, this could not affect all the ring and radial power circuits ( and
possibly the lights too ! ) unless there is something seriously wrong with
the way it's all wired. You must be talking main RCD trip for that side, as
Dave says ? As far as the immersion switch goes, it could indicate single
pole and a leak for the MCB on that circuit tripping, but in order for all
the other stuff to have gone out as well, there must have been something
else tripped on the feed to that side's fuse bus.

Is this the SB6000 series by any chance, or at least that series/vintage?
(20 years old or more I'd think now!) There should be a label somewhere on
the fascia.

If so, these are known to get 'twitchy' as they age, the breakers trip for
no apparent reason and the only cure is replacement. However, I'm not sure
the individual breakers are available now, you may have to replace the
whole distribution box if it becomes troublesome- like I did!

If the problem reoccurs regularly it would be wise to consult an electrician
and get a quote. If it's just the immersion heater circuit though, you may
choose to just live with the minor inconvenience if it isn't regularly used
and spare breakers can't be sourced- changing the whole distribution box
isn't cheap!

Thanks for the follow-ups. I'm going to have to do some more careful
reading, maybe starting here
http://wiki.diyfaq.org.uk/index.php?title=RCD
as I don't really understand the basics, and hence some of the advice
given. Meanwhile, beginning to regret switching from my old fuse-based
unit a year or so ago!

The Crabtree is a modern modular unit, but so far I've not found its
spec. I'll do so as soon as possible and report back.

It could be that you had a brief general (street-level) outage, and that
when it came back on, for whatever reason, it tripped out the immersion
heater MCB. You would have expected that for that to happen, the immersion
switch would have needed to be on, but odd things like this can happen,
particularly if it is just a single pole switch. MCBs can be sensitive to
the strangest (non) fault conditions. If the consumer unit was replaced
recently by a reputable certified electrician, then there's a good chance
that there is nothing wrong with the wiring to it. A decent electrician
would probably have checked the external circuits for leakage whilst he was
doing the job. I think if I was in your position, I would probably wait and
see if there were any more 'events', but if you would prefer total peace of
mind, I wouldn't have expected it to cost *too* much to get an electrician
in (probably not the original guy, just in case, unless you know him and his
work well) to just check over the immersion circuit in particular for
leakage. I honestly don't think that he would find anything, because if your
recollection is correct, and you had a total power outage, but the only
thing tripped was the immersion MCB, I can't see any way that this could be
for any other reason than the actual feed to your house dropping out. The
fact that you had a 'known' outage the next day which was due to the feed
dropping out, might well suggest that the electricity company were either
doing some work on the loop that feeds you, where they often 're-route'
temporarily to kill the section that they are working on, whilst keeping the
subscribers live, or else that they were having some tripping or equipment
issues of their own. When these big old company breakers remake, they can
generate some pretty big spikes. I have a national grid switching station
not far from me, and when they have any switchover or breaker issues, it
lights up the sky like lightning !!

Many thanks, appreciate that thorough advice. It certainly would be
reassuring to believe that it *was* caused by a very brief 'brown-out'
or whatever you call these things. It could fit the facts too. On my
way out to the garage, where the CU is located (cursing a bit - I was
in the middle of authoring a DVD on my PC when it happened), I saw
that the cooker clock was still on. Now, a few months ago, after a bit
of telephone advice from the electrician, I disconnected the cooker
from the CU's control. This was because I wanted the facility to use
its wall socket for emergencies, prompted by an exciting event when
the old washing machine packed up with my laundry still inside. So,
seeing the clock still on, and the immersion heater trip switch
tripped, I concluded that it was a fault within my house, and posted
as I did. But as you say, it might have been a wide outage, at most a
few seconds long (rather than about 2 minutes like the one the
following day), and (again unlike the one the following day) it could
have caused that odd side effect.

One thing I *have* decided though is to capitalise on that cooker
socket and connect my fridge and freezer to it during our fortnight's
holiday ;-)

This puzzle now has another twist. I decided to do some methodical
leakage tests. My intention was to introduce a leakage from the live
connection of the circuit under test to a convenient earth, and
observe what tripped. That would at least confirm that I understood
what behaviour I was *supposed* to get from my Crabtree StarBreaker
CU. I used a couple of robust 15k resistors in parallel, theoretically
giving me a leakage around 32 mA (in my UK 240 V circuits).

I decided to start with an unimportant circuit, which also had an
extra RCD unit over and above the main CU. This is a double socket RCD
in the garage, fed from #3 on the Main Switch (non-RCD) side of the
CU. As expected, momentarily connecting this leakage current
immediately tripped the garage RCD. However, to my surprise, maybe 1-2
seconds later (with the leakage removed), the *main* switch on the CU
was tripped. So my PC and various household devices and clocks went
down despite my cunning plan ;-)

I'd not have expected this to happen, so could someone offer a
possible explanation please? Does it offer more insight into the odd
behaviour already reported?

In case it helps, the electrician's scrawled installation notes record
trip times of 18/19 ms for all the RCD circuits, and 7 ms for the
external garage RCD unit. There are various other columns like 'Loop
Impedance', 'CPC-CPC ohms', 'Ph-Ph ohms', 'R1+R2 or R2 ohms'; they
mean nothing to me but please let me know if they could help the
diagnosis.

Pondering this over a coffee shortly after hitting Send, I realised
that I was wrong to imply the devices on this circuit were
insignificant. I left all the devices in place when I applied the
leakage. Amongst other things, I have an ancient large DC power supply
in my shed/workshop (30A), permanently connected to provide automatic
garden lighting at dusk. I'm wondering if perhaps some sort of
inductive effect might be responsible? Could the sudden removal of
power from that and other lower-rated transformers have had the effect
observed? If so, my starting choice was poor, and I'll try another
circuit. Or maybe disconnect the two plugs from the garage RCD unit.

Well, that's certainly strange to me, and like you, not what I would have
expected. I suspect that you are now getting beyond my level of expertise
with this, so if I catch up with him in the next day or two, I will ask my
next door neighbour, who is a fully UK qualified electrician, and talks
about this sort of stuff all the time.

Can you confirm that it was the main switch on the far left that
tripped or was it the RCD in the middle? I suspect that the socket
outlet only disconnects the live conductor and not the neutral, very
common, hence your leakage providing a link between N and E possibly
combined with the power supply tripping the RCD. The main switch on
the left is purely a switch and contains no over current or RCD
device, if that has turned itself off then someone's playing tricks or
it needs to be changed, however I have never come across that 15
years.

On you main board the switch on the far left controls everything up to
the RCD (RCD included), and the RCD everything after that. I my
experience it's usually caused by an appliance somewhere, washing
machine, cooker and anything plugged in outside seem to be the popular
ones. Other less likely causes are loose contacts in a socket, and
mice.

Wait and see if it happens again, and note down what was on when it
went. If it seems to be at random get a spark in and get him to do an
insulation test at 250v with live and neutral joined to earth with
everything connected. It's not accepted practice but it usually finds
the fault! In my mind nothing has happened that seems especially odd,
and other than doing a quick test of earth loop impedance and RCD trip
times for peace of mind, I wouldn't look any further and advise to
wait and see.

It's a shame you don't live in Herefordshire or I'd offer to pop round
and do a quick check for a cup of coffee!

If it only happened the once I would be inclined to leave it. There
are a whole heap of things that can cause it trip, most of which are
one time only events that dissappear as soon as it happens, such as
power spikes. I would only investgate it heavily if it was tripping
regually ( &gt; once a month) and causing a nusance, otherwise your not
likely to find a fault. As for plugging the freezer into the cooker,
go ahead, it is common (and considered good practice) to provide a
single socket that is not RCD protected and on its own breaker for it,
Although that won't be allowed under the next regs, you will however
be able to plug it in in the bathroom......

&gt;&gt;Indeed! But a very welcome second-best would be for you to hang on in
&gt;&gt;here with me in the thread until either I get a resolution or terminal
&gt;&gt;boredom sets in ;-)

&gt; If it only happened the once I would be inclined to leave it. There
&gt; are a whole heap of things that can cause it trip, most of which are
&gt; one time only events that dissappear as soon as it happens, such as
&gt; power spikes. I would only investgate it heavily if it was tripping
&gt; regually ( &gt; once a month) and causing a nusance, otherwise your not
&gt; likely to find a fault. As for plugging the freezer into the cooker,
&gt; go ahead, it is common (and considered good practice) to provide a
&gt; single socket that is not RCD protected and on its own breaker for it,
&gt; Although that won't be allowed under the next regs, you will however
&gt; be able to plug it in in the bathroom......

Unfortunately not, under the next revision of the regs (17th edition)
(proposed)  socket outlets are permitted providing they are 3 m from a
bath or shower and RCD protected. Currently no sockets can be
installed in a room containing a bath or shower no matter how big the
room is. It's mainly for B&amp;B's and hotels that have a shower in the
corner of the room. The rest of Europe has allowed them for many
years. Local bonding in a bathroom has also been axed if all circuits
in the bathroom are RCD protected.

I see a few RCD's fail every year, either taking too long trip or not
tripping at all. I will not be installing sockets in bathrooms (except
hotel rooms) and I will continue to do bonding regardless of whether
or not the circuits have a RCD protection!

Please note that the 17th edition is still in draft stage and may be
subject to change on final release. For anyone interested the current
draft copy can be found here:

One of the entertainment venues I work at has no sockets in the dressing
rooms because there are showers. When I enquired if we could fit RCD
protected sockets, I was told in no uncertain terms No.

So what happens now is that artists plug their own mains extension cable
into a socket in the corridor outside the dressing room and under the door!

Boy oh boy. Considering all the crap that they recently subjected us all to
with regard to not being allowed to wire up your own garden shed, or add new
circuits, or even alter light fittings without getting Building Inspector
approval and an electrician who's signed off to certify the job, that
beggars belief ...

Yup - this is exactly what some do for drying/clipping hair in their
bathroom - so they can use the mirror.

I've oft wondered if a transformer isolated 13 amp socket - 3kW isolating
transformer - would conform to the current regs?

I doubt it. I belive current regs only permit an isolated transformer
receptical for small motorised appliances or chargers, such as razors or
toohtbrushes.
