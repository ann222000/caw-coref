I was just sent a vote.com query about Bush pardoning Libby.

I assume that would be the proper and honorable thing to do.  The previous
administration showed its acceptablity and even how to funnel the money
properly.  Since Libby has 3 million thought, he probably ought to get
proper advice from Bill, for the proper fee of course!

Libby was one of the attorneys who helped Marc Rich arrange for his pardon
by Clinton. It's a happy little club. They all know how to make these things
work.

Didn't know that about Libby. But it does seem that there are actually just
a fairly small number of those "in the loop" in Washington.  They, including
Bush, Kerry etc. all belong to same clubs, hire same advisors etc.  When a
Repub or Dem gets voted (or kicked) out office, their staff immediately
migrages and is loyal to where ever there is a vacancy regardless of party.
Sen/Rep goes to work for a lobbyist he was villifying on Fox or CNN
yesterday.......  Must be the air or water!

You are aware that the person to be pardoned is guilty of a crime and
must  be remorsefully?

What Libby did is no different than what organized crime figures do -
a person keeps thier mouth shut and takes the fall.  The crime family
takes care of their family, protects them in jail, and give them back
their job when they get out.

As a former registered republican that still believes "we are a nation
of laws and not men", I must say republicans today are not interested
in laws, just ideology.

Libby was found guilty of his crimes by a jury of his peers.  To ask
for a pardon is jury nulification but I doubt you agreed with the OJ
verdict, which was also jury nulification.

Get a grip.  Reassess what you are doing, how you are being used by
republican people in power.

Your obsession with Clinton is blinding you to this administration's
complete disregard for the constitution.

Clinton took the impeachment like a man.  No whining, no complaining,
no one on the left calling for a pardon.  I bet Clinton would not
accept a pardon.

What do you think is going on with the firing of the federal
prosecutors?  One of Karl Rove's assistants was put into the New
Mexico prosecutor position after Cummings was fired.  Another was told
he was appointed to a federal prosecutor job to get resume experience
so he could be appointed a judge.  Before you give me a flip answer
consider the "consequences" when a dreaded Democratic president has

I thought I had my tongue in my cheek initially (well sort of).

As far as I know Libby didn't ask for a pardon, its wildass speculation.

I was showing the similarities in the pardons by Clinton and the speculation
on Bush giving one to Libby for the money apparently involved.  We all know
there is never in quid pro quo for a pardon, its illegal.

ACAA gets it. You don't.  Clinton lied about a BJ.  Who cares?  It wasn't a
proper subject for investigation and questions about the President's sex
life shouldn't have been put to him under oath, anyway.  As regards a
President's sex life, he has only the First Lady (or the First Husband,
after Hillary wins) to answer to.

The Bush team appears to be illegally using the identity of CIA operatives
to foster political advantage.  That's illegal, a subversion of
Constitutional processes and is a subject appropriate for investigation and
questions about it should be put to people under oath.

And, of course, the larger picture is that this Administration is so
habitually and brazenly deceitful and so thoroughly and hopelessly
incompetent that one of them got convicted for lying when there was no
reason to lie.

Was the intern over 18 and was he/she a consenting partner?  If yes,
then nothing would happen.  You sound jealous that Bill got a blow
job.  Take a few Viagras and go find a blow job.  You'll feel much
better after.

And remember, Bill lied but nobody died.  People may have even died as
the direct result of the outing of Valery Plame.  It's possible some
of her contacts were killed.

Depends on whether the corporation had any rules governing such things.
Meanwhile, this country has no law prohibiting the president from getting a
blowjob from an intern in the White House, at any time of the day or night.

The corporate officer would certainly not be called before a grand jury, so

It is coming to that soon.  First we should start with Alberto

.&gt; You are talking out of your ass again.  You have no clue.

But you always recognize my voice, and compliment my breath.

I guess you missed Alberto Gonzoles' testimony in front of congress.
In fact, AG made the habeas corpus statement as an answer to an Arlen
Spector question and Arlen sat there stunned for about 10 seconds.
Everybody associated with Bush is incompetent and very dangerous to
the constitution.

Wrongo..........

Hey Legend in your own mind....

You misspelled one of the companies you supposedly worked for.  They
probably fired you.

Here are a few of the rules for one of your 'former employers'....

How about Merrill Lynch?

Access to the Internet
Only authorized connections to the Internet are permitted and access
must be accomplished via an approved secure gateway. Merrill Lynch
employees are not permitted to link to the Internet from Merrill Lynch
offices via modem dial-up services or other external service providers
without the express approval of the Office of General Counsel.

Employees should exercise good judgment when using the Internet for
personal reasons during business hours. Under Merrill Lynch policy,
employees may not:

*
transmit, copy or download any material, including sexually
explicit images or messages and materials containing racial, ethnic or
other slurs, that may defame, embarrass, threaten, offend or harm a
Merrill Lynch person or client or the general public;

Obligation to Report Violations or Misconduct
All Merrill Lynch persons are expected to act quickly and effectively
against violations of the Guidelines and the firm’s policies and
procedures. Employees are obligated to report any known or perceived
violation of law, regulation or Merrill Lynch policy and Guidelines to
one of the following resources: their manager, a Leadership &amp; Talent
Management representative, the Ethics Hotline, or the Office of
General Counsel. If you are unsure about the best course of action,
you should consult with one of the above resources. Likewise, if you
are not comfortable raising an ethical issue or discussing a possible
or actual violation with your manager, or you have done so and the
manager has not responded to the problem, you must seek assistance
elsewhere within Merrill Lynch and report the matter through one of
the alternative resources, that is, a Leadership &amp; Talent Management
representative, the Office of General Counsel, or the Ethics Hotline.

The Office of General Counsel is available to assist with business
conduct and ethical issues that give you concern. Nevertheless, in
many instances, you must rely on your own personal ethical standards
in assessing difficult situations. Consider the following questions:

*
Is the proposed action legal?
*
Does it endanger anyone's financial stability, life, health or
safety?
*
Is it consistent with Merrill Lynch policy?
*
Will it enhance the company's reputation?
*
Would we lose clients if this action were known to them?
*
Would you like to see it become a general industry or public
practice?
*
Would you be embarrassed if all the details were known by your
manager, peers, subordinates, family or friends, or if they were
published in a newspaper?
*
Could this action in any way be interpreted as, or appear to be,
inappropriate behavior?
*
What would you think of your manager, peers or subordinates if
any of them behaved similarly?
*
Does the action you are considering make you feel uncomfortable?
Are you compromising your own personal ethics in any way?

Though romantic relationships between employees and situations where
an employee is working with a relative are not prohibited at Merrill
Lynch, Merrill Lynch policy does impose special requirements when one
of these employees remains in the other employee’s (the
manager/supervisor) chain of command.  In such circumstances, Merrill
Lynch policy requires that steps be taken to ensure that such
relationships do not disrupt the group and that the manager/supervisor
is not responsible for supervising, evaluating or compensating the
other employee.

This bears no relationship to civil law. Grand juries get involved with the
law of the land. If a corporation wants to can someone for breaking a rule,
they do not need to involve the court system.

Director one is before the grand jury because there is an
investigation of a corporation involving insider trading.

Director one is asked if he has had sex with an intern.

Director one says no.

Further investigation shows he is lying.

1/2 second after the director was asked about sex, his lawyer would be out
of his chair crying foul, and we would be correct because sex has nothing to
do with insider trading. It would be obvious (to anyone but an idiot) that
the prosecutor was simply trying to color the jury's opinion of the
director.

It would certainly work on you, if you were on the jury.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Describe a situation in which a grand jury would get involved in sexual
&gt;&gt;&gt;matters between two people in an office, ASSUMING that neither person
&gt;&gt;&gt;complained about the sexual liason?

&gt;&gt; ROFLAMO

&gt;&gt; I see I've nailed you again.

&gt;&gt; I'll play for a bit...

&gt;&gt; Director one is before the grand jury because there is an
&gt;&gt; investigation of a corporation involving insider trading.

&gt;&gt; Director one is asked if he has had sex with an intern.

&gt;&gt; Director one says no.

&gt;&gt; Further investigation shows he is lying.
&gt;&gt; Scott in  Florida

&gt;1/2 second after the director was asked about sex, his lawyer would be out
&gt;of his chair crying foul, and we would be correct because sex has nothing to
&gt;do with insider trading. It would be obvious (to anyone but an idiot) that
&gt;the prosecutor was simply trying to color the jury's opinion of the
&gt;director.

&gt;It would certainly work on you, if you were on the jury.

Frequently Asked Questions About the Grand Jury System

What is the purpose of the grand jury?

The primary function of the modern grand jury is to review the
evidence presented by the prosecutor and determine whether there is
probable cause to return an indictment.

The original purpose of the grand jury was to act as a buffer
between the king (and his prosecutors) and the citizens. Critics argue
that this safeguarding role has been erased, and the grand jury simply
acts as a rubber stamp for the prosecutor.

Since the role of the grand jury is only to determine probable
cause, there is no need for the jury to hear all the evidence, or even
conflicting evidence. It is left to the good faith of the prosecutor
to present conflicting evidence.

In the federal system, the courts have ruled that the grand jury
has extraordinary investigative powers that have been developed over
the years since the 1950s. This wide, sweeping, almost unrestricted
power is the cause of much of the criticism. The power is virtually in
complete control of the prosecutor, and is pretty much left to his or
her good faith.

Can a lawyer accompany his or her client inside the grand jury room?

In the federal system, a witness cannot have his or her lawyer
present in the grand jury room, although witnesses may interrupt their
testimony and leave the grand jury room to consult with their lawyer.
A few states do allow a lawyer to accompany the witness; some allow
the lawyer to advise his or her client, others merely allow the lawyer
to observe the proceeding.

That's not a good example.  Around here, almost everybody would grab up that

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ask
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a pardon is jury nulification but I doubt you agreed with the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OJ
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; verdict, which was also jury nulification.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Get a grip.  Reassess what you are doing, how you are being used
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; republican people in power.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; klinton not only lied, but he lied under oath, perjury, a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; felony......jail time for klinton, but he wiggled out of it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Your obsession with Clinton is blinding you to this administration's
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; complete disregard for the constitution.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Clinton took the impeachment like a man.  No whining, no complaining,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; no one on the left calling for a pardon.  I bet Clinton would not
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; accept a pardon.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think is going on with the firing of the federal
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; prosecutors?  One of Karl Rove's assistants was put into the New
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Mexico prosecutor position after Cummings was fired.  Another was
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; told
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he was appointed to a federal prosecutor job to get resume experience
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; so he could be appointed a judge.  Before you give me a flip answer
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; consider the &quot;consequences&quot; when a dreaded Democratic president has
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the same powers.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; See?  Avoiding the question...  Too bad.  When people dialog both

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I'm buying a Honda Fit.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; A

&gt; &gt; &gt; You didn't get it did ya, LOL.

&gt; &gt; ACAA gets it. You don't.  Clinton lied about a BJ.  Who cares?  It wasn't a
&gt; &gt; proper subject for investigation and questions about the President's sex
&gt; &gt; life shouldn't have been put to him under oath, anyway.  As regards a
&gt; &gt; President's sex life, he has only the First Lady (or the First Husband,
&gt; &gt; after Hillary wins) to answer to.

&gt; &gt; The Bush team appears to be illegally using the identity of CIA operatives
&gt; &gt; to foster political advantage.  That's illegal, a subversion of
&gt; &gt; Constitutional processes and is a subject appropriate for investigation and
&gt; &gt; questions about it should be put to people under oath.

&gt; &gt; And, of course, the larger picture is that this Administration is so
&gt; &gt; habitually and brazenly deceitful and so thoroughly and hopelessly
&gt; &gt; incompetent that one of them got convicted for lying when there was no
&gt; &gt; reason to lie.

&gt; Tell the truth, I don't read more than the first sentence of your
&gt; postings.  Started a couple weeks ago when you yet again repeated
&gt; yourself.  bye.

Holy crow.  DH's posts are among the most intelligent, rational ones
in here. They actually have reasoned content.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; No. Waiting for Scott to explain how the courts would get involved
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; situation where someone in an office accidentally unplugged the water
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cooler. He can't.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I thought it was about sex in the office.

&gt;&gt; Same thing, unless you're a fake saint and you claim they're not the same
&gt;&gt; thing. If you'd like something more annoying than the water cooler
&gt;&gt; example,
&gt;&gt; here's another: Breaking donuts in half and leaving the half in the box,
&gt;&gt; so
&gt;&gt; nobody wants to eat it.

&gt; Or how about leaving the donut box open overnight with day old donuts.
&gt; Worse yet, leaving an empty open donut box overnight.

&gt; Now get back to the more serious, SEX in the office.
">

Why is it serious? Here's Scott's theory:

Let's say two people happily have sex in the office, and neither of them has
a problem with it. Later, one of them is hauled before a grand jury because
of insider trading. If you were on that jury, and a lawyer asked the
employee "Did you have sex in the office?", what would you think about the
lawyer asking that question?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That's not a good example.  Around here, almost everybody would grab

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; would
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; take it before the end of the day.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yeah, we're a rough crowd.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; OK. Let's crank it up: Someone pours the last of the coffee, puts the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pot
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; back on the burner, and doesn't turn off the heat. The pot cracks.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; only pot in the office. Now we're talking grand jury action, you bet.

&gt;&gt; &gt; get back to the sex in the office.  you are diverting attention again.

&gt;&gt; OK. Do you want to take over this debate from Scott, or should we wait
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; him to come back?

&gt; There's no question that Scott has left you speechless.  I'm waiting for
&gt; a response to Scott from you.

Scott's all done with this. He won't be back. My response is a question for
you, also posted in another message, in case you missed it. Actually, this
was Scott's example:

&gt; The prosecutor can ask any question he/she wants to ask.  Even the

&gt; Your best bet is to say I don't remember (Bill Clinton) or I don't know
&gt; and try, try to keep your big mouth shut as much as you can.  I know it
&gt; would be very hard for you.

I asked if you thought it was APPROPRIATE for anyone to ask such an
unrelated question, not whether is was LEGAL. It would be obvious to any
sentient being that in this context, the question was completely ridiculous.

By the way, I want to thank you for being a perfect example of a
deuterostome, particularly since you never progressed past the stage which
defines the word. You're the poster boy.
