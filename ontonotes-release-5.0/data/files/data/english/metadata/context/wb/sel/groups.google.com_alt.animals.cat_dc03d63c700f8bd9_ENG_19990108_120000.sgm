NOTE TO CAT LOVERS!!!!: The following is all sarcasm, I love my cats and
am against hurting animals!

You know, based on the &quot;rational&quot; arguments of April and other cat
mutilators, I have come to a decision...

I REALLY love my furniture more than my kitty. After all my kitty is
just a toy and decoration for me to play with and alter as I please to
fit my needs. It's really just a status symbol to make my family life
look complete and healthy.
I don't want anything to hurt my beautiful furniture and carpet, that
would ruin the picture I am trying to paint of the ideal home. So, it
comes that I must de-penis my male cat. Afterall, he does spray and pee
and I just can't have that. It's for his own good. I mean, if he sprays,
I will become upset and hurt his feelings. I don't want him to feel bad
if I yell at him. Carrying him away and training him not to spray would
just be too traumatic. Of course neutering is just unnatural, so that
should be avoided.
De-penising will also benefit my other kitties. They will all be equal
and unenvious. The female cat will not be jealous of what the other cat
has.
I think that all pet owners should de-penis. More cats would find homes
if they didn't spray or pee. Afterall NOONE wants a cat to disrupt their
lives.
This operation will also save money. I wont have to use as much kitty
litter.
The vet will also be very happy, he will get more money from me.
Of course, I don't have to think about the cat's discomfort or
abhoration at the surgery because... he can't tell me!
There are so many wonderful reasons to depenis your cat. All of them are
very beneficial to the owners, and of course, the kitty can't complain!
I love playing with pets and altering them! Its like redecorating or
remodeling! I want everything to be perfect and suit my needs. Afterall,
I am the superior human in this relationship. I may also look into
de-anusing so I wont have to worry about cat poop.
What a wonderful world this will be! I can change all of nature to fit
my needs!

Right on! Sounds too perfect to be true. I truly hope people will get the
message and stop declawing their cats! My cat was declawed before I got her
and she has never walked the same. She also growls if you touch her paws. My
other two are not declawed and I have never had any problems with
scratching. They are all indoor/outdoor cats. Mostly indoor though. Please
listen to this post. For your cats sake.

My Moo-Moo is declawed. He was that way when I got him. I was looking for
a cat that was kind of mellow and sweet who wouldnt mind when my nine year
old son picked him up and carried him upstairs to bed. Well, then I got to
thinking...I could easily adopt a cat that was already declawed. So I did.
I saved him from an animal shelter who was going to put him in Kitty Heaven
the next day. He is a registered Black and White British Shorthair...I
thought that he was just a regular old cat with a sweet face. He is a big
guy (last time I took him to the vet to get weighed for his Frontline-2
weeks ago-he weighed 22 lbs. But he does not look fat(he does have a lot of
flab that hangs down about 3 inches from the floor.) My vet told me to
gradually switch him to a Lite diet if he gets fat, fat and to make sure
that he eats the same amount when he first goes on the diet. He said that a
cat cannot handle an extreme diet...that their systems cannot handle the
stress. My vet also told me that Moo-Moo is not fat for the size cat that
he is. He said that Moo-Moo's bones were thicker than most other cats, but
that he was also larger than most British S.H. cats that he's seen.
Does anyone know of a Kitten food that is not too high in fat that I could
feed to Moo-Moo. I am currently feeding him Eukanuba Kitten.
Would it hurt him if I mixed Lite food in there with his Kitten food.
Thank you, Elaine

Good for you!

My heart sank slightly when I saw &quot;declawing&quot; on the agenda again as it
seems to spark off some fairly unpleasant (and personal) posts.

Having read the &quot;pro&quot; declawing messages I was v. relieved to see yours!

My 8 year old black &amp; white rescue cat has all claws (illegal to declaw in
UK) goes outside whenever he wants and has yet to make 1 scratch mark on ANY
piece of furniture! Wouldn't care if he did anyway, it comes with all the
rest of being a cat owner/slave!

Best wishes to you and your cats for 1999.

That is a great idea!!! I think if I ever have a son I'll de-penis him
as well. I mean why bother going through all the trouble of toilet
training when I can solve my laziness problem by yanking off his peepee.
Hell while I am at it I might just de-penis myself. Think of all the
time I'll save by not having to go to the washroom. I can just sit
there all day long on my nice furniture and be happy knowing that I
don't ever have to get up and go to the washroom. Ahhh, this is the
life. Just me and my furniture. I love you furniture!!!

Now where did my son go?? This crawling thing he does is rather
annoying, takes me away from my furniture. Maybe I should look into
amputation, I'll bet I could spend a lot more time with my furniture
after that.

Declawing illegal in Norway too.
I didn't know that you could actually do that until I went to the States and
lived with a family with declawed cats.

"/> Thank you, Paul. From this reply, I know that you've been reading &amp;
understanding my posts by looking at them objectively, as I have yours.
Whenever the &quot;people who have declawed cats love their furniture more than
their cats&quot; line comes up, my first thought has been, &quot;Oh, right - like I'd
drag an upholstered chair out of the house, instead of getting the cats
out - in their carriers, if time permitted.&quot; The first post in this thread
presented the perfect opportunity to say this, although I've refrained from
sarcasm so far. Several weeks ago, I got a phone call at work, the
secretary saying before the call was transferred in, &quot;Cathy, your neighbor
is calling. If you need to leave immediately, we can get you coverage.&quot;
(I'm a teacher.) My first thought was, &quot;Oh my God, the house is on fire and
the cats are trapped in there.&quot; It turned out to be nothing of the kind -
phew. And yes, you're right, if declawing were to be outlawed, I'd still
have cats, as you read in another post. My 1st cat was fully armed, and she
did do a real number on some furniture, but I dearly loved her, and still
miss her. Cathy

In regards to your question about the food.....yes, mixing a little of the
new food in with the old food is a good idea.......gradually add more of the
new food until that's all they're eating.
My Midnight was getting very large, and he sounds like he's built like your
Bristish SH...big boned, long body, big paws, not looking fat except for the
&quot;hanging down&quot; part...hehehe
When he got to 20 lbs, I decided he was getting just a tad too big, and put
him on a &quot;diet&quot;, which has been successful as he's lost a few pounds, and
none the worse for wear. He has more energy and doesn't get out of breath
so easily now. Eventhough the vet wasn't concerned about his weight yet,
I've read enough articles about obese cats to know it wasn't really good for
him to get too fat. Hope this helps:) Lacy

&gt;&gt; De-penising will also benefit my other kitties. They will all be equal
&gt;&gt; and unenvious. The female cat will not be jealous of what the other cat

&gt;&gt; I think that all pet owners should de-penis. More cats would find homes
&gt;&gt; if they didn't spray or pee. Afterall NOONE wants a cat to disrupt their
&gt;&gt; lives.
&gt;&gt; This operation will also save money. I wont have to use as much kitty
&gt;&gt; litter.
&gt;&gt; The vet will also be very happy, he will get more money from me.
&gt;&gt; Of course, I don't have to think about the cat's discomfort or
&gt;&gt; abhoration at the surgery because... he can't tell me!
&gt;&gt; There are so many wonderful reasons to depenis your cat. All of them are
&gt;&gt; very beneficial to the owners, and of course, the kitty can't complain!
&gt;&gt; I love playing with pets and altering them! Its like redecorating or
&gt;&gt; remodeling! I want everything to be perfect and suit my needs. Afterall,
&gt;&gt; I am the superior human in this relationship. I may also look into
&gt;&gt; de-anusing so I wont have to worry about cat poop.
&gt;&gt; What a wonderful world this will be! I can change all of nature to fit
&gt;&gt; my needs!

There's a movement afoot in some states to make cruelty to animals a
felony (rather than just a misdemeanor). I think there's a bill being
considered in New York State right now.

Good thing not just for furries and their fans but for everyone,
considering that sadism toward animals often leads to far nastier
crimes against Homo sapiens later. It's one of the prime indicators of
those who later become serial killers. Not that those folks are
discouraged by felony charges, but if they pile up three felonies you
know what happens...

"/> Thanks, Cathy. You're right on all counts. One problem I have with
the whole declaw debate is that it's extremely divisive.
Animal-lovers, whether they are 'pro' or 'anti' on this subject, are
of one mind when it comes to horrifying acts of wanton cruelty
committed for pure sadistic pleasure. While I do believe declawing to
be a serious issue worthy of discussion, I hate it when it turns ugly,
because we have far worse enemies in common, at whom our righteous
venom should properly be directed.

"/> Yes, thank you for mentioning this, Amy. I have been active in these
efforts for a couple of years now. And we've had quite a bit of
success. In fact, some forms of animal abuse are now a felony in 21
states. Efforts failed in New York last year, but hopefully they will
succeed this time around.

There is stiff opposition from some circles, but the efforts do seem
to have the support of a majority of Americans (this according to
polls -- for whatever they're worth). We need to educate more
legislators about the link to crimes against humans; many who balk at
&quot;animal rights&quot; would have to agree that reducing/preventing serial
killings and other violence against people is a worthwhile goal.

&gt; My Moo-Moo is declawed. He was that way when I got him. I was looking for

&gt; thinking...I could easily adopt a cat that was already declawed.

"/> And this is exactly the kind of ignorance that allows this abhorent
practice to continue.

You seriously believe that the only way your son could safely pick up
and carry a cat is if it is declawed? You think that only declawed cats
are &quot;mellow and sweet&quot;? If you understand the animal so little, why on
earth did you want one as a pet? You clearly have absolutely no idea
about cats.

Just how do you think the millions and millions of children outside the
United States manage to live in perfect harmony with fully-clawed cats?
How did I manage to survive my formative years surrounded by cats
without losing limbs or being lacerated from head to foot?

Whether or not a cat is &quot;mellow and sweet&quot; depends on the way you treat
it, not on whether or not it has claws. If you treat a cat with love
and kindness it will respond with the same in spades. It is not in the
cat's nature to be vicious and it will only scratch or bite if it feels
threatened.

If your son was going to ill-treat it then he might have been scratched
- and rightly so - but if he treats the cat with kindness there was no
reason for him ever to have been scratched. I have been scratched once
by one of my cats when he was frightened by someone else and
inadvertently scratched my arm with his back claws as he leapt out of my
arms. Other than that I have *never* been scratched by one of my cats
in 30 years. Never.

Ignorance like this is breathtaking.

dogs is covered - tho not cats *snarl* - as dogs are &quot;property&quot; but
the law doesn't cover pain and suffering of the &quot;owner&quot; when they
loose their precious companion.

&gt;Thanks, Cathy. You're right on all counts. One problem I have with
&gt;the whole declaw debate is that it's extremely divisive.
&gt;Animal-lovers, whether they are 'pro' or 'anti' on this subject, are
&gt;of one mind when it comes to horrifying acts of wanton cruelty
&gt;committed for pure sadistic pleasure. While I do believe declawing to
&gt;be a serious issue worthy of discussion, I hate it when it turns ugly,
&gt;because we have far worse enemies in common, at whom our righteous
&gt;venom should properly be directed.

Getting back to cats and house fires, I have smoke detectors and sprinklers in
every room in my house because of the building codes in my state. But they won't
do my cat any good if no one is at home when a fire breaks out. I called a
monitored alarm company to install additional smoke detectors in my home so that
if they should ever go off, the alarm company will immediately call my local
fire department and me, and 4 other people who live close by to alert us that
the house may be on fire and there is a family cat in the house. I couldn't
give a damn about furniture, getting my cat to safety is my only priority.

Oh you can just kiss my butt. I am very happy with my cat. I did not
choose to declaw my cat, someone else did. My son (9) loves cats, I love
cats. My son is very gentle and knows the correct way to support a cat when
holding one. He is old enough to realize that &quot;most&quot; cats will let you hold
them when they are willing(and some dont let you know when they are).
I am a responsible owner and most of all MOTHER to my child and pet.
certainly I would never want my child to get a claw through his lip and have
ill feelings for the cat. I know that I made the correct decision for
myself, my son and my cat.
Moo-Moo was at the end of his time at the shelter and I feel as if I did the
right thing anda you or no-one else will make me feel otherwise.
YOU are the ignorant one here!

Sure! The best internet list (IMHO) of states and charges can be
found at lisaviolet's website:

http://www.lisaviolet.com/cathouse/cruelty.html

I'm not sure if it's *completely* up to date, but if not, it's pretty
close.

If you're interested in getting involved, you might check out the
Animal Legal Defense Fund's website, too, starting with their Zero
Tolerance For Cruelty page:

http://www.aldf.org/zero.htm

Also look at their Animal Cruelty Actionline:

http://www.aldf.org/line.htm

I've been working with ALDF since early 1997. Last year I wrote (for
them and HSUS) an annotated cruelty law manual, explaining the
statutes and caselaw in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
HSUS was planning to combine this with a &quot;how-to&quot; manual for getting
legislation passed to strengthen the cruelty laws nationwide.
However, I have not heard from them since shortly after I sent them my
manuscript, so I'm not sure if they're pursuing with it. [Note to
myself: I really ought to find out what's going on with that.]

I was looking for a cat that had a great disposition. I went to the shelter
and asked the guide about cats there that he thought were really sweet and
loving. He took me to the cat that I have now. He said that he was
neutered and declawed. I was not looking for a cat that was declawed...just
looking for one that was sweet and mellow.
Why not adopt a cat that was declawed- if you intend to keep him/her indoors
and do not have any other cats?
He was not the only one in the shelter that was declawed (there was one more
that was brought in the previous day). He was not the only one in the
shelter that was a sweet cat. There were plenty of other cats there...lots
in fact. I think that he was the guide's favorite, or maybe the guide
thought that the chances of him getting adopted were slim...he had one day
left before getting put to sleep.
I'm sorry that I did not explain myself better.
I have read up on cats who are declawed and I know the drawbacks.
Maybe people will think about them before they go and have their cat
declawed.
You have to think about the cat.
Moo-Moo has not had any problems with the litterbox...which I have heard
that some cats do after being declawed. His ballance is fine...and he has
no problem with us touching his feet.
I think that everyone has a right to their own opinion. Wether or not
people want to declaw or not declaw is up to them. If we get a law passed
that is against declawing that is Okay with me.
Opinions are like buttholes....everyone has one.
Thank you Megan,

Elaine

"/> Elaine - just curious, does your vet know that your cat is on kitten food?
I'd strongly recommend putting him on cat food right away. And reducing his
intake, to reduce his weight. Kitten and cat foods are formulated
differently, because the needs of growing and adult cats are different.
There's no reason for your cat to be eating kitten food. Also, I understand
that your vet is aware of the cat's weight, but maybe you can speak with him
about health risks associated with obesity. It can be very dangerous.

Moo-Moo is not even a year old yet.
I talked with my vet about his weight and the vet said that he is perfectly
healthy.
I am going to mix adult maint. gradually into his diet.
My vet stated to me that I should not reduce is food in any way. He said
that it could be dangerous if I were to make him lose weight in a short
period of time. It could cause his body to shut down.
He said with cats you have to take change slowly and carefully.
He stated that Moo-Moo is a large cat.
Someone else from this news group who has a British Shorthair ,as well, said
that they can get pretty big esp the males. They have bigger bones and are
built differently than other breeds.
I have seen pictures of severely overweight cats...Moo-Moo is not that way.
(He does have a large dangling tummy)I just do not want him getting that
way.
Thank you for your suggestions,
Elaine

&gt;Elaine - just curious, does your vet know that your cat is on kitten food?
&gt;I'd strongly recommend putting him on cat food right away. And reducing
his
&gt;intake, to reduce his weight. Kitten and cat foods are formulated
&gt;differently, because the needs of growing and adult cats are different.
&gt;There's no reason for your cat to be eating kitten food. Also, I
understand
&gt;that your vet is aware of the cat's weight, but maybe you can speak with
him
&gt;about health risks associated with obesity. It can be very dangerous.

"/> Which is extremely sensible, a cat doesn't have to be severely
overweight to be too heavy. It may be that Moo-Moo is a large cat by
nature, but far too many cats are &quot;killed with kindness&quot; by being
overfed by over-indulgent owners and it always pays to keep an eye on
your cat's weight to ensure this doesn't happen. Far better for a cat's
long-term health prospects that it should be slightly &quot;deprived&quot; rather
than overweight.

One of my cats has a tendency to become a little overweight on occasion,
so I weigh him once a month to monitor him. If his weight starts to
rise a bit then I switch him to a &quot;light&quot; food for a month or so until
his weight returns to what it should be. Switching his food means that
he can still eat the same amount but he takes in less calories. It
doesn't happen often, I only need to do this maybe a couple of times a
year, but if I don't do it then the weight rise tends to continue and it
becomes a harder battle.

together seemed to indicate that because you wanted your son to be able
to pick up the cat you wanted a cat that would be harmless, but then you
realised you could get one that was already declawed. The logical
interpretation is that you think only a declawed cat would be &quot;safe&quot; for
your son to handle. The &quot;already declawed&quot; bit was just your excuse for
not having to actually do the dirty deed yourself (i.e. painkiller for
your conscience) but that you would have had it done it if you had not
found one that matched your ideal. I certainly read it that way.

A law against it *where*??

If you mean in the US? This is the land of the free! Home of opportunity!
Freedom of speech, religion and Choice??

Our vets make too much money off of it.. that is why it is not
illegal,-&gt;disclamer(IMNSHO) and america has turned into an ever so green
country where MONEY talks.

And there are laws against it in other countries.. Don't full yourself into
believing that jut because this is the United States of America, land of the
free that everything that we do in this country is morally and ethically
right.

Rhonda

P.s. do some deja news searching, PD has responded to many a posts besides
the declawing issue.. There are *many* of us here who are very passionate
about the declawing issue and will go through great legnths to defend the
animals who can not speak for themselves.. so don't you *dare* single her
out.

You have a lot of nerve. I can not speak for PD here, but respect is not
really the issue here. Animal abuse is. And if you think anybody is going to
respect you (weather you CHOOSE to have have your animals nails amputated and
mutilated or NOT) with your spewing personal attack below, then you are sadly
mistaken.

You do not know what you are talking about.
I did not intentionally go out and look for a cat that was declawed.
I wanted a nice cat...just like lots of people do. I did not want a feral
cat..I wanted one who liked me as much as I like him/her.
Just so happened that my cat was declawed...I thought ...well I am not going
to NOT adopt him for that reason. I thought about what qualities I was
wanting in a cat and one of them was a cat that would not scratch my son.
So I thought...Why not adopt one that was declawed?
I am not going to put him in a home where he is expected to use his claws.
My son is gentle and so am I...I have no dogs...I have no other
cats...Moo-Moo has no need to &quot;hunt&quot;his own food...Both my front door and
back have porches that are screened and glassed in. My cat will have a hard
time trying to escape to the outside world.
He would literally have to escape twice(if he does get out on either of the
porches...he would have another door to have to escape from)...and the
likelyhood of that happening is not good.
I am happy with the decision that I made...and will always be happy.
You who speak before knowing all are the true idiots. If you want to be
smarter you need to ask questions re: the matter at hand before you develop
&quot;diarrhea&quot;of the mouth.

&gt;not having to actually do the dirty deed yourself (i.e. painkiller for

Um, and why the hell not? There are probably plenty of declawed cats that
need home nad if some one really wants a declawed cat, why not get one
already declawed instead of getting a cat and getting it declawed (via the
deed already was done anyways compared to taking a cat that still has a
chance and declawing).
Secondly, somwhere around here I read a post by Apryl I believe that I
fully agree with. While I do not agree at all with declawing because it is
pretty much needless surgery on the cat I do not think it is abuse just
cause some otyher countries want to feel better about themselves and look
down on us cause they have no declaw rules and we don't (good for them but
most posts I see like that are quite snobby and treat the US like we *all*
are horrible people adn their country is so much better). Why do I say it
is not abuse? Well, you keep the cat indoors and it never gets out, what
will it really use its claws for (specially if you have no kids and no
dogs to worry about even. Really you should be teaching your kids not to
harm the cat... some kids aren't going to be deterred by claws anyways,
and I know some dogs aren't deterred by claws, like our puppy who just
decides to chase the cat if it dares scratch him)? yes... you did just
needlessly take away its toes, but I doubt, besides the surgery, the cat
will notice all that much (compared to if it was some one who would have
not adopted the cat and the cat gets put to sleep,t he cat will notice
that). And while my cats are not declawed, my mom had her cats declawed,
and not even at a young age, tehy were a few years old (and yes I did
protest loudly about that one). Well, her cats ended up being fine... they
are totally well balanced (if a little overneedy for attention *grin*).
They do try to sharpen their &quot;claws&quot; or rather paws on the furniture but
to me it seems liek that is cause they don't even notice the claws are
gone (they don't stop, they keep going like my clawed cats would).
Basically I don't think declawing is the ultimate evil that some of you
guys make it out to be. It is needless and stupid and it should be
highly discouraged, but it isn't going to make the cat totally miserable
for the rest of his/her life.
basically, in shorter words, I am against declawing, but I will not say I
would rather have the cat put to sleep than declawed. If it comes down to
that, I would say go for the lesser evil. Declawing won't torture them
fcor the rest of their life, they won't have a rest of their life on the
second option. If the only person left to adopt the cat before it is put
to sleep insists on having it declawed... I figure it is better. Or, even
if I think they should not have had a cat in the first place, a person
wants it declawed or they will put it to sleep (and I've heard of people
putting away pets for much more frivolous reasons so don't say that won't
happen), I would say go for it. I eman they already have the cat, whether
they should have gotten it in the first place or not can't be helped
anymore. And if they can't find some one else to adopt it, it could come
down to that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You know, based on the &quot;rational&quot; arguments of April and other cat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mutilators, I have come to a decision...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I REALLY love my furniture more than my kitty. After all my kitty is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just a toy and decoration for me to play with and alter as I please to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fit my needs. It's really just a status symbol to make my family life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; look complete and healthy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't want anything to hurt my beautiful furniture and carpet, that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would ruin the picture I am trying to paint of the ideal home. So, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comes that I must de-penis my male cat. Afterall, he does spray and pee
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and I just can't have that. It's for his own good. I mean, if he sprays,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I will become upset and hurt his feelings. I don't want him to feel bad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if I yell at him. Carrying him away and training him not to spray would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just be too traumatic. Of course neutering is just unnatural, so that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should be avoided.

&gt;&gt;Penile uresthostomy, or removal of the penis, is done do cats when
&gt;&gt;other treatments for FUS have been tried and the likelihood of very
&gt;&gt;frequent blockage increases. It obviously doesn't prevent the cat from
&gt;&gt;peeing.

&gt;Oh, gee...you think so?

&gt;Apparently so, cause you missed the ENTIRE point...

But that is not what I got from the way you worded your post..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
You wrote: Well, then I got to thinking...I could easily adopt a cat that

"/> was already declawed.

Which implyed to me that getting one that was &quot;already declawed&quot; saved you
the trouble of doing it yourself. Especially when the sentance before it
read: &quot;Wanted a cat that was sweet and mellow and would not mind when my 9
year old picked it up&quot; which implyed that you were worried about what may
happen when your 9 year old handled the cat.. these are always things that
people who declaw their cat think of.. Reasoning it in their own mind,
worried about scratches, furniture etc..

Now I am not saying that is what you meant to say, but that is what I got from
your post, and so did many other people I am sure.

Stop getting so defensive.. people read posts wrong all the time, as the
author, you should try harder to express your feelings better in your typing,
because talking -$hit- to people that misunderstood you does not get your
point across any better..

Now before you start screaming at me, read my post entitled OFF TOPIC
PHRASING.. It happens all the time.. I have on more than one occasion had to
correct what I wrote because with typing we do not have voice, pitch or hand
gestures to help people understand what we are trying to say. I am giving you
the benefit of a doubt (not that you care) that you did not really mean what

&gt; need home nad if some one really wants a declawed cat, why not get one
&gt; already declawed instead of getting a cat and getting it declawed (via the
&gt; deed already was done anyways compared to taking a cat that still has a
&gt; chance and declawing).

I'm sorry I can't recall his name (that reflects badly on me, not him)
but as I recall, the cat lived, and the incident marked the end of
firemen expounding on how a pet's life is not worth the owners -- even
the firemen were touched by that fellow's big heartedness.

&gt;I can't imagine why, it's perfectly clear.

&gt;&gt; Because A) here I have been under the impression that
&gt;&gt; you have spent some of your time following me
&gt;&gt; around, replying to any of my posts that I make which
&gt;&gt; do not agree w/ yours,

&gt;You *are* confused aren't you? What you describe is perfectly normal
&gt;behaviour on NGs. The whole point is to respond directly to what people
&gt;write, and this is what I do - I respond to you about what you write.
&gt;What you are doing is posting about me to other people, not responding
&gt;to me. If I have something to say about you or what you write then I
&gt;have the guts to post it to you, not to other people.

&gt;Now, that's not so confusing is it?

&gt;&gt; telling me that I'm wrong - time &amp; time again,

&gt;Of course, because you *are* wrong time and time again. Can I help
&gt;that?

&gt;&gt; and B) I've noticed that you seldom reply to any posts
&gt;&gt; other than the declawing posts, whereas I have also been
&gt;&gt; replying to posts where I feel I can help the person out with
&gt;&gt; other issues

&gt;Well if this were true, which it isn't, it would hardly be surprising
&gt;given the fact that I spend the major part of my life rescuing cats and
&gt;fighting their abuse. Stopping the ill-treatment of animals is the most
&gt;important thing I do, so why is it strange that I might concentrate on
&gt;that on the newsgroups when it is so much a part of my daily life?

&gt;In view of that it is also hardly surprising, given the huge number of
&gt;threads running across the groups at the moment, that I'm posting a lot
&gt;of posts on the subject right now. Do you suggest that preventing the
&gt;ill-treatment of animals is not an important thing to do?

&gt;I don't know what relevance you think this might have. Each of us has
&gt;every right to decide which threads we respond to and which posts within
&gt;the threads we answer. If I chose to post only to the declawing threads
&gt;- which I don't - that would be my choice and I'm entitled to choose so
&gt;to do. There are a couple of people here who only ever respond to
&gt;threads about urinary tract problems, presumably because this is
&gt;something they are concerned with - are you implying something about
&gt;them too?

&gt;However, the important point is that you make the enormous assumption
&gt;that because I don't always post to the NGs on other subjects, I'm not
&gt;responding. BIG mistake. I do quite often post to the NGs on other
&gt;subjects, but more often I respond via private email. I respond to a
&gt;great many posts in this way because that allows me to send attachments
&gt;which are not welcome on the groups. I have a library of information I
&gt;have collected over the years, and I often find it useful to attach
&gt;articles to my responses. Also, quite often, the amount of information
&gt;I have on a subject is too much and too long to post to a NG, whereas it
&gt;is extremely useful to someone trying to gather information on that
&gt;topic. I've responded to a dozen or so people in the past day or so in
&gt;this way, and I find that people are always extremely grateful for the
&gt;information and advice that I send them.

&gt;Not allowing abuse to be pushed into the background is extremely
&gt;important, which is why so many of us refuse to allow declawing to go
&gt;unchallenged, but it is not always necessary to give other information
&gt;to people publicly. I'm not looking for brownie points and if I can
&gt;help people privately I'm quite happy to do so.

&gt;&gt; I'm not trying to sound my own horn here, but I certainly
&gt;&gt; do feel the need to defend myself against false and/ or
&gt;&gt; unjust accusations.

&gt;Not &quot;false and just&quot; at all - they're perfectly true. You're posting
&gt;personal abuse about me because you obviously don't think you can
&gt;counter my arguments any other way.

&gt;&gt; I posted the above message to Elaine because I had the
&gt;&gt; feeling that she wasn't aware of your opinions and style, and didn't want
&gt;&gt; her to feel too badly about your reply to her.

&gt;Elaine is quite obviously an intelligent woman well able to decide for
&gt;herself about the people she's corresponding with. She made it more
&gt;than clear that she's able to respond for herself and we've had an
&gt;interesting exchange now that she's made her meaning clear.

&gt;Don't try to hide behind Elaine - you saw an opportunity to have a go at
&gt;me on a personal level and you took it.
&gt;PD

"/> I did not 'hide behind' Elaine - I just felt that she'd most likely feel
quite taken aback at your post, if she were not familiar with your style. I
posted this reply just before she later reposted &amp; proved that she could
stand up to you. (I *had* at first considered posting to her privately, but
then figured, what the heck...) As to false &amp; unjust, *I* most certainly do
feel that your accusations were such. And I *have* countered your arguments
many times before with perfectly logical statements (although granted, you
don't seem to see the logic), *without* having a personal go at you.
However, you really set yourself up for it this time, even more than usual.
I'm sorry, but you can not reasonably expect to show such a lack of manners,
tolerancy, and tact in a public forum, especially one as wide-ranging as
this, without being called on it at some point(s). Cathy

I hope you have good luck with your new cat, Elaine. In all probability you
made a good choice, and the kitty is now lucky to have a home. Be
forewarned, though, that a cat's bite is no picnic either. My cat isn't
even declawed, which they say causes them to bite more, yet he bites like
hell when he doesn't get his way.

Which implyed to me that getting one that was &quot;already declawed&quot; saved you
the trouble of doing it yourself. Especially when the sentance before it
read: &quot;Wanted a cat that was sweet and mellow and would not mind when my 9
year old picked it up&quot; which implyed that you were worried about what may
happen when your 9 year old handled the cat.. these are always things that
people who declaw their cat think of.. Reasoning it in their own mind,
worried about scratches, furniture etc..

Now I am not saying that is what you meant to say, but that is what I got
from
your post, and so did many other people I am sure.

Stop getting so defensive.. people read posts wrong all the time, as the
author, you should try harder to express your feelings better in your
typing,
because talking -$hit- to people that misunderstood you does not get your
point across any better..

Now before you start screaming at me, read my post entitled OFF TOPIC
PHRASING.. It happens all the time.. I have on more than one occasion had to
correct what I wrote because with typing we do not have voice, pitch or hand
gestures to help people understand what we are trying to say. I am giving

&gt;&gt;together seemed to indicate that because you wanted your son to be able
&gt;&gt;to pick up the cat you wanted a cat that would be harmless, but then you
&gt;&gt;realised you could get one that was already declawed. The logical
&gt;&gt;interpretation is that you think only a declawed cat would be &quot;safe&quot; for
&gt;&gt;your son to handle. The &quot;already declawed&quot; bit was just your excuse for
&gt;&gt;not having to actually do the dirty deed yourself (i.e. painkiller for
&gt;&gt;your conscience) but that you would have had it done it if you had not

No, they aren't. But my point was for the people wanting the law against
declawing... they ahve to realize not everyone sees declawing the same.
And it is a matter of morals, what you find moral and what you find
immoral. My argument would be similar to those who do not like abortion
but realize it is the choice of the woman who has to make that choice. I
would argue against it when I can, but I am against illegalizing it
because personally I think that even though it is a needless and stupid
thing to do to a cat, in the long run I don't believe the cat will be
miserable for the rest of their life.

: changed since reading this newsgroup? Morals that you do not WANT to change?
: You just did it because we are all FORCING it on you?

: Absolutely rediculious.

You just totally twisted my argument around. Congratulations. That was not
a word of what I was trying to say.

:&gt; Personally I think it is immoral to have more than one kid as this earth
:&gt; is overpopulated with people (I mean we control cat's births), how would
:&gt; you like it if I decided the US should be moral and force that law on you?

: That statement is so rediculious it is not even worth responding to.

That statement is to show you an example of how some people would see you
saying that everyone is not allowed to declaw cats. Sorry, not everyone
sees the exact same way as you. Now, I don't want to force a law enforcing
everyone to have just one kid, but it is the same thing... a moral of mine
being forced on people by law. There is a reason we have democracy (or
rather part democracy), so you don't get crazy ideas like that enforced.

Now, why don't you calm down and try to be objective instead of spouting
out your propoganda without thinking about what you are replying to?
Sheesh. God forbid some one disagree with you.
I wonder if you also think I am pro-declawing, cause then I know you

practically lives up there and today when I called her down, she came head
first.. gripping on to the tree with her claws.. then she stopped in the
middle, and kind of just sat there like a squirl.. It was hysterical.. I kept
saying, Jack, Jack, get down from there.. and she just sat there, turned
herself around and climbed back up :) I am gonna get my video camera and try
to catch her on tape.. She is so funny, she just sits up there and won't let
the squirls down.. and they sit there squacking at her!

Then, I am trying to make dinner, and my male cat, Smoke tried to jump up on
the cutting board (you know the kind that pull out from the counter?) and
while he was in mid jump, (I had not realized he was aiming for the cutting
board)I put a plate full of stuff on it.. He lost his balance, and then
gripped on to the side.

He looked like one of those gymnists on the uneven bars.. just kind of
swinging there, back and fourth about 3 times till he finally let go and fell
to the floor.. :)

Anyone else care to share? :)

If you need to call a psychic hotline to find out if you are in a stable
relationship.. chances are.. *your not*!

"/> You *are* confused aren't you? What you describe is perfectly normal
behaviour on NGs. The whole point is to respond directly to what people
write, and this is what I do - I respond to you about what you write.
What you are doing is posting about me to other people, not responding
to me. If I have something to say about you or what you write then I
have the guts to post it to you, not to other people.

Now, that's not so confusing is it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; telling me that I'm wrong - time &amp; time again,

"/> Of course, because you *are* wrong time and time again. Can I help
that?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and B) I've noticed that you seldom reply to any posts
&gt; other than the declawing posts, whereas I have also been
&gt; replying to posts where I feel I can help the person out with
&gt; other issues

"/> Well if this were true, which it isn't, it would hardly be surprising
given the fact that I spend the major part of my life rescuing cats and
fighting their abuse. Stopping the ill-treatment of animals is the most
important thing I do, so why is it strange that I might concentrate on
that on the newsgroups when it is so much a part of my daily life?

In view of that it is also hardly surprising, given the huge number of
threads running across the groups at the moment, that I'm posting a lot
of posts on the subject right now. Do you suggest that preventing the
ill-treatment of animals is not an important thing to do?

I don't know what relevance you think this might have. Each of us has
every right to decide which threads we respond to and which posts within
the threads we answer. If I chose to post only to the declawing threads
- which I don't - that would be my choice and I'm entitled to choose so
to do. There are a couple of people here who only ever respond to
threads about urinary tract problems, presumably because this is
something they are concerned with - are you implying something about
them too?

However, the important point is that you make the enormous assumption
that because I don't always post to the NGs on other subjects, I'm not
responding. BIG mistake. I do quite often post to the NGs on other
subjects, but more often I respond via private email. I respond to a
great many posts in this way because that allows me to send attachments
which are not welcome on the groups. I have a library of information I
have collected over the years, and I often find it useful to attach
articles to my responses. Also, quite often, the amount of information
I have on a subject is too much and too long to post to a NG, whereas it
is extremely useful to someone trying to gather information on that
topic. I've responded to a dozen or so people in the past day or so in
this way, and I find that people are always extremely grateful for the
information and advice that I send them.

Not allowing abuse to be pushed into the background is extremely
important, which is why so many of us refuse to allow declawing to go
unchallenged, but it is not always necessary to give other information
to people publicly. I'm not looking for brownie points and if I can
help people privately I'm quite happy to do so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm not trying to sound my own horn here, but I certainly
&gt; do feel the need to defend myself against false and/ or
&gt; unjust accusations.

"/> Not &quot;false and just&quot; at all - they're perfectly true. You're posting
personal abuse about me because you obviously don't think you can
counter my arguments any other way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I posted the above message to Elaine because I had the
&gt; feeling that she wasn't aware of your opinions and style, and didn't want
&gt; her to feel too badly about your reply to her.

"/> Elaine is quite obviously an intelligent woman well able to decide for
herself about the people she's corresponding with. She made it more
than clear that she's able to respond for herself and we've had an
interesting exchange now that she's made her meaning clear.

Don't try to hide behind Elaine - you saw an opportunity to have a go at
me on a personal level and you took it.

"/> Not at all. There are many abusive practices around the world which are
legal. In South America the authorities are allowed to torture human
beings. In China it is legal to imprison people for life simply because
of their political beliefs. In South Africa, until very recently, the
abuse of human beings was not only legal, but was actively encouraged by
the law. Just because something is legal does not mean it is right.

enough to run as yours!)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

declawing newsgroup and drowned in the deluge of responses!!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; seems to be the only subject of interest for you anyway.

"/> Preventing animal abuse is certainly my primary interest, and it's sad
that you don't seem to think that's important.

You also seem to be making the same mistake as Cathy in assuming that
the only way to respond to people is on the NGs. It isn't, and I often
choose to respond off-group if I am able to provide people with a lot of
information on the topic they're asking for help with.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I stated before I did not choose to amputate MY cats nails!

"/> And as I stated in response to you, I'm delighted to hear it. But you
should be aware that declawing is not amputating the cat's *nails*, it
is amputating each of its toes, bone and all, at the first joint.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Quit slamming me...

"/> Excuse me? &quot;Slamming&quot; you? Whose posts are you reading?

I have said to you:

&quot;No, I accept fully that you didn't mean it the way it sounded, &quot;

&quot;Okay, now you've made that clear.&quot;

&quot;I'm delighted to hear it.&quot;

&quot;I'm very glad your cat is okay,&quot;

When you said: &quot;Why not adopt a cat that was declawed-&quot;

I replied: &quot;No reason at all.&quot;

When you said: &quot;I'm sorry that I did not explain myself better.&quot;

I replied &quot;No problem, I'm sure we all understand where you're coming
from now.&quot;

When you said: &quot;You have to think about the cat.&quot;

I replied: &quot;You and I, and a select few on these NGs, think you have to
think about the cat.&quot;

I also posted a response about your cat's weight problem which I thought
might help you as I have experienced a similar problem.

Where exactly was I &quot;slamming&quot; you? Understanding what you meant,
accepting that you think about your cat, and trying to help you with a
problem doesn't constitute &quot;slamming&quot; someone this side of The Pond.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The more that you do... the less respect that I have for
&gt; your opinion.

"/> The opinion I have expressed is that you sound sensible, that there was
absolutely no reason not to adopt a declawed cat, that you clearly think
about your cat's welfare, and that I now understand where you're coming
from.

How on earth can you not respect that opinion?

Seems you're someone with whom I can't win either way. I respond to
something you post which misleads a number of other people also as to
your opinion, and you don't like my response. You explain that you
didn't mean what we all thought you meant, and I accept fully what you
say. But you don't like that either?

Well I'm very sorry that I completely understood that you didn't mean to
imply what we all thought. I'm sorry that I expressed pleasure that
your cat hasn't suffered long-lasting effects from being declawed. And
I'm extremely sorry that I tried to help you with your cat's weight
problem. It was most remiss of me to have responded to a post that
wasn't about declawing, to try to help you by sharing my own experience
of the same thing. How could I have been so thoughtless?

And by the same logic that this is why we have a democracy - well what
do you think will happen if many more people are against declawing
than for it? Duh - that could be a new law.

Your logic can be used to support any law or argue against any law.

Frankly, if enough people determine that declawing is abuse and/or
immoral, then laws will be passed.

"/> Cats, by nature, use their claws in more ways than hunting for food
and defending themselves.

Whether you think about it or not, cats themselves expect to use their
claws everyday, regardless of the environment they are in.

They also use their claws to mark their territory in two ways. The
actual scratches and the scent left behind. They can easily be taught
to use a scratching post for this, so furniture is not an issue.This
is instinct. They can be taught to direct this instinct to specific
pieces of furniture (ie. cat tree), but they can't be taught not to
want to do this.

They can also use their claws as tools. Have you never seen a cat pick
up something with their claws? My cats ride around on my shoulders and
they hold on by putting tehir claws into my shirt (and not me). I have
one cat that doesn't bother to hold on, and she is very difficult to
carry in this manner as she will fall off if I don't hold as I turn
corners.

Claws also allow them to climb cat trees. Cats love to be in high
places and you can ease kitty territory problems with multiple cats
simply by providing several spots off the ground for them to hang out.
not only do my cats hang out at the top of the cat trees, but they
play there as well, climbing up, switch levels, etc. They would have a
much harder time without claws.

Hi Meghan..please allow me to politely disagree just a bit with you. I know

of declawing. :)

huge ones set up in our sun-room, and at any given time during the day at
least 2 of them were wrestling with the others and sprinting up, down and
all around the trees.
I always maintain that I do not condone declawing of cats or de-barking of
dogs as a first-line treatment, but if all else fails..I still think it is
better than hauling the poor thing off to a shelter to be destroyed after 48
hours..(we have severe overcrowding in our shelters here and 48 is the max
for an adult cat unless it has some outstanding quality of some sort) or
worse just being tossed out to fend for itself.
IMHO the person choosing declawing is trying their hardest to keep their
cherished pet. The procedure is not cheap here at all...close to 200.00!
If they were lazy, and did not care about their pet, why spend the money?
Toss it out...cheaper that way, and they can always get another kitten for
free in the local weekend paper. That is the way I view it. I worked as a
vlounteer for a bit at our local vets office/no-kill shelter..he takes the
time to work with cat owners to first try to help solve the problem of
scratching without declawing...but if it does not work...he will then
declaw. His post-op guide is very specific, especially regarding the kitty
box, to try to help minimize any healing probs. He is great at the
procedure and very meticulous. Did not see any infections come back for tx.
while i was there.
Again...just my opinion

On one accosaion, she fell off the cat tree and caught herself with
her claws. But not beofre scaring me as she swung past my face, and
much too closely than I would have liked.

On another occasion, we had the attic open to the cats because we
could hear some rats. Anyway, that meant a ladder underneath the open
panel for the cats to go up and down. So Kira must have decided to
jump down to the ladder and changed her mind. I walk around the
corner, and she's just hanging there from the hole, not sure what to
do. I went up the ladder and pulled her down safely, but it sure was

Yes, I would rather the cat got declawed than killed.

But, odds are, anybody who won't take a cat unless declawed will
probably have some other problem and the cat will still end up getting
killed.

I can accept this option only because I know we don't have neough good
homes for all the cats. Unfortunately, this isn't an ideal world.

There are a lot of people with cats, dogs, and other animals that have
no clue as to their care, and I would hate for them to do unnecessary
and harmful things to their pets because people who know better don't
say anything.

Everybody at work knows that I have dogs and cats. They come to me
with questions. I had a lady with a few cats suddenly ask me what to
do when her cat gives birth, then how to take care of kittens, etc. It
took 2 litters before I could convince her to get them spayed. And
several hours on my part finding places that would do them at a low
price since she didn't have a lot of money and now had 5 cats to do.

I've had another person not have a clue how to trim nails. I gave him
an explanation, but he wasn't sold on the idea - very nervous about
hurting the kitten, so I brought him an issue of catwatch that had a
really nice diagram showing the nail and where to clip.

If somebody tells me that they are considering declawing, I will gove
them as many reasons not to as possible as well as alternatives to
their problem. Like how to keep kitty from scratching furniture.

I don't expect to convince everybody, but I will try as many as I can.
While I personally don't care what they think of me, I do try to come
across in a friendly non-condescending manner because I do want to
convince them. I don't want them to be turned off from me and
therefore turned off from the alternatives.

ok I can go with some of that. I was using the urinating just to stress a
point..sorry if i did not explain fully. But also ask yourself this: How
many people want to just up and drop 196.00+the taxes for a de-claw without
first attempting less expensive therapys? Our area is very expensive for
that procedure. After 25 years of showing, breeding, and being owned by
cats, I have tried everything I have come across to train our cats not to
scratch certain objects. The vast majority have learned, or at least
learned not to let me see them do it, thus if nothing else, reducing the
damage done. I just think over-all that although not encouraging the
procedure as a first line of tx. we cannot make the owner who is at his
wits end, feel a failure because he feels that he must de-claw his cat.
Sometimes...it is the only way. But that is just my opinion.

&gt; They can easily be taught
&gt;&gt;&gt;to use a scratching post for this, so furniture is not an issue.This
&gt;&gt;&gt;is instinct. They can be taught to direct this instinct to specific
&gt;&gt;&gt;pieces of furniture (ie. cat tree), but they can't be taught not to
&gt;&gt;&gt;want to do this.

&gt;&gt;They do mark their territory..but some will be quite exhuberant with this,
&gt;&gt;and insist on marking items with their owners scent..in some cases this
can
&gt;&gt;include urinating too.

&gt;What does urinating have to do with the declaw issue? Yes, we had a
&gt;cat that did this for 6 years. We tried valium, female hormones, etc.
&gt;It didn't work. We never found a solution. Nor did we drop him off at
&gt;the shelter. We tried to find a new home, but since we couldn't, we
&gt;kept him. My argument was that cats have an instinct to mark. And one
&gt;way they do this is with their claws. Elaine claimed that at her
&gt;house, ctas are not expected to use their claws, but she didn't
&gt;consider the other uses for claws.

&gt;&gt;I can not agree that this is an easy thing to dissuade...it is
instinctual,
&gt;&gt;and once they have picked an area to mark it is very very hard to get them
&gt;&gt;to move it. This is their territory.

&gt;Please re-read the first statement at the top that is quoted from my
&gt;last post. I stated that the instinct can be directed at certain
&gt;objects like a cat tree instead of your sofa. I also stated that the
&gt;instinct CANNOT be totally removed. You can NOT make a cat NOT want to
&gt;mark or scratch.

&gt;&gt;Again sorry, but our three that were declawed out of the vast multitude
that
&gt;&gt;we have had...never had any problems climbing their cat trees. We have 2
&gt;&gt;huge ones set up in our sun-room, and at any given time during the day at
&gt;&gt;least 2 of them were wrestling with the others and sprinting up, down and
&gt;&gt;all around the trees.

Laugh! That reminds me.. when we had first got our three kittens, I had to
put them on the balcony at night when they got too active. They were too
small to jump off the side yet, but small enough to where the balcony would
be plenty of room for them to chase each other.. I would let them back in -
after morning (nocturnal beasts :P) and then they would crash out for the
rest of the day..

So I am sleeping on the couch in the living room (after I had to throw let
them out on the balcony because they ran a marathon on my face) and all of a
sudden I hear, crunch, crunch crunch crunch crunch.. then I hear all of them
Meowing over and over

I open my eyes, and look out the Sliding glass door, and there they all were!
climbing UP the sliding screen door meowing and trying to get back in! It
was hysterical.. they had made it all the way up to the top and were just
hanging there, all three of them! mEowIng!! and I couln't help it.. I let
them back in and got *NO* sleep for the rest of the night.. as they dogpiled
me, (one on my neck, one on my head, and one on my chest) PURRING LOUDLY and
kneeding me.. :) hehe so cuuuute!

Sailor Moon,

Ok, let me see if I can make sense of this, and yes I was listening, and
read all 4 lines of your post that started this.. Possibly I took you wrong to
begin with.. Sorry, but when I see the word forcing and morals in the same
sentence, my neck hairs stand up..

In any case, you are saying (whether you believe personally in declawing or
not- is not this issue) is that it a matter of personal choice and everybody
may not always agree with you, but that it the way it goes.. And oh well.
You don't like people trying to (I will not use the word force, because that
is too strong of a word and it just does not go with the word morals or
ethics..) push, or pressing their morals on you, and I would agree, that I
would not like it either, but in any case, this is not just a moral and
ethical issue in my eyes because I do not see child abuse as JUST morally or
ethically wrong.. It is WRONG in every way that you look at it, not just
morally or ethically, but WRONG PERIOD.. It is wrong physically, morally,
ethically, emotionally wrong, wrong, wrong,(I can't say that word enough
times) and no matter what you say, I will never find it *just* a moral
issue..

Same with declawing of cats.

Now I am not great with wording, but if this does not make it clear for you I
don't know what will. Sorry if I misunderstood you originally..

Rhonda

I don't understand the logic of comparing declawing to abortion. It is like
comparing apples and mactrucks.

Possibly, you mean that you feel the same way about abortion as you do
declawing? You don't agree with it, try to discourage it, but in the end it
is a matter of choice?

See, I just don't see that.. because I think of animal abuse like child
abuse.. I don't agree with it, by all means discourage, but in the end it is
NOT a matter of choice.. You just don't abuse other souls, whether they are
people or animals. I will never find that right.. or that logic right.

Sexual harassment was not made illegal until 1985 (I think) Which was was one
of the issues during the clarence thomson thing.. because he harassed her in
the 70's or somthing like that, and it was not illegal until the 80's..
Saturday Night live made a few news paradoys about that fact.

&gt; Until the first of January this year prostitution was legal in Sweden.

&gt; Lots of bad and abusive things are still legal. The absence of a law is

In rec.pets.cats.misc Meghan Noecker &lt;fries ... @ccom.net&gt; elaborated:

: If I believe something is wrong, I have to do my part. I can't just
: sit back and let it happen. No, I don't have the right to assault the
: person or threaten or anything like that, but I can argue as much as I
: want and try to convince that person.

Fully agreed. I just would like to see people do it as rationally as you
just argued above.

: This is something I mostly gree with while part of me doens't know
: what to think.

: Yes, I would rather the cat got declawed than killed.

: But, odds are, anybody who won't take a cat unless declawed will
: probably have some other problem and the cat will still end up getting
: killed.

Maybe... but for the ones who need a home and that is the only one, it
gives them a chance at life. But I think the more common problem are those
that already get the cat, find out they can't stand the fact it scratches
their furniture, can't seem to train the cat not to, and can't find a home
for it. So they decide it is etiher declaw or give it back to the shelther
or have it put to sleep (and even the shelter is a probably death sentence
unless it is a no kill shelter. Cats have an even worse rate of being
adopted at the shelters than dogs do, something like 80% get put to sleep
and the pound in my city does not even bother keeping them but sends them
to the humane society since in the pound they only have a week to live and
it is a certain death sentence to stay in the pound. This is also
something I would like to see worked at... as in trying to get people not
to turn their cats into the shelters and get more people to get their new
pets from the shelters).

: I can accept this option only because I know we don't have neough good
: homes for all the cats. Unfortunately, this isn't an ideal world.

*nod* The ideal world everyone would research the animal to the extent
that it almost felt they already have taken care of one they are so full
of information before they decide on the animal and would also take time
to figure out what kind (like sheltie, german shepard for dog, or siamese,
american shorthair for cat) would fit their lifestyle best. ANd be willing
to take the time to find a home for it themself if they find they
absolutely cannot take care of it (and know that that responsibility is on
their shoulders). And realize the downsides (like the possibility of
scratched up furntiture) of the animal.

: There are a lot of people with cats, dogs, and other animals that have
: no clue as to their care, and I would hate for them to do unnecessary
: and harmful things to their pets because people who know better don't
: say anything.

*nod* I do think the vet should at least give them a lengthy talk about
declawing and why it is unnecessary. I totally agree that the vets
offering specials on declawing is not right and personally I think the
best way to deal with this is talk to the vet your objections, and unless
they are the only one around, go elsewhere if they keep the practice up
and *tell* them you won't go to them and why (does no good if they don't
realize you are not using them). It is your money and it does not have to
go to some one who you disagree with their practice. I refuse to even buy
food for my snake at this reptile store cause they keep their animals in
horrid condition (and even a snake deserves better, whether you like them
or not, they are living creatures and don't deserve to be put in a cage
with no water or at best filthy water for example).
On a side note I would discourage people from shopping at Petco as they do
not seem to take care of their animals well either. I have heard of many
horror stories and have seen the condition of their animals myself. I
realize they make themself look good with the adoption thing, but on the
other hand they try to sell reptiles and do ont see to keep people around
who know much about taking care of the animals. I have also heard of one
store that kept their birds right in front of the door during freezing
cold weather and was not even willing to put a light or something to keep
them warm around the cage.

: took 2 litters before I could convince her to get them spayed. And
: several hours on my part finding places that would do them at a low
: price since she didn't have a lot of money and now had 5 cats to do.

*nod* It is always sad to see a pet owner who doesn't take care of their
animals and does not seem to care (not a cat but I have had this problem
with a friend of mine who totally ignores her snake's needs and has told
me when I objected, &quot;oh well&quot;). What do you do when they dont even care to
try to do well?

: I've had another person not have a clue how to trim nails. I gave him
: an explanation, but he wasn't sold on the idea - very nervous about
: hurting the kitten, so I brought him an issue of catwatch that had a
: really nice diagram showing the nail and where to clip.

Yeah, and they do have some neat little catclaw clippers that go around
the nail and supposedly make it easier. My stepmom (my cats are living
with my parents cause where I live at the moment is way too tiny for them
as they are used to having all of the outdoors to play with) just does it
the hard way though (though my cats are pretty good about keeping them
sharp, they have a lot of thigns outdoors they can scratch on, though my
ornery cat sometimes gets them all frayed, I cringe when I see her claws
like that).

: If somebody tells me that they are considering declawing, I will gove
: them as many reasons not to as possible as well as alternatives to
: their problem. Like how to keep kitty from scratching furniture.

: I don't expect to convince everybody, but I will try as many as I can.
: While I personally don't care what they think of me, I do try to come
: across in a friendly non-condescending manner because I do want to
: convince them. I don't want them to be turned off from me and
: therefore turned off from the alternatives.

*nod* Best way to do it. I have only met one person in real life who
wanted (and had) her cats declawed and that was my mom (not stepmom and
father, where my cats are). I did try to convince her not to, especially
since her cats were a few years old and I have heard that makes it worse
on the cat. Unfortunately she decided she was just too sick of them
scratching her furniture up and I was like 13 years old at the time so I
don't think she put much weight into what I said.

Ok... I will really end this post... I tend to talk a lot.. heh.

Actually... kind of different argument. Comparing the argument for pro -

see anything wrong with pro-abortion) to my own argument of anti-declawing
but pro-choice. Though I am more pro-choice cause I would rather see the
cat declawed then put to sleep.

: See, I just don't see that.. because I think of animal abuse like child

I'm sorry, I have to disagree. Declawing is needless and stupid, but I
still see it better than having the cat being put to sleep. I mean it does
take a few weeks for the animal to heal but they have a chance at a happy
life still (and yes, they can have a happy life, my mom's cats themselves
are quite happy, so don't give me this they will be miserable cause you
canot say that. I have seen many declawed cats that are happy and maybe
some do stay miserable, but to say that declawing will definitely abuse
them their whole life is just not correct). I would rather them have that
chance at a happy life than just be put to sleep and given no chance at
life whatsoever.

Fortunatly, their frantic kitten days are over. . . I gave 2 of the kittens
to a good home, and kept one of them.. and she is the one that spends all
night in the trees these days.. only comming into to eat and play with my
other cat.

Once I went to go look for her, in her favorite tree and she was not there..
then I hear meowing from the distance, and much to my suprise, she was in a
tree about 4 trees away, halfway down the block.. it was a much better tree
:) had more branches and stuff to hide on to ambush the squirls..

And the squirrls just stand there, trying to get down, and squaking at her!

One day, I just *know* she is going to come with a squirrl bite in her butt..
it is only a matter of time. :)

Whether you like it or not, there are people out there that would do that,
and so what would you say if you were the vet and they told you that if
you don't declaw the cat they are just going to have it put to sleep?
As I have said, I have heard of worse reasons that people put their
animal to sleep (like the lady who put her dog to sleep so that no one
else would take care of it).

under the bed with something not so claw attractive. Otherwise they
would tear around upside down while we slept, eventually making holes

granny square afghan ( that took me a good two years of work to make),
pawing , digging and pouncing. They love to sleep on the blanket
(nice and warm) , but sometimes I guess the bed mice levels just have
to be taken down by a few!

because our veterinary community has banned it as being unethical and

My kitten will sit up on the table and knock every single item smaller than
himself off of it.
He used to then get down and chase all the items around, but now he doesn't
even bother with that.
Just the knocking off is enough for him now that he is getting big and lazy
:)

The favorite toy of my two young ones (Cooper, who's a year and a half, and
TS who is 10 mos.) are the plastic rings off of milk jugs. They will play
together for long periods of time with those rings. I love watching them -
they take great delight in flipping the rings up iun the air, back and forth
to each other. They seem to love making the ring come &quot;alive&quot; and batting it
across the slippery kitchen floor :)

My cat has not butten me yet...I had 2 persians male and female...the male
was alright no biting...now the female, when I walked by her would grab my
foot , wrap her body around my ankle and flip her back legs and bite bite
bite...She was verrrry playful...with me only.Gentle as a lamb with my
ex-husband and my little boy(back then he was real little).
She would also box you (playfully) when you walked by &quot;her&quot; chair...a
wingback chair- that I still have with her claw picks all over one side of
the back. That was the only peice of furniture that she ever messed
with...so I let her have it...to this day I call it the &quot;Daisy Dookie&quot;
chair.
Neither one of my persains were declawed.
I think that some female cats are alittle more &quot;playful&quot; and mine was surely
a rough biter when it came to playing. My male died about 4 years ago. I
miss them both.

The post was for things that cats do with their claws.
:Claws: being the operative word.

And of course she is allowed to post her own thoughts..
Her thoughts just were not exactly on the same wave as the
thread subject; which is all, I am sure, that ML was trying

Hi! I'm new to the news group, but I have been following this thread and
have to contribute my opinion. I have 2 beautiful female siamese cats,
Eponine and Ramie. They are both 100% indoors cats and are both declawed all
4 feet. They both had the operation done at the same time when they were
spayed, and were around 6 months old when the surgery was done. My point is
that they are both very very happy and normal cats. In fact, they're both
cuddled together on my lap right now. They both pretend to sharpen their
claws on their kitty condo's scratching post all the time. Why did I have
them declawed you might ask. Two main reasons. #1: I am blind and didn't
feel it would be safe for either me or my 2 babies for me to try to keep
their nails trimmed.
#2. I live in an apartment, and landlords are far more accepting of declawed
cats than those that arent. In fact, when I first got Eponine, I was in an
apartment that didn't allow pets, but since I had just had her declawed,
they let me and her stay until I could move. So, I suppose the point to all
this rambling is that I own living proof that declawing isn't a tromatic
experience for all cats. Now, admittedly, doing it to an older cat might be
a different story, but as I said, my girls don't seem to know the difference
between when they had claws and now. Sorry for this post being so long, but
I just felt the need to speak up and defend the declawing procedure.

Indoor Cats have been known to get outside.

And you said yourself, that one apartment wouldn't let you have cats period,
but let them stay there until you moved.. so claws or no claws, you would
have had to move from that apartment.

There are just as many places that allow cats that do not, so IMNSHO you
should actually, lets say, you _COULD_ have searched harder. But judging
from your post, apparently it was not even something you felt you needed to
consider, and you really do not feel that you did anything wrong.

These things make me sad.. especially the part about how people just honestly
do not realize that there is anything wrong with declawing their pet. There
is honestly nothing wrong with amputating their digits, bone and all
associated nerves along with the nail. Just because they can not tell you
that there are things they can do with claws, that they can not do without
claws, and just because they do not speak, and because they seem perfectly
happy.. and &quot;they are just cats&quot;, we can do whatever we want to them.

Every bone in my body tells me there is something wrong with that.

I live in the UK and had no idea that cats were declawed until I read
this article.

This is something that I could never conceive doing to my Tigs. Yes, she
uses our sofas as scratching posts and any attempts to introduce her to
the real mccoy end in her sniffing it and wandering away but having
scratched furniture is part and parcel of a cat. I must say now that I
admire people who have adopted declawed cats from rescue centres - thus
saving them from certain death - but anyone who declaws a cat because
they don't like the 'destruction' shouldn't have a cat in the first
place. Why don't you get a goldfish instead?

&gt;Well actually, though you may not have meant that, the entire

&gt;obvious I wasn't the only person who thought so.

&gt;Read what you wrote again:

&gt;&gt; I was looking for a cat that was kind of mellow and sweet....
&gt;&gt; then I got to thinking...I could easily adopt a cat that was
&gt;&gt; already declawed

&gt;Surely you must see what that says, inadvertently or not?

&gt;&gt; (it did not have to be declawed to be that
&gt;&gt; way)

&gt;I'm delighted to hear it.

&gt;&gt; then I stated that I thought that I would adopt one that was declawed.
&gt;&gt; JUST SO HAPPENS THAT MY CAT IS MELLOW AND SWEET AND DECLAWED.

&gt;Okay, now you've made that clear.

&gt;&gt; Who are you to decide if I should or should not want do adopt a cat that is
&gt;&gt; perfect for me and my child.

&gt;I wasn't making any comment whatsoever as to whether you should adopt a
&gt;&quot;perfect&quot; cat. I was commenting on the fact that you definitely
&gt;appeared to be saying that if you wanted a mellow and sweet cat that
&gt;your kid can carry around it needed to be declawed.

&gt;&gt; If he had claws he would still be a sweet and
&gt;&gt; mellow cat.

&gt;Probably more so judging from what a lot of people say about declawed
&gt;cats.

&gt;&gt; I am sure that you are a wonderful person and I commend you for your
&gt;&gt; opinion...

&gt;Well there's a first! :-))

&gt;&gt; but re-read my post and you will probably think in a different
&gt;&gt; way.

&gt;No, I accept fully that you didn't mean it the way it sounded, but it

I'm sorry you feel that way. I hope you'd also feel good about killing a
cat that had the potential (even clawless) to have a good life (and I have
seen plenty of happy cats without claws so I don't buy the argument that
they will all be miserable their whole life if they don't have their
claws).
Sorry, to me this sounds as radical as that woman who once said she woudl
rather put the cat to sleep than let some one who would let it go outside
take care of it.
I am against declawing, but I am just as against the attitude of if you
don't have my morals for taking care of the cat (even for things that
would still give the cat a chance at a happy life), I would rather kill
the cat. Ok, I will admit some circumstances I would say the cat is better
off dead (like if the person constantly abuses the cat) but unless it will
affect them their whole life and not let them have happiness, I think the
cat is better off living.

My Siamese was watching me through the leaded glass windows (i.e., like
stained glass, but clear) by the front door of our house and he started
tapping on the glass with his paw--I guess he was telling me to hurry
up--and when I came in the door he still had his paw on the glass and was
looking at me really pitifully and when I looked closer I saw that his claws
had gotten stuck on the leading.=) So I helped him get his paw off the glass
and then he yelled at me for being slow and causing the whole mess...

And if you've heard a Siamese...you know what I mean by yelling! I will walk
faster next time! =)

Hi...
Since we're talking about cats and house fires (a dreadful combination!)
I have seen stickers that you can get for the windows in your house that
alert firefighters that there are pets in the house. I don't know how much
attention firefighters are able to pay to them, but it's an idea.

Also it helps if your cats are trained to come when you call them. (Not
easy to do, but it can be done.)

And I would be one of the ones collasping from smoke inhalation after
carrying my cats to safety...*g*

If I had my child's fingers amputated when he was 7 months old and kept him
anesthetized until the pain went away, the swelling was gone and he was pronounced
recovered, I'm sure he'd be a happy child by the time he forgot the pain and
learned how to make up for the loss of those ten digits. He would eventually lose
all memory of those first months that he was discovering what those digits could
do. He would learn to run, play, laugh and cuddle with mommy and daddy like all
other children. He wouldn't know the difference between when he had fingers and
didn't, he would appear as normal and content as any other child. I would have
only abused him once and he wouldn't suffer since he really wouldn't miss what he
doesn't remember.

When I adopt a cat I am responsible for it. I take that responsibility seriously
and I wouldn't cut off it's toes anymore than I would amputate my son's fingers.
Would I prefer amputating my son's fingers over death? Yes! Does that make it
right? No! I don't buy into the death or declaw business, not that it doesn't
exist. I just think it's an excuse for lazy irresponsible people. If we spayed
and neutered, and backyard breeders stopped breeding, there wouldn't be over 15
million cats and dogs put down every year.

&gt; Unfortunately this is the US. If some one cannot get their cat declawed
&gt; they can always at least give it to the shelters with an 80% rate chance
&gt; of being put to sleep anyways. And then there is always some vet willing
&gt; to put the animal to sleep no matter the owner's reason, witness whatever
&gt; vet put that dog to sleep for the woman (or any vet who puts an animal to
&gt; sleep just cause the owner can't deal wiht it anymore).

&gt; More cruel really. Declawers abuse their cats once... tehre are people
&gt; that don't allow the cat to have a happy life throughout the cats life. I
&gt; am sorry, I hate declawing but I don't think declawing is so horrid that
&gt; the cat will suffer its whole life because it has been declawed. I just
&gt; have not seen a cat yet who seemed to always suffer from not having claws
&gt; (They adapt. Just like the cats who adapt when their tails have to be
&gt; amputated for whatever reason. Funny, you hear mostly stories praising the
&gt; cat on how well it adapts, usually in three days or so. And yes a tail is
&gt; a very important thing to a cat, it helps their balance and it also is
&gt; their way of communicating). Cats are creatures that can adapt to things
&gt; and I think you guys give cats way too little credit for their
&gt; adaptability. I think there are many good reason not to declaw, and I have
&gt; not heard maybe but one (health reasons for the cat cause of cat mental
&gt; problems posted to this newsgroup a while ago. The cat would have clawed
&gt; itself to death itf they had not declawed it) for declawing, but the
&gt; argument that the cat will suffer its whole life is total exageration. I
&gt; have yet to see an unhappy declawed cat (even if I feel sorry for it) and
&gt; since I have yet to see one, I have yet to see any argument that says
&gt; death is better than declawing as even near valid and more an
&gt; overemotional response.
&gt; As one other person noted here, I think the best way of dealing with it is
&gt; to give people a calm objective argument about why they should not declaw.
&gt; If they choose to declaw, it is a pity... but hopefully that is the only
&gt; thing they will do to their cat and otherwise give them a happy home (that
&gt; is the most important thing.. that tehy give the cat a lot fo love and do
&gt; not neglect its needs).

Maybe. If so, I apologize to the original poster.
If not... I meant every word (Well I still mean it to anyone who seriously
thinks death would be better than declawing) and I really hope you
rethink that stance. On the other hand, some one could point out to me
since it is all a hypothetical situation it really does not matter, well
then I say I hope you never get put in that situation cause I would feel
really sorry for the cat.

number of them. Although Dillon (my male kitty) has scratched a couple of
times, and still wants to claw at the ottoman for some reason, we've pretty much
taught him that it's a no-no. I've had cats for many years and have never had a
piece of furniture ruined by one. Maybe I've just been lucky (cos I know like
with kids, even if yours don't misbehave, there are plenty that do, despite what
the parents might do), or maybe I've just hit on the right things to do to stop
it. I honestly don't know. Even when I had 5 cats (I lived in the country then)
that went in and out, they didn't destroy stuff. Well, ok, the rug in front of
the door has been wrecked. Dillon was in the house when we were gone overnight.
Poor thing tried to claw his way under the door. I can honestly say that's the
only real damage that has eve been done. But the thought never occured to declaw
him.

her so. My current sheltie was abused, but she handles it much better.
I still hold her during the trimming, but she doesn't struggle or
growl.

On one ocassion, i did see how closely the vet came to the quick. It
didn't actually burst, but it swelled. The procedure seems simple
enough, but the guilt from actually making a mistake is a bit
difficult for me to handle and the odds of making that mistake is
higher since I can't see where the quick is.

In trimming cat nails, I cut my cat once, but not the quick. I was
being careless and clipped his pad. I was so sorry, and the next time
I did nails, he was a bit reluctant. Other than that, I've never had
any problems.

What the flock?????????????????

Did you even finish reading my post before you snipped the bottom line to
what I was saying? Did you just read the word :kill: and assume how the rest
of the post would go??

I *SAID* lets kill it..

And *then* I would take it (and all others that were given the declaw or death
option) and start an animal shelter.. Geeze, I would NEVER kill an animal for
any reason.. if I did not make it clear, I thought the part about the animal
shelter would make it clear..

What is wrong with you anyway?? Maybe that would be a hard thing to do..
start a shelter.. or try to save more animal lives, but you gave me a
hypothetical situation and I gave you a hypothetical answer.. good grief..

Now, how the HELL do you expect me to start a pet shelter with DEAD CATS? You
didn't get that I would NOT be killing the cat??? But keeping it?? use your

Good god. This was supposta be a hypothetical situation.. and that was my
hypothetical answer and I stick to it..

If I was a vet and anyone said &quot;kill or declaw&quot; and if *I* did not declaw it,
they would take it to someone who _would_ or kill it.. and if they THINK I am
killing it, and I don't.. then what do I have boys and girls??

A bunch of L I V E cats and no where for them to go.. so I would start a

: Now what is it that British/Scandinavian/Swiss/Brazilian etc. vets say
: if immoral people demand they either abuse an animal or put it to
: sleep? Ah yes... &quot;No.&quot; On both counts.

Unfortunately this is the US. If some one cannot get their cat declawed
they can always at least give it to the shelters with an 80% rate chance
of being put to sleep anyways. And then there is always some vet willing
to put the animal to sleep no matter the owner's reason, witness whatever
vet put that dog to sleep for the woman (or any vet who puts an animal to
sleep just cause the owner can't deal wiht it anymore).

:&gt; As I have said, I have heard of worse reasons that people put their
:&gt; animal to sleep

: That there are other morons around who are as ignorant, cruel and
: immoral as those who declaw their cats doesn't mean they're worse - just
: that there are a lot of animal abusers in your country.

More cruel really. Declawers abuse their cats once... tehre are people
that don't allow the cat to have a happy life throughout the cats life. I
am sorry, I hate declawing but I don't think declawing is so horrid that
the cat will suffer its whole life because it has been declawed. I just
have not seen a cat yet who seemed to always suffer from not having claws
(They adapt. Just like the cats who adapt when their tails have to be
amputated for whatever reason. Funny, you hear mostly stories praising the
cat on how well it adapts, usually in three days or so. And yes a tail is
a very important thing to a cat, it helps their balance and it also is
their way of communicating). Cats are creatures that can adapt to things
and I think you guys give cats way too little credit for their
adaptability. I think there are many good reason not to declaw, and I have
not heard maybe but one (health reasons for the cat cause of cat mental
problems posted to this newsgroup a while ago. The cat would have clawed
itself to death itf they had not declawed it) for declawing, but the
argument that the cat will suffer its whole life is total exageration. I
have yet to see an unhappy declawed cat (even if I feel sorry for it) and
since I have yet to see one, I have yet to see any argument that says
death is better than declawing as even near valid and more an
overemotional response.
As one other person noted here, I think the best way of dealing with it is
to give people a calm objective argument about why they should not declaw.
If they choose to declaw, it is a pity... but hopefully that is the only
thing they will do to their cat and otherwise give them a happy home (that
is the most important thing.. that tehy give the cat a lot fo love and do
not neglect its needs).

&gt;Well congratulations. I believe you are the first person who has ever
&gt;come here and admitted that they've maimed and amputated their cats on
&gt;all four feet. Even the appalling people who defend this abuse normally
&gt;make it clear they think to declaw the back feet is totally
&gt;unjustifiable.

"/> My wife had our eldest cat (14yr old now) declawed in the front
BEFORE she knew what it meant and how they do it.....we're
both advocates for PETA....and declawing is **NOT** ethical
treatment of animals.

It's cruel, unjust and INSANE

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What in God's name did you think you were doing?

"/> Right on PD!
To declaw a cat's front paws is bad enough, but ALL 4???
That's a claw MASSACRE

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Why did I have them declawed you might ask.

&gt;No need to ask, the answer is perfectly obvious.

&gt;&gt; I am blind

&gt;I'm very sorry you are blind, but that is no excuse for what you have
&gt;done. Millions of blind people around the world live successfully with
&gt;fully-clawed cats. How do you think they manage?

"/> Horray!!! It's time people with disabilities:

i) Accept the fact that it's not a badge to wear when they're
losing an arguement

and

ii) Realize it doesn't mean that people should make allowances
for them being an asshole just because of it.

(and before anyone flames me, I *DO* have disabled friends - and an
asshole is an asshole - able bodies or physically challanged)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; and didn't feel it would be safe for either
&gt;&gt; me or my 2 babies for me to try to keep
&gt;&gt; their nails trimmed.

&gt;Do you have no friends?

"/> Sad if she doesn't. Even declawers need friends.........

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; #2. I live in an apartment, and landlords are
&gt;&gt; far more accepting of declawed cats than those
&gt;&gt; that arent.

&gt;And there are landlords who allow clawed cats too, as plenty of people
&gt;here have testified.

"/> Damn straight!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I own living proof that declawing isn't a tromatic
&gt;&gt; experience for all cats.

&gt;This is nothing to do with trauma, this is to do with morality. You
&gt;have deliberately abused two beautiful living creatures, and you have
&gt;done it on all four feet, which is horrifying.

"/> need I say more??? I don't think so, you pretty much have it
covered PD :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And before all the pro-declawers jump on me for saying this when you are
&gt;blind, I emphasise again that I am extremely sorry that you have to cope
&gt;with this in your life. But being blind, or being in any other way
&gt;disabled, is no excuse for abusing animals. Blind people don't do it in
&gt;all the countries around the world that ban declawing, so you cannot
&gt;claim that your blindness is relevant in any way at all.

&gt;&gt; I just felt the need to speak up and defend the declawing procedure.

&gt;Then you defend animal abuse. Is there no end to the number of
&gt;despicable people prepared to mutilate and abuse living creatures who
&gt;can't defend themselves?

that old malt-o-meal commercial. So the name was changed.

Both of my current kitties started with one name and got another after
a few months. Kira used to be Shirman because she was built like a

I hate the idea of declawing - but I can't condone PD's illogical and
rude response to Elaine. Are you suggesting that no one should ever
adopt a previously declawed cat? Should they be left to moulder, or be
put to sleep in rescue centres? Elaine did not increase the demand for
declawed cats, she simply adopted one. Those of us who are totally
against declawing do ourselves and our cause no favours by appearing to
be blind to reason. I don't compromise as far as animal abuse goes
either, but I know that my anger should be directed against those who
perpetrate these outrages, not against those who are involved with the
consequent fallout.

your reaction to Elaine higher up this thread, before I'd read the rest

resources for the blind that let you have someone come over for
a couple of hours a week to help you out with things you can't

could have made arrangements with a local professional pet-sitter
to come by and trim her cats' nails every two weeks. Most don't
normally do this, but I bet if she explained her situtation, one
would have been happy to do it for a very small fee. Or, she
could have had a house-calls pet groomer come by. Or, she could
have just paid some neighborhood kid a couple of bucks to do it.

I hate to say it, but Melissa's attitude seems pretty typical of
most declawers: Amputate first and ask questions later.

Actually, what I meant, which obviously I did not make clear as mostly
everyone misunderstood me was this: Anybody who would say to DECLAW or KILL
is a monster. I don't even consider people who just declaw monsters as much
as I consider someone who would make it a life or death option if they did
not get it declawed - a monster.. That is like playing god. Don't want to
do it my way, so you die..

I don't think these people should own cats. And I would GLADLY take off their
hands the pets that have been given this choice as the only way I see to get a
pet away from someone is to make them believe I was killing it.. and then keep
it for myself. :)

The part about the shelter, was because if I did this to everybody who gave a
pet that option, I would have ALOT of pets :) so what better than to start a
no kill shelter.

I would *never* kill an animal. For ANY reason.

But what you said about shocking the owner, is a good idea too.. only problem
with that was, more than likely, he would say, &quot;no don't kill it.. &quot; and then
find some other vet that would perform the declaw operation. I would rather
find a way to keep the animal for myself, then have it in the hands of a
monster. And anyway I could find to keep it, I would do. Even if I had to lie
to him and say that I was going to kill it..

Which would probably get my vet license revoked, if such a thing could
happen..

Sailor moon,

Why on earth would I put in a comment about a pet shelter after I said to
kill the animal? Did that not ring off any bells? LIke possibly I was NOT
going to kill it but keep it for myself?

Thanks for apologizing, but I would appreciate that you would read the entire
post, and then if you don't get it- post back and ask questions before you
make a judgement on me. A judgement in which, if you ever read anything
posted by me (in its entirity- not just reading what you want to read or

It was a good instinct, a strategically placed and appropriate diversion in
the thread.
If someone happened to be reading the thread because they were wondering
whether or not to declaw (don't worry, I know better!) I don't know if these
anecdotes of destruction would sway them... Owning a cat means that without
good cat equipment and training, these things will happen often (and
sometimes they can happen anyway, but not nearly as much!). No, I'm not
implying that these people don't take proper care, not at all; it just
happened that some used bad examples, that's all. (And some just plain
didn't get it.)
I hang a cat toy down from the top of her scratching post, and we are very
entertained by her climbing up the side and then jumping off to try &amp; catch
it. It's funny to watch her attack, all vertically posed and spread-eagled
like a flying squirrel, hanging in the middle of the post, and then leaping
backward. I mean, imagine watching a declawed cat pitifully try to do this
natural kind of stunt and fail miserably, then watch him/her walk away
unhappy and forever discouraged. How sad a sight it would be.

Have you ever seen a cat run horizontally on a 90° angle? My favorite one
used to sneak-attack the dog (a big lab/setter) by running across the back
of the couch (without damage to it, even!) then jump on the dog from behind
as he was facing the door asking to go outside. I never saw anything so
hysterical. He didn't hurt the dog in the least, but what a look of total
shock and surprise! Priceless.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Indrio

&gt;&gt; I could not help but lol when I read that.. I can just imagine how funny that
&gt;&gt; would be..

&gt;&gt; Smoke did something funny yesterday, I had made meatballs for my son, (who
&gt;&gt; loves my meatballs :) and he was done eating at the table, but not quite done
&gt;&gt; eating yet. So he takes his meatballs and starts stacking them up on the
&gt;&gt; coffee table..

&gt;&gt; Then he starts cracking up, and I look over to see what he was laughing at,
&gt;&gt; and here comes this paw.. from behind the coffee table, with his claws out,
&gt;&gt; trying to steal the meatball by HOOKING it with only one of his claws,
&gt;&gt; without jumping on the table or even showing his head above the coffee
&gt;&gt; table.. (smoke usually gets sprayed (with water) at for jumping on the
&gt;&gt; coffee table or trying to eat the babys food) But it was so hysterical..

&gt;&gt; All I saw was a paw and a claw trying to scoop at the meatball blindly.. it
&gt;&gt; was great!

&gt;&gt; Rhonda

&gt;&gt;&gt;Rhonda,

&gt; I can relate to hooking food. I don't know about you but I have glass topped
&gt; furniture. So they look at everything underneath and try to snatch it. Morton
&gt; is such a vulture. Still is 10 years old and 30 lbs of what used to be 'swagger'
&gt; is now 'waddle'. My husband refers to him as MR Snackwell, Snortamer, Lard Ass.
&gt; All of which he will absolutely NOT respond to. When he is in trouble all I have
&gt; to do is ask him&quot; Mort what are you doing?&quot; Calling him Morton he realizes that
&gt; all is temporarily OK.

&gt; Indrio

"/> When I make my husband breakfast, he sits at the counter. And sometimes
Pepper sits in his lap. One morning, he was talking to me, I was
standing on the other side of the counter, drinking coffee. And trying
to watch Pepper, so that he didn't notice. She popped her little head
up, surveyed his plate, and put her head back under the counter. Then
I see this little tortie paw slowly come up, claws extend and she
reached for a piece of bacon, snagged it and pulled it toward herself.
Hubby missed this entire incident because he was so intent on what he
was telling me. It was really hard not to say something.

&gt;&gt;I really LOL about Mayard. Maybe it is the genetic thing that starts with all
&gt;&gt;cats who has &quot;M&quot; as their first letter in their name. Except for of course The
&gt;&gt;&quot;Hook&quot; kitty Smoke.

&gt;&gt;Indrio

&gt;&gt;AKC all breed pedigree service
&gt;&gt;see us at  http://indrio.com

&gt; Actually his name was Puddin' because he had a small white patch on
&gt; the front of his neck like he had spilled some pudding. But it was
&gt; obvious by 6-8 months that he loves human food, peas and mushrroms
&gt; being his absolute favorites. margarine, canteloupe, corn, mac&amp;cheese,
&gt; etc are big favorites. My dad kept saying &quot;Good stuff, Maynard&quot; from
&gt; that old malt-o-meal commercial. So the name was changed.

&gt; Both of my current kitties started with one name and got another after
&gt; a few months. Kira used to be Shirman because she was built like a
&gt; tank and bold enough to be one. After that, I looked for a Star Trek
&gt; name and Kira was a major and a former terrorist as well as being
&gt; pretty, intelligent, and a cool name.

out, there's no reason to have her spayed. I tell you what, I surely
don't think Ciara is very comfortable. Not at all.

She is our 19th cat. We only have one purebred, a Maine Coon, Maggie
Xuxa. And we've NEVER had any kittens. Besides Mags, the rest are
rescues. I think Ciara may be a Ragdoll.

&gt; I surely don't know how breeders do it. And I really can't understand
&gt; how people who aren't breeders say that since their kitty never gets
&gt; out, there's no reason to have her spayed. I tell you what, I surely
&gt; don't think Ciara is very comfortable. Not at all.

&gt; She is our 19th cat. We only have one purebred, a Maine Coon, Maggie
&gt; Xuxa. And we've NEVER had any kittens. Besides Mags, the rest are
&gt; rescues. I think Ciara may be a Ragdoll.

It's pretty simple really, declawing is not something which occurs to people
out of the blue. Most people are shocked to discover that people will
deliberately surgically alter their animals for no good reason. It's no
surprise really that Rob used similar wording as there are really a limited
number of ways of saying exactly the same thing.

I'll put it a different way if it makes you happy: There are millions of
people around the world for whom declawing is not an option. For these
people, declawing is not necessary. There are further millions of people
around the world for whom declawing is an option but who choose not to. For
these people, declawing is not necessary. For you, however, it appears that
declawing is necessary. Why?

remarkable technology that lets him talk to the computer (admittedly stilted

&gt;&gt;&gt; to ask him if he was trying to do chin ups or whatever. Anyway, after three
&gt;&gt;&gt; or four of the 'kitty chin ups' he'd drop himself to the floor and stroll

&gt;&gt;&gt; I could not help but lol when I read that.. I can just imagine how funny that
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be..

&gt;&gt;&gt; Smoke did something funny yesterday, I had made meatballs for my son, (who
&gt;&gt;&gt; loves my meatballs :) and he was done eating at the table, but not quite done
&gt;&gt;&gt; eating yet. So he takes his meatballs and starts stacking them up on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; coffee table..

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then he starts cracking up, and I look over to see what he was laughing at,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and here comes this paw.. from behind the coffee table, with his claws out,
&gt;&gt;&gt; trying to steal the meatball by HOOKING it with only one of his claws,
&gt;&gt;&gt; without jumping on the table or even showing his head above the coffee
&gt;&gt;&gt; table.. (smoke usually gets sprayed (with water) at for jumping on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; coffee table or trying to eat the babys food) But it was so hysterical..

&gt;&gt;&gt; All I saw was a paw and a claw trying to scoop at the meatball blindly.. it
&gt;&gt;&gt; was great!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Rhonda

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rhonda,

&gt;&gt; I can relate to hooking food. I don't know about you but I have glass topped
&gt;&gt; furniture. So they look at everything underneath and try to snatch it. Morton
&gt;&gt; is such a vulture. Still is 10 years old and 30 lbs of what used to be 'swagger'
&gt;&gt; is now 'waddle'. My husband refers to him as MR Snackwell, Snortamer, Lard Ass.
&gt;&gt; All of which he will absolutely NOT respond to. When he is in trouble all I have
&gt;&gt; to do is ask him&quot; Mort what are you doing?&quot; Calling him Morton he realizes that
&gt;&gt; all is temporarily OK.

&gt;&gt; Indrio

&gt; When I make my husband breakfast, he sits at the counter. And sometimes
&gt; Pepper sits in his lap. One morning, he was talking to me, I was
&gt; standing on the other side of the counter, drinking coffee. And trying
&gt; to watch Pepper, so that he didn't notice. She popped her little head
&gt; up, surveyed his plate, and put her head back under the counter. Then
&gt; I see this little tortie paw slowly come up, claws extend and she
&gt; reached for a piece of bacon, snagged it and pulled it toward herself.
&gt; Hubby missed this entire incident because he was so intent on what he
&gt; was telling me. It was really hard not to say something.

one is the right one of course. She is white pawed, so we know its her and not Morton
up to no good. Reason why?? She always starts with the black foot first and then
switches. Why?? Don't know. Yet she always drinks water out of the white foot and
never the black one. But then she's not altogther either.

&gt;&gt; Actually his name was Puddin' because he had a small white patch on
&gt;&gt; the front of his neck like he had spilled some pudding. But it was
&gt;&gt; obvious by 6-8 months that he loves human food, peas and mushrroms
&gt;&gt; being his absolute favorites. margarine, canteloupe, corn, mac&amp;cheese,
&gt;&gt; etc are big favorites. My dad kept saying &quot;Good stuff, Maynard&quot; from
&gt;&gt; that old malt-o-meal commercial. So the name was changed.

&gt;&gt; Both of my current kitties started with one name and got another after
&gt;&gt; a few months. Kira used to be Shirman because she was built like a
&gt;&gt; tank and bold enough to be one. After that, I looked for a Star Trek
&gt;&gt; name and Kira was a major and a former terrorist as well as being
&gt;&gt; pretty, intelligent, and a cool name.

&gt;I surely don't know how breeders do it. And I really can't understand
&gt;how people who aren't breeders say that since their kitty never gets
&gt;out, there's no reason to have her spayed. I tell you what, I surely
&gt;don't think Ciara is very comfortable. Not at all.

"/> When I got my last cat, Kira, it was with the understanding that my
mom would breed her. At the time, I was still believing what I had
grown up with - two kinds of breeders: mills and backyard breeders. My
mom's definition of mill included all cateries and what I would now
consider reputable breeders. Just after getting kira, I started
newsgroups and learned a lot about breeders and that there are 3
kinds, mills, backyard breeders, and reputable breeders.

I also realized that if my cat had kittens, I might be faced with a
horrible dilema. My older cat, maynard, is terrified of kittens. When
he sees kittens, he squeals and runs away (kinda what rodents do).
Well, that started a horrible cycle where my mom's cat would chase and
attack my cat on sight. Aftter 8 months of this, my cat would hide
even while in my room with the door shut. By this time, I was sure
that if my cat had kittens, she would also go from the sweet kitty her
mother was into this horrible attack cat that her mother became. (The
father was kinda wacko as well).

Since I couldn't argue my case on health (my mom wouldn't listen),
and I couldn't argue on the ethics of backyard breeders (even though I
listed all the things reputable breeders do that my mom didn't); i
argued the case that I would not be able to handle it if Kira became
like her mother. How could I keep them together, and how could I give
one up?

Fortunately, Kira didn't go into season until she was over a year, so
i only had two rounds of earplugs before my mom agreed to my argument.
(As much as I was certain not to breed my cat, I really didn't want to
spay her behind my mom's back). My arguments must have worked, because
she had her cat spayed at the same time.

It took about 8 more months to get to the point where maynard could
walk safely through the house, but they now tolerate each other's
prescence, and occasionally maynard growls to remind the attack cat to
leave him alone. It was a long process, but well worth it. If you
ever have two cats in a cycle of run on sight / attack on sight - I
can tell you how it's done :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Meghan,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I really LOL about Mayard. Maybe it is the genetic thing that starts
&gt; with all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cats who has &quot;M&quot; as their first letter in their name. Except for of
&gt; course The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Hook&quot; kitty Smoke.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually his name was Puddin' because he had a small white patch on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the front of his neck like he had spilled some pudding. But it was
&gt;&gt;&gt; obvious by 6-8 months that he loves human food, peas and mushrroms
&gt;&gt;&gt; being his absolute favorites. margarine, canteloupe, corn, mac&amp;cheese,
&gt;&gt;&gt; etc are big favorites. My dad kept saying &quot;Good stuff, Maynard&quot; from
&gt;&gt;&gt; that old malt-o-meal commercial. So the name was changed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Both of my current kitties started with one name and got another after
&gt;&gt;&gt; a few months. Kira used to be Shirman because she was built like a
&gt;&gt;&gt; tank and bold enough to be one. After that, I looked for a Star Trek
&gt;&gt;&gt; name and Kira was a major and a former terrorist as well as being
&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty, intelligent, and a cool name.

&gt;&gt;We just rescued another kitten (#19) last Saturday and we named her
&gt;&gt;Ciara. Gaelic. Pronounced Keera. She's sweet. And she's in heat. And
&gt;&gt;I'm miserable, I need some sleep. She also has a very bad URI. *sigh*

&gt;&gt;lisaviolet

&gt; Glad to hear that you've extended you home to yet another needy one. Sorry
&gt; to hear that she's in heat...I'm sure you know to get her spayed ASAP :).
&gt; Also, do you mean UTI? If so, is she on antibiotics? Hope she gets better
&gt; soon.

&gt; J.Coyer CVT

"/> Nope, I meant URI. Upper Respiratory Infection. Thought you, of all
people, would know that acronym. *grins*

So, you can see why I can't have her spayed yet. Vet won't do it until
she's better. And she's on Clavamox liquid (something that makes no
sense is the markings on the dropper are white and so is the liquid,
hard to see for an old lady like me) and the doc gave me some drops for
her nose. Within a half hour of bringing her home, I had her at the
vet. Luckily, they were still open when I called (they were open for
five more minutes). She tested negative for leuk, the vet put her age
at four months, and she had barely any air coming through her nostrils.
And she had raging earmites, fleas and tapeworms. All taken care of. I
buy the large dog sized Advantage and I still had a tube, so I called
the vet and got the dosage for a kitten, I buy Droncit by the bottle
(expensive, but less than buying by the pill).

Vet tech told me yesterday &quot;enjoy the noise and call us next week&quot;. I
hung up thinking Bitch. (we always tease each other, I really like my
vet's office and all of the people that work there.)

I thought she was just lonely. Duh. She is. But not for anything in
*this* house.

LOL!!

"/> Hi,

You probably already know this but you can buy needleless syringes at your local
pharmacy that have the cc's (mls) markings in black. There is also a special
little magnifier designed for diabetics to attach to the syringe if anyone out
there has a need for one.

Good luck with your new cat.

:( awee... you had to bring that up..

Its ok.. It is not your fault..

Ok.. I take it back.. I just helped my mom decide that putting my cancer
stricken dog to sleep on Jan 7th was the best thing. He was really sick and
could no longer eat without throwing up, and couldn't get up to get in the
car to go to the vet and was turning down his favorite foods and we knew it
was time. She wanted to wait because she did not want to be what she called
:his executioner: but his quality of life was awful.. and I convinced her it
was the best thing.

She took him for a walk, one last time.. and his doggy girlfriend came down
the hill (sniff.. sniff.. :() and the walked around the woods together for
the last time.. (although his leg was so swollen, that he was more like
limping) and then she took him to the vet.. she called me and told me the
news and I was so sad and so relieved all at the same time..

This should answer your question :(

"/> I wouldn't even consider declawing as a last ditch effort. It just
isn't an option in my mind.

Yes, we did have one couch getting clawed for awhile. Solution: we put
a cover on it until the cat was trustworthy. Had she never outgrown
it, we would havekept using the cover. Cost: less than $10. Take off
cover and put cat away for company.

Now, we have also had some very serious problems with urination. At
one time, we had a dog that would pee for attention, but it was my
grandmother's dog. She refused to train him. Peeing did not stop until
she died. After that, he stopped instantly. We also had a cat that
sprayed. We went through several different drugs including valium and
female hormones. Nothing worked. We put plastic over the furniture
where he liked to spray and we placed ads looking for a home where he
would be the only cat. Never did find a home, so we kept him.

When we adopt an animal, we are responsible for the rest of their
life. We do not just throw them away, nor do we injure or kill them
because of their behavior. Especially since these behaviors are all
normal instinct for a cat. Yes, we are normally lucky enough to
transfer these behaviors into something we can easily handle, but
these are cats we are talking about. We have to remember that cats do
cat behavior and that we signed up for this when we got them.

If you don't want cat behavior, don't get a cat. Go get a fish or
something.

I wouldn't suggest that you don't love your cat because you had it declawed. I
might suggest that you didn't try hard enough or were a bit impatient though and
took the easy way out, but then I don't know how old your cat was at the time or
what alternatives you tried. On the other hand, if I understand your message
correctly, you've had three of your cats declawed. I find that a bit curious.

&gt; I wouldn't even consider declawing as a last ditch effort. It just

&gt; Yes, we did have one couch getting clawed for awhile. Solution: we put

&gt; it, we would havekept using the cover. Cost: less than $10. Take off
&gt; cover and put cat away for company.

&gt; Now, we have also had some very serious problems with urination. At
&gt; one time, we had a dog that would pee for attention, but it was my
&gt; grandmother's dog. She refused to train him. Peeing did not stop until
&gt; she died. After that, he stopped instantly. We also had a cat that
&gt; sprayed. We went through several different drugs including valium and
&gt; female hormones. Nothing worked. We put plastic over the furniture
&gt; where he liked to spray and we placed ads looking for a home where he
&gt; would be the only cat. Never did find a home, so we kept him.

&gt; When we adopt an animal, we are responsible for the rest of their
&gt; life. We do not just throw them away, nor do we injure or kill them
&gt; because of their behavior. Especially since these behaviors are all
&gt; normal instinct for a cat. Yes, we are normally lucky enough to
&gt; transfer these behaviors into something we can easily handle, but
&gt; these are cats we are talking about. We have to remember that cats do
&gt; cat behavior and that we signed up for this when we got them.

&gt; If you don't want cat behavior, don't get a cat. Go get a fish or
&gt; something.

&gt;&gt; on the phone this morning, when I asked about the availability of
&gt;&gt; something to put her in the twilight zone until the URI passes (I was
&gt;&gt; just kidding, mind you), &quot;enjoy the noise and call us next week&quot;. I

&gt;&gt; out, there's no reason to have her spayed. I tell you what, I surely
&gt;&gt; don't think Ciara is very comfortable. Not at all.

&gt;&gt; She is our 19th cat. We only have one purebred, a Maine Coon, Maggie

Glad to know that you show excellent taste in also having a Maine Coon. Ours is called La
Princessa (because of the old joke, how many princesses does it take to change a light bulb.
Answer is 2. One to open the Diet Coke the other to call Daddy.) She calls Daddy on a
survey we did. Lately because of all the coat she grows (she is a silver patched tabby) and
carries we lovingly call her Burlington (as in Coat Factory). Hope that #19 does well.

pro-declawers becomes pedantic, declawing isn't actually illegal in the
UK in the sense that there is no legislation on the statute books
preventing it.

The reason for this is that there is no need for legislation because our
vets have unilaterally banned it. And they have banned it not because
we Brits are continually asking for it, but so that if anybody ever does
ask for it the vet can refuse with the full support and force of the
entire veterinary community behind him/her. Being able to say &quot;I am not
allowed to declaw by order of the BVA and RCVS&quot; kind of settles any
argument an immoral client might make.

The fact that the vets refuse to do it because it is unethical, rather
than because they're prohibited from doing it by law, is a much more
powerful statement.

Yeah, but if I was on brittish lands, I could at least see Red Dwarf! it does
not come on TV out here in California although they do show it in other
states.

Now I have to wait till they are done taping the episodes and put it on VHS
and then go buy it!

You cat lovers otta like Red Dwarf.. it is a great brittish comedy about this
guy that is on a ship in space, and rather then turn over his pet cat
Frankinstein (who is pregnant and he plans on building a life for it and him
in Fiji and raise sheeps and cows and breed horses) to the captian to be
dissected because it was an &quot;un quarentined&quot; animal that was taken on the
ship illegally, he goes into stasis for 18 months.. Only to come out and
find that everybody on board has died of a radiation leak, and it is 3
billion years later.

The only things living is him, the ship board computer, and a hologram of his
dead shipmate *AND* something that evolved over the three billion years from
his cat which was safely tucked in the hold when the radiation leak happened..
very funny show :)

People who declaw are not &quot;rectal orifices.&quot; I got a cat recently after 25
years without pets. My family didn't even treat our cats and dogs back then
the way we do now. In retrospect, it's a wonder they weren't all neurotic.
I was just plain unaware of cat psychology and their needs. When I got this
new indoor cat, my vet and my neighbors urged me to get it declawed. The
only reason I had *not* to was that the wonderful woman who placed this
feral cat with me gave me Desmond Morris' 20 year old book on cats. In it,
he strongly advised not to declaw. I think a lot of well-intentioned people
like me simply don't have good information. And I haven't met a vet yet who
stated opposition to declawing when he had a paying customer in his face.
Have you ever thought about their overhead? I can't find a holistic vet in
Indianapolis who's not pill happy, but that's another discussion.

Get this, my vet tried to combine declawing with the spay by saying that he
wasn't cutting off the whole digit to the knuckle, just removing the nail
bed. He showed me on my own hand how I would still have fingertips and
normal finger length. But I just couldn't say yes to declawing because it
sounded painful, and I thought of Desmond Morris' argument against it, and I
thought of the cat's future... What if I was in a car accident and no one
else would be as committed to her care and keep her protected? What if she
got away -- how could she climb out of harm's way or swipe out at an
offending nose without claws? I loved this cat already and I would go nuts
worrying if I didn't know her status.

Besides the fact that I'm cheap, I didn't feel convinced that declawing was
necessary like shots and spaying. But these treatments get rolled into one
group and presented that way to the uninformed pet owner. I was lucky to
read Morris' book, because by the time I started reading these postings, it
would have been too late. I would have felt terrible about declawing my
cat, but it would have been too late. And my personal hunch is that my cat
would have been damaged emotionally. I don't want to pass judgement on
anyone else.

Most people who care enough to invest time learning about their animals and
asking questions on these newsgroups are *good* people. Those New Yorkers
who rent dogs to go with their clothes, or the drug dealers who buy lion
cubs to &quot;guard&quot; the crack house aren't likely to even suspect the animal has
needs beyond food and shelter, let alone sit down to learn anything here.

That's why I have been sorely disappointed by the hateful attacks on others
over this declawing issue. What that does is make it unsafe to ask
questions or explain positions. And that has a negative effect on the
impact of the anti-declawers. How many times have I read that someone is
blocking &quot;claw&quot; and &quot;declaw&quot; and accusing others of sneaky tactics by the
discussion on &quot;cute things cats do with their claws.&quot; Those of you who are
rudely passionate against declawing alienate cat owners instead of teaching
them. A kinder approach would certainly save a lot more cats from
declawing. I am pleading for more empathy and less judgement. Try to
understand what the other person was thinking and help them see how they
might be able to do it differently next time. You know, if a cat was as
aggressive as some of you, this very same newsgroup would be advising the
cat be neutered or spayed to mellow it out a bit. What would an animal
behaviorist say -- you were abused? Human beings have to manage anger.
Care about the cat owners. I commend you for caring so much about cats.
I'm a renewed convert to how important it is to share life with animals.

You know, I find the persons responses to the individual that &quot;had&quot; to
declaw their cat and example of what is wrong with our society today.
This person that declawed their cat first of all is writing voluntarily, in
a cat lovers forum to share an experience.

This person obviously cares about their cats. However, due to some
inability on the cats parts or the owners lifestyle (no criticism meant
here, most of us don't have 24 hours a day to devote to our pets) the cat
was felt to be destructive.

I agree, in many ways declawing is barbaric. However, putting cats in a
shelter due to their destructive tendencies is even more so. Many people
resort to that than I care to think. Or the tried and true, drop it off in
farm country, it will take care of itself method. Is this better?
This declawer is no barbarian. They are a person that is integrating a pet
into a home. Believe me, by six months old you have an idea if your pet is
a destructive type or not.

This person that attacked another in this diatribe, should work more on
their relationship with people, because they don't do their cats any favor
if they are unable to communicate with the rest of the population on how to
care for their cats.

It may be my bias but this person who attacked may have more time in their
life than this other person to dedicate to their cats. Not all of us do.
If only the people that could dedicate all the time in the world to their
pets had them, there would be many more in the shelters and that would only
do a disservice to the pets. Maybe we should work on the veterinarians on
developing a better method of minimizing the effect of a cats claws.

Think about it. The people that abuse their pets don't take the time and
money to have their pets declawed they just toss that one out and get
another... It may not be the way to care for a pet in your definition, but
it is better than many get.

&gt;&gt; was the hardest thing we were faced with doing.

&gt;Not hard enough, obviously, or you wouldn't have done it.

&gt;&gt; I do not think that the vast majority of owners would
&gt;&gt; use de-claw as a first line of clawing cure.

&gt;Well that where you're wrong, because the majority of people declaw
&gt;their cats pre-emptively as kittens, before the poor creatures have had

&gt;&gt; Personally I am a cheapskate...had anything else worked...

&gt;There are many, many other things that will work if you actually put any

I can tell you that the office of Dr.. Kahler in Modesto, Ca. will tell you
that the procedure is extremely painful to the cat before he does the
procedure. If the cat is not a baby kitty he will even make a determination
of whether the cat will be okay after the procedure. Even though I hate the
idea, after my cat destroyed my brand new Queen Size Bed by scratching, and
ignoring the scratching post all the while, I asked him if he thought it
might be better for Sherlock to declaw him. He looked at me and asked me if
I really thought my baby boy, 2 and 1/2 years old, would deal with the pain
and loss of his claws. I knew he would have done it if I pressed him, but I
also knew he was so against it, I just said something like your right, no
thanks. Dr.. Kahler is the most compassionate Vet I have ever met. he has
more compassion than my own doctor has for me. feel lucky to have such a
cool vet.

&gt;&gt; Those of you who are rudely passionate against declawing
&gt;&gt; alienate cat owners instead of teaching them.
&gt;&gt; A kinder approach would certainly save a lot more cats from
&gt;&gt; declawing.

&gt;There are people here who post &quot;kindly&quot; and people who post in a &quot;rudely
&gt;passionate&quot; way. All of us have successes in persuading people not to
&gt;declaw. The &quot;kindly&quot; people get those of a sensitive disposition,
&gt;people like me get the people who are untouched by the &quot;kindly&quot; folk,
&gt;but are brought up short by people like me. They tell me so. There's
&gt;room for both approaches and both are successful. I'd say we cover all
&gt;the bases here.

&gt;&gt; I am pleading for more empathy and less judgement.

&gt;&gt;From me? You want me to empathise with people who abuse animals? I've
&gt;spent my life rescuing abused cats and you want me not to judge those
&gt;who do it? Forget it.

&gt;&gt; Try to understand what the other person was thinking
&gt;&gt; and help them see how they might be able to do it
&gt;&gt; differently next time.

&gt;I'll leave that to the &quot;kindly&quot; folk. I could never begin to understand
&gt;what goes through the mind of anyone who could mutilate their cat in
&gt;full knowledge of what they're doing. They're an alien species.

&gt;&gt; You know, if a cat was as aggressive as some of you,
&gt;&gt; this very same newsgroup would be advising the
&gt;&gt; cat be neutered or spayed

&gt;Well of course all cats should be neutered or spayed, but it has nothing
&gt;to do with managing aggression, it's to do with being socially
&gt;responsible.

&gt;&gt; to mellow it out a bit.

&gt;I have been &quot;spayed&quot; actually. Didn't make any difference.

&gt;&gt; What would an animal behaviorist say --
&gt;&gt; you were abused?

&gt;They might. In a way they'd be right, because the longer you spend in
&gt;rescue the more horrifying things you see - which is a kind of abuse, I
&gt;guess. It doesn't exactly endear the people who do these things to you.

&gt;&gt; Human beings have to manage anger.

&gt;Not always. There are times that anger is extremely well placed.

&gt;&gt; Care about the cat owners.

&gt;I respect people who treat animals with respect. I despise those who
&gt;don't.

&gt;&gt; I commend you for caring so much about cats.

&gt;Thanks, but it's not just cats. I care deeply for all animals.

&gt;&gt; I'm a renewed convert to how important it is to
&gt;&gt; share life with animals.

&gt;It's not just sharing life with animals though, is it? It's treating
&gt;those animals you force to share your life with you with decency and
&gt;respect. It's not subjecting them to abusive practices simply because
&gt;doing so is convenient to your own selfish desires. It's acknowledging
&gt;that living beings other than yourself have the right to live their
&gt;lives free from fear, free from pain and free from exploitation by man.
&gt;It's choosing to protect them from these things, even though we are able

Yes, I want to stay out of the debate but I wanted to tell you about
SoftPaws®. They work pretty well. I'm surprised my cat actually left them
on and didn't try to remove them--he's a feisty critter. But they do work
and you can order them online at  www.softpaws.com . The only complaint I
have, is that if you have wicker, the softpaws can still allow a cat's claws
to catch and pull on wicker 'threads' and do damage. However, upholstered
couches and the sort are very protected. I also try to keep my cat from
scratching inappropriate items through various training methods, because in
case a softpaw falls off, that one little exposed claw can still do damage.
You must check them regularly to make sure they're all still on.

But they're worth a try, especially if your furniture isn't wicker like
mine.

No, but people wouldn't have to drop their cat off in a shelter for
scratching if they took the time to teach correct behaviour to their cat.
Cats don't have destructive tendencies, they have natural behaviours. These
behaviours are not acceptable for many people, so they must take the
initiative to teach their cat correct behaviours.

| This declawer is no barbarian. They are a person that is integrating a
pet
| into a home.

Why should integrating a cat in the home involve abusing the cat? This IS
barbaric. It is not necessary. There are many other options available if
the cat shows no signs of learning what is acceptable. I don't think the
people you speak of have honestly tried everything. Clipping claws
significantly reduces damage and does not hurt the cat. There are claw
covers that slip over the claw and make them unable to damage anything in
the event the cat does scratch. Tin foil on the object they scratch is
known to deter scratching because it is uncomfortable for the cat. There
are many more. The first two I listed are pretty much garuanteed to work.
What excuse is there for not doing this?

Believe me, by six months old you have an idea if your pet is
| a destructive type or not.
|

Your cat is still a baby at the age of six months. And, like human children
they still make mistakes. Would you mutilate your child for making a
mistake? I don't think so. Just because a cat is not human does not mean
that it is not allowed to make a few mistakes before it actually learns the
behaviour that is acceptable. They can make mistakes all their lives and
mutilating them would still not be an option.

My two cats were still scratching certain things when they were six months
old, but I took the time to teach them it was not acceptable. They do not
scratch anything but their scratching posts now. The problem is that it
DOES take time, and many people are unwilling to invest the time that is
necessary. Also, many people use tactics that are affective for humans.
Cats do not learn the same way humans do. Try teaching your cat the way
their mother would. When a mother cat does not like what her baby is doing
she pushes it away, she makes a warning sound, she shows it what is
acceptable, then she rewards the kitten for behaving correctly. For a
scratching kitten, push it away from the thing you don't want it to
scratch, say no firmly, and take it to a scratching post and show it what
to do, then reward it with a treat or a loving rub. This worked for me, and
it was cheaper then declawing. Sure it took longer, but I didn't have to
abuse my cats to get the desired effect.

If this had failed I would have tried one of the many other options
available to me. Declawing is not an option when there are so many other
more useful and less harmful ways of going about it.

Wow, what a post!

Firstly, I commend you for taking the time to find out about declawing before
ging ahead and doing it. And also for finding the strength to question the
all- knowing vet, and for listening to your gut. Kitty is lucky to have an
owner who has truly committed herself to doing what's best for all... :-)

Secondly, such wisdom in your words. I agree with you absolutely - 100%.
The attacks on people who've already declawed - whether they realize it was a
mistake, or if they still feel it was right - does little for the cause of
preventing declawing IMO, in fact it may actually hurt. Namecalling is what
children do - as adults with maturity and self-control, we can accomplish
more by understanding our opponents and then having reasoned discussion with
them. I think you've hit the nail on the head when you also say that all of
the venom in here serves to prevent many from asking questions or otherwise
participating.

I don't know if your eloquent post will reach your intended audience, but I
for one have heard your words and will certainly try to remember them in the
future.

Thanx for the contribution,

Sorry.. I can not agree.

Do you know anybody that just did not have enough time to devote to their
children to potty training that they just did something abusive to them
because of it?

For many of us, there is no fine line between what abuse is and is not. There
is absolutely no excuse to abuse your animals. There is no excuse to abuse
your child.. There is no halfway mark and because somebody just did not have
time or patience, it only makes the excuse worse.

You don't make excuses to abuse things.. you just don't. And don't expect
many of the anti declawers here to be sympathetic because they wont. There
is just no excuse for abuse.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not think that the vast majority of owners would

&gt;&gt;There are many, many other things that will work if you actually put any

it's important to realize that training cats not to declaw doesn't necessitate

declawing; because to train a cat is often relatively easy, and not that
unreasonable to expect of someone who wants a cat. Problems arise when some
people revel in the cuteness of their kitten as it climbs up the drapes, then
when the kitten starts to weigh more than a pound or two, their excuse for
declawing is how destructive he is by nature. Also, people commonly choose
declawing as an option instead of training (more $$, but easier) as opposed to
an option only to be considered if wholehearted training efforts fail.

I have stated my opinion...keeping in mind this is my opinion. North
American Vets have not unilaterally voted to veto the declaw. I guess our
vets love abusing cats (heavy sarcasm). Being as how I live here and our
vets differ in opinion from the UK vets...I chose to believe their opinions
related to the declaw issue.
I am not going to waste the readers time by listing each and every possible
method of deterring a cat from clawing the daylights out of the house.
Suffice to say that any known info available at the time I used.
I suppose if the vets decided that spaying and neutering is unethical unless
you get the cats opinion, we should all stop doing it. I mean face it...why
spay and neuter?
Is it:
1. Because I have more than one cat? So...just get cats of the same sex or
limit yourself to one cat.
2. Because I do not want my cats breeding? See above.
3. Because nature causes them (the males) to spray? Just get females.
4. Because the females yowl really loud during their heat? Just get males.
Or...hell devoice them. Maybe better yet simulate intercourse by shoving a
pencil into them.
5. Because the cat will be happier. Who says? Did anyone ask the cat?

I will agree with you on one thing...It is easy to get the declaw done. If
we were capable of asking the cats, I wonder if they would chose getting
shot in the face by a spray gun, getting whacked in the head with a paper,
(yea surprise people still do this to cats and dogs), yelled at, chased off,
loud rattling noises, or sent to a shelter to be caged and destroyed, or
declawed. I think... personally... that the propoganda surrounding
declawing is every bit as bloated as the propoganda put out by pro-life
groups regarding abortion, and green-peace regarding commercial and
non-commercial hunting. I worked as a vet assistant in the later part of
the 70's when it was really in vogue to declaw. I cannot say that I saw any
of the botched procedures that a fair number of articles would have one
believing. I have stated it before and I will state it again. I am not in
favour of using declaw as a first line, but when all else fails...I am glad
that it is there. Your furniture and drapery will not survive 5 years of
attempts to teach. I also do not think that declawing a full grown mature,
possibly heavy cat is a good idea. So...you have a kitten...attempt for 3
months...then if it is not working...declaw. Plain and simple. You can
accuse me of abuse and cat hating all you want. That is your right and
opinion. But...as co-chair of the Humane Society in our city, and 9 year
volunteer with Stray Siamese and Cat Rescue Non-kill shelter, I know where I
stand on the issue of declaw and can sleep at night with that decision. At
the no kill shelter we have chosen (as you like that term rather than &quot;had
to&quot;) to declaw more than a few of the dumped cats we recieved in order that
they can live their lives, rather than being gased to death and opened up on
a lab table in a high school science class. Or sorry...is that preferable?

No, but people wouldn't have to drop their cat off in a shelter for
scratching if they took the time to teach correct behaviour to their cat.
Cats don't have destructive tendencies, they have natural behaviours. These
behaviours are not acceptable for many people, so they must take the
initiative to teach their cat correct behaviours.

Why should integrating a cat in the home involve abusing the cat? This IS
barbaric. It is not necessary. There are many other options available if
the cat shows no signs of learning what is acceptable. I don't think the
people you speak of have honestly tried everything. Clipping claws
significantly reduces damage and does not hurt the cat. There are claw
covers that slip over the claw and make them unable to damage anything in
the event the cat does scratch. Tin foil on the object they scratch is
known to deter scratching because it is uncomfortable for the cat. There
are many more. The first two I listed are pretty much garuanteed to work.
What excuse is there for not doing this?

Believe me, by six months old you have an idea if your pet is
| a destructive type or not.
|

Your cat is still a baby at the age of six months. And, like human children
they still make mistakes. Would you mutilate your child for making a
mistake? I don't think so. Just because a cat is not human does not mean
that it is not allowed to make a few mistakes before it actually learns the
behaviour that is acceptable. They can make mistakes all their lives and
mutilating them would still not be an option.

My two cats were still scratching certain things when they were six months
old, but I took the time to teach them it was not acceptable. They do not
scratch anything but their scratching posts now. The problem is that it
DOES take time, and many people are unwilling to invest the time that is
necessary. Also, many people use tactics that are affective for humans.
Cats do not learn the same way humans do. Try teaching your cat the way
their mother would. When a mother cat does not like what her baby is doing
she pushes it away, she makes a warning sound, she shows it what is
acceptable, then she rewards the kitten for behaving correctly. For a
scratching kitten, push it away from the thing you don't want it to
scratch, say no firmly, and take it to a scratching post and show it what
to do, then reward it with a treat or a loving rub. This worked for me, and
it was cheaper then declawing. Sure it took longer, but I didn't have to
abuse my cats to get the desired effect.

If this had failed I would have tried one of the many other options
available to me. Declawing is not an option when there are so many other
more useful and less harmful ways of going about it.

rape isn't that terrible after all. Seems like a stretch, but if you took a
logic course, this is a VALID way of reasoning. So come on, give that one a

something horrific any less significantly traumatic.

&gt; Umm... not a lot of logic, here. You separated my last 6 words out, so that

Frankly I am staggered that there is even a debate in the U.S. I have spoken
to many many British cat owners, and not one of them has ever said that they
wished they had the right to mutilate their pets.

I do not want to stereotype Americans, but I abhor the way certain of them
mistreat their animals. I have recently returned from an 18-month period of
work in California. One of my work colleagues, who seemed perfectly normal in
every way, mentioned that her cat was becoming very quiet, withdrawn and
miserable and she couldn't work out why.

On further investigation it transpired that she had had all its' claws
removed, NEVER let it out of the house and bathed it every week.

And she wondered why it was miserable!

Truly staggering....

Some of the cats in my apartment building roam around the garage, and sit on
the cars.. or walk on the cars. Mine do not.

My neighbors told my landlady yesterday, that if they saw one of my cats
(assuming that they were my cats that were walking on their cars) on their
car, they would MACE them. I asked which neighbor, and she said she would
not tell me &quot;unless something happened&quot; but by then, it would be too late.

Many of the neighbors cats trash the property by pooing all over the place,
walking on cars, digging up the plants, etc. So they started asking us to
keep our cats in. I told her (at the time, my cats did not even roam inside
of the property) my cats only roam outside the property by the ivy, and she
said it would probably be ok unless they started comming in the garage, and
pooing all over the place etc.

Most of the neighbors started keeping their cats in, but I did not see any
need to. My landlady told me, if someone complains to the owner, then I
would have to bring them in. I told her, if someone complained to the owner
that I would MOVE before I had to make them strictly indoor cats.

Lately they been following me into the apartment complex and up to the door.
Even though there are other cats out there, I don't know why they are picking
on me specifically.

I need some quick references to some animal cruelty laws (in United States)if
there are any, so I can show her that this is illegal to premeditate the
abuse of an animal.. (it *should* be illegal if it is not already)

I just can't believe that someone would TELL my landlady what they intended to
do to my cats.. :(

Any help from the experts out there would be appreciated.

Rhonda

&gt;&gt;4. Because the females yowl really loud during their heat? Just get males.

&gt; And then he will spray. Wow, nice form of logic here. (Sorry to be the one

&gt;&gt;Or...hell devoice them. Maybe better yet simulate intercourse by shoving a

I agree with Rhonda absolutely.

There is not such thing has &quot;have to&quot; and no excuse.

Taking the time to find out exactly what having a cat means (or any
animal or children) costs nothing.. know what to expect and be very
sure.

Maybe that would result in less animals being dumped in shelters I
doubt declawing does judging by the number of decalwed cats that are
dumped anyway...

I for one might have a little more respect for those people that
defend declawing if they stood up and said they couldn't be bothered
to spend time and energy on training but that's always hidden by a
noble excuse like 'saving' the cat giving it a 'good' home etc. Sad as
it is there are always unwanted cats (other animals and children too).

No animal welfare group I know of supports this practice, it is
condemmed. No literature I have found, yet, suggests it is anything
but detrimental to the CAT.

What is wrong with the society is the assumption that it is a 'right'
to abuse and mutilate for convienience. And the fact is that yes, some
people do find it easier to find money than time. And some people
measure caring in monetary units.

Anyone that declawed a cat here would be prosecuted for animal abuse
and very likely banned from keeping one ever again.

If a cat is 'destructive' and how do you define that?

Then it is not a physical problem but a behavioural one. Cats are
complex they have the same area in their brains we have in ours that
deals with 'emotion'.

Scratching is NOT destructive behaviour in a cat it is natural
'instinctive' behaviour.

Any book, magazine article will tell you that. Another good reason for
finding out about cats prior to thinking that looks cute I'll have
one.

And if I come accreoss as unsympathetic that's fine on this subject I
am.

&gt;For many of us, there is no fine line between what abuse is and is not. There
&gt;is absolutely no excuse to abuse your animals. There is no excuse to abuse
&gt;your child.. There is no halfway mark and because somebody just did not have
&gt;time or patience, it only makes the excuse worse.

&gt;You don't make excuses to abuse things.. you just don't. And don't expect

&gt;&gt; a cat lovers forum to share an experience.

&gt;&gt; This person obviously cares about their cats. However, due to some
&gt;&gt; inability on the cats parts or the owners lifestyle (no criticism meant
&gt;&gt; here, most of us don't have 24 hours a day to devote to our pets) the cat
&gt;&gt; was felt to be destructive.

&gt;&gt; I agree, in many ways declawing is barbaric. However, putting cats in a
&gt;&gt; shelter due to their destructive tendencies is even more so. Many people
&gt;&gt; resort to that than I care to think. Or the tried and true, drop it off in
&gt;&gt; farm country, it will take care of itself method. Is this better?
&gt;&gt; This declawer is no barbarian. They are a person that is integrating a pet
&gt;&gt; into a home. Believe me, by six months old you have an idea if your pet is
&gt;&gt; a destructive type or not.

&gt;&gt; This person that attacked another in this diatribe, should work more on
&gt;&gt; their relationship with people, because they don't do their cats any favor
&gt;&gt; if they are unable to communicate with the rest of the population on how to
&gt;&gt; care for their cats.

&gt;&gt; It may be my bias but this person who attacked may have more time in their
&gt;&gt; life than this other person to dedicate to their cats. Not all of us do.
&gt;&gt; If only the people that could dedicate all the time in the world to their
&gt;&gt; pets had them, there would be many more in the shelters and that would only
&gt;&gt; do a disservice to the pets. Maybe we should work on the veterinarians on
&gt;&gt; developing a better method of minimizing the effect of a cats claws.

&gt;&gt; Think about it. The people that abuse their pets don't take the time and
&gt;&gt; money to have their pets declawed they just toss that one out and get
&gt;&gt; another... It may not be the way to care for a pet in your definition, but
&gt;&gt; it is better than many get.

Rhonda,
I'm no expert :) but...

Does you state have a web site? might be a place to start looking.
I think animal abuse laws vary from state to state for instance in
California and Florida it's a felony other states a misdemeanour. And
I have no idea what the deem constitutes abuse.

My $.02: Declawing IS illegal in most modern countries. It's considered
&quot;Cruel and unusual punishment&quot;.

I know scratching SUCKS! but that's life with cats. If you start cutting
their nails when they're little, they don't mind so much, and if you provide
good scratching posts, the problem can be non-existant. Our cat hasn't
damaged a thing (from scratching... :) ).

&gt;&gt;I don't think we'd better go there.....

&gt;&gt;&gt; He was not the only one in the shelter that was declawed
&gt;&gt;&gt; (there was one more that was brought in the previous day).

&gt;&gt;No, I can believe that. Sadly countless people tell us that all the
&gt;&gt;shelters always have declawed cats, which nullifies the pro-declawers'
&gt;&gt;claims that by declawing, the cat keeps its home. What declawing
&gt;&gt;clearly does is keep the cat in its home for a little longer, until it
&gt;&gt;provides its owner with a second problem that the owner is too
&gt;&gt;inadequate to deal with and that can't be fixed by an unethical vet or
&gt;&gt;by throwing money at someone else for a quick fix.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that he was the guide's favorite, or maybe the guide
&gt;&gt;&gt; thought that the chances of him getting adopted were slim...
&gt;&gt;&gt; he had one day left before getting put to sleep.

&gt;&gt;Yep, despite this all-powerful panacea that the pro-declawers claim
&gt;&gt;declawing to be. The poor creatures are maimed and mutilated by people
&gt;&gt;who claim to love them, and then get dumped and killed anyway.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sorry that I did not explain myself better.

&gt;&gt;No problem, I'm sure we all understand where you're coming from now. My
&gt;&gt;exasperated reaction is based on the fact that I am absolutely sick to
&gt;&gt;death of pig-ignorant people coming here and justifying the abuse of
&gt;&gt;cats by perpetrating the myth that they must be declawed because
&gt;&gt;otherwise the owners will be savaged, their children will be scarred
&gt;&gt;for life and their houses will be destroyed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have read up on cats who are declawed and I know the drawbacks.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe people will think about them before they go and have their cat
&gt;&gt;&gt; declawed.

&gt;&gt;Sadly, experience shows that most people won't.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You have to think about the cat.

&gt;&gt;You and I, and a select few on these NGs, think you have to think about
&gt;&gt;the cat. Millions of your fellow countrymen think that you have to
&gt;&gt;think about your inanimate objects before you think about the cat.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Moo-Moo has not had any problems with the litterbox...which I have
heard
&gt;&gt;&gt; that some cats do after being declawed. His ballance is fine...and he
&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt; no problem with us touching his feet.

&gt;&gt;I'm very glad your cat is okay, but as you say, there are plenty of
&gt;&gt;people who will testify that their cats are not.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that everyone has a right to their own opinion. Wether or not
&gt;&gt;&gt; people want to declaw or not declaw is up to them. If we get a law
&gt; passed
&gt;&gt;&gt; that is against declawing that is Okay with me.

&gt;&gt;Yes, everyone has a right to their opinion, but there is a big
&gt;&gt;difference between believing something to be acceptable and in it
&gt;&gt;actually being morally or ethically acceptable.

&gt;&gt;Paedophiles are of the opinion that sex with children is acceptable.
&gt;&gt;Does that make it so? Hitler believed that murdering six million Jews
&gt;&gt;was acceptable - and that was also legal. Did that make it morally or
&gt;&gt;ethically acceptable?

&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, but you're not going to convince me that the whole British
&gt;&gt; population is as rude as you are. I still maintain that you should speak
&gt;&gt; for yourself, rather than declare your views and most especially manners,
to
&gt;&gt; be representative of those of the whole of Great Britain. I've seen at
&gt;&gt; least two other posts that basically told you the same thing. Go ahead
and
&gt;&gt; speak for yourself, but not for millions of people of whom you've never
met,
&gt;&gt; and who most likely, and hopefully, have a lot more tact and tolerance/
&gt;&gt; respect for others' opinions than you do. Cathy

&gt;I am quite confident that PD does in fact speak for the vast majority, if
not
&gt;the whole, of Great Britain. I know of no British vet who will perform this
&gt;operation, and believe it may even be illegal.

"/> Read my post again, please. I said, &quot;..and most especially manners, to be
representative of those of the whole of Great Britain.&quot; PD's opinions are
her opinions, and she has a right to state them as often as she pleases.
What I find to be the problem with her posts, is her condescending,
self-righteous attitude. PD seems to think that only *her* opinions (or
others' whose match hers precisely) are the ones that should be treated with
any respect. She has stated that others are free and welcome to voice their
opinions, but when they do - if those opinions differ from hers, the posters
are met with insults and/ or a holier-than-thou attitude. I truly do not
feel that most of the British population would be this openly rude and
inconsiderate to someone. PD wants to convince people that declawing is
wrong, but insulting others is not the best way to go about it, if she wants
others to respect and seriously consider her opinions. Cathy

declaw as a front-line solution. But when push comes to shove and the

&gt;You know, I find the persons responses to the individual that &quot;had&quot; to
&gt;declaw their cat and example of what is wrong with our society today.
&gt;This person that declawed their cat first of all is writing voluntarily, in
&gt;a cat lovers forum to share an experience.

&gt;This person obviously cares about their cats. However, due to some
&gt;inability on the cats parts or the owners lifestyle (no criticism meant
&gt;here, most of us don't have 24 hours a day to devote to our pets) the cat
&gt;was felt to be destructive.

&gt;I agree, in many ways declawing is barbaric. However, putting cats in a
&gt;shelter due to their destructive tendencies is even more so. Many people
&gt;resort to that than I care to think. Or the tried and true, drop it off in
&gt;farm country, it will take care of itself method. Is this better?
&gt;This declawer is no barbarian. They are a person that is integrating a
pet
&gt;into a home. Believe me, by six months old you have an idea if your pet is
&gt;a destructive type or not.

&gt;This person that attacked another in this diatribe, should work more on
&gt;their relationship with people, because they don't do their cats any favor
&gt;if they are unable to communicate with the rest of the population on how to
&gt;care for their cats.

&gt;It may be my bias but this person who attacked may have more time in their
&gt;life than this other person to dedicate to their cats. Not all of us do.
&gt;If only the people that could dedicate all the time in the world to their
&gt;pets had them, there would be many more in the shelters and that would only
&gt;do a disservice to the pets. Maybe we should work on the veterinarians on
&gt;developing a better method of minimizing the effect of a cats claws.

&gt;Think about it. The people that abuse their pets don't take the time and
&gt;money to have their pets declawed they just toss that one out and get
&gt;another... It may not be the way to care for a pet in your definition,
but
&gt;it is better than many get.

&gt;&gt;&gt; in the past we have had to declaw a grand total of

&gt;&gt;You have not &quot;had&quot; to declaw at all. Nobody forced you, so be honest

&gt;&gt;&gt; Having to have to break down and de-claw

&gt;&gt;And there you go again with this &quot;having&quot; business. So somebody held a

&gt;&gt;&gt; was the hardest thing we were faced with doing.

&gt;&gt;Not hard enough, obviously, or you wouldn't have done it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not think that the vast majority of owners would
&gt;&gt;&gt; use de-claw as a first line of clawing cure.

&gt;&gt;Well that where you're wrong, because the majority of people declaw
&gt;&gt;their cats pre-emptively as kittens, before the poor creatures have had
&gt;&gt;the chance to show whether they're likely to scratch anything at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally I am a cheapskate...had anything else worked...

&gt;&gt;There are many, many other things that will work if you actually put any
&gt;&gt;effort into training a cat. Just why can millions of people around the
&gt;&gt;world manage to do this, yet you are too inadequate to do so?

&gt;&gt;&gt; i would have done it gladly, rather than
&gt;&gt;&gt; spend 198.00 plus taxes times 3.

&gt;&gt;Then why did you choose the easy option when all it takes is effort and
&gt;&gt;application?

&gt;| This declawer is no barbarian. They are a person that is integrating a

&gt;Why should integrating a cat in the home involve abusing the cat? This IS
&gt;barbaric. It is not necessary. There are many other options available if
&gt;the cat shows no signs of learning what is acceptable. I don't think the
&gt;people you speak of have honestly tried everything. Clipping claws
&gt;significantly reduces damage and does not hurt the cat. There are claw
&gt;covers that slip over the claw and make them unable to damage anything in
&gt;the event the cat does scratch. Tin foil on the object they scratch is
&gt;known to deter scratching because it is uncomfortable for the cat. There
&gt;are many more. The first two I listed are pretty much garuanteed to work.
&gt;What excuse is there for not doing this?

"/> I think that basic nettiquette is in order here. I find it thoroughly
disgusting for someone to presume that a person who declaws is abusing their
pets. Most people I know do not spend their hard earned money to abuse an
animal. They kick them, light them on fire...the list goes on. As for you
two suggestions...yea riiiiiight! Reducing damage is not eliminating
damage. There are also some people that try to do a good deed and take
strays into their homes saving them from disease running shelters, and
euthanasia. These strays are older cats that may not take too kindly to
having you clip it's claws. The wonderful claw covers you mention by the
way? Forget it!! I would sooner put my cat to sleep than put those hidious
things on their toes. We had one cat we tried it with and she wound up back
in the vet with tpaed ribs....she ran at the counter...leaped...and slid off
the other side into a straight backed chair. She constantly chewed her toes
to remove the caps, to the point her cuticles were bleeding. She walked
with the constant flicking of her feet for over 2 weeks. And this is
acceptable? You are in a catch 22 with a cat who is determined to relieve
your furniture of fabric. And how do you make tinfoil an asthetically
pleasing addition to a room's decor?
At the time I had to declaw, i had tried every option available. Trust in
that or not..that is up to you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Believe me, by six months old you have an idea if your pet is

&gt;|

&gt;Your cat is still a baby at the age of six months. And, like human children
&gt;they still make mistakes. Would you mutilate your child for making a
&gt;mistake? I don't think so. Just because a cat is not human does not mean
&gt;that it is not allowed to make a few mistakes before it actually learns the
&gt;behaviour that is acceptable. They can make mistakes all their lives and
&gt;mutilating them would still not be an option.

"/> By 6 months they are sexually mature cats. We spay and neuter them at that
age...and if a declaw is going to be done...it is better to do it all at the
same time. Anesthetic is a health risk whether human or animal, and it is
more kind to the cat to have it all done in one shot.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; My two cats were still scratching certain things when they were six months
&gt;old, but I took the time to teach them it was not acceptable. They do not
&gt;scratch anything but their scratching posts now. The problem is that it
&gt;DOES take time, and many people are unwilling to invest the time that is
&gt;necessary. Also, many people use tactics that are affective for humans.
&gt;Cats do not learn the same way humans do. Try teaching your cat the way
&gt;their mother would. When a mother cat does not like what her baby is doing
&gt;she pushes it away, she makes a warning sound, she shows it what is
&gt;acceptable, then she rewards the kitten for behaving correctly. For a
&gt;scratching kitten, push it away from the thing you don't want it to
&gt;scratch, say no firmly, and take it to a scratching post and show it what
&gt;to do, then reward it with a treat or a loving rub. This worked for me, and
&gt;it was cheaper then declawing. Sure it took longer, but I didn't have to
&gt;abuse my cats to get the desired effect.

"/> I have a news flash for you...the mother cats grabs it's baby by the
whiskers and gives a hard tug when the kitten has displayed a &quot;bad&quot;
behaviour, they also clout them with a hard bat of the paw. Ever wonder why
the occasional kitten comes to it's new home sans whiskers? Well...that is
why. As for condoning behaviors...we should lick our cats? Rough tongue
baths across the sides of the nose (the scent glands) are one of the most
popular methods of loving behavior that the mother cat displays. So yanking
a cat's whiskers, and whacking it in the head with our &quot;paws&quot; are better
than a declaw...you wanna talk abuse? The kittens do not carry a memory of
&quot;maternal love.&quot; Nor will they understand it. Want to see how true that
statement is? Take the kitten back to the mother after a mere 6 weeks.
They will hiss at each other and not recall any family tie. It always makes
me feel great to hear of people so in love with their cats. Never has there
been a greater gift than a cats love. But to love the cat is one
thing...the other is to always remember...they are animals that we are
bringing into our domain. We are giving them a better life (in our opinion)
than that which they would otherwise have. They are not hunted...they are
not skinned for fur, and hopefully, they are not tortured. We also have to
face the reality that some things will not fit with our lifestyle. A cat
that claws people, or destroys furnishings does not have to have it's life
taken away. A simple...safe...and much improved procedure can eliminate
that damage.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;If this had failed I would have tried one of the many other options
&gt;available to me. Declawing is not an option when there are so many other
&gt;more useful and less harmful ways of going about it.

dies of old age? Sorry...I disagree.

Logic? You are talking human to animal..how can you bring in logic...Ask
yourself why you spay and neuter. Now if you ask the cat...would they want
their hormones removed to save you urine stains on the carpet or nights of
sleep during their heat? There is technically no &quot;real&quot; reason to desex a
cat...but we do it....you have picked one forum out of many...spay
neuter...sex change to combat FUS, altering the natural design of a cat
based on what breeders prefer. The list goes on. A cat owner who declaws
is attempting not inexpensively either to insure a happy existance for both
of them. That is my opinion.

&gt;it...why
&gt;&gt;spay and neuter?
&gt;&gt;Is it:
&gt;&gt;1. Because I have more than one cat? So...just get cats of the same sex
or
&gt;&gt;limit yourself to one cat.

Sometimes I really don't think people have tried everything before they
decide to declaw. I don't know anyone's personal situations, so I won't
judge anybody else, but I had a humdinger of a case with my cat, and after
behavioural consultations, I finally did find solutions. Balloons and
sticky tape, plexiglass on doors, etc. Believe me, my cat was difficult,
but we finally did it after 2-1/2 years, when I found my solutions.

Good luck to anyone having this problem. Don't want to offend anyone who
has already declawed their kitties. I'm glad they gave them a home, that's
my more urgent concern.

I agree. There is no excuse for abuse. Here in the Phoenix area where I
live, if you abuse an animal the Maricopa County Sheriffs Department will
arrest and jail those who do. Good thing we have guys like Sheriff Joe to
have created such a wonderful service to the community. Besides those who
abuse animals it also makes me sick that people just abandon animals
or give them up becuase they are moving. People like that also shouldn't
have pets.

&gt;&gt; a cat lovers forum to share an experience.

&gt;&gt; This person obviously cares about their cats. However, due to some
&gt;&gt; inability on the cats parts or the owners lifestyle (no criticism meant
&gt;&gt; here, most of us don't have 24 hours a day to devote to our pets) the cat
&gt;&gt; was felt to be destructive.

&gt;&gt; I agree, in many ways declawing is barbaric. However, putting cats in a
&gt;&gt; shelter due to their destructive tendencies is even more so. Many people
&gt;&gt; resort to that than I care to think. Or the tried and true, drop it off in
&gt;&gt; farm country, it will take care of itself method. Is this better?
&gt;&gt; This declawer is no barbarian. They are a person that is integrating a pet
&gt;&gt; into a home. Believe me, by six months old you have an idea if your pet is
&gt;&gt; a destructive type or not.

&gt;&gt; This person that attacked another in this diatribe, should work more on
&gt;&gt; their relationship with people, because they don't do their cats any favor
&gt;&gt; if they are unable to communicate with the rest of the population on how to
&gt;&gt; care for their cats.

&gt;&gt; It may be my bias but this person who attacked may have more time in their
&gt;&gt; life than this other person to dedicate to their cats. Not all of us do.
&gt;&gt; If only the people that could dedicate all the time in the world to their
&gt;&gt; pets had them, there would be many more in the shelters and that would only
&gt;&gt; do a disservice to the pets. Maybe we should work on the veterinarians on
&gt;&gt; developing a better method of minimizing the effect of a cats claws.

&gt;&gt; Think about it. The people that abuse their pets don't take the time and
&gt;&gt; money to have their pets declawed they just toss that one out and get
&gt;&gt; another... It may not be the way to care for a pet in your definition, but
&gt;&gt; it is better than many get.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was the hardest thing we were faced with doing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Not hard enough, obviously, or you wouldn't have done it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not think that the vast majority of owners would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use de-claw as a first line of clawing cure.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well that where you're wrong, because the majority of people declaw
&gt;&gt;&gt;their cats pre-emptively as kittens, before the poor creatures have had
&gt;&gt;&gt;the chance to show whether they're likely to scratch anything at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally I am a cheapskate...had anything else worked...

&gt;&gt;&gt;There are many, many other things that will work if you actually put any
&gt;&gt;&gt;effort into training a cat. Just why can millions of people around the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; i would have done it gladly, rather than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spend 198.00 plus taxes times 3.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Then why did you choose the easy option when all it takes is effort and

homes! Not for carpets. Actually no. Your attitude is transparent; it
doesn't take self-righteousness to accuse you. (Relativism, as it happens,

:Not the sort of thing that happens much nowadays in decent countries

Declawing avoids putting them down!
:Why did you have to introduce yourself to the activity of keeping cats in

there is evidence to suggest that the rate of neutering domestic cats
increases in line with a lower rate of provision of homes.
There, if you like, is cruelty to be kind. Not so very cruel!

&gt; Logic? You are talking human to animal..how can you bring in logic...Ask
&gt; yourself why you spay and neuter. Now if you ask the cat...would they want
&gt; their hormones removed to save you urine stains on the carpet or nights of
&gt; sleep during their heat? There is technically no &quot;real&quot; reason to desex a
&gt; cat...but we do it....you have picked one forum out of many...spay
&gt; neuter...sex change to combat FUS, altering the natural design of a cat
&gt; based on what breeders prefer. The list goes on. A cat owner who declaws
&gt; is attempting not inexpensively either to insure a happy existance for both
&gt; of them. That is my opinion.

&gt;&gt;Of course, an owner could always do something worse, so that makes

&gt;&gt;justified? Sure, an owner could choose to euthanize rather than declaw,
&gt;&gt;therefore declawing she be performed? What kind of logic is? Let's use that
&gt;&gt;someplace else, like perhaps rape. I suppose that murder is much worse, so
&gt;&gt;rape isn't that terrible after all. Seems like a stretch, but if you took a
&gt;&gt;logic course, this is a VALID way of reasoning. So come on, give that one a

creatures. That my friend IMHO is abuse with a capitol A. Sorry but again

you stand in the eyes of the law, ie will she be violating any laws if she
sprays mace on a cat because it is on her car 3) become very familiar with
the above information, fast 4) call a lawyer (law association?) in your area,
try to get a quick appointment. Some will give you a free first visit of 15
min or half an hour. Find out exactly what your civil rights are - ie, what
are all the *potential* charges/civil actions that could be taken against
this nasty neighbour if they follow through on their threat 5) inform the
landlord asap that you have been in touch with a lawyer and will be taking
any action necessary should *any* harm come to your cat. BS a little if you
have to and let him know that he'll be named as a party in your suit since he
is protecting the person who has made this threat. Ask him to be sure to
pass this information on to the neighbour. A little BS doesn't hurt;
indicate that you are documenting all of your communications with him and
taking other measures to ensure the safety of your pets. Maybe insinuate
something to the effect of a hidden videocamera or something, in case they're
thinking of taking your cat or killing it. You don't have to follow through
with everything; the point is to let them know that you're not just gonna sit
there and hide in your apt if they threaten your pets. Hopefully, they'll
get nervous and decide not to take a chance. 6) start documenting all contact
7) start looking for another apartment 8) don't think you're being paranoid.
You have a cat-hater's eyes on your cats. Worse stuff has happened. Where I
live, there was a case some years ago about a man who hated his neighbours,
so he beat their Himalayan with a metal bar, breaking every bone in the body
- but the cat was still alive so he put it in a bucket of water. No, your
neighbours probably aren't that crazy. But I'd rather be paranoid and know
that my cat is safe and alive. 9) I'd also consider keeping the cat inside
until you move.

This may be a little extreme, but I don't take *any* chances with my guys...

Good luck Rhonda, &amp; keep us posted.

Gotta agree with PD on this one. Back
feet declawed? I've never heard of
this! Why? Did you know that cats with
their back claws can still defend
themselves, run faster, climb trees,
play harder? Why take away the back
claws? (Why take away the *front*
ones?) My reason for not declawing?
Because too many people get a cat and
can't keep it in the house. So they
have it as an indoor/outdoor cat...
sooner or later, the little puss is
outdoor only and defenseless. Get a cat
and train it! It can be done!

Ask Tippy (God Rest), Inky (GR), Missy
(GR), Cowboy (my 28 lb. *love*, God rest
his soul), Bubba (GR) and Sade... still
alive, with four paws... all claws!

Give them a chance!

I find it thoroughly disgusting that someone would mutilate their cat
because their precious furniture has a few scratches. I guess we're even.

Most people I know do not spend their hard earned money to abuse an
| animal. They kick them, light them on fire...the list goes on. As for
you
| two suggestions...yea riiiiiight! Reducing damage is not eliminating
| damage. There are also some people that try to do a good deed and take

| euthanasia. These strays are older cats that may not take too kindly to
| having you clip it's claws.

Since spending money to save your furniture is not a problem, why not spend
that money taking the cat to the vet to get it's claws clipped? Cost, about
10 dollars per trip at my vet. Not a cheap endeavour, but far more humane
than declawing.

And how do you make tinfoil an asthetically
| pleasing addition to a room's decor?

Who cares? Is your furniture really that much more important to you then
the well being of your cat? Besides that, you only leave the tin foil on
for the length of time it takes for the cat to not consider the peice of
furniture all that fun to scratch. If asthetics are that important to you,
remove the tin foil for company.

| At the time I had to declaw, i had tried every option available. Trust
in
| that or not..that is up to you.

Maybe you didn't try long enough. Granted, teaching your cat not to scratch
is very frustrating. I found myself on the verge of pulling my hair out
many times because of the frustration. But I stuck with it. I realise I am
lucky enough to have cats who learned relatively quickly, but even if they
never learned I wouldn't have put my furniture before them.

| &gt;
| &gt; Believe me, by six months old you have an idea if your pet is
| &gt;| a destructive type or not.
| &gt;|
|
|
| By 6 months they are sexually mature cats. We spay and neuter them at
that
| age...and if a declaw is going to be done...it is better to do it all at
the
| same time. Anesthetic is a health risk whether human or animal, and it
is
| more kind to the cat to have it all done in one shot.

Sexually mature has nothing to do with emotionally mature. As humans we are
capable of reproducing in our early teens, that doesn't necessarily mean we
are ready emotionally to do so. Cats may be ready to reproduce at the age
of six months, but they are still very much kittens with a lot to learn
about what is acceptable in their human's house, and what is not.

&quot;More kind&quot; still isn't kind. At six months you havn't given the kitten a
fair chance at proving him or herself. You haven't given your cat the
chance to learn what you are trying to teach it. People who adopt their
kittens at the age of 4 or 5 months who read your post will think &quot;Okay,
I've given him a month or so, he still hasn't learned, so I guess I'll just
get him declawed because he is incapable of learning past 6 months.&quot; Not
true. A cat is still learning at six months, and far beyond that.

As for condoning behaviors...we should lick our cats? Rough tongue
| baths across the sides of the nose (the scent glands) are one of the most
| popular methods of loving behavior that the mother cat displays. So
yanking
| a cat's whiskers, and whacking it in the head with our &quot;paws&quot; are better
| than a declaw...you wanna talk abuse?

I have personally witnessed the motherly behaviour I spoke of, and have
read about it in numerous books. Mother cats may pull whiskers, or paw
their kittens across the head, this is obviously not acceptable for a human
to do. However, mothers are also known to push their kittens away from that
which they are not supposed to touch. This is acceptable. And it works.
Many people I know, and people in this newsgroup have said that it works.
Especially when the cat is young (ie under a year). As for condoning
behaviour, a loving head butt, a scratch in their favourite spot, or a
simple treat would suffice. But, if you want to lick your cat go right
ahead. They might enjoy it.

The kittens do not carry a memory of
| &quot;maternal love.&quot; Nor will they understand it. Want to see how true that
| statement is? Take the kitten back to the mother after a mere 6 weeks.
| They will hiss at each other and not recall any family tie.

When you adopt a kitten _you_ become that kitten's mother in it's mind. You
replace it's biological mother. Feral kittens do not purr or knead. Ever
wonder why? Because these are behaviours displayed to their mothers,
something feral cats don't have. When a kitten is in adopted into a loving
home it purrs and kneads it's owner. Treating the owner as it would it's
mother. Domestic cats are essentially kittens all their lives because they
are always under the influence of their mother, you.

It always makes
| me feel great to hear of people so in love with their cats. Never has
there
| been a greater gift than a cats love. But to love the cat is one
| thing...the other is to always remember...they are animals that we are
| bringing into our domain. We are giving them a better life (in our
opinion)
| than that which they would otherwise have. They are not hunted...they
are
| not skinned for fur, and hopefully, they are not tortured. We also have
to
| face the reality that some things will not fit with our lifestyle. A cat
| that claws people, or destroys furnishings does not have to have it's
life
| taken away. A simple...safe...and much improved procedure can eliminate
| that damage.

Some things you do don't fit in with your cats lifestyle either. If
mutilation is the accepted way of accomodating one to another's domain, how
have you had yourself mutilated to accomodate your cat?

| &gt;
| &gt;If this had failed I would have tried one of the many other options
| &gt;available to me. Declawing is not an option when there are so many other
| &gt;more useful and less harmful ways of going about it.
|
| So tell me..when do you concede? When has enough time passed? When the
cat
| dies of old age? Sorry...I disagree.

I don't concede. If the cat I took responsibility for is incapable of
learning what to scratch and what not to I guess I would have to live with
it. I absolutely refuse to hurt a cat merely because it doesn't love my
furniture as much as I do. I knew when I adopted cats that they came with
claws and the ability to use those claws on my furniture. Obviously it
didn't matter much to me or I would have chosen not to have cats. My
theory: &quot;Try, try again, and if all else fails, love the cat for who it is
and get some fancy slip covers.&quot;

"/> Not may Becky...they do...they will also get up and walk away from a kitten
that is pestering..but should the kitten persist..they will hit it with
their paws. As humans we cannot and should not attempt to re-creat the
behaviours of a mother cat...feline rules are vastly different from human
rules, and instinct is not something a mother cat would ever attempt to
remove in her young. So the concept of playing mother cat to remove a basic
instinct does not make sense. (not saying that in a disrespectful way) It
still comes down to one thing and one thing alone: I am sorry, but if you
are against the mutilation and &quot;hurting&quot; of cats..then you should in all
good faith be against all of it. They are not just giving out
tubal-ligations and vasectomys to cats..they are removing the entire organ.
This includes the removal of it's gender specific hormones. At one point in
time in the not too distant past, Vets were strongly opposed to spaying and
neutering under the one year mark. This was to give the animal a chance to
at least physically mature. Something not possible if you remove the
ovaries and testicles prior to physical maturation. The breeders of
registered cats love spay and neuter...it is a good way for them to attempt
to control what they consider the breeding of imperfect cats, according to
breed standard.
We alter their diet...they are meat eaters..not mush and cookie eaters.
Referring to dry and wet food. We attempt to take away, through
restrcitions to the outdoors, their instinct to hunt. We fill them with
commercial food...See the whole picture...All that I am saying is if all
else fails...declaw is not a guilt trip...it is a surgical procedure to
prevent regrowth of claws. It does not stop them from scratching...just
stops the damage the scratching does. I say again..I am opposed to the
declaw as a front line solution...keep that in mind. Surgery...be it human
or animal is not ever to be taken lightly..anesthesia has risks...therefore
if it looks like declaw is the only solution...do it at the same time you
spay and neuter..and since it is my personal firm belief that a cat should
not be altered before it is at least a year old...that gives the average
kitten purchaser enough time to attempt to change instinct. Not prevent
it...change it. As I have said...all but three of mine learned to use the
posts and trees and catnip cartons. So what I was doing worked for the
majority. There are always exceptions to every rule. That is when I am
glad declaw is available.

&gt;&gt;Of course, an owner could always do something worse, so that makes

From what I understood, it is a misdemenor-&gt;felony to purpously hurt any
animal. Punishable by jail, a fine of 20K or both.

I am not sure if I got this right, but from what I understood from what I
read, it is also a misdemenor for anybody to &quot;impound&quot; your animal if it is
being cared for (for instance, just because they see it on the street, or in
front of their house etc.) if that animal is getting adequate food water and
shelter etc.

hehe.. if I got this right, right on California! :)

Well, lisaviolet helped me find the California Laws and it is a MisD to a
felony to maliciously harm any domestic animal for any number of reasons in
the state of california. I gave the whole print out of laws to my landlady,
and said if anything happens to my cats I will have no problem dragging her
into the lawsuit because she knew who intended to harm my animal.

Now she says she thought it was just an &quot;empty threat&quot;..

I told her, that is not the point. She said she was going to pass along the
info to the neighbor who complained.. and more than likely it would get
brought to the building owners attention and he would either force me to keep
them inside or move.

Shrug.. I told her I would move.. :)

&gt; I don't know if this'll help or not, but this is what I'd do: 1) phone the

&gt; you stand in the eyes of the law, ie will she be violating any laws if she
&gt; sprays mace on a cat because it is on her car 3) become very familiar with
&gt; the above information, fast 4) call a lawyer (law association?) in your area,
&gt; try to get a quick appointment. Some will give you a free first visit of 15
&gt; min or half an hour. Find out exactly what your civil rights are - ie, what
&gt; are all the *potential* charges/civil actions that could be taken against
&gt; this nasty neighbour if they follow through on their threat 5) inform the

&gt; have to and let him know that he'll be named as a party in your suit since he

&gt; indicate that you are documenting all of your communications with him and
&gt; taking other measures to ensure the safety of your pets. Maybe insinuate
&gt; something to the effect of a hidden videocamera or something, in case they're
&gt; thinking of taking your cat or killing it. You don't have to follow through
&gt; with everything; the point is to let them know that you're not just gonna sit
&gt; there and hide in your apt if they threaten your pets. Hopefully,
they'll
&gt; get nervous and decide not to take a chance. 6) start documenting all contact
&gt; 7) start looking for another apartment 8) don't think you're being paranoid.
&gt; You have a cat-hater's eyes on your cats. Worse stuff has happened. Where I
&gt; live, there was a case some years ago about a man who hated his neighbours,
&gt; so he beat their Himalayan with a metal bar, breaking every bone in the body
&gt; - but the cat was still alive so he put it in a bucket of water. No, your
&gt; neighbours probably aren't that crazy. But I'd rather be paranoid and
know
&gt; that my cat is safe and alive. 9) I'd also consider keeping the cat inside
&gt; until you move.

&gt; This may be a little extreme, but I don't take *any* chances with my guys...

&gt; Good luck Rhonda, &amp; keep us posted.

A few simple questions to ask a vet that pushes declawing:

1. Ask for a guarantee that your cats personality will NOT be
affected.

2. Ask for a guarantee your cat will feel no pain or post-surgical
discomfort in it's lifetime as a result of the declawing.

3. Ask for a guarantee the claw will no grow back.

4. Ask for a guarantee that the spine or other bone structure will not
be affected over time due to your cat having to adjust from it's
normal walking/running posture (eg having having to walk on the back
of it's pads instead of it's toes)

I bet they won't guarantee you any of the above and then think about
their motives? Declawing is a business to them.
A bit like tobacco companies telling you cigarrettes aren't
addictive... and do you no harm.

"/> The way I look at it is declawing is for the individual owner's
convenience. But walk into a shelter, go to a petstore with unwanted
kittens, puppies, cats, dogs and bunnies in cages outside, waiting for
new homes, and I KNOW that my decision to spay/neuter was the right
one. What sense does it make to bring more *pets* into this world where
there are already so many that need homes? Add to that the benefits of
no pyrometra, less chance of mammary cancer, no testicular, prostate,
uterine and ovarian cancers. Added medical benefits of declawing? Only
in rare cases. But there's always the possibility of complications
following the surgery. Like needing another surgery to rectify the
first that wasn't done properly (happened to a neighbor of mine, at ten
years old her cat was having a hard time walking and it turned out his
claws were growing back in deformed, needed all four paws redone, almost
didn't live throught the recuperation) or extensive bleeding after the
procedure (another neighbor's daughter works for a vet and told of a cat
being brought in bleeding from the toe mutilation surgery that had been
done by another vet, the cat died during the second surgery, stiff price
for somebody's furniture, there we go a perfect declaw or die situation,
don't you think?) and the stories of cats who no longer use the litter
box because the associate the pain in their paws to the litter box, cats
who develop back problems, cats who begin to bite, cats who become
withdrawn, well, I see many reasons there NOT to take the chance. My
cats don't use their reproductive parts for anything beyond
reproduction. They use their claws for things other than furniture
destruction. But see, I'm one of those people that has a comfortable
home, I'm not obsessed with perfection. As a matter of fact, we've
modified our surroundings for the cats, not our cats for our
surroundings.

I know. I have 19 cats in my home right now, ranging in age from 18 to
4 months. All spay/neutered. All but rescued from the streets or a bad
situation. All have their claws.

Call me selfish if you will, that's fine, it doesn't bother me, because
I KNOW that spaying and neutering an animal serves a much greater
purpose than mutilating it's paws.

And, I for one, look forward to the day, when cats are at such a premium
that a home that would declaw, will be without a cat.

What do you suppose blind people do in countries where there is NO
declawing?

You need to see the claws to know they're there?

Come on..... That line of thinking is patronising to the visually

Nice neighbourhood .....

I think &quot;jwindh&quot; Jen has very good piece of advice.

Try to contact a pet protection association (kind of RSCPA of the States).
They probably have a lawyer who helps them in trials and all legal
procedures, certainly for free. I guess these people of good will are going
to share their lawyer with you. Even if you don't intend to start suing your
neighbours, it may be good that these charming persons know you are not
helpless and harmless.
Make a big fuss of the threats your neighbours did : then they probably
won't do anything to any cat because if something would happen to a cat,
everybody would immediatly point at THEM.

How about the other cat owners of the neighbourhood ? Do they intend to
react or are you the only one to move ?

I think also, like Jen, that you should keep the cats indoors and let them
out when you can watch them.

Don't let them win !

Good luck and let us know !

Until the moment that I was put before the verbal firing squad I was not on
a horse...Not really comfy around the beasts actually. :) Sorry. I have
an opinion differing from the norm on this ng. I would think that the
condemnation of those with differing opinions is riding pretty high up there
too. I started out just offering what I personally believe is an acceptable
last approach to a claw happy kitty. I did not insult nor condemn those who
disagreed with me. Nor did I expect to be accused of animal abuse or cat
hating. but hey...newbies learn I guess. Search the historys to find my
credentials. I am sick of repeating them. It was never my intention to get
into a flame war regarding an issue that I believe is not where near as
important as others are regarding cats. I did as the others did...offered
up a view point.
If you can not use your logic and deductive reasoning to realize that
whether it is a spay or neuter, or declaw...it can fall under your blanket
of abuse. Plus ...if you are this logic wonder...how is it that the
parralells I am using you are taking as literal? Since you seem to require a
literal statement...Our cats cannot speak for themselves...if they
could...would they want this (spay, neuter) done anymore than a delclaw? I
am sure I have made my meaning more than clear enough.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree, in many ways declawing is barbaric. However, putting cats in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shelter due to their destructive tendencies is even more so. Many
people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;resort to that than I care to think. Or the tried and true, drop it off
&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;farm country, it will take care of itself method. Is this better?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This declawer is no barbarian. They are a person that is integrating a
&gt;&gt;&gt;pet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;into a home. Believe me, by six months old you have an idea if your pet
&gt;&gt;is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a destructive type or not.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course, an owner could always do something worse, so that makes
&gt;&gt;declawing
&gt;&gt;&gt;justified? Sure, an owner could choose to euthanize rather than declaw,
&gt;&gt;&gt;therefore declawing she be performed? What kind of logic is? Let's use
&gt;that
&gt;&gt;&gt;someplace else, like perhaps rape. I suppose that murder is much worse,
so
&gt;&gt;&gt;rape isn't that terrible after all. Seems like a stretch, but if you took
&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;logic course, this is a VALID way of reasoning. So come on, give that one
&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;rest. Just because something much worse could happen, does not make
&gt;&gt;&gt;something horrific any less significantly traumatic.

It is only the neighbors in my Apartment Complex. :(

And, the other neighbors with cats, have just brought them in the house and
made them indoor. There are a few that still roam, but mine are very
friendly, so they are the most seen.

My cats were all feral. I can't lock them up.. :( They would hate that.

Oh, and my apartment manager will not tell me who made the threats.. but I
did give her the ca book of laws, and show her that if anybody harms my
animals and she knows about it, then I will sue them all! And pointed out the
fact that it is a misdemenor to a felony in Ca, depending on what they do to
the animal.

&gt; I think &quot;jwindh&quot; Jen has very good piece of advice.

&gt; Try to contact a pet protection association (kind of RSCPA of the States).
&gt; They probably have a lawyer who helps them in trials and all legal
&gt; procedures, certainly for free. I guess these people of good will are going
&gt; to share their lawyer with you. Even if you don't intend to start suing your
&gt; neighbours, it may be good that these charming persons know you are not
&gt; helpless and harmless.
&gt; Make a big fuss of the threats your neighbours did : then they probably
&gt; won't do anything to any cat because if something would happen to a cat,
&gt; everybody would immediatly point at THEM.

&gt; How about the other cat owners of the neighbourhood ? Do they intend to
&gt; react or are you the only one to move ?

&gt; I think also, like Jen, that you should keep the cats indoors and let them
&gt; out when you can watch them.

&gt; Don't let them win !

&gt; Good luck and let us know !

&gt; PS : what if all the people of this NG were writing threatening letters to

&gt;&gt;Don't bet on it...the breeds are re-designed more often than one cares to
&gt;&gt;think. The siamese is the best example, and one that will not have me
&gt;&gt;talking off the top of my head. The decided that the cat was too chunky,
&gt;&gt;too big, and the head was not exotic enough. They streamlined these
&gt;&gt;creatures, bred them smaller and redesigned the head to a severe wedge
&gt;&gt;shape. This resulted in severe bite and jaw problems with the poor
&gt;&gt;creatures. That my friend IMHO is abuse with a capitol A. Sorry but
again
&gt;&gt;I stress that this is just my opinion. I neither condone declawing as a
&gt;&gt;front line cure...nor do I condemne it for those who truly believe that
&gt;they
&gt;&gt;have tried eveything.

&gt;Nonsense. Though the different look of the Siamese may not be for everyone
&gt;(personally, I like it, but I like all breeds of cats), this condition you
&gt;are describing is incorrect. There is no genetically evidence linking the
&gt;two. Additionally, all breeds of cats and dogs have their own associated
&gt;health risks. This is part of *nature*.

"/> uhh huh..
You go check your back issues of Cat Fancy hon. They had to breed out the
extreme wedge due to jaw deformaties. Man changed the Siamese because THEY
thought it was better. Nature had nothing to do with it. Your argument
regarding declaw makes this WRONG TO DO as well. The basic arguement for
declaw makes spay and neuter wrong in some of the posts I have read.
Understand this...Beauty contestants with breast inhancements and face lifts
make no sense...neither does taking a magnificient breed of cat, capable of
the feats legends proclaim and turning into a spindly little rat...(Sorry to
those who are ok with the man made version of the Siamese...)
I am not referring to natural breed health risks. I am referring to those
which have been man made. If you do not condone declawing that is one
thing...If you are hotly against it to the point of calling it abuse, then I
must conclude that you are right up there with GreenPeace. Fanatics that
only think that CERTAIN acts of their chosing should be outlawed and are
morally wrong. I am sorry, but I am sure that if you backed away from the
passion in your declaw &quot;heat&quot; you would see what I am trying (albeit badly I
admit) to say.
DONT DECLAW UNLESS YOU HAVE GIVEN HONEST EFFORT TO ALL KNOWN ALTERNATIVES.
After that...then do it guilt free...you tried...
Regards
Adreeanna
P.S. Someone did say awhile back that they hoped the group was not gonna
get into another battle over &quot;To declaw or not declaw.&quot; I foolishly thought
that this was no biggee...LOL..Who ever said it...I apologize for dragging
it on, and can assure you that it is now history. Well I concede to J.Coyer
CVT...your wisdom is certainly not something that I can even attempt to
challenge. I admire your thoughtful, and well versed approaches to
debatable issues. I guess I will always remain a Kitty hating cat abuser...

I am truely sorry that I spoke using cliches and examples...I thought I was
dealing with people fully versed in all communication techniques. Did not
realize that this issue was such that by trying to use an example, you can
make up a new topic playing with words. I was patient and sincere in
offering my opinion just as all others offered theirs. I did not ask to be
converted to anyone elses beliefs, and the only thing I am kicking myself
for is being stupid enough to get dragged into a debate over something that
has NO clear cut right and wrong only half baked Urban Legends and

&gt; item, or hurt in some other twisted sick way. When our laws deal the same
&gt; punishment to animal abusers as they do with humans, and make the adoption
&gt; of a cat as hard a adoption of a child, when people finally realize that
&gt; these creatures can feel and have souls...You will see me at the front of
&gt; the line holding the sign that says WE HAVE CURED DECLAWING.....till
&gt; then...welcome to reality 101. Declawing will not stop all hate abuse...but
&gt; if it lowers even by .01 % I am truely happy.

"/> The only obvious connection between de-clawing and hate abuse is that of
equivalence.
Why don't you extend your POV to children? The facts of the case are only
different in that abused/homeless children are fewer in number, so how
can it not make sense WRT them?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Added medical benefits of declawing? Only
&gt;&gt;in rare cases. But there's always the possibility of complications
&gt;&gt;following the surgery. Like needing another surgery to rectify the
&gt;&gt;first that wasn't done properly (happened to a neighbor of mine, at ten
&gt;&gt;years old her cat was having a hard time walking and it turned out his
&gt;&gt;claws were growing back in deformed, needed all four paws redone, almost
&gt;&gt;didn't live throught the recuperation) or extensive bleeding after the
&gt;&gt;procedure (another neighbor's daughter works for a vet and told of a cat
&gt;&gt;being brought in bleeding from the toe mutilation surgery that had been
&gt;&gt;done by another vet, the cat died during the second surgery, stiff price
&gt;&gt;for somebody's furniture, there we go a perfect declaw or die situation,
&gt;&gt;don't you think?) and the stories of cats who no longer use the litter
&gt;&gt;box because the associate the pain in their paws to the litter box,
&gt; did you know that FUS is the leading cause of males refusing to use the
&gt; litter bow...ohh hey...another reason for not using the cat pan...Don't
&gt; imply that all declaws are botched...and dont imply that all bad ltter
&gt; habits are the result of declaw...I am well aware that a bad surgery can
&gt; cause any number of problems...any surgery...not just declaw

"/> Erm... is a rather fundamental point being wilfully ignored by any chance?
Something to do with... *necessity*...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;who develop back problems, cats who begin to bite, cats who become
&gt;&gt;withdrawn, well, I see many reasons there NOT to take the chance. My
&gt;&gt;cats don't use their reproductive parts for anything beyond
&gt;&gt;reproduction. They use their claws for things other than furniture
&gt;&gt;destruction. But see, I'm one of those people that has a comfortable
&gt;&gt;home, I'm not obsessed with perfection. As a matter of fact, we've
&gt;&gt;modified our surroundings for the cats, not our cats for our
&gt;&gt;surroundings.

&gt; I am not obsessed with perfection...would just rather be able to save my
&gt; money for the best vet care I can get rather than pay it out on new
&gt; furniture. Our home is far from perfect. I take in foster cats...and
&gt; unlike foster kids we do not get paid for it...we pay sometimes large
&gt; amounts of money to heal the broken cats we get. I need to keep my
&gt; furniture...such as it is...for as long as possible...

&gt;&gt;I know. I have 19 cats in my home right now, ranging in age from 18 to
&gt;&gt;4 months. All spay/neutered. All but rescued from the streets or a bad
&gt;&gt;situation. All have their claws.

&gt; Sorry I am not rich enough to give proper vet care to 19 cats...We house 4
&gt; at a time...normally we take in cats that people just want to have put down
&gt; because they are too much of a bother...I have been out of the breeding and
&gt; showing game for a number of years...instead use my resourses now to give
&gt; the old ones that more than a few owners would sooner put down than invest
&gt; time in caring for them in their advanced years. That is the real sore spot
&gt; with me...some a simple operation...You want a cause? take that one

"/> Fine but declawing is unnecessary. Sounds like you afford enough to spend
on furniture though.

A word of advice, not a criticism:
if your friends really only want to come round if your furniture
is just right for them (I'm not saying they really do - ask them) then I
mean, well you know... get some different ones ?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;Call me selfish if you will, that's fine, it doesn't bother me, because
&gt;&gt;I KNOW that spaying and neutering an animal serves a much greater
&gt;&gt;purpose than mutilating it's paws. I am not arguing that...all i am saying
&gt; is that it is still a mutilation...highly visible on a male...

&gt;&gt;And, I for one, look forward to the day, when cats are at such a premium
&gt;&gt;that a home that would declaw, will be without a cat.
&gt; I look forward to the day that mankind once again appreciates that we are
&gt; each entitled to our opinions with out being verbally shot for it.

"/> All right, calm...
You take comments personally which specifically relate to your
actions/attitude not to yourself because you cannot yet bring yourself to
face the crisis of whether to abandon those attitudes. It's a good sign
which makes for a positive outcome eventually.
As to implicit culpability (which has clearly been communicated so well),
this relates not to ignorance (&quot;opinions&quot;) but to actions proceeding from
them.

I totally agree with everything you say! If people didn't love their cats -
they wouldn't be on this NG to talk about them! I don't think cats should
be declawed either, but I wouldn't say that those who do it are &quot;abusing&quot;
their cats.

People who declaw are not &quot;rectal orifices.&quot; I got a cat recently after 25
years without pets. My family didn't even treat our cats and dogs back then
the way we do now. In retrospect, it's a wonder they weren't all neurotic.
I was just plain unaware of cat psychology and their needs. When I got this
new indoor cat, my vet and my neighbors urged me to get it declawed. The
only reason I had *not* to was that the wonderful woman who placed this
feral cat with me gave me Desmond Morris' 20 year old book on cats. In it,
he strongly advised not to declaw. I think a lot of well-intentioned people
like me simply don't have good information. And I haven't met a vet yet who
stated opposition to declawing when he had a paying customer in his face.
Have you ever thought about their overhead? I can't find a holistic vet in
Indianapolis who's not pill happy, but that's another discussion.

Get this, my vet tried to combine declawing with the spay by saying that he
wasn't cutting off the whole digit to the knuckle, just removing the nail
bed. He showed me on my own hand how I would still have fingertips and
normal finger length. But I just couldn't say yes to declawing because it
sounded painful, and I thought of Desmond Morris' argument against it, and I
thought of the cat's future... What if I was in a car accident and no one
else would be as committed to her care and keep her protected? What if she
got away -- how could she climb out of harm's way or swipe out at an
offending nose without claws? I loved this cat already and I would go nuts
worrying if I didn't know her status.

Besides the fact that I'm cheap, I didn't feel convinced that declawing was
necessary like shots and spaying. But these treatments get rolled into one
group and presented that way to the uninformed pet owner. I was lucky to
read Morris' book, because by the time I started reading these postings, it
would have been too late. I would have felt terrible about declawing my
cat, but it would have been too late. And my personal hunch is that my cat
would have been damaged emotionally. I don't want to pass judgement on
anyone else.

Most people who care enough to invest time learning about their animals and
asking questions on these newsgroups are *good* people. Those New Yorkers
who rent dogs to go with their clothes, or the drug dealers who buy lion
cubs to &quot;guard&quot; the crack house aren't likely to even suspect the animal has
needs beyond food and shelter, let alone sit down to learn anything here.

That's why I have been sorely disappointed by the hateful attacks on others
over this declawing issue. What that does is make it unsafe to ask
questions or explain positions. And that has a negative effect on the
impact of the anti-declawers. How many times have I read that someone is
blocking &quot;claw&quot; and &quot;declaw&quot; and accusing others of sneaky tactics by the
discussion on &quot;cute things cats do with their claws.&quot; Those of you who are
rudely passionate against declawing alienate cat owners instead of teaching
them. A kinder approach would certainly save a lot more cats from
declawing. I am pleading for more empathy and less judgement. Try to
understand what the other person was thinking and help them see how they
might be able to do it differently next time. You know, if a cat was as
aggressive as some of you, this very same newsgroup would be advising the
cat be neutered or spayed to mellow it out a bit. What would an animal
behaviorist say -- you were abused? Human beings have to manage anger.
Care about the cat owners. I commend you for caring so much about cats.
I'm a renewed convert to how important it is to share life with animals.

&gt;&gt; I don't think you really need to make so much of the fact
&gt;&gt; that Melissa mentioned she is blind. It is a simple fact
&gt;&gt; of her life.... there's no point is assigning some
&gt;&gt; nefarious intent to it.

&gt;The only reason people are latching on to that is that it was Melissa
&gt;herself who made it a primary issue by saying it was one of the two main
&gt;reasons she declawed her cats: &quot;Why did I have them declawed you might
&gt;ask. Two main reasons. #1: I am
&gt;blind...&quot; If she hadn't cited it as the reason, I'm sure nobody would have
&gt;thought
&gt;it was relevant.

&gt;&gt; I perfer to assume that people who declaw cats are
&gt;&gt; simply ignorant and/or victims of bad counsel,
&gt;&gt; rather than &quot;assholes,&quot; until shown otherwise.

&gt;It's a nice thought, but on past experience, &quot;assholes&quot; wins out.

I have to say, I whole-heartedly second this. There shouldn't be a need to
resort to name-calling. It's good to remember while you may not convince the
person you disagree with (Honestly, how many times does that occur ever?), you
might convince the lurker just passing through. And most assuredly they will
be more convinced by a polite, constructive post, than one done in hate and
anger.

Don't bother...I will debate...I will not get dragged into a fanatical flame
over a simple surgical procedure that has such heated opinions. Whether you
believe my credentials or not is hardly the issue..Stay on topic. i was
using the phrases as rhetoric...surely you grasp that concept..if not...ohhh
well...i am sure that no matter what anyone says...you will stick by your
views...and well you should for I am not here to change anyones view...but
to have the basic right to express my own.

If that is your opinion...If you feel you are qualified to state my declaw
reasons that is your right. I will debate any issue, I will not get drawn
into petty name calling...and all that needs to be said on the subject has
already been said. i understand your views and opinions. They are however

that will over the long term do nothing to better the lives of domestic or

&gt;&gt; You know, I find the persons responses to the individual that &quot;had&quot; to
&gt;&gt; declaw their cat and example of what is wrong with our society today.

&gt;Really? That's funny, because we find those who abuse their cats and
&gt;those - like you - who defend them, the despicable people who drag our
&gt;society down.

&gt;&gt; This person that declawed their cat first of all is writing voluntarily,
in
&gt;&gt; a cat lovers forum to share an experience.

&gt;Bit bloody silly to start with, wouldn't you say, considering she's come
&gt;to a cat lovers forum to tell us that she's deliberately maimed her
&gt;cats? Did you seriously think she was likely to get a round of
&gt;applause?

&gt;&gt; This person obviously cares about their cats.

&gt;This person quite obviously has no idea of the meaning of the word
&gt;love, and neither have you if you can apply it to someone who
&gt;perpetrates abuse.

&gt;&gt; However, due to some inability on the cats parts or the
&gt;&gt; owners lifestyle (no criticism meant here, most of us don't
&gt;&gt; have 24 hours a day to devote to our pets) the cat
&gt;&gt; was felt to be destructive.

&gt;The inability was entirely on the part of the ignorant owner. By
&gt;amptutating the cat's toes she demonstrates her total inadequacy and
&gt;inability to care for another living creature. She is not fit to own a
&gt;cat.

&gt;&gt; I agree, in many ways declawing is barbaric. However, putting cats in a
&gt;&gt; shelter due to their destructive tendencies is even more so.

&gt;Abuse is abuse, there are no degrees. No owner with an ounce of sense,
&gt;ability or love would ever consider either declawing or dumping a cat.
&gt;To use such lack of personal ability to justify abusing a cat is
&gt;unforgiveable.

&gt;&gt; resort to that than I care to think. Or the tried and true, drop it off
in
&gt;&gt; farm country, it will take care of itself method. Is this better?

&gt;You suggest that abuse can be put in order of scale? Do you think one
&gt;form of abuse is less disgusting than another?

&gt;&gt; This declawer is no barbarian.

&gt;The declawer is a loathsome and utterly barbaric individual who cares
&gt;for nothing but their own selfish and lazy wants.

&gt;&gt; They are a person that is integrating a pet into a home.

&gt;They are most certainly NOT integrating a pet into a home. They are
&gt;subjecting the pet to the most horrifying procedure precisely because
&gt;they are too stupid to be able to integrate it into the home.

&gt;&gt; Believe me, by six months old you have an idea if your pet is
&gt;&gt; a destructive type or not.

&gt;Believe me, the fact that someone is so mentally challenged that they
&gt;can't perform a perfectly simple function which millions of people the
&gt;world over perform without any trouble at all, does not mean the cat is
&gt;&quot;a destructive type&quot;. It means the owner is a moron. (I know, I always
&gt;said I'd never call anyone a moron, but I'm tired of being polite.)

&gt;Anyone with an iota of intelligence can train a cat.

&gt;&gt; This person that attacked another in this diatribe,
&gt;&gt; should work more on their relationship with people,

&gt;My relationships with decent and honourable people are just fine thank
&gt;you, don't you worry your little head about that. It's making any
&gt;concession to having a &quot;relationship&quot; with the bastards who declaw that
&gt;I will not even consider. I respect people who earn it, and animal
&gt;abusers are the lowest form of life - and I don't mean just human life.
&gt;The amoeba has more humanity and intelligence than they.

&gt;&gt; It may be my bias but this person who attacked may have
&gt;&gt; more time in their life than this other person to dedicate
&gt;&gt; to their cats. Not all of us do.

&gt;If you have so little time in your life that you can't perform the
&gt;perfectly easy task of training a cat not to scratch, then you shouldn't
&gt;have a cat, because you obviously don't have any time at all.

&gt;&gt; If only the people that could dedicate all the time in the
&gt;&gt; world to their pets had them, there would be many more in
&gt;&gt; the shelters and that would only do a disservice to the pets.

&gt;What is it with you that you think you need &quot;all the time in the world&quot;
&gt;to train a cat? All it takes is a little intelligence and application.
&gt;Millions of us do it all the time, it's only certain North Americans who
&gt;are incapable.

&gt;&gt; Maybe we should work on the veterinarians on
&gt;&gt; developing a better method of minimizing the
&gt;&gt; effect of a cats claws.

&gt;You really don't have any idea how to care for cats do you? And why do
&gt;so many people like you think that only vets can handle their cats? If
&gt;your relationship with your cat really is so bad that you have to rely
&gt;on someone else to look after it for you then you should rehome it with
&gt;someone who *does* understand its nature.

&gt;There is absolutely no need to involve vets, it's easy enough to do it
&gt;yourself. All you have to do is clip the claws regularly.

&gt;&gt; Think about it. The people that abuse their pets don't take
&gt;&gt; the time and money to have their pets declawed they just toss
&gt;&gt; that one out and get another...

&gt;The people that abuse their pets are those who cut their toes off
&gt;because they consider their sofa to be of more importance than a living
&gt;being. They are worse than those who toss the animals out because they
&gt;attempt to hide behind a facade of &quot;love&quot;. At least those who toss the
&gt;cats out don't make any pretence at caring. Those who declaw are total
&gt;hypocrites.

&gt;&gt; It may not be the way to care for a pet in your definition, but
&gt;&gt; it is better than many get.

&gt;That you would try to justify the mutilation of a living creature by
&gt;claiming that others are abused in worst ways is disgusting. You cannot
&gt;quantify abuse. *All* abuse is completely unacceptable to moral people
&gt;in a civilised society.

leash laws. You mentioned federal law superseding state
law. Rather, there are federal offenses and state offenses;
technically, you can get tried for both if they overlap, but
often they don't. For instance, there is no federal law
against murder. Murderers are tried by the state and
sentenced to state rather than federal penitentiaries.
Interstate offenses usually get tried by the feds. Only on
a few issues do federal laws actually supersede state laws;
abortion rights and laws against segregation spring to
mind. These are issues that have been ruled upon by the US
Supreme Court. At least, this is the way I understand the

Love hmmm that's all about interpretation.
I love the colour of my living room but next year it'll have to go....

In Europe declawing IS abuse and I DO call it abuse... so do all the
animal welfare organisations I know off and many US vets too
incidentally!

If someone comes asking for information they usually (hmmm checking
back on recent threads exchange usually for always) get it...

In human interaction there are disagreements, people have different
ways of expressing their opinions and this media lends itself to
mis-interpretation especially when strong feelings are involved.

In the instances when it drops to a personal level and the insults fly
it takes at least 2. Then the thread loses the point anyway and
degrades into who said what, why, when usually the poster of the
original 'question' is long gone by then. And it's changed from a
question to a debate!

This has been going on since.....da de dah de dah the ng's are still
here people are still asking questions still getting answers still
arguing... that's life.

If you want to see real venom try a political newsgroup :) makes this
look like the brotherhood/sisterhood of good manners.

requires people to abuse and kill animals in order to become

people who can stomach that sort of thing for the greater good,
some who are indifferent to it, and at least a few who actively

I am sorry. Again, I can not agree. As much as you believe that it is not
abuse, people like me believe it is. I view this abuse the same as any other
abuse, and I don't ignore it just because it is a cat and not a human being.

That is where my big problem is.. I don't care that it is JUST an animal.
It is a living soul that cries when it is hurt and eats when it is hungry.
It acts excited when it is happy and sleeps when it is tired.

I can't just read these posts and say &quot;HEY! that person really tried not to
abuse their animal, but they were at the last straw, so I don't blame them&quot;
because I do. I read these threads because I want to.. because I have an
opinion that I am GOING to voice. Sorry. You can make your own moderated
newsgroup where you can moderate who posts and what they post..

And why are people so SCARED? Is it because they are afraid of a few harsh
words? Thats silly.. because if they believed so much in what they were
doing, then they should not have a problem defending it, if they decide to
jump in the thread.

I *choose* to post, and I get flamed all the time.. because people have their
own opinions that are not like mine. That does not make me go away, but if
it ever go to me so bad (which it wouldn't, but if it did) I would simply
stay out of it.

If you don't like the thread, why do you read it? There are many other
subjects posted in this newsgroup and you can start your own threads. You
people who are so compleled to read the declaw threads and simply cant avoid
them should get a news filter..

I am sorry to say, but these threads, I am sure, will not be going anywhere
soon.

18 to

Well, we're not rich. Not by any means. But our vet is a wonderful
man,
who we've been taking our animals to for over ten years now. I'm in
their office at least two-three times a month. I've spent over $500
there in the last four weeks. We get a fair sized discount and he
also
can work out a payment schedule with us, if need be. We've never had

hon, no one will ever convince me that owner convenience toe
amputation
is a good thing. I certainly understand that some people are so
convinced that a cat with claws is a bother that the only way the cat
can have a home with them is by having said claws removed. This
sickens
me and I have very, very strong feelings about people that do such
things. They disgust me, to be honest. I feel sorry for them, that
they
feel they have no choice, but to mutilate their cat. But at least the
cat has some chance at a home. Which, I know is better than life in
a
shelter or on a street.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;And, I for one, look forward to the day, when cats are at such a
premium

Well, I've got strong opinons about declawing and have voiced them on here
in the past. It's something I really hate and see no justification for at
all.

I've been flamed for it but it doesn't stop me having my views and things
have got heated during the debate. Most people on this NG are OK and really
love cats. I post to other NGs where the flaming and insults are way over
the top and I don't like it, especially when someone has a go at me for
posting a message that's in no way abusive but they resort to insults just
for disagreeing with their POV.

As far as I'm concerned a person who declaws their cat is cruel and can't be
bothered to use other methods, which may be time consuming, to sort out the
problem. So I think declawing is a cop out.

There are three types of people I dislike in this world, perverts,
mysoginists and those who are cruel to animals. I won't aplogise for having
a go at them because IMO they have no arguement to justify their views and
their opinons mean nothing to me. It doesn't matter how long you take you
try and reason with them, they don't see it.

Sometimes though resorting to abuse seems to be the only basic language
these people understand an intellectual discussion is a waste of time
becasue they just can't grasp what you're on about. Of course, I'm referring
to other NGs rather than this one where usually a discussion does happen,
though at times I do get angry when someone tries to justify pulling a cats
claws out. I don't use courtesy because I don't like their methods and in
real life i wouldn't spit on this people if they were on fire. That's the
way I feel and I won't change it.

Exactly my point they can and they will... and if you read through the
posts in this and other ng's you will find 'rudeness' (however you
define that) on both sides of any disagreement on every subject
posters disagree on... not just declawing....

And that's the reality.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well here in Brit-land you'll find that we would tell you that someone

Don't forget that although many of us disagree on this particular issue, we
can find things to discuss on other issues. I wish people would not just
judge every person in here on their declaing views.

This issue in particular is very nasty.. (before you all start jumping down my
throat, I mean on BOTH SIDES). But IMNSHO, animal abuse is nasty.. and it is
hard to keep a poker face about it, although sometimes, depending on who is
raging on me, I can.

This is why I encourage people not to get into the discussion if you have
heart conditions, high blood pressure, pregnant or nursing a child, etc. :)

Not even *I* can handle the heat in the alt.religion newsgroups..

Especially, depending on the religion.. you will actually have people leave
the newsgroup and come visit you at your home to show you their opinion! So
far at least these debates have stayed within the virtual walls of the

&gt;&gt;Well, I think quite a lot of British cat-lovers would certainly wonder *why*
&gt;&gt;anyone would declaw a cat, but most wouldn't really think about it unless it
&gt;&gt;was brought up. It isn't something we think about because it isn't an
&gt;&gt;option. It's illegal.

&gt;It's not illegal in the UK. Against the policy opf the veterinary

Hey, everyone!

We have always had a really nice NG here. We have enjoyed stories from other
people's katkid experiences and shared that joys and yucky stuff (litter boxes
and hairballs). I, for one, enjoy the break from a stressful job.
Y'all can flame me if you want, it doesn't matter. I, and another few
thousand subscribers, would prefer that infighting be taken to a private chat
room, or individual e-mail fight. I don't mind debate, honestly, but declawing is
an issue sort of like gun control, religion or abortion.
If someone wants to fight about the subject, that's fine. The problem is that
it isn't possible to change someone else's POV in this manner.
Please, everyone, can we take the debates to a private forum????
Thanks,
Nancy (missing mamakitty, still)

I've been out of the group for a while. Someone just forwarded your
email about this subject to me yesterday. I sent you some pages
relating to California cruelty laws from the book on the nationwide
subject that I compiled last year. I sent it to your work address, as

"/> No. But then, it won't be a question of precedence if it's more
descriptive, or inclusive, than what the state, or federal government,

has put in place.

For example: If the state of Oceana has a law that says that
'dangerous dogs must be leashed', if the city of Pollyannaville
decides to make a law that says that ALL dogs must be leashed, it's
not in conflict

If, however, the city wanted to make a law that said 'dangerous dogs
don't need to be leashed', that would be in conflict.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If I read the California law correctly,
&gt;you only need to leash &quot;dangerous&quot; dogs, but I know that there are
&gt;leash laws at the parks, so I am a bit confused.

"/> I'm not familiar with California leash laws, but I doubt that it
states 'ONLY dangerous dogs'... but more likely, the state has only
included dangerous dogs. If a municipality decides to include more
dogs, that would be allowed, and is likely what is happening at your
local parks.

Perhaps in some other areas, the leashes aren't required of all dogs
at the park.

For my home area, the laws for cats are pretty descriptive.

You are only allowed three cats per household (This is seldom
enforced. Only a person who has an unclean home needs to worry about
this usually). Cats outside must be on a leash.

I have two sets of collars and leashes for my two cats... but I don't
think I will be using them. I tried it with one cat, but he didn't
like it. For my cats, the happy medium has been to keep them indoors
only.

While these laws may seem unfair, or strange, the number of stray cats
is minimal. I've been here ten years, and only seen one cat the victim
of a car, and that was a kitten. Probably from the litter of a stray
cat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, I think quite a lot of British cat-lovers would certainly wonder *why*

&gt;&gt;It's not illegal in the UK. Against the policy opf the veterinary

&gt; how odd! my husband, a UK citizen, tells me that it IS indeed illegal
&gt; - under the *cruelty* to animals act

"/> This is really microscopic hair-splitting.

Yes, declawing is forbidden by UK veterinary regulation; any UK
vet who amputated a cat's claw without a solid medical reason to
do so (e.g., infection or severe injury to the claw) would lose
his or her license to practice veterinary medicine. No,
declawing is not specifically mentioned in UK animal cruelty
statutes. However, a UK vet who amputated a cat's claws absent
medical necessity could be prosecuted under UK animal cruelty
laws in addition to losing his or her license; I believe this
has happened in one case.

OLC already knows all this, by the way, because he's been told
so several times. You can draw your own conclusions about him
in light of that. Personally, I've come to think it's best to
ignore him most of the time.

I always wonder why it is ok to respond so insultingly to people who do not
share your point of view when you talk on newsgroups. Being polite doesn't
become obsolete on newsgroups, does it?

My cats are all declawed and they still hunt and catch prizes and they are
very very happy and balanced cats.
He Lisa, don't you think the story of your amputated cat is a real horror
story? Now that's real case of amputation, right?
My cats are in very good health. I don't spend all my time and money on my
cats, i have other activities in life.
My cats are healthy and so are my dogs and my kid and they're all equal
members of the family. I would'nt like to open a pet hospital in my home. If
i had wished for that, i would have become a vet.

Leave people be.
If people want their cats declawed, it's their affair ok?

And by the way, are all your cats spayed/neutered? If not, i wonder what it
smells like in your house.

Yeah, you might have noticed i visited your site lisa.

I also question your honesty: Ciara is your latest catch and you made sure
to tell your neighbour not to tell where the cat was. Of course, you reason
that her previous owners were not taking good care of her, very noble
indeed. Didn't it pass thru your mind that the cat might have gotten lost?
How come you only became interested in adopting that cat when the little
girl gave you the description, especially the blue eyes?

I criticize you just like you criticize people for having their cats
declawed, it's none of your business, just like your life is none of my
business. Taste your own medicine.

&gt; I always wonder why it is ok to respond so insultingly to people who do not

&gt; My cats are all declawed and they still hunt and catch prizes and they are
&gt; very very happy and balanced cats.
&gt; He Lisa, don't you think the story of your amputated cat is a real horror
&gt; story? Now that's real case of amputation, right?

"/> Yes, it is a real horror. I don't deny that. And I can make the point
that Bobby no longer jumps on counters, can't I? I can say that he's
made my life so much more *convenient* can't I? Because, after all, it
*is* true. But, the major difference between what was done to Bobby and
what you have done to your cats, is that amputating Bobby's leg
literally SAVED HIS LIFE. He had gangrene in his leg, which would have
gone into his system and killed him. Now, if you had your cats' claws
amputated for the same sort of reason, hey, I agree. You had no other
choice.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My cats are in very good health. I don't spend all my time and money on my

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> Once again, good for you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> Because you say so? Oh, yes, I really value your opinion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If people want their cats declawed, it's their affair ok?

"/> If I can change minds by educating people about what declawing is, I'm
gonna do it. If you have a problem with that, then, Valerie, sweetie,
that's your problem, not mine. If people come here saying &quot;my cat's
okay, I love my cat more than ever, I think cats without claws are the
greatest thing since sliced bread&quot;, well, yes, I'm going to say
something.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And by the way, are all your cats spayed/neutered? If not, i wonder what it
&gt; smells like in your house.

"/> Oh, my, and you say you've read my website? The answer can be found
there. Oh, and you mention further down that my life is none of your
business. Let's please be consistent. Thank you. :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Yeah, you might have noticed i visited your site lisa.

"/> Oh, gee, I'm so excited!!!! *grins* Did you read every single page?
All of my diary? It's been going since the January 97. And did you
read the tributes to the rainbow angels and the comeback kitties and how
you can help abused animals and the free speech page and play games in
ben's den? and read his adventures? Did you like the &quot;amazing kitty
story&quot; about a blind cat that chased off a robber? That's a great
story. And Tally's Tales are excellent, too. Didn't you just love
them? Did you see any cats in the catcam chair? Did you send a friend
a postcard? It's a really big site, isn't it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I also question your honesty: Ciara is your latest catch and you made sure
&gt; to tell your neighbour not to tell where the cat was. Of course, you reason
&gt; that her previous owners were not taking good care of her, very noble
&gt; indeed. Didn't it pass thru your mind that the cat might have gotten lost?
&gt; How come you only became interested in adopting that cat when the little
&gt; girl gave you the description, especially the blue eyes?

"/> I'll be honest. I wouldn't have gone down there if it *hadn't* been
for the blue eyes. And I don't feel a bit guilty about it, either.
There are at least three ferals that I'm in the process of taming, to
bring into our home, along with the other 18 rescued cats that live
here. I had no intention of getting another kitten. If I hadn't taken
Ciara, the people who's doorstep she was left on would have. And believe
me, if anybody had said anything to the people, they would have said
something to me.

Gotten lost? We have coyotes in this neighborhood (oh, I guess you
didn't read that part of the diary, did you?). We have morons that
believe 25mph is the minimum speed limit. Had Ciara been *lost*, Ciara
would have been *dead*. The coyotes see the white cats more easily than
the dark ones. She would have been breakfast or dinner. The only cats
that survive here at night are the ferals that are wise. And none of
them are white.

And I have been checking the lost ads in the paper every morning,
religiously since I've found her. Even went back a week, just in case.
No lost kittens. I've been checking all of the telephone poles for
*lost cat* signs. The only one I've seen is for an adult tortie. My vet
hasn't had any questions about lost kittens, either and he's the local
vet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I criticize you just like you criticize people for having their cats
&gt; declawed, it's none of your business, just like your life is none of my
&gt; business. Taste your own medicine.

"/> Well, Val, it certainly appears as if you have taken it upon yourself to
make it your business, doesn't it? And that's okay, because I've posted
my life for people to see. You don't like it? Oh, well. I guess that
means you won't be paying the mortgage anymore? Or the utilities? Oh,
wait a minute. You've never sent me any money, have you?

Guess I'll have to cross you off of my Christmas list. *sigh*

Oh, one more thing. This is Usenet. It's an open forum. If someone
wishes to keep their life private and not have it commented on, the best
thing to do is to keep it private. Which means not posting about it
here on Usenet. Now, doesn't that make sense to you? Putting something
up where millions of people will see it, doesn't make much sense if you
don't want comments.

i beg to differ. there are various sayings that would apply here -
unfortunately, the only one i can think of right now is

EVIL THRIVES WHILE GOOD MEN DO NOTHING!!

i make it my business, as we ALL should, when there is mistreatment.
whether the mistreater is aware of it or not! it IS your right to your
own opinion, but it is OUR right to ours as well! and the plain and
simple truth is declawing isn't the simple task that many newbies
think it is --- almost like clipping the claws severely or something
--- it IS MUTILATION.

PERIOD! if you're honest with yourself, it really doesn't matter WHY
you do it, it IS mutilation.

it seems we humans STILL haven't reached an evolutionary plain where
we can admit even to ourselves that we have a dark side, where things
hide that we don't often like to pull out and take a good look at.

&gt; i make it my business, as we ALL should, when there is mistreatment.
&gt; whether the mistreater is aware of it or not! it IS your right to your

&gt; simple truth is declawing isn't the simple task that many newbies
&gt; think it is --- almost like clipping the claws severely or something
&gt; --- it IS MUTILATION.

&gt; PERIOD! if you're honest with yourself, it really doesn't matter WHY
&gt; you do it, it IS mutilation.

&gt; it seems we humans STILL haven't reached an evolutionary plain where

bothered me. I would think that if you believe your point so valid you
could find some way of illustrating it without having to resort to insulting
someone with an opposing opinion - never mind making offensive
generalizations about an entire religion.

Speaking for myself, when someone tries to make a point by tossing around
what basically amounts to petty insults that have little or nothing to do
with the actual topic, I tend to get so appalled by the inanity and
childishness of it that I completely lose interest in whatever point they're
trying to make. Which I suppose wouldn't be an issue to you if you were
just trying to be insolent, but if you're actually trying to persuade people
to see your side of things... (and no, I'm not pretending to understand your
motivations, I'm just trying to make a point of my own) maybe there's a
better way to go about it.

I wasn't trying to be insulting or win people over to my
view. I was asking because I couldn't believe it. The
Wiccans I have known have had a profound respect for animals
as teachers and companions/equals. They just wouldn't do
something like that. I find it hard to believe this person
is really a Wiccan. And I don't see how anything I said
insulted Wiccans at all. Quite the contrary.

Hi Adreeanna,

Please give up on PD. Just ignore her. I remember this declawing argument
from last summer. I remember when PD was being her usual obnoxious self.
Someone worked her into a corner in which she admitted that she has no
objection to human slavery. PD is the ultimate hypocrite, so I suggest
that you put her name in your &quot;ignore&quot; file so that you don't see her
posts. Maybe, then, we can have a civil and rational discussion on this
issue.

Better still start a moderated ng where only people with the same
opinions as you post.

All this is being dragged on and on complaining about personal attacks
and continuing them at the same time. You could email each other to
bitch about PD then maybe the personal stuff might drop in here.
Dragging up something someone said a year ago out of context....

What is the point in fanning the flames...

Seems to me you're trying to bait PD into a reaction.

If you don't like PD's style or anything else she says then filter her
out or whatever.

We each decide for ourself what is rational and civil or hypocritical
or obnoxious for that matter.

It enables people with weak arguments to escape having to
stay on the subject. In the case of claw amputation, the
arguments in favor are very week indeed, so you're going to
see a lot of complaints about the etiquette of those
opposed to it and lengthy searches of DejaNews to find bits
to take out of context.

I see that there were several other replies to this. I'm inclined to agree
with Ystybtatr. If your purpose of being part of this newsgroup is to use it as
a soapbox to express your opinions, then absolutely feel free. If you're here
to share ideas, knowledge, and stories, feel free. If someone annoys you with
their opinions and manner, IGNORE THEM! Filter out their posts. Before you
get drawn in to a flame war, go look at DejaNews. Many times you'll see that
its a case of &quot;Same crap, different day.&quot; and you'll see the futility of
continuing correspondence with that person (and that persons fans). You'll also
see that, more often than not, these flame wars usually degrade into personal
insults and bickering.

Some people will they'll you &quot;If you don't like this group, start your own
moderated group.&quot; or &quot;Join rec.pets.cats.community(or whatever group they think
will suit you). They will be more to your liking.&quot; The thing is, if you look at
the posts in this group you'll see all kinds of different posts. Some people
want to argue, some ask questions, some just share stories. There is room for
all of us!

personal attack.

A moderated newsgroup is the only way to make sure you don't have to
listen to opposing opinions/views/experiences/subjects. And maybe the
best option for those who can't handle debate and discussion.

But fanning the flames of personal attacks under any 'supposed'

it continues to the detrement of any type of discussion.

I don't want a newsgroup where only people with the same opinions are
allowed.

I would like to be able to participate in a discussion where people who
disagree with the prevailing wisdom aren't treated rudely.

And I haven't stated my position the declaw issue. You don't know whether
I'm for it or against it. It is very presumptuous to assume my position on
this issue just because I don't like rude people.

I was not presuming anything about your position on declaw or anything
else.

No position on anything was in the post I responded to.

I responded to the fact there is no subject being discussed here at
all as far as I can see. Just personalities.

And posting something someone said from 'last summer' out of context
and describing them as hypocritical inferring lack of civility and
rationality is merely continuing the atmosphere that creates hostility
and which has been the subject of many other posts.

I may have misunderstood the post but it seemed to me like just when
the personal attack mode was winding down... you were baiting for a
reaction from PD.

We all know what filters etc are I'm sure adreeana knows about them
and your message to her might have been better sent by email rather
than publicly. Once posted publicly however, it invites comment.

So I commented.. no presumptions just on the text of the post.

I'm a little perplexed here: whenever I've had stitches removed, after oral
surgery, it does not hurt, at all. Why would it hurt to have the stitches
removed, if they're being removed at the proper post-surgical time? (Is it
possible that the cat was being very vocal because it did not like being
handled? My cats have never been great fans of *any* procedures done at the
vets. Cathy

I have had sutures removed a few times, and the ones most painful were that

Many times, sutures are completely pain free when removed, but it depends on
what type of suture material was used, what type of stitching technique and
the area of the incision.
Lastly, I am very puzzled as to why any doctor would use sutures to close a
declaw. Though I hate the procedure myself, it is understood throughout most

infection...it angers me that this thoughtless doctor used sutures in the

Maybe some vets use stitches in declaw surgery because the glue doesn't
hold. Declawing surgery is so painful for some cats that they tear off
their foot bandages and the vet techs find them bleeding in their cages the
next morning. That's exactly what the vet tech said on Lisaviolet's webpage
with several educational perspectives on this procedure. Personally, I've
had stitches pulled out of my toes that made my eyes sting with tears. I
can give some credibility to a cat yowling in pain. And I think it might
have some impact if more of us spoke with our pocketbooks, like the original
poster considered doing, and patronized vets who refuse to do this procedure
(at least except in rare circumstances). I need to talk to my vet myself.

Yeah.. I got a tattoo on my chin below my kneee when I was just out of high
school that did not hurt a bit.

Then I got a tattoo around my ankle like a bracelet, and once I got to the
back, all the nerves and tendens started sceaming.. They could not even
finish it, because it hurt so bad.. it is all broken up in the back because I
could not keep my leg still..

There are definantly parts of your body that hurt worse than others.. kind of
like how it does not really hurt when you yank a handful of hair, but if you
just pull out one, it stings :)

"/> Keep in mind the procedure that was performed on their toes not too long
before. Don't assume that the pain is simply the stitches themselves; I would
think that handling a recently declawed toe would be *extremely* painful.

BTW, do most American clinics use stitches? Suture glue is much less invasive
(the lesser of two evils, you could say).

Actually, either place would be a stupid place for it.. as I got older and
got a respectable job- I had to start dressing conservatively to work, skirts
etc.

I had to wear tights instead of nylons during the summer (110o california
weather) so people would not see a big pirate skull and crossbones smoking a
joint with the words &quot;THE KID&quot; underneith them.. lol

&gt;Maybe some vets use stitches in declaw surgery because the glue doesn't

webpage
&gt;with several educational perspectives on this procedure. Personally, I've

"/> Surgical glue works much better on declaws than sutures. It holds very well,
however, because of the severity of the surgery, bleeding occurs equally
whether the DVM uses sutures or glue- there really isn't too much of a
difference. And believe me, I think that ripping the sutures out compared to
trying to tear apart the glued areas would be much easier for a cat to do.
They much be watched carefully. I have seen many a time, a cat rip their
sutures out right after a spay and it is very yucky :(. Anyhoo, I hate this
damn surgery, so personally I wouldn't like to see it performed. However, if
it is, at least they could use surgical glue and minimize infection and
pain, which is very important...

that
&gt; if they should ever go off, the alarm company will immediately call my local

&gt; the house may be on fire and there is a family cat in the house. I couldn't
&gt; give a damn about furniture, getting my cat to safety is my only priority.

"/> Here's a real one: Last year I had let a stray cat into the office to have
her kittens. 5 days after she did on 2/6/98, the office was destroyed by a
fire started by a water cooler in the office next door. I went in and
rescued the cat and kittens, but we lost everything else in the process. The
rescue made the front page of a couple newspapers then, but everybody was
laid off 8 days before Christmas except one Vo-Tech/Rehab guy and myself.

We've been getting lied to and stonewalled by the companies responsible(Oasis

While they're passing the buck amongst one another, we're going out of

owe us anything are the ones who destroyed our business and our jobs. I've
already sent back several unsolicited checks and will continue to do so.
Please, don't waste two stamps! If you want to help, please let me know and

&gt;&gt;&gt;No, I can believe that. Sadly countless people tell us that all the

&gt;&gt;&gt;claims that by declawing, the cat keeps its home. What declawing
&gt;&gt;&gt;clearly does is keep the cat in its home for a little longer, until it
&gt;&gt;&gt;provides its owner with a second problem that the owner is too
&gt;&gt;&gt;inadequate to deal with and that can't be fixed by an unethical vet or
&gt;&gt;&gt;by throwing money at someone else for a quick fix.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that he was the guide's favorite, or maybe the guide
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thought that the chances of him getting adopted were slim...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he had one day left before getting put to sleep.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep, despite this all-powerful panacea that the pro-declawers claim
&gt;&gt;&gt;declawing to be. The poor creatures are maimed and mutilated by people
&gt;&gt;&gt;who claim to love them, and then get dumped and killed anyway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sorry that I did not explain myself better.

&gt;&gt;&gt;No problem, I'm sure we all understand where you're coming from now. My
&gt;&gt;&gt;exasperated reaction is based on the fact that I am absolutely sick to
&gt;&gt;&gt;death of pig-ignorant people coming here and justifying the abuse of
&gt;&gt;&gt;cats by perpetrating the myth that they must be declawed because
&gt;&gt;&gt;otherwise the owners will be savaged, their children will be scarred
&gt;&gt;&gt;for life and their houses will be destroyed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have read up on cats who are declawed and I know the drawbacks.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe people will think about them before they go and have their cat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; declawed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Sadly, experience shows that most people won't.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You have to think about the cat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You and I, and a select few on these NGs, think you have to think about
&gt;&gt;&gt;the cat. Millions of your fellow countrymen think that you have to
&gt;&gt;&gt;think about your inanimate objects before you think about the cat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Moo-Moo has not had any problems with the litterbox...which I have
&gt;heard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that some cats do after being declawed. His ballance is fine...and he
&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no problem with us touching his feet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm very glad your cat is okay, but as you say, there are plenty of
&gt;&gt;&gt;people who will testify that their cats are not.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that everyone has a right to their own opinion. Wether or not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people want to declaw or not declaw is up to them. If we get a law
&gt;&gt; passed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is against declawing that is Okay with me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, everyone has a right to their opinion, but there is a big
&gt;&gt;&gt;difference between believing something to be acceptable and in it
&gt;&gt;&gt;actually being morally or ethically acceptable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Paedophiles are of the opinion that sex with children is acceptable.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Does that make it so? Hitler believed that murdering six million Jews
&gt;&gt;&gt;was acceptable - and that was also legal. Did that make it morally or
&gt;&gt;&gt;ethically acceptable?

It's illegal under EU regulations

Article 10

I guess there you could say there are a handful of members of the EU.

In addition:
Australia
New Zeland
Brazil
Austria
Norway
Switzerland

Add to that the fact there is not a single animal welfare group in the
US that supports it.

I wonder what you term 'modern'

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sorry that I did not explain myself better.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No problem, I'm sure we all understand where you're coming from now. My
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;exasperated reaction is based on the fact that I am absolutely sick to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;death of pig-ignorant people coming here and justifying the abuse of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cats by perpetrating the myth that they must be declawed because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;otherwise the owners will be savaged, their children will be scarred
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for life and their houses will be destroyed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have read up on cats who are declawed and I know the drawbacks.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe people will think about them before they go and have their cat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; declawed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sadly, experience shows that most people won't.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You have to think about the cat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You and I, and a select few on these NGs, think you have to think about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the cat. Millions of your fellow countrymen think that you have to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;think about your inanimate objects before you think about the cat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Moo-Moo has not had any problems with the litterbox...which I have
&gt;&gt;heard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that some cats do after being declawed. His ballance is fine...and he
&gt;&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no problem with us touching his feet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm very glad your cat is okay, but as you say, there are plenty of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;people who will testify that their cats are not.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that everyone has a right to their own opinion. Wether or not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people want to declaw or not declaw is up to them. If we get a law
&gt;&gt;&gt; passed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is against declawing that is Okay with me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, everyone has a right to their opinion, but there is a big
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;difference between believing something to be acceptable and in it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;actually being morally or ethically acceptable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Paedophiles are of the opinion that sex with children is acceptable.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Does that make it so? Hitler believed that murdering six million Jews
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;was acceptable - and that was also legal. Did that make it morally or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ethically acceptable?

Ok, for what it's worth, I am an American. However, I have never had,
or considered it an option to declaw a cat for any reason. So,
therefore I can't see that lumping americans together is right. I
tried to read all of the articles in this group before replying, but I
just couldn't resist any longer. PD, I give you lots of credit, as you
obviously do love animals very much. It is obvious in every post I
have read at times your responces may be &quot;viewed&quot; as just being mean.
I don't think so. I think we all need to maybe be a bit &quot;meaner&quot; to
stick up for these little creatures that are so badly mistreated.
Thanks for being so strong, and respecting our 4-legged babies. And
now for those supporting declawing, I have to mention a few things: I
don't know if it has been pointed out, but how can someone justify
ripping the very part of a cat out that is their means of life and
survial? If a child, as they do, pulled on your hair for whatever
reason, would there be any way to excuse chopping their arms off in
attempt to prevent them from doing that? Are cats able to mistreated
just because they cannot talk as a human, or grow up to be doctors or
lawyers? How would you like it if some part was ripped off of you? If
more people would really think about things in that way, I don't
declawing would ever be an issue. If you choose to have a pet, why to
you choose to hurt them?

The only thing I have to say about declawing is that I feel that anyone who
subjects their cat to that kind of torture should have their fingernails
yanked out with a pair of pliers. Not a flame, just my personal opinion.
There are alternatives such as scratching posts. More recently, they've
come out with little plastic sheaths that you can purchase to cover your
cat's claws. Those of you who are lurking and thinking about having your
cat declawed, I urge you to seriously think about how you would feel if your
fingers and/or toes were amputated at the knuckle against your will. That
is exactly what declawing is.

I have a male Brittany Spaniel named Slim that I adopted from the local
humane society shelter. He was already an adult when I got him, and his
tail was amputated to a 4 inch stump. This is a common practice in certain
breeds of hunting dogs, and the reasoning behind it is stupid in my opinion.
I was told by a German Shorthair breeder that the main reason it's done is
to prevent the dog from getting burdocks (10x worse than velcro) stuck in
their tail when they're hunting in the field. My dog has never gone
hunting, and never will. If I had adopted him as a youngster, before he was
mutilated, he would still have his full length tail today.

I also have a very loveable female gray mackerel tabby with gorgeous green
eyes named Bobbi. She got her name due to a mishap when she was a kitten.
She was a barn cat and when she was younger, on a particularly bitter cold
winter day, she decided to seek warmth by climbing up into the engine
compartment of a pick-up truck on the farm where she was born. Unaware that
she was under the hood, the owner of the truck got in and started the
engine. As a result, her tail was injured. The injury to her tail
subsquently got infected to the point where it had to be amputated. She now
has a 1 inch stump for a tail, so I guess my dog and my cat have more in
common than just living in the same household.

My point is that mutilation due to an accident is one thing, but mutilation
for the sake of tradition as with tail docking in certain dog breeds, or to
save your furniture in the case of declawing is inhumane and should not even
be considered.

I agree about the declaw. I wish I had learned before having two of my cats
fully (all 4) declawed. They were unable to fully retract their claws and
just walking on the furniture caused damage. I also had a lot of little red
dots on my skin. Well one of them now is so timid, he runs from everything.
The other one, who was a bully, now is less of a bully. She will run if she
thinks she can't beat you up. Now I have a beautiful Manx. I got her from
the Humane Society. Her tail is naturally so short it is almost not there.
She continues to have all her claws. I have never seen her use her claws on
the other cats, and she doesn't use them on me, just my husband. She wont
use a scratching post however. I really didn't want to declaw her. She is so
bold and sweet, I take no chances with changing that. I finally found Soft
Paws. I wish I had Them For Sammy and Jeckle!. She looks so Cute. I got
bright Pink. No more scratching, and she is now used to them, though every
once in awhile she tries to scratch the couch and just looks at me so
confused. She can't figure out why she can't get her claws into the couch.
She gets so mad and throws a tantrum. It is so funny! They do notice a
difference and it can change them if the claws are completely gone!
Just my experience.

Sometimes you get clawed because you have a stroppy cat and other times
because you got it wrong.

Of the five one (Tigger) has never clawed me,
Bitsy regularly gets over-excited and goes for the hand holding the
string, no malice intended at all.
Tinker (an elderly, formerly only cat) used to emphasise his orders with
nips and the occaisional swipe
Trudy, was moody, spooky and drew blood for six months until she calmed
down enough to just thump us with a paw with sheathed claws.
Mowcher, loopy female, only once clawed me and that was because I
startled and trapped her by stroking her when she was in her special
hole beside the chest in the dining room. She then promptly trotted out
and licked it better! I never approached her in her special corner
again.

Well, this is a bit late, but I just needed to say something. I never really
knew what declawing entailed until I read it in this group, I just knew
intrinsically that it was something that oughtn't to be done. I've read that
some folks have said that it takes a lot of time to teach a cat not to claw the
furniture. And that some haven't got that kind of time - so they *must* declaw
their cats. Because they *love* them and want to keep them. I submit that that
kind of love is a selfish one, and not one that I would want to have. And not
one I would want directed towards me.

As far as not having the time, I can appreciate that it does take time and
effort to teach an animal &quot;acceptable&quot; behavior. I used to live in the country,
had 8 children (all adopted, special needs), a husband that wasn't worth a shit,
2 dogs, 3 cats and a love bird (small parrot). I cut the wood for the
woodstoves to heat the house, made all the bread and meals from scratch, took
care of the children and the house (including repairs) by myself, and later
additionally worked as a reporter. I was busy. Busier than most. Yet, I took
the time to teach the cats not to scratch the furniture and do stuff that would
cause them to get in trouble. Otherwise, my then husband (now ex) would have
gotten rid of them. He didn't really like animals. (I should have known. Never
trust someone who doesn't like animals). It took consisency and a bottle of
water. I would squirt them when they began to scratch. I also clapped my hands
and said &quot;NO!&quot; They learned.

Now, in this life, it's just the two of us - my husband (a new one, and a good
guy) and me - our 5 lb poodle, one 15 lb. male cat (I did have 2, but the female
got killed) and a parokeet. The cats adopted us when they were maybe 9 months
old or so. They had been outside a lot - mostly I think for quite some time.
Amazing how they adapted. I do have more time now than I did, but have been
pretty sick. But, even tho' Dillon and Miss Kitty were difficult to teach, we
did and do. Never once have we considered declawing them. With Miss Kitty gone,
there is only Dillon, who is pretty hard-headed. No matter how many times we
tell him not to, he still want to put his claws in the overstuffed chair. And,
he still wants to drag himself by his claws along the length of the couch. But
we love him and wouldn't think of giving him away, or of declawing him. We use
the squirt bottle on occasion, and clap our hands and say &quot;NO!&quot; It works for
the most part, but it's still a challenge. But, no matter. We'll keep him with
all his faults, his love and his parts (except we did get him neutered).

it before it was six months old. NOW I've figured out how to stop it!
We put her scratching posts right up against the places she
scratched, and now she scratches them instead. This has

posts when company comes.

I read in a pet book that cats like to scratch furniture that is near

Cookie behaves like the true lady she is now... This stuff is amazing.
It's cheap. It's effective. It's harmless to the cat. It's unobtrusive

Its also hilarious to watch the first encounter of the cat kind...

reasons lions claw trees. They do it in a very public location, and stretch
as high as possible. They do this to show how big they are to other cats in

as much attention as a taller kitty tower in plain view in the family room. A
taller tower is a good investment to save your furniturre. We do not believe
in amputating the first knuckles of our pets (declawing.) PookyDee ********

21:44:25 -0500:

First of all, gentlemen, I am back and I am wondered to see that holy
war for/against declawing still goes on. I still have my opinions and
that means, I will take sides.
Now, after reading this..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;NOTE TO CAT LOVERS!!!!: The following is all sarcasm, I love my cats and
&gt;am against hurting animals!

&gt;You know, based on the &quot;rational&quot; arguments of April and other cat
&gt;mutilators, I have come to a decision...

&gt;I REALLY love my furniture more than my kitty. After all my kitty is
&gt;just a toy and decoration for me to play with and alter as I please to
&gt;fit my needs. It's really just a status symbol to make my family life
&gt;look complete and healthy.
&gt;I don't want anything to hurt my beautiful furniture and carpet, that
&gt;would ruin the picture I am trying to paint of the ideal home. So, it
&gt;comes that I must de-penis my male cat. Afterall, he does spray and pee
&gt;and I just can't have that. It's for his own good. I mean, if he sprays,
&gt;I will become upset and hurt his feelings. I don't want him to feel bad
&gt;if I yell at him. Carrying him away and training him not to spray would
&gt;just be too traumatic. Of course neutering is just unnatural, so that
&gt;should be avoided.
&gt;De-penising will also benefit my other kitties. They will all be equal
&gt;and unenvious. The female cat will not be jealous of what the other cat
&gt;has.
&gt;I think that all pet owners should de-penis. More cats would find homes
&gt;if they didn't spray or pee. Afterall NOONE wants a cat to disrupt their
&gt;lives.
&gt;This operation will also save money. I wont have to use as much kitty
&gt;litter.
&gt;The vet will also be very happy, he will get more money from me.
&gt;Of course, I don't have to think about the cat's discomfort or
&gt;abhoration at the surgery because... he can't tell me!
&gt;There are so many wonderful reasons to depenis your cat. All of them are
&gt;very beneficial to the owners, and of course, the kitty can't complain!
&gt;I love playing with pets and altering them! Its like redecorating or
&gt;remodeling! I want everything to be perfect and suit my needs. Afterall,
&gt;I am the superior human in this relationship. I may also look into
&gt;de-anusing so I wont have to worry about cat poop.
&gt;What a wonderful world this will be! I can change all of nature to fit
&gt;my needs!

"/> ...I've realised that this text, which isn't actually funny, and even
kinda silly, shows in compressed forms almost everything expressed by
declawers during the last battles I remember.
Yes, April and other people used some of these arguments as their
motivation. Since this message is the first I read in this thread,
expect me to argue on a subject.

I want to say hello to everyone here and thanks guys that you're still
here.

&gt;that it will be safe, instead of frantically locating my cats &amp; getting
&gt;them out to safety. Cathy

"/> Don't really get where it belongs. I have a strong suspection that
you're right about it not being a sarcasm, because Real Cat Lovers,
not to mean someone personally &lt;g&gt; with all their arguments are just
pretending to take the above &quot;sarcasm&quot; as a rule.

After reading some messages in declawing thread, let me arrange you
TIE Lion's Manifesto Of The Cat Relationship.

a) My cats are not my own property, because they're not the sort of
&quot;things&quot; that can be moved, put in a corner, kicked around and called
&quot;living stuff&quot;. I am a live being and I can't own another live being.
a) My cats are the ones I love.
b) My cats are the ones I love and would not be offended by me in any
case.
c) My cats are the ones I love and no one would be allowed to offend
them in any case.
d) My cats are the ones I love, and they're more important to me than
any furniture. And I believe I am not less important to them.
e) My cats are the ones I love, and they're more important to me than
my material property and/or time/money/patience.
f) My cats are the cats, not &quot;furballs&quot;, or &quot;stupid animals&quot;, and,
since I perfectly realise that they can't immediately understand what
do I want from them, I will take the best method to teach them. My
best method is not meant to be a &quot;quick fix&quot;, &quot;final solution&quot;,
&quot;engineering idea&quot; but a method best suitable for them.
g) My cats are the cats, and we're the humans. We're different, and in
our relations we measure our own meres upon ourselves and their meres
upon them. We allow them to live their special cat way as they
please, while succeeding to live with them as we please.
g) My cats are &quot;free spirits&quot;, and will not be limited in their
freedom and claimed indoors/outdoors unless their own safety is in a
serious question.
h) My cats are the ones who live with me, share with me same
appartaments and have the likely requirements. They bring their warm
feelings to us and we bring our warm feelings to them. They feel
responsible towards us as much as they are able in their way and we
feel responsible towards them as much as we able in our way. They live
their life, and we live our life, but when these coincide, everything
can be understood and accepted by both sides.

&quot;Time/money/patience&quot; pattern (C) April

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Thank you, Paul. From this reply, I know that you've been reading &amp;
&gt;understanding my posts by looking at them objectively, as I have yours.
&gt;Whenever the &quot;people who have declawed cats love their furniture more than
&gt;their cats&quot; line comes up, my first thought has been, &quot;Oh, right - like I'd
&gt;drag an upholstered chair out of the house, instead of getting the cats
&gt;out - in their carriers, if time permitted.&quot; The first post in this thread
&gt;presented the perfect opportunity to say this, although I've refrained from
&gt;sarcasm so far. Several weeks ago, I got a phone call at work, the
&gt;secretary saying before the call was transferred in, &quot;Cathy, your neighbor
&gt;is calling. If you need to leave immediately, we can get you coverage.&quot;
&gt;(I'm a teacher.) My first thought was, &quot;Oh my God, the house is on fire and
&gt;the cats are trapped in there.&quot; It turned out to be nothing of the kind -
&gt;phew. And yes, you're right, if declawing were to be outlawed, I'd still
&gt;have cats, as you read in another post. My 1st cat was fully armed, and she
&gt;did do a real number on some furniture, but I dearly loved her, and still
&gt;miss her. Cathy

"/> My dear Cathy! It seems that you and Paul have found the way to put
the end to the stupid war. The question &quot;Would you keep the cat if the
declawing were to be outlawed?&quot; is THE one which distinguishes between
cat lovers and Well Known Cat Lovers.
Yes, since now I admit that I distinguish between the real and the
wannabe ones. And the question will be my primary tool,
The war was actually not to prove that declawing is good or bad, but
the Well Known Cat Lovers tried to prove that the declawing is a good
thing to do, because it will prevent *themselves* from getting rid of
the cat. They, Well Known Cat Lovers, are plainly unable to sacrifice
all available time/money/patience in order to avoid hurting the cats.
Other idea was to prove that declawing doesn't actually hurts. See my
&quot;Manifesto&quot; post.
Since now, I propose to everyone in our alt and rec lines to stop for
a minute and think &quot;Would I keep my cats if the declawing were
outlawed?&quot; However, the positive answer doesn't guarantee that you're
a cat lovers, ladies and gentlemen, but the negative one clearly shows
that you are NOT.

&gt;Yes, we did have one couch getting clawed for awhile. Solution: we put
&gt;a cover on it until the cat was trustworthy. Had she never outgrown
&gt;it, we would havekept using the cover. Cost: less than $10. Take off
&gt;cover and put cat away for company.

&gt;Now, we have also had some very serious problems with urination. At
&gt;one time, we had a dog that would pee for attention, but it was my
&gt;grandmother's dog. She refused to train him. Peeing did not stop until
&gt;she died. After that, he stopped instantly. We also had a cat that
&gt;sprayed. We went through several different drugs including valium and
&gt;female hormones. Nothing worked. We put plastic over the furniture
&gt;where he liked to spray and we placed ads looking for a home where he
&gt;would be the only cat. Never did find a home, so we kept him.

Declawing?!*threatening growl* I would never even dream of it. I was shocked
&amp; angered when my fammily suggested I should have my cat declawed. It
disgusts me that anyone would do such a cruel thing....all over a few scars

What a bore you must be if you value your furniture and carpet more than
your pet. Why get it in the first place. People like you should be licensed
to have a pet and have pass stringent testing! I have two Burmese cats, they
have their scratching box,and the kitten is only 15 weeks old and he already
knows what the scratching box is for.
Get out there and get a life, and if you can't deal with the cat, give it to
someone who will!

and what happens when your cat gets outside and another cat gets to it, your
cat will have no defense. your cat will be torn to pieces. I know many
people have indoor only cats, but every cat has snuck out the door once in
its life.

what a wonderful way to put things. I and my husband greatly enjoyed this.
I wish every person in America who was thinking about declawing their feline
friend would be forced to read this. I have a chair, was once a beautiful
thing. My cats started to use it for their claws, sitting on and sleeping
on. The chair was ruined very quickly. We replaced the chair with another
lovely chair that now sits in our livingroom. But, we saved the other
chair, set it in an unnoticeable area and the kittens have it for their
personal use, it is their chair, noone ever sits in it or uses it but them.
They are happy with this situation and so are we.

&gt;&gt;First of all, gentlemen, I am back and I am wondered to see that holy
&gt;&gt;war for/against declawing still goes on. I still have my opinions and
&gt;&gt;that means, I will take sides.
&gt;&gt;Now, after reading this..
&gt;&gt;&gt;NOTE TO CAT LOVERS!!!!: The following is all sarcasm, I love my cats and
&gt;&gt;&gt;am against hurting animals!

&gt;&gt;&gt;You know, based on the &quot;rational&quot; arguments of April and other cat
&gt;&gt;&gt;mutilators, I have come to a decision...

&gt;&gt;&gt;I REALLY love my furniture more than my kitty. After all my kitty is
&gt;&gt;&gt;just a toy and decoration for me to play with and alter as I please to
&gt;&gt;&gt;fit my needs. It's really just a status symbol to make my family life
&gt;&gt;&gt;look complete and healthy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't want anything to hurt my beautiful furniture and carpet, that
&gt;&gt;&gt;would ruin the picture I am trying to paint of the ideal home. So, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;comes that I must de-penis my male cat. Afterall, he does spray and pee
&gt;&gt;&gt;and I just can't have that. It's for his own good. I mean, if he sprays,
&gt;&gt;&gt;I will become upset and hurt his feelings. I don't want him to feel bad
&gt;&gt;&gt;if I yell at him. Carrying him away and training him not to spray would
&gt;&gt;&gt;just be too traumatic. Of course neutering is just unnatural, so that
&gt;&gt;&gt;should be avoided.
&gt;&gt;&gt;De-penising will also benefit my other kitties. They will all be equal
&gt;&gt;&gt;and unenvious. The female cat will not be jealous of what the other cat
&gt;&gt;&gt;has.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I think that all pet owners should de-penis. More cats would find homes
&gt;&gt;&gt;if they didn't spray or pee. Afterall NOONE wants a cat to disrupt their
&gt;&gt;&gt;lives.
&gt;&gt;&gt;This operation will also save money. I wont have to use as much kitty
&gt;&gt;&gt;litter.
&gt;&gt;&gt;The vet will also be very happy, he will get more money from me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course, I don't have to think about the cat's discomfort or
&gt;&gt;&gt;abhoration at the surgery because... he can't tell me!
&gt;&gt;&gt;There are so many wonderful reasons to depenis your cat. All of them are
&gt;&gt;&gt;very beneficial to the owners, and of course, the kitty can't complain!
&gt;&gt;&gt;I love playing with pets and altering them! Its like redecorating or
&gt;&gt;&gt;remodeling! I want everything to be perfect and suit my needs. Afterall,
&gt;&gt;&gt;I am the superior human in this relationship. I may also look into

&gt;&gt;motivation. Since this message is the first I read in this thread,
&gt;&gt;expect me to argue on a subject.

"/> A couple of weeks ago, here in San Diego county, they did license checks
like they do the checks for intoxicated drivers. They stopped every
fifth driver to see if they had licenses. Some didn't. Never had.
Some were driving on suspended or revoked licenses. These folks had
their vehicles impounded.

Of course, in steps the ACLU, saying that these types of checks were
illegal. I don't see how that could be, because driving isn't a *right*
it's a *privilege*.

And not having one certainly didn't keep some of them from getting

"/> They do it alot on holiday weekends. They check for intoxicated drivers
and that's been held up in court. They pull every X car over. I
understand that by doing it this way, it can't be said that they were
stopping people because because of how they looked, that it was
discriminatory. My husband says that if you refuse the test, your
license is automatically revoked.

The difference is public vs private. The roadways are public. Now, if
you're driving drunk on your own property, there's not anything they can
do about it.

Since humans have the power to inflict pain on animals, I believe any one
who decides to have the claws removed from a cat should first be required
to have their own nails removed. The nails of the human should be removed
by a vet. who has much experience in this area. Of course, I am just a
foolish lover of cats more than furniture. I wonder if the next complaint
will concern the noise a cat makes when purring. It must disturb some
sensitive humans.LOP

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;very beneficial to the owners, and of course, the kitty can't complain!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I love playing with pets and altering them! Its like redecorating or

&gt;&gt;Afterall,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am the superior human in this relationship. I may also look into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;de-anusing so I wont have to worry about cat poop.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What a wonderful world this will be! I can change all of nature to fit

Removing the nails wouldn't do the trick. The fingers would have to be
amputated down to the first knuckle. That would be the same thing.

&gt;&gt; What a bore you must be if you value your furniture and carpet more than
&gt;&gt; your pet. Why get it in the first place. People like you should be
&gt;licensed
&gt;&gt; to have a pet and have pass stringent testing! I have two Burmese cats,
&gt;they
&gt;&gt; have their scratching box,and the kitten is only 15 weeks old and he
&gt;already
&gt;&gt; knows what the scratching box is for.
&gt;&gt; Get out there and get a life, and if you can't deal with the cat, give it

&gt;&gt;&gt;21:44:25 -0500:

&gt;&gt;&gt;First of all, gentlemen, I am back and I am wondered to see that holy
&gt;&gt;&gt;war for/against declawing still goes on. I still have my opinions and
&gt;&gt;&gt;that means, I will take sides.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Now, after reading this..
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;NOTE TO CAT LOVERS!!!!: The following is all sarcasm, I love my cats
&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;am against hurting animals!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You know, based on the &quot;rational&quot; arguments of April and other cat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mutilators, I have come to a decision...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I REALLY love my furniture more than my kitty. After all my kitty is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;just a toy and decoration for me to play with and alter as I please to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fit my needs. It's really just a status symbol to make my family life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;look complete and healthy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't want anything to hurt my beautiful furniture and carpet, that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would ruin the picture I am trying to paint of the ideal home. So, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;comes that I must de-penis my male cat. Afterall, he does spray and pee
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and I just can't have that. It's for his own good. I mean, if he
&gt;sprays,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I will become upset and hurt his feelings. I don't want him to feel bad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if I yell at him. Carrying him away and training him not to spray would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;just be too traumatic. Of course neutering is just unnatural, so that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;should be avoided.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;De-penising will also benefit my other kitties. They will all be equal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and unenvious. The female cat will not be jealous of what the other cat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;has.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think that all pet owners should de-penis. More cats would find homes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if they didn't spray or pee. Afterall NOONE wants a cat to disrupt
&gt;their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;lives.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This operation will also save money. I wont have to use as much kitty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;litter.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The vet will also be very happy, he will get more money from me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course, I don't have to think about the cat's discomfort or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;abhoration at the surgery because... he can't tell me!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There are so many wonderful reasons to depenis your cat. All of them
&gt;are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;very beneficial to the owners, and of course, the kitty can't complain!

My cat has never snuck out the door - she hasn't even been curious! We
declawed her when she was 6 mos. and the only time we even take her outside
is when she is in her crate and going to the vet's. When the snow is about
10 inches deep - she seems to get curious because she knows something out
there is 'different' - she takes maybe two steps out - sees that that
white stuff is no good and runs back in to the warmth of her home.
She was born in a barn - and when her mama was killed - a nice lady took the
kittens in and made sure they all had nice homes. She's even killed mice
(in the old house we used to live in).. and that was without claws! She
just turned 7 and is the best cat in the universe (I'm not a partial
person - these are the facts!!) hehehe Just my $.02!

&gt;and what happens when your cat gets outside and another cat gets to it,
your
&gt;cat will have no defense. your cat will be torn to pieces. I know many
&gt;people have indoor only cats, but every cat has snuck out the door once in
&gt;its life.

Well, this is a bit offtopic, but I believe you will like it.
After taking battles in declawing issue which was started in alt.cats
I've started to monitor some newsgroups with a purpose of recording
some interesting citations. If you allow, I will crosspost them here
in the groups.
Anyone interested may mail me, will send you a copy. I actually
looking forward into organising a small mailing list and all.
