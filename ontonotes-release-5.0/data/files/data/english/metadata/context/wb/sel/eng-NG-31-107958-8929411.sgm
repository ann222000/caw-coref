That's what editors are for.

Writers are often &quot;idea people&quot; and sometimes (often?) miss the small,
detail-oriented stuff. Some of the best thinkers are, believe it or
not, dyslexic as well. Comes with the territory. They've *mostly*
overcome the handicap, but....

I can &quot;hear&quot; a good writer as I read. In fact, when I read a writer I
know and *don't* hear his voice, I know the editor is ham-handed and
should be replaced.

A writer is using the printed page to tell a story, whether it be a
good yarn or an instruction manual.

A common writing technique is to read what you wrote aloud. If it
sounds awkward or doesn't paint the picture you wanted to transmit,
it's time to revise.

Even you have a voice that I hear. I don't know it's pitch or speed,
but I hear it clearly.

Willie boy, you are positively amazing. You can type 150 words per
minute ... I can type as fast as I can think, you say.

So, using your figures you can think at about 150 words per minute, or
about 0.400 seconds, or 400 milliseconds, per word.

As reporting in the May 25 Proceedings of the National Academy of the
Sciences, the speed of thought is around 300 milliseconds. That's how
long it took a volunteer to begin to understand a pictured object.

It appears that your comprehension is 33% lower then normal.

The point is when a person talks his speech lags behind his thought
process. This makes for inefficient speech which when transcribed makes
for inefficient writing.

Look at it this way. If you mouth the words that you read it slows down
your reading. This is fact and cannot be argued with. You are engaging
in an extra process and that's inneficient. Same thing goes with
writing. It's more efficient to have the thought delivered through the
fingertips than throught the mouth. Advanced writers have been taught
these facts. That's why Gogarty is an unsuccessful writer for the most
part. He has limited his potential. He has crippled himself. He's like a
400 pound ballerina.

Then you are mentally and probably physically mouthing the words.
Printed words have no sound and should have no sound. They should only
bring forth a mental process. The whole idea of verbal speech in
anathema to written speech. Humans have progressed as far as they have
primaryily due to the written word because it is so much more efficient
and accurate. Writers should realize that fact and use the art of
writing to go where speech cannot go.

Only if his intent is to do so. As a writer, I would rather leave good
yarn-spinning to my voice where it belongs. I use writing to stimulate
thought - not paint a picture. A canvas and paint brush paints a better
picture that somebody talking about a painting. A good writer bypasses
the physical senses and goes right to the source - the mind. After all,
without the mind there are no physical senses. The mind is the
wellspring. Any writer who doesn't know this fact is no writer - just a
hack.

Why do you think I'm such a successful troll. It's not because I put my
verbal blatherings on the screen. It's because I push mind buttons that
writing can push while transcribed verbal gushings cannot.

Makes it all the more invalid. . .  But, isn't it amazing how there is
no such word and, as such, it is never spoken yet your mind can deal
with it and look at the thoughts it produced without ever having been
mouthed. Look what has happened &quot;behind the scenes.&quot; Sort of makes my
point, doesn't it?

with Lydia's 80+ year old mother, who's getting her sea legs nicely from

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, Wilbur, I made a substantial living as a writer over many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; years.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Still manage to rake in a dime or two now and then. But typing is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now, never will be and never was one of my skills.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What a hoot! A writer who can't type? Now, that's so dumb it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;beyond
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;human ken.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How many truck drivers can't steer? How many cowboys can't lasso?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;many wet nurses can't lactate? How many bartenders can't mix drinks?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;many airplane pilots can't land? How many talk radio hosts are deaf
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mutes?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Get the point?  Any writer worthy of the name learns to type.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wilbur Hubbard

&gt;&gt;&gt; How dreadfully ignorant you are. (Typed with two fingers.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't imagine Shakespeare knew how to type.

&gt;&gt;Voice recognition software is still not up to par. A good touch typist
&gt;&gt;can type 80-100 wpm without a single mistake that has to be corrected
&gt;&gt;later. One spends more time looking for and correcting voice
&gt;&gt;recognition
&gt;&gt;software mistakes and omissions than if one simply learned to type and
&gt;&gt;removed the middle man so to speak.

&gt;&gt;Anybody typing with two fingers is lazy, stupid or both (unless, of
&gt;&gt;course, they only have two fingers). Learning to type is a simple
&gt;&gt;thing.
&gt;&gt;Anybody can accomplish the task in about a week or two. Anybody who
&gt;&gt;needs to type (as in a writer) should have enough pride in his work
&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;he learns to type and at an advanced rate like 80-100 wpm.

&gt;&gt;It appalls me that any so-called writer would admit he can't type.
&gt;&gt;This
&gt;&gt;is beyond pathetic.  I, Wilbur Hubbard, can type 150 wpm. I can
&gt;&gt;transcribe faster than you can dictate. I can type as fast as I can
&gt;&gt;think. The problem with transcribing is you don't write well when you
&gt;&gt;simply transcribe your talk. Writing is not talking. Writing is a
&gt;&gt;different type of an art form. When I read somebody's writing I
&gt;&gt;certainly don't want to read his blabbermouthing. And, believe me, I
&gt;&gt;can
&gt;&gt;tell the difference. Writing and word processing always ends up
&gt;&gt;telling
&gt;&gt;a better tale than a simple-minded narration.

&gt;&gt;Wilbur Hubbard

&gt; Willie boy, you are positively amazing. You can type 150 words per
&gt; minute ... I can type as fast as I can think, you say.

&gt; So, using your figures you can think at about 150 words per minute, or
&gt; about 0.400 seconds, or 400 milliseconds, per word.

&gt; As reporting in the May 25 Proceedings of the National Academy of the
&gt; Sciences, the speed of thought is around 300 milliseconds. That's how
&gt; long it took a volunteer to begin to understand a pictured object.
">

The speed of thought is not measured in words. Thought happens without
words. If I stick a pin into you there are no words involved with your
realization of pain. You don't have to think &quot;ouch&quot; in order to feel the
pain. So there goes your somewhat convoluted argument.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It appears that your comprehension is 33% lower then normal.
">

Got you again! What does comprehension have to do with the speed of
thought?
Some idiot savant might not be able to pick his nose but he can
caluclate pi to the 39th decimal place in his head. He has no
comprehension at all but he can still think. Again it makes my point
that thinking does not rely on words. Words are just a by-product of
thinking and a clumsy one at that. Add to that clumsiness verbalizing
these words prior to putting them onto paper or the screen and you've
become so inefficient that it's laughable thinking of a somebody like
Gogarthy going through the motions. A 400lb ballerina.

Some writers find that long hand is more creative.

I suspect it is just a comfort thing.

Truman Capote wrote with pen on paper, for example.

Later, the script is transfered to type paper, and edited.

We need more mean spirited people here.  This nice stuff is boring.

Now that is an interesting idea in the area of encoding and decoding

DECODE (listent and usderstand) about 400-600 wpm. Most people belive
we do not think like a typwriter, that is we dont think words per min.

brain(ENCODE) for sending (communication). So dear WilllBurr we dont
think in wpm but we do listen and DECODE in wpm.

Readaloud is a very important precess for the emergant reader. Plus a
very important part of modeling reading skills. That is, what an
independent reader thinks when reading. It aint just about
wpm.......... uh, ya  gots to consider comprehension to. Thats a big
problem with fonix. Kids can decode (read) text  but dont know a thing
about what they read. Its just the abilit to say sounds accuratly 80%

multiplication tables (algorythems- facts) but couldnt figure out how
to use the stuff (application). Fairly typical in certain &quot;socio-

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This is fact and cannot be argued with. You are engaging

The Selectric came out in 1961 and had no chip.  In fact it had no
electronics, other than the motor.  The entire works were mechanical,
including the &quot;stroke storage&quot; that allowed a second key to come in
somewhat faster than the nominal 65 millisecond cycle time.

At 14.8 characters/second, this is 3 words/second or 180 words per
minute.  This is faster than any typist can sustain, but is perhaps
possible in a burst.

My mom had a similar typing background, working in DC during WWII as a
typist right out of high school.  Won competitions.
Later in Chicago in the '50's  she was doing a typing test to get a
job at a publishing company.
When employees there heard her typing they all came to the door to get
a look at the new *electric* typewriter they figured the company had
finally bought.  No electric there, but they stayed to watch her
anyway.  She went on to a career as one of the few female linotype
operators in the country.
I only saw her typing at home much later when I bought a typewriter
to do college papers, and she sometimes helped me get out a paper.
Amazing to watch.
I took a touch typing course in college, only because it got an
elective out of the way, and I liked the 20:1 female/male ratio in
that classroom.  I passed the course, which only required about
35 WPM, but soon reverted to 2-finger, and that's all I needed
to get through my 25 year business/computer &quot;career.&quot;
I'm going to look at the voice software again.  Last time I tested it
- about 10 years ago - I rejected it.
BTW, this post took me about 18 hours to write, but it was the
thinking that made it slow.  So the voice-writing might knock it
down to maybe 9 hours.

As a lit/poetry student I gave considerable thought to what you are
touching on here.  Poetry and literature began as spoken words, and
as writing developed they transitioned to being mostly read and not
heard.
Playwrights/scriptwriters have different concerns in their writing,
but most writing it there to be read, not spoken.
I even got interested in the *look* of certain words on a page as
having their own &quot;expression&quot; and power - beyond their prescriptive
meaning and aural sound.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; A writer is using the printed page to tell a story, whether it be a
&gt;&gt; good yarn or an instruction manual.

&gt;Only if his intent is to do so. As a writer, I would rather leave good
&gt;yarn-spinning to my voice where it belongs. I use writing to stimulate
&gt;thought - not paint a picture. A canvas and paint brush paints a better
&gt;picture that somebody talking about a painting. A good writer bypasses
&gt;the physical senses and goes right to the source - the mind. After all,
&gt;without the mind there are no physical senses. The mind is the
&gt;wellspring. Any writer who doesn't know this fact is no writer - just a
&gt;hack.

You can't speak to a newsgroup with aural voice.
That's why you must type.  You can use voice software and
then tweak the words if they don't suit.
Never done it myself.

:&gt;The Selectric came out in 1961 and had no chip.  In fact it had no
:&gt;electronics, other than the motor.  The entire works were mechanical,
:&gt;including the &quot;stroke storage&quot; that allowed a second key to come in
:&gt;somewhat faster than the nominal 65 millisecond cycle time.
:&gt;
:&gt;At 14.8 characters/second, this is 3 words/second or 180 words per
:&gt;minute.  This is faster than any typist can sustain, but is perhaps
:&gt;possible in a burst.

:One thing I like about the Internet is that the truth eventually will out no
:matter how silly the original assertion.

The Selectric has a complicated mechanical mechanism that allows it
queue a key stroke.  The cycle time is long enough that there are all
sorts of combinations that even a not terribly good typist can
produce at greater than 14.8 cps.  Think about &quot;th&quot; for instance.  I
don't doubt that there are three key combintations that someone who
can type at 120 or 140 wpm that the selectric would lose.

Right  and the current qwerty keyboard was to keep the old time
typewriter keys from jamming  - meant to slow down the typist.

The next advance over the regular manual typewriter - before we got
the Selectric, was an IBM Executive with variable spaced letters.  If
you had a correction, you had to remember how many spaces the letters
took.  IIRC, most of the letters were 3 spaces, but the I and L were
only two, the M was four and the W was five (in lower case).   We were
still using carbon paper then too.

One of my jobs in HS was to do typescript of my dad's first book for
photo-offset printing where we were not allowed to erase an error
because it would show.  (Later editions were typeset - only the first
version was done this way)

My mom had one of these typewriters and a Selectric when she died and
I basically threw them away because no one wants one anymore.

&gt;I had a secretary once whom I hired straight out of college -- her first job.
&gt;She was a typing demon. Information went in her eyes and out her fingers with
&gt;no stops in between at some incredible speed. The type script she produced was
&gt;a faithful copy of what she was given -- errors and all. She just went on
&gt;automatic and if it was garbage in it was garbage out. It took awhile to get
&gt;her to slow down and read what she was copying before she typed it. She became
&gt;an excellent editor and has been running her own PR and advertising business
&gt;for years. But way back then she was a real automaton.

Yes  - it is much faster to copy than to write.  The two processes
don't have any real correlation.  Perfectly possible to type faster
than you can think and reproduce what you see absolutely accurately.
When I was learning to type, there was a girl in my class who was
blind and she was learning to type dictation (since she couldn't read
the text).  She had to be perfect because she couldn't see her errors.
It can be done.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Really OT, but my first computer back in '76 was a Trash 80 that had no lower
&gt;case. I was doing a major project for a client who objected to receiving
&gt;typescripts that were all in upper case, like a teletype. The printer was a
&gt;recycled Anderson-Jacobson terminal with an IBM Selectric action with a
&gt;keyboard. You could use it offline as a typewriter. It cost $1,200 in 1976..
&gt;The printer would print out the teletype text and then my wife would retype it
&gt;properly on the same machine. Happily, after-market vendors started producing
&gt;chips that would give the Trash 80 lower case capability.

My first computer was the Apple II+ in about that time frame and it
didn't have the caps either.  Although you could get software that
would put them in.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, Wilbur, I made a substantial living as a writer over many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; years.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Still manage to rake in a dime or two now and then. But typing is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now, never will be and never was one of my skills.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What a hoot! A writer who can't type? Now, that's so dumb it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;beyond
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;human ken.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How many truck drivers can't steer? How many cowboys can't lasso?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;many wet nurses can't lactate? How many bartenders can't mix drinks?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;many airplane pilots can't land? How many talk radio hosts are deaf
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mutes?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Get the point?  Any writer worthy of the name learns to type.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wilbur Hubbard

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How dreadfully ignorant you are. (Typed with two fingers.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't imagine Shakespeare knew how to type.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Voice recognition software is still not up to par. A good touch typist
&gt;&gt;&gt;can type 80-100 wpm without a single mistake that has to be corrected
&gt;&gt;&gt;later. One spends more time looking for and correcting voice
&gt;&gt;&gt;recognition
&gt;&gt;&gt;software mistakes and omissions than if one simply learned to type and
&gt;&gt;&gt;removed the middle man so to speak.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Anybody typing with two fingers is lazy, stupid or both (unless, of
&gt;&gt;&gt;course, they only have two fingers). Learning to type is a simple
&gt;&gt;&gt;thing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Anybody can accomplish the task in about a week or two. Anybody who
&gt;&gt;&gt;needs to type (as in a writer) should have enough pride in his work
&gt;&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;&gt;he learns to type and at an advanced rate like 80-100 wpm.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It appalls me that any so-called writer would admit he can't type.
&gt;&gt;&gt;This
&gt;&gt;&gt;is beyond pathetic.  I, Wilbur Hubbard, can type 150 wpm. I can
&gt;&gt;&gt;transcribe faster than you can dictate. I can type as fast as I can
&gt;&gt;&gt;think. The problem with transcribing is you don't write well when you
&gt;&gt;&gt;simply transcribe your talk. Writing is not talking. Writing is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;different type of an art form. When I read somebody's writing I
&gt;&gt;&gt;certainly don't want to read his blabbermouthing. And, believe me, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;can
&gt;&gt;&gt;tell the difference. Writing and word processing always ends up
&gt;&gt;&gt;telling
&gt;&gt;&gt;a better tale than a simple-minded narration.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Wilbur Hubbard

&gt;&gt; Willie boy, you are positively amazing. You can type 150 words per
&gt;&gt; minute ... I can type as fast as I can think, you say.

&gt;&gt; So, using your figures you can think at about 150 words per minute, or
&gt;&gt; about 0.400 seconds, or 400 milliseconds, per word.

&gt;&gt; As reporting in the May 25 Proceedings of the National Academy of the
&gt;&gt; Sciences, the speed of thought is around 300 milliseconds. That's how
&gt;&gt; long it took a volunteer to begin to understand a pictured object.

&gt;The speed of thought is not measured in words. Thought happens without
&gt;words. If I stick a pin into you there are no words involved with your
&gt;realization of pain. You don't have to think &quot;ouch&quot; in order to feel the
&gt;pain. So there goes your somewhat convoluted argument.

&gt;&gt; It appears that your comprehension is 33% lower then normal.

&gt;Got you again! What does comprehension have to do with the speed ouf
&gt;thought?
&gt;Some idiot savant might not be able to pick his nose but he can
&gt;caluclate pi to the 39th decimal place in his head. He has no
&gt;comprehension at all but he can still think. Again it makes my point
&gt;that thinking does not rely on words. Words are just a by-product of
&gt;thinking and a clumsy one at that. Add to that clumsiness verbalizing
&gt;these words prior to putting them onto paper or the screen and you've
&gt;become so inefficient that it's laughable thinking of a somebody like
&gt;Gogarthy going through the motions. A 400lb ballerina.

&gt;Wilbur Hubbardd
">

Will boy, I always knew that you were a genius so after you read this
you really should write the National Academy of Sciences and tell them
that they don't know what they are talking about. I'm sure that they
will be excited to know that they were wrong.

Yes but it would be tempting fate a little too much if we started

Whoa!  I have a Selectric!  Mine even has a serial interface!...(c;

My favorite typing machine is a huge Olympia office manual machine made

weight.)  You don't have to worry about it sliding across the desk..(c;
I paid $5 for it in a thrift shop about 10 years ago.

I used to own an IBM System 34 computer system, given to me by the
Catholic Church who needed the warehouse space.  It came from a textile
mill.  I had all the O/S and software for small manufacturing to run on
it.  We even found a warehouse with 3-phase 208VAC to plug it into.
Noone thought it would boot.  It ran fine and still had the accounting
system data on its hard drives.  I had 6 dumb terminals, dual huge hard
drives, 8&quot; floppy drive and the massive chain printer that could eat a
box of Z-fold paper in under an hour, sounding something like a 747
crashing into the trees...(c;  Needing the warehouse space, myself, after
the novelty of it wore off, we rolled it unceremoniously into a dumpster
after stripping it of some great parts and huge power supply capacitors.
The dumpster truck struggled to pick it up...(c;
