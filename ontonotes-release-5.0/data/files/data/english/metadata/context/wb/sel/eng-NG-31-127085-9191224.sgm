Hi people

I just looked in to see how everyone is doing and it seems very
slow on here, with some questionable posts.

I do hope that Betsy is doing ok with treatment.

My life has been in bed again due to continuing very severe
breathing problems - am told it's a combination of asthma and
allergies - who knows really - I just want to breath.  The steroid
shots help but don't last very long.

Been experiencing really bad night sweats and have to change bedding
and sleep clothes every couple of hours as they are soaked.  Thhe
weather here has turned into autum overnight and it's only in the 70s
F now so these sweats are not down to the climate.

Much of the pain I have been experiencing in my computer chair
is not due to the chair.  It has been confirmed that I have lymph
mets - I sort of suspected this but it was a shock to get the
confirmation.  The lymph nodes affected are under both arms
and in my back.  They hurt a lot.
A few months ago the groin lymph nodes were enlarged they
are now feeling normal, so perhaps the same will happen with
these pains in my back.

I really hope that I feel better soon and am able to function
again, as the house is almost finished and I have things to do to
get it ready to move into, getting it furnished and so on, then
the big move.  In my present condition this is impossible to
contemplate let alone carry through.  So I am praying for an
upturn in health and abilities by the end of this month.

I can't help but wonder if this is it sometimes.  Does anyone know if
the lymph node mets are a sign of a nearing end of the road?  Or is it
possible to live for a while yet with lymph node involvement?

Just know it's important to continue to try and push forward.

Sorry this was not more cheery, I always feel that I am suposed to be
happy and full of sunshine, but sometimes I just don't feel it, and
that's when I hibernate.
All the best
Isi

Isi, I am doing just fine so far on the treatments. They are zapping the
devil out of me. Feels warm inside after? Never had that before. I asked and
yes they increased the rads a bunch. Since I don't speak their language I
didn't ask how many. I really don't care if the job gets done and it has 5
times in the past.
Feeling so much bettter. Husband is dragging from the appts daily. Poor
fella. All in all, life is pain free and good. I wonder if a recliner might
help your back on the computer? Sit sideways.

According to cancerbacup,
http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/QAs/LivingwithcancerQAs/Controllingsym...
some types of cancer do often cause drenching sweats, which often tend to
be worse at night. These are most common with lymphomas (non-Hodgkin
lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma), carcinoid tumours and also when a
secondary cancer has spread to involve the liver.

http://www.hospiceworld.org/book/sweating.htm
Heavy sweats, especially night sweats, can occur in a variety of
cancers, but are especially common in:
*Lymphomas
*  Mesothelioma
*  Small (oat) cell carcinoma of the bronchus

When the lymph nodes kicked up a fuss with Penny and Jonboy, it was the
liver.
One of the two pages, above, mentions to replace salts and fluids

One or both mention that morphine-based painkillers increase the chance of
sweating attacks.
So too anxiety.
So too an infection; urinary, infected bed sores, (examples).
That being on a steroid can mask a fever. To have bloodwork taken and
antibiotic if there's infection.

I have 2 friends with severe allergy and asthma problems. One told me this
year's is expected to be worse.
Neither has the breathing problems you have (yet), nor sweating, nor
swollen lymph nodes.

Thanks for the update, Isi.
Hugs
J

Sorry to hear you are not feeling great. Has the doctor checked your
Oxygen saturation ( O2 Sat) ?  You may need Oxygen, do you have access
to home oxygen?  It can make a big difference. Some people fight
getting home oxygen but feel much better when they have it.

How are you cats doing?

Hi Betsy,  I am so pleased that things are working out for you,
and that warm feeling is worth it, wow pain free and feeling
better that ain't bad - nice one :-)  I am sure hubby can cope to
keep you with him.

I do sit in a recliner and have keyboard on my lap, but this is a
very old recliner - past it's best, not very mobile when I have to
lean forward so it's great exercise for my tummy muscles, but I
end up hunched over my knees not a pretty sight.  Am waiting
to move before I set myself up with a new PC corner.

Thanks for the wonderful news you made me feel so happy for
you.

Hi J,

Thanks for the info I don't think my cancer is one of those as
it's an epithelial sp cancer adenocarcinoma - can't spell today.
I have been trying to keep up the fluids drinking loads of juice
and eating grapes.
My Dr said the lymph node swelling was mets, do you think it's
possible it's just swelling cause Im not feeling so good right
now.  He examined my back with his hands, no other tests.
would mets and swelling feel the same do you think?

Oh I hope this year is not worse for asthma and allergies wish
your friends a happy breathing season for me.
It's really frightening when unable to breath.

Hi Alex,
The cats are almost settled, but have a trust issue
with one of them she thinks I am about to put her in her box
again so is very wary of me, unless I am sitting or in bed.  They
have both been very attentive nurses during this breathing crisis
and watch me cough.
I don't know what the neighbours think Im doing in the middle of
the night with all this breathing and heavy panting and I can't
help the moaning sounds, it's quite embarrassing lol.

My feeling is that I'm low on oxygen - I even increased my vit C
to try and get more haemoglobin moving, but it makes no
difference that I can tell.  Keep getting splitting headaches, not
something I normally get.

How is a O2 Sat test done?  I will ask for one.  If having
oxygen at home would help me breath I would have no
problems having it. If I can find it to buy it.   But would I have to
use it all the time, can't see myself dragging a canister of oxygen
around with me if I go out. But it's reaching a place now where I
can't go out much anyway as I can't stand straight and breath so must
do something drastic I think.

All the best

O2 sat is a clippy thing like a clothespin they slip on one of your fingers
or ear lobe. sats can be gotten from either location. My son has cruddy
circulation so the ear lobe works better on him. I know it is not the norm
and don't need any correcting. Thanks anyway.

Yes.

I'd be hardpressed to find an allergy map for the country you're in.
But Google gives me one of the US and the middle of America heading up our way is higher in weed pollen
and mold (low in grass and tree pollen).
Yes, thanks, hopefully it won't be too bad this year.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry to hear you are not feeling great. Has the doctor checked your
&gt; &gt;&gt; Oxygen saturation ( O2 Sat) ?  You may need Oxygen, do you have access
&gt; &gt;&gt; to home oxygen?  It can make a big difference. Some people fight
&gt; &gt;&gt; getting home oxygen but feel much better when they have it.

&gt; &gt;&gt; How are you cats doing?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Alex

&gt; &gt; Hi Alex,
&gt; &gt; The cats are almost settled, but have a trust issue
&gt; &gt; with one of them she thinks I am about to put her in her box
&gt; &gt; again so is very wary of me, unless I am sitting or in bed.  They
&gt; &gt; have both been very attentive nurses during this breathing crisis
&gt; &gt; and watch me cough.
&gt; &gt; I don't know what the neighbours think Im doing in the middle of
&gt; &gt; the night with all this breathing and heavy panting and I can't
&gt; &gt; help the moaning sounds, it's quite embarrassing lol.

&gt; &gt; My feeling is that I'm low on oxygen - I even increased my vit C
&gt; &gt; to try and get more haemoglobin moving, but it makes no
&gt; &gt; difference that I can tell.  Keep getting splitting headaches, not
&gt; &gt; something I normally get.

&gt; &gt; How is a O2 Sat test done?  I will ask for one.  If having
&gt; &gt; oxygen at home would help me breath I would have no
&gt; &gt; problems having it. If I can find it to buy it.   But would I have to
&gt; &gt; use it all the time, can't see myself dragging a canister of oxygen
&gt; &gt; around with me if I go out. But it's reaching a place now where I
&gt; &gt; can't go out much anyway as I can't stand straight and breath so must
&gt; &gt; do something drastic I think.

&gt; &gt; All the best
&gt; &gt; Isi

&gt; O2 sat is a clippy thing like a clothespin they slip on one of your fingers
&gt; or ear lobe. sats can be gotten from either location. My son has cruddy
&gt; circulation so the ear lobe works better on him. I know it is not the norm
&gt; and don't need any correcting. Thanks anyway.

Is that a real box or a carrier?  You will need to transport both when you
move.
I would suggest an ***airplane compliant carrier; hopefully has slats (or
holes) along the sides.
Different scenery; different odor.
Leave it with door open. Throw some treats in it once in a while.
Put some rattly toys in it; a feather; use something long and soft to poke
through the holes to play with one or the other, so they get comfy seeing it
and thinking it's part of the new furniture.
I put straws, one (end) into the other to make about a 2 foot straw (and
scotch tape the join spots).
Cat likes to play with.
Day of move, don't let them eat or drink much in hours before; entice her
into the box with a treat, then close the door and put in the vehicle away
from moving hubub.
At the other end, leave in vehicle until moving hubub - movers have gone -
make sure no cubby holes where they can escape or something that might injure
them. Then get litter food water ready, let them out to explore when quiet.

Worked for our moves.
This one here hides under the head of the waterbed. Impossible to get her
out. Unless I push the vacumm cleaner hose along in there to scare her, which
I don't want to do, because then starts a race around every room and hidey
hole she can find. And not good for her health either.
So I put the carrier out 2 or 3 days earlier, with a towel or something
absorbant on the bottom. Then we both ignore it.
Day/time to take her, I grab her and stuff her in it ! lol
You probably won't be able to do that, that's why I suggest the lull her into
it being another hidey place for her/close door on her as quick as possible.

** airplane compliant because they'll be going to California.

Liquid morphine might be helpful, for some situations.
Taken 20 - 30 minutes before you have to do somethng strenuous.

&gt; &gt; &gt; According to cancerbacup, http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/QAs/LivingwithcancerQAs/Controllingsym ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; some types of cancer do often cause drenching sweats, which often tend to
&gt; &gt; &gt; be worse at night. These are most common with lymphomas (non-Hodgkin
&gt; &gt; &gt; lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma), carcinoid tumours and also when a
&gt; &gt; &gt; secondary cancer has spread to involve the liver.

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.hospiceworld.org/book/sweating.htm
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Heavy sweats, especially night sweats, can occur in a variety of
&gt; &gt; &gt; cancers, but are especially common in:
&gt; &gt; &gt;     *Lymphomas
&gt; &gt; &gt;     *  Mesothelioma
&gt; &gt; &gt;     *  Small (oat) cell carcinoma of the bronchus

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the info I don't think my cancer is one of those as
&gt; &gt; it's an epithelial sp cancer adenocarcinoma - can't spell today.

&gt; Many common adult cancers can spread to the liver.

&gt; &gt; I have been trying to keep up the fluids drinking loads of juice
&gt; &gt; and eating grapes.
&gt; &gt; My Dr said the lymph node swelling was mets, do you think it's
&gt; &gt; possible it's just swelling cause Im not feeling so good right
&gt; &gt; now.  He examined my back with his hands, no other tests.
&gt; &gt; would mets and swelling feel the same do you think?

&gt; Yes.
&gt; Penny thought it was her lymph nodes and some of it was, but some of it was her liver.
&gt; If I recall correctly, it got clarified when she had a scan in preparation for radiation therapy of the
&gt; area.

&gt; &gt; Oh I hope this year is not worse for asthma and allergies wish
&gt; &gt; your friends a happy breathing season for me.
&gt; &gt; It's really frightening when unable to breath.

&gt; I'd be hardpressed to find an allergy map for the country you're in.
&gt; But Google gives me one of the US and the middle of America heading up our way is higher in weed pollen
&gt; and mold (low in grass and tree pollen).
&gt; Yes, thanks, hopefully it won't be too bad this year.
&gt; And hugs back to you, luv

Thanks J,

Interesting it turned out to be the liver for Penny and a little
worrying as I have had some liver pain of late.  Do you have the link
for her blog, I lost it.

I dismissed the liver pain as I have been taking so many antibiotics
the past few months and all the pain killers so thought it was down to
too many toxins in my system.

A year ago the only pills I took were 'organic' vitamins and minerals
and I felt so much better then.  Even my body odor seems to have
become more chemical if that makes sense.

Thanks for the Hugs :-) Big Hugs

&gt; Been experiencing really bad night sweats and have to change bedding

&gt; and in my back.  They hurt a lot.
&gt; A few months ago the groin lymph nodes were enlarged they

Isi,
I had a pleural effusion which took my breath away and also have asthma, so
I know how you feel.  I hope you can find oxygen wherever you are and
hopefully they give you one larger tank for your bedside (or computer-side)
and one carry-type in case you need to go out with it.  I am doing better so
turned my equipment back in, but I kept the small carry size just because it
makes me feel safe to have it.  I think stress/anxiety can add to the
breathing problems sometimes and they gave me Xanax in case that happens.  I
wonder if that would help you too.  When you can't breath your muscles
tighten in your shoulders and chest and makes breathing much more difficult.
Are they checking your blood sugar with all those steroid shots?  Everytime
I got a steroid shot they would check my blood sugar and sure enough they
had to give me insulin (I am not diabetic).  Also I believe steroids can
increase body fluids and also add to breathlessness.  It is a vicious
circle.  Do you have inhalers?

Hugs to you dear Isi.  You are in my thoughts and prayers.

Most hospitals when they check the  a patients (TPR..temp, pulse and
resp) they do an O2 sat. Usually if the Sat is less than the mid 80's,
02 is needed.

Cats are funny, they are not trusting yet they are sensitive when you

Her blog is here, luv
http://pensclc.blogspot.com/
She was in San Francisico with Fig (end of April) and it's after returning that she started having pain and
detected some lumps.
In her abdomen. Her GP examined her, then I think she later had to go to ER (emergency) for pain. i can't
quite remember when that was. I think it was after the RR that she got an appointment with the oncologist but
they did nothing at first and she had to put pressure on them (and/or her GP got involved)  that she had
scans and radiotherapy.
By checking Google, it looks like June through beginning of October where the liver was discussed.
&lt;
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Penny+liver+group%3Aalt.support.can...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I think she also had a stent put in.

The liver can also cause pain in the back. On the other hand, it could just be lymph nodes, at this time?
My understanding, which could be wrong, is that jaundice only happens when a good part of liver is no longer
functioning from cancer and/or scarring (cirrhosis) and/or there's a blockage.  They can tell from the
bloodwork as well, but not necessarily at the beginning.

Hi, Isi,

I have been gone a lot &amp; have missed you.

From reading this thread...how far away is the place you are moving to
from where you are now?  I had thought close.  Are you in the place with
the chickens under?

About the oxygen, there are several kinds of things that can be used.
Here, the giant tanks on wheels are rarely used anymore.  For around the
house, we had a rather large machine that compressed oxygen out of the
air &amp; added moisture.  It flowed through a tubing system.  Socks could
go anywhere in our house &amp; even out on the patio without carrying any
equipment. If you watch his video, you can see how he moved through the
house with his tubing.  I'll look up the link &amp; post. For going out, we
had a large cannister of compressed oxygen that we used to fill up an
array of oxygen containers for the road.  The smaller ones were like
little fanny packs.  There were other things, but those 2 covered most
situations. He used his for comfort, not really a medical necessity, but
he didn't like being without it.  We do live at altitude which makes
some difference.  He did better at sea level - a good excuse for
cruises.

I have my first little girl kitty ever.  My Bartholomew fell instantly
in love with Tabitha.  I am watching him bathe her &amp; snuggle her.  If
she mews, th runs over &amp; puts a paw around her neck &amp; gives her a head
bath. She is only a couple of months younger than he but very tiny. Very
sweet to watch &amp; good to see him so happy.He keeps coming over to give
me 'thank you' hugs.

Tracey,

Thanks for your reply, it's really interesting to learn of your

experience asthma and lung problems are a double whammy.  I

can relate to all you said I too hunch up my shoulders so bad

that I now have a pain in my neck through doing that.  I have

some diazapam and took 2.5mg of it to try and relax then

reading online that diazapam is a respitorary inhibitor so

decided not to do that again.  I tried to bring up the insulin with

the doctor today but it was difficult as he was working alone,

very busy and focused on getting me another steroid shot - I

am not too happy about taking these shots all the time as I

read that they can leach calcium from the bones.  It's all a

balancing act as you say.

I do use inhalers Becotide and Ventalin, they don't really help if

things get bad.
I asked about a canister of O2 to have at home, he does not

know where to get them.  Who supplies them in your country?
He does agree it would be a good idea for me to have one for

use in a crisis.
I am very pleased you no longer need yours thats a really good

move forward and an optimistic sign for me.

Take care and thanks again,  Hugs back for you and thank you

so much for remembering me in your prayers.  I do believe and

pray for everyone here, I know prayer makes a positive

difference in our lives...
Hugs
Isi

&gt; &gt; use it all the time, can't see myself dragging a canister of oxygen
&gt; &gt; around with me if I go out. But it's reaching a place now where I
&gt; &gt; can't go out much anyway as I can't stand straight and breath so must
&gt; &gt; do something drastic I think.

&gt; Most hospitals when they check the  a patients (TPR..temp, pulse and
&gt; resp) they do an O2 sat. Usually if the Sat is less than the mid 80's,
&gt; 02 is needed.

&gt; Cats are funny, they are not trusting yet they are sensitive when you
&gt; are ill.

Alex,
thanks for the links interesting maybe I can buy one here.  They did
not have one at the clinic today.
My Dr says my O2 levels are low he can tell by looking at my nails,
this is the land of low tech medicine and observant doctors.
As I wrote to Tracey he (my doc) does not know where to find O2 I find
that strange, it means that people here don't get it in there homes
normally, may be they go into hospital.
I suggested he ask at the pharmacy and the hospital for me, so I can
buy one, do you think I am on the right track?   I need to learn how
to use it correctly - somewhere I have picked up the info that too
much O2 can be as bad as too little, but maybe my memory is playing
tricks.
The only 'bad' thing I ever did to my cats is put them in a pet
carrier and on a plane to bring them here.  They came to me
traumatised by humans as semi feral rescue cats.  They have lived with
me for about 5 years, and only now trust that I will not squirt my
asthma inhalers at them, they used to run fast and hide, if I had an
inhaler in my hand, now they don't take any notice.  I think they have
PTSD from kitten hood.  I love them dearly, I just wish they were not
so damaged, they hide and play possum if another human comes on to our
territory, and will hide for a week if I have a house guest.

Big Hugs
Isi

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the info I don't think my cancer is one of those as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's an epithelial sp cancer adenocarcinoma - can't spell today.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Many common adult cancers can spread to the liver.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have been trying to keep up the fluids drinking loads of juice
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and eating grapes.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My Dr said the lymph node swelling was mets, do you think it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible it's just swelling cause Im not feeling so good right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now.  He examined my back with his hands, no other tests.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would mets and swelling feel the same do you think?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Penny thought it was her lymph nodes and some of it was, but some of it was her liver.
&gt; &gt; &gt; If I recall correctly, it got clarified when she had a scan in preparation for radiation therapy of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; area.

&gt; &gt; [allergy..]

&gt; &gt; Thanks J,

&gt; &gt; Interesting it turned out to be the liver for Penny and a little
&gt; &gt; worrying as I have had some liver pain of late.  Do you have the link
&gt; &gt; for her blog, I lost it.

&gt; Her blog is here, luv http://pensclc.blogspot.com/
&gt; She was in San Francisico with Fig (end of April) and it's after returning that she started having pain and
&gt; detected some lumps.
&gt; In her abdomen. Her GP examined her, then I think she later had to go to ER (emergency) for pain. i can't
&gt; quite remember when that was. I think it was after the RR that she got an appointment with the oncologist but
&gt; they did nothing at first and she had to put pressure on them (and/or her GP got involved)  that she had
&gt; scans and radiotherapy.
&gt; By checking Google, it looks like June through beginning of October where the liver was discussed.
&gt; &lt; http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Penny+liver+group%3Aalt.support.can ...

&gt; I think she also had a stent put in.

&gt; The liver can also cause pain in the back. On the other hand, it could just be lymph nodes, at this time?
&gt; My understanding, which could be wrong, is that jaundice only happens when a good part of liver is no longer
&gt; functioning from cancer and/or scarring (cirrhosis) and/or there's a blockage.  They can tell from the
&gt; bloodwork as well, but not necessarily at the beginning.

&gt; &gt; I dismissed the liver pain as I have been taking so many antibiotics
&gt; &gt; the past few months and all the pain killers so thought it was down to
&gt; &gt; too many toxins in my system.

&gt; &gt; A year ago the only pills I took were 'organic' vitamins and minerals
&gt; &gt; and I felt so much better then.  Even my body odor seems to have
&gt; &gt; become more chemical if that makes sense.

&gt; Yes, that's been mentioned before here. I'm sorry you're going through this Isi.
&gt; If I was there, I'd give you a gentle hug (or two or three)
&gt; J

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the Hugs :-) Big Hugs

Hi J,

Went to the doctor and had an xray the news is not so good,

well I guess to be expected really - the cancer has spread into

the other lung, there are spots and shadows in the base of the

lung, and near the central side.  He did tell me it's slow growing

and for that I am grateful.  I do so want to enjoy some time in

my new home with the cats before things get worse.  They are

quite bad now.  Hopefully I have found a cleaner for this

apartment she will start tomorrow - this will help me a lot and

keep the dust down, so may help with the breathing as well - I

don't have enough energy to do a proper house clean myself

any more and it builds up over the months a 'that will have to

do' as Isi runs out of energy dragging the vacuum cleaner

around.

I have a spare steroid shot so if things get too difficult I am to

give it to myself.  He has also prescribed something called

&quot;Aminophylline&quot; 100mg to help breathing I took one and was ok

then I took another and started to shake and feel very odd, so

have not taken any more but today the steroid injection is

wearing off I think so I may try another of the breathing pills.
Now my quest for Oxygen begins, I will feel safer if I have

some and can have a whiff of it when unable to catch enough

air.  It's getting to the point where I am scared to go to sleep at

night in case I awaken unable to breath, which I have been

doing at around 2-3 am each night for the past couple of weeks

or a bit more.   I lose track of time these days.

Re cat post
Yes their boxes are airline compliant boxes, they travelled here

via British Airways and it totally freaked them out as far as the

boxes are concerned.  The boxes live on the bedroom floor but

they refuse to go inside and kind of walk sideways around

them.  I will try the straw game - but don't hold out much hope.

When we went to the mountains it was very difficult catching

them.

I caught number one placed her in her box and secured it.

started to catch number two.  Number one broke out of box,

pushed the door off it's hinges.  I then had to get them from

under the couches, remember through all this Im panting like an

old dog eventually I had to turn all the furniture on its side so

the had only one place they could go under - too heavy for me

to turn on it's side, I then used a brolly to sort of hook them out.
After all that it took me about an hour and a half to catch my

breath.

The guy who was driving me arrived and was stunned at the

chaos,he helped me to return all the furniture to it's proper

place before we left.  It was a repeat performance on leaving

the mountains - Once they hear another human they play

possum, they are really afraid of all humans except me.  So

what I may do when I move is ask someone to help me catch

them, I don't want to be mean to them, but really I just don't

have the puff or the energy to start throwing the furniture

around.  It's very traumatic for the three of us, as I think I said

before they both had a problem childhood and those scars are

there forever I think.   At the moment they are hypervigelent,

even if I close a door to one of the rooms.

After the move hopefully we will be able to settle down and

hibernate for the winter in some degree of comfort ( the

apartment is not very comfortable as far as sitting around goes

I only meant to stay here for a month or two.)   and I will have

a bath, a real big bath that I can soak in for hours whilst looking

out the window at the distant Turkish forest and mountain, can't

wait. Tehe  (Oh I do have a shower here in the apartment but

it's not the same as sitting in bubbles.)

Thanks so much for the link to Penny's blog she was a brave lady,
It's sad that she did not have better pain control during those last
days and weeks.

Big hugs
Isi

&gt; &gt; A few months ago the groin lymph nodes were enlarged they

&gt; &gt; I really hope that I feel better soon and am able to function

&gt; &gt; Just know it's important to continue to try and push forward.

&gt; Hi, Isi,

&gt; I have been gone a lot &amp; have missed you.

&gt; From reading this thread...how far away is the place you are moving to
&gt; from where you are now?  I had thought close.  Are you in the place with
&gt; the chickens under?

&gt; About the oxygen, there are several kinds of things that can be used.
&gt; Here, the giant tanks on wheels are rarely used anymore.  For around the
&gt; house, we had a rather large machine that compressed oxygen out of the
&gt; air &amp; added moisture.  It flowed through a tubing system.  Socks could
&gt; go anywhere in our house &amp; even out on the patio without carrying any
&gt; equipment. If you watch his video, you can see how he moved through the
&gt; house with his tubing.  I'll look up the link &amp; post. For going out, we
&gt; had a large cannister of compressed oxygen that we used to fill up an
&gt; array of oxygen containers for the road.  The smaller ones were like
&gt; little fanny packs.  There were other things, but those 2 covered most
&gt; situations. He used his for comfort, not really a medical necessity, but
&gt; he didn't like being without it.  We do live at altitude which makes
&gt; some difference.  He did better at sea level - a good excuse for
&gt; cruises.

&gt; I have my first little girl kitty ever.  My Bartholomew fell instantly
&gt; in love with Tabitha.  I am watching him bathe her &amp; snuggle her.  If
&gt; she mews, th runs over &amp; puts a paw around her neck &amp; gives her a head
&gt; bath. She is only a couple of months younger than he but very tiny. Very
&gt; sweet to watch &amp; good to see him so happy.He keeps coming over to give
&gt; me 'thank you' hugs.

&gt; video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tCVswu4XfA

&gt; Take good care, isi,

Hi Fig,

Yes the house is near here about 15-20 minutes drive from

where I am now, in the same municipality.  The cockerel and

hens have moved on :-) from here so no more early

doodledoos - I bet I get them when I move, though it will be

natural in the country side, my new neighbour there has hens,

ducks, geese, goats, and what else I will discover.

Thanks for the info about the O2 Socks used, what a wonderful

system, with the tubing he could move about so freely must

have made a huge difference to his quality of life.  He looks

quite agile in the video.

This is a whole new world for me never bought a gas before,

nor it seems has my doctor so it will be the blind leading the

blind, every beam of light is so welcome 0 don't want to blow

myself up or get the wrong stuff.  I wonder if the O2 divers use

would be the same, might be able to find that on the coast.  I

guess one needs to know about pressure and so on.
Ahhhh I just remembered my builder studied marine biology,

and scuba dives, one day he told me he knows how to build a

tanking room - not too sure what that is.  Something to do with

diving i think.  Ah Fig, you have set off a train of thought on this.

I will ask him, he may know.  Perhaps there is a potential biz

here providing medical O2 to all the people who need it. I was

wondering what to do with the barn :-)

Back down to earth, how did you get it? from Hospice or from

a gas company?

Big Hugs
Isi

&gt; &gt; &gt;  Isi

&gt; &gt; Isi,
&gt; &gt; I had a pleural effusion which took my breath away and also have asthma,
so
&gt; &gt; I know how you feel.  I hope you can find oxygen wherever you are and
&gt; &gt; hopefully they give you one larger tank for your bedside (or
computer-side)
&gt; &gt; and one carry-type in case you need to go out with it.  I am doing
better so
&gt; &gt; turned my equipment back in, but I kept the small carry size just
because it
&gt; &gt; makes me feel safe to have it.  I think stress/anxiety can add to the
&gt; &gt; breathing problems sometimes and they gave me Xanax in case that
happens.  I
&gt; &gt; wonder if that would help you too.  When you can't breath your muscles
&gt; &gt; tighten in your shoulders and chest and makes breathing much more
difficult.
&gt; &gt; Are they checking your blood sugar with all those steroid shots?
Everytime
&gt; &gt; I got a steroid shot they would check my blood sugar and sure enough
they
&gt; &gt; had to give me insulin (I am not diabetic).  Also I believe steroids can
&gt; &gt; increase body fluids and also add to breathlessness.  It is a vicious
&gt; &gt; circle.  Do you have inhalers?

&gt; &gt; Hugs to you dear Isi.  You are in my thoughts and prayers.

&gt; &gt; Tracey- Hide quoted text -

&gt; Tracey,

&gt; Thanks for your reply, it's really interesting to learn of your

&gt; experience asthma and lung problems are a double whammy.  I

&gt; can relate to all you said I too hunch up my shoulders so bad

&gt; that I now have a pain in my neck through doing that.  I have

&gt; some diazapam and took 2.5mg of it to try and relax then

&gt; reading online that diazapam is a respitorary inhibitor so

&gt; decided not to do that again.  I tried to bring up the insulin with

&gt; the doctor today but it was difficult as he was working alone,

&gt; very busy and focused on getting me another steroid shot - I

&gt; am not too happy about taking these shots all the time as I

&gt; read that they can leach calcium from the bones.  It's all a

&gt; balancing act as you say.

&gt; I do use inhalers Becotide and Ventalin, they don't really help if

&gt; things get bad.
&gt; I asked about a canister of O2 to have at home, he does not

&gt; know where to get them.  Who supplies them in your country?
&gt; He does agree it would be a good idea for me to have one for

&gt; use in a crisis.
&gt; I am very pleased you no longer need yours thats a really good

&gt; move forward and an optimistic sign for me.

&gt; Take care and thanks again,  Hugs back for you and thank you

&gt; so much for remembering me in your prayers.  I do believe and

&gt; pray for everyone here, I know prayer makes a positive

&gt; difference in our lives...
&gt; Hugs

Hi Isi,
Your new home sounds wonderful.  I cannot wait until you can move to the
country and enjoy its peacefullness.

As far as the oxygen goes - I get mine from a medical supply place and they
came every few weeks to trade tanks.  Maybe a local hospital could tell you
where to get it from?  Maybe a respiratory therapist?  I also saw one of
them and learned how to breath the correct way and how to do my inhalers the
correct way.  You do need a little instruction on pressure, turning valves
on/off and possibly your own little oxygen saturation meter (goes on your
finger and tells you what your oxygen level in your blood is) as you
definately do not want too much.  I got mine on eBay for quite a savings:
Mine is called:  Finger Oximeter, made by Smith Medical, phone (44)
1923-246434.  Consider a massage therapist for your neck muscles; it makes a
big difference in your breathing if you can relax Isi.  What about a glass
of red wine to relax?  I do not know where you are Isi, but I hope you are
able to find some relief with your breathing.  It has to play a huge role in
your healing.  I wish I could be there to help you.

Hugs,
Tracey

I don't think the diver's oxygen is the same since it is for healthy people
underwater. Also the tanks are very heavy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_tank

Do you have a local hospital? I would call them and ask where they purchase
their oxygen.

An O2 compressor,  like Socks used would be helpful since you don't have to
refill the system like O2 tanks.

I just had another thought, what about ambulances....they need it to
transport patients and they would know of people who are home on O2.

&gt;&gt; from where you are now?  I had thought close.  Are you in the place
with
&gt;&gt; the chickens under?

&gt;&gt; About the oxygen, there are several kinds of things that can be used.
&gt;&gt; Here, the giant tanks on wheels are rarely used anymore.  For around
the
&gt;&gt; house, we had a rather large machine that compressed oxygen out of
the
&gt;&gt; air &amp; added moisture.  It flowed through a tubing system.  Socks
could
&gt;&gt; go anywhere in our house &amp; even out on the patio without carrying any
&gt;&gt; equipment. If you watch his video, you can see how he moved through
the
&gt;&gt; house with his tubing.  I'll look up the link &amp; post. For going out,
we
&gt;&gt; had a large cannister of compressed oxygen that we used to fill up an
&gt;&gt; array of oxygen containers for the road.  The smaller ones were like
&gt;&gt; little fanny packs.  There were other things, but those 2 covered
most
&gt;&gt; situations. He used his for comfort, not really a medical necessity,
but
&gt;&gt; he didn't like being without it.  We do live at altitude which makes
&gt;&gt; some difference.  He did better at sea level - a good excuse for
&gt;&gt; cruises.

&gt;&gt; I have my first little girl kitty ever.  My Bartholomew fell
instantly
&gt;&gt; in love with Tabitha.  I am watching him bathe her &amp; snuggle her.  If
&gt;&gt; she mews, th runs over &amp; puts a paw around her neck &amp; gives her a
head
&gt;&gt; bath. She is only a couple of months younger than he but very tiny.
Very
&gt;&gt; sweet to watch &amp; good to see him so happy.He keeps coming over to
give
&gt;&gt; me 'thank you' hugs.

&gt;&gt; Take good care, isi,

&gt; Hi Fig,

&gt; Yes the house is near here about 15-20 minutes drive from

&gt; where I am now, in the same municipality.  The cockerel and

&gt; hens have moved on :-) from here so no more early

&gt; doodledoos - I bet I get them when I move, though it will be

&gt; natural in the country side, my new neighbour there has hens,

&gt; ducks, geese, goats, and what else I will discover.

&gt; Thanks for the info about the O2 Socks used, what a wonderful

&gt; system, with the tubing he could move about so freely must

&gt; have made a huge difference to his quality of life.  He looks

&gt; quite agile in the video.

&gt; This is a whole new world for me never bought a gas before,

&gt; nor it seems has my doctor so it will be the blind leading the

&gt; blind, every beam of light is so welcome 0 don't want to blow

&gt; myself up or get the wrong stuff.  I wonder if the O2 divers use

&gt; would be the same, might be able to find that on the coast.  I

&gt; guess one needs to know about pressure and so on.
&gt; Ahhhh I just remembered my builder studied marine biology,

&gt; and scuba dives, one day he told me he knows how to build a

&gt; tanking room - not too sure what that is.  Something to do with

&gt; diving i think.  Ah Fig, you have set off a train of thought on this.

&gt;   I will ask him, he may know.  Perhaps there is a potential biz

&gt; here providing medical O2 to all the people who need it. I was

&gt; wondering what to do with the barn :-)

&gt; Back down to earth, how did you get it? from Hospice or from

&gt; a gas company?

&gt; Big Hugs
&gt; Isi
">

Hi again, isi,

Maybe oxygen suppliers are not so common where you live as here.  We
have companies that specialize in home heath aids &amp; they deliver &amp;
service all the equipment.  Apria is a big one here. Initially, Sock's
medical insurance covered most of the cost (we paid a monthly co-pay).
Not very expensive here &amp; it was a flat monthly charge, regardless of
usage.  When Socks entered hospice, all of that equipment went &amp; hospice
supplied all free of charge.

The compressor was great, but it makes a lot of noise &amp; generates heat
(a plus for winter).  We kept it in a spare room with the door shut &amp;
the tubing running under the door. It was THE place to take clothes to
have the wrinkles fall out of them.

He was athletic before he got cancer.  Most years he rode his bicycle in
a huge event called Ride the Rockies where participants rode across
Colorado over many mountain passes for a week.  Not a race.  In the
video, he was maybe 3-5 weeks from death. He had aged tremendously by
then.  He was only 52 &amp; had been a fairly hefty guy.

I would love to awaken to doodle do.  In Dallas, I let a neighbor kid
raise Bob White quail in a corner of my backyard.  Those were fun to
wake up to also.  Now I have a furry alarm clock.

Warm hugs,
Fig

Can you &quot;pill &quot; them, Isi?
It might be kinder to give them a mild sedative a few hours before, rather than have all that chaoseand/or a
stranger try to catch them?  It's less stressful for everyone if you know how to do it and can.

I rather doubt that your cats broke out of a rigid plastic carrier?
http://www.petplanet.co.uk/category.asp?dept_id=39
Click on Rigid and the blue one of the left is similar to the ones I have.
I did have nicely coated cardboard cariers but the stronger cats can break out of the door or knock the hinges off.

Two did fly in them, but as the carriers ages and the cats grew stronger, it was risky to use them, so i gave them
away, (with a warning) and bought the rigid plastic ones.

If you want tips on &quot;pilling&quot; I can explain how I do it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for the info I don't think my cancer is one of those as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's an epithelial sp cancer adenocarcinoma - can't spell today.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many common adult cancers can spread to the liver.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been trying to keep up the fluids drinking loads of juice
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and eating grapes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My Dr said the lymph node swelling was mets, do you think it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possible it's just swelling cause Im not feeling so good right
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now.  He examined my back with his hands, no other tests.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would mets and swelling feel the same do you think?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Penny thought it was her lymph nodes and some of it was, but some of it was her liver.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I recall correctly, it got clarified when she had a scan in preparation for radiation therapy of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; area.

&gt;&gt;&gt; [allergy..]

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks J,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Interesting it turned out to be the liver for Penny and a little
&gt;&gt;&gt; worrying as I have had some liver pain of late.  Do you have the link
&gt;&gt;&gt; for her blog, I lost it.

&gt;&gt; Her blog is here, luv http://pensclc.blogspot.com/
&gt;&gt; She was in San Francisico with Fig (end of April) and it's after returning that she started having pain and
&gt;&gt; detected some lumps.
&gt;&gt; In her abdomen. Her GP examined her, then I think she later had to go to ER (emergency) for pain. i can't
&gt;&gt; quite remember when that was. I think it was after the RR that she got an appointment with the oncologist but
&gt;&gt; they did nothing at first and she had to put pressure on them (and/or her GP got involved)  that she had
&gt;&gt; scans and radiotherapy.
&gt;&gt; By checking Google, it looks like June through beginning of October where the liver was discussed.
&gt;&gt; &lt; http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Penny+liver+group%3Aalt.support.can ...

&gt;&gt; I think she also had a stent put in.

&gt;&gt; The liver can also cause pain in the back. On the other hand, it could just be lymph nodes, at this time?
&gt;&gt; My understanding, which could be wrong, is that jaundice only happens when a good part of liver is no longer
&gt;&gt; functioning from cancer and/or scarring (cirrhosis) and/or there's a blockage.  They can tell from the
&gt;&gt; bloodwork as well, but not necessarily at the beginning.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I dismissed the liver pain as I have been taking so many antibiotics
&gt;&gt;&gt; the past few months and all the pain killers so thought it was down to
&gt;&gt;&gt; too many toxins in my system.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A year ago the only pills I took were 'organic' vitamins and minerals
&gt;&gt;&gt; and I felt so much better then.  Even my body odor seems to have
&gt;&gt;&gt; become more chemical if that makes sense.

&gt;&gt; Yes, that's been mentioned before here. I'm sorry you're going through this Isi.
&gt;&gt; If I was there, I'd give you a gentle hug (or two or three)

&gt; Hi J,

&gt; Went to the doctor and had an xray the news is not so good,

&gt; well I guess to be expected really - the cancer has spread into

&gt; the other lung, there are spots and shadows in the base of the

&gt; lung, and near the central side.  He did tell me it's slow growing

&gt; and for that I am grateful.  I do so want to enjoy some time in

&gt; my new home with the cats before things get worse.  They are

&gt; quite bad now.  Hopefully I have found a cleaner for this

&gt; apartment she will start tomorrow - this will help me a lot and

&gt; keep the dust down, so may help with the breathing as well - I

&gt; don't have enough energy to do a proper house clean myself

&gt; any more and it builds up over the months a 'that will have to

&gt; do' as Isi runs out of energy dragging the vacuum cleaner

&gt; around.

&gt; I have a spare steroid shot so if things get too difficult I am to

&gt; give it to myself.  He has also prescribed something called

&gt; &quot;Aminophylline&quot; 100mg to help breathing I took one and was ok

&gt; then I took another and started to shake and feel very odd, so

&gt; have not taken any more but today the steroid injection is

&gt; wearing off I think so I may try another of the breathing pills.
&gt; Now my quest for Oxygen begins, I will feel safer if I have

&gt; some and can have a whiff of it when unable to catch enough

&gt; air.  It's getting to the point where I am scared to go to sleep at

&gt; night in case I awaken unable to breath, which I have been

&gt; doing at around 2-3 am each night for the past couple of weeks

&gt; or a bit more.   I lose track of time these days.

&gt; Re cat post

&gt; After the move hopefully we will be able to settle down and

&gt; hibernate for the winter in some degree of comfort ( the

&gt; apartment is not very comfortable as far as sitting around goes

&gt; I only meant to stay here for a month or two.)   and I will have

&gt; a bath, a real big bath that I can soak in for hours whilst looking

&gt; out the window at the distant Turkish forest and mountain, can't

&gt; wait. Tehe  (Oh I do have a shower here in the apartment but

&gt; it's not the same as sitting in bubbles.)

&gt; Thanks so much for the link to Penny's blog she was a brave lady,
&gt; It's sad that she did not have better pain control during those last
&gt; days and weeks.

&gt; Big hugs

Isa, have you tried Pheromone sprays or plug ins? They are very calming
for cat. I can get it from the vets here in the UK. Try asking a vet

I have to wonder if being hypoxic or cyanotic slows down the cancer.
And getting oxygen and/or breathing better helps cancers grow?
I'd want to talk to a clinical oncologist about that and what in his or her opinion could help you breath better
without encouragiing the cancer to grow, if  my hypothesis is true.

I hear you. I also have to tell you that mattresses harbor dust mites to which many are allergic.
Affects breathing.
We drop millions of dead cells daily wherever we go including in the bed.
Are you starting off with a fresh (new) mattress when you're moving?
People buy a mattress cover that dust mites cannot crawl out through and they say wash all the bedding at least
once a week.

I hear you. Much better than a shower, but (why do I have to have a but in here), you'll need something soft to lie
on, in the tub?  An air mattress would float?  And I think would be wobbly to step in onto.
There must be something at a Health Supply place or maybe someone else , here, can think of what would be best so
you're not in more pain in the tub.

As far as I know, she had the best there is, but her particular cancer was difficult to palliate.
Each person can be different so it's hard to say what will happen for you.

I wish you could see a clinical oncologst and discuss the oxygen and have him/her look at the scans tell you if
there's anything that can help you breathe some better. Judy's husband had a stent put in, but I do not know its
purpose .

Sounds like you'll be busy today. Will wait for your updates.

The weight of the big cannisters on wheels is much harder to deal with.
We had some of those when Socks was first diagnosed.  Then he didn't
need oxygen for 3 years or so.  When we got oxygen the 2nd time, the
products had changed dramatically.  The compressor was the same, but the
options for portable were greatly increased.  The fanny packs are very
light weight.  But we do not know what is available where isi is.  That

The cannisters are the legacy or old faishon way of delivering O2. They also
are a fire hazard. They need to be managed by professionals ( people who do
the behind the scenes checks).  They are also the cheaper. The technology
for the portable O2 has been available for over a decade, but expensive.  It
was available to Socks ( probably the first time) but the DME companies get
the same reimbursement so they tended to dispense the cheaper techonology.
Compressors have been around since the earlier 90's ( probably earlier).

Isi could have even better techonology since the FDA is not involved. But
considering her doctor doesn't have a oximeter or know where to get O2  I
made the leap that they wouldn't have cutting edge techonology.  J, made a
comment on a fanny pack which I believe is between 4-6 lbs. and how it may
cause back pain.
People who can't where O2 can use walkers.

Sorry Isi,  I even brought up the O2 suggestion, since it has caused more
distress to you.

Hi

This is an update on the O2 situation.  My Doctor and I went shopping
today, driving to lots of industrial estates looking for oxygen.  My
Doctor is a gem.
Anyway we eventually found some, they only have canisters in two
sizes, one  is about 5feet tall and looks like a torpedo.  Perhaps
when I move I will get that as it will last a long time.

For now I am going to get a canister thats about 2.5 feet tall, it's
blue and has a red cross on it!  Costs $3 US a month to rent, It's
being cleaned and filled, we will pick it up tomorrow.  I wanted two,
one as a spare but they only had one available and it looks pretty
ancient!    When it runs out one has to take it back to the supplier
to be refilled.  We then went to the hospital and I bought both a mask
and a canula sp (not sure which I will prefer so got both) and some
tubing.

I asked about an oximetre and sort of got laughed at - they don't have
western technology here, its country in transition.  For my own peace
of mind so I don't take too much O2 I will try to buy one off ebay or
from UK somewhere.

The Oxygen is for crisis use only, there are times when I know mine is
really low and I feel so tired and fuzzy in addition to the breathing
problems. My toes, fingertips and nail beds are pale purple, I think
when they go pink, if they go pink, I will have normal O2 levels in my
blood.  Can anyone confirm this?  Last week I became rather alarmed as
my lips started to go purple, so I stuck my head out of the window and
had the fan and the A/C blowing flat out, and boiled a large pan of
chamomile tea to moisten the air in the apartment..   The idea of
getting some O2 has been hovering around my awareness for quite a few
months, so I thank you guys for giving me a push to hustle for it.  I
do hope it helps and enables me to do more than I am able to at
present.

I do find it very strange that its so difficult to get hold of - My
doctor is a GP and has been in practice for over 20 years and this is
the first time he has done this.  I just wonder what the Bulgarians do
when they have breathing problems and need home oxygen, it's very
strange is it not a treatment here.  I searched online and it seems
'alternative oxygen therapy and ozone therapy' are available in the
spa's here.  Sorry this is off topic, it's a mystery and I have to get
to the bottom of it.

Thanks for all your support, valuable information, and the kick on the
butt &lt;g&gt; to get me moving on this. :-)

I found this last night it may be useful to someone else going down
this path.

&gt;&gt; The weight of the big cannisters on wheels is much harder to deal with.
&gt;&gt; We had some of those when Socks was first diagnosed.  Then he didn't
&gt;&gt; need oxygen for 3 years or so.  When we got oxygen the 2nd time, the
&gt;&gt; products had changed dramatically.  The compressor was the same, but the
&gt;&gt; options for portable were greatly increased.  The fanny packs are very
&gt;&gt; light weight.  But we do not know what is available where isi is.  That
&gt;&gt; will dictate what she uses.

&gt;&gt; Fig

&gt; The cannisters are the legacy or old faishon way of delivering O2. They
&gt; also are a fire hazard. They need to be managed by professionals ( people
&gt; who do the behind the scenes checks).  They are also the cheaper. The
&gt; technology for the portable O2 has been available for over a decade, but
&gt; expensive.  It was available to Socks ( probably the first time) but the
&gt; DME companies get the same reimbursement so they tended to dispense the
&gt; cheaper techonology. Compressors have been around since the earlier 90's
&gt; ( probably earlier).

&gt; Isi could have even better techonology since the FDA is not involved. But
&gt; considering her doctor doesn't have a oximeter or know where to get O2  I
&gt; made the leap that they wouldn't have cutting edge techonology.  J, made a
&gt; comment on a fanny pack which I believe is between 4-6 lbs. and how it may
&gt; cause back pain.
&gt; People who can't where O2 can use walkers.

&gt; Sorry Isi,  I even brought up the O2 suggestion, since it has caused more
&gt; distress to you.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for the info I don't think my cancer is one of those as
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's an epithelial sp cancer adenocarcinoma - can't spell today.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many common adult cancers can spread to the liver.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been trying to keep up the fluids drinking loads of juice
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and eating grapes.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My Dr said the lymph node swelling was mets, do you think it's
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possible it's just swelling cause Im not feeling so good right
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now.  He examined my back with his hands, no other tests.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would mets and swelling feel the same do you think?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Penny thought it was her lymph nodes and some of it was, but some of it was her liver.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I recall correctly, it got clarified when she had a scan in preparation for radiation therapy of the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; area.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; [allergy..]

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks J,

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Interesting it turned out to be the liver for Penny and a little
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; worrying as I have had some liver pain of late.  Do you have the link
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for her blog, I lost it.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Her blog is here, luv http://pensclc.blogspot.com/
&gt; &gt;&gt; She was in San Francisico with Fig (end of April) and it's after returning that she started having pain and
&gt; &gt;&gt; detected some lumps.
&gt; &gt;&gt; In her abdomen. Her GP examined her, then I think she later had to go to ER (emergency) for pain. i can't
&gt; &gt;&gt; quite remember when that was. I think it was after the RR that she got an appointment with the oncologist but
&gt; &gt;&gt; they did nothing at first and she had to put pressure on them (and/or her GP got involved)  that she had
&gt; &gt;&gt; scans and radiotherapy.
&gt; &gt;&gt; By checking Google, it looks like June through beginning of October where the liver was discussed.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt; http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Penny+liver+group%3Aalt.support.can ...

&gt; &gt;&gt; I think she also had a stent put in.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The liver can also cause pain in the back. On the other hand, it could just be lymph nodes, at this time?
&gt; &gt;&gt; My understanding, which could be wrong, is that jaundice only happens when a good part of liver is no longer
&gt; &gt;&gt; functioning from cancer and/or scarring (cirrhosis) and/or there's a blockage.  They can tell from the
&gt; &gt;&gt; bloodwork as well, but not necessarily at the beginning.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I dismissed the liver pain as I have been taking so many antibiotics
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the past few months and all the pain killers so thought it was down to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; too many toxins in my system.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; A year ago the only pills I took were 'organic' vitamins and minerals
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and I felt so much better then.  Even my body odor seems to have
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; become more chemical if that makes sense.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, that's been mentioned before here. I'm sorry you're going through this Isi.
&gt; &gt;&gt; If I was there, I'd give you a gentle hug (or two or three)
&gt; &gt;&gt; J

&gt; &gt; Hi J,

&gt; &gt; Went to the doctor and had an xray the news is not so good,

&gt; &gt; well I guess to be expected really - the cancer has spread into

&gt; &gt; the other lung, there are spots and shadows in the base of the

&gt; &gt; lung, and near the central side.  He did tell me it's slow growing

&gt; &gt; and for that I am grateful.  I do so want to enjoy some time in

&gt; &gt; my new home with the cats before things get worse.  They are

&gt; &gt; quite bad now.  Hopefully I have found a cleaner for this

&gt; &gt; apartment she will start tomorrow - this will help me a lot and

&gt; &gt; keep the dust down, so may help with the breathing as well - I

&gt; &gt; don't have enough energy to do a proper house clean myself

&gt; &gt; any more and it builds up over the months a 'that will have to

&gt; &gt; do' as Isi runs out of energy dragging the vacuum cleaner

&gt; &gt; around.

&gt; &gt; I have a spare steroid shot so if things get too difficult I am to

&gt; &gt; give it to myself.  He has also prescribed something called

&gt; &gt; &quot;Aminophylline&quot; 100mg to help breathing I took one and was ok

&gt; &gt; then I took another and started to shake and feel very odd, so

&gt; &gt; have not taken any more but today the steroid injection is

&gt; &gt; wearing off I think so I may try another of the breathing pills.
&gt; &gt; Now my quest for Oxygen begins, I will feel safer if I have

&gt; &gt; some and can have a whiff of it when unable to catch enough

&gt; &gt; air.  It's getting to the point where I am scared to go to sleep at

&gt; &gt; night in case I awaken unable to breath, which I have been

&gt; &gt; doing at around 2-3 am each night for the past couple of weeks

&gt; &gt; or a bit more.   I lose track of time these days.

&gt; &gt; Re cat post
&gt; &gt; Yes their boxes are airline compliant boxes, they travelled here

&gt; &gt; via British Airways and it totally freaked them out as far as the

&gt; &gt; boxes are concerned.  The boxes live on the bedroom floor but

&gt; &gt; they refuse to go inside and kind of walk sideways around

&gt; &gt; them.  I will try the straw game - but don't hold out much hope.

&gt; &gt; When we went to the mountains it was very difficult catching

&gt; &gt; them.

&gt; &gt; I caught number one placed her in her box and secured it.

&gt; &gt; started to catch number two.  Number one broke out of box,

&gt; &gt; pushed the door off it's hinges.  I then had to get them from

&gt; &gt; under the couches, remember through all this Im panting like an

&gt; &gt; old dog eventually I had to turn all the furniture on its side so

&gt; &gt; the had only one place they could go under - too heavy for me

&gt; &gt; to turn on it's side, I then used a brolly to sort of hook them out.
&gt; &gt; After all that it took me about an hour and a half to catch my

&gt; &gt; breath.

&gt; &gt; The guy who was driving me arrived and was stunned at the

&gt; &gt; chaos,he helped me to return all the furniture to it's proper

&gt; &gt; place before we left.  It was a repeat performance on leaving

&gt; &gt; the mountains - Once they hear another human they play

&gt; &gt; possum, they are really afraid of all humans except me.  So

&gt; &gt; what I may do when I move is ask someone to help me catch

&gt; &gt; them, I don't want to be mean to them, but really I just don't

&gt; &gt; have the puff or the energy to start throwing the furniture

&gt; &gt; around.  It's very traumatic for the three of us, as I think I said

&gt; &gt; before they both had a problem childhood and those scars are

&gt; &gt; there forever I think.   At the moment they are hypervigelent,

&gt; &gt; even if I close a door to one of the rooms.

&gt; &gt; After the move hopefully we will be able to settle down and

&gt; &gt; hibernate for the winter in some degree of comfort ( the

&gt; &gt; apartment is not very comfortable as far as sitting around goes

&gt; &gt; I only meant to stay here for a month or two.)   and I will have

&gt; &gt; a bath, a real big bath that I can soak in for hours whilst looking

&gt; &gt; out the window at the distant Turkish forest and mountain, can't

&gt; &gt; wait. Tehe  (Oh I do have a shower here in the apartment but

&gt; &gt; it's not the same as sitting in bubbles.)

&gt; &gt; Thanks so much for the link to Penny's blog she was a brave lady,
&gt; &gt; It's sad that she did not have better pain control during those last
&gt; &gt; days and weeks.

&gt; &gt; Big hugs
&gt; &gt; Isi

&gt; Isa, have you tried Pheromone sprays or plug ins? They are very calming
&gt; for cat. I can get it from the vets here in the UK. Try asking a vet
&gt; there. Might be useful.

&gt; Best wishes.

&gt; Can you &quot;pill &quot; them, Isi?
&gt; It might be kinder to give them a mild sedative a few hours before, rather than have all that chaoseand/or a
&gt; stranger try to catch them?  It's less stressful for everyone if you know how to do it and can.

&gt; I rather doubt that your cats broke out of a rigid plastic carrier? http://www.petplanet.co.uk/category.asp?dept_id=39
&gt; Click on Rigid and the blue one of the left is similar to the ones I have.
&gt; I did have nicely coated cardboard cariers but the stronger cats can break out of the door or knock the hinges off.

&gt; Two did fly in them, but as the carriers ages and the cats grew stronger, it was risky to use them, so i gave them
&gt; away, (with a warning) and bought the rigid plastic ones.

&gt; If you want tips on &quot;pilling&quot; I can explain how I do it.

Hi J,

The cat is a very large weighs about 15 - 17lb and strong, she

looks like a long hair Russian Blue, maybe her papa was a

russian blue, her mother my other cat is Persian looking, so a

small cat -

Yes she broke out of her carrier, I think she put all her weight

against the door and popped locking device.  I then tied cord

around the carriers, under and over by the door, as an extra

precaution.  I am just happy she did it inside the home and so

could not run off in panic somewhere.

I'm not too sure about drugging them, but how do you give pills

to yours?

http://www.ferplast.com/peteng/products/cats/tabid/196/Categ

ory/512/Default.aspx
I use this type but with a closed top.

They have now recovered from the trip chatting away to me,

and bossing me around.  The big cat is so bossy if I stay up

late like tonight she sits and mews at me, and tries to herd me

into bed if I stand up for any reason :-)

In a strange way I think they have gained confidence from the

trip, perhaps because I did not disappear and leave them

somewhere.  Used to have to do that at the vets as the only

way the vet could examine them was to sedate them so they

would have to stay there all day. - Someone was letting off

fireworks just now, and they started to run to hide, I said 'it's ok

your inside' and they just sat down again.  This is a massive

move forward for us.

Hugs Isi

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi people

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just looked in to see how everyone is doing and it seems very
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slow on here, with some questionable posts.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do hope that Betsy is doing ok with treatment.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My life has been in bed again due to continuing very severe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breathing problems - am told it's a combination of asthma and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allergies - who knows really - I just want to breath.  The steroid
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shots help but don't last very long.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Been experiencing really bad night sweats and have to change bedding
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and sleep clothes every couple of hours as they are soaked.  Thhe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weather here has turned into autum overnight and it's only in the 70s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F now so these sweats are not down to the climate.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Much of the pain I have been experiencing in my computer chair
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is not due to the chair.  It has been confirmed that I have lymph
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mets - I sort of suspected this but it was a shock to get the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confirmation.  The lymph nodes affected are under both arms
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and in my back.  They hurt a lot.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A few months ago the groin lymph nodes were enlarged they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are now feeling normal, so perhaps the same will happen with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these pains in my back.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I really hope that I feel better soon and am able to function
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again, as the house is almost finished and I have things to do to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get it ready to move into, getting it furnished and so on, then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the big move.  In my present condition this is impossible to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contemplate let alone carry through.  So I am praying for an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; upturn in health and abilities by the end of this month.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can't help but wonder if this is it sometimes.  Does anyone know if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the lymph node mets are a sign of a nearing end of the road?  Or is it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible to live for a while yet with lymph node involvement?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just know it's important to continue to try and push forward.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry this was not more cheery, I always feel that I am suposed to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happy and full of sunshine, but sometimes I just don't feel it, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that's when I hibernate.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All the best
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Isi

&gt; &gt; &gt; Isi,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I had a pleural effusion which took my breath away and also have asthma,
&gt; so
&gt; &gt; &gt; I know how you feel.  I hope you can find oxygen wherever you are and
&gt; &gt; &gt; hopefully they give you one larger tank for your bedside (or
&gt; computer-side)
&gt; &gt; &gt; and one carry-type in case you need to go out with it.  I am doing
&gt; better so
&gt; &gt; &gt; turned my equipment back in, but I kept the small carry size just
&gt; because it
&gt; &gt; &gt; makes me feel safe to have it.  I think stress/anxiety can add to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; breathing problems sometimes and they gave me Xanax in case that
&gt; happens.  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; wonder if that would help you too.  When you can't breath your muscles
&gt; &gt; &gt; tighten in your shoulders and chest and makes breathing much more
&gt; difficult.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Are they checking your blood sugar with all those steroid shots?
&gt; Everytime
&gt; &gt; &gt; I got a steroid shot they would check my blood sugar and sure enough
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; &gt; had to give me insulin (I am not diabetic).  Also I believe steroids can
&gt; &gt; &gt; increase body fluids and also add to breathlessness.  It is a vicious
&gt; &gt; &gt; circle.  Do you have inhalers?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hugs to you dear Isi.  You are in my thoughts and prayers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Tracey- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; Tracey,

&gt; &gt; Thanks for your reply, it's really interesting to learn of your

&gt; &gt; experience asthma and lung problems are a double whammy.  I

&gt; &gt; can relate to all you said I too hunch up my shoulders so bad

&gt; &gt; that I now have a pain in my neck through doing that.  I have

&gt; &gt; some diazapam and took 2.5mg of it to try and relax then

&gt; &gt; reading online that diazapam is a respitorary inhibitor so

&gt; &gt; decided not to do that again.  I tried to bring up the insulin with

&gt; &gt; the doctor today but it was difficult as he was working alone,

&gt; &gt; very busy and focused on getting me another steroid shot - I

&gt; &gt; am not too happy about taking these shots all the time as I

&gt; &gt; read that they can leach calcium from the bones.  It's all a

&gt; &gt; balancing act as you say.

&gt; &gt; I do use inhalers Becotide and Ventalin, they don't really help if

&gt; &gt; things get bad.
&gt; &gt; I asked about a canister of O2 to have at home, he does not

&gt; &gt; know where to get them.  Who supplies them in your country?
&gt; &gt; He does agree it would be a good idea for me to have one for

&gt; &gt; use in a crisis.
&gt; &gt; I am very pleased you no longer need yours thats a really good

&gt; &gt; move forward and an optimistic sign for me.

&gt; &gt; Take care and thanks again,  Hugs back for you and thank you

&gt; &gt; so much for remembering me in your prayers.  I do believe and

&gt; &gt; pray for everyone here, I know prayer makes a positive

&gt; &gt; difference in our lives...
&gt; &gt; Hugs
&gt; &gt; Isi

&gt; Hi Isi,
&gt; Your new home sounds wonderful.  I cannot wait until you can move to the
&gt; country and enjoy its peacefullness.

&gt; As far as the oxygen goes - I get mine from a medical supply place and they
&gt; came every few weeks to trade tanks.  Maybe a local hospital could tell you
&gt; where to get it from?  Maybe a respiratory therapist?  I also saw one of
&gt; them and learned how to breath the correct way and how to do my inhalers the
&gt; correct way.  You do need a little instruction on pressure, turning valves
&gt; on/off and possibly your own little oxygen saturation meter (goes on your
&gt; finger and tells you what your oxygen level in your blood is) as you
&gt; definately do not want too much.  I got mine on eBay for quite a savings:
&gt; Mine is called:  Finger Oximeter, made by Smith Medical, phone (44)
&gt; 1923-246434.  Consider a massage therapist for your neck muscles; it makes a
&gt; big difference in your breathing if you can relax Isi.  What about a glass
&gt; of red wine to relax?  I do not know where you are Isi, but I hope you are
&gt; able to find some relief with your breathing.  It has to play a huge role in
&gt; your healing.  I wish I could be there to help you.

&gt; Hugs,
&gt; Tracey- Hide quoted text -

Hi Tracy,

Thanks for your post, yes I am really looking forward to getting

the move over and settling in my new home.  I feel sure it will

help with the breathing too.  The country air, and Im not having

any carpet of other 'fluffy things' that asthma triggers can stick

to.

When you were using the Oxygen did you have to breath in a

special way?  I am only going to use it in a crisis so will keep

the tank near my bed, as that seems to be the safest place to

put it.  Thanks for the info about the oximeter I will check that

out this weekend and get one.  I have thought about having a

neck massage, have only found 'beauty type' massage people

so far, but I may try them.  I have a heat pad that I place on

my neck and shoulders it helps to relax them.

Iit's a long time since I had a glass of red wine, since I started

using the pain killers - we have talked about it before on here -

I have a bottle in the kitchen :-)  I feel there is someting very

decadent about drinking wine alone.  I'm headed to the kitchen

now to find my corkscrew.  lol

Take care Tracey

Big Hugs
Isi

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi people

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I just looked in to see how everyone is doing and it seems very
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; slow on here, with some questionable posts.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I do hope that Betsy is doing ok with treatment.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My life has been in bed again due to continuing very severe
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; breathing problems - am told it's a combination of asthma and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; allergies - who knows really - I just want to breath.  The steroid
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shots help but don't last very long.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Been experiencing really bad night sweats and have to change
&gt; bedding
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and sleep clothes every couple of hours as they are soaked.  Thhe
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; weather here has turned into autum overnight and it's only in the
&gt; 70s
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; F now so these sweats are not down to the climate.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Much of the pain I have been experiencing in my computer chair
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is not due to the chair.  It has been confirmed that I have lymph
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mets - I sort of suspected this but it was a shock to get the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; confirmation.  The lymph nodes affected are under both arms
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and in my back.  They hurt a lot.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A few months ago the groin lymph nodes were enlarged they
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are now feeling normal, so perhaps the same will happen with
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; these pains in my back.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I really hope that I feel better soon and am able to function
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; again, as the house is almost finished and I have things to do to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; get it ready to move into, getting it furnished and so on, then
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the big move.  In my present condition this is impossible to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; contemplate let alone carry through.  So I am praying for an
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; upturn in health and abilities by the end of this month.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I can't help but wonder if this is it sometimes.  Does anyone know
&gt; if
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the lymph node mets are a sign of a nearing end of the road?  Or is
&gt; it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; possible to live for a while yet with lymph node involvement?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Just know it's important to continue to try and push forward.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sorry this was not more cheery, I always feel that I am suposed to
&gt; be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happy and full of sunshine, but sometimes I just don't feel it, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that's when I hibernate.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; All the best
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  Isi

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi, Isi,

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have been gone a lot &amp; have missed you.

&gt; &gt;&gt; From reading this thread...how far away is the place you are moving
&gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; from where you are now?  I had thought close.  Are you in the place
&gt; with
&gt; &gt;&gt; the chickens under?

&gt; &gt;&gt; About the oxygen, there are several kinds of things that can be used.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Here, the giant tanks on wheels are rarely used anymore.  For around
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; house, we had a rather large machine that compressed oxygen out of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; air &amp; added moisture.  It flowed through a tubing system.  Socks
&gt; could
&gt; &gt;&gt; go anywhere in our house &amp; even out on the patio without carrying any
&gt; &gt;&gt; equipment. If you watch his video, you can see how he moved through
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; house with his tubing.  I'll look up the link &amp; post. For going out,
&gt; we
&gt; &gt;&gt; had a large cannister of compressed oxygen that we used to fill up an
&gt; &gt;&gt; array of oxygen containers for the road.  The smaller ones were like
&gt; &gt;&gt; little fanny packs.  There were other things, but those 2 covered
&gt; most
&gt; &gt;&gt; situations. He used his for comfort, not really a medical necessity,
&gt; but
&gt; &gt;&gt; he didn't like being without it.  We do live at altitude which makes
&gt; &gt;&gt; some difference.  He did better at sea level - a good excuse for
&gt; &gt;&gt; cruises.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have my first little girl kitty ever.  My Bartholomew fell
&gt; instantly
&gt; &gt;&gt; in love with Tabitha.  I am watching him bathe her &amp; snuggle her.  If
&gt; &gt;&gt; she mews, th runs over &amp; puts a paw around her neck &amp; gives her a
&gt; head
&gt; &gt;&gt; bath. She is only a couple of months younger than he but very tiny.
&gt; Very
&gt; &gt;&gt; sweet to watch &amp; good to see him so happy.He keeps coming over to
&gt; give
&gt; &gt;&gt; me 'thank you' hugs.

&gt; &gt;&gt; video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tCVswu4XfA

&gt; &gt;&gt; Take good care, isi,
&gt; &gt;&gt; Fig- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; Hi Fig,

&gt; &gt; Yes the house is near here about 15-20 minutes drive from

&gt; &gt; where I am now, in the same municipality.  The cockerel and

&gt; &gt; hens have moved on :-) from here so no more early

&gt; &gt; doodledoos - I bet I get them when I move, though it will be

&gt; &gt; natural in the country side, my new neighbour there has hens,

&gt; &gt; ducks, geese, goats, and what else I will discover.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the info about the O2 Socks used, what a wonderful

&gt; &gt; system, with the tubing he could move about so freely must

&gt; &gt; have made a huge difference to his quality of life.  He looks

&gt; &gt; quite agile in the video.

&gt; &gt; This is a whole new world for me never bought a gas before,

&gt; &gt; nor it seems has my doctor so it will be the blind leading the

&gt; &gt; blind, every beam of light is so welcome 0 don't want to blow

&gt; &gt; myself up or get the wrong stuff.  I wonder if the O2 divers use

&gt; &gt; would be the same, might be able to find that on the coast.  I

&gt; &gt; guess one needs to know about pressure and so on.
&gt; &gt; Ahhhh I just remembered my builder studied marine biology,

&gt; &gt; and scuba dives, one day he told me he knows how to build a

&gt; &gt; tanking room - not too sure what that is.  Something to do with

&gt; &gt; diving i think.  Ah Fig, you have set off a train of thought on this.

&gt; &gt;   I will ask him, he may know.  Perhaps there is a potential biz

&gt; &gt; here providing medical O2 to all the people who need it. I was

&gt; &gt; wondering what to do with the barn :-)

&gt; &gt; Back down to earth, how did you get it? from Hospice or from

&gt; &gt; a gas company?

&gt; &gt; Big Hugs
&gt; &gt; Isi

&gt; Hi again, isi,

&gt; Maybe oxygen suppliers are not so common where you live as here.  We
&gt; have companies that specialize in home heath aids &amp; they deliver &amp;
&gt; service all the equipment.  Apria is a big one here. Initially, Sock's
&gt; medical insurance covered most of the cost (we paid a monthly co-pay).
&gt; Not very expensive here &amp; it was a flat monthly charge, regardless of
&gt; usage.  When Socks entered hospice, all of that equipment went &amp; hospice
&gt; supplied all free of charge.

&gt; The compressor was great, but it makes a lot of noise &amp; generates heat
&gt; (a plus for winter).  We kept it in a spare room with the door shut &amp;
&gt; the tubing running under the door. It was THE place to take clothes to
&gt; have the wrinkles fall out of them.

&gt; He was athletic before he got cancer.  Most years he rode his bicycle in
&gt; a huge event called Ride the Rockies where participants rode across
&gt; Colorado over many mountain passes for a week.  Not a race.  In the
&gt; video, he was maybe 3-5 weeks from death. He had aged tremendously by
&gt; then.  He was only 52 &amp; had been a fairly hefty guy.

&gt; I would love to awaken to doodle do.  In Dallas, I let a neighbor kid
&gt; raise Bob White quail in a corner of my backyard.  Those were fun to
&gt; wake up to also.  Now I have a furry alarm clock.

&gt; Warm hugs,
&gt; Fig- Hide quoted text -

Hi Fig,

Sorry I did not realise that Socks was so young, it makes

everything even worse, and so much harder for you - both.
He has the most amazing eyes.

Are your little kitties still the best of friends it sounds so sweet

the way Bartholomew is looking after his little girl.

I wrote a post about my O2 situation - hopefully it's going to be

sorted tomorrow.  And I will breath :-)

Warm Hugs to you too Fig,

Isi

&gt; &gt; Went to the doctor and had an xray the news is not so good,
&gt; &gt; well I guess to be expected really - the cancer has spread into
&gt; &gt; the other lung, there are spots and shadows in the base of the
&gt; &gt; lung, and near the central side.  He did tell me it's slow growing
&gt; &gt; and for that I am grateful.

&gt; I have to wonder if being hypoxic or cyanotic slows down the cancer.
&gt; And getting oxygen and/or breathing better helps cancers grow?
&gt; I'd want to talk to a clinical oncologist about that and what in his or her opinion could help you breath better
&gt; without encouragiing the cancer to grow, if  my hypothesis is true.

&gt; &gt;  I do so want to enjoy some time in
&gt; &gt; my new home with the cats before things get worse.  They are
&gt; &gt; quite bad now.  Hopefully I have found a cleaner for this
&gt; &gt; apartment she will start tomorrow - this will help me a lot and
&gt; &gt; keep the dust down, so may help with the breathing as well - I
&gt; &gt; don't have enough energy to do a proper house clean myself
&gt; &gt; any more and it builds up over the months a 'that will have to
&gt; &gt; do' as Isi runs out of energy dragging the vacuum cleaner
&gt; &gt; around.

&gt; I hear you. I also have to tell you that mattresses harbor dust mites to which many are allergic.
&gt; Affects breathing.
&gt; We drop millions of dead cells daily wherever we go including in the bed.
&gt; Are you starting off with a fresh (new) mattress when you're moving?
&gt; People buy a mattress cover that dust mites cannot crawl out through and they say wash all the bedding at least
&gt; once a week.

&gt; &gt; I have a spare steroid shot so if things get too difficult I am to
&gt; &gt; give it to myself.  He has also prescribed something called

&gt; &gt; &quot;Aminophylline&quot; 100mg to help breathing I took one and was ok
&gt; &gt; then I took another and started to shake and feel very odd, so
&gt; &gt; have not taken any more but today the steroid injection is
&gt; &gt; wearing off I think so I may try another of the breathing pills.

&gt; http://ratguide.com/meds/respiratory_drugs/aminophylline.php
&gt; CNS: nervousness,restlessness,seizures
&gt; Cardiac: tachycardia,arrhythmias(increased and or irregular heart rate)
&gt; GI:  gastric irritation
&gt; GU:  polyuria(increased urine output)

&gt; (apparently it affects the central nervous system)

&gt; http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a601015.html
&gt; Aminophylline is used to prevent and treat wheezing, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing caused by
&gt; asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and other lung diseases. It relaxes and opens air passages in the lungs,
&gt; making it easier to breathe.
&gt; Aminophylline may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away.

&gt;     * upset stomach
&gt;     * stomach pain
&gt;     * diarrhea
&gt;     * headache
&gt;     * restlessness
&gt;     * insomnia
&gt;     * irritability
&gt; f you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:
&gt;     * vomiting
&gt;     * increased or rapid heart rate
&gt;     * irregular heartbeat
&gt;     * seizures
&gt;     * skin rash

&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; After the move hopefully we will be able to settle down and
&gt; &gt; hibernate for the winter in some degree of comfort ( the
&gt; &gt; apartment is not very comfortable as far as sitting around goes
&gt; &gt; I only meant to stay here for a month or two.)   and I will have
&gt; &gt; a bath, a real big bath that I can soak in for hours whilst looking
&gt; &gt; out the window at the distant Turkish forest and mountain, can't
&gt; &gt; wait. Tehe  (Oh I do have a shower here in the apartment but
&gt; &gt; it's not the same as sitting in bubbles.)

&gt; I hear you. Much better than a shower, but (why do I have to have a but in here), you'll need something soft to lie
&gt; on, in the tub?  An air mattress would float?  And I think would be wobbly to step in onto.
&gt; There must be something at a Health Supply place or maybe someone else , here, can think of what would be best so
&gt; you're not in more pain in the tub.

&gt; &gt; Thanks so much for the link to Penny's blog she was a brave lady,
&gt; &gt; It's sad that she did not have better pain control during those last
&gt; &gt; days and weeks.

&gt; As far as I know, she had the best there is, but her particular cancer was difficult to palliate.
&gt; Each person can be different so it's hard to say what will happen for you.

&gt; I wish you could see a clinical oncologst and discuss the oxygen and have him/her look at the scans tell you if
&gt; there's anything that can help you breathe some better. Judy's husband had a stent put in, but I do not know its
&gt; purpose .

&gt; Sounds like you'll be busy today. Will wait for your updates.
&gt; Hugs from me,

Hi J,

I hear what your saying about the O2 and cancer growth.  I

suppose it depends if it needs aerobic or anaerobic conditions

to divide.  I don't remember much about this, but think I have

read that lactic acid levels are high in people with cancer and if

cahexia is present the Cori cycle anaerobic is somehow more

dominant than it ought to be.
My brain no longer functions at a level to study these things.

It's been many years since I read any biochemistry, though I

did find it very interesting at that time.
As you know I have not seen an oncologist, they are in Sofia

and it's seems the job they do is put people on chemo - I don't

know if they do any more than that - but as I am not going on

chemo, I don't see what they can offer me.
If I don't get help breathing it will be irrelevant how fast the

cancer grows, breathing is essential to life.

Yes I do know about dust mites and will be getting a new

mattress when I move - it's also good Feng Shui.  My current

mattress is only 18 months old and I do change to fresh linen a

couple of times a week and use a 60C wash cycle and

chlorine.

I have not taken any more &quot;Aminophylline&quot; 100mg I don't trust

any drugs that make me feel weird, if they do that is has to be

bad for the body.

Thanks for the thoughts about a bath pad, I never thought of it

being uncomfortable to sit in.  I will try it - it may be fine, hope

so :-)

Wow it's late I  off to bed
good night and god bless
Hugs to J from

&gt; &gt;&gt; The weight of the big cannisters on wheels is much harder to deal with.
&gt; &gt;&gt; We had some of those when Socks was first diagnosed.  Then he didn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; need oxygen for 3 years or so.  When we got oxygen the 2nd time, the
&gt; &gt;&gt; products had changed dramatically.  The compressor was the same, but the
&gt; &gt;&gt; options for portable were greatly increased.  The fanny packs are very
&gt; &gt;&gt; light weight.  But we do not know what is available where isi is.  That
&gt; &gt;&gt; will dictate what she uses.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Fig

&gt; &gt; The cannisters are the legacy or old faishon way of delivering O2. They
&gt; &gt; also are a fire hazard. They need to be managed by professionals ( people
&gt; &gt; who do the behind the scenes checks).  They are also the cheaper. The
&gt; &gt; technology for the portable O2 has been available for over a decade, but
&gt; &gt; expensive.  It was available to Socks ( probably the first time) but the
&gt; &gt; DME companies get the same reimbursement so they tended to dispense the
&gt; &gt; cheaper techonology. Compressors have been around since the earlier 90's
&gt; &gt; ( probably earlier).

&gt; &gt; Isi could have even better techonology since the FDA is not involved. But
&gt; &gt; considering her doctor doesn't have a oximeter or know where to get O2  I
&gt; &gt; made the leap that they wouldn't have cutting edge techonology.  J, made a
&gt; &gt; comment on a fanny pack which I believe is between 4-6 lbs. and how it may
&gt; &gt; cause back pain.
&gt; &gt; People who can't where O2 can use walkers.

&gt; &gt; Sorry Isi,  I even brought up the O2 suggestion, since it has caused more
&gt; &gt; distress to you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Hi

&gt; This is an update on the O2 situation.  My Doctor and I went shopping
&gt; today, driving to lots of industrial estates looking for oxygen.  My
&gt; Doctor is a gem.
&gt; Anyway we eventually found some, they only have canisters in two
&gt; sizes, one  is about 5feet tall and looks like a torpedo.  Perhaps
&gt; when I move I will get that as it will last a long time.

&gt; For now I am going to get a canister thats about 2.5 feet tall, it's
&gt; blue and has a red cross on it!  Costs $3 US a month to rent, It's
&gt; being cleaned and filled, we will pick it up tomorrow.  I wanted two,
&gt; one as a spare but they only had one available and it looks pretty
&gt; ancient!    When it runs out one has to take it back to the supplier
&gt; to be refilled.  We then went to the hospital and I bought both a mask
&gt; and a canula sp (not sure which I will prefer so got both) and some
&gt; tubing.

&gt; I asked about an oximetre and sort of got laughed at - they don't have
&gt; western technology here, its country in transition.  For my own peace
&gt; of mind so I don't take too much O2 I will try to buy one off ebay or
&gt; from UK somewhere.

&gt; The Oxygen is for crisis use only, there are times when I know mine is
&gt; really low and I feel so tired and fuzzy in addition to the breathing
&gt; problems. My toes, fingertips and nail beds are pale purple, I think
&gt; when they go pink, if they go pink, I will have normal O2 levels in my
&gt; blood.  Can anyone confirm this?  Last week I became rather alarmed as
&gt; my lips started to go purple, so I stuck my head out of the window and
&gt; had the fan and the A/C blowing flat out, and boiled a large pan of
&gt; chamomile tea to moisten the air in the apartment..   The idea of
&gt; getting some O2 has been hovering around my awareness for quite a few
&gt; months, so I thank you guys for giving me a push to hustle for it.  I
&gt; do hope it helps and enables me to do more than I am able to at
&gt; present.

&gt; I do find it very strange that its so difficult to get hold of - My
&gt; doctor is a GP and has been in practice for over 20 years and this is
&gt; the first time he has done this.  I just wonder what the Bulgarians do
&gt; when they have breathing problems and need home oxygen, it's very
&gt; strange is it not a treatment here.  I searched online and it seems
&gt; 'alternative oxygen therapy and ozone therapy' are available in the
&gt; spa's here.  Sorry this is off topic, it's a mystery and I have to get
&gt; to the bottom of it.

&gt; Thanks for all your support, valuable information, and the kick on the
&gt; butt &lt;g&gt; to get me moving on this. :-)

&gt; I found this last night it may be useful to someone else going down
&gt; this path.

I hope this is good news Isi.  It sounds like the tanks they use for
welding.  Does it have a gauge or a meter on it that will tell you if you
are getting (for example) 1% oxygen?

I check my 02 daily, and when I am out of breath.  My oximeter also gives my
heart rate, as most do.  I do notice, and this may be hard for you I don't
know, that when I sit for a long time my breathing is much shallower and 02
goes way down, but when I sit up straight, or stand, and breath deeply,
(abdominal breathing not chest breathing), I can raise my 02 in a matter of
seconds.  Abdominal breathing takes practice but it really helps loosen up
the muscles in the neck, shoulders and chest that can make breathing more
difficult.  The respiratory therapist taught me to lie on my bed, put my
hand on my abdomen, breath in through my nose and out through my mouth,
concentrating on feeling your abdomen rise and fall with your hand.

I hope I am not confusing, and maybe someone knows of a web site for this
that would be better instruction, or perhaps you know how already.  I just
know that it helped me tremedously once I knew how.

Hugs Isi,
Tracey

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi people

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I just looked in to see how everyone is doing and it seems very
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; slow on here, with some questionable posts.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I do hope that Betsy is doing ok with treatment.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My life has been in bed again due to continuing very severe
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; breathing problems - am told it's a combination of asthma and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; allergies - who knows really - I just want to breath.  The
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; steroid shots help but don't last very long.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Been experiencing really bad night sweats and have to change
&gt;&gt; bedding
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and sleep clothes every couple of hours as they are soaked.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thhe weather here has turned into autum overnight and it's only
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the
&gt;&gt; 70s
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; F now so these sweats are not down to the climate.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Much of the pain I have been experiencing in my computer chair
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is not due to the chair.  It has been confirmed that I have
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lymph mets - I sort of suspected this but it was a shock to get
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the confirmation.  The lymph nodes affected are under both arms
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and in my back.  They hurt a lot.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A few months ago the groin lymph nodes were enlarged they
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are now feeling normal, so perhaps the same will happen with
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; these pains in my back.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I really hope that I feel better soon and am able to function
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; again, as the house is almost finished and I have things to do
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to get it ready to move into, getting it furnished and so on,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; then the big move.  In my present condition this is impossible
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to contemplate let alone carry through.  So I am praying for an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; upturn in health and abilities by the end of this month.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I can't help but wonder if this is it sometimes.  Does anyone
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; know
&gt;&gt; if
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the lymph node mets are a sign of a nearing end of the road?  Or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; possible to live for a while yet with lymph node involvement?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Just know it's important to continue to try and push forward.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sorry this was not more cheery, I always feel that I am suposed
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happy and full of sunshine, but sometimes I just don't feel it,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and that's when I hibernate.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; All the best
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  Isi

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi, Isi,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have been gone a lot &amp; have missed you.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; From reading this thread...how far away is the place you are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; moving
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; from where you are now?  I had thought close.  Are you in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; place
&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the chickens under?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; About the oxygen, there are several kinds of things that can be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; used.  Here, the giant tanks on wheels are rarely used anymore.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; For around
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; house, we had a rather large machine that compressed oxygen out of
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; air &amp; added moisture.  It flowed through a tubing system.  Socks
&gt;&gt; could
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; go anywhere in our house &amp; even out on the patio without carrying
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; any equipment. If you watch his video, you can see how he moved
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; through
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; house with his tubing.  I'll look up the link &amp; post. For going
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; out,
&gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; had a large cannister of compressed oxygen that we used to fill up
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; an array of oxygen containers for the road.  The smaller ones were
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; like little fanny packs.  There were other things, but those 2
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; covered
&gt;&gt; most
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; situations. He used his for comfort, not really a medical
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; necessity,
&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; he didn't like being without it.  We do live at altitude which
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; makes some difference.  He did better at sea level - a good excuse
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for cruises.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have my first little girl kitty ever.  My Bartholomew fell
&gt;&gt; instantly
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in love with Tabitha.  I am watching him bathe her &amp; snuggle her.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If she mews, th runs over &amp; puts a paw around her neck &amp; gives her
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; head
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bath. She is only a couple of months younger than he but very
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; tiny.
&gt;&gt; Very
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sweet to watch &amp; good to see him so happy.He keeps coming over to
&gt;&gt; give
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; me 'thank you' hugs.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Take good care, isi,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Fig- Hide quoted text -

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Fig,

&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes the house is near here about 15-20 minutes drive from

&gt;&gt; &gt; where I am now, in the same municipality.  The cockerel and

&gt;&gt; &gt; hens have moved on :-) from here so no more early

&gt;&gt; &gt; doodledoos - I bet I get them when I move, though it will be

&gt;&gt; &gt; natural in the country side, my new neighbour there has hens,

&gt;&gt; &gt; ducks, geese, goats, and what else I will discover.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for the info about the O2 Socks used, what a wonderful

&gt;&gt; &gt; system, with the tubing he could move about so freely must

&gt;&gt; &gt; have made a huge difference to his quality of life.  He looks

&gt;&gt; &gt; quite agile in the video.

&gt;&gt; &gt; This is a whole new world for me never bought a gas before,

&gt;&gt; &gt; nor it seems has my doctor so it will be the blind leading the

&gt;&gt; &gt; blind, every beam of light is so welcome 0 don't want to blow

&gt;&gt; &gt; myself up or get the wrong stuff.  I wonder if the O2 divers use

&gt;&gt; &gt; would be the same, might be able to find that on the coast.  I

&gt;&gt; &gt; guess one needs to know about pressure and so on.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Ahhhh I just remembered my builder studied marine biology,

&gt;&gt; &gt; and scuba dives, one day he told me he knows how to build a

&gt;&gt; &gt; tanking room - not too sure what that is.  Something to do with

&gt;&gt; &gt; diving i think.  Ah Fig, you have set off a train of thought on
&gt;&gt; &gt; this.

&gt;&gt; &gt;   I will ask him, he may know.  Perhaps there is a potential biz

&gt;&gt; &gt; here providing medical O2 to all the people who need it. I was

&gt;&gt; &gt; wondering what to do with the barn :-)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Back down to earth, how did you get it? from Hospice or from

&gt;&gt; &gt; a gas company?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Big Hugs
&gt;&gt; &gt; Isi

&gt;&gt; Hi again, isi,

&gt;&gt; Maybe oxygen suppliers are not so common where you live as here.  We
&gt;&gt; have companies that specialize in home heath aids &amp; they deliver &amp;
&gt;&gt; service all the equipment.  Apria is a big one here. Initially,
&gt;&gt; Sock's medical insurance covered most of the cost (we paid a monthly
&gt;&gt; co-pay).  Not very expensive here &amp; it was a flat monthly charge,
&gt;&gt; regardless of usage.  When Socks entered hospice, all of that
&gt;&gt; equipment went &amp; hospice supplied all free of charge.

&gt;&gt; The compressor was great, but it makes a lot of noise &amp; generates
&gt;&gt; heat (a plus for winter).  We kept it in a spare room with the door
&gt;&gt; shut &amp; the tubing running under the door. It was THE place to take
&gt;&gt; clothes to have the wrinkles fall out of them.

&gt;&gt; He was athletic before he got cancer.  Most years he rode his bicycle
&gt;&gt; in a huge event called Ride the Rockies where participants rode
&gt;&gt; across Colorado over many mountain passes for a week.  Not a race.
&gt;&gt; In the video, he was maybe 3-5 weeks from death. He had aged
&gt;&gt; tremendously by then.  He was only 52 &amp; had been a fairly hefty guy.

&gt;&gt; I would love to awaken to doodle do.  In Dallas, I let a neighbor kid
&gt;&gt; raise Bob White quail in a corner of my backyard.  Those were fun to
&gt;&gt; wake up to also.  Now I have a furry alarm clock.

&gt;&gt; Warm hugs,
&gt;&gt; Fig- Hide quoted text -

&gt; Hi Fig,

&gt; Sorry I did not realise that Socks was so young, it makes

&gt; everything even worse, and so much harder for you - both.
&gt; He has the most amazing eyes.

&gt; Are your little kitties still the best of friends it sounds so sweet

&gt; the way Bartholomew is looking after his little girl.

&gt; I wrote a post about my O2 situation - hopefully it's going to be

&gt; sorted tomorrow.  And I will breath :-)

&gt; Warm Hugs to you too Fig,

&gt; Isi

Hi, isi,

I was just reading about your oxygen purchase &amp; am glad you are on your
way to better breathing.

Yes, still best of friends.  Tabitha (I'm flirting with calling her
Thumbelina) passed her upper resperatory infection to Bartholomew who
now has laryngitis.  They both went to the vet this afternoon as I must
leave on another trip Monday &amp; needed to get his treatment started.

The other day, she must have told him she needed space.  I could see him
trying to stay away from her &amp; having a hard time of it. When she got 1
level below him on their climbing thing, he reached down &amp; tried to lift
her up with his paws.  Almost. Right now they are snuggled together -
can't see where one ends &amp; other begins.

If the oxygen tank could be a potential fire hazard, I think I'd keep it
where it is not between you &amp; the exit, just as a precaution.  We once
had a small drama with a leaking 75 lb.tank on a trip, in the back seat
of my car.  We could not resolve the problem.  We had pulled into a gas
station (away from pumps) &amp; asked for help, but the person there asked
us to move away &amp; they only had volunteer fire departments in those
parts.  So we rolled down the window next to it &amp; made it home without
incident.

I think the hazards are slight, but if you have to do anything in your
home involving striking matches or firing up a gas stove burner, I'd
make sure the tank was turned off first if in the same room.

I do wonder how people there do without oxygen.  Here, you see people
everywhere with their fanny packs. It is great that they can be so
mobile. And there are always a number of people in motorized wheel
chairs on the train &amp; all over downtown.  The train drivers are very
kind to them &amp; we all look out for them too.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes their boxes are airline compliant boxes, they travelled here
&gt; &gt; &gt; via British Airways and it totally freaked them out as far as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes are concerned.  The boxes live on the bedroom floor but
&gt; &gt; &gt; they refuse to go inside and kind of walk sideways around
&gt; &gt; &gt; them.  I will try the straw game - but don't hold out much hope.

&gt; &gt; &gt; When we went to the mountains it was very difficult catching
&gt; &gt; &gt; them.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I caught number one placed her in her box and secured it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; started to catch number two.  Number one broke out of box,
&gt; &gt; &gt; pushed the door off it's hinges.

&gt; &gt; I rather doubt that your cats broke out of a rigid plastic carrier? http://www.petplanet.co.uk/category.asp?dept_id=39
&gt; &gt; Click on Rigid and the blue one of the left is similar to the ones I have.

&gt; The cat is a very large weighs about 15 - 17lb and strong, she
&gt; looks like a long hair Russian Blue, maybe her papa was a
&gt; russian blue, her mother my other cat is Persian looking, so a
&gt; small cat -

&gt;  Yes she broke out of her carrier, I think she put all her weight
&gt; against the door and popped locking device.  I then tied cord
&gt; around the carriers, under and over by the door, as an extra
&gt; precaution.  I am just happy she did it inside the home and so
&gt; could not run off in panic somewhere.

&gt; &lt; http://www.ferplast.com/peteng/products/cats/tabid/196/Category/512/D... &gt;
&gt; I use this type but with a closed top.

&gt; They have now recovered from the trip chatting away to me,
&gt; and bossing me around.  The big cat is so bossy if I stay up
&gt; late like tonight she sits and mews at me, and tries to herd me
&gt; into bed if I stand up for any reason :-)

&gt; In a strange way I think they have gained confidence from the
&gt; trip, perhaps because I did not disappear and leave them
&gt; somewhere.  Used to have to do that at the vets as the only
&gt; way the vet could examine them was to sedate them so they
&gt; would have to stay there all day. - Someone was letting off
&gt; fireworks just now, and they started to run to hide, I said 'it's ok
&gt; your inside' and they just sat down again.  This is a massive
&gt; move forward for us.

Hi isi,
I looked again at the example you showed me and the example I showed you and neither show the securements in the door (in
detail) unless it's because my monitor is too small. Yours is easier to see and it does not look secure enough to me for
the size, strength and obstinateness of your cats.
The design of yours is flawed. The door is concave (rounded), giving the animal some help in it's impetus towards breaking
out. lol   Looks to me that yours latches at the top?

The door in mine and my example is vertical. (not rounded outwards)

The hinge side has a long sturdy bar, that slips through a hole in the plastic at the top and bottom.
The opening of the door also has a long sturdy bar, that slips through a hole in the plastic at the top and bottom.
and the latch is spring loaded. So get the cat in, close and hold the door, then squeeze the two shorter bars together and
push the door into place. As this happens, the long bar goes into its holes.
I have the paperwork. and its instructions refer to dogs, so I may have bought dog carriers, one smaller than the other.
(theory being I could transport two in the bigger carrier or each in their own carrier, depending on the need and whether
or not they got along)

I've had them 13 years , which matches around the same time, I realized how big and strong one of the two cats was
becoming.
The brand is here and this one shows the door and long bars a little clearer.
(they come in different sizes)
http://www.petmate.com/Catalog.plx?ID=1550&amp;SizeID;=3

There's no way either of my cats, nor some younger ferals (recently) could get out it.
However, I recognize that ferals can be very muscular, having had to be to survive.

Getting the ferals in was no problem; they like the food. And my sitting nearby and not moving, until time to close the
door.  However, once home and my wanting to transfer them to a different cage, one got loose in the garage and after 4
nights/3 days of begging, pleading, playing, frustation, a shelter person told me to throw a towel or blanket over it.
&quot;they can't see where to run when they're in the dark&quot;. I did not trust that advice.  I just tried it with my cat, however
it's not a good test, because for 16 years, we've been playing games by covering her up, so she trusts and has no urge to
try to escape.

Back to the ferals.
So I leaned the cat carrier against some steps, making sure it would not rock or fall backwards.
Multiple tries at putting food at the bottom of the carrier/ the last one, he figured out that margarine tubs have edges on
them that allow a cat's teeth to grab the tub of food and carry it elsewhere.The little beggar, my guesstimate only 8-9
weeks old was seen licking his lips under an area I can't get to, full margarine tub now empty nearby.
So after some deliberation and cursing, I remembered a flat dish and put that at the bottom with food in it.
I sat there paying attention to the other cats in the other carrier and feeding them and not feeding him; talking to him,
but not looking at him and not feeding him.
He tried 3 times hesitantly, then finally went into the carrier and whack: I closed the door on him.
This, however can result in a mess of food covered cat, less so if it's dry cat food or treat.

So back to your cats; the spooky one should be tried first.
I don't know if anything above will work if the door's not strong and secure enough. (which it doesn't look to be to me).
if it was just one trip, I'd tell you try/rent? a live trap. Cat weight triggers door to close, but you'll need something
secure for when the cats get back on the plane, or any cat trips that might be required while you're still with them.

I've never tried a live trap. Some are shown here http://www.pestproducts.com/humane_live_traps.htm
I doubt they'd be airplane compliant, but I could be wrong. Looks like they take up too much space for your current living
area.  You might appreciate having one out where you're going to live, but I don't know what you'll do if faced with other
ferals, or possums or skunks or hedgehodges or dogs or raccoons.  They don't bother us much out here, only if someone
leaves food out. (okay well, dogs are a problem, but I get out there with a big stick, if I see one or more loose and the
cat's outdoors)

So where are we on this?  You expect your friend to go through what you've described trying to catch your cats, then
wrapping the carrier with cords etc to prevent them from getting out?

My cats were traumatized when young by renovations. Theyynever took much to anyone else.
They &quot;make strange' when someone approaches. Only vets and vet assistants have had the guts to pick them up. and one person
who further traumatized them by treatng them rough (handling) is how his cat liked it apparently or was too stupid to bite
him back.  They both hid and/or hissed when he was around. The sound of his keychain alerted them to who it was and they
hid or hissed at him when he wanted to pick them up or peel them out from under a bed or chair.  They both hid when anyone
else was in the house. However, one, the only one now does come out, after a period of quiet sitting adult time, out of
loneliness or curiosity and sits on the table and sometimes lets some people pet her, no sudden noises or movements. Only
some people. i would never encourage anyone else to try picking her up. They could get torn to shreds by back claws.
I wonder why I'm telling you this...does your friend have a knack with cats?  oes the cat-catcher man, who you plan to have
help you, have a knack with cats?

Hugs

&gt; &gt; Can you &quot;pill &quot; them, Isi?
&gt; &gt; It might be kinder to give them a mild sedative a few hours before, rather than have all that chaoseand/or a
&gt; &gt; stranger try to catch them?  It's less stressful for everyone if you know how to do it and can.

&gt; &gt; If you want tips on &quot;pilling&quot; I can explain how I do it.

&gt; Hi J,

&gt; The cat is a very large weighs about 15 - 17lb and strong, she
&gt; looks like a long hair Russian Blue, maybe her papa was a
&gt; russian blue, her mother my other cat is Persian looking, so a
&gt; small cat -

&gt; I'm not too sure about drugging them, but how do you give pills
&gt; to yours?
">

Many webistes decribe cradling the cat. I do not for 2 reasons.
1) Cats don't like to feel backed into a corner 2) too dangerous to get scratched with any of the claws.

I put them/it on a (cleared) table or counter (me in sit or stand position, whichever is more comfortable for you) and
proceed as if we're about to have a treat and &quot;love the cat &quot; time.
3 things are near my right hand: the pill, a soft brush and some snacks.
The cat is facing me, sitting or lying down. We proceed with the &quot;cat loving&quot; methods; gentle spine massage, brushing head,
neck, whisker area, a treat, fondling and touching her head, ears and mouse and nose area (hehe) some purring and
smooching.  So the cat has seen my arm and hand go toward an area (and back) and nothing nasty has happened, so when my
hand goes to pick up the pill, the cat expects nothing different.

If the cat wants to change position, fine, but I ease her back to facing me.
If she wants to leave, no dice; i'm in &quot;loving mood&quot; and she has to stay with me. Than's an order.

Many webpages show the correct finger positions of the left hand; however they show the hand covering the top of the cats
head and ears. I think this is a big mistake. I want the cat to clearly hear my calming and sing-songey relaxed voice and
not feel squished nor restrained.

So here we are, we're both relaxed. My left hand's last fingers are slightly pressing on the left side of the cat's mouth
and the thumb is doing the same on the right side of the cat's mouth, and slightly elevating the head. My palm is on the
cats neck and lower skull area (not covering the top of it's head and ears).

If the cat goes belly up,, twisting or turning, with back claws flailing, I back off, and reposition her and do the loving
bit a bit more to calm her

In simultaneous movements, I reach for the pill, with my right hand. I do not show the cat the pill. I use the same (right)
hand to pull the lower jaw down and the left hand to eace/point the cat's head towards the ceiling.
I drop the pill aimed at the back of the cat's throat, then push it with my index finger (right hand) down further (no
nails to hurt the throat), then get my hand out of there as quickly as possible, so I don't get bit. lol
If done correctly and fast enough you will receive no wounds, as there are no teeth at the rear of the mouth.

I semi-release the cat so she can get her head in normal position to  swallow but gently restrain her (hold her neck area
and butt area) from leaving, so I can ascertain that she does not flick it out with her tongue or cough, gag it out and
voila, we're done. She gets a treat and more &quot;cat loving&quot; and then away she goes and doesn't remember next time I play the
same routine on her.

Note: this has worked with big or small cats over a period of 30 years.  However, I have never done a true feral cat, not
socialized, just out of the wild.
I do think two of my cats were that size and were manageable for pilling.

Demos:
http://www.alltipsandtricks.com/blog/2007/03/10/how-to-give-your-cat-...
head does not have to be that high. Covering the head, I think is a mistake.
I don't throw the pill; I drop it in.
It says &quot;release the cat&quot;. I don't (see above re holding nearby for more loving) unless you got hurt or out of breath and
had to.
If the cat happens to throw up (whether food or furball soon afterwards, I search the throwup to see if there's sign of the
pill, if so, I know I have to give another. Do not repeat, if unsure, wait and see if cat gets wobbly and sleepy
(transquilized).

If she spits it out, mine did once, because I missed, if it's not disintegrating, pat it dry and start again.
The pill must not fall on the tongue. If the cat can taste it, it will react. If the cat's foaming, it means it's upset or
tasting the pill.  If you're sure the pill went down, then give the cat water to help wash the taste away.
It says there, it can be done from behind the cat. I just tried it. She's okay but my right hand has to reach father (not
comfortable for that postition)

http://www.marvistavet.com/html/pilling_a_cat.html
I do not like the fingernails on that woman nor prying the lower jaw or mouth open with fingernails.
Finger is soft and won't injure.
&quot;Cat has no strength in the lower jaw in this position and cannot bite.
Place the pill as far back as possible into the mouth.&quot; I drop the pill, then press it down a bit further, then out with
the finger.
So the hand pressing on the jaw areas so the mouth will open (which in my face forward, is the left hand) is the one that
needs to be firmer.

Again: I don't like the way she's covering the top of the cat's head and ears AND she's coming from behind the cat.

Final: No bright lights; I use light from the sun or from a flurescent light.
Cats see better in that light and IMO they have to see that it's me and not some stranger.

I wonder if you can try with a soft treat?  If you think the claws will come out make a towel bib to protect your chest and
stomach and wrap your wrists with tensor bandages (protect from scratches)?

(type of medicine and dose discussion to follow) and/or veterinarian recommendation, assuming they're competent with pets;
not just farm animals).

Apologies to cat owners. That cat's ugly !

She stays in the bathroom for 2 hours after bathing her cat.
&quot;13. In two hours it will be safe to exit the bathroom&quot;??? Two hours??
I bathe mine on warm sunny days and after towel drying, we go out and sun dry because by then we're both soaked.
If it has to be done in winter, a warm cozy room, draft free should be fine.
She bathes them in the shower enclosed, with some type of protective suit on.
I bathe mine in the kitchen sink and cover the floor with towels.
Ah well, I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe I've just been fortunate in having more manageable cats.

&gt; &gt; Hi

&gt; &gt; This is an update on the O2 situation.  My Doctor and I went shopping
&gt; &gt; today, driving to lots of industrial estates looking for oxygen.  My
&gt; &gt; Doctor is a gem.
&gt; &gt; Anyway we eventually found some, they only have canisters in two
&gt; &gt; sizes, one  is about 5feet tall and looks like a torpedo.  Perhaps
&gt; &gt; when I move I will get that as it will last a long time.

&gt; &gt; For now I am going to get a canister thats about 2.5 feet tall, it's
&gt; &gt; blue and has a red cross on it!  Costs $3 US a month to rent, It's
&gt; &gt; being cleaned and filled, we will pick it up tomorrow.  I wanted two,
&gt; &gt; one as a spare but they only had one available and it looks pretty
&gt; &gt; ancient!    When it runs out one has to take it back to the supplier
&gt; &gt; to be refilled.  We then went to the hospital and I bought both a mask
&gt; &gt; and a canula sp (not sure which I will prefer so got both) and some
&gt; &gt; tubing.

&gt; &gt; I asked about an oximetre and sort of got laughed at - they don't have
&gt; &gt; western technology here, its country in transition.  For my own peace
&gt; &gt; of mind so I don't take too much O2 I will try to buy one off ebay or
&gt; &gt; from UK somewhere.

&gt; &gt; The Oxygen is for crisis use only, there are times when I know mine is
&gt; &gt; really low and I feel so tired and fuzzy in addition to the breathing
&gt; &gt; problems. My toes, fingertips and nail beds are pale purple, I think
&gt; &gt; when they go pink, if they go pink, I will have normal O2 levels in my
&gt; &gt; blood.  Can anyone confirm this?  Last week I became rather alarmed as
&gt; &gt; my lips started to go purple, so I stuck my head out of the window and
&gt; &gt; had the fan and the A/C blowing flat out, and boiled a large pan of
&gt; &gt; chamomile tea to moisten the air in the apartment..   The idea of
&gt; &gt; getting some O2 has been hovering around my awareness for quite a few
&gt; &gt; months, so I thank you guys for giving me a push to hustle for it.  I
&gt; &gt; do hope it helps and enables me to do more than I am able to at
&gt; &gt; present.

&gt; &gt; I do find it very strange that its so difficult to get hold of - My
&gt; &gt; doctor is a GP and has been in practice for over 20 years and this is
&gt; &gt; the first time he has done this.  I just wonder what the Bulgarians do
&gt; &gt; when they have breathing problems and need home oxygen, it's very
&gt; &gt; strange is it not a treatment here.  I searched online and it seems
&gt; &gt; 'alternative oxygen therapy and ozone therapy' are available in the
&gt; &gt; spa's here.  Sorry this is off topic, it's a mystery and I have to get
&gt; &gt; to the bottom of it.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for all your support, valuable information, and the kick on the
&gt; &gt; butt &lt;g&gt; to get me moving on this. :-)

&gt; &gt; I found this last night it may be useful to someone else going down
&gt; &gt; this path.

&gt; I hope this is good news Isi.  It sounds like the tanks they use for
&gt; welding.  Does it have a gauge or a meter on it that will tell you if you
&gt; are getting (for example) 1% oxygen?

&gt; I check my 02 daily, and when I am out of breath.  My oximeter also gives my
&gt; heart rate, as most do.  I do notice, and this may be hard for you I don't
&gt; know, that when I sit for a long time my breathing is much shallower and 02
&gt; goes way down, but when I sit up straight, or stand, and breath deeply,
&gt; (abdominal breathing not chest breathing), I can raise my 02 in a matter of
&gt; seconds.  Abdominal breathing takes practice but it really helps loosen up
&gt; the muscles in the neck, shoulders and chest that can make breathing more
&gt; difficult.  The respiratory therapist taught me to lie on my bed, put my
&gt; hand on my abdomen, breath in through my nose and out through my mouth,
&gt; concentrating on feeling your abdomen rise and fall with your hand.

&gt; I hope I am not confusing, and maybe someone knows of a web site for this
&gt; that would be better instruction, or perhaps you know how already.  I just
&gt; know that it helped me tremedously once I knew how.

&gt; Hugs Isi,

Hi Tracy

Thanks for your reply.  My tank is I think, just O2 no gauges or
anything like that - just an on-off valve with a dial that indicates
the pressure and so the amount of gas left in tank.   The guy at the
gas supply place instructed me how to use it.  Thats where I did my
first session, life is so funny here.  I watch my nails, when the
purple goes and they look normal I switch it off.  I am bidding on an
oximeter, will feel happier with that I think, as I am concerned about
taking in too much O2.

It has made an amazing difference to my feeling of strength and
general well being, could even stand up straight after my first
session. The feeling was in my spine, it felt energised.
My breathing problems are still there but not as severe - the O2 works
better than a steroid inhaler during a attack, which I still get each
night.

Yesterday I had a wonderful massage she released a lot of the
tightness in my back and neck.  It was interesting as she also spent a
lot of time working the swollen lymph nodes on my back.  I am going to
have her come in once or twice a week as it made such a difference to
my pain levels, and will help breathing as my neck and shoulders
deeply relax, I hope.

Thanks for the info on abdominal breathing thats so sweet of you - I
do know about this, and your post reminds me to do it when inhaling
from the tank, I use a mask.

It's long been rumoured that some old rock stars use oxygen when they
go on the road, now I can believe it's true as the difference I feel
is incredible, if one was well and fit,  I could imagine it would be
possible to prance around on stage for an hour or so lol.

Be well Tracey,

Hugs Isi

I have noticed that some people use the O2  at night getting a good
night's rest makes a huge difference,  The nasal cannula is the more
comfortable. Here in the US, there is thing that looks like a
thermometer, usually it is set at 2L.

Glad to hear it has helped you........if you like it you can get extra
long tubing.
