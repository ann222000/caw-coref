Damn staight. Who needs the idiots in the climatology division that
are completely illiterate in physics, climatology and even in their
own theory of AGW.

In Hansen's recent publication, he takes the overall temperature
change of the glacial to interglacial period, draws this into a direct
proportion to CO2 concentration changes, (along with the virtually non-
existent other trace gases). This is absurd.
http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2007/2007_Hansen_etal_2.pdf

He entirely skirts the fact that careful studies show CO2 to follow
warming by 900yrs although he acknowledges these studies, he then
states that due to uncertainty in the ice cores, him and his troup,
consider the changes simultaneous with temperature change.

He ignores the contemporary idea of orbital cycles that change solar
insolation. He has no theory of why the temperature fluctuations occur
of 10-12C. He completely leaves out water vapor in his considerations
or the fact that with greater temperatures, water vapor concentrations
increase.

Instead of any valid theory, he makes vague statements of what levels
of CO2 can be allowed. He does not advise or clarify the fact that 7.8
billion tons of CO2 amount to 1ppm.
This shows that although human input is 25 billion tons annually, the
annual concentration increase is only about 13 billion tons. This
means that his considerations for restrictions of the use of fossil
fuels are completely offbased and not quantified.

He tries to develop the idea that methane is a serious threat of
global warming without actually stating directly the concetrations of
methane and contemporary presumed value of methane in 'grenhouse'
effect. He calls methane a 'long lived' grenhouse gas. He does not
mention that methane decomposes to CO2 in 10 yrs. With his poor
analyses, he is completely willing to state that methane emissions
must be curtailed by 1/3 worldwide. This olone would bankrupt modern
economies, without ever getting to the CO2.

His recent paper has no science whatsoever. It is merely theoretical
surmise which is always designed to support the climate
scaremongering.

It is not protected by freedom of speech to yell fire in a crowded
theater. Hansen is guilty of criminal propaganda and fraud of the
highest order. The latest proof of the false claims of hottest
temperatures in recent years, (that is the backbone of Algore's
scaremongering propaganda also), should not be given the benifit of
the doubt, as though Hansen and his team just made a mistake.

With their postiton and their obsession with their statistics, with
which he calls for complete economic devastation of modern economies,
it should be presumed that he knew of the true statistics and
deliberately continued the fraud. He should be prosecuted accordingly.

If NASA cannot impose any of the philosophy of actual science upon
this climate scaremonger, then it should also be held for review in
complicity of this very serious crime, besides the embezzlement of
public funds that Hansen is guilty in being unable to validly do even
their basics of temperature statistics.

That may not be a very good idea, kT.  It's very probably
a real bad idea.

I doubt that a majority of US senators and representatives

Well then you can relax, crappock. All of your opposition and the
people who must be saved from their evil ways and brought unto the
promised land of cooler climates by the visionaries of climatology who
can see what science cannot, are bone cold stupid. Your agenda will
prevail, and the intelllectuals of climatology shall ascend to their
proper place as dictatorial rulers over the masses and stupid
politicians.

So what about the analyses of the statistics that show the clear fraud
of the statement that is the basis of the scaremongering, that most of
the warmest years were in the last decade, crappock??

The warmest year (out of the last 127 years) is 1934!  And six out of
the 10 warmest years occurred before 90  percent of the recent growth
in greenhouse gases. What does this do to your 'evidence' and your lie
of .999999999999999999999999999 assurance of validity of your
statistics?????

With no laboratory data at all to support the ideas of CO2 caused
warming, the loss of this propaganda tool of your statistics should
bring you to reason???

But you will probably just go plug Algore's movie in to watch it again
and bolster your AGW hysteria, instead. Enjoy.
