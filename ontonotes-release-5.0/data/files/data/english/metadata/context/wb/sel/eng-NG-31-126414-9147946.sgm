I'm only here to get an answer to one question.

300 days ago LinTards here and all over the net were making the claim that
2007 was going to be the end
of Micosoft and that Linux was going to become in this year the standard OS
for the desktop.  It was further
claimed that Vista would be an absolute catastrophe and the Linux would make
tremendous gains in the desktop market.

Now, we see that in the last 300 days Vista has sold around 100 million
copies, and that Linux has not only not achieved any presence on the
desktop, but has acutally decreased in marketshare.

So... What happened LinTard?  How did YOOZERS go so spectacularly wrong?

Is it still raining Gumdrops and lollypops in LinTard Land?

Has it really sold 100 million copies - or have there been 100
million PCs sold with Vista pre-installed ? Have you tried to buy a PC
without Vista in the last nine months or so ? I've heard enough people
complaining that they would rather have had XP. For that matter most of the
machines bought in the last several months for running a BSD or Linux were
bought with Windows Vista installed.

In short - the statistic is meaningless except to note that
Microsoft continues to succeed in being bundled with almost every PC sold.
If you want an interesting number to play with find out how many people buy
Vista on disc to replace the OS they already have.

Oh and finally I personally don't care what the most popular OS is,
I am happy that there is a choice of OSs available so that people can
choose one that they like. I would be happier still if it was easier to
exchange data with those few OSs that don't use documented data formats.

My understanding was that Microsoft sold 88 million license units,
which included upgrades from Vista Home editions to Vista Business
which could then be downgraded and shipped to the end-user/customer as
Windows XP.

The 88 million number came from Microsoft's quarterly report to the
SEC.  The downgrade policy was confirmed by a Microsoft marketing
executive.

I don't think there has been a confirmation of 100 million USERS at
this point.
It's possible that Microsoft has achieved 100 million license units,
but I haven't seen the confirmation in public documents yet.  Do you
have a cite?

The &quot;World&quot; doesn't choose anything.  The choice to pre-install
Windows is made by 2 groups of people.  The OEM usually has some top
ranking executive in charge of the PC division who is responsible for
negotiating license agreements with Microsoft.  Microsoft does it's
best to make this person &quot;Look Good&quot; by offering a rediculously high
initial price, then negotiating the price down in exchange for
numerous technological concessions and other terms favorable to
Microsoft, most of which preclude the OEM from installing Linux as a
co-resident system.

The OEM has the option of paying a premium price for more flexibility,
but even then there are loop-holes which give Microsoft a great deal
of control over what goes onto the OEM's PCs, how they can be
advertized, and how benchmarks can be published.  Remember, to
Microsoft ANY comparison between a Microsoft product and any
competitor's product is a benchmark.  Microsoft must give prior
written permission before any benchmark can be published, before any
change in configuration can be shipped, and before any new advertizing
&quot;zinc&quot; can be published.

&gt; &gt;  That's no theory.  That is a simple fact.

&gt; &gt;   Unix has never been able to cut it in the OS marketplace, and this is

">

Unix is so pervasive it's almost invisible.  Unix controls everything
from routers to telephone switching equipment, to railroad routing, to
air traffic control systems to computers within the aircraft itself.
In fact, a significant &quot;break&quot; in UNIX usually results in front-page
news.

You can't browse the web without going through Unix systems.  Nearly
all web sites have UNIX systems providing various applications and
business rules engines as well as most of the database engines.

Microsoft has tried to replace Unix and BSD Mail packages with Windows
and Exchange in HotMail for years.  As I understand it, Microsoft
still has not been able to provide a cost-effective solution as
reliable, stable, and secure as those available for Unix/Linux.

Microsoft has been able to fabricate carefully optimized benchmarks in
which custom configured Windows systems to give better benchmarks in a
single domain, against a generically configured Linux system.  Linux
and Unix still provide more functionality, at a lower cost, with
better performance and higher reliability and lower staffing
requirements - than Windows systems required to implement a complete
solutions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; WTF? Unix was the computing market place before IBM/DOS packaging.
">

This is correct.  In fact, prior to the PC, the most popular computer
chip was the Z-80 processor made by Zilog.  Zilog then made a 16 bit
chip which ran Unix beautifully.  Motorola, who had been making the
6800 processor, made a 32 bit chip called the 68000 chip which also
became a very popular UNIX processor.  National Semiconductor
introduced the NS-32000 processor which was also a very popular Unix
chip.  Eventually, Unix and it's variants beat out nearly all of the
minicomputer operating systems.  Eventually, even mainframe systems
had more and more functionality previously done by CICS and MVS
transferred to UNIX based functionality.  OS/390 offered both the MVS
interface and the Unix interface, and Z/OS offers MVS, Unix, and Linux
virtual machines as part of their solution suite.

These days, there are actually only a very limited number of machines
that DON'T run some form of Unix or Linux, and are incapable of
running them.  This includes Windows and Linux.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;   The fatal problem of Linux is that  &lt; LINUX IS UNIX &gt; but with some
&gt; &gt; friendly wallpaper glued on top.

&gt; Linux is not UNIX.
">

Linux is designed to be Unix compatible.  However, from the very
beginning Linux was designed based on a very different set of
assumptions from the traditional &quot;Unix&quot; systems.  Linux was very
interested in the MMU of the 80386 and exploited it very efficiently
along with additional memory management features of the successor
chips.

On the other hand, Linux is library compatible with Unix, which is why
the glibc library and numerous other libraries originally developed
for the Unix kernel are supported by Linux.  As a result, many of the
applications written for Unix also work under Linux.  Libraries and
applications written for the BSD application programmer interfaces and
released under the BSD libraries are the most popular.  There is also
a System V compatibility library designed to emulate a traditional
Unix API, but these are not as widely used.  The emulation library is
unique to Linux because although the API is Unix compatible, it's
implemented using the Linux kernel and glibc libraries.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Linux, is a kernel, GNU is not UNIX. GIYF.
">

This is an important point.  Linux is only the kernel portion of the
system.  On the other hand, the Linux kernel, GNU Libraries, BSD
Libraries, GNU applications, BSD applications, and huge assortment of
additional Open Source applications have become so closely linked to
the Linux kernel that Linux &quot;Distributions&quot; have become almost
synonymous with &quot;Linux&quot;.  If you are talking about Ubuntu, SUSE, Red
Hat, or any other version of &quot;Linux&quot;, you are actually talking about
the Linux Distributions, not just the kernel.  In fact, the kernels
and glibc libraries in all of these distributions are all the same
standard foundations.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;   Underneath though, it's stilll Pure Command Line Driven Unix.
">

Pure Command Line Driven Unix hasn't existed since the development of
the termcap library for BSD 4.0 Linux back in 1982.  The shell is a
very effective tool for integrating a number of very simple
applications in much the way one would combine tinker-toys to create a
ferris wheel or any of hundreds of other &quot;applications&quot;.

On the other hand, Unix has had graphics since before the Mac was
released.  AT&amp;T offered &quot;red&quot; which was a basic graphics editors.
Unix also supported the phigs graphic standard which was the basis for
some of the earliest CAD/CAM packages in the early 1980s.  The early
Unix machines used Textronix 4010 graphics terminals and even today
the X11 graphics package offers the Xterm package which offers the
Tektronics emulation.

In fact, by the time Microsoft introduced Windows 3.1, the first
widely used version of Windows which was still unreliable and
marginally functional with non-preemptive multitasking, UNIX had
already established X11R5 as the best of several competing GUI
interfaces including Sun's NeWS which was based on PostScript
(Postscript is also the basis for PDF), Aegis, and other proprietary
versions and solutions offered by HP, Apollo, IBM, Sun, Dec, and
Tektronics.

In fact, by the time Windows 3.0 was released, X11R4 had already
provided a standardized graphics platform which was supported by all
of the major Unix vendors.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And that's the beauty of it. In fact though, Windows underneath is just
&gt; syscalls. But you don't have the option really of using command line
&gt; tools to do stuff, everything is focused on the GUI. This is painful if
&gt; you ever have to do bulk operations. How does one iterate over a set of
&gt; commands to SQL, without having to compile something?
">

Microsoft had a real problem with the GUI-Only configuration and
management tools.  When you need standard configurations maintenance
procedures, it is much easier to have an automated script that can
easily be modified do the work as opposed to manually executing a
complex series of mouse and windows operations in a GUI environment.

Microsoft added scripting capabilities with .NET and attempted to
improve the ability to automate administration functions with Windows
2003, and this has increased the acceptance of Windows for certain
&quot;interface servers&quot;, including many web server &quot;front-ends&quot;.  Even so,
most of the &quot;heavy lifting&quot; is still done by Unix and more and more,
by Linux.  Oracle has excellent support for Linux, as does IBM and
Sun, HP, Dell, and just about everybody else.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Don't bother replying OP, I'm sure it wont be constructive.

&gt; &gt;   Now LinTards believe that they can put enough layers of wallpaper over the
&gt; &gt; OS so that no one will notice.
">

Not really.  The Linux support organizations offer very competitive
graphical interfaces, and competition tends to drive each of the
players to be more aggressive and supportive than they would be if
they had a monopoly.  Linux GUI builders don't just have to compete
with each other, they also have to compete with Microsoft and Apple.
Apple makes a more visually appealing interface, but Linux interfaces
such as KDE and Beryl are more functional and more effective at
helping the user organize huge numbers of Linux.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; However - as Linux user knows - after a short while every Linux user finds
&gt; &gt; that the wallpaper starts falling off and you have to start tinkering with

">

That is sometimes true.  If you have an unsupported WiFi card, or a
peculiar graphics card that runs ONLY DirectX, you have some work to
do that those who purchase &quot;Linux Ready&quot; hardware don't have.  On the
other hand, for those who do have Linux-ready hardware, the scripting
languages just provide additional power and capabilities that aren't
even accessible on Windows.

The big fundamental difference between Windows and Linux is that
Windows is based almost entirely on huge propriatery monolithic
applications.  Linux on the other hand uses small building blocks and
source available applications.  If you don't like the rules imposed by
a  huge, monolithic, GUI application, too bad, you're screwed.  If you
