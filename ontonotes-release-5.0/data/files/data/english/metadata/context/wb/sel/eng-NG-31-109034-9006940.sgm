POD: Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach led Krupp company during hard
times of post-WW I. As the company is forced to diversify its production,
he presses strongly for introduction of new manufacturing
technologies and standardization. At same time, to improve
competitiveness, Taylorism is introduced into Krupp factories. As a result
productivity increases.

While visiting Krupp works Hitler has one of his brighter moments and
mentions Krupp's progress positively in his speeches. &quot;National Socialism
in industrial products is uniformity, quality and mass - as with human
beings&quot; (or some other similar bs verse). &quot;Materialschlacht must fought
with material!&quot; he screaks.

Thus, by the time German re-armament starts there is strong ideological
pressure upon German industrialists to improve their productivity while
Krupp factories are already modernized.

What will be the results?

What I'd imagine, first, is that German forces are marginally better
equipped already when the WW II starts. It is really hard to imagine how
German forces might have managed better until Barbarossa (even in Battle
of Britain pilot losses seem to be more important factor than quantity of
airframes). The differences start really when Barbarossa starts. While
German equipment is vis a vis as good as it historically was, there are
more trucks, tanks and artillery pieces. Whether or not this would be
enough to carry on to Moscow, I don't know.

If we assume war in the East takes somewhat similar form as in OTL, until
Stalingrad German forces are better supplied with extra weaponry than in
OTL. And of course it all comes down to Manhattan project. Overall, maybe
German forces deeper in the East when mushroom clouds start to appear, or
use of tactical nukes in preparation for Overlord-equivalent.

Well if so they left it late.

What about early did the Germans in the OTL have sufficient logistic to
take them to Moscow if instead of going South they went straight to
Moscow?

The Nazi's initially preferred to give production contracts to smaller
businesses instead.  Granted, Hitler is free to change that policy at
a moment's notice, but he wants people working as an end in and of
itself.

If the Nazis standardize &quot;right,&quot; standardized armaments are rolled
out in greater numbers, leading to fewer German casualties up to and
including the Battle of France.  German field equipment is easier to
maintain on the field, since parts can be shipped and interchanged.

As for not standardizing &quot;right,&quot; an example exists at the fingertips
of most US/Canadian/probably all Anglophone keyboards.  The QWERTY
style was initially configured to slow down a typest so they would not
be able to jam the keys of the manual typewriters.  When electronic
typewriters came along, the QWERTY standard was so entrenched it
prevented far more optimal configurations from gaining significant
ground.

How can this hamstring the Germans?  Well, the Panzer III's were
considered the equivalent of the French tanks (at least in tank
battles, the French tended to stalemate when in roughly equal number
of tanks against the Germans).  However, if the Germans standardize at
the Panzer II or Panzer I, their OTL breakthroughs may not occur as
planned.

We do have prior examples of the Nazis initially shunning better
equipment (such as the FW190) in favor of better politically connected
companies, so it is possible that Hitler would find 1000 Panzer I's
preferable to 300 Panzer III's, and perhaps ignore the 88 mm anti-
aircraft gun for a gun more standard with the Panzer I's armament.  It
all depends on how standard-crazy the ATL Germany gets.

ATL Barbarossa has its own problems.  While this ATL Nazi Germany has
standardized equipment, none of the trucks and equipment they acquired
in conquered Europe has it, and the Nazis will by this time not be
used to adjusting to nonstandard kit as they were OTL.

If memory serves, by 1936 there was a labor shortage in Germany.
With an expanding army coupled with an improving economy, there were
more jobs than bodies. So some &quot;standardization&quot; in terms of efficient
use of resources (men and materials) would be possible.  OTOH, in 1936,
Germany had an installed base of industry, unlike 1948, when most of
what hadn't been destroyed had been hauled off.
So in 1936, you will be replacing functional machinery (and factory
buildings fall in this category), and Krupp is going to be selling
machine tools like crazy to do so.

But still, if the Feuher says that's how it will be, that's how it
will be.  At least the Junkers know that labor will be agreeable.

While Taylorism help with Worker productivity, thats isn't whats
needed for Standardization.

An example.
Bantam Motors developed the 1/4 ton GPV for the Army, the 'Jeep'

Won out over other companies product, the Pygmy from Ford
and Willys-Overland Quad

They couldn't make the thing in the numbers desired, but Willys
and Ford, could, and did. Another trial was set, and each of
the 3 companies tried to match the best points of the other two,
and started to look very similar.  This time, Willys won, and was
Standardized as the MB, and the very similar 99% interchangable
GPW from Ford. Bantam made trailers during the War: lost that
contract.

Once Standardized, the company had to match so that the product
would match do a high degree of interchangability, no matter who
made it, like Carbines made by IBM to Underwood Typewriter
to Rock-ola Jukebox company

For example, Sherman Tanks used a lot of different hull types,
depending if they were Cast by Baldwin or Welded by Chrysler,
but Turrets from American Car and Foundry had to work with them
all. Same for engines, a large variety from twin diesels, aircooled
radial or Ford V8, all had to work with the rest of the systems.

In 1930(before Hitler, remember) the Germans were planning on two
tanks, the Medium Tractor, 15 ton ZW for anti-tank work, and the
18 ton BW for infantry support, firing a HE shell.

Both Mk I&amp;II were interim designs, but there was absolutely no
need for the Mk III and Mk IV to differ the way they did. That
75mm in the Mk IV fit in the Mk III turret in 1943, after all.

MAN, Daimler,Rheinmetall and Krupp tried for the Mk III contract,
Daimler won, but Krupps design, slighly changed, became the
Mk IV, winning over the Rheinmetall and MAN design(which
had interleaved roadwheels, like the later Tiger and Panther)

they weren't Standardized in the US sense, even though they
used the near same Engine. Nothing else interchanged till later
in the war, the hybrid Mk.III/IV was done, that tried to combine
the best of the two, but this should have been done in 1936,
not 1942

A Standardized Mk III/IV would really have done 90% of the
Nazis Tank needs for the entire war, much like the Sherman

Well, what would be the VW Wolfsburg factory was one of the
few in all Nazi Germany that really took Ford's vertical integration
to the level Detroit had been doing since the '20s for high levels
of mass production

And it sat pretty much idle during the war.

So lets make the Strength thru Joy car a bit more dual use.
a 1100cc 25HP car just doesn't have much possibility.
The VW motor could be scaled up, all doable with the tech
of the day, to what it later became, a 80HP 2300cc four
or 3500cc six. Good enough for an all wheel drive 2 ton truck,
armored cars, and so on. No need to press the captured trucks
into combat service

Not in 1936, apart from Hitler not having consolidated power there was
nothing to standardise in most areas. German weapons were those left
over form WW1 and new designs which had not been completed (the 18
series).

There were other constraints, the development contracts for tanks for
example had to be given to companies with no overseas investment because
they were in breach of Versailles.  Still Krupp did get development
contracts for prototypes.

The German tank program was intended to result in a medium tank and an
infantry support tank. These eventually arrived as the III and IV. The
Panzer I was intended as a stopgap while heavier tanks were developed.
Because these took so long to develop the Panzer II was put into
production just to provide tank strength.

By the way the Germans did produce standard chassis. These were
intended for mass use but mainly ended up being used for armoured cars.
The problem was that they were so complicated, four wheel drive front
and rear steering etc that they took forever to build.

The 88 was actually designed before Hitler came to power by one of
Krupp's overseas shadow companies. In the early days of Nazi power
Hitler was not that interested in weapons designs. That came later.

&gt;     headway because of the crushing power of standards, even stupid

&gt;     Keys, Journal of Law &amp; Economics vol. XXXIII (April 1990)]. They

&gt;     sizable body of work suggests that in fact the Dvorak offers
&gt;     little practical advantage over the QWERTY; (3) at least one study
&gt;     indicates that placing commonly used keys far apart, as with the
&gt;     QWERTY, actually speeds typing, since you frequently alternate
&gt;     hands; and (4) the QWERTY keyboard did not become a standard
&gt;     overnight but beat out several competing keyboards over a period
&gt;     of years. Thus it may be fairly said to represent the considered
&gt;     choice of the marketplace. It saddens me to know I helped to

Fascinating post but overstated.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY#Alternatives_to_QWERTY

If you are interested there are some real typist with experience in both
discussing the relative advantages of each. Note having been recently to
Germany and France, I can testify just how painful it is to have a non
qwerty keyboard can be!

http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/qwerty-vs-dvorak/

There does appear to be some real benefits to dvorak, probably we are
stuck with QWERTY though.

That does not stop it from being omitted from the standardization
process.  On the other hand, it might prompt the 88 becoming the
standard main gun for German tanks even earlier.  Whatever happens

In this ATL, the assumption was the Nazi's get fanatical about
standardization, presumably prior to WW2.  I believe such a change is
potentially significant in how the war is executed, although the Nazis
still lose.  I also believe that if the Germans are overly fanatical
about standardization, it can work against them, given how
standardization choices can backfire.
