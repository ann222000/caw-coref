Film Description
After Prince Sohan contrives a hunting accident for his rival, Prince
Ranjit, so that he might inherit his lands, Ranjit foils his ploy by
remaining alive thanks to the intervention of a nearby medicine man. Falling
in love with his daughter Sunita only inflames Sohan's jealousy further, and
on the eve of Ranjit's wedding, Sohan presents him with his gift of some
exquisitely tooled dice, and suggests a game while thinking of revenge.
Ranjit cannot resist.

Based on the pivotal gambling episode from the Mahabharata, this is a
classic Indian silent film from the German director Franz Osten, with a new
score by Nitin Sawhney.
