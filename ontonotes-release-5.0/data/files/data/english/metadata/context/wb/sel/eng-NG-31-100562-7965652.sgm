What is this dude with the bullseye on his head?  He could run but he
couldn't hide.  Reagan was watching and as such he could steal a car
and he could drive away.  He could take a plane and he could fly
away.. But Reagan was still There..  Jashu was an idiot.  Jung, a
psychologist of the soul, favored the book of Job.  Job recalls God's
unconscious side, &quot;Who darkened whose Council?&quot;  The unconsciousness
of God has in it Wrath and that is the main reason for his blunders.
Jung observes that humans have a more concentrated light than God.
Jashu never shot Himself.. He found it unfitting.. It was right for
the lame ones to point a gun to their head.. the right thing to do
when your brain is in an absurd state is to use the gun and blow it
away.  In a vase was the World.  Can There be a World outside of
Jashu?  If There Can be, then Jashu must not be all that Great.. Jashu
isn't Everything, so one can live a life without thinking about
Jashu.. What Does That Mean?  The man with the bullseye on his head
was found through an open periscope.. The Captain said, &quot;What is this
dude with the bullseye on his head?&quot;  When you have the mark on your
head, you must swift it.. but since there is no escape, you must
freeze..  when a wiseman sees pitfalls around him, he stands Still..
The Robots of Dawn were most well-rewarded because it suited his
purpose, to control all things.. &quot;I'm not gonna Give you control!!&quot;
In the movies, this are much better.. Even movies about King Arthur
have more glory than what exists in the Universe.. What does this
Mean?  Jashu made blunders from the start.  Jashu tucked his blunders
in with the Art.. Jashu enjoyed the fact that he may crush the victims
of his choice.. He relished in their broken hearts..in their broken
bodies.. He gave the Robots of Dawn much Authority over the people who
were free.. I was born to be Free.. How did the Old Man kill the fish?
&quot;He drowned it in Water..&quot;  Jashu was so clever and rational that he
worked all things to his advantage even to justify himself through the
use of arguement of which he rigged or set up so he could justify all
things for himself.. He tucked his blunders away, but he called the
perfect blunders to avoid skepticism about him even through the
sciences which he also exalted.. Jashu was God, but Jashu was severely
unconscious where it mattered the most.. as such His existance was
'stoopid'..
The wiseman got his brains combusted.. but being wise, he enjoyed the
drugs that came as the only road.. the only resort after all roads
were closed down..
