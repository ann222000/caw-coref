I have an old cradle, actually a glider because it doesn't rock, it glides
back and forth. It has brass fittings on it that are marked Pat. May 29,
'88. It also has a brass key-like thing that locks the glider in place.
It's about 37&quot; long and 25&quot; wide and has dowels running lengthwise at the
bottom of the cradle part and also top to bottom. It's walnut, I think,
and is really beautiful. I can't find any other markings on it and would
like to know more about it. If anyone knows anything about this piece,
please let me know. Thanks!
