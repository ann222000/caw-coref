CURIOUS CHRISTIANS

by Marilyn Ehle

**Growing in your faith: http://thelife.com/study/growingfaith.html

&quot;When the Lord saw that he (Moses) had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush...&quot;  (Exodus 3:4).

I wonder how much of God and his adventure for my life I have missed because I have not taken the time and spent the energy to truly look?

After Moses' illustrious early years, he now finds himself far from the glittering palaces of Egypt. An alien in a foreign land, he spends his time as a shepherd on the far side of the desert. Did he wonder how he had come to this point? Did he recall hearing about the Jehovah God of his birth family?

A New Testament writer records that Moses &quot;saw him who was invisible&quot; through the eyes of faith, but how great was his faith during those desert years? We read only that Moses, alone in the desert, was curious: &quot;I will go over and see this strange sight - why the bush does not burn up.&quot;

How God must yearn for curious Christians who take the time and spend the energy to &quot;go over to look,&quot; to ask hard questions, to dare to go where they must rely wholly on God's presence and power.

When the Lord sees that we are going over to look, he will call to us as he called to Moses. He will say, &quot;I will be with you...I will send you.&quot;

~Lord, it is so very easy to stay with the familiar, to be satisfied with what I already know rather than launch out into areas of uninvestigated intellect or new endeavors requiring fresh faith. Remind me that you are ready to go with me and eager to show me new glimpses of your power and plan.

Questions: Are you satisfied to stay where you are or curious to investigate new endeavors? What is holding you back? Do you truly trust God's power to keep you and guide you as you step out?
