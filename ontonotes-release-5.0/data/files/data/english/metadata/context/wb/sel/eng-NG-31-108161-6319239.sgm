Old 8mm and Hi8 to DVD - what Bitrate?

I have my technique for digitizing the video down pat.  No problems
there.

BUT, I put a bunch of videos on a single DVD-RW and they looked too
"mpegged" pm teh DVD player.

So my question is, what bitrate should I burn them at?  Obviously I
won't be able to fit as many on a single DVD if I burn at ahigher
rate, and since it took all night to transcode, I was hoping to get
some input from somebody here.
Rather than a trial and error process.

Its too simplistic to just take a target bitrate and plug in the number
for X quality.

The quality of the encoder, the settings you use, the nature of the
actual footage itself.....

Simple answer. Once you go over a hour and a half, your starting to have
to make quality vs size decisions. If the footage contains lots of
detail and action, the quality of you encoder will either shine or not.
Also, an encoder that will do a two pass variable bit rate will probably
get your better results for the size than a fix bitrate. a 6,000,000
average bitrate is a common setting.

Being able to encode your audio in the Ac3 format will compress it quite
a bit and leave your more space for video.

There are many freely avail bitrate calculators about, but one must use
them as a guide, not a set in stone calculation. Again, consider the
nature of the footage.

Also, for home viewing material, getting an inexpensive dvd player than
can handle multiple file formats directly can be a huge timesaver. Xvid,
Divx and Mpg files that can be played direct from their native formats.

A couple of additional thoughts...

- If your final DVD is less than 98% full, then you probably
need to up the bit rate (easiest), or do 2 pass, etc.
The bottom line for me is: "EVERY burned DVD should be
close to 100% capacity."  If I'm not seeing a FULL
burned DVD out, then I'm doing something wrong:-)

- I have not had time to play with my Panasonic ES20's  (or
the current ES15) to see if the special 500 line feature stuff
is as good as the literature suggests.  I suspect it COULD
make a big difference with old LP VCR stuff. Just have not had time
to mess with it. NOTE: "ONLY" the connectors on the BACK
of my ES20 have said features - the features DO NOT work on the front
S-Video / RCA connectors of the ES20  !!!   The cryptic manual,
or tech support, neither understand this.

- probably the single most important part is how the old VCR tape
passes over the read heads when you capture the tapes.
If the tape does not track correctly, or the speed is off -
NOTHING you do will help much. Garbage in, garbage out.
An old VCR box with Dual-Azimuth 4-Head Recording/Playback
may work for you. I picked up a good old Sony SLV-675HF with
remote the other day for a whopping $10, so they are cheap
these days.  A deck with MANUAL adjustment is on my list, but have
not found a bargain on a VCR one yet...

Just Google "bit rate calculator" and you'll get many hits.

Note many commercial movies are at 4800.  I think it's below 4,000 or
so that you'll see a quality difference, but much depends on your
footage, how much motion, etc.  Audio takes up quite a bit, so do not
use Dolby.  As noted, AC3 is a good choice.  You should be able to
burn 1.5, even 2 hrs with no problems with quality, esp since it
sounds like the original wasn't exactly great coming from 8mm and
Hi8.  Watch all settings.  Interlaced, Lower field first, Be sure to
capture, edit, render, and burn with same setting.  For sure never
change upper to lower field first.  Check all the defaults you're
using along the way.  If you have a good quality editor, try applying
video filters to enhance.  Contrast, color enhancement, brighten or
darken.  Doing so will improve quality somewhat, but will increase
render time a lot.  If you only cut or don't do anything to your
footage, make sure SmartRender is applied in creating mpg for DVD
burning.  This means it will not again render mpg footage that is DVD
compliant.  If some form of SmartRender is not used, then many
programs will take perfectly good mpg footage and render again, losing
a lot of quality along the way.

I'm using Nero and always do a two pass encode.
I also have a Philips DVD player that does have Dvvx, but not everyone
who may be using these DVDs will have a sophisticated player - so I'm
hoping to keep this as close to standard as possible.

Note that bit rate isn't the sole factor that determines the final quality
of the video when transcoding to mpeg.

I use tmpgenc for transcoding.  When I want quality, I use either CBR at a
bit rate of 7,000 to 8,000, or VBR with a minimum bit rate of 4,000, average
at 6,000 and high at 8,000.  I use 10-bit precision, deep motion search, and
a few other tweaks which you can find here:

http://dvd-hq.info/Compression.html

I usually encode audio as AC3.

I can easily get up to 90 minutes on a DVD at very high quality and can do 2
hours at very good quality.

How are you capturing (and from what)?

I'm keeping everything no less than about 5,000.

For smaller stuff, for example tape from the latw 80's the battery
would last a whole 15 minutes at best, so there's not much footage.
That I can put a few on one DVD.  But for long stuff, I just jack up
the bitrate and keep it on one DVD.

Aha.  As they say on Mythbusters, "Well, _there's_ your problem!"

Consumer-grade mpeg-based capture cards will, as a rule, not produce the
highest quality video as they are doing single-pass, on-the-fly, real-time
transcodes.  You'd be much better off either getting a cheap Digital8
machine with DV out, or a cheap miniDV camcorder that can do pass-through.
Either of these will produce non-temporally-compressed DV-25 video which can
then be transcoded in your computer (and will also be a lot easier to edit,
if that's your inclination).  If your going to do real-time transcoding,
your video will be of lower quality.

That's another advantage of the DV-25 route.  You can play it back to your

VHS tape.

ALso, I'm doing the MiniDV route as well.  The Hi8 cam is playing the

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; at 6,000 and high at 8,000.  I use 10-bit precision, deep motion
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; search,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a few other tweaks which you can find here:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I usually encode audio as AC3.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I can easily get up to 90 minutes on a DVD at very high quality and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; can
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; do 2
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hours at very good quality.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; How are you capturing (and from what)?

&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm keeping everything no less than about 5,000.

I usually get pretty acceptable results at around 5,000.  There's definite
degradation when compared to the source material, but it still looks quite
good.

&gt;&gt; &gt; For smaller stuff, for example tape from the latw 80's the battery
&gt;&gt; &gt; would last a whole 15 minutes at best, so there's not much footage.
&gt;&gt; &gt; That I can put a few on one DVD.  But for long stuff, I just jack up
&gt;&gt; &gt; the bitrate and keep it on one DVD.

Last year, I bit the bullet and bought a dual-layer DVD burner.  When I want
REALLY high-quality output for a 2-hour project, I burn to a DL DVD.  It's a
little bit of extra hassle because it requires chapter points and deciding
at which chapter to have the layer change, but I usually do chapters anyway.
For a 2-hour DL DVD, I can hit 8,000 CBR and get the best quality video.

&gt;&gt; Aha.  As they say on Mythbusters, &quot;Well, _there's_ your problem!&quot;

&gt;&gt; Consumer-grade mpeg-based capture cards will, as a rule, not produce the
&gt;&gt; highest quality video as they are doing single-pass, on-the-fly,
&gt;&gt; real-time
&gt;&gt; transcodes.  You'd be much better off either getting a cheap Digital8
&gt;&gt; machine with DV out, or a cheap miniDV camcorder that can do
&gt;&gt; pass-through.
&gt;&gt; Either of these will produce non-temporally-compressed DV-25 video which
&gt;&gt; can
&gt;&gt; then be transcoded in your computer (and will also be a lot easier to
&gt;&gt; edit,
&gt;&gt; if that's your inclination).  If your going to do real-time transcoding,
&gt;&gt; your video will be of lower quality.

&gt; Thats what I'm doing.  The D8 camera is on its way.

Good solution.  For my old Hi8 tapes, I kept my old Hi8 camcorder and run it
into a miniDV camera with pass-through that I keep just for digitizing and
getting real-time monitoring when I edit.  Those old Hi8s look pretty good
this way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ALso, I'm doing the MiniDV route as well.  The Hi8 cam is playing the
&gt; came, output that to the MiniDV cam and it records onto MiniDV.
&gt; Fromt here I Firewire it into the PC.
&gt; I tried using my nividia capture card and it sucked.
">

Yep.  Realtime digitization to DV-25 is definitely the way to go, in my
opinion (though I expect we'll hear from others who disagree).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; That's another advantage of the DV-25 route.  You can play it back to
&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt; camcorder and, assuming it has pass-through, use the AV outs to record to
&gt;&gt; VHS tape.

&gt; To hell with those people.

I just coughed up my coffee all over my keyboard. ;)

&gt; They want to watch DVDs they're not coming
&gt; here and I'm not spending another ten hours dubbing that to VHS.

Sometimes I have no choice if I want to expand my already very limited
audience.  A few years ago, I produced a feature length project that was of
considerable interest to a group of 50 to 100 friend and acquaintances.  I
spent two weeks burning DVDs (it was a single-layer, 2-disk project, to
ensure maximum compatibility with set-top players), printing covers and
assembling boxes.  Sure enough, a number of people asked me for VHS copies.
I politely declined and suggested that, instead, they buy an inexpensive DVD
player instead.
