I know quite a few people that are Bipolar I and also OCD. Maybe you
should talk to your doc. I am diagnosed with Bipolar II but I have had
a couple of hypermanic episodes in the distant past. I used to fixate
on certain things and it was explained to me that, because I show
certain symptoms of OCD (there is also a big family of history of
OCD), even though it is not sufficient to warrant a diagnosis and
meds, the hypermania will tend to aggravate it. That's just what my
doc told me... shrug. Take it for what it's worth I guess.

Same thing happens to me...especially aggravated by the
hypomania...that's when everything needs to be cleaned up put in an
exact place, etc.  I could spend all day trying to overhaul the whole
apartment.  If I don't, the clutter or mess drives me insane.

Yes.  It is frustrating when I'm getting ready to watch a movie, and I get
up 5 or 6 times during the movie and have to take care of something.  I
remember not too long ago when it took me like 4 hours to watch a 1 hour
show I recorded...kept hitting pause to go do something (that in reality
could have waited).  I'm also bad about having to use sticky notes so I
don't forget (like the world will end if I forget something as simple as a
movie preview I want to see...I have to write it down right that
minute)...drives me nuts.  I think that is signs of OCD.  I also have
trouble if someone hurts my feelings...can't let it go.  Normal friends just
shrug it off or by the next day are not so much thinking of an argument, but
I have held on to an issue that happened a year ago and I think about it
almost every day..geeze!

I do the same exact thing...I'm getting better with it on my current
meds.  If I say something stupid to someone and they get a little
upset, I'll dwell on it seemingly forever.  You definitely seem to
have signs of OCD.  There are different manifestations of OCD.  You
don't have to be someone who goes through a ritual of washing hands
for an hour,etc. to be dx'ed with OCD.  Like I said in my post.  I do
have some compulsions, but the &quot;O&quot; part, obsessive thinking is my
major problem.  BTW, I get up and down at least 5 times before being
able to watch a movie too.

&gt; I know quite a few people who are considered to be &quot;normal&quot;, but tend to
&gt; show some obsessive(-compulsive) behaviour. Doesn't have to mean they've
&gt; got OCD. For instance, lots of people doublecheck to see if they've
&gt; locked their car, front door, ... (and then sometimes check it again).
">

Yeah.  Though I don't think of it as ocd behaviour.  It's more like
being thoughtful and careful.  It's when you have to check it 10
times...and if you don't, you're veins will crawl and you'll want to
explode because of the anxiety.  Many people are very anal and
organized (another OCD trait), but it's when it interferes with the
normal functioning of your life that there's a problem.  OCD is
considered and anxiety disorder, and is common to co-exist with
bipolar.  I actually just came across an article that stated &quot;...These
bipolar OCD patients had a significantly lower rate of checking
rituals&quot;.  That reminds me of my mental disorder.

I do this too. It's like my brain can't let it go, and keeps replaying
it over and over. Glad to hear I'm not the only one. Do meds really
help this?

YES!! Absolutely.  I have seen this dramatically in my life.  And once
you get a little help from the meds, you can start working on it in a
behavioral therapy type of way too.  But I couldn't even begin to do
that without the meds. Tell your doctor about it.  An SSRI might help,
a mood stabilizer might help, a benzo might help...something out there
should be able to at least help take some of the edge off of it.

That's just it...the replaying over and over like you are in a movie that is
stuck.  Sometimes I can focus on something else to get my mind off of the
situation and sometimes when I am trying to relax, that tape in my head
plays over and over.  The thing is that sometimes the images in my mind are
not nice.  They are scary images I have seen on tv or bizarre things.  Maybe
like something from my past like seeing my Dad dead or weird out of the blue
stuff like that.  I hate it, and that's why I am seeing help again, even
though I had been stable off meds for like 5 years...this isn't right, and
it is interfering with the quality of my life.  I'm not sure if it is
bipolar, Schizoaffective, OCD or just pure anxiety.  All I know is that I am
not sleeping or resting and feeling &quot;tired but wired&quot; for like weeks/months
at a time.
