Hi there, I'm thinking paper shredders are such a rip off, there must
be an alternative. Couldn't one just destroy documents a different
way? I know bleach might work but would not be good for the
environment. What about using dishwashing soap? We moved recently
and both of our paper shredders have stopped working due to all of the
junk mail and papers we shred. Plus it takes time to shred the papers
and then you have to wait while they go through the machine. You
won't find anything on any of the search engines about paper shredders
not working, it seems like everything is way too commercialized to
have any information that says paper shredders to not work well. They
would lose all of the advertising revenue they generate for paper
shredders if they had anything about paper shredders not working.

By the way, are there any search engines out there that actually
return non-commercial information you are looking for?

Thanks for letting me rant and rave, any ideas?

Thanks for your help.

Happy with Fellowes Shredmate tabletop cross-cut model. Keep it handy
on the counter where I usually dump the mail. Don't expect to dump in
an envelope at a time, staples, cards, etc. Just use it for individual
papers connected with name or address. If you require more heavy duty
use, expect to pay accordingly.

Right. What's worse, nearly all those &quot;sponsored links&quot; and banners are
scam, or almost. When researching what brand to buy, the banners right away
tell you what _not_ to. The best products, found through epinions, forums,
etc., almost never appear in banners. It's sad that probably 90% of free
useful Internet is in fact funded by scam.

"/> I started reading google.public.support.general last year, because of
the newsgroup archive. But so many of the messages are about how
to get a top ranking in a search result. They hit themselves over
the head to get to the top, doing all kinds of finicky things. And
since everyone else seems to be doing it, it just means they have to keep
doing it.

And yes, many of the posts are about commercial sites. I suspect
it's skewed towards low end &quot;businesses&quot;, but it likely does represent
a good trend. They seem far more concerned about getting a good page
rank, than in doing things that will get attention. They whine so
much that I suspect most of them only have a website, not a business,
and the only thing they do is hope that someone will find them with
a websearch.

A few weeks ago, someone whined because he was not top ranking,
but a mere informational site, actually that has nothing to do
with the thing the poster was selling, was first. He wanted google
to remove the site. So yes, it would seem a lot of such people can
only think of the internet in terms of commercial space.

I'd guess the whiners don't have much of a clue about running a business.
In the old days, people got listed in a business directory, The Yellow
Pages, and paid to do so. It was considered a basic cost of running
a business. Then, they'd advertise or do some other promotion to
get people in early, with the hopes that the satisfied customers
would tell others. They'd need to deal with locals, so they put
their effort into that, rather than hoping that by reaching a potentially
international audience, they could pick up enough crumbs that way. If
the item was unique, there was reason to go mail order, and they'd pay
the money to run ads in an appropriate magazine. They'd try to get
third party articles about their business or thing they were selling,
&quot;free advertising&quot; and send off the product to reviewers in the hopes
that that too would bring in business. It took work to drum up the
business, but it was accumulative, because once people started talking
about the business or product, that would in turn bring in others.

But from many of the posts in that google newsgroup, they aren't doing
any of that. They aren't interested in a site that might come up first
that happens to mention, favorably, their business or product, they
want to come up first, period. They don't see the internet as a tremendous
promotional opportunity, because it makes word of mouth a broadcast
medium and it lets anyone write a review (which can be bad, but it also
means an obscure product or niche product will get reviewed and potentially
viewed by many), they only see a search engine as a business directory,
and the only way to promote their busines or product their website.

They also seem to be missing that even if their site comes up first
in a search, why would anyone do business with them? Unless there
is secondary information, there is no way to tell if that fancy website
way over there is legit, or how good it is. They are playing on
the hope that if they get a high ranking in a search that people will
believe that their business is somehow better than the rest.

"/> Well we bought a ~$50 strip cut shredder a few years ago. Worked fine until
a couple months ago when it started jamming just about every time we used
it. We replaced it with a stronger ~$30 Sylvania cross cut shredder (strong
enough to shred credit cards!). No problem so far. If it lasts a couple
years, I'll be happy. I don't see it as a waste of money. Thirty bucks or
so every 2 or 3 years for peace of mind? No problem. But if you want a
really reliable alternative, find an old 55 gallon barrel somewhere and burn
your documents in the back yard. (might want to check with the local fire

"/> A really unreliable alternative, you mean. When papers burn, more
often than not some unburned fragments rise on the column of hot air
and are scattered far and wide.

These days I think shredding is about the only safe alternative,
though it's only a matter of time till that's not enough either.

A few days ago I found a cancelled check in my back yard -- account
number, name and address, and SIGNATURE. Being the good person that
I am, I did what the account holder should have done -- shredded it.

I have a model by Xerox that has worked rather well. It does not
require oiling, which is a big plus, and it can handle up to 8 sheets at
a time. It cost about $50 @ Staples a couple of years ago - I am sure
this model has been replaced but so far it has worked well.
Given the jerks out there trying to rip off identities, it seems a
worthwhile investment to me.

I do try to reduce the amount by only shredding that which actually has
identifying information on it. Occasionally when I am in a pissy mood [
;-) ] I bundle up all the unindetifiable junk, place it in the
postage-paid envelope, and mail it back so they can put it in THEIR
landfill, not mine.

Junk-mailing bastards!

could find a DSL reseller that would just give me connectivity to the
backbone, and let me keep my current ISP, cheap. I'd go cable modem, but
these apartments have their own baby cable system, and don't offer it. Hell,
even a decent dialup would be nice- this far from telco, best I can get is
28,8.

"/> My ISP is actually a non-profit one, and they make a big fuss about
how they aren't like the big ISPs. But it doesn't actually translate
to anything. Almost two years ago, they turned off the newsgroups
&quot;temporarily, for two weeks, while we move&quot; and then kept telling
us they'd be back soon, until four months later when they told us
the &quot;supplier wants to charge [or charge more], and it's not fair
to raise the rates for a few, so no more newsgroups&quot;. This followed
a few years when they had been buying newsgroup access from elsewhere,
and it was not all that great. Methinks they had no intention of
keeping newsgroups, and just (as they had in the past with other things)
done it in a slimey way.

So I telnet into this &quot;freenet&quot; to get news access.

I know the types of people running my ISP and they talk community but
they fear technology. So the members are not interacting in any way,
a result of management decisions to kill off the newsgroups. And
when it comes election time, regulations call for an AGM each year,
they don't bother using the internet to get people involved and
get things talked about. What a waste.

The only times I've seen newsgroups mentioned in the local paper
in the past year was in reference to questions asked about getting
binary newsgroups. So the most visible thing is that they can get
illegal stuff from newsgroups. Never mind that there is discussion
going on, in a very radical form. And the only times I've seen
mention of newsgroups in past years was with the caveat &quot;there's
lots of spam, and there isn't much of value said&quot; or words to
those effect.

Another reason to use a shredder is a legal one. The police, the
press, and your neighbors can legally search thru your trash. But if
you shred it, you have created an expectation of privacy that the
police need a search warrant to overcome.
But of course the Feds have shredded the Bill of Rights with the so
called Patriot Act, and they can issue warrants to themselves without
going to court, and its use isn't limited to terrorism. But it still
works with the states. For now, anyway.-Jitney

I don't think there's real conspiracy between the government and ISP's. I
think it's more likely to occur &quot;naturally&quot; with the aid of recent U.S.
immigration politics oriented at bringing into the country illiterate
people. While many civilized countries create programs to bring the
brightest, educated, etc. (New Zealand for instance has scoring system where
education gives quite a number of points), U.S. are doing their best to
bring hordes of cheap uneducated workforce, mainly from Mexico, even as
illegal immigrants.

Such politics have wonderful benefits for the corporations and the
government: dissent becomes less likely; consumer requirements to the
products shrink, so it becomes possible to sell low-quality junk made
offshore for the same price (one example being usenet no longer offered,
though the price of the service did not go down), thus skyrocketing the
profit margin; cheap labor; easier manipulation by mass media (consequence:
even more silly movies); etc, etc. Degradation.

I bet if some major ISP provided the percentage of their customers using
usenet, it would not exceed 2%. And declining.
