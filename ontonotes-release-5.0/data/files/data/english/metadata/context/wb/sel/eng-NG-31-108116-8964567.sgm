&quot;I'm not in favor, generally, of using violence on dogs.
However, some sanity here. Momma Dog punishes her
puppies using some discomfort/pain, or &quot;violence&quot; - her
teeth.

In view of that, I think anyone who is rabidly against
&quot;violence&quot; by your definition, in the training of dogs,
is either a troll or needs to have their head examined.

Electric fencing can be pretty cheap.  Fido-shock makes
a dog-strength charger that's around $40.  A couple hundred
feet of wire, say $15-20.  Get either pound-in T posts or
some PVC pipe for posts, $1-3 each.  Only need 'em every
10-15 ft.  If using T posts, you need plastic clips for the
wire, about $4 for 25. IMO best fence for confining dogs is
a combination of physical barrier and hot wire at top and bottom.

I use elec. fence to keep dogs on my property, out of the
road and away from the livestock, and it works like a charm.

&quot;Frankly, I'd rather see them shot than dumped.
*(dumped = set free, turned loose, unmolested, TPW)

My preference would be for neither, naturally -
to a rescue, or keeping the dog. Cripes, it doesn't

Not terribly likely, if you run it along the *inside*
of the fence.  The one at the top can be offset a bit
inward rather than directly above the top of the fence.

You can also put up small signs that say &quot;Caution -

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Me and my girlfriend have finally saved up enough money to
&gt; fence in our back yard. We have decided on 4 foot chainlink.
&gt; Even with a 6 foot privacy fence neighbors can look right over
&gt; from their decks.
&gt; We were going to try a underground fence only but after reading
&gt; up and talking to people the risks just arent worth it.  I realise
&gt; some people have had them for 15+ years but they are just a
&gt; accident waiting to happen.

&gt; We have a beagle named Pokie. Very stubborn and frustrating
&gt; but a wonderful dog.  I have posted several times about our
&gt; troubles with her.

&gt; She is picky about where she takes a dump which takes 30+
&gt; minutes on walks. I'm starting to think Pokie has ocd, which is
&gt; something I also suffer from.
&gt; Anyway back to the fence questions. I was thinking of running
&gt; the radio fence wire through the chainlink to prevent her from
&gt; digging out. When she was left in the care of a relative they
&gt; caught her red handed trying to get under a chainlink fence.
&gt; This wasnt her real home though and she might of been
&gt; nervous.

&gt; I do not plan to leave her outside at night or when we are gone.
&gt; I would like to feel safe letting her run around during the day
&gt; when I'm home. I've heard underground fences are wonderful to
&gt; keep dogs from digging under or jumping the real fence.

&gt; Do you think the underground fence would cause the dog to
&gt; be vicious? I will monitor closely to make sure kids or other
&gt; dogs are not teasing her. She has never biten anyone but about
&gt; got a hold of a guys pant leg once.

&gt; She also went nuts after the ups guy when I was walking her
&gt; but they were all in our yard and she didnt know them.

&gt; Or is there another solution for staking down the fence
&gt; or something? Also with a 4 foot fence do I have to worry
&gt; about other dogs jumping it? I've seen it happen only once
&gt;  in about 20 years. I've heard since dogs are territorial generally they
&gt; will stay out especially if there is a fence.
">

I would use a regular electric fence in addition to the chainlink, not
a
&quot;radio fence,&quot; if possible.  I realize it
might not be possible in the city.  There are pet-strength
chargers available for about $40.  It comes in a kit with
10 short plastic stakes and 100' of wire.  One brand is
Fi-shock or Fido-shock, something like that.

You can buy insulator clips for chainlink fence, and
more wire, at a home improvement or feed store (about
$5-8 for 25).

Run one wire on the inside of the fence at 4-6 inches
from the ground, and that should deter digging out.
You must keep shrubs and grass from touching the
wire, or it grounds out and doesn't shock.

I'd also think about a 6ft fence rather than 4 ft if
possible.  4 ft doesn't seem tall enough to me, even
for a Beagle.

I'm the one who ignored your advice. I did it
because of how you write/wrote. I was unwilling
to accept the idea that my using a shock collar
could have any bearing on Peach not wanting
to stay home.

Up until I started using it my main concern had
been keeping my dogs in their own yard.

Once I started using the e-fence... well, then my
concern became how to keep them from running
off for days on end.

I lost valuable training time becoming embroiled
in the anti-shock debate and the &quot;Jerry sux&quot; tirades.

I lost one dog but I have the bestest dog in the

stays in the yard, and doesn't bark all the time.

We just installed a PetSafe brand fence this Spring.
Two dogs, two collars We now have one dog and
no collars.

Peach and Zelda would run thru the fence, not want
to come back in the yard and would run for days.

The last time, Peach didn't
come back home.

I used the Wit's End Training Manual to learn how
to train my dog. She is now border trained.  A few
minutes each day reinforces her desire to stay in
the yard.

She no longer runs out into the road, I can stop
her from chasing cats and she no longer cringes
when we walk around the yard.

I can not say loud or long enough how much I
hate the e-fence and its collars.  If you can't get
a regular fence then you need to train your dog.

I will never rely on an electronic collar to
keep my dog in our yard again.

The price was too high:-(

Hi folks,

In my opinion the use of a radioshock fence
is a waste of time, effort or money. I can
understand it if you a rich snob who cares
nothing about their dogs safey or behaviours.

At work I boundary train all the dogs to the
bricked area (Four kennels with 26 cages
with 1 dog in each, 1 services building and
2 catterys which is surrounded by scrubland
to the east and woodlands to the north and
a lake to the west).

This works well, because then when people
buy them the dogs are easier to boundary
train to a door or fence or yard.

However on a personal note, my two shelter
mutts, who I trained using the WITS END
DOG MANUAL available at www.doggydoright.com
will not go past the back door, or the back
gate or the front gate without permission.

And it is nice, for when you are having a party,
you can leave your gates open for people, and
your dogs won't be the least concerned.

I find this better then spending your well
earned money on a piece of junk Why
not use it to invest in a horse? Or a new
house? Make a nice aquarium? Build a
nursery for a child?

Save your money. Train your dog. Please.

You mean the history of the old dogmen, the Pit Bull

&gt; &gt; to *not* attack?

That's correct. Leash laws and &quot;responsible management&quot;
and ETHICKAL breeders have all but ELIMINATED the 'survival
of the fittest&quot; aspect of dog society, that is, if dogs was
allHOWED to run loose the SMART WELL ADJUSTED WONS would do
FINE and the stupid and careless self absorbed fearful WONS
would step HOWET in front of a car in front of their HOWES
like janet boss's DEAD DOG or be too stupid to go when told
to into her crate inside with the AC on in 104F heat and COOK
like janet boss's ELDERLY DEAD DOG dogs or just GET MURDERED
like that little DEAD DOG in &quot;interested in hearing&quot; janet
boss MURDERED on accHOWENT of she COULDN'T SHUT OFF the two
SHOCK SYSTEMS that made him AFRAID...

&gt; &gt; If pit bulls become the dogs that &quot;must be kept seperated

Yeah, she wants to be PALS but then gets SCARED.
IT'S THE SAME SAME as when dogs or kats come over
for attention and then suddenly growl or attack
their owners. It's CAUSED by REFLEXIVE MEMORY
FEAR of bein hurt and intimidated somemore.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This sounds more like a kinda meeting, greeting
&gt; behavior than &quot;I want to kill you.&quot;

That's correct, flick. When she starts nipping it's
on accHOWENT of REFLEXIVE MEMORY and she PAINICKS.

Perhaps THEN her handler scolds her and REINFORCES
HER FEARS, flick. ALL AGGRESSION IS FEAR. ALL FEAR
is CAUSED BY MISHANDLING. That means all FEAR can
be EXXTINGUISHED NEARLY INSTANTLY by simply pupperly
handling the dog.

She got NO CON-TROLL over it. THAT'S HOWE COME we
