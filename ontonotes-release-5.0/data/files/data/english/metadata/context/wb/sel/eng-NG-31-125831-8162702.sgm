Hi,

I've recently purchased a new HD TV. I currently have Sky+.

Can anyone give me their opinion on whether its worth upgrading to Sky HD
now or is it best to wait a bit?

Many thanks

Dave

Yes if you can afford it.
A large HD TV with no HD content is a waste.

No, unless you like wasting money.  Most of the HD stuff is films and if you
are mad enough to sub to sky movies ...

Only worth it for sports fans. I have the full package plus HD and the only
time I watch HD is for sports where the difference is stunning. With a Sony
large screen Bravia LCD TV 'V' series the picture quality is so good that
the difference between SD and HD on normal programmes and films is hardly
noticable. After nearly a year I watch 99% SD and 1% HD.

Another option to get HD content for a suitable TV (which IMHO is well worth
doing!) is to buy a Sky-HD STB off eBay (buying from Sky they will insist on
the £10/month Sky-HD subscription) and to just use the HD-box for BBC-HD
(which has some stunning content for free!) and as a future-proof Sky+ box.

Sky-HD can be added at any time later.

Depends on what you want out of it really.
I just had my HD activated this morning after the install last week.  There
are not many HD channels and some of them do not have proper HD content all
the time.
One thing I have noticed though is that the picture on my standard channels
is much improved.  I used to get some motion blur sometimes in programmes
but now that seems to have gone. Have yet to test a lot of programmes for
motion blur, but so far its looking good.  For me that is a massive plus
point because the blur was irritating.

As ever with electronics it is always best to wait because prices will
always inevitably come down.  So really the question is only whether you can
afford it now and whether you are prepared to pay for what is really a
partial service.  I don't blame sky for the lack of content because its up
to the broadcasters and programme makers to make sure their content is
filmed in HD.

Have a look at the HD channels in your planner and see if they have the sort
of programmes you want.  Find a programme and press your i button and on the
info bar it will say HD if its HD.

Finally, even though I am a very new customer to HD and have barely used it,
I don't have a feeling I have wasted my money yet.  Just to have standard
programmes look so much better was worth every penny.  Even Zone Reality
picture has improved and I never thought that was possible ;-)

Err that might not be what it seems.

If you had a shitty black plastic unshielded SCART before or were stupid
enough to be running your connection in SCART composite mode, or perish the
though using RF, switching to the HDMI interface would improve even the most
DOG infested DOG shit TV picture.

I'll let you into a secret: Topfield TF5800 PVR (on &quot;Freeview&quot;), Sony FQ75,
very high quality shielded SCARTs with heavy copper shell ends, twisted
pairs, and extra shielding, of course RGB mode, UPS power supply, and a
long-calculated strategy of carefully placing equipment and power supplies
away from each other where possible.

It will knock the pants off my old Sky setup using black plastic scarts.

Oh, and I don't do channels with DOGs. DOGged channels always have inferior
PQ to the ones without DOG shit.

If scaled SD looks as good as HD something is wrong somewhere! I have seen
people post they turn the sharpness down because they can't stand the detail
in HD. Turning a HD set into a large SD set this way would make both appear
the same.

After all people have been complaining about crap MPEG2 DVB for years and
that hasn't improved. Scaled DVD looks very good, but scaled SD soccer on
ITV remains as crap as it's always been, if not worse due the use of a large
screen and scaling!

No wonder, ITV doesn't even broadcast at full SD resolution to begin
with. A little more bandwidth wouldn't hurt, either.

We are seriously thinking of going back to Sky+.  On our second box in a
week.  The HD picture is very good but not the WOW pic we have seen.  The SD
channels are not as good as they used to be unlike one poster.

We recorded War of the Worlds in HD and it took 12% of the HDD.  You only
get 160GB of the 300GB for your own use.  The other 140GB, is for Sky
Anytime - the rubbish Sky download for you.  After seeing the first load of
rubbish, Sky Anytime is now turned off.

If you have Sky +, all you get in the upgrade is a Sky HD box, (no matter
what they tell you when you book the upgrade) and a shrug when you comment
on the bad picture.

So, with not having a great picture, losing the ability to record as much if
it is in HD, the lack of channels available at the moment, and paying £10 a
month for the privilege .................

and yes we do have a brand new HDTV with QED HDMI cables before anyone asks!

It does depend upon the quality of the scaler in your TV. You may find
letting your TV scale SD from a SKY+ box produces a better picture than
letting the SKY HD box scale it. On the other hand with careful set-up you
may find that the SKY HD box does scale SD better and it's worth having just
to be able to watch SD adequately on your HD set. It's all a bit of a pain
when everything worked &quot;out of the box&quot; with SD CRT's.

P.S. you can still let your TV scale the RGB output as you did with your old
SKY+ box. There isn't a law against having the Scart RGB and HDMI connected
at the same time.

The third party software which is used to copy the drive image of the
supplied to the new larger disk preserves the Anytime reserved area
otherwise you get problems. But 140gb out of say 1000 is not as bad as 140gb
out of 300gb.

DigitalSpy has had a long running thread on this. They recommend building
you own external multidisk drive with a SATA connection.
People have posted about using two 750GB drives in an external sata bay.
You can then just open the HD box, remove the hard drives connection, not
the drive itself, and connect the long sata cable in it's place. Evidently
there is some kind of warrenty sticker on the drive mount which has to be
destroyed to remove the installed drive.

Yes and no, it still reserves the same amount of space on the bigger disk.

However, I turned it off recently after a worrying series of box crashes

Leave the Sky-HD STB set to &quot;Automatic&quot; HDMI resolution. This will output
SD programmes at &quot;576p&quot; over HDMI and leave the TV to upscale this to its

&gt;&gt; P.S. you can still let your TV scale the RGB output as you did with your
&gt;&gt; old SKY+ box. There isn't a law against having the Scart RGB and HDMI
&gt;&gt; connected at the same time.

&gt; What result would that give by having two connections?

you can use scart for SD and HDMI for HD - if you think scart looks better.

Unfortunately most &quot;broadcast&quot; Sd is 576i. You can actually create horrid
staircasing trying to deinterlace interlaced material.  So you often get a
better picture just scaling the interlaced material  and let the brain do
the rest. So  576i should have been an HDMI option as well as 576p. Hence
why 576i via RGb can look better.

But LCD TVs (and presumably Plasma as well) are intrinsically Progressive
Scan devices!!! Thus &quot;something&quot; has to deinterlace! As HDMI is always?
going to go a progressive scan device it would seem sensible for the
Sky-Hd STB to do it.

576i is available on the SCARTS etc.

Unfortunately it still doesn't match SD on a SD CRT. People are scrambling
to make SD on their HD sets as good as it used to be and will grasp at any
improvement.

Where is the problem in having  the option to let the TV deinterlace? MY own
DVD's created from DV are deinterlaced better by the TV's DCDi deinterlacer
and that's possible becuase my DVD player has the option to send out 576i
via HDMI.

People have been brain washed into  thinking dinterlacing always improves
things. If the source was film then by all means deinterlace. If not
deinterlacing can create problems if implemented without some form of edge
alignment as the fields where not captured at the same time.

But, given that I now *have* (for better or worse!) an LCD TV, I (and

(on the same TV - for the last 2 years) than using the TV via RGB SCART
(it's a, then top-end, Panasonic LCD - if that matters!).

It would be interesting to now try feeding the same TV via 576i HDMI but, as
it currently is not, I remain very pleased with the improvement over SCART!

It has taken me periodic tweaking over the last year to get to  the point I
get the best scaled SD picture using the SKY HD box outputting 1080i. As you
say that has to deinterlaced, and it must be by the TV and it's DCDI
deinterlacer I like so  much.

&gt;&gt; Hi,

&gt;&gt; I've recently purchased a new HD TV. I currently have Sky+.

&gt;&gt; Can anyone give me their opinion on whether its worth upgrading to Sky HD
&gt;&gt; now or is it best to wait a bit?

&gt;&gt; Many thanks

&gt;&gt; Dave

&gt;We are seriously thinking of going back to Sky+.  On our second box in a
&gt;week.  The HD picture is very good but not the WOW pic we have seen.  The SD
&gt;channels are not as good as they used to be unlike one poster.

&gt;We recorded War of the Worlds in HD and it took 12% of the HDD.  You only
&gt;get 160GB of the 300GB for your own use.  The other 140GB, is for Sky
&gt;Anytime - the rubbish Sky download for you.  After seeing the first load of
&gt;rubbish, Sky Anytime is now turned off.
">

Only trouble is, they're now putting most of the new HD movie premieres
on Anytime, rather than the HD movie channels, so if you don't get them
on Anytime, you end up waiting anything up to a couple of months for
them to turn up on the HD movie channels or you have to watch them in
SD.

You have to  take note of the fact that many 1080 HD displays only support
1080i. What exactly is not &quot;interlaced&quot; about an LCD display creating the
image via interlaced fields? OK the previous field may not be decaying as
happens with a CRT, but there is nothing to stop you changing the LCD
elements via alternative fields rather than  frames.

My Regza only engages it's DCDI deinterlazer if the source is interlaced
&quot;AND&quot; you select it. It doesn't function automatically on the assumption it
must deinterlace because updating alternative fields every 1/50 of second is
impossible for an LCD.
