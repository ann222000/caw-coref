I don't get to Washington very often, but when I do I gravitate to
three monuments.

One is dedicated to Jefferson, the brilliant but flawed poet of
freedom. Another is dedicated to Lincoln, its suffering servant.
The third is for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who demonstrated that in
modern societies, freedom and economic and social justice are
compatible.

Roosevelt's reforms not only helped save the nation from depression,
competing totalitarian visions, and the unrestrained greed of what he
called the "economic royalists"--they have made possible a better, more
dignified life for working people, the elderly, and the less fortunate.

Recently, I came across this passage by Latvian-born British
philosopher Isaiah Berlin which elegantly sums up his accomplishments:

...Roosevelt's greatest service to mankind (after ensuring the victory
against the enemies of freedom) consists in the fact that he showed
that it is possible to be politically effective and yet benevolent and
human; that the fierce left- and right-wing propaganda of the 1930s,
according to which the conquest and retention of political power is not
compatible with human qualities, but necessarily demands from those who
pursue it seriously the sacrifice of their lives upon the altar of some
ruthless ideology, or the practice of despotism--this propaganda, which
filled the art and talk of the day, was simply untrue. Roosevelt's
example strengthened democracy everywhere, that is to say the view that
the promotion of social justice and individual liberty does not
necessarily mean the end of all efficient government; that power and
order are not identical with a strait-jacket of doctrine, whether
economic or political; that it its possible to reconcile individual
liberty--a loose texture of society--with the indispensible minimum of
organizing and authority; and in this belief lies what Roosevelt's
greatest predecessor once describes as 'the last best hope of earth.'

For the last few decades, we've been force-fed the poisonous notion
that justice and freedom cannot mix--and as a result both have
suffered. Roosevelt showed that both are not only necessary but
possible.
