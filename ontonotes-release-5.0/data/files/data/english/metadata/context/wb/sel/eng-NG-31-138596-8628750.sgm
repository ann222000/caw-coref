Everyday Kenyans Taking Stock In a Growing African Economy

NAIROBI -- One ordinary afternoon in a bright,
marble-floored lobby downtown here, the following
conversation took place between two women, a
government worker and a self-employed soapmaker.

&quot;I bought KenGen at 9.90 shillings,&quot; said the
government worker, Josephine Nduta, referring to
her stake in the initial public offering of
Kenya's power company last year. &quot;I sold them at
28 -- I made a lot of money!&quot;

&quot;I also made money on that,&quot; said Mary Kariuki,
the soapmaker, recalling how she used the $1,000
to pay her children's school fees. &quot;I bought
3,300 shares.&quot;

The two women carried on about liquidity and
profit margins, and recalled with pride attending
the first shareholder meeting of KenGen this
year, an event so huge that it had to be held in
the city's largest soccer stadium. About 200,000
people from all corners of the country came like
so many newly minted executives.

&quot;I felt so good,&quot; Kariuki recalled. &quot;It was just
normal, common people. People dressed well. What
impressed me was the number of old women -- they
were coming in their traditional clothes. They
were telling me, 'Yes, we bought!' &quot;

Stock market fever is sweeping Kenya and other
sub-Saharan African countries such as Tanzania,
Uganda, Nigeria and Zambia, where stock
exchanges, along with national economies, have
shown steady gains in recent years as people who
have traditionally invested in cows or land are
learning to trust in the abstraction of corporate
shares.

Perhaps nowhere has the idea caught fire more
quickly than in Kenya. With investment banks
conducting education campaigns in rural areas and
daily newspapers thick with personal finance
sections, the Nairobi Stock Exchange has
transformed in recent years from a rich man's
club into a computerized, mass-appeal institution.

Since 2002, the number of investors has risen
from 50,000 to more than 750,000, according to
stock exchange executives, with much of that
growth coming from rural areas. The exchange's
total value has jumped from $1 billion to $12
billion, amounts that are predicted to swell
again following the biggest initial public
offering in Kenyan history.

Cellphone giant Safaricom, expected to go public
later this year, has attracted such foreign
investment banks as Goldman Sachs to Nairobi for
the first time, offering their services, and
analysts expect that as many as 3 million
individual investors in this country of nearly 36
million will participate.

&quot;People are coming on a daily basis just to see
what it's about,&quot; said Chris Mwebesa, 36, chief
executive of the Nairobi exchange. &quot;We're seeing
more rural folks coming to the market, working
professionals, retirees, farmers, young people,
even students.&quot;

The boom has its skeptics, especially in a
country with a history of entrenched corruption.
And while people such as Nduta have made money on
the whole -- she is using some of it to electrify
her house -- she is also aware of the risk of
losing big. Even so, the boom underscores a
feature of life in Africa that often gets lost
amid more prevalent images of a continent in
perpetual collapse: dogged optimism.

A recent opinion poll by the Pew Global Attitudes
Project found that people surveyed in 10 African
nations were on the whole optimistic about the
future. In Kenya, 78 percent of those surveyed
said life was getting better, even though a
majority also reported that there were times in
the past year they did not have enough money for
food.

It is the kind of paradoxical confidence found in
the bustling lobby of Suntra Investment Bank on a
recent afternoon, where Arnolda Nyangweso was
already making her second visit of the day.

&quot;I have something telling me to buy,&quot; she said,
explaining that she had come for KCB Bank shares
in the morning and decided to return for more in
the afternoon.

Traipsing in and out were the soapmaker and the
government employee, a taxi driver, a
hairdresser, a cellphone vendor, a retired farmer
and others who comprise the more prosaic, if
still difficult, version of life that
predominates here.

Nyangweso grew up in rural Kenya, where her
parents were small farmers. She and her siblings
were able to attend university in Nairobi, and
Nyangweso eventually got into the real estate
business. After a friend introduced her to the
stock exchange, she began investing two years ago.

A large percentage of new investors are women,
who tend to drive financial decisions in
households, just as American women do.

&quot;When I became a mother, I saw that you have to
save,&quot; said Nyangweso, who is 28 and wore a
finely tailored lavender suit. &quot;I want my son to
have a good life.&quot;

After a friend introduced her to the stock
exchange, she began investing two years ago, and
these days she reads newspaper stock tables every
morning.

The Nairobi Stock Exchange is small potatoes
compared, for instance, with Johannesburg's,
which is valued at more than $500 billion and is
among the world's 20 largest.

The Nairobi exchange occupies several
black-and-white checkered floors of a new
downtown skyscraper overlooking the rusted tin
roofs of the Kenyan capital's old colonial
buildings and bustling streets.

Founded in 1954, the exchange was for decades so
small and exclusive that brokers traded shares
over tea in the lobby of the old,
wrought-iron-clad Stanley Hotel nearby. During
the 1990s, the market collapsed along with the
Kenyan economy, but things began to turn around
after the 2002 presidential elections, during
which longtime ruler Daniel arap Moi conceded
power to Mwai Kibaki.

The peaceful transition encouraged investors,
including many Kenyans abroad, to return to the
market. Kibaki also made some key economic policy
changes, such as dramatically increasing revenue
collection, which decreased government borrowing
and allowed for lower interest rates.

With Kenya's economy growing by about 6 percent
annually, Kibaki has also provided tax incentives
to companies that go public. Several companies
have, including state-owned corporations such as
KenGen, whose public offering last year touched
off a wave of excitement across the country, with
people standing in hours-long lines to buy shares.

The offering, intended to raise $8 billion Kenyan
shillings, raised $26 billion and drew in three
times the number of anticipated investors, many
of whom immediately tripled their money.

&quot;People pitched tents outside of our offices,&quot;
said Anthony Wangari, a manager for Suntra.
&quot;Normally we'd see maybe 100 people a day. We
would see about 2,000 a day during KenGen. . . .
We had to move from the building where we were
because the landlord was complaining that numbers
were so big people were messing up the elevators.&quot;

These days, sharply dressed men and women swing
through the heavy glass doors of the stock
exchange building, cellphones glued to their
ears. Inside, an array of people watch the
returns scroll across a big screen in a
theaterlike gallery -- university students,
businessmen on lunch break and plenty of
full-time speculators.

&quot;I started with 30,000 shillings,&quot; about $500,
said Hillary Wandera, 41. &quot;I have over 700,000
shillings invested now. I come here almost on a
daily basis.&quot;

Past a fountain and up a circular staircase,
about 40 red-coated traders sit at rows of IBM
terminals buying and selling via computers, which
replaced the paper system two years ago.

&quot;We're just coming out of sheer hell,&quot; said
Cecilia Njoroge, head of trading for the
exchange, referring to the old system in which
traders would often take three days just to enter
the orders that piled up. &quot;It's like heaven and
hell.&quot;

With Safaricom and other companies wanting to go
public, investment banks are trying to cull
customers not only in Nairobi, a city of 2.7
million, but also in rural areas. Wangari, the
Suntra manager, has conducted seminars for sugar
and tea farmers out in the hinterlands, where he
tries to explain the benefits of investing in
shares rather than land.

&quot;I get questions like, 'What is a share?' &quot; he
said. &quot;And, 'What is my evidence that I've bought
something?' If it's a cow, you can see the cow.
If it's land, you can see the land. With shares
you have nothing to show. It's a big leap.&quot;

But in a country where wealth has been symbolized
by land or cows -- or, in Nairobi, having one's
name attached to a skyscraper -- the symbols of
the upwardly mobile are changing.

More Kenyans are taking vacations abroad these
days. Huge billboards around the city advertise
the accoutrements of wealth -- weekend jaunts on
Kenya Airways to Paris, slender cellphones,
credit cards. Sleek bars and restaurants are
packed on weeknights with young, well-heeled,
cosmopolitan-drinking Kenyans. Glossy GQ-like
magazines offer images of a glamorous life,
sometimes alongside features on wise investing.

&quot;We're becoming enlightened,&quot; said Nduta, the
government worker, who said she has persuaded her
husband to start putting money in stocks rather
than land. &quot;Land is just sleeping capital.&quot;
