9fd2ac.html&gt; announced last night the government of Abu Dhabi has made an investment in
the Carlyle Group, a Washington-based private investment firm with close ties to former
President George H. W. Bush and his family, as well as to top government officials in
the Reagan and Clinton administrations.
&lt; http://www.wnd.com/redir/r.asp?http://www.mubadala.ae/en/content/abou... &gt; Mubadala,
a wholly owned investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, bought a 7.5 percent share of
the Carlyle Group in a transaction in which the deal price was struck at a 10 percent
discount to a valuation of $20 billion for all of the Carlyle Group.
Abu Dhabi is the largest of the seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates and the
capital.
Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the Abu Dhabi ruling family is the
chairman of Mubadala.

&lt; http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=49096 &gt; WND reported
&lt; http://www.wnd.com/redir/r.asp?http://www.dubaiic.com/portfolio.htm &gt; Dubai
International Capital, a private equity investment capital firm that is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Dubai Holdings, has commonly participated in co-investments with the
Carlyle Group.
Dubai, like Abu Dhabi, is one of the seven emirates that form the UAE.
&lt; http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=57749 &gt; WND reported yesterday
Dubai, in a complex set of transactions, is moving to acquire 19.9 percent of the Nasdaq
stock market in New York, in the first equity transaction which would place a Middle
Eastern government in an ownership position in a key U.S. stock exchange.
As a result of the transaction, Dubai will also acquire 28 percent of the London Stock
Exchange, one of the oldest and largest stock exchanges in the world.
The transaction is being made through
&lt; http://www.wnd.com/redir/r.asp?http://www.borsedubai.ae/ &gt; Borse Dubai, a holding
company 100 percent owned by the government of the Emirate of Dubai and controlled by
&lt; http://www.wnd.com/redir/r.asp?http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae/ &gt; Mohammed bin Rashid
al-Maktoum, the head of the Dubai ruling family.

Crony Capitalism Goes Global

by TIM SHORROCK

[from the April 1, 2002 issue]

William Conway, managing director and co-founder of the Carlyle Group, was talking
recently about the media coverage of his bank and the cast of ex-Presidents and former
officials, including George H.W. Bush, James Baker III and Frank Carlucci, on its
payroll. &quot;One of the words that has recently cropped up as an adjective around us--and I
love this adjective--is the 'secretive' Carlyle Group,&quot; he said in an interview in his
offices overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue in downtown Washington. &quot;What's the secret? I
don't think we have many secrets. The reality is, we're a group of businessmen who have
made an enormous amount of money for our investors by making good investments over the
past fifteen years.&quot;

To give Conway his due, Carlyle has done exceedingly well for the 435 pension funds,
banks and investment funds--40 percent from overseas--that have entrusted their money to
one of the world's largest private equity funds. Under the leadership of Carlucci, a
former CIA deputy director who was Defense Secretary in the Reagan Administration,
Carlyle has become the nation's eleventh-largest defense contractor, a major arms
exporter to Saudi Arabia and Turkey, one of the biggest foreign investors in South Korea
and Taiwan, and a key player in global telecommunications, wireless, real estate and
healthcare markets. Since 1987 it has invested $6.4 billion in 233 transactions, with a
rate of return of 36 percent on its completed investments. Carlyle currently has $12.5
billion invested.

&quot;Their basic nature is not to be a long-term investor but buy low and sell high,&quot; said
Philip Finnegan, an analyst with the Teal Group, a Beltway company that tracks the
aerospace industry. &quot;They always look for an exit strategy in whatever they buy. They
have a sense of the stability of the business because of the accumulated expertise they
have.&quot;

That's where Carlyle's global network of statesmen and former officials comes in. Bush
is Carlyle's senior adviser on Asia and makes his money by giving speeches at Carlyle's
investment conferences. Baker, who was Bush's Secretary of State, is Carlyle's senior
counselor and a member of the firm's Asia, Europe and Japan advisory boards. John Major,
the former British prime minister, was named chairman of Carlyle Europe last year.
Carlyle's advisory boards are peppered with corporate executives from Boeing, BMW,
Toshiba and other big multinationals, and men of influence like former Bundesbank
president Karl Otto Pohl, former Thai prime minister Anand Panyarachun and former US
ambassador to Japan (and former Speaker of the House) Thomas Foley. Carlyle's new asset
management group is run by Afsaneh Beschloss, the former treasurer and chief investment
officer of the World Bank.

By hiring enough former officials to fill a permanent shadow cabinet, Carlyle has
brought political influence to a new level and created a twenty-first-century version of
capitalism that blurs any line between politics and business. In a sense, Carlyle may be
the ultimate in privatization: the use of a private company to nurture public
policy--and then reap its benefits in the form of profit. Although the fund claims to
operate like any other investment bank, it's undeniable that its stable of
statesmen-entrepreneurs have the ability to tap into networks in government and
commerce, both at home and abroad, for advance intelligence about companies about to be
sold and spun off, or government budgets and policies about to be implemented, and then
transform that knowledge into investment strategies that dovetail nicely with US
military foreign and domestic policy.

How the Carlyle System Works

A good analogy to the Carlyle system is a Japanese tradition known as amakudari
(literally, &quot;descent from heaven&quot;). Under this system, senior officials from Japanese
ministries retire, only to be instantly hired as senior advisers by the companies and
industry groups they were paid to regulate. &quot;What we're really talking about is a
systematic merging of the private and public sectors to the point where the distinctions
get lost,&quot; said Chalmers Johnson, president of the Japan Policy Research Institute and
author of two acclaimed books on the Japanese system of governance. &quot;The Carlyle Group
is a perfect example. It's the use of former government officials for their access to
government bureaucracies to determine contractual relations. It's inside
knowledge--knowing where the government is going to spend money and then investing in
it.&quot;

In turn, Carlyle executives influence policy--sometimes profoundly. On March 12
Carlucci, who is chairman of the US-Taiwan Business Council, a coalition of US
multinationals doing business in Taiwan, invited Tang Yao-Ming, Taiwan's Defense
Minister, to attend a closed-door summit of US and Taiwanese defense officials sponsored
by the council and key US military contractors, including Carlyle's United Defense
Industries. Tang's visit, which was capped by a meeting with US Deputy Defense Secretary
Paul Wolfowitz, marked the highest-level defense contacts between Taipei and Washington
since diplomatic relations were severed in 1979--and paralleled President Bush's push to
expand arms sales to Taiwan, where Carlyle has significant investments. Carlyle people
also testify frequently before government panels: senior adviser Arthur Levitt, the
former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has been ubiquitous before
Congressional hearings on Enron.

Carlyle's investment philosophy, as described in its brochures, is to focus &quot;on
industries we know and in which we have a competitive advantage,&quot; in particular
&quot;federally regulated or impacted industries such as aerospace/defense.&quot; Its capital is
siphoned into fourteen funds, seven focused on US industries and real estate, four on
Europe and three on Asia. The $1.3 billion Carlyle Partner II fund is the majority owner
of United Defense, maker of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and other weapons systems, and
owns Vought Aircraft, the world's largest supplier of commercial and military airline
parts. Carlyle's largest acquisition took place two years ago in South Korea, when its
$750 million Asia Buyout Fund invested $145 million to buy a controlling stake in KorAm
Bank. Through United Defense, Carlyle owns Bofors Defense, a Swedish manufacturer of
naval guns and other weapons. In its latest deal, finalized March 13, Carlyle is
investing $50 million in Conexant Systems, a spinoff from defense giant Rockwell
International, to manufacture silicon wafers for wireless communications and Internet
supply markets around the world.

The Conexant deal illustrates the extraordinary mix of business acumen and contacts that
makes Carlyle tick. Carlyle's entry into wireless is being led by William Kennard, who
regulated the wireless industry as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission
before being hired as managing director of Carlyle's global telecommunications group.
Carlyle's investment will help Conexant expand its already sizable market in China,
where its wireless division recently won approval to supply a key cell-phone technology
to state-owned China Unicom, the second-largest telecom provider in the world's largest
wireless market. In a convenient twist, China Unicom's national network is operated by
Canada's Nortel Networks under a contract signed during a visit to Beijing by Carlucci,
who was Nortel's chairman from 2000 to 2001.

A classic example of how Carlyle's political connections work was the Pentagon's
decision last year to develop United Defense's Crusader mobile artillery system. The
decision to fund the Crusader, which could eventually cost $11 billion, came after years
of strenuous objections from senior military planners, who said it was outdated, too
heavy and of little use in contemporary warfare. But United Defense's modifications to
the system--and a lobbying campaign by a handful of lawmakers who received a total of
$300,000 in donations from a United Defense political action committee--apparently made
the difference.

Then came September 11 and its aftermath. With the Crusader contract in hand and
President Bush's war in Afghanistan well under way, Carlyle decided the time was ripe to
sell some of its United Defense holdings on the stock market. The initial public
offering on December 14 raised $237 million for Carlyle. In January United Defense,
whose board of directors includes Carlucci and John Shalikashvili, former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said its fourth-quarter profits had risen 62 percent, due in
large part to sales of the Crusader, which received $472 million in the Pentagon's
latest budget.

Those events raised a few eyebrows, particularly at a time when the media were dishing
out daily revelations about Enron's political influence in Washington. Columnist Paul
Krugman described the Pentagon's policy switch on the Crusader as a &quot;very nice gift&quot;
from Rumsfeld to Carlucci, whom Rumsfeld brought into government, and an example of
&quot;crony capitalism,&quot; the Asian model of capitalism scorned by US economists and the
International Monetary Fund [for more on Carlucci, see &quot;Company Man&quot; at
www.thenation.com ]. Conway, who is chairman of United Defense, scoffed at the
speculation. &quot;Frank [Carlucci] is not going to lobby somebody in the Defense Department
about a program for Carlyle,&quot; he said. As for the timing of the IPO, which was organized
after the hijack attacks, &quot;no one wants to be a beneficiary of September 11,&quot; he said.

Friends in High Places

Bush Sr., who chairs the annual meeting of Carlyle's Asian Advisory Board, has not
hesitated to communicate with his son regarding policies that could affect Carlyle and
other US investors in the region--particularly South Korea, where Carlyle could soon
have an investment stake of more than $2 billion. Last spring, after President Bush
stuck a knife in Kim Dae Jung's sunshine policies by saying North Korea couldn't be
trusted, Bush Sr. sent the President a memo written by Donald Gregg, his former National
Security Adviser who once served as CIA station chief in Seoul, urging the new
Administration to ease its hard-line policies.

A few weeks later, in a decision the New York Times described as &quot;the first concrete
evidence of the elder Bush's hand in a specific policy arena,&quot; George W. said he was
willing to talk to the North &quot;anytime, anyplace.&quot; But the President's &quot;axis of evil&quot;
speech on January 29, which North Korea took to be a near-declaration of war, ended any
hopes of rapprochement and led Pyongyang to cancel a February visit by Gregg and several
other former diplomats. Bush Jr. tried to soften his rhetoric during his late February
visit to Seoul but was met instead by the largest anti-American demonstrations of his
career. Conway, however, was sanguine about the investment climate in Korea. Bush's axis
speech &quot;doesn't add to my level of concern,&quot; he said.

In Europe, Carlyle's strategy is to invest in companies seeking to become Europewide and
global players. Conway, who attends the annual meetings of the European board, which are
chaired by Britain's Major, described the advisory boards as an expansive process where
advisers strategize about how to create and nurture companies with a global reach. At
the last meeting of the European board, the consensus was that &quot;all these companies that
have been more single-country companies are going to have to expand onto the European
stage and ultimately a global stage,&quot; he said. &quot;Frankly, if they don't, they'll have a
tough time competing with the Americans and the Asians.&quot; To implement the strategy,
Carlyle acquired and combined three companies, from Italy, Germany and the United
States; in another case, it combined two German and Canadian auto firms.

In buying Bofors, Carlyle and United Defense crossed into an extremely sensitive policy
area. To smooth the process, a member of Carlyle's European board &quot;helped us on that
even though it was an acquisition by a US company of a Swedish company,&quot; said Conway.
&quot;Most people, when you talk about defense assets, tend to get a little bit sensitive,
just as we do in this country.&quot;

Sensitivity is one lesson Carlyle has learned the hard way. Last September, less than
three weeks after the attacks on the twin towers and the Pentagon, the Wall Street
Journal disclosed that the bin Laden family of Saudi Arabia had committed at least $2
million to one of Carlyle's funds. Carlyle quickly returned the money. Conway, in the
bank's first public comments on the incident, said the decision to part ways with the
bin Ladens was made at the senior partnership level. &quot;Anything that had the word bin
Laden in it, you just didn't want to be associated with it,&quot; he said. &quot;Its not that the
people we were dealing with had done anything wrong.&quot; But in the end, &quot;we said, 'Gee
whiz, we'll buy you out at fair market value and get on with our life.'&quot;

Carlyle's Structure

The Carlyle Group is owned by forty-nine managing partners, who hold 94.5 percent of
Carlyle's private stock. (They include Baker and Major, whose Carlyle holdings are worth
at least $200 million if the stock is equally divided.) The remaining 5.5 percent is
held by the California Public Employees Retirement System [see &quot;CalPERS and Carlyle,&quot;
page 15]. The investors in Carlyle's various funds include US investment banks Goldman
Sachs and Salomon Smith Barney; investment authorities in Abu Dhabi, Kuwait and Brunei;
giant insurers like American International Group and the labor-oriented Union Labor
Life; public pension funds in Ohio, Florida, Michigan and New York; and the corporate
pension funds of American Airlines, Boeing, BP Amoco, GM and the World Bank.

Carlyle has distinguished itself from competitors like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette by branding its name on its fourteen investment funds, as
Fidelity does with mutual funds. David Snow, editor of PrivateEquityCentral.net, an
industry newsletter that recently named Carlyle its &quot;deal team of the year,&quot; said the
innovation was the inspiration of David Rubenstein, the lone Democrat among Carlyle's
founding partners. &quot;They've taken the name they built in defense and are stamping it on
funds with different expertise,&quot; he said. &quot;That's the direction the private equity
industry is moving in.&quot; Carlyle's practice of hiring influential statesmen and
politicians has also inspired imitation. Al Gore, for example, was recently hired by
Metropolitan West Financial of California to start a private equity practice, and
Forstmann Little, a fund co-managed by Erskine Bowles, President Clinton's former Chief
of Staff, lists Newt Gingrich and Henry Kissinger among its advisers.

Carlyle doesn't provide investment figures by industry. But its focus on military and
government-regulated industries is illustrated by the breakdown of Carlyle's Partner II
fund, its primary vehicle for US manufacturing, which has 24 percent of its capital in
defense-related companies, 23 percent in commercial aerospace and 24 percent in
telecommunications and energy. Similarly in its Asia fund, 52 percent of Carlyle's
investments are in financial services, where governments are deeply involved in
restructuring the region's banks; 17 percent are in telecommunications; and 31 percent
are in cable TV, industries that are being privatized and are under strict government
supervision.

Carlucci, the mastermind of the bank's defense investments, came on board in 1989 after
serving in the Reagan Administration. Carlyle says that Carlucci has never lobbied the
government. He does, however, get invited to government events of great use to Carlyle
simply because he is Frank Carlucci. According to recently declassified documents from
the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Carlucci met with Rumsfeld twice last year--not
as a representative of Carlyle

business, media, elections, justice, charity, etc., and are used to trick the public
into hatred &amp; wars and out of their lives, money and freedoms, while the propaganda we
are subjected to makes us believe that we have evolved to where such things cannot
happen [remember slavery, apartheid…]. Please share what you learn with others who do
not have access to the internet. This is only a tip of the iceberg. Stop the hatred that
