Before I start, I want to say that I *know* what I paid and how much I
would probably sell this item for. I'm actually interested to see what
range of replies will result from different countries and whether a
brief description is enough for any divvies to *feel* a price
range...andfor a change we could actually discuss an antique!

In my Big Deal I talked about a Victorian games' box. The dimensions
are 30&quot; x 24&quot; x 18&quot; deep. It is made of French polished mahogany of
goodcolour, with inlaid brass at each corner, and has two original
brass carrying handles.

It has a hinged lid revealing a divided lift-out tray with a
compartment under and a hidden pin releases a bottom drawer.

The bottom compartment contains a complete table croquet set. The top
contains misc card games, ivory/bone counters, a wooden chess set and
other odds and ends not in any neat arrangement.

How much would you pay in your area (US, UK, Ireland,Canada, Australia
and any others represented here):

1 As a dealer?
2 As a collector?

How much would you sell it for

3 As a dealer?

Jon

PS OK T. .....$100 to everything

"/> '''''''''''''''
Dear Jon [jeez my 1st dear Jon letter] - Speaking as a US dealer [as a
collector this sort of item, while much appreciated, does not &quot;blow my kilt
up&quot; enough to own] I would pay $350 - $500 hoping to realize $1,250
[probably adding $125 to the asking price to discount at sale].

While this is certainly outside of my normal range of &quot;oddments&quot; nonetheless
I will always try to buy something I feel there is a market for. In my own
areas of specialty, I work on much thinner margins than suggested above.
While my rule-of-thumb [all rules are made to be broken] has always been
100% mark-up - pay $100 - sell $200, I find more and more that I'm buying
for specific clients who will always purchase what I pick-up for them
[afraid that I, as a good source of material, will switch allegiance to
another buyer]. Therefore I'm able to buy at smaller margins knowing that
the quick sale will net a profit without increasing inventory and resultant
costs thereof.

I'm sorry to have wandered into margin &quot;theory&quot; away from the question at
hand, but think this may be the start of an interesting thread, you
shithead.... Whoops, I apologize. The atmosphere here at RA conflicted me
for a moment and I through out a gratuitous profanity and insult. Gawd, it
is insidious.

Seriously, great question, Jon.

I have no idea what table croquet is, or whether that particular game
adds to the value more than, say a backgammon game might. Assuming that
it does not, I would put the dealer selling price around $225.00-$275.00
in the midwest USA.(the lowest priced market in the US). If the box
were carved or ornate the price here would go higher. &quot;Ornate&quot; is
usually more sought after regardless of quality. (Probably from our
1890's Oak love affair :-).

Even if this is a $2000.00 antique, fresh off the Antiques Roadshow, I
can virtually guarantee you couldn't sell it in this area for much more
than I quoted.(IMO)

Do you disagree Tish?

Great idea for a topic, glad you came up with it.

"/> Hi Jon,

First, I'm sorry to hear you're still under the weather.

I'm based (as you know) in the Republic of Northern California, but the
buyers in my immediate area don't seem to be sophisticated enough to
appreciate a games box like yours. The well-off ones are busy building
their new pseudo-English country houses, but I don't know that they're
looking to furnish them with antiques. So I probably wouldn't buy your
box for resale.

It's entirely possible I'd buy it for myself, even though this is not
the sort of thing I normally collect, but I really would have to see it
first to decide what it's worth to me, as the purchase would be based
partly on craftsmanship and partly on sheer niftiness (for lack of a
better word). An upper limit for me based on excellent materials and
craftsmanship and a high niftiness quotient would be around $600.

BTW, I meant what I said about the Irish Hunters. They have the speed and
verve of the Thoroughbred, but most importantly, the strength, size, and SANITY
of the Irish working horse. I wish I could still ride them.

Pax,

Back on subject...

Jon, it's tough by email, but by the sound of it, I'd expect to pay
400-500, and sell for 800-1000. Of course, it may be a 1500 piece for
all I know, but the empty box has to be worth 250...

"/>  Charleen,
I thought the same thing...my buyers wouldn't know what to make of
an item like this. They aren't seen often enough to create collectors and
anyone who likes these types of things in their home went to Europe to get
some old ago. Maybe in a very high end shop...but if I had a chance to buy
it for myself I'd expect to pay $600-$800. If I were to bet money I'll say
that the 'real 'value will be closer to $1,500-$2,000.
If I'm right do I win it?
