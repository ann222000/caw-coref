My feet, as usual, are really bad. I am having trouble walking,
sleeping, etc but the walking trouble is new and my balance is bad which
is new as well. I still haven't heard about a date for my surgery and
the last time I paged my pain surgeon guy, I got bubkus back. Ditto for
the sleep Dr. What gives?  I just can't take it any more. It's the pain
and the sleep that feed each other. I have to hold on in the shower and
even then fell in the tub on Saturday. Nobody seems to care. Work is
getting more and more difficult. I told my pain surgeon guy that I was
having a tough and very painful time walking... bubkus. How can that be?
He works in a pain practice for Christ's sake!! It's just so worng and I
am getting too run down. I am almost at the end of my rope and I don't
have the energy to fight for myself.

Sorry for the rant guys but it's been a really hard time for too long now.

Thanks for listening,
Debs

i'm sorry things are so difficult, Debs.  i have a great deal of
sympathy for what you are going through, and while i wish i had more
to offer you than the idea of putting a chair in in your shower, i (or
rather a friend) found one for under $40, and it certainly makes
showering less painful (and less dangerous).

it is awfully hard to find the energy to go looking for a better doc,
especially when things are as hard as you describe, but it sure sounds
as if you need one.  i only recently found a doc who was willing to
try to help me, and while i'm still only sleeping about 4 hrs, i had
got caught in that vicious pain/no sleep cycle (to the point of not
sleeping whatsoever for eight straight days, due to pain), so i know
exactly what you are talking about.  it makes it nearly impossible to
cope with a situation that nobody should ever have to go through.  it
seems incomprehensible that any doctor would permit us to live like
this, and yet it can seem impossible to find one who does (let alone
willing to do something about it).

simply having someone who is trying to help, and who does care how
awful life is when your only constant companion is pain, has given me
some hope for the first time in a long time.  i hope you will find
someone like that before things get any worse.  i also hope you know
that there are lots of people here who do care, and do understand,
about you and what you are going through every day, because we are, or
have been, in your shoes.  please don't stop looking for someone who
not only cares but has the ability (and willingness) to help.  they
are few and far between, but they are out there.

best wishes for a little less pain,
sadhant

Thanks Sadhant. I really appreciate your words and thoughts. Also, I
hadn't thought about a shower chair. I will have to look into that.

Debs,

Please forgive me. I have been pain controlled for 4 days in a row  -
counting today - and I do not know the cause of your foot pain. My
wife gets horrible pain coming from her heal. She is not one to go to
a doctor but her pain got so bad she went. He offered her cortisone
shots as a temporary pain control measure. The pain got her to try it.
It worked for her about 24 hours later. She said it hurt  when he
performed the injection but the pain relief was worth it.

It is always hard to read this kind of thing. I don't know your
complete situation but wonder of going back to your current doctor and
laying it all out bluntly to him might work. I know more than once I
have had knowledge of a similar situation and the doctor in question
did not really know the extent of the situation. Like anyone else,
doctors can be over-worked or have personal problems of their own that
might make them less than caring at any moment in time. I take this
approach because I just cannot understand the doc neglecting you. If
this is definitely not the way to go then, and as someone else
suggested, I'd suggest trying to muster the energy to find another
doctor.
In any case, we do care and are always here to listen.
Keep the faith

Thanks Mike. I have a worsening case of peripheral neuropthy. I have a
spinal cord stimulator that needs to have the lead moved and nother added.

It's great that you have had some good pain control!! Way to go!

hi debs

you probably already know that bathroom equipment isn't covered by most
insurance plans

the basics like bathing safely and personal hygiene sure go a long way
towards just feeling better about everything else

if finances are tight,  some areas have volunteer loan closets where you
can borrow dme for as long as needed [like the one i help run]

feel free to email me your city or county and i'll be happy to check our
listings and see if there is one anywhere close to you.

be well

paul

I have read your post &amp; the replies and am just grateful to hear there
are some loving understanding &amp; helpful people out there. I assume
&quot;bubkus&quot; means &quot;nothing&quot;; it is an expression I have never heard
before. I hope you get some relief soon &amp; I also hope your despair
improves so you can the little victories (like showering, eating a
decent meal or doing a little cleaning) that we need to focus on to
get us through the particularly rough times. My thoughts &amp; prayers are
with you.

&gt; Ahh Yiddish Slang, one of my favorites.  The word is normally spelled
&gt; Bubkis -- Meaning not only nothing, but less than nothing.  If that is
&gt; actually possible.  Believe it or not, the word literally means
&gt; &quot;Beans&quot;.  There are a lot of Yiddish words/phrases that have made it
&gt; into the everyday American lexicon of spoken English.  Some of my
&gt; favorites are:  Bubbala, Meshuggina, Shnorrer &amp; Yenteh.

&gt; Words such as Cockamamie, Bubbee, Nosh, and the infamous Putz are all
&gt; very common well known Yiddish slang.  There is a ton of Yiddish words
&gt; starting with the letter &quot;S&quot; that most people know as well; Shlep,
&gt; Shmo(e), Shnook, Shlub, Shlump, Shmooz, Shmaltz, Shlemiel &amp; Shlimazel
&gt; (remember Laverne and Shirley)?

&gt; Even the word Phooey is Yiddish, but it has a slightly stronger
&gt; meaning.  Most people think Shlang is Yiddish for Penis, while that is
&gt; true, it is actually a semi-taboo usage.  It really means serpent; or
&gt; more commonly a troublesome wife.  There are even some well known
&gt; Yiddish phrases such as  Oi!, Oi Vai!, Oi, Gevald!, Vi gaits? and Vos
&gt; iz?

&gt; See http://www.alanemrich.com/Class/Class_Practical_Yiddish.htmif you
&gt; don't know what these words mean.

&gt; Most folks know &amp; use the more  common Yiddish slang terms from
&gt; watching stand-up comedy acts. Jerry Seinfeld  &amp; Larry David use a lot
&gt; of Yiddish words in their comedy acts nowadays.  However, a lot of the
&gt; really Old-School Stand-up acts that toured the &quot;Borscht Belt&quot;
&gt; main-streamed many of these words &amp; phrases as they honed their acts
&gt; in the Catskill Mountain resorts during its heyday in the 50's &amp; 60's.
&gt; Watch Billy Crystal's Mr. Saturday Night to get an idea of what that
&gt; time was like.  Also the film Dirty Dancing portrayed a typical
&gt; Borscht Belt resort.

&gt; When these comedians hit the big time in Hollywood (usually first as
&gt; Writers) they began using the terms in TV &amp; Movies.  Ever watch any
&gt; Mel Brooks films?  He uses yiddish slang in all of them.  Woody Allen
&gt; does so as well.  Larry David was a writer long before he was an
&gt; Actor.

&gt; It is estimated that 70% of the working Comedians is the US are
&gt; Jewish.  Some of the more famous ones are: The Marx Brothers, Henny
&gt; Youngman, Milton Berle, Jerry Lewis, Jerry Seinfeld, Garry Shandling,
&gt; Bob Hope, Robert Klein, Mickey Katz, ''Weird Al'' Yankovic, Allan
&gt; Sherman, Jack Benny, George Burns, George Jessel, the Ritz Brothers
&gt; (Al, Jimmy, Harry), Danny Kaye, Alan King, Jerome Lester 'Curly'
&gt; Howard (Horwitz), Yehudah Leib b'r Shlomo Natan ha-Levi. His brother
&gt; Moe was Moshe, and brother Shemp was Shmuel - otherwise known as The
&gt; Three Stooges. The list goes on and on and on and on and on.  I'm
&gt; quite sure other folks here could add to it.

&gt; The &quot;Borscht Belt&quot; was/is an informal term for the summer resorts of
&gt; the Catskill Mountains in Sullivan and Ulster Counties in upstate New
&gt; York which were a popular holiday spot for New York Jews with money.
&gt; Watch Billy Crystal's Mr. Saturday Night to get an idea of what that
&gt; time was like.  Also the film Dirty Dancing portrayed a typical
&gt; Borscht Belt resort.

&gt; See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddishif you have any desire to
&gt; learn more about Yiddish Slang.

&gt; BTW -- I know that was one helluva explanations to your question, but
&gt; the entomology of words &amp; their use in what has become the American
&gt; version of English is one of my weird hobbies.  There is actually an
&gt; entire website dedicated to the origins of words along with the myths
&gt; &amp; urban legends surrounding them @ http://www.wordorigins.org/

&gt; If you enjoy reading, there is a book &quot;Word Myths&quot; which takes on
&gt; linguistic urban legends, not just debunking them, but also examining
&gt; why they are told.  One of the most interesting of all words to me is
&gt; the &quot;F&quot; word, it's history &amp; usage.  Of course like everything else
&gt; Wiki has an entry on it at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck .

&gt; It probably has more false etymologies then any other word in English
&gt; that I can think of.  It is also probably the only word that in
&gt; traditional grammar can be classified &amp; used in all eight parts of
&gt; speech: the verb, the noun, the pronoun, the adjective, the adverb,
&gt; the preposition, the conjunction, and the interjection.  Anyone from
&gt; NY/NJ is more then fully versed in all of its usages without even
&gt; knowing it.

&gt; Isn't this more fun then complaining that life sucks?
">

I have always...well since I could understand the word(s)...believed
that the 'f'' and 'c' words-yes, some people are offended, and, while
I'm known to let loose some good ones, I try to save those occasions
for times that deserve it-when I'm angry disgusted, outraged...when,
imo, the situation warrants it.  And, while I'm not particularly happy
about my situation at the moment, if I accept the fact that my father
will have a long recovery, that his doctors are very attentive, and my
own situation is going all right (except for this f*ing cold I have
which has made me decide to stay away from the rest home today-I can
take a day away from my father better than he and a group of some very
sick, old people, could handle my cold).  Plus, my own medical care,
including pain treatment, has been adequate for the past several
months. And, I'm not particularly angry with any.. Oh, I have a
sentence to finish.  It was hat, I've always thought that those
words(and a few derivatives) were Anglo-Saxon alone-that, of all the
words there are those are the ones that come from our-well, my-English-
Scottish-Irish background  that has come to be associated with
'American'.

Well, the oldest 'f*ck' I remember seeing  in print was a church
bulletin-from colonial New England, pre-witch trials. It spoke of the
ridiculous premise that persons practicing the 'dark arts' could
actually be f*ing Satan and other demons, and even conceiving children
with them.  A few years later, it was no longer assumed to be
'ridiculous' and many were executed.  I don't know if there were
stories of any 'devil children;-but things did get out of hand!

Well, maybe I should be glad that I have no words specific to my
ethnicity.  It does give a good outlet, when you want to let out anger
and frustration-but, that's not all people did.
