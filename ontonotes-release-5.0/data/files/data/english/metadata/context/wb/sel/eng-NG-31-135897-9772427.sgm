Uh, welcome.  But why would you get a PhysX card?

Price compared to what it actually does is pretty out there.  And the fact
that it isn't selling well is making developers avoid supporting it in favor
of software based physics systems.  Considering how powerful graphics cards
and CPUs are getting, the hardware based physics cards are going to be
obsolete quick.  I'd save your money.

Yeah I suppose there is fairly limited games out there,If they were
cheaper they would be a good buy. I hope after time they get popular
and cheap becaude if you wanna play new games you have to change your
graphics card every 6 months (well maybe not that often but its true).
It would be great if physx cards combined with graphics cards could
make a game run more smoothly.You guys are probably right about the
price and the companies staying away from it?
