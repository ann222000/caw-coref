I've been involved with and around dirt bikes off and on since the
late 60s/early 70s.  In that time, the people I've met involved with
this sport have been some of the most decent folks I've met anywhere.
I've mentioned it on here more than once, I'm sure.

Lately, we've held a couple of rounds of a pretty large MX series at
the park I volunteer just about every non-paid moment of my life.  One
was a few weeks back and another this past weekend.  Huge crowd.
Yesterday would have been our biggest turnout ever except for the
round a few weeks ago which drew probably 100 more riders than our
previous biggest turnout.  A different crowd than the normal District
29 crowd.

Lots of half-million dollar motorhomes towing trailers that cost close
to what my house cost.  All towing the 4 bikes (one race, three
practice) that the 9 year old inside needs.  And folks like me with
their not-yet-paid-for bike in the back of their not-yet-paid-for
trucks.  Lest you think this is going to be some class envy thing,
rest assured, it's not.

Three weeks ago, after most of the folks had already pulled out, a
huge 5th wheel was being pulled out and just passing the scoring tower
(where I was).  The fucking 5th wheel fell off the back of the truck.
The guy had not unhooked his truck all weekend.  Driven down from NJ
or thereabouts.  About an hour later, we got a call from one of the
regulars whose 24' trailer disconnected from the back of his truck on
his way home.  The hitch pin was missing.  It had not been
disconnected in several weeks.

Yesterday, my son asked where the huge scratches came from along the
driver's side of my truck.  The ones that weren't there before I left
for the Park.  This morning, I notice the passenger side of the truck
had been scratched from the tailgate to the front fender.  The truck
had never been more than 30' or so away from me at any point during
the day.  Not that I was worried about it - I've had no reason to be
worried about any of my shit in over 35 years of doing this shit.  I
just was near it all day long.  I just talked to one of the other
Board members who I was parked next to or in front of all day long.
His truck was vandalized too.

Now, I don't know if mine is going to be a $500 repair or a $2500
repair, but if you're the piece of shit, pimply faced puke from
somewhere in District 13 that's been doing this shit, AND I happen to
catch you, I promise you that the first thing we're going to be doing
is finding out what sound a shovel makes as it bounces off your pus-
filled cranium.

I fucking dare you to do this shit again, asshole.

Mine's the blue '03 Chevy Silverado.  Parked behind the red '04 F-150
across from the scoring tower.  The trailer was a black 24' enclosed
trailer hooked to a Ford Dually over near the woods.  Get your dad to
bring you back down for the District 13 race in April.  I'll cover
your gate fees.

That sucks big time.

When I first got my Dakota I worried about the same sort of thing
happening... not at a riding area, but just in general. That was
before I backed alongside a metal fence post that a customer of mine
was using as some sort of driveway marker. ;-&gt;

I've never differentiated between any group of folks riding
before.  I'm starting to sense a pattern and I don't like it.
I've never thought twice about leaving thousands of dollars worth
of gear, parts, tools, etc. completely unattended for hours at a
time before.
Starting yesterday, I do.

I've always been concerned about it everywhere *Except* anywhere I
go riding.  Now, it's just going to be everywhere except where I

kids that are essentially forced to race by dads that always

So, you now have your RMD handle on the side of your truck??? :-)

Sorry for the lame humor and the damage to your truck.  Sounds like
birth control is not used quite enough.  Some ice hole keyed my truck
before it was 2 weeks old.  It happened in a mall parking lot parked
out and away from anyone or anything.  I don't understand those types
of far gun ice holes.

I'm starting to get a picture and it involves a certain type of

mini-dads have always contained a good percentage of useless

You think one kid vandal pulled the pins from the hitches, scratched your
truck and your neighbor's truck?

Last Christmas, I backed into someone in a parking lot at less than
walking pace.  I've been with State Farm - homeowners and auto for
over 20 years and never had a ticket or an accident in that time.  My
insurance went up 70% as a result and I was told "it could have been a
lot worse".

I'm not going to make another claim for anything short of a total.

The amazing thing is that your suspicions will probably be proven correct and
they will come back.  Punks like that, besides not having *any* respect for
anyone's elses property, are usually rather stupid which can be used to your

I suspect they'll be back as I'm picturing him/them as someone that's

On a less vindictive note, it could be an autistic kid running loose
all day with no supervision.  I say this because we have an autistic
kid at church who, when not supervised, runs around dropping
tailgates, setting off alarms and causing all kinds of mischief.  You
will find out soon enough, and if it is a rare possibility that he IS
autistic, please don't cave his head in.

I would not expect that to be the case based on a lot of what's

Cameras. Is all of Spodely's stuff already down in Florida?

Helmet cam pointed at a hitch pin was my first thought. Entrap the fucker by

Also the criminal always returns to the crime ( to see what damage he did).

&gt; Nope.  I think it was a group of them.  They're also getting on the

check with local fire dept, they might be upgrading....
you can track down the source of the "interuptions" with signal meters.
Lo-Jack on police cruisers use the 4 antennas 19" each and they recieve the
signal and carefully measure the time delay between the antennas to
triangulate the source...  check with a local radio shop that deals with HAM
radio or Sideband equipment.. they might like to come out &amp; field test some
of there equipment just for giggles &amp; grins... i hate to introduce the FCC
into the mix because the radios you might be using are reserved for family
channel or should i say not commercial use... back in the 70's? the FCC had
about a dozen stations in the USA and could pinpoint Illegal CB stations
within a couple miles.

That simply isn't possible on FRS (460-465 MHz range) unless the monitoring

First, I doubt the FCC cares much about interference on FRS, just based on
personal observation, unless modified/illegal equipment is being used on FRS
frequencies.  However, while a bit pricey, Scrape, you could go with a GMRS
(General Mobile Radio Service which shares some frequencies with FRS and some
not) license and equipment.  As an actual FCC licensee you have much more
standing with regard to getting interference resolved.  Also, if you can "go
where they ain't" by selecting a non-shared with FRS channel, you'll have a
higher chance that the perp won't be able to jam you.

There should be an option available even if it's aquiring a license as a
business.

&gt;&gt; I'm shopping.

&gt;Due to a change in employers and a new requirement to get a *business use*
&gt;endorsement for the traveling car, I shopped around this year after spending
&gt;20 with Prudential (later bought out by Liberty Mutual)

&gt;Went with Met Life with a net reduction of 32% on the annual premiums. Tried
&gt;about 8 co's altogether with a mix of local reps, national offices and the
&gt;on-line purveyors, Met Life had them all cold

Good info.
Thanks.

What about using the unlimited minutes feature on a mobile to mobile
"conference call", using bluetooth earpieces?
Would it be too noisy?

&gt;That simply isn't possible on FRS (460-465 MHz range) unless the monitoring

I go through a local insurance agent.  They deal with a number of
companies, and shop the lowest rate for me.  The agents make
commissions off of the policies, but they must get a lowered rate too,
because I call around every couple of years and my company is always
the lowest.

You ought to try calling a local agent and see what they can come up
with.

Not sure I could get all the track personell on the same plan or
find batteries that would last 10-12 hours even if they weren't
too noisy.
