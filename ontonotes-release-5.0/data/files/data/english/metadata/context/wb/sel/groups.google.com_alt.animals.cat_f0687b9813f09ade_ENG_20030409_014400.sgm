Hi,
I am new to the group and would love your help. I have an 8 year old cat
named Whipper and a 3 year old dog named Nilla. The dog is very curious
about the cat and would like to play. The problem is the cat hisses and
swipes at her whenever she is within 5 feet. Is it possible to get the cat
to relax enough to figure out that the dogs means her no harm?

"/> We have a Springer Spaniel (Charlie) who would love nothing better
than to devote his life to chasing cats. There's only one problem. The
kitties adore him. They snuggle up next to him. They stick their heads
in his food dish and try to help him eat. They groom his ears.

On the other hand, we have two stray cats living in our barn. They've
been there for several years. (I think someone dumped them off on the
road by our house.) The two cats in the barn have never gotten used to
Charlie. They hiss and growl and snarl and don't want a thing to do
with him.

I think much depends on the individual cat and dog and their
individual personalities.

I guess personality of the animals do play a huge part. I was just hoping
for a less tense relationship. Oh well....

Well I have seen several cases of Cats &amp; Dogs getting along in the house,
and even playing with each other! A friend of mine has a black male cat &amp; a
black lab female. Both are grown adults although the Lab has a very
teen-age and sort of child like mentality &amp; attitude. They play and
rough-house all the time and the dog doesn't over-do it even though it's
obvious that the Lab could pulverize the cat if she wanted to. But the dog
grew up with the cat in the house, well, apartment. So I don't know if that
has anything to do with it or not, I'm sure at the very least it had a large
influence in how they react and play with each other. It's quite a funny
thing to watch them play with each other. The Cat doesn't hiss or growl but
they have a blast playing with each other. It makes me roll in laughter
whenever I go over there &amp; watch them play. hehe, I guess it's a good kind
of therapy for me ;-)

I also have a friend with an Akida or Akitta or something like that (sp?)
and two house cats. The dog is very protective of the house &amp; even the
cats. If someone is being too rough with the cat(s) the dog lets em know he
does NOT approve. Nothing violent mind you, just the dog is pretty much a
Security Guard &amp; Police Man rolled up into a dog. Very friendly dog &amp; cats
though and they get alone very well. The Dog gets cleaned up by the cats in
hard to reach places so my friend had to start brushing him a whole lot to
get as much of that loose long-haired fur as possible so the cats don't get
giant hairballs. They even added some anti-hairball dry food for the cats &amp;
add some anti-hairball additive into the cat's wet-food to help em out as
well.

So that's two cases of cats &amp; dog's getting along well. Now as for my cats,
lol, that's a different story! Here's a little info on my cats. The oldest
of the two is named Guy even though she's a girl, it's a long story so I
won't get into it. But she's about 12 or 13 years old now and I belong to
her. I'm pretty sure she chose me as her husband b/c she treats me as
though I am exactly that. She sleeps with me and nobody else, she expects
me home at a certain time of day and if I'm late she lets me know about it.
I love her to pieces and treat her very well. She is a Seal-Point/Color
Point Siamese with a show-quality body in all but 1 way even now at her
old-ish age. The only way she does not qualify to be a show cat is has a
deformed front paw with 3 toes instead of the normal issue. We raised her
in our first of two litters of cats we bred back in like 1990 or 91, don't
remember which year for sure. If you want a pic of her email me &amp; I'll send
it your way. Anyway, our other cat is named &quot;Mister&quot; who was named by my
little sister about 9-10 years ago now. He is a Siamese version of
Garfield! He is a very Large cat in all ways except courage ;-) hehe. He
is quite large boned and has HUGE paws. He's a very loyal and good cat
though &amp; we love him even though he's a big sissy for most things, lol.

Ok now, Just yesterday we were upstairs an my next-door neighbors brand new
Jack Russel puppy got &quot;free&quot; from the house somehow and wandered to our
front door. My cat 'Guy' was walking to the front room and saw through the
glass screen door this little puppy. Imeadiatly she went into &quot;Cheetah
stalking her prey&quot; mode and became totaly stealthy. It's quite funny to
watch, hehe. Of course 'Mister' had to come see what she was looking at &amp;
when he saw the puppy his tail 'POOFED' up into a grand demonstration of
manly-ness. His back arched like I've never seen him do, it was too funny.
What a time for a camera! My mom was here and she went to the front to see
what was going on &amp; saw the puppy. She opened the door and picked him up &amp;
brought him inside. I see her holding this little white puppy with a brown
patch on his left eye that just loved the whole world &amp; everything to do
with it. And he wasn't afraid to lick anything either! lol, ok so she
brought him into the kitchen &amp; 'Mister' followed her with his back still
arched really high &amp; his tail Poofed up to tell the world how Manly he was
and litteraly scooted across the floor behind Mom on his tip-toes! I about
died of laughter. Mom got into the kitchen and after we talked for a minute
or so went back to the front door to take the puppy back to his home.
Mister continued his Manly parade behind mom to the front door and about
died of laughter herself when she saw how he was acting. No hissing or
fussing from either cat, although Guy stalked the puppy behind mom at a fair
distance behind as to not be detected until she pounces.

So that was fun, man I wish I had a camera with me!

well, enough for this novel. email me if you want a pic of either cat, man I
wish I had a camera with me! That would of been so cool to have on file. I
guess the memories will have to suffice ;-)

Cats tend to like to be the one to approach...Dogs tend to rush into
everything which makes cats nervous. I know of a cat and rottweiler that are
best friends. Anytime the cat gets in trouble guess who they run to for
protection...
