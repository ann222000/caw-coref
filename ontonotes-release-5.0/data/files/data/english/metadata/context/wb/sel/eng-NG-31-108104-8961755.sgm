The vet just called and said that when they got the cast off they saw that
the skin on his leg was almost flayed - there's even one spot where the skin
is gone completely!  They're going to keep him over the weekend so they can
leave the cast off and allow his leg to heal a bit.  She said that they will
have to put another cast on because, even though the bone is healing nicely
it's still not strong enough for him to go without one.

I'm so upset - I didn't even know he was in pain!  I know how much it hurts
when I've rubbed a blister on my foot but still have to walk around in the
same shoes all day - I can't even imagine how bad he much have been hurting.
I'm just sick about this.  I'm second guessing myself now about agreeing to
leave him at the vet - I know they'll check on him, but he'll be there alone
and they have more than just him to see to.  They're closed now so I can't
get them to say I've changed my mind.

Please, please send some healing purrs to my poor baby - and some good
thoughts to let him know that I didn't abandon him in a strange place, alone
and in pain!

Dunzi is sitting here purring madly and Sarsi will be on purring duty
just as soon as she wakes up from her current coma (it's cold and
there's a nice bit by the raidiator)

We are all on full alert (apart from Sarsi but she will know when she
wakes up and I tell her) and purring madly for little Archer

Poor little guy!  But at least it's very much for his own good, assuming TED
knows how hyperactive he is &amp; to keep him sedated or less mobile.

Purrs for Archer's ordeal to prove successful and for both him and your

Keep in mind he may be a little more subdued at the vets than at home so it
may be a good thing.  I know your feeling down but anything that lets
Archer heal better will be good in the long run.  I know this has been hard
on you and D.H. as well as Archer but you know how many folks are out
&quot;here&quot; thinking good thoughts for all of you and I hope that helps a
little.  As for me I can't wait to hear about the first &quot;good safe&quot; trouble
Archer gets into once he is better. :)

He will be okay CN.  His life is not in danger.  It might not be very
pleasant for him for a bit but it's not going to leave him crippled or
risk his life.

There are some good points here, that at the vet's he might have some
of the p*ss &amp; vinegar taken out of him, so he will be quieter with
that injured leg, and they can make sure it heals right and that he
doesn't overdo it.  Then they can give him a comfier cast on Monday.

Kumani didn't like being at the vet's so much when she was sick, but
there they could give her IV and if she threw a fit from her fever
they would be right on hand to give medicine if she needed it.
Nocturne stayed at the vet when she had her hernia so that she would
be on hand for the vet to operate ASAP the next day (They were going
to make her wait 2 days! but by leaving her there, we got her in
within 24 hours...and before you yell at the vet, SEVERAL other vets
said she was just sore from her spay, when in fact she had split her
stitches inside!)

I think you are probably taking it worse than he is. ;)

Purrs for both of you.  Archer will be just fine.

Purrs for both of you from all of us. Many cats sleep through this
sort of situation and he is better off without the temptation to try
to do his normal thing all the time.

Rest and healing for Archer and peace of mind for you.

Oh, poor little guy.  Sending whatever purrs Hobo can muster along with
best wishes for all of you.   I sympathize with you, Lori, I know how you
feel leaving him at the vet's.  Hobo had such a horrible time when left
overnight in February (almost killed him, *literally*) and he's never
gotten over his terror.  I've sworn I'll never let him spend another
night, would rather rush him to the ER if we have to.  Anyway, good luck
to the little fellow, he's having such a rough time.  Hugs.

I have to wonder, they can keep him at the vet without the cast on, and you
have been keeping him in a crate at home.  That sounds like he ought to be
able to be at home without the cast as well.  Especially since he is having
such a problem with it.

But I'm sure that has occurred to them and to you already.

I think the cage we have is the problem.  I wanted him to have as much room
as possible since I knew he had to stay confined for six weeks, so we bought
the biggest dog kennel Ben could find at PetsMart.  It's big enough for him
to climb up the inside and I think that's how he got the idea to shed his
cast - he would get in wedged in the bars and then twist around and pull his
leg.  I think that's how he got his skin so flayed - all the twisting and
tugging kept scraping the inside of the cast against his leg.

I did ask the vet about us buying a smaller cage (one the size of the vet's
cages), but she still thought he'd be better there - I think because they
can give him injections of pain medication (at least I hope so, I was so
rattled when I talked to her that I didn't ask nearly enough questions, and
then when I thought of them it was too late, they were closed for the
weekend).

I've been sobbing off and on all day, second-guessing myself, but that's not
doing a whole heck of a lot of good, so I just have to try to convince
myself that he's best off there.  You guys have been helping me a lot with
that, so I really am grateful for all the support and purrs.

Hugs,

Oh, poor baby!  Did they give him something for pain?  You know, when
it quiets down there, chances are he'll sleep.  It  must feel good to
him to have that cast off, no matter what else is going on.  It really
is the best place for him to be right now-with the vets and the techs
available to confab with, and to watch for any problems that come up.
Purrs are going out for you and young Archer...now and through these

OMGOMGOMG!!!!

I've seen my share of sores caused from casts but I can't imagine what
that must look like.

The poor guy!!!  Though I know you must feel bad, I'm sure he is in
good hands at the vet's.  I know that as a tech I take cases
especially those when the animal stays overnight very seriously and
you do develop a bond with the animal and the animal eventually learns
to trust you as you give them care and love.

Right now infection would be the biggest worry and I'm sure they have
given him something for the pain.

When he does get better enough to go home, I'd really ask the vet for
some tranquilizers.  Acepromazine is something we will prescribe
animals we know to be 'energetic' to help keep them calm so they don't
injure themselves.

big purrs from me and my threesome and purrs for your wallet too.

Lori,
You can leave him there for two weeks and he won't know you've left
him two weeks.  He knows you've left him there but it has been my
experience that a cat will forgive you fairly quickly if not right
away.  All of ours are just so happy to have us home that they forget
to punish us.  Granted ours have a sitter come in so they don't have
to stay at the vet in a cage.  But he's in a cage at home so that's
not different. He's going to be fine staying with the vet.  You're
going to sleep better not worrying about him and when the two of you
are reunited you'll both be in better condition to deal with each
other. You are doing the right thing for both of you right now.  Trust
your instincts.

&gt; &gt; I have to wonder, they can keep him at the vet without the cast on, and
&gt; &gt; you have been keeping him in a crate at home.  That sounds like he ought
&gt; &gt; to be able to be at home without the cast as well.  Especially since he is
&gt; &gt; having such a problem with it.

&gt; &gt; But I'm sure that has occurred to them and to you already.

&gt; I think the cage we have is the problem.  I wanted him to have as much room
&gt; as possible since I knew he had to stay confined for six weeks, so we bought
&gt; the biggest dog kennel Ben could find at PetsMart.  It's big enough for him
&gt; to climb up the inside and I think that's how he got the idea to shed his
&gt; cast - he would get in wedged in the bars and then twist around and pull his
&gt; leg.  I think that's how he got his skin so flayed - all the twisting and
&gt; tugging kept scraping the inside of the cast against his leg.

&gt; I did ask the vet about us buying a smaller cage (one the size of the vet's
&gt; cages), but she still thought he'd be better there - I think because they
&gt; can give him injections of pain medication (at least I hope so, I was so
&gt; rattled when I talked to her that I didn't ask nearly enough questions, and
&gt; then when I thought of them it was too late, they were closed for the
&gt; weekend).

&gt; I've been sobbing off and on all day, second-guessing myself, but that's not
&gt; doing a whole heck of a lot of good, so I just have to try to convince
&gt; myself that he's best off there.  You guys have been helping me a lot with

Don't beat yourself up, good grief, he's a lucky cat that he has a
slave
who has taken care of him. He'll survive this, Lori; and he'll forgive
you
(they always do)....I promise, they *know* when you're trying to help
them.
I've thought about Archer a lot. I've just never heard of a cat to
break
a limb (and so badly) from such a freak mishap. Think maybe he
was malnourished before you got him, and his bones aren't strong? Did
the vet say anything about vitamins, or other supplements to help
the healing, and make his bones stronger? (I'm mentally filing this
info. away in case [God forbid] I ever need it.

No, the vet and I talked about that.  Archer was in his litter box right
next to the garage door.  My garage door is 33 years old - it makes a *LOT*
of noise and sort of jerks when it starts to open.  This scared Archer so
bad that he took off at the speed of light and when he got to the door going
into the house (the bottom of which is 6 inches higher than the garage
floor), he hit his &quot;shin&quot; on the door sill.  Archer, I believe, was the runt
of the litter - his bro-fur Ozzy is much bigger and heavier-set than Archer
who could be described as &quot;having a delicate build&quot;.  So a combination of
his shin bone being small and light, the height of the door sill and where
on his leg he it, and the speed he was running when he hit it combined to
break the bone.

It's not actually a bad break, it's just that it's in a bad place.  The hind
leg tibia (or &quot;shin bone&quot;) takes the brunt of the force in walking, running,
and jumping.  And, being a kitten, he doesn't allow a little thing like pain
or a broken limb to slow him down.  The few times he's gotten away from me
when I had him out for petting, he's 1) run down the stairs to jump on
Sammy, 2) climbed to the top of the cat tree and started to jump down when I
frantically grabbed him, 3) run downstairs and jumped up onto the window
sill to look out at a squirrel, etc.

Thank you, Kristi - it was good to hear that from a vet tech.  They do
really like him at the vet's - besides being a little lover boy with sad
eyes, he doesn't ever try to bite or scratch (I keep his claws clipped in
case of accidents ) - instead he'll just lick your hand when you're doing
something that hurts him.

I *will* ask for some tranquilizers for him when he comes home Monday (I

Sometimes they just don't recognize a frantic mommy when they see one.  Most
ER's do not allow parents in the treatment room.  You don't hold your own
child while they get stitches, etc.

Only I look very calm and in control.

Same with my furkids.  I can always hold them still for darn near any
procedure.  Including s dental on a dog that was too old for anesthesia.

But those are the only times I get home and get a glass and a bottle and sit
in a corner.

You probably have &quot;frantic mommy tranquilizers&quot; in the fridge or the
liquor cabinet (Don't have one, I like beer and that's it- last
January we ordered a blow out from our local Indian takeaway and
because it cost so much they gave us a half bottle of white wine-it
should be very nicely chilled it's still in the fridge! Last Xmas I
got a couple of bottles of wine and champagne given to me at work and
they are still in the filing cabinet at work- I might have a Drambuie
at the end of a meal and that's it)

When we took Fugazi and Isis to be spayed....Well it seems to be
slighlly different in the UK, we were going to a council run spay/
neuter scheme for people on low income (We were at the time) (I am
saying nothing against them- the care they gave was so good that when
the time came for the current Fabulous Furballs we looked for the
place but it's no longer run) and we took them in for 11.00am and were
told that they would be ready to go home about 2.00-3.00 in the UK
it's unusual for queens to be kept in overnight for an uncomplicated
spay

So we had 3-4 hours and the place was a long way from home so we went
to the nearest pub to get something to eat and we sat there...remember
this is the first time we have ever submitted our tiny little kittens
(okay they weren't that tiny but at the time to us they were
ESPECIALLY at this particular time)...taking small doses of &quot;Frantic
mommy and paw tranquilizers&quot; and syaing things like &quot;They'll be fine&quot;,
&quot;They've probably done it by now and here we are sitting worrying over
nothing&quot; &quot;I'm sure they'll be okay&quot;

And had hanging in the air between us- what if something goes wrong? I
have an unfortunately vivid imagination and was imaging going back and
having the vet say &quot;I'm really sorry but.....&quot;

2.00 came and we both said &quot;They said between two and three let's give
it another half hour&quot; because we were by now half dreading the worse

Finally we gritted our teeth and headed back to collect them..

Isis was most vocal about having been left in this strange place even
through being Isis she had been so well behaved the nurses were all in
love with her and half hoping we'd tell them we didn't want her so
they could fight amongst themselves as to who took her home

Fugazi had achieved the unusual distinction of having her background
challenged as in &quot;Are you sure she's a domesticated queen? We've had a
lot less trouble off feral toms!&quot;

We're a little more blase these days but you never stop worrying when
they're at the vets do you?

CatNipped have a relaxing evening, Archer's in the best place at the
moment and he will forgive you ( as soon as Dunzi and Sarsi got back
from the vets they explored to make sure none of their best places had
been moved and then it was business as usual apart from the bald
patches)

&gt;&gt;&gt; OMGOMGOMG!!!!

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've seen my share of sores caused from casts but I can't imagine what
&gt;&gt;&gt; that must look like.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The poor guy!!!  Though I know you must feel bad, I'm sure he is in
&gt;&gt;&gt; good hands at the vet's.  I know that as a tech I take cases
&gt;&gt;&gt; especially those when the animal stays overnight very seriously and
&gt;&gt;&gt; you do develop a bond with the animal and the animal eventually learns
&gt;&gt;&gt; to trust you as you give them care and love.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Right now infection would be the biggest worry and I'm sure they have
&gt;&gt;&gt; given him something for the pain.

&gt;&gt;&gt; When he does get better enough to go home, I'd really ask the vet for
&gt;&gt;&gt; some tranquilizers.  Acepromazine is something we will prescribe
&gt;&gt;&gt; animals we know to be 'energetic' to help keep them calm so they don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; injure themselves.

&gt;&gt;&gt; big purrs from me and my threesome and purrs for your wallet too.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Kristi

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Kristi - it was good to hear that from a vet tech.  They do
&gt;&gt; really like him at the vet's - besides being a little lover boy with sad
&gt;&gt; eyes, he doesn't ever try to bite or scratch (I keep his claws clipped in
&gt;&gt; case of accidents ) - instead he'll just lick your hand when you're doing
&gt;&gt; something that hurts him.

&gt;&gt; I *will* ask for some tranquilizers for him when he comes home Monday (I
&gt;&gt; wish they'd give out frantic mommy tranquilizers too!!).

&gt; Sometimes they just don't recognize a frantic mommy when they see one.
&gt; Most ER's do not allow parents in the treatment room.  You don't hold your
&gt; own child while they get stitches, etc.

&gt; Only I look very calm and in control.

&gt; Same with my furkids.  I can always hold them still for darn near any
&gt; procedure.  Including s dental on a dog that was too old for anesthesia.

&gt; But those are the only times I get home and get a glass and a bottle and
&gt; sit in a corner.

LOL!  Yep, I'm the same way - except I can't drink alcohol, it makes me
deathly ill.  I usually just take a long hot bath with candles lit instead!

Try this they put the pair of them in seperate cages at which point
Isis started crying and set every other cat in the place off apart
from Fugazi who was having a wash (and planning). The nurse allowed me
to fill in one consent form for both cats otherwise it would have
probably been too much for Dave and me and we would have snatched them
up and run out- I mean Isis was crying like a lost soul obviously
thinking she was being deserted to face her doom...

We left, Isis (phd in emotional manipulation of Hoomins and emeritus
professor of feline cuteness) immediately gave the nurse the full on
head tilt, wide eyed, pathetic mew and was stroked and behaved like an
angel, the nurses could not believe it, they lifted her out of the
cage, she snuggled up while they carried her into the operating room.,
she purred like the little angel she could be as the needle went in,
rolled over and went to sleep happily. After all was done, apparently
they took her back and she was purring and asking to be stroked when
they put her back in the cage

I suspect they thought &quot;Now we have to do the little angels
sister...bound to be the same&quot;

So some unwary nurse reached in to take Fugazi out only as soon as she
opened the door Fugazi came out, landed on her shoulder and tried to
make a run for it. By the time, they rounded her up at least one nurse
was bleeding and it took two of them to take her in.

The first needle went flying and when the vet bent down to pick it up,
Fugazi went off the table and climbed up the vet leavng claw marks in
his bum so someone grabbed her (probably promised an extra 20.00 in
their wage packet if they did) wrestled her onto the table whereupon
the vet cautiously (because he was worried about sitting down) put the
needle in

Didn't appear to work they now had a groggy mainac who then went for a
nurse leaving claw marks down one arm

Finally they had two nurses hanging onto her for dear life whilst the
vet waved a needle at her and while she was so busy trying to rip it
out of his hand (or trying to rip his arm off she wasn't fussed) a
third nurse crept up behind her and gave her the second dose of
anaesthetic (We should not laugh it took her 2 days to get over it)

We were told this by the nurse who took the understandly groggy Fugazi
out of the pen and made the mistake of saying &quot;Well you didn't get me
did you?&quot; (possibly she was hiding in a cupboard at certain points)
and as she said that her white coat developed a yellow stain as Fugazi
then emptied her bladder over her

Poor archer, and poor you! I can't imagine how difficult this must be
for both of you - Archer for the discomfort he must be causing himself,
and you for having to worry about keeping Archer from hurting himself
worse. But like others have said, don't blame yourself, Lori. Archer is
doing the damage to himself by being a normal, active kitten. It does
sound like tranquilzers might be a really good idea to keep the little
guy from hurting himself.

That is one *willful* little cat! He wants that cast off, and by God,
he's going to remove it, whatever the cost - literally and otherwise.

I think the smaller cage is a good idea - clearly when he has room to
move around, he gets in trouble. Purrs for a quick healing of his skin
and bone, and your nerves and bank account!

&gt;&gt; &gt; Fugazi had achieved the unusual distinction of having her background
&gt;&gt; &gt; challenged as in &quot;Are you sure she's a domesticated queen? We've had a
&gt;&gt; &gt; lot less trouble off feral toms!&quot;

&gt;&gt; LOL!  Yep, I had one like that.  Bandit had the &quot;cougar scream&quot; so down
&gt;&gt; pat
&gt;&gt; that she terrorized vet techs from 30 feet away!  ;&gt;  She gave one last
&gt;&gt; trademark scream to scare the vet tech that was holding her when she was
&gt;&gt; euthanized - I had to smile through my tears.

&gt; Try this they put the pair of them in seperate cages at which point
&gt; Isis started crying and set every other cat in the place off apart
&gt; from Fugazi who was having a wash (and planning). The nurse allowed me
&gt; to fill in one consent form for both cats otherwise it would have
&gt; probably been too much for Dave and me and we would have snatched them
&gt; up and run out- I mean Isis was crying like a lost soul obviously
&gt; thinking she was being deserted to face her doom...

&gt; We left, Isis (phd in emotional manipulation of Hoomins and emeritus
&gt; professor of feline cuteness) immediately gave the nurse the full on
&gt; head tilt, wide eyed, pathetic mew and was stroked and behaved like an
&gt; angel, the nurses could not believe it, they lifted her out of the
&gt; cage, she snuggled up while they carried her into the operating room.,
&gt; she purred like the little angel she could be as the needle went in,
&gt; rolled over and went to sleep happily. After all was done, apparently
&gt; they took her back and she was purring and asking to be stroked when
&gt; they put her back in the cage

&gt; I suspect they thought &quot;Now we have to do the little angels
&gt; sister...bound to be the same&quot;

&gt; So some unwary nurse reached in to take Fugazi out only as soon as she
&gt; opened the door Fugazi came out, landed on her shoulder and tried to
&gt; make a run for it. By the time, they rounded her up at least one nurse
&gt; was bleeding and it took two of them to take her in.

&gt; The first needle went flying and when the vet bent down to pick it up,
&gt; Fugazi went off the table and climbed up the vet leavng claw marks in
&gt; his bum so someone grabbed her (probably promised an extra 20.00 in
&gt; their wage packet if they did) wrestled her onto the table whereupon
&gt; the vet cautiously (because he was worried about sitting down) put the
&gt; needle in

&gt; Didn't appear to work they now had a groggy mainac who then went for a
&gt; nurse leaving claw marks down one arm

&gt; Finally they had two nurses hanging onto her for dear life whilst the
&gt; vet waved a needle at her and while she was so busy trying to rip it
&gt; out of his hand (or trying to rip his arm off she wasn't fussed) a
&gt; third nurse crept up behind her and gave her the second dose of
&gt; anaesthetic (We should not laugh it took her 2 days to get over it)

&gt; We were told this by the nurse who took the understandly groggy Fugazi
&gt; out of the pen and made the mistake of saying &quot;Well you didn't get me
&gt; did you?&quot; (possibly she was hiding in a cupboard at certain points)
&gt; and as she said that her white coat developed a yellow stain as Fugazi
&gt; then emptied her bladder over her
">

ROTFLMAOWTIME!  Man, I needed that laugh!!  OK, Fugazi joins the &quot;hall of
shame&quot; along with Bandit and Nocturne as reigning queens of evil!  ;&gt;

Hugs,

Healing purrs for Archer and nerve-soothing purrs for you - you left
Archer in a place where he can be kept calm and still and where he can
get more intensive care (like pain medication injections and IV
antibiotics) as needed.

Sounds like Nikki. It's nice with a good little girl like Mir, but I do

&gt;I'm so upset - I didn't even know he was in pain!  I know how much it hurts
&gt;when I've rubbed a blister on my foot but still have to walk around in the
&gt;same shoes all day - I can't even imagine how bad he much have been hurting.
&gt;I'm just sick about this.  I'm second guessing myself now about agreeing to
&gt;leave him at the vet - I know they'll check on him, but he'll be there alone
&gt;and they have more than just him to see to.  They're closed now so I can't
&gt;get them to say I've changed my mind.

Oh, this sounds just awful! But I hope that given treatment from TED,
Archer will heal everything, as quickly as possible.
