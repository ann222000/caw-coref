Well, after one of the most idiotic accidents in US air carrier
history, we have (as expected) a bunch of lawsuits. But now we have a
new one...the 'pilot' who flew Comair 5191 off the wrong runaway,
killing all of his passenegrs has decided it really isn't HIS fault
that he didn't follow sterile cockpit rules, and that he didn't verify
he was on the correct runway, and that he didn't even think about the
fact that he was on an unlighted runway that is half the width of the
standard runway, and that he ignored multiple airline rules and
procedures...he has decided that it is the fault of the company that
installed the lighting on the CORRECT runway. The story is at

http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070828/BIZ01/70...

So when we complain about stupid lawsuits that end up hurting us as
pilots, and end up hurting aviation as a whole? Here is one of our own
(altho I don't consider James Polehinke, the FO in question, a pilot
in any sense of the word, since he so egregiously abused his position,
and [thank God] he will never fly again) filing an absurd lawsuit
refusing to acknowledge that he and the equally incompetent Captain
were the ones at fault for the death of 49 passengers. Ahh...the
American Justice system in action.

So, by that Comair F/O's twisted logic: If I am in a bus accident in New
York, I can sue one of the taxicab companies since, if they were better
drivers, I would have taken a cab and not the bus, and avoided the bus
accident.  LOL!!!!

It seems that if he's responsible, the claims against him are valid.  He
should accept responsibility and not try to shift blame onto someone
else.  Keep in mind that companies don't pay for anything, every dollar

If his lawyers didn't do everything possible to shift at least some of the
liability from their client they would be guilty of malpractice. And it
isn't just the FO that is sueing it is the widow of the captain as well.

And to say that companies don't pay for anything is silly. Comair for
example doesn't operate in a vacume. They can't raise thier fares just
because they get hit with a liability suit.

If you continue your logic out, nothing comes out of your pocket either
because you got your money from somewhere and so they are really footing the
bill.

He certainly did.  This accident was caused solely by human error, and all

Either way, it doesn't matter--you still pay for it.

I would agree that where there's negligence (as it appears there was in
this case), individuals and companies should be held accountable.  But
who is really going to win in these lawsuits?  Most likely, the lawyers
win and you (a completely uninvolved individual) pay for it.

Yes, they can, and yes, they do.  Companies do not have their own money;
the only way companies get money is to accept what you give to them in
exchange for products or services.

A frivolous liability lawsuit does nothing but attempt to extort money
from the deep pockets of the company (or insurance company), which is
funded by the company's customers and investors, usually to the benefit
of the lawyers.

I'm all for holding negligent companies and individuals responsible
under the legal system.  However, attempting to shift blame to a runway
lighting company or contractor who had absolutely ZERO honest liability

&gt; A frivolous liability lawsuit does nothing but attempt to extort money

While I am also convinced the flight crew was primarily at fault, I
can't agree that the lighting company/contractor had &quot;absolutely ZERO

would know that:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; On Aug. 25, 2006, the airport issued a notice to
&gt; &gt; pilots that &quot;numerous lights&quot; on the main runway

&gt; &gt; 26, Polehinke landed at Lexington on a flight from
&gt; &gt; New York. The captain of that flight told the
&gt; &gt; NTSB that only about an eighth of the edge lights
&gt; &gt; on Runway 22 were lit.

I don't think this is a huge stretch.  If nearly 90% of the lights on
4/22 were out the night before, it would not seem strange that 100% of
them were out the next morning.  They were not primarily responsible,
but I really doubt that they have &quot;ZERO honest&quot; liability.

Not an excuse, but another link in the chain.

As Gig said, they don't operate in a vacuum -- they operate in an extremely
COMPETITIVE market that has little leeway for mistakes. For a company
operating on thin margins, such a hit may well prove fatal (no pun
intended). It's the economic version of Darwin's law (not to mention
Murphy's).

Um...no, Gig!

We have a legal system to find deep pockets; we (ostensibly) have a Justice
system to assign liability.

Just thought I'd clear that up! :~)

So, to remove their liability, does the lighting company have to smack the
pilots over the head to get them to read the notice?

I'm afraid I must disagree. The PILOTS made the decision to take off,
even knowing the runway lights were shaky. The lighting company may
have been a number of things (i.e. in breach of their contract,
technically incompetent, etc.), but in terms of THIS accident? They
bear absolutely no responsibility whatsoever. None. Neither does the
controller who turned around after making sure they acknowledged the
correct runway. Nobosy else does, other than the two 'pilots' who were
charged with being professional enough to know not to takeoff from the
wrong runway.

While there are always multiple 'links' in the chain, that is vastly
different from 'responsibility'. There are always 'could haves'. But
in the end, a professional pilot is charged with making the correct
decisions, and being competent and professional enough to protect the
safety of those who have (literally) entrusted him with their lives.

If the pilots felt uncomfortable with the lighting situation, all
EITHER of them had to do was say &quot;This is not safe, and I refuse to
takeoff from this runway. The airline can fire me if they wish, but
we're going back to the gate.&quot; While difficult to say, that would have
been ALL that was necessary to protect the lives of their passengers.
But they didn't. They didn't do LOTS of things that were their
responsibility to. How much more fundamental can a responsibility of a
pilot be than to make certain you are on the right runway????

The pilots here have 100% of the responsibility for this accident.
Other parties bear absolutely none.

I know it may sound pedantic and arrogant to say, but when you accept
a unique trust (in this case, a trust placed in you by your pasengers
to protect their lives, by virtue of your special skills,
professionalism, and understanding), you bear a deep and profound
obligation to honor that. Either one of these guys could have quit and
gone to work at McDonald's if they didn't feel up to the
responsibilities of being a professional pilot. Obviously they FELT up
to the task. They just weren't. And because of that, 48 innocent
people died (the Captain died by his own hand...I know it sounds
harsh, but I don't have a lot of sympathy for him, altho I feel sorry
for his family). Because of this I find it particuarly repugnant that
one of the 'pilots' who killed 49 human beings because of his
incompetence is trying to extort money from an INNOCENT party, to help
pay for injuries that nobody but him and his Captain are responsible
for.

Cheers,

Cap

Not much liability gets assigned to parties without assets.
