I need to get your input on a purchase I think is rather good.

I can buy an iMac G5 2004 model 1.6 gHz in great shape with airport
card and bluetooth mouse and keyboard for under $500. That's great
isn't it?

Is there anything I should know about this particular model? Anybody
got one they like or dislike?

thanks
ray

It depends on the screen size.

17-inch 1.6 GHz iMacs are selling for $450-500 on eBay.

Apple skimped on the 17-inch to keep the price down.  The  20-inch
models are much better performers and their selling prices - at least
$250 more - reflect this

The G5 iMacs have one weakness: many have developed power supply
problems.

I and my husband both have the 20in model and have been happy with
them so far. The only problem I've had has been since Bluetooth began
not always connecting with the keyboard and it's just gone back under
AppleCare as they didn't fix it properly. It's a lovely machine, I
think, with its big screen. We didn't get the Airport card. I read
about the overheating troubles and was nervous for a while but it
hasn't happened to us.

Regards
Susan

Hi,

Some iMac g5's had issues so, go here first:
http://www.apple.com/support/imac/g5/ and look on right side of
page for:
Exchanges &amp; Extensions
• Repair Extension Program for Power Supply issues
• Repair Extension Program for Video and Power issues

Would also suggest checking for problems via a Goggle search for
exact iMac g5 model and see: everymac.com
macfixit.com, macworld.com  and see: everymac.com and look for
specific model.

Does it come with original box &amp; packing and discs? Does it have
Applecare?  If yes, it probably means it was well cared for!

You will not be able to use many of the features of Leopard which
needs an intel CPU.

How are you going to use the iMac? Use &amp; expectations are the key. Is
this your first Mac?

Before you buy, have you considered a refurbed intel iMac?
Smalldog.com &amp; others still even have brand new 20&quot; &amp; 24&quot; frosty
white iMacs
at great discounts; check out:
- the Apple Specials which post after midnight:
http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/
RSLID?mco=A35F9A4&amp;nclm=CertifiedMac

-Search refurbs via dealmac.com, or, smalldog.com, powermax.com,
expercom.com, macsales.com,

Some dealers still have open box &amp; demo, white intel iMacs, too.

-Apple offers Leopard for $9.95 if it does not come installed on your
iMac: http://www.apple.com/macosx/uptodate

*You can p/u extra Ram &amp; Applecare for less by doing a dealmac.com
search or from dealers above, or off eBay or from MUGS:
http://www.apple.com/usergroups &amp; http://MacOSG.com

*Apple offers discounts for students &amp; educators. This may be for you!

Get a newer intel Mac, with better CPU, better Video Graphics,
Superdrive, etc.
