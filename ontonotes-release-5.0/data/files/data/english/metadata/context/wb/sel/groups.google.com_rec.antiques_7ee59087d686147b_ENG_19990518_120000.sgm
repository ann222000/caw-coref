&quot;Settled&quot; ... is not a word one should use when referring to Ireland,
or at least, be cautious in its context. The wild men of the Scottish
Highlands have been here long before auld St. Pat himself, and the
Brits have been here since at least the 12th century. I doubt the
druid had much depressed glass.

There was of course fine Anglo-Irish furniture and objects, but that
was always confined to small pockets, mainly Dublin, the East Coast
and parts of the North-East (now Northern Ireland) and always, the
lions share residing in the English landlord's country estates or the
'planters' (the modern settlers) houses. What the Brits didn't take
home with them or steal, the Irish burnt, what the Brits didn't burn,
the Irish didn't want. It is far too complex a subject for this ng,
one rebellion, one genocide, one famine and one destruction of a
nation would sound very much like any other to most US ears, but the
end result, meant we had to import.

And with regards to good Irish pine, (before you ask) it's all gone,
gone long ago .... and gone where? aha! the 64 million dollar

Ronnie, I don't quite &quot;have you sussed,&quot; or I wouldn't be asking! &lt;g&gt;
What exactly is it about American collectibles you don't like. Note I'm
not talking new collectibles like McDonalds toys, Furbies or BBs, but
more along the lines of Bakelite jewelry, transferware, depression
glass, typewriters, Boontonware - I'm guessing here on some of things,
but if I'm wrong, you'll clarify your position, I'm sure. &lt;g&gt;

Would _I_ call them antiques? Probably not (yet), more in the
collectible range, but I'm wondering if you think they won't stand the
test of time???

Regarding Ireland - I know the high points of your history, but wasn't
aware the land remained um... er... shall we say &quot;tribal&quot; for as long as
it did... when I think Medieval Europe and I throw Ireland in too
(castles, small villages, etc)...

Regarding pine... what's left here in the US is pitiful too - there is
no old growth pine, no good &quot;heart pine&quot; at all - what we've got now has
wide rings, warps easily, and is of very poor quality. Which brings me
to a question I've been wondering... but I'll post it under its own
subject though...

I guess I still don't get what you say us USians don't get... we
appreciate good antiques, but there are things we'd call antiques that
you wouldn't... and while we might have a larger quantity of 17th
century whatchamacallits, we've got 250 million people to spread them
around, so in effect, we've got relatively less antiques.

So... those with a hankering towards the past start collecting memories
instead - items from their parents' youth, their grandparents' youth,
the items they can just barely say, &quot;I remember when...&quot; because it was
just before their time.

But I don't understand what you dislike so about those collectibles,
many of which, but not all will someday be antiques in their own right?

Have fun, Michele

Hi,

Come to Sweden we have all types of wood not to mention well managed
forests. And here is a list of wood types: (some species have been
introduced)

Broadleaves:

Birch - two species
Alder - two species
European Aspen
Oak - two species
European Beech
Linden ( lime ) - two species
Elm - three species
Hornbeam
Gean ( Wild Cherry )
Goat Willow
Rowan

Coniferous:
Scots Pine
Norway Spruce
Yew
Juniper

A lot of foreign trees can grow in Sweden but of economical interest
are European Larch, Contorta - Pine ( from North Am. )and Sycamore -
maple from Germany.

Interesting wood related info there....

Regarding Art Deco items.......

I am gaining more of an appreciation for Art Deco lighting some of what
I have seen here in Sweden has been very beautiful and decorative
especially when you compare it to its somber late 19th century
counterparts. I think some pieces of Art Deco just have a designed flair
that hasn't been matched since.

Regarding US/North/South American history.....

As far as history of the USA is concerned anyone ever think of Native
American history which predates the European settlers rude intrusion?

First Nations Histories:
http://www.dickshovel.com/Compacts.html

Native American antiquities (pottery and such) are being taken illegally
from reservations and sacred sites as we speak!

My fellow Americans, we have more of a history then most of us think and
what some Europeans would like us to believe! Have some pride!

European invasion begans:
Taken from:
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/5650/timeline.htm

1492 - On October 12,Christopher Columbus, sailing the Santa Maria for
Spain lands on what he thinks is an Island near Japan. He will make four
more trips back to the New World seeking a sea route to Asia, never
certain that he wasn't in
the Indies.

1497 - Englishman John Cabot explores the Atlantic coast of Canada, and
claims the area for the English King, Henry VII. Cabot seeks a northern
water route to Asia.

1499 - An Italian navigator sights the coast of South America while
sailing for Spain. His name is Amerigo Vespucci.

1507 - The name &quot;America&quot; (named after Amerigo Vespucci) is first used
referring to the New World.

1517 -The Protestant Reformation begins when Martin Luther posts his &quot;95
Theses&quot; at a church in Germany.

1519-1522 - The first person to sail around the world is Fernando
Magellan.

1565 - The first permanent European colony in North America is founded
by the Spanish at St. Augustine, Florida.

1584 - Sir Walter Raleigh lands on Roanoke Island and names the area
Virginia, in honor of Queen Elizabeth I.

I love history!

Regards,
Kat

Kat, we still have wood in the US, &lt;grin&gt; but thanks to spotted owls and
such, we can't touch the old growth forests we have left, and farmed
trees just don't have the same quality as the old ones did. We did lose
almost all of our chestnut trees to blight, but there are non-native
chestnut trees here now (growing slowly, but growing).

As to the Native Americans, the term &quot;prehistory&quot; is more accurate than
&quot;history&quot; as most did not have a written language. And truthfully...
they're selling off their own antiquities quite a bit. OTOH, there are
still pueblos in NM that don't allow photographs of their homes,
themselves, or especially, their dances... they are very private people.

The archeologist in me doesn't see a problem with professional digs that
take items away from abandoned sites to be preserved in a museum for
everyone to enjoy. I know a lot of folks would disagree with me, but I
don't think the past should be secluded away by a small group, but
shared with the world.

Half of my family settled here in the US in 1649, they were Dutch
Reformists seeking asylum from Catholic Spain, and they have a long
history in NY state. Unfortunately, the British burnt their town to the
ground (with the exception of one house and the tavern) during the
Revolution, so not much is left from more than 200 years ago. To find
anything older, you need to go south to Florida (then along the coast to
New Orleans), and southwest to NM, AZ and soCA.

Okay... I know I'm rambling... &lt;g&gt;
Have fun, Michele

&quot;No, Tracy, please don't leave! Just send Doug and Ronnie (tatw bach)
to their rooms for a time out, and we'll all be better at chasing out
the ads and culling the newbies. .......&quot;

I just can't understand folk! How can anyone talk about Doug and
Ronnie in the same sentence. Without doubt Ronnie has been the most
knowledgeable and dedicated poster in r.a. since I rejoined last year.
I've kept many of his articles and website references and learnt a lot
from them, even as a seasoned antique dealer/restorer.

Antique dealers are without exception a funny lot. I don't know where
the idea came from (as discussed in this group) that if you like/deal
in antiques you should be &quot;nice&quot;. Most of the professionals I know are
absolute bastards...they are brilliant in their antique knowledge and
business sense...but they'd kill you soon as look at you.

*IF* you are tough enough to stick the course they *MIGHT* start
actually teaching you something. One dealer who regular threatened to
hit meunless I bought something was finally impressed when I got up
courage and pointed out many date and attribution errors in his shop
After thathe taught me so much about the business.....

Personally I don't like bad language or snide comments from anyone,
but I can put up with any amount of this if I learn **anything** about
ANTIQUES at the end of the day, and if I respect the fact that there
is real knowledge behind the bluster. I can also understand the total
frustration that an expert feels when confronted with so much rubbish,
day in day out. If you get the UK Antique Roadshow in the States, then
THAT is the type of stuff we are interested in learning about...not
typewriters, sewing machines, electro-plated cutlery, depression
glass..............

"/> Jon,

I'm not a dealer, and I have only begun to learn about antiques. My
initial contact with the group several years ago was unpleasant but
educational. I got e-mail telling me in no uncertain terms not to
post WTB's. OK, I learned something.

In the past year I have posed questions to the group about several
antiques that have come into my possession. Responses have been to
the point and much appreciated. Ronnie led me by the hand through an
introduction to long-case clocks, with help from several others. Jane
has answered many questions about silver, and has even gone far out of
her way to help me track down information on an obscure family crest.
Just this week you, Jon, added to my understanding of the old brass
oil lamps we both own. I have only had occasion to contribute a few
morsels on glassblowing, my area of knowledge, and the knowledge I
have gained far out-weighs my contribution.
Then there's the dross. The spineless few (one in particular) who
hide behind multiple screen names and ISP's, jumping out to preen and
act the fool. Almost enough to make me say &quot;Adios, amigos.&quot; But not
quite. One can avoid those posters by scanning the headers; one can
also put them in the e-mail kill file.

One suggestion for making the group work better: It's relatively easy
to post images to one's server and to furnish URLs when describing
objects. Some folks may have a scanner or digital camera, but may
lack server space or FTP knowledge. Is there a way to assist them in
posting images? I have noticed that the quality of discussion goes
up, and stays on track better, when there's a visual image to focus on
instead of a fuzzy verbal description. &quot;I have a vase with a lot of
little flowers all over it&quot; isn't a good starting point for
discussion.

I'm sticking around. Learning about my family's antiques has led to
learning more about genealogy, the industrial revolution in England,
the evolution of lighting appliances, 18th and 19th century dining
ritual and paraphenalia, the origin of pasta, well-hung bulls,
porcelain and, today, black-fly repellant in Canada and
moon-dancing.

There are good people here -- people who make this group a rich
resource. Perhaps we newbies don't say &quot;Thank you&quot; often enough to
the more knowledgable members who carry most of the load, leaving them
feeling unheard and unappreciated. We should thank them daily,
because if you think about it, without those expert insights (and
delightful off-topic asides) this would be nothing more than
rec.antiques.marketplace.

Best regards,

Tom Bellhouse &lt;--- really my name!

Jon, I found the UK AR show quite interesting too (the few episodes that
have come over here). I'd never heard of a Battersea box before (nor did
I know most of them are mislabeled and don't really come from
Battersea).

OTOH, us USAians don't get to see 300 year old objects very often. To
us, a 100 year old object is half as old as our country, and quite an
antique. A 200 year old piece of American furniture is so highly prized
(if not refinished), that it's beyond the realm of the average antique
dealer anymore.

Think of it this way... over in the UK, your grandmother may leave you a
17th century chest... here in the US, our grandmothers leave us
depression glass and Roseville pottery. It's an oversimplification, but
I hope you understand my point.

You, Ronnie and the other overseas folks are welcome to discuss your
older antiques while us USAians lurk, listen, learn and ask a few
questions. At the same time, don't berate us for talking about our
favorite collections... they may not be as old as yours, but they often
hold the same meaning to us.

I can't tell the difference between an Edwardian piece and a George III
piece, but I enjoy art Nouveau, Arts &amp; Crafts and even Art Deco...
that's what gets my heart thumping at an estate sale, an auction or
antique shop. For you, those periods barely fall into the Antique
category, for me, they are wonderful examples of a bygone era.

Have fun, Michele

I could have sworn I've seen Irish made furniture from at least 200
years ago (I think it was on Norm Abrams' New Yankee Workshop - he's a
carpenter who likes to build new furniture based on antique designs) -
they were distinctively carved kitchen cupboards if I recall correctly.

Are you saying that Ireland wasn't settled much before 200 years ago, or
that nothing much survives from prior to that? My understanding of the
British Isles is that its people go back quite a few millennium, am I
wrong?

And I think you still don't get us USAians. I know you understand our
love of art pottery and antique furniture, but you don't understand our
love for many items from this century. I absolutely adore porcelain
topped tables, yet I doubt you find much redeeming qualities in them. I
love Craftsman homes which were built with plans bought from a Sears
catalog. I love Chrome (kitchen appliances, on cars, on jukeboxes, even
Formica-topped chrome legged kitchen tables, etc). I love Blue Willow.

I think basically, you don't understand our love of American kitsch, or
at least you don't hold it in much regard. It may not fall under the
legal import/export definition of &quot;antique,&quot; but most of it does fall
under the 50 year rule of this newsgroup... and while we both agree it's
&quot;not the age, but the object itself,&quot; we disagree on what kinds of
objects are worthy of discussion here.

I'm beginning to think that if it's &quot;mass-produced,&quot; it's not a true
antique to you, regardless of age. Am I right?

Have fun, Michele

&gt;Ronnie, I don't quite &quot;have you sussed,&quot; or I wouldn't be asking! &lt;g&gt;
&gt;What exactly is it about American collectibles you don't like. Note I'm
&gt;not talking new collectibles like McDonalds toys, Furbies or BBs, but
&gt;more along the lines of Bakelite jewelry, transferware, depression
&gt;glass, typewriters, Boontonware - I'm guessing here on some of things,
&gt;but if I'm wrong, you'll clarify your position, I'm sure. &lt;g&gt;

"/> It doesn't matter if it's American &quot;depression glass&quot; or British
&quot;pressed glass&quot; or any of the other rubbish largely posted about or
punted in here.

Brit or Yank, it's all mostly household bric-à-brac, its only
redeeming factor for a lot of you folk, is age, and it's monetary
worth. Age, in many cases, equals monetary worth to a lot of these
posters, and so called collectors. If some of you guys can convince
yourselves the whatyacallit is 1898 and not 1901 then it automatically
becomes a &quot;real&quot; antique, regardless that it's still the piece of
shite it was last year or the 100 years ago. And if it meets your 50
year magic number then all is welcome, even although, when it was 49
years old, it was a piece of inappropriate crap. Your logic by and
large makes no sense.

If an appraiser tells you ... &quot;on the open market it's (one's junk)
worth 10 dollars&quot; ... and you say .. &quot;but my dying grandmama gave me
this on her death bed because I always admired it when I was a little
girl, and we both cried our eyes out that night, as poor old grandmama
slowly passed away, clutching this (piece of junk) to her bosom&quot; you
expect the appraiser to say .. &quot;OH well in that case it's worth a 1000
dollar&quot; May be worth a 1000 dollars or 10000 dollar to you, but the
sentiment behind it doesn't count one iota, on the open market,
amongst the wolves it's still a 10 bucks buy, and only provided the
appraiser knows ass from elbow.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Would _I_ call them antiques? Probably not (yet), more in the

"/> Okay... let me try to explain the bric-a-brac phenonena to you... it's
not age, it's MEMORIES. We collect this stuff because it reminds us of
grandma's house, and grandma's house is full of great memories.

The price has gone up in the last 10 years or so because a lot of
Americans are nostalgic, and the supply and demand theory says if more
people want it, we can charge a higher price and they'll pay it.

Some of the confusion on your end lies in the current cost of these
things. Is a depression glass cake plate really worth $400 to you (or me
for that matter)? Probably not... but if my grandmother had one, and I
wanted to recapture the memories of her, I might be willing to pay $400.
The value in the item is the nostalgic memory, not the intrinsic worth
of the piece.

"/> But &quot;junk&quot; is in the eye of the beholder... I sure don't undersand why
some folks collect the things they do - what's up with Tartanware?
Seventy-five years ago, someone took some plaid paper, shellaced it over
a plain box, and now the box is worth $400??? What about fairings? They
weren't high quality but there's quite a market for them... same with
chalkware, carnival glass, tin litho toys, and a hundred other things.

If we keep calling them &quot;collectibles&quot; instead of &quot;antiques&quot; (regardless
of age), would that make it easier for you to understand the American
mentality when it comes to these things?

Would saying collectibles are about memories and nostalgia, and antiques
are about quality make more sense to you?

Have fun, Michele

Hmmm.... what can I say? Different strokes for different folks... I
guess us Americans are all dumb, blind and now speechless? &lt;grin&gt;

Well, not completely speechless... first off, I never heard of Harry
Rinker before I came to this ng - I've recently seen his books in the
stores, but never really noticed them before. And I guess I'm guilty as
charged... if I can find a piece of nostalgia for $5 in a flea market
and sell it for $100 on eBay, then I'll do it... and enjoy it. &lt;g&gt;

and then you said:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ... and in the end, it all has nothing whatsoever to do with antiques
&gt; or the great passion and the hobby of collecting of antiques, that is
&gt; the difference. :)

"/> That's where you're wrong... the passion and hobby is the same... the
thrill of the hunt (especially when you get a &quot;bargain&quot; or find the last
piece to complete a set), the joy of seeing what to you is a beautiful
piece in a store, an estate sale, or wherever. The difference may be in
how long a collectible remains a collectible and/or if it ends up being
an antique - some collectibles actually are quite beautiful, well-made
and unique.

No matter how many times you tell me it's not what you mean, what it
ultimately boils down to is you saying: It's not worthy of the antique
moniker unless it's very old, hand-made and within a narrow range of
what you perceive as quality.

And then I say: people like what they like. Thirty years ago you
couldn't give away a lot of Arts &amp; Crafts stuff in the US - it was just
too old-fashioned for the 50's and 60's. And in another 20 years it may
pass out of favor again. The quality remains, but tastes change and
prices change. Depression glass will go out of favor again, but maybe
just for 30 years and then it'll come back again. Who knows?

As a dealer, I buy what sells. Whether it's tin litho toys or A&amp;C
pottery, or yes, even the dreaded Disney collectibles! I've never called
myself an antique dealer per se, mostly just &quot;dealer&quot; or &quot;antiques and
collectibles dealer,&quot; but in reality I'm a junk dealer, and you wanna
know the truth? It's damn fun!

Have fun, Michele

Michele,

I know you have wood in the USA silly! But I know some types of wood are
getting rarer over there. Even in my native Arizona there are some
problems with a few cactus species. And we always have gene manipulated
(right word?) trees to fall back on &lt;irony&gt;. My parents have a tree in
their back yard that is a single tree but it produces 4 different kinds
of apples. Strange!

Sorry I should have been more clear. I watched a Swedish documentary
(the Swedes are good at these) that did a story
on how artifacts were being dug up from burial sites, rock drawings
carved out from caves &amp; canyons. The artifacts weren't being taken by
trained well educated archeologists but by people who wanted to make a
fast buck and they profiled two people who illegally stole pottery and
destroyed some sites.
One of the things I gathered from the documentary is that the
Native American police have a huge range of land to patrol and its
pretty hard for them to watch everything when there is a only a few or
so of them doing the patrolling on many acres of land and some of the
sites can only be accessed by climbing or by other means.

This subject hits close to home for me because my stepmother is
a Native American and is from the Santa Ana Pueblo in New Mexico. I
remember going to feasts with her and her family and how there were no
pictures allowed. I'm happy that they are secretive in some ways its
their culture and we should respect that but of course we never have! We
have stole their land and
given them the proverbial short end of the stick in many areas
especially where land management is concerned.

Anyway I have nothing against professional archeologists taking things
from Native American sites. You must have misunderstood me somewhere.
But I do not condone an unprofessional person illegally digging up
burial sites, carving out rock drawings or
getting a shovel and digging for pottery while breaking other items in
the process. I can say that the native Americans look down on this too.

I really believe that we shouldn't separate Native American history from
general American history or the history of other settlers most notably
the Spanish from the history books. Our history books need to be
rewritten because they really show a narrow view of things.

I think that lately there is more of an awareness that Native American
history if a part of us too. We seem to be getting more sensitive
towards the plights of Native American tribes.
Native Americans are also racially getting blended in with other races
so a &quot;full blooded Indian&quot; is becoming a phrase of the past. There has
been a DNA study on this. Fewer people are even speaking the Native
American languages anymore and many tribes are struggling to keep these
old and ancient languages of their ancestors alive. It would be a shame
to lose these languages they were definitely an asset during World War
II.

I'm from an old Spanish/French family who was a part of the first
settlers in California then settled in Colorado during the 1800's. I
don't know if my ancestors have been in the states as long as yours have
but I would say that from the stuff that my grandmother had we have been
here since the late
1700's/ early 1800's at least. My family has a few items from that time
one is an old statue of a saint from a burnt down spanish church and
some items of clothing.

Your right! We are hard pressed to find many antiques over the 200 year
mark but sometimes things come up. I know that in the Southwest items
like helmets, armor, etc. have been found buried under sand in canyons
that once belonged to Spanish soldiers.
And have you heard of the Lost Dutchman's mine in Arizona in
Superstition mountains?

We are all Americans now no matter how long our ancestors have occupied
the country. The world is getting smaller, people are traveling more
often, and views of the world are hopefully getting broader. I have
lived in Europe for about 4 years now and I feel like I'm getting a
broader view of my own country because I am now looking from the outside
in. I love the USA and my fellow Americans and even though I live in
Europe now I still wish the best for my fellow Americans and the USA.

*sniff* I miss my fellow Americans and the charm of the south and
southwest!

Best Regards,

Kathleen

Kat, I spent 15 years in New Mexico, originally to get my grad degree in
archeology (which I never got, btw), so like you, I'm quite familiar
with the pueblos and local folks out there!

I never meant to say that NA history and Anglo-American history should
be separated, just that technically, you can't call their history
&quot;history&quot; in the anthropological sense, since they had no writing. Of
course we both know what &quot;American History&quot; was taught in our schools -
the &quot;big bad Indians&quot; raiding the settlers camps ad nauseum. I think our
history books are long overdue for a major re-write.

Regarding &quot;full blooded Indians&quot;... there's a group of people in North
Jersey called the Jackson Whites (not because they were Anglo, although
they looked it, but because those were the two most common last names).
They were descended from the local tribe, Hessian mercenaries who helped
fight the Revolution, and escaped slaves back in the 1700's. They're a
strange group of people, more like the Appalachians in culture, but they
got themselves legally declared a Native American tribe back in the
1970's. They went to the local county schools, but most of them lived in
a state park in homes that were at least 200 years old... very nice
people, btw. When we were doing a dig up in their area, we asked
permission to survey their homes for our site map, and they happily
obliged, although their kids got a kick out of us measuring their
houses! It was also the first time I'd ever seen wild chickens - did you
know they can fly? &lt;big grin&gt;

Have fun, Michele

"/> Couldn't agree more with you on this, Michele.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;No matter how many times you tell me it's not what you mean, what it
&gt;ultimately boils down to is you saying: It's not worthy of the antique
&gt;moniker unless it's very old, hand-made and within a narrow range of
&gt;what you perceive as quality.

"/> The definitive word here is quality. You can find items that were made over 50
or even 100 years ago that are antique in the strict sense of the word but are
still crap. Some may be collected (and, indeed, have high prices attached
because of their historical importance such as primitive pottery or furniture.)
What Ronnie is saying is that he would prefer to discuss items that were made
with a great deal of skill and high quality of design. These are items that
don't wax and wane with the current trends (such as the currently hot &quot;cottage
furniture&quot;) but endure through the decades and centuries because of their
intrinsic beauty. You don't need to have grown up with these items. Their
magnificence and beauty are apparent the minute you see them. There is a
visual impact in these items, whether it be furniture, porcelain, or silver.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And then I say: people like what they like. Thirty years ago you
&gt;couldn't give away a lot of Arts &amp; Crafts stuff in the US - it was just
&gt;too old-fashioned for the 50's and 60's. And in another 20 years it may
&gt;pass out of favor again. The quality remains, but tastes change

"/> Again, we are talking trends which in large part are a result of magazines such
as Martha Stewart's and other decorating magazines put out for the masses who
have no taste and can't think for themselves. People are easily led into
buying what they think they should have and what is &quot;in style&quot; rather than
buying what they really like. There is a big difference in style and fashion.
When people mention what is in style what they really mean is in fashion which
is what is hot today such as Arts and Crafts. True style has passed the rigors
of time and will never be passe.

I do agree with you that I buy what I know will sell. Doesn't mean I would
ever have it in my house but I'm not currently in a position to have a store
with wonderful silver, furniture, and porcelain. And it is fun to find items
and pass them on to others and if they choose to pay obscene prices and it
makes them happy then what a good thing I've done. And I admire your honesty
in calling yourself a junk dealer.

&gt;Subject: Re: You what????
&gt;From: a2gu ... @aol.com
&gt;Could you please educate me regarding the asset
&gt;the American Indian language was during WWII?

"/> Ashley,

During WWII, the government used Navaho indians in its Signal Corp. because of
the uniqueness of the language and the fact that it was unwritten.

The Navaho were first sent to Europe but were not really utilized in the
capacity for which they trained. It was in the Pacific Theatre where they truly
began serving a functional role.

Because the language is unwritten, there was no way to study it. Only an
individual that was Navaho or someone that was raised with them could
comprehend the intricacies of the language. If you were to write out certain
words and try to translate it would not work because some words would be
spelled the same but take on totally different meaning depending on which
syllable was stressed. The US reffered to the language as Navaho Speak and the
Navaho as Code Talkers. The History Channel has a great documentary on the
subject.

Navajo was used as a code during WWII, and the Japanese never could figure it

The Japanese were unable to decipher the language as it conforms to no
known alphabetical sequence. As I recall, it was basically the language
of one particular Indian tribe, Chippewa maybe?.
It was used in place of a code which could be broken.

My point was that Ronnie could talk about whatever he wants, but not
berate us for talking about some of the things we like and/or sell. And,
that quality can sometimes be subjective, like beauty is. I like being
here and learning about the real antiques Ronnie and a few others
discuss now and then, but I also like learning about not-quite-antiques
(whether it's age or &quot;quality&quot; that makes them &quot;just collectibles&quot;),
because in the marketplace, you can't usually separate antiques from the
collectibles - they go hand in hand in most stores, fairs, shows, etc.

If there was a collectible newsgroup where discussions were the norm,
I'd probably hang out there in addition to here, but that's not the
case... this is really the only place to chat about antiques _and_
collectibles over 50 years old.

As to calling myself a junk dealer, &quot;Michele's Antiques &amp; Collectibles&quot;
was just too wordy! In truth, I haven't really got a name for my
business (it's registered with no DBA), and have been trying for months
to come up with the perfect name. My old business was called &quot;Books &amp;
Bytes&quot; because I consulted on accounting, and sold and installed
computers, but I don't have such a catchy name yet for my junk business!

Have fun, Michele

My Mom would turn over in her grave (well, her urn anyway) if she heard
you call me by a nickname! Funny thing that... she always corrected the
Italian side when they tried to call me Mickey or Shelly.

I'd like to have Junk in the title, definitely not &quot;Junque&quot; - that one
always cracks me up, just like &quot;Ye Olde...&quot;

I went to an online rhyming dictionary just for fun... If I salvaged
items from burned out buildings, I could call my business Junk that
Stunk or Striped Skunk Junk. Or if I sold 50's/60's stuff, there's Funky
Junk, or how about Junk from Trunks, or Blind Drunk's Junk, or Junk that
Flunked, or Blue Funk Junk, or maybe Hunk of Junk, or Spunky Junk, or
Shrunken Junk, or maybe I should have already shrunk outta here! &lt;g&gt;

Have fun, Michele

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And who coined the term
&gt;&quot;cottage furniture?&quot;

"/> Alrighty, I borrow information from 'Collector's Encyclopdia of American
Furniture&quot; by Robert and Harriett Swedberg: The New England Furniture Co,
Grand Rapids, Michigan, and the J.H. Crane Furniture Warerooms in St. Louis,
Missouri, designed, painted, and stencilled furniture suites to coordinate
whith their customer's wall paper, drapery fabrics, or carpet. Mostly Pine,
poplar or other light woods. Flowers, birds, pastoral scenes or various
other designs were painted on the surface. The phrase &quot;Cottage Furniture&quot; is
applied to these bedroom sets from the last half of the 1800's.&quot;
Ronnie again:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Why is it so &quot;hot?&quot;

"/> It is hot because it is pretty and romantic. It sells for mucho dinero but an
entire suite, in my opinion, is a bit much. Better to have one or two pieces
for accent. :-) See ya! Fayette

spool beds, she was rumoured to have liked the style , being a famous

Ronnie,

Go to:

http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist/lind.html

It tells you a bit about Jenny Lind. She seemed quite beautiful in the
steel engraving they had of her no wonder she was so popular in her time
1820-1887.

Spindle and turned Swedish furniture are the most common types
of rural Swedish country styled furniture during much of the
19th century on into the beganning of the 20th. And this kind of
furniture can be purchased at pretty reasonable prices still. I
personally have quite a few chairs and tables that incorporate this
romantic style.

Stenciling furniture, walls, trunks, etc dates back to the vikings
pretty much and the stencils were often made from cut out patterns from
leather or by freehand.

Regards,
Kathleen

"/> '''''''''''''''
It is common lore in New England that Richard Maggsen [Maxson] was a
follower of the religious &quot;heretic&quot; Anne Hutchinson and fled with her &quot;sect&quot;
out of Boston 1636 after charges against her of being blasphemous and
&quot;antinomianism&quot; were filed after her delivery of an ovarian tumor [true
story]. The group went to Acquidneck Island and were the first &quot;Euro&quot;
settlers there [&quot;OK, Indians move over. Say wouldn't you feel a little more
comfortable out west somewhere?&quot;]. Acquidneck Island [nee Massachusetts Bay
Colony] is now part of Rhode Island and is occupied by Newport and
Portsmouth. The Maxson clan [trailer trash to the end] stayed, although
Richard was killed near New York City [Maxson's Point] again following old
Anne and her pals. The mansions never did see a Maxson, save for those
who'd pay the tourist ticket price these days.

Jenny Lind was known as America's Sweetheart. Her success owed much to a
magnetic personality and an ability to identify with her roles. In 1849 she
left the stage and devoted herself to concerts, charity performances and
teaching. Jenny Lind donated large sums to charity. Foundations in the United
States, Britain and Sweden are still making awards in her name. Anything
associated with her in the mid 1800's was copied. Spool beds of the period are
called Jenny Lind beds because she had one. Everyone wanted whatever she
wanted. Big business cashed in on her name. If it was called Jenny Lind it
sold..

&gt;During WWII, the government used Navaho indians in its Signal Corp. because
&gt;of
&gt;the uniqueness of the language and the fact that it was unwritten.

&gt;The Navaho were first sent to Europe but were not really utilized in the
&gt;capacity for which they trained. It was in the Pacific Theatre where they
&gt;truly
&gt;began serving a functional role.

&gt;Because the language is unwritten, there was no way to study it. Only an
&gt;individual that was Navaho or someone that was raised with them could
&gt;comprehend the intricacies of the language. If you were to write out certain
&gt;words and try to translate it would not work because some words would be
&gt;spelled the same but take on totally different meaning depending on which
&gt;syllable was stressed. The US reffered to the language as Navaho Speak and
&gt;the
&gt;Navaho as Code Talkers. The History Channel has a great documentary on the

Curios is an odd word here in the US... they'd think curiosities instead
and wonder what medical quackery I might be selling. Got any shrunken
heads? &lt;g&gt;

Too many (but by no means, all) shops that call themselves &quot;Antique
Shop&quot; have fallen into the Beanie Baby craze... the worst even advertise
the fact (Beanies - 20% Off this Weekend Only!). We have very few &quot;real&quot;
antique shops in this area.

I found a new (to me) auction this weekend though. Amazingly (and rare
for here), they even catalog their lots, and even (heaven forbid!)
auction them off in numerical order! Based on the prices they realized,
I may have my buying and selling backwards. &lt;g&gt; Smalls that go for half
of &quot;book&quot; on eBay, brought in twice &quot;book&quot; value in some cases, and
nearly &quot;book&quot; in most others.

Since I'm either buying or selling online, using the word &quot;antique&quot; in
my business name would be misleading since I won't carry a full line -
no big items like furniture, clocks, and the like, mostly smalls. I have
finally thought of a name, but until I register it here in Florida as a
Fictitious Name, I don't want to post it (in case some lurker decides to
beat me to it). &lt;grin&gt;

Have fun, Michele

"/> Hi Jon, there is very ,very little in the way of pre 1820 stuff
available in shops here, except in the high end shops. Most of the shops
stock great reeking piles of 1920's /30's shite with a few Victorian,
Edwardian pieces just for luck. I don't mind later pieces ( Deco , Arts
&amp; Crafts ) if it's a good quality , but the stuff that's passed of as
Antique in my neck of the woods is appalling.

I have always been proud of the &quot;eclectic&quot; nature of my inventory [and
tastes]. The word &quot;oddment&quot; is seldom used today and would make a somewhat
unusual name for an eclectic business -- as &quot;Antiques and other Oddments.&quot;
Probably sure to attract the bow-tie and brie crowd.

&gt;&gt; Have fun, Michele

&gt; That's not quite what it means in the UK. I used to have a particularly
&gt; nice mahogany chest (of drawers), made around 1850, with three long and
&gt; two short drawers. I wonder how many (aside from Ronnie &amp; Jon), know
&gt; what made it a &quot;cottage&quot; piece. A clue is: it had solid sides, not
&gt; veneered ones, as one would expect of the time.

"/> Good afternoon!

I can provide a wild, out of the blue, haven´t got the foggiest guess, in hope
that someone who DO know will clear things up!

The front was veneered or solid mahogany and the sides were dyed to look like
mahogany, (made of pine, spruce, or whatever).
Wich would have made it a piece for a &quot;cottage&quot; where the owner wanted to have
something that reasembled what the better offs had.

Seriously, over here everything that I associate with the word &quot;cottage&quot; is made
of pine, unfinished, or painted either to imitate (more or less) mahogany,
walnut, or perhaps a single color of red/ brown if it were from the 1850;s
onwards.

What is the real answer?

Regards
Martin W.

"/> Well, seeing as you had a go! :^)

Wrong, but I can see why you say that, and indeed such pieces do exist.

No, this piece broke in half acrossways. By that I mean that the top
half, with two top drawers and the one underneath, the top and sides and
back, lifted off the bottom two drawers, sides, base and back, making
two much smaller pieces. The purpose of this was to enable them to be
carried up the tiny and often twisted stairs of small country cottages,
whereupon they could be reassembled in situ.

I wish I still had mine, as I've never seen another quite so nice.

Cheers, Laurie.
