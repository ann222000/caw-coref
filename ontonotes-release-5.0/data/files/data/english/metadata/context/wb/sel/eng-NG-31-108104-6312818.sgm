I was finally sitting down last night for boobtube time, when the
litterbox came and jumped up beside me to snuggle.

*looks down*

No, not the litterbox, Mithu, smelling of #2, strongly. Not wishing to
spend any time identifying which part of him, in particular, was
affected, I ran to get the (last) kitty wipe. It's like a large
moistened towlette, baby wipe, etc. that is supposedly cat safe and
doesn't require water. I managed to get the back of his head and his
shoulders done before he bolted and led me on a Keystone Cops-like
chase around the house, paws flying and tail lashing. When I finally
caught him, I just managed to get his paws and backside done before he
wiggled loose again. At least he doesn't stink anymore.

I read the box instructions this morning: "Gently wipe the cat all
over until clean." Yeah. Right.

Cheers,
Caroline S.

They must have been used on TuTu when she was rescued.

I have never had a chance to use one on her.  The minute she sees me open
the package, she hides.  MLB

Personally I don't find it hard to give my cats a bath.  Almost every day
they get a good soaking.  Every time I get into the shower they have to come
in an do what ever it takes to get into the shower room.  Once the door
opens they come in with a hurry on till the realize that death from above is
occurring.  They even have got Ka' Shay in on the deal.  They get soaked and
go dashing out the bathroom like the door bell rang only to sit outside and
clean them selves and give me the evil eye when I come out laughing at the
ordeal.  I have to block the door just to take a shower specially in cold
weather if you can call it that here in Florida

I heard Martha Stewart say once that she washes her cats little faces
with a washcloth every night. (what are they, Birman? Can't
remember)...anyway, if I did that, I'd have cats hiding from me every
night. They just *don't* like to be messed with that way. Of course,
if they reeked of eau de #2, you don't have much choice!!

ROFL!

Boy, can I relate!  Wolfie is very fuzzy, and has "pants" in back, and
is all white.  Have had to bathe him a few times, and you would think
you are killing the poor cat with his screeching and wailing like a banshee!

And it's time to do it again.  Yeah.  Right.  &lt;big grin&gt;

I used to clean Vino's chin with a wet washcloth every night in
Thailand.  He didn't like it but he's such a good boy, he didn't
struggle too much either.  Better to wash the chin than to get nasty
chin acne.
Since moving to Australia, he hasn't had any acne.  Probably due to the
drier, cooler climate.
