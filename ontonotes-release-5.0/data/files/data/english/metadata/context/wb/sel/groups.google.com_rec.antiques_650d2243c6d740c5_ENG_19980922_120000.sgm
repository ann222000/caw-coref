I was in New Orleans drinking,gambling,doing the 'secondÂ line' (a
local dance) and enjoying other forms of decadence for 18 days. I won at
craps,poker (hold-em,7-stud &amp; draw),the video poker (in the
bars),pool,craps AND the slots...
I was eating lobster,oysters Bienville,oysters Rockefeller (sp),raw
oysters,po-boys and other N.O. fare and spent three nights and four days
in a fully 'comped' (free) hotel suite suite with ALL meals (28 in
all-14 tickets good for two) and had NO (none,zilch,zero,nada) plans of
returning to Tampa until I was busted &amp; disgusted (maybe in 2002).....
After three hours sleep in a 48 hour period I returned to the bed to
find the following note:
Your wife has fallen and broken her ankle.She was ambulanced to the ER
and told by the Drs. that it was the WORST break they had EVER seen in
the ankle (naturally) requiring surgery and about 12 weeks of
convalescence.........
AAAaaarrrrrrgggggggghhhhhhhhh !
I spent the next 12 hours very sleepily driving home (and having a rock
break the windshield on my NEW TRUCK) to be with my little kumquat and
wait on her hand and foot.....
(Just where DID I put that recipe for the poison cookies?)
I'm back,I'm tired,I'm sleepy,I'm pissed and I'm glad I took a break
(but, don't truck with me for the next day or two)......... &lt;g&gt;
I haven't had an chance to catch up on the posts and I returned to a
FULL mailbox................ oy-vey !
C'ya later,

Seriously - it's glad to have you back!

"/> Hey Connie! Since your post about the reproduction show I've been working on
my hubby to let me go for the weekend. Not sure if I've made any
progress.....about 12 days ago the dear boy tripped over my shoes in the front
doorway and has been hobbling around ever since. I apologized but he said it
wasn't sincere. I admitted I am a sinner but that wasn't good enough either.
:-D Anyway, it is still purple and I am trying to convince him to go have
it X-rayed.
Poor wife of Doug. I hope she is not in too much pain.
Oh yeah...back on topic....did you do any antiqueing Doug? ;-) Fayette
