Democrats' disgrace
Tony Blankley
August 15, 2007

Sometimes we can better understand where we are politically from afar
than from within. Consider this assessment from Europe's biggest and
Germany's most influential magazine, Der Spiegel, this week:

&quot;The wind has shifted in Washington. America, not just its president,
is at war. The Democrats are still critical of the failed Iraq
campaign, but they are no longer opposed to the 'War on Terror' in
general. It has been accepted, and not just as a metaphor... Ninety
two percent of Americans are opposed to an immediate withdrawal from
Iraq, and a majority doesn't want to see the US's special detention
camp at Guantanamo Bay closed. At the moment, the American
electorate's biggest criticism of Bush is that he has not been
aggressive enough in pursuing terrorist leader Osama bin Laden.

&quot;Indeed, when voters hit the ballot box in November 2008, they will be
looking for more than just a candidate charismatic and clever enough
to lead the country politically. They will also ask themselves which
of the candidates is sufficiently tough, crafty and brutal to win the
multi-front war that the Bush administration has begun.

&quot;Many Americans now despise Bush [because of Iraq]. Nevertheless,
Americans are still loathe to admit defeat. This is precisely what
distinguishes Europeans from Americans... The Americans favor the
power of force, even in its crudest form, which explains why the U.S.
military might is so superior to that of all other nations.&quot; (By Gabor
Steingart. Translated from the German by Christopher Sultan.)

We see evidence that the Democrats are beginning to appreciate the
truth of the above description. The New York Times has suddenly
started counseling caution about any sudden departure from Iraq. Sen.
Barack Obama's steroid-enhanced rhetoric now has him calling - Rambo-
like - for possible pre-emptive war against Pakistan. Sen. Hillary
Clinton announces that she might use nuclear weapons against
terrorists (I hope she doesn't find the terrorists in New York, where
one of my sons lives, or London, my hometown). The Democratic
congressional leaders quickly passed President Bush's requested FISA
electronic intercepts authority.

The Democrats, after spending the winter, spring and early summer
frantically calling for getting out of Iraq as fast as their little
feet can carry them, are now, as autumn approaches, demonstrating
their Olympic-class back-pedaling skills.

By winter (with the complicity of the drive-by media hat tip to Rush
Limbaugh) the Democrats hope to expunge the historic record of their
failure of war nerve this spring. This is the moment for Republicans
from the president, to the candidates for president, to the incumbents
and challengers for offices all the way down to dog catcher (and
especially dog catcher) to remind the public of the springtime
Democratic Party defeatism and lost nerve.

They should be inspired to follow the immortal advice of Gen. Patton
to his troops regarding what they should do to the Nazi enemy: &quot;We are
going to hold them by the nose and kick them in the ass... we are
going to go through them like crap through a goose.&quot; Of course, the
Democrats are only the domestic opposition, not the enemy. In American
politics we have no American enemies - only philosophical opponents -
I mean that.

The leadership of the Democratic Party has, by its public words this
spring, disgraced themselves for a generation. Republicans have the
right - and the duty - to engrave in the public mind the springtime
Democratic perfidy and cowardice in the face of the enemy.

This spring and early summer: Sen. Harry Reid said the war is lost;
Gov. Bill Richardson said that on his first day in the Oval Office he
would order our troops to leave Iraq immediately (even if it meant
throwing down their weapons on the way out); Hillary bragged that if
Mr. Bush doesn't end the war, she would do so immediately upon her
arriving in the Oval Office (God preserve us); and Mr. Obama took
pride of place in his adamant opposition to, and call for immediate
departure from, the Iraq war.

Gen. Patton also observed that &quot;Americans love a winner and will not
tolerate a loser.&quot; That is as true today as it was six decades ago.
(This is the great misreading of the American public by the current
Democratic Party. We Americans are only sentimental about dogs - we
have three in our family - not about human losers. We love kick-ass
football players - unless they hurt a dog, and then we righteously
send them to hell, where they belong).

The public must not be permitted to forget these cowardly public
statements by the Democrats. It is the job of the Republicans this
fall and winter to remorselessly and repeatedly remind the public of
what the Democrats were saying this spring. In that disgrace lies the
potential for a well-deserved Democratic Party defeat in November 2008.
