Memo To The Media: How To Cover The Debt Crisis

By Danny Schechter
Created Apr 5 2007 - 8:45am

Well over a year ago, I wrote an article for Harvard's journalism journal
Nieman Reports complaining about deeply flawed media coverage of credit and
debt issues in America.

"There is a credit divide in America that fuels our economic divide," I
wrote, warning of a potential economic implosion because so many Americans
are squeezed by a debt squeeze. I was not alone in projecting a crisis,
although my focus was more on the failure of many media outlets to track the
problem and ask deeper questions.

"Ours has become a nation in which the carrot of instant affluence is
quickly menaced by the harsh stick of bill collectors, lawsuits, and
foreclosures," I argued. "And yet, this bubble can burst: The slickest of
our bankers and the savviest of our marketers have been able to undo the law
of gravity, that what goes up must come down."

One didn't have to be an expert to see the warning signs which have since
led to a massive market meltdown, a collapse of the sub-prime mortgage
market, bankruptcies by leading financial lenders, billions of dollars in
losses by top banks and financial lenders, and predictions of more pain to
come with nearly two million Americas facing a foreclosures.

When I started making a film on the subject, In Debt We Trust [1],
colleagues warned me that the issue might be too obscure to rate media
coverage. "No one likes to talk about money," said a producer friend. "This
could be such a downer."

Now what are they saying?

It doesn't feel good to be right when so many people are being wronged. At
the time I called on media outlets to take some steps to beef up their
reporting. Most didn't, but it's never too late.

Here's what I proposed then, and repeat now:

* Report more regularly on these credit issues; billions of dollars are
involved, not to mention millions of lives.

* Identify the key corporate institutions and contrast the compensation of
their executives with the financial circumstances of their customers. Look
into the process of "financialization" that is transferring more wealth from
the bottom to the top of society.

* Shine a spotlight on how special interests and lobbyists for financial
institutions contribute to members of Congress and other politicians, across
party lines, to ensure their desired policies and lack of regulations.

* Expose political influence driven by campaign contributions. Some
reporting about this took place during the bankruptcy debate, but there has
been little follow-up.

* Examine the influence credit card companies have on media coverage through
their extensive and expensive advertising.

* Take a hard look at the predatory practices in poor neighborhoods - and
crimes committed against poor people, who are least able to defend
themselves. Legal service lawyers tell me that they are overwhelmed by the
scale of mortgage scams involving homes whose value have been artificially
inflated.

* Focus attention on what consumers can do to fight back. Robert Manning,
author of "Credit Card Nation," explains: "If ten percent of American credit
cardholders withheld their monthly payments, it would bring the financial
services industry to a standstill. At a larger issue, what we have to do is
to get people involved at the state level, get their state attorney generals
involved, aggressively filing class action lawsuits and then putting
pressure on key legislators to say, 'This is unacceptable that they're not
representing and balancing the issues of commerce with consumers. The
balance is tilted dramatically against the average American.'"

* Report on initiatives like Americans For Debt Relief Now [2] that are
setting up community, church and grass roots house party screenings of the
IN DEBT WE TRUST.

We need to educate the public about the deeper forces at work and the need
for structural changes, urgent reforms and regulations and new consumer
protections. We need to stop restating problems and start exploring
solutions.

The globalization of our economy is about more than outsourcing of jobs.
There is a deeper shift underway from a society based around production,
with the factory as the symbol of American economic prowess, to a culture
driven by consumption, with the mall as its new dominant icon.

Class struggle today is assuming a new form in the conflict between
creditors and lenders that reaches into many Americans' homes, where each
month bills are juggled and rejuggled with today's credit card bills paid by
tomorrow's new card. Meanwhile, with interest compounding at usurious rates,
indebtness grows and people sink even deeper into debts they cannot manage.
No wonder we are becoming a nation of scammers with consumers using every
trick they can think of against banks that hide their predatory practices in
legalese.

In this conflict, financial institutions function as well-organized machines
while individual borrowers are forced to react as individuals. Many are
browbeaten with lectures about "personal responsibility" by corporations
that only pay lip service to any form of social responsibility while paying
their own executives obscenely high salaries.

Centuries ago, we had debtors prisons. Today, many of our homes are similar
kinds of prisons, where debtors struggle for survival with personal finance
pressures.

Who is really responsible for this? Few of us seem to know.

And fewer appear to know what can be done about it. "They're never going to
be repaid," says economic historian Michael Hudson who for many years worked
at Chase Bank. "Adam Smith said that no government had ever repaid its debts
and the same can be said of the private sector. The U.S. government does not
intend to repay its trillion dollar debt to foreign central banks and, even
if it did intend to, there's no way in which it could. Most of the
corporations now are avoiding paying their pension fund debts and their
health care debts."

Yes, these can be complicated issues that lead to tune-out, what TV
producers call the 'Mego Effect" -- "my eyes glaze over." Yet because so
many people are involved, it is urgent that our media push these issues from
the business pages to the front pages and humanize them so we can try to
wrestle our lives back from the ravages of a relentless debt machine.

We need to educate the public about what it means to agree to a debt.
That's what we need to do.

We need to explain to them they don't need a fricking new suv every
other year.  They don't need a 3000 sq foot brand new house and their
family knows they're overextended and not really rich as they'd hoped.
They need to understand that you do not finance a TV that covers an
entire wall.   That's for rich for people who don't need to finance
luxury items.

Blaming the companies solely and saying we should attack them and
withhold our payments is criminal and what turns this piece into
anti-capitalist propaganda.

The industry should be regulated against praying on truly stupid
people but if some dork is more interested in financing status symbols
and luxury items then you can't blame the financial institutions.  If
you're eductated beyond, say eigth grade, then you have knowledge and
tools to understand what you're getting into.

I agree with all the steps the media should do but educating the
public and counseling personal responsibility should have been first
on the list, not the afterthought.  And not for the purpose of placing
all  blame  on the execs and the credit companies as a call to arms to
join up with communists and decalare war on your mortgage company.
That simply leads to worse places.
