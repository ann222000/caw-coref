John Edwards, during his campaign, spoke eloquently about the "two Americas." Today's Washington Post carries an article about the economic "recovery" as reflected in New York City: "Michael Bloomberg, this city's billionaire mayor, looks at Manhattan's glittering economy and all but chortles. 'Jobs are coming back to the Big Apple,' he said recently. 'Our future has never looked brighter.'

"The Wall Street bull is snorting. Investment bankers arm-wrestle for a $18 million Park Avenue apartment. Slots at prestigious private kindergartens retail for $26,000. Lines trail out of the latest, hot restaurants, and black limos play bumper car in Tribeca.

"'New York,' a recent newspaper article proclaims, 'it's HOT.'

"Except that a closer look at this largest of U.S. cities reveals much that's not so hot. New York's unemployment rate jumped in January from 8.0 to 8.4 percent, the worst performance among the nation's top 20 cities. It has lost 230,000 jobs in the past three years. Demand for emergency food has risen 46 percent over the past three years, and 900,000 New Yorkers receive food stamps. Inflation, foreclosures, evictions and personal bankruptcies are rising sharply. Fifty percent of the city's black males no longer are employed.

"President Bush will journey here this August for the Republican convention, and he is expected to celebrate the revival of the nation's financial capital since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But at this point, that recovery is characterized more by its weakness -- and by the stark disparities between rich and poor." There is a lot more detail in the article about the reality of economic life in New York (and, clearly, everywhere else in the country too, although this article is specifically about New York City). One particularly poignant story: "Juan Batista has arrived at his 62nd year without a job or health insurance. For decades, the East Harlem man threaded fabric through textile machines -- until he was laid off in 2002. Now he leafs through the classified ads each morning and walks the streets. He sees rug stores but no longer the factories that make them.

"His wife's salary is his sole support. 'I don't want to retire, but I don't have the possibilities of youth,' Batista said last week. 'I'm worried. What can I do but wait for death?'" Life in the "greatest country in the world."
