Have you read *all* of his speech, have you? Apparently not. He
exlplicitly stated, that Finland does *not* view Russia as a threat to
it's security, AND he repeated the usual mantra of Finnish foreign
policy which includes the non-pact/neutrality principles and so on.

This is my own interpretation: I suspect he used these words (&quot;security
challenge&quot;) since he might be worried of, and to some extent even
annoyed by the growing arrogance of Russia for various reasons that
include most of the all other aspects except the military:

a) Russian planes repeatedly violating Finnish airspace a while ago
(nobody thinks they'll bomb Helsinki, but it is still not OK to fly in
other countries territory)
b) Russian companies aggressive and unlawful treatment of Finnish
companies in Russia (keyword: Kronstadt)
c) The completely overblown reaction on the statue-issue with Estonia,
where among others Russia allowed crowds to threat Estonian and Swedish
diplomats physically. Finnish politicians kept the &quot;lid on it&quot;, but
stuff like this makes our politicians and us ordinary Finns worried.
d) The poor state of civil rights and free speech in Russia, which might
have unpredictable consecuences in form of border dispeutes with some of
it's neigbours, civil unrest, ethnic unrest and political power
struggles among others.

All this, the sheer size of the country plus more makes Russia a complex
neigbour to deal with. In comparision the relationship with Sweden,
Norway and Estonia on the other hand is very easy. It's like sitting on
the backyard sipping wine and having a relaxed barbeque with your
friends living next door...

Finlands relationship with Russia is still probably &quot;as good as it ever
can get&quot;. The big problem is that they can't ever be equals and that
makes the relationship a &quot;challenge&quot; at least for Finland. Russia can
and it will use it often for it's own favour by carrying out it's own
agendas (which right now are trade and economic related).

From all that I failed to understand - are you trying to excuse him as
a private person or as a defense minister? In either case nothig good
comes out: a private person should express his frustration through
political activity, a defense minister on the other hand should leave
resolution of issues which are not in his competence (trade, etc.) to
the representatives of the executive branch specifically charged to
manage such problems.

Yes they have been in government. Their previous period in government
was a coalition government with the social democrats. Late 1990's IIRC.
This is the first time they are in posession of the ministry of foreign
affairs and the party has openly expressed interest in strenghtening the
relations to the United States.The foreign minister Ilkka Kanerva, the
fellow party mate of the defense minister Häkämies, said of that
particular comment in that speech that it &quot;sure raised some eyebrows&quot;,
meaning he found Häkämies' wording to be odd too.

Häkämies and the government faced som tough criticism today in
parliament because of this affair, and not all of it was from the
opposition parties... speaking of political opposition: the concept is
quite alien for Russian society of today, I belive.

Hm, I disagree with that categorically: the government figures are
supposed to be engaged in politics before and after being in government.
Politization of a Government is unfortunately practically inevitable but
must be fought at all cost. Otehrwise it will have no time left for its
primary job.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Finlands relationship with Russia is still probably &quot;as good as it ever
&gt; &gt;&gt; can get&quot;. The big problem is that they can't ever be equals and that
&gt; &gt;&gt; makes the relationship a &quot;challenge&quot; at least for Finland. Russia can
&gt; &gt;&gt; and it will use it often for it's own favour by carrying out it's own
&gt; &gt;&gt; agendas (which right now are trade and economic related).

&gt; &gt;       I have a grave suspicion (and maybe I have already revealed it) that
&gt; &gt; the whole thing is more internal Finnish political fight than anything
&gt; &gt; to do with real or imaginary problems between Finland and Russia. This
&gt; &gt; guy belogs to a particular party - did that party ever led the Finnish
&gt; &gt; government?

&gt; Yes they have been in government. Their previous period in government
&gt; was a coalition government with the social democrats. Late 1990's IIRC.
&gt; This is the first time they are in posession of the ministry of foreign

They were my personal conclusions. I can't possibly know what's in the

along with your neuighbours - especially the bigger ones. Both the
president and the foreign minister have been very correct and cautious
when dealing with Russia and the other bigger players (China, USA).

Russofobia is of course to some extent a reality among the ordinary man.

That particular party and its ministers are doing what Finnish political
establishment were doing in the 60's and 70's, with the exception that
this time the direction is west and not the east as it was back then.

Among countries in europe Finns used to have the lowest approval rate
for the USA's foreign policy, so many here aren't that delighted of the

Which opposition is that? The neo-Nazis or the followers of Stalin?
That is at least a fact that people like Kasparov are totally denied
media visibility and being present at important events. The Russian
authorities stopped opposition leader Garri Kasparov from attending the
EU-Russia summit held in Samara. A free country does not give such a
treatment for it's political opposition.

If that would be true than you have very difficult time explaining why
foreign investments are pouring in Russia. With all the diplomatic fuss
British investment alone stands between $20 to $40 bln. since beginning
of the year.

&quot;&quot;we won't have it any other way except

I am not sure if neocon approach is adolescent but quite bloody - yes.
However it is not limited to the US only - quite a few EU countries went
happily along. And right now another &quot;tony blair&quot; surfaced as a French
foreign minister - already threatening Iran with a war. As the guy is a
socialist one can see that neoconism is not only right wing or political
in general trait, rather it is psychological, away from politics such
idividuals are described as psychopaths.

Oops, sorry - neo Nazis do not exist as organized political group. As to
followers of Stalin, the so called Anpilov group - this one is under the
skirt of Kasparov, part of his desperate effort to produce numbers of
his &quot;opposition&quot; brought in &quot;666&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If anything - denying Kasparov such visibility is his only chance to get
it: even traditional hard core liberal groups/parties as &quot;Yabloko&quot; and
&quot;Union of Right Forces&quot; refuse to talk to him. He is dirty because he is
a buddie of Berezovsky. That's why he picks up all the filth he can find
in the streets like Anpilov.

Why exactly he is entitled to attend EU-Russia summit? Who is he? An ex
chess champion with a few coins in his own pocket and few criminal rich
associates sitting abroad.

As I mentioned you pay attention to those in Russian opposition who
speaks (and for the only reason to attract your attention) your
language. If the opposition speaks Russian to Russians then you ignore
it - it's a gibberish to you anyway. And where one can get all the
time?- to spend figuring out intricacies of Russian politics if there is
a Western &quot;Lego&quot; kit what &quot;opposition&quot; has to be. But this kit turned
useless in Russia.
