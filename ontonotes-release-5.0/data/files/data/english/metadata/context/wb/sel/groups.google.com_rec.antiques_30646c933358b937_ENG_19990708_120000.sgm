I was at my Grandmother's house today helping her clean up her basement. We
came across some old cologne bottles. I have no clue how much they are
worth if anything. Here are the ones I found (I think the were all Avon. I
got the names from a sticker on them)
Thomas Jefferson Handgun
Revolutionary Cannon
Highway King (Talcum powder thing)
Stagecoach
Covered Wagon
Spicy After Shave (Indian head shaped bottle)
Weather Vane Decanter
Christmas Surprise (Stocking)
Christmas Cologne (Ornament)
Unforgettable Cologne (Christmas Tree)
Elusive (Swan shape)
Sweet Honesty (Lamb bottle)

I do not know much about antiques, but these looked pretty old. Please
e-mail me if you know how much they are worth, where I could find out about
them, or just any information I should know.

Thanks!

So, you want free appraisals on twelve
different items and not only that but you
want it mailed to you too so you will
have to do the absolute minimum of work
to get it? Sheesh.

But maybe GK will look it up in one of his
price guides for you. Heck, he might
even mail it to you. ;)

By the way, do you treat your local
people this way? Try it sometime.
You just might learn something
that you REALLY need to know.

"/> Hey, a dollar? .. a go!! that's not bad! So, a truck load is only a
100 bucks? how many bottles would we get to a truck load then? A
couple of 100 at least, NAW!! got to be SEVERAL 100s .. 1000s!! even.
Geez! beats the auld solicitoring game, eh! especially, the no win,
no fee cases ;&gt;

.... er ...btw .. is that a truck, as in, a an open railway wagon, or
a vehicle for carrying heavy goods, like a lorry?or an articulated! or
maybe, you mean something like a Ford panel van, with a Luton body or
a Hi-Ace? Mm mm, the smaller car sized stuff? nay too small. Ah! is
it, one of these open back thingies with the high suspension, big
wheels, cow-horn radiator cap, and a, Purdey, on the back-panel behind
the driver's head? ... It's a bit like that window hook enigma.

Ah! hell, at a 100 bucks per truck load, just send a 40 foot container
load ... is there extra trade discount for a job lots?

All you seem to do is chastise people for what you class as in appropriate
posts but I watch this newsgroup everyday and I have never seen you post one
bit of information or answer a post unless to criticise it, there is nothing
in the charter for rec.antiques that says that anyone has to answer the
post to the group ( It is good when people do but it is not mandatory )
maybe you should back off a bit and have a read of the charter for a while!

you may have just chased off someone who may have had a genuine interest and
that is bad for all of us.

Well, you have really screwed up.
rec.antiques is one newsgroup &amp; rec.antiques.bottles

And just so you'd know, Tracy was 100% correct

replies in rec.antiques.
Find the post called

and have a look at the FAQ.

OK, Riley, have you got it?
The charter for rec.antiques.bottles
has nothing whatsoever to do with rec.antiques.

And by the way, you have really stepped
in it. We LIKE Tracy over here in rec.

posts so far (1), are not the
swiftest little bear in the woods,

Don't you know what a cross post is mate, every time Tracy shows up on
rec.antique.bottles she is chewing someone out for something trivial so if
she wants to reply to rec.antiques ONLY and use rec.antiques FAQ's to
chastise people please remove all the other newsgroups from the reply.

the fact is she still chased away someone with a genuine question no matter

===
Yes, Riley, you are.
100% wrong. And please,
spend a few minutes learning
what the hell you are doing.
Learn what crossposting is.
Use a search engine and
search for &quot;nettiquette&quot;.
You will find out what
cross posting is that way.

You seem bound and determined
to pick a fight that you cannot
win, at least upon the merits
of your arguements.

We were not talking about
what goes on in rec.antiques.bottles.
We were talking about your idiotic
post of the rec.antiques.bottles
charter and your claim that that
has some sort of authority here
in rec.antiques. And we talked
about the rec.antiques FAQ.

Do you get me? We were not talking
about what has or has not gone on
in rec.antiques.bottles. We were
talking about rec.antiques.
And in that context, you are
100% wrong.

It is your responsibility to learn
to use Usenet correctly. It is not
hard to learn, either. All you have
to do is do it. I should not have
to waste my time explaining this to you.
But I will do it this once, after that
I am just going to suggest several
solo sexual acts you might perform
for the amusement of the crowd.

If a message is crossposted, it appears
in both newsgroups. If Tracy's comment
was appropriate for for rec.antiques
and not appropriate for rec.antiques.bottles,
that is just the breaks.
Get over it. You are making
mountains out of mole hills.

Why do I have to spend so much of my
time explaining things to you? Grow up.

Dear Riley (et al in rec.antiques.bottles),

I can certainly see why you get that impression. If you are only reading
r.a.bottles, you would only see my chastising posts - and those which
have been cross-posted to numerous newsgroups because the original
poster cross-posted. I don't read r.a.bottles - only r.antiques. I knew
it was a cross-post, and since I did not recognize the poster as an
r.a.'er, I cross-posted so the poster could FIND the reply.

And what is your problem, anyway, Riley? In the post which apparently
tripped your trigger, I was merely responding to a poster who asked what
was the breach of netiquette in the original post, which I had ignored.
I replied with a simple statement about correct netiquette which would
apply to any newsgroup. Sheesh. FAQ? I didn't say a word about the FAQ.
Perhaps you have me confused with someone else. Whether you like it or
not, it is considered rude in all newsgroups to post a question and ask
for a personal e-mail back. If one wants to ask a question of the group,
the least they can do is come back to the group to read replies - and
the replies will benefit all the group, not just the individual, okay?

I suggest that you put my name in your killfile and spare yourself the agony.

And thanks, T., for the kind words.

RAGards,

Tracy

My only problem is that every time your name pops up on rec.antique.bottles
you have been giving someone a hard time about the 'rules'. I know these are
cross posted but you should take this into consideration in the future when
you make a reply.
It was not just this post it was all of them over months, you seem to have a
post about 2 - 3 times a week in r.a.b and these last 3 posts are the first
time I replied.
Anyway if you can't take it don't dish it out!
also the bit about the FAQ's was aimed at 'T' for his comments.

bye bye all I will go back to my own little newsgroup now and won't bother
you again,
I seem to have got that of my chest.
I got you all riled up though didn't I?

&gt;&gt;&gt;rec.antiques is one newsgroup &amp; rec.antiques.bottles
&gt;&gt;&gt;is a completely different newsgroup.
&gt;&gt;&gt;And just so you'd know, Tracy was 100% correct
&gt;&gt;&gt;(which means you were 100% wrong) about emailed
&gt;&gt;&gt;replies in rec.antiques.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Find the post called
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;New to rec.antiques? Please read this.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;and have a look at the FAQ.

&gt;&gt;&gt;OK, Riley, have you got it?
&gt;&gt;&gt;The charter for rec.antiques.bottles
&gt;&gt;&gt;has nothing whatsoever to do with rec.antiques.

&gt;&gt;&gt;And by the way, you have really stepped
&gt;&gt;&gt;in it. We LIKE Tracy over here in rec.
&gt;&gt;&gt;antiques and you, Riley, as far as we
&gt;&gt;&gt;can tell from your scintilating
&gt;&gt;&gt;posts so far (1), are not the
&gt;&gt;&gt;swiftest little bear in the woods,
&gt;&gt;&gt;now are you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;T.

You people are so f*****g nuts here! WHY do you have so many rules to post
here? Why do you get so mad at each other? Why can't people ask ANY
question they want to, without being slammed?

Think about these questions and look on this group from the prospectus of
someone trying to enter this area.

ANYTHING to r.a.bottles.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It was not just this post it was all of them over months, you seem to have a

in the author field. Now, YOU tell ME how many times I have posted
there. Oooh... TWO. Now, just in case you don't believe those results,
go back to the search page and leave the Forum field BLANK, then search.

little newsgroup?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; bye bye all I will go back to my own little newsgroup now and won't bother

"/> Riley, you WISH you could rile me. This latest bit of insane blather

&gt;&gt;Dear Riley (et al in rec.antiques.bottles),

&gt;&gt;I can certainly see why you get that impression. If you are only reading
&gt;&gt;r.a.bottles, you would only see my chastising posts - and those which
&gt;&gt;have been cross-posted to numerous newsgroups because the original
&gt;&gt;poster cross-posted. I don't read r.a.bottles - only r.antiques. I knew
&gt;&gt;it was a cross-post, and since I did not recognize the poster as an
&gt;&gt;r.a.'er, I cross-posted so the poster could FIND the reply.

&gt;&gt;And what is your problem, anyway, Riley? In the post which apparently
&gt;&gt;tripped your trigger, I was merely responding to a poster who asked what
&gt;&gt;was the breach of netiquette in the original post, which I had ignored.
&gt;&gt;I replied with a simple statement about correct netiquette which would
&gt;&gt;apply to any newsgroup. Sheesh. FAQ? I didn't say a word about the FAQ.
&gt;&gt;Perhaps you have me confused with someone else. Whether you like it or
&gt;&gt;not, it is considered rude in all newsgroups to post a question and ask
&gt;&gt;for a personal e-mail back. If one wants to ask a question of the group,
&gt;&gt;the least they can do is come back to the group to read replies - and
&gt;&gt;the replies will benefit all the group, not just the individual, okay?

&gt;&gt;I suggest that you put my name in your killfile and spare yourself the
&gt; agony.

&gt;&gt;And thanks, T., for the kind words.

&gt;&gt;RAGards,

&gt;&gt;Tracy

&gt; Sean and Tracy and Riley and T and the BottleFolks:

&gt; Problem here, I think, was that the original message was crossposted
&gt; to rec.antiques and the bottles group. Diff'rent strokes.

"/> This thread is really approaching rediculousness but I still feel
compelled to continue it. I just want to make a few points because I
feel this phillimagobi person (the original poster) was using usenet in
an appropriate way and the shitstorm that has developed around that post
is out of place.

1. For a person to ask for personal replies should not be a &quot;breach of
netiquette&quot;, some people are not into monitoring groups and simply want
to take advantage of the resourse, their taxes paid for this also, don't
forget that. If someone on the list is interested in hearing the answers
then they can quite simply follow up with a post that says, hey please
cc the list with any responses (which is going to happen anyway, believe
me)

2. Avon bottles should not be &quot;excluded from rec.antique.bottles&quot; as it
says in the charter. As I understand it, anything over 35 years old is
an antique and there are antique avon bottles (they're listed in
Kovel's). Just because they're kitchey (sp?) and stupid doesn't mean
they should be discriminated against.

3. Cross-posting is not a good practice, granted, bit this wasn't such a
breach either. The person only posted to two groups and both were
appropriate venues for the question being asked (namely &quot;I found some
stuff in Grandma's basement, can you kind people help me learn what I
found?&quot;). For a post of this nature to be greeted with a bunch of
self-righteous crap about &quot;netiquette&quot; doesn't seem right to me.

4. Usenet and the WWW are the most important advances in human
information technology that have ever happened, by about 5 orders of
magnitude. Gutenberg's press was a bump in the road compared to the
impact thw WWW is in the process of having. Abuse is inevitable, but
seeing abuse in every post that doesn't interest you is wrong. Save the
righteous indignation for the idiots who cross-post to 100 groups with
their stupid spam. When someone posts an innocent question to an
appropriate venue, either answer it if you like, or lurk like the rest
of us whose upbringing included the old cliche &quot;If you don't have
something good to say...&quot; Things work much more smoothly that way.

Ahhh, what a nice Sunday morning vent that was, I think I'll go hunt up
some old bottles now. See ya.

DARPA (Dept. Of Advanced Research Project Agency) was funded by the US
Gov't since the 1960's, and ARPANet was the origins of the Internet, so
its beginnings were, in fact, funded by taxes paid by US citizens.

Some folks are under the misunderstanding that it's still paid for by
our tax dollars, but that time is long past, and now, no one owns or
controls the 'net. See here for a brief history:

I must respectfully point out that while Michele is correct as far as
she goes, she misses the main point, which is Usenet!= Internet. Never has
been, never will be.

(Plus, there were European networks whose origins owed nothing to ARPAnet.
An &quot;internet&quot; is simply a collection of networks.)

Charleen, I must disagree. Usenet _ran_ on the Arpanet as early as 1979,
and while not a funded project, it was still using gov't funds since it
ran on the government's network.

And while you're right that an &quot;internet&quot; is simply a collection of
networks, _the_ Internet (capital I), started out as a network between
ARPA and the European networks, with ARPA designing the original
protocols (as in TCP/IP) in 1982. ARPANET didn't drop out until 1990,
and the WWW protocols didn't start until 1991, which is when the
Internet, as most people know it, really took off, although it didn't
pass telnet and ftp in number of bytes transferred for a few more years.

Have fun, Michele

Ooohhh. Are we gonna start this again? Now that cars have been
around for a century and more, they are not antiques at age 25. The
exact cutoff is a constant source of dispute in the automotive groups,
but I don't really think anyone believes my 1973 Lincoln is an
antique. Interesting, yes. And collectible, yes. But antique? Naw,
not to anybody but my wife (who would love to see nothing but shiny
new metal in the driveway).

To be sure, it is very nice that we have these high-speed networks now to

but not necessary. It did not then and does not now depend on a certain
physical network.

At last! An outlet for those &quot;old&quot; VSOP bottles. After you kill the
pigeon you
can advertise it at rec.antique.bottles or E-bay.

&gt; , &gt; 2. Avon bottles should not be &quot;excluded from rec.antique.bottles&quot; as
it
&gt; says in the charter. As I understand it, anything over 35 years old is
&gt; an antique and there are antique avon bottles (they're listed in
&gt; Kovel's). Just because they're kitchey (sp?) and stupid doesn't mean
&gt; they should be discriminated against.

(if I find an Avon bottle in the water, I will leave it for the next
generation of bottle divers, much as I do with many, many bottles from
the 30s and 40s) The problem with discriminating on the newsgroup level
though is that it leaves no place to ask a question like that person
asked. I doubt rec.antiques.kitchyandstupid will go very far. (although
frighteningly I could be wrong) If there were enough of it happening
that it was a problem (ie; ten posts a day about Beam decanters) that's
one thing, but if somebody finds a bunch of Grandma's old Avon stuff and
asks about it I don't think that should be a problem.

If I'm wrong fine, I'll shut up. I just don't think that person had
committed as egregious an error as has been made out (one person even
went so far as to refer to the original poster as a miscreant, though I
suspect this was due more to lack of understanding than to malice)

I for one will go along with you: as long as the Avon and
Beam posts don't get excessive they should be dealt with with tolerance. I
loath Beam stuff in particular but I've always just referred requests here
for info to a Beam collectors site I found.
Horrifying thout of the day: Ebay has over 1200 Avon items listed this very
moment. Arguhh....

You have never seen Tracy post one bit of information?! What are you, a mole
person? I asked a couple of questions regarding music, specifically rag time
(or is it ragtime, Tracy?) and she gave us an entire dissertation on the genre,
even including music. I suggest you not make statements unless you can back
them up with facts. You are way off base in this case and owe Tracy an
apology.
