I've been looking at the ISAR website and I'm surprised to see that
several astrologers and speakers are scheduled to discuss sun sign
astrology for the masses in different forms.

Is this a new trend in professional astrology? In finding ways to
discuss sun signs in a thoughtful, respectful way, when "real"
astrology tends to look at charts and progressions and transits that
require more than just the sun sign?

Best,

Gib

RM: I wasn't aware of any trend towards focussing on Sun signs, but
astrology lecturers are always dreaming up new specialties.
Theoretically they could do the same thing with Mercury signs or Venus
signs, and make THAT the flavour of the month.
Personally I'd get quite interested if some lecturer claimed to have
some method (any method) that could be demonstrated convincingly and
was immediately useful to all astrologers.
Usually if there's any real substance in any astrological claim, an
outline of it can be written in a few sentences.

I've long held the opinion that the sun sign has been  unjustly
neglected for more alluring but less reliable esoterica. I place great
importance on the  moon  sign, and on aspects, especially  those
involving the moon and Mercury. Oddly, I haven't found sun *aspects* to
always  be as reliable. Perhaps it's because they are more deep seated
or subtle.
However, as a rule (to which there are exceptions) virtually nothing in
the chart can be counted on to be as informative in describing the basic
personality and character as the sign the sun was in at birth. It seems
to  rather override even powerfully contradictory indices, e.g., Sun in
Aries "vs." Venus rising in Taurus. The Aries characteristics are simply
*there* and that's all there is to it, despite of course the  variations
and complexities that other powerful aspects/sign combinations denote.
I suppose the reason is the sun's profound connection to the ego - those
probably most deep seated of man's motivations.
Don't let Linda Goodman's hyperbole,  newspaper columns, etc. cause you
to overlook this powerful and basic interpretive factor!

Actually, Linda Goodman's "Sun Signs" is a good book, if you want to
read about the signs. The "problem" with sun sign descriptions, is that
they are given as if that is all there is, the sign is pure and
expressing completely, whereas we know it never is in an actual person
because of the rest of the chart.

To answer the original poster: We can't do astrology without knowing the
signs, so it makes sense to come back to the basics every so often.

I totally agree with Roger's opinion that the sun sign is so often a
neglected facet of astrological interpretation. 'To come back to basics
every so often' is not, imho, a descriptive enough a term for the importance
of the significance of the Sun sign and its house position. So many people
live and stay within the confine and conditioning of their moon (and its
aspects), that achieving an individual state of consciousness or awareness
that their sun sign represents is not always easy or attainable.

I've long wanted to ask posters to this group to describe how they perceive
their sun and its house placing, irrespective of other aspects, working
towards this individuality process, other than through the 'stereotype'
character qualities. If it's conscious moves they undertake or 'things just
happen' that take them to the direction of their Sun sign and house. If they
find themselves 'fighting against' such a path, or enjoy the ride. If I
remember rightly, Keera and poster Ingrid both have 12th house Suns in
Sagittarius, yet their lives have obviously taken separate paths. But *what*
is it  that their 12th house Sag. Sun wants and *why*, that differs from,
e.g, James O's 12th house Sun in Taurus.  Esa and I share the same Sun sign
degree but in different houses. *What* is it that pushes him towards his
house placing and me towards mine, and *why*?

If the ISAR conference goes deeper into the meaning of the Sun sign and not
simply browses over its basic implications, everyone there will leave a lot
wiser :-).

Christine.

Sure. There will be similarities, but not having the same backgrounds or
charts, there won't be likenesses.

I'm having a hard time seeing the 12th house Sun as defining path in
life or what path it is defining. IME its drive and energy are so
internatalized in that house. I don't think Sagittarius has a problem
with the 12th house though, since the 12th readily lends itself to lofty
thought and forays into philosophy and musings about life in general. At
least, that's what it does in my life - no limits imposed. My clearest
experience with Sun in 12th, was my (infamous) Saturn transit in 12th
(also opposing 6th house Moon). I truly felt then all the negative
Saturn keywords (I was depressed and worried), but I finally also
remembered (Saturn) a technique that fits very well with the 12th's
dominion over mental health: I remembered that I could use affirmations,
I remembered that I could reprogram my subconscious, I remembered that
_I_ control my mind and therefore my experience (keeping mind my wordy
Moon is also involved). The study (Sag) of metaphysics (12th) is what
led me to affirmations. I have also always sought a faith, sought God,
and did find a faith during T Neptune in 12th on Sun and T Jupiter on
Moon (age 17) that has worked for me ever since. (Thanks for making me
go look; I wasn't actually aware of what transits were in effect at that
time. Natally, I have Jupiter sextile Neptune and Jupiter is chart
ruler.)

">

My guess: 12th house stuff, but for different reasons and done with
different methods. Reading metaphysical books may do it for a Sag; a
Taurean may prefer whale song as ways of connecting to 12th house
matters (Life, the Ocean and Everything). Madonna is a 12th house Leo
and she's always had a spiritual bent, if only obvious off-stage.

RM: I think that's because we have simply focussed a lot more on Sun
signs and know a lot more about them. Same with Moon and Ascendant.
We often see very strong things in a person which can be seen easily
by any observant astrologer, but we tend to keep saying Sun. Moon,
Ascendant and THEN tacking on major factors which can override any of
them. Still, that's the way astrology is practised, but if anyone out
there want to show-off and look like a really smart astrologer -- go
straight for what strikes you as the most important things in a chart
or in the person.
Each of us is attuned to certain things in charts and in people, so as
soon as we gain experience in Tropical astrology it's best to go with
our own impressions rather than following others.

I do agree that Linda Goodman's sun sign analyses are basically sound.
It's just that her  often effusive style and belaboring of her point
could become wearying and offputting to some.

BTW, her 'Star Signs' contains what, in my humble opinion, is the finest
system of *numerology* I've ever encountered. She must have discovered
this from an old master. I think she references her source in the back
of her book, which I cannot access at the moment. Would anyone happen to

I just happened to have this book lying around.  In the bibliography,

'The Kabala of Numbers', New York: Samuel Weiser Publications, 1913.
One of the finest, if not the finest book in the field of
spiritual numerology, closely aligned with astrology. Extremely

Thanks for checking the Goodman book, Blahh.
Well I'm not surprised: "Cheiro", from all accounts, was one of the
better prognosticators of the 20th century,  supposedly with a huge and
well satisfied clientele.  He would seem to have had *something* right
going for him.

I think I'm pretty out of touch with what goes on among astrologers
as a whole, but, here's one idea on "sun sign astrology for the
masses in different forms".

I recall there was a website, years ago, that used to do these very
nice transit forecasts, and it occurred to me that such a format
would be far better than the pathetically over-generalized newspaper
sun sign horoscopes.

So, this isn't exactly my own original idea. :-)

The basic idea would be to do away with the 12 sun sign divisions
altogether, maybe list out the current positions of the various
planets, and then give the approximate birthdates of people who are
currently having notable transits to their suns, along with a
description of what things they might expect with those transits.

So, today, for instance - Mars is at 5 Pisces.  Such an article could
mention that people with their suns close to 5 Pisces, 5 Gemini, 5
Sagittarius or 5 Virgo are all having a hard-aspect Mars transit,
and give all those people's approximate birth dates, and describe
what such a transit might mean for them.  Etc., etc.  Not long from
now, Mars and Uranus will be conjunct at 10 Pisces - could do a
delineation of those combined factors for people with suns around 10
Pisces, Gemini, Sagittarius and Virgo.

Perhaps such an article would have a much better chance of applying
to those people than to the 1/12th of all people who happen to share
a sun sign (but who may not all have a given transit actually within
a reasonable orb of aspecting their sun).

Of course, to skeptics of astrology this would probably look only
marginally less silly than the normal newspaper horoscopes do... :-)
Even so, though, it would probably be a step forward in showing "the
masses" how astrology is really done.

Can't underestimate the damage the newspaper horoscopes do, in many
people's eyes, to astrology's already probably nonexistent (or nearly
nonexistent) credibility.

Sounds to me like you're talking about using a graphic ephemeris (90
degree).

IME, monthly horoscopes are more accurate than weekly or daily. At any
rate, it really depends on the publication and the astrologer they've
hired. I've seen horoscopes broken down to the decanate level, which
gives about the same accuracy as you've outlined above, but I can't say
I've seen horoscopes using the 90 degree ephemeris. It would just
confuse the layperson (we're talking horoscope columns in non-astrology
magazines/sites, I assume) since most people don't know more than the
name of their Sun sign, and wouldn't understand why their Gemini
forecast was lumped with Pisces, Sagittarius and Virgo. They know their
birthdate, though, so they can read for their decanate.

I agree. _Newspaper_ horoscopes are notoriously inaccurate, and are
often the only time people see astrology.

&gt; I think I'm pretty out of touch with what goes on among astrologers

&gt; I recall there was a website, years ago, that used to do these very

IRH: Hello Blahhh:
The much spoken about newspaper-astrology *is* in fact a transit
description, of course much better, if and when cut in three segments each
sign -
i.e. the first decan = the first 10 degrees of that sign, the "newpaper
astrologer" will say: "if your birthday is from .... to ...., then  ...
" - - - and on.
PLUS: with the description of "Mars being at 5° Pisces, etc."  will be good
only, if and when people know enough of the basic astrology.
Most non-interested in depth will not want to bother. They have their own
jobs, interests and hobbies. Like going to the doctor, but not having to
*study* medicine :-)
As one of my friends told me recently "Never mind your transits and all that
other mumbojumbo, just tell me the facts that I can understand. I am not
going to start studdying all that. I trust you to tell me the truth, like I
had to trust my heart surgeon to do the right thing. Well, he saved my
life."
So I had to re-think the sentences to convert ALL technical expressions.
Result: she was happy. - The main thing :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Perhaps such an article would have a much better chance of applying

IRH: Well, the  imagined or real "damage" is, when the newspaper astrologer
did not do such a good job, or copies someone else´s writing without
checking.
This did happen some years back and is probably still happening all over the
world (have not followed up on this fact).
Some are, much like in any other field of expertise half trained or even not
trained, but want to make the money.
BTW: This would in deed be a great thread for researching the various
newspaper astrology authors, as a result even that part of the branche might
improve. - -
So much on this.

::nods::  Hmm, yes.  I suppose that way it could be a bit more

But perhaps if paper space is an issue, it might be possible and
desirable to condense them into a joint GEM-VIR-SAG-PIS decanate
forecast.  I think possibly the layperson's confusion could be
alleviated easily enough with a brief explanation... it would just
seem unfamiliar at first, but perhaps they could get used to it. :-)

Hmm... I wonder if a good (non-decanate) delineation for that
particular Mars/Uranus conjunction at 10 degrees Pisces might be...

"If you are born around Feb. 28-Mar. 1, May 30-June 1, Sept. 1-3,
or Dec. 1-3, you might be feeling very excitable, agitated and
short-tempered around May 15, 2005.  Avoid getting into fights,

RM: Good idea. So, any given newspaper column would provide readings
for 4 birthdays in any year plus another 8 birthdays if a small orb
and leap-days are allowed for, thus giving a total of 12 birthdays out
of 366, or 1 in 30 people.

RM: If you had spoken openly about astrology for years [in a free
society] and had offered to read charts, or parts of charts  for a
large number of acquantances, you would have heard an array of
opinions about astrology which point to a wide acceptance of it -
particularly amongst those who were exposed to some of the facts about
it.

Newspaper Sun sign columns don't damage astrology in the eyes of most
people, because surveys have shown that the majoity of readers
actually like and support them. That's why 186 scientists signed a
document ridiculing newspaper readers' assessment of Sun sign
astrology (without having investigated it I might add). There's a high
percentage of astrologers who ridicule newspaer Sun sign columns
(perhaps 90%)  but a much lower percentage of actual readers (around
35% I think it was).

Those Sun sign columns and the more detailed magazine articles have
actually helped (Tropical) astrology enormously, and they've made it
socially acceptable for people to make further enquiries about it.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I've been looking at the ISAR website and I'm surprised to see that
&gt;&gt; &gt; several astrologers and speakers are scheduled to discuss sun sign
&gt;&gt; &gt; astrology for the masses in different forms.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Is this a new trend in professional astrology? In finding ways to
&gt;&gt; &gt; discuss sun signs in a thoughtful, respectful way, when &quot;real&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; astrology tends to look at charts and progressions and transits that
&gt;&gt; &gt; require more than just the sun sign?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Best,

&gt;&gt; &gt; Gib

&gt;&gt; I think I'm pretty out of touch with what goes on among astrologers
&gt;&gt; as a whole, but, here's one idea on &quot;sun sign astrology for the
&gt;&gt; masses in different forms&quot;.

&gt;&gt; I recall there was a website, years ago, that used to do these very
&gt;&gt; nice transit forecasts, and it occurred to me that such a format
&gt;&gt; would be far better than the pathetically over-generalized newspaper
&gt;&gt; sun sign horoscopes.

&gt;&gt; So, this isn't exactly my own original idea. :-)

&gt;&gt; The basic idea would be to do away with the 12 sun sign divisions
&gt;&gt; altogether, maybe list out the current positions of the various
&gt;&gt; planets, and then give the approximate birthdates of people who are
&gt;&gt; currently having notable transits to their suns, along with a
&gt;&gt; description of what things they might expect with those transits.

&gt;&gt; So, today, for instance - Mars is at 5 Pisces.  Such an article could
&gt;&gt; mention that people with their suns close to 5 Pisces, 5 Gemini, 5
&gt;&gt; Sagittarius or 5 Virgo are all having a hard-aspect Mars transit,
&gt;&gt; and give all those people's approximate birth dates, and describe
&gt;&gt; what such a transit might mean for them.  Etc., etc.  Not long from
&gt;&gt; now, Mars and Uranus will be conjunct at 10 Pisces - could do a
&gt;&gt; delineation of those combined factors for people with suns around 10
&gt;&gt; Pisces, Gemini, Sagittarius and Virgo.

&gt;IRH: Hello Blahhh:
&gt;The much spoken about newspaper-astrology *is* in fact a transit
&gt;description, of course much better, if and when cut in three segments each
&gt;sign -
&gt;i.e. the first decan = the first 10 degrees of that sign, the &quot;newpaper
&gt;astrologer&quot; will say: &quot;if your birthday is from .... to ...., then  ...
&gt;&quot; - - - and on.
">

RM: Some Sun sign columns are based on the Moon travelling through the
Sun signs, so there *are* actually aspects from the Moon to the Sun in
each 2.5 day period.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;PLUS: with the description of &quot;Mars being at 5° Pisces, etc.&quot;  will be good
&gt;only, if and when people know enough of the basic astrology.

RM: No, if readers are given 12 birthdates based on 5 Pisces, Gemini,
Virgo or Sagittarius (every day) then the "mini-reading" reading would
be valid ie: Mar con Su; opp Sun or square Sun.

&gt;&gt; Perhaps such an article would have a much better chance of applying

&gt;&gt; a reasonable orb of aspecting their sun).

&gt;&gt; Of course, to skeptics of astrology this would probably look only
&gt;&gt; marginally less silly than the normal newspaper horoscopes do... :-)
&gt;&gt; Even so, though, it would probably be a step forward in showing &quot;the
&gt;&gt; masses&quot; how astrology is really done.

&gt;&gt; Can't underestimate the damage the newspaper horoscopes do, in many

Thanks to everyone who's responded to the thread so far.

The ISAR track on sun sign astrology is how to make sun sign astrology
good astrology and also how to make it relatable to the massess.
People like Susan Miller (whom I quite like) will present.

Susan Miller does a lot of what's been recommended here.  She gives
specifics for ranges of birthdays like the decanates mentioned.  And
she also mentions transits.  However, some of the transits she talks
about in completely metaphorical terms.  For example, something along
the lines of, "Neptune blows a kiss to Venus in your house of romance
and creativity on the __th of the month, so look for artistic projects
to blosson or a romance to take wing.  If you were born on ___, expect
____.."

I checked the Linda Goodman book.  As someone mentioned, she does talk
about other factors in the forward.

The justification she gives is that sun signs are about 80% accurate,
and for some people as much as 90% accurate.  She says that the other
20% is very important, but the sun sign tells you a lot.

I'm not sure if this is very responsive, but my Sun is in Pisces in the

the Piscean description is particularly apt (as long as one doesn't

&gt; &gt;gives about the same accuracy as you've outlined above, but I can't

&gt; Yes.

&gt; &gt;since most people don't know more than the

I think I'm still going to be shaking my head and saying those magazine

have a good way to do predictions. The problem with the above method and
the advantage to grouping by Sun sign is that the latter is easier to
look up. Also, I don't think it would save space. You have to do
horoscopes for _all_ signs and all parts of the signs, anyway.

Hi Gib,
It's not a case of being the ~best~ example but being willing to offer an(y)
example of how you consider your 1st house Sun in Pisces to work, for which
I personally thank you. I would think that all those with a 1st house Sun
would share the 'personal identity' issue in some way, but Pisces 'total
lack of personal identity' is entirely different to e.g. the 1st house Leo's
'identity awareness', Virgo's 'identity crisis', or Scorpio's 'privacy of
identity'.Within those signs/house, there will also be different expressions
of the position.
Actual examples of how they manifest are, for a practical Taurus Sun like
myself,  the best way to improve one's astro. knowledge. Unfortunately, most
posters prefer not to indulge in factual experiences.

As merely an example, my sun is in the 9th house. In Taurus, it seems to
indicate that I actually  'live on foreign soil (Earth)' to express myself.
But not every 9th house Taurean sun
experiences the same, so what does it mean to them? And there are 9th house
Suns in other signs that also live or have contact with 'foreign horizons'
but for different reasons. What are those reasons and how have they
manifested?

But that's just my personal quirk....I guess as a result of my questioning
mind....Mercury...also being in the 9th house ;-))

Regards,
Christine.

I was once told that the Sun takes on the flavoring of the house it is
in, some Sun signs more than others (like Libra and Pisces). And I can
honestly say that I can relate to Pisces with my 12th house Sun. I have
also seen the "house flavoring" act out in other people.

RM: I feel silly saying such an obvious thing as this, but people with
Sun in Taurus don't have a monopoly on practicality. If they did, or
if only a moderate proportion of them had a strong tendency towards
learning best in practical ways, it would be obvious in schools and
universities or even aamod.
Your second claim about most posters preferring not to indulge in
factual experiences, is also off the mark because most posters (or
astrologers) love to hear about real-life examples (that don't require
stretching the imagination too much), but many don't offer examples on
newsgroups, presumably because they/we can't be bothered or don't have
time.

RM: I think charts need to be read in a manner that gives us the
strongest clues first, and this sometimes means that we have our basic
outline of a person long before planets in houses are added to the
mix. Of course astrologers often presume that the Sun in a house holds
more priority than the Moon or planets in the various houses, but if
it doesn't have priority, then we could easily be giving it extra
weight without good cause and decreasing our accuracy.

Notwithsanding the above, I've seen some people who show their Sun in
a House more strongly than their Sun sign, but they each had the Sun
close to the Angles in houses 12/1 -- 3/4 -- 6/7 -- 9/10.

be *able* to express one's self" rather than *how* one expresses one's
self. I suggested that Christine would probably have always expressed
herself and probably didn't need to change countries to do be able to
do it (because of some strong Gemini-like qualities of being very
expressive).

RM: That's right. Astrologers haven't been able to prove yet that any
one Sun sign is generally more expressive than another, but we do have
the impression that in the main, Gemini's are more or less
irrepressible communicators.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Actual examples of how they manifest are, for a practical Taurus Sun like

&gt;&gt; RM: I feel silly saying such an obvious thing as this,

&gt;It's good to feel silly at times.

&gt;&gt; but people with
&gt;&gt; Sun in Taurus don't have a monopoly on practicality.

&gt;The use of monopoly is your word, not mine. Yet I would be lying if I said
&gt;*my* spirit worked in a theoretical or 'feeling' way, and it definitely
&gt;isn't quick or (in)decisive. Astrologically, I believe it true to say that
&gt;Earth refers to tangibilility; that which is based on substance and not
&gt;ideas or feelings, is therefore physically apparent, can be touched and/or
&gt;applied. The Earth signs each show their own particular manner of working
&gt;within that frame of tangibility. Imho.
&gt;You want to change the manner in which astrology is applied to your own
&gt;vision? Fine.
&gt;I have found that which has been handed down through time works very well.

RM: I have a strong leaning towards checking astrological claims to
see if they hold water, rather than accept what's been handed down -
so we can improve it, not change it for the sake of change.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I find it personally of interest that your own birth date shows no planetary
&gt;positions in Earth.
&gt;It explains a lot regarding the differences between our individual focuses.
">

RM: It just goes to show how a person may appear to be less grounded
(based on astrological theory) but a few decades of my history has
shown that I actually spend more time than most astrologers in
"nailing stuff down" and checking the facts -- particularly in
relation to transits. There would have to be a simple explanation for
this because it's so prominent, and if it's an astrological
explanation then it would show that other chart factors can override a
lack of Earth, and presumably Fire, Water or Air.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; if only a moderate proportion of them had a strong tendency towards

&gt;I think it has long been proven in schools, if not always acted upon, that
&gt;different temperament and tendencies exist. Quick or slow to learn,
&gt;practical or theoretical minded, creative or gut-feeling application, are
&gt;signs (non-astrologically speaking) every good teacher picks up in a
&gt;student.
">

RM: We have to bear in mind that (so far) not a single astrological
claim or bit of theory has been proven in schools or anywhere else.
It's true of course that some students respond better to different
types of instruction than others, but we haven't got a clue if there
is any relationship between that and their charts because we haven't
looked. We couldn't even start doing that until we devised a method of
determining which category each student fitted into - either
generally, or for particular subjects.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Your second claim about most posters preferring not to indulge in
&gt;&gt; factual experiences, is also off the mark because most posters (or

&gt;&gt; stretching the imagination too much), but many don't offer examples on

&gt;It is impossible to say how life would otherwise have turned out had I
&gt;remained in my native country where, at the time, I was definitely 'under

&gt;squares I have to contend with. Circumstances occured that I met my
&gt;would-be-husband who came from a different country and culture and wasn't
&gt;allowed to work in England, so I made that life-changing decision to live in
&gt;his country. And I have remained in this country (constancy of Taurus?) and
&gt;not flitted around all over the globe as another 9th house Sun might do.

&gt;I just find it astrologically synchronistic that it was 'on foreign soil'
&gt;that my life 'opened up' and progressed in the fashion it has; and that's
&gt;what astrology is all about,.... isn't it ?

&gt;&gt;I mean you sound more like Gemini

freely in your native country - not so much on *how* you communicate.
The mere fact that you left your native country so you *could*

always there. Besides that, no one would have even tried to stop your

&gt;&gt; &gt; But not every 9th house Taurean sun
&gt;&gt; &gt; experiences the same, so what does it mean to them? And there are 9th
&gt;&gt; &gt; house Suns in other signs that also live or have contact with 'foreign
&gt;&gt; &gt; horizons' but for different reasons. What are those reasons and
how have they
&gt;&gt; &gt; manifested?

&gt;&gt; RM: I think charts need to be read in a manner that gives us the
&gt;&gt; strongest clues first, and this sometimes means that we have our basic
&gt;&gt; outline of a person long before planets in houses are added to the
&gt;&gt; mix.

&gt;So disregarding houses and that you already 'know' something about me;
&gt;As an astrologer, how and what planetary themes or technique would you use
&gt;to suggest to parents, who came to you for a reading for their child, that
&gt;there was a strong tendency that the child would leave the place of birth to
&gt;settle for good elsewhere? From transits? Or would you just state the
&gt;characteristics of the planets in, or without, their signs?
">

RM: Generally I wouldn't give parents any indication of an increased
chance of a child leaving their place of birth and settling for good
elsewhere based only on Sun in the 9th house, probably because I'd be
wrong more than 50% of the time. That sort of prediction has a
reasonably clear Yes/No answer unless we want to count moving 50 miles
into a different "culture" within the same country or marrying someone
of another culture and living in the next street.
Any reference to the child's Sun in the 9th house would include
*examples* of how it is more likely to manifest and the above scenario
would only be one of them, but I wouldn't even mention it unless the
Sun was reasonably close to the MC (under about 15 degrees) because
House systems with their "rubbery boundaries" are too unreliable for
me to take seriously. You know, a Sun might be in the 9th House with
the Koch system, but with the 8th House in Campanus.
If however I saw a bunch of things in the (complete) 9th house, then
I'd mention the long distance travel or different culture scenario
more prominently, but only if one or more of the planets were less
than about 15-20 degrees from the MC.
Naturally factors in Sagittarius would figure with the above scenario
too, particularly Asc, Mo, Su, Mer, Ven, Mar, Jup.

RM: In this case there was a distinct "restriction of communication"
(or expressing one's individuality) and moving to a foreign country
solved the problem to some extent, so the astrological claim about Sun
in the 9th house naturally appears to be be fitting. If the long
distance move had not taken place it wouldn't even be an issue. For
example if her husband stayed in England the Sun in the 9th would
still have "worked" - (having lifetime contact with a person from
another culture, and perhaps visits to his homeland and family). If
that didn't work there may have been a series of 9th house interestes
including astrology.

that distribution looks like -- although I *will* look when I get the
chance, but I'd be very surpised if there was a peak in the 9th house

My American-born grandma has a 9th house Sun. Her 2nd marriage was to a
foreigner who became a US citizen, but after retirement they ended up in
his country of birth - with me and because of me (such were the
circumstances). Her 9th house Sun (she always read travel books, never
imagining she would actually get to travel) and my 12th house (overseas)
Sun -- we are both still in Norway, neither of us with a drop of
Norwegian blood in us.

I knew another 9th house Virgo; she travelled a lot and she read a lot
about foreign countries and cultures. In her later years, Islam
fascinated (and scared) her. She subscribed to many newspapers; her
Jupiter was in Gemini. Both she and my grandma have Sag rising, which
emphasizes the 9th house flavoring.

Sometimes it's hard to say exactly what the Sun's sign or house position
is really about, because other stuff in the chart also says the same
thing. But that's really as it should be; the different parts of a chart
point to a theme and even more obscure things like midpoints and dwads
will echo the same theme.

So perhaps one way to ask the question is: The Sun is in the nth house;
what theme does that suggest for the native and does the rest of the
chart bear that out?

I have always agreed with your expressed opinion that a pattern is often
repeated in several ways that is indicative of one imporant theme. I've
found it to work not only in the birth chart but also through
transits/progressions.
What do they say? Once is possible, twice is coincidence, but three times

A good way to put it. Let us hope that AAM'ers will become less modest and
throw in some examples to prove it :-)
Appreciated your posts, Keera.

&gt; &gt;&gt; RM: I think charts need to be read in a manner that gives us the
&gt; &gt;&gt; strongest clues first, and this sometimes means that we have our basic
&gt; &gt;&gt; outline of a person long before planets in houses are added to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; mix.

&gt; &gt;So disregarding houses and that you already 'know' something about me;
&gt; &gt;As an astrologer, how and what planetary themes or technique would you
use
&gt; &gt;to suggest to parents, who came to you for a reading for their child,
that
&gt; &gt;there was a strong tendency that the child would leave the place of birth
to
&gt; &gt;settle for good elsewhere? From transits? Or would you just state the
&gt; &gt;characteristics of the planets in, or without, their signs?

&gt; RM: Generally I wouldn't give parents any indication of an increased
&gt; chance of a child leaving their place of birth and settling for good
&gt; elsewhere based only on Sun in the 9th house, probably because I'd be
&gt; wrong more than 50% of the time. That sort of prediction has a
&gt; reasonably clear Yes/No answer unless we want to count moving 50 miles
&gt; into a different &quot;culture&quot; within the same country or marrying someone
&gt; of another culture and living in the next street.
&gt; Any reference to the child's Sun in the 9th house would include
&gt; *examples* of how it is more likely to manifest and the above scenario
&gt; would only be one of them, but I wouldn't even mention it unless the
&gt; Sun was reasonably close to the MC (under about 15 degrees) because
&gt; House systems with their &quot;rubbery boundaries&quot; are too unreliable for
&gt; me to take seriously. You know, a Sun might be in the 9th House with
&gt; the Koch system, but with the 8th House in Campanus.
&gt; If however I saw a bunch of things in the (complete) 9th house, then
&gt; I'd mention the long distance travel or different culture scenario
&gt; more prominently, but only if one or more of the planets were less
&gt; than about 15-20 degrees from the MC.
&gt; Naturally factors in Sagittarius would figure with the above scenario
&gt; too, particularly Asc, Mo, Su, Mer, Ven, Mar, Jup.
">

I have a Sag. I.C., and Jupiter in the 12th house (whichever house system is
used).
Apart from its 12th house meaning, I have tended to think that ruler I.C. in
12th  was 'another theme' that, in my case, strengthened the effect of a 9th
house Sun on foreign soil (still referring to the Earth element). The home
roots (I.C.) are no longer a tangible influence on the direction one's life
takes.
It may be of interest to others reading, that my Sag. husband's chart also
shares the same house cusps as my own, with Jupiter in 12th. But he has a
4th house Sun, plus Moon in Cancer. No place like home to him :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; RM: Ive never heard of any astrologer dismissing the importance of the
&gt; Sun in astrology. I was actually talking about the *priority* some
&gt; astrologers give to the Sun in the Houses. I'm not convinced that any

&gt; Sure, it's nice and neat - Sun, Moon Asc -- but do we really know
&gt; which factors are the strongest, and which astrologers are hitting the
&gt; nail on the head the best?
&gt; We all agree that *some* astrological factors are more reliable and

I think you unduly confuse issues for yourself by continualy preferring to
sift the chaff with the corn, whilst you attempt to turn astrology into a
scientifically proven logic, rather than accept the proof shown within the
philosophy it is. That is your privilege, but I truly don't believe that the
majority of astrologers share your reasoning.

&gt; &gt;The Moon gets its light from the Sun. Why else does it astrologically

bigger,
&gt; &gt;better, wider and expansive, and not shorter, smaller and inferior?
&gt; &gt;Saturn is encircled by 7 rings. Why does it astrologically refer to
&gt; &gt;confinement and boundaries...and possibly the 7 sins....and not war,
peace,

Not made up; correlation to.
Every astrologer is fully aware that Astrology is a belief system, yet finds
proof in everday correlation. Your attempt to turn it into a scientifically

students with Sun in Taurus, then it would be worth following up.

If the research project was big enough it might reveal that there was
a definite scientific correlation with only a miniscule increase in
the percentage, although if that WAS the case it would be virtually
useless in real life. If however there was a big increase in the
percentage of Taureans in that category, then the "astrological claim"
would not only be 'proven' to exceed the chance levels, but it would
also be predictable in advance and of great importance to the
Education system.

You say that as if you don't even realize the obvious--all people are not
the same. Therefore to question whether it's the Sun , Moon, or ASC that is
the strongest factor (suggesting in ALL charts) is nothing short of
ridiculous. The answer is, it varies from person to person. What stands out
strongest in one person's chart might be their ASC ruler in the 10th--if
it's in Leo, heck don't be shocked when a ton of people ask that person if
they are a Leo Sun. That must mean they reeeeeealy come across with leonine
tendencies. Say Jupiter opposes that Venus. Now you have the exaggerated
leonine tendencies that could indeed lead people to say "hey are you a Leo?"

Take GW Bush with Pluto conjunct his ASC. It knocks you over! It is so
pervasive in his personality one would have to be deaf, dumb, and blind to
miss it. It sure as heck isn't his Cancer Sun that knocks you over. That's
why I have to laugh when people think the ASC is just about how you look or
some other such superficial nonsense. If the ASC was weak in importance,
then a planet conjunct the ASC would also be weak. As most people know, that
simply is not the case.

I've always felt Pluto rather obliterated consciousness of

tUranus was conjunct my Sun, then my Saturn return, then

stationed right on it at least once). This covers about 6-7

We forget, sometimes, to consider what the common denominator for all
things 9th house - like philosophy, religion, law, higher education and
foreign stuff (as in from another country) - are really all about. It's
about expanding (Jupiter) your mind or awareness and going beyond what's
(literally) right in front of your face. Philosophers grapple with
thoughts that can drive some people crazy; religion is based on an
unseen deity; higher education introduces new ideas that may conflict
with the old, as does exposure to foreign customs and languages. Law is
an attempt at organizing society according to morals, and the
practicality of it is known only when it's actually tried out
(10th/Capricorn).

I don't know if it is. I just know it puts Pluto (and North Node)
properly in my 9th which makes more sense to me, considering that my
life has taken me to a foreign land, thanks to a foreign grandfather

resources, and that fits too.

Another thing about Koch, is that my Capricorn/Cancer is no longer
intercepted. I can't make up my mind if my 8th is Sun or Moon ruled,
however.

I wouldn't have made it, either. I don't associate Virgo with
conservatism. Pragmatism, yes. In fact, Virgo is very easy to associate
with environmentalism and so want to _conserve_ a forest, for example,
but not necessarily have conservative political ideas. I've found
Virgo's opposite, Pisces, to be far more stodgy idealogy-wise.

The Earth signs will conserve and preserve, but that's not necessarily
saying that their conservation will match a political bent of same. What
the Earth signs do do, is follow the rules, the traditional power
structures - at least as long as it works for them.

Actually, the Placidus house system also puts your Pluto in the 9th
House-- at least, it does if you "do it right," or calculate the
position of each planet within its own semi-arcs. If your astrology
software includes an option to display the Gauquelin sectors, then you
can see this for yourself, because it puts Pluto in sector 12, which is
part of the 9th House (sectors 12, 11, and 10 correspond to the 9th
House). I think some programs call this the "Placidus rational
semi-arc" method.

I believe that the Campanus house system also puts Pluto in your 9th
House-- again, if you "do it right," or use what is often called the
"Campanus mundoscope."

It's good to remember that the standard method of placing planets in
the houses (i.e., by longitude alone) is not terribly accurate.

I guess a strong Scorpio influence will always be strongly receptive to
Pluto transits.

My own 'obliteration of consciousness' occured at the tr. Pluto in Libra
150* natal Sun (with tr. Neptune 150* from Sagittarius) when 'others'
influence upon me was so strong that their actions, thoughts and lives
obliterated anything of my own.
My life's course was dependent upon their decisions rather than dictating
its own. The transitional moment of awareness came when my  life regained
its importance and priority. The physical outweighed the theoretical and
emotional :-)

I think this is where my Virgo Ascendant also cringes. As has long been
evident here, I'm inclined to 'box' attitudes and qualities to try to get to
an exact meaning. When I read words like 'communicate' or 'love' or
'impulse' etc. referring to whatever Sun sign, I have trouble because, to
me, those words are referring to the functions of Mercury, Venus and Mars
etc. in the chart. If they aspect the Sun, the Sun will share the decision
regarding the nature of their expression.
I'm inclined to agree that Virgo, as a sign, doesn't 'grandstand' as it
were, but if something else in the chart shows such a tendency, e.g. Venus
in Leo or Sagittarius's physical or romantic desire to show just how much it
loves someone, Virgo will consider what is the most logical step to prove
it, once it has got past the (un)necessary grandeur and drama of it all :-)
It could include the use of billboard and plane, but which attributes I
don't think would suit a Venus in Scorpio to Virgo Sun or a Venus in Virgo
to Pisces Sun to express the same thing :-).

Christine.

Classical quadrant house systems are mainly based on mundo positions
(that's what the Gauquelins used, by the way).  Comparing longitudes of
cusps and planets is only an approximation to the geometries of these
systems (eg campanus, regiomontanus, placidus, topocentric).

&gt; Actually, the Placidus house system also puts your Pluto in the 9th

Astrolog does.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; then you can see this for yourself, because it puts Pluto in sector 12,
&gt; which is part of the 9th House (sectors 12, 11, and 10 correspond to the
&gt; 9th House). I think some programs call this the &quot;Placidus rational
&gt; semi-arc&quot; method.

&gt; I believe that the Campanus house system also puts Pluto in your 9th
&gt; House-- again, if you &quot;do it right,&quot; or use what is often called the
&gt; &quot;Campanus mundoscope.&quot;

Well, my software doesn't have the capability, so I'm "stuck" with an
8th house Pluto. OTOH, with Placidus, the 9th house cusp falls right on
my SU-MO midpoint. :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's good to remember that the standard method of placing planets in
&gt; the houses (i.e., by longitude alone) is not terribly accurate.
">

I've found that I distrust house cusps more than I used to, not just
because of my own Pluto, but because there are so many house systems.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Don't believe I've ever made that connection.

&gt; &gt;I wouldn't have made it, either. I don't associate Virgo with
&gt; &gt;conservatism. Pragmatism, yes. In fact, Virgo is very easy to associate
&gt; &gt;with environmentalism and so want to _conserve_ a forest, for example,
&gt; &gt;but not necessarily have conservative political ideas. I've found
&gt; &gt;Virgo's opposite, Pisces, to be far more stodgy idealogy-wise.

&gt; &gt;The Earth signs will conserve and preserve, but that's not necessarily
&gt; &gt;saying that their conservation will match a political bent of same. What
&gt; &gt;the Earth signs do do, is follow the rules, the traditional power
&gt; &gt;structures - at least as long as it works for them.

&gt; I think there's a set of roughly equivalent words that could apply...

Right. Some of the liveliest people I've known have been Capricorns. I
suspect we are talking "modus operandi" rather than personality.
Sometimes that's how the Sun expresses itself: In method, rather than
character.

I wonder if that isn't based on some study showing that most prositutes

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;You mention the effect of the early 80's, which correlates to tr.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Pluto's completion (if one includes BML :-) )  of a kite figure and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;cardinal T-square, or at least the ME-NE to MO-JU square,  from the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;9th house (either house system). Coincidental again that Jupiter is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;involved. Would this provide the extra 9th house colouring of a theme
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;that might otherwise have been less profound, or; can one take away
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the house significance and, through Jupiter, reach the same
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;conclusion?

&gt; &gt;&gt; I've always felt Pluto rather obliterated consciousness of
&gt; &gt;&gt; any other transits for quite a while. The whole transition
&gt; &gt;&gt; was a longer period than just Pluto, all significant
&gt; &gt;&gt; transits considered. Also, I have a bunch of Jupiter/Sag/9th
&gt; &gt;&gt; house stuff natally.

&gt; &gt;Obliterates consciousness of other things. Yes, I agree. That's exactly
&gt; &gt;what a Pluto transit feels like.

&gt; What exactly is that energy? It's almost a tangible thing...
&gt; like being emotionally overwhelmed for years at a time. I tried not to
&gt; numb out because it's counter-productive, but it's a truly relentless
&gt; transit.

I think I'll have to get back to you when it goes through all my
Capricorn. When Pluto conjuncted by Sun, all I (and my ego) felt was a
nice, warm steady glow and an absolute but happy unwillingness to put up
with any bullshit. Tangible, yes. The transit was memorable. (Most
aren't.)
