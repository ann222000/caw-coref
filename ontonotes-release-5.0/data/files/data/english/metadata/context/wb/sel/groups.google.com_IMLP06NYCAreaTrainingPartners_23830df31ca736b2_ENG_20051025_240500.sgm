WARNING: There's a lot here.

Discussion (questions to answer below)
1. I'm getting my ass moving on this, finally.

2. Since I don't think everyone wants to spend a fortune on these, I think we should go with a semi-custom jersey vs. a full custom.
Basically, semi-custom means that we'll add a logo to one or more spots on a tri-top with an existing pattern and choose colors. Nothing fancy, but puts it all together. This will probably be in the $40 range.
A full custom top (where we design the entire jersey (think of a tri-life jersey or look at the sample attached) will be more (a much as $80 or so, depending on how many people order).

3. Another benefit of the semi-custom is less hassle with the artwork. I am not artistically inclined and have created a simple logo that would go on the front of a jersey. Think 'euro sticker'. A jpg and html version are included. The perfectionist in the relationship did the nicer one.

4. More on artwork: eventually the logo (or whole jersey) will need to be drawn with software that is &quot;vector&quot; format, so if you have a lead on this, that'd be nice.

5. Colors: we want visibility. orange, pink, yellow, and day glo green have been discussed, with orange being the favorite right now. The jersey would probably not be entirely this color, but a good portion might be.

6. Suppliers:
Sugoi - 2 semi-custom designs (solid color or stipes), women's or unisex, &quot;blocky&quot; design covers shoulders, not like a tank top, min quantity = 12, ~$40 each (also do full-custom)

Voler - full custom, min quantity 25, offer women's shimmel, bra, and men's top (alternately, there is a style that is unisex and more like the sugoi). Great pricing, need to get a lot of people in on this. ~$40-45 each

Louis Garneau - 8 (cooler) semi-custom designs, min 12, $56.50 each at this quantity. (also do full custom)

There are other options, but these are the ones that people might have opinions on their gear.

7. Slogans:
Ride it like you stole it!
We'll steal your honey like we stole your bike!
You're sure that's locked?

8. Julia pointed out to me that SHBC isn't really a bicycle club, it's a triathlon club. Do we change the name? South Harlem Athletic Club (SHAC), South Harlem Triathlon Club (SHTC), Team Beat Matt?

Questions: (I'm in and I trust you, Donald is an acceptable answer to all)
1. In or out?
2. Semi- or full-custom? (If full, do you know someone that can do the artwork?)
3. Do you like the logo?
4. What color?
5. Preference on supplier?
6. Slogan?
7. Team Name?

Thanks,
-D
