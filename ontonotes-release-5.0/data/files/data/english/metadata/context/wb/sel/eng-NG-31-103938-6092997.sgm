I was forwarded this link about Winter Training. It seems to spell it
out pretty simply.

This writer perpetuates the myth of muscle memory. Muscle cells do not
have memory. Memory is a neurological function...a function of the
brain. Muscles do not remember, the brain does.

Good point, Sherry... about muscle memory... the idea of it is probably better represented by the less colloquial term "motor programming"... Both terms are an attempt to capture the idea that complex patterns of motor unit firing are refined and made more neurologically efficient by practice... and the more "perfect", frequent, and recent your practice, the better the end result.

But explain this for me... even though my muscles can't remember much, they sure remember being sore from last night's ride! :-)

Roger, thanks for sending out the article! Looks like a source for some good discussion!

Cheerio,
Kathy C. :-)
