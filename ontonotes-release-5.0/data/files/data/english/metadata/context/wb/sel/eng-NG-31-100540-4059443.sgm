I have a 1990 6000 LE that has been giving me problems.
Right now it will not even start.  I'm wondering if it's the
fuel pump.  It acts like fuel is not getting to the engine,
almost like it's out of gas.  Before this it was misfiring,
and after a while of driving it would start to shudder
severely and then cut off when going into the lower RPM.
Took it to the mechanics who suggested it may be a torque
converter lockup.  They disabled the torque converter and
that seemed to fix the stalling out problem, but now the
car, if it starts, shudders a lot and cuts off after just a
minute or two of running.  Any ideas or suggestions before i
have it towed to the mechanics?  Thanks.

Had a similar problem. Car would start fine then steadily idle rougher after
it warmed up. Once it was put in gear, it would die out. Come to find out,
it was the catalytic converter. The older ones use to come apart and
restrict the airflow out. Some of them had a big plug/patch on it that could
be popped/pried out. Depends on the type of converter, some had
pellets/beads and some honeycomb. Sometimes you can get under the car and
tap or hit the converter and hear stuff rattle inside. If that is the case,
"legally" it should be replaced but will run fine without the guts in the
converter or no converter at all. Hope this helps.

If it has a carb. then it should have a mechanical fuel pump on the front
left of the engine (as you look toward the back of the car). Once you find
the pump, crack open the line from the fuel pump to carb,  (while holding
the back nut). Have someone crank the engine with the line cracked. Should
get fuel out of the open line. If not, open a little further and try again.
If still no fuel, tighten line and find the fuel filter. It might be
clogged. Change filter. Some motors have two filters. One in-line between
the gas tank and fuel pump, and then one at the base of the carb where the
fuel line from the pump connects. This is more of a strainer, but they do
get plugged. They are usually half as long as your pinky.

Is this fuel injected and if so, is it Multi Port (MPFI) or Throttle Body
Injection (TBI)? If it is MPFI, crank the engine a couple of times and go to
the fuel rail. There should be a air cap towards the back. Remove the cap
and take a long skinny screwdriver or awl and carefully depress the valve
stem. If the pump if pumping, there will be fuel pressure there. Not sure
how much depends on the engine, pump etc., some 9 -13 psi and some 25 - 44
psi. Need to know what type engine. I can't remember what size mine was but
I think it was a 2.8L. If it is a TBI, you should remove the air cleaner and
look down in the throat and see the injector(s). When the engine is cranked,
you should see fuel spraying. The fuel pump for the fuel injected engines
are electric and in the fuel tank and 99% of the time the fuel tank has to
be dropped from the vehicle.They can be a pain, especially if the spanner
nut is rusted in place. Best suggestion is get a can of PB Blaster and soak
down the nut before attempting to remove.

Thanks for the advice.  I will check the fuel filter and
will try to check the catalytic converter tomorrow.  I don't
know if I'll me able to get under the car far enough to get
to it though, but I'll try.  The car is multiport fuel
injected, 3.1L V6.  One thing I failed to mention is that
when I'm trying to start the car, there is a strange humming
noise coming from the back near the gas tank.

Is it a constant noise when the key is on, even if you are not trying to
start?? If so, I would guess fuel pump.
