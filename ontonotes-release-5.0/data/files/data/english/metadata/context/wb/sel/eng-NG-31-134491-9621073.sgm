Hi, all.

Mad Railers is a very loosely organized group with no board of
directors or executive team. We like it that way but sometimes we need
to ask for a little help. My role is mainly securing a great meeting
location for free at MATC. I also try to organize meetings but I'm a
busy teacher coming off of a medical leave and I can't do enough. The
last two people who help organize meetings have moved out of state for
new Rails jobs. Woo hoo, that's just fabulous for them! But, now we
need some more people to step up and help out. Please let me know if
you could help the group this way.

Many thanks,

-Eric

I'd love to help organize.

If anyone has ideas for topics or times, let me know off-list.  I'll
collate and regurgitate by the end of the week.  Otherwise, I'll just
fake it up according to my own whims... :)

Thanks for always being the instigator of last resort, Eric!

I'd love to help out with the MadRails web site but now is a bad time
for me to even attempt to offer my time. I'm also just a front-end
designer, so I'm still learning RoR.

At least we have a wiki in place as its easy for the group to keep up
whenever it needs to be. If needed, I could help post bigger pages
(like when we have guest speakers, etc).

And yes Eric, thanks for staying in-state and carrying the MadRailers flag.

Cheers,

I would like to help and have some time.  Not sure how much I can do
remotely from Evanston.

Thanks for all the response to my call for help! And thanks for all the
thanks, too. How do all you volunteers think we should proceed? I have
not reserved the room for meetings this fall, maybe we should come up
with some dates. Let me know some dates and I'll book the room.

&gt;

My opinion is that we should troll for topics and volunteers, then fix
on a date once we've got a good agenda lined up.  I think a powerful
lineup is more important than regularity--for me, anyway.

How far in advance do you have to book a room, Eric?

I polled the team I work with and we came up with a list of possible topics:

SOLR/Sphinx
Behavior Driven Development
Integration with SOAP services (a.k.a. being enterprisey)
Rails 2.0 (what to expect, advantages, directions)
JRuby (and/or Rubinus, alternative Ruby implementations)
Deployment environments
RESTful web services
Localization/Globalize
Writing Rake tasks
Using Rails with/on Amazon Web Services
Contributing to Rails and other open source projects (writing patches)
Developing widgets for social networks (Facebook, OpenSocial, other)

Anybody have anything to contribute on these subjects?  Would coverage
of any of these compel you to attend a meeting?

What are other folks interested in that we missed?

Cheers,
Jonathan

It depends on the availability of the room. It is a very popular room.
The sooner the better, actually.

The Refactotum talk at RubyConf was enlightening. The idea was to reduce the
barrier that prevents average developers from contributing to open source
projects.

On the topic of topics for meet-ups ... here are a few more:

1) Present RoR as a viable alternative to Flash-based RIA's
2) How to utilize jQuery, Prototype, Yahoo UI, and other Ajax
libraries within RoR
3) Front-end to back-end ... how to make the connection
4) How to make RoR apps scalable and fast

I work on the front-end side of our enterprise-level social networking
app with a team of developers. We are currently using Open Laszlo and
Java to build it. They may be looking into alternative platforms
before making the final decision to fully dive into the OL/Java
development of our second beta.

As a side note, our developers are considering an HTML output, as
opposed to an embedded .SWF, hence my reasoning to want to introduce
them to RoR and my topic recommendations above.

Thoughts?
