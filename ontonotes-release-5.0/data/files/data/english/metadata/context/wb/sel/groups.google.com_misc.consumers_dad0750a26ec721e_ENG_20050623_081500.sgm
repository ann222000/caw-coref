Downsized at McDonald's ; Filmmaker Loses 18 Pounds in Debunking Fast-food
Flick
Soso Profiled in The Washington Times

Op-Eds &amp; Articles
by Soso Whaley
July 4, 2004

Marguerite Higgins, THE WASHINGTON TIMES

Soso Whaley's weight-loss plan veered from the popular low-carb diets. She
ate fast food for two months and lost 18 pounds. Ms. Whaley, a 49-year-old
animal trainer, last week finished her diet using the menu at McDonald's
restaurants. She will highlight her two, 30-day diets in a 60- to
90-minute documentary.

The film, scheduled for release this fall, rebuts several claims made by
Morgan Spurlock, who did the documentary &quot;Super Size Me,&quot;, Ms. Whaley said.
His film showed his weight gain and health problems after eating only
McDonald's food for a month.

&quot;The film is not about taking potshots at Mr. Spurlock. I'm not advocating
people boycott his movie or go eat for 30 days at McDonald's. I'm just
giving another side to the story,&quot; said Ms. Whaley, a Kensington, N.H.,
resident.

The film has no corporate sponsorship from any food or beverage company.

In &quot;Super Size Me,&quot; Mr. Spurlock ate at McDonald's restaurants for 30 days
with a 5,000-calorie limit, more than twice the 2,200 daily calories
recommended for the average man.

He &quot;super-sized&quot; his meal only when asked by the cashier in the 98-minute
film. McDonald's Corp., which called Mr. Spurlock's film &quot;irresponsible,&quot;
announced plans before the film was released in May to phase out its
super-size options by the end of the year.

A spokeswoman for Samuel Goldwyn Films, which distributed Mr. Spurlock's
film, said Mr. Spurlock was traveling and unavailable for comment.

His film has become part of a growing anti-obesity movement that has tried
to blame some of the cause of rising U.S. obesity rates on the food
industry. McDonald's and food manufacturer Kraft Foods Inc. have had
obesity-related lawsuits filed against them in the past two years.

Food companies have fought back by altering their serving sizes, promoting
healthy lifestyles and introducing more low-fat products.

Mr. Spurlock, who is 6 feet 2 inches tall, packed on 25 pounds and his
cholesterol level shot up 65 points by the end of the film.

By contrast, Ms. Whaley imposed a limit of 1,800 to 2,000 calories when she
started her diet April 1. But her intake would increase up to 3,000
calories &quot;when I gave myself the day off,&quot; she said.

She dropped 10 pounds from her 5-foot-3-inch frame in the first month of
her experiment, slimming down to 165 from 175. Her cholesterol level fell
to 197 from 237 by the beginning of May.

Like Mr. Spurlock, Ms. Whaley said she tried every item on the menu at
least once. But she spent about an hour doing moderate exercise three
times a week.

Although she did have salads, Ms. Whaley said she stuck with sandwiches,
fries, diet sodas and shakes.

&quot;I actually had a much tougher time when I got back in the real world [in
May] because I was so used to controlled portion sizes&quot; at the burger
chain, she said.

Ms. Whaley went back on the diet in June and lost another 8 pounds,
rounding out her weight at 157. Her cholesterol level edged up to 202.

She doesn't advise the fast-food diet for everyone. &quot;I recommend more
limiting your calories instead of food choices,&quot; she said.

McDonald's spokesman Walt Riker said the Oakbrook, Ill., fast- food chain
has had no contact with Ms. Whaley other than giving her permission to film
her documentary inside its restaurants.

&quot;We're certainly interested in seeing [Ms. Whaley's] film. It certainly
proves what we have been saying from Day Oneâ€”that there is plenty of choice
on the menu for a balanced diet,&quot; Mr. Riker said.

Ms. Whaley estimated the cost of the film to be $30,000 to $50,000. That
does not include her time spent or the staff help from the Competitive
Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank advocating free markets.

The organization gave Ms. Whaley an adjunct fellowship to work with her on
the film. The think tank may sponsor a screening of the film in the fall,
but has not contributed any money, said spokeswoman Jody Clarke.

Ms. Whaley said she plans to enter her work in several independent film
festivals.

Would have been neat to have filmed her diet for 60 days before she did
the McD diet. But that would have been cheating.

"/> Well, the point is that when Morgan Spurlock made Super Size Me, it
wasn't a fair experiment. He had an agenda to take down McDonald's. He
ate 5000 calories a day and didn't exercise. Gee, what a surprise that
he gained weight and cholesterol level. He could have done the same
experiment at Subway (eat 5000 calories and not exercise) and gotten
the same results.

Morgan Spurlock tried to convince us that McDonald's was to blame for
obesity. Soso Whaley's experiment showed us that it's not McDonald's
food itself, it's people's habits of overeating, sodas, and not
exercising.

Do be fair, Morgan Spurlock *did* say clearly in the movie that the
reason why he didn't excercise in the movie is that, well, most people
*don't* excercise.

He also ordered single servings of everything.

I'm a fan of personal responsibility, definitely, but I do think
McDonalds' food choices were critiqued somewhat fairly in this movie.
Their portion sizes are ridiculous.

Of course, American portion sizes are out-of-whack at all restaurants
these days. I've tried to make it a rule that whenever I'm out to eat I
always leave some of what I've ordered behind (although I'll always
finish the meat).

His agenda was very clear. He ordered a particular heavily
advertised meal, and &quot;supersized it&quot; only if invited to by the
McDonald's employee. He was just doing exactly as McDonald's
promoted in their ads and in their stores.

Subway's Jared, on the other hand, made a point of ordering
lower calorie limited size sandwiches no matter what the
clerk offered him. His goal was to lose weight, not to
promote Subway.

&gt; Downsized at McDonald's ; Filmmaker Loses 18 Pounds in Debunking Fast-food
&gt; Flick
&gt; Soso Profiled in The Washington Times

&gt; Op-Eds &amp; Articles
&gt; by Soso Whaley
&gt; July 4, 2004

&gt; Marguerite Higgins, THE WASHINGTON TIMES

&gt; Soso Whaley's weight-loss plan veered from the popular low-carb diets.
She
&gt; ate fast food for two months and lost 18 pounds. Ms. Whaley, a
49-year-old
&gt; animal trainer, last week finished her diet using the menu at McDonald's
&gt; restaurants. She will highlight her two, 30-day diets in a 60- to
&gt; 90-minute documentary.

&gt; The film, scheduled for release this fall, rebuts several claims made by
&gt; Morgan Spurlock, who did the documentary &quot;Super Size Me,&quot;, Ms. Whaley
said.
&gt; His film showed his weight gain and health problems after eating only
&gt; McDonald's food for a month.

&gt;&quot;The film is not about taking potshots at Mr. Spurlock. I'm not
advocating
&gt; people boycott his movie or go eat for 30 days at McDonald's. I'm just
&gt; giving another side to the story,&quot; said Ms. Whaley, a Kensington, N.H.,
&gt; resident.

&gt; The film has no corporate sponsorship from any food or beverage company.

&gt; In &quot;Super Size Me,&quot; Mr. Spurlock ate at McDonald's restaurants for 30 days
&gt; with a 5,000-calorie limit, more than twice the 2,200 daily calories
&gt; recommended for the average man.

&gt; He &quot;super-sized&quot; his meal only when asked by the cashier in the 98-minute
&gt; film. McDonald's Corp., which called Mr. Spurlock's film &quot;irresponsible,&quot;
&gt; announced plans before the film was released in May to phase out its
&gt; super-size options by the end of the year.

&gt; A spokeswoman for Samuel Goldwyn Films, which distributed Mr. Spurlock's
&gt; film, said Mr. Spurlock was traveling and unavailable for comment.

&gt; His film has become part of a growing anti-obesity movement that has tried
&gt; to blame some of the cause of rising U.S. obesity rates on the food
&gt; industry. McDonald's and food manufacturer Kraft Foods Inc. have had
&gt; obesity-related lawsuits filed against them in the past two years.

&gt; Food companies have fought back by altering their serving sizes, promoting
&gt; healthy lifestyles and introducing more low-fat products.

&gt; Mr. Spurlock, who is 6 feet 2 inches tall, packed on 25 pounds and his
&gt; cholesterol level shot up 65 points by the end of the film.

&gt; By contrast, Ms. Whaley imposed a limit of 1,800 to 2,000 calories when
she
&gt; started her diet April 1. But her intake would increase up to 3,000
&gt; calories &quot;when I gave myself the day off,&quot; she said.

&gt; She dropped 10 pounds from her 5-foot-3-inch frame in the first month of
&gt; her experiment, slimming down to 165 from 175. Her cholesterol level fell
&gt; to 197 from 237 by the beginning of May.

&gt; Like Mr. Spurlock, Ms. Whaley said she tried every item on the menu at
&gt; least once. But she spent about an hour doing moderate exercise three
&gt; times a week.

&gt; Although she did have salads, Ms. Whaley said she stuck with sandwiches,
&gt; fries, diet sodas and shakes.

&gt;&quot;I actually had a much tougher time when I got back in the real world [in
&gt; May] because I was so used to controlled portion sizes&quot; at the burger
&gt; chain, she said.

&gt; Ms. Whaley went back on the diet in June and lost another 8 pounds,
&gt; rounding out her weight at 157. Her cholesterol level edged up to 202.

&gt; She doesn't advise the fast-food diet for everyone. &quot;I recommend more
&gt; limiting your calories instead of food choices,&quot; she said.

&gt; McDonald's spokesman Walt Riker said the Oakbrook, Ill., fast- food chain
&gt; has had no contact with Ms. Whaley other than giving her permission to
film
&gt; her documentary inside its restaurants.

&gt;&quot;We're certainly interested in seeing [Ms. Whaley's] film. It certainly
&gt; proves what we have been saying from Day One-that there is plenty of
choice
&gt; on the menu for a balanced diet,&quot; Mr. Riker said.

&gt; Ms. Whaley estimated the cost of the film to be $30,000 to $50,000. That
&gt; does not include her time spent or the staff help from the Competitive
&gt; Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank advocating free markets.

&gt; The organization gave Ms. Whaley an adjunct fellowship to work with her on
&gt; the film. The think tank may sponsor a screening of the film in the fall,
&gt; but has not contributed any money, said spokeswoman Jody Clarke.

&gt; Ms. Whaley said she plans to enter her work in several independent film
&gt; festivals.

"/> the whole thing is ridiculous. The fact is that if you eat anything out of
moderation your health is going to decline. Every visit the bakery section
at your local grocer? Those fresh-baked thick chocolate chip cookies aren't
good for ya

&gt;&gt; Cool. She eats fewer calories and exercises more and the net result is
&gt;&gt; she lost weight. What a surprise!

&gt;&gt; Would have been neat to have filmed her diet for 60 days before she did
&gt;&gt; the McD diet. But that would have been cheating.

&gt; Yeah, 1800-2000 calories is a lot for a 5'3&quot; woman who doesn't exercize
&gt; very much. But she still managed to lose weight. She must have been
&gt; eating like a pig to maintain a weight of 175.

"/> I think 175 for a 5'3&quot; woman is FAT! Heck, wait, according to the BMI
calculator, she's officially OBESE!

An ex was 5'4&quot; and weighed 160 yet she was always complaining about her
weight.

Let's stick to the simple facts - McDonald's food is *far* from
healthy. On occasions when I'd ate it I resented the fat-soaked
carboard-fries and the carcinogenically-charred meat-burgers.
