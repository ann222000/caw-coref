A welcome new festival on 28th October offers a fun and fascinating day
of activities and events.  The John Barleycorn Festival starts at
Rothbury and continues at historic settlements all along the whisky
trail of the Coquet Valley to Barrowburn in the Cheviot Hills of
Northumberland National Park.

For the first time, local communities and businesses will be treating
visitors to an exposé of Upper Coquetdale's rich cultural heritage,
particularly their ancestors' rather dodgy doings in illegal whisky
distillation and smuggling, which was carried on during the 17th and
18th Centuries in parallel with livestock reiving and to the despair of
the excise men trying to collect taxes for England's latest war.

Festival visitors can learn about the wily and colourful characters,
like Black Rory, who set up illegal stills in the remote hills and
traded their product on both sides of the border; watch the distillation
process on a historic copper still, learn about the importance of wood,
water, mash and peat; watch the firing of whisky jars; help Black Rory
get his whisky across the Border, and taste a range of single malt
whiskies.

The valley's more wholesome heritage is also celebrated in food and
craft markets, films, exhibitions, guided walks and demonstrations of
farming and time-honoured rural skills. With events taking place at
Rothbury, Thropton, Harbottle, and Barrowburn, visitors will have the
opportunity to travel by vintage buses that will ferry folk from one
venue to the next and back to Rothbury.  An early evening Malt Whisky
Tasting session will be delivered by The Malt Masterclass in Rothbury,
and the day is rounded off with a ceilidh in Harbottle featuring
traditional music and dancing.

Coquetdale's John Barleycorn Festival is the inspiration of a group of
enthusiastic local community and business representatives who are keen
to welcome visitors and to distinguish the valley's singular heritage
against a backdrop of Northumberland and Cheviot culture.

Editor's Notes:

Background to the John Barleycorn Festival
Local community and business representatives attended a wildlife tourism
seminar in the Scottish Borders in 2005, and were inspired to develop a
festival based on Upper Coquetdale's unique cultural heritage.  Rothbury
&amp; Coquetdale Business Club, alongside Rothbury &amp; Coquetdale Tourism
Association and a range of local community groups developed their ideas
early in 2006, and have been sharing ideas and planning activities, with
support from Northumberland National Park Authority, since then.

John Barleycorn is a British folksong best known in the 1782 version by
Robert Burns. The character "John Barleycorn" in the song is a
personification of the important cereal crop barley, and of the
alcoholic beverages made from it - beer and whisky. In the song, John
Barleycorn is represented as suffering attacks, death, and indignities
that correspond to the various stages such as reaping and malting.

The Malt Master Class
http://www.maltmasterclass.co.uk/

Northumberland National Park - ASPECT
ASPECT (a sustainable process for environmental and cultural tourism) is
a two -year project, funded by the European Union and ONE North East,
which aims to bring different groups of people together to work towards
the development of sustainable tourism in and around Northumberland
National Park. Farmers and landowners, conservationists, local
businesses and community groups, and recreational users have all been
encouraged to share ideas and work together, and the John Barleycorn
Festival is an excellent example of what can be achieved as a result.
