It looks like somebody set up security webcams on their house and
managed to catch a UPS truck driver &quot;delivering&quot; a package:

Hey, if I was that deliveryman and I had to navigate all that junk in
the front lawn, I would just pitch that box like that.  Hell, I'd
probably do it from the damned TRUCK!  At least he bothered getting
out and walking a bit.  :)

Driver dude's got a schedule to keep, and it's a small (and probably
light) enough box that whatever was in there wouldn't get affected by
it getting tossed around a little.

I'd fire the guy. That's outrageous.

Yah, I tend to side with the driver on this one. People shouldn't have to
climb over bushes or derelict vans to reach your porch.

Anyway, it looked kinda like an Amazon box, probably with a couple of DVDs
inside.

I have found it very useful to get to know my local UPS driver. We wave and
smile when passing on the street. Every time when he brings something and I
happen to be home, I go out to the truck and say Hi, etc.  I usually take
the box as he hands it out of the truck.

Not everyone sits at home all day, but if you have the opportunity, a little
humanity helps. They're just guys like you and me, for Pete's sake.

Security cameras? Probably has a sign saying trespassers will be shot
too.
He's lucky he got his package. The UPS drivers are under NO obligation
to
deliver at an undeliverable or hazardous location.

Now for you that just LOVE to hammer on the UPS, consider this. How
many thousand drivers and millions of packages get delivered? This is
one guy.

Ya ever notice that most UPS drivers are in the 20s or 30s? You don't
see any &quot;old guys&quot; delivering packages. There's a reason for this.
They
are all under a tremendous amount of pressure to carry a large work
load. (Just like the post office, except that UPS management isn't as
draconian.) They all have to hustle if they want to get home the same
day.

I think you have a good point. There may have been a reason why the driver

I had a couple friends that worked at a UPS 'hub' for a while,sorting

Not hardly. Having been through a couple of the main USPS hubs
in Los Angeles county, one of the first things you notice are the
enclosed catwalks with the 1-way glass mounted above the workers.

These are for managers to walk around and watch what's going on
in the work areas.

UPS is under pressure to stay competitive yet still make money. The
postal service doesn't seem to be troubled with that. They're more
like
the department of motor vehicles.

So if the USPS isn't under pressure, then why bother with watching what

And how is watching the employees from a catwalk different than putting

Most employers now monitor their employees... especially in any retail
environment or where valuable items are handled or processed. I worked for a
time for Lowes Home Improvement and I can tell you ALL employees and
customers are watched with hidden cameras. Just do anything a bit suspicious
and the store phone on the belt would ring.

NOOO,  DONT use peanuts!  Use LARGE bubble wrap!!!   everything shifts to
one side in a box of peanuts... every shipment I get has this...  any radio
will seek one side of the box ... guess what happens next...  yup,  dial
glass and grille bars are smashed out.

Its been proven many times... only LARGE bubble wrap will work... about 4 or
5 times around anything,  it will survive.   They call it 1/2&quot; wrap, as the
bubbles are 1/2&quot; high,  about the size of a half dollar around.

Peanuts are ONLY good for filling any remaining void if you want... and,
they are not even needed for that.  Those of us in the repair business CURSE
peanuts daily... because, we have to unpack large boxes full of them...and,
where do they go?  All over the shop, of course.   Those things are
worthless.

The primary problem with peanuts is that as most commonly used - they
are a fluid - and like any fluid they &quot;allow&quot; movement of other objects
within their midst - lighter objects &quot;float&quot; (which is pretty rare
considering how much peanuts weigh) - heavier object &quot;sink&quot;.  Yet used
properly - peanuts can be as effective as any other packing.

Why is bubble wrap effective? After all - it's primary cushioning
material is &quot;just air&quot;.  Imagine using &quot;just air&quot; as packing for your
favorite radio - now think about handing it to (take your pick: UPS,
USPS, FedEx, etc.).   Ouch!

It's the fact that what air there is in bubble wrap - is confined - not
allowed to &quot;flow&quot;. Further - the very design of bubble-wrap is that the
&quot;cells&quot; aren't quite full of air - allowing a bit of &quot;give&quot; before the
air compresses enough to stop whatever is running into it - distributing
any &quot;shock&quot; over a larger (conforming) surface. Loose peanuts just &quot;get
out of the way&quot; while the &quot;object&quot; meets the inner wall of the box /
container - and stops rather rudely.

So how do we apply what we know about bubble wrap to peanuts?  Get a
bunch of plastic shopping bags- the thin ones you get from Wal-Mart,
etc. are fine.  Stuff a bag about 1/2 or so full - now tie the sucker
closed. Don't try to make it air tight - you want a little &quot;give&quot;. Makes
a nice pillow.  Sit on the sucker. Compare that to sitting on loose
peanuts. Wiggle your butt on the bag - and it wallows around - but still
- it holds.  Wiggle you butt on the loose ones - and you'll find the
floor (seat, whatever) pretty fast. When packing something - use a bunch
of these bags stuffed with peanuts. With the peanuts confined - you can
even compress them some - to make a more rigid package.

Worried about tubes coming out of their sockets?  Transformers,
speakers, etc. tearing loose? Stuffing a bajillion peanuts inside a
cabinet does nothing but irritate whoever has to unpack the thing.
bubble wrap isn't much better. But stuff those peanuts in to some bags
(double bag if you're going to get real aggressive with &quot;stuffing&quot;) and
you can pack those suckers inside to the point that nothing can wiggle.
since the bags are fairly thin - they can conform to odd shapes - yet
once &quot;packed in&quot; - won't flow &quot;out of the way&quot;... the bags keep them
where they can do what they are supposed to do.

Are peanuts better than bubble wrap?  answer that question from the
inside out.  How effective can you &quot;pack&quot; the inside of a cabinet with
bubble wrap?  Yet peanuts can work about as well as &quot;foam in place&quot;
packing - which is what we're doing - only you don't have to worry about
the foam expanding and &quot;blowing out&quot; the cabinet walls - as you can
&quot;fine tune the pack&quot; as you go.

On the other hand - since bubble wrap is &quot;contiguous&quot; - if the box gets
really damaged - our peanut &quot;containers&quot; (bags) might be compromised as
well - while bubble wrap might suffer a local &quot;hit&quot; but still stay in
place. So it's very effective as an &quot;outer wrap&quot;.  Of course double
boxing helps in all instances... I often will use peanut bags in an
inner box - wrap the inner box in a couple layers of bubble wrap into
the outer box.

I've shipped a lot of stuff using peanuts in bags - so far - no damage.
Most recent was a very old, VERY fragile glass (kerosene) lamp... with
chimney. Made in fine packed in peanuts...

I saw that earlier today and was surprised (well, a little...). It always
seemed to me that the majority of abuse a package had to sustain was in the
package handling centers.

In any event, I'd like to see that trick pulled with either of the 40+ pound
iMac computer systems I shipped recently. Something tells me the UPS driver
might go along with those boxes!

Seriously though, I did get to know the UPS driver in this area pretty
well--I even made the effort to be around to wish him the best of luck on
his last day. I haven't yet managed to catch his replacement at the door to
introduce myself, but my packages are still coming along without any undue
damage.

Randy,
your method is a good way to improve the performance of peanuts if you have
them... but it still wont match the overall performance of large bubble
wrap.   You mention being able to fill voids better with your bagged
peanuts, but bubble wrap will do that too in smaller slices, and not
puncture a speaker cone the way peanuts could.
You have done well with your method, I suppose it can work, but large bubble
wrap trumps all methods.

A large roll (24&quot; wide x what.. I dont know how long but its a 3' diameter
roll) of it is about $55-65.  It comes pre-perffed at 12&quot; intervals for easy
tear offs.  I shipped a lot of ebay sales in 2004-2007, that stuff never
failed and its so much faster, neater and easier to use.

&gt;&gt; NOOO,  DONT use peanuts!

&gt; The primary problem with peanuts is that as most commonly used - they are
&gt; a fluid - and like any fluid they &quot;allow&quot; movement of other objects within
&gt; their midst - lighter objects &quot;float&quot; (which is pretty rare considering
&gt; how much peanuts weigh) - heavier object &quot;sink&quot;.  Yet used properly -
&gt; peanuts can be as effective as any other packing.

&gt; Why is bubble wrap effective? After all - it's primary cushioning material
&gt; is &quot;just air&quot;.  Imagine using &quot;just air&quot; as packing for your favorite
&gt; radio - now think about handing it to (take your pick: UPS, USPS, FedEx,
&gt; etc.).   Ouch!

&gt; It's the fact that what air there is in bubble wrap - is confined - not
&gt; allowed to &quot;flow&quot;. Further - the very design of bubble-wrap is that the
&gt; &quot;cells&quot; aren't quite full of air - allowing a bit of &quot;give&quot; before the air
&gt; compresses enough to stop whatever is running into it - distributing any
&gt; &quot;shock&quot; over a larger (conforming) surface. Loose peanuts just &quot;get out of
&gt; the way&quot; while the &quot;object&quot; meets the inner wall of the box / container -
&gt; and stops rather rudely.

&gt; So how do we apply what we know about bubble wrap to peanuts?  Get a bunch
&gt; of plastic shopping bags- the thin ones you get from Wal-Mart, etc. are
&gt; fine.  Stuff a bag about 1/2 or so full - now tie the sucker closed. Don't
&gt; try to make it air tight - you want a little &quot;give&quot;. Makes a nice pillow.
&gt; Sit on the sucker. Compare that to sitting on loose peanuts. Wiggle your
&gt; butt on the bag - and it wallows around - but still - it holds.  Wiggle
&gt; you butt on the loose ones - and you'll find the floor (seat, whatever)
&gt; pretty fast. When packing something - use a bunch of these bags stuffed
&gt; with peanuts. With the peanuts confined - you can even compress them
&gt; some - to make a more rigid package.

&gt; Worried about tubes coming out of their sockets?  Transformers, speakers,
&gt; etc. tearing loose? Stuffing a bajillion peanuts inside a cabinet does
&gt; nothing but irritate whoever has to unpack the thing. bubble wrap isn't
&gt; much better. But stuff those peanuts in to some bags (double bag if you're
&gt; going to get real aggressive with &quot;stuffing&quot;) and you can pack those
&gt; suckers inside to the point that nothing can wiggle. since the bags are
&gt; fairly thin - they can conform to odd shapes - yet once &quot;packed in&quot; -
&gt; won't flow &quot;out of the way&quot;... the bags keep them where they can do what
&gt; they are supposed to do.

&gt; Are peanuts better than bubble wrap?  answer that question from the inside
&gt; out.  How effective can you &quot;pack&quot; the inside of a cabinet with bubble
&gt; wrap?  Yet peanuts can work about as well as &quot;foam in place&quot; packing -
&gt; which is what we're doing - only you don't have to worry about the foam
&gt; expanding and &quot;blowing out&quot; the cabinet walls - as you can &quot;fine tune the
&gt; pack&quot; as you go.

&gt; On the other hand - since bubble wrap is &quot;contiguous&quot; - if the box gets
&gt; really damaged - our peanut &quot;containers&quot; (bags) might be compromised as
&gt; well - while bubble wrap might suffer a local &quot;hit&quot; but still stay in
&gt; place. So it's very effective as an &quot;outer wrap&quot;.  Of course double boxing
&gt; helps in all instances... I often will use peanut bags in an inner box -
&gt; wrap the inner box in a couple layers of bubble wrap into the outer box.

&gt; I've shipped a lot of stuff using peanuts in bags - so far - no damage.
&gt; Most recent was a very old, VERY fragile glass (kerosene) lamp... with
&gt; chimney. Made in fine packed in peanuts...

Obviously you like buying and using lots of bubble wrap.

My point was - and is - that there is a way to use such a &quot;free&quot;
resource and get very good results. Sure - if I had to buy packing
material -  I'd buy bubble wrap.  But when I have several 30 gallon
trash bags full of peanuts (for free)... and there is a way to use them
with good results - I'm going to use peanuts...  rather than spend extra
for bubble wrap.

Cruise my ebay feedback as seller...   one &quot;theme&quot; is repeated over and
over - and that's packing...   there must be something to it...

Like all things YMMV...

wadded newspaper is OK for some things too, but I will never trust it for
anything other than taking up space in a box (which can strengthen the box).

It has little cushioning effect, and, like peanuts, items will migrate thru
it to the side of the box.

Note to Randy...  what you are doing is fine,  I just want everyone to know
it has limitations and is not as good as large bubble wrap.

I too, have spotless feedback, and many of my comments are about the
excellent packing.

Phil,
I would like to respectfully disagree. I worked for UPS (a subsidiary) and
I can tell you from my experience that the Louisville (headquarters)
management teams are a very very evil (and I don't use the term lightly)
people.
and I think that it  flows down to the drivers to some extent also....

Wadded paper can be quite effective for certain types of items. In fact,
there is a commercially available wadded paper product designed
specifically for shipping. Wouldn't use it for heavy objects, though.

I ship a lot of heavy objects (i.e. heavy as your average 1930s tube
radio) both personally and professionally, and I have had more
experience than I would like to have had with shipping and UPS. Based on
my own experiences here is my analysis of the effectiveness of shipping
materials, in descending order:

1. Custom cut foam rubber-The cadillac of packing materials. Never a
problem ever. At least two inches of thickness surrounding the entire
item to be shipped and it will make it to its final destination unless
the package has been treated truly outrageously by the shipper. Alas, it
is expensive and fewer and fewer vendors seem to be using it these days
for shipping, so there is less and less than can be re-used by the likes
of us for shipping radios. (BTW, most cheap old &quot;firm&quot; mattresses are
full of the stuff, so if a neighbor is throwing one out you might want
to check it out before the trashman gets it)

2. Spray-foam &quot;pillows&quot;. This seems to be the material of choice for
vendors who ship a lot of odd shaped items. In its unused form it is
liquid and very compact, making it attractive for use in areas where
commercial real estate leases at a premium. Basicially what happens is
the item is wrapped in sheets of plastic and placed in the center of a
box with a bottom that has already been foamed. The liquid, which comes
out of a pressurized dispensing tank as a rapidly expanding foam, is
then poured all over the wrapped item, thus enveloping it in foam which
expands and firms up rapidly, making a nearly perfect foam cushion
contoured to the shape of the item. An alternative method is fill
plastic bags full of foam to make foam pillows, and use those for
shipping. I have had good results re-using this for shipping items, it
seems to have a level of protection almost as good as that of foam rubber.

3. Bubble wrap-extremely versatile-several layers wrapped completely
around an object will do nicely to protect it from the ravages of UPS.
Not for extremely heavy objects, or those with very sharp edges. Kids
love popping this stuff by squeezing and stomping on it, but keep it out
of the hands of toddlers for obvious reasons.

4. Wadded paper-not my first choice, but adequate for many light-to
moderate weight items

5. Packing peanuts-THE WORST. IMHO, people who use them to ship stuff
are really showing a lack of respect to their fellow man. They do not
work at all well for heavy objects, and only work marginally well for
those things of modest size and weight. In order to understand why, one
only needs to open a new box of breakfast cereal and look inside. See
all the space at the top with no cereal? When the box left the factory,
it was full or nearly so. The cereal at the top didn't vanish, it
settled due to vibration and other movement of whatever form of
conveyance it was placed on. The same thing WILL happen to peanuts if
you use them for packing. When that happens, your item will move around
in the box until it can't move anymore because it hits the bottom, top
or sides of the box. At this point the item is just about as naked to
the ravages of UPS as if there were no packing at all-not good. Bagging
them up is no good either, because the same thing happens no matter
what. In addition, the peanuts are extremely annoying to deal with when
the unboxing at the final destination is done. I have gone so far as to
take a received package directly to the landfill before cracking it open
so I don't have to deal with them in my house. Last but not least, many
types of these are environmentally insensitive, and if buried will
still be around 100 years from now. Why use them when there are better
materials out there for packing stuff?

With regards to UPS, I have entirely ceased using them for personal
shipping of anything even remotely fragile or valuable (haven't used
them in over 2 years). What's particularly galling is that they have the
nerve to tack on an enormous &quot;dimensional weight&quot; charge for oversize
packages when it is their rough handling of the parcels that
necessitates the requirement for such a huge padded box in the first place!

Jeff, let's get real here:

When people give their stuff to UPS to ship they aren't just expecting
it to get there, they are expecting it to get there IN ONE PIECE!

The UPS driver depicted in the YouTube video made a very leisurely
underhanded toss of that parcel. How far could it have gone? Twenty feet
perhaps? If the &quot;one piece&quot; expectation is reasonable (and it damn well
is, or why would anyone use UPS to ship anything?) then the driver is
not behaving reasonably, schedule or no schedule. How much longer could
it have possibly taken him to do it right?

BTW, there's a shipper the company I work for uses for heavier and
larger parcels called BAX Global. We have received quite a number of
shipments from them over the years, and I never cease to marvel at the
condition of the items we receive from them. Giant parcels shipped
cross-country arrive looking like they never left the factory; they
always arrive in nearly flawless condition. I'm not sure about the cost,
but it does show that it is possible to ship a difficult to handle
package without it arriving looking like a pack of wild gorillas used it
for martial-arts practice.

Wadded paper absorbs energy as it crushes, which can be useful for
packing heavy items.  The shipping department where I work has a
machine that takes kraft paper from a roll and forms it into a pad.

Scott, I don't see foamboard on your list--not the white stuff that
leaves infuriating crumbs sticking everywhere; the builders' rigid
pink insulating boards. Whenever I've shipped something heavy (like a
Hammarlund SP-600) or somewhat less heavy but still no lightweight and
definitely worth loving care (an HQ-215), I buy the foamboard in
various thicknesses and create a snug fit all around the item in one
box, then put that box in another box and stuff the gap with large-
bubble bubble wrap.

Kind of like the stuff Digikey ships with?  I always thought it
was neat stuff, and I'd imagine eco-friendly.

For packing in general, however, I'm with Mark.  Grab a big roll
of bubblewrap, womp-womp-womp-womp as you roll &lt;whatever&gt; up in four
or five layers, and you're done in under sixty seconds with making
an engineering project out of it.

&gt;&gt; BTW, there's a shipper the company I work for uses for heavier and
&gt;&gt; larger parcels called BAX Global. We have received quite a number of
&gt;&gt; shipments from them over the years, and I never cease to marvel at the
&gt;&gt; condition of the items we receive from them. Giant parcels shipped
&gt;&gt; cross-country arrive looking like they never left the factory; they
&gt;&gt; always arrive in nearly flawless condition. I'm not sure about the cost,
&gt;&gt; but it does show that it is possible to ship a difficult to handle
&gt;&gt; package without it arriving looking like a pack of wild gorillas used it
&gt;&gt; for martial-arts practice.

&gt;    We use them for 1000lb.+ pieces of equipment.  They are Not Cheap.

Almost anything that weighs half a ton would not be cheap to ship.
