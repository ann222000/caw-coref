On another thread http://www.gatago.org/uk/railway/38768669-1.html it
says

If pedantry were to be invoked, the CTRL (and ocassionally a small
part of WCML) is 25kV but fed from autotransformer (25kV - 0 - 25kV).
These are the only two areas on the UK configured that way. It is
supposed to improve feeding arrangements and reduce induced noise. It
can normally be recognised beacuse the return feeder (previously at a
few 100 volts) is now at 25kV and is separately insulated.

How does this work? The return feeder is the running rail, surely.

So where is the return side of the circuit if not in one of the running
rails? There aren't two overhead lines with two pantographs, so the return
*must* be via a running rail. As you say, that rail should be at (or close
to) earth potential for safety reasons, otherwise OHLE is no safer than
third rail. Even &quot;a few 100 volts&quot; sounds alarmingly high.

On a normal (ie not auto-transformer) system, the return does run via
the running rails, but not all the way to the substation.  The running
rails are not very good conductors for this purpose, and are bonded to a
proper return conductor at intervals.  The difference with an
auto-transformer system is that, on a regular system, this return runs
all the way to the substation, on an auto transformer system, this
return current is transformed from nearly 0 V to -25 kV to give a
potential difference between the supply and return of 50 kV.  It makes
my head hurt if I try to think about it too hard, so I try not to, but
it's a nice piece of electrickery that makes for a more efficient
transmission system.  Give me a nice piece of mechanical engineering,
hell even fluid mechanics, any day over electricity.

Not quite right, the power distribution is 25kV-0V-25kV to the
autotransformer primary, so that all the insulation is still that for 25kV,
although there is 50kV between the two supply lines.  There was a good
thread about it a couple of years back, including the necessary ASCII

I'm still not sure I understand. In the second diagram you have +25 kV
between the pantograph wire and 0V (the rail?). Fine.

But then there's another connection between -25 kV and 0V with the other
half of the load. The wire carrying that -25 kV (ie 25 kV AC opposite phase)
is the &quot;return wire&quot; that's been referred to, but... where is the connection
between that wire and the train to drive the other half of the load?

As far as the train is concerned it's still running on a normal 25kV wrt OV
rail.  Think of your house - it runs off 1 phase of a 3 phase supply, your
neighbours are (balanced) on other phases. Sections of OHLE are running off
1 phase of a two phase supply, where 1 phase is the catenary, the other is
on the back of the masts. After successive neutral sections, things swap
round.

An autotransformer doesn't have two electrically seperate windings like a
conventional transformer - and in this mode they aren't 1:1 they're 2:1 step
down.

I'm still none the wiser. In Fig 3, the train is connected between the
positive line and the rail. The rail is earthed so it's at 0V or pretty
close - for safety reasons, it *must* be close to earth potential, otherwise
it's as dangerous as third-rail. There's no connection between the negative
line and the train. So what's the advantage over the single feed shown in
Fig 2? In both cases, the train sees a PD of 25 kV AC.

Also, given that there's no electrical connection between the primary and

OK, the feed transformer (with coils shown horizontally) from the
distribution network does look like a centre tapped isolating transformer,
however, the autotransformers referred to in this thread are those spaced
out along the line (with coils shown vertically in that diagram).

Fig. 3 on &lt; http://www.irfca.org/docs/traction-schematics.html &gt; is similar,

The autotransformer doesn't have primary and secondary windings, it has one
winding with a tap, held at approximately 'zero'. Its not the way an
autotransformer is usually found, which usually like the wiki explanation:

That was explained in the second half of my previous post - I reiterate, an
Autotransformer works with a tap on a single coil, and in the general case,
less than the whole coil (half in this case) is connected to the load.  I've
always just acceped it, not being into the maths of it...

The feed transformer doesn't just 'look like' a centre-tapped isolating
transformer - it is one.
But the purpose of the autotransformers is becoming clear to me.  The
description given in the para 3 of the Introduction to
&lt; http://www.iit.upcomillas.es/docs/03EPF02.pdf &gt;  is pretty poor, but
&lt; http://www.irfca.org/docs/traction-schematics.html &gt; is much clearer.
It's clever the way the autotransformers cause the traction current in all
cells beyond that in which the train is in,  to spilt equally between the
+25kV and-25kV conductors and so halve the I^2R losses..
Whoever thought that scheme up deserves some decognition. Who was it ?

Having read this thread a bit into its development, I thought it might
be useful to repeat a little of a posting I made back in early 2006 on
this subject, which Paul Scott kindly pointed to in an earlier post:

As others have mentioned in this thread, the system works by feeding
25kV onto the catenary system and 25kV at 180 degrees out of phase
with
that fed to the catenary (often referred to as the AT feeder) to a
parallel feeder which takes the place of the return conductor. This
is
supported on the rear face of the masts on 25kV insulators

At 10km or so intervals the two 25kV feeds (which develop 50kV
between
them) are fed into autotransformers which have their centre tap
connected to the running rails and earth.

This means that both the 25kV feed and -25kV feeder only have to be
insulated to earth at the 25kV level. 50kV can only be experienced
between them. The purpose of the autotransfromers is several fold:

1. They improve the voltage profile along the line as they are
voltage
driven devices and thus have no longitudinal voltage drop, rather
than
current driven devices (which Booster Transformers are)

2. They distribute the currents such that between ATs, the currents
in
the 25kV feed and -25kV feeder flow in opposite directions (as a
result of the 180 degree phase shift)
which largely cancels out extraneous magnetic fields and minimises
induced
voltages on lineside and external cables. This doesn't apply between
the feeder station and the first AT. On WC auto transformers have been
added to the
feeder stations to overcome this problem, although this is not the
practice on the
CTRL or French systems

The AT system allows a system designer to:

A. Increase the amount of power that can be drawn from the system
providing that the original feeder station spacings are kept.

B. You can double the distance between feeder stations providing the
load doesn't increase - this was advocated for the northern end of
the
ECML when a comprehansive upgrade of the route was being considered

Or

C. You can trade off the above two to do a bit of both, ie increased
spacings and more power.

To answer Jim's question: the AT feeding system was first used in the
US where they had a system operating at +20kV - 0  -20kV as well as a
rather bizarre 3:1 ratio system where the catenary operated at 25kV
and the AT feeder at -75kV on the NE corridor (I think?).
Unsurprisingly this system fell out of favour - although electrically
it was very efficient, the problem of imbalanced currents inducing
noise onto telecomms circuits was high (surprise surprise!).

The AT system was then further developed by SNCF and Japanese railways
in parallel - the French for the first of the LGV lines and the
Japanese for the second series of the Shinkansen lines (about 1978 -
1980) According to my colleagues in SNCF they shared a lot of
information between them but the Japanese also incorporated a number
of American features in their design (remember that half of Japan uses
60Hz (the American standard) whilst the remainder uses 50Hz becuase of
its early European influence).

The French design has remained largely static from a principles point
of view whereas CTRL built on it and introduced static VAr
compensators to improve the power factor, reduce harmonics and
compensate for the reactive load.

The West Coast main line scheme is unique and state of the art in many
respects. It was the first time a conversion from classic to AT
feeeding was attempted on anything other than a branch line, it is a 4
track mixed traffic railway and thus the detailed design of the
installations is very different from LGV / CTRL practice. An example
is that if a fault develops on a LGV type line the whole section from
feeder station to mid point track sectioning AT station trips on both
lines and the non faulted lines reclosed. If that were to be adopted
on WCML, the amount of delays on a heavily trafficked four track line
would be unacceptable. Also because of the very heavy loads on WCML,
ATs are installed at the feeder stations to ensure that the currents
are highly balanced in the first section from the feeder station to
the first AT station, thus minimising induced voltages on telecomms
lines.

Apart from japan, USA, france and the UK,  AT schemes are also in
service in New Zealand (a 1980's scheme, whose Bo-Bo-Bo locos built by
Brush were essentially the precursors to the class 89 - OT, but
interesting) , Belgium, Netherlands, Hungary and Sweden. I believe
that the next diretissima in Italy will also be AT fed.

In short if you are electrifying either a very heavily trafficked line
or a high speed one OR your HV supplies to feeder stations are widely
spaced, then AT electrification is the only realistic proposition. It
doesn't make financial sense for the vast majority of lines in the UK,
although it has been proposed to convert parts of the ECML to AT
feeding at various times because of the relatively weak 132kV
distribution system owned by the electricity industry, which in turn
feeds the railway via 132kV to 25kV traction transformers at the
feeder stations.

&gt; which largely cancels out extraneous magnetic fields and minimises
&gt; induced
&gt; voltages on lineside and external cables. This doesn't apply between
&gt; the feeder station and the first AT. On WC auto transformers have been
&gt; added to the
&gt; feeder stations to overcome this problem, although this is not the
&gt; practice on the
&gt; CTRL or French systems

&gt; The AT system allows a system designer to:

&gt; A. Increase the amount of power that can be drawn from the system
&gt; providing that the original feeder station spacings are kept.

&gt; B. You can double the distance between feeder stations providing the
&gt; load doesn't increase - this was advocated for the northern end of
&gt; the
&gt; ECML when a comprehansive upgrade of the route was being considered

&gt; Or

&gt; C. You can trade off the above two to do a bit of both, ie increased
&gt; spacings and more power.

&gt; To answer Jim's question: the AT feeding system was first used in the
&gt; US where they had a system operating at +20kV - 0  -20kV as well as a
&gt; rather bizarre 3:1 ratio system where the catenary operated at 25kV
&gt; and the AT feeder at -75kV on the NE corridor (I think?).
&gt; Unsurprisingly this system fell out of favour - although electrically
&gt; it was very efficient, the problem of imbalanced currents inducing
&gt; noise onto telecomms circuits was high (surprise surprise!).

&gt; The AT system was then further developed by SNCF and Japanese railways
&gt; in parallel - the French for the first of the LGV lines and the
&gt; Japanese for the second series of the Shinkansen lines (about 1978 -
&gt; 1980) According to my colleagues in SNCF they shared a lot of
&gt; information between them but the Japanese also incorporated a number
&gt; of American features in their design (remember that half of Japan uses
&gt; 60Hz (the American standard) whilst the remainder uses 50Hz becuase of
&gt; its early European influence).

&gt; The French design has remained largely static from a principles point
&gt; of view whereas CTRL built on it and introduced static VAr
&gt; compensators to improve the power factor, reduce harmonics and
&gt; compensate for the reactive load.

&gt; The West Coast main line scheme is unique and state of the art in many
&gt; respects. It was the first time a conversion from classic to AT
&gt; feeeding was attempted on anything other than a branch line, it is a 4
&gt; track mixed traffic railway and thus the detailed design of the
&gt; installations is very different from LGV / CTRL practice. An example
&gt; is that if a fault develops on a LGV type line the whole section from
&gt; feeder station to mid point track sectioning AT station trips on both
&gt; lines and the non faulted lines reclosed. If that were to be adopted
&gt; on WCML, the amount of delays on a heavily trafficked four track line
&gt; would be unacceptable. Also because of the very heavy loads on WCML,
&gt; ATs are installed at the feeder stations to ensure that the currents
&gt; are highly balanced in the first section from the feeder station to
&gt; the first AT station, thus minimising induced voltages on telecomms
&gt; lines.

&gt; Apart from japan, USA, france and the UK,  AT schemes are also in
&gt; service in New Zealand (a 1980's scheme, whose Bo-Bo-Bo locos built by
&gt; Brush were essentially the precursors to the class 89 - OT, but
&gt; interesting) , Belgium, Netherlands, Hungary and Sweden. I believe
&gt; that the next diretissima in Italy will also be AT fed.

&gt; In short if you are electrifying either a very heavily trafficked line
&gt; or a high speed one OR your HV supplies to feeder stations are widely
&gt; spaced, then AT electrification is the only realistic proposition. It
&gt; doesn't make financial sense for the vast majority of lines in the UK,
&gt; although it has been proposed to convert parts of the ECML to AT
&gt; feeding at various times because of the relatively weak 132kV
&gt; distribution system owned by the electricity industry, which in turn
&gt; feeds the railway via 132kV to 25kV traction transformers at the
&gt; feeder stations.

There are now only two classic 50 kV systems in the world: The OREX route
in South Africa, and the Black Mesa and Lake Powell Railroad, which is an
isolated coal hauler in the state of Arizona in the USA. It hauls coal
about 80 miles to a coal-fired generating station, and is owned by the
electrical generating company. It is probably the one you saw on the
telly.

There was one other railway in the world that was electrified with 50kV,
and that was a short portion of the British Columbia Railway that was
built into some coal fields in Canada.  The original justification was
that there were a number of long tunnels on the route, and the cost of
tunnel ventilation, supposedly needed for diesel-electric operation, was
higher than the cost of electrification.  Further, electricity in the
province is mostly hydroelectric, with some of the lowest rates in the
world, adding to the favourable economics for electrification. Not to
mention that the electrical power utility in British Columbia is owned by
the government of the province, as was the railway, so politics certainly
entered into the decision to electrify.

As the operation evolved, coal traffic dropped off at the end of the
first contract period.  The electrification system was removed to save
money, and the locomotives were scrapped.  Since then, traffic has
increased again, but the trains are now satisfactorily hauled by diesel-
electric locomotives, and the tunnels are not force-ventilated.

I don't think it is as much lack of understanding as lack of visibility,
therefore less interest.  Since there are few electrified routes in the
country, US railfans simply don't see the systems regularly.

Those two latter railways are electrified with traditional 25kV systems.
Both railways still operate, with the Navajo Mine Railroad serving the
Four Corners Generating station in Arizona.

You might be thinking of the British Columbia Railway, which abandoned
their electrification about 10 years ago, or the Mojave Generating
station near Laughlin, Nevada, which received coal from the Black Mesa
mines, but by slurry pipeline, and not by rail.  That power plant was
shut down about two years ago because of poor coal quality and questions
about stack emissions.

There can be confusion about names, since the Black Mesa and Lake Powell
Railroad serves the Navajo generating station, the Navajo Railroad serves
the Four Corners Generating Station, and the now-closed Mojave Generating
Station received coal from the Black Mesa mines (but not by rail).

There are also a couple of short 25kV lines that are owned by Texas
utilities, serving their Martin Lake and Monticello Generating stations.
Like the others, they use similar GE locomotives, and they haul coal to
their generating stations from coal mines.

For completeness, there is also a short electrified line at an iron ore
mine in Labrador City in Canada that uses motor-generator locomotives,
and an old interurban line in the state of Iowa.

That just about sums up the electrified railways in the US, Mexico, and
Canada, other than the Northeast Corridor in the US, and the Montreal
commuter electrification in Canada. I'm ignoring electrified lines in
underground mines.

This is a bit off-topic, but there might be a lesson in overconfidence.

The Black Mesa and Lake Powell railroad has 50kV electrification, and is
an isolated rail line that was built to haul coal about 80 miles from a
mining area to a power plant.  It is owned by the power generating
company.

The line was built in the early 1970s by a civil engineering contractor,
that proudly proclaimed that they had broken the mould normally used for
railway construction, and had three innovations that would make the
railway the best, most productive, and lowest cost in the world:

- They used 50kV electrification, the first of its kind in the world,
which meant they only needed one substation to end-feed the line from the
generating station.
- It was the first wide-scale installation of Portland cement concrete
sleepers in the US
- The use of concrete sleepers allowed them to increase the maximum
weight of wagons to 315,000 lb, which was above the usual limit of
263,000 lb. then allowed on the major railways in North America.

After a few years, there was a major derailment, where they lost a
significant number of wagons due to derailment damage, plus the loss of
the line for the repair period when they couldn't move coal.

It was determined that there was a design flaw in the sleepers which
allowed them to lose gauge-holding, resulting in a wide-gauge derailment
in a curve.  The utility company, now shy about being an innovator,
decided to replace all of the concrete sleepers in curves with wooden
sleepers.

Also as a result of the derailment and observed maintenance problems, the
owners also decided to lower the maximum weights of the wagons to a
maximum of 263,000 lb. by light-loading the wagons.  Thus, they lost the
operating advantage they had purchased at extra cost with the higher-
capacity wagons.

Finally, the 50kV electrification was giving them problems.  It's been a
few years since I read the article, so I might have the details wrong,
but as I remember the story, the locomotives were creating a substantial
amount of electrical noise in the overhead, which was reflecting off the
far end of the line and bouncing back to confuse the control systems on
the locomotives. As a result, they had to add what they called a filter
substation at the opposite end of the line from the main substation to
control the noise.

While the world often evolves as people and companies innovate and take
risks, it doesn't mean that they will always be successful.

Today, the railway is a fairly routine operation with standard-weight
wagons carried above wooden sleepers, with 50kV overhead and locomotives.

Err yes and no to my confusion.

I was mis-led by info on some wen pages when I researched these lines
to answer here did state that Navajo Railroad had shut down operations
- this was countered (and exactly as you have written) in subsequent
comments that I continued to read - and overlooked coming back in here
to correct.

TY for doing it.

I almost forgot:  They also installed a system for automatic train

trains what speed to operate at, when to sound their horns to warn users
of level crossings, and when to be prepared to stop.  It was fairly
advanced at the time, but would be considered rudimentary today.

They had intended to use an &quot;attendant&quot; to ride the locomotive, rather
than two fully-qualified drivers, which would save them labour cost.

The rail line has a 1 in 50 downhill grade leading the last few miles
into the power generating station.  Normal train handling with direct-
release brakes would dictate that the driver set a brake application to
approximately balance the speed of the train against the pull of gravity,
and not release the brakes until the train reached the bottom of the
grade.

The automatic control system had a weakness in that it couldn't dictate
how the train was to be controlled, so if the brakes were applied a bit
too much, slowing the train below its target speed, rather than using the
power of the locomotives to pull against the excess brakes on the
downgrade, which would be the normal train handling procedure, the system
would release the brakes to regain speed.  That is the very last thing a
driver would want to see, as the train would start to take off like a
bullet, heading directly to the power plant with rapidly increasing
speed.

There were a few early attempts at getting the system to work, but they
soon shut it off, and never used it again.

Isn't there one out there that uses HV trolley dump trucks i.e. rubber
typed ones ?

Anyway this is an interesting site on Chile electrics

It even inclides the unbuilt Cartagena - the loks were bombed out in

Yes, you are correct.  The old Illinois Central line south of the city,
plus the connecting Chicago, South Shore and South Bend line into Indiana,
which was an old interurban line. Both use 1500 VDC overhead.

In my own mind, I include the Long Island as part of the general
electrification along the Northeast Corridor, like the electrified branches
around Philadelphia.

Hmmm, strange vehicles indeed.  Though since they use &quot;a scaled-up version
of the railway type of pantograph&quot;, I was disappointed that the Sishen
OHLE dumper trucks didn't also work at 50kV AC :-)

I was going to make some point about it being on a different system - DC
third rail, but then the NEC overhead runs on  at least 2, (or is it 3,
are there still 25 Hz bits?), systems, so that may not be valid.

What about the ex-New York Central out of Garnd Central Terminal along the
water level main line as far as Croton-Harmon and its various branches
operated by Metro North Central Rail Road.  Third rail syetme used but can't
remember the voltage.

They also operate out of Grand Central along the New Haven line with a
traction system change to overhead at Pelham.

The outer reaches are the LIRR are not electrified and they have both
straight diesel and electro-diesel units to cope with this.

&gt; The line was built in the early 1970s by a civil engineering contractor,
&gt; that proudly proclaimed that they had broken the mould normally used for
&gt; railway construction, and had three innovations that would make the
&gt; railway the best, most productive, and lowest cost in the world:

&gt; - They used 50kV electrification, the first of its kind in the world,
&gt; which meant they only needed one substation to end-feed the line from the
&gt; generating station.
&gt; - It was the first wide-scale installation of Portland cement concrete
&gt; sleepers in the US
">

Nice for Portland cement, but why innovation? Concrete sleepers were
standard products in the 1950s.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - The use of concrete sleepers allowed them to increase the maximum
&gt; weight of wagons to 315,000 lb, which was above the usual limit of
&gt; 263,000 lb. then allowed on the major railways in North America.
">

In 1952, Rheinbraun started building for 128t (282,192 lb), which was
improved to 140t (308,647 lb) later. So the innovation has been, that
they needed only 20 years after first applications to understand, that
concrete sleepers can be used for higher axleloads?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It was determined that there was a design flaw in the sleepers which
&gt; allowed them to lose gauge-holding, resulting in a wide-gauge derailment
&gt; in a curve.
">

Okay, okay, their innovation has been, to buy the material from an
incompetent manufacturer.     ;-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also as a result of the derailment and observed maintenance problems, the
&gt; owners also decided to lower the maximum weights of the wagons to a
&gt; maximum of 263,000 lb. by light-loading the wagons.
">

Adding the innovation of going back to the 1940s, instead of buying
better quality products.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; While the world often evolves as people and companies innovate and take
&gt; risks, it doesn't mean that they will always be successful.

If I innovate, and buy a color TV, but a bad one, then go back to black
and white, there is probably nobody going to write about it with such
sympathy.     ;-)
