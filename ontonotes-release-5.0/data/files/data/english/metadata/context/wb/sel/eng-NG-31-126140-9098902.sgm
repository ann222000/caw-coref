This excerpt on the Ramones, is the first of several I have from this book,
published in 1990 (rev. ed. 1993, which is the edition I have). The author
is Joe Carducci, who was a honcho at SST records.

At 500+ pages the book is something of a rambling mess, but it's chock full
of unusual ideas, strong opinions, and discussions of bands otherwise
covered only in fanzines.

Black Sabbath and Black Flag are the ultimate bands for Carducci, and he
plays on the well-known &quot;fact&quot; that rock critics, except for Bangs, hated
Black Sabbath throughout the 70s.

[pp. 160-162]
But the Ramones were real -- as close to guileless white trash as NYC will
likely ever produce. The parody seen by critics -- Jewish and otherwise --
and some among their audience was in fact read into their work by the
cynical and the pretentious. They looked at the Ramones and saw the
Dictators wed to some sourceless Shaggs-like minimalism. Tommy Ramone
described their earliest days to Charles Young: &quot;We developed a small
following of weirdos. Then we got the intellectuals. Now the kids are
coming.&quot; (Rolling Stone, pg. 19, 8.12.1976). The implication is of course
that it was &quot;the kids&quot; all along they were after. They also described
themselves as twelve year old intellectuals that never grew up. Underneath
the NYC mannerisms the wise-ass adolescentalia of their approach transcended
ethnogeography. The band's faith was in the music and the idea that there
must be other kids (or &quot;kids&quot;) out there who'd dig it. Unfortunately,
radio's blockade forced those kids to find the music via word-of-mouth. For
their part the critics O.D.ed on the semiography of schmuck rock. They
perhaps imagined themselves up there on stage in Joey's place in ways that
they never had before with Presley or Plant (or even Dylan or Bloom). [my
best guess is that he means Eric Bloom, lead singer of Blue Oyster Cult]

Bad press may be better than no press and so perhaps the Ramones were lucky
that critics felt them too good a joke on American culture to pass up the
chance at being a sponsor of its telling. It must have struck them as an art
rock surfacing of the ethos of ridicule (Philip Glass, Andy Kaufman,
Firesign Theatre, Paul Morissey) -- which is several miles past the ethos of
simple parody -- when in fact the Ramones were in essence (music!) the
opposite. Their music is what made them important. It's the context that
made their song lyrics particularly effective. But by the mid-seventies when
the Ramones appeared the critics had long since lost touch with rock music.
They had essentially written off all hard rock from 1970 on. The Ramones'
music was not at all what they were responding to. Rolling Stone (Paul
Nelson) simply admitted its inability to interpret the musical phenomenon by
borrowing wholesale from film criticism:

[beginning of Carducci's quote from Rolling Stone]
&quot;If today's Rolling Stone were the Cahiers du Cinema of the late fifties, a
band of outsiders as deliberately crude and basic as the Ramones would be
granted instant auteur status as fast as one could say 'Edgar G. Ulmer.'
Their musique maudite -- 14 rock&amp; roll songs exploding like time bombs in
the space of 29 breathless minutes and produced on a Republic-Monogram
budget of $6400 would be compared with the mise en scene of, say, Robert
Aldrich's 'Kiss Me Deadly' or, better yet, Samuel Fuller's delirious
'Underworld U.S.A.'

&quot;And such comparisons would not be specious. The next paragraph is an almost
literal transcription of something the American auteurist, Andrew Sarris,
wrote about Fuller....

&quot;The Ramones are authentic American primitives whose work has to be heard to
be understood. Heard, not read about, or synopsized. Their first album,
&quot;Ramones,&quot; is constructed almost entirely of rhythm tracks of an
exhilarating intensity rock &amp; roll has not experienced since its earliest
days. The Ramones' lyrics are so compressed that there is no room for even
one establishing atmosphere verse or one dramatically irrelevant guitar solo
in which the musicians could suggest an everyday existence... The Ramones'
ideas are undoubtedly too broad and oversimplified for any serious analysis,
but it is the artistic force with which their ideas are expressed that makes
their music so fascinating to critics who can rise above their aesthetic
prejudices... The Ramones' perversity and peculiarly Old Testament view of
retribution carry the day... It is time popular music followed the other
arts in honoring its primitives. The Ramones belong to rock &amp; roll, and not
to rock and avant garde musical trends.&quot;
(ROLLING STONE, pgs. 46-47 7.29.1976)
[end of Carducci's Rolling Stone quote]

Again, lucky for the Ramones and the music they were from NYC and Rolling
Stone was compelled to pay attention. Also: note the middle brow reflex to
drag Europe into this!

The youngster on the Rolling Stone staff at this time was Cameron Crowe. He
was twenty in 1977 and so you might've expected him to have some sort of
appreciation for the music of his day. But he proved rather to have his
finger on the pulse of the late seventies Industry Zeitgeist, when he wrote,
&quot;If punk is any indication of the alternative, I'll stick with the sixties
wimps.&quot; (RS 12.15.1977). Fourteen years later and his interest in the
breaking Seattle underground bands for his film, &quot;Singles,&quot; was again pegged
to the Industry's motion. I know where Hollywood finds such poets of Youth,
but where does Rolling Stone find them?

Christgau's review of the Ramones' debut hemmed and hawed over the presumed
sources of his delight:
&quot;I love this record - love it - even though I know these boys flirt with
images of brutality (Nazi especially) in much the same way 'Midnight
Rambler' flirts with rape. You couldn't say they condone any nasties,
natch - they merely suggest that the power of their music has some fairly
ominous sources and tap those sources even as they offer the suggestion.
This makes me uneasy.&quot;
(CREEM, vol. 8, No. 3 8.1976)

When he rationalizes away his unease by claiming unease is central to good
rock and roll, you sense that but for this tolerance what we are dealing
with here is a folkie -- someone who, truth be told, believes that music
should not be heavy, or electric, or reflect negative or even neutral social
or individual reality. Sure he loved the Ramones album but his immediate
hedging is the reflex of either a politico or someone so focused on the
politicos around him that they've appropriated his voice.

Other critics discussed &quot;deconstruction&quot; and &quot;minimalism&quot; when some
reference to the sound of the band's music was required. Yet as that sound
developed over the course of their first four albums it became harder and
fuller, though the lyrical approach was consistent. Their rock was less and
less a strictly cerebral conceit and so, whereas with the first album
critics could enjoy it so thoroughly because they hated Black Sabbath,
afterwards the Ramones with a good simple hard rock production gave a
similar kick and this was a let down for them. (Christgau complained that
the second album was &quot;heavier than need be.&quot;) They wanted pop sell-out, not
rock sell-out. This, well before the band actually began to decline
artistically.

I finally had time to read this excerpt, and am pleased to find only one
phrase I don't understand (&quot;semiography of 'schmuck rock' &quot;).

Nothing to disagree with here.  Particularly amused by the paragraph about
Christgau. I can relate to that.  No question, there've been times when I
heard something and wondered &quot;Am I allowed to like this?&quot;

Thanks, Diane. Yes, Carducci sometimes goes too far in that high-fallutin'
direction.

The point that precedes the semiography, &quot;radio's blockade forced those kids
to find the music via word-of-mouth&quot; was exactly my experience. I was one of
those kids (12 in 1976). I'd heard about the Ramones but never heard them. I
think it's highly indicative -- of something -- that the first time I did
hear the Ramones was in a punk movie I saw in an art-house movie theater at
the Art Institute of Chicago! Carducci would say that the Ramones should
have been fodder for drive-ins and trailer parks; instead they were known,
and barely so, only by pretentious pseudo-intellectual kids like me who
happened to go to high school in the downtown of a major urban area.

There's nothing here about the &quot;pop sellout&quot; Carducci reads into it.
Taken together with his earlier punk article, it is clear he is
referring to the production of the LP, not the content.

Beyond the occasional clunky language and creative manipulation of his

What's original about what he's saying? I was going to respond that I liked
his related point that the Ramones needed to be from NYC to get Rolling
Stone mag's attention (I think that's a moderately original idea, no?). On
thinking it through a little more, I wonder if that actually undermines his
Carducci-vs.-critics argument because it could mean Ramones weren't
&quot;particularly&quot; talented. Their artistic success is due to being in New York
which can tap one into the zeitgeist more than being from the sticks
(Styx?). Same is probably true of the Beastie Boys.

I think he does identify who wrote it, Paul Nelson:

I know a lot of people pointed out the &quot;writing off of all hard rock&quot; in
Carducci's sentence above, but it seems like when I've seen it said it's
always by people in Carducci's position, authors of books on heavy metal,
etc., who except for Chuck Eddy aren't known or respected. Have you seen the
critics who themselves did do the writing off address it? Christgau gave
Black Sabbath an E grade, revised upward to C-. Marsh, in the Rolling Stone
Record Guide oversaw 1-star grades for all Sabbath.

I like Cameron Crowe. He helped me toward thinking of Jethro Tull as my
favorite act of that period, which is an idea I'm still mulling over. Crowe
was right that sticking with classic rock could well be better than going
with punk. Carducci's shaking his fist at the wind, but the whole thing
makes me sad.

You said in our last exchange, that everyone sometimes takes themselves, and
rock criticism, too seriously:

wm: &gt;&gt; this isn't the only time I've seen him [Marsh] taking himself, and
rock criticism in general, too seriously.

fred: &gt;That happens with everybody.

Maybe not everyone, but a lot of people also want to cast themselves as more
out of the mainstream than they are.

Thanks for those links and doing that research, Fred. You'll get no argument
from me in a Carducci-vs.-Christgau dispute. I love Christgau. One of my
&quot;ideas&quot; is that we should stop trying to reinvent the wheel and just use
Christgau as a template (except for certain &quot;lapses&quot; which are just things
he slags that I like) of what's good.

I agree that it says not much about the Ramones, but they function here as
the fulcrum in Carducci's arg about the high-brow/low-brow split, which
seems to have confused the hell out of everyone. The &quot;way we talk about
rock,&quot; or rock criticism, has gone haywire (unless it was always haywire, as
you imply in your comment above: &quot;the quote from Rolling Stone reminds me
why I stopped reading it&quot;).

Another of my &quot;ideas&quot; is that we've got to heal, or fix, the animosity
behind that split. Carducci participates in and believes the ideology of the
split, so I totally disagree with him there.

Maybe the book's not revolutionary stuff, but, pity me, it's the last whole
book I've read since 1993!

&gt; Thanks for those links and doing that research, Fred. You'll get no argument
&gt; from me in a Carducci-vs.-Christgau dispute. I love Christgau. One of my
&gt; &quot;ideas&quot; is that we should stop trying to reinvent the wheel and just use
&gt; Christgau as a template (except for certain &quot;lapses&quot; which are just things
&gt; he slags that I like) of what's good.

&gt; &gt; Beyond the occasional clunky language and creative manipulation of his
&gt; &gt; sources,I really don't see where Carducci adds anything new to
&gt; &gt; consideration of the Ramones.  Maybe I'm missing something and you
&gt; &gt; can
&gt; &gt; enlighten me.

&gt; I agree that it says not much about the Ramones, but they function here as
&gt; the fulcrum in Carducci's arg about the high-brow/low-brow split, which
&gt; seems to have confused the hell out of everyone. The &quot;way we talk about
&gt; rock,&quot; or rock criticism, has gone haywire (unless it was always haywire, as
&gt; you imply in your comment above: &quot;the quote from Rolling Stone reminds me
&gt; why I stopped reading it&quot;).
">

There's always a tug-of-war between the Dionysian and the Apollonian
in the arts, and as soon as there was serious writing about rock and
roll, which started with Paul Williams at Crawdaddy, it was inevitable
that the debate would be carried on by less-competent hands.  Your
excerpt does appear to be more about critical reaction than about the
music itself.  The problem with that is that Carducci is being
selective to make his pre-determined point.  While RS and Christgau
are very visible points on the critical spectrum, they were not the
only ones, nor the only influential ones.  In the case of punk,
critical acceptance was far behind the genre finding and claiming an
audience.

I think I was one of the relative few who actually heard the Ramones
before I heard &quot;of&quot; the Ramones.  A friend of mine played in a band
that shared a gig with them at (I recall) the Mudd Club.  It isn't
among my best remembered live shows because, bluntly, they weren't
very good live at the time.  I would not have recalled seeing them if
my friend hadn't made a point of reminding me that his band played
gigs with the Ramones and that I had been there.  (This was not an
unusual occurence at that time.  I saw one of the most incoherent and
inconsistent bands of the 70s, Soft White Underbelly, several times.
There was never an inkling they would become Blue Oyster Cult.)  Being
in New York helped get them noticed, but the indifference to them in
Middle America stemmed from the fact that almost every town had a band
that was doing the same thing, and better, and almost every town had a
kid writer who was doing a better job of describing the experience
than Rolling Stone.  The only problem was that he was writing for some
mimeographed 'zine, and not a national glossy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Another of my &quot;ideas&quot; is that we've got to heal, or fix, the animosity
&gt; behind that split. Carducci participates in and believes the ideology of the
&gt; split, so I totally disagree with him there.
">

The split goes back to the first cave paintings and the first cave
painting critic.  It is the tension between the two artistic poles
that creates the stress from which great art comes.  There really is
no synthesis, despite what legions of Electric Light Orchestra fans
tell you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Maybe the book's not revolutionary stuff, but, pity me, it's the last whole
&gt; book I've read since 1993!
">

Don't stop on my account.  There's been a lot of great music writing
done since then.  Blow the dust off your library card and check out
some of the Da Capo series of Best Music Writing Of (The Year).  The
material ranges from paragraph long reviews to interviews to 10,000
word free-form explorations.  The styles vary as much as the musical
subjects, but the writing is exemplary.  You'll find yourself reading
about music genres you never much cared for, and you'll enjoy the
experience, I assure you..

And just so Peanut doesn't go whining &quot;conflict of interest&quot; without
reason again, in the spirit of full disclosure, I make a cameo
appearance in an article in the 2006 volume, in which I get to tell a
story about watching Bonnie Raitt react as an audience member at a
Bettye LaVette show.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;ideas&quot; is that we should stop trying to reinvent the wheel and just use
&gt; &gt; &gt; Christgau as a template (except for certain &quot;lapses&quot; which are just things
&gt; &gt; &gt; he slags that I like) of what's good.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Beyond the occasional clunky language and creative manipulation of his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sources,I really don't see where Carducci adds anything new to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consideration of the Ramones.  Maybe I'm missing something and you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enlighten me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree that it says not much about the Ramones, but they function here as
&gt; &gt; &gt; the fulcrum in Carducci's arg about the high-brow/low-brow split, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; seems to have confused the hell out of everyone. The &quot;way we talk about
&gt; &gt; &gt; rock,&quot; or rock criticism, has gone haywire (unless it was always haywire, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; you imply in your comment above: &quot;the quote from Rolling Stone reminds me
&gt; &gt; &gt; why I stopped reading it&quot;).

&gt; &gt; There's always a tug-of-war between the Dionysian and the Apollonian
&gt; &gt; in the arts, and as soon as there was serious writing about rock and
&gt; &gt; roll, which started with Paul Williams at Crawdaddy, it was inevitable
&gt; &gt; that the debate would be carried on by less-competent hands.  Your
&gt; &gt; excerpt does appear to be more about critical reaction than about the
&gt; &gt; music itself.  The problem with that is that Carducci is being
&gt; &gt; selective to make his pre-determined point.  While RS and Christgau
&gt; &gt; are very visible points on the critical spectrum, they were not the
&gt; &gt; only ones, nor the only influential ones.  In the case of punk,
&gt; &gt; critical acceptance was far behind the genre finding and claiming an
&gt; &gt; audience.

&gt; &gt; I think I was one of the relative few who actually heard the Ramones
&gt; &gt; before I heard &quot;of&quot; the Ramones.  A friend of mine played in a band
&gt; &gt; that shared a gig with them at (I recall) the Mudd Club.  It isn't
&gt; &gt; among my best remembered live shows because, bluntly, they weren't
&gt; &gt; very good live at the time.  I would not have recalled seeing them if
&gt; &gt; my friend hadn't made a point of reminding me that his band played
&gt; &gt; gigs with the Ramones and that I had been there.  (This was not an
&gt; &gt; unusual occurence at that time.  I saw one of the most incoherent and
&gt; &gt; inconsistent bands of the 70s, Soft White Underbelly, several times.
&gt; &gt; There was never an inkling they would become Blue Oyster Cult.)  Being
&gt; &gt; in New York helped get them noticed, but the indifference to them in
&gt; &gt; Middle America stemmed from the fact that almost every town had a band
&gt; &gt; that was doing the same thing, and better, and almost every town had a
&gt; &gt; kid writer who was doing a better job of describing the experience
&gt; &gt; than Rolling Stone.  The only problem was that he was writing for some
&gt; &gt; mimeographed 'zine, and not a national glossy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Another of my &quot;ideas&quot; is that we've got to heal, or fix, the animosity
&gt; &gt; &gt; behind that split. Carducci participates in and believes the ideology of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; split, so I totally disagree with him there.

&gt; &gt; The split goes back to the first cave paintings and the first cave
&gt; &gt; painting critic.  It is the tension between the two artistic poles
&gt; &gt; that creates the stress from which great art comes.  There really is
&gt; &gt; no synthesis, despite what legions of Electric Light Orchestra fans
&gt; &gt; tell you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe the book's not revolutionary stuff, but, pity me, it's the last whole
&gt; &gt; &gt; book I've read since 1993!

&gt; &gt; Don't stop on my account.  There's been a lot of great music writing
&gt; &gt; done since then.  Blow the dust off your library card and check out
&gt; &gt; some of the Da Capo series of Best Music Writing Of (The Year).  The
&gt; &gt; material ranges from paragraph long reviews to interviews to 10,000
&gt; &gt; word free-form explorations.  The styles vary as much as the musical
&gt; &gt; subjects, but the writing is exemplary.  You'll find yourself reading
&gt; &gt; about music genres you never much cared for, and you'll enjoy the
&gt; &gt; experience, I assure you..

&gt; &gt; And just so Peanut doesn't go whining &quot;conflict of interest&quot; without
&gt; &gt; reason again, in the spirit of full disclosure, I make a cameo
&gt; &gt; appearance in an article in the 2006 volume, in which I get to tell a
&gt; &gt; story about watching Bonnie Raitt react as an audience member at a
&gt; &gt; Bettye LaVette show.

You guys gotta stop with all this analysis of the intentions and
purposes of these artists. It's just some guys making some rock and
roll. that's all. They don't all HAVE to have had some sort of plan
and point of view and specific ideas about how they wanted to be
perceived. I really think that you've all bought into the rock
critic's ideas and are reading WAY too much into some simple rock and
roll songs.

It's too bad that there are no rock critics who can actually analyze
chord changes and and the use of minor keys and tempo, and other
musical matters that are actually the meat and potatoes of rock and
roll. Since the critics, and most fans, know nothing about what
actually makes up these sounds, they instead fall back on analyzing
lyrics and the band's &quot;look&quot; and what they perceive as the band's
&quot;point of view&quot; and &quot;message.&quot;

It's really a vicious cycle that is most cases results in analysis of
things that never were even thought about by the groups as they made
music.

The Madonna parallel is an interesting idea.  She was definitely
helped early on in that regard by the advent of music videos, which
could carry a lot of symbolic imagery that often ran counter to the
lyrics of the songs she was singing.  The first couple videos,
&quot;Borderline&quot; in particular, make no effort to reference the lyrics at
all.  Under that direct stress, a lot of space for contextual
interpretation opens up.

But how much of the Ramones was actually self-conscious, and how much
was the critics denying &quot;what you see is what you get?&quot;  I always
thought they were perfectly serious.  The names were an affectation,
but then so was &quot;Ringo Starr.&quot;  I never got the feeling they were
trying to create the same cultural conflict within their work.  The
music was too damned simple to carry irony (and I say that as a good
thing.)

Under that interpretation, there was no pretext to keep up.  They just
had to keep playing.

Interesting. I don't know who you might mean by the bands in every town,

I'm not arguing for an ELO-like synthesis (God forbid). And I wonder if the
split does go as far back as you say. I think the split is class-based. The
way it seems to have shaken out since WWII is that the older generation opts
for the high-brow and deplores the younger generation's low-brow. Thus, I
have friends a few years older than me, in their 50s, who tell me how they
hated Led Zeppelin, Grand Funk, Ten Years After. That seems ironic to me,
since that's what the parents' generation felt about the first waves of r&amp;r.

I wonder about that narrative of generational conflict because it seems like
the media can start that ball rolling so easily, not deliberately to be
malicious, but just to have something to say. Dylan and the Beatles seemed
to be reacting to that in their &quot;taunting the press&quot; episodes.

There are plenty of writers who focus on that.

I could recommend a dozen books, but you're probably bettery off
simply Googling &quot;musicology&quot; and &quot;rock&quot; and finding something that
interests you by title.

Whatever else you read, do not miss Theodor Adorno's,&quot;On Popular
Music.&quot; in &quot;On Record: Rock, Pop, and The Written Word&quot; Simon Frith
and Andrew Goodwin, eds.  There's a lot of great stuff in the book
beyond the musicology, but some of the other stuff is outdated, as the
book in nearly 20 years old.,  Your local library should have a copy.
If you can find Adorno's   &quot;On the Fetish-Character in Music and the
Regression of Listening,&quot; you might want to set it aside until you've
read Richard Middleton's analysis of the first Adorno work.  Heavy
going all around, but really, really good on the stuff you think
should be the focus of criticism.

A longer study of the same material can be found in &quot;Music of The
Common Tongue&quot; by Christopher Small, which deals with the conflict
between Western and Aftican musical modes in American music.  You
might find the history a bit dry, but the relevance to mid 20th
Century pop can't be overstated in terms of both musical modes,
instrumentation and the role of vocal music.

For a more &quot;pop&quot; approach, there's always Charlie Gillett, but you've
already voiced your disapproval of his work based on the fact he gets
some of his chart data wrong.

It was a lot more than chart data, that was the smallest part of it.
He was mentioning records as being parts of eras that were like 4 or 5
years off, among other things. Here's some of the problems I had with
&quot;The Sound Of The City:

I'm going through &quot;The Sound Of The City&quot; by Charlie Gillett to seee
if
he actually writes &quot;about music&quot; anywhere in the book. This is a
revised later edition (1996 copy of a 1983 revision), so the errors
from the original book (1970) should be cleaned up. If the first page
of chapter one is any indication, there must have been a ton of
errors
in the first edition. Here's what I have a problem with right off the
bat....

CHAPTER ONE - THE SOUND BEGINS

By the second paragraph there are already three errors (or
omissions),
or misappliactions of terms.

1 - Gillett says that &quot;rock 'n' roll&quot; and &quot;rock and roll&quot; and &quot;rock&quot;
are all terms that describe different types of music.

2 - Gillett mentions &quot;Good Rockin' Tonight&quot; (recorded by Roy Brown)
as
an early song about lovemaking and dancing.

No mention of the much more significant Wynonie Harris version of the
song.

3 - Gillett says that &quot;Rock All Night Long&quot; (The Ravens) was recorded
by 1948.

The record was from 1952, and the correct title is &quot;Rock Me All Night
Long.&quot;

4 - He mentions that &quot;Crazy, Man, Crazy&quot; is the first rock 'n' roll
record to make the best seller lists on Billboard's national chart.

I don't know if I agree with that. There's &quot;Sixty Minute man&quot; two
years
earlier, as well as &quot;Saturday Night Fish Fry&quot; by Jordan in 1949.

How about this one?

Gillett says that &quot;Trying To Get To You&quot; was the closest that Presley
ever got to recording a blues song.

I don't know if I can take this much longer. The book is filled with
false assumptions and mistakes.

___________________________________________________________________________ ____

I'm not actually interested in reading about chord changes and tempos
either. I'm just mentioning that because few writers can write about
those things they have to completely overanalyze other non-musical
aspects of rock and roll artists. Many gullable people have somehow
ran with this and gotten around to overanalyzing all kinds of non-
musical factors about an artist's recordings and their stage act.

The Ramones were the kind of band about whom the audience would think, &quot;if

I agree about the Ramones, and I like the way you expressed it (legitimate
punks ...). Maybe you know more about early Black Sabbath than I do, but
it's hard for me to imagine that they ever took themselves completely
seriously. A lot of (especially British) metal and other hard rock in the
early days did have a sense of humor about itself. Perhaps that
self-deprecatory quality might have declined later on (Rush), but it should
be central to Carducci's argument about the &quot;regular guy&quot; appeal of the rock
music he supports. I'm not so sure about hard-core's, or Black Flag's, sense
of humor about itself either. Now, glam, that was a form with a sense of
humor about itself!

The only point of

Funny you should mention Madonna. Here's another quote from Carducci in
which she appears, and it addresses Bruce's objection to our even talking
about music critics at all:

It seems that as the music audience (and Americans as a whole) have become
less literate and more dependent on the electronic media, their involvement
with music has also become more passive. Instrumental music, other than new
age or muzak, requires more involvement and a higher, more abstract
involvement at that. A vocalist is perhaps most effective as the audience's
vicarious stand-in guiding its response to the music. His clear signs
indicating how the music is to be taken aren't present in instrumental
music. Thus the less musically &quot;literate&quot; the listener the more likely he is
to require that a singer determine his response to the music. (I'm of course
exempting highly musical persons who may be entirely illiterate because they
do not make up the bulk of the rock or pop audiences.) And again, a vocalist
can indeed be a part of a band's musical process; it's just that too often
he isn't.

Regarding exceptional singer/lyricists, this same tendency toward
simplification for the literacy-impaired can be observed today. Consider the
prickly, multi-faceted pop and rock personae of earlier years: Frank
Sinatra, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Miles Davis, Bob Dylan, John
Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young, and consider how many records they sold.
Now consider what passed for problematic pop personahood all through the
eighties and into the nineties: Prince, or Madonna, or Michael Stipe, or
Sting. It's enough to make you agree with all those sentimental sixties'
burnouts about the current state of music, except that their own tastes in
contemporary personality worship are just as puerile and two-dimensional as
their children's: Bruce Springsteen, Bono, etc. Marketing efficiency would
seem to require simplified personae just as it requires simplified melodies.

Contemporary musical personalities have recently begun to fascinate larger
audiences but for fifteen years you had to look under &quot;import&quot; or &quot;punk&quot; or
&quot;hardcore&quot; to find relevant characters like Henry Rollins, H. R. Paul
Hudson, Ian MacKaye, Jack Brewer, Glenn Danzig, Johnny Rotten, Curt
Kirkwood, and Jello Biafra. And think of how many records they sold. Why the
feebs aren't hardly worth bootlegging! Well maybe they are now since the
class of '88 came on line.

what they were doing, and plan their attack a little more. They were working
their asses off to be musicians, and their music was WAY more to them than
simple rock and roll songs, too. It was a way of not having to work in a
coal mine or something.

The fact that they made great music doesn't speak to their
self-consciousness or lack thereof, but to how good a musician had to be in
those days to scrape together a living. My perception from what I've read is
that the competition was fierce. Think of Django Reinhardt or blind Ray

People can have a point of view in their personal life, but that has
nothing to do with the fact that they happen to be musicians. If you
eventually did a decent version of &quot;Turkey In The Straw&quot; that does not
mean that you are a proponent of square dancing. All it means is that
you recorded a decent version of that particular song, and that's it.

That's what you don't seem to grasp. Steve Lawrence may have a very
similar &quot;point of view&quot; to some heavy metal musician. The fact that
they are musicians and perform a certain style of music has NOTHING to
do with their personal point of view and beliefs, etc...Eddie Fisher
was doing the lamest traditional pop music around at the same time
that he was addicted to heroin. Then you could have someone like Alice
Cooper recording unique rock and roll and performing in outrageous
stage costumes while being a quiet conservaite in real life.

That's why they are called &quot;performers,&quot; because what they may believe
in and care about in real life does not necessarily have anything to
do with their professional life.

If you focus strictly on the technical elements of &quot;music&quot;, you end up
with a critical system that finds Little Richard and Pat Boone to be
artistic equals because they sang the same notes in the same order.  I
don't think you are suggesting that is an appropriate conclusion.

I think your conclusion is fatally flawed because it presumes the only
valid consideration of music is technical in nature.  Writers don't
choose what you consider a &quot;lesser&quot; approach to music criticism only
because they &quot;can't&quot; discuss things on a technical level any more than
people become umpires only because they lack the ability to actually
play the game.

Music doesn't exist in a cultural vacuum.  There were reasons why the
Ramones and Madonna are popular and important artists that have
nothing to do with the order of notes that they played.  Understanding
music in the full context of culture, and considering different
opinions regarding that context not only can lead to a greater
appreciation of music, but a better perception of culture as a whole.
In some ways, it is the difference between a cut diamond and an
unpolished piece of stone that &quot;might&quot; be a diamond.  You need to
examine it to know the difference.

The effect of this examination creates a self-sustating progression;
the more you know, the more precise your analysis.  The more precise
your analysis, the more you see.  The more you see, the more you
know.  This is the way that all human knowledge progresses.  Denying
the essential viability of an entire universe of fact and opinion
(which is what you do when you write off non-technical music
criticism) is not only counterintuitive, it runs against simple
principles of evolution.

Despite this, which is the reality of exposure to criticism for many
people, you continue to set up critics as straw men, asserting that
they are somehow insisting you substitute their opinions for your
own.  I have never read, heard of, or seen a critic try to do what you
are insisting they do, and frankly, the sheer number of critics is
proof your premise is wrong. No all of them can be &quot;right,&quot; can
they?

The real role of cultural criticism is to challenge the reader into
independent thought, not to force him to submit to the &quot;correct&quot;
opinion, even if you continue to argue to the contrary.  When someone
looks at one of your ranked lists of &quot;great&quot; songs, or your list of
top songs for a given year, a blind insistence that whatever is #1 is
somehow better than whatever is #2 doesn't help anyone understand
anything other than what YOU think, which, by definition, is not a
subject of debate.  If, on the other hand, you could explain WHY you
think one song is #14 and another is #21, that provides a basis for
discussion and potential illumination on both sides of the discussion
as well.  Unfortunately, it never gets that far because you are
unwilling to discuss how you determine the rankings of individual
songs.

In essence, the problem is not with music critics or music criticism.
It is with the way we seek a common vocabulary to discuss music.
Musicologists approach the issue one way.  Critics who consider music
in a cultural context come at it from a different angle.  Neither is
the &quot;right&quot; way.  Both have contributions to make to improving our
understanding, appreciation and enjoyment of music.

Hogwash.

These are just guys making rock and roll records, no analysis is
necessary. You listen to it, and see if you like it or not. That's all
there is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I can see how this kind of talk pisses you off, and I don't know what to
&gt;&gt; say. You tell me, in a way, not to think or talk about these things the
&gt;&gt; way
&gt;&gt; I do. Let's say I reduced my pretentiousness quotient by 40%, I can't see
&gt;&gt; how that would be nearly enough to meet your standards.

&gt;&gt; It's true, there can be no &quot;planning&quot;; I've tried to write and play
&gt;&gt; music,
&gt;&gt; and it's so difficult, that my goal was to just play *something,*
&gt;&gt; anything,
&gt;&gt; even if it's only Turkey in the Straw.

&gt;&gt; A point of view is, unfortunately, how we talk about people, and to
&gt;&gt; people.
&gt;&gt; You have a point of view. You do or don't take yourself too seriously.
&gt;&gt; It's
&gt;&gt; not that complicated.

&gt; People can have a point of view in their personal life, but that has
&gt; nothing to do with the fact that they happen to be musicians. If you
&gt; eventually did a decent version of &quot;Turkey In The Straw&quot; that does not
&gt; mean that you are a proponent of square dancing. All it means is that
&gt; you recorded a decent version of that particular song, and that's it.

&gt; That's what you don't seem to grasp. Steve Lawrence may have a very
&gt; similar &quot;point of view&quot; to some heavy metal musician. The fact that
&gt; they are musicians and perform a certain style of music has NOTHING to
&gt; do with their personal point of view and beliefs, etc...Eddie Fisher
&gt; was doing the lamest traditional pop music around at the same time
&gt; that he was addicted to heroin. Then you could have someone like Alice
&gt; Cooper recording unique rock and roll and performing in outrageous
&gt; stage costumes while being a quiet conservaite in real life.

&gt; That's why they are called &quot;performers,&quot; because what they may believe
&gt; in and care about in real life does not necessarily have anything to
&gt; do with their professional life.
">

You make good points.

In your earlier post you said:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Nobody wanted to see any of these artists in Hopkins era because of what
&gt; they stood for, or their &quot;point of view&quot; or anything else but pure
&gt; entertainment.
">

This isn't strictly true. There were always people in the audiences who
envied and wished that they could replace or play as well as the performers.
Bill Monroe insisted that he and his band wear suits, to give him an edge
over the competition, and to raise all the music up because he thought it
was undignified to wear overalls and suspenders. He was a &quot;proponent&quot; of
square dance music.

Robert Johnson was involved with creating and perpetuating rumors that he
had made a pact with the devil to be able to play so well.

That's the kind of thing Carducci is talking about. He's not a music critic
any more than you or I. But he was involved in helping bands make money and
be successful. Some bands needed to work on raw technique and ability to
play, and (here's where you'll howl) others were missing the mark in how to
position themselves for a receptive audience.

He generally deplores the role of music critics. When he says, &quot;why didn't
you like Black Sabbath?&quot; to music critics, he's saying nothing different
than when you ask someone on these boards why they like Pat Boone but not
Little Richard.

Personal point of view versus performance point of view is a technicality.
Some people's personalities are so much larger than life that being &quot;just
who they are&quot; on stage would be the best thing they could do. Yet I'm sure
people like that have failed because someone told them to tone it down.

As for a literary approach to music, I believe that life, the universe, and
everything can be talked about that way, so I can't see why music would be
exempt.

The fact that you find it important to stack one record on top of
another in lists proves you don't mean a word of that.  If you really
believed it was &quot;like it or not,&quot; you would just need two lists; &quot;I
like it&quot; and &quot;I don't like it.&quot;

Whether you appreciate it or not, you are engaged in music criticism
when you rank records.

Whether you appreciate it or not, when you tell us that your lists are
based on analysis of the records, and you assert that your method of
analysis is valid, you are engaged in music criticism AND you are
engaged in justifying your criticism as the &quot;correct&quot; one.  Your
repeated denials of the validity of any intellectual approach to music
is a transparent attempt to buttress your own approach and excuse your
refusal to consider any alternative, but still you engage in the basic
conduct you say is totally without merit.

In short, despite the claims to the contrary, &quot;you have met the enemy,
and he is you.&quot;  (That's a non-musical cultural reference.)

Please. Robert Johnson only had records out for less than two years

after his death. Those rumors are fables created many years later, and

You can talk about it however you want, but that stuff is all in your

on to his property one day. The fan was all crazy about what he

to him that the songs don't mean anything. They're just songs, and on
any particular song that he sang a certain way it might just mean that
he &quot;had a good shit that day.&quot;

It's like that ridiculous analysis that Marsh did of John lennon's
vocal on &quot;Money.&quot; All that crap he wrote was all in his mind, and the
truth just may have ben that John was constipated that day.

Elijah Wald's &quot;Escaping The Delta&quot; contradicts you on every point you
make in that paragraph beyond the length of his recording career.

Wald explains that the legends about Johnson selling his soul were
well known while he was alive.  They started circulating shortly after
he began playing with a proficiency he hadn't demonstrated before.  He
was also quite famous in the Delta well before he recorded.  Within
the blues world, he was quite well known.  John Hammond went looking
for him to bring him to New York to perform at Carnegie Hall before
Hammond learned Johnson had died.  Johnson was extraordinarily
influential among other blues musicians who never failed to credit him
as a inspiration.  Muddy Waters talked about him and the Devil legend
with Alan Lomax in the early 40s.  So did dozens of other bluesmen who
kept the stories alive.

These were no &quot;fables created many years later.&quot;  The idea of a
bluesman selling his soul to the Devil predated Johnson.  William
Bunch renamed himself &quot;Peetie Wheatstraw, The Devil's Son-In-Law&quot; to
play on the same theme.  Wheatstraw was one of Johnson's main creative
sources, so Johnson obviously knew the stories behind the character.
When people commented on his amazing new proficiency on the guitar,
Johnson made sly jokes about selling his soul that other bluesmen
repeated.

You're just flat wrong on this.

Yeah.  Only asswipes need facts.  It takes a real men to make stuff up

And who cares if you are wrong?  It's not like anyone really puts any

Lives
Shirt-Worthy
By DAVID GIFFELS
There is only one acceptable way to own a Ramones T-shirt. This is to
have attended a Ramones concert, sweated, bled, transcended and then
purchased one at a merchandise table en route to the concert-hall
exit. (Preferably at the Rainbow Theatre, London, New Year's Eve 1977,
but that's not a deal breaker.)

The closest I ever came to owning one was when, as a minor, I borrowed
my older brother's shirt from the &quot;Pleasant Dreams&quot; tour, his first-
ever rock concert, which he attended with the brother of the B-level
pop starlet Rachel Sweet and at which he purchased this garment with
his last dollars. What I didn't realize at the time was how firmly
that shirt would establish a complicated precedent. Rock 'n' roll
paraphernalia had to be hard-won, meaningful and scented with personal
experience. It required a depth of symbolic thought - something like
what Bob Seger probably goes through when browsing at a Chevrolet
dealership. Later, I attended several of the band's shows myself, but
it seemed too easy just to walk up and buy a shirt. Or maybe it was
that none of the shows were epic enough to justify it. The iconic
shirt had to be earned, on both sides.

I was comfortable with the fact that I did not own one. The self-
deprivation reinforced standards of cultural behavior that were
important to me. Not that anyone else would notice, since no one ever
notices when you're not wearing a particular item of clothing, unless
that item is your pants. But I had internal street credibility, which,
in Ohio, where I live, is sufficient.

Then I had children, which involves reconsidering everything you once
believed to be true. (The relative grossness of vomit, for instance.
Before parenthood, vomit is not considered Something to Catch in
Midair, Barehanded.) So when my son asked for a Ramones T-shirt for
his 10th birthday because he &quot;wanted one,&quot; the request was so
culturally complex that I chose not to probe it. Instead I just headed
to the mall.

I'm not one of those cool detached persons who pretend they don't know
that such a thing as Hot Topic exists. I knew about the store. Totally
knew. It's like a punk-rock version of Foot Locker. But I'd never
glanced inside one. Not because I was above it. More like parallel. It
contained things that once defined an entire value system but that I
now no longer thought about.

Entering Hot Topic required a psychological recalibration. I passed
into a room padded with shirts: the Germs, Dead Kennedys, Bad
Religion, the Subhumans - punk-era bands that barely ascended to
&quot;underground&quot; status and were now benefiting from the contemporary
marketing of the obscure.

The tall stack of Ramones T-shirts was somehow familiar and almost
heartwarming. It wasn't nostalgia I felt. Nostalgia requires a past.
This past never existed for me. I saw these shirts on other people,
Californians mostly, in the pages of somebody else's copy of Maximum
Rock 'n' Roll. These days, things that should be rare are startlingly
available. Could it be, I wondered, that my children will never have
to struggle? And that Hot Topic is the metaphor for this? I wanted
this to be true as much as I wanted this not to be true.

I dug through the stack. It ended at Adult Small. He'd have to grow
into it. I took it home, wrapped it and set it with the other packages
of 10-year-old-boy gear.

He wore it for the first time to a friend's cookout. The kids ran off
to play, and the parents chatted on the patio. Soon he came running,
his forearm half-covering his eyes, the conflicted gesture of a 10-
year-old boy Trying Not to Cry, which, if you are not made of
obsidian, will break your heart in four seconds.

&quot;What is it?&quot; I asked. He twisted himself sideways, pulling the tail
of his shirt out to show me.

&quot;The fence,&quot; he exhaled over the cliff of his throat.

There was a jagged rip, maybe two inches, trailed by a thread of hem.
We dads locked eyes in simultaneous understanding.

&quot;No,&quot; one said. &quot;You just made it better.&quot;

I wanted to explain that very truth - that just as emotional pain
brings us closer to God, so a rip in our Ramones T-shirt brings us
closer to Sid Vicious. But in a moment like that, the notion of
conveying wisdom is as relevant as trigonometry offered to a quicksand
victim.

&quot;We can get another one,&quot; I said.

Which we did. Obtaining a replacement was a mere errand, devoid of
ethical-cultural implications, $20, cleanly exchanged.

And this is how I ended up owning a Ramones T-shirt, a little snug,
with a rip in the bottom, and wearing it with a clean conscience.
Because no responsible father ever wastes a perfectly good shirt.
