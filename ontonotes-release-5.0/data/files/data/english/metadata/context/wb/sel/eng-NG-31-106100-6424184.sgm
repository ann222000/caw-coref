Nev. dunes restricted to help butterfly

By SCOTT SONNER, Associated Press Writer Fri Mar 23, 3:29 AM ET

RENO, Nev. - Federal land managers trying to keep a rare butterfly off
the list of endangered species have closed dozens of off-road vehicle
trails at one of the largest sand dunes in the West.

The closure affects about six square miles at Sand Mountain Recreation
Area in western Nevada. The dunes' shrubs are the Sand Mountain blue
butterfly's only known home.

The Bureau of Land Management controls activities at the dunes, which
are 600 feet tall and stretch for two miles. Their 200 miles of trails
attract an estimated 50,000 off-roaders annually on motorcycles, dune
buggies and all-terrain vehicles.

Bureau officials said they could not say how many miles of trails were
closed but noted that the main dune at Sand Mountain where most
motorized use occurs will remain open.

The BLM and the Fish and Wildlife Service have been seeking a
compromise with off-road groups to restrict vehicles since
conservationists started petitioning for federal protection of the
butterfly in 2004.

The BLM published the emergency closure order in the Federal Register
last week, two years after imposing a voluntary measure. It will post
signs where travel is prohibited, spokesman Mark Struble said.

"It's called an emergency restriction so when everybody hears the 'E'
word they think we are shutting the whole mountain down. That is not
the case," Struble said.

"We're going from a wide-open, cross-country, go-over-any-of-the-
bushes-if-they-get-in-your-way kind of situation, to trying to
conserve as much of the vegetative resources that is out there as
possible," he said.

"If the old way continues, habitat will continue to degrade and the
species will be closer and closer to getting listed."

Conservationists filed a lawsuit in federal court in Sacramento,
Calif., in January 2006 to try to force the Fish and Wildlife Service
to declare the butterfly an endangered species.

Agency officials are reviewing the butterfly's habitat and could rule
as soon as next month on the proposed listing.

"The closure is a good first step toward protecting the Sand Mountain
blue butterfly, which exists nowhere else in the world," said Lisa
Belenky, staff attorney for Arizona's Center for Biological Diversity,
which sued along with the Nevada Outdoor Recreation Association and
Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.

Off-roaders were less enthusiastic.

Richard Hilton, president of Friends of Sand Mountain, said the
closure was "kind of pushed on us" but probably the best deal his
group could hope for.

"It was one of those things where we felt like any time an
environmental group sues, off-road users usually lose," he said.

Some conservationists said that even with 80 percent of the dunes
closed, there still will be too much intrusion and that more
protection is warranted.

"The real test of the bureau's commitment to protecting butterfly
habitat will be enforcement," said Karen Schambach of Public Employees
for Environmental Responsibility.

Though violators will be subject to up to one year in prison, Struble
said the initial emphasis will be on distributing maps and educating
visitors.

"We are trying to work it to have the habitat, protect the species out
there and have recreation out there, too," he said. "We need people's
help and we weren't getting it under the volunteer system we had the
first two years."

Ed Waldheim, president of the California Off-Road Vehicle Association,
said off-roaders would be wise to follow the rules.

"Otherwise the next step is closing," Waldheim said. "This is
something that we have learned the hard way in other areas."
