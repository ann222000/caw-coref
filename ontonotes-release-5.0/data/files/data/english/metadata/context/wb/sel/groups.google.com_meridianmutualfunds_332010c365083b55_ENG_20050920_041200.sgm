It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men
of their own choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be
read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood, if they be
repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such
incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is today, can
guess what it will be like tomorrow. - James Madison, Federalist

The American heritage was one of individual liberty, personal
responsibility and freedom from government ... Unfortunately ... that
heritage has been lost. Americans no longer have the freedom to direct
their own lives ... Today, it is the government that is free - free
to do whatever it wants. There is no subject, no issue, no matter ...
that is not subject to legislation. - Harry Browne.

grocery money saving earning leave statement The politician attempts to
remedy the evil by increasing the very thing that caused the evil in
the first place: legal plunder. - Frédéric Bastiat. We ask that the
government undertake the obligation above all of providing citizens
with adequate opportunity for employment and earning a living. The
activities of the individual must not be allowed to clash with the
interests of the community, but must take place within its confines and
be for the good of all. Therefore, we demand: ... an end to the power
of the financial interests. We demand profit sharing in big business.
We demand a broad extension of care for the aged. We demand ... the
greatest possible consideration of small business in the purchases of
national, state, and municipal governments. In order to make possible
to every capable and industrious [citizen] the attainment of higher
education and thus the achievement of a post of leadership, the
government must provide an all-around enlargement of our entire system
of public education ... We demand the education at government expense
of gifted children of poor parents ... The government must undertake
the improvement of public health - by protecting mother and child, by
prohibiting child labor ... by the greatest possible support for all
clubs concerned with the physical education of youth. We combat the ...
materialistic spirit within and without us, and are convinced that a
permanent recovery of our people can only proceed from within on the
foundation of the common good before the individual good. - From the
political program of the Nazi Party, adopted in Munich, February 24,
1920. auto bad credit loan people sale art work online irs roth ira

301 accident Individuality is the aim of political liberty. By leaving
the citizen as much freedom of action and of being as comports with
order and the rights of others, the institutions render him truly a
freeman. He is left to pursue his means of happiness in his own manner.

Opium and morphine are certainly dangerous, habit-forming drugs. But
once the principle is admitted that it is the duty of the government to
protect the individual against his own foolishness, no serious
objections can be advanced against further encroachments ... Is not the
harm a man can inflict on his mind and soul even more disastrous than
any bodily evils.? Why not prevent him from reading bad books and bad
plays, from looking at bad paintings and statues and from hearing bad
music? The mischief done by bad ideologies, surely, is much more
pernicious both for the individual and for the whole society, than that
done by narcotic drugs. - Von Mises, Human Action . government money
