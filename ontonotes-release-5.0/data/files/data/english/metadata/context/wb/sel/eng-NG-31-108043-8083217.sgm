Vledick Tord's patrons often wonder why the merchant employs such an
ill-natured journeyman.  After all, the hairy shifter called Vrim
alternates between silence and loud complaining when assisting Vledick,
and his customers have often made jokes about the bull in the china
shop.  But Vledick's business, &quot;Just A Collection Of Antiques and
Curios,&quot; stocks many rare bits of Galifaran history that his competitors
don't, and so the true connoisseur will shrug it off as an eccentricity.

But Sharn's mean streets can be a dangerous place, especially when one's
competitors are jealous of one's successes, and Vrim's imposing figure,
armed with a massive two-handed sword, put off most attempts to snatch
goods that are being delivered.

As the shifter is tying his boots, preparing to go home at closing time,
Vledick hands Vrim a package.  &quot;Take this to Crucible, the warforged
working at the Red Hammer Inn down in the cogs.  There'll be a bonus in
your pay when you're done.  Then have a good night.&quot;

Vrim tucks the package into his pack and sets off downtower, hooding his
face and drawing his cloak around himself.

First-time visitors to the Lightning Rail station in Tavick's Landing
are often dazzled by the big city ambience, but not so dazzled that they
forget to take care of business.  Representatives of many fine (and not
so fine) restaurants, hotels, and other establishments (ahem!) have
callers to push their wares on the newly-arrived, but often the first
order of business is to let someone know they're in town.  Hence, the
House Orien message station is a busy place indeed, and with callers of
all economic levels needing services, everything from personal couriers
to message gargoyles are present.

One such courier, a young and attractive woman named Lyrial, is lounging
in the ready room with her co-workers waiting for a job.  All of them
think Lyrial is a human; only her boss &quot;Long Range&quot; Ruskin knows that
she is actually a kalashtar, and a soulknife to boot.  But that's OK
with him, because he can use her for special duties, where a
seemingly-unarmed and pretty courier can find it much easier to get into
places to deliver messages (and bring back reports); and woe be to the
occasional thug who thinks the lone woman is an easy target alone on the
tower's slanting paths.  Often the thug's last sight is that of a
slashing blade of light, followed by the pavement rushing up to meet him.

That's why &quot;Long Range&quot; calls Lyrial up now and hands her an envelope
bearing the seal of House Kundarak.  &quot;Take this to The Red Hammer Inn,
down in the cogs.  Deliver it to a dwarf named Debir Mroranon.  Here's
his picture.&quot;  He hands her a small portrait depicting a well-dressed
dwarf in arcane robes, with a pair of smoked glasses covering his eyes.
Lyrial nods and heads off silently, face turned down to watch the path
in front of her, padding along at a good trot through the crowds of
people all craning their necks up at the sky, taking in the
seemingly-topless towers of Sharn.

Lit both by the flickering Continual Flame torches inside the room and
the dull red glow of the nearby steel foundries, The Red Hammer Inn is
just starting to fill up with warforged.  Here and there the occasional
dwarf or goblin also wanders in, some to realize their mistake and
shuffle out again; others who aren't biased against the creatures sit
and talk, wanting to learn more about these strange and relatively new
beings.  Most of the regulars hang out in small cliques, and one such
clique is sitting near the bar, already engaged in comparing notes from
the day.

Lore the artificer is tinkering with a little mouse trap, drawing and
replacing tools from his belt as he works.  His silvery mithral body
reflects the red light in weird patterns with each of his precise,
measured movements.

Next to him, Bot sits working on a piece of chainmail armor, hammering
the little links together with inhuman patience.  Because his body is
covered with adamantine plating, he doesn't wear clothes; but a large
symbol of the Soverign Host is engraved on his chest, filled in with
blued steel and yellow gold tracings in the appropriate places for those
colors.

The third member of the group is a dwarf wearing arcane robes, clearing
some sort of spellcaster.  However, unlike the other dwarves in The Red
Hammer, he wears darkened glass lenses over his eyes, as if the light in
the place is too much for him even though it is low.  He traces his
finger in the beer rings on the table top everytime he takes a swallow
and sets his mug down off-center.  Debir Mroranon is almost comfortable
here in the depths below Sharn, but he'd prefer to be a few thousand
feet deeper and the place a lot darker.  Still, he feels a strange
attraction to the warforged and talks to them from time to time

Time:  6:00 PM

Vrim Bearsman strides into the Red Hammer Inn, loudly calling for
Crucible.  His rudeness causes heads to swivel and stares to focus on
him, which he ignores.  When Crucible indictes her presence behind the
bar, he stomps over, shoves the package at her, and calls for a big mug
of grog.

Lyrial, by contrast, slips quietly into the Red Hammer Inn a few minutes
later and approaches the trio by the bar, handing the envelope to Debir
and then almost gingerly asking for a glass of water from Crucible.

Things slowly return to normal as Crucible takes the package into a back
room and Debir opens the envelope.  Inside is a message from Dachend
Mroranon, his current Clan elder.  It instructs him to report to the
House Kundarak bank and contains a gemmed token, blazoned with an
&quot;Arcane Mark&quot; that allows the bearer passage to the presence of Darik
d'Kundarak, CEO of Kundarak Bank in Sharn.  He is told to bring along
whatever companions he wishes, as Clan Mroranon wants Debir to help
House Kundarak with a problem they're having, details to follow later.

Debir asks his friends Bot and Lore if they are interested in going, and
they agree.  Bot is done with work and Lore does not start until midnight.

At that time, Crucible comes back out and asks Vrim if he will do her a
favor.  She holds up a small idol, pure green crystal carved in the
shape of a slender, beautiful human female.  On the base is some weird
writing.  Crucible asks Vrim if he will take this to Kundarak Bank and
deposit it in a safe-hold cubicle there.  She gives him a small pouch
with money in it and says that Vrim's employer has given his approval
for this.  Vrim shrugs and takes the idol, which glints and draws the
attention of Debir.

Curious about the unusual writing, Debir asks if he can examine it and
read the writing.  Muttering a spell, he seems enlightened at first and
then puzzled.  Out loud, he asks &quot;What is 'The Dreaming Dark'?&quot;

The sound of shattering glass breaks the relative silence.  Lyrial has
dropped her glass and looks pale, her composure broken.  She asks, &quot;What
does it say?&quot;

Debir tells her that the writing declares this to be an image of
Ulat'hda, Scion of the Dreaming Dark.  But he has never heard of such a
thing.

Lyrial tells him that it is an organization of evil, dedicated to
destroying life as it is known on Khorvaire and perhaps all of Eberron.
At this, Vrim pricks up his ears.  He frowns at the word &quot;evil.&quot;

Crucible says that she purchased this from Vledick as a decoration, but
now she thinks it may have some bad connotations and wants it stored in
a safe place while she decides what to do with it.  Lyrial says that she
would like to make sure it does not fall into the hands of the Dreaming
Dark and volunteers to accompany Vrim to Kundarak Bank.

The group decides that, as they are all headed towards the same place,
it would be well to travel together.  After a quick round of
introductions, the party leaves.

Next time:  A battle on a bridge; sickness in the House of Kundarak; and
a night in a quiet, sealed place--almost.
