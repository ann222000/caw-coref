&quot;When you find peace within yourself,

You become the kind of person who can live at peace with others.&quot;

Peace Pilgrim

As the years go by I believe we have a choice of becoming more tolerant of
our failings and the difference between ourselves and others. Unfortunately
many of us become less tolerant and blame others for everything wrong in our
world. Trust me, tolerance comes from knowing that we are not perfect and
nether is anyone else. I hope as you grow older you too will find tolerance
as it provides the framework for a happy and productive life no matter your
age. Chose intolerance and you will find loneliness and unhappiness. Here is
what someone else has learned and thankfully they were willing to share
their lessons with us.

I've Learned

Author Unknown

I've learned that it's not what you have in your life but who you have in
your life that counts.

I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to the best others can do
but to the best you can do.

I've learned that it's not what happens to people that's important. It's
what they do about it.

I've learned that you can do something in an instant that will give you
heartache for life.

I've learned that it's taking me a long time to become the person I want to
be.

I've learned that it's a lot easier to react than it is to think.

I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, no matter how we feel.

I've learned that either you control your attitude or it controls you.

I've learned that learning to forgive takes practice.

I've learned that money is a lousy way of keeping score.

I've learned that sometimes when I'm angry I have the right to be angry, but
that doesn't give me the right to be cruel.

I've learned that maturity has more to do with what types of experiences
you've had and what you've learned from them and less to do with how many
birthdays you've celebrated.

I've learned that it isn't always enough to be forgiven by others. Sometimes
you have to learn to forgive yourself.

I've learned that our background and circumstances may have influenced who
we are, but we are responsible for who we become.

I've learned that two people can look at the exact same thing and see
something totally different.

I've learned that no matter the consequences, those who are honest with
themselves get farther in life.

I've learned that the paradigm we live in is not all that is offered to us.

There is so much good in the worst of us, and so much bad in the best of us,
that it behooves all of us not to talk about the rest of us.

Robert Louis Stevenson

A wealthy Texas oil magnate goes to Australia to sign a deal to share pumps
in the Mid-East with an Australian company. He is picked up by an Aussie
limo driver and instantly begins to complain. &quot;That plane was way too small.
We have them much larger in Texas. I could barely move my legs.&quot;

The limo driver agrees and begins to put his bags in the limousine.

The Texan asks him. &quot;What's that?&quot;

The driver looks puzzled and says, &quot;This is a limo that was sent for you.&quot;

The Texan says, &quot;Pretty puny ain't it? Texas has real limos, my five year
old has bigger cars than that in his toy box.&quot; The limo driver is irritated
but decides to hold his tongue as this man was very important to his bosses.
As they drive it keeps coming.

&quot;These roads are far too small, I have dental floss wider. In Texas, it will
take you three days and an afternoon to get across one.&quot; &quot;Those cattle are
puny, wouldn't even make good beef jerky. You should see the longhorns in
Texas.&quot; &quot;Is that an office building or did someone turn a cardboard box
upside down and put a trademark on it? In Texas, we have skyscrapers that
would put all these stacked on top of one another to shame.&quot;

The driver was very upset by this time and was just about let him have it
when a kangaroo jumped across in front of the car, causing the driver to hit
the brakes quickly. The Texan was badly shaken and being somewhat uneducated
in the case of fauna, asked &quot;What was that?&quot;

The Aussie shrugged and said, &quot;Damn grasshoppers.&quot;

I have found that if you love life, life will love you back.

She said: I overheard my father telling a family friend about my
newly-assigned mission in the U.S. Coast Guard. I work on a cutter that
escorts all cruise ships and international vessels under the bridges in
California's Bay Area.

But what my father told his friend was, &quot;She's involved in some sort of
escort service.&quot;

Being happy doesn't mean everything's perfect. It means you've decided to
see beyond the imperfections.

A man goes to the doctor with a swollen leg. After a careful examination,
the doctor gives the man a pill big enough to choke a horse.

&quot;I'll be right back with some water,&quot; the doctor tells him.

The doctor has been gone a while and the man loses patience. He hobbles out
to the drinking fountain, forces the pill down his throat and gobbles down
water until the pill clears his throat. He hobbles back into the examining
room.

The doctor comes back with a bucket of warm water. &quot;Ok, after the tablet
dissolves, soak that leg for at least 30 minutes.&quot;

Humpty Dumpty had a great fall but winter didn't look too promising.

A husband and wife were involved in a petty argument, both of them unwilling
to admit they might be in error. &quot;I'll admit I'm wrong,&quot; the wife told her
husband in a conciliatory attempt, &quot;if you'll admit I'm right.&quot;

He agreed and, like a gentleman, insisted she go first.

&quot;I'm wrong,&quot; she said.

With a twinkle in his eye, he responded, &quot;You're right!&quot;

Death is more universal than life. Everyone dies, but not everyone lives.

A boy is about to go on his first date, and is nervous about what to talk
about. He asks his father for advice. The father replies, &quot;Son, there are
three subjects that always work. These are food, family, and philosophy.&quot;

The boy picks up his date and they go to a soda fountain. Ice cream sodas in
front of them, they stare at each other for a long time, as the boy's
nervousness builds. He remembers his father's advice, and chooses the first
topic.

He asks the girl, &quot;Do you like potato pancakes?&quot;

She says, &quot;No.&quot; And the silence returns.

After a few more uncomfortable minutes, the boy thinks of his father's
suggestion and turns to the second item on the list.

He asks, &quot;Do you have a brother?&quot;

Again, the girl says, &quot;No.&quot; And there is silence once again.

The boy then plays his last card. He thinks of his father's advice and asks
the girl, &quot;If you had a brother, do you think he would he like potato
pancakes?&quot;

&quot;Love is saying 'I feel differently' instead of 'You're wrong.'&quot;
