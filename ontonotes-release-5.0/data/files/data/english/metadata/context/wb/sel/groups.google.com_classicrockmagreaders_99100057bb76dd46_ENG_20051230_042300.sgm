Greg,
Following your previous listing, I forgot to update you having spent
some time with my mate (Dave) who I previously advised you was going to
see Alice &amp; Twisted Sister.
Like you, he was not a particular fan of Twisted Sister prior to the
gig but he was/is a huge Alice fan, as is his wife (Dave's not Alice's
!).
Well I had a chat on this topic, refering him to you, I think we must
all accept that Alice was great (I have not seen him unfortunately).
However Dave was amazed at just how good Dee and his mates were. He is
now a thoroughly converted Twisted Sisiter (live) fan.
.
I have suggested before on a previous thread that sometimes, one's
opinion on a band can be effected by one's expectations before
arriving. This is a good example of that. We all expected Alice to be
great and he lived up to expectations however, in Dave's case at least,
he was not expecting much from TS and when they were great that left a
lasting impression, possibly a bigger impression than Alice, which is
no critisism of Alice just proof of my point regarding expectations.
Do you get my point or have I made a ass of myself, again ?
Woody

A very valid point Woody as I've experienced this myself once.

When I saw Aerosmith at Wembley Stadium in '99, the first support act
were 3 Colours Red about whom I didn't really know that much at the
time and didn't expect much from them....but they put on a blistering
performance and provided the best possible start to the gig. I've
since seen them a couple of times and own almost everything they've put
out.

yes, i have to say that twisted sister were indeed a better live band
than i was expecting...thats why it was so annoying that i missed most
of their set!

i think sometimes its better when u go to see a band without knowing
about them prior, that way having no preconceptions or bias

of course this doesnt necessarily mean the impression of the band will
be a good one!

Griz

I was at that gig but missed 3CR because I had my wallet nicked (or I
lost it) on the train, and I was down at the polis station. Luckily
the tickets were so big they wouldn't go in it so I had it in a
different pocket.

Woody

Definitely think you're on to something.

Deffinately! (did i spell that right??)
When i saw Motley Crue, the support act were great! and I was really
looking forward to checking them out on CD. I found one of their
singles in Steel Wheels for 99p, but found it sounded nothing like they
had that night! They sounded much 'rockier' and more heavy live (it
couldn't just have been those gigantic speakers?!) and although i like
the single, it still disappoints!

As said with Alice C + Twisted Sister, i was looking forward to TS
more, as i preffered them to AC, but both played a blinding set!
Couldn't quite figure out where Dee kept running off to though!
