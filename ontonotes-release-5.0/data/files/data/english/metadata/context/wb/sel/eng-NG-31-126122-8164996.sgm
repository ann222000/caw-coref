Sorry fish you've lost me there! There I was thinking it was all going
swimmingly and I go and *not follow* jokes.

I heard another joke at the pub last night. I told my mates that one I read
in here about the duck asking for grapes at the chemist and was told this
one in return:

A snail is drinking at the bar, he's getting pretty pissed and the barman
suggests he's had enough. The snail gets another one bought for him and
carries on drinking, but he starts getting really lary and starts singing
drunkenly. The barman tells him to quieten down a bit. The snail sings even
louder. Eventually the barman gets hold of the snail and kicks him out of
the pub.

A year later the snail comes back in the pub.

&quot;What did you do that for?&quot; says the snail.

I suppose there's a chance this was meant seriously---and, as scripture
tells us, chance is the fool's name for fate. So even though I'm not
ILGBBE perhaps I'll have a bash.

George's garden was technically more a landscape. He inherited an ecletic
series of gardens when he bought Friar Park. Sir Frank Crisp, its
original owner, had included designs such as a Japanese landscapes,
alpine and miniature gardens, Dutch, Elizabethan and Renaissance gardens,
and his affection for decorating with garden gnomes left its traces in
George's day as well.

George's interest seems to have been trees, mainly. He was a regular
patron of Engbers' Garden Centre in Henley and he bought a fair number of
saplings there over the years. If you see George's work in Friar Park
you're struck chiefly by the texture of foliage and treebark. He had a
nice feel for seasonal color as well and balanced his plantings nicely,
using preexisting lakes, streams and waterfalls as complementary elements
in the landscape.

I don't recall George being much into vegetable gardening---ornamentals
were much more his style, and on a small scale, herbs and perennials.

George also had a large, sprawling landscape at his home in Hawaii, a
garden not much appreciated by the locals because it was too sculpted and
deliberate. But it's what George liked.

If you can get past the annoying lady &quot;journalist&quot; you can see glimpses
of George in his element, and Olivia talking about him, here:

Excuse me Saki, but whilst I am still terrified of you, you should know me
by now. All of my posts are staunchly austere and to be read with furroweed
brow. (I prefer my posts to be referred to as &quot;minor dissertations&quot; btw). I
have an allotment in which I tend some of the finest vegetables in Blighty,
plucking a 2 pumpkins and 2 marrows only this very evening. I made a gift of
the produce to a mate of mine (called Rob) and to my next door neighbour.

Don't read my posts with a little high geeky voice, but with a kind of deep,
sexy James Bond type voice with a slight air of intelligence and a whiff of
authority.

Did you know that both Daniel Craig and Sylvester Stallone both supported
Everton?
So James Bond and Rocky both suppport Liverpool Football Clubs. (little
pieces of trivia that I know, a wealth of information I'll have you know)

Marrows?

I visited my grandparents this weekend, who sent me home with green beans,
silver queen corn, cucumbers and a big box of tomatoes. I went to the store
and bought some fatty meat for the green beans and corn, and we had a feast
on Sunday. Nothing like home-grown food.

You're lucky to have the room. I had a nice vegetable garden once,
planted zucchini (akin to your marrows). At the end of the summer my
workmates ran in terror everytime I brought another boxful of those
things into the office. There's such a thing as being too prolific.

See, I can't help but think of them in the first roles where I saw them.
So that leaves me with Ted Hughes and Stanley Rosiello support Liverpool,
which is a little more believable.

Not a chance, bad netiquette you know.

While I may not know George's favorite vegetable, I do know Ringo's least
favorite. And you may quote me.

You Yanks call them Zucchini which have been left to overgrow. If you pick
them before they become very large they are Courgettes to us real people in
the UK. The courgette (Zucchini)and the marrow are one and the same it's
just the marrow is a large version of it.

Asparagus.

In the UK, every citizen has the right to renyt a plot of land off the local
authority for growing  vegetables and other produce. Each person goes on a
waiting list and is subsequently alloted a plot of land (hence &quot;Allotment&quot;).
I only pay £12 a year for my 10 Rod plot (about 60feet by 20 feet). My
tomatoes have all died due to Blight this year. We have had the worst rain
in July since records began (before Love me Do). Many towns in the UK have
been flooded out...it's been baaaaaad maaan.

Daniel Craig grew up in Hoylake on the Wirral where my dad lives now, Sly
Stallone went to an Everton match last season at Goodison Park.

The local joke was, since he parked in Liverpool: &quot;did the wheels stay on

Oh, and sorry to hear about your garden and about the floods.  I hope your
cellar stayed dry (if you have one).  We've had a mostly dry summer here so
far but it's been damp this week.  It'll probably snow before September by
the look of things.  They are threatening frost tonight so there'd be my
