*We asked readers to share their stories of weight loss with us. Here,
Hardeep Singh, a 29-year-old businessman from Punjab, shares how he devised
a weight-loss programme that works:*

*E* ver since I remember I used to be fat. I was the fat kid in class, and
always had a plan for what I wanted to eat next. Being a Punjabi, food was
of paramount importance -- my mom and grandmother always insisted on oodles
of butter with paranthas in the morning; snacks were paneer pakoras and
chicken kathi rolls; lunch consisted of puri chole in desi ghee or mutton
biryani. If we went shopping in the evening at about 6 o'clock, we'd gorge
on tandoori chicken or fried fish, which was followed by butter chicken or
masala chicken with butter naans for dinner. Cake and gulab jamuns completed
the meal. For us, going out meant eating out.

After I completed my Plus 2, I went for higher studies to Australia and
there I ate like a pig -- everything from 8-inch pizzas to KFC and Mac
burgers. Sydney had the best buffet counters and I ate until I could not
breathe -- even then I'd do justice to the spread of desserts.

For a man of my age and my level of activity, around 2,200 calories per day
would be ideal to maintain a healthy weight, but gauging from the amount and
kinds of food I was eating, my daily intake was probably around 3,500 to
4,000 calories a day.

My friends at university would joke about my appearance, but all I cared
about was my food and what my next meal would be.

I came back to India after I completed my course, joined the family
business, got married and had a kid. While business was booming, I was
ballooning. I was so busy with work; taking care of myself took a backseat.

I had to go to Mumbai last summer for a business trip and took my wife and
kid along. As I was on the stairs boarding the airplane, holding my son, I
felt out of breath and could not stand. I was immediately given a seat and
the hostess offered me some water.

The flight took off eventually and I was left asking myself: &quot;Do I want to
die of heart attack at age of 28?&quot; I wanted to play football with my kid and
wanted to teach him how to ride a bike. But with my obese body, I could not
even climb the stairs with my kid leave alone play any kind of sport.

*Bolt from the sky*
I came back from my trip and went for a check-up. My cholesterol was 300,
way above the normal range of 200. At my height 5' 9&quot;, my weight was 94
kilos (20 kg over). My body mass index was 30, which should have been 25. I
was 28 but looked 10 years older with my physique. People my age would call
me uncle; my cousins who were older than me looked much younger than me.
That was a bolt that made me want to go from obese to normal.

*Getting into the groove*
I wanted to look young and fit -- my battle had begun. First, I started
visiting the gym for one and a half hours daily. I'd do cardio exercises as
instructed, but once out of the gym I used to eat like before.

I'd spend 30 minutes jogging on the treadmill, burning 350 calories, and
then have a KFC zinger burger, which in five minutes undid all my hard work.
This cycle continued for two months and my weight wouldn't budge -- I was
losing the battle.

That's when I began to browse websites and gathered information on how to
lose weight. I realised that until I began to eat right, I would not lose
weight. Portion control became my way of eating and regular walks became my
routine. Last August, at 94 kilos, I started my war against my weight.

This is the formula I adopted:
500 calories X 7 = 3500 calories
3500 calories = 1 pound

So, if I consumed 1000 calories less or burn 1000 calories more a day; I
would lose two pounds or about one kilo/week.

Following this mantra, I devised a new diet for myself.

~ For breakfast (9 am): 1 vegetable-stuffed roti with curd and a cup of tea

~ Pre-lunch snack (11 pm): 1 apple

~ Lunch (2 pm): A Subway sandwich (6 inches, no cheese) and juice OR two
chappatis, a bowl of dal and vegetables with lots of salad

~ Evening snack (4 pm): Sugar-free tea or coffee with two biscuits or fruit
salad

~ Dinner (7 pm): 2 chappatis or small bowl of rice with vegetables, dal and
a piece of tandoori chicken.

Fried foods, colas and sweets were cut out, but I'd indulge in some kheer or
chocolate pudding cooked with Sugarfree or Equal once in a while. Even while
eating out or at weddings I'd make sure to stick to my portion-control diet.
With this diet, and my faithful iPod with me, I began to walk and jog at
least 50 km every week.

I gradually began to lose weight, around a kilo a week and eventually by
year-end I was 18 kilos lighter, weighing in at 76 kilos. I felt great; I
went from 40-inch jeans to 34 inches; people would complement me; my wife's
friends would do double takes when I entered the room!

It's been almost six months now that I have maintained my weight at 76 kg.
My BMI is 24 which is normal and my cholesterol is 190. Although I no longer
follow my weight-loss diet, I choose to eat healthy food, and while eating
out I watch the portions I eat. Now I eat almost everything, but colas are
still a no-no.

Now when I see overweight people, I feel sorry because I know how bad it
feels and I want to help. When I travel abroad I am astonished to see how
the governments there work to make their nation fit. But we don't have this
yet. The number of people dying of heart-related diseases is growing, but
the government is yet to address this issue. I hope a time will come when we
take our bodies as seriously as we take other aspects of our lives.
