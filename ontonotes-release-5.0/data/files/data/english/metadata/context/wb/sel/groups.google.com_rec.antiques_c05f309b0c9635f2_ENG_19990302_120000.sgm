shaped like a tear that have a liquid in it.

they worth???????

"/> One of our most-asked questions - I guess I'll give the standard
reply and save everyone else the time. If I forget any details,
I'm sure someone will correct me ;)

What you have is called a &quot;fire grenade.&quot;
Designed as a home fire extinguisher, they were absolutely
useless.

The liquid inside is most likely carbon tectrachloride (a hazardous
chemical, used in dry cleaning - you can buy it in the store as
&quot;Thoro&quot; spot cleaner.) Be VERY careful in handling this item,
so that it does not break and expose you to a large amount of
fumes.

These are collectible, but some things affect value:

1 - Some colors are rarer than others (I don't know which.)

2 - Value, up until about 2-3 years ago, was generally placed
at $75 up in antique price guides (although I've NEVER seen
anyone buy one!) What happened 2-3 years ago? A large
warehouse full of these, &quot;mint in box,&quot; was found. They are
now much more plentiful than before, so not as mysterious.
I understand values/prices have fallen drastically for the type
that was &quot;discovered.&quot;

Interestingly, though, they seem to be a fairly &quot;hot&quot; (no pun
intended) item on eBay. eBay results show that 68 of them
have been sold in the past month or so -- with about 15 of them
selling for over $100; the rest for much less than that. What's
SCARY about this is that people are MAILING them to others
(and most likely NOT identified as hazardous chemicals, which
are prohibited by most shippers unless they are treated as
such.)
