Doubts Deepen About Acceptability of New US Military Command For
Africa

US officials say AFRICOM will boost African peacekeeping missions, but
the command has been the subject of heated debate on the continent
The new US military command for Africa - AFRICOM - recently became
operational, but will be based in Germany for the next year. After
this, it's expected to have headquarters in various African regions.
However, AFRICOM has already been condemned by many Africans as an
attempt by the United States to interfere politically in the
continent's affairs, to create a new arena for its war on terrorism
and to compete with China for access to African resources, such as
oil. American officials insist that while AFRICOM does indeed intend
to serve US interests, its primary aim is to make the world a safer
place by giving better training to African militaries. Nevertheless,
observers say Washington faces an uphill battle to make AFRICOM
acceptable to Africans. VOA's Darren Taylor reports, in the final part
of a series focusing on AFRICOM.

Wafula Okumu, of South Africa's Institute for Security Studies, is
just one of many observers of the AFRICOM process who describe it as a
&quot;public relations catastrophe&quot; for Washington.

General James Jamerson, the former deputy commander of American forces
in Europe, says the key to AFRICOM is obviously its acceptance in
Africa itself.

&quot;We have to be on the ground (in Africa), working from the bottom up,
talking to Africans about this concept. I think we just don't do this
well. But it's a recoverable kind of thing - if we just get out there
and do it,&quot; he says.

But the US, says Stewart Patrick who leads a project on weak states at
Washington's Center for Global Development, has so far failed to
&quot;sell&quot; AFRICOM - primarily because of &quot;bad communication.&quot;

Instead of being &quot;direct&quot; and acknowledging that the primary
motivation behind AFRICOM is the protection of US interests in Africa
- such as oil supplies and its war on terror - says Okumu, American
officials have instead concentrated on insisting that the command will
promote &quot;good governance&quot; and boost human development in Africa.

If Africans consider AFRICOM to be a threat to their sovereignty, and
a political threat, the initiative will fail, Okumu maintains.

Patrick says: &quot;The heads of the AFRICOM transition team, US diplomats
and also folks at the Department of Defense have actually not been
particularly good at explaining why AFRICOM is needed, and how its
mission will affect the other streams of US engagement on the
continent.&quot;

In order to ensure that Africans accept the command, he says, the US
will have to do a &quot;much better job&quot; of explaining its mission.

&quot;I have been struck, in Washington, despite having attended multiple
discussions about AFRICOM - including with officials from the
Department of Defense, State Department and elsewhere in government -
at the lack of clarity as to what practical difference it will
actually make (in Africa) on a day-to-day basis,&quot; Patrick comments.

But observers agree that there've been notable improvements in the
public relations skills of AFRICOM officials in recent times. Those
tasked with presenting the command to the world have appeared far more
relaxed in public, and far more candid in their public addresses.

Theresa Whelan, a key planner of AFRICOM and US deputy secretary for
African affairs at the Department of Defense, recently told a forum at
the American Enterprise Institute in Washington: &quot;I think it's
important for everyone to understand that we do not believe that we've
gotten this right. We are firmly convinced that we've probably screwed
it up somehow - but we're not quite sure exactly how.&quot;

Frankness such as this, says Okumu, is essential to AFRICOM's
acceptance in Africa.

Kurt Shillinger, of the South African Institute of International
Affairs, says the &quot;critical element&quot; is &quot;local buy-in. In building a
case for AFRICOM by African states, Washington is its own predecessor
- and in some cases, its own greatest obstacle.&quot;

He's convinced, though, that better US public relations won't
necessarily result in Africans embracing the new command.

&quot;Given the nature of the suspicion and the prevailing distrust of the
US in Africa, it's unlikely that any amount of public relations will
fully quench anti-imperialist concerns that AFRICOM is fundamentally
an attempt to create a bulwark in Africa against transnational
terrorism, or China's appetite for Africa's oil, minerals and timber,&quot;
Shillinger explains.

He does, however, expect that the &quot;dust will settle. The proposed
structure of AFRICOM, consisting of four to five relatively small
bases with no force deployments, means that these will be largely
invisible - even in their host countries and societies. That bodes
well for viability.&quot;

Analysts say the command stands a much better chance of acceptance if
Africans are convinced that AFRICOM - as its officials have stated
repeatedly - won't result in deployments of thousands of US troops to
the continent.

Patrick says the US will have to go to &quot;great lengths&quot; to try to make
sure that the creation of AFRICOM does not result in a &quot;very large
military footprint&quot; on Africa.

&quot;One way to do that would be to devote less energy to creating actual
standing military installations on the continent, and instead go in
the direction of negotiating a number of arrangements that would allow
US forces to deploy in existing installations under the control of
African governments in crises - dependent on the approval of the host
government,&quot; he counsels.

If concessions such as these are given to Africans, says Patrick, it
could ease their fear that AFRICOM will result in terrorists
increasingly targeting Africa.

Okumu says the command's establishment must secure an &quot;African
consensus&quot; - especially through the African Union, and that there
should be a guarantee that the sovereignty of African states will not
be compromised or undermined by AFRICOM. If such a &quot;formal&quot; assurance
is not given by the US, Okumu says, &quot;new and grave threats and
challenges to the continent's peace and security agenda&quot; will occur.

He also advises Washington to make it a &quot;high priority&quot; to open
dialogue about AFRICOM with African civil society groups. Many of
these organizations, says Okumu, have greater power even than
politicians in setting the tone for public debate, and many of them
remain vehemently opposed to AFRICOM.

Okumu appeals to Washington to &quot;broaden&quot; its consultations about the
command in Africa, arguing that talks about the US military plans have
so far been &quot;very limited to bureaucrats within the AU&quot; and that news
about AFRICOM hasn't filtered down to the public. This has created
room for opponents of AFRICOM to &quot;speculate&quot; about the nature of the
command, he adds.

Okumu says AFRICOM officials have had insufficient contact with the
Pan African Parliament, as well as with regional bodies such as the
Southern African Development Community.

Peter Pham, the Director of the Nelson Institute for International and
Public Affairs at James Madison University in the US, also warns that
Africans remain &quot;heavily scarred by the role that African militaries
have played in their countries' politics, and that has to be taken
into consideration&quot; as well, and could influence AFRICOM's acceptance
on the continent.

Ultimately, says Okumu, the US command will be accepted if it
complements existing African initiatives.

But Patrick is convinced that Washington will have to demonstrate
action, rather than mere words, if Africans are to eventually accept
AFRICOM.

&quot;If the US Department of Defense and other US officials are able to
show how, in practical terms, AFRICOM can make a difference in
reducing internal conflict, in bringing hope and fighting some of the
underlying causes of underdevelopment and misery in different parts of
the continent, then I think it stands a decent chance of getting wider
acceptance.&quot;

But Jamerson says the US shouldn't spend too much time on trying to
gain &quot;universal&quot; acceptability for AFRICOM.

&quot;There are currents that flow in Africa that are just not going to buy
the concept. It doesn't mean you can't work with the leaders of
Africa; it just means that the public face.... is not going to be as
positive as getting the work done. But that doesn't mean you quit
trying,&quot; he states.

General Tsadkan Gebretensae, former Ethiopian Defense Force chief,
warns that AFRICOM is at a &quot;crossroads.&quot;

&quot;There is the potential to have a very constructive engagement
(between Washington and Africa), and there is a great deal of
potential for a very negative effect....&quot;

Okumu agrees that the months ahead will be &quot;critical&quot; for AFRICOM, and
will forever change the US's relationship with the continent.
