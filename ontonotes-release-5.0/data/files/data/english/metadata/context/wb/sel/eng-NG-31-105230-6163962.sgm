BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE : Data
Leak at VSNL : RCOM man quizzed

MUMBAI: The Mumbai police on Wednesday interrogated a Reliance Communications
(RCOM) official in connection with alleged espionage at the Tata Group-owned
Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), a police officer told ET. The official will be
again called for interrogation as and when needed, the officer added.

The
case involves leakage of sensitive boardroom documents and information relating
to VSNL's future plans. On Wednesday, VSNL filed a second FIR under the IT Act
against Prashant Indulkar, personal secretary to VSNL managing director N
Srinath, for alleged data theft from the company. The earlier FIR was filed
under Section 408 of the Indian Penal Code (criminal breach of trust by an
employee) and alleged that Mr Indulkar had siphoned off Rs 8.7 lakh from the
company.

The
second FIR, filed with the Dadar police station late on Wednesday, alleges that
Mr Indulkar leaked confidential information about the company's plans and
strategies to a rival firm.

The
Mumbai police had arrested Mr Indulkar on February 1 after the first FIR.
During interrogation, Mr Indulkar had revealed the identity of the RCOM
official, the police officer added. Mr Indulkar had also made several calls to
this official in the past few months, police said. On Wednesday, police
summoned the RCOM official and interrogated him for nearly four hours in the
presence of Mr Indulkar. The RCOM official was let off after interrogation but
police said they will be calling him again. "We will call him again.

It's
going to be a long-drawn investigation as it seems to be a big network of data
theft," the police officer added.

Mr
Indulkar is in police remand till Thursday.

Police
is likely to seek an extension of remand when the case comes up for hearing at
the Bhoiwada court in Dadar.

PREACHERS : Security Experts
Aren't So Secure At RSA Conference
A
majority of those with wireless devices fail to make them secure while
attending the security conference, says AirDefense .

For a group of people who should know better, attendees at the
RSA Conference -- one of the biggest security conferences in the world --
aren't following the advice they give their customers, co-workers, and friends.
As a result, many are not as secure as they think they are.

Analysts
at AirDefense, a wireless monitoring company, ran a scan on wireless devices at
the conference Tuesday at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Of the 347 laptops, smartphones, and hand-held devices
they monitored between 9:30 a.m. and 5 p.m., 56% of them weren't secure.

Those
devices had been set up to link to insecure wireless access points like those
found at hotels and Starbucks cafes. The problem, says Richard Rushing, chief
security officer of AirDefense, is that when users are done using the
connection, they don't change their devices' policy settings that let them
connect to insecure access points. That means when their Blackberrys or laptops
are on at the conference center, they could easily hook up to a rogue access
point set up by a hacker.

Last year at
the RSA conference, AirDefense found that 35% of wireless devices were insecure . But not as many people had
wireless devices at the show with them. This year, says Rushing, there are more
computers at the show with wireless capabilities, and more of them are at risk.

"It's
a little surprising the percentage is actually that high," says Rushing,
who is attending the conference "It just shows that there's a huge
prevalence of wireless devices, and [people] aren't aware that they're putting
themselves at risk."

A
hacker could set up a rogue access point and send off a signal pretending to be
a legitimate wireless access point. A laptop is set to run through its list of
access points every 30 to 90 seconds, depending on its settings. If it comes
across a stronger connection, it will simply pick it up. If that's a rogue
connection, then the hacker has access to everything that's passing through it.

"It's
all about manipulation," says Rushing. "With that connection you
made, you're already doomed. You're setting yourself up for trouble. Most
people leave the hotel, but that hotel is still in their machines' inner
policy. So when they go to the show, they should turn off their wireless or
change their policy to remove any access points they're not currently using. If
you connect at Starbucks, when you leave, you should hit disconnect instead of
just closing the browser."

Rushing
adds that hackers know a lot of people aren't aware of the issue, which leaves
them at risk. For hackers, this is just "low hanging fruit," he
warns, adding that IT managers need to educate their road worriers as soon as
they get back in the office.

FUTURE SHOCK : Cyberattacks
Up 50% By 2010, VeriSign Says
As
long as cybercrime continues to grow as an industry, don't count on malicious
attacks to abate on their own, the company's CEO says.

VeriSign's
unveiling Thursday of Project Titan, which seeks to expand the capacity of its
global Internet infrastructure by 10 times by 2010, will be both a blessing and
a bane to Internet users, creating a wider freeway for access to revolutionary
new multimedia content while at the same time creating a greater number of
targets for malicious attackers.

Cyberattacks
will increase by 50% between now and Project Titan's completion, VeriSign CEO
and chairman Stratton Sclavos said Thursday during his RSA Conference keynote.
As long as cybercrime continues to grow as an industry, don't count on
malicious attacks to abate on their own. "Where the money goes, so do the
threats," he added.

While
it's easy, not to mention good business, for security vendors to predict gloom
and doom for the IT industry, Sclavos' point was punctuated by Tuesday's
massive denial-of-service attack against the 13 servers that help manage
worldwide Internet traffic. This was a sophisticated attack consisting of
"very, very large packets," Sclavos said. "Every request [made
by those packets] was bogus, and every [packet] source was false."

Even
worse, it was a sophisticated attack that "was very simple to deploy and
scales phenomenally well," Sclavos said. "In fact, we're convinced
that the perpetrators didn't even know how well it scales."

But
the VeriSign CEO pointed the finger at himself and his colleagues in the
security space, rather than dwelling on the attackers.

"Shame on all
of us in this room who are security vendors ," he said. " If we force our customers to choose between ease of use
and better security, they will always choose simplicity . We have the
security technology and have had it for years. Yet our consumers feel more
vulnerable today than they've ever felt."

Still,
it's not impossible for organizations to beat back the bad guys. Sclavos
pointed to PayPal, one of the companies most targeted by attackers, as a
company that has had some security success because it's taken the threats
seriously.

"They
are using (Extended Validation SSL Certificates) to be sure users don't make a
phishing site for PayPal's site," he added.

Microsoft
announced that it has enabled support for these certificates in Internet
Explorer 7. When a user visits a site with a valid EV SSL Certificate, IE 7
alerts the user to the available identity information by turning the background
of the address bar green and displaying identity information. Twelve
certificate authorities, including VeriSign, Cybertrust, and Entrust, issue EV
SSL Certificates.

Certificate
authorities won't issue EV SSL Certificates without first making the
organization go through a stringent sign-up process, says Michael Barrett,
PayPal's chief information security officer. In addition, PayPal next week will
begin offering certain clients, businesses, and possibly those who've been the
victim of past fraud pass code-generating tokens for securely logging on to
their PayPal accounts.

Barrett
admits there's no easy way to keep bogus e-mailers (known as phishers) and
other bad elements at bay, but that's no excuse for not trying, even if it
means forcing cybercriminals to change their tactics. "There's no silver
bullet," he says. "It's how much lead can you get in the air from a
shotgun."

FOLLOW-UP : Lessons learned
from Internet root server attack
By
Carolyn Duffy Marsan,
Network
World,

Theres
some good news and some bad news for corporate network managers about the
latest Internet root server attack.

The
good news is that the Internet demonstrated once again that it is the most
resilient network infrastructure ever built. Companies shouldnt be afraid to
put mission-critical applications such as voice and streaming video on the `Net
because of these attacks, security experts say.

The
bad news is that that the Internet continues to be a target for vandals and
criminals, particularly those looking to make money through extortion, fraud or
theft. Experts say that most corporate Web sites and IP networks couldnt
withstand the ferocity of the latest attacks.

"These
attacks werent that substantial," says Danny McPherson, chief research
officer for Arbor Networks, which provides detection services for these types
of attacks. "Theyve gotten a lot of attention, but theyre not as
significant as the attacks we see every day against our customers, which are
much more targeted and more damaging."

Steve
Bellovin, an Internet security expert and professor of computer science at
Columbia University, agrees.

"Id
be more worried about somebody trying to target my corporation than somebody
trying to target the infrastructure because no one corporation has the kind of
replication and bandwidth that the infrastructure has at this point,"
Bellovin says.

On
Tuesday, an attack was launched against three of the Internets 13 root
servers, which oversee the Internets Domain Name System. The DNS is a global
distributed database system that matches domain names with corresponding IP
addresses.

Three
root servers operated by the Defense Department, the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the Widely Integrated Distributed
Environment (WIDE) Project were inundated with phony requests from a group of
compromised PCs, called a botnet.

Michael
Witt, deputy director of US-CERTs cybersecurity section, who spoke at a panel
discussion at the RSA Conference last week, said the DNS root server attack was
targeted at three root servers, known as G, L and M. G is the militarys
top-level domain, Witt said. According to information at the US-CERT Web site,
L operates on behalf of ICANN, and M is dedicated to the WIDE Project.

The
attacks didnt impact the root-level servers," Witt said. They continued
to do their job. The Department of Defense had no impact toward degradation on
their network.

Witt
said mitigation of the attack was carried out with the help of the North American
Network Operators Group. We worked closely with those in the organization to
minimize that attack, he said.

While
these three root servers were disrupted by the botnet attack, 10 other root
servers worked fine. Overall, the Internets service suffered little
disruption, and few corporate users even noticed that the attacks were
happening.

"This
attack was maybe one-tenth of the size of earlier attacks that weve seen on
the DNS infrastructure," McPherson says. "It wasnt really that
large, and it started tapering off quickly. More importantly, the user
experience was not that far degraded."

This
was the first major attack against the root servers since 2002, when all 13
root servers were targeted in a more severe distributed denial-of-service (DOS)
attack.

"The
oddest thing about this attack is that it happened at all," Bellovin says.
"We havent had any major pure vandalism attacks in the last few years.
The energy in the hacking world has shifted to a profit motive. Most of the
DDOS attacks we see are for extortion. Sports gambling sites are especially
affected."

Howard
Schmidt, former White House cybersecurity adviser and now president and CEO of
Issaquah, Washington-based R&amp;H Security Consulting, said the fact that the
attack on the DNS root servers this week had no perceivable impact on the
public indicates how resilient the underlying system is. But we shouldnt let
our guard down, Schmidt says.

Schmidt
recalled how the massive attack in February 2002, when he was White House
cyber-security adviser, also had no perceivable public impact but it did draw
attention to the potential for grave consequences in loss of the Internet.

"We
didnt find out who was doing it in 2002," Schmidt says. "Until we
catch the people doing it, well never know their motivation."

Good news

Security
experts say that the latest demonstration of the Internets resilience points
to a rosy future for all things IP. Thats because the DNS -- which is critical
to the routing of all information on the Internet has proven itself against
many and varied attacks over the years.

Since
the 2002 root server attack, some root server operators have rolled out a
technique called Anycast to copy information to multiple computers around the
world.

"The
name servers are more resilient to this type of attack today then they were
five years ago," Bellovin says. "Its not that any given server is
more resilient; its that the structure as a whole is more resilient because
they are using Anycast servers. There are a lot more servers out there, so the
attackers might not get all of them."

The
failure of the latest attack shows how hard it is for a hacker to bring down
the DNS.

"It
seems unlikely that someone can take down all the root servers," says
Scott Perry, founder of DNSstuff.com, which provides DNS tools to IT
professionals. "While there are 13 root servers, these servers are
mirrored so that over 100 servers handle the queries that go to the root
server. Each of the root servers has one IP address, but in some cases those IP
addresses are anycast to as many as 40 different computers. Because of that,
when an attack like this occursit will only affect users near one
location."

Attacks
like these are no reason for corporations to hold off on migrating key
applications such as voice to the Internet, experts say.

"The
threats for something like VoIP are more within the enterprise than within the
Internet infrastructure," Bellovin says. "Youre much more likely to
have a virulent infection that takes you out than a root server attackThere
are more problems near the edges of the Internet than in the
infrastructure."

Bad news

Despite
the positive outcome of the latest attacks, security experts warn against
complacency.

"I
dont know if a serious effort could take out the root server system,"
Bellovin says. "Weve heard of some really large botnetsThe steps that
have been taken since 2002 have made the network considerably more robust and
resilient in the face of this kind of attack. We dont know if its robust or resilient
enough yet."

A
botnet attack like this one would be more significant if it damaged the DNS
servers that run key domains such as .com or .net. Thats because the root
servers handle far fewer queries than the .com and .net servers.

"Theres
more impact at the next level down below the root," says Ken Silva, chief
security officer for VeriSign, which operates two root servers as well as the
registries for .com and .net. "The .com servers handle 450,000 queries per
second. If they dont work, thats 450,000 queries per second that fail to
connect."

Protecting
against these kind of attacks is why VeriSign announced this week a three-year,
$100 million effort to upgrade and expand the servers and network
infrastructure that support its .com, .net and root servers. Dubbed Project
Titan, the initiative will increase the capacity of VeriSigns network
infrastructure 10 times by 2010.

Project
Titan will "make the entire infrastructure that we operate much more
resilient to these attacks," Silva says. It is "without a doubt the
largest upgrade to a DNS top-level domain thats ever happened."

Few
companies, government agencies or universities that run the DNS root servers on
a voluntary basis can afford the kind of investment that VeriSign is making
with Project Titan.

Corporate
network managers also need to stay ahead of the game by continuing to invest in
distributed DNS servers of their own.

McPherson
says few corporations could withstand the kind of attack aimed at the three
root servers this week.

"This
was a 2G to 3Gbps attack," he says. "That could take most enterprises
offline pretty easilyAttacks like this are pretty easy to launch."

McPherson
says Arbor Networks saw DNS amplification attacks as large as 22G to 25Gbps
during 2006. "They were pretty ugly, and the scale of those attacks was
pretty large," he says. "The root servers are pretty resilient but
most enterprises are not."

Top New IT Term of the day
DMI
Short for Desktop Management Interface, an API to
enable software to collect information about a computer environment. For
example, using DMI a program can determine what software and expansion boards
are installed on a computer.

DMI is designed to be platform -independent and
operating system -independent so that programs can make the same function calls
to collect information no matter what system they're running in. This system
independence is implemented by collecting information from MIF files, which are
plain text files containing information about a software or hardware component.

DMI was designed by the Desktop Management Task Force
(DMTF), a consortium of hardware manufacturers led by Intel. Version 2.0 allows
a central computer not only to gather information about computers connected to
a network, but also to configure them. PCs that comply with DMI 2.0 are
sometimes called managed PCs.
