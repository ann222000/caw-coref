Hey, Everyone,

Bob Bailey and I discussed the Click-L list a bit over the weekend and
remembered the days when it was &quot;THE&quot; list for clicker training on the
Internet. Karen Pryor started it with Kathleen Weaver as moderator.
(Kathleen, if you're there and I'm telling it incorrectly, please pipe
up!)

A while back, as most of you recall, Kathleen turned the list over to
Cindi Lashinsky, who invited me to join her as moderator. At the
moment I am the sole moderator of the Click-L list. During the
transfer of moderator-ship the list was moved a couple of times,
searching for a suitable server, and finally settled in at Google
Groups.

Once the move took place things got pretty quiet around good old
Click-L, but I think it's time to breathe new life into it, and I'll
tell you why. The original Click-L was about clicker training from a
behavior analytic perspective. Vigorous debate occured over technique,
theory and practice, but it stayed behavior analytic in nature.
Operant conditioning! Respondent conditioning! Intermittent
schedules! Reinforcer effectiveness! Oh my!

I would like to engage in that kind of debate and discussion again...
controlled with moderation to ensure that nastiness is quelled while
the free flow of ideas is encouraged. I'd like to have a list where
the fact that Clicker Training is a technology developed in the science
of behavior analysis is front and center.

There are a lot of fine lists online today, and they each have a
different focus. The focus of this list would be to keep the science
of behavior analysis in clicker training, to keep clicker training true
to its roots, and grounded in good science. I'm honestly a bit
concerned about clicker training getting &quot;soft&quot;, or diluted. I'd like
Click-L to be the place to come to get the skinny on operant
conditioning in animal training. And to have a good, energetic
discussion!

What do you think? Are you in?

"/> Oh, Kellie, I am SOOOO in!!! Having been apart of several lists that claim

outright incorrect information being passed (albeit as opinion most times)
in discussions on crating dogs, homeopathic remedies, softening techniques
to make them more 'classroom friendly', etc.

One of my greatest frustrations in my chosen dog sport of Agility is seeing
the ways that clicker training (or &quot;mark and reinforce&quot; training) is watered
down or combined with traditional methods to form hybrids that are less
effect in training the dog but more reinforcing for the trainer in many
ways. There seems to be a desire on the part of many dog trainers to take a
&quot;more compassionate&quot; approach than the science of operant conditioning and
clicker training as a technology seems to offer. The desire of many
trainers to &quot;help&quot; the dog learn with unnecessary prompting, verbalizing,
and luring seems to me to only inhibit the learning process.

Both scientific method and critical thinking have played an important role
in my success as a trainer with my own dog. Taking the notion of &quot;proofing&quot;
to its logical scientific conclusions have led me to some surprising
discoveries about what my dog really does and doesn't know! Without that
dedication to letting the data (and not my feelings or desires) tell the
story, I'm not sure I would have the dog I have today.

So, ok, enough of the perhaps over-zealous ranting of a &quot;born-again&quot; clicker
trainer, tell me what I can do to help you get Click-L going in this new
direction.

I very much like what you've outlined for Click-L and will be an eager
participant and student. I'm sure I still have a lot to learn.

Thanks for the well-timed and well worded message.

Hi Kellie,

I'm more of a lurker than a debater but I'd be very interested in
Click-L as the definitive clicker list.Try to make it as jargon-free
as possible or be sure to explain terms or have a &quot;glossary&quot; for
those who are not in the behavior field professionally.

Looking forward to hearing from others.

Actually the truth is, I started it, but only after getting Karen's
blessings. I was an member of the obedience email list (back when there
weren't many lists) and found it frusterating because they deeply
discouraged any discussion of clicker training. Especially the level I
wanted to do it at, which was purely at the behavior level.

I had the technology in place, since I already ran a police dog training
list. I actually ran the thing using a server and an dedicated phone line
out of my house!

Yes, yes, my sentiments exactly. There seems to be a lot of fuzzy logic on
a lot of the lists, even to the point of making it difficult to talk about
behavior analysis because it might be &quot;too controversial&quot;. Well, folks,
clicker training is a technology based in the science of behavior analysis
that goes back to the 1930s. You can't strip the behavior analysis out of
clicker training because that's where clicker training comes from. Many
groups want clicker training to be its own phenomenon, but it simply isn't.

Good point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;There seems to be a desire on the part of many dog trainers to take a &quot;more

training &gt;as a technology seems to offer.

This is one of my current frustrations. Lots of groups and trainers are
popping up that are tied to words like &quot;relationship&quot; and &quot;leadership&quot; and
resist the behavior that makes up those terms. And we must be careful not
to step on the toes of the animal communicator but it's perfectly okay to
insult the behavior analyst by declaring that we don't care about animals'
feelings and want to oversimplify everything.

My response is ... I take data. Let the psychic put her data on the table
and let's compare notes.

Another concern is that people are too tied to the past, and often it's not
an accurate past. The resistance to my aggression work is unbelievable and
I haven't even finished the project nor presented it in full. Why? Because
you're supposed to treat aggression with desensitization, everyone does it
that way, therefore it's the only way. Never mind that it takes forever.
And historically speaking, a whole lot of people think clicker training
started in the 1980s and 90s. That's just when it was popularized. Not a
bad thing, mind you! I'm eternally grateful that it was popularized or I
wouldn't be in this conversation! It just chops off 50+ years of important
work that got it to the point that the average pet owner can successfully
clicker train a dog or cat.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The desire of many trainers to &quot;help&quot; the dog learn with unnecessary

"/> prompting, verbalizing, and luring seems to me to only inhibit the learning

That's true, too. I will admit that sometimes I go to seminars and find
myself confused. I have to step back and consciously &quot;look at the behavior&quot;
and painstakingly brush away the distracting and unnecessary verbiage and
complexity. I think people find the use of a lot of complex words and
knowledge about a lot of complex theories socially reinforcing. An
important point that is often missed is that PARSIMONY is at the heart of
good science. In other words, KEEP IT SIMPLE!

Yes! Isn't it remarkable? When you stop talking and take data sometimes
you realize things you absolutely missed... Or that are quite different from
what you thought.

too!

I'm excited. Let's get the word out that Click-L is undergoing a revival
and is aiming to be THE place for behavior analytic discussions of animal
training.

I will have to show my true colors. When things get off track
scientifically, I will guide them back, as gently as possible, but firmly.
We won't be a list about psychics, herbal remedies, breeding &amp; genetics or
leadership. We're going to discuss the behavior of animals in terms of
teaching and problem resolution and the related behavior of the people that
are associated with those animals.

Thanks, Ina,

Thanks for the insight. I think jargon will be a necessity, but I'll work
on compiling a glossary. When a term comes up that isn't clear, ask for a
definition. I'll create a page on my website. Also there are some good
glossaries online already. I'll try to compile a set of links to those.

I would like this to be both a teaching opportunity, but also provide a
place for advanced discussions that may reach the point of healthy debate.
In fact, in a moment I'm going to post a separate note about that.

Or perhaps Old Guidelines revived???

1) Behavior analysis in animal training is the focus of Clik-L.

2) Discussion is invited and encouraged on Click-L.

3) Disagreements will NOT be automatically quashed.

4) Personal attacks and flames will be promptly dealt with.

5) It is possible for good people to disagree. When another person has a
viewpoint that differs from yours, it does not mean he or she is now the
enemy. It means he or she has an opinion that differs from yours.

6) If you suspect you have hurt someone's feelings, address it, either
privately or on the list. It is not unprofessional or demeaning to
apologize. It is not inappropriate to apologize to someone who has a
dramatically different viewpoint from your own.

7) If someone rubs you the wrong way, don't read or respond to their posts.

8) This is not the place to discuss alternative medicine, psychic
phenomenon, folk remedies, raw diets, or other non-behavior analytic ideas
or products, except as specifically related to behavior analytic principles.
I'm afraid I'll have to be the judge of what fits the criterion.

9) Personal chit-chat should be kept to a minimum and taken offline if it
goes beyond a post or two. I want us to be a friendly group, but not a
social chat group. There are a lot of groups online where such discussion
is appropriate and welcomed.

10) If I shut down a conversation or otherwise engage in management, it is
not personal. It's about achieving the goal of having a list where in depth
discussions of animal training from a behavior analytic perspective can be
held without getting way off track.

11) ALL SPECIES WELCOMED! Most clicker lists are species specific. In an
article prior to his lecture last week, Bob was quoted as saying that you
train an octopus the same way you train a dog. Find out what he likes and
give it to him in exchange for playing your games. I believe that training
a variety of species makes you a better trainer.

I agree. I've recently really backed off from the majority of lists just
because I'm not getting anything new. It is important to provide the
basics. I started learning online. But those who have been doing it for a
while want to get into the nitty gritty.

I think we can do that! I will probably start to build a glossary sort of

rudimentary definition, and advanced aspects may be discussed here.

Hi Jim,

So glad you've joined.

I think the jargon needs to be used, in the way I understand the definition
of jargon anyway. Using the correct terms will help with our understanding
of what one another is talking about.

Sandy, I know you know and understand most of the same jargon I do. We can
learn, understand and utilize more together on the list. Along with many
others.

&gt;&gt; clicker training because that's where clicker training comes from.
&gt;&gt; Many groups want clicker training to be its own phenomenon, but it simply

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I'm afraid I don't understand what this means.

"/> It simply means that clicker training emerged from behavior analysis and the
science of operant conditioning, and no where else. It started with B.F.
Skinner, Keller and Marian Breland, and Norman Guttman. The first
free-shaping happened on the top of the General Mills flower building when
they shaped a pigeon they'd just caught to bowl.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I hope this new list format doesn't forget the importance of ethology,

Classical conditioning is part of behavior analysis, so that's a given.
Ethology and physiology will be relevant here in terms of behavior, although
the main focus will be behavior analytic principles and procedures as the
foundation of clicker training. No discussion will be cut off because
ethology or physiology comes into it, although discussions recommending
herbal remedies and psychic phenomenon may be redirected. In fact, I think
vigorous discussions about the role of ethology and physiology in the
behavior of the organism would be valuable and fun! But yes, the emphasis
will be on behavior analysis. This is truly where clicker training came
from. Way back when.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I don't resist your aggression work at all. What I take issue with is your

behavior. I have &gt;never yet seen that happen with all the dogs I have
worked with.

That's certainly a valid observation! Sadly a few people have taken it to
task despite the fact that no one has seen the whole enchillada yet except
me and Jesus Rosales.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> clicker training, then you'll have to define what is your description of the
canonical clicker &gt;training, what's &quot;allowed&quot;, what's not.

I don't want this list to have the true corner on clicker training
ad-finitum-the-end. Just a different kind of discussion opportunity.
Advanced discussions aren't available on other lists, and there is room for
that kind of list now that dozens of other clicker lists exist today. There
are other list that discuss a lot of other aspects of clicker training and
many of them are quite valuable... they just have a different focus. This
list will fill a specific niche. It will be about the scientific basis of
clicker training--and how cool that is. It will give us a chance to get
back to the principles. We will discuss reinforcement and punishment and
extinction. We will discuss ratio schedules and interval schedules. We
will problem solve and trouble shoot. We'll collect and discuss data. We
will discuss training dogs and bears and elephants. Hopefully we'll draw
some zoo trainers and parrot trainers into the fold as well as dog people.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;May I lure behaviors or not? May I lure them 3 times, 10 times, or how many

"/> and still fit this list's definition?

There's no definition for anything like that. You can lure a 1,000 times if
you'd like and still be quite welcomed here. I can see discussion on that
topic being quite valuable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Again, I guess we need a description of what it is we are all lacking (othr

"/> than degrees in BA).

No one is lacking anything, Helix. But there is not a list that I know of
that's sticking to the focus of clicker training as a technology that came
from behavior analysis, which honest-to-God is where clicker training came
from. This will just be a more specialized list, hailing back to its roots.
There are dozens of clicker lists on the Internet for general discussions of
clicker training, clicker training with an ethological bent, clicker
training mixed with traditional training, etc. This will be more of a
purist's list.

I understand that it may not be for everyone, but since the list was not
particularly active, I decided that it would be appropriate for Click-L to
be revived to fill a void. I believe that one reason it wasn't active is
that there were plenty of other lists that provided the same thing. This
list will provide something different.

One does not need a degree in behavior analysis to belong. One will learn
about behavior analysis by participating.

I doubt if it can go back to what it was. That was a long time ago, and the
clicker training world has changed.

Unfortunately I think there has been some blurring of the lines about what
clicker training is. I hope this list will be able to get us back to the
basics... simplify! Simplify!

Well, I would hope that no one would make the claim that any source has the
&quot;true corner&quot; on clicker training. I certainly didn't take that from
Kellie's writing so far. I understood that Kellie would like to shape the
list by focusing on a behavioral analysis approach and putting the science

I saw no claim that Click-L is &quot;THE&quot; list or that the discussions here would

One of the most important things I took away from Clicker Expo last year was
the suggestion that you &quot;fade the prompt as soon as you can&quot; in order to
help the dog learn what works and what doesn't. It was an incredibly
important point for me in seeing that the dog's awareness of their choice is
critical to the learning process. That said, a &quot;lure&quot; is just a &quot;prompt&quot;
that uses food to get a reinforceable behavior.

I think a more focused question would be: What are the relative pros and
cons of using food as a prompt? The ensuing discussion would be interesting
if people could put forward actual data on how many reps it took to teach a
given behavior with a food lure as the prompt compared to teaching the same
behavior using a different prompt (body cue, space pressure, etc.) or
capturing. Alternatively, I would be interested in data showing the effects
of fading the &quot;lure&quot; prompt more or less quickly effects learning.

I don't think a list that is focused on a &quot;scientific&quot; approach to dog (or
any animal) is a bad think. There are plenty of alternatives out there for
those who find the behavioral analysis approach too &quot;cold&quot; for their tastes.

Totally with you on this. Hiding from something a person don't care for
does not change what it does. There are many times when Negative
Reinforcement or punishment of some type is necessary. It's in the learning
when each is best applied that I for one, need for knowledge of.

Your explanations on aggression have made me think a lot about how the same
principals could be used in different situations.

That's how I started learning this stuff. Some people explained stuff to
me. Then they had conversations with peers that I was able to eavesdrop on
even though I didn't understand the concepts yet. Gradually I learned. Now

Good afternoon Jim, and all.

I am 68 years old and spent most of my life
training and competing in dog shows, trials, and
agility. Jumping horses for a few years and
're-training' pets who had very bad behavior
problems. This was usually caused by bad training,
rarely bad brains in the animal.

I finished my last Bullmastiff AKC Ch. a few
months ago and I am now totally retired.

My epilepsy has got too bad for me to travel and
compete any more. Duncan is my four and a half
year old GSD Service Dog/seizure alert dog.

I first read BF Skinner in 1947, I was ten. I have
never lived one day of my life without dogs, cats
and usually other critters. My family came here
from Scotland in 1944. Both my grandmothers were
animal trainers, maternal trained highland
sheepdogs for trials and paternal trained horses.
They didn't use clickers but did train by similar
to what is now called OC, over 110 years ago.

When I read some of what Skinner had learned and
was learning I knew immediately the science behind
why clicker training works. I got a 'frog' from my
dad, he used them in his theater to communicate
with the help. I 'taught' my horse to shake hands
in a couple of minutes and I was hooked for life.

Look around you, watch nature movies on Animal
Planet, read about the evolution of humans, and
etc. Operant Conditioning, &quot;bouncing around the
world, doing what you do, until you encounter a
reinforcing stimulus,&quot; is how God set up the world
to work.

Without OC wild animals and humans would have
starved and died out millions of years ago. Since
physicists learned about, and used, gravity so
that the Space Program can work, so we know that
we still are learning about how God set up the
world to work.

Now BF Skinner was an atheist, so for him it was
just the way the world works.

Yes, you can change human or animal behavior with
a jerking leash or punishments like hitting or
pinching. However, to the best of my recollection
a hand has never come down out of the sky and
whacked me when I ate a bowl of ice cream.( Now we
get to the technicalities which I continue to
learn) I think the negative reinforcer is that the
next time I go to town my clothes don't fit as
well. When I was obsessive about the grooming and
training of my dogs, we won in the ring. When I
always pick up after my dogs, who are trained to
&quot;potty,&quot; or Poop&quot;, we become welcome anywhere.
People even stop to congratulate me for doing this
which makes me feel good. And on and on.

OC lets us, and if done well, our dogs also, learn
by our own actions and therefore we grow. Mentally
mostly but also emotionally and sometimes morally.

My dogs live with me in the country and never have
a leash on unless we are going to a town or city
with traffic. They seem to me to be much more
adult in their attitudes than dogs which are
always leash tied to their human. I can see them
thinking about what to do, then making a decision.
If they make a 'less than good' decision we just
ignore the face full of mud or the pup in the
catfish pond or whatever. The pup has learned a
lesson that I could never teach. This is OC at work.

The wild animals around here are no longer afraid
of me or the dogs( except for the rabbits).
I won't go into the method, which I think is also
OC, but it always works. We sit on the deck
watching the deer a few feet out from the yard
fence in the pasture. I love seeing the babies in
the spring. The Coyote pack comes up to the fence
and sings with my dogs for several minutes on
clear hunting nights. There were bird nests built
on the deck last year and clutches of eggs laid
and babies raised. Sometimes, since I only shut
the door when the temp. gets down below 30, the
birds fly into the house and sometimes sit on my
shoulder. This is how the world can work when fear
is taken out of the equation and the animals are
left to figure things out by themselves, OC.

The first time I see a pup go sit by the dog
table (this is a large rubber backed rug in the
yard) I bring him out a fresh piece of raw
venison for lunch. (yes we eat the deer, but a
neighbor now shoots them for me, back in the
forest, and yes this too is how God set up the
world to work) I never have to use the meat to
lure since, after the first taste, when I say sit
at the dog table they all do. They have the lure
locked in their own minds.

If bored, bad weather usually, Duncan will go get
a clicker and drop it in my lap. He will then do
something, stretch-wave-yawn-wag hard and fast-
even sit up maybe, if I click him he goes and
helps himself to one teeny cookie out of the
cookie bowl. If I don't click he doesn't do the
'trick' again. Apparently he reads this list when
I am not watching.

I have more fun now than I ever thought possible.

Many times he shows me new behaviors, mostly
small, that he has thought up on his own since he
is always loose and never restrained (unless in
town) from experiencing the world as he will. He
is so 'adult' behaving, calm and always checking
my needs that total strangers will comment on his
behavior when we are shopping or in a restaurant
or church &amp; etc.

For the first five and a half weeks of his life
Duncan and his litter mates were horribly abused,
the other 12 pups in the litter starved to death.
I went to see the litter that I had ordered a pup
from and they were dying when I got there. Yes, my
friend and I contacted the GSDCA and the local
club also. Duncan does not trust any human but me
but, other than staying at a bit of a distance at
home when we have company, he shows no shyness and
will go anywhere with crowds or children and noise
without behaving other than as the best and
calmest SD in the world. He doesn't want anyone
else to touch him. Duncan now kind of accepts the
vet and lets him touch. I never make him accept
other humans touch. I believe to do so would be a
betrayal of his trust in me. Any other training
than OC and this could not have happened.

I know that I don't explain well what I mean. My
brain is not operating well these days. Please
excuse my lack of clarity.

All of the above is only my opinion. I am not
advocating anything, I am here to learn.

Glad to see the list active again.

An important point is that punishment happens. If an animal is not
responding to what we hope will reinforce its behavior, why? Is there maybe
something punishing the behavior, making the reinforcer ineffective? There
could be a whole lot of things going on besides punishment, but punishment
is part of the real world... whether we plan for it or not.

I don't encourage the use of punishment and think aversives cause more
problems than they solve. But punishment happens in the world. It's a
natural phenomenon. I don't want to set up a rule that says we can't
discuss how to deal with it here. Clicker Solutions is a very good list
where the discussion of punishment is not allowed. That's a different
approach and that's a perfectly good approach. I just would like to take a
different approach here.

I do not think we should be using punishment and fooling ourselves that it
is a teaching technique. It is the exact opposite of a teaching
technique... it un-teaches behavior. I guess you could say it teaches the
animal what NOT to do. But whatever distinction you make, if you use it you
must teach new behavior to take the place of the behavior you're taking away
or the animal's environment will get to choose.

I avoid using punishment techniques although I will admit that I just now
shouted my dog's name because he was on a barking binge in the back yard.
Now he's basking in the sun. It looks like he's just as happy with that as
he was barking at the sky. Who knows? What I did was a punishment
technique. Over time he has come to bark less and less. Barking's a hard
problem to resolve so I consider myself lucky that he shuts up with a quick
call of his name. I yell his name when he's barking because he stops
barking when I do it. That's a negative reinforcement technique for MY
behavior of yelling his name. Pan has taught me to yell his name when he
barks.

Would differential reinforcement be a better training tool? Probably, if I
could get ahold of the environment better. I tried reinforcing alternative
behaviors and never could be where I needed to be when it was happening.
Pan doesn't bark if I'm outside. He barks when he and our Greyhound are
outside alone together. It's hard to get ahold of the contingencies that
control his barking... I need to get a Treat N Train and do it remotely!

Anyway, permitting discussions of punishment aren't about condoning it
across the board. Painful physical punishment should be a last-resort or
life-and-death proposition. But even yelling at a dog should only be done
if it's effective and if it's the best alternative you can come up with.
Even then my position is that the trainer should be figuring out ways to
replace the unwanted behavior with positively reinforced behavior ASAP.

Here's a key point. Aversive measures like choking with a prong collar or
spanking a child are often used again and again even though they aren't
working. If an aversive is used and it doesn't result in a drop in the rate
of behavior, STOP USING IT! If you keep using an aversive tool that isn't
working, that's just mean.

'taught' my horse to shake hands in a couple of minutes and I was hooked for
life.

Look around you, watch nature movies on Animal Planet, read about the
evolution of humans, and etc. Operant Conditioning, &quot;bouncing around the
world, doing what you do, until you encounter a reinforcing stimulus,&quot; is
how God set up the world to work.

Without OC wild animals and humans would have starved and died out millions
of years ago. Since physicists learned about, and used, gravity so that the
Space Program can work, so we know that we still are learning about how God
set up the world to work.

Now BF Skinner was an atheist, so for him it was just the way the world
works.

Yes, you can change human or animal behavior with a jerking leash or
punishments like hitting or pinching. However, to the best of my
recollection a hand has never come down out of the sky and whacked me when I
ate a bowl of ice cream.( Now we get to the technicalities which I continue
to
learn) I think the negative reinforcer is that the next time I go to town my
clothes don't fit as well. When I was obsessive about the grooming and
training of my dogs, we won in the ring. When I always pick up after my
dogs, who are trained to &quot;potty,&quot; or Poop&quot;, we become welcome anywhere.
People even stop to congratulate me for doing this which makes me feel good.
And on and on.

OC lets us, and if done well, our dogs also, learn by our own actions and
therefore we grow. Mentally mostly but also emotionally and sometimes
morally.

My dogs live with me in the country and never have a leash on unless we are
going to a town or city with traffic. They seem to me to be much more adult
in their attitudes than dogs which are always leash tied to their human. I
can see them thinking about what to do, then making a decision.
If they make a 'less than good' decision we just ignore the face full of mud
or the pup in the catfish pond or whatever. The pup has learned a lesson
that I could never teach. This is OC at work.

The wild animals around here are no longer afraid of me or the dogs( except
for the rabbits).
I won't go into the method, which I think is also OC, but it always works.
We sit on the deck watching the deer a few feet out from the yard fence in
the pasture. I love seeing the babies in the spring. The Coyote pack comes
up to the fence and sings with my dogs for several minutes on clear hunting
nights. There were bird nests built on the deck last year and clutches of
eggs laid and babies raised. Sometimes, since I only shut the door when the
temp. gets down below 30, the birds fly into the house and sometimes sit on
my shoulder. This is how the world can work when fear is taken out of the
equation and the animals are left to figure things out by themselves, OC.

The first time I see a pup go sit by the dog table (this is a large rubber
backed rug in the
yard) I bring him out a fresh piece of raw venison for lunch. (yes we eat
the deer, but a neighbor now shoots them for me, back in the forest, and yes
this too is how God set up the world to work) I never have to use the meat
to lure since, after the first taste, when I say sit at the dog table they
all do. They have the lure locked in their own minds.

If bored, bad weather usually, Duncan will go get a clicker and drop it in
my lap. He will then do something, stretch-wave-yawn-wag hard and fast- even
sit up maybe, if I click him he goes and helps himself to one teeny cookie
out of the cookie bowl. If I don't click he doesn't do the 'trick' again.
Apparently he reads this list when I am not watching.

I have more fun now than I ever thought possible.

Many times he shows me new behaviors, mostly small, that he has thought up
on his own since he is always loose and never restrained (unless in
town) from experiencing the world as he will. He is so 'adult' behaving,
calm and always checking my needs that total strangers will comment on his
behavior when we are shopping or in a restaurant or church &amp; etc.

For the first five and a half weeks of his life Duncan and his litter mates
were horribly abused, the other 12 pups in the litter starved to death.
I went to see the litter that I had ordered a pup from and they were dying
when I got there. Yes, my friend and I contacted the GSDCA and the local
club also. Duncan does not trust any human but me but, other than staying at
a bit of a distance at home when we have company, he shows no shyness and
will go anywhere with crowds or children and noise without behaving other
than as the best and calmest SD in the world. He doesn't want anyone else to
touch him. Duncan now kind of accepts the vet and lets him touch. I never
make him accept other humans touch. I believe to do so would be a betrayal
of his trust in me. Any other training than OC and this could not have
happened.

I know that I don't explain well what I mean. My brain is not operating
well these days. Please excuse my lack of clarity.

All of the above is only my opinion. I am not advocating anything, I am here
to learn.

Glad to see the list active again.

Shades of Yahoo groups... I'm getting posts all out of order. But here
goes...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I have a new pup! He's an 11 week old small breed mix (Doxie, Chi,

"/> Terrier?). He is gets fairly upset when I leave the room, but he is very
comfortable in his &gt;&gt;crate with the door closed if he can see me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What do you guys think is the best way to teach Oliver to be comfortable

"/> being alone?

First I'd ask, &quot;What behaviors does &quot;being alone&quot; entail?&quot;
If it means being crated for a couple of hours, what behavior has to happen
to get him crated?
Maybe walking into the crate on cue, laying down inside, and staying quiet
for X period of time?

Then I'd ask in what environment will he be doing those behaviors.
Initially just, inside the crate. If the crate is moved around a lot you
can later plan for generalizing the behavior to all those places by simply
doing a training session.

Then work on, &quot;How can I train those behaviors in that/those
environment(s)?&quot; KIS (Keep It Simple.)

If you haven't already, I'd shape up walking into the crate on his own on
cue rather than putting him inside. Easily done. I trained my Chinese
Crested during TV commercials one evening. Now I just say, &quot;Go in your
room!&quot; and he'll run upstairs and get in his crate. Tonight I'm going to
shape up going in a different crate he'll be using while he's the subject of
some clicker studies at UNT. Same process, but will probably take no time
at all.

First shut the door, open it, let him out and cue him to go back in. Do
this a few times, each time extending how long the door is shut. Gradually
work through walking a few steps away and coming back, leaving the room and
coming back, staying out of the room for a few seconds and coming back...
Etc.

Keep sessions short and sweet.

a quick example of this.

During the summer Pik was frightened by an aluminum dog walk, the only thing
he wouldn't do at a seminar. We've not been anywhere for him to get on
another one until today. I went to a private armed with clicker and food.
Since I was there early I took Pik to the DW. He got right on went about
1/2 up the ramp, jumped off. I clicked him for getting back on and taking
extra steps (2), jumped off. Got back on and took the same 2 steps again
(with C/T), jumped off.

Third time I clicked and put the treat a bit ahead, another step, same thing
again until he had gone up 5 steps, then he jumped off.

Next time as he got close to the spot I started dropping treats as lures, he
did the whole dog walk complete with a stick at the bottom.. While this was
happening I clicked with each step until he was at the cross board (for each
treat/step he took I was clicking).

Then he just went over the DW with no problems.

The lure was gone that quick.

Hi Kellie,

Sounds good. Thanks for breaking it down for me. That's what I always have
trouble with when it's my pet.

Would you involve treats in the process of extending the time he stays in
his crate?

What if he doesn't like to come out? He seems to only want to come out when
I open the door if I go into the other room. Even luring doesn't tend to
work. Perhaps I should shape that first?

Thanks again!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I do. I think you could also use the reinforcer of just opening the crate,
although I think treats may be more effective in this case. Note I said &quot;I
think&quot;! I don't know for sure. Might be interesting to compare.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Interesting! Then it would seem coming out isn't the best reinforcer! You
could shape coming out, too, if it matters to you. The good news is he's
okay in his crate. I think I would start by putting him in his crate,
stepping out of the room just out of sight, and coming right back.
Reinforce his behavior with YOU! Then gradually increase how long you're
gone.

I cover my small dog's crate at night because he doesn't settle down if he
sees people moving around. (Hearing us doesn't seem to bother him!) Hey...
Managing the antecedent environment is part of behavior analysis, too!

(Of course managing the environment isn't exclusive to behavior analysis...
But it is central to what we do.)

Hi Helix!

That's what's going on now. I also removed all other comfy napping spots and
he took to the crate like gangbusters! (Doesn't really want to come out!)

I'm finding that a lack of carpeting is great for housetraining AND crate
training!

So, my question is *when* does he get the treat when practicing out of
sight? Do I leave him with a chew or do I leave him with nothing and come
back and give him a treat?

Should there be a cue?

Thanks!

want.

If you have a Trick N Train this might be the time to do what Helix has

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Either. Both.

What I would not do is leave him alone so long he starts to cry, then come
back while he's crying. That will reinforce crying with your return. Keep
your absences a little shorter than it's likely to take him to cry.
Gradually extend the absence. Don't go back in while he's crying. If he
starts to cry while you're on your way back, stop, wait til he's quiet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I don't recall anything here that I had a problem with. I'm happy to answer

I can say one thing about Desensitization vs. negative reinforcement that
may provide insight. You start an approach retreat procedure with a few
animals. One animal begins the differential negative reinforcement program.
The aggressive behaviors occur at high rates until the differential negative
reinforcement procedure takes place. (Negatively reinforcing one behavior
while allowing another to extinguish.) The DNR procedure results in rapid
declines in behavior. The plain old approach and retreat is basically
desensitization, and in some animals you may begin to see a slight decline
in behavior. But when the DNR is initiated, the rates of aggression drop
rapidly.

Animal 2 starts the protocol later than animal 1, and it happens again...
Rates of aggression stay high during the plain desensitization and plummet
with DNR.

Animal 3- same thing.

How did you do the desensitization? No, I'm not saying that all
desensitization always takes a long time... It doesn't always. But a lot of
times it does. In fact, there is a common idea that &quot;aggression is forever&quot;
because of the slowness of aggression and the lack of adequate
generalization.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> It's nothing new, but here goes:

We measure the proximity threshold for the stimuli, being the person on the
bike moving fairly slowly. Then we work just behind that distance. The
rider has to watch what is going on fairly carefully.

As the rider approaches the threshold, the handler starts rapid-fire
treating. The rider keeps riding back and forth across the field of view,
getting closer as the dog seems to be more interested in the food than the
bike.

As soon as the dog starts to look more interested in the food we start
shaping. What we shape depends a bit on what the dog has already learned.
One of the dogs was cued a few well known behaviours because he had a very
good repetoire of heavily reinforced behaviours (I had actually instructed
that he was only cued one of these behaviours, but the handler improvised
and it worked out ok). Another (the one I was shaping) was clicked for
staring at the bike without barking (sub threshold, but only just!), then
very quickly shaped to stare at bike, then turn to me, then just to glance
at bike and turn to me, then to be aware of bike then look to me.
Differential Reinforcement. Timing, Rate and Criteria, you know the drill.
It had to be done properly, very little margin for error.

Then we started changing the picture. Parallel walking or jogging with bike.
Bike circling at a near distance (which is pretty threatening). Bike coming
towards dog, but off to side. Increase speed. Man walking bike and
circling dog. Smaller circles. Faster riding. Bike coming up from behind.
It all moved pretty quickly, very high rate of reinforcement.

Each case is a little different but this is the basic idea, we shape with
a lot of food and move ahead as quickly as the dog will let us. The
sessions are short and fairly intense, but we NEVER step over the
threshold. A hard stare is as much as I will allow.

I added another e-gadget to my arsenal. Joey did a stint as a demo dog at

the back of my truck with a walkie-talkie next to the crate. During class
I would occasionally croon into my walkie-talkie &quot;gooood boy&quot;. He only
barked a couple of times. &quot;No barking&quot; into the walkie-talkie, followed by
&quot;goood boy&quot; as soon as he was silent.

&gt; BTW, are there any discounts available?

I've heard there are some on e-bay. These aren't goign to be around long.
Sharper Image didn't market them correctly. They don't really care about

No, we are testing it without food until later. We do use it in later

&quot;[Jess} Do I leave him with a chew or do I leave him with nothing and come

give him a treat?'

[Kellie] Either. Both.&quot;

I guess what I get confused about is that we are trying to convince the dog
that it is no big deal when their owner leaves the room and they should just
relax in their crate.

BUT if we give a treat when we return (to reward staying calm in the crate)
then didn't we just increase the dog's level of excitement and anticipation?
I know that Oliver already wants me to return and what I want most is for
him to forget about me and just snooze.

Perhaps I could spy on him and wait for him to get drowsy and then come back
so he learns relaxing makes me return...?

What do you think?

Hi all -

I have a bit of a dilemma that I would like some help with.

Here's the deal:

I'm trying to teach my dog to &quot;Tag&quot; a target with her right paw and &quot;Step&quot;
on the target with her left foot. &quot;Tag&quot; and &quot;Step&quot; are verbal cues and I
don't want any physical cues associated with this behavior so I'm being
careful about what I do with my body and especially my eyes.

I began teaching the behavior by first getting a solid &quot;Tag&quot; to a hand
target before moving on to a solid &quot;Step&quot; to a hand target. Unfortunately,
I alternated my hand targets by offering her my left hand for &quot;Tag&quot; and my
right hand for &quot;Step.&quot; We've now progressed to 2 tile targets on the floor
in front of the dog roughly 1 foot to her left and right respectively. The
goal is to get a consistent response for the verbal cues so that &quot;Tag&quot;
results in the right foot touching the right target and &quot;Step&quot; results in
the left foot touching the left target.

Now for the problem...I'm at a point now where I offer the verbal cue, for
example &quot;Tag&quot;, and I will get - incorrect foot touch, both feet touch, back
up, growl (in frustration), sit, bow, incorrect foot touch, etc. This can
sometimes go on for up to 7 or 8 behaviors before I step in and stop her
throwing behaviors trying to get the click. It's almost as though she's
just guessing and hoping I will eventually click.

What I need here is for her to focus. When she hears the cue and thinks
before acting she is about 90% accurate but once she gets into that
impatient mode trying for the reinforcer, well her accuracy on the first
attempt drops to below 50% sometimes.

My concern here is that simply waiting until she settles down seems
frustrating to her. I don't want to demotivate her during the &quot;training
game&quot; but I also do not want to reinforce the &quot;throwing&quot; of multiple
behaviors until I get the response I want. I could inadvertently be
reinforcing a random behavior chain and may end up with - incorrect foot
touch, bow, growl, correct foot touch - or some variation if I simply click
the correct behavior when mixed in with all of the other thrown behaviors.

I hope that clearly outlines the issues here. We've taken a pause in this
training until I can figure out what exactly is going on here and how to
best set her up for success so that I'm not reinforcing in a confusing way.

Any comments or suggestions would be most welcome.
Thanks,
Eric

I'm still learning and want to learn more. It would be wonderful to have a good mentor by my side.

I can't help but wonder my friend that it was all new then.... they were exciting years, I am wondering now if it is the same horse, different jockey, as Pertti pointed out, ARF has the same guidelines.

I'm not working at present, I got offered a job the day before I went into hospital to have a thyroidectomy, that was three months ago and I haven't got over it as yet. I got a Tnt great for teaching a dog to wear an Akubra hat with corks hanging off it. My voice changed with the surgery so I am conditioning that too. .

What is an Akruba hat? My first thought was the bug man in Gerald Durrell's

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;BUT if we give a treat when we return (to reward staying calm in the crate)

"/> then didn't we just increase the dog's level of excitement and anticipation?

It certainly does seem possible. One thing Jesus and I are aware of in my
aggression study is being very careful not to give the reinforcer when the
dog is agitated. In my study the reinforcer is 'me walking away' rather
than food, but it works the same way. If I walk away while Fido is visibly
shaking, pulling at the leash toward me, barking, or anything like that, I'm
likely to reinforce that behavior. So I wait. You could do something like
that.

My growing preference in dealing with problem behaviors is to give the
animal the specific reinforcers he wants in exchange for what I want. What
does the animal want? In most cases of aggression, he wants someone or
something to GO AWAY. How do we know that? Because if we go away when he's
doing his aggressive behaviors, he does those behaviors more, and if we
don't go away when he does those behaviors he does those behaviors less. So
if I happen to trigger the aggressive behavior and he reacts, I just stay
there or even step closer until he mellows out. When he's not performing
any visible aggressive behaviors, I then walk away. So, he gets what he
wants but never for doing the aggressive behaviors.

Does a dog performing aggressive behaviors want food? That's certainly not
his priority at the moment. What reinforcer does he usually get for being
aggressive? People and animals leave him the heck alone... Or else his
owner drags him away. In one way or another he is separated from the
person/animal he's reacting to. How do we change that? By giving him what
he wants... Escape... ONLY in exchange for what we want... Calm behaviors
... Usually including a voluntary glance at the owner or turning away from
the aversive stimulus.

With Oliver you're faced with something slightly different, but I wanted to
explain how to find the best reinforcer. If an animal is already performing
an UNdesirable behavior (like whining in the crate) to get a certain
reinforcer (like you coming back) he will do OTHER behaviors to get that
same reinforcer. The challenge for you is to remember to give him his
reinforcer! So, I would suggest never ever ever reinforcing his whining by
coming back. But make super super to come back and give him some attention
when he is calm. I actually suggest that some owners wear a little timer to
remind themselves to check and see if Poochy is being &quot;good&quot;, and if he is,
give him some light attention. Not forever, mind you, just during the
learning phase. Once he's able to stay nicely in his crate with you out of
the room, but he starts whining as you return to let him out, wait until he
is calm before opening the door. This is what I do, because I don't want my
dogs scratching at the door when I walk back into the room. One reason is
that if we in a class or something I don't want them pitching a fit while I
go in and out packing up the car.

Lumi and I have been working on send-out moves in freestyle. We've
worked on them quite a bit, so we should have a pretty good feel for
whether the TNT gives us a discernible boost.

Like others perhaps, I tend to resist intrusions of technology. Then
I got a Hit It contact trainer, and the fun Lumi and I had with that
makes the TNT seem promising.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What I find interesting is that we can see a Classically Conditioned

"/> response disappear after using Operant Conditioning.

Yes, I agree. A behavior quite often starts out as a classical/respondent
behavior. But as soon as the behavior happens it has an opportunity to
contact consequences. If a consequence for a behavior is reinforcing, the
behavior will happen more often. So, the behavior slides over into the
operant area. The first time a dog reacts to the sight of a stranger with
barking and snarling may be classical. It's what dogs do when unexpected,
scary stuff happens. But by the time that behavior becomes a problem, it
has been LEARNED... meaning it's operant. It is happening because it has a
history of producing a certain reinforcer... usually escape. Classical
behavior only happens in response to an antecedent stimulus. To repeat: It
*only* happens when the antecedent stimulus triggers it. Operant behavior
requires a consequence... a reinforcer. A classically elicited behavior can
turn into an operant behavior. (And commonly does.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I know you will want to see data that it all wasn't OC in the first place,

"/> but I have little doubt in many of the cases I have seen.

It wasn't operant &quot;at first&quot;. Every behavior has to be produced at some
point before reinforcement has been experienced. The first time we do
something we have no idea if it will contact any reinforcerment, right?
It's after the behavior has been produced a few times and, say, the dog
realizes that if I bark, strange humans go away, that it becomes operant by
virtue of the reinforcer. One form of a behavior can be classical at one
point and operant later.

"/> Hi, Eric. Lumi is instantly responsive to &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; on go-
outs, whether in water or on a field, so I thought I'd share my
thoughts.

First, I wouldn't train both sides at the same time for awhile. I'd
work on only one of them for days, maybe weeks. Then the other.
Then the first again, once more for a prolonged period. Then the
other. And so forth. Move very gradually toward having them on the
same day.

Secondly, I'd try to create an errorless paradigm. In the case of
send-outs, I'd cue the turn while Lumi was swimming or running out,
then throw the toy to the indicated side. Soon she began to react to
the cue by turning before I made my throw. It happened the same way
on the other side when we switched to working on that one.
Similarly, I'd cue your dog, then present the target for her to touch
with the desired paw. If she's finding this sufficiently
reinforcing, she'll soon move her paw in anticipation of the target
being presented.

Thirdly, I'd try to introduce what I call &quot;discovery training&quot;. To
explain, one generally associates +R training with a reinforcer that
is independent of the target behavior. For example, to train the
touch, you're probably reinforcing with clicks (secondary +R) and
treats (primary +R). What I mean by discovery training is helping
the dog to find the touch itself as self-reinforcing as possible.
Lumi loves to swim or run to a toy; no treats or other independent
reinforcers are needed to make the behavior more likely the next
time. Maybe you can make the very act of touching the target
intrinsically fun in some way, perhaps by the way that you interact
with her while she's learning it, or perhaps by your choice of a
target object.

The goal for all of these is to get away from the idea of having the
dog discriminate among cues. Each cue becomes closely associated
with its own behavior, and no decision-making is involved.

&gt;Popping our of lurkdom here for a moment to ask you to clarify the

"/> statement below in regards to establishing operations. Touches are EOs in
what sense?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Lee

"/> Hi, Lee...
Well, I don't know if are often EO's now that you're making me think about
it :-) but I'll explain what I WAS thinking.

First, for those who don't know the term, an establishing operation (EO) is
something that makes a reinforcer more valuable. For example, hunger makes
food more valuable, so the learner is more likely to DO something in order
to get food when he is hungry. It's why we train hungry animals rather than
animals that just finished a big old bowl of kibble. Hunger is an
establishing operation making food more valuable.

What I was thinking with the touches is that they might help an animal relax
enough to appreciate his food reinforcers more, but now that I'm giving it
more thought, that's wrong. The touches don't make the food more valuable.
They probably just calm the animal down. He's not up for working harder to
get food, he's just relaxed. NOW I would say that the EO could just as
likely be a classical stimulus :-) It feels good, the animal chills out and
goes, &quot;AHHHhhhh&quot; in response to it. Once he's been saying &quot;Ah&quot; for a while,
he may be ready to get up and do some tricks in exchange for treats.
(Although in TTouch classes we usually sit around and admire how calm they
are. Especially the ones that were wound up at first!)

So, now I have to also &quot;un-say&quot; something I wrote to Aiden about not being
aware of TTouch involving any classical stuff. (DAMN!) There's probably
quite a lot of classical stuff in TTouch.

I KNOW touches can be used as reinforcers because it's happened with my
Greyhound. Over time she began to whine whenever we entered a TTouch class.
The whines increased in volume over time and eventually got to the point
that she was whining so loudly the instructor could not be heard. This took
place over the course of several classes. It was so embarrassing! What
happened was that every time she whined a couple of TTtouch practitioners
would rush over and give her a bunch of TTouches and say, &quot;Poor baby, don't
cry! We'll make you feel better!&quot;

I started instructing people to please NOT touch her if she was whining but
please do so if she was quiet. This made me into a meany, but it also
extinguished the whining. The others weren't as likely to do the touches
when she wasn't whining but I was able to do it.

Since I know for sure TTouches can help me build inappropriate whining in
classes I could also use TTouch to reinforce stuff I like, such as laying on
her mat during lectures, or doing little tricks. My small dog, Pan, works
just about as hard to be stroked like a cat (firm strokes with the flat hand
down the head and back... They're called Noah's March in TTouch) as he does
for food, and Bravo works BETTER for strokes than for food. We forget that
dogs like the sensual stuff as much as cats do.

I think it's important to distinguish between what the organism likes

the same thing, but not necessarily.

A kid might _want_ to get out of study hall. You might say, well, do
your work and you can leave. So the kid works for awhile, then
rushes out. Was he actually reinforced by getting what he wanted for
doing what we required? Not necessarily. Giving him what he wanted
may or may not have made him more likely to work in the future. We
don't have enough information to know whether we have actually used a
reinforcer.

Another kind of disconnect between what is wanted and what is
reinforcing can also occur. Lumi might desperately want to do
something, but that doesn't necessarily mean that setting up a
Premack training plan, in which she must do something else first,
will reinforce the desired behavior. Lumi might learn instead to
avoid the training entirely, not wanting to deal with the frustration.

[] &gt; Hi there Jody! I still look at what you sent me and it's still awesome
and cutting edge stuff, Marge Gibbs writings and all. I can't help but
wonder my friend that it [] &gt; was all new then.... they were exciting
years, I am wondering now if it is the same horse, different jockey, as
Pertti pointed out, ARF has the same guidelines.
[]
I'm not seeing a lot of activity in ARF these days. Are most of you members
there? I have a rather petty access problem with that list... I find it
inconvenient to navigate on the web and for some reason, despite multiple
tries, I don't get the posts in my inbox.

Click-L has been around for a long time, started by Kathleen Weaver with
Karen Pryor's blessing, and I figured the venue was already here, why not
revive it? It will be different, sure, but, the response has been promising
for the last 2 days and I think it will be a good thing. I'm looking
forward to it.

Eddie Fernandez, the owner of ARF-L, was the original President of ORCA
(Organization of Reinforcement Contingencies with Animals), the UNT
(University of North Texas) organization I'm President of now, so there
probably are are similarities. He and I had the same advisor, too. He is
working on a PhD in Illinois and I'm working on an MS in Texas.

Click-L was started long before I came along, and I know I won't follow in
the exact same path it started on. I have set the stage with some general
list &quot;attitudes&quot; I'd like to adhere to, but I don't plan to intervene in the
general flow of conversation outside of my own participation unless
something unpleasant occurs or we get too far off base. You guys don't need
constant moderation. That wouldn't be fun for anyone.

I mostly just want an easily accessible place to talk about the science
behind clicker training (and training without a clicker). I want it to be
remembered that we aren't here to talk about ... oh, family systems in
animal training. You can get that on the IAABC lists. We're not here to
talk about breeding and genetics except as they relate to behavior.

The list will be about discussing clicker training as a technology that
emerged through the field of behavior analysis in the 1930s with B.F.
Skinner and his gang of research assistants, including Marian and Keller
Breland and Norman Guttman.

For background, go to  www.behavior.org  and click on the Pets, Zoos and
Animals icon on the home page. (A photo of a guy shaking hands with a
Golden Retriever.) Read these articles. You might be able to click through
on these links, but if not, just go to the site. These articles are worth
reading for background on shaping behavior.

In fact, read The Discovery of Shaping first.

Hi Lindsay -

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Perhaps I wasn't clear in my original post. The &quot;Tag&quot; behavior was worked
and reinforced on its own for a period of about 4 weeks. The &quot;Step&quot;
behavior took slightly less since it was a variation and was worked for
approximately 3 weeks on its own. Both behaviors were worked at the same
time by offering a different target hand for &quot;Tag&quot; and &quot;Step&quot; (a mistake on
my part since the dog was using the visual cue of which hand I was offering
in order to perform the correct behavior) at a 90%+ success rate. Since
moving to the tile targets on the floor, the offered behavior problem has
happened. Clearly the dog is struggling to make the generalization and I
can't seem to find a good way to make it clear without reintroducing some
kind of prompt. Worse I can't seem to get the prompt to happen before she
throws 2 or 3 behaviors at me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Lindsay wrote:

"/>&quot;Secondly, I'd try to create an errorless paradigm.&quot;

I do not believe that &quot;errorless learning&quot; is possible. If the dog does not
discover that there is something that doesn't work, how will it know for
certain which discreet behavior is the one being reinforced? The dog does
not need to be punished or even acknowledged for an &quot;error&quot; during training.
Only that, out of a number of offered behaviors, one in particular is
getting the reinforcer. We cannot help what the dog offers and odds are
some of it will be incorrect or irrelevant behavior to our criteria. The
trick is to provide enough prompting to keep the success rate high enough to
keep them motivated (70-80% seems to work just fine in my case).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Lindsay wrote:

This is the essence of the problem. You are suggesting that I &quot;prompt&quot; the
correct behavior by offering the correct target while asking for the
behavior. I can do this at a 90%+ success rate right now. It is the fading
of these prompts that is causing me concern. The dog seems almost too eager
to earn reinforcers and so will try several things in rapid succession in
order to earn them. So it's the transition from more prompting to less
prompting that is giving me fits at the moment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Lindsay wrote:

"/>&quot;For example, to train the touch, you're probably reinforcing with clicks
(secondary +R) and treats (primary +R).&quot;

We may respectfully disagree on this point. I do not &quot;reinforce&quot; with a
click, I simply mark with a click. The click is an antecedent to the
delivery of a reinforcer. Does that make the click reinforcing on its own?
Maybe. Don't know what's in my dog's head. Since I never use the click
without a primary reinforcer, I will probably never know. I do know that I
can get the behavior, once trained, without the click. That tells me that
the click is not a necessary reinforcer for the behavior. In fact, it's
probably not a reinforcer at all, simply a signal that a reinforcer is
imminent. Is that reinforcing in itself? I'd love to have that
conversation with my dog but, alas, not possible yet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Lindsay wrote:

"/>&quot;What I mean by discovery training is helping the dog to find the touch

I think that some behaviors can be self-reinforcing (any agility activity
for my dog, for example) but others will never be. And I don't know that we
can &quot;help&quot; the dog decide that any given behavior is self-rewarding. If a
behavior was inherently self-rewarding for a dog I would expect them to
engage in it with no interaction from me. I'm finding it difficult to think
of many behaviors that my dog would do around the house while I was away.
Mind you, I know that lying down, particularly on the sofa, is definitely
self-reinforcing for my dog.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Interesting sentence above. Aren't &quot;cues&quot; also referred to as
&quot;discriminative stimuli&quot;? And I believe that dogs make choices all the
time. They choose to work with us or not, do the behavior fast or slow,
etc. I don’t think you can get them to an automaton-like status where they
respond to a given cue without thinking. I know for a fact that a running
rabbit is more reinforcing than anything I can offer my dog and any behavior
I ask for is likely to breakdown if a bunny runs by.

Thanks for the comments.

so I'll just save it. You were way [] &gt; ahead of me.

We are ALL way behind the times in terms of clicker training and behavior
analysis in general. I recently had a chance to go through my grandparents
old home where they had lived from the 1940s to the 1990s. (New owner died,
house was deserted.) I found a book with my grandmother's writing in it
about freelance writing published in 1933. I am a freelance writer, so this
was very cool. I read it, and the author of this book, a short story writer
in 1933, knew about conditioned stimuli. He had a high school education and
wrote stories for a living.

This was WAY ahead of the curve for 1933. Pavlov was around before 1900,
but I guarantee my grandma didn't know much about him. It was 1943 (I
think) when Breland, Guttman and Skinner were playing around teaching a
pigeon to bowl and did the first shaping by hand. Then Skinner shaped a
Dalmatian to jump up a wall for Look magazine some time later. (All this is
in the behavior.org articles.) But Look magazine was mainstream stuff... it
was in every living room. It took people a heck of a long time to catch on!
It took Don't Shoot the Dog ... I forget when it was published, but long
after the fact!

Animal Behavior Enterprises was doing it all along, from the beginning on
through. There were a few other trainers, too. Doug Cook clicker trained
all sorts of animals from the late 60s until his death a couple of years
ago. (He wasn't too nice to people, but great with animals.) Animal
trainers used to carefully guard their secrets. He never told his whole
story, which would have been fascinating. I tried and tried to get him to
let me write his biography, but he died before I could convince him.

Karen Pryor deserves credit for getting the word out to the public. But she
wasn't the first... clicker training had been around nearly 30 years when
she started training dolphins in Hawaii. And she was one of many. But she
got the word out to the people... which is very worthy of appreciation!
Don't Shoot the Dog was recommended to me by Doug Cook and Linda Morrow
(parrot trainers), and that changed the course of my life... I went back to
school, changed from being an artist to being a scientist (now I get to be
both!) and gave me ways to manage the behavior of my kids without spanking
them. (I have two very cool teenagers that are among my greatest friends.
That's not magic... it's positive reinforcement!)

That didn't happen with woo-woo stuff. It happened by understanding natural
phenomenon. Science.

"/> Ken Ramirez teaches this in his modifier cues presentation at Clicker
Expo. I was a coach in his Learning Lab so was able to see the whole
process then come home and start it with Joey.

First, for the record: teaching the dog to touch the leftmost article is
not the same as turning to the left so I wanted to make sure NOT to use
Left and Right to train this. I used Tic and Toc.

Like you Eric, I started with hand touches to the proper hand. Ken does
have you train them both at the same time, alternating hands and mixing it
up. Yes, the proper hand is also a cue. Make sure to say Tic . .. then
present your right hand (using my cues as that's what's clear in my mind).

Once you have that, move to holding identical obstacles in your hands. The
dog will initially want to slap your hand. HOld the obstalce in such a way
that he misses your hand and get the object. Go back and forth with that
until he's got it. Remember verbal cue first, then presentation of object.

Also Ken strongly recommends your treat delivery be in the center between
the two objects.

Now do it again with another pair of objects so the cues don't mean just
touch those first things. Treat delivery in the center.

Now do it with placing the object rather than holding it so it's no longer
about touching what you are holding but touching what you have placed.

Now do it again wtih the objects already placed. You may need to indicate
wtih your hand following the verbal for a few reps. Your spacing is such
that you are placing these out maybe 2.5 feet apart.

Now you place them both out and leave them there, always treating in the
center. Then you begin to move them further apart.

Ken has a whole arsenal of modifier cues and action cues he has trained
wtih SAR dogs. He can verbally tell the dog how to climb up a cliff with
directions and actions. Pretty impressive!

By sneaking up on it in bits like this perhaps you'll be able to keep your
dog on task. I suspect all throwing of behaviors has crept in because you
are lumping a bit eh? :)

significant discussion of the ability of the
conditioned reinforcer to reinforce behavior in the
absence of the primary reinforcer. [...]
Zimmerman's journal articles in Psychological Review
Vol. 64, No. 6, &quot;Durable Secondary Reinforcement Method
and Theory&quot;, and &quot;Sustained Performance in Rats Based on
Secondary Reinforcement&quot; [...] demonstrated that not
only will the CR maintain existing behavior, but it will
also serve to reinforce/establish new behaviors.

So in effect, the conversation has been carried out, with
rats at least ;-)

In the same thread, Lee provided a &quot;marking&quot; reference:

Lieberman, McIntosh &amp; Thomas published a study called
&quot;Learning when reward is delayed: A marking hypothesis&quot;
in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior
Processes, 5, 1979.

The article describes an experiment where rats had to make
a choice to go down a white tunnel or a black tunnel. If rats
were picked up by their tail at the choice point (i.e. not
contingent on the choice they made), they learned better than
rats that were not handled.

Hi

I just found one on Ebay - a &quot;Buy Now&quot; (which I did
&lt;G&gt;) for 45.67 including MA state tax and shipping -
merchandise price was $34.97. The seller was the
Sharper Image.

Looking forward to using it for send aways.

Bizarre! I'll have to look that one up.

A study on reinforcer delay after the &quot;bridge&quot; or clicker was done at UNT a
few years ago. Even a delay of a couple of seconds caused a lot of adjunct
behaviors to start popping up and longer delays caused the animal to just
wander off and find something more interesting to do.

Probably should, though.

I would imagine it to be possible to maintain the
reinforcingness of a conditioned reinforcer
by pairing it with a primary reinforcer outside
of the training of a particular behavior. That is,
you &quot;charge the clicker&quot;, then train a little bit
by clicking but not feeding, charge the clicker again,
etc.

"/> What the dog learns is that there are no wrong guesses, some just
work better.

When I first trained Lumi to swim and turn, I would throw the toy,
then call the direction just before the toy landed. I wanted an
instant reinforcement for correct turns. Of course, it so happened
that if she turned the wrong way or didn't turn, she'd still get the
toy. Nonetheless, she began responding to the cue so she could get
to the toy sooner. Eventually, I'd wait for her to break before I
threw, but I didn't do that at first because I wanted a near-
instantaneous reinforcement. Even now, I generally throw the toy to
the called side no matter which way she breaks.

So if your dog offers the wrong paw, instead of withholding
reinforcement, you still offer the target to the desired paw.

In Suzanne Clothier's jump chute training, she suggests that you
reinforce runs with knocked bars just as much as clean runs. Most
dogs, including Lumi, don't like to hit bars and will tend to correct
the knocks themselves. This would be another example of what I mean
by errorless training.

In &quot;Ex-celerated Learning&quot;, Pam Reid describes something she calls
&quot;autoshaping&quot;. In this procedure, the dog learns a behavior
associated with the source of a potential reinforcer by being
&quot;reinforced&quot; whether offering a behavior or not. Dogs apparently
begin offering the behavior with great persistence even though the
reinforcer occurs whether the dog offers the behavior or not.

I'm not sure it's a matter of believing or not believing that these
things occur. It is of course a matter of choice whether to apply
the techniques with your own dog.

"/> Only at first. Although this is operant conditioning rather than
classical, the cueing is analogous to classical contiditioning (I'll
list the classical analogy in parens).

There are two prompts (stimuli), the verbal cue (conditioned
stimulus), and the visual one (unconditioned stimulus). As in
classical conditioning, at first, they appear in quick succession,
before the behavior (the unconditioned response, to become the
conditioned response). During the course of the training, the time
between the CS and the US is lengthened, and soon the dog is
responding to the CS with what is now the CR.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> I'd be interested in what happens if you go back to keeping the two
stimuli close together, before any behavior is offered, and then
gradually spread the time between the two stimuli. If you get offer-
itis, close the gap until you're getting reliable responses again. I
wouldn't be concerned with whether the target is offered before the
behavior or not, only with slowly spreading the time between the
verbal cue and the offered target.

Will the dog learn not to offer any behavior until the target
appears, or will she begin to anticipate the target correctly?

He assured me that the man who invented the term &quot;bridging
stimulus&quot; (or &quot;bridge&quot;) considered it a synonym of secondary reinforcer.

I agree with you that some dogs may come to like the clicking sound,
while many others may not and may always think of it as a promise,
not a reward. But if the dog's behavior is reinforced more by the
presence of the click than by its absence, it is still manifestly a
reinforcer.

Hey check this out - I think I might have figured something out that's even
easier than all of my other ideas!

So, Oliver (11 wk old mix) loves his crate. It is the most comfortable place
to be and he has gotten lots of treats and attention for being in there.

The problem has been when I leave the room he cries.

My new idea is to gradually move the *crate* out of the room (instead of
me). For instance, right now he is about 4 feet out of the door to my office
where I am sitting here typing.. He can't see me, but he is calmly lying
down (I left the crate door open for now to be sure that he is comfortable).
Every so often when he is calm I will go to him and give him so attention
and a treat.

I think this will do the trick!

A thesis project is just being completed at UNT by Pam Wenmacher (advised by
Jesus Rosales-Ruiz) in which the clicker was charged, then it was tested to
see what happens if you click and treat, then click and don't treat. (They
used to call this &quot;two-fers&quot;) The click loses its power almost instantly.
Skip food with one click and the animal's behavior begins to fall apart.
Skip the food on 2 clicks and you're in trouble. Skip 3 and the dog finds
other things to do.

This MAY mean that the clicker isn't really a conditioned reinforcer. It
may just be a marker. That's a good thing for it to be, so that's not a bad
thing. Someone mentioned that a clicker is/can be an antecedent to go get
food. Since it happens when a certain behavior is happening, it tells the
dog, &quot;If I do this and if the clicker sounds while I'm doing this, food is
available so I can go get it.&quot;

If the clicker is a conditioned reinforcer, though, that means some
conditioned reinforcers aren't too powerful on their own.

Some conditioned reinforcers are extremely powerful... Money, for example.
It is a generalized reinforcer that humans can trade in for just about any
reinforcer they want just about any time they want it. It would take a long
time for money to lose its power. Southerners stashed Confederate dollars
in their mattresses for a long time after they lost their value when the
north won the war. They hoped the reinforcing value of their money would
come back. It took a long time for their money to stop being reinforcing.

But a clicker, according to this study, loses its power pretty darned
quickly when the food isn't given every time.

Zoos still use two-fers and three-fers and four-fers, and it's kind of sad.
They attribute all the junk behavior the animals produce between the cue and
the food as characteristics of that animal. I saw a video of a cheetah
being trained this way recently. He was snarly and snappy and slapped the
cage bars fairly often. He was said to be a temperamental cheetah.
However, he was only getting food about every 3rd click. He wasn't
temperamental. His behavior was on the edge of extinciton. It was being
kept at a &quot;temperamental&quot; level because he was getting reinforcers while he
was being a butt. Those junk behaviors would go away if they'd just give
food every time they click the clicker.

This bring to mind something that is going on with a friend and her sheltie
puppy. This puppy, 6 mo old, is one who doesn't like to come all the way to
the owner, not even if Sara is showing her food. However if a hand is
presented and Scuba is asked to touch, she'll come right up to touch, get
the click/treat and then Sara can touch her.

What is this?

&gt;&gt;Popping our of lurkdom here for a moment to ask you to clarify the
&gt; statement below in regards to establishing operations. Touches are EOs in
&gt; what sense?
&gt;&gt;Lee

&gt; Hi, Lee...
&gt; Well, I don't know if are often EO's now that you're making me think about
&gt; it :-) but I'll explain what I WAS thinking.

&gt; First, for those who don't know the term, an establishing operation (EO)
&gt; is
&gt; something that makes a reinforcer more valuable. For example, hunger
&gt; makes
&gt; food more valuable, so the learner is more likely to DO something in order
&gt; to get food when he is hungry. It's why we train hungry animals rather
&gt; than
&gt; animals that just finished a big old bowl of kibble. Hunger is an
&gt; establishing operation making food more valuable.

&gt; What I was thinking with the touches is that they might help an animal
&gt; relax
&gt; enough to appreciate his food reinforcers more, but now that I'm giving it
&gt; more thought, that's wrong. The touches don't make the food more
&gt; valuable.
&gt; They probably just calm the animal down. He's not up for working harder
&gt; to
&gt; get food, he's just relaxed. NOW I would say that the EO could just as
&gt; likely be a classical stimulus :-) It feels good, the animal chills out
&gt; and
&gt; goes, &quot;AHHHhhhh&quot; in response to it. Once he's been saying &quot;Ah&quot; for a
&gt; while,
&gt; he may be ready to get up and do some tricks in exchange for treats.
&gt; (Although in TTouch classes we usually sit around and admire how calm they
&gt; are. Especially the ones that were wound up at first!)

&gt; So, now I have to also &quot;un-say&quot; something I wrote to Aiden about not being
&gt; aware of TTouch involving any classical stuff. (DAMN!) There's probably
&gt; quite a lot of classical stuff in TTouch.

&gt; I KNOW touches can be used as reinforcers because it's happened with my
&gt; Greyhound. Over time she began to whine whenever we entered a TTouch
&gt; class.
&gt; The whines increased in volume over time and eventually got to the point
&gt; that she was whining so loudly the instructor could not be heard. This
&gt; took
&gt; place over the course of several classes. It was so embarrassing! What
&gt; happened was that every time she whined a couple of TTtouch practitioners
&gt; would rush over and give her a bunch of TTouches and say, &quot;Poor baby,
&gt; don't
&gt; cry! We'll make you feel better!&quot;

&gt; I started instructing people to please NOT touch her if she was whining
&gt; but
&gt; please do so if she was quiet. This made me into a meany, but it also
&gt; extinguished the whining. The others weren't as likely to do the touches
&gt; when she wasn't whining but I was able to do it.

&gt; Since I know for sure TTouches can help me build inappropriate whining in
&gt; classes I could also use TTouch to reinforce stuff I like, such as laying
&gt; on
&gt; her mat during lectures, or doing little tricks. My small dog, Pan, works
&gt; just about as hard to be stroked like a cat (firm strokes with the flat
&gt; hand
&gt; down the head and back... They're called Noah's March in TTouch) as he
&gt; does
&gt; for food, and Bravo works BETTER for strokes than for food. We forget
&gt; that
&gt; dogs like the sensual stuff as much as cats do.

I am not sure if I am visually processing the correct picture of what you are trying to accomplish with the step/tag behaviors.
However, I taught Raven something similar by shaping the behavior instead of using targets.
I find she learns faster, maintains longer and enjoys more behaviors she learns while shaping...

Eric,

Maybe this suggestion will help. Your dog understands to touch the correct
hand when each are say before your body facing outward - right? This is 90%
of the time.

Then you held the to be floor targets in your hands?

Next you put them on the floor?

If you did those two things, maybe you need to someway move the targets to
the floor in a slow way. Also when you held them in your hand were they
flat like they would be on the floor or were they angled upward? I would
think they need to be flat.

So how could you move them down? If they are angled up you could use double
backed tape to stick them to your pants legs, then kind of prop them up on
your shoes or something else before putting them flat.

I don't think descriptions of how to do things is what Kellie wants on this
list, probably should have written this to you privately

BUT, this is a good place for Kellie to let me know her wishes.

&gt; prompting that is giving me fits at the moment.

&gt;&quot;For example, to train the touch, you're probably reinforcing with clicks

&gt; We may respectfully disagree on this point. I do not &quot;reinforce&quot; with a
&gt; click, I simply mark with a click. The click is an antecedent to the
&gt; delivery of a reinforcer. Does that make the click reinforcing on its
&gt; own?
&gt; Maybe. Don't know what's in my dog's head. Since I never use the click
&gt; without a primary reinforcer, I will probably never know. I do know that
&gt; I
&gt; can get the behavior, once trained, without the click. That tells me that
&gt; the click is not a necessary reinforcer for the behavior. In fact, it's
&gt; probably not a reinforcer at all, simply a signal that a reinforcer is
&gt; imminent. Is that reinforcing in itself? I'd love to have that
&gt; conversation with my dog but, alas, not possible yet.

&gt;&quot;What I mean by discovery training is helping the dog to find the touch

&gt; I think that some behaviors can be self-reinforcing (any agility activity

&gt; we
&gt; can &quot;help&quot; the dog decide that any given behavior is self-rewarding. If a
&gt; behavior was inherently self-rewarding for a dog I would expect them to
&gt; engage in it with no interaction from me. I'm finding it difficult to
&gt; think
&gt; of many behaviors that my dog would do around the house while I was away.
&gt; Mind you, I know that lying down, particularly on the sofa, is definitely
&gt; self-reinforcing for my dog.

&gt; Interesting sentence above. Aren't &quot;cues&quot; also referred to as

&gt; time. They choose to work with us or not, do the behavior fast or slow,
&gt; etc. I don't think you can get them to an automaton-like status where
&gt; they
&gt; respond to a given cue without thinking. I know for a fact that a running
&gt; rabbit is more reinforcing than anything I can offer my dog and any
&gt; behavior
&gt; I ask for is likely to breakdown if a bunny runs by.

The targets are small enough that you can't get both feet on at once. On
the floor, the dog has the option of pouncing on the target with both feet,
as is frequently the case. So now do I change my criteria and reinforce for
the correct side regardless one or both paws touch the correct side? Or do
I hold to the correct single paw to the correct target as the criteria for
reinforcement?

If I am correct, then we are just having a semantics problem. In my

Ah, but here's where it gets muddy. Let's say I continue to offer the

&lt;wrong paw&gt;&lt;wrong paw&gt;&lt;correct paw&gt; in rapid succession, what am I
reinforcing exactly? Would that be one &lt;correct paw&gt; or the 3-touch

what emerges. My problem here is that I have tried several variations on
the suggestions offered already. I've waited and allowed multiple attempts
until the correct response is offered and then mark/reinforce. I've broken
the flow of the training by asking for different well-known behavior in
order to &quot;reset&quot; the dog before another attempt at &lt;correct paw&gt;. And so
on.

I'm going to have to go back and re-read that but the sentence above doesn't

whether they are offering the behavior (back up) or not? The dog can be
reinforced for backing up by not backing up? Perhaps it's just the wording

Here, I think, we are at odds semantically again. To me, reintroducing a

the behavior in the absence of the prompt is harder than with the prompt
present. So offering the prompt again lowers the criteria and makes it
easier for the dog to succeed, yes?

whether the target is offered before the behavior or not, only with slowly

I'll give this a try this evening and see where it leads. If I understand
your suggestion, I should offer the verbal cue and then pause slightly

shaping is raising criteria so slowly that errors are minimized,

work out as an errorless protocol.

By an errorless protocol, I mean that all responses are rewarded, not
only the correct ones. Again, the reward is given in such a way that
it makes the next response more likely to be a correct one, not
because a response was withheld as in differential reinforcement, but
because it's more efficient to get to the reward with the correct
response.

So this is different from DR. In 80% DR, 20% of the dog's responses
are not reinforced. In my evolving notion of an errorless protocol,
100% of the dog's responses are reinforced, but the 20% incorrect
ones are reinforced using a self-correcting delivery system.

You're training the left paw, say. You give the cue. The dog offers

target with his right paw. He puts down his right paw and touches
the target with his left paw. Yay! Correct response! Click and
treat every time.

I'm not saying DR wouldn't work, too. This is just an idea I'm

At first, work with the target in your hand, yes, and pause slightly,
yes, and only on one side, yes. Then, pause longer and longer.
Actually, I think it would be better to pause variable amounts of
time (surprise=motivation), but the trend would be toward longer and
longer times. Reinforce every rep. Soon (I hope), the dog will give
the correct response _before_ you present the target. Nice time for
a party if you believe in those. If no response, or wrong response,
present the target anyway. Once you're getting reliable correct
responses, practice that a little while, then do some more reps with
the tile closer to the ground. If necessary, make the pause short
again. (&quot;Necessary&quot; happens when you start getting incorrect
responses.) Keep moving closer to the floor, then do the whole thing
touching the tile to the floor at an angle, then holding flat against
the floor. Eventually, maybe not tonight, you'd give the cue, pause
the variable amount of time, and gently toss the tile onto the floor.

Well, if you're going to do this tonight, I guess I better do it,
too. We can compare notes tomorrow.

want to proof for roadkill, here's something to try (borrowed,
perhaps somewhat incorrectly, from the later stages of Shirley
Chong's Recall Redux training plan):

(1) Find a fresh roadkill.

(2) Find a distance from the roadkill where the dog is aware of it,
but is not glancing at it. I believe Shirley would call this staying
out of the frustration zone. I would call it Shirley's no-glance
rule. Perhaps the distance is 100 feet, I don't know.

(3) Draw a mental line from you to the roadkill.

(4) Stand on one side of the line, and toss a treat onto the ground
on the other side of the line, so that you and the treat are the same
distance from the roadkill. Dog runs to treat (I hope).

(5) As your dog devours the treat, call him to you. Assuming he
comes, do it again.

(6) Once you're comfortable that your dog is coming to you
enthusiastically at that distance, move a tiny distance closer to the
roadkill, a few inches, and repeat.

(7) If at any time the dog glances at the roadkill, you're moving
closer too fast. Back off. There is no advantage to rushing this.
You want every rep to be free and easy, no frustration, just you and
the dog. The roadkill exists, like a bird in the sky, but you and
the dog are all about lots of recalls and lots of treats.

Assuming your dog is at a stage in his recall training where you can
find an initial no-glance position, what I believe you'll find is
that the frustration zone will shrink and shrink. You may find that,
in a single session, you can have the dog running past the road kill
to get to you, even when you're finally tossing the treat over the
roadkill.

I taught Lumi to deal with her beloved volleyball this way. Poor
thing, she tripped over the volleyball one time, so intent was she on
ignoring it. We've done it with out-of-control neighborhood Labs,
too. Boy was it funny, and fun, to see Lumi pushing past _them_ to
get to _me_ at the end of the session.

Hey, Diane, you make a very good point. When you can shape it can be a good
thing. I'm not saying targetting has no useful purpose... it does. But
shaping gets right into learning. You've made some good observations about
the speed of learning and retention.

However, I taught Raven something similar by shaping the behavior instead
of using targets.

I find she learns faster, maintains longer and enjoys more behaviors she

"/> statement below in regards to establishing operations. Touches are EOs in
what sense?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Lee

"/> Hi, Lee...
Well, I don't know if are often EO's now that you're making me think about
it :-) but I'll explain what I WAS thinking.

First, for those who don't know the term, an establishing operation (EO) is
something that makes a reinforcer more valuable. For example, hunger makes
food more valuable, so the learner is more likely to DO something in order
to get food when he is hungry. It's why we train hungry animals rather than

animals that just finished a big old bowl of kibble. Hunger is an
establishing operation making food more valuable.

What I was thinking with the touches is that they might help an animal relax
enough to appreciate his food reinforcers more, but now that I'm giving it
more thought, that's wrong. The touches don't make the food more valuable.
They probably just calm the animal down. He's not up for working harder to
get food, he's just relaxed. NOW I would say that the EO could just as
likely be a classical stimulus :-) It feels good, the animal chills out and
goes, &quot;AHHHhhhh&quot; in response to it. Once he's been saying &quot;Ah&quot; for a while,
he may be ready to get up and do some tricks in exchange for treats.
(Although in TTouch classes we usually sit around and admire how calm they
are. Especially the ones that were wound up at first!)

So, now I have to also &quot;un-say&quot; something I wrote to Aiden about not being
aware of TTouch involving any classical stuff. (DAMN!) There's probably
quite a lot of classical stuff in TTouch.

I KNOW touches can be used as reinforcers because it's happened with my
Greyhound. Over time she began to whine whenever we entered a TTouch class.

The whines increased in volume over time and eventually got to the point
that she was whining so loudly the instructor could not be heard. This took
place over the course of several classes. It was so embarrassing! What
happened was that every time she whined a couple of TTtouch practitioners
would rush over and give her a bunch of TTouches and say, &quot;Poor baby, don't
cry! We'll make you feel better!&quot;

I started instructing people to please NOT touch her if she was whining but
please do so if she was quiet. This made me into a meany, but it also
extinguished the whining. The others weren't as likely to do the touches
when she wasn't whining but I was able to do it.

Since I know for sure TTouches can help me build inappropriate whining in
classes I could also use TTouch to reinforce stuff I like, such as laying on
her mat during lectures, or doing little tricks. My small dog, Pan, works
just about as hard to be stroked like a cat (firm strokes with the flat hand

down the head and back... They're called Noah's March in TTouch) as he does
for food, and Bravo works BETTER for strokes than for food. We forget that
dogs like the sensual stuff as much as cats do.

"/> Do you mean, is this because of reinforcement history, classical

I'm afraid I don't have a clue.

Still, I wasn't clear from your post whether Sara wants to fix this,
or you're just interested in the analysis. I hope it's OK to
brainstorm on getting Scuba to come to Sara without the hand target,
assuming Sara would like that.

For starters, what happens if Sara closes her hand a split second
before Scuba touches it? Does Scuba move away, or allow petting? If
Scuba allows petting, would it be possible to gradually close the
hand earlier and earlier, until it becomes irrelevant?

Also, I've been reading &quot;Agility Success&quot;, and the author talks about
training independent dogs to like petting. It's the opposite
sequence to what you described. First the petting, then the treat.
I think this is typical classical conditioning.

Let's leave the clicking out for now. If Sara consistently treats
first, then pets Scuba, the treat is predicting the petting, which
Scuba doesn't like (yet). This could actually be classically
conditioning the treat in the opposite way desired.

But if the petting were first, then the treat, then the petting would
predict the treat. Assuming the dog still likes treats (and it may
be worth using very high value treats for this at least initially),
that would classically condition the petting in the direction desired.

If Scuba really loves to do her nose touch, Sara might even be able
to use that behavior as the &quot;treat&quot;, kind of a Premack version of
classical conditioning. Present hand target, then pet Scuba a little
as she goes for the hand target. Gradually, petting predicts
pleasure Scuba feels when she performs the nose touch. After awhile,
she may feel that pleasure when she gets petted, even without the
nose touch.

In any case, I question whether petting should be last in the
sequence. I think it should predict something she already likes.

[] &gt; If I'm correct, this is essentially your definition of &quot;Errorless
Learning&quot;, am I correct?

Errorless learning is a behavior analytic technique that involves setting up
the environment so that the correct response must be chosen. I'm not sure
if that is how it was being used here.

[] &gt; So if your dog offers the wrong paw, instead of withholding
reinforcement, you still offer the target to the desired paw.

How would you do that, Lindsay? He's offering the wrong paw... how can you
reinforce for the right paw? Am I missing something?

Ah, but here's where it gets muddy. Let's say I continue to offer the
target until a correct paw touch is offered. If the offered behavior is
&lt;wrong paw&gt;&lt;wrong paw&gt;&lt;correct paw&gt; in rapid succession, what am I
reinforcing exactly? [] Would that be one &lt;correct paw&gt; or the 3-touch
sequence above? I suppose the only way to know is to collect data and see
what emerges.

My bet is it would be pretty easy to get a behavior chain instead of the
last behavior alone. I might suggest ending a trial when an incorrect
response occurs, and start a new trial. If you're getting a lot of
incorrects, stop the session and re-evaluate what you're doing. Lots of
incorrects means there's a challenge to fix up in the training program.

My problem here is that I have tried several variations on the suggestions
offered already. I've waited and allowed multiple attempts until the
correct response is offered and then mark/reinforce. I've broken the flow
of the training by asking for different well-known behavior in order to
&quot;reset&quot; the dog before another attempt at &lt;correct paw&gt;. And so on.

Just a suggestion, but it might be confusing to change criterion within a
session, and especially within a trial. If things aren't going well, take a
break, figure out another plan of attack and start a whole new session with
the new criteria. You can see here why data is so critical.

"/> In &quot;Ex-celerated Learning&quot;, Pam Reid describes something she calls
&quot;autoshaping&quot;. In this procedure, the dog learns a behavior associated with
the source of a potential reinforcer by being &quot;reinforced&quot; whether offering
a behavior or not.

I'm going to have to go back and re-read that but the sentence above doesn't
make sense to me.

Here's a good definition of autoshaping from the late John Creed from a
little college in Minnesota.

Autoshaping. Normal shaping
&lt;http://employees.csbsju.edu/tcreed/pb/methods.html#shaping&gt; of a pigeon to
peck a key, using successive approximations, takes about an hour to get a
naive pigeon to peck the key reliably. {{{{{{(He's talking about in a
Skinner box, of course. kss)}}}}}}}} Suppose, though, instead of the
laborious process of successive approximations, we simply arrange some
programming equipment to present a hungry pigeon with grain once a minute,
turn on the key light ten seconds before each presentation of food, go get a
cup of coffee, and come back later and see what happened? That's all
autoshaping is. Keypecks, when they eventually occur, are reinforced with
food, just like with regular shaping.

Basically, you get the animal's attention by presenting a bit of food
periodically immediately preceeded by some salient stimulus like a light
that is right beside a lever we want the bird to press (or some other
behavior). Eventually a pigeon will start interacting with stuff and will
press the lever. As soon as he presses the lever food is delivered. It
doesn't take long for him to start pressing the lever to get food and you
can stop using the light and timed food delivery.

"/> By eliciting the correct response, then reinforcing that. Let me
give two examples.

As I said I would, I worked on this with Lumi tonight. Contrary to
what I recommended to Eric, things went so well that I compressed the
project into a single evening. I used &quot;starboard&quot; and &quot;port&quot;,
neither being a known cue to Lumi. Heck, they're barely known to me.

First I freeshaped Lumi to whack a ceramic coaster with her right
paw, then I added the cue &quot;starboard&quot;. Next I moved it to the
ground. Turns out it was easier for her to paw it on the ground than
in my hand. We did that for a few reps.

After a break, we did the same thing with the left paw, with the cue
&quot;port&quot;. Occasionally she responded to &quot;port&quot; with the wrong paw. I
used my hand to move the coaster close to the paw I wanted (that was
one way of eliciting the correct response), and when I got movement
(didn't worry about the touch), I clicked and treated. I didn't
worry about the touch because I was clicking Lumi's decision to use
the correct paw, not waiting for the decision to be executed. The
next cue would be a full touch.

I went back and forth at least twice, one session of &quot;starboard&quot;
only, one session of &quot;port&quot; only. If I weren't an impatient fool, I
would have stopped there for the night.

But out of curiosity, I put down a second coaster. Now I cued
&quot;starboard&quot;. If Lumi whacked wrong coaster, or correct coaster with
wrong paw, I reached down (I was in a chair) and picked the coaster
up and held it near the correct paw. As soon as she moved the
muscles of the correct paw, C/T. Then I put the coaster down and
tried again, same cue. Invariably she got it instantly right the
second time. When I say &quot;instantly&quot;, I mean spoonful-of-tripe
instantly.

That was one way of eliciting a correct response for every cue. But
by the end, it wasn't necessary for me to touch the coaster. If Lumi
tried the wrong paw, I'd just gesture with my hand on the side I
wanted, and she'd whack again on that side. C/T.

We did about seven sessions altogether. By the end, she was
responding correctly to the same cue twice in succession nearly
100%. If I switched from &quot;starboard&quot; to &quot;port&quot;, that was also over
90%. If I switched from &quot;port&quot; to &quot;starboard&quot;, that was lower, maybe
65%.

I'm not in favor of continuing this way. I believe that Lumi will
soon learn that &quot;starboard&quot; and &quot;port&quot; just mean &quot;the same one again&quot;
or &quot;the other one&quot;. If I actually cared about connecting &quot;starboard&quot;
with her right paw, I would stay away from &quot;port&quot; for days.

But the main point I wanted to show was that it did not seem to slow
the process down for us to eliminate any extinction reps. Lumi
eventually (within a second or two) made the correct response to
every cue the entire night, and therefore received reinforcement
every time I said &quot;starboard&quot; or &quot;port&quot; the entire night.

I agree that, if you're not going to elicit the correct response
every time, you don't want to keep giving the cue and getting the
wrong answer and then not being able to reinforce it. As you said,
Eric, you want to make sure that whatever you're asking for, the dog
has at least an 80% chance of success. I think you said you're OK
with 70%. I've heard 80%. I don't know what the answer is.

* When Lumi and I are freeshaping a new behavior, the increments are
tiny, sometimes invisible to an observer. This rapport is one of the
spiritual aspects of freeshaping for me. Anyway, we don't need to
get eight for ten, or anything like that. More likely, we get 4/4,
then raise the criteria slightly, get maybe a miss and then three
more hits in a row, raise the criteria slightly again. These
sessions are short because I don't bring too much food to each one,
but we keep going until we run out of food, then take a break to
prepare some more food.

* If we're not freeshaping, we don't tend to do ten of in a row much
any more. We do one or two of something, then play tug, then throw
the tennis ball, then train something else, and so forth.

I remember when we trained an auto-down on the pause table with sets
of ten. Dark days. I like the new way better.

has to choose, in response to the light, between pressing the lever
and going to food that is only available for a short interval, the
subject will choose the autoshaped behavior and forego the food!

Interesting, isn't it? A different kind of paradigm than always
eliciting a correct response. But both of them show that you don't
necessarily need to explicitly extinguish incorrect responses.

Thank you for the positive reinforcement...It will encourage me to offer more! lOl

I use shaping a great deal. What is great for this type of learning in assistance dog work is that I can be in a situation needing a behavior I have not taught yet...and with an enthusiastic 'YES' or clicker and a reward..verbal or food. I can get the behavior in a short period of time.

I developed the 'puzzle' word as a way of communicating to Raven that we are entering the 'offer freely zone' and it helps to switch our cooperation/commutation to her taking the lead instead of me giving her the cues to what I need.

I like the reference of this type of teaching I do as cooperative. I find that (cooperative) term is more readily understood by those when I try to explain operant teaching. There is a growing sense in the community I come in contact with, that operant...clicker...or positive reinforcement...equates to permissive and uncontrolled.

Having only started using this two years ago...My brain is a sponge ...but more in the fashion of a very porous sponge and much of what I read and study falls out the holes of the sponge... so I have to stay immersed in the subject to actually absorb much of what is discussed here...ugh.

I just KNOW that this manner of teaching is the closest I have ever come to the feeling of really communicating on a rewarding level with the animals I have worked with...and humans. I am thrilled that I realized how effective it is among humans also. Admittedly applied in a more subtle manor. &lt;grin&gt;

I enjoy the thought provoking conversations here I am glad to see the increase in posts...

May I make another novice suggestions...with no science behind it just experience...

Could it be you are moving ahead too quickly. when you put the targets on the floor, how far are they from you hands?

I was thinking that I would move my hands closer to the floor in small increments. until my hands are actual resting on the floor. Than I would put the target(s) further and further off of my hand and touching the floor until the targets are on the floor and not the hand. I would than in small increments remove my hand from the picture completely.

Of course you would be marking and reinforcing all correct/wanted behavior and ignoring the incorrect/unwanted behavior.

I may have missed the post where you mention the ultimate behavior you are trying to achieve with the tag/step behavior? Could you restate it ?

Many Thanks,

Diane &amp; Raven

[] &gt; In any case, I question whether petting should be last in the sequence.
I think it should predict something she already likes.

I agree with this for early in the process of teaching a come. But I'll
tell you, I taught my Greyhound to let me rather vigorously grab her collar.
That took shaping it up. That's in case she gets out and one of my family
members or I panic and grab her collar. Just in case. We don't want a
45mph dog darting away in a dangerous situation. Every now and then I still
call her, grab her collar, and give her treats.

That's why I like to keep training scenarios simple.

Where are you now?

Where do you want to end up?
What steps will you need to take between Now the Goal?

How will you maintain the ultimate behavior?

This is a simple algorithm devised by the late Dr. Israel Goldiamond.
Simple, elegant, and it sums up any behavior training program. It works
with teaching brand new behaviors, and it works with changing undesired
behaviors to desired behaviors.

"/> Hi, Diane and Raven. Lumi and I also love shaping.

I'd like to comment on what may be a difference between us, though.
It's encapsulated in your amusing phrase, the &quot;offer freely zone&quot;.

I think that's one of the things people mean when they say &quot;free
shaping&quot;: the dog offers behaviors, and the trainer chooses
particular ones to reinforce.

But I mean something different when I say it. I mean shaping without
clues. Also, I spell it without a space: freeshaping. I know some
people feel that one should just call that shaping, but to me,
shaping means successive approximations and doesn't indicate, one way
or another, how those approximations are elicited. So to me,
freeshaping means that they are elicited without giving specific
information about what is wanted.

I used to think that that meant that I wanted Lumi to offer
behaviors. You know, try backing up, try licking my hand, try
rolling over. I eventually concluded that that was not what I wanted
Lumi to offer, big behaviors like that.

Instead, I gradually started to feel that what I wanted was tiny
increments of behavior, tiny from the beginning. Say I want to
freeshape Lumi to close a door with her paw. My first click/treat
might be for Lumi's slightest glance at the door, and that might be
all I get for several reps. Soon she catches on and moves her head
that way, and then she goes to the door and so forth. She's not
pushing hard enough? I leave out a click and she tries harder the
next time. What I'm trying to illustrate is, I'm not trying to
encourage Lumi to offer random behaviors like go to the door so I can
click it. I'm trying to encourage her to let me shape her behavior
by clicking and treating the next slight variation on where she is
right now.

Another step in my thinking was when I realized that sometimes, it
seemed a lot more efficient to tell Lumi what I wanted her to do than
to try to freeshape it. That bothered me because I felt I was
turning my back on freeshaping as a technique. Then I saw another
way to look at it. What I now feel is that some behaviors are kind
of atomic, and other behaviors are chains. We still freeshape atomic
behaviors, but then we can chain them together with cues instead of
always freeshaping the chains, too.

For example, in the past, I had tried to freeshape Lumi to perform
the dog in the blanket trick, and we just couldn't get anywhere.
Then, one day I cued her through it. It turns out that she knew all
the steps, because we'd freeshaped all the atomic behaviors
required. To learn to roll herself up in a blanket, we just needed
to do the chain enough times for her to learn the sequence.

This is relevant to Eric's training puzzle. If his dog has
previously learned to target by means of freeshaping, then Eric's
discrimination objective may perhaps be looked at as a chain, and
targeting may perhaps be looked at as cueing the dog through that
chain. It's a gray area, I think. Lumi and I often use freeshaping
when we could shortcut with targeting. But when we do use targeting,
I no longer see it so much as an alternative to freeshaping, but
rather as building upon previous freeshaping.

By the way, I think you mentioned that a behavior that has been
freeshaped (I guess you said &quot;shaped&quot;) seems to be learned better
than one that is taught by other means such as targeting. I'm not
sure that that has been shown in experiments. What is of course true
is that the more reinforced a behavior is, the more likely it is to
be performed again. Well, freeshaping tends to involve a lot of
reinforcing. One might say that the &quot;problem&quot; with targeting, for
example, is that the dog learns the behavior too easily. Fewer
clicks and treats mean that the new behavior hasn't been reinforced
as much as if it had been freeshaped. One has the same &quot;problem&quot;
with a dog like Raven who's had a lot of practice with freeshaping
and therefore learns new behaviors quickly that way, too. I'm not
sure what the solution is to those problems. What I tend to do is to
maintain a continuous schedule of reinforcement for behaviors, and
hope that we build up a good stockpile of +R that way.

Well, sorry to ramble on. Those are the thoughts that came to mind
when you shared your ideas on shaping. I'll look forward to reading
more of your ideas as time goes by.

correct paw, C/T. Then I put [] &gt; the coaster down and tried again, same
cue. Invariably she got it instantly right the second time. When I say
&quot;instantly&quot;, I mean spoonful-of-tripe instantly.

Huh! That's cool.

[] &gt; We did about seven sessions altogether. By the end, she was responding
correctly to the same cue twice in succession nearly 100%. If I switched []

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; from &quot;starboard&quot; to &quot;port&quot;, that was also over 90%. If I switched from

"/>&quot;port&quot; to &quot;starboard&quot;, that was lower, maybe 65%.

What will happen when you stop with the gestures? I wonder if she might
become dependent on your gestures.

[] &gt; I'm not in favor of continuing this way. I believe that Lumi will soon
learn that &quot;starboard&quot; and &quot;port&quot; just mean &quot;the same one again&quot; or &quot;the
other one&quot;. If I [] &gt; actually cared about connecting &quot;starboard&quot; with her
right paw, I would stay away from &quot;port&quot; for days.

I guess I&quot;m confused. I thought that you were teaching right and left paws.
Are you just teaching her to respond to your gestures?

[] &gt; But the main point I wanted to show was that it did not seem to slow
the process down for us to eliminate any extinction reps. Lumi eventually
(within a [] &gt; second or two) made the correct response to every cue the
entire night, and therefore received reinforcement every time I said
&quot;starboard&quot; or &quot;port&quot; the [] &gt; entire night.

It sounds like you're doing &quot;discrete trials&quot;, which is what is done with
kids with disabilities. But since you're not teaching right and left...
well... what are you teaching? What you're describing sounds like
&quot;most-to-least&quot; prompting. Say you're teaching a child to put a puzzle
together. You want him to put the square in the square hole, but he keeps
trying to cram it in the round hole. First you put your hand over his and
move his hand to the square hole and guide the piece in. Gradually you make
your prompts smaller, so you're guiding his whole arm, then you're just
touching his hand, then you're just putting a couple of fingers on his hand,
then you just shadow his hand with yours, then you just point, then he does
it on his own.

It's really important to fade out the prompts in discrete trials ASAP
because prompt dependency is common. Same with dogs.

[] &gt; I didn't see any hint of chaining. Lumi wanted that tripe. She sought
the most efficient way to get to it. She seemed to need only one instance
of my [] &gt; reinforcing the non-chain to realize that the chain had nothing
to do with it.

Suppose she had made the same mistake a couple more times than it actually
took her. Then what?

[] I agree that, if you're not going to elicit the correct response every
time, you don't want to keep giving the cue and getting the wrong answer and
then not being
[] able to reinforce it. As you said, Eric, you want to make sure that
whatever you're asking for, the dog has at least an 80% chance of success.
I think you
[] said you're OK with 70%. I've heard 80%. I don't know what the answer
is.

Just a suggestion, but it might be confusing to change criterion within a
session, and especially within a trial. If things aren't going well, take a
break, figure out another plan of attack and start a whole new session with
the new criteria. You can see here why data is so critical.

[] * When Lumi and I are freeshaping a new behavior, the increments are
tiny, sometimes invisible to an observer.

That's a hallmark of good shaping. :-) Sometimes you take baby steps,
sometimes you leap forward. You're paying attention, you're responding to
her responding.

Anyway, we don't need to get eight for ten, or anything like that. More
likely, we get 4/4, then raise the criteria slightly, get maybe a miss
[] and then three more hits in a row, raise the criteria slightly again.
These sessions are short because I don't bring too much food to each one,
but we keep
[] going until we run out of food, then take a break to prepare some more
food.

Sounds good. If you want to go faster, take 20 pieces.

Earlier I wrote something that I want to clarify. I wrote that it might be
confusing to change criterion during a session. When you're shaping,
obviously you're going to continuously be changing criterion. What I meant
to say is that you don't want to change your goals within one session. And
if you find out what you think would work isn't working and need to change
tracks, don't do it during a session. Stop. Re-evaluate. Start again. If
you're still figuring out what you want while you're training your dog is
likely to be confused.

[AUTOSHAPING} Basically, you get the animal's attention by presenting a
bit of food periodically immediately preceeded by some salient stimulus like
a light that is right beside a lever we want the bird to press (or some
other behavior). Eventually a pigeon will start interacting with stuff and
will press the lever. As soon as he presses the lever food is delivered.
It doesn't take long for him to start pressing the lever to get food and you
can stop using the light and timed food delivery.

[] &gt; You mention eliminating the light and the timed food, but what's also
interesting is that you can keep the light and eliminate the food.
[] &gt; If I remember correctly, if you then set it up so that the subject has
to choose, in response to the light, between pressing the lever and going to
food [] &gt; that is only available for a short interval, the subject will
choose the autoshaped behavior and forego the food!

I'd have to see that experiment. A pigeon will peck a shiny light. That's
just what pigeons do. If a bird has been shaped to press a lever to get
food, he will press the lever before approaching the food hopper.
(Actually, with pigeons, they usually push buttons rather than levers, but
that's a detail.) If a bird has been taught that food is only available if
the lever is pressed and the lever only produces food if the light is on,
he'll press the lever as soon as the light comes on. My bet is this was a
lab experiment set up to see how to get the pigeon to do something one
wouldn't normally expect him to do... which is what a lot of behavioral lab
experiments are all about.

A lot of experiments have been done that vary how long food is available,
and it could depend on the preceeding conditions, and so forth.

[] Interesting, isn't it? A different kind of paradigm than always
eliciting a correct response.

[] Lots and lots of lab experiments are set up specifically to see how to
arrange conditions to get a bird or rat to emit &quot;wrong&quot; responses. Of
course they're not &quot;wrong&quot;. The rat is always right. But a lot of the
conditions set up in lab experiments aren't stuff that is going to happen in
the natural world.

But both of them show that you don't necessarily need to explicitly
extinguish incorrect responses.

[] How so, Lindsay? Was it punished? It went away, so where did it go?
I'm not being a smart ass, honestly. It sounds like you're doing
differential reinforcement... which means you're reinforcing a desired
behavior while extinguishing everything that doesn't fit. You're paying
attention to the new behavior and letting the old one go, so the old one
extinguishes.

It's possible I'm missing something since I am not really clear on the
target behavior. What am I missing?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Instead, I gradually started to feel that what I wanted was tiny increments of behavior, tiny from the beginning. Say I want to freeshape Lumi to close a door with her paw. My first click/treat might be for Lumi's slightest glance at the door, and that might be all I get for several reps. Soon she catches on and moves her head that way, and then she goes to the door and so forth. She's not pushing hard enough? I leave out a click and she tries harder the next time. What I'm trying to illustrate is, I'm not trying to encourage Lumi to offer random behaviors like go to the door so I can click it. I'm trying to encourage her to let me shape her behavior by clicking and treating the next slight variation on where she is right now.&lt;&lt;

"/> This is what I mean by shaping also. A glance, a movement of a paw, a shift in body positioning until it leads to the behavior I need or the behavior I am trying to build. I do not speak a word usually...I will click only. I will use the word yes, if I find myself without my clicker.

In the beginning it was a long process and both of us had to be very patient. As we do this more and more with different behaviors the process seems to move along more quickly depending on the end behavior I am working on... The more we do this the more she became 'clicker savvy'. When I said 'offer freely' my meaning was that she was to build on things I was marking and not wait for a verbal or body cue from me.

I used this to help teach directional behaviors. the slightest glance or movement to the left was marked and each successive increase in the movement to the left until if I clicked the glance to the left she would make a great movement to the left. After this behavior was more consistent I would give it a cue but only than would I give any cues. I shaped back, right, left, forward in that manner. Shaping has allowed me to teach many behaviors from my wheelchair or bed that would have otherwise been very difficult for me to teach.

I have to admit it was quite entertaining at times too.

I have a dog, Lad, that was not started with shaping until 5 years old. He still is not as easy to shape. He is so conditioned to waiting for a command he will not offer movement or think to pick up on the sequence of movements when we are shaping. In fact he is less likely to repeat a behavior or associate (might be a better word,) a series of movements from one session to the other. Instead he sits there staring at me waiting for me to tell him what to do next...and when that doesn't happen he defaults to a down or just sits and stares. However I was able to capture a play bow in one of our sessions and he will now bow on cue.

[] &gt; But I mean something different when I say it. I mean shaping without
clues. Also, I spell it without a space: freeshaping. I know some people
feel that one [] &gt; should just call that shaping, but to me, shaping means
successive approximations and doesn't indicate, one way or another, how
those approximations are [] &gt; elicited. So to me, freeshaping means that
they are elicited without giving specific information about what is wanted.

A lot, perhaps most, dog trainers describe freeshaping the way you do.
Technically, that's just called shaping. Shaping means you let the animal
do stuff and you reinforce it. If you give some sort of clue like
targeting, that's just shaping with targeting tacked on the front. I
understand why people want to make that distinction. Personally, I like to
keep things simple.

[] &gt; What I'm trying to illustrate is, I'm not trying to encourage Lumi to
offer random behaviors like go to the door so I can click it. I'm trying to
encourage her to [] &gt; let me shape her behavior by clicking and treating the
next slight variation on where she is right now.[]

Sounds good...

[] Another step in my thinking was when I realized that sometimes, it
seemed a lot more efficient to tell Lumi what I wanted her to do than to try
to freeshape it.
[] That bothered me because I felt I was turning my back on freeshaping as
a technique. Then I saw another way to look at it. What I now feel is that
some
[] behaviors are kind of atomic, and other behaviors are chains. We still
freeshape atomic behaviors, but then we can chain them together with cues
instead of
[] always freeshaping the chains, too.

I have a concern about overcomplicating things. Did you read the post I
made earlier this evening about the Goldiamond constructional approach? The
4 questions? The first question is &quot;where are you now?&quot; That tells you
where you need to start. Will Fido offer an approximation to the behavior
spontaneously? Then start your shaping project there. Will she probably
not offer it at all if you don't target it? Then target to get things
started. (Aside: My grandparents had a Border Collie when I was growing
up ... not the lean kind you see today,but an old farm-style BC. Her name
was Fido. She never learned not to fetch firecrackers, and in the 60s
country kids did firecrackers for months in the summer. The dog had to be
contained all during July, and if anyone heard firecrackers she had to be
found and brought in. She would fetch lit ones and try to bring them to my
grandfather, but they would, of course, blow up in her mouth. Remarkably
she died of old age! That would have been an interesting case study, no??)

[] &gt; For example, in the past, I had tried to freeshape Lumi to perform the
dog in the blanket trick, and we just couldn't get anywhere. Then, one day
I cued her [] &gt; through it. It turns out that she knew all the steps,
because we'd freeshaped all the atomic behaviors required. To learn to roll
herself up in a blanket, we just [] &gt; needed to do the chain enough times
for her to learn the sequence.

Then what did you do? Just fade out the interim cues? Did you add on a
specific cue that initiated that particular sequence? Covering herself is a
skill I want to teach my Greyhound... she gets cold and night and digs in
her bed until I get up and cover her. Who is well trained in our house?

This is relevant to Eric's training puzzle. If his dog has previously
learned to target by means of freeshaping, then Eric's discrimination
objective may perhaps be looked at as a chain, and targeting may perhaps be
looked at as cueing the dog through that chain.

[] Nitpick Warning: A chain wouldn't have the interim cues. If you're cuing
each step that's not really a behavior chain, it's just a succession of cued
behaviors. To be a behavior chain the behaviors each cue the next behavior
in the chain until you reach the end and reinforcement. Once you fade out
the interim cues that would be a chain.

By the way, I think you mentioned that a behavior that has been freeshaped
(I guess you said &quot;shaped&quot;) seems to be learned better than one that is
taught by other means such as targeting. I'm not sure that that has been
shown in experiments.
[] I don't know of an experiment off-hand, but if it hasn't been done it
should be. Bob, if you're out there lurking, did you and Marian ever do
that? OR does anyone know of another reference?

I think of it like the difference between someone driving me to a new place
and me driving myself to a new place. If I am riding in the car with
someone else to a new place that involves several turns in an area I'm not
familiar with, it is extremely unlikely I'll remember how to get there again
without directions or a map. But if I drive myself there the first time, I
am good. I can probably get there again with minimal help the next time.
In the second case I had to be aware of the environment, pick up on cues
like street signs and landmarks.

Basically, I think of targeting as sort of like leading a horse who is
wearing blinders. A dog following a target stick only pays attention to the
stick and not all the stuff in the environment he needs to know about to do
the behavior.

I think with simple behaviors like, say, pushing a door closed, a target
stick would do the trick quite quickly and efficiently. But with more
complex behavior maybe it would be better to shape the whole thing.

What is of course true is that the more reinforced a behavior is, the more
likely it is to be performed again.
[] True....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Well, freeshaping tends to involve a lot of reinforcing.

"/> [] True ...

[] &gt; One might say that the &quot;problem&quot; with targeting, for example, is that
the dog learns the behavior too easily.
[] Hey, maybe so... the dog isn't getting to access as many reinforcers.

[] &gt; Fewer clicks and treats mean that the new behavior hasn't been
reinforced as much as if it had been freeshaped.
[] I gotcha...

[] &gt; One has the same &quot;problem&quot; with a dog like Raven who's had a lot of
practice with freeshaping and therefore learns new behaviors quickly that
way, too. [] &gt; I'm not sure what the solution is to those problems. What I
tend to do is to maintain a continuous schedule of reinforcement for
behaviors, and hope that we [] &gt; build up a good stockpile of +R that way.

Sounds wise. I think Bob Bailey said this weekend that if you don't need to
go to intermittent schedules of reinforcement, don't. Sometimes you need to
get as much behavior as you can for one reinforcer, but usually not.

[] &gt; I had heard or read this reference a while back in time and I was
struck how appropriate the term was for how I felt about this method. As []

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; a cross over teacher I am continually amazed at what can be accomplished

"/> using this method.

I feel fortunate in one way that I never trained any other way. I didn't
have to re-learn it myself. The drawback is that I don't know how to help
cross-over trainers nearly as well. I don't know what specific kinds of
questions arise for them.

[] &gt; I often see the method being used improperly and with no clear
understanding of what the person is trying to accomplish... a number use the
clicker as a remote control to catch the dogs attention ... or clicking as a
correction for unwanted behavior...

Someone came into my office this week and asked if that was what a clicker
was for... to indicate an incorrect behavior. I hadn't ever heard it used
that way, but sure, it could be a marker for punishment. What a waste!
This is a student in my class and I suspect it will be interesting. Her
mother, from her report, sounds like a special ed teacher or something and
she has a lot of preconceived notions that will need to be shaped to pass
this class. Wish me luck!

[] &gt; or taking the positive teaching principle to the extreme and not
stopping 150 lb. Spot from mugging and running over Grandmother when [] &gt;
she comes in the door...all the time believing they can't or shouldn't
control the behavior because correcting the behavior would not be [] &gt; done
at that moment with a clicker and treat. Meanwhile Grandmother gets mulled
and the &quot;positive&quot; method gets a bad rap...

Oy! There's a lot to be said for good old fashioned management! Sometimes
a leash is a very good thing!

[] &gt; The more lists and proper demonstrations and debate about proper
application and encouraging and supporting those [] &gt; interested in
learning...the more the perception will change.

Do you think there is already improvement? I do. Most people have at least
heard of clicker training. And the people who are opposed to it seem a bit
hysterical on their websites, which to me is a good sign. (Sounds mean,
doesn't it?) But seriously, if they didn't think the world was changing
they wouldn't be stressing about it, they'd just go on ignoring and
belittling us. Shrill and hysterical means they think there's something to
this new way of doing things. (That's the way I prefer to view it anyway!)

And those of you who continually, encourage and reward us as novices
allowing us to pick your brain and ask repetitive questions....Thank you...
[] You don't sound like a novice to me! Honestly, with school I spend so
little time training my animals it's embarrassing.

In DR, only 80% of the cues result in reinforcement. In DR, if every
cue is resulting in reinforcement, the trainer hasn't raised the
criteria fast enough.

But in my &quot;errorless protocol&quot;, every cue results in the correct
response, so every cue results in the dog being reinforced. The dog
never makes an incorrect response. She just discovers that some
responses get her to the cookies faster than others. She never gets
discouraged, because the treats keep coming no matter what she does.
And the prompts are gradually faded automatically by the dog's own
desire to get the treats as quickly as possible, so she gradually
stops depending on the prompts and gradually stops using an
inefficient response.

by whacking the right coaster with her right paw, and to respond to &quot;port&quot;
by [] &gt; whacking the left coaster with her left paw. I thought that that was
Eric's objective, with different cues of course. I hope I didn't
misunderstand.

[] The purpose of the gestures is to guarantee that every cue will be
reinforced. They come later and later after the verbal cue, and Lumi depends
on them less and less because she wants to get the cookie as quickly as she
can.

[] Oh, yes, yes... This is exactly what discrete trial training is with
people with disabilities. It's basically prompted training to do tasks.
One situation may involve initially prompting the behavior pretty early so
the learner doesn't screw up, then as you become more and more confident
she's going to get it right you delay the prompt. Before long the learner
does the behavior without a prompt. (That's called most-to-least prompting
because you give a big obvious prompt early on then fade it away.)

[] &gt; It's really important to fade out the prompts in discrete trials ASAP
because prompt dependency is common. Same with dogs.

If you use high value treats and you make the increments tiny enough and you
gradually delay the visual cues (&quot;prompts&quot;), the dog does the fading for
you.
If[] y ou use high value treats and you make the increments tiny enough and
you gradually delay the visual cues (&quot;prompts&quot;), the dog does the fading for
you.

It's the same thing. You let the learner's behavior guide how much you're
going to prompt.

As I mentioned earlier, it's analogous to classical conditioning.
In classical conditioning, the mechanism is that &quot;CS -&gt; US -&gt; UR&quot; becomes
&quot;CS -&gt; CR&quot;. The same thing happens here: &quot;cue -&gt; prompt -&gt; behavior&quot; becomes
&quot;cue -&gt; behavior&quot;.

[] Just as long as you understand that with a reinforcer involved in the
training process you're dealing with operant behavior. There are different
kinds of antecedents and not all of them are classical. There is one kind
called a discriminitive stimulus (which is abbreviated SD... the D would be
a superscript if I would do that here.) An SD tells a learner that if he
performs the behavior a reinforcer is likely to be delivered. (He may
think, &quot;Oh! The last time I heard that word and did this behavior, I got
cheese! I'll try it again!&quot;). The SD would not elicit the behavior if it
were not for the possibility of the reinforcer being delivered. In this
case your cue and prompt are just ways to get the behavior like targeting or
luring.

A CS will elicit behavior without any reinforcer. A fuzzy area in a lot of
writing for dog trainers is that distinction between classical and operant.
In classical behavior, the unconditioned stimulus or the conditioned
stimulus elicits the behavior with no consequence being involved in the
scenario. If you blow in my eye, I'm going to blink whether or not it
provides relief. It just happens. That's classical (now called
respondent.) But there are antecedent stimuli that are NOT classical.

[] &gt; Suppose she had made the same mistake a couple more times than it
actually took her. Then what?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;It means I've gone too fast. I'd need to back up the criteria to where

"/> she's getting it right without mistakes.
[] Sounds like you've learned how to read her so that you move at the right
pace... no small accomplishment!

[] &gt; I'd have to see that experiment. A pigeon will peck a shiny light.
That's just what pigeons do. If a bird has been shaped to press a lever to
get food, he will press the [] &gt; lever before approaching the food hopper.
(Actually, with pigeons, they usually push buttons rather than levers, but
that's a detail.) If a bird has been taught that food is [] &gt; only available
if the lever is pressed and the lever only produces food if the light is on,
he'll press the lever as soon as the light comes on. My bet is this was a
lab [] &gt; experiment set up to see how to get the pigeon to do something one
wouldn't normally expect him to do... which is what a lot of behavioral lab
experiments are all about.

[] &gt; I thought that Pam Reid described what I mentioned above. I don't think
I've read about autoshaping anywhere else.

[] It's from the behavior analytic literature. It's old Skinner box stuff.
It's still being done in a lot of complex experiments.

&gt;How so, Lindsay? Was it punished? It went away, so where did it go?

[] &gt; The incorrect response goes away, but not because it was punished, and
not because it was extinguished. It goes away because it was inefficient.

[] That's what extinction is. She was getting more bang for her buck
performing other behaviors. The ones that didn't pay off got left in the
dust because they were extinguished. You don't have to DO extinction
consciously. It's a natural phenomenon.

[] &gt; Visualize Lumi swimming straight out from shore. I call out &quot;left&quot;. No
matter what she does, an instant later, her water toy lands immediately to
her left.
[] This is different from what you were describing above. Above you'
mentioned inefficient behaviors that went away. Now you're describing
prompts. Tossing a toy where you want her to go is just targeting with a
thrown toy.

&gt;Am I punishing or extinguishing wrong responses? No. Every time I cue
&quot;left&quot;, she gets reinforced. Soon, she begins to turn left when she hears
the cue.
[] Sure... but only because you toss the toy over there, and then, I
presume, fade it out. If this is what you're doing, you're using a
prompting procedure, like what I described before.

[] &gt; In DR, only 80% of the cues result in reinforcement.

[] ???? This is news to me! In DR one behavior is reinforced while another
(or more than one) are allowed to extinguish. Period. You can do a bunch
of them in a row and you might find out that you sometimes get 80% correct,
but sometimes you may also get 100% if you're really good and your learner
has nailed it, or 60% if you're training and watching Oprah at the same
time, or 20% dog is full from stealing a turkey carcass from the trash .
The percentage of correct responses is not a characteristic of DR. It's
just a percentage of correct responses.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In DR, if every cue is resulting in reinforcement, the trainer hasn't

"/> raised the criteria fast enough.
[] Not so! In DR if every cue is resulting in reinforcement it means that
may be a very fine trainer. Remember that DR only involves changing
criterion if it is done in shaping. Shaping is the differential
reinforcement of successive approximations toward a target behavior. That's
the basic defintion. Differential reinforcement is reinforcing one behavior
while allowing others to extinguish. Shaping involves changing criterion.
DR used alone involves static criterion. (And of course both are natural
processes that we have harnessed for our use, but that also occur in nature
without our help.)

The trainer who achieves 100% (whether in DR alone or in shaping) is doing
everything right. She is matching her criterion to the abilities of her
learner at this moment.

But in my &quot;errorless protocol&quot;, every cue results in the correct response,
so every cue results in the dog being reinforced. The dog never makes an
incorrect response. She just discovers that some responses get her to the
cookies faster than others. She never gets discouraged, because the treats
keep coming no matter what she does.
[] Which sounds like a perfectly good program! It's great when learner
zeros in quickly on what works and goes for it!

Well, after a lot of great input and feedback, I am forced to come to an
unpleasant but unfortunately true conclusion.

MY TIMING SUCKS.my dog is fast but I need to be faster on the click if I'm
going to capture the exact thing I want.

And so does my ability to split behaviors.

Back to the drawing boards. I'll try some things and come back with data
next week (we have an agility trial this weekend that we're practicing for).

Thanks again to everyone for a lot of great information!

"/> I use Google about a hundred times a day. But it seem it's never

It appears that my &quot;evolving definition&quot; of EL in dog-training is
about the same as the one described for teaching skills acquisition
to autistic children in:

http://www.christinaburkaba.com/ELvsNNP.htm

As Kellie suggested, the article states: &quot;EL is a system of most to
least prompting&quot;.

By the way, the article also discusses No-no-prompting (NNP), which
is a system of least to most prompting. The author writes:

&quot;While NNP may seem like it fosters independence, and may in some
cases do so, in my opinion it can also teach a chain of errors, thin
the reinforcement schedule such that learning can become aversive,
slow the rate of teaching, make kids prompt dependent, and misuse the
child's learning time. EL done correctly can and likely will prevent
these teaching problems.&quot;

I found a distinctly different definition of EL as a method of
teaching &quot;domain specific knowledge to amnesic patients&quot; developed by
Baddeley and Wilson (1994). I also ran across a distinction between
&quot;traditional&quot; errorless training and one or more newer errorless
training methods. So EL does not seem to have a completely locked-in
definition.

Google had about 15,000 hits for &quot;errorless learning&quot;. I didn't look
at all of them. :0) But I think the most-to-least-prompting
definition is well represented.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;By the way, I think you mentioned that a behavior that has been freeshaped (I guess you said &quot;shaped&quot;) seems to be learned better than one that is taught by other means such as targeting. I'm not sure that that has been shown in experiments. &lt;&lt;

"/> I don't know about experiments... I know that it is my experience with the creatures I have taught. I don't know if I said &quot;better&quot; if I did I misspoke. I use all the mentioned methods in my teaching. Targeting; luring; shaping; capturing...

It is my experience that when I have shaped a behavior, allowing the dog to think through the process and figure it out themselves, incrementally, that the dog appears to remember and use the behavior in analyzing a situation.

I use these methods of teaching predominantly in teaching assistance dogs. That is were my perspective comes from. The assistance dog often has to analyze a situation by behaviors it has learned previously because the human partner is unable to cue or otherwise guide the behavior.
Examples:
1-partner has a seizure, the dog needs to push a speed dial button on a phone to contact 911 and than bark.
2-partners cane has fallen under a couch or table the dog needs to use directional behaviors in dislodging the cane form the legs of the piece of furniture and the partner may not be able to see to direct the behavior.
3-a dog sniffs the breath of diabetic and signals the response to too high levels or too low levels. this isn't cued it is something the dog responds to but the response behavior is one that has to be preformed without cue once the response behavior is taught.

I hope I am explaining myself well. This makes sense in my mind and works in the context I use it...is it something that can be proven by the science (?) I don't know...but I would like to learn.

My experimentation is within my own frame of use. And my conclusions are formed by repeated evidence of my results.

It is important to me to be able to develop a thinking dog that can analyze a situation and use what it has learned to work through that situation.

Did anyone here watch the Eukanuba National Championships? Did you see the Ace award for Leana and Faith? They are an assistance dog team that demonstrated the principles I am speaking about. Leana became unconscious and fell to the floor from her wheel chair. the taught behavior was for the dog, Faith, to bring the phone receiver to Leana when she fell from the chair. another behavior that was taught was to press the speed dial on the phone. these were both cued behaviors up to this point and practiced and reinforced frequently. In this situation Leana was not able to cue Faith to perform these behaviors. When Faith brought the phone to Leana and Leana did not take the phone as usual the dog returned to the phone base and pressed the speed dial and began barking. To add to the wonder of this method of teaching, the dog had been taught to recognized emergency personnel uniforms...so when the police knocked at the door the dog opened the locked door and lead them to his unconscious and critically ill partner. They show a reenactment of Faith performing these behaviors (on cue) as she did that evening without cues because she was able to analyze the situation and use what she was taught with reward based methods. What was Faiths reward...someone was there to help her partner who was in crisis.

That may be a emotional look at the behavior that was demonstrated by Faith and many other dogs who saves lives by responding in this manor. But that is the science that works for me under the circumstance.

I would love to understand the physiology and science of it all in hopes of being a better teacher using that knowledge.

My own experience is not quite so dramatic. When Raven was a year old she had been taught (by shaping) to take hold of a ball attached to my walker and maneuver my walker to me when I needed it, on cue. One day I had found myself outside exiting my van. My legs would not work well enough to walk with the cane I had been using. I cued Raven to cross the parking lot and bring me my walker. She took hold of the ball and started dragging my walker to me. However, the lot has a fairly steep slope and she had difficulty stopping the walker from drifting down hill. To my amazement I watched this dog stop in her tracks for about 30 seconds holding on to the ball so the walker did not roll down the driveway...with her eyes moving from side to side in thought ...when she all of sudden she positioned herself behind the walker...so that it rested against her body and proceeded to put her paws up on the walker and literally walk the walker to me. I never taught her do that behavior. I had taught her to put her body against things and push them, I had taught her to put her paws on things to retrieve from counters and tables. It was her analyzing the situation and freedom this method teaches that, IMHO, helped her to problem solve... one of those immensely rewarding moments that stills makes my heart beat a little faster when I think about it.

sorry this was so long.....
Passion or obsession? I don't know!? but this whole process gets my adrenaline pumping!

&gt;&gt;I feel fortunate in one way that I never trained any other way. I didn't have to re-learn it myself. The drawback is that I don't know how to help cross-over trainers nearly as well. I don't know what specific kinds of questions arise for them. &lt;&lt;

"/> I will share what some of my hurdles were in the &quot;crossing over&quot; process.

Muscle response...
After thirty years of conditioned muscle response that came with the corrections I used, I would jerk the lead without conscious thought. It still sneaks in occasionally if my patience is getting thin. What I found helped me to break this automatic response was a hands free lead. It you don't hold it you can't jerk it! lol

Tone of voice...
The tone of voice that I use was a dominant demanding tone for thirty years...well! if you demand in a drill sergeants tone of voice a sit...whether rewarded or not the muscles of the dog I was trying to use reward based methods on..still tighten and the ears would fold back...You get the picture.
I realized that terminology had a big part in my body language, tone of voice and overall approach to the training I was trying do.
So...Command changed to cue and my voice lightened along with my mental processing of cues.
Training changed to teaching...again the mental process that the change of terminology made in my own behavior and livery.
And this continued through the two year process...that is still an on going process for me. &quot;when you are with the dog, one of you is always learning&quot; I don't know who said that originally but it certainly is true for me.
With the command mentality changing to mark and request I found that even my body language and tension began to change and the process of teaching became so much fun and self rewarding to me and a truer bond and trust began to build beyond what I had experienced over the previous 30 years.

I am not spouting what is right and what wrong jargon...because I could train behaviors the old way...but for me...I didn't enjoy it as much as I do with this method. My body took a beating with the other method. And as my disability began to challenge my ability to do things as I was originally taught, I welcomed the gentler and more mind challenging method of reward based teaching.

The mental thought that is involved in breaking down a wanted behavior and teaching each foundation behavior and than linking them is the easiest most efficient method is my biggest challenge. I often still struggle with the best way to develop a plan for teaching a wanted behavior.

I don't know if that helps...but that is my story.

"/> Do you think there is already improvement? I do. Most people have at least heard of clicker training. And the people who are opposed to it seem a bit hysterical on their websites, which to me is a good sign&lt;&lt;

I DO believe it is changing...if my experience recently is any evidence. I was in my chair socializing a 6 month old SDIT (service dog in training) at wal-mart. A lady saw me using the clicker and rewarding to reinforce the dogs attention on me and for calm behavior. She began asking me questions because she just recently got a puppy. After one hour plus and a few more people gathered around joining in the conversation and asking questions I was exhausted...thankfully I did have Raven with me to show some of the basics in response to specific questions. And a helper that took the 6 month old pup in training, Mazel, out of the situation, early, which was way to stimulating for her stage of teaching, and I was not able to give her my 100% attention any longer.

There is a great deal of interest, fascination and amazement at what this method is all about. I wish there were more broadcasts and public education about the method.

I'm a long-time lurker around here, but I will have a go at this one...
Although I loved the Egg Game (everyone was talking about it at Training
Levels list), the game I found better at improving clicker skills was this
one, at Debi Davis site:  http://clickertales.com/clickertimingame.html

Her homepage is down, but this link still works perfectly. Most people are
probably familiar with this game: a Bird, in what looks like a Skinner box,
offering four differente behaviors. You have to be precise in your clicks in
order to increase the rate of response for each specific behavior. I guess
that was one of the best tools to improve my timing, specially because the
behavior is totally unpredictable (which is differente from the Egg Game).

Oh, and by the way, that website for the Egg Game is down, now, but the game
is still available at:  http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal  - You have to
click on the third square (from left) of the 6th row (from above) to find
it.

"/> Sounds dramatic to me! Amazing story.

Raven had been taught the goal of the cue, and had somehow learned
that how to perform it was beside the point. Her reinforcement
history had included reinforcement for innovation.

Thinking about other trained dogs, including Lumi, I realize how
different our goals and methods must be for some situations. Would a
sports competitor in obedience, field trials, agility, tracking, etc.
want a dog to be improvising or innovating during an event?

Yet it may not vary from one team to another, as much as from one
situation to another. For me, I can imagine wanting both ends of the
spectrum at different times:

* In agility, I want Lumi attuned to my cues. I do not want her
deciding for herself how to run the course.
* In an emergency, I'd want the opposite, the kind of independence
Raven and Faith displayed.
* In freestyle, I want _both_: Lumi contributing her own creativity
and preferences as we work out the choreography of a routine, but
responding precisely to cues in a show.

How unreasonable is that?

By the way, the most powerful lesson I take from the stories you told
in this post was this: If Raven and Faith had been taught that
innovation is punished, neither of you would have had the experiences
you related. Dogs don't always do what we want, what we cue. But
Raven and Faith, and I hope Lumi, at the minimum are not afraid to
think for themselves for fear of some unpleasant consequence.

Thanks for sharing those fascinating and moving stories.

I don't think that is unreasonable at all.
There are times when it is VERY important that an assistance dog only follow cues and must stay in a strict set of standards.

That is why I found it useful to use the 'puzzle' word to communicate the difference to her.

If we are coming up on a door that need to be opened...if using an automatic button to open the door...the dog needs to wait to be cued. Why, when they have done it 1000 times and would automatically push the button when we approach? Because there may be a child on the other side that could be hit by the door. My chair may not be positioned properly and I could be hit by the door. I may not be ready to enter the door or may just be passing by the button area.

this a small example...but there could be hazards the dog is not aware of ...or publicly acceptable behavior is required....or a needle is dropped in the hospital and the dog wants to retrieve it...or I drop a pill and Raven is conditioned to pick things up for me when I drop them...these things must be controlled.

Is Lumi an assistance dog?

this has really go my juices going...I am going to have to go and get my fix for the day...that fix being a session of reward based teaching...what should we do today..? LOL

Let me be sure I understand the terminology correctly...

[] &gt; when I link 'take/hold/pull/back' to have a dog open a frig door...this
is 'linking' and once I have progressed with this process and [] &gt;
[take/hold/pull/back]=open frig and the linked behaviors are now on one cue
that is a chained behavior...am I understanding this [] &gt; correctly.
Yeah, that's how I would look at it. I've never heard the term linking used
but it works.

Terminology is often the cause of confusion and miscommunication. Thank
you,
[] That gives ms a chance to say why I'm such a stickler about it. If we're
all using terms slightly differently, or very differently, it makes it very
hard to have a useful conversation. Since most of this terms have
long-established meanings I find it helpful to stick to those meanings then
come up with a new term only when a new meaning needs to be expressed.

The dog trainers' use of &quot;freeshaping&quot; is overkill. There's a term for that
already, and it's &quot;shaping&quot;. When we start calling shaping &quot;freeshaping&quot;
that makes it sound like shaping is something different. The meaning of
shaping stayed the same. What happened is that someone invented the word
&quot;freeshaping&quot; and now everyone thinks &quot;shaping&quot; is shaped behavior that is
cued or prompted. That's not what shaping means. In order to use the word
Freeshaping, people had to change the meaning of Shaping. That wasn't
necessary. Shaping was already a word that meant what they introduced
Freeshaping to mean.

If you want a NEW word, it should be put on shaped behavior that is cued or
shaped and let shaping keep its original meaning.

(And it definitely was not just Lindsay... everyone in dog training seems to
use the superfluous term.)

M uscle response...

[] &gt; After thirty years of conditioned muscle response that came with the
corrections I used, I would jerk the lead without conscious [] &gt; thought.
It still sneaks in occasionally if my patience is getting thin. What I
found helped me to break this automatic response was a [] &gt; hands free lead.
It you don't hold it you can't jerk it! lol

I went to a Corally Burmaster seminar some time ago and she said she had to
put the leash under her foot or not use one to break that habit.

[] &gt; Tone of voice...
[] &gt; The tone of voice that I use was a dominant demanding tone for thirty
years...well! if you demand in a drill sergeants tone of voice a [] &gt;
sit...whether rewarded or not the muscles of the dog I was trying to use
reward based methods on..still tighten and the ears would [] &gt; fold
back...You get the picture.

Yes! My cousin took her little Bichon Frise to obedience classes quite a
few years ago, and was told her voice was not dominant enough. She has a
delicate voice. She told the trainer, &quot;But this is my voice!&quot; When we told
me this I was with one of my dogs, and I looked at the dog and whispered,
&quot;Sit&quot;. The dog sat quite happily, and ... I assured her that not only was a
dominant tone of voice unnecessary, but so was the choke chain and all the
other forceful stuff.

[] &gt; I realized that terminology had a big part in my body language, tone of
voice and overall approach to the training I was trying do.
[] &gt; So...Command changed to cue and my voice lightened along with my mental
processing of cues.

This has been troubling for me. I see a lot of trainers ... even clicker
trainers ... who have fierce firm facial expressions, and bark their
directions at the dog. I find this disheartening. I know it has been
reinforced for these trainers, but for me, I just want to enjoy my dogs'
company. I want them to respond to cues because it's worth their while to
do so. I don't want them to respond because they're scared not to.

[] &gt; With the command mentality changing to mark and request I found that
even my body language and tension began to change and [] &gt; the process of
teaching became so much fun and self rewarding to me and a truer bond and
trust began to build beyond what I had [] &gt; experienced over the previous 30
years.

You know, even your facial expression can change your entire demeanor.
Smiling ... even if you have to force it... results in more happiness. I'm
not sure why this is but my bet is that the underlying chemical and muscular
processes are connected to that behavior, so if you smile enough you get a
little natural high... and of course if you smile you get different
consequences from the environment than if you're constantly barking at
people. I spent a lot of years with severe depression and was on medication
for years. One of the best tools for overcoming it was to force myself to
smile when I didn't feel like it. Another was to get out and DO FUN STUFF
with PEOPLE I HAVE FUN WITH!!! That's hard to initiate when you're
depressed, but they're powerful tools.

[] &gt; I am not spouting what is right and what wrong jargon...because I could
train behaviors the old way...but for me...I didn't enjoy it as [] &gt; much as
I do with this method.

Sounds wise.

[] My body took a beating with the other method. And as my disability
began to challenge my ability to do things as I was originally
[] taught, I welcomed the gentler and more mind challenging method of
reward based teaching.

Ah, so it is practical, too!

[] The mental thought that is involved in breaking down a wanted behavior
and teaching each foundation behavior and than linking them
[] is the easiest most efficient method is my biggest challenge. I often
still struggle with the best way to develop a plan for teaching a
[] wanted behavior.

You might consider trying some back chaining with a lot of behavior chains.
It's a nifty tool that gets the animal close to the reinforcer early on.
The animal knows the last behaviors in the chain very well, plus knows that
the terminal reinforcer is coming, so they actually get better as they go
through the chain.

There is no qualifier for that. Shaping just means the process itself. No

or happened when the cat fell out of the tree, it doesn't matter. The
beginning of the behavior is not the shaping process. Shaping is the
differential reinforcement of successive approximations to a target
behavior-- period.

[] Perhaps you disagree that shaping has ever had the broad meaning of

????? Shaping ALWAYS has the meaning of training with successive
approximations. How would I disagree with that? That's exactly what it
means. It's the meanings that add qualifiers that I disagree with.

That is right, and it's not that I &quot;feel&quot; it, it's that the definition of

not shaping. That is &quot;guiding with a target stick&quot;.

remind us that we did not invent this stuff, and if we are constantly
complicating basic principles, we're going to spend all our time in a big
training quagmire. Simplify! Simplify!

If you start out shaping by using only what the animal offers, that's
shaping. (Dog trainers RE-named it freeshaping, but that wasn't necessary.
That was already what the word meant.)

If you start out guiding the animal with a target stick then move into
shaping, that's shaping where the initial behavior was gotten by guiding
with a target stick. It's still shaping.

The target lure is tacked on to the shaping procedure. It's NOT part of the
shaping. It's just a way to get started.

Here's an analogy. Say I want to drive to the store. I get in the car, put
the key in the ignition, turn it until I hear the engine turn over, put it
in gear and push the gas pedal. The car moves and I guide it by turning the
steering wheel while keeping my foot on the pedal, adjusting speed and
direction depending on what is on my path.

Is putting the key in the ignition and turning it called driving? What if I
turned the key in the ignition then put the car in gear then put the gear
back in park, turned off the key and got out. Would you say I had been
driving?

No, the only part of the process we would call driving is the part where I'm
pushing the gas pedal and the car is moving. If my husband called me on my
cell phone and I was turning the key in the ignition, I wouldn't tell him I
was driving, I would tell them I was getting ready to drive somewhere.

Targeting or luring or cuing to start a behavior is like turning the key in
the ignition and putting the car in gear. It can get the process started,
but the part called shaping is the part where you're differentially
reinforcing successive approximations to a target behavior. The shaping is
the DRIVING.

How you get the first behavior doesn't matter.

Just like we don't need a different name for driving that is done after we
turned the key in the ignition and driving that is done after the car is
hotwired, we don't need a different name for shaping that is started by
targeting and shaping that is started because the animal offered a behavior.

Lindsay,
You bring up an interesting point.

I have used the term freeshaping myself from time to time as a fast and easy way of expressing the shaping behavior ...to me this meant 'free of cues' ; 'free of targeting'; 'free of luring' and 'free to innovate'. However, it is not a term I use often or with much thought in the terms you presented. I do however capture behaviors as a whole at times during a shaping session. Like a yawn or scratch.....

My description of shaping (as I used it here) is with no verbal cues, no body cues, you are strictly a marker and could not be in the room at all an just observe from a camera an click as long as there was a way of delivering the reward. (TnT, smile)

If I use a body or verbal signal of any kind I consider it a cue behavior.

If I use a tool such as a hand, target stick, postit note, sticker, jar lid... etc... I view that a targeted behavior.

If I use a reward in hand guided process, or enticed behavior, I consider it a lured behavior.

If the dog naturally does a behavior...yawn, wag, bark, (and even sometimes sit, down) etc. and I click and reward I consider that a captured behavior.

Maybe too simplistic, and maybe more of an issue to me if I was teaching a class and wanted to clearly distinguish the explanation of a method to the humans. I do find it a challenge when in this type of situation and express clearly what method I am using to teach a behavior... or to thorough understand how someone else taught a behavior.

Is there an &quot;official&quot; list of terminology somewhere in the annals?

If I understand you, Kellie, the following are true:

* Prompted behavior - reinforce behaviors that meet criteria elicited
through use of prompts (lures, body pressure, targeting, etc.)
* Shaped behavior - reinforce behaviors that meet criteria offered
with not prompt present

So, in training my dog to circle left, I offer a hand target of the first 3
trials to get the dog to offer a reinforceable behavior - this is prompted
behavior. I then do nothing and wait for the dog who then offers
reinforceable behavior on his own - this is shaped behavior. (Reinforceable
= meets criteria)

And what you are saying is that the term &quot;Shaping&quot;, in your experience, has
come to have a common meaning of any offered or PROMPTED behavior that is
differentially reinforced to shape a greater target behavior and that
&quot;Freeshaping&quot; really represents the classical definition of &quot;Shaping&quot; which
pertains to unprompted behaviors only. Do I have that right?

I have never actually understood the distinction between the two terms.
I've never actually used &quot;Freeshaping&quot; to describe any training I've done.
I have used the term &quot;Captured&quot; to describe the reinforcement of found
behaviors offered spontaneously. But, even with the term &quot;Captured&quot;, I
think the correct terminology would be that the initial behavior was
&quot;Captured&quot; but subsequent unprompted offerings were &quot;Shaped&quot; to create the
final behavior.

I agree with you on this Kellie. It may be fun to create new terms for
variations on a theme but it makes discussion difficult. Much better to
have a small set of clearly defined terms on which to base discourse.

Thanks for pushing toward clear communication.

* Shaping: training with successive approximations
* Shaping + qualifier: a particular way of shaping

So one kind of shaping is Morgan's way: shaping with a target stick.
Another way of shaping is with no clues.

I'd like a word for shaping with no clues: freeshaping.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you start out shaping by using only what the animal offers,
&gt; that's shaping. (Dog trainers RE-named it freeshaping, but that
&gt; wasn't necessary. That was already what the word meant.)

&gt; If you start out guiding the animal with a target stick then move
&gt; into shaping, that's shaping where the initial behavior was gotten
&gt; by guiding with a target stick. It's still shaping.

&gt; The target lure is tacked on to the shaping procedure. It's NOT
&gt; part of the shaping. It's just a way to get started.

"/> I'm sorry, Kellie, but if you say that an approximation elicited with
a target stick does not count as shaping, then your statement that
shaping means training with successive approximations is
inconsistent. Eliciting with a target stick, and marking with a
clicker, is still &quot;the differential reinforcement of successive
approximations to a target behavior&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Here's an analogy. Say I want to drive to the store. I get in the
&gt; car, put the key in the ignition, turn it until I hear the engine
&gt; turn over, put it in gear and push the gas pedal. The car moves
&gt; and I guide it by turning the steering wheel while keeping my foot
&gt; on the pedal, adjusting speed and direction depending on what is on
&gt; my path.

&gt; Is putting the key in the ignition and turning it called driving?
&gt; What if I turned the key in the ignition then put the car in gear
&gt; then put the gear back in park, turned off the key and got out.
&gt; Would you say I had been driving?

&gt; No, the only part of the process we would call driving is the part
&gt; where I'm pushing the gas pedal and the car is moving. If my
&gt; husband called me on my cell phone and I was turning the key in the
&gt; ignition, I wouldn't tell him I was driving, I would tell them I
&gt; was getting ready to drive somewhere.

&gt; Targeting or luring or cuing to start a behavior is like turning
&gt; the key in the ignition and putting the car in gear. It can get
&gt; the process started, but the part called shaping is the part where
&gt; you're differentially reinforcing successive approximations to a
&gt; target behavior. The shaping is the DRIVING.

&gt; How you get the first behavior doesn't matter.

&gt; Just like we don't need a different name for driving that is done
&gt; after we turned the key in the ignition and driving that is done
&gt; after the car is hotwired, we don't need a different name for
&gt; shaping that is started by targeting and shaping that is started
&gt; because the animal offered a behavior.

"/> Please don't take offense, but here's how I read your driving analogy:

Conversation One:

&quot;How did you get the car going?&quot;

&quot;I started the engine.&quot;

&quot;Did you use a key, or did you hotwire?&quot;

&quot;The word 'hotwire' has no value. It was just started.&quot;

Conversation Two:

&quot;How was the dog trained?&quot;

&quot;She was shaped.&quot;

&quot;Did you use targeting to elicit the approximations, or did you
freeshape?&quot;

&quot;The word 'freeshape' has no value. She was just shaped.&quot;

[] &gt; Seriously now, I do want understand to understand.[] what you are
saying, Kellie, is the *in the beginning* the term shaping was used to [] &gt;
denote a method where the handler/controller could lure, capture or use
targeting tools...

In the very first &quot;hand shaping&quot; experiment, a pigeon was taught to whack a
little wooden ball with his beak to knock over a bunch of little wooden pins
in a game of pigeon bowling. Here's how B.F. SKinner described it.

&quot;In 1943 Keller Breland, Norman Guttman, and I were working on a war-time
project sponsored by General Mills, Inc. Our laboratory was the top floor of
a flour mill in Minneapolis, where we spent a good deal of time waiting for
decisions to be made in Washington. All day long, around the mill, wheeled
great flocks of pigeons. They were easily snared on the window sills and
proved to be an irresistible supply of experimental subjects. ...This was
serious research, but we had our lighter moments. One day we decided to
teach a pigeon to bowl. The pigeon was to send a wooden ball down a
miniature alley toward a set of toy pins by swiping the ball with a sharp
sideward movement of the beak. To condition the response, we put the ball on
the floor of an experimental box and prepared to operate the food-magazine
as soon as the first swipe occurred. But nothing happened. Though we had all
the time in the world, we grew tired of waiting. We decided to reinforce any
response which had the slightest resemblance to a swipe -- perhaps, at
first, merely the behavior of looking at the ball -- and then to select
responses which more closely approximated the final form. The result amazed
us. In a few minutes, the ball was caroming off the walls of the box as if
the pigeon had been a champion squash player. The spectacle so impressed
Keller Breland that he gave up a promising career in psychology and went
into the commercial production of behavior.&quot; (Skinner, 1958, p. 94)
(Emphasis added. kss)

Doesn't that sound just like what people today are calling &quot;Freeshaping&quot;? It
should. It is. Note that this took place in 1943 and was written about in
1958 by one of the guys who was there. Marian Breland Bailey was involved
in this, too.

But keep in mind that what happened in Skinner boxes, when they were set up
to provide reinforcers for certain behaviors was also shaping... the animal
had to try a bunch of stuff working closer and closer to a target behavior
before he hit pay dirt. And that was already happening regularly when they
did the thing up on the General Mills Bldg.

Now, Skinner had written about shaping in the Behavior of Organisms in 1938,
but he did not call it that yet. In that book he wrote a chapter on the
&quot;Differentiation of Response&quot; and talked about successive approximations.
The thing was that at that time no one had intentionally shaped anything by
hand. The operant chambers (SKinner Boxes) were set up to provide
reinforcers based on certain behaviors, and when it happened it happened.
Yes, shaping was occuring, but it wasn't manually controlled. It wasn't
until the incident above that they got the delight of shaping a behavior
from scratch.

Skinner wrote about this incident several times and in those later
descriptions called it &quot;shaping&quot;. Here's an example.
&quot;I well remember the day when Norman Guttman, Keller Breland, and I ...
dispens[ed] with the mechanical contingencies and reinforc[ed] successive
approximations to a complex response by hand. By operating a food dispenser
with a hand switch we taught a pigeon to strike a wooden ball with a swiping
motion of its beak and to knock the ball about its cage, rather in the
manner of a squash player. Shaping complex behavior through a programmed
sequence of contingencies is now so commonplace that it is hard to
understand why we should have been amazed at the speed with which this was
done.&quot; (Skinner, 1972, p. 3) [footnote added by GBP]

Gail Peterson commented this way: &quot;Skinner's big surprise ... revolved
around (1) the efficacy of implementing a program of successive
approximation by simply watching the animal and operating the reinforcement
device by hand, rather than by mechanical adjustment of the physical
environment, &quot; (Peterson, 2000)

The actual word &quot;Shaping&quot; showed up in 1951 in an article in the Scientific
American entitled &quot;How To Teach Animals&quot;. Here's what he wrote, &quot;The
reinforcement gives you a means of control over the behavior of the animal.
It rests on the simple principle that whenever something reinforces a
particular activity of an organism, it increases the chances that the
organism will repeat that behavior. This makes it possible to shape an
animal's behavior almost as a sculptor shapes a lump of clay. There is, of
course, nothing new in this principle. What is new is a better understanding
of the conditions under which reinforcement works best.&quot; (Skinner, 1951, pp.
26-27)

[] &gt; If I understand you, Kellie, the following are true:

* [] &gt; Prompted behavior - reinforce behaviors that meet criteria
elicited through use of prompts (lures, body pressure, targeting, etc.)

*

[] &gt; Shaped behavior - reinforce behaviors that meet criteria
offered with not prompt present

Yes, I'd go there. The point of this long discussion has been that you can
prompt the first behavior to get something started to shape. But the prompt
isn't part of the shaping procedure. It's just the ignition.

[] &gt; So, in training my dog to circle left, I offer a hand target of the
first 3 trials to get the dog to offer a reinforceable behavior - this is []

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; prompted behavior. I then do nothing and wait for the dog who then offers

"/> reinforceable behavior on his own - this is shaped [] &gt; behavior.
(Reinforceable = meets criteria)

Sounds right.

[] &gt; And what you are saying is that the term &quot;Shaping&quot;, in your experience,
has come to have a common meaning of any offered or [] &gt; PROMPTED behavior
that is differentially reinforced to shape a greater target behavior and
that &quot;Freeshaping&quot; really represents the [] &gt; classical definition of
&quot;Shaping&quot; which pertains to unprompted behaviors only. Do I have that
right?

Shaping is the term used in the literature to mean differential
reinforcement of successive approximations to a target behavior. How that
first behavior was initiated doesn't matter. It could be prompted or
unprompted. It's still shaping. If you use some ignition to start a
behavior, just say, &quot;I got the dog to turn to the left by using a hand
target. Then I stopped targeting and shaped successive approximations that
were offered.&quot;

My point is that &quot;freeshaping&quot; is a superfluous term. We don't need it. If
it's necessary, say how the behavior was started, then say you shaped it
from there. If the dog spontaneously offered a behavior that you then
shaped to some other behavior, that's shaping. If you targeted the initial
behavior and then shaped it further, that's shaping.

I have never actually understood the distinction between the two terms.
I've never actually used &quot;Freeshaping&quot; to describe any training I've done.
I have used the term &quot;Captured&quot; to describe the reinforcement of found
behaviors offered spontaneously. But, even with the term &quot;Captured&quot;, I
think the correct terminology would be that the initial behavior was
&quot;Captured&quot; but subsequent unprompted offerings were &quot;Shaped&quot; to create the
final behavior.

Generally the term &quot;captured&quot; is used to describe behavior that happens in
its completed form and you reinforce it. Like, you are teaching your dog to
sit and you just wait for her to sit and click/treat. If you then wanted to
turn the sit into a stacked sit you could shape it.

I agree with you on this Kellie. It may be fun to create new terms for
variations on a theme but it makes discussion difficult. Much better to
have a small set of clearly defined terms on which to base discourse.

Thanks for pushing toward clear communication.

[] I appreciate your words, Eric.

I know that this may be irritating for some who are already using
alternative words, but I'll tell you what happened. Here I was with a BS in
behavior analysis, and almost through an MS in Behavior Analysis and I was
running into all sorts of confusing discussions online that were describing
clicker training as if it was it's own deal. 10 years ago people remembered
that it came from behavior analysis. Now people get antsy when you say
behavior analysis and want to separate themselves from it. Why? Because we
have to honor woo-woo science. Sorry, folks, but there you have it.

Today clicker training is often talked about like it's own stand-alone
pseudo-science, mixed up with a bunch of untested hypotheses that are taught
as if they are fact. We have dozens of gurus all teaching their own
versions of things because few of them are referring to the data that
started it all. Some are. I love that! Many are not. And that's where
things get fuzzy.

The reason this matters is that behavior analysis is about data. Clicker
training is a technology that came out of behavior analysis. It's being
taken over by anecdotes and redefinitions, and that's a real shame. It's a
shame because the new stuff that is coming up is far less effective than the
pure, simple, bare-bones science.

I know this is an up-hill battle since there are a lot of famous folks out
there and I'm one not-very-famous graduate student behavioral problem
solver. But I think that by speaking up, the other people who have the same
concerns and want to keep clicker training true to its roots WHILE IMPROVING
UPON IT but NOT DILUTING IT, we can do great things. We can make training
easier.

Good science is simple.

The four Goldiamond Constructional Approach Questions are the key:

Where are you now in terms of this behavior?
Where do you want to end up?

How will you get there?
How will you maintain the behavior once you get there?

How will you get there? It's often SHAPING. Shaping.

Good girl, you. You should hear me try to explain this to my students. Can
I use your posts (this one and the previous one) in class?


<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
On 1/26/06, Kellie &lt;the.kel ... @verizon.net&gt; wrote:

&gt; [] &gt; As I understand it, shaping means &quot;training with successive
&gt; approximations&quot;. If someone says that shaping means &quot;training with
&gt; successive approximations [] &gt; AND NO CLUES&quot;, to me it appears that they
&gt; have changed and narrowed the meaning of the term &quot;shaping&quot;.
&gt; Lindsay, the Clues part was *never* part of the definition of shaping
&gt; until dog trainers changed it in the past few years. That changes the
&gt; original meaning of the term. Saying &quot;no clues&quot; is not necessary because it
&gt; was never there to begin with. The term was originated in roughly 1943 by
&gt; B.F. Skinner.

&gt; [] If shaping is going to continue to mean &quot;training with successive
&gt; approximations&quot;, no matter how those approximations are elicited, then it
&gt; is reasonable
&gt; [] to have a different word that means shaping IN WHICH the method of
&gt; eliciting trials provides no clue to the dog about what specific variation
&gt; in the
&gt; [] behavior is requested. For me, &quot;freeshaping&quot; carries that extra
&gt; information.

&gt; How the behavior gets started is not part of the definition of shaping.
&gt; There is no qualifier for that. Shaping just means the process itself. No
&gt; matter how the behavior gets started... whether it was spontaneous or lured
&gt; or happened when the cat fell out of the tree, it doesn't matter. The
&gt; beginning of the behavior is not the shaping process. Shaping is the
&gt; differential reinforcement of successive approximations to a target
&gt; behavior-- period.

&gt; [] Perhaps you disagree that shaping has ever had the broad meaning
&gt; of &quot;training with successive approximations&quot;.

&gt; ????? Shaping ALWAYS has the meaning of training with successive
&gt; approximations. How would I disagree with that? That's exactly what it
&gt; means. It's the meanings that add qualifiers that I disagree with.

&gt; [] &gt; Perhaps you feel that anytime someone uses a target hand, for
&gt; example, to help the dog perform the next approximation correctly, they're
&gt; not shaping.
&gt; That is right, and it's not that I &quot;feel&quot; it, it's that the definition of
&gt; the term &quot;shaping&quot; says it. If you're guiding with a target stick that is
&gt; not shaping. That is &quot;guiding with a target stick&quot;.

&gt;&gt; In that case, what word would one use to mean &quot;training with successive
&gt; approximations, regardless of how each approximation is elicited&quot;?
&gt; You would use the term &quot;SHAPING&quot;. That is what shaping means.

&gt; [] &gt; Alternatively, perhaps you feel that the same word should carry both
&gt; the broader meaning and the narrower meaning.
&gt; It's not about what I *feel*, Lindsay. It's what a bunch of people
&gt; who figured this stuff out a long time ago decided to call it. My goal is
&gt; to remind us that we did not invent this stuff, and if we are constantly
&gt; complicating basic principles, we're going to spend all our time in a big
&gt; training quagmire. Simplify! Simplify!

&gt; If you start out shaping by using only what the animal offers, that's
&gt; shaping. (Dog trainers RE-named it freeshaping, but that wasn't necessary.
&gt; That was already what the word meant.)

&gt; If you start out guiding the animal with a target stick then move into
&gt; shaping, that's shaping where the initial behavior was gotten by guiding
&gt; with a target stick. It's still shaping.

&gt; The target lure is tacked on to the shaping procedure. It's NOT part of
&gt; the shaping. It's just a way to get started.

&gt; Here's an analogy. Say I want to drive to the store. I get in the car,
&gt; put the key in the ignition, turn it until I hear the engine turn over, put
&gt; it in gear and push the gas pedal. The car moves and I guide it by turning
&gt; the steering wheel while keeping my foot on the pedal, adjusting speed and
&gt; direction depending on what is on my path.

&gt; Is putting the key in the ignition and turning it called driving? What if
&gt; I turned the key in the ignition then put the car in gear then put the gear
&gt; back in park, turned off the key and got out. Would you say I had been
&gt; driving?

&gt; No, the only part of the process we would call driving is the part where
&gt; I'm pushing the gas pedal and the car is moving. If my husband called me on
&gt; my cell phone and I was turning the key in the ignition, I wouldn't tell him
&gt; I was driving, I would tell them I was getting ready to drive somewhere.

&gt; Targeting or luring or cuing to start a behavior is like turning the key
&gt; in the ignition and putting the car in gear. It can get the process
&gt; started, but the part called shaping is the part where you're differentially
&gt; reinforcing successive approximations to a target behavior. The shaping is
&gt; the DRIVING.

&gt; How you get the first behavior doesn't matter.

&gt; Just like we don't need a different name for driving that is done after we
&gt; turned the key in the ignition and driving that is done after the car is
&gt; hotwired, we don't need a different name for shaping that is started by
&gt; targeting and shaping that is started because the animal offered a
&gt; behavior.

Kellie is doing a fantastic job of explaining. I believe as we all begin to
understand what these terms are, that we use so freely, we'll be better able
to communicate with one another and our animals. This may not be the term
I'm guilty of, but oh my, am I guilty of using others incorrectly, which is
confusing to other people. Sometimes it's very hard for me to read some of
the posts because I'm constantly trying to translate a language I don't know
into something that I do have a definition for, ie: scientific terms.

&gt; Lindsay,
&gt; You bring up an interesting point.

&gt; I have used the term freeshaping myself from time to time as a fast and
&gt; easy way of expressing the shaping behavior ...to me this meant 'free of
&gt; cues' ; 'free of targeting'; 'free of luring' and 'free to innovate'.
&gt; However, it is not a term I use often or with much thought in the terms you
&gt; presented. I do however capture behaviors as a whole at times during a
&gt; shaping session. Like a yawn or scratch.....

&gt; My description of shaping (as I used it here) is with no verbal cues, no
&gt; body cues, you are strictly a marker and could not be in the room at all an
&gt; just observe from a camera an click as long as there was a way of delivering
&gt; the reward. (TnT, smile)

&gt; If I use a body or verbal signal of any kind I consider it a cue behavior.

&gt; If I use a tool such as a hand, target stick, postit note, sticker, jar
&gt; lid... etc... I view that a targeted behavior.

&gt; If I use a reward in hand guided process, or enticed behavior, I consider
&gt; it a lured behavior.

&gt; If the dog naturally does a behavior...yawn, wag, bark, (and even
&gt; sometimes sit, down) etc. and I click and reward I consider that a captured
&gt; behavior.

&gt; Maybe too simplistic, and maybe more of an issue to me if I was teaching a
&gt; class and wanted to clearly distinguish the explanation of a method to the
&gt; humans. I do find it a challenge when in this type of situation and express
&gt; clearly what method I am using to teach a behavior... or to thorough
&gt; understand how someone else taught a behavior.

&gt; Is there an &quot;official&quot; list of terminology somewhere in the annals?

If you can get successive approximations _with_ clues, and you can get
successive approximations _without_ clues, and both of those techniques are
called &quot;shaping&quot;, then what is your objection to a word which shows which
type of shaping you mean?

[] Because it's an extra word for one meaning. The thing that is different
is how the behavior starts, not the shaping process.

Shaping is the differential reinforcement of successive approximations to a
target behavior-- period.
Then what is wrong with a word that narrows how each approximation is
elicited?

[] Because it's an extra word for one meaning. Simplify, simplify.

If there is nothing in the word &quot;approximation&quot; that says how the
approximation is elicited as you state, then why do you say that using a
target stick to elicit an approximation is _not_ shaping?

Because using a target stick is targeting. If you're targeting every single
behavior along the way, you're not really shaping behavior. You're
targeting. You're saying, &quot;Do this. Now do this.&quot; Shaping lets the animal
do the approximations and you reinforce them as they come. If you use a
target stick ONLY to get things started but THEN you start shaping
approximations, then you're shaping.

There is no contradiction between &quot;approximation&quot; and &quot;guiding with a target
stick.&quot; They are not mutually exclusive.
[] They also have completely different meanings. They are apples and
oranges.

But it is obvious to me that different judges interpret the law
differently.
[] If one judge relies on the Constitution for his interpretations and
another on The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling, the interpretations are going
to be different. This list relies on behavior analytic history for its
interpretations. Why? Because that's where clicker training came from. But
also because I own this list now and I have decided that this is the kind of
list that is needed. It is the area that is missing in modern clicker
training.

Saying that one interpretation is truly correct, and everyone else is
rewriting the law, does not make it so.

As I said when I revived this list a few days ago, we will keep true to the
behavior analytic roots of clicker training on this list. If that doesn't
work for you, I can help you unsubscribe. I hope that won't happen, though,
because you have a lot to offer.

Conversation One:
&quot;How did you get the car going?&quot;
&quot;I started the engine.&quot;
&quot;Did you use a key, or did you hotwire?&quot;
&quot;The word 'hotwire' has no value. It was just started.&quot;

First let me wink at the sarcasm. ;-)

Lindsay, I didn't say that hotwire has no value. It started the car!
That's cool! But hotwiring the car isn't driving. And turning the key
isn't driving. Driving is driving. Likewise I didn't say that targeting
has no value. Targeting started the behavior! That's cool! But targeting
isn't shaping. Shaping is shaping.

And freeshaping means the exact same thing as shaping. So it's just a
superfluous word. What has happened is that someone somewhere forgot the
real meaning of &quot;shaping&quot; and came up with a new word to take its place,
which just complicates matters --- as demonstrated by this thread.

Shaping is shaping. Targeting is targeting. They can be used in tandem.
They aren't the same thing.

Now... please make your final point, and let's move on.

I really enjoyed Dr. Grandin's book, but I don't necessarily agree that
animals are more like people with autism than they are like other kinds of
people. Yet many of her points were very useful... things like &quot;Get down on
the ground and look at things from the animal's perspective&quot; can answer a
lot of questions you might otherwise spend a lot of time guessing about.
But you don't have to be autistic to do that. Just getting on the ground
and looking about will show you what the animal's seeing so you can adjust
the environment.

How many of us would crawl through the tunnel to see if there's some reason
Fifi might be freaking out about it? How many of us have walked the teeter
to see what the dog might be experiencing?

savant skills which allow migrating birds to remember routes spanning
halfway across the globe and squirrels to recollect where they have hidden
hundreds of nuts - or Rainman to memorise all the names and addresses in the
phonebook. And she believes that, like animals, people with Autism think

I think what's going on is that I missed something. Tell me.

When you are using the term 'shaping' are you targeting each approximation
toward the target behavior throughout the procedure? Or most of them?

If so, that's not shaping at all. That's targeting.

It seems to get down to the same thing. The REAL meaning of shaping is what
people today are renaming FREEshaping.

Read the paragraphs by Skinner and see what HE called shaping. Better yet,
go to the Journal of Experimental Analysis of Behavior (JEAB) website and
read the fascinating article by Gail Peterson about the first shaping
experiments. It's not as easy to use as it used to be, but most articles
are FREE, so find the search engine on the site and click in Peterson.
You'll find an article called A Day Of Great Illumination.

Read it! Very good stuff! This link might get you there:

nal=Both&amp;Sort=Year&gt;&amp;ps=25&amp;Journal=Both&amp;Sort=Year

Now, I have to bow out and get some work done. This list is going to be too
much fun... I'm going to have to be very disciplined!

[] &gt; As I understand it, shaping means &quot;training with successive
approximations&quot;. If someone says that shaping means &quot;training with
successive approximations [] &gt; AND NO CLUES&quot;, to me it appears that they
have changed and narrowed the meaning of the term &quot;shaping&quot;.

Lindsay, the Clues part was *never* part of the definition of shaping until
dog trainers changed it in the past few years. That changes the original
meaning of the term. Saying &quot;no clues&quot; is not necessary because it was
never there to begin with. The term was originated in roughly 1943 by B.F.
Skinner.

I have only a second. I should point out that &quot;shaping&quot; was not the word people used at first. Skinner preferred differentiation, but that soon went by the boards, and shaping won out (try saying differentiation fast 10 times). What was funny was many years later, Keller Breland's pet &quot;bridging stimulus&quot; got shrunk down to &quot;bridge&quot; (with my help) and used for just about everything but the kitchen sink, and all over his protestations (just like Skinner).

Like Skinner, Keller got over it.

It is only when you start raising your criteria

"/> Well, I haven't caught up with all the posts, but this post, with all
the historical quotes, clarified things for me nicely. Thanks! From
now on, I will try to transition to using the term &quot;shaping&quot; to mean
what I have been calling &quot;freeshaping&quot;.

Apparently, the classical definition of shaping, and the one which
you, Kellie, would like us to use is: &quot;differential reinforcement of
successive approximations of behavior that is elicited without clues
as to what behavior is desired&quot;.

I have no problem with using that definition of shaping. I do have a
problem with saying that that definition is identical to:
&quot;differential reinforcement of successive approximations of behavior&quot;.

Under that second definition, which I believe is commonly given as a
definition of shaping, using a target stick to elicit the
approximations would qualify as shaping. In fact, using any method
of eliciting the approximations would qualify as shaping.

Now, I have one more question of terminology. Since &quot;shaping&quot; means
&quot;training using successive approximations without clues&quot;, is there
some term that means the general concept of simply &quot;training using
successive approximations&quot;? I think both techniques are important in
dog training, and it would be nice if they each had its own word.
Think how difficult things would be if we had the words &quot;auto&quot;,
&quot;truck&quot;, &quot;SUV&quot;, and so forth, but no general word &quot;vehicle&quot;.

To illustrate, let's say the word was &quot;incrementalizing&quot; (which I
just made up for the purposes of illustration):

Stranger (in dog park): &quot;You're really lucky to have such a smart dog.&quot;

Me: &quot;Thanks. She'd a great dog.&quot;

Stranger: &quot;Was she born knowing all that stuff?&quot;

Me (laughing): &quot;Well, no, we train together.&quot;

Stranger: &quot;Really? I'd love to train my dog. How do you do it?&quot;

Me: &quot;Well, there are several methods. Sometimes Lumi just happens to
do a behavior, and I reinforce it. That's called 'capturing'.&quot;

Stranger: &quot;Yeah, but what about those complex behaviors that no dog
would ever just happen to do?&quot;

Me: &quot;Oh, we train things like that by means of incrementalizing.
First we get a behavior that is on the way to the goal behavior, and
we reinforce that, and after a few reps of that, we use various ways
of eliciting variations so that we can reinforce the variations we
want. In that way, we gradually incrementalize the behavior.&quot;

Stranger: &quot;Interesting. But how do you get that first behavior and
those variations?&quot;

Me: &quot;Good question. The art of getting a behavior is one of the most
interesting parts of dog training to me. One method is called
shaping. In that case, you don't give the dog any clue what you
want, but you reinforce behaviors that are going the right way.
Several other methods for getting the behavior during
incrementalizing also exist: luring, targeting, modeling, prompting
with a previously trained cue, and so forth.&quot;

Stranger: &quot;That's amazing. I always wondered how people train
animals to do things that don't occur in nature. So the secret is
incrementalizing, eh?

Anyway, thanks again for all the quotes and taking the time to help
me see your viewpoint.

I usually don't like to talk about other folks, but Morgan and I talk from time to time, and I will be spending time with him soon (we sometimes even joke about the &quot;old&quot; use of words). I don't think he would mind my saying the following:
If you were to talk with Morgan today, I think you would find that he would write his book a bit differently. Many of his training procedures in his book were OK, but his explanations were &quot;clicker&quot; based, not from BA. Today he knows there is a difference, and he speaks and writes more precisely and with greater clarity.

will procede in the same way as if it started any other way. What it will
NOT have is a target or cue for each approximation. That's not shaping if
you drag it out of the animal. It can be useful to do that. But it's not
shaping. If it's all prompted you're not shaping. You can DO it that way
if it works for you, but it's not shaping.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Under that second definition, which I believe is commonly given as a

"/> definition of shaping, using a target stick to elicit the approximations
would qualify as shaping.

No, using the target stick to evoke the approximations all the way through
means it's not shaping. Shaping is when the animal does the behaving and
you reinforce it. If you're telling him what to do each step of the way
with a target stick, you're not shaping.

&gt;In fact, using any method of eliciting the approximations would qualify as
shaping.

No... I could get &quot;approximations&quot; by physically putting my dog's feet where
I wanted them to go. That would NOT be shaping. I could show my dog where
to go by tapping it with a target stick. That would NOT be shaping. If I
set up the environment and he offers me behaviors from which I can select
closer and closer approximations to the target behavior I've selected THAT
is shaping.

I see now that I previously thought you were just targeting the initial
behaviors to get the animal started on the right track. That is shaping
with targeting tacked onto the front. If you're targeting all the
approximations, that's not shaping at all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Now, I have one more question of terminology. Since &quot;shaping&quot; means

"/>&quot;training using successive approximations without clues&quot;, is there some term
that means the &gt;general concept of simply &quot;training using successive
approximations&quot;?

I think we need to clarify what a successive approximation is. It's not a
successive approximation if you've told the animal where to go and what to
do when he gets there. It is not a successive approximation if you tap the
floor and the dog goes to where you're tapping, then you tap it a little
farther along and he goes to the new place you're tapping. That's just
following a target stick. If he doesn't offer the approximation we don't
call it a successive approximation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I think both techniques are important in dog training, and it would be nice

"/> if they each had its own word.

I'm pretty sure they DO have a separate word. What you were calling
&quot;shaping&quot; is really &quot;targeting&quot; and what you were calling &quot;freeshaping&quot; is
really &quot;shaping&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Stranger: &quot;Interesting. But how do you get that first behavior and those

"/> variations?&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Me: &quot;Good question. The art of getting a behavior is one of the most

"/> interesting parts of dog training to me. One method is called shaping. In
that case, you don't &gt;give the dog any clue what you want, but you
reinforce behaviors that are going the right way. Several other methods for
getting the behavior during &gt;incrementalizing also
exist: luring, targeting, modeling, prompting with a previously trained cue,
and so forth.&quot;

That sounds right on target to me!

I didn't realize that. I thought an approximation would be any
behavior that was approximating the goal behavior, regardless of how
it was obtained. I find it a bit confusing that the word
&quot;approximation&quot; would take on a narrower meaning than &quot;something that
approximates&quot;.

Or maybe you're saying that it's the word &quot;successive&quot; that has taken
on a special meaning in behavioral science. To me, &quot;successive&quot;
means &quot;one thing following another&quot;. But maybe behavioral scientists
use the word &quot;successive&quot; in a more specialized way.

Anyway, given that &quot;successive approximation&quot; has the meaning of
&quot;_offered_ successive approximation&quot; to everyone in this field, I
agree that adding &quot;no clues&quot; to the definition of shaping is redundant.

I would say that successive approximation means approximations that follow

given the answers in advance.

"/> Well, I Googled this for the last half hour. I can't find any

My computer dictionary says that &quot;approximation&quot; means something
&quot;close to the actual, but not completely accurate or exact&quot;. Do you
know of a reference that explains the more limited BA definition?
I'm particularly interested in understanding the relationship of how
the behavior is elicited to the concept of an approximation.

By the way, I also Googled for &quot;shaping&quot; in combination with the
phase &quot;target stick&quot; and got hundreds of hits. Many did not consider
the two concepts to be incompatible. A small sampling:

&quot;The purpose of the target is to have the bears touch the target
(hand or stick) with their nose and follow the target to wherever it
moves. This is a useful tool when shaping other behaviors such as
chest and shoulder/leg presentation (changing the topography of the
animal).&quot; -- Sharon Holden et all, Polar Bear Shores

&quot;Shaping is the cornerstone of clicker training – you can use either
offered or luring to shape the end result..&quot; -- &quot;The Four
Essentials&quot;, Volsung Rottweilers.

&quot;There are two basic types of shaping; prompted shaping and free
shaping. Prompted shaping is when you lure or induce (e.g. with a
target) your dog to perform an action and then click and reward him
for completing it. Free shaping on the other hand is waiting for your
dog to perform a desired action of his own free will and then
clicking/rewarding him.&quot; -- seefido.com

&quot;Directed Shaping This generally involves luring or targeting to help
get the behaviour and then reinforcing it.&quot; -- Greg Barker

Kellie, I don't understand your criteria for stating that all these
people, and many others, are using a common English word
incorrectly. Isn't the meaning of a word defined by usage? If a
large percentage of clicker trainers believe that shaping can be done
with targeting, doesn't that mean that, at least in the community of
clicker trainers (this list is called &quot;CLICK-L&quot;) we should consider
that usage?

Of course, it's your list and your decision. I'm sorry to be
annoying you, and no doubt others. I won't post again on the
definition of &quot;shaping&quot; unless you specifically ask me to.

Hear, hear Kellie! I agree with you 100%

Unfortunately, time (that is a lack of it) keeps me from answering the posts
on the list and even from reading, let alone come up with any good topics.
And there is my excuse for this late reply too ;-p

But I am (still) in an will try to keep up a bit ;-)

I like what you wrote about the original intention of CLICK-L list and the
subjects you're proposing to keep &quot;talking&quot; about are the very ones I am
interested in and like to learn more about, so let's all go for it!!!

&gt;Subject: [CLICK-L] Click-L
&gt;Date: Mon, 23 Jan 2006 22:10:52 -0800

&gt;Hey, Everyone,

&gt;Bob Bailey and I discussed the Click-L list a bit over the weekend and
&gt;remembered the days when it was &quot;THE&quot; list for clicker training on the
&gt;Internet. Karen Pryor started it with Kathleen Weaver as moderator.
&gt;(Kathleen, if you're there and I'm telling it incorrectly, please pipe
&gt;up!)

&gt;A while back, as most of you recall, Kathleen turned the list over to
&gt;Cindi Lashinsky, who invited me to join her as moderator. At the
&gt;moment I am the sole moderator of the Click-L list. During the
&gt;transfer of moderator-ship the list was moved a couple of times,
&gt;searching for a suitable server, and finally settled in at Google
&gt;Groups.

&gt;Once the move took place things got pretty quiet around good old
&gt;Click-L, but I think it's time to breathe new life into it, and I'll
&gt;tell you why. The original Click-L was about clicker training from a
&gt;behavior analytic perspective. Vigorous debate occured over technique,
&gt;theory and practice, but it stayed behavior analytic in nature.
&gt;Operant conditioning! Respondent conditioning! Intermittent
&gt;schedules! Reinforcer effectiveness! Oh my!

&gt;I would like to engage in that kind of debate and discussion again...
&gt;controlled with moderation to ensure that nastiness is quelled while
&gt;the free flow of ideas is encouraged. I'd like to have a list where
&gt;the fact that Clicker Training is a technology developed in the science
&gt;of behavior analysis is front and center.

&gt;There are a lot of fine lists online today, and they each have a
&gt;different focus. The focus of this list would be to keep the science
&gt;of behavior analysis in clicker training, to keep clicker training true
&gt;to its roots, and grounded in good science. I'm honestly a bit
&gt;concerned about clicker training getting &quot;soft&quot;, or diluted. I'd like
&gt;Click-L to be the place to come to get the skinny on operant
&gt;conditioning in animal training. And to have a good, energetic
&gt;discussion!

&gt;What do you think? Are you in?

It is my hope that this list guides us into the correct usage of BA terms.
As Kellie mentioned numerous times, just because animal trainers us a term
in an incorrect way doesn't change the correct definition of that term.
Just because it comes up in Google doesn't mean that term is being defined
in the way it is in BA. Kellie gave a site for a BA dictionary yesterday,
if you want to know a dictionary go there for that definition.

Often when I'm trying to explain something to another I'll use incorrect
terms, only to have to correct the meaning when the terms in used for
another behavior.

Or someone will say something to me using a term in the incorrect way and
I'll have to ask question after question to understand what they are trying
to tell me.

The correct usage of terms allows everyone to communicate more efficiently.

Just the term punishment blew me away as an example, I fought the definition
for months - had a very difficult time understanding what was being
said/explained or I read. Once my head accepted the term I was able to
begin to &quot;get it&quot;.

Just think if we know and use the language of BA, we can discuss things with
anyone else who knows and uses the language/Jargon, without having to go
into hours of explanations of what each person means.

This is NOT to say I know much, I don't, but what I learn I want to learn
correctly. I want to be able to follow a discussion of say Bob and Kellie
without needing to ask what each term means. I've a long ways to go to get
there, there are a few basic ones that I know, many many others that I need
a BA dictionary to understand.

There are just so many words we use in everyday language that have a
different scientific meaning.

I do so agree. I am a perfectionnist and would love to have the right
terminology at the right moment and be understood by all around! However,
the hick I have with that is a very poor memory and I am often needing to
refer to a list..... that I have built up, updated and complete and
printed out. It lays on my desk for immediate use.

That is, the abbreviations, the words meant by the abbreviations, and then a
description in phrases of what the meaning implies, with an easy to seize
example for me. This has greatly helped me and stopped me - sometimes -
swearing about my poor memory!

Try looking up successive approximation.

Keep in mind that dog trainers and zoo trainers don't always use the terms
correctly, so consider that when you're looking up the terms. Look at the
behavior analytic literature, in particular Skinner's work.

&quot;Shaping is the cornerstone of clicker training - you can use either offered
or luring to shape the end result..&quot; -- &quot;The Four Essentials&quot;, Volsung
Rottweilers.

Shaping IS the cornerstone of clicker training. But the above is why I'm
being such a stickler about this. If you lure every behavior in the
training session, you're not shaping. Shaping is about letting the animal
produce behavior and you choose the ones you like and reinforce them.

&quot;There are two basic types of shaping; prompted shaping and free shaping.
Prompted shaping is when you lure or induce (e.g. with a target) your dog to
perform an action and then click and reward him for completing it. Free
shaping on the other hand is waiting for your dog to perform a desired
action of his own free will and then clicking/rewarding him.&quot; -- seefido.com

[] Incorrect. They've made up yet ANOTHER term... prompted shaping. When
you lure your animal to perform an action then click and reinforce, that's
LURING, not shaping.

&quot;Directed Shaping This generally involves luring or targeting to help get
the behaviour and then reinforcing it.&quot; -- Greg Barker

[] Yet ANOTHER made-up term... directed shaping. It's still luring or
targeting, not shaping.

Kellie, I don't understand your criteria for stating that all these people,
and many others, are using a common English word incorrectly.

[] Because they're making up new terms for things that are already defined
in the behavior analytic literature. Clicker training, like it or not, came
from behavior analysis. It works when you stay true to the behavior
analytic principles. Making up a bunch of extra words for the same stuff
muddies the waters and my goal is to help trainers see that it all works
much better when we keep it SIMPLE.

Isn't the meaning of a word defined by usage? If a large percentage of
clicker trainers believe that shaping can be done with targeting, doesn't
that mean that, at least in the community of clicker trainers (this list is
called &quot;CLICK-L&quot;) we should consider that usage?

[] I'll repeat. This is going to be a purist list, Lindsay. If you want a
lot of fuzzy words made up by every person who ever taught clicker training,
there are other lists for that. This list is about the real deal.

H[] ere's a good, but technical definition:

Gradually modifying some property of responding (often but not necessarily
topography) by differentially reinforcing successive approximations to a
target operant class. Shaping is used to produce responses that, because of
low operant levels and/or complexity, might not otherwise be emitted or
might be emitted only after a considerable time. The variability of
responses after one response has been reinforced usually provides an
opportunity to reinforce a response that still more closely approximates the
criteria that define the target operant class. Shaping is therefore a
variety of operant selection.

Website C 1999 The University of South Florida

In shaping you select from offered behaviors. You don't lure. You don't
target. Luring and targeting are fine in certain situations. But they
aren't shaping. Shaping is what you're calling freeshaping. But the word
freeshaping is superfluous. Shaping is shaping.

Good point, Perrti. At least when talking with cranky people like me, one
is always well-advised to provide a clear definition of a term.

&quot;Directed Shaping This generally involves luring or targeting to help get the behaviour and then reinforcing it.&quot; -- Greg Barker
End of &lt;snip&gt;

I am a bit lost as to who said what, &quot;Directed shaping&quot; is used by me and
in turn Greg also an Australian and a dear friend uses it, I heard this term
at the first Legacy Chicken camp I went to with Bob Bailey and Morgan
Spector, I think six years ago.

My notes:

*Free Operant: It means presenting the dog with a set of conditions, say
your aim is for your dog to chase its tail, then you reinforce the
behaviour that you want (a glance towards the hindquarters sort of thing).

What you are doing is allowing the dog to *choose* a responsive behaviour
and reinforce the behaviour you want. The behaviours emerge through the
process of reinforcement with no or little direction from the trainer. A
bit hard for dogs that don't offer anything I feel.

Directed Operant: The trainer gives the dog more information as to what we
want and we mainly use targeting for this so we can direct the dog onto
doing other things. Hand targeting is directed operant.*

Morgan wrote about the same topic in Off Lead May/June 2000 and when he
visited Australia two years ago it was in his notes.

I spoke to Morgan about free shaping vs. Shaping last September, I won't
quote him verbatim although he gave me permission to send it into my forum
which is where Greg got it from.

I asked Morgan if &quot;free operant&quot; is also part of &quot;'free operant&quot; and he
replied &quot;Yes&quot;. He went on to describe that the term &quot;free&quot; in this context
simply means that the trainer is allowing behaviour to emerge without any
particular direction being given by the trainer.

He said that &quot;free operant&quot; may be taken to refer to the overall method or
theory behind it.

Morgan said that &quot;free shaping&quot; is referring to the actual physical
training process.

Soooooooo, if you are free shaping then you are using &quot;Free Operant&quot;, If you
are luring or targeting then you are using &quot;Directed Operant&quot;. Clear as mud.
Interesting though isn't it!

Thanks for this, Pat! I&quot;m going to read it over again this evening after a
bunch of meetings I'm heading off to now.

I think OPERANT would be another good term to discuss. A lot of people say
&quot;My dog is operant&quot;. That's not an appropriate use of the term... if anyone
is interested we can dig into that one next.

are luring or targeting then you are using &quot;Directed Operant&quot;. Clear as mud.

Let's do that. I know Sue eh? described my Papillon as being very Operant,
I knew what she meant. Now I want to know what BA has to say.

Also Morgan is now saying he used some terms incorrectly, so finding out
Pat's information is be a good thing. And I don't even care for that woman
who says &quot;it's a good thing&quot;.

Oh I love that Kellie, Shaping is shaping, I do have a problem with &quot;free
shaping&quot;. To me that is a man made term and a lot of folk who say they are
free shaping are haphazard shaping, individuals who have no skill at
systematic shaping often reinforce behaviour without setting specific
goals, without paying careful attention to which behaviour they are
reinforcing, and without using orderly steps of successive approximation.

What do you think?

Hi group,
I'm new to the list, so here's a little about us.

I discovered Positive Reinforcement training and Agility in 2002 while searching for a Papillon puppy to replace a Pap and Bichon that had recently died. I got Sizzle at 5.5 mos in the fall of 2002. We're on an incredible journey together.

I read everything I can get my hands on about this magic method, Along the way, I've participated in Melissa Alexander's Clicker Solutions, Debbie Davis' Clicker Paps, and Pat Miller's Peaceable Paws lists as well as several others about Paps or agility. I've attended many seminars on Positive Reinforcement training, Dog Behavior, and Agility.

Sizzle is my first dog trained from the beginning using these principals of learning. I have an older Pap (Sam, 10 yr spayed female) that's a crossover dog and she's really happy about it. She's really tiny, fearful and just hated the Down position and the old fashioned methods of training it. She hated it so much I finally just stopped training. Then I discovered this new approach, started Clicker Training him, and she started begging to participate. She's a totally different dog.

On the current topic of &quot;free shaping&quot;, as I know it, shaping is capturing the natural behavior, marking it and reinforcing it, which causes the animal to do more of it. Luring is luring. The dog learns very little except to go to or follow the lure. Luring can be useful under certain circumstances, but the lure must be faded very quickly so the dog is actually learning the behavior, not just to follow or go to the lure.

I'm really looking forward to participating in the list. This is one of my favorite topics.

Yes, I did (and I do in beginning classes) use &quot;directed&quot; and &quot;free&quot; shaping. In later classes, when I had more time, I got rid of such terms and discussed shaping as shaping. I found I could win only so many battles and the shaping and free shaping terms were so ingrained in the students that I made only slight change in early classes.

I used the terms as a temporary device. I didn't like them then, and I don't like them now, but I live with it. At least, I live with it until I have the chance to change it. Frankly, it doesn't bother me much since most behaviors in my class are best started with luring, targeting, or other such prompts.

There are opportunities for pure shaping, and testing the students understanding of BA principles, and their skill at applying them. I don't make an issue of shaping, and most students don't even realize that they have transitioned from prompting to shaping, and that they are usually getting far more &quot;shaped&quot; behavior than ever before. They are getting more because they finally see the value of paying attention to timing, criteria, and rate of reinforcement.

For those of you who have taken the chicken workshops, just think of the successive approximations to get the chicken's head to go lower and lower until the chicken begin to peck at the table. The chicken finally ends up pecking at a piece of paper, but that piece of paper doesn't mean anything at first. Once the chicken's pecks at the piece of paper are reinforced, the piece of paper becomes a target, and it is a whole new ball game.

So, I plead guilty to limited and purposeful &quot;misuse&quot; of terminology, but I also claim &quot;self defense.&quot; I am sure Kellie knows, as I do, that she cannot change the entire world; but, as List Mistress, she can change this Click-L world. Viva Kellie, and good luck. I will also say that even when I uttered the misinformation, I slept well at night. I have learned to work in the &quot;real world.&quot; I may lose some battles, but I am still trying to win the war. &lt;smile&gt;.

And, my congratulations to Pat for her excellent notes and recall.

&quot;Directed Shaping This generally involves luring or targeting to help get the behaviour and then reinforcing it.&quot; -- Greg Barker
End of &lt;snip&gt;

I am a bit lost as to who said what, &quot;Directed shaping&quot; is used by me and
in turn Greg also an Australian and a dear friend uses it, I heard this term
at the first Legacy Chicken camp I went to with Bob Bailey and Morgan
Spector, I think six years ago.

My notes:

*Free Operant: It means presenting the dog with a set of conditions, say
your aim is for your dog to chase its tail, then you reinforce the
behaviour that you want (a glance towards the hindquarters sort of thing).

What you are doing is allowing the dog to *choose* a responsive behaviour
and reinforce the behaviour you want. The behaviours emerge through the
process of reinforcement with no or little direction from the trainer. A
bit hard for dogs that don't offer anything I feel.

Directed Operant: The trainer gives the dog more information as to what we
want and we mainly use targeting for this so we can direct the dog onto
doing other things. Hand targeting is directed operant.*

Morgan wrote about the same topic in Off Lead May/June 2000 and when he
visited Australia two years ago it was in his notes.

I spoke to Morgan about free shaping vs. Shaping last September, I won't
quote him verbatim although he gave me permission to send it into my forum
which is where Greg got it from.

I asked Morgan if &quot;free operant&quot; is also part of &quot;'free operant&quot; and he
replied &quot;Yes&quot;. He went on to describe that the term &quot;free&quot; in this context
simply means that the trainer is allowing behaviour to emerge without any
particular direction being given by the trainer.

He said that &quot;free operant&quot; may be taken to refer to the overall method or
theory behind it.

Morgan said that &quot;free shaping&quot; is referring to the actual physical
training process.

Soooooooo, if you are free shaping then you are using &quot;Free Operant&quot;, If you
are luring or targeting then you are using &quot;Directed Operant&quot;. Clear as mud.
Interesting though isn't it!

[] bit hard for dogs that don't offer anything I feel.

There is a trick to getting behaviors from animals that don't offer a whole
lot of behaviors. Make your approximations smaller. When I started with my
Greyhound she gave me little or nothing. I clicked a movement of her
eyebrow. I clicked a twitch of her ear. A change in position.

It's always about sizing the approximations to fit what you're getting from
the animal.

Okay.

The term &quot;operant behavior&quot; refers to behavior that operates on the
environment to get some consequence.

For example, say you have this dresser and for years you've pulled on the
top knob and the drawer opened revealing your socks. Pulling the knob is a
behavior. The drawer opening is a consequence. Pulling the knob operates
on the environment to make the drawer open. Pulling the knob is operant
behavior.

A behavior that happens because it has a history of reinforcement is called
an operant. The first time you pull the dresser knob pulling is not yet an
operant. But after you've had a chance to get the consequence of the drawer
opening, it is known as operant behavior.

When we use the term &quot;operant&quot;, we're referring to the function of a
behavior, NOT the individual doing the behaving. So, YOU are not operant
because you pull the knob on your dresser drawer. Your pulling behavior is
operant. Your dog is not operant because he responds well to the clicker.
His BEHAVIOR is operant.

Make sense?

Here's a dandy definition:

A unit of behavior defined by a contingency of reinforcement. Pecking a key
is an operant if instances are reinforced in a given situation. A class of
responses, all members of which are equally effective in achieving
reinforcement under a given set of conditions.

There are a bunch of very complicated definitions on the UF site, but you
can usually find one that gets down to business.

Thank you, that is pretty much the way I have thought of Operant.

Now, how about a definition for what wa being said about Boodles, Papillon.
He was referred to as being very Operant. What is the correct term for
that? Of this, I have no idea, I really want to know.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What do you think?

"/> I think you're onto something valuable. It's one of the reasons having a
jumble of words is a problem. People use the terms in all sorts of
different ways.

I'll admit (and you will all collectively say, DUH!) that words are
important to me. I don't claim that I have the corner on the market of
understanding the terms, and some of you may well call me on something and
make me eat crow. (Hey... It won't be the first time!) If/when that happens,
it may embarrass me or it may smart for a few minutes, but it will be good
because I really, really want to use the words correctly. (I hope you'll be
kind!)

Because we already have a glossary of usages for the terms based in
empirical science, in my opinion, we are opening ourselves up to a muddier
science (IOW, a BAD science) if we start redefining and changing the
meanings of things and adding words for stuff that already has a label with
a decided meaning. The more we take clicker training away from the science,
the less effective it's going to become. We have a nifty technology. But
it wasn't created by dog trainers or college students. It was developed out
of a bunch of natural phenomena created by Mother Nature and it was observed
initially by some scientists in the 1930s and 40s. It is still under
development, which is a GOOD thing, but to go back and reinvent the wheel
every time a new dog training school opens or a new book on dog training is
published is to knock the wheel out of alignment and ultimately ruin your
tires! (Have you noticed I've been heavy on the car analogies this week?)

I have been a freelance writer for over 15 years and a lover of words since
I was a wee child. (More than 15 years ago. Cough, cough.) I love them
because they convey information with the potential for clarity. When we can
communicate clearly, we can build communities.

If we're all language purists and only add new terms when we discover
something that no one else knew before, then we don't have to spend the
first 10 minutes of every conversation defining terms. Or worse, thinking
we're talking about the same thing when we are really not.

When I'm face-to-face with someone having a conversation and they tell me
their dog is operant or they freeshaped something, I just smile and ask
enough questions to make sure I know what they're talking about. Rarely
does the conversation ever get to the point we have to really nitpick the
terms. If it does I'll say something like, &quot;Skinner used this term this
way, so that's how I use it...&quot; That's usually cool with whomever I'm
talking with.

Here on Click-L I can push it a little farther.

I teach a college undergrad course, and soon will be teaching an online ABA
course for dog trainers through Cynology college.... and there is a local
ABA program for animal trainers in the works, which I won't unveil just yet,
but it will hopefully be rolled out in 2007. So, you can see why I'm
nitpicky about being true to the science. I hope!

Just to be clear, I do not think academia is more valuable than real-life
experience. But I do think they play different roles. Academia figures out
the nuts and bolts. Real life experience puts them to good use and learns
to make the nuts and bolts work in ways that help people and animals out in
the world. Often their roles overlap. When academics take what they've
learned and jealously protect it in ivory towers (as some do) it doesn't
help anybody. When practitioners in the real world take bits and pieces of
the academics and mix and match, discard and shuffle, it jumbles the very
science that informs the practice, and the practice falls apart.

The way I think we all benefit the most is for academia to build a
foundation, and practitioners to put it to use to build a useful building.
(Damn me and my metaphors!) Academia isn't enough. Practice isn't enough.

&gt; because you pull the knob on your dresser drawer. Your pulling behavior is
&gt; operant. Your dog is not operant because he responds well to the clicker.
&gt; His BEHAVIOR is operant.

&gt; Make sense?

&gt; Here's a dandy definition:

&gt; *A unit of behavior defined by a contingency of reinforcement. Pecking a
&gt; key is an operant if instances are reinforced in a given situation. A class
&gt; of responses, all members of which are equally effective in achieving
&gt; reinforcement under a given set of conditions.*

&gt; There are a bunch of very complicated definitions on the UF site, but you
&gt; can usually find one that gets down to business.

[] &gt; Now, how about a definition for what wa being said about Boodles,
Papillon. He was referred to as being very Operant. What is the correct
term for that? [] &gt; Of this, I have no idea, I really want to know.

Boodles is a dog that understands that the clicker is a marker for
reinforcable behavior.

I often say that such a dog is clicker savvy... which just means he knows
what the clicker means.

[] &gt; Okay, I'll bite. So how do I describe my dog's behavior which is that
after the &quot;game&quot; starts, he'll offer behaviors trying to find the one that
will get him a [] &gt; click/reward. We've played 101 things to do with a box
many times and he'll just start trying different things. I've described him
as operant which is [] &gt; apparently wrong. Is there a word which will
describe this offering of behaviors?

Not to my knowledge. I call it &quot;clicker savvy&quot;. Basically, he just knows
that if the first thing he tried doesn't work something else is likely to.

Now, if we need to create a new word, this would be a time to do that!

The explanation is fine. There is one aspect of the UF site definition that Marian and I had a bit of a problem with, and that was the &quot;equally effective&quot; part. This smacks of the old equipotential stuff of the 40s through most of the 60s that helped to get the Skinnerians in hot water in the first place. I know what they mean, that is, they all result in reinforcement under a given set of conditions (essentially, can be maintained or strengthened by the consequences). We suggested early on that the term &quot;equally&quot; be omitted, but did not pursue the issue. This is not a major issue, and I don't wish to bore people. There are practical and theoretical implications, but it is likely that few would be concerned.

Strangely, it is because I have a slight problem with the formal accepted definition that I bring up the issue here. We've had a discussion about the meaning of words. Intelligent people can agree to disagree. The problem occurs when the chasm of disagreement is so big that terminology becomes a barrier to rather than a facilitator of communication. In this instance I understand the accepted definition, and I accept 95 percent of it. The fact that I know how and why I differ slightly allows me to follow what is said by behavior analysts, and to agree with most of what they say, and, in my opinion, allows me to use the animal training technology a bit better than the behavior analysts. It also points out why I probably am not the behavior analysts' &quot;poster-child.&quot;

Subject: [CLICK-L] Operant

[] .... described my Papillon as being very Operant, I knew what she meant. Now I want to know what BA has to say.

Okay.

The term &quot;operant behavior&quot; refers to behavior that operates on the environment to get some consequence.

For example, say you have this dresser and for years you've pulled on the top knob and the drawer opened revealing your socks. Pulling the knob is a behavior. The drawer opening is a consequence. Pulling the knob operates on the environment to make the drawer open. Pulling the knob is operant behavior.

A behavior that happens because it has a history of reinforcement is called an operant. The first time you pull the dresser knob pulling is not yet an operant. But after you've had a chance to get the consequence of the drawer opening, it is known as operant behavior.

When we use the term &quot;operant&quot;, we're referring to the function of a behavior, NOT the individual doing the behaving. So, YOU are not operant because you pull the knob on your dresser drawer. Your pulling behavior is operant. Your dog is not operant because he responds well to the clicker. His BEHAVIOR is operant.

Make sense?

Here's a dandy definition: A unit of behavior defined by a contingency of reinforcement. Pecking a key is an operant if instances are reinforced in a given situation. A class of responses, all members of which are equally effective in achieving reinforcement under a given set of conditions.

The creation or coining of new words or terms often depends on the roots or origins of the idea being described. e.g. the Brelands coining the term &quot;bridging stimulus,&quot; while attempting to describe the temporal relationships between behavior, the secondary reinforcer and the primary reinforcer (describing the time-bridge between a discriminative stimulus and the primary reinforcement).

To kick of the search for a new word, does anyone know of a word or term that has already been used?

Kellie, what do you think may be a relationship between &quot;clicker savvy&quot; and &quot;establishing operation&quot; (Gads! I cringe at that term, but no more than &quot;setting factor.&quot;)?

Hi Kellie, that was from my notes taken six years ago, I didn't realise I
had left them in, sorry about that. I know there has to be some initial
stimulus to get a response worthy of reinforcement.

At that time I was doing a TV series with a dog so kick-started the

happen.

[] &gt; Kellie, what do you think may be a relationship between &quot;clicker savvy&quot;
and &quot;establishing operation&quot; (Gads! I cringe at that term, but no more than
&quot;setting factor.&quot;)?

Okay, cool... let me see....

Let's start with a definition of an establishing operation. An establishing
operation is a condition or set of conditions that makes a reinforcer more
valuable to the one doing the behaving. The most common example is food
deprivation. An animal is more likely to work for food when he is hungry
than when he just finished off a side of beef. Lab rats are often on a
23-24 hour food deprivation schedule. They definitely feel like eating when
they're put in the operant chamber.

But, an establishing operation can be a lot of things. The meter on your
car dashboard pointing to E makes finding a gas station more reinforcing.
Cold weather makes putting on a coat for warmth more reinforcing. Your
spouse calling and saying she's had a great day at work may be an
establishing operation for hanging out for a pleasant evening together,
whereas your spouse calling and saying she's mad at you may be just the
opposite. Hanging out with a happy spouse is generally more reinforcing
than hanging out with an angry spouse.

So, let's see... if an animal... let's say an aardvark just for kicks...
has been clicker training for a long time and knows that every time he hears
that click he's going to get some delicious ants. He has a history of
getting ants when the clicker clicks, so he knows what the clicker means.

So... okay, I'm running into a snag. I can see how the clicker makes
performing behaviors more valuable. The sound of the clicker indicates that
treats are available for doing behaviors. But I can't see how the clicker
makes the reinforcer more valuable. So I don't see how &quot;clicker savvy&quot; and
EOs are related.

Pointers???

Let me wax a little philosophical here. Much of popular training is a difficult to understand mish-mash of science, technology, fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants, and snake oil. Behavior analysis purports to be pure science, and it does fairly well. Popular training is often like a field of marshmallows, with soft and difficult to find edges. Behavior analysis attempts to be so black and white, or two dimensional (it is either this or it is that, but never both or maybe it is neither) that it forgets that it is evolving, like any good science. This translates to behavior analysts thinking that it must be one or the other, but it cannot be both. In this example, it is the experience (antecedents) of the one doing the behaving that influences the nature and dimensions of both the behavior and the consequences.

This does NOT mean that behavior analysis is wrong. What it means is that the teaching of behavior analysis is limiting students of the discipline. This is a circumstance that I see often in behavior analysis, and, fortunately, it is correctable. There is only so much that can be learned from a rat pressing a lever in a small box. It is important that the simple rat experiments be done, but then it is time to move on. It is important that the students learn the separate three elements (the ABCs), and to know them well. But, there comes a time when the teachers should begin to teach more of the interrationship of the three elements, and, for instance, see how antecedents (experience) change the value of behavior and consequences (reinforcers).

Everyone would have figured this one out, given the time. This was a simple example. It is the how we, as trainers, as practitioners of BA (I hate spelling it out all of the time), see the world as this constant interplay of ABCs, with one effecting the other, and no one element acting alone, that allows us to more accurately judge what to do when we train animals and when we teach other trainers.

I was lucky. You folks can never be as lucky as I. I began to learn this very early, and I learned it from the finest BA practitioners I have known (the best that has ever been, in my opinion). As I have described so often, the Brelands talked of changing behavior as most people talk of changing clothes. This ability to analyze complex behavior is what you folks can learn from each other, especially with the guidance of Kellie and those familiar with BA; and that is a lot of you out there, I think. I am afraid that you won't get a lot of help from most BAs, or from the classroom, though I think this will change with time as the technology gradually infiltrates back into academia. I have heard from Pertti, and I suspect that there are other chicken workshop veterans who have been introduced to BA, and do quite well. There are others I don't know who likewise have more or less of an understanding of BA principles. Help each other. Be patient with each other. When you hear what seems to be BS on the list, speak up; speak gently, but speak up. On some lists the rules strongly control disagreement. From what I understand, other than outright personal flaming, this is a list where ideas (within the bounds of BA) may be challenged. Also, ask yourself, before you respond to a post, is it your ego responding, or your intellect? Of course, there are many large egos elsewhere, but not in animal training, and certainly not on this list. Remember too, it is tough to say things &quot;just right&quot; quickly. Brevity is to be applauded. When does brevity become cryptic? Who knows? Just give each other the benefit of the doubt.

Do remember a few rules:1) Simplify, simplify, simplify; and 2) beware of he or she who claims The Truth. The rest I think people can pick up along the way.

And remember, do only what I tell you to do, for, as you can tell, I am the Teller of The Truth (now, do you remember rule 2??) &lt;smile&gt;

Remember Bob, that there is one BA organization that is trying to change the
Skinner Box mentality. :-) While our department at UNT does have Skinner
boxes, ORCA does its research in real world settings with all the real world
variables of ... the real world.

The blending of the A-B-C is much easier to get a handle on in the real
world. But of course, the purpose of operant chamber experiments is to
separate details out, like one property of one kind of antecedent. We
couldn't do that as well in a zoo with a bear who is free to go lie down in
the water if we start boring him. But the operant chamber can't tell us
how that same principle will work when an animal has more choices and
distractions. To me the ideal use for the Skinner box is to figure out
stuff that can later be applied to help folks. That's what we're told, too.
But in practice, there is a caste system with a lot of experimental BAs
placing themselves at the top with applied people working with humans with
disabilities or problems next.

Applied people working with real animals in real settings are considerably
closer to the bottom of the totem pole. But I look at it this way. Anyone
can walk by and look at the faces closest to the bottom of the totem pole.
I literally wrote my application essay to this program on the fact that
nearly no one in BA was talking to the outside world and that was not only
unfortunate for everyone in the world who could be benefiting from this
science, but it is also unfortunate for BA because it limits the job
opportunities and keeps the public suspicious of our intentions.

Personally I find the modern type of Skinner boxes to be fascinating but not
too useful in training because basically, you set the research dimensions
electronically, put the bird in the box, wait, and read the data. There is
no training involved. Students learn to read the data which is important,
but they don't learn to set up envirnoments that will make certain behaviors
more likely. In some earlier programs students were required to make their
own Skinner boxes ... sort of like your garbage can science (Bob), only in
labs... but I don't know if much of that goes on today. Today, it may be
interesting for some readers to know, you can even order rats that have
already been conditioned to certain kinds of Skinner box activities. You
can order rats or pigeons that have been clicker trained on a certain
schedule of reinforcement. You can order rats with certain genetic
characteristics. This can speed things up.

But it can also lead to problems. List, remember back in the 80s when
saccharine was taken off the market because it caused cancer in rats? Lo
and behold the rats used in the study were from a strain with a genetic
tendency to get cancer. Those rats were probably going to get cancer
anyway. And saccharine is back on the market in a rare turn-around.
Imagine how many &quot;facts&quot; have changed how we live because of mistakes like
this!

So, ORCA provides students with opportunities to work out in the real world
with a variety of species.

Shaping is a teaching process. Once the behavior is learned, you start it

Once you're on the set, the behavior should begin when you give a cue.
That's about stimulus control which is different from shaping.

I have very &quot;soft&quot; dogs. They shut down to the point of refusing high value treats if there are too many distractions/ too much stress. Eventually they will settle in but on several ocaasions I have noticed that if I can find something to click for, they will take the treat that was just refused (and that jumps starts them settling in).
Has the click made the treat more valuable?
Is it just being conditioned to taking a treat when they hear the click?

What ever the answer - it works.

reinforcable behavior. &lt;&lt;

Hi Kellie, I usually hear (and use, although I believe technically it is
incorrect) the term &quot;such and such is Operant right now&quot; or &quot;so and so is
not Operant right now&quot; to describe whether or not a dog is receptive to
learning via Operant Conditioning.

Let's say we've got a dog who is nervous of other dogs in a class setting
and we click and treat but see no increase in the clicked and treated
response. Observant clicker trainers often say &quot;that dog is not Operant
right now&quot;. Later the dog starts to relax, and we do see an increase in
the clicked and treated response. We then say &quot;now that dog is Operant&quot;.

What would THAT be called?

Regards,
Aidan

"/> I don't know of a BA term to describe that. What we would do is describe
the behavior in relation to the conditions. &quot;The dog didn't accept the ham
when the stranger was in the room.&quot;

We look at the level of the observable for a very important reason. When
you start adding levels of behavior you start adding layers of meaning and
the more of that you have the more opportunities you have to make mistakes.
We're a lot more interested in describing behavior than in labelling the
animal in relation to some set of behaviors.

Kellie Snider

Yes &lt;&lt;gg&gt;&gt; you are missing something but this was my mistake, I should
have explained further, a dog wouldn't last long in that industry if it took all day
to offer behaviour. The series I was referring to went on for many years with
two of my dogs (father and son) who were under contract.

The following is an edited clip (too big for the web) of a commercial being
made in a plane with another crew filming us. It is very busy, you need a
highly trained dog for this that can adapt to change.
http://www.k9events.com/Today_Show.htm

The director continually changes his mind as to what he wants, the lighting
is wrong, or something else is wrong, the animal often meets something he
has not experienced before such as riding a camel or flying in a helicopter
and you only have a short time to train on the set in-between scenes.

I guess Bob would agree that the trainer needs to know short cuts to get
behaviour quickly, I frequently needed to string behaviours together in
sequences that may never be used again.... It was very interesting.....

Oh, I see! I can see how that would be a really good reason to use
targeting and luring!

Hello Everyone.

This is Ed, not Kellie.

It isn't that hard to put yourself on Digest or otherwise change your
membership. Go to the website and sign in. Look for Unsubscribe or change
membership and click on it. That will take you to the page that lets you
edit your membership.

I'm going to have to ask that you try to manage your own accounts. I'm
getting several requests a day to make changes to people's accounts and have
been doing it, but it's getting to the point that I really need to ask that
you go directly to Google Groups yourself and manage things directly.

If you want to unsubscribe, simply send a blank email to
Click-L-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com .

If you want to change settings to receive digest or individual emails or
whatever, please go to  http://groups.google.com/  .

Several of you have noticed that because you were added when the list
changed some time back you don't actually have Google accounts. I do not
know how or why that is allowed. You can easily sign up for a Google
account for free. Go to  http://groups.google.com/  . About halfway down the
page there is a place where you are invited to Sign In or to Join. Select
Join. Follow the instructions for creating an account. I just did it with
a test account and it was very, very easy. If I can do it, so can you.

Once you have created an account, Google will send you a link to verify your
account. Respond to that email as instructed.

In the meantime, you will now find yourself on a page with a Google Groups
search engine. Type in Click-L and you'll find our list.

After you have done this, you can manage your account.

Please do this before asking me for assistance in changing your settings.

Maybe, putting those links at the bottom of your signature would help people have access to them every time you post and than you will not need to repeat the process as often...
Just a thought....

If you go to manage your own accounts you may want to check out the
&quot;Abridged&quot; option. Instead of Digest or Daily emails, you get a summary of
new activity each day.

Please don't ask me to switch you to abridged... Refer to the previous post
and check out the options in your account.

I've been searching the Google Groups management options and it appears that
there is no way to set recurring messages within Google Groups as you can in
Yahoo Groups. If anyone knows something about that please contact me
privately.
