Hi all,

We have managed to last out this long with Honey acting out and generally
making a nuisance of herself.  Her trashing has got to the stage where I am
replacing everything in her house 3 times a day.  I would leave the mess but
she does naughty things with her water supply so it ends up not hygenic I
hate those water bottles so I have to clean up after her. .  She is sitting
in her cage washing her ears looking ever so cute and innocent... but when
no one is looking.....  as for Miranda Panda, she has decided she will
rebuff any attempts at friendship.  She has decided she is going to be an
untamed bunny who is scared of everything :((  She will hesitantly take
parsley from my hand but only if shes in the mood for parsley.  Any other
time if I go near she runs to the furtherest away corner.  She has also
resisted all attempts to use her toilet.  The whole floor of her house is
her bathroom as far as she is concerned and the toilet itself is actually
her nest.  How come I got the buns with attitude?  I really do believe that
Male Lops are the easiest to live with.  I hope to God that speying mellows
the pair of them or they will be the death of me yet !  Well its time to
go,... Honey is shredding paper, doing her best to get my attention and
remind me that her house is messy yet again.

Regards Kate (stressed out) and Honey (bored to death) and Miranda (
scaredey cat .. if thats possible for a bun)  Roll on Monday!!!  Just 2 big
sleeps to go.

Hi Kate,
I think you have to wait until the pms hormones settle down before you can
get an accurate picture of how their relationship or temperaments will
settle. That will take a few months. Trying to bond them now could mean a
lot of false starts. I think Miranda will come out of her shell eventually,
but may take some time. I think the potty training will get better over time
as well, once the hormones and stress settle. :)

The Phooka refused to use his litter box for a toilet and wanted to use it
as a bed.  It took a few days for the stupid human to catch on, but once I
gave him two identical boxes, he chose one for a toilet and one for a bed,
and we never had a problem again.

Maybe Miranda wants a second box?
