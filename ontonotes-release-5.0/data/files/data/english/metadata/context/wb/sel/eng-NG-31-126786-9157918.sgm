1 Workers' issues

1.1 Farm dwellers want government's help

Mhlaba Memela, Sowetan, 10 October 2007

Farm dwellers evicted from Thenderboard farm in Bergville in northern KwaZulu-Natal have appealed to the provincial government for help.

They said they were illegally evicted by farmer John Potgieter.

Worker Sibusiso Miya said their belongings were also burnt.

He said his late parents lived and worked on Thenderboard for more than 30 years.

Farmworkers said they opened a case of illegal eviction at the local police station against Potgieter, but police had done nothing to help them.

Thabo Manyathi, spokesman for the Association for Rural Advancement (Afra), challenged the Agriculture and Land Affairs Minister Lulu Xingwana and her provincial counterpart, MEC Mtholephi Mthimkhulu, to act on their expropriation promises.

Manyathi said: &quot;Landless people are victimised on a daily basis by farmers who conduct illegal evictions.

&quot;We hope the ministers will set an example on expropriation in this case.

&quot;Xingwana had threatened to expropriate land belonging to farmers who illegally evict landless people,&quot; Manyathi said.

Potgieter's lawyer, who did not want his name published, rejected both Miya's and Afra's claims.

He said the dwelling in question was a run-down mud hut that had been standing empty for more than two years and that his client had offered to rehouse the family in an old brick school structure.

In a separate case, the Landless People's Movement (LPM) at Dannhauser in northern KwaZulu- Natal has threatened to &quot;take over by force&quot; the Slytelspoort farm following the alleged illegal eviction of farm dweller Lizzy Nkosi and her family.

The LPM has given Mthimkhulu until November 15 to force the farmer to allow Nkosi and her family to return.

Meanwhile, Mthimkhulu said the recently launched Provincial Land and Agrarian Reform Forum (Plarfo) would begin the task of addressing the adversarial relations growing between farmers, farmworkers and farm dwellers.

Mthimkhulu said his office had already begun documenting incidents of abuse and illegal evictions for discussion with organisations such as the LPM, his department, the Land Affairs Department and representatives of organised agriculture.

&quot;With regard to the Nkosi family, I have asked the land reform office of the Land Affairs Department to furnish me with a detailed report.

&quot;I have been made aware that the department has handled the case before,&quot; said Mthimkhulu.
'We hope the minister will set an example on expropriations in this case'

1.2 Farmers pressure Xingwana

IOL, 10 October 2007

Tensions between government and commercial farming unions boiled over following a joint press conference in Pretoria on Tuesday.

&quot;Stop talking this populist nonsense,&quot; a member of agriculture union TAU SA told Deputy Agriculture and Land Affairs Minister Dirk du Toit after a press conference which followed a Presidential Agricultural Working Group meeting at the Union Buildings.

Du Toit and some of the agriculture union members had a heated argument after the press conference about Du Toit's statement during the conference that agriculture was not attracting investment due to farm evictions.

&quot;This kind of obscure ethnic cleansing is doing South Africa a disfavour; we'll continue discussions in this regard and try to put a stop to these kind of apartheid related activities,&quot; Du Toit said.

When asked if the matter was raised with unions and examples of their members given against whom they could take action, he said he had written to the unions, which was loudly denied by union representatives.

During the press briefing Agriculture and Land Affairs Minister Lulu Xingwana tried to put a positive spin on the issue that has seen her and her deputy clash with commercial agriculture unions at several occasions over the past year.

&quot;The matter was raised by the leaders of the farmers unions, some of them. It was agreed at the meeting that our meeting would discuss this and come to an amicable conclusion on how we are going to work together on these matters,&quot; she said.

She was referring to a further meeting scheduled between government and agriculture representatives on Friday that will try to resolve some of the contentious issues in the sector.

She said government would soon launch a Land and Agriculture Programme to speed up land reform.

The programme aims to redistribute five million hectares of agricultural land to 10 000 new farmers, increase black entrepreneurs in agribusiness, and other programmes to change the face of agriculture.

&quot;It is about skills transfer, it's about a kind of a one-stop shop where we bring together all our services, it is also about fast-tracking the land reform programme,&quot; Xingwana said.

She said the programme would fast-track land delivery by aligning existing programme between the Agriculture and Land Affairs departments, sharing resources between them, and the programme would try to secure financial assistance for new farmers.

&quot;We are saying through this special structure, through this special programme, we are going to cut the red tape,&quot; she said. - Sapa

1.3 Cry beloved Bapong

Tommy Makoe, Sowetan, 10 October 2007

The once beautiful and tranquil village now lies in ruin, deflowered by heartless mining magnates
Bapong village is dying a slow death. The village is a victim of the local platinum mines, which ravage the area and ship off its wealth to be enjoyed elsewhere.

The devastation is visible everywhere in this tiny settlement outside Brits in the North West. Ironically, even in the dismal days of apartheid, Bapong was a beautiful, tranquil refuge amid the surrounding insanity.

Now clouds of sickening grey dust swirl off the mine dumps that dot the area and descend on humans, animals and plants in a fine shroud that chokes the life out of everything. And our politicians tell us proudly that this is development.

Green trees and colourful wild flowers are reduced to a uniform pallid shadow that mocks the memories of a rural past.

Lumbering mine trucks roam Bapong's untarred roads, belching diesel fumes and churning up dust in a constant reminder of the new order in these parts.

The streams that once bubbled through the area have been sucked dry and polluted. Choruses of birdsong and amphibian croaks from the childhood era are now reduced to a few discordant chirps from the few lingering survivors.

The Bapo people's orchards and vegetable patches are also smothered and dying.

Even my great-grandparents' graves must now share their peace with the noisy and destructive mines.

The spiritual, traditional and religious values of the graveyard have been reduced to cheap memorabilia by business gone mad.

Constant blasting from deep below the weakened village has robbed Bapong of all the tranquility that once marked its existence. Now the villagers hear rumours that their settlement will cave in once the miners leave, having sucked out the area's wealth and beauty and after destroying its social structures and environment.

These are minor distractions for the multibillion- rand mines, which will bequeath nothing to the moribund village but filth, TB, respiratory ailments, natural disasters, a destroyed environment and a ruined populace.

Thirteen years into democracy and our government sells us out with impunity, trading our constitutionally protected rights to a clean and healthy environment for payouts to its BEE cronies and the empty promise of jobs and development.

Bapong and its people are sacrificed, and ecosystems throughout the area are devastated forever. Our obsequious officials treat the mining magnates with kid gloves, knowing well that they trample on human rights and shatter the natural and social environment.

Government puppets lie without conscience as they tout the party line, saying the platinum mines benefit this poor community. The benefits, they say, far outweigh the permanent harm to the environment and the residents' living conditions.

How would they know? Why should they care? The politicians and their senior officials shelter in faraway luxurious houses to enjoy the proceeds of their greed.

But the latest in a string of studies supposed to prove these benefits once again gave lie to these claims.
The Bech Marks Foundation for Southern Africa for Corporate Social Responsibility released its results last month, which again confirmed that the mines are trashing the natural and cultural environment in the North West.

Anglo Platinum, Implats, Lonplats and Xstrata all boast so-called social responsibility programmes, &quot;but these do not address the impact of the mining on communities&quot;, it found - as if we did not know.

The report shows that 80 percent of residents from communities torn apart by the mines, report respiratory problems and 60 percent are infected with HIV.

Not even apartheid wreaked such devastation.

Mines consume millions of cubic metres of underground water each year, and still filch what remains of surface waters.

The report enumerates the cost in land degradation, erosion and the destruction of vegetation.

Global warming will compound the problems and bring on drought, but the mines' decades of profligate use and contamination of water will affect any survivors in this region forever.

Our waters will be poisoned long after the mansions of the BEE sell-outs have crumbled to dust.

As a city boy, I would relish the beauty and the wildlife when I visited my family's ancestral home in the village.

I was fascinated by the baboons that blocked the roads and the thousands of antelopes grazing and browsing around the leafy Bapong.

In the morning, a cool breeze and the chirping of birds would awaken me. The smell of fresh dung and the sounds of the bellowing bulls would remind me I was home, home in Bapong, far from the crime-ridden hustle and bustle of Soweto.

First thing in the morning, I would fetch water from the communal tap. The boy from Jozi would be the talk of the village.

Next would be the kraal, where I sucked milk directly from a cow's teats like my country cousins.

But all that is gone and my grandchildren will never enjoy these experiences. The environment has been poisoned forever, and Bapong village, like many others, will be killed by the mining boom.

The mines have already shattered social structures. Kgosi Bob Mogale and all Bapong's traditions have been sucked dry.

From the third grade, youths binge on alcohol plied by taverns mushrooming in the area. Crime has soared and the impoverished young girls sell their nubile bodies to sex-starved mineworkers.

Rickety facilities crumble under the onslaught of migrants drawn from elsewhere in the often forlorn hope of finding jobs in the mines. As at all mines throughout South Africa, the magnates prefer compliant outsiders to local folks, who they fear might be persuaded to strike against the unhealthy conditions and meagre salary.

Dismal informal settlements with no electricity, sewerage or running water sprout everywhere. The impoverished residents of squatter camps relieve themselves in plastic bags and dump their solid waste every where. Folks joke that these plastic bags are our new flowers.

Backyard shacks blight almost every home as dirt-poor residents try to cash in on a boom that's passing them by.

Yet another violent protest against the non-existent delivery of promised services will soon hit Bapong.

As usual, the government will be blamed while its sheltered partners in crime, the mining bosses, smile all the way to the banks, sniffing haughtily as the natives get restless.

The poor rural blacks will again bear the costs of social, economic and political instability. The rich, old and new, are separated from these uncomfortable scenes by the lush mountains between Bapong and the rich Hartebeespoort area.

The only time they catch a glimpse of their poor neighbours is when they drive past Bapong in the comfort of their 4x4s and German sedans on their way to fritter away their wealth in Sun City.

Here in Bapong, a family would survive for a week on less than what any one of them spends on an hour of entertainment.

1.4 Union says illegal mining is a lucrative business

SABC, 9 October 2007

The National Union of Mineworkers (Num) general secretary, Frans Baleni, says illegal mining is a lucrative business. He was reacting to the deaths of 25 illegal miners whose bodies were recovered from St. Helena Mine in the Free State Goldfields. The miners died after a fire broke out in a disused shaft.

Meanwhile, Num is considering a one day strike at all the country's mines to protest against safety standards. Num says it will take a decision on whether to strike after talking to the minerals and energy department about a safety audit ordered by President Thabo Mbeki. Mbeki ordered the audit after 3 200 miners were temporarily trapped underground at Harmony Gold's Elandsrand mine last week.

Last year 199 workers died in accidents at local mines. Baleni says although the figure is down from 2005, it still falls short of the commitment made three years ago.

1.5 Miners' families may claim bodies

IOL, 9 October 2007

The families of 23 illegal miners killed in an underground fire in disused mine shafts on the Free State gold fields will identify the bodies on Wednesday, police said.

Superintendent Mtantsi Makhele said the post mortems of the bodies had not been completed.

&quot;They (families) will only be allowed to identify the bodies on Wednesday morning.&quot;

It was believed that an unknown number of illegal miners, also known as zama-zamas, were feared dead, either suffocated or burned to death, while trapped underground by the fire.

More than 100 zama-zamas were arrested for trespassing when they surfaced at working mines in the area after fleeing underground to these mines to escape the fire and poisonous gases about two weeks ago.

Security at the working mines was increased after the incident.

Police said some of the illegal miners, who were arrested, returned to the mines on Sunday to look for missing colleagues. They brought eight bodies to the surface.

Another 15 bodies were later recovered and were taken to the state mortuary in Welkom.

Minerals and Energy Minister Buyelwa Sonjica and mine unions have since condemned illegal mining. - Sapa

1.6 Firefighters edgy as season of flames nears

Anel Powell, Cape Times, 10 October 2007

Only half of the Western Cape's 30 municipalities will be ready for this year's fire season, and most will have to cope with outdated equipment and massive staff shortages, Local Government and Housing MEC Richard Dyantyi warned on Tuesday.

And there is concern that an agreement between the National Treasury and Fifa to allocate funds for extra emergency services staff ahead of the 2010 World Cup does not include funding for training of fire service staff.

While disaster readiness plans for 2010 will accelerate improvements in host cities such as Cape Town, little is being done to prepare outlying areas for fires, floods and other natural disasters.

Although new ambulances have been bought and are already &quot;on the road&quot; in the Western Cape, Dyantyi said more needed to be done to address the needs of the fire service in and outside of the World Cup host cities.

Schalk Carstens, provincial director of Disaster Management and Fire Brigade Services, said Fifa's focus was on host cities and that not all municipalities would benefit from 2010 preparation plans.

The City of Cape Town's fire service, already struggling with staff shortages, responds to an average of 700 medical-related calls a month.

Ian Schnetler, the city's chief fire officer, said: &quot;We understand the pressure that the provincial ambulance service is under and (we) cannot turn away people who have medical emergencies. All spheres of government must co-operate to give the best possible service to all residents of the city and if the ambulance service is not coping, it is our responsibility to support them as much as possible.&quot;

Although the city council has made 54 appointments and will next month hire 30 trainee firefighters, six forestry staff, 54 seasonal firefighters and 13 reservists, it still has a long way to go to fill its 600 critical vacancies before 2010.

&quot;Yes, the shortage is still a concern. However, the situation has improved since last year and last year we managed very well. Considering that it took 10 years for the staff situation to get to this stage, it (the appointments) is a very good improvement,&quot; councillor Debbie Schafer, who heads the city's task team on fire services, said.

She said the city was still finalising its fire season plans, but equipment shortages were &quot;minimal&quot; and there was a budget for staff to work overtime during the peak fire period.

Dyantyi will meet mayors and municipal managers from throughout the province on Friday to assess their fire readiness, weaknesses and budget allocations for fire brigades.

&quot;Lack of planning is a major challenge. We have dedicated this Provincial Advisory Forum meeting (to this).&quot; Municipalities that did not plan ahead for these disasters would spend up to triple the amount on damages, Dyantyi said.

Recent disasters, including fires and storms, had cost the province &quot;billions of rand&quot;.

&quot;We do not want to be caught unawares this time round. We are doing everything we can to be a step ahead of the game to minimise debt and human losses.&quot;

Dyantyi said the recent Overberg fire destroyed the area's entire flower industry. Fire damage in 2006 cost Eden R604-million in insured losses and R274-million in uninsured losses, while damage caused by the Harlem hail storm cost R30-million.

Dyantyi said some municipalities were on track with their disaster management strategies, while others did not even mention prevention strategies in their Integrated Development Plans.

In 2005, the Provincial Disaster Management Centre identified 11 high-risk communities, including Masiphumelele, Doornbach, Khayelitsha, Khayamnandi and De Doorns.

Although these areas were consistently affected by fires and had trained almost 1 000 disaster management volunteers in the past two years, more communities were being identified as danger spots.

Carstens said &quot;what-if&quot; investigations of potential natural disasters needed to be done in high-risk areas.

But despite these &quot;huge challenges&quot;, Dyantyi said the province was performing well.

The provincial government has partnered with the South African Weather Service, the Department of Education, the City of Cape Town and other municipalities to support an international strategy on disaster reduction.

Activities during this week, declared by the United Nations as a disaster risk-reduction week, include public awareness about disaster preparation.

&quot;We need to get all the municipalities to work together as fire knows no boundaries.&quot;

An early-warning system for the reduction of fires and flood will be introduced next month in three pilot areas - Masiphumelele, Khayamnandi and a section of Khayelitsha.

1.7 Executive turnover blamed on stress, affirmative action
Ingi Salgado, Business Report, 10 October 2007
Turnover of the top brass at South African companies continued to mimic global trends in the year to July as high numbers of executives left their jobs, according to a Deloitte survey on executive remuneration released yesterday.

Global turnover of chief executives, in particular, is at an all-time high. The rate is four times higher than five years ago, and there is &quot;no let-up in sight&quot;, the survey notes.

&quot;The well-publicised spate of chief executive resignations from large South African corporates over the last 18 months mirrors this global trend and is ... a cause for great concern,&quot; said Louise Marx, Deloitte manager for human capital.

The survey did not provide reasons for South Africa's high turnover rate, but the Institute of Directors (IoD) yesterday blamed job stress.

The movement of affirmative action executives between jobs could also be a factor, as 31 percent of respondents in the survey experienced poaching of affirmative action executives, while 36 percent encountered regular headhunting of qualified and experienced black executives by recruitment agencies.

IoD executive director Tony Dickson said chief executives were under more pressure than ever before to deliver short-term results, and many suffered burnout.

Whereas loyalty was of prime consideration a decade or two ago, short-term expectations that were often unrealistic were now key measures of executive performance, Dickson said. He attributed this to growing shareholder activism.

Executives found the pressure too much to bear beyond terms of five to 10 years. &quot;It takes a lot of energy, drive and commitment,&quot; he said.

However, Dickson believed the tide was starting to turn.

Executives were &quot;slowly but surely&quot; being given more leeway to create platforms for future growth as stakeholders shifted their focus to long-term performance.

His assessment may be supported by numbers from the Deloitte survey, which showed that average executive turnover for the year to July was 10.5 percent, lower than the previous year's 13.5 percent.

Marx said the decline could indicate an actual slowdown in turnover, but cautioned that it was also possibly as a result of differing samples from one year to the next.

On remuneration, the survey showed that average salary increases for executives was higher than expected at 7.6 percent for basic salary and 7.4 percent for guaranteed packages including benefits.

The probable reasons for pay rises coming in higher than predicted were skills shortages, job pressures and the movement of affirmative action executives between jobs, said Marx.

The survey found that 23 percent of organisations experienced difficulty in recruiting executives, with executive skills shortages most evident in the areas of finance, manufacturing and operations.

1.8 Stats SA must plug holes in labour force survey

Neva Makgetla, Business Day, 10 October 2007

THE latest figures on employment, from the March 2007 Labour Force Survey (LFS), suggest a mixed picture.

Employment is up, particularly in construction, business services and mining. But job growth slowed from 4,6% in the year to March 2006 to just 1,6% in the year to March 2007.

This finding is probably wrong, however. The LFS reports a slowdown exclusively in the informal sector, where the data are notoriously unreliable. In contrast, growth in other employment accelerated, with formal jobs growing an impressive 4,2% in the year to 2007 compared to 3,2% in the previous year.

Statistics SA seems to ignore the problems with the informal data. Instead, it should take the peculiar results as notice that it's long past time to improve this section of the survey.

Don't get me wrong: the LFS is the greatest invention since mango sorbet. It asks important questions and is generally as reliable as statistics anywhere in the world. That means, of course, that its findings should be treated very cautiously and rechecked when they contradict broader economic trends. From this standpoint, it is disconcerting that Stats SA reports so blithely on findings that don't make sense.

Despite this, the LFS remains crucial for our understanding of the economy. Indeed, it is because of its overall strength that the persistent problems around the informal-employment figures are so worrying.

A graph of reported informal employment over the past five years looks more like a proposal for a circus ride than a reflection of a deadly serious social issue. If we believe Stats SA, informal employment plummeted 22% between February 2002 and March 2004, then recovered 37% over the following two years, only to drop 10% in the past year. In the same five years, growth in both the economy and formal employment accelerated steadily. It is simply not believable that informal employment fluctuated in the manner reported.

Admittedly, it is no easy thing to measure informal employment in a developing country. The difficulties arise from the practice of applying, without modification, a concept of employment that was developed for industrialised countries.

In the north, for most of the past century, being employed was virtually synonymous with having a monetary income. Even the self-employed, urban or rural, earned most of their income in cash and paid taxes.

In contrast, much of the population in developing economies is self-employed, untaxed and thus unlikely to keep accounts, and often engaged in production mostly for household consumption. In many cases, this type of employment neither generates a measurable cash income nor lifts the household out of poverty.

Even in SA, which is comparatively industrialised, in March 2007 one in five employed people was reported as self-employed. Of these, three-quarters were in the informal sector, which contributed less than a quarter of total employment. The reported decline in informal employment in the year to March 2007 occurred exclusively among the self-employed - which is the hardest category of employment to count consistently.

A further problem is that many self-employed people reported earning no income. The bulk of these were subsistence farmers. In fact, most earned an income, but in kind: in the form of production for their families. The failure of the LFS to estimate the value of this output makes it much harder to understand employment and earnings trends. The greatest fluctuations in reported employment occur in this noncash category. In March 2005, the LFS found 400000 informal workers, virtually all self-employed, with no income. A year later, with no explanation, the figure climbed to 600000, while in March 2007 it dropped back to 360000.

These trends suggest that the problem is one of definition. Stats SA can't seem to come up with a consistent way to define subsistence farmers or their income. Yet this failure leads to absurdities in the statistical system, with serious ramifications for our understanding of trends in employment, incomes and economic growth.

2 Union matters

2.1 All clear on the Cosatu front

Xolani Xundu, Times, 10 October 2007

Zwelinzima Vavi has never sounded so coherent in articulating the union's stance on the issues.
I once penned what Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi considered a scathing profile of him. He was later to inform me, during an interview, that the profile had hurt him badly.

He said something to the effect of: &quot;I don't know why I even agreed to be interviewed by you.&quot;

I assured him it was nothing personal. The profile, published in the Sunday Times, was based on my observations as I followed him around as he made speeches at workers' meetings. It was only three months after ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma was fired from the cabinet.

Tensions were high and Vavi had just declared that trying to prevent Zuma from becoming the next president was like &quot;trying to fight the big wave of the tsunami&quot;.

Fast-forward to last week and the Platform for Public Deliberation at Wits Great Hall. Vavi was lecturing about the efforts to transform the ANC into a pro-poor organisation.

I've never heard him being so clear and coherent in articulating Cosatu's views on the ANC succession debate and the problems the federation has with the ANC. There was an absence of hyperbole, sound bites and hot air in his speech.

He spelt out the problems: that the first decade of freedom in South Africa benefited capital and that the second decade of freedom would have to belong to the working class and the poor.

Vavi said the only way to achieve this would be to build a strong and independent working class and an ANC that was committed to the fundamentals of the national democratic revolution, and to ensure that the tripartite alliance was at the centre of the drive for radical transformation.

He said the introduction of Gear, an economic strategy, in 1996 spawned an undemocratic culture in the ANC, a culture of bureaucratic centralism that was alien to the democratic movement.

&quot;The right to decide economic direction and policy was preserved for the elite few. Decision making was reserved for the cabinet, with our movement and the alliance, and the rest of society, tail-ending decisions made by the executive,&quot; he said.

&quot;The political settlement was secured through a thoroughgoing process of building sufficient consensus across the political spectrum. But the economic-policy door was firmly shut. Gear was rammed down without consultation.

&quot;Much of the controversy in the alliance emanates from this near- autocratic way of handling sensitive policy questions, and the marginalisation of both the ANC and the alliance from the core process of policy development and formulation,&quot; Vavi told his Wits audience.

The decision to demand an alliance pact for transformation arises not out of some confused and politically immature working class, he said, but was a serious political intervention.

What does Cosatu really want?

An implementation of all the clauses of the Freedom Charter, an end to privatisation, adoption of an economic policy that ensures redistribution of wealth to the poor and the repeal of legislation that is not worker-friendly.

Vavi said: &quot;What we are fighting for is to create space for workers to raise, and agitate for, their own issues. One of the major issues that causes all the problems now is that that space is closed.

&quot;We want space so that when we go to State House and Luthuli House we can be listened to and our ideas be taken seriously. The rest is a matter of the balance of forces on the ground.&quot;

Cosatu hoped, Vavi said, that the leadership that emerged from the ANC's national conference in December would be sympathetic to its cause.

&quot;We want a new kind of politics in our movement in which competition between our leaders will not be about who has the largest holiday resort but about who serves our people best.&quot;

Maybe the audience, consisting of academics, students and opinion makers, had something to do with
Vavi's clarity of thought.

2.2 From worker control to palace politics

Drew Forrest, Mail &amp; Guardian, 9 October 2007

&quot;He's behaving like Cosatu belongs to him,&quot; muttered one observer. It was a reference to Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi -- the high-spirited, joke-cracking star of the show at the federation's recent central committee (CC) meeting.

Everything was going Vavi's way. His personal and ideological rival, Cosatu president Willie Madisha, was facing the axe after telling police he handed unaccounted-for cash to communist boss Blade Nzimande. And the CC was set to endorse Jacob Zuma for the ANC presidency.

It was hard not to share the unease over Vavi's performance. Was the CC really an expression of worker control? Or was it &quot;palace politics&quot; -- Nzimande's description, in a speech to delegates, of the ANC's current leadership style?

The previous week, Madisha's enemies had tried to drive through a motion of no-confidence in his leadership, in an apparent move to keep him off the CC podium. Then the SACP weighed in by announcing -- without the benefit of a forensic investigation -- that no evidence had been found for his claims about the missing cash.

Both ploys miscarried, and Madisha, a sombre and isolated figure, was on stage throughout the four-day meeting.

It was a disgraceful piece of chicanery, using an unresolved factional dispute in another organisation as a weapon. Where was Cosatu's vaunted independence?

A mark of factional struggles is the caricaturing of one's opponents, and Vavi himself is a victim of this.

The Mbeki camp has portrayed Madisha as hostile to the ANC, when a recent Labour Bulletin interview revealed that he is a former Cosas militant and ardent admirer of Oliver Tambo. He believes Thabo Mbeki has betrayed the congress tradition.

But Madisha has also been parodied by his foes. He is not an Mbeki man; he appears, rather, to have grave doubts about Zuma's credentials as a worker champion. The irony is that the embattled Cosatu president does not seem to share Vavi and Nzimande's faith in a reformed ANC and tripartite alliance as the road to a socialist state.

Madisha may have lied about the money, but there is no hard proof of this. What is certain is that he has a track record as a &quot;supporter of the working-class project&quot;, as one observer put it.

Of equal concern is the CC's list of favoured candidates for the ANC's top six posts, to be decided at Polokwane in December. Apart from former mineworker leaders Kgalema Motlanthe and Gwede Mantashe, none has a union history or known worker sympathies.

Indeed, by naming such figures as parliamentary speaker Baleka Mbete and ex-premier Matthews Phosa, Cosatu largely echoed the ANC Youth League.

The unanimous and unconditional endorsement of Zuma for the ANC's top job is particularly hard to fathom. The only whisper of dissent came from the shopworkers' union Saccawu, which proposed an accounting mechanism to bind listed candidates to Cosatu's political and economic demands.

Zuma's rape trial, and what it said about his view of women, is known to have angered Cosatu's gender activists, particularly in Saccawu.

And while CC documents urged a radical overhaul of fiscal and monetary policies, Zuma told the United States bank Citigroup last week that existing policies were correct. During the public service strike, he criticised both sides.

Then there is the small matter of corruption. Zuma's long rearguard action against a trial may ultimately succeed -- but that will not dispel the cloud over him.

He has never satisfactorily explained the &quot;encrypted fax&quot; in which a French arms firm allegedly offered him an annual bribe. And although Judge Hilary Squires may not have used the precise words &quot;generally corrupt&quot; to describe his relationship with Schabir Shaik, that is the clear thrust of his judgement.

Zuma told Cosatu's 2002 congress, which gave him a hero's welcome, that he is communist by inclination. In reality, his instincts appear to be those of a conservative rural patriarch.

The Shaik trial revealed that he was driven into Shaik's sleazy embrace by huge debts incurred by spending on his extended family and Nkandla homestead. Like a feudal magnate, he apparently believed his Big Man status entitled him to certain benefits, whether or not he could not afford them.

Cosatu's enthusiasm for Zuma may be partly strategic: it may calculate that he is the only realistic challenger to Mbeki, and that many suitable left candidates are not widely known.

And it is not wholly driven from the top. Senior communist Jeremy Cronin has remarked on his powerful &quot;worker/peasant&quot; magnetism. Disillusioned with Mbeki, many poor South Africans are clearly looking for a new deliverer.

But Cosatu, at least, could have tried to remain uncontaminated by the ruling party's brutal power politics.

Its leaders could have punted a more principled option -- Motlanthe, for example. Their single-minded advocacy of the ANC deputy president, and conspiracy of silence on his manifest faults, amounts to a misuse of leadership.

2.3 Municipal unions at odds with Mufamadi

Wyndham Hartley, Parliamentary Editor, Business Day, 10 October 2007

Municipal trade unions have taken aim at Provincial and Local Government Minister Sydney Mufamadi for giving them limited time to comment on legislation that seeks to make sweeping changes to the way local government is run.

The Local Government Laws Amendment Bill, if enacted in its present form, will compel all municipal managers to declare their business and financial interests within 60 days of their appointment. It also seeks to make it compulsory to establish ward committees and to delegate executive powers to them.

A submission to Parliament's provincial and local government committee from the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) said the bill was published on July 2 and interested parties were given until July 20 to make representations.

&quot;We consider the time periods to submit comments extremely short and clearly not aimed at promoting popular participation in the legislation-making process,&quot; the union said.

Many civil society bodies, including trade unions, did not have the means at their disposal to study and comment meaningfully on proposed legislation and policies within the proposed time frame , it said.

&quot;This is an issue that must be seriously addressed by government if it is committed to the building and sustaining of participatory democracy.&quot;

The union said it was ironic that while interested parties were given limited time to comment on the bill, the department had published a national policy framework entitled Rooting Government Among the People .

The Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union said that Mufamadi's bill was unconstitutional in that it usurped the powers strictly placed within the local government sphere by the constitution.

This view was shared by the Cape Bar Council, which said in its submission that the Municipal Systems Act initially enabled local councils to establish ward committees but the proposed changes would make it obligatory.

&quot;This suggests an executive function, and if so, this would necessarily involve some or other executive delegation in order to make a ward committee properly effective in its statutory purpose, which is to deal with matters of local concern. It is in this context that a concern about the constitutionality of clause six arises.

&quot;If the obligation to create ward committees is accompanied by an obligation to delegate to these committees the necessary executive power to deal with matters of local concern to their wards - this would appear to amount to a prescription to a municipal council that it must devolve certain executive powers&quot;, which was probably at odds with chapter seven of the constitution.

3 Alliance politics

3.1 'Dignity, discipline' on road to Polokwane

Mail &amp; Guardian, 10 October 2007

No individual's opinion on who should be elected to the African National Congress' national leadership took precedence in Gauteng, the party's new provincial chairperson Paul Mashatile said on Tuesday.

&quot;In Gauteng there is no individual position, there is no Paul Mashatile position on who we will elect to the national leadership in Limpopo.&quot;

&quot;This is a matter that our branches and other structures will collectively discuss and decide on ... as Gauteng we will go to Limpopo united behind what we consider to be the best team to lead the ANC in our country,&quot; Mashatile told delegates at the end of the province's 10th conference in Midrand.

The ANC will hold its national conference in Polokwane, Limpopo, in December.

Mashatile, reportedly a backer of ANC presidential hopeful Tokyo Sexwale, beat Angie Motshekga in the race to become chairperson at the conference on Sunday.

In his address on Tuesday, Mashatile thanked Motshekga, reportedly a Zuma ally, for her &quot;sterling leadership&quot; and said the province looked forward to her &quot;continued contribution&quot;.

He said the province would prepare for the ruling party's national conference with &quot;the same dignity and discipline that we have prepared for this provincial conference&quot;.

This preparation would be guided by the party's objectives to build unity and cohesion of the movement.

Mashatile's address brimmed with optimism, but he acknowledged that there were &quot;immense challenges&quot; ahead.

&quot;We are realising the vision of the Freedom Charter. We are making an even better Gauteng.

&quot;We know that there are immense challenges ahead; we know that many of our people have yet to feel the benefits of economic growth and social delivery,&quot; he said.

He called on branches to tackle the concerns raised by communities during service delivery protests that have erupted around the province recently.

&quot;We call on all our communities to work with the ANC to address these problems. However, we must condemn and distance ourselves from the use of violence in protests.&quot;

Mashatile, who is also a member of the South African Communist Party (SACP), thanked the leaders of the alliance -- the SACP, and the Congress of South African Trade Unions -- for their contribution to the conference.

Mashatile's address was his first as provincial chairperson. His previous deployments in provincial government include: transport and public works, safety and security, housing and his current position as finance and economic affairs.

He paid tribute to his predecessors, including current ANC secretary general Kgalema Mothlante, Sexwale, Mathole Motshekga and current premier Mbhazima Shilowa.

Mashatile's audience broke into song when he concluded his address singing &quot;Mashatile, my chairperson&quot; in chorus while he was congratulated and embraced by Shilowa.

Delegates scrambled to the stage to be photographed with him once proceedings had been officially closed.

On Sunday, provincial housing minister Nomvula Mokonyane was elected deputy chairperson, David Makhura was re-elected, unopposed, as provincial secretary, Mandla Nkomfe as deputy secretary and Lindiwe Maseko as treasurer. - Sapa

3.2 Disputed cash earns SACP group interest

Renée Bonorchis, Editor at Large, Business Day, 10 October 2007

ACCORDING to interest rates over the past 16 months, the lobby group led by South African Communist Party (SACP) head Blade Nzimande could have made more than R30000 in interest off the money that the Banking Association of SA accidentally paid into its coffers.

Despite requests for a meeting to discuss the R360000 that was paid into the Financial Sector Campaign Coalition's account, the two parties have not yet met.

Cas Coovadia, MD of the Banking Association, seemed hesitant when asked yesterday if the meeting was being put off by the Financial Sector Campaign Coalition, but then said he did not know why they had not met.

The issue of the money started in June last year when the Banking Association inadvertently paid its quarterly fees of R360000 to the Financial Sector Campaign Coalition, instead of the Financial Sector Charter Council. Their abbreviations are both FSCC and Coovadia said that a member of his staff had &quot;pressed the wrong button&quot;.

The SACP-led Financial Sector Campaign Coalition lobbies against high banking fees and high mortgages, while the Financial Sector Charter Council is responsible for the financial sector's empowerment charter and represents many of the organisations targeted by the political party in its campaigns.

Coovadia said yesterday the association would only consider legal action once it had met with the Financial Sector Campaign Coalition.

3.3 'We did not join the struggle to be poor'

Cape Times, 10 October 2007

ANC Youth League leader Fikile Mbalula hijacked the stage at a ceremony on Tuesday to commemorate the late ANC stalwart Oliver Tambo, lambasting former deputy president Jacob Zuma's opponents in the race for the party presidency.

Taking the stage following a speech by former Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda, Mbalula thanked the ageing statesman - and then turned his attention to Zuma's detractors.

To loud cheers from the audience, including members of the South African Students' Congress (Sasco), Mbalula said: &quot;We don't want people to think leadership is a golden opportunity and a fashion.&quot;

He took a swipe at ANC spokesperson Smuts Ngonyama - a known backer of President Thabo Mbeki - who once was apparently quoted as saying that he did not join the struggle to be poor.

&quot;We did not join the struggle to be poor,&quot; Mbalula said.

&quot;Neither did we join the struggle to be rich, or forget about the poor.&quot;

He also aimed a thinly-veiled verbal slap at ANC chairperson Mosiuoa Lekota, who recently criticised Zuma supporters for singing the politician's trademark struggle song Umshini Wam' (Bring me my machine gun).

Lekota in September defended his statements by saying that the criticism was about ANC policy and that liberation songs were &quot;not pop songs which we sing for personal entertainment here and there&quot;.

But Mbalula said: &quot;Whether you sing Umshini Wam' (or not), you have a right to choose songs. There is no ombudsman of freedom songs in this country.&quot;

Mbalula and the Youth League in September vowed to stick by Zuma even if new criminal charges were brought against him. He said the organisation was &quot;not a copycat&quot;.

&quot;We are not intending to run a revolution for replacing the leadership at Limpopo, but what we will be doing would be introducing fresh blood.&quot;

4 NPA/Scorpions

4.1 Probe scorpions' operations - SACP

Sowetan, 10 October 2007

The SACP has called for an investigation into the Scorpions mode of operation and the relationship the unit has with the police.

The call comes amid reports that Scorpions officials had developed a plan that would undermine the move to have the unit integrated into the police.

The party also wants a speedy conclusion to the inquiry into the suspension of National Prosecution Authority director Vusi Pikoli.

Former national assembly speaker Frene Ginwala is heading the inquiry.

But the party had previously expressed concern about Ginwala heading the inquiry.

It said a judicial officer was more suitable for the role because Ginwala was an ANC member.

4.2 Sting in Selebi saga

Eric Naki, Sowetan, 10 October 2007

Judicial issues stir up hornet's nest, writes Eric Naki

The saga regarding the issuing of arrest and seizure warrants against national Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi will serve to further polarise the tripartite alliance in the run-up to the December ANC national conference.

In not so many words, Cosatu has already expressed concern about the issuing of the warrants against Selebi as the reason for President Thabo Mbeki suspending National Director of Public Prosecutions, Vusi Pikoli.

After a central executive committee (CEC) meeting, Cosatu is not at ease with what it termed a &quot;constitutional crisis&quot; presented by the Pikoli affair.

But Cosatu's statement seems to be premised on its belief that the Scorpions or state apparatuses are being used for individual political ends. This renders the labour federation's &quot;constitutional crisis&quot; argument irrelevant because it took the matter from the wrong end of the stick.

It becomes a constitutional crisis when the executive directly interferes with the judiciary's administration of justice.

If Mbeki and/or Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development Brigitte Mabandla had a hand in the withdrawal of the warrants, then the independence of the judiciary would surely have been compromised.

Our Constitution makes the separation of powers between the three spheres - the executive, the legislature and the judiciary - quite clear.

The nature of the executive/legislature relationship is such that the laws drafted by the executive have to be scrutinised and passed by the legislature.

This leaves the two spheres close to each other - to the extent of interfering in one another's affairs.

Also because parliament is dominated by the ruling party, whose parliamentarians include members of the executive, it often adopts a &quot;caucused position&quot; on a particular issue before it is tabled in the legislature.

This effectively blurs the line between the two spheres.

While the legislature has an oversight function over the executive and is therefore able to interfere in their work and vice versa, the situation is different with the judiciary.

The independence of the judiciary is supposed to be sacrosanct.

In a statement after the CEC meeting, Cosatu expressed concern about reports that Pikoli was suspended because he issued warrants against Selebi.

&quot;If these allegations are true then we face a major constitutional crisis in the country and this would be a vindication of what we have always believed,&quot; said Cosatu.

&quot;Now that it has been officially confirmed that indeed a warrant for Selebi was obtained on September 14 from the Witwatersrand deputy judge president, our worst fears have been confirmed and Cosatu believes we have a serious crisis.&quot;

The trade union body has been calling for the activities of the National Prosecuting Authority to be reviewed. This after the NPA charged Jacob Zuma for allegedly raping a daughter of a family friend and, currently, while it is probing possible charges of corruption against him.

A lot can be expected to come out of the proceedings of the Frene Ginwala inquiry into whether Pikoli was fit to hold office.

Of grave concern are rumours that the elite Scorpions unit is actually manipulated by white former apartheid-era securocrats intent on undermining the ANC government.

The same white officials were said to be feeding Pikoli with information that would pit him against Selebi or the Scorpions against the SAPS to justify the continued existence of the Scorpions separately from the police service.

The allegations against the Scorpions make sense because should they be part of the police, they will have their wings clipped and find themselves working alongside the police fraud units and reporting to Selebi.

Pikoli will have to answer to Ginwala as to whether in wanting to arrest Selebi for his alleged underworld shenanigans, he was not pursuing his personal vendetta and that of his white officials while he let prime crime suspects such as Glenn Agliotti off the hook. He will have to tell the commission whether his plea- bargaining arrangement with high-profile crime suspects put national security at stake.

A few months ago, we questioned the rationale behind plea- bargaining arrangements between the NPA and apartheid- era police minister Adriaan Vlok, his former police commissioner Johan van der Merwe and three officers who poisoned the then anti-apartheid activist Frank Chikane, now director-general of the Presidency.

We asked which fish the NPA was hoping to catch by opting for the five to be given lighter suspended sentences instead of being jailed for their confessed crimes?

We expressed the sentiment that plea bargaining as it is applied currently has become a mockery of the very justice which the NPA is supposed to pursue.

The public is asked: Is it fair to release eight men in order to catch one big fish in the case of Selebi and Agliotti. Is it good to release five men in order to catch an unidentified giant fish in the case of Vlok and others?

This is one side of the coin in the Pikoli suspension saga.

The other side is the hyped Mbeki or Mabandla involvement in stopping the warrant against Selebi. Judges and magistrates are usually wary of being manipulated by the executive in their judicial duties.

One would say that before a warrant is issued, the presiding officer scrutinises the evidence presented to him and the applicant has to justify why such a warrant has to be granted. The judge or magistrate decides on the basis of evidence before him.

The question then is whether national security, as implied by the terms of reference of the Ginwala Commission, overrides the decisions of judicial officials.

Ideally it should not, because the evidence was presented to that officer who had to pass his judgment based on it.

But there is another dimension to this. Sipho Seepe, a political analyst, said yesterday a warrant can be reversed if the prosecuting authority approached the magistrate or judge again with convincing evidence for the warrant to be withdrawn.

&quot;This is not new, it's the court that decides whether to withdraw the warrant provided additional information is presented to persuade the magistrate or judge to reconsider his earlier decision to issue the warrant,&quot; Seepe said.

&quot;It does happen sometimes to avoid a miscarriage of justice, especially in high-profile cases.&quot;

4.3 Mpshe: I'll stand up to Mbeki

Citizen, 10 October 2007

Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions Mokotedi Mpshe said he would charge National Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi if needed - even if it meant standing up to President Thabo Mbeki.

He gave the assurance in a recorded 3rd Degree interview aired on TV last night.

Mpshe also claimed there was no attempt on the part of Mbeki to intervene in the Selebi matter and it was a &quot;mere coincidence&quot; that a review of the case against Mbeki's friend Selebi was his sole focus.

&quot;The President never even said the name Selebi to me,&quot; he said.

Mpshe could not explain how Mbeki knew details of the Selebi investigation - and witness deals made by suspended NPA chief Vusi Pikoli - if there was a breakdown in communication and working relationship with Pikoli.

As for the future of the Selebi investigation, Mpshe said he and a panel of four legal experts would review the case against Selebi.

In the meantime he suggested Selebi step aside.

&quot;It will be advisable,&quot; he said.

Addressing the matter of the much disputed Selebi arrest warrant, Mpshe said he did not want to undermine the integrity of the Judge who signed the warrant by having it canceled. As for the search and seizure warrants he is no longer pressing for their cancelation as they will expire if not acted upon.

Selebi's office yesterday rejected claims that police regulations require he be suspended as he was not being investigated by the police, but by the NPA.

5 South Africa

5.1 Cosatu slams state interest rates policy

Sowetan, 10 October 2007

The Reserve Bank's policy of raising interest rates has had a disastrous impact on South Africans, the Congress of SA Trade Unions said yesterday.

Spokesman Patrick Craven said the union was urgently appealing to the governor, Tito Mboweni, and his Monetary Policy Committee not to impose any further increases in base lending rates.

An increase was expected to be decided on this week.

&quot;Cosatu is convinced the policy of raising interest rates has had a disastrous impact.

&quot;It has directly contributed to slowing down the rate of economic growth, job creation and poverty alleviation,&quot; he said.

The policy was also jeopardising government's Asgisa target of halving the 2004 levels of unemployment and poverty by 2014.

The manufacturing sector had been particularly hard pressed . The mining, wholesale, retail and hospitality sectors had also been affected, he said.

The government's inflation targeting policy was &quot;based on the false belief that inflation and excessive consumer spending, rather than unemployment and poverty, are the major problems we face&quot;. - Sapa

5.2 In SA, 40% living below poverty line - Langa

Latoya Newman, The Mercury, 10 October 2007

South Africa has one of the most unequal distributions of income and wealth in the world.

This is according to Chief Justice Pius Langa, speaking at a lecture at the University of KwaZulu-Natal's Howard College campus on Tuesday.

He said: &quot;We have only recently emerged from the oppressive and immoral apartheid regime. Nevertheless, even today in our new dispensation, the ugly scars of systematic racial domination remain evident in unequal distribution of wealth; in the differing degrees of literacy and education; in the difference of infant mortality rates; in different standards of living.&quot;

Citing many examples of how the Constitutional Court protected equality and rights, including the famous KwaZulu-Natal nose-stud case, Langa said it was not just up to the Constitutional Court to ensure equality for the people of South Africa.

&quot;The constitution can only be what we make of it. It describes the dream but it does not create it,&quot; he said.

The fact that only &quot;a handful&quot; of socio-economic cases had reached the Constitutional Court was a concern.

&quot;In a country in which more than 40 percent of the people live below the poverty line, one would expect an incredible flow of applications made to the courts of people asserting their rights,&quot; he said.

Langa complimented the work of civil society movements for bringing cases to the the court's attention.

A student asked what Langa's thoughts were on comments that the suspension of Vusi Pikoli and the arrest warrant for Selebi had thrown South Africa into a constitutional crisis. He replied: &quot;It is for my court to say if there is a constitutional crisis. We haven't said it yet.&quot;

5.3 Big bucks for black skills

Gershwin Wanneburg, Fin24, 10 October 2007

More than half of South African companies find it difficult to retain black executives, a new study on Tuesday showed.

More than a third complained about poaching by companies vying for blacks, who regularly changed jobs in search of better pay.

According to the study, by consultancy firm Deloitte, South African executives' basic salaries rose by more than 7% in the past year as companies tried to hold onto skilled labour, in particular a small pool of black professionals.

The increases were just above the current rate of inflation but higher than companies had expected they would need to pay to prevent a high turnover, Deloitte said.

Average staff turnover among companies surveyed between August 2006 and July this year eased to 10.5%, from 13.5%. But resignations among local CEOs reached record levels, in line with a global trend, the annual survey found.

The staff crisis in the financial and manufacturing sectors - two of the economy's biggest - poses a challenge for the government as it tries to upgrade skills and counter a brain drain that has seen white professionals leave for overseas.

&quot;Although participants had predicted average increases of between 6% and 7% in a guaranteed package, the increases that were actually awarded were higher than anticipated,&quot; said Louise Marx, manager for Human Capital at Deloitte.

&quot;Once again, market forces dictated that adjustments and premiums were required to attract and retain top talent. Predictions for 2007/2008 are that executive guaranteed package increases will range between 7.0% and 8.0%,&quot; she said in a statement.

South Africa's annual CPIX inflation - which breached the central bank's 3-6% target range for the first time in April this year - slowed to 6.3% in August from 6.5% in July.

Government's push for economy

The government is spending billions of dollars on electricity and transport networks in order to create jobs and upgrade infrastructure needed to stimulate the economy. But the expertise to realise those goals is in short supply.

Experienced white professionals have left in droves to escape high levels of crime and affirmative action policies that have made it more difficult for them to find jobs. Analysts also say post-apartheid South Africa is struggling to produce an educated class among the black majority.

That poses a dilemma for authorities who are pushing companies to appoint more blacks to senior positions through affirmative action policies.

As a result, salaries may continue to rise at a rapid rate.

South Africa's central bank has warned about the inflationary impact of hefty raises. Deloitte said a massive strike by civil servants earlier this year created pressure for wage hikes in other sectors.

5.4 SA no magnet for talent, and little better at nurturing it

Mariam Isa, Business Day, 10 October 2007

SA RANKS lowest among 30 countries around the world in terms of attracting skilled people, a trend that does not bode well for the economy, a new global survey has found.

The government has identified a gaping skills shortage as a constraint to faster economic growth, with the shortfall also curbing job creation, keeping the official jobless rate stuck at 25,5%.

&quot;To deal with unemployment you need to drive the country into aggressive growth and you can't do that without talent,&quot; said Derick Boshard, senior partner at executive search firm Heidrick and Struggles in Johannesburg.

&quot;Being ranked last in the survey when it comes to attracting talent from the local talent pool is a very serious problem, especially when countries higher up the ladder are continuing to suck our own talent out of the country.&quot;

In terms of nurturing and developing talent overall, SA ranked 24th in the index compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit and Heidrick and Struggles, an international company.

The survey predicted SA would rise to 23rd place by 2012, overtaking Brazil and staying ahead of Egypt, Turkey, Nigeria, Iran, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.

But it said SA would still languish at the bottom in terms of its ability to attract talent, based on research into technical skills of the workforce, disposable income per capita, employment growth and economic growth.

SA's overall ranking was boosted by its position at 12th place in terms of inflows of foreign direct investment - which is set to climb to fifth by 2012.

SA's economy has grown about 5% over each of the past three years - its fastest in more than a quarter of a century - but job creation has lagged, rising just 3% in the 12 months to June this year, official data show .

Poor education has been cited as one of the main stumbling blocks to skills development, though SA spends more on this area than many other countries - about 6% of its gross domestic product (GDP).

&quot;The quality of education in SA is not good at the moment and will decline in the next five years,&quot; Boshard said. &quot;Less than 2% of learners achieve higher grade mathematics - that is inadequate for this country.&quot;

The study ranked SA 16th in terms of compulsory education and 27th for its universities and business schools.

The Global Talent Index also measured demographics, the quality of the environment to nurture talent, and a country's ability to attract talent.

5.5 Cruikshank house for sale in quest for Fidentia millions

Chantelle Benjamin, Chief Reporter, Business Day, 10 October 2007

THE upmarket Ruimsig, Johannesburg, home of Angus Cruikshank , whose company, Ovation, was allegedly used to launder money for Fidentia, goes on auction at the end of the month in the latest bid to recover R1,4bn owed to Fidentia creditors.

It is believed most of the money that went via Fidentia to either Ovation or Cruikshank's companies came from the Living Hands Trust, or the orphans and widows fund, as it is better known. Fidentia curators have to queue with 17000 investors in Ovation Global Investment Services and its trust company Ovation Global Investment nominees who are owed R271,4m.

Fidentia curators Dines Gihwala and George Papadakis are in pursuit of the R24,8m they say former Fidentia boss J Arthur Brown owes personally. On Monday they issued summons against Brown for payment of the R11,5m they say was misappropriated from Fidentia and used to buy two Cape Town properties. They also issued summons against Brown to sequestrate his estate.

The civil case against Brown follows the Cape High Court's dismissal last month of an application by curators to confiscate the Cape Town properties valued at about R20m.

In the absence of proper financial records it became a case of the curators' word against Brown's as to how the homes were paid for. Brown said the money came from Fidentia but was owed to him.

Gihwala said yesterday the curators now had the proof they needed. &quot;Let him come to court, and we can discuss it there.&quot; It was decided they would have more success with witnesses called to the stand to testify.

In the summons issued against Brown this week, curators are asking for the R11m, plus 15,5% interest a year, they claim Brown misappropriated in June 2003, when he gave permission as director of Fidentia Holdings for money for two Cape properties to be paid out of its bank account.

The money for the properties, bought for R5,3m and R5,9m, was never repaid by the SL Brown Family Trust and the CAM Brown Family Trust.

Curators of Cruikshank's estate are trying to trace more than R200m missing from Ovation and asset management company Common Cents. Fidentia is alleged to have paid at least R63m to Ovation and Cruikshank's other companies, money believed to have been taken from the Living Hands Trust.

Ovation Global, 75% owned by Cruikshank's estate, and 25% owned by Fidentia, operated out of Fidentia's offices in Cape Town. Cruikshank committed suicide last year, allegedly taking rat poison, after the theft of the money was discovered by the Financial Services Board. His estate was sequestrated in April at the request of Fidentia curators.

6.1 Developing countries need WTO: Cosatu

SABC, 9 October 2007

Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi says developing countries still need the World Trade Organisation (WTO) despite being failed by the organisation several times before.

Speaking at the South African Institute of International Affairs' conference on the WTO and industrial policy, Vavi uncharacteristically heaped praises on the South African government's position in the Doha round of talks. Vavi says it was exemplary and principled.

South Africa, together with other developing countries such as India and Brazil, has in the past resisted accepting the Doha round terms, arguing that the high tariff cuts demanded by developed countries were &quot;too radical&quot;. Under the proposed conditions developing countries will need to massively reduce their tariffs on strategically important sectors such as textiles and clothing, automobile and fabricated metals.

Trade experts have warned that the proposed tariffs cuts would undermine the country's recently launched industrial policy strategy. The strategy pins its hopes on growing and protecting some of the sectors identified within the Doha round. Cosatu says the WTO talks have not been a total failure.

6.2 Rich nations threaten jobs in Africa - Vavi

Hans Pienaar, Cape Times, 10 October 2007

If the world's rich countries have their way in key trade talks in the coming months, eventually &quot;we shall all have to dance around in our skins and collect shillings from delighted tourists&quot;, says Cosatu Secretary-General Zwelinzima Vavi.

Vavi spoke at a SA Institute for International Relations seminar on industrial markets and world trade talks at Wits University in Johannesburg.

Attempts are being made to revive the current round of World Trade Organisation talks and Europe is pressing blocs of developing countries to accept &quot;economic partnerships&quot; by the end of 2007.

Vavi slammed the media for not paying more attention to issues arising from these developments, which critics say are attempts by Europe and the US to keep African countries locked into being mainly providers of raw materials.

The current round of WTO talks started out as a development round after anti-globalisation demonstrations scuttled a key meeting in Seattle in 1999. But, says Vavi, development of the rest of the world is now bottom of the agenda.

&quot;We are absolutely convinced that a number of governments, particularly from the EU, together with the US, are paying lip service to a development commitment.&quot;

Vavi says the danger is that decisions taken now under pressure from rich countries will not easily be undone in the future.

Countries that transgress WTO rules or deals risk international sanctions.

At stake for SA, he claims, are hundreds of thousands of jobs. As things stand now, &quot;unfair&quot; demands by the rich countries &quot;will have a devastating effect on employment in SA and will seriously restrict SA's capacity to industrialise and move up the value chain&quot;.

Central to the WTO talks are liberalisation measures in a wide range of economic sectors. Vavi quoted from studies that such measures in industrial sectors &quot;will further drive down wages of workers&quot;.

Throwing open markets will let in &quot;the sharks and they will swallow the small fishes that we are trying to breed with BEE&quot;.

In the long run, industry will die out in South Africa and be replaced by services to distribute products from rich countries.

6.3 ZIMBABWE: Schools close as hordes of teachers resign

UN IRIN. 9 October 2007

A South African recruitment drive for teachers, combined with an exodus of education professionals escaping Zimbabwe's seven-year recession, is creating staff shortages so severe that some schools are closing.

At least four schools have closed and several more are facing the same situation. The students are being transferred at a time when they are preparing to write their year-end examinations, placing even greater pressure on the recipient schools.

Teacher's salaries have not kept pace with Zimbabwe's official inflation rate of more than 6,000 percent, while neighbouring South Africa has embarked on a recruitment drive for teachers in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) to bolster their own teacher numbers.

Firoz Patel, director-general for planning and monitoring in South Africa's education department, has reportedly said they were seeking to recruit at least 4,000 mathematics and science teachers from the region by April 2008. The department had already recruited 1,500 teachers, who were being deployed to posts in remote areas, often shunned by local teachers.

The Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ), the biggest grouping of educators in the country, said this week that 15,200 teachers had migrated to neighbouring states, such as South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland, since the beginning of 2007.

Raymond Majongwe, secretary-general of PTUZ, confirmed that the mass exodus of teachers was forcing schools to close, while many institutions were operating with a skeleton teaching staff.

&quot;There are two schools in Matabeleland North [Province] which have shut down as a result of teacher shortages, while in Matabeleland South [Province] there are reports that one headmaster was forced to close down the school after all the teachers left,&quot; Majongwe told IRIN. He said 8,000 teachers had left Zimbabwe after the first term, while another 7,200 left after the second term.

Teacher exodus

&quot;There has been a mass exodus of teachers ... the situation this term is worse because, in the last two weeks alone, hundreds of teachers resigned en masse and the figures of teachers who have now left the country could be double those of the beginning of the year. We are still compiling the statistics,&quot; Majongwe said.
Last week, Inyathi High School in Matabeleland South Province transferred its students to nearby Gloag High School after all the science teachers resigned, while Lumene Primary School, in the same district, failed to open for the third term when none of the teachers arrived for duty. Other schools that have failed to open in Matabeleland South are Chibila Primary in Binga, Sizinda and Gundwane Primary School.

Zipora Mudenda, Acting Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education and Culture, confirmed that teachers had resigned but said she was unaware of any schools closing as a result of staff shortages.

&quot;As far as we are concerned all schools have been operational, and if there are such cases of schools not being opened or closing down, this has not been brought to our attention - and in such cases the education directors are supposed to staff those schools with relief teachers,&quot; Mudenda said.

She conceded there was a brain drain affecting the education profession, and said the ministry was implementing a skills-retention fund in a bid to retain teachers, but the initiative was dismissed by the PTUZ.

&quot;The government has not done anything to retain teachers. The retention fee of Z$200,000 (US$0.40 at the parallel market rate of Z$500,000 to US$1) a month is a joke, and teachers will continue to leave until government gets serious,&quot; Majongwe told IRIN.

Final year exams

The staffing shortages at schools have become a serious concern for the parents of school-going children, who are about to start writing their final year exams.

&quot;Since the beginning of the term the students have not been learning anything due to a shortage of teachers, and the situation is made worse by the fact that the government has embarked on an exercise to recruit untrained teachers to fill the gaps,&quot; Martha Tshuma told IRIN. Her child attends Sobukhazi Secondary School in the high-density suburb of Mzilikazi in Zimbabwe's second city, Bulawayo.

Students in many schools in and around Bulawayo, interviewed by IRIN, said most teachers at their schools were untrained relief teachers. &quot;Right now all teachers at school are temporary teachers, and they do not seem to be in charge, as they are confused by a lot of things in our syllabi,&quot; said a final-year student who declined to be named.

Majongwe said the government was using relief teachers, but this was not a solution and was compromising education standards in a country once widely regarded as setting some of the best educational standards in Africa after Zimbabwe won its independence from Britain in 1980.

Last week 25 teachers resigned from Kuwadzana High School in the capital, Harare, while at Mzilikazi High School, in Bulawayo, 20 teachers resigned, Majongwe said.

Hyperinflation has played havoc with teachers' salaries of about Z$5 million (US$10) per month. A promise by the ZANU-PF government that salaries would increase to Z$15 million (US$30) has been dismissed as nothing more than a perpetuation of poverty wages.
