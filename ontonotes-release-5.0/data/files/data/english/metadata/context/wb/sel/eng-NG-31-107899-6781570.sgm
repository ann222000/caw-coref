In case anyone would like to hear it, I have put up
a recording of the sounds found on my rear upstairs deck,
as recorded through two NT1-A's, directly into the Tascam.

I did this with full gain, using the low cut filter
to reduce wind noise, and with the limiter engaged.
The limiter that wouldn't have affected this portion of the
30 minute recording, because the level was much lower
before I normalized and trimmed this segment.
