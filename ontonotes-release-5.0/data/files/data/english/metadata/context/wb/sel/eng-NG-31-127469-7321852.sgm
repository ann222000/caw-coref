Make friends with the angels, who though invisible are always with you. Often
invoke them, constantly praise them, and make good use of their help and
assistance in all your temporal and spiritual affairs.
~ Saint Francis de Sales

April 7th - Saint Juliana of Mt. Cornillon, Visionary
(1193-1258)

Saint Juliana was born near Liege, Belgium in 1193. At the age of five she
lost her parents and was placed in the convent of Mt. Cornillon near Liege.
She made rapid progress in virtue, and read with pleasure the writings of
Saint Augustine and Saint Bernard. She also cultivated an ardent love of the
Blessed Virgin and the Sacred Passion, but especially of the Blessed
Sacrament of the Altar. In 1206 she received the veil and devoted herself to
the sick in the hospital associated with the convent.

Taught in repeated visions that Our Lord wanted a feast in honor of the
institution of the most precious heritage of the Eucharist, after twenty
years in which her humility protested the investiture of such a mission, she
addressed herself to many dignitaries to obtain their opinion. The unanimous
decision was that nothing in the divine law was opposed to the establishment
of a special feast in honor of the Blessed Sacrament.

But soon opposition arose to her proposed feast of Corpus Christi. Although
in 1230 she was chosen as Superior of her community, she was accused of
being a visionary, and she became the object of harsh persecution by a man
who had secured his position as overlord of the community by intrigues and
bribery. He aroused the neighboring populations against her, and she was
obliged to leave the region. Later she was vindicated in the courts through
the influence of the Bishop of Liege; her persecutor was deposed, and she
was restored to her position in the community.

In 1246 the same bishop ordered that the Feast of the Blessed Sacrament be
celebrated every year on the Thursday after the octave of the Trinity.
Nonetheless, after the death of the worthy bishop, the furious persecutor
was reinstated in 1247 and succeeded once more in driving out the Saint. She
passed the last years of her life in seclusion at Namur, and was buried in
1258 at Villiers.

It was Pope Urban IV, formerly archdeacon at Liege, who in 1264, formally
instituted this feast day for the entire Church; it was he also who had
commissioned Saint Thomas Aquinas to prepare the magnificent text of the
Office and Mass. The Pope wrote to the friend and associate of Saint
Juliana, a Sister-recluse who had continued her efforts to obtain the
request of the Lord: "May this day bring to all Christians the joy of a new
feast and be celebrated with great joy, as We recommend fully in the
Apostolic Letter We are sending to the entire world." In 1312 the Council of
Vienna confirmed the papal bull, and from that time on, the feast day became
general.

Reflection. Saint Juliana never ceased to hope in the help of God amid the
most cruel persecutions. In effect, His clearly expressed Will was
accomplished only after her death. Let us learn from her patience to
practice the holy virtue of hope, and to rely on the divine aid for all that
is pleasing to Him.

Quote
"O ye souls who wish to go on with so much safety and consolation, if you
knew how pleasing to God is suffering, and how much it helps in acquiring
other good things, you would never seek consolation in anything; but you
would rather look upon it as a great happiness to bear the Cross after the
Lord"
-St. John of the Cross

Blessed William the Abbot saw, one night in a dream, some angels who were
weaving a crown of marvelous richness and beauty; and when he asked them for
whom they were making it, they said that it was for him, and would be
finished when he had suffered enough.

Bible Quote
47 Wherefore I say to thee: Many sins are forgiven her, because she hath
loved much. But to whom less is forgiven, he loveth less.  (Luke 7:47)

A PRAYER FOR THE DYING AND A SPECIAL SOUL

O MOST MERCIFUL JESUS, lover of souls,
I beseech Thee, by the agony of Thy most Sacred Heart,
and by the sorrows of Thine Immaculate Mother,
wash clean in Thy Blood the sinners of the whole world
who are to die this day.

Remember most especially the soul I spiritually adopt
with the intention of entrusting him or her to Thy Shepherd's care:
I beseech Thee for the grace to move this sinner, who is in
danger of going to Hell, to repent. I ask this because of my
trust in Thy great mercy.

If it should please Thy Majesty to send me a suffering this day
in exchange for the grace I ask for this soul, then, it, too,
shall please me very much, and I thank Thee, Most Sweet Jesus,
Shepherd and Lover of Souls; I thank Thee for this
opportunity to give mercy in thanksgiving for all the mercies
Thou hast shown me. Amen.

Heart of Jesus, once in agony, have mercy on the dying.
