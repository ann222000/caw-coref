Do you like to pamper your dog? Well let her stand out from the crowd
wearing one of these fantastic harmony balls. These unique items are
little sterling silver harmony balls (pendants) that can be attracted
to your dogs collar and when moved it makes a wonderful chime sound.
It has a center chime ball (bell) that is surrounded by very intricate
Bali silver work. The detail and craftsmanship that has been put into
these exquisite chiming pendants is just stunning. We import these
harmony balls directly from Bali, Indonesia where they are handcrafted
by experienced silversmiths and are of the highest quality. Because
each one is handcrafted there may be a slight difference in size and
oxidation.

The 17mm harmony balls would work best for your precious friend. There
are quite a few styles to choose from and they are only $15.

Yes.  Yes, I do.  However, I do not buy stuff from vendors who spam
Usenet.  Sorry!

ObDogs (or, at least, dog walking):  These are another dog walking
find from back when Elliott was a wee bairn.  I'd taken him down to
the river for an off-leash romp, and he nosed out a pile of bones for
me (well, he thought they might be for him, but we quickly sorted out
the issue of ownership).  They were lying just off the path.  They're
too dense to be from a bird, so I'm guessing they used to belong to a
cat or fox or 'possum.  They're wonderfully smooth and make a
satisfying clink when tapped together.

I've also got one jaw bone (with teeth) and some pieces of the
pelvis.
