Was Saddam a threat? The Middle East was more peaceful with him in power.
There were fewer attacks in Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, etc. If Saddam
was funding so many suicide bombers, why didn't he fund the 9/11 attacks? And,
why have the number of attacks on Israel increased since his removal? Like
weapons of mass destruction, was this another excuse to invade Iraq for oil?

Of course the world is better of without Saddam. I can name a bunch of
others as well. The question is whether or not Saddam should have been an
immediate target and whether the consequences are worth it.

Iraq is a stepping stone to take out Iran and Syria. Like it or not we have
no choice but to over throw these terrorist supporting governments.

I am surprised at the question because the answer is so obvious. Yes the
world is better off without Saddam and especially his sons.

Of course he was a threat and of course the world was better off without
him. The Middle East has long been a powderkeg. After the cold war, many
people felt the world had somehow become a safer place, in reality the
instability in the Middle East was presenting tremendous risk for conflict,
albeit small scale and spread out, rather than a global event.

The only difference is that the world attention is now focused on the area,
due to the Iraq war. If you look at the history of Israel, you will find a
cycle of increasing and decreasing violence, the current increase is just
another upswing which would have happened with or without the Iraq war.

I hesitate to state this last point, but I can't help myself. The us never
recieved a large portion of oil from Iraq. We lived without their oil for
the past decade. For the cost of the war we could have bought Iraqi oil, at
twice the price, for the next several decades. Claiming the war is about
oil is just a liberalist sound bite with no basis in any fact.

The Mid East has been a big problem for the last 2000 years ! At least !
It was the most volatile province of Rome. Tiberius Cesar told Ponchess
Pilot that if there was a third revolt under his administration he would
have Pilot executed !

Having said this I do think that the Middle East can't touch off WW III
which could have happened when the Soviet Union was in business.

I can't agree it has NO basis in fact. The oil lobby (George Bush's
friends) certainly put in their two cents. But I agree that oil was not the
primary motivation for the invasion of Iraq.

I hope people have read the NY Times piece on Bush's &quot;certitude&quot; that stems
from his LITERAL belief that he is carrying out God's will. God save us
from religious zealots.

180,000 Iraqi's buried in a single mass grave is hardly peaceful. 300 - 400
bodies of women and children uncoverd just last week is only a hint of the
100's of thousands of Iraqi's that were murdered and slaughtered.

Saddam paid $25,000 to each Palestinanian family for suicide bombers. To
believe the world was better off with Saddam is insane. Wake up!!!

Nobody is saying that. The world would be better off without Kim Jung Il
and a lot of other people as well.

The question is whether we should have gone to war against Iraq when we
did...without giving the weapon's inspectors more time, without the backing
of some of our major allies in the United Nations, without having finished
the job in Afghanistan, totally suppressing the Taliban and capturing Osama,
without enough troops, without enough body armor or armored troop carriers,
without an adequate plan for administering Iraq post-war, without sealing

You are debating the wrong issue.

A decade is not enough? You really think a few more months would have done

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You mean like France, Germany, and Russia? The same three nations that were
using the Oil For Food program to benefit themselves while at the same time
giving Saddam everything HE, but not his people, needed? This was how
Saddam was, in effect, able to get around the sanctions. The sanctions had
no affect on Saddam thanks to the UN Oil For Food program. Also, France,
Germany, and Russia gave Saddam time to restart work on his WMD programs by
dragging out the weapons inspections and other such &quot;diplomatic efforts&quot;.
They also gave Saddam a promise to prevent the US from attacking him by
voting against the US in the UN Security Council. President Bush saw
through all this and called the UN's bluff. And don't forget, the UN
security council passed over a dozen resolutions condemning Iraq between the
first and second &quot;Gulf Wars&quot;. They never had any intention of enforcing any
of them. And even if they did, the US would've been the main enforcer! Not
to mention the countless ways Saddam violated the terms of the first Gulf
War cease fire agreement, any of which gives the US the right to go to war
again.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;without having finished the job in Afghanistan, totally suppressing the
&gt;Taliban and capturing Osama&lt;

"/>

What kind of troops carried out the invasion of Iraq? It was primarily the
3rd Infantry Division, which is made up of units equipped with weapons like
the M1A1 Abrams main battle tank and Bradley fighting vehicles. How
effective do you think they would've been in the mountains of Tora Bora?
The answer is not effective at all. The job of capturing Osama requires
lighter forces that can operate in mountainous terrain, like special ops
troops. Very few if any forces were diverted from Afghanistan to Iraq. The
3rd and 4th ID weren't in Afghanistan, and they're the ones doing the job in
Iraq. It may be true that we don't have enough forces in Iraq, but that's
not the President's fault. It was democrats like Bill Clinton and John
F'ing Kerry that stripped and gutted the armed forces of the US. I know
because I've been in the military for 13 years and I've seen it with my own
eyes. And do you really believe Kerry wants to add 2 more active divisions
to the Army? His record doesn't suggest he has any intention of doing so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;without enough body armor or armored troop carriers&lt;

Again, it was Clinton and Kerry that caused these problems with they're
massive cuts to the budget of the armed forces.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/>

The original plan for the invasion of Iraq was to have the 3rd ID move
towards Baghdad from the south, while at the same time, the 4th ID was to
move towards Baghdad from the north from Turkey. This probably would've
kept a great many Iraqi fighters from being able to get away into the Sunni
triangle, take off their uniforms, and come back as &quot;insurgents&quot;. But of
course Turkey, after it was too late to change plans or call off the
invasion, decided not to allow the US to go through their country, which
really changed the dynamics of the invasion. The original plan most likely
would've made the administration of post-war Iraq go more smoothly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;without sealing the borders&lt;

Iraq is about the same size as California. Imagine trying to fight battles
in three or four cities like L.A., Sacramento, Oakland, or San Francisco at
the same time AND sealing the border at the same time. How many troops do
you think that would take? A lot more than the US could possibly produce.
The whole idea of &quot;sealing the borders&quot; and fighting the battles is
impossible.

Actually, it's Clinton who rebuilt the military. As Dick Cheney
himself has said:

&quot;A commander in chief leads the military built by those who came
before him. There is little that he or his defense secretary can do to
improve the force that they have to deploy. It is all the work of
previous administrations. Decisions made today shape the force of
tomorrow.&quot;

Who built the smart bombs?

Clinton did.

10% PGMs in the first gulf war. More than 70% in the second. Do you
think Bush built them? Nope.

I respect your service Musclegirl, and I'm sure you know more about
every aspect of combat on the ground, but I worked for several years
through those administrations covering military programmatics and
spending, and Clinton may have cut budgets after the cold war when we
no longer needed a million tanks (as you yourself pointed out, they're
not very useful in many of the kinds of wars we need to fight now) or
air to air combat aircraft, but the money he did spend was well spent.

If you agree with the quote, then Bush is leading the military built by
Clinton. According to Kerry and the libs of today, we don't have enough
forces and they're not properly equipped. Therefore, it's Clinton and the
libs fault. Sure, Clinton helped arm the military with technologically
advanced weapons, but some tasks require ground forces, boots on the ground,
and Clinton cut the number of boots dramatically. That's why Kerry now says
he wants to add two divisions. But in reality, Kerry is just continuing to
say whatever he thinks he needs to to get elected.

&gt;&gt;really changed the dynamics of the invasion. The original plan most
&gt;&gt;likely
&gt;&gt;would've made the administration of post-war Iraq go more smoothly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;without sealing the borders&lt;

&gt;&gt;Iraq is about the same size as California. Imagine trying to fight
&gt;&gt;battles
&gt;&gt;in three or four cities like L.A., Sacramento, Oakland, or San Francisco
&gt;&gt;at
&gt;&gt;the same time AND sealing the border at the same time. How many troops do
&gt;&gt;you think that would take? A lot more than the US could possibly produce.
&gt;&gt;The whole idea of &quot;sealing the borders&quot; and fighting the battles is
&gt;&gt;impossible.

Bush is the president prior to Kerry, not Clinton. The army that Kerry
would inherit is the one that Bush has drained so badly and not
replenished.

If we need more boots on the ground, why hasn't Bush done anything to
increase the number of boots? Bush's own people keep saying we have
plenty of troops, and plenty on the ground. Can't have it both ways.
Or could it be that bush is only saying what he thinks he needs to say
to get reelected too?

&gt;If you agree with the quote, then Bush is leading the military built by

&gt;libs fault. Sure, Clinton helped arm the military with technologically
&gt;advanced weapons, but some tasks require ground forces, boots on the ground,
&gt;and Clinton cut the number of boots dramatically. That's why Kerry now says
&gt;he wants to add two divisions. But in reality, Kerry is just continuing to
&gt;say whatever he thinks he needs to to get elected.

&gt;&gt; Actually, it's Clinton who rebuilt the military. As Dick Cheney
&gt;&gt; himself has said:

&gt;&gt;&quot;A commander in chief leads the military built by those who came
&gt;&gt; before him. There is little that he or his defense secretary can do to
&gt;&gt; improve the force that they have to deploy. It is all the work of
&gt;&gt; previous administrations. Decisions made today shape the force of
&gt;&gt; tomorrow.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Who built the smart bombs?

&gt;&gt; Clinton did.

&gt;&gt; 10% PGMs in the first gulf war. More than 70% in the second. Do you
&gt;&gt; think Bush built them? Nope.

&gt;&gt; I respect your service Musclegirl, and I'm sure you know more about
&gt;&gt; every aspect of combat on the ground, but I worked for several years
&gt;&gt; through those administrations covering military programmatics and
&gt;&gt; spending, and Clinton may have cut budgets after the cold war when we
&gt;&gt; no longer needed a million tanks (as you yourself pointed out, they're
&gt;&gt; not very useful in many of the kinds of wars we need to fight now) or
&gt;&gt; air to air combat aircraft, but the money he did spend was well spent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without giving the weapon's inspectors more time&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;A decade is not enough? You really think a few more months would have
&gt;&gt;&gt;done
&gt;&gt;&gt;it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without the backing of some of our major allies in the United Nations&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;You mean like France, Germany, and Russia? The same three nations that
&gt;&gt;&gt;were
&gt;&gt;&gt;using the Oil For Food program to benefit themselves while at the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;time
&gt;&gt;&gt;giving Saddam everything HE, but not his people, needed? This was how
&gt;&gt;&gt;Saddam was, in effect, able to get around the sanctions. The sanctions
&gt;&gt;&gt;had
&gt;&gt;&gt;no affect on Saddam thanks to the UN Oil For Food program. Also, France,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Germany, and Russia gave Saddam time to restart work on his WMD programs
&gt;&gt;&gt;by
&gt;&gt;&gt;dragging out the weapons inspections and other such &quot;diplomatic efforts&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;They also gave Saddam a promise to prevent the US from attacking him by
&gt;&gt;&gt;voting against the US in the UN Security Council. President Bush saw
&gt;&gt;&gt;through all this and called the UN's bluff. And don't forget, the UN
&gt;&gt;&gt;security council passed over a dozen resolutions condemning Iraq between
&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;first and second &quot;Gulf Wars&quot;. They never had any intention of enforcing
&gt;&gt;&gt;any
&gt;&gt;&gt;of them. And even if they did, the US would've been the main enforcer!
&gt;&gt;&gt;Not
&gt;&gt;&gt;to mention the countless ways Saddam violated the terms of the first Gulf
&gt;&gt;&gt;War cease fire agreement, any of which gives the US the right to go to war
&gt;&gt;&gt;again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without having finished the job in Afghanistan, totally suppressing the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Taliban and capturing Osama&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;What kind of troops carried out the invasion of Iraq? It was primarily
&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;3rd Infantry Division, which is made up of units equipped with weapons
&gt;&gt;&gt;like
&gt;&gt;&gt;the M1A1 Abrams main battle tank and Bradley fighting vehicles. How
&gt;&gt;&gt;effective do you think they would've been in the mountains of Tora Bora?
&gt;&gt;&gt;The answer is not effective at all. The job of capturing Osama requires
&gt;&gt;&gt;lighter forces that can operate in mountainous terrain, like special ops
&gt;&gt;&gt;troops. Very few if any forces were diverted from Afghanistan to Iraq.
&gt;&gt;&gt;The
&gt;&gt;&gt;3rd and 4th ID weren't in Afghanistan, and they're the ones doing the job
&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;Iraq. It may be true that we don't have enough forces in Iraq, but that's
&gt;&gt;&gt;not the President's fault. It was democrats like Bill Clinton and John
&gt;&gt;&gt;F'ing Kerry that stripped and gutted the armed forces of the US. I know
&gt;&gt;&gt;because I've been in the military for 13 years and I've seen it with my
&gt;&gt;&gt;own
&gt;&gt;&gt;eyes. And do you really believe Kerry wants to add 2 more active
&gt;&gt;&gt;divisions
&gt;&gt;&gt;to the Army? His record doesn't suggest he has any intention of doing so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without enough body armor or armored troop carriers&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Again, it was Clinton and Kerry that caused these problems with they're
&gt;&gt;&gt;massive cuts to the budget of the armed forces.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without an adequate plan for administering Iraq post-war&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;The original plan for the invasion of Iraq was to have the 3rd ID move
&gt;&gt;&gt;towards Baghdad from the south, while at the same time, the 4th ID was to
&gt;&gt;&gt;move towards Baghdad from the north from Turkey. This probably would've
&gt;&gt;&gt;kept a great many Iraqi fighters from being able to get away into the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Sunni
&gt;&gt;&gt;triangle, take off their uniforms, and come back as &quot;insurgents&quot;. But of
&gt;&gt;&gt;course Turkey, after it was too late to change plans or call off the
&gt;&gt;&gt;invasion, decided not to allow the US to go through their country, which
&gt;&gt;&gt;really changed the dynamics of the invasion. The original plan most
&gt;&gt;&gt;likely
