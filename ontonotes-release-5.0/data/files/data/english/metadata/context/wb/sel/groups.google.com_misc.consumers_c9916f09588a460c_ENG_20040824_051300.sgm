When I came across this article, it made my blood boil. The HOA
in this lady's neighborhood seized her home, valued at $150,000,
which she paid off, because she owed the HOA $814.50!. She didn't
even get a single penny in the difference between what she owed,

$5,000!
This is why nobody should ever buy any property that has a HOA

PRESS RELEASE
From the Office of State Senator Jon Lindsay

For Immediate Release
May 3, 2001

Senator Jon Lindsay Files Legislation to Prevent Homeowner Tragedy
from
Occurring in the Future

Senator Jon Lindsay today filed three Senate Bills which would give
homeowners some protection against the foreclosure powers held by
homeowner
associations. The bills were filed in response to the eviction and
foreclosure of the home of 82-year-old widow Wenonah Blevins, by the
Champions Community Improvement Association in Harris County, as
reported in
the May 2nd and 3rd editions of The Houston Chronicle.

Senator Lindsay said, &quot;This is a sad and outrageous tragedy for Ms.
Blevins
that should not have happened and should never happen again. Homeowner
associations hold far too much power for an organization that is not a
governmental entity. Most homeowners entrust their association to
regulate
and maintain the appearance of the subdivision, much like a garden
club.
What they may not understand is that unlike the garden club, when you
fail
to pay your dues they can take your home away.&quot;

Under present law, a homeowners association may take legal action
against a
homeowner who falls behind in their dues and fees or fails to pay
fines for
covenant violations. In practice, the association puts the home on the
auction block seeking only to raise enough money to pay for the
arrearage
and any court costs and attorney fees. In the case of Ms. Blevins, her
home
was already paid off. Although it was worth $150,000, the auction sale
price
came in at $5,000 which paid for her $814.50 debt.

Senate Bill 1834, filed today by Lindsay, would make the association
think
twice about such blatant disregard for fairness by requiring them to
reimburse the property owner the difference between the auction price
and
the appraised value of the home. Senate Bill 1835 makes homesteads
exempt
from seizure due to non-payment of homeowners association maintenance
fees.
Associations could still place liens on residences in order to enforce
their
deed restrictions. And, finally, SJR 53, a constitutional amendment
which
would require voter approval, states that a home may not be subject to
a
forced sale for maintenance dues owned to a homeowners association.
Although
only introduced this morning, these bills have been set for a Senate
hearing
this afternoon.

&quot;According to the Chronicle article, Ms. Blevins actually attempted to
pay
her debt to the association last year, but they decided not to cash
her
check and followed through with legal proceedings. Even more
shockingly, the
association actually bid $4,200 on her home. Should this legislation
pass, I
think associations will think twice before arrogantly flaunting their
power
and disregarding the people they are supposed to serve,&quot; said Senator
Lindsay. &quot;Ms. Blevins paid $150,000 for an $800 debt and that is just
not
right. I never want to see this sort of thing happen again.&quot;

&gt;PRESS RELEASE
&gt;From the Office of State Senator Jon Lindsay

&gt;For Immediate Release
&gt; --- snipped a lot ---

"/> Yes, I lived in Houston when it was on the news. In metro Houston,
it's hard not to buy into a neighborhood without a HOA unless you go
farther out. As I recall the house was sold at foreclosure to a
questionable type investor (tho legal in this case) and eventually due
to A LOT of political pressure she was able to repurchase her house
back. I don't recall all the details but because of her, Texas passed
a new law to stop this kind of abuse. Perhaps someone else can fill
in the details about the law passed, etc.. .

Every HOA that I've been a member of just files liens against the

cases sometimes do). Your outrage is not a good reason to boycott HOAs.

Excerpts from  http://www.ccfj.net/Txforeclscam3.html
-----------------------------
With a stunned grin and a $300,000 lawsuit victory, the suburban Houston
widow whose eviction in April became a rallying point for homeowners'
rights got her house back Friday.
&quot;Thrilled, delighted, glad to be back home,&quot; Wenonah Blevins, 83, said
after placing a plastic Christmas wreath on her front door and a red bow
on her mailbox.

Her homecoming was made possible by an out-of-court settlement of her
lawsuit. She lived with a friend during months of legal wrangling with
her homeowners association and the investor who paid $5,000 at auction
for her $150,000 ranch-style home.

------------------------------

After Blevins' eviction, the Legislature passed a bill limiting the
powers of homeowners associations -- but not preventing them from
foreclosing on houses whose owners owe fees. Blevins' state senator, Jon
Lindsay, failed to win passage of a bill that would have protected her
retroactively.

I live in the Houston area and recall when this happened. Of course
everyone said what terrible awful thing to do. Home Owners Associations
Associations shouldn't have this kind of power, etc.

I was at a party where quite a few local realtors attended and was told the
woman in question was given every opportunity to pay the dues and she
refused any number of times to pay even though she had the money to fulfill
her obligation. By the time she agreed to pay it was too late. She did get
her home back along with a nice settlement.

Excerpt from  http://www.ccfj.net/Txforeclscam4.htm

An elderly woman's neighbors who successfully fought a homeowners
association for the return of her foreclosed home filed a class-action
lawsuit Tuesday accusing the association of overcharging them on
maintenance fees for about 15 years.
About 100 longtime residents of the Champions East subdivision on FM
1960 allege Champions Community Improvement Association may have
overcharged them by perhaps $1 million, said their attorney, Marian
Rosen.

&quot;While we were researching Mrs. (Wenonah) Blevins' case, we discovered
the association had violated its own bylaws,&quot; Rosen said.

In 1987, she said, the association increased maintenance fees from $72
to $400 annually.

The lawsuit said the association's amended Maintenance Fund bylaws filed
in 1965 stated fees would not exceed $72 per year through 1996.

Reforms are definitely needed. In our state, a bill was passed
eliminating non-judicial lien executions (a court hearing is required)
and there is a state ombudsman that has power to overrule capricious
and nasty HOA officials.
Personally, I won't live in those communistic places, the loss of
freedom is not worth the increase in orderliness to me.-Jitney

http://www.window.state.tx.us/taxinfo/proptax/ptaxbill.html

Q: If I'm elderly or disabled and can't pay my taxes, will the taxing
units sell my house and put me on the street for not paying my taxes?

A: If you are 65 or older or disabled, you may defer or postpone paying
any current or delinquent property taxes on your home for as long as you
own and live in it. To postpone tax payments, you must file a tax
deferral affidavit with the appraisal district. You may suspend any
lawsuit by filing an affidavit with the court. Or you may suspend a
pending sale to foreclose on the homestead's tax lien, if you file for
the abatement up to five days before the date of the sale. The deferral
is for all delinquent property taxes owed taxing units that tax the
home.

A tax deferral only postpones paying taxes. It doesn't cancel them.
Interest is added at the rate of 8 percent a year. Once the owner no
longer owns the home or lives in it, past taxes and interest become due.
Any penalty and interest that was due on the tax bill for the home
before the tax deferral will remain on the property and also become due
when the tax deferral ends. After the tax deferral ends and the taxes
remain unpaid, the taxing units may add attorney fees on the 181st day
after the deferral and pursue tax collectionsit, past taxes and interest
become due. Any penalty and interest that was due on the tax bill for
the home before the tax deferral will remain on the property and also
become due when the tax deferral ends. After the tax deferral ends and
the taxes remain unpaid, the taxing units may add attorney fees on the
91st day after the deferral and pursue tax collections.

"/> In many areas, in a brand-new subdivision, the developer can build the HOA
into the subdivision process, with membership included as a covenant on the
deed. There have been numerous previous threads on all this, but I don't
care enough to Google for them. Usually in the HOA incorporation or charter
documents, there is some defined 'tipping point' at which the developer can
grab his hat and hit the door, and they are responsible for their own
ongoing finances at that point. And yes, in some localities, the local
government tags the HOA to be responsible for things like plowing, street
repair, etc. This amounts to a bribe to get the subdivision zoning approved.
I have seen threads on here describing the legal swamp that ensues when an
HOA goes bankrupt and the local govt has to take over the services. The
local govt unit then back-bills the dead HOA, and the liability flows back
to the property owners. People can end up updside-down due to sudden huge
liens and attachments on their property.

the HOA building a parking lot at the end of the block and putting Jersey

Actually, that's not always true. Sometimes these gangs change the
rules AFTER you buy in. California, for instance, didn't allow HOAs
to steal homes with impunity until around 1984 or so.

There's quite an interesting history of the growing racket around
foreclosures of HOA homes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; HOAs should be outlawed, period. How they are formed is a red herring,
&gt;as
&gt;&gt;&gt; they should be illegal. -Dave

&gt;&gt; Because you say so? Please show some native intelligence. Don't buy
&gt;&gt; into a property governed by an HOA if you don't want to. For some of
&gt;&gt; us, HOAs provide useful services.

&gt;People in jail get useful services like free medical care and free meals.
&gt;Only an idiot would say an HOA is good because it provides useful services.
&gt;The cost is way too high. -Dave

"/> People in jail don't have a choice about being there (except that they
should have not committed the crime in the first place). People who
belong to a HOA belong because they either bought knowing there was a
HOA in place, or consented to join an HOA(*). And if they don't like
the way the HOA is run, they can sell to somebody else. Or run for
the board themselves.

(*) Except for a few states like TX that allow forming HOAs by a
(non-unanimous) vote of owners in a given area.

Yes, there are some horrible, tyrannical HOAs. I read about them in
the paper almost every Sunday. HOAs whose boards think they are
(not-so-)little tin gods and run the HOA for their own benefit. HOAs
that ignore the applicable laws (e.g., Davis-Sterling act in CA) and
their own governing documents.

But even in those cases, the dissatisfied homeowner can
1) hire a lawyer and sue
b) run in opposition to the board (using a lawyer if necessary to
pry the names and addresses of other owners so they can send their
campaign statements)
c) sell out.

Look, if you want to paint your house puce and use your patio for
storage, buy a detached house with no HOA, and you can do pretty much
what you please (subject to local laws which can sometimes be almost
as tyrannical). But for a lot of people, the constraints of living in
a HOA are _less_ than the benefits.

To take an extreme example, my mother lives in an &quot;assisted living&quot;
facility. You can think of that as like an HOA with a bunch of
additional services (and rules). If she bugs the other residents, they
can give her 30 days notice to get out.

But she gets 3 meals a day. Somebody comes along and cleans the room
and makes the bed once a day. Somebody else comes up and reminds her
to put on clean clothing (she's getting a little forgetful). The
health-care aid makes sure she takes her pills at the right times
every day.

Suggestion: instead of thinking of a HOA as being like owning your own
home except with a bunch of rules (and fees), think of it as sort of
an intermediate between renting an apartment and owning a home.

When you rent, you have to live with the rules set by the landlord.
How loud you can be, what you can put on your balcony, even whether
and where you can hang pictures on the walls. Your rent can go up at
any time (or as soon as your lease expires, rarely longer than 2
years) and/or you can be asked to move on 30 days notice (except rent
controlled cities), and even there you can be asked to move under
certain circumstances like if the landlord wants to move in a
relative). But if the toilet stops up or the dishwasher stops working
or the heater goes out in the middle of the night, you can call the
landlord and (usually) get it fixed. You never paint anything (unless
you want to and get the landlord's permission). No lawns to mow, no
gardens to weed, no garage door repairs.

If you live in a detached house, you can paint your house any color
you like. You can put whatever you want in _your_ pool or on _your_
patio. And when the roof leaks, _you_ get to call in somebody to fix
it. When the paint starts to fade, _you_ get to re-paint or pay
somebody to do it. _You_ need to mow the lawn and weed the gardens,
or pay somebody to do it. But your &quot;rent&quot; payments are pretty much
fixed(+) except for property taxes, which are much smaller than rent.

(+) except ARMs.

Living in an HOA is sort of in between. If the roof leaks, you tell
the board (or the management company) and they take care of it. They
keep the lawns and gardens and pools maintained. You pay a fee for
this, less than rent but a lot more than property taxes. And your fee
can go up, but usually by a limited amount. And if you pay the fee
(the same as or proportional to everybody else in the HOA), they can't
tell you to move. But you're still responsible for everything
_inside_ your home. If the toilet stops up or the dishwasher breaks,
_you_ call the repairman and pay him. And you have some limitations
on what you can do with the outside -- what color you can paint your
house/townhouse, what you can put on your patio/balcony, etc. If
there's a pool, you probably share it with other people just as you
would if you lived in an apt.

Looked at that way, an HOA isn't necessarily bad. It's just
different.

Oh, btw, I live in a detached home. I would never live in an HOA
unless I get to the point where I can't take care of a house. But I
don't think everybody else has to have the same priorities as I do.

&gt; Now, going back to HOAs, they most certainly do NOT mow your lawn. They

"/> Condos / townhomes are also managed by HOAs. HOAs cover the gamut from
condos to attached townhomes to single family detached townhomes to single
family homes. They can vary greatly among what is covered.

We live in a townhome (separate entrance for each unit, but four units per
building). Yes, the HOA takes care the lawn and the snowplowing (and yes,
the roofs and outside siding and structure -- we've made a few roof repairs,
mostly shingles that blew off, roof vents that came off during really bad
storms). The HOA (managed, in this case, by a management company) makes the
payment on those bills, but the homeowner actually pays for the services in
the way of monthly fees. It always irks me when someone says the
association pays for such and such -- the homeowners ARE the association are
are the ultimate payers, even though they don't write out the check to the
vendor. Also covered in the monthly fees is the sewer and water, since they
are not provided or metered seperately; and insurance, which is getting
pricey for multi-family homes.

It would be my choice to NOT live within an HOA if I had any kind of single
family home or single family detached townhome -- however, in the case of
multi-family buildings, where there is lots of common area in terms of
yards, external structure and roof, I don't know what other option there
would be than an association.

I'm a member of two HOAs, one for a condo I own, another for a single
family dwelling.

In my situation, the roofs for both the condo and the home are
maintained by the HOA. Both have roof funds for eventual roof
replacement. If a leak is reported promptly, the condo HOA is even
responsible for fixing interior damage (i.e., sheetrock), as it was
_their_ roof that leaked - the roof is legally considered a &quot;common
element.&quot;

Both HOAs mow my lawns. One is communal condo property, one is _my_
property. They do the rest of the landscaping, too - something I have
no time for.

Not all HOAs are the same. Not all are evil. Some are better than
others. Buy property carefully.

reasonable people, as are the residents, the great majority of whom

Our HOA dues pay for the security service and maintenance of the common
areas. In the last 30 years we've only had to take action against one
person who put up a 10 foot tall perimeter fence that blocked a
neighbor's view of the water. In the few rare cases where a homeowner
didn't (or couldn't) pay their HOA dues, we just put a lien on their
property that was settled when the property eventually sold.

Some people may think this is anal behavior, but in our resident's
opinion you'd be hard pressed to find a nicer place to live. Our
10-year crime rate is near zero and our home values are the highest in
the county. If only idiots live here then that is just fine with us.

land underneath in fee simple (in other words, IT'S NOT A CONDO), as

under builder control at this point and is managed by a management
company, has what amounts to an easement to do yardwork and routine
exterior maintenance (painting, power washing, etc. -- but NOT roof or
deck work, which remains the responsibility of homeowners), and
provide water and sewer service for the homeowners. Homeowners buy
regular homeowners' policies at premiums comparable to what one would
pay for HO coverage on a single-family home of equal value; the HOA's
policies only cover common infrastructure (streets and shared parking
areas, mailboxes, gate, etc.) We do have the usual CC&amp;Rs regarding
paint colors and so on; I was provided a copy of the CC&amp;Rs well before
closing (actually, before putting down earnest money) and didn't see
anything at all bothersome or egregious. To me this is a very

&gt; WHAT increase in orderliness? HOAs cause major headaches with NO benefits

"/> No benefits? Increased property values is a huge benefit. I prefer to make
few tradeoffs to keep my neighbors from doing things that lower property
values. These include parking cars on lawns, letting yards grow wild, chain
link fences, outlandish house colors that don't go with the architecture,
and a host of other problems that can crop up if you live in a non-HOA
neighborhood. Even the best non-HOA neighborhood can be ruined by one
homeowner with no respect for their property or that of others.

Your best best is to either move into a well established (like 30 years or
older) neighborhood with a great track record and pray no lunatics move in,
or buy in a neighborhood with a reasonable HOA.

One example of what can happen without an HOA--my dad's street was very
nice, with well kept homes and lawns. One homeowner moved away and
purposely sold his home to a mental health service that managed group homes
(he was mad at his neighbors and also a very big a-hole). This doesn't
sound like a huge problem on the surface, and in fact the residents of the
home were not a problem. However, the employees were. Speeding down the
street, allowing the residents to escape and wander the neighborhood peeing
on people's property (my dad caught one guy doing this three times!), and
just basically being disrepectful. The company also let the exterior of the
home go to pot. It's a nightmare.

I'll stick with my HOA. Sure, there are some restrictive rules, but my
property values have skyrocketed compared to other neighborhoods without
them. And if I want wild paint colors I can do them inside.

use to mind their own business until people started building expensive homes
and now what to tell everyone their home isn't good enough to be in the
neighborhood. I bought my home for $48,000, the value has gone up $10,000
every year for the last five years.

We live in a country like subdivision. This is the reason why I bought my
property where I did....NO HOA and away from the more restrictive and
developed areas.
Now the newly developed HOA wants to put in street lights and sidewalks and
force everyone in the subdivision to pay for THEIR wants and and THEIR
needs........They do not support me, they do not pay my bills, they do not
live under my roof, they are not my family, they are not my friends, and
certainly are not my neighbors.

Due to Harris County lobbying attorney's, it seems that only 60% of the
subdivision is needed to start a mandatory association. However, it still
requires 75% of homeowners to change deed restrictions.

Georgia does not have rules for creating HOA's in existing neighborhoods, at
least I have never heard of it happening before. Its hard enough to keep one
together and much harder to create one in an existing neighborhood.

I will check on that question and let you know for sure.

I am currently challenging one in court. These association laws are
absolutely insane.
What in the hell inspires people to think they can you create a homeowners
association in a 30 year old neighborhood where very very tame deed
restrictions haven't been enforced for the last 19 years??? These people are
CRAZY!!!! They need to have their head examined by a shrink. If they want to
pay thousands of dollars to beautify the neighborhood and throw away their
money, more power to them, but I am not giving them a penny to support their
wants and needs. They seriously need to get a life and keep their nose out
of someone else's. My property value has increased substantially for the
last five years without deed restriction enforcements or any fricken idiots
telling me what to do. Anyone with a brain should know, real estate is all
about location, location and location.

"/> In most homeowner's associations, the association owns the buildings,
and the homeowners only own the interior of their unit. Some places
the owners own the land under their unit, and in some places they
do not. In these situations, the HOA is responsible for all outside
maintenance of both the grounds and the buildings, including roofs
and siding. Think condos and townhomes.

What you have is an association that covers the single family
homes in a subdivision where you own your own land and buildings.
This is very, very uncommon in much of the US, but it is common in
some areas, and it is growing rapidly. The problem is that one
bad home on a block can really impact the resale value of all the
other homes, so owners want some control over the neighbors to
insure the value of their own homes. Yes it is very big brotherish,
but people agree to it, often without having any clue of what they
are agreeing to. In this part of the US, homes that are built with
a HOA are often called &quot;detached townhomes&quot; or &quot;freestanding condos&quot;.

your house/fence, then maybe you shouldn't be in that community.

All the above reasoning, btw, applies to HOAs that are created by

Some states allow creating an HOA after the fact by a vote of some
percentage of the property owners in an area.

is: don't buy a house in TX.

currently there is simply no oversight of an HOA. A good board now can turn

community control of a group of condos or properties with a common
recreational area.. But single family homes with little or no common
property and no services provided by the HOA? Come on... These sorts of
things were setup by the builder and only benefit the management companies
and lawyers that live off the HOA assessments. The same groups that lobby
against protecting property rights of the home owner.

owners put a huge chunk of change down up front, they almost all owe
more than their homes are worth. No option to refinance... Even if I

I bought my home in foreclosure. I could refinance. Interest rates
have gone up, and I'd have to want to do so very badly. It's not
going to happen when you consider that the majority of home owners
won't be able to refinance. We'd have a better chance of convincing

to the management company, attoreys, and for very minor entryway

There is one very powerful thing that homeowners can do and that is to
attend meetings! BODs are reluctant to act with witnesses. Or offer to
serve on an open seat on the Board - there is always one available.

are, they do work towards maintaining/increasing the value of your

--------------------------------------------------

As bad as HOAs are, I am still waiting for the day when houses that are
not governed by HOAs sell for higher prices than are houses governed by
HOAs.
Until then, I think it's a bargain to buy low. If you buy high on hopes
of selling higher, you have to outrun the herd to sell higher than the
herd does.
I think better is buying low, even on a house whose value has
below-average prospects of price inflation. If you invest what you save
initially into a total USA stock market index mutual fund such as
Vanguard's &quot;Index Total&quot;, then you will probably be better off 20-30 years
or whatever into the future than if you speculated on having the place you
live in being &quot;hot property&quot; that long.
