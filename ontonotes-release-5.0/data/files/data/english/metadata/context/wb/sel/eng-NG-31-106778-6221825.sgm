Iraq's Christians Flee as Extremist Threat Worsens

By MICHAEL LUO

Published: October 17, 2006

BAGHDAD, Oct. 16 - The blackened shells of five cars still sit in front of
the Church of the Virgin Mary here, stark reminders of a bomb blast that
killed two people after a recent Sunday Mass.

An Iraqi family walked away from the site of a bomb blast in southern
Baghdad on Oct. 4.

In the northern city of Mosul, a priest from the Syriac Orthodox Church was
kidnapped last week. His church complied with his captors' demands and put
up posters denouncing recent comments made by the pope about Islam, but he
was killed anyway. The police found his beheaded body on Wednesday.

Muslim fury over Pope Benedict XVI's public reflections on Islam in Germany
a month ago - when he quoted a 14th-century Byzantine emperor as calling
Islam "evil and inhuman" - has subsided elsewhere, but repercussions
continue to reverberate in Iraq, bringing a new level of threat to an
already shrinking Christian population.

Several extremist groups threatened to kill all Christians unless the pope
apologized. Sunni and Shiite clerics united in the condemnation, calling the
comments an insult to Islam and the Prophet Muhammad. In Baghdad, many
churches canceled services after receiving threats. Some have not met since.

"After the pope's statement, people began to fear much more than before,"
said the Rev. Zayya Edward Khossaba, the pastor of the Church of the Virgin
Mary. "The actions by fanatics have increased against Christians."

Christianity took root here near the dawn of the faith 2,000 years ago,
making Iraq home to one of the world's oldest Christian communities. The
country is rich in biblical significance: scholars believe the Garden of
Eden described in Genesis was in Iraq; Abraham came from Ur of the Chaldees,
a city in Iraq; the city of Nineveh that the prophet Jonah visited after
being spit out by a giant fish was in Iraq.

Both Chaldean Catholics and Assyrian Christians, the country's largest
Christian sects, still pray in Aramaic, the language of Jesus.

They have long been a tiny minority amid a sea of Islamic faith. But under
Saddam Hussein, Iraq's million or so Christians for the most part coexisted
peacefully with Muslims, both the dominant Sunnis and the majority Shiites.

But since Mr. Hussein's ouster, their status here has become increasingly
uncertain, first because many Muslim Iraqis framed the American-led invasion
as a modern crusade against Islam, and second because Christians
traditionally run the country's liquor stories, anathema to many religious
Muslims.

Over the past three and a half years, Christians have been subjected to a
steady stream of church bombings, assassinations, kidnappings and
threatening letters slipped under their doors.

Estimates of the resulting Christian exodus vary from the tens of thousands
to more than 100,000, with most heading for Syria, Jordan and Turkey.

The number of Christians who remain is also uncertain. The last Iraqi
census, in 1987, counted 1.4 million Christians, but many left during the
1990's when sanctions squeezed the country. Yonadam Kanna, the lone
Christian member of the Iraqi Parliament, estimated the current Christian
population at roughly 800,000, or about 3 percent of the population. A
Chaldean Catholic auxiliary bishop, Andreos Abouna, told a

British charity over the summer that there were just 600,000 Christians
left, according to the Catholic News Service.

At the Church of the Virgin Mary, Father Khossaba showed a visitor the
baptism forms for parishioners leaving the country who need proof of their
religious affiliation for visas. Some weeks he has filled out 50 of the
forms, he said, and some weeks more.

Attendance on Sundays has dwindled to four dozen or so, he said; it used to
be more than 500 on average, and on Easter Sundays, before the collapse of
the Hussein government, more than 1,500. Not all the missing members have
left, of course; some simply stay at home on Sundays because of fears for
their safety.

Many Christians have relocated, changing neighborhoods or even cities. About
a thousand Christian families, from Mosul, Baghdad, Basra and elsewhere,
have taken refuge in Ain Kawa, a small town outside the Kurdish city of
Erbil, which has become an oasis for Christians, said the Rev. Yusuf Sabri,
a priest at St. Joseph's Chaldean Catholic Church there.

A Christian man with Baghdad license plates on his car who asked not to be
identified said he had just arrived in Ain Kawa to inquire about moving
there. A leaflet had been left at his home demanding he leave in three days.
It bore the signature of Muhammad's Army, a Sunni insurgent group.

"They regarded me as an agent for the crusaders," he said.

Wisam H. Habeeb and Khalid al-Ansary contributed reporting from Baghdad, and
an Iraqi employee of The New York Times from Mosul.
