Because there are so many other third-party news readers out there for Macs?

Yep, and when Apple stopped development of Claris Emailer, the top
Emailer software developers on that team quit Apple joined the
Microsoft Mac Business Unit to create Outlook Express for Mac. They
went straight to work adding all the features of Claris Emailer. Later
on, they released a completely re-written Mac-only replacement to
Outlook Express called Entourage that, for all intents and purposes, is
what Claris Emailer likely would have been if Apple had never stopped
development on it to begin with - plus all kinds of cool
enterprise-level Exchange support and so on. Entourage is one heck of a
Mac email client.

I'd start by saying that's two different questions.

1. Why didn't Apple bundle a Usenet client into their Mail app?

Because despite superficial similarities and a penchant by other vendors
for doing it, they're really distinct tasks that don't particularly
benefit from integration. In some ways, the integration provided by
other vendors has been a detriment to both the users and to the Usenet
communities involved.

2. Why didn't Apple develop a Usenet client, period?

Probably because it's frankly not a high-traffic medium for newer users.

I like to be able to copy the occasional message from Usenet to an IMAP
folder.  I also like my postings to be copied to an IMAP sent folder.
This is why I use Thunderbird for news which I consider an otherwise
terrible newsreader.  I may switch back to (al)pine one of these days.

I use Mail and alpine for mail, so I'm really just using Thunderbird for
news while making use of its ability to do IMAP.

They didn't see a need because there is no need to be seen.  If there is
any abstraction to be had in message transport, and I think there is,
the solution is to move upwards towards it and not laterally towards
email.

Yep - that would be *my* chief complaint with it too - although my
incremental backups have enough growth-room to handle it just fine.

As with most things, there are pros and cons. There's a trade-off in
that the built-in search mechanism in Entourage is quite speedy because
of that monolithic database, but now that there is Spotlight
integration, I think Microsoft would do well to consider abandoning
built-in search in favor of Spotlight and also considering moving to an
MBOX-based file format as well.

&gt; Yep - that would be *my* chief complaint with it too - although my
&gt; incremental backups have enough growth-room to handle it just fine.

&gt; As with most things, there are pros and cons. There's a trade-off in
&gt; that the built-in search mechanism in Entourage is quite speedy because
&gt; of that monolithic database, but now that there is Spotlight
&gt; integration, I think Microsoft would do well to consider abandoning
&gt; built-in search in favor of Spotlight and also considering moving to an
&gt; MBOX-based file format as well.
">

I read something from MacBU to the effect of Spotlight was able to
search their exposed data faster than their code could :-) OK, so
Spotlight was searching a different set of files etc, but it was an
interesting observation.

MBOX is a pretty stupid format. Because /^From $/ is the separator
between messages, it is difficult to have a line in mail that starts
with those characters.

Cheers,

Chris

That's irrational - Entourage is *not* Outlook, and is not even based
on Outlook code. Disliking Outlook (which is an entirely reasonable
decision :-) is no reason to dislike Entourage.

My personal and professional experience has led me to think the

Well, to be honest, it's not that I don't wish to share as much as it
is that, from all appearances, you've already got your mind made up,
and seem to be asking for someone to change your mind about it.  But
I've had a long week, and I'm just not in the mood to argue with
someone if they've already got their mind made up.  I'm sure you can

Which is why I was explicit, figuring that if that bug was or was not
shared, someone would tell me.

So I really don't know anything about Entourage.   I have no way of
determining which e-mail program to start off with.    (I suppose I
could create an e-mail account and use my wife's Entourage).

Changing the topic:

My wife never checks her .mac e-mail.   She doesn't want to worry
about multiple e-mail accounts.    Is it possible to integrate it with
her Mail account set up for Earthlink?

When we switched from DSL to Cable, she kept her Earthlink account at
$10/month for occasional dial-up (from her laptop), and so she
wouldn't have to change her e-mail address.

If she uses .mac's web email interface, there's an option in

If you have multiple inboxes than just collapse them (click on the
expansion little triangle thing so that it points right instead of down)
and then the pseudo folder named &quot;Inbox&quot; will have everything.

This is one of the many reasons why people shouldn't use the email
services provided by their ISPs.  You either have lock-in like this or
unwanted changes of email addresses.

I recommend fastmail.fm, but there are email service providers.  You can
also get your own domain name and have email forwarded to whatever
happens to be your current mail delivery point.

We'll see how often she uses the dial-up.   As free wireless becomes
