He is not claiming any connection, but, of course, everybody is related to
everybody somehow-----we may just not know how.
Still, as far as I know those Mortimers are extinct, also the male line
ancestors of that Roger appear to be without male line descendants,
legitimate or illegitimate.

&gt; Of course he could be descended from a different line and therefore be a

&gt; Some folks, erroneously, call that a &quot;COLLATERAL DESCENDENT&quot; of Roger.

Can you show Mortimer families who are not in the male line linked to Roger
Mortimer, but are related to Roger Mortimer in any way whatsoever?

The number of family names descending from this Roger Mortimer _always via
females_ is staggering.

For instance, if we stay with genealogists alone, Roger Mortimer is an
ancestor of :

Brice Clagett - J.W. Cummings -Ian Fettes - John Steele Gordon - Gordon R.
Hale Jr. - Tony Hoskins - Will Johnson - Malinda Jones - Peter de Loriol -
Sir Ian Moncreiffe - Brom Nichol Jr Merilyn Pedrick - Tim Powys-Lybbe - John
Ravilious - William Addams Reitwiesner - Gary Boyd Roberts - Walter Lee
Sheppard Jr -  Louise Staley

The enormous number of descendants of Roger Mortimer till the present may
well contain people with the Mortimer surname, but I haven't found any as
yet.

I didn't say Ian Mortimer had to be a descendant of THE Roger Mortimer
[1287-1330], 1st Earl of March, in order to have a bias and an ax to grind.

Although I am one of his descendants -- he's one of my 19th
Great-Grandfathers.

Millions of us have him for an ancestor.

Dear Peter,

I still haven't seen your message to which Spencer Hines is responding.

In what Ian Mortimer wrote for me to be included in the biography of Edward
II he had to remain brief. I have not seen his book but I am sure he quotes
sources. In what he wrote for me there is a mention of a papal notary's
narrative of Edward II's life up till 1336, several years after Edward's
supposed death.
It is a pity to wipe him off without consideration. Dr. Ian Mortimer is a
Hon. Fellow, Department of History, University of Exeter.

Best wishes

&gt;&gt; This looks like a furphy to me: there may be no genealogical

&gt;&gt; now, but that doesn't mean it is necessarily unconnected with his

&gt;&gt; People grow up with their surnames and often take a protective
&gt;&gt; attitude to namesakes before they know or even question whether or not
&gt;&gt; they are related.

&gt;&gt; Merely disclaiming any ulterior motive from kinship now doesn't cut
&gt;&gt; much mustard - this could just as well work the other way, with the
&gt;&gt; historian trying to make out that a famous ancestor was more colourful
&gt;&gt; and wicked than the evidence sustains.

You were talking about _related_ Mortimer lines-----and I presume you meant
Mortimers related to Roger Mortimer in any way----except male line
connections. I did not say it had to be Ian Mortimer's family. I too implied
Roger had many descendants and I even mentioned a few.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But there are RELATED Mortimer Lines.

&gt;&gt;&gt; DSH

&gt;&gt; Can you show Mortimer families who are not in the male line linked to
&gt;&gt; Roger Mortimer, but are related to Roger Mortimer in any way whatsoever?

&gt;&gt; The number of family names descending from this Roger Mortimer _always
&gt;&gt; via
&gt;&gt; females_ is staggering.

&gt;&gt; For instance, if we stay with genealogists alone, Roger Mortimer is an
&gt;&gt; ancestor of :

&gt;&gt; Brice Clagett - J.W. Cummings -Ian Fettes - John Steele Gordon - Gordon
&gt;&gt; R.
&gt;&gt; Hale Jr. - Tony Hoskins - Will Johnson - Malinda Jones - Peter de

&gt;&gt; John Ravilious - William Addams Reitwiesner - Gary Boyd Roberts - Walter
&gt;&gt; Lee Sheppard Jr -  Louise Staley

&gt;&gt; The enormous number of descendants of Roger Mortimer till the present may
&gt;&gt; well contain people with the Mortimer surname, but I haven't found any as
&gt;&gt; yet.

It's called the Fieschi letter because it was writen to Edward III by the papal notary Manuele Fieschi sometime in the 1330s

Mortimers do not need to be descendants of Roger Mortimer [1287-1330], 1st
Earl of March to be RELATED to him... OR just have the Mortimer surname and
not be ABLE to prove or disprove a given connection.

...But perhaps still have an ax to grind.

'Nuff Said.

I don't think people need to have the surname Mortimer to have an axe to
grind. It seems some keep on grinding and grinding, saying very little and
achieve even less.

Yes, Leo, you certainly prove that axiom in your post, infra.

You are still reading what you WANT to believe -- NOT what is written.

All flatulence and zero substance.

Why don't you trot out, CITE and QUOTE from this Papal Legate's Document
which you lamely OPINED about if you think you can PROVE something about the
Death of King Edward II of England.

Otherwise you are just bloviating, posturing...

...And clearly hoist with your own petar.

Substance? When was the last time it applied to Spencer Hines? How many
years was it that you  produced anything? Hot air, whinging, needling has
been your forte for too long..

You are still reading what you WANT to believe....NOT what is written. How
right you are. I have steered you to what Dr. Ian Mortimer has said, if you
want to know more, contact him. After all Will Johnson made it easier by
quoting to proper name of the document.

If you want an answer, you do the work----but then genealogical work has
been beyond you for many years.

Pity your much appreciatede absence has not improved you----go and have
another holiday, get rid of your bile-----become human.

This is not the first time you do not read what is written. Show me where I
said I _believe_ Edward II was not murdered in Berkeley Castle....
In research different opinions have the right to be heard and questioned.
Providing them does not mean I stand by one or the other.

Since when is Shakespeare a source for genealogy or history? Well, this
explains a lot.

You are still a waste of time, go and have your childish fun elsewhere.

_ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jtdirl/Archive_15#Fieschi_Letter_
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jtdirl/Archive_15#Fieschi_Letter )

Which I quote

In the name of the Lord, amen Those things that I have heard from the
confession of your father I have written with my own hand, and afterwards I have
taken care to be known to Your Highness.
First, he has said that, feeling England in subversion against him after the
threat from your mother, he departed from his followers in the castle of the
Earl Marshal by the sea, which is called Chepstow. Later, driven by fear, he
boarded a barque together with Lord Hugh Ie Despenser and the Earl of Arundel
and several others, and made his way by sea to Glamorgan on the coast. There
he  was captured, together with the said Lord Hugh and Master Robert Baldock,
and  they were taken by Lord Henry of Lancaster. And they led him to
Kenilworth  Castle, and the others were taken to various other places. And there, many
people demanding it, he lost the crown. Subsequently, you were crowned at
the  feast of Candlemas next following. Finally, they sent him to the castle of
Berkeley. Afterwards, the servant who was guarding him, after some little
time,  said to your father, 'Sire, Lord Thomas Gurney and Lord Simon Barford,
knights,  have come with the purpose of killing you. If it pleases you, I shall
give you  my clothes that you may better be able to escape.' Then, wearing the
said  clothes, at twilight, he went out of the prison. And when he had reached
the  last door without resistance, because he was not recognised, he found
the porter  sleeping, whom he quickly killed. And, having got the keys out of
the door, he  opened it and went out, with his keeper. The said knights who had
come to kill  him, seeing that he had thus fled, and fearing the indignation
of the Queen, for  fear of their lives, thought to put that aforesaid porter in
a chest, his heart  having been extracted and maliciously presented to the
Queen, as if they were  the heart and body of your father; and, as the body of
the King, the said porter  was buried at Gloucester. Afer he had escaped from
the prison of the aforesaid  castle, he was received at Corte Castle together
with his companion, who had  guarded him in prison, by Lord Thomas, the
castellan of the said castle, without  the knowledge of Lord John Maltravers, lord of
the said Thomas, in which castle  he remained secretly for a year and a half.
Afterwards, hearing that the Earl of  Kent, for maintaining that he was
alive, had been beheaded, he took a ship with  his said keeper and, with the
consent and counsel of the said Thomas, who had  received him, crossed into Ireland,
where he remained for nine months.  Afterwards, fearing lest he be recognised
there, and having taken the habit of a  hermit, he came back to England and
proceeded to the port of Sandwich, and in  the same habit crossed the sea to
Sluys.
Afterwards, he turned his steps in Normandy, and from Normandy, as many do,
crossing through Languedoc, he came to Avignon, where he gave a florin to a
Papal servant and sent, by the same servant, a note to Pope John. The Pope
summoned him and kept him secretly and honourably for more than fifteen days.
Finally, after various deliberations, all things having been considered, and
after receiving permission to depart, he went to Paris, and from Paris to
Brabant, and from Brabant to Cologne, so that, out of devotion, he might see the
[shrine of] the Three Kings. And, leaving Cologne, he crossed over Germany and
headed for Milan in Lombardy.
In Milan, he entered a certain hermitage in the castle of Milasci [Melazzo],
in which hermitage he remained for two and a half years; and because war
overran  the said castle, he moved to the castle of Cecima in another hermitage of
the  diocese of Pavia in Lombardy. And he remained in this last hermitage for
two  years or thereabouts, always the recluse, doing penance or praying God
for you  and other sinners. In testimony of which I have caused my seal to be
affixed for  the consideration of Your Highness.
Your Manuele de Fieschi, notary of the Lord Pope, your devoted  servant.

If you want to know something do some work for a change.
Do read what Will Johnson produced----unsupported? I think you need
supporters to keep you up.

I do not have to retreat in any form, if I supply what is said by others and
you want to know more, for a change, do some work yourself.

But work is not your style, needling making obvious what kind of person you
are is more your style. Now go and play with someone else,

-----------------------------------------------------------------

As throughout this exchange, if Leo wants to defend Manuele de Fieschi's
letter which was ostensibly written to curry the favor of Edward III, then
the Burden of Proof is on him.

But he demurs from doing that -- and runs for the tall grass.

No Surprises There...

Leo is a mere cataloguer and compiler of names and &quot;biographies&quot; of
historical figures with scant knowledge of how to parse, analyze and
critique said lists of names and factoids into a coherent historical
account.

Spencer get your knickers out of a knot.

Show where I give _my_ opinion about the death of Edxward II. If you can't,
shut up.

For a change do something positive, it has been years and years since you
have done that. Sniping and behaving like a prat is so much your style.

&gt; coast. There he was captured, together with the said Lord Hugh and Master
&gt; Robert Baldock, and they were taken by Lord Henry of Lancaster. And they
&gt; led
&gt; him to Kenilworth Castle, and the others were taken to various other
&gt; places.
&gt; And there, many people demanding it, he lost the crown. Subsequently, you
&gt; were crowned at the feast of Candlemas next following. Finally, they sent
&gt; him to the castle of Berkeley. Afterwards, the servant who was guarding
&gt; him,
&gt; after some little time, said to your father, 'Sire, Lord Thomas Gurney and
&gt; Lord Simon Barford, knights, have come with the purpose of killing you. If
&gt; it pleases you, I shall give you my clothes that you may better be able to
&gt; escape.' Then, wearing the said clothes, at twilight, he went out of the
&gt; prison. And when he had reached the last door without resistance, because
&gt; he
&gt; was not recognised, he found the porter sleeping, whom he quickly killed.
&gt; And, having got the keys out of the door, he opened it and went out, with
&gt; his keeper. The said knights who had come to kill him, seeing that he had
&gt; thus fled, and fearing the indignation of the Queen, for fear of their
&gt; lives, thought to put that aforesaid porter in a chest, his heart having
&gt; been extracted and maliciously presented to the Queen, as if they were the
&gt; heart and body of your father; and, as the body of the King, the said
&gt; porter
&gt; was buried at Gloucester. After he had escaped from the prison of the
&gt; aforesaid castle, he was received at Corte Castle together with his
&gt; companion, who had guarded him in prison, by Lord Thomas, the castellan of
&gt; the said castle, without the knowledge of Lord John Maltravers, lord of
&gt; the
&gt; said Thomas, in which castle he remained secretly for a year and a half.
&gt; Afterwards, hearing that the Earl of Kent, for maintaining that he was
&gt; alive, had been beheaded, he took a ship with his said keeper and, with
&gt; the
&gt; consent and counsel of the said Thomas, who had received him, crossed into
&gt; Ireland, where he remained for nine months. Afterwards, fearing lest he be
&gt; recognised there, and having taken the habit of a hermit, he came back to
&gt; England and proceeded to the port of Sandwich, and in the same habit
&gt; crossed
&gt; the sea to Sluys.

&gt; Afterwards, he turned his steps in Normandy, and from Normandy, as many
&gt; do,
&gt; crossing through Languedoc, he came to Avignon, where he gave a florin to
&gt; a
&gt; Papal servant and sent, by the same servant, a note to Pope John. The Pope
&gt; summoned him and kept him secretly and honourably for more than fifteen
&gt; days. Finally, after various deliberations, all things having been
&gt; considered, and after receiving permission to depart, he went to Paris,
&gt; and
&gt; from Paris to Brabant, and from Brabant to Cologne, so that, out of
&gt; devotion, he might see the [shrine of] the Three Kings. And, leaving
&gt; Cologne, he crossed over Germany and headed for Milan in Lombardy.

&gt; In Milan, he entered a certain hermitage in the castle of Milasci
&gt; [Melazzo],
&gt; in which hermitage he remained for two and a half years; and because war
&gt; overran the said castle, he moved to the castle of Cecima in another
&gt; hermitage of the diocese of Pavia in Lombardy. And he remained in this
&gt; last
&gt; hermitage for two years or thereabouts, always the recluse, doing penance
&gt; or
&gt; praying God for you and other sinners. In testimony of which I have caused
&gt; my seal to be affixed for the consideration of Your Highness.

&gt; Your Manuele de Fieschi, notary of the Lord Pope, your devoted servant.&quot;

&gt; As throughout this exchange, if Leo wants to defend Manuele de Fieschi's
&gt; letter which was ostensibly written to curry the favor of Edward III, then
&gt; the Burden of Proof is on him.

&gt; But he demurs from doing that -- and runs for the tall grass.

&gt; No Surprises There...

&gt; Leo is a mere cataloguer and compiler of names and &quot;biographies&quot; of
&gt; historical figures with scant knowledge of how to parse, analyze and
&gt; critique said lists of names and factoids into a coherent historical
&gt; account.

Leo,

Take a BIG, DEEP breath...

Then take two fingers of your favorite libation -- preferably alcoholic.

Followed by a LONG NAP.

You'll feel much better and have a Better Outlook On Life.

Instead of your boring childish behaviour, talk turkey for a change. Youy
say I have an opinion about the death of Edward II you disagree with. Show
us.
If you can't, get back into your bottle, preferable milk.

Dear Peter,

Many thanks for this. I always believe &quot;other&quot; possibilities should not be
ignored, not until it is properly and safely established that they are
wrong.
Thank goodness no longer do we hear about the possibility that Anna Anderson
is Anastasia.

I was in touch with Dr. Ian Mortimer a while ago, and he made it then clear
he knew he is not of the same Mortimer family.
Having said that, living on the same island as Roger Mortimer did hundreds
of years ago, who knows whether there are other genealogical
links----but he is not interested and doesn't want to know.

I think the historical Mortimer family is well and truly extinct in the male
line, but as so often is the case there are other, unrelated families with
the same surname.

With best wishes
Leo

&gt;&gt; Dear Brice,

&gt;&gt; On genealogics I have included Dr. Ian Mortimer's opinion in the
&gt;&gt; biography of Edward II. I don't think it is frivolous and at least should
&gt;&gt; be acknowledged.

&gt; Quite right, Leo - I think Mortimer is wrong, but it is certainly proper
&gt; to acknowledge the theory that used to be dismissed but which he &amp; some
&gt; others have been arguing for over the past 30 years.

&gt; It is also worth noting that unlike most supporters of the revisionist
&gt; idea he does not rely on the Fieschi letter: in his _English Historical
&gt; Review_ article of 2005 (cited by Brice at the start of this thread)
&gt; Mortimer states &quot;In determining whether Edward died in 1327 or not, the
&gt; Fieschi letter is a distraction&quot;.

&gt; That is practically the only point in his analysis on which I can agree
&gt; with him.

&gt; It should also be noted that Mortimer dedicated his 2003 biography of his
&gt; most famous namesake to his father &quot;who took me to Wigmore Castle as a
&gt; child...and always encouraged me to explore my fascination with the past&quot;.
&gt; He doesn't say when he learned - maybe not on the same childhood visit -
&gt; that there was no family connection.

&gt; Over the years he has clearly learned to identify emotionally, if not
&gt; genealogically, with the 1st earl of March, for instance asserting &quot;one
&gt; has to say that Roger's greatest crime was that he was not a member of the
&gt; royal family&quot; and &quot;There is no reason to doubt that Roger did love
&gt; Isabella deeply&quot;. Even more oddly, in Mills &amp; Boone mode, he suggests that
&gt; Isabella's burial in her wedding dress &quot;does not necessarily indicate she
&gt; turned from Roger's memory, for he may well have been in Edward's company
&gt; at the royal wedding in Boulogne, and thus would first have seen her in
&gt; this dress&quot;. He fails to note that she was also buried with Edward II's
&gt; heart, that presumably Roger dearest had never seen her with. Rum.
