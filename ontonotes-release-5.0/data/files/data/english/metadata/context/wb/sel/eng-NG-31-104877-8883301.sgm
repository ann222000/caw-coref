The Shakespeare Diaries:
A Fictional Biography
By J. P. Wearing
Santa Maria Press, 458pp, $59.95

IN Ulysses, James Joyce has a character say that Shakespeare is the
happy hunting ground of all minds that have lost their balance, and then
proceeds to write, in dialogue form, a shimmeringly histrionic homage to
what it might mean to think and talk about him. W.B. Yeats said that in
the eyes of Shakespeare the world must have seemed as empty as it seems
in the eyes of God.

It's not hard to see the truths that Irish extravagance might gesture
unto. Here we have four books that give us God's plenty of the madness
and the nothingness and what lies behind. We have a book about
Elizabethan registry records and pox treatments, a forensic account of
what Ann Hathaway might or might not have been up to, written by a great
feminist and prose stylist who also does a fine line in impersonations
of a parodic dry-as-dust scholar.

We have a book about Shakespeare's life (of which little is known) done
with dry economy and clarity of outline by comic travel writer Bill
Bryson, who in this case chooses to travel through time to give us a
glimpse, or feigns to, of the mask-like face of the greatest dramatist
in history, using the familiar ploy of writing about his times: you
know, bear-baiting, disembowelling and old Queen Bess.

Then there is Professor Wearing of the University of Arizona, who does
what even Joyce did not do (though his disciple Anthony Burgess had a go
at it in Nothing Like the Sun and so did Tom Stoppard and his
collaborators in the film Shakespeare in Love): he takes on the voice of
the man who could have Macbeth moan in a rhapsody of horror about making
&quot;the multitudinous seas incarnadine&quot; and Beatrice say, &quot;I would eat his
heart in the marketplace&quot;.

Fools, as well as angels, have shown more fear.

In the midst of all this it comes as a relief to read the final book of
Tony Nuttall, professor of English at Oxford, who allows himself the
liberty of quoting many of Shakespeare's words. He also, in a way that
seems positively old-fashioned, attempts to make sense of them and to
trace something like what T.S. Eliot called the pattern in the carpet.

George Steiner said that as a child he declared that the three people
from history he would like to meet were Christ, Homer and Shakespeare.
Why? In order to see if they existed.

Well, we know that someone called William Shakespeare was born in
Stratford in 1564 and that he died there 52 years later. We know that he
plied his trade on the London stage and that he was one of the most
successful dramatists of the great Elizabethan-Jacobean moment that
lasted, as Bryson says, from 1567 until the Puritans closed the theatres
75 years later. It included not only such towering figures as
Christopher Marlowe, John Webster and Ben Jonson, but a significant
smattering of masterpieces by other playwrights, Middleton's The
Changeling and Tourneur's The Revenger's Tragedy being two.

The trouble is that this is just about all we know. We know Shakespeare
in his latter years bought the second best house in Stratford and we
know he left his second best bed to his wife Ann. But with Shakespeare
it's enigma all the way. Was the second best bed the cherished bed of
marriage, the best being reserved for distinguished guests? Was what
looks like the cursory mention in the will a way of cheating her out of
the two-thirds of his property she would have got under the law anyway?
Did he even draft the will or was it done for him in his last days,
perhaps by Ann herself?

And if the grit and trudge of this meagre minutiae all seems a long way
from &quot;we are such stuff as dreams are made on&quot;, what about the sonnets?
The sheer range of the plays dazzles the mind. Harold Bloom thinks only
the Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament, offers a work of equivalent tonal
range. The greatest of mid 20th-century critics, R.P. Blackmur, said the
plays testified to the fact that Shakespeare had a provisional faith in
many things. The boyish heroism of Hotspur plucking honour from the
pale-faced moon and Falstaff dismissing honour as a word. Who has it? He
who died on Wednesday. Shakespeare believed with the provisional faith
of a playmaker in the animate beauty of Rosalind in As You Like It, that
play of cascading champagne comedy, and he believed in the terrible
annihilating grief of King Lear.

As for the unmistakable hint, the ghost-like glow of the signature, what
about that halo of emotional reality and engulfing intensity that
touches the romances? Is there a more moving moment of happiness in the
whole of Shakespeare than the moment at the end of The Winter's Tale
when Leontes is reunited not only with his daughter but, more
especially, with his wife Hermione, long thought dead?

Yes, the plays are a world, but the sonnets, like an extra Shakespearean
grace note deriding all attempts at knowledge, are the great gulfs of
privacy that lie behind or apart from them. They are the exception that
proves the rule. If the plays are impersonal and the work of some
godlike intelligence &quot;refined out of existence&quot;, as Joyce would have
said, these are the opposite. There comes to seem something wholly
characteristic about the fact that the man who could with the same
stroke of the pen create Viola and, say, Timon of Athens, should also
have left what looks like the most confessional body of lyric poetry in
the language, even though we can not say with any certainty what is
being confessed to.

The sonnets are an intensely introspective sequence that attempts
repetitively, and with an extraordinary rehearsal of apparent diary-like
jotting down of frequently raw and disordered emotion, to represent what
appears to be an agonised relationship full of erotic idealism with a
boy and a subsidiary relationship, full of frank sexuality as well as
sexual nausea and self-disgust, with a woman, the so-called Dark Lady.

The sonnets depend very much on the frame through which they are read.
C.S. Lewis in the differently prejudiced 1950s said they were &quot;too
lover-like for ordinary male friendship&quot; but less than &quot;full-blown
pederasty&quot; though it's hard to see why. Germaine Greer is also
resistant, if not to the homoerotic charge of the sonnets, then at least
to any biographical literalism. She writes:

Similarly, extravagant though their language of love may be, no one who
read the sonnets before the 19th century imagined their context to be a
consummated sexual relationship between men. Idealistic friendship did
not involve buggery, regardless of what classical scholars have always
known about same-sex relationships in antiquity.

The fact remains that Sonnet 20 ends with a pun on the youth's penis:
&quot;But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,/Mine be thy love
and thy love's use their treasure.&quot;

And the poetry is full of amatory anxiety of the &quot;If you really loved
me&quot; variety. There are also characteristically several stabs at the same
idea. One of the very greatest (and most radically disillusioned) is
Sonnet 94, &quot;They that have power to hurt and will do none&quot;, which
concludes with the extraordinary put-down, &quot;For sweetest things turn
sourest by their deeds/Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.&quot;

The previous sonnet, 93, has a go at the same idea but with the image of
a fruit rather than a flower. Apples have anatomical analogies as well
as the connotation of Eden, temptation and the Fall, all invoked: &quot;How
like Eve's apple doth thy beauty glow/If thy sweet virtue answer not thy
show!&quot;

An age that swallows the benignity of gayness with its mother's milk has
no difficulty with the homosexual (or bisexual) implications of the
sonnets. Even as painstaking a formalist as the great Harvard poetry
professor Helen Vendler takes their sexual and homoerotic quality as a
given. Recent scholarship is even keener to see Shakespeare bisexual
than it is to see him as a Catholic, going off in his so-called lost
years to schoolmaster in recusant Lancashire. (Never mind that
Shakeshaft, the name that has been uncovered, is not a very flash alias.)

It has to be admitted that just as one kind of recent Shakespeare
scholarship wants Shakespeare to be a Catholic in post-Reformation
England because it's the nearest thing to being a terrorist and hence
decidedly transgressive, so another wants the sonnets to be
transparently and emphatically gay because that's the kind of
transgression -- yesterday's -- that we see as wholly conventional.

The difficulty with the sonnets is that they are some of the most
profound excavations of privacy in literature but although we enter
their interiority like a cave or an abyss we cannot know where we are
(or hence where Shakespeare was). It is as if we see the world through
his eyes and therefore, by definition, cannot see his face.

Was he in love with a boy who was also a lord? It seems so, a lord of
him anyway. Certainly he must have spent some time -- five weeks? five
years? -- imagining so. But isn't this the Shakespeare who, as Greer
says, is the greatest celebrator of marriage in Western literature?

Yes, and in the sonnets we have &quot;Let me not the marriage of true minds
admit impediment./Love is not love that alters when it alteration
finds.&quot; Was it addressed to the boy? Maybe. Was &quot;The expense of spirit
in a waste of shame&quot; addressed to the Dark Lady? Probably, &quot;hell&quot; seems
to have meant c--t in the last line, &quot;To shun the heaven that leads men
to this hell&quot;. So again, maybe.

So is there a connection between the girls disguised as boys (and played
by boys) in the great romantic comedies Twelfth Night and As You Like It
and the fact that Shakespeare seems to have had a gay interlude with the
boy he calls his &quot;master mistress&quot;. Probably not, but maybe.

But, hold on, isn't it possible that we project the image of the Youth
on the poetry needlessly? &quot;Bare ruined choirs&quot; doesn't have to remind
us, does it, as it reminded William Empson, that ingenious analyser of
multiple meanings, of bare ruined choirboys? Well, no, I don't think so.
It's a vivid idea, though. But couldn't he have just made the whole
thing up? Well, yes. Couldn't it be an exercise in self-dramatisation
rather than a recollection of anything that happened? Maybe, maybe, maybe.

With Shakespeare it's all a matter of maybes. As Nuttall says in
Shakespeare the Thinker, when it comes to Shakespeare's life all we can
do is build houses of straw so it just becomes a matter of the quality
of the straw. He then proceeds to show with great imaginative delicacy
and critical precision how the death of a 15-year-old girl named
Katharine Hamlett, who drowned in Stratford -- perhaps a suicide, though
an inquest decided otherwise -- might have influenced his
representation, full of beauty and squalor, of Ophelia's death in Hamlet.

It is a remarkable case of using a snippet of history to illuminate the
play and it is far more convincing for being delicate and speculative.
The trouble with all sorts of historicisms when it comes to Shakespeare
is that the history comes to blind us to what makes him interesting in
the first place, the power of his imagination. That's one reason why
J.P. Wearing's fictional Shakespeare Diaries are so obviously lame. Here
is a representative slab:

Twelfth Night -- I have done little but blot a line here and a line
there. Thus it is complete and I care not greatly for it, though I would
see it personated. It is comedy enow, but my mind dwells on darker
matter -- Hamlet hath more savour than twins and love. Oft I have
recalled the line &quot;If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn
it as an improbable fiction&quot;, for much we do is but fiction most
improbable. Bob Armin &amp; Tom Pope, most friendly, told me yesterday of
some conference they had of cakes, ale and ginger spices -- all which
they would have me add if I were so pleased. So I have pleased them.

It's not hard to see where this is coming from. The opening echoes
Jonson's crack that he wished Shakespeare, who was said to have never
blotted a line, had blotted a thousand. The pastiche of Renaissance
language is hideously banal and is more or less what most people
competent to perform the impossible job might come up with if forced but
the wonder is that it is being done at all. And the truly enfeebling
thing is that Wearing's Shakespeare, and here he differs from Burgess's,
has nothing to say except the obvious antiquarian things. There's the
echo of bits of Twelfth Night but the cakes and ale, the ginger and the
improbable fiction are too obvious and ye olde for words. &quot;My mind
dwells on darker matter&quot;, which intimates the onset of Hamlet, is
ridiculously pedestrian as well as unconvincing imitation.

What Wearing doesn't allow for is the fundamental principle in
evaluating whether a hitherto unknown passage might be by Shakespeare:
it should have a word in it that Shakespeare has never used before. If
we take this a step further, a Shakespeare diary should be surprising
and Wearing's attempt isn't. It is a theme park of fancy-dress
mundanities made out of well-known quotations or allusions.

Germaine Greer can hardly be accused of this in Shakespeare's Wife. In
the longest published excursus she has made on Shakespeare (about whom
she wrote a PhD at Cambridge in the '60s) Greer is at pains to put Ann
Hathaway, long derogated by Shakespeare scholars, back in the picture,
at least as a feasible hypothesis or a necessary fiction that has as
much claim to &quot;straw&quot; truth as anything else. One aspect of Greer's
endeavour is indicated in her last chapter about the preparation of the
First Folio:

Three months after Ann Shakespeare died, her husband's collected plays
were published in a handsome folio. Scholars have never given any
consideration to the possibility that the Bard's wife might have been
involved in the Folio project. They prefer to believe that she was
illiterate, had nothing whatever to do with Shakespeare's creative work,
and no interest in it whatsoever. The idea that she might be entitled to
some of the credit for the preservation of her husband's work is
apparently too ridiculous to contemplate, which is why we shall now
contemplate it.

The strange thing about Shakespeare's Wife is that it is a heretical,
even fanciful, book about Ann Hathaway by a woman who, to a fault,
disdains any interest in anything but the known sociological aspects of
her subject. Greer has been schooled to the Peter Laslett emphasis on
what the evidence can tell us about Tudor and Stuart England. She pores
over records of sales figures and lawsuits and statistics on how many
grandmothers lived with their children and grandchildren (not many,
apparently) and the likelihood of female literacy in Ann Hathaway's case
and a thousand other cases, as well as the engrossing arcana of
Elizabethan malt brewing, pox treatment and guild disputation.

This is a book about the hypothetical lives of Stratford women as it can
be gleaned from the bare, unvivid accounts or, more likely, registries
and how it can be personalised by some principle of coercion to a figure
called Ann Hathaway (Ann Shakespeare) who has been marginalised by
centuries of male scholars for no good reason except that their own
unthinking misogyny could so effortlessly and unconsciously overlay the
enigma of Shakespeare's own.

Shakespeare's Wife is industriously researched and expertly written but
at the same time profoundly maddening because it has a nearly satirical
relation to the dry-as-dust biography that passes for history in this
area. We know next to nothing about Shakespeare even though we know more
about him than any playwright of his day. What Greer does is try to
create a comparable fire by rubbing together the even drier and scarcer
sticks of what is known about his wife because of him.

Occasionally, in the midst of wastelands of hypothetical empirica a
detail will slip out like a glimpsed poignancy with the power of a lost
poetry, as when Greer writes that peasant women lay in the same bed as
the dying and it's possible Ann Hathaway may have done this with her
long absent (if he was long absent) husband when, at the last, he lay
dying in Stratford.

For much of the rest of the time she is intent on disabusing the record
of such sentimental details as Peter Ackroyd's assertion that
Shakespeare would have come rushing back for the funeral of his son
Hamnet. Greer says the boy would have been buried long before
Shakespeare could have got there.

Not surprisingly, Greer has poignancies of her own, though they tend to
be guarded, undisclosed, pulled back. She says towards the end that John
Hall, Ann Hathaway's son-in-law, &quot;can hardly have known what Ann's early
life was like, when she nursed her first baby with her boy husband by
her side, and they read in their Bible the injunction so dear to the
uxorious puritans: `Let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice in the wife
of thy youth. Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her
breasts satisfy thee at all times, and delight in her love continually'
(Proverbs, v: 17-18).&quot;

At the finish Greer says again that her book is &quot;heresy&quot; and &quot;probably
neither truer nor less true than the accepted prejudice&quot;. She goes on:

The Shakespeare wallahs have succeeded in creating a Bard in their own
likeness, that is to say, incapable of relating to women, and then
vilified the one woman who remained true to him all his life, in order
to exonerate him. There can be no doubt that Shakespeare neglected his
wife, embarrassed her and even humiliated her, but attempting to justify
his behaviour by vilifying her is puerile. The defenders of Ann Hathaway
are usually derided as sentimental when they are trying simply to be
fair. It is a more insidious variety of sentimentality that wants to
believe that women who are ill treated must have brought it upon
themselves. The creator of Hero, Desdemona, Imogen and Hermione knew
better.

In the acknowledgments Greer thanks &quot;all the people who have let me bang
on at them over the years about Shakespeare's attitude to marriage and,
much more recently, about Shakespeare's wife&quot;. She lists &quot;late greats&quot;
such as Laslett and the critic L.C. Knights and &quot;among the living, Her
Majesty the Queen, Professor Ann Barton&quot; and &quot;the odd taxi driver&quot;. It's
an odd list that makes one wonder whether Elizabeth II really was
subjected to accounts of Tudor birthing procedures and ecclesiastical
peculiarities, as are readers of this book.

It's possible, of course, that Her Majesty may have enjoyed it, because
Shakespeare's Wife is a kind of crowded garden full of the 10,000 plants
and trifles that might beguile a woman, someone with a taste for that
kind of thing.

What tingles through the book with the glow of something repressed is
the intensity of Greer's feeling for Shakespeare's work (In Shakespeare
the Thinker, Nuttall remembers the defence of The Taming of the Shrew in
The Female Eunuch and describes Greer, appreciatively, as &quot;in those days
herself a brilliant shrew much given to verbal violence against
others&quot;.) I mean no disrespect to Germaine Greer in saying that it is in
a full-scale critical study of Shakespeare that she might do justice to
herself.

There is no whiff of literary criticism, full-scale or sketched, in
Bryson's sprightly little life of Shakespeare. It's all executioner's
axe vividness with a fair amount of historical information in highly
readable small compass. It never gets better than this description of
the Chandos portrait that now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in
London:

Among the lesser-noted disposals was a dark oval portrait, 22 inches
high by 18 wide, purchased by the Earl of Ellesmere for 355 guineas and
known ever since as the Chandos portrait. The painting had been much
retouched, and was so blackened with time that a great deal of detail
was (and still is) lost. It shows a balding but not unhandsome man of
about 40, who sports a trim beard. In his left ear he wears a gold
earring. His expression is confident, serenely rakish. This is not a
man, you sense, to whom you would lightly entrust a wife or grown daughter.

There's also a neat evocation of Southampton, the invoked patron and
possible subject of the sonnets, &quot;playing wantonly&quot; with a fellow
soldier and looking like a million dollars.

Bryson has nothing much to say about the plays except that they are
great and tends to rely on his interviews with scholars such as Stanley
Wells. He does, however, have a neat and very funny rebuttal of those
who dispute Shakespeare's authorship, noting (among other cheering facts
such as the names of the anti-Shakespeareans: Looney, Batty, etc) that
Edmond de Vere, earl of Oxford, a high pretender, died some years before
Shakespeare stopped writing plays.

This is obvious stuff; almost everything about Bryson's book is obvious
except for its style, but it does have the advantage of being a book on
Shakespeare that could be read on a shortish plane ride.

Shakespeare the Thinker, on the other hand, is easily the most
formidable book I have read about the Bard since Frank Kermode's
Shakespeare's Language. It is a searching study by a critic with a
subtle, philosophically inflected mind who is everywhere alive to the
kind of thinking that underlies the plays without ever wanting to reduce
them to positions. Nuttall, who died in January, is that very rare
thing, a brilliant critic who can think on his feet and dramatise how he
is thinking.

He relates Measure for Measure to the Borges fable in which Judas
becomes the despised servant and to a version of gnostic Christianity
that he says Shakespeare may have heard Marlowe mention in a pub but
probably hit on as an interesting concept himself: Angelo as the devil
through whom good is done.

Nuttall sees the subtlety of the representation of politics, even in
Henry VI, and he is brilliant in the counterintuitive account he gives
of how Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream are mirror images
of each other.

He is fascinatingly sane and wise on every aspect of Shakespeare from
the justice-mercy dichotomy in The Merchant of Venice through the
extraordinary tragedy of Lear, in which, completely unfashionably, he
does see a kind of reverse pieta in which the father mourns for the holy
one and will not be comforted.

Nuttall is a superb critic because he manages to combine the blindingly
true with the disarmingly subtle. He is the kind of critic who reflects
on the fact that Shakespeare's tragic heroes get less rather than more
intelligent as they progress from Richard II and Hamlet to Othello and
Lear but that Macbeth starts in brilliant introspective subtlety but
ends in booming blindness.

He argues without sophistry that all the points of view that lurk in
potentia in Shakespeare are the consequence of his extraordinary
dramatic intelligence. Shakespeare knows, in a way most members of his
audience will not, just why it is barbaric to make Shylock convert to
Christianity, just as he knows that we don't know, not quite, where that
ghost in Hamlet comes from.

Shakespeare the Thinker is the dazzler among these books. Wearing awaits
the creative intelligence that might turn his Shakespeare Diaries into
something worth attending to. Greer is, for the moment, obsessed by the
benumbing micro-facts of all but irrecoverable early modern &quot;life&quot;.
Bryson will give you the dungeons and the headsman and the smell of the
streets. But Nuttall can illuminate Shakespeare. Here is a man who
writes like a deeply thoughtful lover of the greatest writer of all
time. If you read a book about Shakespeare any time in the next few
years make it this one.
