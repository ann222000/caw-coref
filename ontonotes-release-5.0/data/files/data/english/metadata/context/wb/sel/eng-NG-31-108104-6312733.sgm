My oldest cat, and smallest of the three, literally stomps on my head
every night when I am sound asleep in the bed.  No doubt this is a
strategy for waking up the sleeper in order to induce a session of
rubs, snuggling, kisses and pets.  When I am overly tired, I ignore
it, but in vain, for she only continues until I give in and pay
attention to her.  All that trouble is worth it, though, for the
second I touch her soft furry head, she begins to purr.

Does anyone else here have a nightly head-stomper?

Sincerely,

Puzzledwoeman

At least one of my seven will do this each night. They've actually trained
me to lay awake and wait until everyone has settled in for the night.

How funny is that... Fortunately, my Charlie does not stomp.  He will
just comfortably curl up around my head.  However, when he does want
me to wake up, he thinks that just by staring at me, he can will me
awake.  Sometimes it works, I open my eyes and he is just sitting up
in the dark staring at me with this crazy demonic expression on his
face....
kind of creepy when i'm not expecting it.

When WooToo wants me to wake up she causes the d*g Bear to stand
outside our room asking to go outside. When she has other orders for
me she stands somewhat near whatever is bothering her and makes
yeeking noises until I figure out what is wrong and fix it or, more
usually, just fix one thing after another until I hit the right one.

I fixed Rumble and Spirit from doing this in the middle of the night.
One night after not getting any sleep. I stayed up with the cover over my
head when on of them stepped on my head.  I grabbed them and pulled them
under the covers and smothered them with kisses and face rubs. After a
couple times of doing that and them having to get the human smell off of
them . They learned.
Now when any of them start to bother me when I am a sleep.  I repeat
the process.   Spirit can't stand it for once he gets the human smell off of
him.   I grab him again and give him some more loving.  Usually he takes off
protesting loudly the whole time with me chuckling in the back ground.

This is funny to imagine.  I love torturing kitties with kisses.  When
I'm doing it, I love the feel of their soft warm fur on my lips and
the sweet smell of cat in my nostrils.
