Looks like the slow 3G network died a terrible death today. Jobs said
it's a &quot;power hog&quot;, so basically that's the end of the 3G approach for
all cellphone companies worldwide going forward.

Just like I thought, WiFi is going to rule the airwaves, not 3G.

That is...

Unless 3.5G / 4G, gets MUCH better about power consumption or Jobs will
simply put them ALL out of business. Take your pick!

Cell companies are very inefficient, they've never had the competitive
envirnoment that the computer industry has known, so Jobs and Co will
steamroll them unless they get their act together soon.

Companies that don't hold iPhone contracts are basically dead in the
water at this point, especially now that 3G has been rendered obsolete.
Cellphone companies are going to have to scramble to catch up with what
Apple is delivering today. Everything is going EVDO or WiFi, so it was
good that the US never got stuck with old fashioned 3G like Europe did.

The iPhone gets around 6 hours of talk time, 10-40 hours of normal use.
200 hours of standby. 3G would cut that in half. No thanks!

----

Apple chief executive Steve Jobs slammed 3G phones for having limited
battery life as he launched the iPhone in the UK through an exclusive
deal with network operator O2.

O2 is thought to have signed an unprecedented agreement passing around
10pc of all revenues from the iPhone to Apple, whose tough commercial
terms some other mobile networks baulked at.

One of those was Vodafone, whose chief executive Arun Sarin has pointed
out that the first version of the iPhone will not run on 3G mobile
networks, thus offering only the slower web browsing speeds of 2.5G
unless customers are in a wi-fi hotspot.

Mr Jobs, however, said Apple had decided against incorporating 3G for
now because it drained battery life. &quot;The 3G chipsets work well apart
from power. They're real power hogs. Most phones now have battery lives
of two to three hours,&quot; he added.

&quot;Our phone has eight hours of talktime life. That's really important
when you start to use the internet and want to use the phone to listen
to music. We've got to see the battery lives for 3G get back up into the
five-plus hour range. Hopefully we'll see that late next year.&quot;

Ben Wood, director of research at CCS Insight said: ''Jobs knows people
are going to buy iPhone whether it's got 3G or not, it's a lifestyle
device and a fashion item.

&quot;If you put 3G into it, it could cost $20 to $40 extra for Apple to make
each one just to placate network operators who have invested billions in
networks. Doing it this way also allows Jobs to stand up in a year's
time and say 'now the time is right for the 3G iPhone'.&quot;

Apple is expected to award a German iPhone distribution deal to Deutsche
Telekom's T-Mobile and a French deal to France Telecom's Orange later
this week.

Asked to respond to talk that he had angered European mobile networks by
playing them off against each other before picking partners Mr Jobs
said: &quot;It's kind of like getting married. We dated a few people but
didn't get married to them. I guess there are a few upset girlfriends
out there.&quot;

the Cellphone Industry. He'll work his way down over the coming years to
control most of the industry, so everyone better shape up or ship out.

There really isn't any other choice for cell companies at this point.

Oh, my stupid little troll.  You need to learn more before posting in the

This was really just a rationalization in an attempt to cast the iPhone
competition in a bad light, until Apple can catch up and offer 3G.

Yes 3G uses a lot of power, so does WiFi. A lot of users of 3G are
tethering, and the large laptop battery is powering the phone via USB.

It's two different markets. Most iPhone users are content with Edge to
use when on the road, and at work and home they have WiFi. The HSDPA and
EVDO users are willing to pay for high-speed ubiquitous access. For now,
WiFi access is very hit or miss, and of course there is no handoff.
WiMax will change all this if it ever gets deployed sufficiently, but
we're a long way from that.

Verizon &amp; Sprint  use  CDMA/1xRTT/EVDO and are implementing CDMA2000
All of the current phones will contimue to be compatable as CDMA2000 is
implemented.

ATT &amp; T-Mobile  use  GSM/GPRS/EDGE  and will eventually convert to
UMTS/HSDPA also kmown as WCDMA.
When ATT converts to WCDMA the current GSM phones will no longer work.
Like GSM phones &amp; TDMA phones are not compatable.

Again demonstrating his complete and TOTAL ignorance....

WiFi operates on 2 UNLICENSED frequencies. Same as many other devices.
Like cordless phones, baby monitors, etc, etc.... It is NOT an ideal RF situation.

WiMax's implementation in the US will be using LICENSED frequencies.
(Just like good old cellular Oxford.)

The two are very definitly NOT the same. And, Sprint-Nextel will be building
wimax out as an overlay to existing CELLULAR infastructure. Clearwire also
colocates on existing cellular infastructure the majority of the time.

Comparing Wimax with Wi-Fi

Due to the fact both WiMAX and Wi-Fi begin with the same two letters and both have a
connection to wireless connectivity and the Internet, comparisons and confusion between
the two are frequent. Despite this, the two standards are aimed at TOTALLY different applications.

WiMAX is a long-range system, covering many kilometers that typically uses licensed spectrum
to deliver a point-to-point connection to the Internet from an ISP to an end user.

Wi-Fi is a shorter range system, typically hundreds of meters, that uses unlicensed spectrum
to provide access to a network, typically covering only the network operator's own property.
Typically Wi-Fi is used by an end user to access their own network, which may or may not be
connected to the Internet.

If WiMAX provides services analogous to a cellphone, Wi-Fi is more analogous to a simple
low tech and short range cordless phone.

WiMAX and Wi-Fi have quite different Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms. WiMAX uses a mechanism
based on setting up connections between the Base Station and the user device (cell again). Each
connection is based on specific scheduling algorithms, which means that QoS parameters can be
guaranteed for each flow.

WiFi has introduced a QoS mechanism similar to fixed Ethernet, where packets can receive different priorities
based on their tags. This means that QoS is relative between packets/flows, as opposed to guaranteed.

WiMAX is highly scalable from what are called 'femto' scale remote stations to multi-sector 'maxi' scale base
that handle complex tasks of management and mobile handoff functions and include MIMO-AAS smart antenna
subsystems.

WiFi simply isn't and it NEVER WILL BE.

YOU are an idiot Oxford.

changeable. The trick is to incorporate the battery compartment into the
cosmetic design, not dismiss it as irrelevent.

This will come back to bite Apple in a few months because the

Here is an edited down version of yesterday's press conference. Good to
watch so you can better understand why 3G isn't up to the task for the
iPhone.

http://crave.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/0,39029453,49292859,00.htm

I think once the 3G world gets it's chip design group working at a
higher level and it becomes free to use like WiFi, they may still have a
shot, otherwise WiFi will wipe them out over the long term. (except in
extreme remote locations - where WiFi won't be for awhile)

Free WiFi makes more sense and will get rid of those pesky cell
companies that want money for basically a &quot;free service&quot;.

Here I go, getting sucked into this stupid discussion again. :)

I'm not an Apple detractor. I've been a fan of Apple since the Apple IIe. I
think the latest Macs are neat, especially since OS X is a Unix derivative
and I'm a Unix guy. :)

I'm not even an iPhone detractor. I have *no* opinion on the iPhone since I
have never used one, and probably will never use one because I'm not a
subscriber to the only US carrier that sells it.

In my opinion, the problem isn't day-to-day usage of the phone. I actually
agree that most people probably don't carry around spare batteries.

My problem is what you're expected to do when the battery finally dies for
good. I'm going to spend how much on a battery... and then instead of putting
it in myself, I have to send the phone to Apple and either

** pay extra for a loaner, or
** get someone to lend me an unused phone, or
** just go without the phone until Apple sends mine back.

This is not a very customer-friendly policy.

not sure what you mean, Steve left Apple long before he had a chance to

Cell Company is as powerful as IBM was in the 60's 70's, so this will be

Apple now owns the entire high end of the PC market, it will do the same

The thought of some brain-damaged idiot driving the freeway while trying to

I hope legislation is passed in each and every state to protect the innocent
from ignorant dweebs downloading
or surfing the net instead of paying attention to traffic.

Anyone caught surfing the web, downloading, etc while driveling should have
a minimum one year license suspension.
Second offense should result in permanent revocation of driving license.

I pray you don't wipe out some poor family while you are driving while using
3G.

&gt;&gt; ah, shifting goal posts? just as i figured.

&gt;&gt; wimax is wifi, the cell network is dead, just as i've been saying.

&gt; Again demonstrating his complete and TOTAL ignorance....

&gt; WiFi operates on 2 UNLICENSED frequencies. Same as many other devices.
&gt; Like cordless phones, baby monitors, etc, etc.... It is NOT an ideal RF situation.

&gt; WiMax's implementation in the US will be using LICENSED frequencies.
&gt; (Just like good old cellular Oxford.)

&gt; The two are very definitly NOT the same. And, Sprint-Nextel will be building
&gt; wimax out as an overlay to existing CELLULAR infastructure. Clearwire also
&gt; colocates on existing cellular infastructure the majority of the time.

&gt; Comparing Wimax with Wi-Fi

&gt; Due to the fact both WiMAX and Wi-Fi begin with the same two letters and both have a
&gt; connection to wireless connectivity and the Internet, comparisons and confusion between
&gt; the two are frequent. Despite this, the two standards are aimed at TOTALLY different applications.

&gt; WiMAX is a long-range system, covering many kilometers that typically uses licensed spectrum
&gt; to deliver a point-to-point connection to the Internet from an ISP to an end user.

&gt; Wi-Fi is a shorter range system, typically hundreds of meters, that uses unlicensed spectrum
&gt; to provide access to a network, typically covering only the network operator's own property.
&gt; Typically Wi-Fi is used by an end user to access their own network, which may or may not be
&gt; connected to the Internet.

&gt; If WiMAX provides services analogous to a cellphone, Wi-Fi is more analogous to a simple
&gt; low tech and short range cordless phone.

&gt; WiMAX and Wi-Fi have quite different Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms. WiMAX uses a mechanism
&gt; based on setting up connections between the Base Station and the user device (cell again). Each
&gt; connection is based on specific scheduling algorithms, which means that QoS parameters can be
&gt; guaranteed for each flow.

&gt; WiFi has introduced a QoS mechanism similar to fixed Ethernet, where packets can receive different priorities
&gt; based on their tags. This means that QoS is relative between packets/flows, as opposed to guaranteed.

&gt; WiMAX is highly scalable from what are called 'femto' scale remote stations to multi-sector 'maxi' scale base
&gt; that handle complex tasks of management and mobile handoff functions and include MIMO-AAS smart antenna
&gt; subsystems.

&gt; WiFi simply isn't and it NEVER WILL BE.

&gt; YOU are an idiot Oxford.

999-99-9999 for your SSN number then you will be routed to &quot;Go Phone&quot;
mode... (no 2 year contract - and for sure on a minute to minute basis
more expensive) BUT if you are mainly going to use the WiFi surfing,

Show some imagination instead of jumping to a conclusion.  The poster
you're calling an ass could be using navigation apps that don't
require his input while driving, or might even be a PASSENGER!
Surely you don't have a problem with my wife checking HER e-mail in
the passenger seat while I'M driving, do you?

&gt; ah, shifting goal posts? just as i figured.

&gt; wimax is wifi, the cell network is dead, just as i've been saying.

Sorry, this is a little deviation from the actual subject being discussed.

But, again, it shows that another of your contentions is pure horseshit.

The iPhone didn't hurt Verizon one bit.

Verizon Wireless saw some subscribers defect to AT&amp;T to get the iPhone
but the impact was short-lived, said one of Verizon's parents, Vodafone Group, on Wednesday.
Vodafone Chief Executive Arun Sarin said on Wednesday that right after the iPhone was launched
in late June, some Verizon Wireless customers moved, or ported, their numbers to AT&amp;T.

&quot;Porting ratios went negative but a month afterward porting ratios were back,&quot; he said, adding that
a similar trend occurred when Apple cut the price of its iPhone to $399 from $599 earlier this month.
&quot;Porting ratios go negative, then two weeks later were back to normal again,&quot; he said.

The iPhone is nothing more than a blip on the radar.

&gt; You'll get it in time &quot;Reality&quot;... I sense you have the intelligence to

&gt; In the meantime...

&gt; if you want to try out the iPhone on the cheap, here is your chance...
&gt; go to the below link... then on the right side, click on &quot;special
&gt; deals&quot;, then &quot;clearance&quot; .... not.... &quot;iphone&quot;.... and there you will

Sorry, your &quot;bright light&quot; must have burnt out.
It isn't shining a single photon of truth on anything.

And, thanks but no thanks. I wouldn't use AT&amp;T if it was free.

In fact in the past it was free for me. I had a free company phone on AT&amp;T.
It was so incredibly horrible, I kept using my VZW phone and avoided AT&amp;T.
I'd rather pay and have good service.
