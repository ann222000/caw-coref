I have a figurine of a bird standing on a limb.The trunk is 5 inches high
and has three limbs on it .The trunk is a ivory and light brown color
about 3 inches across the base and gets smaller as it goes up.The Bird is a
yellow with a red breast and blue on top of the head.On the bottom it has
three different markings.One is a circle [red] with the words made in
slovakia around the edges.In the center of the circle it says
czecka.Another mark is the number 4 depressed in .The other mark is a
number 25 stamped in red.Please help me identify this and could you help
with the value and who made it.Thank you very much.
Jack

Jack, I had one quite similar, and I sold it for about $18.00. Mine had
comparable markings, and I did not divine any special meaning. I suspect I was
able to get that price for it because someone just had to get the bird. Good
Luck

Jack,

If your figurine has Made in Slovakia on it, then it would most likely be after
the early 1990's when Slovakia became a country, and &quot;Made in&quot; was being used.
Some decorative exports from that area still show both country names.

I would have to agree with &quot;Pro&quot; that the value would be what someone who just
wanted that bird would pay.

Carol

"/> -----------------------
Your dating may be off, as the piece could have existed as &quot;Made in
Slovakia&quot; from 1888/98 [?][date of import rules requiring &quot;made in...&quot;] to
1918 or from 1939 - 1945.

Slovakia was historically a part of the 9th century empire of Moravia and
primarily under Hungarian rule from the 10th century. In 1526 Slovakia and
West Hungary passed to the Hapsburgs after Louis II of Hungary was defeated
by the Ottomans. In the 19th century there was a Slovak national revival,
in part in reaction to the Germanization of Slovakia in the previous
century.

In 1918, After the first World War, Slovakia became part of the new nation
of Czechoslovakia. The minority Slovaks campaigned for greater autonomy
from the Czech-dominated centralized state. In 1938 Slovakia was made an
autonomous unit once again by the Munich Pact and subsequently became a Nazi
German puppet state from 1939 - 1945. The Czechoslovak state was
reestablished after the war in 1945 and, after 1948, the Communist
government curtailed Slovak autonomy until 1969, when Slovakia was granted
autonomy over local affairs. In 1990, with the end of Communist rule,
Slovakia gained greater control over its affairs and budget, as well as some
power-sharing with the national government. Discontent with depressed
economic conditions resulting from free-market reforms brought nationalists
to power in 1992. Czech and Slovak leaders agreed to Slovakian independence
and the dissolution of Czechoslovakia on the first of January, 1993.

I was not aware that Slovakia was an independent country(at least from Czecha)
1939-45 so if they were exporting at that time I could be off by a &quot;few years&quot;,
50-60 or so. (I was a Science Major, what can I say?)

I am confused about the McKinley Tariff Act of 1891 if this is the one you are
referring to.
I was always led to believe that it only required the country of origin and
that almost all countries started adding &quot;Made in&quot; after World War 1 with the
exception of a very few countries that started using it in 1914. Even if that
is correct I still missed 4 years of possibilities, 1914-18. :-)

I realize you cited 1888-9 as an import tariff date so perhaps there is some
other law/rule that took effect. If it is, please let me know because I hate to
operate under mis- or lack of information.

Thanks for sharing your knowledge, I always look forward to your educational
posts.

Carol, you're mostly right about the Tariff Act of 1891 for items
imported into the USA, except it specifically required the country of
origin in English (although Japan continued to use Nippon for a while
after that). In 1921, &quot;Made in...&quot; was added as a requirement.

But... some countries started earlier... near as I can tell from
observation and reading, England started using &quot;Made in England&quot; around
the turn of the century (well before 1921), so perhaps they were abiding
by some regulations from their own country (or neighboring European
countries).

And, you'll still see new stuff marked &quot;Japan.&quot; They also use stickers
which say Made in Japan to comply with US regs, and once the sticker is
gone, it's hard to date when the item was made because the bottom is
only stamped &quot;Japan&quot; (convenient for them, no?). &lt;grin&gt;

IOW, you can't always date a piece by whether the name is written in
English or not, or whether it says &quot;Made in...&quot; or not, or even if it
says &quot;Nippon&quot; or &quot;Japan.&quot; Fake marks abound (especially Nippon) and
sticky labels fall off. Slovakia (or Czechoslovakia or other variations)
may be helpful in dating, as are other countries whose names change
frequently, but nothing is 100% foolproof when it comes to marks.

HTH, Michele

Thank you Michele.

I'll add that clarification to my reference notebook. Now I know why I
always preferred dealing in American furniture. It was much easier to date.
IMO.

I don't think you find &quot;Made In&quot; on &quot;antique&quot; American furniture either, I meant
it's easier to date based on construction methods, types of wood used, style (or
lack thereof), etc.

Joan,

The main features would be the front, possibly the back if there is a question of
repro, and a good picture showing the grain and color of the wood unless you know
for sure what kind of wood it is.. Also needed would be a picture or a good
description of where the doors slide, i.e. up and in, to the side and in, one
behind the other, or??

Sometimes the type of hardware can add to the indentification as can saw marks,
joint construction, and type of nails or screws, when present.

If you have pictures you could post them to a web site, or email them and we can
give opinions.

Hope this answers your question.

Thanks Carol, it does answer my questions, namely about the type wood. I hate
trying to guess, unless that thing is cork I'm clueless. I will get pics and
upload, would you mind if I uploaded pics of a plant stand for you to take a
look at?
Thanks alot Carol, I really appreciate it!
