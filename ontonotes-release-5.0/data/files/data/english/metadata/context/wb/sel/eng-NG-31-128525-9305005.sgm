Take the Word of God and Feed Yourself
by Larry Ollison, Ph.D.

Lazy people get spitting mad when they hear that the only way you can receive from God is to take in the Word of God for yourself. We must take the Word of God, which is Jesus. We must take the Word of God, which is the Messiah. We must take the Word of God, which is the Anointed One and His anointing. We must take the Word of God, which is the Son of God. We must take the Word of God, Who is called the Word of God in Revelation. We must take that Word of God into ourselves.

How do we do that? Romans 10:17 says, € ¦’³So then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.€ ¦’´ Do you want to get the Word of God in you? Do you want the Word of God to come alive within you? Then you have to hear it. The only way you are going to hear it, is if it is spoken and the only way you are going to hear it spoken is to either be around people that speak the Word all the time or speak it yourself. When you mutter the Word of God continually, the Word of God comes alive in you because you hear what you say.

Romans 10:17 says faith comes by hearing and hearing by the rhema of God. Rhema means the living Word of God. Faith doesn€ ¦’²t come by the logos. Faith doesn€ ¦’²t come by just reading the scriptures. Faith comes when God€ ¦’²s Word comes alive in you € ¦’· when you know that that word is true and that word is for you. God spoke that word, spoken specifically for you and that word comes alive. That is the living Word of God within you. That€ ¦’²s what it has got to become. Then that Word is spirit and life.

God€ ¦’²s grace will meet you where you are. If you are a new Christian and all you know is John 3:16, start meditating there. God€ ¦’²s Word tells us we are to daily renew ourselves through the washing of the Word. So, don€ ¦’²t be lazy and expect someone else to feed you all the time. Take the Word of God and feed yourself. Take the Word into your inner most being. Let it live inside of you and then God€ ¦’²s Word will do what it was sent to do in your life.

Welcome to € ¦’³Decision€ ¦’´ magazine's weekly e-mail devotional.

€ ¦’³It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery€ ¦’´ (Galatians 5:1, NIV).

----------------------------------------------------------
A Word From Billy Graham
€ ¦’³Oh, the depth of God€ ¦’²s Grace! Oh, the height of God€ ¦’²s mercy, the breadth of God€ ¦’²s love, that He is willing to say to you and to me, € ¦’±I forgive you. You will never have to face the judgment!€ ¦’² When that gets through to you, you can go to bed and sleep a new kind of sleep. You will say to yourself, € ¦’±I don€ ¦’²t deserve this kind of release. Surely I will have to face the music sometime.€ ¦’² The full penalty has been paid. The Judge will never say, € ¦’±I pronounce sentence on you,€ ¦’² because Christ has accepted that sentence for you. In Christ you are free. Accept it by faith and go your way rejoicing. When you know the truth, the truth shall make you free. How wonderful! Sin is no longer in the throne room of my life. Christ sits there, and as I daily, moment by moment, yield my members to Him, He orders my life. Satan no longer has the power over my life that he once had. Sin is no longer in command. Oh, to be sure, I slip and fall, but Christ is there to pick me up and to put His arm
around me and to love me.€ ¦’´

----------------------------------------------------------
Forgiveness Sets Us Free
€ ¦’³Forgiveness is more than leaving behind sin and its penalty. Forgiveness frees us to serve God, to relate to Him and to engage in the activities that He gives us the privilege to do with Him. To come to Jesus, seeking from God the forgiveness that Jesus has the authority to bestow, is to gain release from that which limits our ability to be what God created us to be. God longs to forgive us. If we do not know Him, we may come to Him seeking forgiveness. We may trust Him to give us release. He will do it; He has promised that He will. That is why He sent His Son to die in our place, to pay the penalty for our sin and to set the stage for our forgiveness. What more could God have done to show how much He wants us to turn to Him? Jesus showed that forgiveness from Him is available for the asking. Let us ask for that forgiveness and rejoice in getting to know our gracious Forgiver€ ¦’´ (Darrell L. Bock).

Prayer
Father, help us to find forgiveness in You. Teach us to live in the freedom that Your forgiveness provides us. We pray in Jesus€ ¦’² name. Amen.

A Word In Due Season

OPEN MY EYES

Scripture: II Kings 6:17 &quot;Open his eyes, that he may see.&quot;

A great army had surrounded the city where the prophet Elisha and his servant were staying. When the servant saw that they were surrounded, He became distressed and sought comfort from Elisha. Elisha told his servant not to fear, declaring that there were more for them than against them, but the servant still couldn't see what the prophet of God saw. Elisha then prayed this simple prayer asking God to open the eyes of the servant. When God opened the servant's eyes and allowed him to see beyond the natural, he saw that the mountains were full of horses and chariots of fire, which were there to protect them.

Before my grandchild was born, we experienced a great blessing, for we were allowed to see an amazing video of her. As the doctor scanned the baby with the sonogram, we were able to see many of her features, which included her heart beating and a perfect view of her mouth making definite sucking motions. It was hard to grasp this wonderful blessing. Modern technology had made it possible for our eyes to see beyond our natural capabilities and allowed us to view a miracle. Yet, if we had not been able to see the child with our own eyes, the fact remained that she was there and full of life. This is a life lesson for us in the spiritual. Too often, it seems that evil surrounds us, and like the situation with Elisha and his servant, our vision is limited. We are only able to see the opposition and experience fear because we can't see what is happening in the spirit. Yet, God is surrounding us with His forces. Without God opening our spiritual eyes, we can't see a
way of escape any more than we could see the baby in the womb without the help of a sonogram. However, regardless of our limited vision, God is quietly working undercover on our behalf and has a plan and a time to bring all things into fruition.

I pray for you today, as the prophet prayed for his servant, that God would open your eyes supernaturally and allow you to see the heavenly forces that are fighting for you in the battles of life. I pray that you will get a glimpse of the blood of Jesus that was shed for your sins so that you could receive eternal life. I pray that you would come to understand the significance of the stripes that were laid upon Jesus' back, for Isaiah says that &quot;by His stripes you are healed.&quot; I pray that God's peace that passes all understanding would flood your spirit as you envision the crown of thorns that was placed upon Jesus' brow, for &quot;He took the chastisement of your peace upon Himself&quot; (Isaiah 53:5). And finally, I pray that your spiritual eyes would be opened to know God's heartbeat and that you would be assured that He is surrounding you with His love. I encourage you to pray the same simple prayer that the prophet prayed, &quot;Open my eyes that I may see.&quot; +++

Blessed is the man
Who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked
Or stand in the way of sinners
Or sit in the seat of mockers.
But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
And on his law he meditates day and night.
He is like a tree planted by streams of water,
Which yields its fruit in season
And whose leaf does not wither.
Whatever he does prospers.
-- Psalm 1:1-3

Harvest is Ready - October 31, 2007

The Heart Of The Matter

I Samuel 16:1-13

Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart -- I Samuel 16:7

How often are we guilty of leaving God out of our decision-making? Sometimes when we're faced with a choice, the right answer may seem obvious to us and those around us. But if we fail to ask the Lord to help us get to the heart of the matter, we might jump to a wrong conclusion.

That's what Samuel did when he set out to anoint Israel's next king. When he saw Eliab, Jesse's oldest son, Samuel was sure he had his man. Wrong! In fact, God chose the least likely of Jesse's sons, the youthful David. He was a man after God's own heart -- Acts 13:22, but Samuel saw only the outward appearance.

Including God in decision-making is a vital principle for churches too. When seeking a new pastor or someone to lead a church ministry, we're tempted to look only at externals. We're concerned with such things as speaking skills, friendliness, and ability to inspire-and we should be. But if we haven't asked God to get us past appearances to the heart, we haven't looked deep enough. We can't read hearts, but the Lord can. He knows when someone is closely following Him.

As you make your decisions today, be sure to include God.

Not mine-not mine the choice,
In things both great and small,
Be Thou my Guide, my Strength,
My Wisdom, and my All.

Close your devotional time by meditating on this thought:

If you don't want to end in failure, be sure to begin with God.

* As you make your requests known to the Lord, include:

€ ¦· . greater personal discipline,

€ ¦· . worldwide persecuted Christians,

€ ¦· . Hedge of protection to our children

€ ¦· . Blessings to our spouses

€ ¦· . Godly men in Government

€ ¦· . Rest and Peace to our pastors

€ ¦· . your activities for the day.

Love One Another

Stand Together

Fight this war, no matter the cost

Pray for our children

Turn our hearts toward heaven

Seek to be one nation under God.

God Bless and Guide You in your Christian Walk Today -

&quot;The Lord bless you and keep you,
The Lord make his face shine upon you
And be gracious to you;
The Lord turn his face toward you
And give you peace.&quot;
-- Numbers 6:24-27

Today's Daily Word

**** My Prayer ****

Thank You, God, for the miracle that is my life.

Dear God, both the accomplishments and detours along my way in life have offered me opportunities for growth, and You have been my ever-present help through it all. As my journey continues, I see myself becoming wiser, healthier, and happier.

Each day I know You better. In working in oneness with You, I make positive choices that create positive experiences. You are the light that illumines my way, the hope that lifts my spirits, the balm that heals any discomfort, and the resilience that keeps me keeping on. Knowing that Your spirit is within me and goes before me, I begin this day with confidence. Thank You, God, for the miracle that is my life.

&quot;I will thank you forever, because of what you have done. In the presence of the faithful I will proclaim your name, for it is good.&quot;-Psalm 52:9

THE GRACE MOUNTAINS
EPHESIANS 2:1-22
PART 1 OF 3
By Evangelist S. Lee Homoki

In the second chapter of Ephesians, the Apostle Paul is addressing believers
but is talking about their past sinful condition as unbelievers (vs. 2a). They
were described as being: &quot; .. .filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,
wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit,
malignity; whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud,
boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understand-ing,
covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful&quot; (Rom.
1:29-31). It was terrible! It would be like coming upon a horrifying train wreck!
Your first thoughts and words to describe the scene would be, &quot;Death,
destruction and devastation everywhere.&quot; Everything is in disarray and disorder and
the stench of death hangs heavy in the air. Even the skilled eyes of a trained
medical emergency team, sent to the scene, would conclude that there is &quot;no
hope.&quot; Such a sad evaluation! There are no sadder words to fall on human ears!
Here, the Apostle Paul, looking over the great wreck of Gentile humanity,
inspired of God the Holy Spirit, declares them as &quot;having no hope and without God in
the world&quot; (Eph. 2:12)!

Wreckage at the Foot ofthe Mountain (vss. 1-3)
The crash happened when Adam disobeyed God and promptly died - and all of
humanity with him! God had given Adam a solemn warning about the &quot;Tree of the
Knowledge of Good and Evil&quot; saying, &quot;Thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day
that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die&quot; (Gen 2:17).

&quot;For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive&quot; (Ieor.
15:22).
&quot;Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and
so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned&quot; (Rom 5:12).
€ ¦· &quot;For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through
Jesus Christ our Lord&quot; (Rom 6:23).

It is important for us to look carefully and honestly at this pile of human
rubble of which we are all a part. We will never fully appreciate or understand
God's saving grace if we don't! There is nothing savable! We must be
convinced that the destruction is so complete and so total that only the divine
application of God's great grace and power could ever restore what has been lost!
When the Apostle Paul surveys the debris field, he identifies at least three
reasons for his discouraging assessment:

1. All the victims are spiritually dead (vs. 1). Adam was living in a perfect
environment. Adam had no knowledge of what death was he should have listened
and obeyed but he didn't and guilt swept over both Adam and Eve. They learned
the consequences of sin by personal experience. They died spiritually and will
eventually die physically! Externally nothing had changed but inwardly Adam's
spirit died.

There are several kinds of death mentioned in the Bible and none of them are
very appealing or exciting. If death means anything, it means the cessation of
life or the inability to do anything! The worst would not be the cessation of
physical life but, rather, spiritual death. Spiritual death means that the
unsaved have no capacity to know God, love God, appreciate God or serve God.
They are &quot;alienated from the life of God&quot; (Eph. 4:18) and their destination is
ultimately to the &quot;lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second
death&quot; (Rev. 21 :8).

The root cause of this death was &quot;trespass and sins &quot; (Eph2:1; Col. 2:13; 2
Cor. 5:14). &quot;Sin&quot; means that man has no ability to hit the &quot;bulls-eye&quot; of God's
righteous demands. And &quot;trespass&quot; means that man is outside the boundary of
God's law. Mankind is guilty of both sin and trespass. We are sinners because,
by the inherited nature of Adam, we have gone our own way - the way that
&quot;seems right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death&quot; (Prov. 16:25).
And, we are trespassers because we have violated the boundaries of what we
knew by nature was the will of God (Rom. 2:14). The &quot;victims&quot; are thus declared
to be spiritually dead.

Should this Inspirational be a blessing and encouragement to you, why not
send to a friend, coworker or, to your loved one who maybe defending the USA the
Word of God is so needed in our troubled world.€ ¦  It is our heart at GRACE AND
THE TRUTH and mission to reach as many people as we possibly can TO SHARE with
them the Word of God and all that the Lord Jesus Christ has done for members
of the body of Christ.€ ¦

Messages in this topic (1) 9a. HOW TO STAY ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE DEVIL Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; HeartforGod7@shaw.ca serenity72000 Tue Oct 30, 2007 11:16 pm (PST) How To Stay One Step Ahead Of The Devil

&quot;Where there is grace there will be conflict.&quot; - J. C. Ryle

As Christians, we are definitely in a day-to-day conflict. It's no time for us to fall asleep - spiritually speaking - or to grow slothful. We must be on our guard at all times and in every place.

We are battling with an invisible enemy who does not meet us face-to-face. His method of warfare is to advance on us stealthily, secretly, and covertly. He does most of his work in the darkness. Rather than manifest himself in displays of great power, he chooses to attack us through fraud, deceits, snares, machinations, delusions, betrayals, etc.

The Scripture calls his schemes - &quot;wiles.&quot;(Ephesians 6:11). These are well-laid methods and cunning devices sent out to delude and destroy us. They are different means, plans, and schemes intended to entrap, enslave, and ruin us.

The only way that we could possibly stand against this deadly foe is to put on the Lord Jesus Christ - &quot;Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil&quot; (Ephesians 6:11). We must be completely covered or controlled by Jesus - have every portion of our lives under His Lordship and care. We cannot find ourselves half in the Spirit and half in the flesh - walking in the Spirit one minute and then walking in the flesh the next.

The Word of God commands us to &quot;Put on the whole armor of God...&quot; Every piece has been carefully selected and given to us by God in order to obtain the Victory over this foe. We must be completely absorbed in the Life of Jesus. There cannot be one ounce of darkness or death operating in us. Otherwise, the devil will have place and will cause us much hurt and harm.

It cannot be overly stressed that this warfare that we face every day is no playground.

The Scripture reminds us that it is an intense wrestling match - not with another man - but with chief rulers, authorities, potentates that preside over certain regions of the world, and wicked and evil spirits - &quot;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot;(Ephesians 6:12).

Their main intention is to draw us away from the Life of Jesus into the realm of the World, the Flesh, Sin, and Darkness.

There is no more successful means of doing this than to draw us into the realm of the Flesh.
Hence, we need to be more determined like never before to - &quot;Walk in the Spirit, and...not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.&quot;(Galatians 5:16). Our flesh must be mortified, and the Life of the Spirit must have full reign. This is the only way that we will survive in this treacherous fight.

The Scriptures give us some pointers that - if followed - will always keep us a step ahead of the devil -

1. At All Times Pay Attention To Your Lifestyle

1 Timothy 4:16 says - &quot;Take heed unto thyself...&quot;

We must -
...&quot;take heed&quot; or give heed to ourselves and the manner in which we carry ourselves. Our discourse must be edifying and our behavior holy.
...strive to be an &quot;example of the believers&quot;(1 Timothy 4:12) in our manners, habits of living, morals, contact with others, conversation, and temper.
...pay strict attention to our &quot;word&quot; - our teaching and preaching of the Word of God as well as our &quot;conversation&quot; or behavior.
...pay strict attention to our &quot;charity &quot; or affections and our &quot;spirit&quot; or mental disposition.
...&quot;take heed&quot; to our &quot;faith&quot; or beliefs as well as our &quot;purity&quot; or clean thinking and living.

In morals, we should - at all times and in every place - be upright.
In our contact with others, we should be consistently courteous, polite, kind, honest, upright, and godly.

2. Abstain! Abstain! Abstain!

1 Corinthians 9:25 informs us - &quot;And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things...&quot;

As Christians, we must accept the fact that we are called to a walk of temperance - a lifestyle of self-denial. Therefore, we will be required to give up things that not only are evil in nature but are a hindrance in our spiritual progress.

We must recognize and accept the fact that this Christian walk is an agonizing walk. It is a walk requiring great abstinence from &quot;all things&quot; that would hinder our spiritual growth. That would entail any and every indulgence that renders our flesh strong and our spirit weak.

Just as the boxer, wrestler, and runner do without certain foods, pleasures, and activities in order to compete in the match or game - even so are we to abstain from certain foods, drinks, habits, words, or unlawful as well as lawful indulgences which would cause our flesh to be strong and take dominion in our lives.

3. Be Determined To Gain the Goal And Hit the Target Each Time

1 Corinthians 9:26 says - &quot;I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air.&quot;

We have to be willing to exert ourselves to the maximum in order to reach the goal line - Heaven.

Our race is not haphazard. We are not running in all different directions - ignorantly and obscurely. Like all runners, we run within the margin of the white line - keeping our steps on the straight and narrow way... not turning to the right or to the left through distractions or sidetracks of the enemy.

When we &quot;fight,&quot; do we &quot;beat the air&quot;? Are we exerting ourselves or expending strength in vain? Or does every blow that we throw take us further onto our final destination?

The boxers in the Grecian games would be said to &quot;fight with a shadow.&quot; Before the fight, they would &quot;mock-battle&quot; or fight the air. They would exercise by using a gauntlet(glove) to develop and increase their skills. This was considered &quot;beating the air.&quot;

In an actual game, it also referred to the boxer running back and forth, stooping, and avoiding all kinds of shots from his opponent - intending to wear him out by having him throw blows into the air.

In this &quot;fight&quot; that we are involved in with the devil, we cannot afford to &quot;beat the air.&quot; Every blow that we throw must count. We cannot afford to waste our strength for nothing. Every effort that we take against the enemy must have effect or we will suffer some severe consequences.

4. Consider Your Body As An Enemy

1 Corinthians 9:27 tells us - &quot;But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection...&quot;

&quot;I keep under my body&quot; - This refers to making someone black and blue. It refers to striking a person under the eye with your fist so as to give him a black eye. It denotes treating another with harshness, cruelty, and severity.

We are to consider our flesh - with its evil propensities and corrupt and carnal inclinations - as an enemy. Therefore, we must use all possible means to reduce it to a state of slavery, servitude, or captivity. We must subdue and conquer it and not allow it any room for rulership.

5. Crucify It! Crucify it!

Galatians 5:24 says - &quot;And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.&quot;

All corrupt and sensual passions, desires, appetites, and lusts must be put to death so that they no longer have dominion over us.

6. Let The Holy Spirit Have Total Control

Galatians 5:25 tells us - &quot;If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.&quot;

We are not to be controlled by our flesh and its appetites and desires. We are to be controlled by the Holy Spirit. At all times and in every place, He is to direct, influence, and guide us. In turn, we are to yield and submit to Him.

Our foe is an invisible foe who is determined to destroy us.

We do not have to be overcome by this deceiver and trickster. We can be the Overcomers in this fight. The Scriptures give us some guidelines to follow in order to obtain the Victory in each battle that we face.

The choice is ours.

We can ignore the teachings in God's Word, or we can adhere to them.
We can &quot;live in the Spirit,&quot; or we can live according to the dictates of our Flesh.

The only way that we will stay a step ahead of the devil is for us to continuously keep our bodies in subjection, crucify every evil inclination and desire, and totally yield our members to the Holy Spirit's control.

God's Grace is available to you right at this moment to help you make the necessary changes in your walk with the Lord.
Why not receive it?
It is free for the asking.

May God Bless His Word.
Connie

+Living Life God's Way+

The heart is rich when it is content,
and it is always content when its desires are fixed on God.
Miguel Cordero-Munoz
_________________________________________________
Anxiety, Trust, Release
Do not be anxious then, saying, &quot;What shall we eat?&quot; or &quot;What shall
we drink?&quot; or &quot;With what shall we clothe ourselves?&quot;
Matthew 6:31
Anxiety is a state of mind we will occasionally experience when we trust self and government instead of trusting God. Trusting self for everything will meet with failure. God does not give us assurance that He will remove our anxiety but He informs us, &quot;Do not be anxious.&quot; Preventing anxiety is our responsibility, not God's responsibility. Since anxiety is created by our minds, then it is our minds that must stop it. God can empower us to prevent anxiety, only when we take the initiative. We must set our minds on God, who is the opposite of anxiety, and pursue Him. Putting our minds to work trying to not have anxiety serves to keep us caught in the trap of anxiety. Our minds must separate from the anxious thoughts and turn to positive, God.
Prayer: God, I now understand that anxiety is a natural state of mind when I trust myself or the world for all my needs. Help me turn loose of my independence and acknowledge my inabilities. help me make You more important than my worldly needs.

Messages in this topic (1) 11. An evening thought -- Forgiving Ourselves and Others devotional Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; HeartforGod7@shaw.ca serenity72000 Tue Oct 30, 2007 11:37 pm (PST)

Have you struggled with forgiving someone who has hurt you or abused you? Do you find yourself thinking about it a lot lately? If so, this is normal to feel whenever someone you trust has intentionally hurt you. However, you must find a way to give your hurt and pain to the Lord, for he will release you of the burden of guilt. Then, he will help you learn how to forgive those who have victimized you or someone you love.

The first memory verse is: Acts 3:19...&quot;Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.&quot;(KJV)

As you recite this verse, remember that you must confess all of your sins against God and others. Once you ask Him to forgive you for all of your sins, He is just and will erase all of your sins immediately. For we must spend time, learning exactly what forgiveness truly is, because it can hinder your spiritual growth. Honestly, forgiveness is ceasing to be angry over unacceptable behaviors that have affected you.

By forgiving someone, you are not giving them your permission to repeat the behaviors that hurt you. Instead, you should recognize the feelings that you feel, since these emotions are only going to cause you pain. Be honest and ask for the forgiveness of others, once you have evaluated your role in the entire situation. This way, you can free yourself, from the burden of bitterness and anger that can lead to depression.

The second memory verse is 1 John 1:9...&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot; (KJV)

Recite this verse, as you begin your transitional journey from being a victim to becoming a survivor. No matter what has happened in the past, you can fully overcome its negative effect on your life. However, you must forgive others also, for the pain and anguish or their behaviors or actions to stop. But, by allowing the offender to receive mercy, you are becoming worthy of God's complete forgiveness.

No longer will you receive condemnation, instead you will find peace that passes all understanding. In that moment, you will feel the burden of your guilt start to melt away as the anguish disappears. Suddenly, all of your past iniquities will be washed away and fully forgotten by your heavenly Father. Therefore, you will become a new creature in Christ, who is totally blameless and spotless before God. Wends
