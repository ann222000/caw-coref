&gt; Needn't worry as most of us are having a hard time working this out as well.
&gt; Sadly the parent of any of these kids didn't take these &quot;Kodak Moments&quot;.  I
&gt; would be more concerned about the photographer's pedophilic tendencies since
&gt; there was no permission obtained to take said photos and post them on the

&gt; punish the perpetrators.

Oh?
Then why would such sharp well composed pics be in such prestigious
magazines?  He caught the emotions of moment like any Sports
Illustrated photographer would.  Or child's magazine such as
Chickadee.

The crow shot is my absolute fav.  I love that blue background.  The
crow is very sharp and very well composed.  It makes me feel I can
touch his feathers.  Excellent work.

&gt; No shame when it comes to protecting the children.  As a parent I have valid
&gt; concerns about children being photographed without their parents strict and
&gt; written permission.  Helen, I'm not sure if you have children or not, but
&gt; any mother would feel very strongly about this and question the
&gt; photographer's motives.  Sadly in this day and age one has to error on the
&gt; side of safety first.  I think it despicable that one would post these
&gt; images of children on the internet without the parents knowledge and
&gt; permission.  It starts with stealing software than progresses to children.
&gt; I see a pattern forming.

I think your imagination is getting the best of you Rita.  Bret's wife
is a school teacher.  For all you know he was taking pics of her
students.  Nothing so despicable as you suggest.  Children here in
Canada have their parents sign a form the first day of school in
September stating whether they would allow their child to be
photographed and have their images reproduced or not. I know the day
and age we live in and there is nothing I hate more than a pedophile.
But it's so sad when a man cannot even smile at a child without a
parent grabbing their child and thinking the worse.  I know with all
the incidents that have taken place, parents certainly have to be on
guard at all time.  But don't accuse a man before you know for sure. I
can sternly verify the fact that Bret is not a pedophile.

&gt; I think what is getting the best of everyone in this group is your unnatural
&gt; intimacy with Bret and his family.  I would never accuse a man of anything
&gt; they haven't publicly admitted to or show outward and indisputable signs of
&gt; the act in question.  And since you seem to be very close to Bret you might
&gt; want to sit him on your knee and tell him, &quot;But don't accuse a man before
&gt; you know for sure&quot; since he might listen to you.  Either way it really
&gt; doesn't matter to me since I call em' like I see em'.

&gt; Rita
">

What is so unnatural about our friendship?  Has paranoia gotten the
worst of everyone?  Do we live in such a cold society today that such
innocent friendships are frowned upon?  If at anytime Bret feels our
friendship is &quot;unnatural&quot; or uncomfortable, then all he needs to do is
say the word and that will be the end of it.  His is the only opinion
I care about.  I could care less what the newsgroup think about it.
On other newsgroups he has embraced everyone's name calling by feeding
the flame.  Something I personally couldn't do, but Bret is a tough
guy and loves to stir the pot.
If at any time I felt Bret was a pedophile.  Even an inkling, I would
have nothing to do with him.  This is how sure and positive I am.

&gt; LOL! Right.  When was the last time you were intimate with your wife?  Stop

My Dear &quot;Rita,&quot;
I think you give yourself away with every post.  I believe it's called
&quot;transference.&quot;
Most normal people here would look at the pics I posted and think,
&quot;Oh, look at the kids playing soccer. White kids, black kids, boy &amp;
girls all playing together having fun.... what our world should be.&quot;
You look at them and the first thing that you can think of is
molestation.  I'll bet you got a stiffy just looking at them.
So who's the sick one here?

Like D-Mac, you accuse others of the very things you are guilty of. So
it wouldn't surprise me at all if you were the one with the pirated
software. And you are the one who molests children.  And your crack
about my wife probably tells us more than we need to know about your
failed relationships.
And of course, I've already outed you as a racist, which is perhaps
the reason for your latest virulence against me.  Others called you on
it as well so they can look forward to your attacks soon.

Rita, you are nothing but a sick little troll.  Anybody else notice
how Rita's posting frequency decreased as the P&amp;S troll took over?   I
did.
But then I pick up on stuff pretty quickly.
Anyway, I'm done with you.  Go soak in your own piss-filled gutter of
a mind.
And be sure to stock up on your Halloween candy supply for the
kiddies, perv.

As long as you are not reprinting for profitt or any other reason than
editorial or educational and they were taken in a public place, then
no permission is needed.
Now if you sell them or use them in advertising, then you will need
a waiver from the parents. Now if you take the images and sell them
back to the parents to hang on their walls or send them to grandmother
or family, this is a grey area. To cover your backside I would get
release forms filled out and signed.

As the subject of being a molester of children, Annika1980 has shown
nothing in his posts or images indicating his want of underage
children. None of his images show a blantened sexual nature in young
children. Accusing him of this most horrible act is beyond reason.
Rita I am ashamed of you. You have shown some very well done images.
But now I doubt I will ever look at them the same way. You have shown
us what a horrible person you truely are. D-mac may call Annika1980
names and accuse him of being stupid. But, never has he tried to brand
him as a child molester.

As for Annika1980 and Ms Helen friendship, what the frick concern is
it of yours? How can that be any of your business? Are you jealous of
their close friendship? Are you so lonely that you try to destroy
someone else's happiness? Man, are you sad.
I am sorry that you can not see the good world bret wants for

I understand you impatience with such a narrow minded person. But
finding him and the ending his tomorrows do nothing but land you where
Bubba can call you his. I would send some inapropreate mail to his

We get into somewhat of a gray area, but my understanding is that you
can even sell the photos for profit, as long as they are in no way
endorsing anything.  So you could sell they as posters, but not use them
in an ad for a schools systems soccer program.  You could also not use
them as inspirational posters showing the love of god for instance, of
course unless you have release forms on hand.

Still for commercial uses it would be better to have a release.

Well I didn't then, but I do now.  At the time I had no evidence of
your appetite for little boys. It was just payback for you calling me
a software pirate, also without any evidence to support your claims.
However, as things turned out it seems my intuition was right on the
money about you.   You can't even view a pic of kids playing without
thinking of them as sexual objects.  I'll bet you have one of the
largest kiddie porn collections in the Baltimore / D.C. area.
Probably even more than some Republican Congressmen.

The point is that you know nothing about me except what I have led you
to believe. Obviously, you aren't intelligent enough to differentiate
between what is obviously a joke and what is real.  You could say the
same about me knowing you.  However, when you make cracks about
personal things you don't know about (like my wife) it just opens a
window into your true self.  We've already established that you're a
gutless, racist troll.  Now we also know that you'll even sink down

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Besides, you're the child molester here.

&gt;&gt;&gt; LOL! Right.  When was the last time you were intimate with your
&gt;&gt;&gt; wife?  Stop stoking your 40D and spend some time with her.  This way
&gt;&gt;&gt; you might be able to suppress those nasty little urges you have for
&gt;&gt;&gt; the &quot;little ones&quot; you take pictures of.

&gt;&gt; My Dear &quot;Rita,&quot;
&gt;&gt; I think you give yourself away with every post.  I believe it's called
&gt;&gt; &quot;transference.&quot;

&gt; LOL!  No, it's called pegging you perfectly for what you really are.

&gt;&gt; Most normal people here would look at the pics I posted and think,
&gt;&gt; &quot;Oh, look at the kids playing soccer. White kids, black kids, boy &amp;
&gt;&gt; girls all playing together having fun.... what our world should be.&quot;
&gt;&gt; You look at them and the first thing that you can think of is
&gt;&gt; molestation.  I'll bet you got a stiffy just looking at them.
&gt;&gt; So who's the sick one here?

&gt; Yep, and most normal people would get the permission from the children's
&gt; parents before photographing and posting them on the internet.  It's just
&gt; common courtesy and decency.
">

so you have seen the stat dec from the parents saying that he DIDN'T have
permission??
or are you just trolling for a bite, we all know its easy to get Annika to
bite here so realy there are no points for that and your honestly just
showing everyone here what a troll you reaaly are.

&gt; Right.  You seem to have a vivid imagination and a sick one at that.  For
&gt; some odd reason you seem to dwell and have a fixation on pedophilic
&gt; behavior.  Hey, it's not me posting pictures of kids on the internet without
&gt; the permission of their parents.

Excuse me?  I believe you are the one who associates a picture of
children playing soccer with pedophilia.  I wonder why.
Look in a fuckin mirror, dude.

No, I'm done with you Rita and everyone else who takes such joy in
bashing Bret and me.  There is really no point in on-line battles or
to justify Bret and my friendship.  If you want to base your opinion
on jokes Bret said in the past or when he was yanking everyone's
chain, then so be it.  I know the truth about Bret because I actually
know him and I'm proud to call him a very dear friend.

&gt; &gt;I understand you impatience with such a narrow minded person. But
&gt; &gt;finding him and the ending his tomorrows do nothing but land you where
&gt; &gt;Bubba can call you his. I would send some inapropreate mail to his
&gt; &gt;home, office, church and let him squirm as he explains from where they
&gt; &gt;came. Just mail them from his town and not yours. Oh and wear gloves
&gt; &gt;too.

&gt; &gt;Not a suggestion, but just a thought and a smile.

&gt; &gt;Draco

&gt; &gt;Enjoy today.

&gt; &gt;Tomorrow is promised to no one.

&gt; Sure can see why you and Annika get along so well.... no class_and_

Yes we get along because we respect each others words and images. I
may not always agree with Bret. I may not always like his jokes. But
saying we have no class and are chicken s*** to boot. Well that is not
only wrong but a fabrication of your weak mental process.

&gt;&gt; I having trouble working this one out.
&gt;&gt; These are just snapshots any parent is likely to take with a Kodak.
&gt;&gt; What is so special about them that makes a 40D so necessary?

&gt;Needn't worry as most of us are having a hard time working this out as well.
&gt;Sadly the parent of any of these kids didn't take these &quot;Kodak Moments&quot;.  I
&gt;would be more concerned about the photographer's pedophilic tendencies since
&gt;there was no permission obtained to take said photos and post them on the
&gt;internet.   The 40D is a pedophiles dream camera since it is well suited to
&gt;taking candid and coverts of little children without the parents suspecting
&gt;a thing.  They ought to have laws against this despicable behavior and
&gt;punish the perpetrators.

You really are quite a strange person Rita. These comments are quite
weird, if not just plain stupid. I think you should take good long
inward look at yourself.
