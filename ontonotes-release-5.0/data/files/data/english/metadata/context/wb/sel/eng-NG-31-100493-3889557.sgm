Hello everyone,

I figure this only reaches the same 10 people who post here, but I hope
this is appropriate for the forum:

I've got a mostly complete Powerdyne Supercharger (BD-11A 6 PSI,
polished housing) setup for a Magnum-series 318 or 360.  Everything was
purchased used, and it comes with a brand new Walbro 255 lph inline
pump -- all you need to set it up is a few feet of fuel tubing, a
handful of fittings, a safety shut-off switch (I can't be bothered to
remove the one I plumbed ~$10), a few feet of wire, the ability to read
instructions, and about half a day.  All major components and ductwork
are included.  I have the required intake hat for Ram trucks, but
you'll need the Dakota/Durango hold-down if you go with the Ram.  I do
not have any aftermarket boost-retard unit available.

If you're looking to roast some tires down, you've found a solid
answer....no "Vornado"....but I decided I'm no longer interested in
pushing my luck on my driver.  I never installed it on my truck, but
the compressor spins smooth enough that you can feel each cog on the
belt mating to its groove and departing....I'm looking to get out for
what I've got in the assembly -- a solid deal at a grand.  Willing to
ship...so talk it around or make your ride ready for the green light
boogie.
