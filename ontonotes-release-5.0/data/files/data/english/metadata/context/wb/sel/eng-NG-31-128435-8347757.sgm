Impeach Cheney
The Vice President has  run utterly amoke
and must be stopped

June 27, 2007- Under Dick Cheney, the office of the vice  president has been
transformed from a tiny acorn into an unprecedented giant  oak. In grasping
and exercising presidential powers, Cheney has dulled political  accountability
and concocted theories for evading the law and Constitution that  would have
embarrassed King George III. The most recent invention we know of is  the vice
president's insistence that an executive order governing the handling  of
classified information in the executive branch does not reach his office  because
he also serves as president of the Senate. In other words, the vice  president
is a unique legislative-Under Dick Cheney, the office of the vice  president
has been transformed from a tiny acorn into an unprecedented giant  oak. In
grasping and exercising presidential powers, Cheney has dulled political
accountability and concocted theories for evading the law and Constitution that
would have embarrassed King George III. T
Take  the vice president's preposterous theory that his office is outside the
executive branch because it also exercises a legislative function. The same
can  be said of the president, who also exercises a legislative function in
signing  or vetoing bills passed by Congress. Under Cheney's bizarre reasoning,
President  Bush is not part of his own administration: The executive branch
becomes  acephalous. Today Cheney Chief of Staff David Addington refused to
renounce that  reasoning, instead laughably trying to diminish the importance of
the legal  question at issue.
The  nation's first vice president, John Adams, bemoaned: &quot;My country has in
its  wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the
invention of  man contrived or his imagination conceived; and as I can do neither
good nor  evil, I must be borne away by others and meet common fate.&quot; Vice
President John  Nance Garner, serving under President Franklin D. Roosevelt,
lamented: &quot;The vice  presidency isn't worth a pitcher of warm piss.&quot; In modern
times, vice presidents  have generally been confined to attending state funerals
or to distributing  blankets after earthquakes.
Then  President George W. Bush outsourced the lion's share of his presidency
to Vice  President Cheney, and Mr. Cheney has made the most of it. Since 9/11,
he has  proclaimed that all checks and balances and individual liberties are
subservient  to the president's commander in chief powers in confronting
international  terrorism. Let's review the record of his abuses and  excesses:
The  vice president asserted presidential power to create military
commissions, which  combine the functions of judge, jury, and prosecutor in the trial of
war crimes.  The Supreme Court rebuked Cheney in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. Mr.
Cheney claimed  authority to detain American citizens as enemy combatants
indefinitely at  Guantanamo Bay on the president's say-so alone, a frightening power
indistinguishable from King Louis XVI's execrated lettres de cachet that
occasioned the storming of the Bastille. The Supreme Court repudiated Cheney in
Hamdi v. Rumsfeld.
The  vice president initiated kidnappings, secret detentions, and torture in
Eastern  European prisons of suspected international terrorists. This
lawlessness has  been answered in Germany and Italy with criminal charges against CIA
operatives  or agents. The legal precedent set by Cheney would justify a
decision by Russian  President Vladimir Putin to kidnap American tourists in Paris
and to dispatch  them to dungeons in Belarus if they were suspected of Chechen
sympathies.
The  vice president has maintained that the entire world is a battlefield.
Accordingly, he contends that military power may be unleashed to kill or
capture  any American citizen on American soil if suspected of association or
affiliation  with al-Qaida. Thus, Mr. Cheney could have ordered the military to kill
Jose  Padilla with rockets, artillery, or otherwise when he landed at O'Hare
Airport  in Chicago, because of Padilla's then-suspected ties to international
terrorism.
Mr.  Cheney has championed a presidential power to torture in contravention
of  federal statutes and treaties.
He has  advocated and authored signing statements that declare the
president's intent to  disregard provisions of bills he has signed into law that he
proclaims are  unconstitutional, for example, a requirement to obtain a judicial
warrant before  opening mail or a prohibition on employing military force to
fight  narco-terrorists in Colombia. The signing statements are tantamount to
absolute  line-item vetoes that the Supreme Court invalidated in the 1998 case
Clinton v.  New York.
The  vice president engineered the National Security Agency's warrantless
domestic  surveillance program targeting American citizens on American soil in
contravention of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. He
concocted  the alarming theory that the president may flout any law that inhibits the
collection of foreign intelligence, including prohibitions on breaking and
entering homes, torture, or assassinations. As a reflection of his power in
this  arena, today the Senate Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Cheney's office, as
well  as the White House, for documents that relate to the warrantless
eavesdropping.
The  vice president has orchestrated the invocation of executive privilege to
conceal  from Congress secret spying programs to gather foreign intelligence,
and their  legal justifications. He has summoned the privilege to refuse to
disclose his  consulting of business executives in conjunction with his Energy
Task Force, and  to frustrate the testimonies of Karl Rove and Harriet Miers
regarding the  firings of U.S. attorneys.
Cheney  scorns freedom of speech and of the press. He urges application of
the Espionage  Act to prosecute journalists who expose national security abuses,
for example,  secret prisons in Eastern Europe or the NSA's warrantless
surveillance program.  He retaliated against Ambassador Joseph Wilson and his wife,
Valerie Plame,  through Chief of Staff Scooter Libby, for questioning the
administration's freedom of speech and of the press. He urges application of the

Constitution does not expressly forbid the president from abandoning his chief  powers
to the vice president. But President Bush's tacit delegation to Cheney  and
Cheney's eager acceptance tortures the Constitution'&lt;WBR&gt;s provision for an
acting president. The presidency and vice presidency are discrete con
In  contrast, Article II enumerates the powers and responsibilities of the
president, including the obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully
executed. A special presidential oath is prescribed. Section 3 of the 25th
Amendment provides a method for the president to yield his office to the vice
president, when &quot;he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.&quot;
There is no other constitutional provision for transferring presidential
powers  to the vice president.
Yet  without making a written transmittal to Congress, President Bush has
ceded vast  domains of his powers to Vice President Cheney by mutual
understanding that  circumvents the 25th Amendment. This constitutional provision assures
that the  public and Congress know who is exercising the powers of the
presidency and who  should be held responsible for successes or failures. The
Bush-Cheney  dispensation blurs political accountability by continually hiding the
real  decision-maker under presidential skirts. The Washington Post has
thoroughly  documented the vice president's dominance in a four-part series running
this  week. It is quite a read.
In the  end, President Bush regularly is unable to explain or defend the
policies of his  own administration, and that is because the heavy intellectual
labor has been  performed in the office of the vice president. Cheney is
impeachable for his  overweening power and his sneering contempt of the Constitution
and the rule of  law.
