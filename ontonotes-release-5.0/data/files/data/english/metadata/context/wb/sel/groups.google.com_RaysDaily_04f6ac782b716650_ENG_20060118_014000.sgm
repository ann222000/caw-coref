&quot;In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's
there are few.&quot;

Shunryu Suzuki-Roshi

Marika Stone sent me the following recently as part of her newsletter. If
you want to learn more about her, visit her web page,
&lt;http://www.2young2retire.com/&gt; http://www.2young2retire.com/ . I thought you
might like this article as I know few of us are satisfied with the status
quo and could benefit from some homegrown adventure. Ray

As we begin the new year, our thoughts turn to the value of adopting a
beginner's mind. Beginner's mind is a concept invented by Zen master,
Shunryu Suzuki Roshi, to describe a mind that is child-like and 'not already
made up.' It's a curious, inquiring mind, open to what comes, with no
preconceived ideas or expectations. Many of us approach the second half of
life with habits of mind that can hinder or slow down the process of change.
Of course, transition takes time and effort, as well as introspection,
research and some risk-taking. If you're ready to think out of your own
comfort zone and see where it could lead, we offer you Ten Ways to
Experience Beginner's Mind.

* Other-handedness. Spend a few hours, half a day or longer, switching
hands, e.g. Brush your teeth, comb your hair and butter your toast with your
left hand if you're a righty, etc. Practice awareness of how this feels
inside and/or make some notes to yourself.
* Here's a version of the dictionary game that can be revealing about
one's tolerance for not knowing. Open a dictionary and choose a word you are
not familiar with and use as often as you can, in speech or writing, for a
whole day.
* Ask your partner or a trusted friend to blindfold you and lead you
through your own environment for 10 minutes. What did you discover about the
space and its contents when you were dependent on your other senses?
* Attend a service in a religion or denomination different from your
own, e.g. A Buddhist temple or mosque. Take it in, take it all in.
* Sign up for a class in a subject you would normally avoid, math or
accounting, auto mechanics, line dancing, and so on. Note how it felt to be
'lost' in a different world, and what personal resources you had to tap to
hang in there. Note it down and learn.
* Turn the sound off during your favorite TV program and see how much
of the story line you can pick up through lip reading and body language.
What else did you notice?
* Write instructions for an activity that is second nature to you for
a small child or someone whose use of your language is limited. What did you
notice about your sensitivity to another person's age or culture?
* Walk in someone's shoes by shadowing a willing subject for an hour
or two, at their place of work or during a familiar routine. How was it to
just watch? Note it.
* Found poetry. Gather a stack of magazines and a pair of scissors.
Cut words or phrases that interest you into strips and paste them onto a new
sheet in the form of a poem. If images rather than words are your thing, try
Found Art. From your stack of magazines, choose images, words, swatches of
color, logos, anything that appeals to you and create a collage. Note how
this felt while you were doing it, and after it was done.
* Talk to a stranger about anything other than the weather or other
safe subject.
* Get down on all fours and follow a crawling child for 15 or 20
minutes (tip: wear knee pads). What did the world look like from ground
level? What else did you notice? Note it.
* Say &quot;Yes,&quot; the next time you are asked to do something or go
somewhere you'd rather not. How did that feel? Record it.
* Dream up an activity of your own that is totally out of character
for you. White water rafting for the fearful. Drawing for the artistically
challenged. Juggling for just about anyone. Do it for fun, and write about
it after.

Watching her mother as she tried on her new fur coat, young Lora said
unhappily, &quot;Mom, do you realize some poor dumb beast suffered so you could
have that?&quot;

The woman shot her an angry look, &quot;Lora, how dare you talk about your father
like that!&quot;

&quot;In a speech the other day, President Bush said that his economic plan would
help Americans from all walks of life. Bush added, 'My plans will help you
whether you're a billionaire or just a millionaire.'&quot;

I was carpooling with my friend Craig, he noticed that the &quot;Check oil&quot; light
was on. He pulled into the gas station, got out of the car, opened the hood,
checked the engine oil, closed the hood, then got back into the car.

&quot;Can we make a quick stop?&quot; He asked.

&quot;Sure,&quot; I replied, &quot;what did you need to do?&quot;

&quot;I need to stop by the auto parts place to get a longer dipstick?&quot;

&quot;What do you need a longer one for?&quot; I enquired.

&quot;Because the one I got isn't long enough to reach the oil!&quot;

A man who correctly guesses a woman's age may be smart but he's not very
bright.

A friend of mine, a catering manager, lacks certain social skills--like
knowing when to keep her mouth shut!

While discussing a baby christening party with a young couple, she told the
mother,

&quot;You look like you've lost most of your pregnancy weight.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; came the clenched-teeth reply. We adopted.&quot;

&quot;Everybody keeps saying that women are smarter than men,

but did you ever see a man wearing a shirt that buttons down the back?&quot;

A woman meant to call a record store, but dialed the wrong number and got a
private home instead. &quot;Do you have 'Eyes of Blue' and 'A Love Supreme?'&quot; she
asked.

&quot;Well, no,&quot; answered the puzzled homeowner. &quot;But I have a wife and eleven
children.&quot;

&quot;Is that a record?&quot; she inquired, puzzled in her turn.

&quot;I don't think so,&quot; replied the man, &quot;but it's as close as I want to get.&quot;

A diplomat is a person who can tell you to go to hell in such a way that you
actually look forward to the trip.

A guy is at the pearly gates, waiting to be admitted, while St. Peter is
leafing through the big book to see if the guy is worthy of entering.

Saint Peter goes through the book several times, furrows his brow, and says
to the guy, &quot;You know, I can't see that you did anything really good in your
life, but, you never did anything bad either. Tell you what, if you can tell
me of one REALLY good deed that you did in your life, you're in.&quot;

The guy thinks for a moment and says, &quot;Well, there was the time when I was
driving down the highway and I saw a group of biker guys gathered around
this poor girl. I slowed down my car to see what was going on, and sure
enough, there were about 20 of 'em tormenting this girl.&quot;

&quot;Infuriated, I got out my car, grabbed a tire iron out of my trunk, and
walked straight up to the leader of the gang, a huge guy with a studded
leather jacket and a chain running from his nose to his ear. As I walked up
to the leader, the gang formed a circle around me. So, I ripped the leader's
chain off his face and smashed him over the head with the tire iron. Then I
turned around and yelled to the rest of them, 'Leave this poor, innocent
girl alone! You're all a bunch of sick, deranged animals! Go home before I
teach you all a lesson in pain!'&quot;

St. Peter, impressed, says, &quot;Really? When did this happen?&quot;

&quot;Oh, about two minutes ago.&quot;

My childhood was rough. Once for my birthday my old man gave me a bat.

The first day I played with it, it flew away.

Cecil and Morris are walking to services and Cecil asks, &quot;I wonder whether
it would be all right to smoke while praying?&quot;

&quot;Why don't you ask the rabbi?&quot; says Morris.

Cecil sees Rabbi Golden and asks, &quot;Rabbi, is it permissible for me to smoke
while I pray?&quot;

&quot;No, you may not. That's utter disrespect to our religion and traditions!&quot;
quickly answers the rabbi.

Cecil goes back to his friend and tells him what the good Rabbi told him.

&quot;I'm not surprised. You asked the wrong question. Let me try.&quot;

Morris goes over to the rabbi and asks, &quot;Rabbi, will it be ok if I pray
while I smoke?&quot;

To which Rabbi Golden eagerly replies, &quot;By all means, my good man. By all
means.&quot;

&quot;There are two kinds of people who never amount to much:

Those who cannot do what they are told, and those who can do nothing else.&quot;
