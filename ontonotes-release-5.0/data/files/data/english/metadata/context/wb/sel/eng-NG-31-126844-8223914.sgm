for our commercial development, we ought to lose no time in acquiring it.&quot; :

&quot;If the people are not convinced (that the Free World is in mortal danger)
it would be impossible for Congress to vote the vast sums now being spent to
avert danger. With the support of public opinion, as marshalled by the
press, we are off to a good start. It is our Job - yours and mine -- to keep
our people convinced that theonly way to keep disaster away from our shores
is to build up America's might.&quot; -- *Charles Wilson,* Chairman of the Board
of General Electric and Truman appointee to head the Office of Defence
Mobilization, in a speech to the Newspaper Publishers Association, 1950

*Prelude to an Attack on Iran*

*By Robert Baer*

Reports that the Bush Administration will put Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps on the terrorism list can be read in one of two ways: it's
either more bluster or, ominously, a wind-up for a strike on Iran. Officials
I talk to in Washington vote for a hit on the IRGC, maybe within the next
six months.

*Convicting Padilla: Bad News for All Americans*

*By Dave Lindorff*

With habeas corpus a thing of the past, with arrest and detention without
charge permitted, with torture and spying without court oversight all the
rage, with prosecutors free to tape conversations between lawyers and their
clients, and with the judicial branch now infested by rightwing judges who
would have been at home in courtrooms of the Soviet Union or Hitler's
Germany, for all they seem to care about common law tradition, the only real
thing holding the line against absolute tyranny in the U.S. has been the
jury.

*Sheep can never be shepherds*

*Tyranny Of The Few*

*By Mirza Yawar Baig*

The real battle is for mindshare. And it is on the television screen. That
is where governments of the developed world are made or unmade. Popularity
is the god that the West worships. Because popularity translates into money
and power. That is what we have to do; become popular. Setting off fireworks
is not the way to do this. No matter what the provocation.
