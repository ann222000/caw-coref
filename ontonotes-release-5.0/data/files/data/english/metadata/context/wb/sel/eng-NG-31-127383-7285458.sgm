o  Conclusion

We've seen in the previous chapter that the ancient
Persians (or Iranians) produced a leftist, world-saving,
politico-religious movement: Zoroastrianism. And we've seen
how many dramatic similarities there are between
Zoroastrianism and Judaism. Since, as I will show later, it
was the ancient Persians who sponsored Judaism as an even
more radical egalitarian and ethical mass-liberation
movement, the point of understanding where the Persians
came from is to get a sense for the ultimate provenance of
Jewish ideas.

The evidence supports the view that the ancient Iranians
were a development of ancient Indian culture, emerging into
their own as a result of population movements out of the
Indian subcontinent, where civilization began. However,
this is poorly understood because for the last 150 years a
remarkably tenacious but unsupported theory of Indian
history has been taught in the West. It has also been
taught in India, because the dominant educational system
there was set up by the British colonialists and did not
undergo significant changes after independence. This
mistaken picture of Indian history is a direct product of
nineteenth-century European politics --  especially German
politics, combined with the colonial and missionary
interests of the British Empire. It has little to do with
India.

At this point you may be thinking that you can no longer be
shocked, because you have already seen, after all, the
radical manner in which Western historians have distorted
beyond recognition the history of both ancient Greeks and
Persians. This has been a matter of putting an absurd and
radical spin on things, with the result that all the
important political meanings -- of words, of events, of
ideology, etc. -- are represented precisely upside down. In
the Indian case, believe it or not, we have something that
is arguably more extreme: outright fabrication by scholars.

What this book does for Western historiography has already
been done for Indian historiography (or 'Indology' as this
field has been called in the West) -- luckily for me. A decade
ago, Navaratna S. Rajaram and David Frawley refuted the so-
called 'Aryan invasion theory' of ancient India by
exhaustively pointing out what should have been obvious all
along: not one shred of evidence agrees with it. And yet
quite a few people are still defending the 'Aryan invasion
theory' in the year 2005, so I will here briefly review its
refutation, there to establish what the real origin of the
Persians was.

166
Since Rajaram and Frawley, and more recently Koenraad Elst,
have already done the hard work, and since this is not the
main topic of my book, I will be relying heavily on them.
Interested readers are welcome to consult their detailed
demonstrations if they wish to examine this issue further.
That said, I will devote some space, at the end, to
examining how defenders of the 'Aryan invasion theory' have
responded to these recent challenges, the better to
increase your confidence that the 'Aryan invasion theory'
cannot be defended.

The 'Aryan invasion theory'

There was once an ancient people, the 'Indo-Europeans,' or
'Aryans,' who were nomadic herders and warriors somewhere
in Central Asia.

They were a white-skinned, blond, and blueeyed race. These
Aryans suddenly burst forth from this place in Central
Asia, or perhaps it was somewhere in Eastern Europe
(anyway, but somewhere landlocked such that they didn't
even know about the ocean). Wherever they went, they
conquered, and made everybody their servants, because they
were great warriors and also very smart (blondes, after
all). Some Aryan tribes traveled West, and became the
ancestors of the modern Europeans, and other Aryans
traveled south to the Indus Valley where, around 1500 BCE,
they easily defeated the materially advanced Harappan
civilization, which had drainage and water supply systems
that even the Romans, much later, would not quite match.
And yet the Harappans somehow did not produce any
literature, perhaps because they were dark-skinned, and
hence, in the end, not very bright. Although the Aryans
completely destroyed the advanced Harappan civilization,
these victorious white nomads -- as if by magic, and despite
the fact that they were illiterate when they arrived -- almost
immediately produced a classic work of literature to
celebrate their victory over the Harappans, the Rigveda, in
a language so perfect that computer scientists are now
turning to it for insights. In Europe, the Germans are the
purest descendants of these ancient Aryans, but all the
peoples of Europe whose languages show similarities with
Sanskrit are likewise descendants of the Aryans, and this
explains those similarities.

All of these languages together are called 'Indo-European.'
Where do the Iranians fit in? They belong to the Indo-
European language family, so they are also descendants of
the Aryans. Or else of the Indo-Aryans -- or Indo-Iranians. In
other words, there was an ancestral group, the Indo-
Iranians, which itself was descended from the Indo-
Europeans (or Aryans), and it split, and some of them went
to Iran and became the Iranians, and the others went to the
Indus Valley and became the Indo-Aryans.

That about sums it up. I think I got it right.

Please resist any urge to laugh at this theory. It is the
theory that helped unify Germany, and one reason it was
popular as a unifying myth was that it yielded a story of
origins where the wonderful ancestors of the German people
were not Jews, and therefore a welcome alternative, in an
antisemitic culture looking for a national myth, to the
Christian story of origins, which is Jewish. As is famously
known, this 'Aryan invasion theory' later became a favorite
of the German Nazis, which is why they talked incessantly
of their 'Aryan superiority' and moreover borrowed the
swastika of the ancient

167
Indians as a symbol, though they did not borrow its
meaning.

This is also the theory that has been taught in the West,
until now, as the history of India, and it is taught in
India still today as the mainstream theory. Not a shred of
evidence agrees with it.

This is serious.

How the 'Aryan invasion theory' came to be As the Catholic
ex-priest James Carroll (2001) has detailed in
Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews, European
Christians have, for a tragically long time, denigrated and
reduced the living Jews among them, oppressing them
alternatively with genocide, inquisition, forced
conversion, expulsion, genocide . . . The same history has
inflicted, on Christians, a profound intellectual
awkwardness: the ancient 'heroic age' of Christianity is
Jewish! It just doesn't feel comfortable, in an antisemitic
civilization, that one's story of origins should be Jewish;
or that this story should be so much longer than the
Christian 'New Testament'; or that it should be so much
more interesting and fun to read. But it cannot be avoided,
because Christianity claims to have developed out of
ancient Judaism.

It is remarkable that this absurd state of affairs has
remained stable for so long, but signs that it would not
remain so forever began to appear in the eighteenth
century. At this time, many European intellectuals began
looking for a way out, and tried to give themselves an
ancient 'heroic age' that would not be Jewish. Navaratna S.
Rajaram explains that, The humanist movement now known as
the European Renaissance was followed by voyages of
discovery in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
leading to greatly increased trade and colonizing
activities. This had resulted in Europe becoming aware of
the richness, antiquity and the complexities of Indian
history and culture. As Jim Shaffer notes:

"Many scholars such as Kant and Herder, began to draw
analogies between the myths and philosophies of ancient
India and the West. In their attempt to separate Western
European culture from its Judaic heritage, many scholars
were convinced that the origin of Western culture was to be
found in India rather than in the ancient Near East."
(Shaffer 1984:80)

At the time, skin color in particular was also capturing
the European imagination, because colonialism brought close
contact with dark-skinned peoples whom the Europeans, with
their more effective weaponry, had subjugated. So the story
these conquering Europeans came up with became that, in
ancient times, mirroring the contemporary experience, the
socalled 'Aryan race' -- blond, blue-eyed, and white-skinned --
had burst forth from Central Asia and invaded everything,
becoming the ruling class in India, Iran, and Europe,
replacing the dark-skinned natives just as the modern
Europeans in colonial times were subjugating the dark-
skinned natives everywhere else.

168
Not exactly original.

It was German intellectuals with a nationalist bent who
became most interested in this alternative 'heroic age'
story of origins, the better to coalesce around it in
pride. Why? Because, for a long time, the Germans had been
divided into small principalities rather than unified into
a single state, and in consequence were pushed around by
the other European powers. The 'Aryan race' theory was a
convenient and unifying alternative myth of origins with
which the German nationalists were able to stir the
imagination of the German masses to mobilize together
politically. The theory became popular all over 'Nordic'
Europe, but the German nationalists claimed special
ownership over this theory by saying that the Germans were
the 'purest' descendants of the original Aryans.

As a dominant European power, the British had zero interest
in fostering German unification -- and yet they
accidentally did just that, by sponsoring the 'Aryan race'
theory. Here is how it happened.

The British were looking for ways to undermine Indian
culture and pride in order more effectively to rule India.
For example, in 1831, Colonel Boden bequeathed to Oxford
University his entire fortune -- worth £25,000 -- to create
the Boden Professorship of Sanskrit, the explicit purpose
of which was to promote knowledge of Sanskrit among
Englishmen so as "to enable his countrymen to proceed in
the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian
religion" (quoted in Rajaram 1995:71). More significantly,
"as chairman of the Education Board," Thomas Babbington
Macaulay (1800-1859) "was instrumental in establishing a
network of modern English schools in India, the principal
goal of which was the conversion of Hindus to Christianity"
( ibid. p.105). This is not speculation: in a letter to his
father in 1836, Macauley wrote, It is my belief that if our
plans of education are followed up, there will not be a
single idolater among the respectable classes in Bengal
thirty years hence. And this will be effected without any
efforts to proselytize, without the smallest interference
with religious liberty, by natural operation of knowledge
and reflection. I heartily rejoice in the project. --
quoted in Rajaram (1995:105) 1 Macauley was obviously a
narrow Christian chauvinist, convinced of the superiority
of Christian doctrine. And yet he was not so self-assured
that he felt comfortable with a level playing field: to
ensure that the Brahmins would become Christians, he
"wanted someone willing and able to interpret Indian
scriptures in such a way that the newly educated Indian
elite would see for itself the difference between their
scriptures and the New Testament and choose the latter" (
ibid. p.106). It was in Germany that Sanskrit studies were
flourishing the most, so Macauley eventually recruited a
German scholar to make a translation of the Vedic
scriptures that would undermine Indian religion. That he
selected his man with care may be inferred from the fact
that it took him fifteen years to find him: the ardent
German nationalist and Sanskrit scholar Max Muller.

Given that the rise of German Prussia as a European power
was then worrying the British, and given the fateful 1
Clive, J. 1975. Macauley: The shaping of a historian. New
York: Viking. (pp.412-13)

169 consequences of Max Muller's work for Prussian
expansion, it is ironic that it was the Prussian
ambassador, Christian Karl Hosias, who brought the 31-year-
old Muller to meet Thomas Babbington Macauley, the man who
would become his British sponsor. It was hardly fitting for
a German nationalist to assist the British in their efforts
to turn themselves into an even more formidable
international power, but Max Muller was also a devout
Protestant Christian -- and hard up. So, for the sake of
Christianity, and for the sake of his own economic
stability, he accepted payment from the British East India
Company for the work that Macauley commissioned ( ibid.
pp.106-107). A letter that he wrote to his wife in 1866
shows that Max Muller took his Christian mission seriously:

. . .this edition of mine and the translation of the Veda,
will hereafter tell to a great extent on the fate of India
and on the growth of millions of souls in that country. It
[the Vedic scripture] is the root of their religion and to
show them what that root is, I feel sure, is the only way
of uprooting all that has sprung from it during the last
three thousand years.

Rajaram quotes the above passage and comments that, since
Muller had no particular reason to misrepresent his motives
in a private letter to his wife, we may take the above as a
sincere expression of his intent ( ibid. p.108). I think
that's reasonable. Rajaram ( ibid. p.114) also quotes a
letter that Muller wrote to N.K. Majumdar, an Indian social
reformer, late in his life:

The first thing you have to do is to settle how much of
your ancient religion you are willing to give up, if not as
utterly false, still as antiquated;  . . .Tell me some of
the chief difficulties that prevent you and your countrymen
from openly following Christ, and when I write to you I
shall do my best to explain how I and many who agree with
me have met them, and solved them . . . (In Devi Chand
1988:xxvi-xxvii) This leaves little doubt that Muller's
purpose was to undermine Indian belief, which is hardly a
recommendation for someone who is supposed to be a
scholarly authority on Indian beliefs, and the author of
the Vedic translation that many scholars still today are
using.

In one sense Macauley's effort was highly successful,
because the upper-class Indians whom Macauley targeted
responded very well to British-style education -- except
that they didn't convert to Christianity. But if Macauley
failed to undermine Indian religion, he did manage to
create a new religion in Europe, because Muller's work was
a huge log in the fire of the 'Aryan race' theory.

Though he was not the only one or the first German
nationalist to do this, Muller interpreted the words 'Arya'
and 'Aryan,' which appear repeatedly in the Rigveda, as
referring to a race -- the ancestral 'Aryan race' to which
the German nationalists were learning to imagine themselves
as the purest descendants. Thus, for example, "in 1861 he
gave a series of lectures under the title 'Science of
Languages' in which he made extensive use of Vedic hymns to
show that the Vedic words Arya and Aryan were used to mean
a race of people" (ibid. p.109). This completely
contradicts the way in which these words are used in the
original Sanskrit. For this distortion Muller bears a
special responsibility because, "Unlike most other German
romantics and nationalists, he as a Sanskrit

170
scholar was fully aware that in Sanskrit, Arya does not
refer to any race "(ibid.; original emphasis). Not all
Sanskrit scholars followed Muller in this. For example,
"Shlegel, no less a romantic or German nationalist always
used the word Aryan to mean 'honorable' or 'noble' which is
much closer to the original Sanskrit in meaning" (ibid.
p.110). But the interpretation of the Aryans as a supposed
race was more influential by far. And it matters, because
it was the claim that the ancient Sanskrit texts speak of a
supposed Aryan race --  when they don't -- that became the
basis for the belief that there had ever existed such a
race or people.

As it turned out, Max Muller was very successful with this
'Aryan race' stuff, and the emerging ideology was
instrumental to Otto von Bismarck's push to create a
unified German empire by extending the borders of his
native Prussia.

Ever since the 1700s, when Frederick I of Prussia had
"raised the army to 80,000, effectively making the whole
state a military machine," 1 Prussia had been, as in the
case of the ancient Greeks, though not quite as extreme,
society as army.

Though Prussia had lost -- like everybody else -- to
Napoleon Bonaparte, by the time it provoked a war with
France in 1870-71 (after provoking wars with Denmark and
Austria), it was again a redoubtable fighting machine. The
outcome of the Franco-Prussian war was a resounding victory
for Prussia, 1 "Prussia." Britannica Student Encyclopedia

which then allowed its leader, Bismarck, to annex the south
German principalities, creating Germany. In order to expand
Prussia's borders to create the German Empire or 'Reich,'
Bismarck appealed to the German speaking peoples of Europe
in a way that shows the importance of the 'Aryan race'
theory of German origins:

Bismarck's famous exhortation to the German people, over
the heads of their particular political leaders, to 'think
with your blood' was a[n] . . .attempt to activate a mass
psychological vibration predicated upon an intuitive sense
of consanguinity.

An unstated presumption of a Chinese (or German) nation is
that there existed in some hazy, prerecorded era a Chinese
(or German) Adam and Eve, and that the couple's progeny has
evolved in essentially unadulterated form down to the
present. -- Connor (1994[1978]: 93-94) The Germans were
learning to think of themselves as the exalted pure
descendants of an Aryan -- not Jewish -- Adam and Eve: the 'Aryan
race.' This worked so well that even in Austria, which was
then a major power in Europe, a movement grew among the
German-speakers to join 'Germany.' For example, "a large
part of the membership [of the student fraternity Deutsche
Lesehalle in Vienna] insisted on Austria's subservience to
Germany . . .and supported Austria's eventual union with
Bismarck's militant empire" (Elon 1975:52). This view was
widespread. As is well known, the mood of nineteenth
century pan-German nationalism continued into the twentieth
century, making Adolf Hitler's bloodless annexation of his
native Austria -- under the banner of a now truly assertive
'Aryan race' ideology -- relatively easy.

171
German nationalism produced a tragic irony: "Many, if not
most, Jewish students in Austria were ardent German
patriots" (Elon 1975:53). In fact, hardly anybody was more
infatuated with German culture than the German-speaking
Jews: "many Jewish intellectuals were dazzled by the rise
of German power under Bismarck" ( ibid.). It took these
Jews a long time to recognize the dangers to them inherent
in German power, something that can be dramatically
appreciated by the fact that one of the Austrian Jews who
most firmly believed himself to be 'German,' and who was
initially most in love with the rise of Germany, was
Theodore Herzl, the very man who in time would create the
Zionist movement to protect the European Jewish population
from the antisemitic violence that he finally realized
would engulf his people. And yet German nationalism was
clearly antisemitic, based on the 'Aryan race' theory that
exalted white skin, blue eyes, and yellow hair, and
explicitly desired to exclude Jews: "'Nowadays one must be
blond,' Herzl wrote in a revealing note found among his
papers from that time" ( ibid. p.54). Herzl's own pro-
German fraternity, Albia, soon became a nest of
antisemites, and in March of 1883 he resigned in anger (
ibid. pp.60-61) -- but it was a while still before he
became seriously worried for the fate of the Jews, and
despite the eventual success of his belatedly feverish and
heroic efforts to create a Jewish homeland, his dire
predictions would find themselves confirmed in the
twentieth-century German assault against the Jewish people.

The Western Jewish naivete before the growing German threat
appears to many, in hindsight, remarkable; but proper --
i.e., historically informed -- hindsight produces an
exactly opposite assessment: this was normal. Herzl's
biographer, Amos Elon, writes that "Never was an attachment
by a minority [German-speaking Jews] to a majority
[Germans] so strong" (1975:53), and yet the modern Jewish
attachment to and infatuation with the United States is
arguably stronger, despite the fact that US foreign policy
towards Israel in the twentieth-century, and into the
twenty-first, has been a series of stunningly vicious
attacks, something the Jews appear entirely blind to, but
of which I have now given a book-length demonstration.

1 Anybody who has read historian Christopher Simpson's 1988
work, which documents, with material obtained through the
Freedom of Information Act, that US Intelligence was
created after the World War by absorbing in secret tens of
thousands of Nazi war criminals, cannot be surprised that
US foreign policy has prepared the impending destruction of
the Jewish state.

2 But most Jews have not read 1 "Is the US an ally of

Simpson's book, and so they are fulfilling George
Santayana's dire prediction that "those who cannot remember
the past are condemned to repeat it." Indeed, just as many
Western Jews in the nineteenth century decided, absurdly,
to embrace antisemitism rather than abandon their German
patriotism, tragically destroying themselves, today many
Jews inside and outside of Israel have turned themselves
into enemies of the Jewish state by supporting the foreign
policy of the United States, or else (or simultaneously) by
supporting the PLO, whose controlling core (Al Fatah) was
created by Hajj Amin al Husseini, mentor to Yasser Arafat,
and earlier one of the top leaders of Adolf Hitler's Final
Solution.1 These Jews represent their historically ignorant
and politically absurd behaviors to themselves, in honest
delusion, as 'peace-seeking,' not realizing that
antisemitism has to be fought (for it will not be appeased)
2; but they are once again assisting their own 1 "How did

As the Jewish author Kenneth Levin has tried to explain in
The Oslo Syndrome: Delusions of a People Under Siege
(2005), such behaviors are instances of the famous Jewish
'self-hatred,' a tragic phenomenon that destruction, and
that of their more patriotic brethren. The predictable
result will be another Catastrophe.

Returning to our main thread, I note that if Max Muller was
dramatically successful promoting the theory of the 'Aryan
race,' he also spat into the wind. Something funny happened
as a result of the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71. I don't
mean the war itself, and certainly not the barbaric
behavior of the Germans in occupied France, but rather its
effects on British perceptions and in turn on poor Max
Muller.

About the impact of Sanskrit studies on German nationalism,
"Sir Henry Maine, an influential Anglo-Indian scholar and
former Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University pronounced a
view that many Englishmen shared about the unification of
Germany: ' . . .a nation has been born out of Sanskrit'
(Sathe 1991:13)" (Rajaram & Frawley 1997:29-30).

The British had so far been amused by the romantic German
attachment to Sanskrit, but after the 'unification of
Germany' they took a different view:

German unification was followed in England by an outburst
of British patriotism in which the hapless Max Muller found
himself having to walk a political tightrope. As already
noted, ideas about the Aryan race and culture were being
seen by the British as having played a significant part in
German nationalism that led to unification; the two ideas
-- the Aryan nation and German unification -- were
afflicts all systematically oppressed populations (e.g.
blacks in the US have their 'uncle Tom's').

173
inseparable in the public mind. -- Rajaram
(1995:111)

In other words, the vigorous British waving of the Union
Jack in reaction to Bismarck's success, plus the reasonable
British perception that the 'Aryan race' theory of
Sanskritists had helped produce this competing and fearsome
military power, was the sort of thing to make the most
important German Sanskritist, then in the employ of the
British government, and permanently installed in Britain,
less comfortable. So, to play it safe in his British
environment, it was advisable for Max Muller to backpedal
from his earlier claims about an 'Aryan race.' Thus,
following the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian war in
1871, in a big rush, Max Muller put together what became
the linguistic as opposed to the racial theory of Aryan
origins.

He placed the original Aryan ancestors in Samarkand in the
Trans-Oxus region in Central Asia north of Kashmir.
According to this new theory, actually a linguistic
reincarnation of the old race theory, one branch migrated
southeast into Iran, Afghanistan and India to become the
Indo-Iranians, while a second branch migrated southwest and
went on to become the Greeks and the Europeans. As support
he claimed that the original Aryans were landlocked and
immobile and therefore had no notion of the sea or any word
for fish. But he overlooked the elementary fact that both
Iran and Afghanistan lie not to the southeast of Samarkand
but to the southwest. Further, Afghanistan has always been
culturally and linguistically an extension of
India.compounding the absurdity, Max Muller failed to note
that several species of fish including such staple
varieties as katala and loch are found in Samarkand.

Looking at it today, the extraordinary shoddiness with
which his new theory was put together is astounding. In his
rush to dissociate himself from the Aryan race theory, Max
Muller had succeeded in creating the most absurd
contradiction imaginable:

The Aryans of Central Asia were so immobile that they were
ignorant of the ocean only a few hundred miles away, and
fish found even closer. And yet they were so fleet of foot
(or horse) that they managed to spread over a vast stretch
from Ireland to the east coast of India. As one of his
recent critics put it: "Max Muller has made as many
mistakes as is possible to make in one argument." 1 Nothing
but extreme haste can account for so preposterous a theory
from a scholar of his standing. -- Rajaram (1995:116) From
this point onwards, Max Muller never wavered:

"Just as he had been using the word Aryan in the racial
sense for twenty years until 1871, for the next thirty
years he was insistent that Aryan could only refer to a
language family or culture, but to little or no avail" (
ibid. p.110). To little or no avail . . .

There is a reason for that. Max Muller's contemporaries
were obsessed with the idea of 'race,' and this is
precisely why such an idea had proved instrumental in
'unifying Germany' in the first place. To help you

the ideological climate that produced an obsession with
race, allow me a short detour.

A short detour: whence the obsession with 'race'?

The Encyclopedia Britannica summarizes the eighteenth and
nineteenth century theorizing about 'race' as follows:

Major proponents of the ideology of race inequality were
the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, the French
philosopher Voltaire, the Scottish philosopher and
historian David Hume, and the influential American
political philosopher Thomas Jefferson. These writers
expressed negative opinions about Africans and other
"primitives" based on purely subjective impressions or
materials gained from secondary sources, such as travelers,
missionaries, and explorers . . .

During the same period, influenced by taxonomic activities
of botanists and biologists that had begun in the 17th
century, other European scholars . . .[went about]
classifying all peoples into "natural" groupings, as had
been done with other flora and fauna.  . . .it was the
classifications developed by the Swedish botanist Carolus
Linnaeus and the German physiologist Johann Friedrich
Blumenbach that provided the models for modern racial
classifications.

"race." Encyclopaedia Britannica from Encyclopaedia
Britannica Online.

Linnaeus was involved in systematizing all of the world's
species. Applying this method to humans, both he and
Blumenbach thought they could see natural divisions within
the human species, and tried to derive a systematic
classification of different human 'types.' Unsurprisingly,
given that at this time Europeans were subjugating and
enslaving dark-skinned people all over the world, these
classifications assigned to the 'European type' -- or
'whites' -- the most exalted place in the classification of
humanity. By this means a pseudo-moral argument was
produced that justified the oppression of non-'whites.'
From the scientific point of view all this 'race science'
was a monumental waste of time. Rajaram & Frawley (1997:27)
quote the geneticist S.K. Mahajan, who says that "In spite
of the great labors of the race scientists, their work has
mostly been forgotten. The emergence of Molecular Biology
of genes has proved it to be false." Following that, they
comment:

A modern researcher today can scarcely have an idea of the
enormous output of these race scientists, output that in
sheer quantity (and value) can only be compared to that of
medieval theologians who produced volume upon massive
volume on such important topics as the number of angels
that could dance on the head of a pin. The home of this
crackpot discipline was Germany, with French savants like
Comte Joseph de Gobineau not far behind. It was such men as
these that gave

currency to the concept of the Aryan race. It was Max
Muller's friend E. Renan who popularized the term 'Aryan'
in France. This was the climate in which Sanskrit studies
became highly popular in nineteenth century Europe,
especially Germany, the home of Indology for over a
century.

Neither Rajaram nor Frawley were trained by a Western
social-science department; in consequence, they can be
excused for their spectacular naivete on this point,
because in fact many modern 'researchers' --still today --
are energetically involved in 'race science,' contrary to
what Rajaram and Frawley appear to think, and they continue
to produce an "enormous output." This sham discipline never
died, though of course Rajaram and Frawley are correct that
modern genetics has thoroughly refuted the claim that the
human species can be divided into biological races.

The most important modern incarnation of 'race science' is
IQ testing, of which I have given a book-length refutation
in Resurrecting Racism: The Modern Attack on Black People
Using Phony Science (the same book explains the genetic
data that refutes the idea of human 'races').

1 IQ testing
as it is still practiced today was invented by the leaders
of the American eugenics movement in the early twentieth
century, whose goal was to develop a measure that would
make the Western upper classes look smart, and members of
the lower classes look stupid, the better to give apparent
support to the

argument that whole categories of people needed to be
exterminated in order (supposedly) to protect the human
species from bad 'germ plasm.' The point of this argument
was to hold a sword over the working classes, which in the
second half of the nineteenth century, and the beginning of
the first, were becoming politically quite assertive. Not
coincidentally, as historian Edwin Black (2003) has
documented in War against the weak: Eugenics and America's
campaign to create a master race, the eugenicists were
organized and financed by the wealthiest families in the
Western world (the Carnegies, the Rockefellers, the
Harrimans . . .) in collusion with the US government. It is
significant that some of this money was going to the German
Nazis, whose extermination ideology had been borrowed from
the same American eugenicists, as Black also documents.
Again not coincidentally, the eugenicists developed so-
called IQ measures designed to test the culture of the
Western upper-classes, whose money was backing this effort.

This naturally guaranteed that these upper classes would
come out looking as though they were naturally superior,
mentally, and with the claim that the tests were supposedly
measuring 'innate intelligence,' they got to forcibly
sterilize or incarcerate hundreds of thousands of innocent
Americans whom these tests supposedly identified as
'feeble-minded,' and hence a genetic danger to the species.
And yet despite the fundamental fraud involved in the
structure of the tests themselves, the IQ testers have
obviously been somewhat insecure, because they have
resorted to faking their data, fudging their math, and even
inventing non-existent researchers under whose phantom
names studies that were never carried out were nevertheless
published, as I document in Resurrecting Racism.

176
As the above would suggest, the leaders of the eugenics
movement, in tandem with the anti-worker ideology that
produced IQ testing, partook also of a form of racism in
which the favorite category was not 'white' but Nordic, as
in Germans, Scandinavians, Britons, and French, in
opposition to the Irish, Mediterraneans, and Slavs.
'Nordic,' of course, is just another word for 'Aryan' in
this ideology: eugenics and IQ testing were an early
twentieth-century extension of the nineteenth-century 'race
science.' German Nazi ideology in the twentieth century,
which was one version of the international eugenics
movement, was also, in particular, an outgrowth of the
nineteenth century 'Aryan race' theory, which was now used
to mobilize the Germans -- the purest 'Nordics' according
to this ideology -- against the very Jews whom the theory
had been designed to extirpate from the German cosmological
firmament in the first place.

Though it is no longer politically correct to defend
eugenics, due to the revulsion that the German Nazi
genocide of the Jewish people produced, in its IQ-testing
form the eugenics movement has endured and enjoyed great
success.

The SAT, a descendant of the 'Army Alpha' IQ test that had
been designed by some of the most extreme racists among the
American eugenicists, and administered to vast multitudes
of US soldiers in order to assign their ranks, has become a
nearuniversal requirement for application to a college
education in the United States, with predictable
consequences for the lower classes whom these tests were
designed to disadvantage. And IQ testing continues to be
rampant all over US society. People routinely speak of
their supposed 'intelligence' in terms of wholly
meaningless IQ scores and pretend they understand what they
are talking about.

So, coming back to Rajaram and Frawley, if these authors
were aware that an entire branch of widely
institutionalized twentieth-century 'psychology' is nothing
more than racist snake oil, they would be much less
surprised that the entire field of 'Indology' has survived
into the twentyfirst century despite being little more than
a nineteenth-century racist -- and, not insignificantly,
antisemitic -- fraud.

Perhaps it is worth pointing out that the eighteenth- and
nineteenth-century obsession with the concept of 'race' --
the belief that the culture and language of a people are a
product of their unchangeably racial (i.e. biological)
nature, together with a distinctive physique supposedly
discontinuous with that of other populations -- is not a
radical idiosyncrasy of the Europeans. I have taken pains
in my own work to show that people everywhere easily
imagine, erroneously, that cultural differences are
supposedly biological, due to perceptual and cognitive
biases that distort our perception of human variation.

This is a bit like the way our perspective makes the Earth
appear flat when it isn't. What happened in eighteenth- and
nineteenth-century Europe is that these cognitive and

reified as if 'science' -- then fast becoming popular --had
established their justice. But this was a sham science.

Once the extremely 'race'-conscious pseudo-scientific
climate of the European eighteenth and nineteenth century,
still with us, is understood, it is clear why the search
for a heroic age that would not be Jewish -- especially in
the case of the German nationalists --  produced an
explicitly racist account: the 'Aryan race' theory.

invasion.' This was pointed out a long time ago by F.E.

works chronicling the ruling dynasties of India: "Vedic
literature says, I believe, nothing about the entrance of
the Aryans from the north-west into India" (quoted in
Rajaram 1995:153). Since the Puranas say nothing about
this, the only 'support' for this supposed invasion came
from Max Muller's interpretation of the most ancient Vedic
work: the Rigveda.

According to Max Muller, the Rigveda's account of a battle
between the forces of light and darkness was describing a
conflict between invading light-skinned people and the
darkskinned natives whom they defeated. And this invasion,
he said, happened around the year 1500 BCE.

How did he come up with this date?

Max Muller believed firmly in the Biblical interpretation
that the world was created on October 23, 4004 BCE. "[A]s
late as 1875, Max Muller himself wrote to the Duke of
Argyll: 'I look upon the account of creation given in the
Genesis as simply historical'" ( ibid. pp.95, 98). This
naturally had a constraining effect on the chronology that
he produced, and which assigned the Rigveda, the earliest
of the ancient Indian scriptures, to the period 1200 to
1000 BCE. For you see, the date of The Flood, by the
Biblical reckoning, was 2448 BCE. As Rajaram explains,
"Allowing another 1000 years for the waters to subside and
for the ground to get dry enough for the mounted Aryan
tribes to begin their invasion of India, brings us inside
of 1500 BCE for the invasion" (ibid. p.95).

Max Muller then went looking for something -- anything --in
the old Indian works that would support his chronology. He
found it in a collection of fairy tales written by Somadeva
of Kashmir around 1060 CE, which is to say more than 2000
years after the supposed invasion that Muller was

178 attempting to date. In addition, I point out that
"[Somadeva] himself records that his stories were written
to entertain Survayati, the wife of King Ananta of Kashmir"
( ibid. p.93) --so even the author did not claim they had
any historical value.

But never mind that, because the way Muller used Somadeva's
fairy tales is quite preposterous enough all by itself. In
one of Somadeva's stories, there is a one-eyed ghost who
claims that one Vararuchi, who in the story is the minister
of the Magadhan ruler Nanda, was a reincarnation of a
certain Katyayana. Max Muller somehow decided that this was
the same Katyayana as a Vedic commentator from the Sutra
period of the same name, and therefore that this Vedic
commentator was a contemporary of Nanda. "Since Nanda is
thought to have lived in the 4 th century BCE, Max Muller
assigned the Sutra literature to the period around Nanda.
His own imagination did the rest" (ibid. p.92).

I will clarify. Somadeva's story does not say that
Katyayana was a contemporary of Nanda, but only that
Katyayana's reincarnation, Vararuchi, was. So Max Muller,
in contradiction to what the story stated, decided that
Vararuchi was not really the reincarnation of Katyayana,
but Katyayana himself, and moreover that this was not just
any Katyayana, but specifically the Vedic commentator from
the Sutra period of the same name, an identification that
the story nowhere makes.

And yet things can get crazier still: Max Muller himself
noted that his reckoning was a bit uncertain because the
Southern Buddhists substituted Chandragupta for Nanda (
ibid. p.93), so he did not even have a stable fairy tale to
misinterpret! But there is more. Having thus 'fixed' the
Sutra literature to the period 600 to 200 BCE, which
captures the fourth century Nanda, Muller worked his way
backwards, producing the following chronology ( ibid.
p.91):
Work Time of Composition
Rigveda 1200 to 1000
BCE
Mantras 1000 to 800
BCE
Brahmanas 800 to 600
BCE
Sutras 600 to 200
BCE
It's all very neat, every time a period of 200 years
(except for the last one), and always perfectly
consecutive. How did Muller come up with the other dates?
He didn't bother to misinterpret a one-eyed ghost story
from the eleventh century for those -- he just made them
up.

As you might expect, Muller's chronology did not escape
criticism in his time, to which he replied with a radical
disclaimer:

I need hardly say that I agree with every one of my
critics. I have repeatedly dwelt on the entirely
hypothetical character of the dates which I venture to
assign to the first three periods of the Vedic literature.
All I have claimed for them is that they are minimum dates.
If now we ask how we can fix the date of these three
periods, it is quite clear that we cannot fix a terminus a
quo. Whether the Vedic hymns were composed 1000, 1500 or
2000 or 3000 BC, no power on earth will ever determine. --
quoted in Rajaram (1995:94)

179
In fact, powers on earth can determine it, but it is
noteworthy that in the above Max Muller completely
repudiated his own "entirely hypothetical" chronology.

But there is still room for astonishment. In the year 1954,
historian of India A.L. Basham was writing as follows:

The earliest Indian literary source we possess is the
Rigveda, most of which was composed in the second half of
the 2 nd millennium [i.e. 1500 BCE to 1000 BCE]. It is
evidently the work of an invading people, who have not yet
fully subjugated the original inhabitants of N.-W. India.
. .The invaders of India called themselves Aryas, a word
generally Anglicized into Aryans . . .  . . .[Here is the
theory] which seems to us most reasonable, and which, we
believe, would be accepted by a majority of those who
specialize in the subject. About 2000 BCE the great
steppeland which stretches from Poland to Central Asia was
inhabited by semi-nomadic barbarians, who were tall,
comparatively fair, and mostly long-headed.  . . .They
migrated in bands westwards, southwards and eastwards,
conquering local populations, and intermarrying with them
to form a ruling class. -- Basham (1954:28-29) None of this
was being defended in 1954; it was stated in passing that
the "most reasonable" scenario, and the one "accepted by
the majority of those who specialize on the subject," was
still Max Muller's nonsense.

But add another half century and still nothing changes.

Romila Thapar, another prominent historian, also of Indian
nationality, wrote the following in 1992: The generally
accepted chronology is that the Rig Vedic hymns were
composed over a period from about 1500 BCE to 1000 BCE . .
-- quoted in Rajaram (1995:91) In other words, at the
turn of the twenty-first century, the "generally accepted
chronology" -- even by historians who happened to be Indian
nationals -- was still the nonsense used to support the
'Aryan invasion theory' and which, over one hundred years
ago, even the original Max Muller had decided not to
defend. Scholars who endorse this chronology such as Basham
and Thapar nowhere demonstrate the validity of this dating,
which they have inherited from Max Muller -- they just
state it. They can get away with this because it is the
"generally accepted chronology," and what is generally
accepted hardly needs to be defended.

Vedic religion [i.e. supposedly in the
Rigveda], the foundation of Hinduism.

And here is what the Encyclopedia Britannica writes, also
in the year 2005, concerning the origins of Hinduism:

Around 1500 BCE the Indus Valley was invaded by an Indo-
European people called Aryans. They almost totally
transformed Indian civilization, and in so doing they
imposed new forms of religion.

1
Aside from the other absurdities, can you think of anything
more embarrassing than to find the Encyclopedia Britannica
sticking to Max Muller's date of 1500 BCE, which Muller
himself disowned?

For anybody to be defending the 'Aryan invasion theory'
today, it would have to be true that Max Muller, despite
having simply invented the Aryan invasion story in a
vacuum, nevertheless, and quite spectacularly, got it
right. But he didn't.

Once Indian archaeology really hit the ground running as a
discipline (which it hadn't in Muller's time), all sorts of
absurdities were discovered when attempting to interpret
the new evidence in light of the 'Aryan invasion theory.'
When the [Aryan invasion] theory was formed in the
nineteenth century there was no evidence of any significant
urban civilization in ancient India before

1000 BCE. The Aryan invasion theory was thus first devised
in terms of the Aryans overrunning of an aboriginal
culture, which had small settlements. On the invasion
assumption, the Vedic battle between the powers of light
and darkness was interpreted as indicating the Aryan
invasion with more advanced light-skinned people
overwhelming the dark-skinned aborigines who were regarded
as crude and uncivilized.

However, in the early twentieth century evidence of a large
urban civilization was found in Western India -- the so-
called Indus civilization of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro (c.
3000-1800 BCE). The Aryan invasion theory was recast in
light of these ruins. It was suggested that the Aryans
plundered and destroyed this culture and were responsible
for the sudden and possibly violent ending to it. This was
the initial view of researchers like Wheeler, who were
trained to accept the Aryan invasion theory, particularly
since the end of the Harappan era appeared to occur about
the time proposed for the so-called invasion (c. 1500 BCE)
-- Rajaram & Frawley (1997:53)

This was a big change. The original Aryan invasion theory
was that the blonde super-warrior nomads from the north
were much smarter than the primitive darkies, who were
therefore easily conquered. When it turned out that the
supposedly primitive darkies had in fact constructed
spectacularly advanced cities in the Indus Valley (Harappa
and Mohenjo Daro), the Aryan invasion theory was hardly
abandoned; it was simply modified to say that the blond
nomads had easily conquered this highly urban civilization
of

181
the Indus Valley, because apparently dark-skinned people
are always stupider than blondes, whether or not dark-
skinned people have built advanced cities. Turning once
again to the Rigveda, defenders of the 'Aryan invasion
theory' now claimed they saw in it descriptions of how the
invading Aryans had destroyed the cities of the Harappans.
But they had not noticed these descriptions when they
maintained that the Aryans had destroyed primitive
villagers.

I do not mean to suggest that nomadic invaders cannot
defeat a materially more advanced civilization. This has
happened more than once, most famously with the spectacular
Mongolian conquests that have in fact served as an
inspiration for this new version of the 'Aryan invasion
theory.' The problem with using the Mongols as a model,
however, as Koenraad Elst points out in Update on the Aryan
Invasion Debate, is the following:

. . .the outcome of such episodes [nomadic invasions of
more advanced civilizations] is [that] . . .the invaders
were usually assimilated into the sedentary civilization
which they had overpowered in battle, if they were not
driven back out. The Mongols became Chinese in China,
Muslim in Iran, and of the enormous territory they
conquered, there is (with the exception of Kalmykia) not
one square mile where a native language was permanently
replaced with Mongolian. -- (Elst 1999:4.1.2) The 'Aryan
invasion theory' maintains, on the contrary, that the
invading Aryan culture completely displaced what was there.
This is not in principle impossible but in that case we
would expect to see signs of the violent destruction.
Koenraad Elst explains that in Europe some linguistic
evidence is consistent with the view that the Hellenes,
Illyrians, and Thracians invaded and displaced a materially
advanced native civilization in the Balkans, but that here
we do find archaeological evidence of destruction, which we
don't in the Indian case.

These [Balkan] natives had used an as yet undeciphered
writing system reportedly going back to 5300 BC, and
disappearing along with the Old European culture in about
3500 BC. So there it really was an advanced civilization
being overrun by barbarian invaders who largely destroyed
it.

That model is being projected onto the Vedic-Harappan
history: a literate urban and agricultural civilization
being overrun by semi-nomadic horsemen. But the crucial
difference is that in the Balkans, this violent scenario is
attested by archaeological findings . . .The same thing
happened when, according to most specialists, the Greeks
entered mainland Greece in 1,900 BC, driving the last
remains of Old European culture to their last refuge on
Crete . . .

This [archeological] testimony of many settlements having
been burnt down is absent at the [Indus Valley] Harappan
sites. -- Elst (1999:4.7.1; emphasis mine) As Rajaram &
Frawley put it, "[t]here is no real archaeological evidence
of any violent demise for the Harappan civilization"
(1997:54). But such negative findings failed to put a dent
in the enthusiasm for the Aryan invasion 'theory,' because
. .by this time the invasion theory was so impressed upon
the minds of researchers that they continued

182
trying to remold it. Some assumed the Aryan invasion
occurred when the cities were in decline or had already
been abandoned -- that it was only the degenerate remains
of Harappans the Aryans conquered. That this refuted their
previous assumptions that Vedic literature portrayed the
destruction of cities in battle did not seem to cause any
problems for such scholars. It is clear by such shifts of
view that Vedic literature was never taken seriously by
these scholars and one wonders if they feel any need to
account for it at all. -- Rajaram & Frawley (1997:54) In
other words, the 'Aryan invasion theory,' whose only
support had been a particular interpretation of the
Rigveda, has kept going strong even though the
archaeological evidence has roundly contradicted this
interpretation of the Rigveda. This is remarkable, because
what it means is that the 'Aryan invasion theory' no longer
explains anything. In a sense this is what makes it so
stable, because evidence cannot refute a dogmatic religious
faith.

How the 'Aryan invasion theory' has been supported It is a
bit of an exaggeration, however, to say that the 'Aryan
invasion theory' is based entirely on nothing. The
discovery by European scholars of a number of interesting
similarities between Sanskrit words and European and
Iranian language cognates led to the speculation that all
of these languages had a common ancestor. The 'Aryan
invasion theory,' which has the mythical blond and blue-
eyed Aryans spreading out in remote times from Central Asia
and invading both Europe and India, was offered as an
explanation for the puzzle of the similarities between all
these languages. In the absence of archaeological data
agreeing with the invasion scenario, it was the comparative
linguists, so-called, who would provide the lasting
'support' for this historical hypothesis. But comparative
linguistics -- or philology, as the discipline was once
called -- is more a branch of superstition than a science,
and in this section I will explain why.

The 1968 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica (vol.

14, p.76) stated that Special linguistic methods,
elaborated mostly for the study of the Indo-European
languages, enable one to determine the genetic
relationships between the languages by a comparison of
their forms. These relations permit the supposition that
there once existed a parent language.

Since the "study of the Indo-European languages" is
practically synonymous with the defense of the 'Aryan
invasion' scenario, what we learn above is that "special
linguistic methods" were created to defend the theory that
Max Muller designed to give German nationalists a 'heroic
age' purged of the Jews. That does not bode well for these
"special linguistic methods." Already in 1933 the linguist
Leonard Bloomfield had pointed out the rather extreme
assumptions that were required:

The comparative [linguistic] method assumes that each
branch or language bears independent

183
witness of the forms of the parent language, and that
identities or correspondences among the related languages
reveal features of the parent speech. This is the same
thing as assuming, firstly that the parent community was
uniform as to language, and secondly, that the parent
community split suddenly and sharply into two or more
daughter communities, which lost all contact with each
other. -- Bloomfield (1933:310) Why did philologists or
'comparative linguists' assume that linguistic communities
split neatly, suddenly, and sharply, and thereafter lost
all contact with each other? Naturally, because they were
thinking of linguistic communities as if they were
biological species. When a biological population splits
into two reproductively isolated lineages these will begin
to evolve independently, because the information relevant
to organismal design -- carried by genes -- cannot be
'exchanged' between two populations unless they mate with
each other. The manner in which cultural populations
evolve, however, hardly corresponds to this model.

The evolution of cultural populations cannot be understood
except by reference to the psychological and other laws
governing the social acquisition of what are now called
'memes': socially transmissible bits of information such as
ideas, beliefs, norms, habits, laws, traditions, etc. The
evolutionary theorist Richard Dawkins (1976) coined the
term 'meme' to rhyme with 'gene' so as to emphasize that
memes, too, are subject to Darwinian forces of mutation,
inheritance, and selection, because some memes will
perforce be more 'popular,' becoming more common at the
expense of other memes. But apart from its sound, Dawkins
deliberately coined this term to suggest morphemic linkages
with mimesis, memory, and the French word même (which means
'the same').

Why? Because memes are transmitted through social learning
(as opposed to biological reproduction) , they are stored
in memory (as opposed to in the cell's nucleus), and they
must show some non-trivial degree of similarity between
parent and copy for Darwinian analyses to apply.

Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson, in 1985, launched what is
arguably the most productive approach to elucidating the
laws governing the transmission of memes in Culture and the
Evolutionary Process. For an update of their ideas and a
summary of twenty years of research, consult Richerson &
Boyd's Not by Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed the
Evolutionary Process, published in 2005 (full disclosure: I
got my Ph.D. in cultural and biological anthropology at
UCLA, with Robert Boyd as my thesis advisor). One of the
purposes of the research agenda of these two pioneers is to
determine the relative importance of various forms of
cultural transmission in producing historical change. It is
certainly true that parents will transmit many memes to
their biological children, and here the direction of
transmission is identical to what happens in genetic
transmission. However, humans also learn from their peers,
from adults who are not their ancestors, from those who are
younger, and even from foreigners, and these directions of
transmission are radically different from what happens in
the genetic case. In addition, a population boundary
defined by ethnic identity and/or the preservation of
certain traditions will by no means always correspond
neatly to the boundary of a speech community; as any
anthropologist will tell you, humans

184
display maddening complexity in their social boundary
overlaps.

For example, different classes in the same society always
speak different dialects and sometimes entirely different
languages. Bits of a language can travel horizontally in
piecemeal fashion and be adopted by foreigners without more
substantial cultural contact or influence -- and certainly
without implying an ancestor-descendant relationship
between the donor and borrower populations. In fact, a
population can acquire an entirely new language, whole,
without being descended from the population that originally
spoke it (e.g. the Irish). Therefore, imagining that one
can look at similarities between different speech
communities to reconstruct a neat splitting and branching
historical pattern of cultures conceived of as indivisible
wholes, in the manner of the phylogeny of biological
species, is an obvious non-starter. But if any doubts
remain, anthropologist Richard McElreath (1997), who
likewise studied with Robert Boyd, has given a definitive
mathematical demonstration that one cannot construct
cultural phylogenies the way biologists do for species. He
concludes (p.38):

Current work in this area . . .still tackles the problem
[of reconstructing cultural phylogenies] as if cultures had
a single "real" phylogeny. This may certainly be true for
some classes of traits, but we do not know yet which traits
these are. We cannot presuppose that the traits we are
interested in share a phylogeny with language.

In other words, the various forms of social transmission of
information, and the fact that different bits of
information are transmitted through different channels and
in different ways, make it impossible to reconstruct
branching trees of ancestor-descendant relations as if
cultures branched whole, with all their traits traveling
together, in the manner of biological species. So the so-
called comparative linguists presuppose something that "we
cannot presuppose," and this is the method that has been
recruited to support the 'Aryan invasion theory.' The
linguist Leonard Bloomfield (1933:311) explained some time
ago what the consequence of this was:

. . .studies of Indo-European did not realize that the
family tree diagram was merely a statement of their method:
they accepted the uniform parent languages, and their
sudden clear cut splitting, as historical realities.

That's the polite way of saying that the comparative
linguists ended up believing their own nonsense.

But what did the comparative linguists do, exactly?

They invented a fictional language: 'Indo-European.' This
was supposedly the ancestor language to all so-called Indo-
European languages. Another name for 'Indo-European,' of
course, is Aryan. The claim by comparative linguists to
have demonstrated that there had been a Indo-European or
Aryan language, parent to Sanskrit, Iranian languages, and
German, among other European languages, was simply their
entirely incorrect assumption -- as pointed out above --
concerning what the similarities between languages will
imply about ancestordescendant relations. Therefore, the
existence of ancestral

185
'Indo-European' or 'Aryan' has never been supported, let
alone demonstrated; this language was just conjured out of
thin air.

Naturally, in order to defend the 'Aryan invasion theory'
it is important to privilege the so-called 'evidence' of
comparative linguists over all other, because otherwise the
archaeological evidence will lead people to the obvious
hypothesis: that the 'Indo-European' languages are similar
because they are all descendants of Sanskrit. This would
make a whole lot of sense.

With its extensive and fertile river systems of the Indus,
Saraswati and Ganga, India was the best place on earth for
food production, for demographic growth, for cultural life
and for scientific progress.

. . .it is perfectly plausible that large groups of
Indians went to other countries as traders and colonists,
precisely like the Europeans did when it was their turn to
have a demographical as well as a technological edge over
their neighbors. And just like a dominant Spanish minority
managed to make its own language the mother-tongue of much
larger populations which are genetically predominantly
Native American, so also the slightly darker emigrants from
India may have passed on their language to the white people
of Russia and Europe. -- Elst (1999:4.1.1) What about the
genetic evidence?

The genetic evidence likewise does not support the 'Aryan
invasion theory.' On 10 January 2006 National Geographic
News reported on the results of a genetic study by
"Vijendra Kashyap, director of India's National Institute
of Biologicals in Noida." 1 According to National
Geographic, "the data reveal that the large majority of
modern Indians descended from South Asian ancestors." It is
by now perhaps needless to say that this has not shaken the
'Aryan invasion theory' in the least, and in fact the
National Geographic article takes pains to explain this.

The finding disputes a long-held theory that a large
invasion of central Asians, traveling through a northwest
Indian corridor, shaped the language, culture, and gene
pool of many modern Indians within the past 10,000 years.

That theory is bolstered by the presence of Indo-European
languages in India, the archaeological record, and historic
sources such as the Rig Veda, an early Indian religious
text.

. . . Peter Underhill, a research scientist at the
Stanford University School of Medicine's department of
genetics, says he harbors no doubts that Indo-European
speakers [i.e. the supposed 'Aryans'] did move into India.
But he agrees with Kashyap that their genetic contribution
appears small.

"It doesn't look like there was a massive flow of genes
that came in a few thousand years ago," he 1 "India
Acquired Language, Not Genes, From West, Study Says"; by
Brian Handwerk for National Geographic News; January 10,
2006.

186
said. "Clearly people came in to India and brought their
culture, language, and some genes." Clearly? This is
remarkable. Who can doubt that if the genetic data
supported the view of a population movement from the
Northwest into India, mainstream scholars would be telling
us that, naturally, this is because the 'Aryan invasion
theory' is correct? And yet, if the genetic data go the
other way the 'Aryan invasion theory' is still "clearly"
the right one. As before, we see that it matters little
which way the evidence goes: the 'Aryan invasion theory'
will simply be asserted, with confidence.

The title of the National Geographic article is in perfect
agreement with Peter Underhill, for it reads: "India
Acquired Language, Not Genes, From West, Study Says." In
other words, if the data says that Indians are genetically
descended from South Asians, well then the invading Aryans
-- because there must be invading Aryans -- bequeathed
their culture to Indians but few genes.

The problem is not that Underhill's theory of a deep
cultural but shallow genetic impact of invading Aryans from
the Northwest has to be incorrect in principle -- the
problem is that there is simply no evidence to support it,
and the genetic evidence is just the latest blow.
Regurgitating the mainstream view matter-of-factly,
National Geographic tells its readers that the 'Aryan
invasion theory' "is bolstered by the presence of Indo-
European languages in India, the archaeological record, and
historic sources such as the Rig Veda, an early Indian
religious text." But we have already seen that the
archaeological evidence refutes this theory, and that the
linguistic 'evidence' is no evidence at all. I shall now
turn to the supposed evidence from the Rigveda in order to
show that there is simply nothing -- nothing at all -- that
will support this theory. This exercise will finally take
us where we ultimately wanted to go: towards an elucidation
of the origins of the ancient Persians.

So who were 'the Aryans' of the Rigveda, then? The original
scholarly impetus for the entire 'Aryan invasion theory'
was a misinterpretation of the word 'Aryan' as used in the
Rigveda. At first, as we saw, Max Muller along with others
said that the Aryans were a 'race.' Then, when the
political winds made his position delicate he changed his
tune and said that the Aryans were a linguistic group. The
notion of the Aryans as a 'race' persisted despite Muller's
flip, but was made disreputable when the Nazis put it to
their infamous uses. So in the academic community what has
flourished since has been the theory of the 'Indo-European
language family,' developing Muller's second theme. But the
'race' idea was never quite abandoned: "An original Aryan
race that spoke proto-Indo-European [i.e. Aryan, the
language from which all the 'Indo-European' languages are
supposedly descended] was proposed, which then migrated and
transmitted its language, but not necessarily its racial
type to other people" (Rajaram & Frawley 1997:61). Actually
this is the same old Nazi idea, isn't it? It suggests that
only some of the modern Europeans will be 'pure Aryans.'

187
But the point here is the evidence: the term 'Arya' in the
ancient Sanskrit literature is a concept having zero
similarity either to a 'race' or to a 'language group,'
which guarantees that the notion of the 'Aryan people,' in
either version, will be nonsensical in principle. Here is
an example of how the term 'Aryan' is used in the Rigveda:
The Gods generated the Divine Word (Brahman), the cow, the
horse, the plants, the trees, the Earth, the mountains and
the Waters. Raising the Sun in Heaven, the bountiful Gods
released the Aryan laws over the world.

RV.x.65.11 -- translation, Rajaram & Frawley (1997:63) Now,
with nothing but the above for context, ask yourself, if we
were to rewrite the last phrase, which of the following
three possibilities would make more sense:

1) " . . .the bountiful Gods released the laws of the Aryan
race over the world"; or
2) " . . .the bountiful Gods released the laws of the
Aryan-speaking people over the world"; or
3) " . . .the bountiful Gods released the good laws over
the world"?

What in the text forces the first or second choices? The
text is obviously exalting the gods -- they have done
everything well. And these gods, who are so "bountiful" and
have thus created everything, blessed us also with laws.
Therefore, to me it seems as though "the Aryan laws" has to
mean 'the perfect laws' of the gods or something like that.
I can find no good reason to suppose that this is a
reference to the laws of an 'Aryan race' or speech
community.

Another reason for preferring the third option is that a
Sanskrit dictionary which is one-thousand five-hundred
years old agrees with it.

The most authoritative source for classical Sanskrit words
is Amarakosa, a lexicon from about 500 CE.

According to this authority an Arya is: mhakulakulinarya-
sabhya-sajjanasadha vah.

This is unambiguous and means: an Arya is one who hails
from a good family, of gentle behavior and demeanor, good
natured and of righteous conduct. -- Rajaram (1995:151).

The Aryan laws = the righteous laws; nothing to do with
'race' or language.

The definition of 'Arya' in Amarakosa reminds me of the way
Mexican aristocrats speak, and on the basis of the Mexican
comparison I would submit the following hypothesis: the
ancient Sanskrit word 'Arya' is an aristocratic marker for
a class distinction. But is it legitimate for me to use
modern Mexico as a model to interpret the ancient Indus
Valley civilization? It is, so long as, regardless of time
and location, humans will tend to feel compassion unless an
ideological structure intervenes. If this is true, then the
only stable aristocracies will be those which reliably
equip young aristocrats, every generation, with a belief in
their own superiority, there to preempt the compassion that
would otherwise make them band together with the lower
classes and institute some form of progressive politics.
And what could be more effective, for the stability of an
aristocratic class, than to define words in such a way that
compassion will be effortlessly and automatically trumped
in the daily act of speaking? So, if it

188
is true that stable aristocratic classes in different times
and places will code certain meanings in similar ways, then
the Mexican comparison may well prove useful. Let's see how
far it takes us.

I grew up as a member of a prominent aristocratic family in
Mexico, a country with sharp class divisions. Since I was
always of an anthropological bent (and thus became an
anthropologist) my experience in my own native society was
to a certain extent that of a participant- observer. In
other words, I was always, in a sense, a foreigner, never
quite in my own skin, and more than one person made the
observation. Less charitably, I was weird, because nothing
about my society seemed natural -- it all demanded an
explanation. My atypical mental and social experience has
equipped me with reflections about the Mexican aristocracy
that I think will prove useful here. (Note: I am using the
word 'aristocracy' loosely because there are no titles of
nobility in Mexico; but this is a distinction without much
of a difference: the very upper classes in Mexico are a
relatively stable group of people who inherit their
position to their children, and whose physical appearance
is mostly European. They are certainly a hereditary ruling
class in effect if not formally).

The people around me (the Mexican aristocrats) were always
cutting up the Mexican universe into two types of people:
'gente decente' (or 'gente bien,' a synonym) in opposition
to 'nacos.' The word 'gente' means 'people,' and although
the word 'nacos' appears all by itself, it is also
referring to a group of people, which is why I have it in
the plural. So the opposition 'gente decente' vs. 'nacos'
is an opposition between two different categories of
people. I shall now try to give you a sense for the
meanings of these words, and I will be careful to specify
the relevant context, each time, because usage and precise
meaning vary by context.

First, let us imagine a situation without a class-relevant
dimension but a clear moral one. Thus, imagine that you are
a Mexican aristocrat and that somebody -- another
aristocrat --did not keep a promise, or cheated in a
transaction, or tried to bribe you. This person, in
consequence, is not 'decente'; he is 'naco.' Or suppose
that this fellow aristocrat threw trash out of the window
of his car, or spat on the ground, or didn't wash his hands
after going to the restroom. Once again, this person is not
'decente'; he is 'naco.' Or suppose that this fellow
aristocrat called you names, or took some liberties when
speaking to you even though you had not been quite
introduced. Once again, he is not 'decente'; he is 'naco.'
So on a first pass it appears that 'decente' is not that
different from 'Arya' as defined in the ancient Sanskrit
dictionary Amarakosa, as it easily covers the meanings of
being "of gentle behavior and demeanor, good natured and of
righteous conduct." Now take a look at the remaining
meaning for Arya in Amarakosa: "hailing from a good
family." For the Mexican aristocrats, "hailing from a good
family" is a euphemism for being a member of the
aristocracy -- and when finer distinctions apply, for being
a member of the old aristocracy as opposed to the nouveau
riches. So this makes me wonder whether the Sanskrit
dictionary means the same thing when it says that "Arya is
one who hails from a good family." If so, this would agree
perfectly with the Mexican model, because when a class
context is involved, Mexican aristocrats will use 'gente

189
decente' (lit. 'decent people') to refer to themselves, the
aristocrats, who come from 'good families' -- they are not
qualifying anybody's behavior (though there is always an
implication that the behavior of aristocrats is morally
superior).

1 By symmetry, in a class context, Mexican aristocrats will
use the contrast term 'nacos' to refer to the lower
classes.

Does Sanskrit have a term to contrast with 'Arya' that will
be the equivalent of 'naco'? It does: Dasa or Dasyu.

Navaratna S. Rajaram and David Frawley explain that the
dasas are "[those] opposed to the Vedic way of life.  . .
Literally it means servant . . ." (1997:272; emphasis
mine). Interesting.

The slang term 'gato' ( lit. 'cat') is used by Mexican
aristocrats, with derogation, to refer to their servants,
and it is often used interchangeably with 'naco' when
referring to the lower classes at large, or when
criticizing 'improper' forms of behavior (according to
aristocratic standards).

Elsewhere, Rajaram & Frawley write ( ibid. p.72): Dasyus,
Dasas, and Panis as people are opposite to Aryans. They are
unspiritual people. They do not sacrifice, do not offer
gifts, do not honor the Gods.

In other contexts they are not even people but demons . . .
Dasyu means destroyer and often simply means a robber, a
criminal or an uncivilized person, or a low class person
(such as we find its usage in the Manu Samhita).

1
It is also precisely when a class context is involved that
'gente bien' (lit.

'good people') becomes a perfect synonym of 'gente
decente.' Just as with 'naco,' Dasa or Dasyu, depending on
context, means someone who breaks the norms, or else a low
class person (or both simultaneously) . The opposition
between Arya and Dasyu does indeed appear to follow rather
closely the Mexican opposition between 'gente decente' and
'nacos,' allowing for the fact that the authors of the
Vedic texts were hyper-religious and so added a religious
dimension to the distinction (an Aryan does the sacrifices
properly, etc., and a Dasyu does not).

Additional support for the usefulness of the Mexican model
is the following:

. . .the most common use of the word Arya in classical
Sanskrit is as an honorific -- as in addressing people.
'Arya Chanakya' simply is equivalent to Mr. Chanakya.
Addressing a man as Arya is equivalent to calling him 'Sir'
in English or 'Monsieur' in French. -- Rajaram (1995:152)
If the word Arya was used by the ancient Indus Valley
aristocrats, in a class context, to refer to themselves,
then by the Mexican model it is not in the least surprising
that the same word should have functioned also as an
honorific, because honorifics are also used to mark class
distinctions in the daily intercourse between two people.
In Mexico, when two people of the same class are speaking
to each other, they may address each other honorifically as
Don this or that. But when members of the upper and lower
classes speak to each other, it is traditional (and still
common) for the upper-class person to be addressed as Don
something (with honorific grammar) and for the lower-class
person to be addressed by their first name (with familiar
grammar).

190
English speakers unfamiliar with the class discourse of
Mexican society can nevertheless plumb their own intuitions
by reflecting on English usage. For example, the
observations above also apply to the use of the Spanish
term 'Señor,' which is a good translation for the French
'Monsieur' and the English 'Sir.' But the specifically
British 'Sir' also has affinities with 'Don,' because it is
sometimes employed as an aristocratic title. Since I am
arguing that aristocrats everywhere will make a linkage
between membership in the aristocracy and supposedly
superior manners and moral values, it is telling that a
member of the lower classes can become Sir in Britain
through meritorious behavior in the eyes of the
aristocracy, which aristocracy then condescends to confer
the title on the 'worthy' commoner.

But the most productive English-language intuition here
comes from reflecting on the use of the word 'noble,' which
in a class context means "of high birth or exalted rank:

ARISTOCRATIC
," as Merriam Webster Online puts it; outside a class
context, according to the same dictionary, 'noble' means
all of the following: "possessing outstanding qualities,"
"possessing very high or excellent qualities or
properties," "very good or excellent," "grand or impressive
especially in appearance," and "possessing, characterized
by, or arising from superiority of mind or character or of
ideals or morals." On first pass it might seem as if a
contradiction to my interpretation appears in the great
epic Ramayana, where the following description of Rama is
given: "Arya -- who cared for the equality of all and was
dear to everyone" (Rajaram 1995:153). But even interpreting
this passage to mean that Rama frowns on class divisions,
this is not a contradiction.

Caring for the equality of all, here, is not part of the
definition of Arya. Rather, 'Arya' in my view is simply
being used here as an adjective to qualify the general
worthiness of Rama, which would agree with the most common
use of 'Arya' in the Rigveda : "The Rigveda uses the word
[Arya] mainly as an adjective, invariably as a term
implying finer qualities" (Rajaram 1995:153). So Rama is a
noble divinity (nice guy), who therefore cares for the
equality of all. This is also how the word 'decente' is
mostly used in Mexico, as an adjective, for this is its
primary and default meaning. Hence, "la gente decente lucha
por la igualdad de todos" ("the gente decente fight for
everybody's equality") will be a perfectly reasonable
phrase in many a Mexican context, just as "the fight for
equality is a noble pursuit" is a perfectly good English
phrase, despite the fact that 'noble' in some contexts
means aristocrat.

In further support of this interpretation I note that "The
Buddha called his religion Aryan (Arya Dharma) . . .[and]
Cyrus, the first emperor of Persia also called himself an
Aryan, or a noble person" (Rajaram & Frawley 1997:63). Both
the Buddha and Cyrus the Great were interested in justice
for all, as in the case of Rama, so 'Arya' cannot have been
used by them in its aristocratic sense, but simply as an
adjective of moral worthiness.

By the way, the interpretation that the Arya/Dasyu
opposition marks a class distinction is one that Navaratna
Rajaram, my source on the meanings of these words, does not
like, and which he derogatorily labels 'Marxist' (Rajaram
1995:152). So if one can build this case even with
Rajaram's translations, then perhaps there is something to
it.

191
Now, I find it quite interesting that, although Dasyu was a
term of derogation in the Vedic works, "[t]he Iranians and
some Central Asiatics . . .seem to have described
themselves as Dasyu after they broke away from the Vedic
fold" ( ibid.

p.272). What could explain this? Well, we know from the
modern experience that it is not uncommon for discriminated
groups, when politicized, to adopt -- in proud defiance of
the symbol system they mean to oppose -- the insults heaped
on them by their oppressors. Famously, within the African-
American community, 'nigger' may be used in certain
contexts as a comradely term of endearment, and some
politicized gays have adopted as an identity symbol the
pink triangle that the Nazis designed to brand them with.
Since the Iranians, as we have seen, eventually developed a
successfully egalitarian, justice-seeking, world-saving
religion, Zoroastrianism, the fact that they adopted for
themselves the term Dasyu suggests that perhaps they
emerged out of a major class struggle in ancient Vedic
civilization.

This hypothesis has going for it that it avoids the
absurdities that otherwise emerge when you try to interpret
the battles between Aryas and Dasyus in the Rigveda as wars
between blue-eyed-blond and dark-skinned 'races' or
ethnies.

The Rigveda describes a battle between the forces of light
and the forces of darkness. This is the battle between the
Gods (Devas) and the demons (called variously Panis,
Dasyus, Dasas . . .) The Vedas proclaim the victory of the
light and the destruction of the forces of darkness. --
Rajaram & Frawley (1997:64) If the Rigveda uses the term
Dasa or Dasyu to denote the demons or 'bad guys,' and the
same classical Sanskrit term is used to denote the lower
classes, this is further support for the view that the
Rigveda depicts a class conflict. What does not appear well
supported is the interpretation that the battle between
'light' and 'darkness' represents a racial or ethnic
conflict between groups of people of contrasting
complexion.

As Rajaram and Frawley note, the battle between 'forces of
light' and 'forces of darkness' occurs in many other
cultures, and nowhere does it have a racial interpretation
of whiteskinned, blond, blue-eyed people fighting with
dark-skinned people. For example, nobody gives this
interpretation to The War of the Children of Light Against
the Children of Darkness, one of the documents found in the
famous Dead Sea Scrolls uncovered at Qumran, in present-day
Israel. Why give a 'racial' or ethnic interpretation, then,
to the Vedic scriptures?

Aryans vs. Dasyus is a representation of the 'good guys'
versus the 'bad guys' from the point of view of those who
won (as usual); no racial or ethnic interpretation is
called for.

Those who would interpret the Rigveda's battle between the
forces of 'light' and 'darkness' as a story written by the
invading and supposedly white-skinned Aryans to celebrate
their victory over the supposedly native and supposedly
dark-skinned Dasyus, run into obvious problems.

Consider, for example, the so-called Battle of the Ten
Kings, which is one of the most prominent stories in the
Rigveda. Its hero is King Sudas, who was aided by
miraculous floods called forth by the god Indra.

The floods extended for Sudas. Indra you made them shallow
and easy to cross. The host of the

192
Simyus who are unworthy of praise, Indra, who is to be
lauded by speech, gave the curse of the rivers.

Turvasa was the leader, seeking gain, like hungry fish with
an appetite for gain. The Bhrgus and the Druhyus followed
his advice. Friend to friend crossed over from opposite
regions. The Pakthas, Bhalanas, Alinas, Visaninas, and
Sivas came. Yet Indra came and led the side of the Aryans.

Of evil mind, trying to drain the Earth ( Aditi), the
unwise parted the Parusni river. The ruler of the Earth,
Indra with his might scattered them. The herd and their
leader lay still piled up (in their defeat).

They went to their goal, their defeat on the Parusni.

Even the swift did not return. Indra for Sudas, for man,
defeated the strong, unfriendly people of false speech.

RV. VII.18.5-9 -- translati on, Rajaram & Frawley (1997:76)
Above we are told that the god "Indra came and led the side
of the Aryans." But this has to mean 'the good guys,' in
this passage, because elsewhere we are told that, Indra and
Varuna, aid Sudas with grace and destroy his opponents both
Dasa and Arya . . . Both sides call upon you in battle,
Indra and Varuna, for victory.

RV.

VII.18.12-14 --  translation, Rajaram & Frawley (1997:77)
If both sides call upon the same gods, it is obvious that
both sides are members of the same culture, which
contradicts the idea that nomads from Central Asia called
'Aryans' were invading non-Aryan people already in the
Indus Valley. And if there are both Aryans and Dasyus
opposing King Sudas, then it is impossible to interpret
this conflict neatly as one between Aryans against Dasyus,
with the Aryans as the white-skinned race who defeated the
dark-skinned race -- that would make zero sense. And yet
this is how the 'Aryan invasion theory' interprets the
text! By contrast, accepting my defense of the idea that
the Arya/Dasyu distinction is labeling a class division
from the aristocratic point of view, then perhaps the Indus
Valley was witness to some rather extended political
conflicts which, as in the first century Mediterranean,
will benefit from a 'modern' interpretation in terms of a
sophisticated ideological contest between an ancient right-
wing and an ancient left-wing. Why not? After all, it is
already quite clear that the ancient Indians were terribly
sophisticated, and in some ways more advanced than modern
Europeans. Consider for example Panini and Patañjali (of
Yogasutra fame): Panini [was an] ancient Sanskrit
grammarian whose Astadhyayi is generally regarded as the
greatest work on descriptive linguistics ever written....

Computer scientists are only now beginning to discover the
linguistic treasures of Panini's Astadhyayi and Patañjali's
Mahabhasya. The value of Indian linguistics in modern
computer science is well established, by researchers in
artificial intelligence and computer languages. -- Rajaram
& Frawley (1997:285, 14).

Panini and Patañjali belong to the Sutra period, which in
the corrected, scientific chronology -- as opposed to in
Max Muller's superstitious nonsense -- is contemporaneous
with the Harappans and Sumeria (as we shall see). This
means that the

193
traditional Indian dating of these authors, which places
them around 3000 BCE, cannot be far off. If that bygone
civilization could produce better linguistics than we have
today, why should we imagine that their political awareness
was less sophisticated than ours? So I find the possibility
intriguing that if the most important political conflict
depicted in the Rigveda represents the opponents of King
Sudas as including both Aryans and Dasyus, perhaps an
ideological movement not unlike the leftist movements that
produced ancient Judaism, the French revolution, or modern
socialism, all of which involved alliances of aristocrats
and commoners, may have also taken place in the ancient
Indus Valley.

King Sudas won, says the Rigveda, which is consistent with
the fact that progressive politics was dealt a severe blow
in India, but nevertheless flourished among the Vedic
offshoot that became the Iranians, who not only turned the
deity Indra, patron of the Vedic warriors, into an evil
spirit (as we saw in the previous chapter), but also
defiantly adopted for themselves the designation Dasyu (as
we saw above). Consistent with these speculations is the
fact that the ancient Vedic works lump the Panis with the
Dasas and Dasyus as enemies of the Aryans.

The Panis are traders and merchants -- businesspe ople.
This is consistent with social conflicts in other times and
places, where the lower classes have found allies among the
traders and merchants against the aristocrats and their
mercenaries.

On the basis of this interpretation, I will now turn to the
question of when the Iranians came into their own.

When did the Iranians arise?

Archaeologists have shown that the heartland of the so-
called 'Indus Valley' civilization was actually by the
Sarasvati river, which was enormous when this civilization
was at its height.

This is consistent with the contents of the Rigveda, where
the Sarasvati is assigned a prominent place.

The Rigveda lauds [the Sarasvati] as the greatest of rivers
and the holy mother. Satellite photography, archaeology, as
well as hydrological surveys all show that the Sarasvati
was once a mighty river, over five miles wide in places.
This is entirely in accord with the Vedic accounts that
make that Sarasvati the first of rivers." (Rajaram &
Frawley 1997:110).

As if the 'Aryan invasion theory' didn't already have
enough problems, it turns out that "The Sarasvati river, it
is now known, changed its course several times, finally
drying up completely around 1900 BCE" (ibid. p.111). Why is
this a problem? Because the 'Aryan invasion theory' claims
that the invading Aryans arrived around 1500 BCE, and wrote
the Rigveda to celebrate their supposed invasion around
1200 BCE.

Why would these arriving nomads celebrate a mighty river
which no longer existed at the time of their supposed
conquest, and around which they had not built a great
civilization? Seems hard to explain. However, if the 'Aryan
invasion theory' is abandoned, there is no special problem:
the Rigveda was composed by those who lived around the
Sarasvati river, and who in their latest stage correspond
to the populations of Harappa and Mohenjo Daro.

194
But when was the Rigveda written, then? Rajaram & Frawley
marshal several independent lines of converging evidence to
derive a new chronology. For example, astronomical
observations made in the ancient Vedic works are useful
because the features of the sky have been changing, and
some things that could be observed a long time ago could
not be observed later, which is of invaluable help in
dating the composition of texts which mention certain --
now outdated --astronomical phenomena.

There is also the evidence of comparative mathematics.

The historian of mathematics A. Seidenberg, in The Ritual
Origin of Geometry (1962) and The Origin of Mathematics
(1978) had already shown that the mathematics of the Indian
Sulbasutras are ancestral to the mathematics of Babylonia,
Egypt, and Greece (see discussion in Rajaram & Frawley
1997:136-173) . However, Seidenberg encountered among
historians of India the doctrine of the 'Aryan invasion
theory,' the general agreement about which he took to mean
that solid science was behind it. Since these historians,
following Max Muller, told him that the Sutras had been
composed between 600 and 200 BCE, he was led to posit a
mathematics ancestral to both the Sulbasutras and the
mathematics of these other civilizations. Now, for this
ancestral mathematics there is zero evidence, just as there
is zero evidence for the ancestral 'Indo-European'
language. Thus, with a refutation of the 'Aryan invasion
theory' in hand, the natural solution is obviously that the
Indian mathematics expressed in the Sulbasutras are
ancestral to the Babylonian, Egyptian, and Greek
mathematics, just as Sanskrit is ancestral to the Iranian
and European languages. This requires pushing back the date
of composition of the Sutras to around the year 3000 BCE.

These pieces of the puzzle agree nicely with the
archaeological evidence and also the geographic/ecologic al
evidence about the drying up of the Sarasvati river, which
in turn agrees with traditional Indian history (the same
traditional history that has no memory of an 'Aryan
invasion' from the north). For example, Several ancient
[Indian] works like the Pancavimsa, Brahmana, the
Mahabharata, and the Puranas state that the Sarasvati
disappeared into the desert well before reaching the ocean.
This represents a later state in the life of the great
river. The Sarasvati that [in the Rigveda] flowed "from the
mountain to the sea" must therefore correspond [to] a much
much earlier age, at least a few centuries before 3000 BCE.
So the Rigveda must belong to a period before that date. --
Rajaram (1995:23) These and other considerations produce a
new chronology that, needless to say, is more convincing
than Max Muller's. According to this new chronology --
which moreover agrees, more or less, with the dates offered
by the tradition of Indian history dating to ancient times
-- the composition of the latest portions of the Rigveda
should be placed around 3700 BCE (ibid. p.204). A long time
ago indeed. On this reckoning, it is also around this time
that King Sudas fought it out against a coalition of Aryans
and Dasyus, with victory going to King Sudas and his
mercenaries. This means that the Iranians, who called
themselves Dasyus, emerged into their own after this

195 battle and not before. When exactly is a difficult
question to answer, but here is an exciting clue:

There are tantalizing references to Zarathustra and his
schism in the Indian literature also. An Indian historian,
Madalasa Devi Agarawala cites the following passage from
the Bhavisya Purana (139, 13-15):

" . . .contrary to the Vedic practices, your son will
become famous by the name of Mag. His name will be
Jarathustra Mag and he will bring fame to the dynasty. His
descendants will worship fire and will be known by the name
Mag (Shaka) and being worshippers of 'Soma' ( magadha-
shakadvipi) will be Mag Brahmins." (Agarawala, 1979) From
this one is led to conclude that Mag was sometimes used in
India to refer to that Sakas or their land. The Sakas are
not necessarily the Scythians; eastern Iranians were also
so called.

Their land was known as Sakasthana -- the modern Seistan.
Ms. Agarawala further explains that the word 'Mag' was used
in ancient India to describe heretical people who were
opposed to Vedic practices. Could the words 'Magus' and
'Magi' used by Herodotus for Median and Persian priests
have been related to the Indian Mag -- the magadha
shakadvipi? -- Rajaram & Frawley (1997:126)

The following points bear emphasis. The name Jarathustra
needs only the substitution of a 'Z' for a 'J' and we get
'Zarathustra.' Eastern Iranians are close to Afghanistan,
and many scholars believe that's where Zarathustra was
from.

Zarathustra indeed preached "contrary to the Vedic
practices." Moreover, as Rajaram points out, Herodotus
referred to what were almost certainly Zoroastrian priests
as Magi, and these could easily be the Mag Brahmins. Since
the Iranians adopted the derogatory term Dasyu in apparent
defiance of the Vedic symbol system, it would fit if their
priests adopted the term Mag, used by the Vedic
aristocratic priests to derogate 'heretics.' There is no
question but that fire played a central symbolic role in
Zoroastrianism. And the Zoroastrians had a ritual that
involved what the Avestan texts call 'haoma' (above,
'Soma'), a psychoactive drug (Boyce 1992:58, 111), and one
of their divinities was the Mainyu of the plant, or Haoma
(Boyce 1992:109, 116).

I do not believe ancient texts can prophecy such minute
details into the future, even when they pretend to be doing
so.

Therefore, the Bhavisva Purana, despite writing in the
future tense, since it refers to the coming descendants of
Zarathustra, had to be written when descendants of
Zarathustra already existed and Zarathustra himself was
already "famous" and worth writing about for having created
a successful ethical mass movement. The Puranas represent
the traditional Indian historical tradition, and they are
supposed to belong to Vedic times, the closing of which
Rajaram & Frawley's new chronology places around 1900 BCE,
when the Sarasvati river finally dried up. So Zarathustra,
by this reckoning, had to make his appearance no later than
1900 BCE, and almost certainly somewhat earlier (there is
convergence with Xanthos of Lydia here, who, as we saw in
the previous chapter, placed Zoroaster around 1800 BCE).
Presumably the Iranians predate Zarathustra

himself, in which case they emerged into their own before
this date.

When?

Rajaram (1995:164) notes that "The famous Battle of Ten
Kings resulted in the expulsion from India of several
tribes of Indian Aryans who settled in Persia, Parthia, and
as far west as Anatolia [Turkey]," something that had
already been noted long before by students of the Puranas
such as F.E. Pargiter ( ibid. p.165). Of course, there is
no particular reason to call these emigrants 'Indian
Aryans' if the term is a marker of class rather than
ethnicity, and especially if some of these would eventually
call themselves Dasyus. If the Battle of Ten Kings, as I
argued above, was a conflict between a right-wing,
represented by Sudas and his mercenaries, and a left-wing,
then perhaps the origins of the Iranians may be found in
these migrations, and if not perhaps in a later population
movement out of India.

I must clarify that most of those who left India continued
to worship in the Vedic religion much as before.

Consider for example that in 1907 a tablet dating to about
1400 BCE was discovered in Anatolia [Turkey]
