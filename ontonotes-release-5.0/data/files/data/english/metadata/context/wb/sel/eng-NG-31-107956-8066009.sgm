Hello rec.boaters.  Hope all is well and everyone is having a good
season.

Bought a Larson 22' bowrider earlier this year and had a very
enjoyable summer of cruising and water sports with family and
friends.  Couple of small warranty issues, but overall she proved to
be solid and I am pleased with the boat.

However, there is one thing about the boat that is driving me nuts.
The bimini top: How it is attached to the boat, how much it flexes the
windshield at the attach points, and how much noise it makes because
of the flexing.

During any kind of chop, the bimini oscillates port and starboard, and
causes the windshield sides to flex very noticably.  It's flexing
enough that I am concerned about gelcoat damage at the windshield/hull
attach points.

The bimini is a typical stainless tube structure.  The base fixtures
are well attached to the gunnel (aft) and windshield frame (forward).

Here's a stock photo, and I've added a crude wireframe diagram to show
where the bimini attaches:

http://www.zjstech.net/larson/larsonbim1.gif

When deployed, two straps attach to anchor points at the corners of
the windshield.

Here's another stock photo showing the detail just inside the
windshield.  The gunnel is several inches wide.  The green lines
represent what I think is a logical place to put some type of support
post.  I think it would look bad, breaking up the clean lines of the
gunnel, but I am at a loss for what else to do.

http://www.zjstech.net/larson/larsonbim2.gif

Getting rid of the bimini is not an option.  Too much 12 o'clock sun
here in the south.

Suggestions appreciated.

We have a 20 foot runabout and I installed the bimini myself.   I attached
the bimini frame to the gunnel area outside of the windshield.   I then
attached rubber spacers between the frame and the vertical fiberglass area
running under the windshield to the gunnel.  Anchor points for the fore and
aft straps are attached to that same fiberglass area running under the
windshield.

I still get some sway in the frame (when not up or not deployed) but at
least it is not flexing the windshield as in your case.

As and easy fix you may want to put the bimini up (deployed) when running as
the forward and aft securement straps will stop the sway (at least it does
in our case.).

If you want I can post link to a pic of our setup.

Why not relevant?  The lateral brace doesn't care about the arch.

Your frame is partially attached to the radar arch.  The arch also prevents

The Arch does nothing to prevent sway, except get in the way. The
attachments of the frame to the Arch do not affect it's stability, pro

Your frame is inside the confines of your radar arch.   It certainly does
add to the stability of the frame and prevents radical sway.

It needs more bracing, attached to something solid.  I'd make an issue
out of it with the dealer before the windshield frame breaks or is
distorted.  Any good boat canvas shop should be able to give you a
quote on what is required.

JR, since you built your own bimini frame, how did you get the width
correct when bending the tubing?
If I had a length of tubing and needed two bends, such as a bimini
frame, and I need a height of 49&quot; and width of 88&quot; and the tubing was of
appropriate length, where would I start the 90d bends?

John-

Any chance you can start a separate thread so I can continue to
receive responses under the original title?

Thanks!

JR, my boat doesn't have as many attach point options as your boat.
if there was a nearby fixture or railing for an easy brace point, I'd
use it.  I'm going to have to add something.

Jim, when deployed (with further bracing action from the forward
straps) the oscillating is cut down somewhat, but it is still pretty
hard on the windshield.

Wayne, the dealer's service department is proving to be fairly
marginal.  They had a lot of trouble getting the 20 hour service and a
very simple warranty punch list right.  I don't know that I'd trust
them with this issue, either as advisors or as implementers.

Thank you, I will. Content and secure in the knowledge that the Lateral
Brace is the ONLY (read O-N-L-Y) thing stabilizing the frame laterally.
&quot;It serves to prevent the Bimini Frame from occillating side to side,
and banging against the Arch.&quot;

There's nothing that says it will be easy. Get creative and add a hard
point that will work for mounting a brace. West Marine catalog-bimini
and railing fittings. I'm SURE there is something there that will work.
Before I built my new frame, I used to stabilize the lateral sway of the
old frame with a simple tie-off of line from one corner of the frame to
a low point. Worked well.

Move your attachment points to the boat and off the windshield.  You may
have enough height with you currrent frame to do that.  Keep in mind that
you don't need it to be much taller than 6'6&quot; from the boat floor inside.
The longer the frame the more it will sway.

The bimini in the picture (your boat?) is not designed to be stowed in
an upright position.  So instead of two hard attach points on each
side, there is only the center point, with the tension provided by
four adjustable straps, probably  counteracting the lateral forces.

When I put a lot of pressure on the front straps (bimini deployed), it
does cut down on the oscillating quite a bit.  Not entirely to my
satisfaction, but much better than when the bimini is stowed.  Another
two straps leading to the back would probably cut it further still,
but that's not a desirable solution.  Too much docking, swimming and
water sports from that part of the boat to want another pair of
straps.

My top snaps to the top of the windshield and has a zippered door at the

For fishing a center console I still prefer a large T-top.

What's the point if you can't walk a fish around the boat?

Sure it doesn't wobble.  It never sees the water.  It also looks like it
wasn't constructed very well or it's not installed correctly.

Yes, indeed, that's something I've had to do twice in 50+ years of
saltwater fishing, and its at the top of the list of techniques on 54'
Bertrams, too.

I don't like tee-tops. Never have. First, they're always there, even
when you don't want them there, second, they're a constant windage
problem on the water, third, they act like drogues when you're
trailering, fourth, they're a pain in the ass when you're trying to put
on a full boat cover, fifth, they increase rocking motion on smaller
boats, and so forth and so on.

But I'm sure they have a lot of appeal to the floating Winnebago crowd.

It does look that way, but it's not as pronounced when on board.
Besides, I have the seats pushed way back for access to the center console.

I thought CC always used T Tops so you can easily walk around the boat
following the fish.   Doesn't a bimini negate the benefit of having a CC?

Interesting idea, but I wonder if it is rigid enough for a tee-top.

The write-up claims that unlike a regular bimini, the tee-top can be left up
for high speed running (tested to 68 mph).   Downside is you can't stand on
it (comparing it to a hard top).
Tubing is available in either aluminum or stainless.

As I said, it is an interesting idea...but not one that interests me.
My new boat has a 6' long perfectly flat deck forward of the center
console for flyfishing, which is all the room I need. No need to &quot;walk
around the boat&quot; chasing a bonefish, because, well, we don't have any
bonefish up here. If I want to liveline or troll or bottom fish, I can
do that from the stern without having to &quot;walk&quot; a fish around the boat.
It's not a technique that occurs around here that often. Most fish can
be controlled from the stern and released near the stern. If I feel like
sightfishing or casting, I can do that from the front of the boat.

The bimini is there simply to fend off the sun on those really hot sunny
days when we're drift fishing or anchored. Most of the time it will be
folded flat, out of the way.

Like you and a couple of others here, I've had a lot of experience in
boats and with a wide variety of boats. What I want in a small fishing
boat has evolved over these many years. This time around, I wanted a
smallish but deep vee center console, high quality but minimalist in
features (stuff I don't need that requires maintenance). There are a
kazillion boat dealers within 50 miles of where I am right now, so my
choices were virtually unlimited. I picked the boat I did for a lot of
reasons, all based upon what *I* wanted, as opposed to what to what some
boat manufacturers think I need or, ever sillier, what some of the
landlocked &quot;boaters&quot; here read somewhere.

Oh...I cut a 2-1/4&quot; hole in a non-structural part of my Parker to
install an accessory. The circle I cut out is 7/16&quot; thick, and consists
of gelcoat and layer after layer of glass cloth and resin. No filler, no
balsa, no foam, no crap. Gelcoat on the outside where you can see it,
and on the inside, where you can't see it unless you cut a hole.

I hear you, and a Parker is indeed a well built boat.  I just wasn't sure if
you were aware of other options for the bimini.

BTW though ...  I may be wrong, but if your intention is to use the forward
section of the boat for fly-fishing ... isn't the bimini installed
backwards?  Seems to me it should fold up aft, rather than forward, leaving
the area forward of the console clear.  The way the braces are set up in
your installation, I think it's designed to fold forward.  Just a thought.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Interesting idea, but I wonder if it is rigid enough for a tee-top.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those tubes look pretty thin.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The write-up claims that unlike a regular bimini, the tee-top can be left
&gt;&gt;&gt; up for high speed running (tested to 68 mph).   Downside is you can't
&gt;&gt;&gt; stand on it (comparing it to a hard top).
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tubing is available in either aluminum or stainless.

&gt;&gt; As I said, it is an interesting idea...but not one that interests me.
&gt;&gt; My new boat has a 6' long perfectly flat deck forward of the center
&gt;&gt; console for flyfishing, which is all the room I need. No need to &quot;walk
&gt;&gt; around the boat&quot; chasing a bonefish, because, well, we don't have any
&gt;&gt; bonefish up here. If I want to liveline or troll or bottom fish, I can do
&gt;&gt; that from the stern without having to &quot;walk&quot; a fish around the boat. It's
&gt;&gt; not a technique that occurs around here that often. Most fish can be
&gt;&gt; controlled from the stern and released near the stern. If I feel like
&gt;&gt; sightfishing or casting, I can do that from the front of the boat.

&gt;&gt; The bimini is there simply to fend off the sun on those really hot sunny
&gt;&gt; days when we're drift fishing or anchored. Most of the time it will be
&gt;&gt; folded flat, out of the way.

&gt;&gt; Like you and a couple of others here, I've had a lot of experience in
&gt;&gt; boats and with a wide variety of boats. What I want in a small fishing
&gt;&gt; boat has evolved over these many years. This time around, I wanted a
&gt;&gt; smallish but deep vee center console, high quality but minimalist in
&gt;&gt; features (stuff I don't need that requires maintenance). There are a
&gt;&gt; kazillion boat dealers within 50 miles of where I am right now, so my
&gt;&gt; choices were virtually unlimited. I picked the boat I did for a lot of
&gt;&gt; reasons, all based upon what *I* wanted, as opposed to what to what some
&gt;&gt; boat manufacturers think I need or, ever sillier, what some of the
&gt;&gt; landlocked &quot;boaters&quot; here read somewhere.

&gt;&gt; Oh...I cut a 2-1/4&quot; hole in a non-structural part of my Parker to install
&gt;&gt; an accessory. The circle I cut out is 7/16&quot; thick, and consists of gelcoat
&gt;&gt; and layer after layer of glass cloth and resin. No filler, no balsa, no
&gt;&gt; foam, no crap. Gelcoat on the outside where you can see it, and on the
&gt;&gt; inside, where you can't see it unless you cut a hole.

It folds flat and rests on the small forward deck. It has a cover. It
won't be in my way; I went flyfishing a few weeks ago with a fellow who
has the same set up.

Just so you know I am consistent, I have no use for wheel-based RV
condos, either.

Well, we sort of agree on that one.  Conceptually I can see the
potential appeal, but the reality looks quite different, at least in
south Florida.  Almost all of the RV parks that I see are so jammed
that they look like parking lots, very unappealing for the most part.
There are a few exceptions but not that many.

The difference between rolling and floating is that the &quot;wheel RVs&quot;
are highly restricted in where they can park.  Not true on a
liveaboard boat although there are those who would like fewer
anchorages.
