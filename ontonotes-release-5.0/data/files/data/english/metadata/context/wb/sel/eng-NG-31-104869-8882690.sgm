Everyone,

Kerry Walker has been a PC member (Patrick Crusade) and a friend for several  years.  In 2001, he was a victim of a violent crime wherein he was brutally  assaulted.  However, the State of Georgia, specifically Cherokee County,  turned everything around and ended up fabricating evidence in an wild  attempt to convict Kerry Walker of the very assault for which he suffered,  meanwhile letting the perpetrator (a woman) go free.  Have you ever heard of a woman beating up a man?  I'm sure you  have.

This is a very bizarre case.  You can read up on the  voluminous details at http://www.patrickcrusade.org/Kerry_Walker.html

After several years of fighting &quot;city hall&quot; in his own  unique and persistent way, Kerry managed to expose the fact that Cherokee  County actually did fabricate evidence against him and actually had conspired to  falsely convict him, and the case was to be dismissed.  Bravo for  Kerry!  Or so we all thought.

Sadly, this case is still not closed.  Even the local  media is willing to cover up the truth, and that's the point of this email to  all of you.

Kerry tape records and video tapes everything he does and  everyone with whom he speaks regarding the corruption in his case.  He's  recently captured the local media players on film as well as the local police,  telling him he will be arrested if he ever returns to the media's office again  for an interview.

This case and ensuing harassment has been going on way too  long.  I think Kerry Walker deserves to get his life back, don't you?   The public deserves to hear an untainted story from the press, and the judge  needs to close this case and go after the real criminals - the fabricators of  evidence and those who conspired to falsely arrest him.

I urge everyone to watch the video links below and then write  to the email addresses below demanding that they cover the story in truth and  reminding them it isn't right to cover up police and judicial corruption.   They are working hard to paint a picture of Kerry Walker as a &quot;madman&quot; when all  Kerry is doing is TRYING to expose the corruption.  Certainly he is  obsessed with his case.  You all know how that is when you talk about YOUR  cases, trying to get someone - anyone - to listen.  This, you will see in  the video clips below.  Were justice not a thing of the past, and something  we could all expect, none of us would be pushing hard to be heard.  Let's  not allow the press to paint any more bad stuff about a man who wants to expose  just how corrupt the judicial system really is in his own county.

I think it's time we all gather together as a team to put this  newspaper in its place.  You all know the drill.  Please give it your  best and MOST POTENT shot.  Emails from around the world should let these  local pretenders know they are being watched.  Please feel free to  copy the text below titled &quot;Nightmare in Georgia&quot; in your emails to the Cherokee  TV and The Cherokee Tribune.  Also, please pass  this on to all of your groups for their action too.

Nightmare in Georgia (videos)
by Kerry Walker

I was  the victim of a violent crime (violent beating) and then I was attacked again in  my own home. I was falsely arrested as the &quot;perpetrator&quot; by (Detective?) Preston  Peavy!! Mr. Peavy ignored exculpatory evidence as well as the only witness  at the scene, whose statement would have exonerated me  completely. This investigator went on to commit back-to-back  felonies over the course of years in his every attempt to manufacture my guilt,  and others in the “just-us” system covered up for him.

This is  a video done in parking lot of the local newspaper, where I just happened to  catch Ashley Fuller, the &quot;investigative&quot; reporter who considered but never  investigated a case involving incredible acts of criminal activity and  corruption by law enforcement and the courts in Cherokee County, Georgia.  The decision not to cover this story was on the orders of the Editor in Chief,  Barbara Jacoby, who had told me that &quot;they&quot; told her my story was not true.  Contempt prior to investigation is the highest form of ignorance. The  truth----The local media covers up for corruption in this town.

Tainted Media?!!!

Ashley  Fuller knew that The Cherokee Tribune had covered up for incredible  felony crimes committed by (Detective?) Preston Peavy and others within the  (in)justice system. At the end of the interview Ashley Fuller agreed to  investigate my case and agreed that my request was &quot;fair&quot;, but his  boss, Barbara Jacoby, ended any investigation, as she has for several  years, and then called &quot;911&quot; to keep me off the property of the local  paper. She probably did this to keep me from interviewing her and getting to  bottom of her involvement in the cover up of judicial and police corruption  in this town. There is a lot going on here in my town with my case, but none  of it has been covered in the local papers or on CherokeeTV.  Would you believe the Violent Crimes Unit showed up at my cabin because I shot  video of a reporter in a parking lot?

Violent Crimes Unit?!!!

The two  videos to follow show the interview with Attorney Jeff Rusbridge, with Dyer and  Rusbridge, PC, in Canton, Georgia. At my trial he attempted to get my case  dismissed because of &quot;Felony Tampering with Evidence&quot;, but Judge Sumner covered  up for these criminal actions and let my case drag on while my life was consumed  by this bizarre battle and my family suffered severely, and my sweet dear mother  died under the duress and pressure of this nightmare. At my first trial (that  came to an abrupt end), I decided it was in my best interest for Mr. Rusbridge  to be relieved as my attorney in order for him to become a powerful witness in  my case.

In this  interview he confirms that everything I say about this case is the absolute  truth and that I never deviate from the facts in any way. I lost my dream home  that I custom designed and built from the ground up and almost everything I  owned in a battle that should have never been fought.

Please  listen to this statement----There are thousands of innocent people in  prison who are not guilty of the crimes they are convicted  of. They wake up every day in a prison cell that they should not be in, and the  public does not care, and nothing is done to help them gain freedom. This  nightmare goes on for some good people and their families—all the while the real  perpetrator is free to strike again!!!

This attorney makes it clear in this video that  the government did everything in their power to put a man that was the victim of  a violent beating and other acts of violence, and had committed no crime,  in prison for 30 years. (This video is in two parts, but the first part gives  you most of the facts.)
