***********************************************************

If we praise God in our trials, our burdens will turn into blessings.

If we put our trust and hope in God, we will never be let down.

When we face a difficult task, an important decision, or a baffling
dilemmas, our first step should be to pray for God's power and guidance.

God is concerned for all creatures, no matter how small.

God's mercy and patience are infinite.

As we trust God to teach us, we will learn to be more like Christ.

With every sunrise, remember God's goodness.

Everything we do to serve those in need, we do for God.

Dressed For Battle
The life of a soldier at war is difficult.  They live under the constant
threat of attack.  Each day they must prepare for battle.  Each day they
must make sure they are properly dressed to face the enemy. We are ALL
at war!  Every child of God faces an enemy who is determined to engage
them in battle each and every day.  These battles will not look the same
as those we see on television; &quot;For our struggle is not against flesh
and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the
powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in
the heavenly realms&quot; (Ephesians 6:12).  But the enemy we face is just as
real and the attacks are just as damaging.  Many of us feel defenseless
against such attacks, we feel defeated and without hope.  But Paul tells
us how to get properly dressed and stand through every battle.
Ephesians 6:14-17 &quot;Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled
around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and
with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of
peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which
you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the
helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.&quot;
Yes, the attacks are going to come.  But we cannot wait for the battle
to begin before getting dressed and putting on our equipment.  Each day
(without fail!), before the enemy has an opportunity to attack, we must
&quot;put on the full armor of God&quot; (Ephesians 6:13).
The belt of truth protects us from the enemy's deceptive lies which pull
us down the path of worldly priorities and temptation.  The breastplate
of righteousness protects our heart from feeling unworthy - we are made
completely worthy through faith in Jesus (Romans 3:22).  The gospel of
peace on our feet prepares us to share the good news of Jesus and &quot;go
and make disciples of all nations&quot; (Matthew 28:19).  Sharing the good
news is our mission as we go into the world.
We hold up the shield of faith - which is &quot;of greater worth than gold&quot;
(1 Peter 1:7) - to remind us of God's faithfulness in previous battles
and protect us from the constant arrows of fear.  The helmet of
Salvation protects our mind from debilitating doubts; &quot;so that we may
know we have eternal life&quot; (1 John 5:13).  Finally, we pick up the sword
of the Spirit and directly engage the enemy by walking in obedient
submission to the Word of God: &quot;Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist
the devil, and he will flee from you&quot; (James 4:7).
The enemy is determined to steal our joy and cause us to be ineffective
soldiers for God.  Let's ruin his plan!  Let's defeat the enemy before
the attacks even begin by starting each and every day with getting fully
dressed for battle. Have a Christ Centered Day!  --Steve Troxel

The Protection of His Armor
In the message &quot;Dressed For Battle&quot; we considered how we all face an
enemy who seeks to engage us in battle each and every day.  The attacks
are deceptive but extremely methodical as the enemy tries to pull, push,
and lure us off the path of following after Christ.  We then saw how our
best defense against such attacks is to get properly dressed by putting
on the full armor of God; &quot;so that when the day of evil comes, you may
be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to
stand&quot; (Ephesians 6:13).
The next natural question to ask is, &quot;How do I put on the armor of
God?&quot;  Though we may recognize the usefulness of God's armor, it will
never do us any good unless we actually know how to put it on.
Psalm 27:8 &quot;My heart says of You, 'Seek His face!' Your face, Lord, I
will seek.&quot;
The armor of God is only available to those who diligently &quot;Seek His
face!&quot;, to those who have given Him the totality of their life through a
submissive faith in Jesus Christ.  The armor of God is not a self-help
formula to keep us protected, focused, and driven as we advance up the
&quot;ladder of success&quot; in the world's system.  It's a covering of
protection God provides as we enter into His presence and are reminded
of His truth, faithfulness, and majesty.
Getting dressed for battle is therefore never a Spiritual checklist or
routine set of prayers.  We receive His armor - in effect, He dresses us
- as we humble ourselves and come before Him in prayer with a heart that
desires to follow wherever He leads.  Our Heavenly Father will never let
us enter our daily battles without proper protection if we are diligent
in seeking Him; &quot;The lions may grow weak and hungry, but those who seek
the Lord lack no good thing&quot; (Psalm 34:10).
How often should we seek Him?  Well, how often do we wish to be attacked
in our underwear?  Getting dressed is not a one-time Salvation event nor
even just a first thing in the morning event.  We must put on His armor
and keep it on throughout our day by developing the priority and habit
of constant communion with God; &quot;Be joyful always; pray continually;
give thanks in all circumstances&quot; (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18).  His
protection against the enemy comes only as we enter and remain in His
presence.
The attacks will surely come; but they need not be feared if we are
properly dressed.  Let's learn to walk and minister in this world
without ever leaving the presence of the Lord.  Let's seek Him in all we
do and live with the protection of His armor. Have a Christ Centered
Day!  --Steve Troxel

&quot;A FRESH START&quot;
I was able to make a fresh start recently. It felt so good to be able to
put all of those past mistakes behind me. It felt so wonderful to be
able to look towards the future with clear eyes and a clean heart. It
felt so glorious to greet the new day with a peaceful mind and a joyful
soul.
I didn't get my fresh start by moving to another town, however.  I
didn't get it by starting a new job. I didn't get it by going on
vacation.  I didn't get it by buying something either. I didn't get it
by changing the world around me at all. Those types of changes never
work anyway. You can't clean your house by sweeping the sidewalk, after all.
How did I get my fresh start then? Why, I simply opened my eyes this
morning. You see, everyday of our lives can be a fresh start if we wish.
Each new morning is another gift from God when we can begin again to
clean our house within and to live our lives better than we did before.
Each new day is a fresh beginning to choose love, create joy, spread
laughter, help others, and give something back to the world. Each new
moment is another chance to share a hug, a smile, a compliment, or an
act of kindness. It doesn't matter how many mistakes we have made, wrong
turns we have taken, or days we have wasted. We all can begin again this
morning, this day, and right now. God is there waiting to help us to
live and love as we were meant to.
There is an old saying that goes, &quot;If you wake up breathing, you have
another chance.&quot; Don't waste your chance today. Make your fresh start
now. Wake up this morning and say, &quot;Good morning God! Thank you for my
life!&quot; Then go out and live it in joy, love, and oneness with Him.  Open
your heart, soul, and mind to the love, goodness, and delight that is
all around you. Share all the wonder, talent, compassion, and uniqueness
that is within you. Help to build a better world with the life you live
in it. And seize each new day as a fresh start to live and love.
--Joseph J. Mazzella

Freckles on a nose By Karen Collum
I have a prominent freckle on my nose. I've been self-conscious of it
ever since I was a child. Once I remember a friend's mother handing me a
serviette saying, &quot;You've got something on your nose&quot;. I was so embarrassed.
Recently, my two-year-old son noticed my freckle. He looked at me
closely and with the honesty of a child said, &quot;Mummy, nose dirty&quot;.
I instantly felt the old wave of embarrassment sweep over me. All those
years have passed, and I am still self-conscious about that freckle!
You might have some features you are overly sensitive about too. Your
ears might be too big, you might be very talkative, and you might have
an unusual laugh!
It's a relief to know that while others may sometimes judge us on our
outward appearance, God looks at what's on the inside.
&quot;God judges persons differently than humans do. Men and women look at
the face; God looks into the heart.&quot; 1 Samuel 16:7
Allow God to cultivate your inner beauty!

***********************************************************

Have you ever had a time when nothing seems to be going right? No matter
what you do, everywhere you turn, it just seems like your world is
falling apart, seemingly without any means of escape.
When bewilderment enshrouds you, and despair looms at your door, when
trials storm the beaches of your life you may want to ask God... &quot;Why?&quot;
You may never understand why things are happening the way they are in
your life. But that's not your job. It is not necessary for you to know
why. That is God's question! Your response is all that matters. When we
can't feel His hand, we must trust His heart! Our job is to simply trust
and obey!
Is there something happening in your life for which you have no
explanation, but longing for answers? Ask God to give you peace and
grace to trust Him! He is working out the details of your deliverance!
Job asked God why many times when he went through suffering. But God did
not answer his questions, but asked him many questions.
David asked Him why! &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are
you so far from saving me, so far from the words of my groaning?&quot; (Psalm
22:1) But no answer.
Jesus, the Son of David, asked the same question to God His Father.
&quot;From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the
land. About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 'Eloi, Eloi,
lama sabachthani?'&quot; which means, &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken
me?&quot; (Matthew27:45, 46) The Father God gave no answer. Jesus just
trusted His Father and committed His life into His hands.
When we are faced with confused situations, our question should not be
why, but what.
Do not ask God &quot;Why did You allow this to happen?&quot; But rather, ask God,
&quot;What do You want me to learn through this?&quot;
That's what Saul on the road to Damascus asked Jesus whom he was
persecuting. When Saul was out of God's will, he had a fall and he
became blind and humbled. He asked Jesus, &quot;Lord, what do You want me to
do?&quot; (Acts 9:6)
May God reveal His will to you that you may please Him to bless you!
--Senior Pastor Timothy Satryan

The Glove
&quot;You're so quiet, Son. What's on your mind?&quot; asked Ben's father as he
stopped at Ben's room to tell him good night.
Ben put his hands behind his head and stared at the ceiling above his
bed. &quot;Oh, I've just been wondering if I should be a missionary.&quot;
&quot;You don't seem very excited about the idea,&quot; said Dad.
&quot;It seems like such a hard job,&quot; said Ben, propping himself up on one
elbow. &quot;I have this feeling that I might not be any good at it. What if
God calls me to do something I can't do!&quot;
Ben's father thought for a moment, then reached over to Ben's desk and
picked up his baseball glove. &quot;What's this?&quot; he asked.
Ben laughed. &quot;Don't be silly, Dad! It's my ball glove.&quot;
Dad walked over to the corner of the room. He propped the glove against
the wall, found a baseball, and threw it at the glove. Though the ball
hit the center of the glove, it rolled to the floor. Dad picked up the
glove and looked at it in disgust. &quot;This glove is a total failure,&quot; he
said, shaking his head.
Ben laughed and laughed. &quot;Oh, Dad, you know it can't catch by itself! It
has to have a hand inside.&quot;
Dan smiled at Ben. &quot;You're just like this glove,&quot; he said. &quot;God has a
purpose for your life, Ben, just as there is a purpose for this glove.
You put your hand inside the glove to give it guidance and strength --
you give it power to catch the ball. In the same way, God will give you
power to do whatever He calls you to do. Don't worry, Son, God will
never prop you in a corner and leave you alone. It's His mighty hand
that does the work when you are willing to be used.&quot;
&quot;Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by
itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless
you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains
in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do
nothing.&quot; -- John 15:4-5  --Author Unknown

Small Straws In A Soft Wind by Marsha Burns
Now is the time when you can find answers to questions or conclusions to
long-standing dilemmas.  You can now get closure on things that have
kept you from moving forward in the flow of spiritual progression.  Even
though this time may cause some consternation or make you feel unsettled
temporarily, you will soon have a sense of relief and freedom.  Rise up
and rejoice in a new beginning, says the Lord.
Psalm 146:5-10 Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose
hope is in the LORD his God, Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
that is in them; Who keeps truth forever, Who executes justice for the
oppressed, Who gives food to the hungry. The LORD gives freedom to the
prisoners.  The LORD opens the eyes of the blind; the LORD raises those
who are bowed down; the LORD loves the righteous.   The LORD watches
over the strangers; He relieves the fatherless and widow; but the way of
the wicked He turns upside down.  The LORD shall reign forever----Your
God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise the LORD!

Beloved, quiet your soul and discern.  Satan has sent a prince of
darkness against you to block the anointing and stop the flow of My
Spirit in your midst.  Its operation is like the  jamming of radio
signals, and it covers you with a spiritual blanket of fog to hinder My
work in and around you.  Its purpose is to bring discouragement and
condemnation to you.  Rise up, My people and break this assignment, shut
the door in the devil's face, and allow your faith to become a shield
against this intrusion.  I declare to you that victory is assured, says
the Lord.
Ephesians 6:12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but
against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the
heavenly places.

I will do a particular and valuable work in your heart if you will allow
it.  I will reveal all stubbornness and rebellion that cause you to want
things to be according to own your will instead of yielding by the
Spirit to My will.  Your unwillingness springs from your carnal nature
and hinders the flow of spiritual blessings in your life.  I speak to
many who have lived your life trying to manipulate situations,
circumstances and people so that you could be in control.  The sense of
being in control is a comfort to your flesh, but it hinders the flow of
My Spirit.  My ways are higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your
thoughts.  I will bring you to your highest good and greatest blessings
if you will allow Me to do this work, says the Lord.
Galatians 6:8 For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap
corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap
everlasting life.

You can expect for the spiritual fog to begin to lift so that you can
see with greater clarity.  The decisions that you make at this time will
be born out of truth and justice rather than coming from a need to
simply survive.  You can enter into this place of righteous momentum by
the Spirit, which will open a direct way through a maze of dead ends
that you have experienced in the recent past.  But, you must align your
will with Mine, says the Lord, by asking in faith for divine guidance
and then by yielding to My direction.
Proverbs 4:12 When you walk, your steps will not be hindered, And when
you run, you will not stumble.

My people, you will now begin to see the unveiling of a new order in My
kingdom.  In this time I will establish truth and justice, and in  this
process hidden indiscretions will come to light and will be judged, for
you are entering a time of disclosure.  By the same token, those who
have committed sins and have lost fellowship with Me will begin to seek
to be restored to their kingdom position.  Their restoration will depend
on whether or not they are truly repentant.  Those who have an ear to
hear will begin to raise up a standard of spiritual and moral integrity
for this new plateau.  You will be required to question what you really
believe, and thus define your doctrine more precisely.  You will have to
examine your code of ethics to make sure that your responses are
consistent with the Word.   Be on guard, for this new level of kingdom
experience will be met with opposition from the enemy.  This war will be
called the Battle of Integrity as you face circumstances, situations,
tests and trials that reveal your heart.  War is always required to take
new spiritual territory.  If you yield to the work of My Spirit, you can
win these battles one decision at a time as you establish and maintain
integrity.  You, My Church, are in a process of preparation, which will
result in your being without spot and blameless, says the Lord.
Ephesians 5:25 -27  Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved
the church and gave Himself for her, that He might sanctify and cleanse
her with the washing of water by the word, that He might present her to
Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing,
but that she should be holy and without blemish.

&quot;Today Is A Brand New Day&quot;
As the days go by
my youthful appearance fades
I begin to look within
where true beauty lays
How much beauty I find depends
on the time and effort I have put in
have I any or have I none
how many battles have I won but lost
or lost but won
Today this does not matter
for today is a brand new day
a brand new beginning
to live life in a brand new way
Today I shall put in time and effort
to let my true beauty shine
to others I will offer
love, comfort, encouragement, support and understanding
and leave my yesterdays behind

THE DIFFERENCE
I got up early one morning
and rushed right into the day;
I had so much to accomplish
that I didn't have time to pray.
Problems just tumbled about me,
and heavier came each task.
Why doesn't God help me? I wondered.
He answered, You didn't ask.
I wanted to see joy and beauty,
but the day toiled on, gray and bleak;
I wondered why God didn't show me.
He said, But you didn't seek.
I tried to come into God's presence;
I used all my keys at the lock.
God gently and lovingly chided,
My child, you didn't knock.
I woke up early this morning,
and paused before entering the day;
I had so much to accomplish
that I had to take time to pray.
--Author Unknown

***********************************************************

Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his
compassions never fail.23 They are new every morning; great is your
faithfulness.24 I say to myself, &quot;The LORD is my portion; therefore I
will wait for him.&quot;25 The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to
the one who seeks him;26 it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of
the LORD.  Lamentations 3:22-26

The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector
9To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down
on everybody else, Jesus told this parable: 10&quot;Two men went up to the
temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11The
Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: 'God, I thank you that I am
not like other men---robbers, evildoers, adulterers---or even like this
tax collector. 12I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'
13&quot;But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up
to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a
sinner.' 14&quot;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home
justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled,
and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&quot;  Luke 18:9-14

Find rest, O my soul, in God alone; my hope comes from him.  He alone is
my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.  My
salvation and my honor depend on God; he is my mighty rock, my refuge.
Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts to him, for
God is our refuge.  Psalm 62:5-8

Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our
troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort
we ourselves have received from God.  2 Corinthians 3-4

God's Love and Ours
7Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God.
Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 8Whoever does not
love does not know God, because God is love. 9This is how God showed his
love among us: He sent his one and only Son[b] into the world that we
might live through him. 10This is love: not that we loved God, but that
he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
11Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one
another. 12No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God
lives in us and his love is made complete in us. 13We know that we live
in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. 14And we
have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior
of the world. 15If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God
lives in him and he in God. 16And so we know and rely on the love God
has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in
him. 17In this way, love is made complete among us so that we will have
confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like
him. 18There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear,
because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made
perfect in love.19We love because he first loved us. 20If anyone says,
&quot;I love God,&quot; yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does
not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not
seen. 21And he has given us this command: Whoever loves God must also
love his brother.  1 John 4:7-21

3Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility
consider others better than yourselves. 4Each of you should look not
only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.
Philippians 2:3-4

16Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's
Spirit lives in you? 17If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy
him; for God's temple is sacred, and you are that temple.  1 Corinthians
3:16-17

***********************************************************

Are you so hungry to own more money that your money owns you?
In Mark 10:17-22, we read the story of a man who asked Jesus, &quot;what must
I do to inherit eternal life?&quot; The man had followed all the
commandments; however, Jesus told him, &quot;One thing you lack. Go, sell
everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in
heaven. Then come, follow me.&quot; At this the man's face fell. He went away
sad, because he had great wealth.
Jesus told him that he lacked &quot;one thing&quot;, which is implied to be a
relationship with God. The man had followed the commandments; however,
he didn't know God. He knew the laws, but not the God who made the laws.
Interestingly, that &quot;one thing&quot; is exactly the same as what David wanted
(see Psalm 27:4).
In order to inherit eternal life, the man needed a personal relationship
with Christ. However, Jesus knew that the man's money was holding him
back. When Jesus told him to &quot;sell everything&quot; for the Kingdom, the man
went away -- he turned his back on a relationship with God.
The reason that he turned his back on a relationship with God was
because he owned so much money that, really, his money owned him. That
is, he loved his money more than he loved God. His face fell and he went
away sad, because he didn't want to give up his money. So he picked
money (wealth and worldly possessions) instead of a relationship with God.
In this man we clearly see the principle that where your treasure is,
there your heart will be also (Matthew 6:21). His treasure (that is,
what he valued) was his money; so, when Jesus asked for his heart, the
man refused the offer, and, as a result, he went away sad.
Are you so attached to your money and possessions that they have become
more valuable to you than God? Do you want money so much that it
dictates how you use your time? If so, God requires that you put Him
first, but in exchange you get the most valuable thing in the world -- a
relationship with God. Therefore, examine your life and make sure that
you're not so hungry to own more money than your money owns you.

Patience In Prayer
When the idea is not right, God says, &quot;NO.&quot;
No -- when the idea is not the best.
No -- when the idea is absolutely wrong.
No -- when though it may help you, it would create problems for someone
else.
When the time is not right, God says, &quot;SLOW.&quot;
What a catastrophe it would be if God answered every prayer at the snap
of your fingers.
Do you know what would happen?
God would become your servant, not your master.
Suddenly God would be working for you instead of you working for God.
When you are not right, God says, &quot;GROW.&quot;
The selfish person has to grow in unselfishness.
The cautious person must grow in courage.
The timid person must grow in confidence,
The dominating person must grow in sensitivity.
The critical person must grow in tolerance.
The negative person must grow in positive attitudes.
The pleasure seeking person must grow in compassion for suffering people.
When everything is all right, God says, &quot;GO.&quot;
Then miracles happen:
A hopeless alcoholic is set free.
A drug addict finds release.
A doubter becomes a child in his belief.
Diseased tissue responds to treatment, and healing begins.
The door to your dream suddenly swings open and there stands God saying,
&quot;GO!&quot;
Remember: God's delays are not God's denials.
God's timing is perfect.
Patience is what we need in prayer

Read Through The Bible
Signs for Moses
1 Moses answered, &quot;What if they do not believe me or listen to me and
say, 'The LORD did not appear to you'?&quot; 2 Then the LORD said to him,
&quot;What is that in your hand?&quot; &quot;A staff,&quot; he replied. 3 The LORD said,
&quot;Throw it on the ground.&quot;  Moses threw it on the ground and it became a
snake, and he ran from it. 4 Then the LORD said to him, &quot;Reach out your
hand and take it by the tail.&quot; So Moses reached out and took hold of the
snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand. 5 &quot;This,&quot; said the
LORD, &quot;is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their
fathers---the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of
Jacob---has appeared to you.&quot; 6 Then the LORD said, &quot;Put your hand
inside your cloak.&quot; So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he
took it out, it was leprous, like snow. 7 &quot;Now put it back into your
cloak,&quot; he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he
took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh. 8 Then the
LORD said, &quot;If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first
miraculous sign, they may believe the second. 9 But if they do not
believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile
and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will
become blood on the ground.&quot; 10 Moses said to the LORD, &quot;O Lord, I have
never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to
your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.&quot; 11 The LORD said to him,
&quot;Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight
or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD ? 12 Now go; I will help you
speak and will teach you what to say.&quot; 13 But Moses said, &quot;O Lord,
please send someone else to do it.&quot; 14 Then the LORD's anger burned
against Moses and he said, &quot;What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I
know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and his
heart will be glad when he sees you. 15 You shall speak to him and put
words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you
what to do. 16 He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if
he were your mouth and as if you were God to him. 17 But take this staff
in your hand so you can perform miraculous signs with it.&quot;
Moses Returns to Egypt
18 Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him,
&quot;Let me go back to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are
still alive.&quot; Jethro said, &quot;Go, and I wish you well.&quot;
19 Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, &quot;Go back to Egypt, for all
the men who wanted to kill you are dead.&quot; 20 So Moses took his wife and
sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the
staff of God in his hand. 21 The LORD said to Moses, &quot;When you return to
Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given
you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let
the people go. 22 Then say to Pharaoh, 'This is what the LORD says:
Israel is my firstborn son, 23 and I told you, &quot;Let my son go, so he may
worship me.&quot; But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your
firstborn son.' &quot; 24 At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met {Moses}
and was about to kill him. 25 But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off
her son's foreskin and touched {Moses'} feet with it. &quot;Surely you are a
bridegroom of blood to me,&quot; she said. 26 So the LORD let him alone. (At
that time she said &quot;bridegroom of blood,&quot; referring to circumcision.) 27
The LORD said to Aaron, &quot;Go into the desert to meet Moses.&quot; So he met
Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him. 28 Then Moses told Aaron
everything the LORD had sent him to say, and also about all the
miraculous signs he had commanded him to perform. 29 Moses and Aaron
brought together all the elders of the Israelites, 30 and Aaron told
them everything the LORD had said to Moses. He also performed the signs
before the people, 31 and they believed. And when they heard that the
LORD was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down
and worshiped.
