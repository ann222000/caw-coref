I never intentionally ride in the rain (I am a new rider) but am going
to be taking a training course at the end of October in the
northeast.  One of the requirements of the class is to bring rain gear
since the class is rain or shine.  Typically at the end of October the
temperature will be in the 50s.

I would like to buy some rain gear online I have been looking at
various sites desribing sizing and it is usually based on chest size.
I do not have a typical body shape.  I am about 5'8&quot;, 240 pounds,
weightlifter muscular but also with a bit of a gut so clothes often
fit me wierdly.  I have short, thick limbs so sometimes long sleeves
and pant legs are ok because the thick limbs cause them to &quot;shorten&quot; a
bit.

Do these suits usually have adjustable arm and leg lengths?  From the
pictures I have seen they look pretty baggy.

Are these suits meant to be worn over leather jackets?  If so, should
I measure my size while wearing the jacket or are they assuming some
sort of thick underclothes?

Any advice welcomed.  Thanks and have a round on me.

Doesn't mean it will be raining but a rain suit comes in handy when you
under estimate the chill in the air.  They can take the edge off even when
it's dry out.

I wouldn't buy online.  You need to try this stuff on at the dealer with and
without leathers.

Start working kettle bells for the gut.

For a reason.  It's meant to get on in a timely fashion over your boots and
leathers without restricting movement.  Often when the sky opens up with no
warning.

Don't measure.  Go to a dealer (HD, Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, whatever).  See
above.

One more thing.

If your feet and hands get wet all the money spent on everything else won't
mean a thing.  Don't forget the extremities.

Go to Boaters World, or Google &quot;Against the Elements&quot; &amp; find a local
dealer.  Against the Elements makes the best rain gear I've ever worn.  If you
put it on correctly, you can't get wet.  When you try it on wear your boots, &amp;
leave room for your leathers or what ever cold weather gear you use.

Been asleep here a while but thought I'd give my 2c worth.
When considering a rain suite I look for packability (if such word
exists) and lightweight. That being sed try on a suit while wearing
your leathers.  My jacket is made by HD not that I care, it simply had
all my requirements. A full velcro/gusset down the front to channel
water down, an inside cuff on the sleeves and eaqualy important good
reflectivity - orange/black/and lots of reflective material.
Now the pants. I went to a back packing store and again I looked at
ease of putting on these things with full leathers and zippers all the
way on the side with a flap to avoid rain getting in - yes a gusset
down the side helps too. The ones I own are made by Red Ledge.
Boots: I think the name of the company is Exigen - iduno, mebe
Kickstart will post here since I gave him a bike cover made by the
same company. I think I paid 10 bucks if that and bought a back-up
since they are thin confy and *waterproof* and pack very, very small.
Gloves - hehehe as a scuba guy I just take my trusty neopreme gloves
and the temp inside will be warm albeit wet. Nothing matches and some
stuff is expensive and some not so much. Butt, as anyone will tell
you, when your riding down the road toasty and dry with a smile on yer
face...it will all go downhill when you feel that first lil drop of
cold water hit your left nut.
Lastly, tires tend to *scallop* - after long distances - watchyerself
on the twisty-turneys

Hey Pat, slide the Mason jar to this end of the bar.

I picked up a set of these a few weeks ago, haven't had the opportunity to
try them out yet but they seem like they might do the trick and the price
was right.

http://www.motorcycle-superstore.com/1/1/41/2472/ITEM/Fieldsheer-Over...

Bear had something similar from Exigent ( http://exigentbikecovers.com ) but
when I called I was told they no longer make them.  I did pick up a pair of
Exigent boot covers on his suggestion though; still waiting to try them too.

Sooner or later I always get caught in the rain.

I was in need of a jacket and the HD dealer is actually the nearest place to
get ride gear so I went there to see what they had. I ended up with their
version of a mesh coat with armor, outer (removable) shell, and inner rain
liner. (And a big fucking stupid &quot;Harley Davidson&quot; on the front, but I
didn't give a shit as the price was right and the jacket met my needs. Plus
it's on the outer shell, so it only shows when it's cold enough that the
mesh over sweatshirt isn't enough.)

Turns out that the rain liner fits over the coat, even though it's intended
to be a liner. Works great for &quot;getting caught&quot; in the rain during the daily
commute home ( I tend to not ride to work if it's raining in the morning).

If you look at the pic I just posted across the street of Prospect Hill, the
little pack on the luggage rack has the liner and some gators inside, and
the outer shell is strapped on top.

I don't yet have rain pants. I need some. The jacket and the gators keep my
torso, calves, and feet dry, but the water puddles on the seat right under
my testicles. Now, I'm pretty robust when it comes to the rain or the cold,
being from New England and all, but you put the two of them together and it
makes for a downright miserable ride for the ball sack.

My vote is for Frogg Toggs.  Cheap (about $50 brand new on eBay),
ultra-lightweight (less than a pound), with plenty of reflective
piping.  Feels like you're wearing a paper bag until you wash them,
then they're fine.  They're supposed to be breathable, unlike the
rubber or PVC rainsuits, but I find they don't breath really well.
YMMV.

No adjustable lengths here.

They're meant to be worn over the leather jacket, but I also wear
mine as a general purpose windbreaker/raincoat without the leather.

As others have suggested, go to a local retailer and try one on for
size.  Like me, you don't have an &quot;off-the-rack&quot; body, so the
matching pants will seem to be made for freakishly tall people with
bizarre proportions.

Ride safe!

I have a pair of their boot covers.  Great price.  Both take up about as

go to a backpacking/climbing outfitter and try on gauntlett style goretex
mountaineering gloves.  look for ones with removable liners.  wear them
without liners for just rain and with the liners when it is cold.  i use a
pair of marmot gloves and my hands stay very dry, even in a downpour.
brands to shop for mountain hardware, marmot, north face, arc teryx...
these companies all make goretex gaiters for your feet also.  when it rains
i wear nothing but goretex.  it is the best at stopping water and wind while
still remaining breathable.

Nice if I was going to be gutting hogs.

Technically it fit the bill, so I'll be kegging the dunkelweizen this

I used these years ago when I drove a fuel oil delivery truck. They are

I first started riding, and they fit the bill. Just don't listen to Chilly.
