My passenger side front brake caliper has seized. (1997 1.4 Style)

Is there any way I can free it up again, or do I need to replace it?

If replacement is required what would be a ball park figure of getting it
done at a garage?

Thanks.

I think you can still get seals for them. But before you buy them,
remove the pads and pump the piston nearly out and see whether there
is any corrosion on the piston. If so, get a new caliper. Should be
around Â£100, I think, at a factors or online, and a garage should take
no more than an hour to fit and bleed.
These normally seize due to not changing brake fluid regularly (every
two years at least).
