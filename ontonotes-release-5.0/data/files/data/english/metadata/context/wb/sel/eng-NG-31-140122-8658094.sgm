One of only a couple bright spots last night.  He is clearly a natural
madman FB, programmed to smash.  Will be interesting to see his impact
this season blocking for Jones &amp; Washington, signers of the
Declaration of Jets Independence.

Rule thanks for posting this. You and someone else (sorry for the poor
acknowledgment) noticed this and you are right. I followed him on
several plays and he either moved opponents backward or sealed them off
on the plays I watched. It was nice to see.

I don't remember Lorenzo Neal's year with us in '97 so I don't remember
ever having a really effective blocking fullback since Smolinsky.

Anyone with a mind that works remember who I am forgetting?

Well I loved watching Freeman run. So maybe you have a point. His per
carry average was up those years. But he did pretty well in '84 and '85
too.

Hector was the Jets #2 tailback.  Not a full back although there were
times he and McNeil were on the field together.  Hector spelled Freeman
often and filled in for him quite well when #24 was hurt.  I always
enjoyed watching #34 play.  He could have been a starter in the NFL for
sure.
