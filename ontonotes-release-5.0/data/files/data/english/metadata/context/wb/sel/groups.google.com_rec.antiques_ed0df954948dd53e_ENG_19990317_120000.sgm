&quot;Unfortunately, Mike, many of the old British sports car lost their
character when they had to be &quot;federalized&quot; to met US car regulations.
The MGB is one such car that had its body line and styling completely
destroyed to meet the US import regulations. The TR is another one,
that god awful TR7 just destroyed a once beautiful car. Don't know if
in Canada, such regulations had the same disastrous consequence on the
British imported sports car.&quot;

Pardon a &quot;me too&quot; post, but the TR7 WAS some sort of crime against God.

The XK8 is a neat piece, and I drove one for a week last summer (the
manufacturers send me at least one new test car every week, even
though I've slacked off on reviewing them), but I don't know that I'd
buy one. In fact, I was in the XK8, just about to pull out of a
parking spot at the mall when a guy zipped into the slot next to me in
a Corvette, all excited. He wanted to look at my car. He said he was
thinking of trading his car for a Jag instead of a new Vette, but I
discouraged him. Nice as it is, the quarters are tight and it is not
as livable as a Corvette. Not to mention that the performance is
nowhere near that of the hot Chevy. One thing though, the quality has
improved hugely since Ford acquired Jaguar and gave the company access
to more suppliers and the economies of scale.

You guys have almost ruined my very good mood about buying my first
car. I mean I've owned other cars but never went to a dealer and BOUGHT
one before. So I did last week and it was fun and for the first time in my
more than 40 years I have a car that has every dial and button working.
Every one! This is big news for me, and I won't have you spoiling it by
showing off those space ships you are calling cars.
Now I have to hang my head and admit I bought a '94 Caravan. ( But
it's so good for hauling around stuff for the shop!!!)

Gotta agree. I drove the One-Lap-of-America race in the first of
Chrysler's popular minivans, a Plymouth Voyager, back in 1985. It was
quite an experience -- 11,000 miles in eight days -- and no matter how
my two compatriots and I thrashed that thing, it kept on truckin'.
Chrysler still has the bulk of the minivan market, too (something on
the order of 49 percent), and most of the other makers have yet to
catch up with the Voyager, Caravan and Town &amp; Country in terms of
features and livability.

One has, though, and I just got back from driving to and from an
auction in Pennsylvania in it today. It is the '99 Honda Odyssey --
just a great van! It is roomier and more powerful than most, and one
of its best features is that the seats fold flat into the floor. That
means you don't have to take them out and find someplace to store them
when you need to haul cargo. Great!

Incidentally, we didn't do well in that 1985 race around the perimeter
of the United States. We lost several hours when one of my co-drivers
put the Voyager into a ditch and we had to find a farmer with a
tractor to yank us out. Ah, well. We hadn't been in serious
contention anyway.

Now THAT is a long life (210K miles). I bought my last new car in '87,
put 130K miles on it, and hubby said it was time to let it go a few
weeks ago. Since I haul mostly smaller things, and can use a hitch and a
$10/day UHaul trailer for the occasional big things, I stick to
hatchbacks for the better mileage (mpg).

So, I traded in my poor old Energizer Bunny Escort for a '94 Dodge
Shadow ES. The Shadow doesn't look like a hatchback but it is, it's
metallic turquoise, and even has a cool spoiler on the rear. &lt;grin&gt; It's
not much of a speed demon for the rest of the world, but coming from a
1.9L with 130K on it, to a 2.5L with 44K (well, 45K now) on it, it's got
a lot of pep!

Have fun! Michele

I got my new -to-me Caravan when my Voyager finally got a fatal illness
(loose timing chain=$500 ) after we SWORE we wouldn't put another penny
into that car. We'd sworn that several times now :-). But I have to say
that since I only paid $200 for it 4 years ago it served well.
But I LIKE this new car stuff...I may have to start earning some real
money at this antique game so I can keep on making payments ;-).

I think I've got what you Merkins call a &quot;mini-van&quot;. It's a Peugeot 806,
a seven-seater people-carrier, it's what we call an MPV (Multi Purpose

it's a very respectable van.

"/> Seriously, they clip into special holes in the floor. Taking them out is
simply a questionsof:

1) tip seat-back forward
2) lift lever at back of rear legs
3) tip whole seat forward
4) grasp two bars between front legs and squeeze together
5) lift seat.

That's it!

&gt;buy it is if I could get it into my honkin' big van. So I asked for the tape
&gt;measure and went out and did some calculating. Yes, it would fit if I
&gt;could take out another seat.
&gt; A very nice man spent the good part of an hour trying to get that @#$&amp;&amp;*
&gt;seat out of my van. It did finally come out and the furniture did fit. And
&gt;I learned way more about that nice man than I ever needed to know. Boy, could
&gt;he talk.
&gt; BTW I don't think we have Peugeot min-vans here. Sounds very
&gt;exotic.
&gt;See ya! :-) Fayette

We don't have Peugeot anythings here, unfortunately. They pulled out
of the U.S. in 1992. Neat cars, even if (as I've said before) I
rolled one over a long time ago in a race in Ohio.

&gt;Tina, at the risk of remaining off-topic, I agree. In my
&gt;driveway sits a 1988 Dodge Caravan with 210,000 miles on it. I
&gt;don't think I have gotten all the goodie out of it yet!

It's funny the topic should be on mini-vans. Me and my hubby are putting
a new engine in our '89 voyager w/ 193,000. Body's great and yes it's
perfect for odd pieces of furniture!
