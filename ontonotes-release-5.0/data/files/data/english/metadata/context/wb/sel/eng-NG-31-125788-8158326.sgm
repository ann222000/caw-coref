Security and intelligence pracademic Paul Buchanan has been dismissed
from his senior lecturer role in the political studies department of
Auckland University.

Paul Buchanan is a regular commentator for Scoop Media on intelligence
and security matters and recently wrote the book: With Distance Comes
Perspective

Former graduate and post-graduate students have rallied to his
defence, stating the University has lost a gifted and honourable
lecturer.

Scoop understands the University of Auckland decided to dismiss Paul
Buchanan on Wednesday July 25 2007 citing a complaint made by a
student after failing to complete her assignment on time.

In an email in late May 2007, Paul Buchanan spoke bluntly to the
student of her very weak academic performance, lack of aptitude for
graduate study, and how he did not believe her excuse for not
delivering the final assignment on the due date.

Scoop understands the student was a United Arab Emirates national and
in New Zealand on a student education visa. Scoop also understands the
University of Auckland had received a degree of pressure from the
student's family's networks that warned: should the University not act
on the complaint then the UAE would send fewer students to New
Zealand.

Scoop sought and received a response from the University of Auckland.
It reads: Dr Paul Buchanan is no longer employed at The University of
Auckland. This is an employment matter and we have no further comment.

Former students of Paul Buchanan's have rallied to his support. Many
say the complaint was unjustified. One former student told Scoop Paul
Buchanan is the best lecturer one could have hoped for: &quot;He possesses
a high intellect, and has vast hands on experience.&quot;

Another former post-graduate student told Scoop: &quot;Having studied with
Dr. Paul Buchanan at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, I am
extremely surprised and disappointed to hear that he has been
summarily dismissed.

&quot;He has always been welcoming to students, ready to answer questions
in his own time and even to lend books from his personal collection.
Beyond regular teaching duties, Dr. Buchanan ran the Working Group on
Alternative Security Perspectives, which was a unique opportunity for
postgraduate students.

&quot;Given the investment he makes in his students, Dr. Buchanan also
expects a lot in return - rightly. Academic standards determine a
department's standings on an international level. While I'm not
familiar in any detail with the grounds for his dismissal, I am not
surprised to hear he was disappointed in a student for not taking
their studies as seriously as he does.

&quot;This is hardly a reason for such a dedicated and respected member of
the department to lose his job.

&quot;Because of bad staffing decisions, the department has already lost
some of its most popular and challenging papers in recent years,
notably including a study abroad programme at the Russian Diplomatic
Academy in Moscow that had been running for several years. I feel
sorry for current and future students of the Political Studies
Department. A few notable exceptions excluded, students are
increasingly limited to the fields of politics and the media, and
public policy. In firing Dr. Buchanan, they've made another big
mistake,&quot; the former post-graduate student said.

The day after the initial email was sent Paul Buchanan apologised for
any intemperate tone and offered to accept the assignment late. That
offer was initially accepted by the student. However, a few days later
a complaint was laid by the student through the International office.
The late assignment was accepted eight days late and she was awarded a
C- grade. Scoop understands the student failed to pass any of her
courses at the University of Auckland, nor did she present
documentation to support her claim that she had suffered a family
bereavement.

Scoop understands Paul Buchanan is taking an unjustified dismissal
case to the employment court with the counsel and support of his
union.

One email on poor performance by a student (even if heavy handed)
should not cause for dismissal for a tenured professor ...unless it
does actually say that he groped her, of which there is no evidence
that there is.

Changes introducing a &quot;competitive&quot; model in the 90's by National
(with little improvement by Labour) has brought a crisis in tertiary
education. Private providers (some of them quite dodgy) are siphoning
off government resources. Â Bulk funding is taking money away from some
deserving intuitions, while wildly irrational duplication in the field
is causing student numbers to drop across the board. For instance, I
hear that 3-5 degrees in Fines Arts have been replaced with over 20 in
the last 15 years (in a country smaller than the population of greater
Houston).

I hear from friends who are university lecturers that student s now
get away with murder since the administrations are so scared of
frightening away their &quot;clients&quot;.
This turn of events in NZ university level teaching has brought the
standards down across the board. I have heard of some lecturers who
have taught here and overseas in prestigious posts for over 20 years
without complaints, having to take government mandated teaching
courses while they also teach and do research. By all accounts thse
courses are a huge waste of time, taught by people with less
credential than those they teach, and cause of unbounded added stress.
&quot;Managers&quot; (often with little knowledge of the field of education)
sometimes act like Kafaquese paranoid tyrants under the stress of
National's failed &quot;competitive model&quot; and low student numbers.

It was just a throw away line ... meant to indicate that I don't take
this as seriously as you do.

I also don't understand why anyone is getting so upset over some
pompous academic who loses his job. Like the man said, it's an
employment matter - nothing particularly noteworthy about it.

Why should a professor's tenure be any more secure than anyone elses?
If he's really that good he'll have no trouble getting another
position, will he?
