307 suspension problems again - definitive list please
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

After suffering the rumbles, clonks, squeaks, etc from the undercarriage of
my 2002 307 1.6 Rapier 5 door, I'm going to mount an assault on all these
noises at the dealer since there's only a couple of months' warranty left.
Then I'm going to sell it as quickly as I can and buy a proper car.

This is made more urgent by the appearance of a new sound a couple of weeks
ago: a loud and unnerving 'crack', which seems to come from the rear, and
happens at odd times. I can't predict when it will happen or why. I wonder
sometimes if the suspension will simply fall apart into its various pieces
one day, and I almost wish it would.

I know we've had many suggestions on here before about this, but I'd like to
present the dealer with a *definitive* list of possibilities since they
probably won't have a clue what the problem is (they usually don't).

Can you help me with this list please? What are your experiences and
solutions? I've got:

1. A loud 'crack' from (I think) the rear, that sounds like something
snapping in half
2. A clonk from the front which happens when accelerating or decelerating
(engine mounts?)
3. A similar clonk but from the rear when turning left, especially on a
tight uphill corner
4. Constant rumbling/rattling from the rear suspension (especially in cold
weather)
5. Assorted clonks and crashes from just about everywhere (think ancient
Ford Transit full of rocks)

I'm assuming it's suspension/exhaust/drivetrain related since the dealer has
adjusted all the doors about twenty times. But I could be wrong.

Thanks.

I assume that as well as adjusting all the doors, he has lubricated
the seal. Peugeot have brought out a special grease in a tube that is
applied to the aperture seal and left to dry with the doors open. Then
a litlle dab on the catch or renew the catch with the 406 type, should
cure all door related noises.
Then it's a case of going round the suspension and tightening all
bolts. There was a problem with the upper mounting of the rear shock
absorber. Check the droplinks on the front, the lower arm mounting
bushes and the lower swivels for play. There is a modification to the
anti-roll bar mounting bushes and clamps.
And the lower engine mouting may need to be rotated within it's
housing.
All these things the dealer SHOULD know about!!

Hi I too have this problem with my 307 on a cold morning it clonks from the
O/S rear area. I have tried removing the spare wheel and jack also emptying
the boot space but nothing appears to be loose. Oddly when the day warms up
the noise disappears.
It also creaks and cracks on the front area. Please has any dealer or
mechanic had this on 307`s or able to throw some light on this hard to find
problem.

I to would not buy another model of this car having had several Peugeots
before this one although not having serious faults feels like a high milage
car at only 31000 mls with all the creaks and groans.

If you do get to the bottom of any of these please post here/email me.
My 307 is driving me mad, though not as mad as the dealers. Countless
problems and couldn't give a toss attitude.

I too have had enough - only a new house purchase is stopping me from
getting shot of it for once and for all!

How did you get on at the dealers? I had mine in again last week but no
luck. The usual 'we have never heard of any problems with noises from the
rear'
It also refused to play up on the test drive which didn't help matters.

Here's a weird thing. After rearranging everything in the boot, it no longer
makes the horrible cracking sound. I can barely believe that sound was
coming from something in the boot, but it looks like it may have been (how
embarrassing). With 14 days to go on the warranty, the 307 is (all of a
sudden) a paragon of quietness and docility. Perhaps it doesn't want to
leave us! It may have been stung by having to transport us to various other
car dealerships and seeing us drive away in shiny new Fords and Vauxhalls. I
also have a nasty feeling that the noises will return on March 1st when all
breakages have to be paid for.

I've tried emtying my boot, including the spare wheel etc and it still
makes the noise.
I know what you mean about it always going quiet whenever you go near a
dealers too - bloody annoying.
