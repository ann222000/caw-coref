So this morning I am walking to work, accompanied, as is usual in this country,
by several alarms blaring away. One particular scene that struck me, was in
front of a bank where the alarm was particularly loud and several people sitting
in front just chatting away having their morning coffee and a smoke like there
was nothing going on.
Could someone explain to me, what is the point of alarms (car or house) in
Ireland? And please do not tell me that it is theft deterrent, because that is
absolute rubbish!

the insurance companies clearly don't agree - they all give a discount
if you have an alarm.

I doubt that it's absolute rubbish.  If people are in the vicinity when
an alarm *starts*, chances are at least one of them will look to see
where it's coming from.  They may not be very likely to phone the police
unless they then see something suspicious (which is less likely if it's
a building that's being broken into), but that's still a risk that
'serious' burglars aren't likely to want to take.

I lived next to a solicitors a few years ago and was awake in the early
hours by the alarm next door. I called the police and they sent out a
officer. By the time he arrived it had stopped, as most alrms then would
only run for about 30mins to save annoyance. I went out and spoke to him
and he said 'well it aint going off now' well if you had arrived earlier
it would have been, was my reply!

He checked round the back and found no point of entry so left. I spoke
to the owners in the morning and they said it was a spider, (not me!)
crawling over the PIR! But I sympathise with the OP, we went to the
Mater today and passed an alram going off at about 9:30am, it was still
going at 12:45pm on our return!

We actually have an alram on our house, and get a reduction on the
premiums, but because of the house being haunted, (yes really!) we
disconected the battery and took out the fuse. So if you want a laptop,
E3.6K DJ machine, disco equipment, or widescreen plasma TV you know
where to come!

Well it must be a deterrent as well - I remember years ago in the UK having
an alarm on my car and a flashing red LED inside and getting back to my car
and seeing the police and someone had broke into a couple of cars nearby and
the police saying to me that they hadn't tried mine because they must have
seen the light and thought twice about breaking in so I was glad about that.

In the UK there were a lot of false alarms on buildings and I think the
Police had to powers to prosecute anyone with a re-occurring burglar alarms
going off and most probably ignored them as well most of the time!

I spoke to several colleagues at work about this. Not one of them has even heard
of anyone ever doing something about an alarm ... something like investigating,

Our local Community watch ... same thing.

Other than an insurance premium reduction scheme (scam?) and serious noise
pollution, not much else.

My brother years ago was assistant manager of a car parts place in the UK.
Only him and his boss had keys and the alarm went of one night at 4am and
the police called him and said your alarm is going off and we need you down
here so he drove down and went to give the keys to one of the officers
thinking they would go in first but instead told him that he would have to
go in first but 'they will be right behind him!' - so he could have gone in
first and got koshed over the head or stabbed or something . Anyway it
turned out to be a false alarm.

Some friends of ours moved into a brand new house and the develops said
something about the alarms not having a correct code or something so don't
turn them on just yet but of course it was too tempting to my mate who
decided to 'have a fiddle' at around 10pm at night - next minute alarms were
going off a siren in the box where you set the code and an alarm outside the
house and he could not silence them. I told him to pull the fuse out (there
was a fused spur box next to the alarm) the power light went out on the
alarm code box but still the alarms were going off. They must have their own
power I said so he had a key to open up the code box and I opened it up and
there was a 12v battery inside.

When I disconnect that I said the alarm should stop but all it did as turn
off the 'shrill' inside the alarm code box the alarm outside was still
sounding. There must be a battery up there in that alarm box I said and with
that I weren't going up on a ladder so he had to hone the alarm companies
number on the phone box and about an hour and a half later they finally came
out. Just before they turned it off you could hear that the battery on the
alarm must have been near to exhausting because the 2 tone alarm noise
started to sound sick! - from time to time the alarm did have a 30 second
'rest' and on its first rest we thought great it has disarmed itself .....
but then it would start up again!

In all that time of that alarm going off there were police driving around in
panda cars at other areas of the estate but no police called around to see
if it was a legit break in.

Needless to my mate didn't impress his new neighbors very much that night!
:-)

Most businesses have them and they are only useful if you have them
monitored. If you have too many false alarms then you get fined :(

In general police don't respond to alarms unless called out by an alarm
company and if they are busy they won't respond then either as a burglar
(if there ever was one) will be long gone by then!

&gt; I must be the best neighbour in the world then, 'cause I always go out
&gt; for a look-see if any of the neighbours alarms go off.

&gt; I know it's almost certainly a false alarm, but I'd feel awful if I
&gt; didn't bother my head going to look while someone ransacked a
&gt; neighbours house.

&gt; Equally, I'd be pretty fecked off if my house got burgled but nobody
&gt; bothered investigating the alarm.

&gt; On one occasion, the alarm next door went off, I took myself on an
&gt; investigative tour of the outside of the house, peering in the windows
&gt; for any signs of activity - only to see three fellas going through the
&gt; kitchen presses.

&gt; On another occasion, the other next door neighbours alarm went off in
&gt; the small hours while they were away on holiday.  Up out of bed,
&gt; looked around the outside of the house, no break-in.  Back home, back
&gt; to bed waiting for the 20-minute cut-out to kick in and silence the
&gt; bell.  Only it didn't.  It went on and on and on and on.

&gt; It wasn't too bad (for me), the double glazing did a great job of
&gt; keeping out the noise, but the alarm did manage to wake up most of the
&gt; street.  By 9am, I'd contacted the neighbours (who were in Spain - and
&gt; claimed not to have set the alarm because it didn't work properly -
&gt; grrr), called a locksmith (how much?!?!) and dealt with the alarm
&gt; myself with some, er... tools.  We won't be bothered by that alarm
&gt; going off again.  ;-)

&gt; I'll post on here if any houses come up for sale around me... &lt;g&gt;

Well done you have to be congratulated - in this day and age of things going
on and people ignoring it you actually decided to go out there and
investigate it for that I have to applaud you.

Its a shame we are in the age of  'oh not to worry if someone breaks in the
insurance will cover it'  - whereas we should not be relying on that and
instead get some more caring community society coming back to neighbourhoods
and everyone in the area helping out their neighbours where they can rather
than ignore things.

Yes, is a shame about the fact that these days you have a high chance you
could be stabbed / shot / killed if you tackle a burglar or some drug
dealers and take the law into your own hands that's why maybe a lot of
people wont get involved. There is an awful problem with people not wanting
to come forward as a witness in cases as well just in case something happens
to them. - but this just means that people are getting away with more these
days whereas maybe years ago they would have been tackled and arrested and
sent to jail.

well, in genuine cases I feel sorry for them then where an innocent person
gets wrongly accused then. But there are too many cases in the UK where real

&gt; &gt;And that's bollocks Andy!

&gt; &gt;There was at least one case where The Sun named and shamed people that
&gt; &gt;had done absoluelty nothing wrong and they were hounded out of their
&gt; &gt;home and towm by shithead mobs. Also I remember one case of a guy
&gt; &gt;signing the SO Register and a guy living nearby with the same name being
&gt; &gt;hounded in the same way for absolutely no reason. That's the problem
&gt; &gt;with mobs....no single responsible person so easy to get carried away!

&gt; number of mobsters.&quot; - Terry Pratchett

Or it may have been pediatrist, I forget which... he certainly wasn't a
paedophile, anyway.
