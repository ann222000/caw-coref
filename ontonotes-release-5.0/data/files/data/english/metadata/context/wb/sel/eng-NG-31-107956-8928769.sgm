I have argued for a long time against yo-yoing and finally, somebody
is stepping up to the plate.

Salmon fishermen, as well as halibut fishermen, often use a &quot;jigging&quot;
technique in this region. It sounds very much like the yo-yoing
described in the article, except they use artificial lures instead of
lead weighted bait fish. Are artificial lures that much less effective
for striped bass?

Striped bass respond to artificial lures, flies, live bait, chumming, et
cetera, just like most other other aggressive fish.

...or even just a fat clam on a hook. That's how my son caught his first
serious fish in Montauk when he was about 5. It was one big ass fish, and to
my son, it seemed even bigger when he shlepped it back to the car wrapped in
a towel, past all these big guys who saw the whole thing happen. It's
amazing how much a 5 year old can swagger at the appropriate time.

You get better action with a 5 to 7 inch spot hooked through the back
behind the dorsal fin. Stripped bass love spot.

Striped bass love everything.  They feast on the salmon smolts as they are
released.  I have caught stripers on chicken livers while cat fishing.  And
the striper had a couple of catfish in him.  Caught them on Clouser flys,
Bomber Long A's, Rebels, Hair Raiser jigs, and lots in the surf with a
Mickey Jig, which is just a flat tapered lead jig as well as large pencil
poppers.

Here in the fresh water impounds, they mostly follow the baitfish.
But, when you find the baitfish boiling, by watching the birds, and
get in the middle of a school of shiners, blueback herring, or shad,
just about anything you throw will produce a strike. I like using
white bucktail jigs.
