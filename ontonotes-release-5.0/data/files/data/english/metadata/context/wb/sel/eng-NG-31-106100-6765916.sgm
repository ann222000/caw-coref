Yesturday in the woods of Rehoboth I had:

3 Spring Azures

And an American Toad breeding festival !!! There must have been 50
pairs of them clasped together.  The female leads a string of eggs as
the male fertilizes them from above.  I had never seen them doing this
before!

Anyway, the presence of my dogs walking through the water didn't even
bother them!
