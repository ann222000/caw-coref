So everyone is talking about buying a sizzix since everything is on
sale and I have been doing some research to figure out what these
actually are. I was wondering if I could be pointed to someone's work
where they  have used this little machine.

I use my sizzix quite a bit. Some examples in my albums on webshots are:
http://community.webshots.com/user/slmcbeth

Make-n-take album
America - stars &amp; tag
Let it snow - snowflakes
trimmin the tree - light bulbs
April make-n-take - tabs on bottom of page
April swap page - little tags at bottom of LO

Raimbow swap album
Brown page kit - tag and sunflower (I used the sizzix to cut two
sunflowers for front and back, cut a piece of craft foam for inbetween, cut
out center of one sunflower and the foam, glued them together with a piece
of sheet protector to make a shadow box to put the beads in)

New Techniques Album
Denim Pocket - I love using the shadowbox alphabet set with and without
the background

I recently bought the Cricut machine and I will still keep my sizzix.
I love the sizzix machine.  But then again I don't think you could
ever have enough die cuts of anything.  LOL!

I almost forgot - I use my sizzix to smach bottle caps for LO's, too. I
think they are too bulky unless they are flattened - just my preference.

Thanks everyone! I love those dolls. I never knew you could do so much
with one machine. I think I am going to have to buy one and
experiment. It just opens up your possibilities. What does everyone
think about the smaller sidekick...I have very very limited space so
the smaller I can go the better.

I love my Sidekick, but you are limited to those dies that fit in it.
The neat thing is that includes some of the new Cuttlebug dies. But it
won't fix the larger Sizzix dies. I almost always take my sidekick to
crops with me, and in fact just bought a tote for it from Creative
Express. For $15, I couldn't pass it up!

I would recommend the Cuttlebug.  I've used it for all sorts of dies out
there, large (Revolution) and small Quickuts, BossKuts, Sisslets.  The only
ones I haven't used are the large Sizzix dies as I got rid of those, they
took up too much space!   It folds up nicely making it more compact to
store, it's really easy to figure out what to use with each type die and for
someone who really didn't like the zipe-mate and the sidekick, I really,
really like the Cuttlebug though I still love my bosskut too, I just had the
cuttlebug when I fell in love with the bigger dies.  Here is  a list I found
online of the dies you can use with the cuttlebug.  For the details, the
link is bellow. If you do a google search for cuttlebug you will see that it
is available for a reasonable price.

Cuttlebug Dies

Cuttlebug Embossing Folders

Big Impressions Texture Plates

BigShot Embossing Folders

BigShot Large Dies

Brass Embossing Stencils

Fiskars Texture Plates

QuicKuts Dies (Grand)

QuicKuts Dies (Regular)

Revolution Dies

Sizzix CutNFold Dies

Sizzix Embossing Folders

aka Simple Impressions

Sizzix Original Dies &amp; other Steel Rule Dies

Sizzlit Dies

Wizard Spellbinders Dies (to cut)

Wizard Spellbinders Dies (to emboss)

you won't be able to do dolls with the sidekick - they're from the
larger dies.

The doll dies come in two sizes, large and small. These dolls were made with
the large red dies. You need the regular sizzix or the Big Shot to use the
large dies. My preference is the Big Shot although have both.

I love my sidekick the best, I just bought a spare during the creative
express sale. I use it to cut not only my sizzilits but my zip'e cuts and
quickutzs dies as well. (you need to use an adaptor to cut zip'ecuts and
quickutzs with it).

Hi Scout Lady, I just have a question about the sidekick---and its
probably a silly questions----but, did you mean you have to use an
adaptor with the sidekick? I only have the 2 acrylic thingys for the
sidekick that &quot;sandwich&quot; the dies....is there something else?
Thanks! :)

It is a flat black piece the same size as a sizzilit die and you use it when
you cut with other dies like quickutz. Here is a link to it on sizzix.com
although they don't sell them anymore there. You can still get them in some
shops and ebay.
