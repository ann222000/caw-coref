Some readers will accuse me of hero worship by publishing excerpts from this article which appears today in Granma . Guilty as charged. Except for the "worship" part. But "immense admiration", that's a charge I'll cop to: "Some of those made-in-the-USA slanderous articles, the sort that circulate on newspaper stands around the world and describe it in their image and likeness, are once again attacking Fidel Castro by publishing fabulous figures related to his 'personal fortune,' given that they actually think they can keep fooling all of the people all of the time.

"Nevertheless, I would be so bold as to assure you that Fidel is truly the richest man in the world, although his riches cannot be measured in dollars, in annual income any other financial or stock indicator.

"Fidel's immeasurable fortune is rooted in knowing that he has always had the support of the immense majority of a people proud of having as president and head of state a man who has fought without rest or respite from his youth for the genuine social justice deserved by billions of this chaotic world's poorest people.

"His fortune, sir, consists of sleeping very little and dreaming a lot, and employing all of his inexhaustible energies, molded by his strength of courage and determination, to make all of those dreams come true, one after another.

"Yes, Fidel is the richest man on the planet because, in a small country, he has been able to achieve the reality that jobs, health, education, culture, sports and social security are the privileges of all Cubans, not just a few, and are not unattainable pipe dreams as they are in most countries that have not had to suffer constant threats and terrorist aggressions, nor the most prolonged, genocidal blockade ever known in history.

"If only, sir, all of the peoples of the world had - at least for one day in their bitter lives - a president like Fidel, who doesn't make promises, but keeps them; who doesn't offer, but gives; who doesn't torture or assassinate or disappear people, but saves them, helps them, cures them, protects them and defends them tooth and nail.

"Believe whatever you want, sir, but billions of people in every geographical latitude will pay no attention whatsoever to those rotten, slanderous libels, because they know very well that Fidel has lived for his people and for all of the peoples of the world, willing since day one to die for them and with them on the frontline of combat, and not hiding out in a bunker in the fashion of Hitler or Mr. W, because for many years now, with the great riches of his example, he has cast his lot with the poor of the Earth, and has demonstrated that he is - among other things - the president of all of the lowly, and that is an immense personal fortune indeed."

There are 10.5 million "illegal aliens" in the United States. 5 million of them are from Mexico. People risk their lives to leave poor countries to live in rich ones.

Hmmm...

My personal experiences in Cuba, with the Cuban people, are vastly different from this story.

Sr. Castro has, indeed, some wonderful ideas. However, they are not maturing into a cornucopia of a content and happy, peaceful, populace.

Not that I could see, anyway.

Then again I only spent 1.5 months in Cuba, traveling throughout and speaking with the locals. Maybe I missed something.

The question for us should be, are Cubans better off than the average person in places like Guatamala, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, etc--you know, places with comparable geopolitical and geographic prospects, places as far from God and near the United States as Cuba is. The Cubans, no matter how much progress they have made, they might still have grievances which would be perfectly legitimate. But before we go trying to dislodge Castro we should ask ourselves, what is the track record of such countries that do submit to our will--or help if you prefer to see it that way. That is, if any of our actions had anything to do with the welfare of the people down there and not exclusively the interests of our rulers.
