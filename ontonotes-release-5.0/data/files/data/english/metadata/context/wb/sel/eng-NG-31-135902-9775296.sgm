Rich,

I will do to create disk images on all deprotected copy for you.  Are
you willing to give $$$?  All disk images should not be on sale.

Many MECC titles have been done. Check in Asimov's
Unsorted folder to see if yours are among them.

Rich,

For those that are not already in Asimov, I'd be delighted to give
them a try...

Anyone who can deprotect these into image files, I'd LOVE copies.

I have some 60-70 MECC's that I don't know how to crack.

Oops! Sorry...

John, you know how to reach me ;-)

If some of you want to create NIB images of their MECC software,
please send them to me afterwards. I will then try to deprotect them,
ending in creating a MECChanical deprotection program...

&lt;Grin&gt; Yes Antoine, I know how to reach you.

My problem with these is they seem to have a nibble count built-in. Nothing I've found in Compute, Krakowitz, etc,
covers these ProDos versions of MECC, and the information given for the other versions doesn't seem to be enough for me
to do these.

Maybe I'll go thru, and send you some duplicates to work on, then you can send me a copy of your MECChanical program

John.

The usual method for dealing with nibble counts is to find the count
routine and disable it.  If that's all that's going on, that will
normalize the disk.

Publishers often used the same or very similar approaches to protection
on several different programs published around the same time, so the
work of deprotecting can often be pretty well leveraged.
