Australia has 1,500 troops in Iraq, but needs 5,000 police and troops to protect George Bush...from Australians. Even that's not enough. Evidently he needs the &amp;quot;law&amp;quot; as well :

Police launched a court battle Tuesday against a planned protest by up to 20,000 people, organized by the Stop Bush Coalition, saying it posed a serious threat in a city under an unprecedented security crackdown.

&amp;quot;Serious threat&amp;quot; of what? Letting public sentiment be on display, and possibly even glimpsed for 15 seconds on the evening news?

The serious threat is, of course, that George Bush might see them.

For those who are confused, Cookie Jill's comment refers to a comment I left on the Skippy blog, not to this post.

I think the should change the name to Stop bush Coalition. Using a capital B makes it a proper noun (if I remember correctly after all these years) and if there is anyone on the planet undeserving of the respect of a proper anything, it would be george.

As of August 31, 2007 the cost for security alone for the conference was estimated at $170,000,000. And details on the exceptional restrictions from The Australian:

Special laws have been passed granting beefed up powers to police to ensure the leaders are protected. Roads and train stations will be closed and a 2.8-metre fence will be built sealing off the Opera House, Government House, part of the Royal Botanical Gardens and city streets.
