Is anyone in this group interested in badgers?
I certainly am and I don't find the latest postings
amusing, just rather sad.

My local badgers are very active and are
busy digging out the damp soil from
a sett that was badly flooded a few weeks ago.
Tonight (Saturday) I watched two adults, a boar and sow,
together with four yearlings. I saw neither of the
breeding sows. Perhaps they are having their cubs
which are usually born early February.

A few years ago some of the badgers from the sett
excavated a new home on a nearby golf course.
They are now busily digging up the greens to the
annoyance of the golfers. Has anyone any experience
of keeping badgers from damaging a golf course?
I suspect that quite a few groups of badgers go
to forage there besides the resident badgers.

Yes Pam:

There are badger lovers who read this news group and
are equally appalled at all the rubbish being posted to
all of the ALT newsgroups. There used to be mostly
messages about badgers here (sigh).

I am in Canada, and here the badgers are larger
than in the UK and somewhat wilder and less
person friendy.

They live mostly in the western part of Canada
(eg Alberta) where they are not too popular with
ranchers who have a horse or cow step in a hole
and injure themselves.

I understand the golfers concerns about their course,
but then how would we feel if the Badgers bulldozed our
homes for a badger golf course ?

By the way, have you read the book &quot;Cold Moons&quot;?
It is a must for any badger lover.

Best Regards

We are more badger lovers out here. The Norwegian Badger is as far as
I know similar to the Honey-Badger.

In UK, I've been to a site (unfortunalety out of season) where they
arrange badger-spotting trips. I'll have to go back there som day
(New Lennark, Scotland)

By the way, Who can spot the two entries conserning badgers in the
Guinnes Book of Records for 1997?
