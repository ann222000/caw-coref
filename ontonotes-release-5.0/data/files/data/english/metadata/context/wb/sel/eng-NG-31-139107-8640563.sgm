3-day meat fast?

I've notice my appetite has been increasing. Even though I'm staying within
my carb limit, about 20~25/day, I'm making worse choices, such as too much
cheese, more mayo in the salad and so on. My weight seems to have crept-up
just a little over the past week, too. (Maybe meaningless, but could be an
indicator.)

I did a 2.5 day meat fast about a month ago. It greatly reduced my hunger
levels and really brought things into check. Am thinking it might be a good
idea. Am open to comments and/or other suggestions.

Thanks!

Increased appetite tends to be caused by higher glycemic foods
(you do mention worse choices) to trigger short insulin swings,
by specific intolerance foods to trigger addictive behavior patterns
(that can be subtle through obvious so maybe one of those worse
choices is a &quot;slippery slope food&quot; for you), or insufficient total
calories fat or protein.

Have you ever had dairy problems?  Colic as a baby if you have
older relatives who can remember?  At some point you will
eventually want to go a week or two dairy free then reintroduce
it.  If you free suddenly worse in some way, then dairy becomes
an intolerance suspect.  Otherwise one of your worse choices
is the suspect and the farther along the carb ladder it is the more
likely it is the cause.

But consider another possibility - Setting aside physical causes,
what's the chance it is psychological?  Old habits die hard.
Maybe your yearning for the fjords is really yearning for your
old food types expressing itself as vague appetite.  If so then
continuing as you have progressed without reaction is the way
to go.  That's my vote - That you're doing great and this is an old
habit fighting for control.

It won't hurt, but that's what the list of allowed foods for Induction
is supposed to do.

I'm a push-over for the Atkins &quot;Fat Fast.&quot;

Mayo shouldn't hurt, although you have to watch out for added sugar.
Sometimes it can be 1g/serving, which can add up when you're making
salads with it.  When you say &quot;about 20-25/day&quot;, how precise is that?
If that could be sneaking up over 30 or so, you could simply be eating
too many carbs.  Weight change over a single week is pretty
meaningless, though, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.

I don't know how far along you are; if you're just starting the plan
or have been on it a while.  At the beginning, if your appetite
increases, don't worry about it.  Eat when you're hungry until
satisfied, keep it safely low-carb, and give your body time to
adjust.  Appetite almost always retreats back to normal or less once
you settle into the plan, especially if you get plenty of fat.

Well, it's probably not necessary at this point, but it's not going to
hurt anything.  Maybe doing something different will be a mental boost
you need; who knows.

Heck, not even that new to the plan for some.  I've been low
carbing since 1999 and it still happens for me.  A day here
and there with much greater appetite than usual, a day here
and there where I eat a little at each meal and lose interest.
It doesn't happen as much but it still happens.

Times I've counted calories I've become convinced that with
calories what matters isn't the daily count but an average
across the last week or longer.

I have a problem with cheeses and stuff. Like 'em too much &amp; really have to
watch myself. This is something I'll really have to watch. As I've been
adding a few carbs and loosening up, I should be adding more veggies, not
sour cream and stuff like that. Thanks for the pointer. I don't know if
that's what you were getting at, but I think you may have hit the nail on

If you have a lot to lose and are at the start, the calories don't
count as much.
Doc Eades has a post about this on his blog from the past week.
www.proteinpower.com/drmike
I think that's the link to his blog. At any rate, if you are close to
goal, maybe
a few extra calories from mayo is your problem. But if you have weight
to lose,
I wouldn't worry about it. I'd focus on the carbs and, if you're doing
protein
power, getting adequate protein.

The idea is food intolerances can cause cravings.  In other words
eat an intolerance food and you become more hungry not less
hungry independent of its carb count.  If your problem with cheeses
is you overeat it's possible you're dairy intolerant.

Note that at one point before I low carbed I suspected I had a
problem with dairy.  I overeat too much of high dairy meals.  Turns
out I had ignored the fact they were always high wheat meals so
when I ate cheese on its own that didn't happen.

Atkins Induction is intended to clear out all of the most common
food intolerances, but it has two exceptions.  Enough people are
dairy or egg intolerant without knowing it.

You're still early in.  A couple of months in trying going dairy
free for a couple of weeks then add dairy back in.  Then you'll
find out if dairy is a problem for you.
