I attended a performance of &quot;Coriolanus&quot; last night, the third
production I've seen.

It was deadly serious.

Am I the only person who sees this play as a black comedy?

I know that it has very serious moments, but I think it should also be
very funny - along the lines of &quot;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf&quot; -
which should be hysterically funny.

Has anyone here seen a production of Coriolanus that emphasized the
humor?

I haven't seen it, but we read it here. We (including you) didn't
yuk it up too much. What is funny of course is
- strong mother (always a good character in comedies) named
Volumnia so she must be a loudmouth. Could make fun of the
similarity of all the women's names.
- adequate leader with weak communication skills (so
when he means well, somebody else always explains it for us--and him)
- constant rabble-rousing (the play often makes use of the
man on the street, the citizen, or the face in the crowd
which can of course be very funny if presented so)
- Coriolanus took over a town, Corioli, single-handedly, so that
could be great slapstick. Then they named him after it, well, in a way.

Other than that, please remind us of the jokes.
Biggus Dikkus it was not.

Maybe make it like a Batman (tv) episode
'True, Pow, Wow.&quot;

I think that - probably because Caius Marcius himself is so unlikeable -
Coriolanus is unjustly neglected as a play. In some ways I think it is the
most powerful of Shakespeare's tragedies - the inevitablilty of the tragedy
really does lie in CM's character flaws, and is perfectly visible from the
start, and the inexorable turning of the wheels is extremely moving to
watch. And of course, the moment of CM's defeat(/victory?) is achieved at
his only moment of self-knowledge, when he submits ot Volumnia's request not
to destroy Rome.
The verse and language are fantastic, and all the more so for being
uncompromising in the demand the writer makes for us to relate to such a
s.o.b..
I found it almost overwhelming to play the role - more so than Lear or
Othello - and had to really reach to make CMC human at times. At other
times he was all too human.

So, no, I don't think it's humorous, or a black comedy. Seeing someone laid
bare like that is rarely comic.

The first time I read Coriolanus, when I got to the part where
Coriolanus tries to rouse his troups and then leads a charge into the
city, but no one follows him and the doors of the city close behind
him - leaving him one soldier trapped in the city of his enemies, I
laughed out loud.

I think what I find so funny about the play is that so many characters
are so absolutely sure of their convictions and they couldn't be more
wrong.

The scenes where Coriolanus keeps assuring everyone that he is not
going to lose his temper - and then he immediately loses his temper,
usually get a few laughs, but I think there are more laughs in the
script.

I think Volumnia's talk about how much she loves to see her son
wounded could easily get some well deserved laughs, but hasn't in any
of the productions I've seen.

I wonder what would happen if Coriolanus were played a bit over the
top like the braggart warrior - the Miles Gloriosus of Plautus's plays
and &quot;A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to the Forum.&quot; In some
comedies the Miles Gloriosus character is outwardly a warrior but
really a coward - which certainly isn't true of Coriolanus - but the
man is so INSANELY pompous, I think that aspect could be the source of
humor.

Let me stress that I'm not saying the play is one of Shakespeare's
comedies. As I said in the original post, I think it's more of a
&quot;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf&quot; type play - horrible things happen,
but with a lot of humor.

I find it the most justly neglected of his tragedies, and the least

(The one that's unjustly neglected is Lear. Has it played on Broadway these

Everybody's scared of it.)

Coriolanus is the tragic hero who, in all of Shakespeare, least knows
himself.
He isn't even interested in whether he has flaws or not, being far too ready
to take &quot;the Roman character&quot; at fable's word, and far too ready to see the
flaws of everyone else.
He'd be a disaster as consul.
I barely drop a tear for him when he goes to his fate -- I'm perfectly

Thanks. I agree. It isn't supposed to be funny.
A friend of mine once played several parts in a Titus Andronicus which, he
assured me, was hilarious -- and the play is so bad, I'm sure it could be so
without damaging it.
But if you laugh at Coriolanus you're missing the point. On purpose,
perhaps, because the point of the play is so depressing.

I wonder if there's a trans-Atlantic divide on Lear? I'll be going to see

I'm sure you're right about this.
Well, it may not be a loss -- American actors usually speak Shakespeare so
badly.
I can easily imagine worse fates than to have to go to England every now and
then just to hear and see certain plays performed.
(We hardly get to see ANY non-Shakespearean plays of that era -- in thirty
years I have caught ONE Duchess of Malfi, ONE White Devil, ONE Tis Pity, and
only saw The Changeling and Women Beware Women because they were one-nights
when I was living in Seattle. And the Websters, come to think of it, were a
visiting Brit troupe. I'd really like to see some Marlowe on stage; a friend
told me he just saw a marvelous Edward II at the Globe this summer.)

But English actors who reached knighthood USED to hit New York to show what
they could do, in the good old days (when it wasn't so beastly expensive to
play Broadway).

And English and all sorts of other companies are always visiting and what do
they put on, again and again and again?
Measure for Measure and The Winter's Tale.
Now why have these become the FAVORITE plays of our generation?
I don't get it.

Scared? I doubt it. Within the past forty years (1963-2003) it's
played in Manhattan several times: Lee J. Cobb played Lear at the Vivian
Beaumont in 1968, James Earl Jones played Lear for the New York
Shakespeare Festival in 1974 (there's a DVD of that), Hal Holbrook
played Lear at the Roundabout in 1990, and there was a production as
recently as 1999, at the American Globe theater. Christopher Plummer
will be playing Lear at Lincoln Center next February, as well.

It's also a staple of regional Shakespeare festivals, of which there are
many -- the Oregon Shakespeare Festival (based in my current hometown of
Ashland, Oregon) is producing King Lear in 2004, as is the Seattle
Shakespeare Company. The Shakespeare Theater in Washington DC did a
production in 1999, the San Francisco Shakespeare Festival did one in
2001, and there are many, many others; Google turns up an embarrassment
of riches -- did you know that Avery Brooks will be playing Lear next
February at the Yale Repertory Theatre? Brooks vs. Plummer -- now
that's a match I'd hate to referee.

There's more humor in Shakespeare's darker moments than many people
realize. I can think of four lines with a sort of black humor to them:

1. Mercutio's &quot;grave&quot; pun in his dying moments in Romeo and Juliet.
(Shakespeare could never resist a pun.)
2. The Hecate scene in Macbeth. The &quot;bloody child&quot; shouts &quot;Macbeth!
Macbeth! Macbeth!&quot; and Macbeth responds that if he had three ears,
he'd hear it.
3. In Julius Cesear, Cinna the poet is killed &quot;for his bad verses&quot;.
4. At the end of King Lear, after the report of someone's death, the
immortal line &quot;That's but a trifle here&quot; is uttered.

In addition, in an essay, the poet John Berryman claimed he laughed
through parts of a 1937 Gielgud production of Richard II, so much so
that his companion threatened to leave if he didn't stop. Berryman
stated the reason for his laughing was that Gielgud found so much
humor in the part of Richard.

Of course it's a human quality. Just not a sympathetic one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;- I could go on. I think you

&gt; Maybe.
&gt; I still wouldn't call it a good play.

It's a very difficult play. Caius Martius is very foreign to modern
thinking - as I say, I fought it difficult to get inside his head. In other
plays, philosophies and actions we find improbable or unrealistic - such as
Olivia's acceptance of Sebastian and vice versa in Twelfth Night, or
Betram's conversion in All's Well - can be passed over or accepted because
they seem part of the logic of the play. It's a lot more difficult to skate
over Caius Martius' character because it is the focus of the play.

But it is a very powerful experience in the theatre.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He has loyalty,

&gt;&gt; (to what? not to Rome)

&gt; Yes he does. Until - as he sees it - he is betrayed by them. 'I banish
&gt; you' - he remains loyal to his idea of Rome, from which everyone else has
&gt; wavered.

"/>

Or he had a highly unrealistic idea of Rome to begin with (perhaps not
dissimilar to my pre-Bush idea of the benign and law-abiding United States,
but let that pass) and he expects everyone to play the game HIS way or he's
not playing at all. Which, to me, is not loyalty to Rome. Au contraire. He's
loyal to himself, perhaps, which is entertaining in a tragic character, and
then at the last he isn't even that -- which is what destroys him, and
that's tragic and logical even if it isn't even sad.

No, he is loyal to an aristocratic Rome and despises the rest of it. He is
ready to destroy it on a whim, like a disappointed cry-baby. Loyalty is NOT
one of his virtues. At all. We see his type again in 1790, in Artois and the
other emigres who wanted to invade Revolutionary France with German
armies -- hardly symbols of loyalty to anything but their own selfish
advantage.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I'm not sure you accomplished this successfully.

I'm perfectly willing that characters in works of art from older times be
true to themselves and not to our modern standards. I don't challenge, say,
Brutus, or even Corneille's Le Cid. (I do have problems with whatsisname's
Cato -- who wrote that? Pope?)

But Coriolanus's standards are not admirable to me, even by his own day.
He's a peevish goon. He doesn't make you admire his peevish goonery, as I DO
rather admire Lear's obstinacy, Macbeth's determined violence, Hamlet's
self-doubt (well, that's a modern quality if ever there was one, isn't it?),
Brutus's certainty that if he's suffering he must be doing the right thing,
Antony's grandeur-in-addiction, Othello's willingness to be corrupted,
Richard II's constant play-acting.
He doesn't question his motivations at any point in the play -- as the rest
of Shakespeare's great tragic heroes conspicuously do. Is that the flaw WS
was exploring here? &quot;Why am I acting like this?&quot; If so, I don't think he
thought it through or quite made a case for it. (Ditto, perhaps, Timon --
but there is no evidence that he finished or ever staged that play, and now
they are suggesting it was a collaboration.)

And because they're comedies, so the machinery is more important than
certain motivations. (Why does Olivia accepting Sebastian surprise you?
Because you never saw a Sebastian who looked remotely like the Viola? Yes,
but you have to accept -- I mean you have to -- that your eyes are wrong,
and he really does. Still, I prefer a more butch, less girlie Viola for that
very reason.) (And Bertram's conversion has struck people as a major flaw in
the play for 200 years and more. Louis Auchincloss has a wonderful chapter
on it in his book of essays on problem characters in Shakespeare: &quot;Because
he's SUPPOSED to be an adolescent twerp who grows up in the penultimate
instant, that's why,&quot; is, if memory serves, his argument.)

He reproaches Volumnia, not because he's not going to get to kill his family
or sack his home, but because this is the one moment of awareness for him -
he knows exactly what it will mean for him when he returns to the Volscians,
and is willing to undergo that to save those to whom his primary loyalty
lies- family and city.
