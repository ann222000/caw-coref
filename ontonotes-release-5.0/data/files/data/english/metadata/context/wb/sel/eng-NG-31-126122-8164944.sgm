&gt; You were born the same year you conquered Great Britain??? What a

Actually I was born afterwards.  The main invasion took place on September
28, and I wasn't born until October 23.  Now that's impressive!

Sounds like your parents used &quot;The Waltons&quot; as a marital aid.

I was born nine months and three days after my parents' wedding so
I've a pretty good idea where I was conceived.  I doubt if any tv
programme or piece of music had anything to do with it.  It would be
another three years and a bit before John and Paul met.
When I was 9 years old, I wrote to them and asked if I could join the
band when I was old enough.  I didn't get a reply :-(

If my dad had seen that first episode, there's a good chance I wouldn't be
here.  The whole John Boy thing creeped him out.

Based on my calculations, you haven't been born yet, but will arrive
