In the wake of last month's shooting of 17 civilians by Blackwater
gunmen in Baghdad, the Bush administration is finally acknowledging --
more than four years late -- that private security contractors in Iraq
should operate under the law.

Last week, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice admitted to Congress
that the State Department had inadequately supervised those
contractors. As Karen DeYoung wrote in Friday's Washington Post,
&quot;Pressed to express regret for what Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) called
&quot;the failures of your department, your failures,&quot; Rice said, &quot;I
certainly regret that we did not have the kind of oversight that I
would have insisted upon.&quot;

But did we really need an apparent massacre to point out this giant
loophole and its perils?

As it happens, President Bush has been aware of the hole for some time
-- and deserves some of the blame for not fixing it earlier.
Confronted about it in public more than a year ago, Bush literally
laughed off the question -- and then, tellingly, described his
response as a case study in how he does his job.

The setting was a question-and-answer session after Bush spoke at
Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies in
April of 2006. (Here's a video clip.)

One student, a first-year in South Asia studies, told the president:
&quot;My question is in regards to private military contractors. Uniform
Code of Military Justice does not apply to these contractors in Iraq.
I asked your Secretary of Defense a couple months ago what law governs
their actions.

Bush: &quot;I was going to ask him. Go ahead. (Laughter.) Help.
(Laughter.)&quot;

Student: &quot;I was hoping your answer might be a little more specific.
(Laughter.) Mr. Rumsfeld answered that Iraq has its own domestic laws
which he assumed applied to those private military contractors.
However, Iraq is clearly not currently capable of enforcing its laws,
much less against -- over our American military contractors. I would
submit to you that in this case, this is one case that privatization
is not a solution. And, Mr. President, how do you propose to bring
private military contractors under a system of law?&quot;

Bush: &quot;I appreciate that very much. I wasn't kidding -- (laughter.) I
was going to -- I pick up the phone and say, Mr. Secretary, I've got
an interesting question. (Laughter.) This is what delegation -- I
don't mean to be dodging the question, although it's kind of
convenient in this case, but never -- (laughter.) I really will -- I'm
going to call the Secretary and say you brought up a very valid
question, and what are we doing about it? That's how I work. I'm --
thanks. (Laughter.)&quot;

After nearly eight years in office, it's still scary to read actual,
not-cleaned-up-for-publication quotes from the mouth of this moron.
The stupid American press constantly cleans up what he says in print
as though he were a witless child. He isn't, he is a witless adult and
they ought not to coddle him just because he is an embarrassment.

It's as if a Live Late Night comedy skit was in play - and it's the
real thing.
The Republicans in this country love to use references to the
&quot;Founding Fathers&quot; in their speeches - What would the Founding Fathers
of this country think of this president?

Sometimes transcribed conversations can make a speaker appear less
lucid than they had in reality.

In this case, the reality is even more appalling than the black-and-

Compare him to any person in a position of leadership responsibility.
This is beyond dangerous and needs to stop, now.

Sigh. Goddamn Muffin fake decoder rings. Joe Torre now ex-manager of
the New York Yankees. A Tory was a supporter of the Brits during the
revolution. New York, was a noTorious hotbed of such.

As for the poor frog. &quot;Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog.
You understand it better, but the frog tends to die in the process.&quot;
Attributed to Twain, but also to others, with several variations.

He's like a REALLY BAD standup comedian on open-mike amateur night.
It was bad since day one, and has taken a dive to beyond absurd.
There is something seriously wrong with a &quot;man&quot; who can LAUGH in the
face of people discussing NEEDLESS DEATHS and ruined lives.  Or do his
handlers just plop him down in front of the Teletubbies on the TV and
tell him this is the latest video from EYE-rack?
