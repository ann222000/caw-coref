A Routine Pair Hand From OKBridge

Pairs is being on the look out at picking up garbage overtricks. Here
is a typical pair type situation.

I am playing OkBridge again after not playing for almost two years.
Not seeing any old partners, I end up in a table scored by match
points.
My partner has a 51% rating and we are playing two players with a 58%
rating.

As South, I held: S Q  H AQ54  D KQJ10  C Q973.
Since my diamonds were so much better than my clubs and since I needed
to prepare for a 1S response by bidding 2C, opening 1D was automatic.

The bidding continued:

West     North      East     South
--            --            --           1D
2D(1)    Dble       Pass      Pass
2H         3H          Pass      3NT
Pass      Pass        Pass

(1)     Majors

The opening lead was the S J

S AK97
H J2
D A542
C 1063

S Q
H AQ54
D KQJ10
C Q973

I won the the lead in my hand and I led a small heart from my hand to
dummy.
LHO thinks about this and generously wins with the heart king and
return a low heart, RHO following to both rounds of hearts.

Now I have ten tricks. Can I reward LHO for his generosity and win 11
tricks? Let's see.
I win two rounds of diamonds in my hand. LHO discards a heart on the
second round.
I play two winning hearts from my hand pitching two small clubs from
dummy.
RHO pitches a club and a spade.
Next I play two diamonds ending on dummy.
LHO pitches a spade, and a club.
I cash the spade ace to which both opponents follow and I pitch a club
from my hand.

S K9

C 10

S -

C Q97

Now I lead a club from dummy. RHO plays the jack and I cover with the
queen.
RHO wins with the club king and returns a low spade.
Naturally, I want to be made a true believer and payoff to LHO leading
the spade jack from jack empty fifth I hook the nine which wins.  LHO
immediately closes the table so his bad result does not count. Now I
remember why I don't play online bridge very often.

This hand was not a difficult one. At the end position, since you knew
LHO started with at least five spades and five hearts, LHO could hold
at most one club. So you have a free shot at making an 11th trick.

This is not true. There were changes...
Results from crashed tables usually count.
See &quot;Incomplete Boards policies&quot; (&quot;Pending boards&quot;).

This wouldn't happen on BBO since there are no ratings to protect.

Aren't you supposed to report table closings like this to OKb?  Or is it a
waste of time ?

A nicely played hand (and a crappily defended one, I might add).

However, I have an issue with the auction:

West     North      East     South
--            --            --           1D
2D(1)    Dble       Pass      Pass
2H         3H          Pass      3NT

The opening lead was the S J

S AK97
H J2
D A542
C 1063

S Q
H AQ54
D KQJ10
C Q973

It is my experience that when two suits have been bid/shown by the
opponents, a qbid shows the one stopped, not the one unstopped.  So in
an unfamiliar partnership, I would have expected North's second call
to be 2S, not 3H.

Perhaps your agreements were different.

Finally (not that it's a big deal), I would think that the seqence
1m-1S-1NT is a better description of your hand than 1D-1S-2C if that
was the sequence you were planning.

I can see opening 1D because the suit is stronger, but those of a pure
KS background would open 1C so as not to preempt us out of clubs when
partner has something like

Jxx
xxx
x
Axxxxx

or the like.

As a previous poster said, they automatically sign a score to a board
if the table crashes, you can appeal if you like, and then they might
reassign the score.

I was playing with an unknown partner.
On the previous board, he demonstrated in the bidding and play he was
not particularily strong.
I dislike rebidding 1NT with a singleton spade. Often partner
(Itabashi in particular) might bid 2S with five of them after a 1NT
rebid.

I liked the way you played the hand and opening a diamond.

The thing about BBO is that it takes quite a bit of effort
to find &quot;friends&quot; who are reliable partners. I find the
experts from Israel to be quite consistent. Another idea
would be to solicit for a partner on r.g.b, although likely
no partnership from r.g.b would rise to challenge Eric &amp; P.
r.g.b would no doubt be inundated by tales of woe. I like
playing imps because when you miss an overtick you can claim
you were taking a very safe line to just make the contract
and then obfuscate the issue after that. It is hard for pard
to win an argument because it requires so much typing. ;-)

Overtricks winning 1-2 imps can be important in short imp matches.
You really would prefer not being on the receiving end of a 1 or 2 imp
loss.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Now I lead a club from dummy. RHO plays the jack and I cover with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; queen.
&gt; &gt; &gt; RHO wins with the club king and returns a low spade.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Naturally, I want to be made a true believer and payoff to LHO leading
&gt; &gt; &gt; the spade jack from jack empty fifth I hook the nine which wins.  LHO
&gt; &gt; &gt; immediately closes the table so his bad result does not count. Now I
&gt; &gt; &gt; remember why I don't play online bridge very often.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This hand was not a difficult one. At the end position, since you knew
&gt; &gt; &gt; LHO started with at least five spades and five hearts, LHO could hold
&gt; &gt; &gt; at most one club. So you have a free shot at making an 11th trick.

&gt; &gt; A nicely played hand (and a crappily defended one, I might add).

&gt; &gt; However, I have an issue with the auction:

&gt; &gt; West     North      East     South
&gt; &gt; --            --            --           1D
&gt; &gt;  2D(1)    Dble       Pass      Pass
&gt; &gt;  2H         3H          Pass      3NT
&gt; &gt;  Pass      Pass        Pass

&gt; &gt; (1)     Majors

&gt; &gt; The opening lead was the S J

&gt; &gt; S AK97
&gt; &gt; H J2
&gt; &gt; D A542
&gt; &gt; C 1063

&gt; &gt; S Q
&gt; &gt; H AQ54
&gt; &gt; D KQJ10
&gt; &gt; C Q973

&gt; &gt; It is my experience that when two suits have been bid/shown by the
&gt; &gt; opponents, a qbid shows the one stopped, not the one unstopped.  So in
&gt; &gt; an unfamiliar partnership, I would have expected North's second call
&gt; &gt; to be 2S, not 3H.

&gt; &gt; Perhaps your agreements were different.

&gt; &gt; Finally (not that it's a big deal), I would think that the seqence
&gt; &gt; 1m-1S-1NT is a better description of your hand than 1D-1S-2C if that
&gt; &gt; was the sequence you were planning.

&gt; &gt; I can see opening 1D because the suit is stronger, but those of a pure
&gt; &gt; KS background would open 1C so as not to preempt us out of clubs when
&gt; &gt; partner has something like

&gt; &gt; Jxx
&gt; &gt; xxx
&gt; &gt; x
&gt; &gt; Axxxxx

&gt; &gt; or the like.

&gt; I was playing with an unknown partner.
&gt; On the previous board, he demonstrated in the bidding and play he was
&gt; not particularily strong.
&gt; I dislike rebidding 1NT with a singleton spade. Often partner
&gt; (Itabashi in particular) might bid 2S with five of them after a 1NT
&gt; rebid.

Fair enough.

Personally, I prefer a style where opener has to have a reason not to
raise the 1M response with 3, and so my 1NT rebids are much more old
fashioned Roth-Stone (minimum/misfit for respoonder).  I find that
this approach works quite well in slowing down misfit auctions.

After all, Al has to be right on something.
