I watched him exclusively on a couple of plays, and
noticed something odd. He would cover the TE for about
5 yards then he would disengage, look back at the QB
and patrol open space. His man, the TE would of course
be wide open. It seems like when they are in
full man-man coverage, he THINKS they are in some
kind of zone. He wasn't faked out of position, he just
let his man go to cover nobody! It is as though he
expects every play to be a run, and that TEs
running down the field are merely fake plays. The
coaching staff would have noticed all this. I just
don't know.

Certainly, Roy Williams didn't play well.
Ken Hamlin, he didn't play well either.
Jacques Reeves, he didn't play well. It
would appear that whatever the Cowboys
are doing, playing well on pass defense
just hasn't been in the cards most games
this season, with the one exception being
the play of Terence Newman.

Did well against the rush, though. Unfor-
tunately, this season, that isn't enough to
cut it regarding defeating the Packers and
Patriots. Pass defense, unless the Cow-
boys have some trick up their sleeve, it
does appear that that will be the Cow-
boys undoing *unless* they can win out
in scoring contests, resembling the way
they outscored the Giants in the opener.

Then again, the 'slow starts' problem on
offense returned in the Redskins game,
albeit the Cowboys' come-from-behind
ability prevailed for the umpteenth time
this season.

Still, that pass defense, problematic. I
wonder if anyone has a clue regarding
what the Cowboys can do to address
that issue, or if it's just something that
cannot be fixed until the off-season.

That's just a zone D. Not sure what you saw, I didn't see Williams
playing on a lot near the line of scrimmage yesterday. Are you sure
you're not thinking about Bradie James? I saw him do that a few times
yesterday.

I don't think it's in the game plan to leave Williams one on one on
with anybody but that's what happened a few times yesterday, and it
wasn't always because of effort on the part of the Washington coaches
to make it that way. On Campbell's first TD pass, to Cooley, James
covered him off the line for 6 or 8 yards, then just sat in the open
space in the defensive backfield. I don't know what the call was, but
seems to me he should have stayed with Cooley unless he was told to
spy on Campbell and release Cooley to one-on-one safety coverage. I
doubt that was the plan based on the reactions that I saw.

I saw Williams. It was when the TE released beyond the line. Williams
picked him up then released him. No one else picked him up (TE),
nor could they have picked him up. It was a bad technique. If it
were a zone he was the only playing it. Even in a zone you cover
a man within that zone. He released him IN THE ZONE.

Depending on the coverage, you may not be able to avoid it. The
Giants with Shockley exploited it. They forced the Cowboys to
use Williams to cover Shockley when they got into a spread. I
think some team was quoted as saying that their game plan against
the Cowboys was to &quot;find where Roy Williams is.&quot;

I admit, not ALL the breakdowns in coverage are due to Roy,
but it is not always someone else's man as he always seem to
suggest. It is no secret that he is poor in playing the ball.

Roy HAS no technique when it comes to pass coverage. He is a
tackler and that is ALL. In fact, he is so much of a tackler and so
much NOT a pass coverage guy, that he insists on TACKLING recievers
when the ball is thrown to them ,almost all the time, not even trying
to disrupt the pass from being caught.  Next time you see Roy getting
burned in the end zone  ( trust me, you'll see it more than once)
watch how he just wraps up the reciever instead of trying to disrupt
the pass. It's frighteningly stupid, the things he is doing. Roy
shouldn't be playing safety. He should be on special teams coverage or
they can beef him up some to make him a LB, but he might be too far
into his career to be doing that at t his stage and the Cowboys
probably don't need another LB anyway.

In zone coverage, you release when he leaves your zone. Only I don't

I'm pretty sure that the strategy vs. the Giants was to leave Williams
on Shockey and take away deep stuff to Toomer and Burress with double
coverage deep. I didn't think Williams had a bad game against the
Giants, he did a pretty good job of not letting Shockey get behind
him.
