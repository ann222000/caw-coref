NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Todd Marinovich, the former Los Angeles
Raiders quarterback whose career ended in a mire of drug abuse, is facing
a possible prison term after a weekend arrest in Orange County.

Marinovich, 38, remained jailed Wednesday on no-bail warrants for
probation violation pending a Sept. 6 pretrial hearing. Police said he was
skateboarding in a prohibited area near the Newport Pier boardwalk shortly
before 1:30 a.m. Sunday and ran away when officers tried to stop him. He
was found hiding in a carport about six blocks away.

Marinovich had a guitar case, and inside officers found about a gram of
powdered methamphetamine, a metal spoon and a hypodermic needle, Sgt. Evan
Sailor said.

Marinovich was arrested and pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to felony
possession of a controlled substance and misdemeanor counts of
unauthorized possession of a hypodermic and resisting a police officer.

A standout quarterback at Southern California in 1991, Marinovich was a
first-round draft choice of the then-Raiders, where he played two seasons
before being released because of an acknowledged drug problem. In eight
games, he had eight touchdowns and nine interceptions.

He later played in Canada and for the Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena
Football League, leaving that team in 2001 after being arrested on
suspicion of heroin possession.

In Orange County, Marinovich has had at least nine previous court cases,
most of them involving drug-related crimes, and has spent several months
in jail after pleading guilty or no contest to various crimes.

Ah, yes, the last quarterback we drafted is still haunting us.
This should help Jamarcus with his signing.  LOL

Sorry, thought that the whole first round thing would be
understood by a Raiders fan.  Shall I restate it or just
assume that you will wander to some search engine and verify
it for yourself?

Man, that's some sad shit right there.  The kid was GREAT college
QB/competitor and then he got addicted to drugs.  He could have been a
really special player for us.  I keep hoping that he'll get his life
together, but the likelihood of that is shrinking day by day.

Don't fool yourself ... K3. He was addicted to drugs throughout his college
career as well. Just goes to show that your fellow college/pro &quot;hypesters&quot;

He's actually a poster boy for the downside of pushing your kid too
hard too early.  Although he was an adult when he started getting in
trouble with the law, his Dad, Marv an ex-Raider O-lineman and USC
coach screwed him up early. He didn't raise him, he programed him. I
remember seeing a documentary on him when he was going to Capistrano
Valley High School.  I think they nick named him Robo-QB or something
like that.  His house wasn't a home it was a training facility with a
weight room and film room. He trained 365 days a year and  was robbed
of his childhood. By the time he was a senor in high school he was
already showing signs of peaking. He was totally burned out by the
time he finished college. Today, he's a mess.  Sad indeed.

Malice???  Never called for the public hanging of anyone actually.  I
actually support Russell's stance in contract negotiations.  I was
against Al drafting the kid with the first pick and I think he should
have traded up.  Al's stubbornness sort of confirms many of my reasons
for not drafting Russell.  That said, I want him in a Raider uniform
NOW.  Lastly, I know what we get with Culpepper.  He has some good
stats, but like Brooks, his head isn't always in the game.  He chokes
when a game gets tonight.  Definitely hasn't shown a propensity to
perform well under pressure and he's likely to not last a whole season.
That's not personal malice at all.   That's my analysis of what I've
seen of his play.  Funny thing is just about everyone was anti-Culpepper
until we signed him.  I don't change my mind about a player's abilities
just because he wears my team colors.  If Culpepper proves me wrong this
season, I'll be a happy man.  You've really got to learn to read dude.

BTW, I supported dumping Marinovich at the time.  Doesn't mean I don't
empathize with drug addiction and the lives it destroys.  Guess you've
never been a real friend to someone who's gone something like that.

Drug addiction doesn't necessarily solidify at a young age.  Your best
chance at fighting it is at that time.  It's gets much harder as you
age.  Sounds like his family was more interested in his career than the
kid's health and well-being, and that's a tragedy.  I'm not fooled by
anything here.  I've seen this shit up close and personal.

Exactly Rock. I remember seeing that documentary.  It seemed very
strange at the time.  Seems like the kid was artistic and sort of
thin-skinned too from what I remember.  Marv raised that boy selfishly
and unnecessarily so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Posted: August 29, 2007

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Todd Marinovich, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; former Los Angeles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Raiders quarterback whose career ended in a mire of drug
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abuse, is facing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a possible prison term after a weekend arrest in Orange
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; County.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marinovich, 38, remained jailed Wednesday on no-bail
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; warrants for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probation violation pending a Sept. 6 pretrial hearing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Police said he was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; skateboarding in a prohibited area near the Newport Pier
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; boardwalk shortly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before 1:30 a.m. Sunday and ran away when officers tried
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to stop him. He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was found hiding in a carport about six blocks away.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marinovich had a guitar case, and inside officers found
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about a gram of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; powdered methamphetamine, a metal spoon and a hypodermic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; needle, Sgt. Evan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sailor said.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=264609

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marinovich was arrested and pleaded not guilty on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tuesday to felony
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possession of a controlled substance and misdemeanor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; counts of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unauthorized possession of a hypodermic and resisting a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; police officer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A standout quarterback at Southern California in 1991,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marinovich was a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first-round draft choice of the then-Raiders, where he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; played two seasons
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before being released because of an acknowledged drug
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem. In eight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; games, he had eight touchdowns and nine interceptions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He later played in Canada and for the Los Angeles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Avengers of the Arena
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Football League, leaving that team in 2001 after being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arrested on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suspicion of heroin possession.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In Orange County, Marinovich has had at least nine
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; previous court cases,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most of them involving drug-related crimes, and has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spent several months
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in jail after pleading guilty or no contest to various
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; crimes.

Vick isn't a drug addict.  He's a dude that gambled (a clear violation
of NFL policy) and someone experienced joy from watching dogs ripping
each other apart and training them to do so.  I had these guys training
pitbulls to fight in the back yard adjacent to my own (these dogs barked
all day and night).  Had that shit taken down.  Fuck them.  They're
sick, self-serving, dumb ass fuckers.  People who actually enjoy

&gt;&gt; Don't fool yourself ... K3. He was addicted to drugs throughout his college
&gt;&gt; career as well. Just goes to show that your fellow college/pro &quot;hypesters&quot;
&gt;&gt; who blah blah in the news rags &amp; on TV aren't always right.

&gt; Drug addiction doesn't necessarily solidify at a young age.  Your best
&gt; chance at fighting it is at that time.  It's gets much harder as you
&gt; age.  Sounds like his family was more interested in his career than the
&gt; kid's health and well-being, and that's a tragedy.  I'm not fooled by
&gt; anything here.  I've seen this shit up close and personal.

The difference between the people you and I have dealt with (drug

&gt; Exactly Rock. I remember seeing that documentary.  It seemed very

&gt; and unnecessarily so.

I saw that as well &amp; picked up on the same things. I had some personal
experience being an &quot;artistic kid&quot;, thin-skinned &amp; also being almost 6 feet
tall @ age 12. In the minds of many I was destined to play basketball ...
Not to be a &quot;7-foot geetar player&quot; as my coach loathing referred to me as.

Hey, I doubt Marinovich has much money at this point, but I see your
point.  Hey, I'm not crying over the guy.  But I still think it's a sad
story and I think that his dad Marv never really gave two shits about
him.  All Marv wanted was a test tube kid who could achieve what Marv
never could.  That's some tragic shit and a lesson to some of these
asshole parents out there who train their kids to be robots all for
monetary gain and fame.

I have no problem with it at all.  Fighters have complete free will in
the process.  They can stop fighting at any time.  Plus, the
intention/goal is not to kill, as brutal and violent as the sport may
be.  But when you take the powerless, be it a human or an animal and
subject it to torture, that's some sick shit, period.  Like I said, it's
good for society to shun people who practice this shit and I don't
believe that boxing or even hunting compares to the dog fighting
business.  Though I do have a beef with hunting for mere sport, unless
there is a environmental reason for doing do and in that case, the name
of the game is to kill quickly and efficiently, not to torture.  FYI, I
myself can't stomach hunting.

You can point the finger at his dad for a lot of his problems. Marv was a
dedicated asshole control freak. He tried to make the perfect child and he
did the kid wrong big time growing up. Seems like he's never stopped

&gt; Why is there Nation wide comdemnation of the Black Michael Vick for
&gt; abusing animals, when the Raiders White Todd Marinovich is being
&gt; sentenced for the FIFTH time?

Because Marinovich never had anything close to the success that Vick has and
by extension, was a disappointment to fewer people. Besides, people
generally expect Raiders to be criminals...

Why the outrage? Someone who kills eight dogs should be fined and do
community service maybe even a light, short jail stay as punishment.
Why the endless blogs and internet posts and
every time you talk to a white guy on the street it's Michael Vick is
Charles Manson (who actually didn't kill anybody in real life
either.)

When I talk to my sports friends who I haven't seen for a month
because they were in Sweden, the first thing out of their mouths like
rage against Michael Vick. They're liberals and especially like
animals,
but Mumia Abu Jamal (the political prison) says it's out of
proportion
the hatred by whites on Vick because he's Black and from the ghetto
and he's been allowed into the elite world of the super rich.

I'm not a pacificist Avant Grape, I'm for revolution not peace and
quiet.

&gt; You can point the finger at his dad for a lot of his problems. Marv was a
&gt; dedicated asshole control freak. He tried to make the perfect child and he
&gt; did the kid wrong big time growing up. Seems like he's never stopped
&gt; rebelling.
">

Yes, you can point the finger, and rightly so.  But that will not solve
the problem.  The kid is no longer a kid.  And even though it's very
difficult to overcome that kind of parental programming, the fact remains
that as adults, we are responsible for our choices and their consequences.

&quot;We are responsible for our actions, no matter how we feel.&quot;  We've all
felt like that was unfair at times in our lives.  But it's reality.

This guy definitely got a raw deal in the &quot;molding the character and
personality&quot; department.  A lot of people did.  That's why there is help
is available to deal with those kinds of issues and the havoc they can
wreak in a person's life.  I hope he gets the help before it's too late.

Not to pick a fight, but hunting IS the best way to get a healthy bbq.
Freshly killed and properly prepared venison is difficult to beat. I'm
with you on this though: I'm not diggin' hunting for rack only. And
you're also right about an efficient kill--it pisses me off when hunters
squeeze off an off-balance hail mary shot, knowing the chances of
wounding rather than killing are extremely high. To me, the reason for
hunting is more for the food and the communion with nature than anything
else.

Of course, I say that and haven't been hunting in ten years...

Communion with nature?  This is my body, this is my blood?
Works for me.  We all eat.  Something dies so you can live.
Even the vegans kill animals during cultivation and
harvesting, not to mention by taking their habitat.  Just
because some people decieve themselves and pretend that they
are somehow above things because they do not hunt does not
mean their version of reality is anything like close to
correct.  If you eat meat you are in bed with the butcher.  I
know how my venison and beef are killed.  I know what
ingredients go into my sausage, and I have seen each of the
animals.  So let the pretenders continue to fund stockyards
where animals trudge through their offal and spread diseases
to each other.  Just laugh at their pretentions, and smile as
you think of them actually exposing themselves to nature.

Trophy hunters and assholes who go to &quot;game farms&quot; to shoot
tame or drugged animals in sloppy staged &quot;hunts&quot; deserve your
active hatred.

Yeah, but that's not huntin', it's pickin'. You'd be a fool to hunt it,
cause then you'd have to drag it's big dead ass off to be butchered. Why
