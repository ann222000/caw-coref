I have an MMA tournament coming up in two months time,  I am running
about 3km (1.5mile) up a pretty steep hill twice a week.. I have
noticed I can get a lot further before stopping each time but the
thing is I take the pace really easily and I am concerned its not
intense enough.. just playing a couple of minutes of soccer the other
night got me pretty puffed and breathing hard..

I know personal trainers will say sprint for a bit then light jog..
sprint for another bit then a light jog.. but I am looking for a more
realistic approach.. with that sort of method its too easy to cheat.

What sort of exercises work best? I want to really get the heart
working and fast (like the pace of an MMA would be).. shuttle runs
with tuck jumps at each end comes to mind

any suggestions?

Flamer.

There's some good workouts on here:

I've not been on there for a while, but I remember an excellent cardio
routine specifically for MMA training that was really good.  And F'ing

Google wind sprints.  They suck but get you really fit.  You also get the added
benefit of puking your ring gear out.

First off, try to increase the frequency of Your runs to at least 3 times
per week, 4-6 times a week if possible.

If You want to asses how well Your runs are training You, check Your heart
rate.  For improving stamina, You want Your heart rate somewhere between
70% and 95% of max (different sources give different ranges).  And be sure
to run down the hills too, to help reduce the risk of muscle imbalances.

Interval training is a great way to improve endurance.  Sprinting, full
out for 30 seconds then jogging for 2 or 3 minutes is one way to do it. It
may be easy to 'cheat' at that, but if You don't cheat it doesn't
matter.  Wind sprints are another option. Go to a local football field and
sprint from the goal line to the 40 or 50 yard line (or sideline to
sideline), pause for a minute or two (or maybe do a set of crunches, ...),
then sprint back. Do that 10 - 20 times.  Another option would be to
Sprint for one section (40-100 yards) of the track, and jog the rest for
several laps.  Look up High Intensity Interval training, or just Interval
Training. There are many ways to do it, and it works really well.

For something a little more MMA specific, Try ending Your sessions by
sparring for 2-3 times as many rounds as the competition will be.  Try to
switch out sparring partners every 3-5 rounds.  If You or Your partner tap
out, don't stop.  Just get up and finish the round.  Maybe make the rounds
a minute or more longer than the competition rounds.  Keep the rest time
between rounds equal to or slightly shorter than it will be in
competition.  Not everyone has the resources to do that, but if You do,
the endurance aspect of the actual competition will seem like a cakewalk.

...much good advice snipped...

Yes, those are excellent ways to train for martial arts *competition.*
Moreover, there will be significant health benefits from following such a
regimen.

But if you want to train for real *fighting* then a more specific regimen
would be better.  Because most real fights are under 30 seconds (often
way under) the most specific training is anaerobic burst training at
maximum intensity.  I would suggest that a cardiovascular training regime
comparable to that of a 200 m quasi-sprinter is best (although a case
could even be made for training like a 100 m sprinter).

Real fights are under 30 seconds and you should plan for a much higher
&quot;burn rate&quot; than those who plan on going 5, 15, 25 or 36 minutes in a
ring/octagon. Even one 3-minute round is an eternity compared to most
street fights.  The ability to instantly go from stopped to full-on 100%
effort is vital in real fights where surprise attacks, etc. may be
factors. Sprinting helps develop this.

Regards,

PS   The &quot;burst&quot; nature of real fights is one reason why fat old men can
still often do very well in them.  If you're still capable of sprinting
hard for a block to catch a bus, you have what you need cardiovascularly
in most real fights.

PPS  Most martial artists don't give 100% from the outset.  No, they pace
themselves as if they had to last several rounds.  This is folly in a
real fight where an instant switch to total effort at maximum intensity
wins the day. (Unless the opponent is completely outclassed, of course,
in which case any level of fitness or unfitness may get you through.)

Thanks for the replies everyone, its been a lot of help. I am going to
try some wind sprints on a flat surface. I certainly do have the
resources for continuous sparring 2-3 times a week, I should have also
pointed out that i was going to be increasing the exercise as the time
draws closer and I am expecting to be doing runs/sprints 5 times a
week after another month.

Just a side note, with jogging in general and with wind sprints should
i be breathing in and out through the mouth, or in through the nose? I
have found it almost impossible to control my breathing through the
nose and out through the mouth when running.. but some people say to
do it one way others say to do it the other.

It's because guys in the in the ring are trained to handle the
blitzkrieg assault, whereas the common man is not.

Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that the intense training
suggestions as oultined previously are inferior to handling the
blitzkrieg scnenario than those who train in the manner you describe.

Only partly.  There are many differences between the ring/octagon and the
street which militate against the blitz attack in the one environment but
favour it in the other:

1.  Ring fighters know *exactly when* the fight will start (either a bell
or &quot;let's get it on&quot;&quot; ).
2.  Ring fighters start from way out of distance (typically 15-20 feet)
rather than from an &quot;in your face&quot; confrontation or a surprise close-
range ambush, requiring &quot;instant on&quot; response.
3.  Ring fighters know there won't be any other combatants coming into
play and don't have to get rid of the man in front of them in a hurry,
just in case. (Similarly re weapons.)
4.  Ring fighters don't have to finish the fight quickly before cops,
etc. get involved.
5.  Ring fighters have a number of &quot;winning&quot; strategies that are only
possible in artificial circumstances, such as winning on &quot;points&quot; or
&quot;rounds.&quot;  They would be fools to give up the chance of using such
strategies in the ring, but in the street such strategies are worse than
useless.
6.  Ring fighters know that their opponent is *also* ring savvy and will
have adjusted his tactics for the best chance of winning in the ring
rather than using street tactics, so an all-out blitz attack from him is
unlikely.

There is abundant evidence that almost all real street fights last less
than 30 seconds.  And is it *axiomatic* that a serious fighter should
train for the circumstances he *actually expects to encounter.*  That
means &quot;sprint&quot; training for the street, and endurance training for the
ring.

Regards,

PS  But it is obvious that it is not a complete either/or situation.  It
is instead a matter of emphasis. For instance, serious sprint training
will require as well as tend to preserve/develop a cardio endurance base.
(Not to the same extent as an athlete who concentrates on endurance, mind
you, but to a considerable degree.)

Anyone can sprint for 30 seconds.  So, the training would inherently
have to be more psychological than physical.

Also, one would expect a ring-trained fighter to have far, far better
attributes such as VO2 max, due to ring training.  They're going to be
blitzer.

Essentially, if one expects to need only to go 30 seconds, they should
powerlift.  There is no point in conditioning at all.  Size and
strength become the most important factors when emptyhanded.

The point you miss, which is unsurprising, is that combat sports are
not about endurance as much as they are about recovery.  They, too,
put 30 second bursts in, and must recover therefrom in order to
continue.  This is not a lollygag ride on a bike or a 10k jog.  MMA is
not an endurance event.

That said, the training methods for recovery would be the same for
ring fighters as they would be for those looking to last 30
seconds...or as for cyclists.

A good analogy is that a ringfight is like a Tour stage in the Alps
and a schmoe fight is like a stage in the flats.  At any time, a
furious break may emerge that may have to be countered.  The biggest
difference is the baseline pace before the attack.  Ringfighters would
have to be trained to handle the significantly higher baseline effort
rate of the ongoing fight and still be able to handle and launch a
blitz, whereas civilian fights should look more like riding down the
road and then launching.  Either way, the training for the blitz
portion of such things is the same.

No, anaerobic training is quite a different thing from aerobic training.
And VO2max is not a particularly good index of burst capacity.  The
VO2max of *world-class* 100m sprinters is actually not that impressive
(Cooper remarks on how *bad* some world class sprinters were).

I would expect that, if we're talking of young men undergoing hard
martial arts training of *any* kind there would be considerable
crossover capabilites.  The sprinter lad would have a decent level of
cardio endurance, and the endurance guy would have decent sprint
capacity.  Either could make a respectable (but not optimal) performance
in the other's venue.

But to give my example of how even fat, unfit fighters (think Tank
Abbott) are fucking dangerous, in the early UFCs we saw a number of
&quot;hard men&quot; who despite mediocre cardio conditioning could fight pretty
damned well for the first round before they gassed.  It took a long time
before *any* of the fighters, even the lean and fit ones, adapted to the
*artificial situation* of fighting three 5-minute rounds (or more)
without gassing.

And, on the anaerobic front, I still frequnetly see octagon fighters who
are gassed (and arm weary) if they try a blitz but don't finish the
other guy (e.g., a flurry if they have mount).  I think that, while
their sustained cardio is now excellent, they are still short-changing
themselves in burst capacity by not doing anaerobic training (and muscle
burst training too, but that's another topic).

Yes!  And that's why the Tank Abbotts of this world, while now a few
notches down in the octagon, would be my *preferred* backup in the
street.  Down a dark alley late at night I'll take Tank, thanks :-)

It's also why I, an old fart who doesn't train cardio as much as I
should any more, am still a very dangerous guy in the street in real
fights (up to 30 seconds).  (My knife and Glock help too :-)

Combat *sports* may be about recovery but in the street there's seldom a
second chance and recovery is a non-issue.  (Even in combat sports
recovery is more about sustaining  intense training than about actual
ring performance)  No, combat, whether sport or street, is about
&quot;spending it all&quot; in the appropriate timeframe.  In the octagaon the
appropriate timeframe is 15 minutes - in the streets it's 30 seconds.

MMA IS an endurance event! Three (or five) 5-minute rounds sure as hell
is.  A large percentage of fights go the distance and are called on
points.

*Some* MMA athletes may do *some* burst training (good for them) but the
fact remains that, for the street, burst is the *overwhelmingly
dominant* requirement.  Cardio is for running away :-)

A reasonable POV.

If you have time to train for both endurance and sprint, life is great.
Those who have less than 6 hours a day, who aren't 'roiders, and whose
focus is self-defence rather than competition would do well to
concentrate on anaerobic performance (and muscular power).

I do not question the reported duration of street fights. I question
the training method of going balls out for only 30 seconds and then
calling it quits. Perhaps it would be more realistic to train for to
simulate a 30 second blitzkrieg followed by a 100 meter run to your
car as you make your getaway.

I still maintain that the serious intense aerobic conditioning that I
have witnessed/experienced in VT/BJJ schools (Hamburger drills,
suicide drills etc) more than adequately prepares someone for that 30
second blitzkrieg.

I did NOT call for training for only 30 seconds and then going home -
that's nonsense  That isn't *how* I recommended folks train for the
street (In fact, I said virtually nothing about training *methods* but
rather about training *objectives*).  The objective of serious training
for the street should be maximal effort in a 30-second burst.  But the
training methods for achieving such burst capabilities takes a lot more
time and effort than 30 seconds!

Sprinters train for explosive performance too.  But they don't do one 100
m training run and then &quot;call it quits&quot; for the day.  No, they train very
rigorously for extended periods.  However, the *focus* of their training,
their *objective,* is gaining the capacity for maximal effort in a short
burst.

So, I'm NOT calling for training only 30 seconds - that's nonsense.  No,
I'm calling for training FOR performing for 30 seconds at maximal
intensity.

More than adequately?  I doubt it.  I ask you to reflect on the mantra
that virtually everyone here on rma accepts: How you train determines how
you perform.  If you expect to fight for 30 seconds at maximal intensity
(i.e., in a street situation) then that's what you should train for.

And everyone knows training is *specific* especially if high levels of
performance (i.e., more than adequate) are desired.   A man who trains
for a marathon can probably sprint better than most ordinary folks, but a
real sprinter will blow the doors off him.  So too with martial arts.

You're wrong, of course.

Interval training is how you get better at blitzes.  That is what
gives you better anaerobic capacity.

The drills he's speaking of are not about endurance, they are about
recovery.  Training recovery is ABOUT blitzing, then recovering, then
reblitzing.  The whole blitzing thing in there, you have to do
repeatedly, and to do that you have to recover.  There's no way around
it.  So, stop being an ass and saying that ring training for repeated
blitzes is bad for someone who needs only one blitz.  The training HAS
to be the same; there's no other way to do it.

No, Trav, strength and power are NOT the same and the training methods

considerably.  Just as the methods for achieving maximum anaerobic
cardio differ considerably from the methods for long-term endurance
cardio.

That, of course, has been the key point of my posts from the outset.
Training for maximal burst performance (i.,e., for the street) requires
different methods than for much longer duration MA sports contests.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Quite right.  And now we see yet another difference confirming my key
point that *how* you train should depend on *what* you're training for.
Training for maximal performance on the street requires different
methods than training for a MA contest.  And MA training to achieve
maximal health benefits may require differnt training methods than
*either* of those (e.g., no plyometrics, no 'roids).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Bodybuilding, for example, is the best bet.  Yes, you will not be as

">

The point can be stated even more strongly (alhough I'm opening myself
up to all kinds of specious nonsense from you and others once I make the
following *illustrative points* - which are NOT recommendations).

Mass, just plain old body weight, helps enormously in the street.  While
it is far better if that mass is muscle, even quanities of blubber can
be, on balance, more helpful than hurtful.  Blubber gives weight, and
weight matters in the street.  As long as that blubber is layered over a
strong muscular core (and that's critical) then the blubber helps more
than it hurts.

Besides giving extra mass, blubber also acts as &quot;gel armour&quot; to cushion
blows.  And as long as the blubber doesn't slow you down (i.e.,
underlying strength is high) it doesn't much matter that the blubber
will make you gas much earlier - because gassing isn't an issue in short
&quot;burst&quot; street fights!  That's why, for instance, fellows like Tank
Abbott, despite the blubber, are not handicapped in short burst fighting
(although it kills them in a long MA contest).

I'm delighted you've finally seen the light.  You now agree that, for the
street, one should train to achive maximal burst performance over a short
duration.  And that such training differs considerably from training for
a MA contest.

And so with your agreement with *what* a person should train for for the
street (maximum burst performance) we move on to *how* a person should
train for the objective of maximum burst performance.

There are a number of techniques for training for maximum street burst
capacity.  Interval training is only ONE of them.

But, yes, interval training, could have a role in training for such a
&quot;maximal burst capacity&quot; objective.  But there are MANY variants of
interval training and the exact regimen would have to be tailored for the
objective.

For instance, recovery is NOT itself a primary goal of interval training
for the street per se.  No, it is instead only a secondary requirement,
not for application during the end performance, but to allow the person
to train the repetitions of the &quot;burst&quot; part of the interval training
with greater intensity and frequency.

How long is your fight? I worked with a boxer who, if his bouts were
six rounds or fewer would train very hard but not over a half hour at
a time over the last month. For MMA type fighting I'd recommend
pushing up the intensity and pushing down the time. Same with your
running. If your major fight training is going well then you can do
the unfortunately named fartlek training. The word is Swedish for
&quot;speed play&quot; and involves surges of various lengths and intensities
and recoveries of various lengths however you want. However I'd say as
the fight gets closer then make the recoveries shorter. Do that twice
a week and if you have weight issues run longish and slowish two other
days.. But from two months out your main training ought to be fight
training. A good drill for me was always to do three minute rounds
against partners who rotated every minute. I learned that in high
school wrestling and it worked for savate and kickboxing as well.
Good luck.

Hi.

I was always on the receiving end, and its been a couple of years, and
the memory was seared from my mind :)

But it basically consisted of various exercises performed, ultra-high
intensity, in a certain sequence, for the fastest time you can. Done
with a team that is cheering you on, yelling at you, can provide an
intense experience. Time's ranged from 3 minutes to 1 minute, 45
seconds (or so)

Done on a field of 50 yards, it is the equivalent of wind sprints with
craziness thrown in. Wheelbarrows, bear walking, crab walking, jumping
jacks, pushups, hindu squats, grape-vines etc. All as fast as you can.

I saw a guy get the best time, throw up, and then get back in line for
his next turn. Intense.

You guys can argue about what I mean, but there's no evidence that a

No, it doesn't differ at all, which you'd know if you knew a fucking

But size still matters, even if it's blubber.

Where I uses to train MDK, there was a black
belt, around 35 years old, who had gotten
obese.  He was 5'10&quot;, and like 240, but his
natural weight was around 200.  I think he
just couldn't say no to beer and nachos.

So his stamina was crap, but in sparring,
he was a grizzly.  He could cover that one
step distance quick, much quicker than
you'd expect, and the extra weight was all
behind his strikes, his technique hadn't
deteriorated.  I learned not to laugh at fat guys,

God, how you wiggle and squirm!  And yet you still cannot distance yourself
from your lies and stupidities.

You said there were NO other training methods for burst besides interval
training.  I corrected your error by listing two others: power lifting and
plyometrics.

You were wrong!  It's just that simple even though you're not man enough to
admit it.

Goddammit, Trav, you're a shameless lying whore!   More lawyerly weaseling,

backpedal - that's all you ever do!  In fact, backpedalling is your main
exercise and training method!

For a layperon, you fucking idiot, there are no distinctions of any kind in
martial arts training and the whole discussion, just like you, becomes
pointless.

No, fuckhead, strength is not power and power is not strength.

It's in print, you fucking liar! Do you think you can get away with
denying what you said only a few posts ago?

I said:

&quot;There are a number of techniques for training for maximum street burst
capacity.  Interval training is only ONE of them.&quot;

To which you, Trav the liar, responded in the next post:

&quot;Interval training is the only one that is practicable.&quot;

You said ONLY ONE, you fucking lying weaselly lawyer!  Goddammit, you're
a deceitful weasel!

Uhm Nemo. I've seen this happen before in old folks who want to deny
their *further* deteriorating eyesight... Upgrade your prescription,
and read it again.

You fucking scumbag.  For the purposes of THIS DISCUSSION, strength =
power.

There is no effective difference for the PERSON INVOLVED IN TRAINING
FOR THE BLITZ.

You are worthless.  Just totally worthless.  I wonder why I even

Why don't you try re-reading that?  Get back to me.

I'm not even going to belabor the point because you have already
embarrassed yourself far beyond my copious ability to do so.

I wonder about that too.  Especially since all you do is repeat bullshit
like regime = state, power = strength, and Iranian = Arab.

There is nothing a bullshitter and liar like you shrinks from denying.
After all, you're a weaselly lawyer, and lying is your stock in trade.

But the fact remains, that strength is not power, regime is not state, and
Iranian is not Arab.

And the fact also remains that there are MULTIPLE ways to train for optimal
street performance, including interval training, power lifting, and
plyometrics.
