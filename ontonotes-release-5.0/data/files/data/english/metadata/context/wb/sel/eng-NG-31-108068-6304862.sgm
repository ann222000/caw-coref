I have observed that there is a wide selection of gun enthusiasts both
lurking and participating here.   Some are quite knowledgeable, some not.

What I wonder, though, is whether anyone in firearms manufacturing reads our
posts?    I'd like to think that the major manufacturers would skim through
our posts to get an idea of what shooters actually think.

Think this happens?    Are any of you out there directly or indirectly
connected with the decision makers of the major manufacturers?

Just curious.

Ralph

In all seriousness, I'd expect that there are gunmaker reps reading the
group. However, I'd also expect that, due to patent, copyright, trade
secret, and similar issues they are expressly forbidden by their
companies to comment on, confirm, deny, etc, etc, etc, anything that
goes on in the group, particularly if such commentary might be construed
to be "official policy" of the company. Basically, it's a serious case
of "cover yer ass" going on due to today's sue-happy society.

Authors with fan-groups often have similar restrictions in place -
Several authors have dedicated newsgroups that, due to legal issues,
they either cannot read at all, or if they do read, must "pretend they
don't", in order to avoid, for instance, the risk of being sued for
plagiarism if an idea they read on the group (and perhaps even
legitimately forgot that they read there) shows up in a future work.
Others blow off such concepts, and participate in the groups that
revolve around their works.

I can assure you that at one time several years ago Colt read this ng
in the late 90's when the boycott was in the works after their
president went on record on CBS television in favor of licensing gun
owners. Myself and others that posted here regarding the boycott
received email from the then president.

For one the owner of Fulton Armory http://www.fulton-armory.com Clint
McKee was an active participant in this group and wish he still was.
Generally in today's manufacturing world I believe companies are going
to build what they want and mostly what's cost efficient and don't
hold too much stock in what we think or want. Besides keep in mind how
many firearm N/Gs besides rec.guns are on the net pertaining to every
type of weapon conceivable, it would be imposable to check them all
everyday, not (cost efficient) though I wouldn't mind having that
job.  (sorry if this was posted twice, seems the net is still asleep)

Many years back, I had bought a Charles Daly .45 ACP in the Commander
frame, which I really had a great time with. Expressed this on this
new group, where they were being discussed. Got a nice call from their
office/importer in Harrisburg, and a nice cap, patches, etc. in the
mail in a couple of days. They DO read the group, but keep a low
profile, as the other posters point out. Our voices ARE heard, for
good or bad, I would say.

Probably not. You'd be surprised how many net users have no idea what
newsgroups are and would be totally dumbfounded in trying to access them.
Most of the folks active in the newsgroups were Unix users back in the '90s
when Usenet was "in style" and know how resourceful this part of the
internet is. That's maybe 1 or 2 percent of all current net users... at
best.

Usenet is kinda like IRC... unless you can point and click at something on a
website, most common users want nothing to do with it.

There is no doubt in my mind that this newsgroup is monitored by major
gun manufacturers. Information is power, and there is a lot of
information to be gathered here. What works, what doesn't work. What do
consumers want? How are we perceived by serious shooting enthusiasts,
etc.

Not to mention that this newsgroup has the notoriety of being top notch
and well respected. Kudos to you, Mr. Moderator.

I concur.

I talk about usenet at work and get blank stares from most people.
I'll talk to them about it, then introduce them via googlegroups.

My sister taught me about it. I've only been here tho' since 1996.

We can learn...... &lt;G&gt;

You gotta figure that all gun groups are monitored by our folks in
Washington.  Both for threat analysis and opinion analysis.

Threat analysis by at least one government agency, probably more.  More than
one illegal gun owner has been brought down by their bragging on the
internet.

Opinion analysis by anyone who wants to know what gun owners think.
Senators, Congressmen, (more likely their aids.)  Political analysts,
marketing people -the list goes on and on.

This is one reason to keep talking about it.  If a bunch of hardcore
shooters (like ourselves) are seen stewing because of HR10/22 and we're mad
as hell and won't take it anymore.  This will show the politicians that
there could be a price for a wrong vote on HR 1022.

Further legal analysis of HR 1022 has revealed a provision to ban 1911 s and
all clones.  It will also get rid of  the M-9, Berreta 92/96 and all guns
based on the M-9 design.

All high capacity (10+) magazines are, of course, banned.

Any weapon with a military background could be banned under HR 1022.

It also looks like Ruger 10/22 may be on the chopping block.

Check it out for yourself:
http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-1022

This is not hyped or spun, this is just the truth and nothing else.

They probably look at the numbers of participants involved too.  This
is still the best group on Usenet, thanks to the fine moderators, but
those of you who have been around for years will recall 10 years ago
there would be hundreds of new posts every day.  Just so many other
forums good forums out there now to attract people's interest.  Most
of those are more oriented to one's geographic area and thus often it
is easier to find specific local info than the global groups.

Gee whizz. Well I'm in Australia where everything is banned.   I love
Armalite, Bushmaster and so on AR- type flat tops, and Springfield and
Kimber 1911 clones. Manufacturers, send me some freebies......

No, and I double wanted that gig:
1) I was coming out of the dot-com-bust in the Seattle area when no one
called me.
2) It was gun related, and all the interviewers were gun nuts. They said
you could track American G.I.s in Iraq by the trail of AA batteries on
the ground, from the gun sights.

But the economy came back, and I got a job next door, working on a small
jet engine's starter-generator electronics and power distribution. Two
and a half years later, I am still getting a few hours a week out of
that deal.

When I walk to the Subway sandwich shop from the aircraft place, I have
to walk past the gun sight place. I have never been back in the
building, but a dumpster scrounging friend found some of the gun sight
gear in a scrap  yard, and he has been doing experiments with it.
