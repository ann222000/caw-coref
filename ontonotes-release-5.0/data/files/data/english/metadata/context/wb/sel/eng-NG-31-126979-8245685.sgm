I take a look at AAPLS and hope to find that Arny has stopped winding Phildo
up.

Will try again in a few months.

Really wish one of you would just stop replying to the other's posts...
Don't really care to much which one but in general Phildo is more useful
than Arny.

The Google groups archive shows that well over 90 % of you posts relate to

Have any professional connection with PA systems and the relevant technology

The problem is Phildo that you are hard-pressed to find any actual evidence
of incompence in my current posting to rant about. This is proven by the
fact that all the stuff you are ranting and raving about today comes from
the archives.

Unlike you  Phildo I can admit to the mistakes I've made. If I wanted to
look into the archives I can find plenty of yours to rant and rave about,
mistakes that you forcefully deny to this day.

The only reason there's a problem is because you goad him. If you weren't so
determined to make a meal ( a banquet even) of his occasional errors there would
be no need for this thread.

In the meantime YOU PHILDO ought to shut the fuck up about stuff YOU don't
understand like the hardware.

I think you have made his incompetence ABUNDANTLY clear, but there will
always be an Arny (or insert troll name here) problem.  You might want to do
some research on compulsive disorders.  You seem to have been at sea too
long, and I think maybe you are in looooovvvve with Arny!  How many times a
day do you think of Arny, and how many times a day do you think of women?
It might be time for a new hobby.

So, let me get this straight.  You have his pastor's real email address, and
you've been contacting him about Arny's behaviour and how you dissapprove of
it.

Sounds like couple counseling is in order.  Maybe while your working
privately with the Pastor, you can get him to make Arny put his underwear
away, too.

As I said, if everybody pulled Arny up on his crap and told him he was wrong
then he would get the message. As it is he thinks I argue with him just
because I want to and that he is right about audio matters. If you let his
comments such as &quot;95% of mixing desks do not have PFL metering&quot; or &quot;FOH is
backstage&quot; slide past then he believes they are right. The more people that
tell him he is wrong without having any personal history with him, the more
he might actually believe he is wrong. If you want this to stop then instead
of complaining, tell Arny he is wrong when he makes mistakes instead off
leaving it up to those of us who do care that he is spewing crap on to our
newsgroup.

I think you are wrong, I think he`d  just argue with everyone. Don`t you

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pretty well sums things up!

&gt;&gt; good xtian to get Arny the help he so desperately needs. Phildo

One  sign that someone is losing it is that they go around calling other

Jesus Phil (no pun intended).

If that was all you were doing that would be fine. If he (or me or anyone
else) makes a mistake then feel free to call him on it. But it seems like
you've hijacked almost every thread to cut Arny in some way or another
whether he's even posted in it or not (usually not). It's very tiresome. How
about giving it a rest for a while.

You're obviously very knowledgeable and you sometimes make valuable
contributions. I just wish you could get over your personal vendetta.

Oh, and before you start Arny (and Dobony and Eeyore): shut up!!! You're
just as bad.

This group has gone to hell in a handbasket.

Unfortunately that would involve descending to Phildo's level. Phildo
basically admitted defeat and exposed his cowardice when he attempted to
take this matter out into the real world. Knowing that there's someone else
posting here that would go that low would be a lot to bear.

You are quite right.

I would never report this to his employers - he would certainly be
fired, or at least listed as &quot;Not Required Back&quot; after his next leave.
But if he carries on antagonising so many people on Usenet, sooner or
later somebody is sure to do it.

Sad really. After years of trying and failing to become a proper Band
Engineer, he has finally found a nice little niche where he can be
successful, albeit as a big fish in a small pond. But he has such a
self-destructive personality, he's looking to mess it all up. Again.

n.p.

Ah, I was wondering when my own personal little net-stalker would show his
ugly face. Still doesn't have the balls to use his real name. I wonder huw
he could be ???

Of course his spending literally weeks trolling through google at my posts
is hardly the act of a sane mind. Hypocrite? I think so.

Sadly Arnold it was your won behaviour that led to people (not just myself)
having to take things into the &quot;real world&quot;. You brought it on yourself.

The other person who was disturbed enough to take it to the real world was
Robert Morien - a well known net stalker who needed the Supreme Court of the
US to straighten him out about his school report card. You're in good
company!
