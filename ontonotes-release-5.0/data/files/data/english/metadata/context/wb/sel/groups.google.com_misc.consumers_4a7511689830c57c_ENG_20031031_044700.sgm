I haven't seen this posted yet but how do you feel about the banks changing the
way that they are going to handle paper checks? Apparently you won't get your
actual cancelled checks back - you'll get something like a photocopy.

I guess I just must be a creature of habit. I like having the actual cancelled
checks for my records.

&quot;The banks&quot; don't have a common policy on this, and &quot;the banks&quot;

On the other hand, many banks have been doing this for some time
now. It's a growing trend that has slowly gained acceptance from
most consumers. If you don't like it, call around and find a bank
that still returns your actual checks. (My bank does, but I'm not
going to give it free publicity because I'm planning to leave it for
other reasons.)

What has changed is that the receiving bank no longer needs to send the physical

check.

"/> I read about this in the paper a week or so ago when Pres Bush signed
it into law. Don't know when the law takes effect - probably the first
of the year. What it means is that when you pay a bill by check like
mailing your credit card payment from where ever to NY say, the NY bank
that receives the check as a deposit, can scan the check and then
electronically transmit it to the clearing house and on to the your bank
- the check never leaves the NY bank. At the present time the actual
check must be sent to a clearing house, sorted, usually sent to a
regional distribution point and eventually back to your bank, even if
your bank does not return the check to you - all of this physical paper
moving costs mucho money. The banks have been after this for years
because it will save them millions.

BTW I still receive cancelled checks from _my_ bank, but not for long I
guess.

The sentence I find interesting in the AP article is:

``Banks, customers and businesses that still want paper checks could request a
substitute check, which has the same legal status as a regular one, to confirm
the electronic transfer.''

I may well be reading more into this than I should (and I admit that I've
been too lazy to read the actual legislation yet) but the implication is that
if you do not request (and receive) this substitute check then you do not have
anything with the same legal status as a canceled check. Going further out on
a limb, I'll bet that while this legislation allows the banks to substitute an
electronic transaction record/scan for a physical check, it grants no such
general right to consumers. (After all, consumers couldn't be trusted not to
fiddle with the bits, and it's too much bother to make them secure.) I further
assume that these substitute checks are not going to come free if you want them
on a regular basis, even if providing them would still cost less than the banks
are saving by not moving the original paper around. So my cynical take on the
change is that it is a way to shift some of the banks' business costs to the
customer in the name of overall efficiency.

Now, if the legislation provides for cryptographically signed images to be
delivered to the customer in digital form and further gives those images the
same legal status as physical checks by requiring that they be accepted as
proof of transaction (i.e., if the legislation does something to reduce the
_consumer's_ costs and/or increase the _consumer's_ convenience) I'll be happy
to withdraw my cynical comments. :)

I don't think it's about missing the physical checks per se--at least that's
not my objection. I'm all in favor of reducing clutter. The problem is that
we are seeing a paradigm shift being justified by a move to more efficient
electronic processing even though the latter really does not require the former.
This has been going on for quite a while, with the latest legislation merely
moving things along a bit faster.

The real problem is: who holds the burden-shifting token? Traditionally in
interactions between individual consumers and business or government, the
consumer's word doesn't count for much. If there is a dispute about a payment
the business or government is generally presumed to be correct (or at least
presumes itself correct) and the burden is on the consumer to show some proof.
Display of a canceled check by the consumer not only shifts the burden of proof
but also raises the bar considerably since the disputing party has to start
thinking in terms of fraud or forgery rather than asserting an oversight on the
part of the consumer. This in turn can encourage a more comprehensive search
of records (and file cabinet draws :) since it is no longer just a matter of
the consumer's word.

The move to electronic processing changes the nature of the token from a
piece of paper to some sort of electronically imaged document. I don't see
anything wrong with that in and of itself. But at the same time we are being
told that we will no longer receive the token by default. We have to ask the
bank to create the token when we need it. There may be a cost associated with
such creation. The damages we can receive if the bank is unable to create the
token (say, for the addition I made to my house 30 years ago and now need to
show the IRS on audit of the sale) are likely very limited. Obviously I'm
supposed to request tokens immediately for transactions that might later be
of importance, but this certainly doesn't simplify my life. And I'll bet that
the fee will be set high enough to discourage my simply requesting tokens for
every transaction.

The notion of not providing the token by default (and potentially being able
to charge for it on demand) is being conflated with the move to electronic
processing in general. In reality it is just an additional cost savings for
the bank, plus a new revenue stream for issuing the tokens. If the electronic
form of the transaction is in fact secure (e.g., cryptographically signed image)
then the bank should deliver that by default and the law should give it status
equivalent to a canceled check. In other words, the electronic transaction
record should *be* the token. I'd be very happy to store my tokens on (backed
up) disk rather than in a file cabinet full of paper. If (as I suspect) the
electronic transactions are not &quot;self proving&quot; but instead rely on the bank's
trustworthyness when creating the token on demand then the bank should create
the tokens (&quot;substitute checks&quot;) every month and send them with the statement
just as they now send the canceled checks. Any other approach is just a sneaky
way to *further* increase savings/enhance profits beyond the (presumably) huge
windfall of not having to move the original paper around.

off. Getting that loan payoff statement took over a year. Luckily
this was not my house I was trying to sell.)

Oh, yes, I've also needed information from a check from 40 years
ago (and 10 years before I was born!) for income taxes. Do you pay
child support? You probably need to keep proof of that AT LEAST 7
years after both your ex-wife AND the child are dead (if you were
imprisoned for involvement in either death, the 7 years starts after
you have served your sentence).

Do you own real estate, stocks, bonds, or other investments? You
probably need proof of what you paid for them AT LEAST 7 years after
you sell. (And if you traded stocks for other stocks, as in stock
split or spinoff or inheritance or whatever, that's NOT a sale, and
the 7 years doesn't start running until you sell what you got in
trade.).

"/> IRS Publication 17 says that you have to keep tax records for as
long as necessary to support a tax return until the period of
limitations runs out. This period runs out after 3 years unless
an item of income you didn't report is more than 25% of the income
shown on the return, in which case it's 6 years after you filed the
return.

6 years after you filed the return corresponds roughly to 7 years
after you sell (and, presumably, report a gain or loss on your tax
return). You can never be sure that the IRS won't claim that the
correct amount is more than 25% of the income shown on the return.

If there is fraud then the statute of limitations doesn't run. You can
never be sure that the IRS won't suggest fraud (and there doesn't seem to
be any penalty for the IRS if they fail to find it) so I like to keep my
records forever. :) (N.B. I don't pretend to understand who has the burden
of proof if the IRS proposes that, e.g., a large expense from 10 years ago
was really a fraudulent fabrication. But I'm happier to be able to pull out
the canceled check than not...) There is also the case where the IRS claims
that the return was never filed (or at least never received). This means that
the statute never started to run, at least as far as the IRS is concerned.

At the moment, the entire paper records for every tax return, canceled
check, credit card bill, invoice, bank/brokerage statement, etc. that I've
ever received take up about four file cabinet draws. While I don't consider
this a serious burden, I'd be happy to switch to electronic storage on a few
DVDs as soon as the electronic form that I can hold and present (without the
involvement of a third-party acting as oracle) has the same legal status as
the paper version.

&gt; Most news sites should have the story.
&gt; The bottom line is your bank won't receive your canceled check, so
&gt; it's not going to be possible for them to return it to you.

"/> Yes, it's going that way.. but the phrase
&quot;President Bush last week signed into law the Check 21 bill, which allows
banks to substitute electronic check images for paper checks for the
clearance and settlement process.&quot;
doesn't give me warm &amp; fuzzies

what about for 'dispute process'
what about for 'tax write offs'
