Spotted a claim of sorts that the use of corn syrup as a cheap (cheaper
than real sugar &amp; banned from use in Mexico) sweetner in so many
US products causes or leads to several problems.

A) The body does not count it as sugar (hunger sense in the brain).
B) It can lead to or promoote kidney failure.

Then there's the popcorn problem.

And Rumsfeld (again).
Seems he was CEO of G.D. Searle &amp; selling Aspartame
as an artificial sweetner.
The FDA was about to ban it ...  but Rumsfeld used his
clout with the repubs to block that.
After all, it only leads to ~400 extra deaths per year ...

http://www.rense.com/general33/legal.htm
[
...
The FDA had actually banned aspartame based on this finding, only to have Searle
Chairman Donald Rumsfeld (currently the Secretary of Defense) vow to &quot;call in
his markers,&quot; to get it approved.

On January 21, 1981, the day after Ronald Reagan's inauguration, Searle
re-applied to the FDA for approval to use aspartame in food sweetener, and
Reagan's new FDA commissioner, Arthur Hayes Hull, Jr., appointed a 5-person
Scientific Commission to review the board of inquiry's decision.

It soon became clear that the panel would uphold the ban by a 3-2 decision, but
Hull then installed a sixth member on the commission, and the vote became
deadlocked. He then personally broke the tie in aspartame's favor. Hull later
left the FDA under allegations of impropriety ..

My sense is this:
(A) is likely correct, altho you can argue this for regular sugar in
solution as well.  Ie, soders, juices, etc. all have &quot;insensible&quot; calories,
to some extent.
(B) could be correct, but it has also been demonstrated that very high
fructose dosages damage the liver in animals.
Most nutritionists would say (were saying) that the amount of fructose in
high-fructose corn syrup is nowhere near this amount, but others would
disagree, at least claiming altered liver function, if not outright damage.

Fructose IS, in fact, metabolized differently than all the other natural
sugars, obligatorily in the liver.
Note, however ordinary table/cane sugar (sucrose), is a di-saccharide
consisting of glucose-fructose, and that fructose is found &quot;free&quot; in fruits.

Aspartame:

There is as much bullshit and skullduggery in health, nutrition, and science
as there is in 9/11 and Iraq.
The aspartame story IS an outrage.
Even if there were no allegations against it, I wouldn't touch it, because
1. it's making a bunch of assholes super-rich and
2.  it's a *fundamentally unnecessary product*, simply capitalizing, so to
speak, on our collective inability to exercise discipline.  Or exercise,
period.

And, it takes a very sophisticated knowledge of nutrition and
biochem/physiology, and epidemiology (as a last resort) to ferret this stuff
out.

Aspartame does, with biochemical irrefutability, have toxic
by-products--methanol and/or formic acid--and the real Q is,  Is enough
produced to cause harm??
Most nutritionists say no.  ADA, donchaknow......

Lots of anecdotal stuff is saying yes.  And the FDA was saying that whatever
their perception of the problem, they didn't like it!
Aspartame is actually pseudo-protein, a modified tri-peptide, which one
would think would be harmless, but its metabolism does in fact produce the
above products.
Hey, think prions.   :)

My advice is, avoid ALL dat shit like the plague.
None of it will kill you immediately, but put ALL the assaults together, and
it becomes like smoking cigarettes--you diminish your odds of healthy
survival, even tho some people can get away with it.

And some people DO have *acute* reactions to MSG, excess fructose,
aspartame, etc.

A lot of this is Darwin at work:
Those who can ferret out the bullshit will survive, in better health and
greater lucidity.
Those who cain't live without McDs and Red Bull will, iffin they do like
Morgan Spurlock (Supersize Me), just keel over and/or bloat.
BUT, go right back to McD's as soon as they get up!!

IOW, the Stupid/Propagandically Challenged will die younger, fatter, and
broke-er.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

What is the popcorn problem?

Overall, an excellent post.
Once again demonstrating how Congress/people in power, are fucking you and
your children in the ass until your retinas are shaken loose.
Ergo, we cain't read the fine print anymore.

Hey, wait a minute. How about us type 1 diabetics? d8-)

I'm not talking type 2. I'm almost skinny. But aspartame has been a great
thing.

Other artificial sweeteners are OK, too.

&quot;Corn syrup&quot; will give you 201 hits on PubMed (peer-reviewed medical journal
articles). The consensus seems to be no detectable metabolic differences
between corn syrup and other common sources of dietary sugar.

However, I am not a medical professional. I just re-write and edit them. And
if that doesn't scare you, nothing will. d8-)

Well, notice the artful &quot;hedging&quot; in pretty much everything I said.  :)  :)

Yeah, I'm not sure why Mexico is anti-corn syrup.
Also, there's all kinds of high-fructose corn syrup, some much higher than
others, depending on the processes used.

I think more of the problem with HFCS is its effects on appetite regulation,
as alluded to in the original post.  It may correlate with induced cravings,
poor appetite control.

Aspartame et al would *appear* to be useful to diabetics, in much the same
way these fukn Scooters would appear to &quot;assist&quot; in the mobility of our
aging population.
When in reality these scooters are a death sentence for most seniors.

The *real* solution for diabetes, short of full-blown medical intervention
(hey, some people actually do need those scooters!) is
1.  Boucou g-d Exercise, jack, much more than namby-pamby walking.
2.  An Atkins-type diet--which is actually the ADA-prescribed diet for
diabetics--high fat, high protein, low carb--the only case where it is
justified, btw.  And of course, complex carbs, no simple carbs/sugars.
3.  **Small** frequent meals.  Absolutely essential.
4.  As many of these meals *after* bouts of exercise, with some exercise
after the meal, as well.  goodgawd....

Tough life, eh??
But actually, a good prescription for non-diabetics, as well, as this serves
superbly in general weight loss/maintenance strategyies--except for the
Atkins part.

Iffin you cain't curb yer sweet tooth, well, then say hello to Darwin.
And, if you must have a sweet, fatty sweets are preferable to any other
kind, as fats slow overall absorption.  eg, ice cream.

That's the real pill diabetics have to swallow, so to speak.  Extra
discipline.
Not fun, but it's reality.
Exercise is also *critical* for diabetics at risk for the various
neuropathies/amputations.
Consider exercise to be a drug.

Also, the reality for Seniors and these g-d scooters is, well, boucou
exercise, especially kneebends, perhaps assisted in some way.
Anything else is simply irresponsible.

Oh, now we have Requip for Restless Leg Syndrome.
It's not enough that these BigPharm muthafuckas pump us with drugs for shit
we already got, but now they actually INVENT fukn syndromes, so they can
pump us with more shit.
I'll  S bd's D in Times Square if you can show me ANYONE who jogs a mere 3
mi week with RLS--if it even exists at all.

Aha. So you do know the difference. Sorry, then, for the repitition.

Early mortality? Maybe. Not as bad as it used to be. My son became diabetic
at age 3. He's 19 now and healthy as a horse. It helps that he's a serious
athlete. I have my fingers crossed for him.

As for me, I'm taking bets on whether another heart attack or the diabetes
is going to get me first. Ah, I'll probably get hit by a dump truck. d8-)

&gt; way these fukn Scooters would appear to &quot;assist&quot; in the mobility of our
&gt; aging population.
&gt; When in reality these scooters are a death sentence for most seniors.

&gt; The *real* solution for diabetes, short of full-blown medical intervention
&gt; (hey, some people actually do need those scooters!) is
&gt; 1.  Boucou g-d Exercise, jack, much more than namby-pamby walking.
&gt; 2.  An Atkins-type diet--which is actually the ADA-prescribed diet for
&gt; diabetics--high fat, high protein, low carb--the only case where it is
&gt; justified, btw.  And of course, complex carbs, no simple carbs/sugars.
&gt; 3.  **Small** frequent meals.  Absolutely essential.
&gt; 4.  As many of these meals *after* bouts of exercise, with some exercise
&gt; after the meal, as well.  goodgawd....

&gt; Tough life, eh??

Excuse me if I'm telling you something you already know, but you might find
it useful to hear about the differences between &quot;type 1&quot; and &quot;type 2&quot;
diabetes. Type 1 (me) is what used to be called &quot;juvenile-onset diabetes.&quot;
It has nothing to do with your weight or lifestyle. It's a genetic condition
in which your T-cells eat your pancreatic cells. No amount of diet or
exercise will combat the basic condition, although it's a condition for
which good diet and exercise are extremely important for otherwise
maintaining good health. Most of us type 1s are fairly lean. I'm 5' 9&quot; and
150 lb.

Type 2 is the condition we associate with old age, overweight, and lack of
exercise. It's an entirely different condition. All it shares with type 1 is
some of the symptoms and dietary restrictions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But actually, a good prescription for non-diabetics, as well, as this
&gt; serves superbly in general weight loss/maintenance strategyies--except for
&gt; the Atkins part.
">

In years past I was on something like an Atkins diet. Fat makes glycemic
control easier for type 1s. However, with better treatment and controls over
the past two decades, that approach has pretty much been abandoned. For that
and other reasons I'm very low-fat these days.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That was all very true for type 1 diabetics until the incidence of
blood-glucose meters and fast-acting analog insulins (the first genetically
engineered pharmaceutical product. &quot;Human&quot; insulin is now made by
gene-spliced e.coli bacteria.) The situation changed almost 20 years ago, in
other words.

Now, we go light on sweets and avoid fat as much as possible.

Speaking of high-fructose corn syrup, unbeknownst to most Merkins, Roger
Miller was quite the amateur nutritionist AND he put his insights to
poetry/song, viz. Hang Me/Dang Me, which were some of the greatest, most
profound lyrics ever penned--imho.
A little sex ed, as well.

Roses are red,
Violets are purple
Sugar is sweet
And so's maple surple.

I was the seventh of seven sons,

Hang me...  Dang me...

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Spotted a claim of sorts that the use of corn syrup as a cheap (cheaper
&gt;&gt;&gt; than real sugar &amp; banned from use in Mexico) sweetner in so many
&gt;&gt;&gt; US products causes or leads to several problems.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A) The body does not count it as sugar (hunger sense in the brain).
&gt;&gt;&gt; B) It can lead to or promoote kidney failure.

&gt;&gt; My sense is this:
&gt;&gt; (A) is likely correct, altho you can argue this for regular sugar in
&gt;&gt; solution as well.  Ie, soders, juices, etc. all have &quot;insensible&quot;
&gt;&gt; calories, to some extent.
&gt;&gt; (B) could be correct, but it has also been demonstrated that very high
&gt;&gt; fructose dosages damage the liver in animals.
&gt;&gt; Most nutritionists would say (were saying) that the amount of fructose in
&gt;&gt; high-fructose corn syrup is nowhere near this amount, but others would
&gt;&gt; disagree, at least claiming altered liver function, if not outright
&gt;&gt; damage.

&gt;&gt; Fructose IS, in fact, metabolized differently than all the other natural
&gt;&gt; sugars, obligatorily in the liver.
&gt;&gt; Note, however ordinary table/cane sugar (sucrose), is a di-saccharide
&gt;&gt; consisting of glucose-fructose, and that fructose is found &quot;free&quot; in
&gt;&gt; fruits.

&gt;&gt; Aspartame:

&gt;&gt; There is as much bullshit and skullduggery in health, nutrition, and
&gt;&gt; science as there is in 9/11 and Iraq.
&gt;&gt; The aspartame story IS an outrage.
&gt;&gt; Even if there were no allegations against it, I wouldn't touch it,
&gt;&gt; because
&gt;&gt; 1. it's making a bunch of assholes super-rich and
&gt;&gt; 2.  it's a *fundamentally unnecessary product*, simply capitalizing, so
&gt;&gt; to speak, on our collective inability to exercise discipline.  Or
&gt;&gt; exercise, period.

&gt; Hey, wait a minute. How about us type 1 diabetics? d8-)

&gt; I'm not talking type 2. I'm almost skinny. But aspartame has been a great
&gt; thing.

&gt; Other artificial sweeteners are OK, too.

&gt; &quot;Corn syrup&quot; will give you 201 hits on PubMed (peer-reviewed medical
&gt; journal articles). The consensus seems to be no detectable metabolic
&gt; differences between corn syrup and other common sources of dietary sugar.

&gt; However, I am not a medical professional. I just re-write and edit them.
&gt; And if that doesn't scare you, nothing will. d8-)

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not sure why Mexico is anti-corn syrup.

&gt; My guess is it's the sugar-cane lobby in Mexico.

&gt;&gt; Also, there's all kinds of high-fructose corn syrup, some much higher
&gt;&gt; than others, depending on the processes used.

&gt;&gt; I think more of the problem with HFCS is its effects on appetite

It reduces your need for insulin, but, more importantly, it has a

After my broke neck bidniss, they forbade me to lift weights--ever-- and

But no thanks Big Medicine.
Altho, the doc (who did all the surgery) was godsent.
The rest were useless.

The point being that altho I would stop short of calling Medicine outright
corrupt or conspiratorial (many would not stop short), it is peculiarly
impotent in so many aspects, in large part because of the drug
companies--which ARE *definitively* corrupt and rife w/ conspiracy, to fuck

Ken Cooper was preaching this type of stuff since 1968, when he wrote, I
believe, his first running book.
An outstanding book, written extremely well, very low-keyed, but still very
inspiring.
Basically did experiments on the whole goddam military re running, as an MD.
Started the running fanaticism in the 80's.
Now everyfuknbody's doin ellipticals'n'shit.

I recommend this book to everyone interested in health.

I loathe running, but do it fairly religiously in a very inneresting
regimen, in 1/4 mi (one lap) &quot;bursts&quot;.
Fukn kills me, just kills me, more peculiarities of the broke neck bidniss,
but all the more reason to do it.

One's physical ability (knees, back, feet, etc) notwithstanding, I think
running is actually *under*-rated in health.
Altho I believe marathoning is proly the exercise-equivalent to smoking.
goodgawd...
Without a doubt, marathoning shortens lifespans.  You can actually prove
this using theorems in calculus regarding optimization.  :)

Even Ken Cooper put the kabosh on marathoning, by estimating and upper
caloric expenditure in running of 3,000 cals/wk, which corresponds to about
25 miles *per week* of running, maximum.
And proly a lot less than that.
But of course, Yupsters must show that their dicks are bigger than that of
any other socio-economic class, so a-Boston and a-NYC-marathoning away they
go!!
Give me a big fuknBreak...

100 percent casualties with only three wounded? One of the three was the

I don't run. I ran cross-country and track in high school, all three
seasons, and developed the most God-awful shin splints you ever heard of. So
I switched to bicycles (I raced them for a couple of years, in sprints) and
my knees and shins have been happy ever since.

I'd also like to start rowing again, but getting to water is a PITA. I rowed
on the lightweight crew team in college.

&gt; seasons, and developed the most God-awful shin splints you ever heard of.
&gt; So I switched to bicycles (I raced them for a couple of years, in sprints)
&gt; and my knees and shins have been happy ever since.

&gt; I'd also like to start rowing again, but getting to water is a PITA. I
&gt; rowed on the lightweight crew team in college.
">

The key to running is not to run too much.
Ken Cooper's 1968 book (which you would enjoy, as a health-consumer AND as a
writer) had surprisingly mild recommendations, on the order of just a few
miles *per week*.
Just check out rec.running (if ever a ng was nuked by nutcases, this is it),
and about 50% of the legitimate posts are on injuries.  Get a clue, right?

Ozzie Gontang, rec.running's &quot;Bottle&quot;, does a marvelous FAQ on running.
He himself is, iirc, a PhD'd psycho-therapist, who uses running as a part of
therapy.
Which is what I did, way back.  Yeah, yeah, I know, but just imagine if I
*hadn't* done it....
Which makes him perhaps one of the few legitimate therapists, in a very
dubious biz, on the effing planet.
Now I'm feeling the need to be held.....

Rowing is one of *the* best whole-body exercises on the planet--real rowing,
not the dopey machines.
The other is a modified free-weight &quot;clean &amp; jerk&quot;.
The other is My Folly.  Yes indeedy.
Arguably *the* best of all.  No foolin.
Running is up there as well, but for slightly different reasons.
Much much more to say, but then I'd be giving away my book!

Walking is a *surprising* calorie burner, altho it eats up time.
I'm not a walking fan, and think it's being mis-applied in many contexts in
fitness, but if one has the time, esp. w/ shit like diabetes, you can
*easily* burn 300 cals/hr walking a fairly leisurely 17 min mile (3.5
mi/hr).  Standard 70 kg (154 lb) male.
400 cals/hr would come from just a little more effort, mebbe a 15.5-16 min
mile.

3.0 mi/hr (20 min/mi) is how fast city workers  walk, when yer standin on a
line of 75 people goin effing crazy.  This is the &quot;Fuck You&quot; walk.
Iffin you was with yer gerl on a beach, it would be a Lover's Stroll.

A 15 min mile ( 4 mph) starts to get a little brisk.  14 min mile very
brisk.  Any faster and you feel like breaking into a jog.
Race walking is incredible.  Not only can you *blast off calories*, jack,
you get to explore your feminine side at the same time.

A retired person, walking/hiking 5 hours/day, could *easily* burn an
*astounding* 1,500-2,000 calories *per day* walking leisurely+.  And double
that for a 6% grade.

THAT should knock effing Type II diabetes out of *anyone*!

Whereas, most people profiling in a commercial gym, circuit-training'n'shit,
in gymwear that costs more than most evening wear, are lucky if they burn
200 cals in exercise, over a cupla hours.
Which is the bane of &quot;isolated muscle&quot; type exercise and bullshit machines.
And of profiling in expensive gymwear.  Hey, don't mess up my hair...

Ab workouts burn close to zero calories.  You'd burn more calories beating
yer meat.  No foolin.
Which proly explains why jb is relatively trim.
And myopic.

As you stated, real rowing is not readily accessible.
A few around here kayak up/down the Hudson!
Course, they gotta duck/dodge effing speedboats, jet skis, and BigDick
Yachts....
No peace and quiet, anywhere, not even on an effing mile-wide river....
goodgawd...

Any time I eat anything with corn surrup in it, all my muscles ache the
next morning. I discovered that when I was young and have always tried
not to eat the stuff ever since.  The problem is that it's put in almost
everything.  I don't think its so much the corn surrup itself but the
sprays they put on the corn when they grow it.
A farmer friend of mine who grew corn for his cows said that the first
year he started spraying his corn, the cows would not touch the stuff
for weeks till they got real hungry.  They finally got used to the
stuff.

&gt;&gt;  Spotted a claim of sorts that the use of corn syrup as a cheap (cheaper
&gt;&gt; than real sugar &amp; banned from use in Mexico) sweetner in so many
&gt;&gt; US products causes or leads to several problems.

&gt;&gt; A) The body does not count it as sugar (hunger sense in the brain).
&gt;&gt; B) It can lead to or promoote kidney failure.

&gt;My sense is this:
&gt;(A) is likely correct, altho you can argue this for regular sugar in
&gt;solution as well.  Ie, soders, juices, etc. all have &quot;insensible&quot; calories,
&gt;to some extent.
">

The US uses corn syrup in much of that and the rest probably
contains fructose anyway (same as the high fructose corn syrup).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;(B) could be correct, but it has also been demonstrated that very high
&gt;fructose dosages damage the liver in animals.

As in high fructose corn syrup.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Most nutritionists would say (were saying) that the amount of fructose in
&gt;high-fructose corn syrup is nowhere near this amount, but others would
&gt;disagree, at least claiming altered liver function, if not outright damage.

&gt;Fructose IS, in fact, metabolized differently than all the other natural
&gt;sugars, obligatorily in the liver.
&gt;Note, however ordinary table/cane sugar (sucrose), is a di-saccharide
&gt;consisting of glucose-fructose, and that fructose is found &quot;free&quot; in fruits.

&gt;Aspartame:

&gt;There is as much bullshit and skullduggery in health, nutrition, and science
&gt;as there is in 9/11 and Iraq.
&gt;The aspartame story IS an outrage.
&gt;Even if there were no allegations against it, I wouldn't touch it, because
&gt;1. it's making a bunch of assholes super-rich and
&gt;2.  it's a *fundamentally unnecessary product*, simply capitalizing, so to
&gt;speak, on our collective inability to exercise discipline.  Or exercise,
