Technology, not panic, will solve the climate challenge

A SUCCESSION of public figures succumbed to climate change hysteria
this week as if it were a contagion. Sufferers exhibited symptoms that
included an inability to deal with facts and a propensity to offer
wild surmises, to adopt irrational positions and to ignore practical
solutions.

On Monday, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty told a
criminology conference that &quot;climate change would be the biggest
security issue of the 21st century&quot;. Mr Keelty's feverish imaginings
conjured up a new &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;, with millions of Chinese on the move
because of their &quot;dramatically shrinking&quot; land, crossing &quot;borders and
oceans&quot; in forced migration.

There is one small problem with Mr Keelty's doomsday predictions: he
based them on outdated statistics. The latest report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts a possible rise in
sea levels during the whole of the next century of only 43cm, half the
figure cited by Mr Keelty. Which means that climate change might be
the biggest threat of the 22nd century, assuming that no effective
action were taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

John Howard also abandoned rational positions he had adopted as
recently as June, opting for populist policies to appeal to voters.
The Prime Minister's hand-picked task force on climate change had
recommended a national carbon emissions trading scheme that dispensed
with the mish-mash of state government political fixes. Unable to
deliver this in the lead-up to an election, Mr Howard opted to rebadge
the states' targets as his own.

The Opposition continued its opportunistic scaremongering about
nuclear power yesterday with an announcement that the federal
Government had a secret nuclear reactor plan after Mr Howard stated
what in fact was obvious, that it would be unlikely that laws enabling
nuclear power would be ready before the election. The ALP never tires
of trumpeting its support for the Kyoto Protocol, but it is loath to
acknowledge the key role that nuclear power has played in enabling
some Kyoto signatories to keep emissions in check. If the ALP were
serious about fast, deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, they
would be barracking for the next power plant in NSW to be nuclear, but
it is more interested in greenhouse gasbagging.

Quick to capitalise on the drought to push the climate change barrow,
Greens senator Rachel Siewert said on Wednesday, &quot;We are now dealing
with the impact of climate change on agriculture&quot;. More informed
voices begged to differ. Amanda Lynch of Monash University and
University of Southern Queensland professor in climatology and water
resources Roger Stone said more research was needed to establish what,
if any, influence climate change had on drought.

At the heart of the moral panic being whipped up about climate change
is the belief that global warming is not an environmental challenge
that requires technological solutions but a moral judgment on a sinful
society, divine retribution meted out by the earth goddess Gaia for
our willful destruction of the planet. Green millenarians like to
claim that the only solution is to return to a pre-industrial economy.
The truth is that scientists, inventors and entrepreneurs are already
coming up with solutions. In July this year, with no fanfare, three
Welsh inventors announced a method of capturing the carbon dioxide
emissions from cars, allowing them to be recycled into bio-fuels. The
Victor Smorgon Group is also assessing a system to use algae to reduce
carbon emissions at power plants by up to 80 per cent. It is these
quiet achievers, not the greenhouse hysterics, who deserve our
acknowledgement and support.

Wherever I go it will be well with me, for it was well with me here, not
on account of the place, but of my judgments which I shall carry away
with me, for no one can deprive me of these; on the contrary, they alone
are my property, and cannot be taken away, and to possess them suffices
me wherever I am or whatever I do. -- EPICTETUS
