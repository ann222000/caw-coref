A certain method as attack was to allow the US a tank destruction,
while enemy would never see the design.  Early tanks had a special
design.

And the enemy was to not understand why they were lost.

And you were supposed to be trained for the attack.  It is still
recited in the real rule book.

Obsolete rules are still recited, but stated as superceded.

A wing on an aircraft training is still like this today.

State the design flaw. For WWI tanks

I heartily agree with you however it is unwise to forget the crucial
role played by the spraggler gear in the frumious bandersnatch
especially at Kursk on Sunday mornings while the Red Army choir sung
"I'm a Little Teapot".  Having said that moose is about to attain a
responsive cognitive process within  the total accelerated activity
during which incremental motivation options will monitor perceptual
monitored catastrophism during prompt motoric concepts.  However
systematised culture contingency and perceptual percent catastrophism
negate the protocol digital concept within accretive culture
transition during optional proclivity interface.

I actually understood your response better than what he originally wrote. If
I were to write something like what he did, it might be something like this:

*****

At times bombers were fighters, and fighters were bombers. Then there were
bombers. And fighters. And some more fighters. And bombers bombed.

But later, after this event just described, the German leadership responded
to the catastrophe. They produced new U-boats. These submarines helped with
the bombers and fighters.

The industrial production under Speer was good. That's why we felt good
about Italy and Normandy and the Rhine and the Neisse and the Oder and
Berlin...we could defend them. Our airforce was strong, and we were winning,
until the Americans betrayed us.

Our militia units in North America still believe in our destiny - we can win
back the Fatherland. But we need the most modern tanks - MkIIIs and MkIVs
with 75mm stubbies. With those Vergeltungswaffen we will crush the Slavs.

When will the US Marine Corps stop planning to invade the Crimea? We do not
have enough LCUs. And there are only 6 battleships left.

*****

Between you and me, Eugene, Eagleson's post was the most disjointed post I
have seen in months. And yet is was generally grammatical, and spelled
correctly. I was in awe of it, and have since forwarded his resume to the
White House and several Madison Avenue agencies.

I could do that job; you just need some tried and true phrases:

"I am committed to our company strategy" [ we don't exactly have it planned
yet ]

"All of our employees deserve the best from our leadership" [except for the
2,000 that we just laid off ]

"Quality is number one". [ Nobody said low, medium or high quality, though ]

"I myself fought my way up from the bottom" [yes, starting as the CEO's
son ]

"We are cutting waste to cut costs to our customers" [ I'm not losing my
yacht, but the employees aren't getting company health anymore ]

"We are there for you 24/7" [ I'm not - the underpaid on-call technician is,
though ]

I do get the idea that you are desperately trying to say something -
maybe its in code?  If so the key is too complex for me to decipher.

I made myself _very_ unpopular with a member of the Board of Directors
of my last employer by answering honestly to "what do you think we could
do better?"

He took exception to my suggestion that we needed fewer headline
initiatives from On High that wasted time on slogans and buzzwords, then
went suspiciously silent before we switched from "Continued Excellence"
to "Carpe Diem", instead sticking to _one_ "change initiative" and
pursuing it properly rather than switching at six to twelve month
intervals. (In particular, people were starting to catch on that every
change initiative died at the point where the company might actually
have to spend _real_ money rather than waste a few hours per employee on
get-togethers and writing in Post-Its.

In fact, he huffed and he puffed and said that it was not enough to carp
and complain; if I didn't have a solution I should keep quiet.

I pointed out that this problem was one imposed from the top, and that
if it was my job to _find_ the problems and my job to _fix_ the problems
then what was _his_ job?

He muttered that I "wasn't a team player" and avoided my eye for the few
minutes left of the Q&amp;A. Shortly thereafter he disappeared to London
Transport, and has not been much heard from since... I'd love to claim
credit but I think his lack of talent caught up to him.

Moral - be careful about coming to an evening inspirational with your
corporate MSc students :) The students tend to be experienced in both
Company practice and military procurement, which makes them _very_
cynical and distrustful...

Moral secundus... being honest will get you a most interesting and
enjoyable career, but you won't make the big bucks :(

“Class is fundamentally used in the service of the status quo,” says
Baudrillard; however, according to von Junz[1] , it is not so much class
that is fundamentally used in the service of the status quo, but rather
the economy, and subsequent meaninglessness, of class. Therefore,
Derrida uses the term ‘neostructural rationalism’ to denote the
common ground between society and sexual identity.

In the works of Eco, a predominant concept is the distinction between
destruction and creation. The subject is contextualised into a
Batailleist `powerful communication’ that includes narrativity as a
reality. In a sense, the primary theme of the works of Eco is a
mythopoetical whole.

Many deconstructivisms concerning the collapse, and eventually the
defining characteristic, of capitalist class may be discovered. Thus,
the example of the textual paradigm of narrative depicted in Eco’s
Foucault’s Pendulum is also evident in The Island of the Day Before.

Lyotard suggests the use of premodern nihilism to attack capitalism.
Therefore, the subject is interpolated into a neostructural rationalism
that includes sexuality as a paradox.

The textual paradigm of narrative states that reality may be used to
reinforce elitist perceptions of society, given that the premise of
neostructural rationalism is valid. It could be said that if the
precultural paradigm of context holds, we have to choose between
neostructural rationalism and capitalist nationalism.

Hamburger[2] implies that the works of Eco are empowering. Therefore,
the main theme of Bailey’s[3] essay on the textual paradigm of
narrative is the role of the poet as writer.

The characteristic theme of the works of Spelling is the bridge between
sexuality and society. Marx’s model of premodern nihilism suggests
that discourse must come from the masses. It could be said that Debord
uses the term ‘neostructural rationalism’ to denote the stasis of
subdialectic truth.

If one examines premodern nihilism, one is faced with a choice: either
reject the textual paradigm of narrative or conclude that culture is
used to oppress the proletariat, but only if language is interchangeable
with consciousness. Baudrillard promotes the use of neostructural
rationalism to deconstruct class. Therefore, the textual paradigm of
narrative states that sexual identity has objective value.

Lacan suggests the use of the semanticist paradigm of context to
challenge hierarchy. However, the premise of neostructural rationalism
implies that language serves to entrench sexism, given that premodern
nihilism is invalid.

The absurdity, and eventually the stasis, of the textual paradigm of
narrative prevalent in Spelling’s Charmed emerges again in The
Heights, although in a more neotextual sense. Thus, the subject is
contextualised into a neostructural rationalism that includes truth as a
whole.

If the textual paradigm of narrative holds, we have to choose between
neostructural rationalism and modern nihilism. It could be said that the
subject is interpolated into a premodern nihilism that includes
consciousness as a paradox.

In the works of Spelling, a predominant concept is the concept of
postdialectic truth. The primary theme of Geoffrey’s[4] critique of
textual materialism is a mythopoetical reality. But Baudrillard promotes
the use of premodern nihilism to analyse and deconstruct culture.

An abundance of desituationisms concerning neostructural rationalism
exist. Thus, the premise of premodern nihilism states that discourse is
a product of the collective unconscious.

La Fournier[5] suggests that we have to choose between cultural
deconstruction and pretextual capitalist theory. But in Charmed,
Spelling examines Sartreist existentialism; in The Heights he denies
neostructural rationalism.

A number of narratives concerning the collapse, and thus the fatal flaw,
of posttextual class may be revealed. It could be said that Lacan uses
the term ‘premodern nihilism’ to denote not theory, but subtheory.

&gt; *****

&gt; At times bombers were fighters, and fighters were bombers. Then there were
&gt; bombers. And fighters. And some more fighters. And bombers bombed.

&gt; But later, after this event just described, the German leadership responded
&gt; to the catastrophe. They produced new U-boats. These submarines helped with
&gt; the bombers and fighters.

&gt; The industrial production under Speer was good. That's why we felt good
&gt; about Italy and Normandy and the Rhine and the Neisse and the Oder and
&gt; Berlin...we could defend them. Our airforce was strong, and we were winning,
&gt; until the Americans betrayed us.

&gt; Our militia units in North America still believe in our destiny - we can win
&gt; back the Fatherland. But we need the most modern tanks - MkIIIs and MkIVs
&gt; with 75mm stubbies. With those Vergeltungswaffen we will crush the Slavs.

&gt; When will the US Marine Corps stop planning to invade the Crimea? We do not
&gt; have enough LCUs. And there are only 6 battleships left.

&gt; *****

&gt; Between you and me, Eugene, Eagleson's post was the most disjointed post I
&gt; have seen in months. And yet is was generally grammatical, and spelled
&gt; correctly. I was in awe of it, and have since forwarded his resume to the

&gt; &gt; A certain method as attack was to allow the US a tank destruction,

&gt; &gt; design.

&gt; &gt; And the enemy was to not understand why they were lost.

&gt; &gt; And you were supposed to be trained for the attack.  It is still

&gt; &gt; Obsolete rules are still recited, but stated as superceded.

&gt; &gt; A wing on an aircraft training is still like this today.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;Class is fundamentally used in the service of the status quo,&quot; says
&gt; Baudrillard; however, according to von Junz[1] , it is not so much class
&gt; that is fundamentally used in the service of the status quo, but rather the
&gt; economy, and subsequent meaninglessness, of class. Therefore, Derrida uses
&gt; the term 'neostructural rationalism' to denote the common ground between
&gt; society and sexual identity.

&gt; In the works of Eco, a predominant concept is the distinction between
&gt; destruction and creation. The subject is contextualised into a Batailleist
&gt; `powerful communication' that includes narrativity as a reality. In a sense,
&gt; the primary theme of the works of Eco is a mythopoetical whole.

&gt; Many deconstructivisms concerning the collapse, and eventually the defining
&gt; characteristic, of capitalist class may be discovered. Thus, the example of
&gt; the textual paradigm of narrative depicted in Eco's Foucault's Pendulum is
&gt; also evident in The Island of the Day Before.

&gt; Lyotard suggests the use of premodern nihilism to attack capitalism.
&gt; Therefore, the subject is interpolated into a neostructural rationalism that
&gt; includes sexuality as a paradox.

&gt; The textual paradigm of narrative states that reality may be used to
&gt; reinforce elitist perceptions of society, given that the premise of
&gt; neostructural rationalism is valid. It could be said that if the precultural
&gt; paradigm of context holds, we have to choose between neostructural
&gt; rationalism and capitalist nationalism.

&gt; Hamburger[2] implies that the works of Eco are empowering. Therefore, the
&gt; main theme of Bailey's[3] essay on the textual paradigm of narrative is the
&gt; role of the poet as writer.

&gt; The characteristic theme of the works of Spelling is the bridge between
&gt; sexuality and society. Marx's model of premodern nihilism suggests that
&gt; discourse must come from the masses. It could be said that Debord uses the
&gt; term 'neostructural rationalism' to denote the stasis of subdialectic truth.

&gt; If one examines premodern nihilism, one is faced with a choice: either
&gt; reject the textual paradigm of narrative or conclude that culture is used to
&gt; oppress the proletariat, but only if language is interchangeable with
&gt; consciousness. Baudrillard promotes the use of neostructural rationalism to
&gt; deconstruct class. Therefore, the textual paradigm of narrative states that
&gt; sexual identity has objective value.

&gt; Lacan suggests the use of the semanticist paradigm of context to challenge
&gt; hierarchy. However, the premise of neostructural rationalism implies that
&gt; language serves to entrench sexism, given that premodern nihilism is
&gt; invalid.

&gt; The absurdity, and eventually the stasis, of the textual paradigm of
&gt; narrative prevalent in Spelling's Charmed emerges again in The Heights,
&gt; although in a more neotextual sense. Thus, the subject is contextualised
&gt; into a neostructural rationalism that includes truth as a whole.

&gt; If the textual paradigm of narrative holds, we have to choose between
&gt; neostructural rationalism and modern nihilism. It could be said that the
&gt; subject is interpolated into a premodern nihilism that includes
&gt; consciousness as a paradox.

&gt; In the works of Spelling, a predominant concept is the concept of
&gt; postdialectic truth. The primary theme of Geoffrey's[4] critique of textual
&gt; materialism is a mythopoetical reality. But Baudrillard promotes the use of
&gt; premodern nihilism to analyse and deconstruct culture.

&gt; An abundance of desituationisms concerning neostructural rationalism exist.
&gt; Thus, the premise of premodern nihilism states that discourse is a product
&gt; of the collective unconscious.

&gt; La Fournier[5] suggests that we have to choose between cultural
&gt; deconstruction and pretextual capitalist theory. But in Charmed, Spelling
&gt; examines Sartreist existentialism; in The Heights he denies neostructural
&gt; rationalism.

&gt; A number of narratives concerning the collapse, and thus the fatal flaw, of
&gt; posttextual class may be revealed. It could be said that Lacan uses the term
&gt; 'premodern nihilism' to denote not theory, but subtheory.

You are docked 10 marks each for failing to footnote Baudrillard, Derrida,
Eco, Lyotard, Spelling, Marx, Debord and Lacan.

Twenty per cent -- a less than stellar effort, even for a

That was generated? I've read stuff like that in articles written by tenured
profs who specialize in literary criticism. It's fearsome stuff, and what's
worse, the authors actually believe the drivel they write.

I actually got exposed to this stuff as early as high school, since I was
advanced academic stream and took European Lit in Grade 12. The teacher
exposed us to Sartre. I'm not sure that anyone of any age should ever be
exposed to Sartre, let alone 17 and 18 year-old Nova Scotian teenagers, but
there you go. But I've not been the same since.
