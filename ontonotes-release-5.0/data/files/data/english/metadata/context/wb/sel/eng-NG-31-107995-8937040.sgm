here's the link
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item;=300154479722

I didn't know these things existed - really tempted to keep it myself, but I
don't do enough sheet metal work to justify the (small) space it takes up -
here's your chance - good condition, ready to use

You may be right, but the nameplate says &quot;burr beaver&quot; (I love that name,
just love it) --- so that, and the fact that I was told that it's purpose
was as I said, makes me think it is really for burr removal -

I found Burr Beaver on Thomas.net here
http://www.thomasnet.com/bsearch.html?cov=NA&amp;which;=brand&amp;brandid;=3219...
Blanchard Industrial Supplies, Inc. - Troy, NY
Distributor, Service Company
Company Profile: Industrial distributors, general line.
Brand Names: Burr Beaver, 3M, Abrasive Technology, Accurite, Acme-Fette,
Advanced, Air Turbine, Allied Machine

but that seems to be just a distribution company.

then, with some more searching, I found this:

Simco Industries, Inc.-Mfg of Bur-Beaver
16580 Industrial Street
Roseville, Michigan 48066-1931
United States
Phone: (810) 772-1910
Fax: 978-352-5616

but they were bought by Ufp which makes packaging products, so maybe this
little tool is now an orphan, who knows.......

I have seen machines like this sold for bevelling nametag blanks,
bevelling plates for welding, as well as, as deburring machines.

I think the distinction probably boils down to horsepower and intended
use.
