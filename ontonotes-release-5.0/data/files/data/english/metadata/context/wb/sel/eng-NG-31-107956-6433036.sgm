I've gotten a few replies, which I am thankful for, but I'm hoping for
a few more before I plunk my money on the table.  Dual function VS
single function engine controls for twin inboards- which do you
prefer, and why?  Any particular brands that you are partial to?  I am
seriously considering the Uflex B58 controls.

Thanks,
Michael

Sorry to double up on my responses.............. Best bet, try to find some
boats that have different set-ups and try them both out to see which one
suits you best.
I'm a strong proponent of using rudders even with twin screw, so having one
hand free for the wheel with the other free for the engine controls is
important and for this, one set of controls which takes care of throttle
and reverse gear, makes life easier.

I was a little confused the first time I replied, so allow me to try
again.

Personally, I like engine and throttle controls in one package. Being
right handed, I prefer them on the right side.  Having seperate left
(gear) right (throttle) controls seems unnecessarily complicated to me
as  you use them the same way.

In my use with outboards, I could control both engines with one hand
and the other never left the steering control.  Somehow that seems
safer to me and a lot less complicated.

It's really a personel preferance kind of thing. I prefer seperate
controls myself, you typically get a greater range of travel on the
throttles, but not on all set ups. It's also a little easier to get
home if your having low speed stalling problems, yes, you do have to
"slam it into gear", but you can get home if your having a problem,
it's much more difficult on most single lever systems, you can do it
with them, but you really end up slamming it in gear. The bad side of
dual controls, you can end up pulling them in and out of gear at high
speed by accident. And with twice as many control levers to deal with
their more prone to being bumped into, at the wrong time. Their is no
perfect system, it's what you like best that matters most.

I'm a single screw boater, and therefore used to separate controls for
throttle and gearbox. Whatever you decide upon, mount them where a
coat sleeve, etc, won't catch them. I almost screwed up in our local
locks two weekends ago when I turned to see something behind me and my
coat sleeve knocked the lever into reverse. Fortunately, I noticed it
right away but if I had not it could have led to a problem.

With a twin engine setup, my intuition would be to go with combined
controls for throtle and gearbox. Two levers are enough to fiddle
with, and in a situation where you want more rpm on one engine than on
the other (such as turning *exactly* in place) you can still use
different engine speeds while controlling the direction of thrust.

Can't think of a situation where it would be desirable to be in
neutral with a high engine rpm- (except maybe "slamming into gear due
to stalling"- mentioned by another poster to this thread)- and that's
about all you would give up by using the combined control.

It all comes down to what you are used to (and what you want to
learn).

The vast majority of inboard twin engine boats are set up with
separate shift levers and throttles, so that's what most people are
used to.  If you want your boat to look like most others, and handle
the same way, go with that layout.

Ouboards and I/Os are different.  Most of them have single lever
controls.

Yes - yes they are.

Outboards are far superior to inboards.  :&gt;)

I have to be totally honest - the last time I took a twin engined boat
out for a ride (when I was looking last Fall), I could never get the
whole grear shift/throttle thing straight.

I think you are right - it's really what you are used to. With the
Contenders, they were integrated on one housing. And I never really
did much manuevering with the engines other than using one or the
other in reverse with the opposite engine in neutral depending on
where I wanted or needed to put the boat.

My lobster boat was a single screw, and had separate levers- in that
situation it was necessary as you would always be nudging up the idle
to give the hydraulic hauler (which ran off of a shaft off the front
of the engine) a little extra juice.  I don't think I'll be hauling
any lobster pots in my cabin cruiser, though...

Any particular brand that you are partial to?  I had Morse controls on
the lobster boat and they were pretty bomb proof.  Pretty expensive
too, though.

Thanks for all the advice, I appreciate it!

Michael

I had Evinrude controls - came with the engines.
