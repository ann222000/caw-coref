I'm planning my first trip to Brimfield. I've read about it for years and seen
it on television. Finally I live close enough to drive. Would love to hear
from others how to get the most out of this experience. Suggestions for where
to stay and where not to stay. Where to eat. How early should I get there each
morning? Any safety issues? Is any one time (May, July or September) better?
TIA. Ashley

&gt; I'm planning my first trip to Brimfield.

"/>&lt;snip&gt;

Hi Ashley! I'm from Texas and was in the NE for something or other last
year and decided I'd try Brimfield out myself for the first time.

I enjoyed it, I thought the quality of goods better than what I
typically find in Texas, but I also thought the prices higher.

I stayed at a B &amp; B near Brimfield in the tiny community of Holland
called The River's Edge. Very charming and with really nice people
(Laurie &amp; Wayne) running it. You can see some info about it at:

http://www.brimfield-antiqueshow.com/re/

and then go to:

http://www.brimfield-antiqueshow.com

for more info on Brimfield, itself.

I'd vote for May or September for the weather. I went in July. Even
though it is hotter than H - E - Double Tooth Picks here in Texas, for
some reason or another, I almost had heat exhaustion in Brimfield, where
it seemed 15 or 20 degrees cooler than what I'm used to.

To me, one of the ODD things about Brimfield is the &quot;paying&quot; fields.
You have all these fields, some for a fee and some free that open and
close on different days and times. What was wierd is that I'd cruise in
to a paying field a couple of hours before it was supposed to close and
the dealers would all frantically be packing there stuff to MOVE to
another field. And then, before the opening of some of the paying
fields, there would be lines of people waiting to get in. Just seemed
all around strange to me for some reason. Especially the dealers
packing up early just so they could move and set up two blocks away.
There's probably some spending/buying/buyer pyschology going on with
this that eludes me.

Do the usual stuff: comfortable shoes and loose clothing, hat,
sunscreen, lots of cash, etc., etc.

And, Oh, for lunch or a snack, don't forget to have one of those
delicacies of New England which I've never seen in the Great State of
Texas: Fried Dough. But then again, the New Englanders have probably
never had a Spam-a-Rama like we do annually in Austin.

Good luck and have fun! Susan

"/> Yes, please post. I may not do Brimfield, I don't like huge crowds and
my schedule already won't accomodate all the enjoyable things I already
want to fit into it - but meeting 'net friends is always a neat
exercise, and I live close enough to make it on short notice.

Susan, thanks for the Brimfield pointer. Can I ask how many days you
were at the shows? I'm thinking about making the fall Brimfield my
annual vacation.

Anyone else going in September? (Anyone else reading r.a, that is. :-)

Charleen

Well, Charleen, I may have missed the ball for getting reservations this May.

Ashley, If you have not made reservations you won't get them this late. I have
gone every year for the past 7 years and lately we have been staying in Endfield
(?s)Conn. It's about 40 miles south of Brimfield, Ma. IMO spring is the best
time. You get a shot at all the new merchandise from previous winter. You have to
keep you wits about you, keep you money (cash best) in you pocket and hands free.
You will see a lot of good and bad merchandise....it's like a giant carnival. Lots
of food vendors, lots and lots of walking. Take a light weight back pack or strong
cloth bags that can be worn across you shoulder because you will probably have to
park a long distance from the fields and won't be able to unload too often. Dress
in layers, I've been in snow, rain, and heat....all in the same week. I like to go
to the opening shows on Tuesday and Wednesday, skip thursday and come back on
Friday and Saturday. Depends on what you're looking for. A lot of the shows
(fields) have up to 700 dealers and there are usually at least 3 fields opening a
day sometimes more. A lot of dealers arrive early in the week with empty vans and
buy to set up in one of the fields at the end of the week. I've seen merchandise
start out at $15.00 only to end at $150.00 by the end of the show. It's a lot of
fun just don't take it too seriously. Know something about what you're buying.
There are a lot of repop's, married pieces and just made yesterday type stuff along
with great buys, but the great buys are getting harder to find. Go and enjoy the
experience. I can't go this year have a husband comuting from Jacksonville, Fla
and he just can't get the time off this spring; but I'll be there next year.

I highly suggest anyone going to Brimfiled subscribe to the Brimfield Antiques
Guide, RFD 1 Box 20, Brimfield MA 01010 phone 413-245-9329. With so many
different shows opening and closing it can be difficult to keep up. Some of the
shows advertise in different antiques publications, but not all of them. So the
BAG is a good source of information for everything and it includes info on how
to get there and where to stay.

I went in September several years ago and it was great. Most people tell me May
is better. If anyone wants to pick up a copy of AntiqueWeek, we will have a
booth at Heart of the Mart on its first two days at the May show. I won't be
there (sadly) one of our writers, who lives near by, is just going to keep
papers stacked at the show for us.

Have fun!
Connie

I haven't checked recently, but there was a Brimfield web page that had
alot of good info, and did have the calender of when all the different
shows open/close. Try doing a search for &quot;Brimfield&quot;

Ashley,
Thanks for asking about Brimfield; your questions and all the good info in the
thread got me excited about going. My
mother and I had a trip planned to Williamsburg during that time, so on a whim this
morning I called the Brimfield area
chamber of commerce for info. They had just gotten word of a cancellation at a B &amp;
B during the May show, so I called and got the room! Now we'll get to do
Williamsburg and Brimfield...can't wait!

Incidentally, since we'll be traveling from MA to VA, if anyone is aware of any
good antique shops along the way I'd love
to hear about them.

I usually go to the May show because it's cooler. July can be awfully hot &amp;
humid when you're walking around in the sun. About the &quot;paying&quot; fields. They
tend to have the more expensive stuff, with dealers specializing in something
or other. I prefer the other fields because the merchandise is more varied &amp;
the prices tend to be more reasonable since those are the fields where all
those specialized dealers from the paying fields shop, too! have fun!

You asked about antique shops on the way to VA. Suggest before you
leave the area you checkout the Town of Sturbridge, MA. (6 mi. East of
Brimfield on Rte. 20). There are several good sized co-ops there
including:  www.showcaseantiques.com . At the entrance to Old Sturbridge
Village. Top quality merchandise in locked showcases.

Brimfield (or West) LOL ...I do not have a map here.
