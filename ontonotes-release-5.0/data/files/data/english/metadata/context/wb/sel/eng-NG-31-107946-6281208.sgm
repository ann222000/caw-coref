Hi everyone, I'm new here.
I live in San Francisco, California.
A couple of days ago I've watched that documentary on Van Nuys Airport.
That was enough to get that old itch going again. I need to get my
license.
Right now I'm still finding what to look for when searching for a
school, instructor, etc.
I have a gazillion of questions, but since it's past my bed time, I'll
ask only one.
Does anyone know "Oakland Flyers" ?
http://www.oaklandflyers.com
Is it a case of "you get what you pay for"?
Any comments on Oakland Flyers would be greatly appreciated.
Well, any tips on how to go about this selection process, home vs.
ground school study, independent instructor vs. school. Any
recomendation. Anything would help.

Thanks a lot.

PS: just browsing some earlier posts I already learned quite a bit.
I'll stick around. Hopefully one day I'll be posting some answers.

I know your original post was regarding Oakland Flyers out of the GA runway
at OAK, but since I too, live in San Francisco I wanted to mention that you
might want to consider Reid-Hillview in San Jose.  I make the drive everyday
and it is about 45 minutes in good traffic (I use 280 so there is almost
always a good no-stop drive all the way to my home airport).

The main reason I mention RHV (Reid-Hillview Airport) in San Jose is that it
has many advantages - the main one is that most of our days are usually
flyable and not plagued by the issues with fog and low overcast that OAK and
some of the GA airports North of us, often experiences because of  their
proximity to the bay.  Having more flyable days will translate to more
steady progress in your primary training.   The other beauty of flying out
of RHV is that we sit beneath a convenient 'cut-out' of San Jose
International's Class C airspace.  What this means is that we have a
instructional environment where we can bring a student into the slightly
more complex communication challenges of  dealing with the Class C airspace
when the student is ready.  Until then we have plenty of airspace where we
can focus on training the rudiments of learning to fly, just east and south
of of our airport.  RHV being a Class D airport means that you will have
experience dealing with a towered airport, right from the start.

There are several flight schools at our airport; Nice Air (where I fly and
instruct), Tradewinds Aviation, Squadron 2 and, last but not least, Amelia
Reid Aviation (which focuses on learning to fly in tailwheel aircraft ((that
is instead of the tricycle gear aircraft that have a nosewheel))).

So, though you may have been thinking about Oakland (dealing with the fog
and Bay Bridge traffic) you might want to consider RHV in San Jose.  I
should mention that further down 101 south there is San Carlos Airport and
Palo Alto Airport, the only 'problem' with these two airports is that they
are more often affected by fog and that crosswinds are more the norm than
the exception.   Although a certain amount of your training will definitely
be focused on crosswind technique, it is a bit much for an early hour
student to be dealing with right from the 'get-go'.  At RHV, more often than
not,  most of our training days have a wind coming pretty much straight down
the runway most of the time and when it comes to crosswind practice we can
always head off to a nearby airport and get plenty of that when you are
ready.

Anyway, hope you will check our airport out as I think you'll find the
advantages far outweigh those of the airport you are currently considering.

I just wanted to add (forgot to do so in my first reply post to you) that
'ground' or 'home study' for the written exam, et al, is more determined by
'you'.   I mean to say that if you aren't one of those people who can
dedicate themselves to a course of study and prefer to study in group
settings then home study may not be for you.  If you're like me, you welcome
the new learning and have no problem setting aside the time to study (after
all you're getting to learn about something you've likely been wanting to do
as long as you can remember - how cool is that!?).

Everyone is likely to have their own preference regarding home study
materials but it is my opinion that nothing beats the King Schools written
test courses (as well as some of their other training materials) for
teaching you in a manner that you will remember and retain.  I've tried
others, Sportys, etc.. but (for me) nothing has worked for me (in terms of
studying for the written exam) like the King Schools materials have.

Now having said the latter, keep in-mind that you'll want some books to
study with.  Although the instructor you choose may have a preference on the
text book you use, there is nothing that says that you can have (within
reason &lt;grin&gt;) too many books that you are reading.  Although it is not
'perfect' I have become a big fan of the Rod Machado Private Pilot book and
would strongly recommend that you purchase it with his workbook to further
supplement your learning.  I like his book, in that it is well-illustrated
and will give you a very well-rounded study book, overall.   The only thing
I slight it for, in parts, is he'll stick with one or two analogies too long
when I feel he could transition the student to the concept at that point.  A
good example is his water analogy of electrical current and devices; it
works and is a good idea initially, I just would prefer he gradually
transition the student from that water analogy and move forward on the
subject from there.  There are just a few other items like that, but all
certainly minor concerns with this very 'chock-full' of information training
resource.   The Jeppesen texts are also quite good as well.

Anyway, hope this helps and you've come to the right newsgroup as there is a
bunch of people who love to fly and enjoy helping someone achieve their
dream of flight.  I've been with this group from my early student
instruction and all the way through my CFI.

Hi Dado,

I don't know anything about Oakland Flyers personally, but here are
some of my thoughts based on looking at their Web site:
- The rates are really good.  I'm paying $95/hour plus a $6/hour fuel
surcharge at my club for the same type of plane that rents for $75/hour
at Oakland Flyers.  However, I don't see any mention of whether the
rates are "wet" or "dry".  "Wet" rates include fuel and "dry" rates
don't.  Obviously wet rates (like what I'm paying) are more expensive
than dry rates.  Find out if their rates are wet or dry.
- The Web site doesn't state that they offer liability insurance for
their renters.  Some clubs (mine include) provide this for their
members.  if Oakland Flyers doesn't provide this, then that will be an
added expense.
- I like that Oakland Flyers has a "pay as you go" plan.  Personally, I
wouldn't lock myself into something where I had to pay a whole bunch of
money up front.  I also like that they give you a discount for paying
$500 up front.  I tended to do that anyway with my instructor, and I
wish he had given me a 10% discount for that. :^)
- They've got an on-line scheduling system -- that's a plus.  Actually,
I take that back -- that's a requirement in this day and age.
- Don't believe the cost estimates that they give you.  Actually -
don't believe any of the cost estimates that clubs provide on the Web.
It will most likely take you more than 40 hours dual and 10 hour solo
to learn how to fly (in my case, it took around 120 hours dual and 25
hours solo, but it probably took me longer than average).   Also, it
looks  like some of the numbers they have there are out of date.  For
example, I spent $110 (not $85) on my last medical exam and $80 (not
$75) for the written exam.

The best way to pick a club is to go to the airport, talk to the people
there, take an introductory flight, and look at the aircraft they have
to offer.    Look to see if they're well maintained.  I think the most
important thing to look for in a club is good maintenance.  If they
don't maintain their aircraft well, then there's no point in flying
them.  A club is really just the people that run the club and the
planes that you fly, so if you like both, then I should think it will
work out.

Now I'm going to plug my own club . . . :^)  Take a look at West Valley
Flying Club ( www.wvfc.org ).  They operate out of the San Carlos, Palo
Alto, Hayward, and South County airports.  They're a bit farther away
from San Francisco than Oakland, but not as far as San Jose, although
we do get lots of the crosswinds and fog that Cecil mentions (nothing
like trying to learn how to land a plane with a 10-knot crosswind
blowing).  :^)

-- Bryan

(P.S.  If you do end up in San Carlos and/or at West Valley, give me a
holler).

I have flown with them a couple times. They are okay in my book, but like all
these outfits some instructors are better than others. Most of them do not
stay for long.

There was a guy, operates out of a trailer at the north end of the field, I
can't remember his name right now, but he is older than dirt and he has a
couple planes. Very picky about his students and his instructors. You might
ask around there.

Lou Fields, CFII at the Old T's on North Field -- a nice guy, an
aquaintance of mine at Oakland (I used to rent his lovely old 1966 Arrow
every now and then -- the checkride he did with me before he let me rent
it was both amusing and instructive -- he's a fund of good stories, but
he's also sharp as hell while instructing). He used to fly off carriers
in the Pacific during WWII, and was a DE until a few years ago -- in
fact he was going to be the DE for my instrument rating but was ill so I
ended up with Rich Bachelder, another, erm, character who I rather like.
But unfortunately he's basically sold pretty much all his own aircraft
and given up on instructing as far as I can tell.

I'd agree with Mr Campbell on Oakland Flyers -- not bad overall, and if
you can get a good instructor (I can recommend one in particular),
pretty good. I fly mostly with California Airways at Hayward nowadays,
and I recommend them with the usual caveats about getting a good
instructor, but that's probably pushing it for you from San Francisco.

Heh, Bachelder gave me my instrument check. Yeah, Lou is the guy I was

quit, but not surprised.

Rich Bachelder is the only guy I know who ever stabbed a student.
Deliberately, anyway.

I'll let Mr Campbell give you that one... Bachelder's the source of or
subject of a great many stories, and is something of a character (he was
once in the Navy, then a cop in Berkeley, and he has, erm, lots of
strong opinions -- but I got on with him quite well).

On my own instrument checkride with him I actually got into an argument
with him while under the hood: he asked me to do something dumb with the
GPS and I blurted out something along the lines of "you can't do that!
It just doesn't work that way!". He persisted for a while while I
struggled to maintain the hold (or whatever) under the hood over the
Sacramento Delta somewhere near Rio Vista and attempted to explain why
with this particular unit it wouldn't work, and I finally just told him
we'd do it my way or we'd either still be in the hold in an hour's time
arguing over it or we'd be somewhere out over the Pacific when I'd
proved him wrong and would never see dry land again. He was quite
gracious about it and spent much of the rest of the flight kidding me
about it and asking me questions about why we Brits and Aussies
pronounced things the way we did (I have what to US ears is a strong
British accent) or why we called autopilots "George" and that sort of
thing. A stressful but ultimately oddly enjoyable checkride.

Argh. It wasn't Batchelder. It was RJ Jones, if anything even more colorful
than Batchelder. The candidate was on his third try at an instrument rating,
and Jones told him he had failed again -- just turn around and head back. But
instead the guy nosed the plane over and headed straight for the ground.
Jones had to stab him in the arm with a pen in order to regain control of the
plane.

I am told also that RJ Jones was examining another student's log book when he
noticed that the student had logged time in several planes, including Jones'
twin Cessna. He asked the student how he liked the plane and how it flew. The
student bragged all about it until Jones told him who the owner was and why
the student would not be taking his check ride that day.

Lou Fields, by the way, is still listed as a pilot examiner on the FAA web
site.

Well, if there ever was a situation warranting a stabbing I guess this would
have to be it. That musta been scary as hell.

I'll bet that he stopped instructing because the insurance prices had become
prohibitive, because of his age.

I think that was a large part of it, especially since he did aerobatics
instruction in a nice little Pitts as well as all the rest. But as far
as I know it wasn't *his* age, it was the age of his planes -- and the
students -- that did it. I got the impression he didn't want to have to
spend a lot of time making enough money to pay the insurance (which he
probably could easily have), so the planes got sold. The Pitts was sold
to a friend of mine, the Arrow went to a distant aquaintance, and he now
flies a little Aeronca he calls the "Thunderchicken". Not sure about the
rest...

I have sold both my planes and moved away years ago. Maybe in another six or

My PPL checkride was also with Batchelder. Interestingly my CFI told me
that he avoids sending his more "temperamental" students to Batchelder.
:) During my checkride he was quite nice except on one occasion when he
pretty much told me that I was an idiot for slipping instead of using
flaps to lose altitude. In this situation he was actually right and I
think he is deliberately grumpy from time to time probably as a tactic
to put more pressure on the applicant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On my own instrument checkride with him I actually got into an argument
&gt; with him while under the hood: he asked me to do something dumb with the
&gt; GPS and I blurted out something along the lines of &quot;you can't do that!
&gt; It just doesn't work that way!&quot;. He persisted for a while while I
&gt; struggled to maintain the hold (or whatever) under the hood over the
&gt; Sacramento Delta somewhere near Rio Vista and attempted to explain why
&gt; with this particular unit it wouldn't work, and I finally just told him
&gt; we'd do it my way or we'd either still be in the hold in an hour's time
&gt; arguing over it or we'd be somewhere out over the Pacific when I'd
&gt; proved him wrong and would never see dry land again. He was quite
&gt; gracious about it and spent much of the rest of the flight kidding me
&gt; about it and asking me questions about why we Brits and Aussies
&gt; pronounced things the way we did (I have what to US ears is a strong
&gt; British accent) or why we called autopilots &quot;George&quot; and that sort of
&gt; thing. A stressful but ultimately oddly enjoyable checkride.

Dado,
You might also consider flying out of Concord (CCR), which is about 35
miles north east of SF. I liked it because the airport itself is very
challenging and fun to taxi around with its 2 sets of intersecting
runways. Another benefit is that even on windy days, you can always
find a favorable runway with not much crosswind and you can usually
learn to tackle strong crosswinds by requesting other runways.
I personally know many good instructors in CCR and will be happy to
pass along the info if you need it. Good luck,

-Girish

&gt; Hi everyone, I'm new here.
&gt; I live in San Francisco, California.
&gt; A couple of days ago I've watched that documentary on Van Nuys Airport.
&gt; That was enough to get that old itch going again. I need to get my
&gt; license.
&gt; Right now I'm still finding what to look for when searching for a
&gt; school, instructor, etc.
&gt; I have a gazillion of questions, but since it's past my bed time, I'll
&gt; ask only one.
&gt; Does anyone know &quot;Oakland Flyers&quot; ?
&gt; http://www.oaklandflyers.com
&gt; Is it a case of &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;?
&gt; Any comments on Oakland Flyers would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; Well, any tips on how to go about this selection process, home vs.
&gt; ground school study, independent instructor vs. school. Any
&gt; recomendation. Anything would help.

&gt; Thanks a lot.
&gt; Dado Feigenblatt

&gt; PS: just browsing some earlier posts I already learned quite a bit.
&gt; I'll stick around. Hopefully one day I'll be posting some answers.
