Does anyone out there know where I could locate special brass pulls for a
thread chest? What I am looking for is a drop pull in the shape of a
horizontal oval with the initials ONT on the drop. In the background behind
the letters there is a sort of mesh pattern. The pulls also have a
backplate in the shape of a horizontally elongated octagon - also with a
mest patten on it. The drops are installed by means of a shaft which is
inserted through the back plate and then through the front of the drawer.
They are held in place by means of a wedge pushed through a slit in the
shaft. The measurements of the pull are: 1 1/12&quot; wide. 1 5/8&quot; from top of
backplate to bottom of oval drop. HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Sincerely, any help
would be appreciated.

With ONT on the pull - you will have to scavenge them from
another chest, if you can find one. These were custom made for
the company.
