Hi Forum.

I guess I am going to tell my life story, or hope people hear me out.
I am very depressed and don't know how I feel or what to expect
anymore.

I have never been happy with my teeth appearance as when I was at
school I used to get bullied for having protruding front teeth. Also I
am of oriental race, so some people found it funny.

I had braces when I was 18 and had them for 18 months. But after
having braces I was still bullied at College, students would still
comment that I had protruding teeth and make horrible comments like
&quot;Goofy teeth &quot;.

I couldn't stand it any longer so I had my original teeth replaced to
crowns to make them less prominant. However, I still didn't like the
appearance. They looked bulky and stood out.
When I was 24 I went to a dentist who said he could help me fix my
teeth but it would take 4 years. I needed to correct my lower jaw as
he said it was too big, and undertook surgery. I had braces for over 2
years again to line up my back teeth.

Okay, so 4 years is over and the last 2 weeks was my final phrase, the
last steps to correcting my teeth and getting a better appearance. He
replaced 5 crowns on my top front teeth. He said everything was done.
It was very very expensive and I had to work very hard to finance for
it.

However, the last week I have been feeling very self conscious. I can
still see that my front teeth protrude and hit towards the lip. I have
a strange looking smile and my front 2 teeth look too forward. My
dentist ensures me that they are at the correct position and do not
protrude.

I noticed the original tooth post ( remains of the original tooth)
were quite forward, so my assumption is  anything put over it will
protrude. But my dentist does not agree on this.

I have asked friends and family for their opinions and they all say
they do not protrude. I am so worried that I will get picked on for
being Goofy again and have felt very self conscious the last week. I
have been dreading the mirror and looking at pictures I taken have
just made me more confused and depressed. I don't know what to think
anymore, or I wanted was a normal smile without feeling wary of people
commenting on them. I do not need them to be perfect but do not like
to have the protrusive image in me forever.

Here is a link to my pictures of my teeth. http://s242.photobucket.com/albums/ff24/lostinreality28/

Please let me know what you think.  I am seriously going crazy over
them as I think he has done a bad job as I have no self confidence
over them.

I know my friends and family are being supportive but I don't know who
to beleive anymore...

I wish I could accept for how they look, but I get easily depressed,
incase I get bullied again.

Any opinions and advice from dentists would be very grateful.

Thankyou for reading. Rio

Too perfect teeth look like false teeth.  Be happy that you don't look like
a cow catcher on a steam locomotive.

It sure sounds like you will never be happy until you get (false teeth
looking) teeth.

Maybe you should spend any spare money on fixing your face.

Thanx for the reply. Yes you talk alot of sense and I appreciate that.
My head is messed up because of past events and find it hard to move
on. But your right, nobody ever wants fake teeth, when they have a set
of real ones. I guess I'm just self conscious that's all. I won't be
spending anymore money on dental work thats for sure.
Fixing my face? Yes if I had any more spare money I would lol...j/k

Cheers mate

WHAT ?????

Get real man!

Your race is fine.  You are part of a great and noble race.  Be proud of it.
I was at a 40th Birthday party Saturday night with two Koreans, one
Japanese, one Chinese, two blonds, eight Indians, and my wife and me
(Italians).  It was great.  Everyone was proud of their heritage and
appearance.  And, we all made fun of each other's accents and nationalities
from time to time.  I was not upset that, they did not appreciate my
rendition of &quot;O Sole Mio&quot; at all.  :-)   It did slow down the criticisms of
Pavarotti's last marriage.

People of Asian races tend to have slightly different shaped front teeth.
This is normal and looks proper.  Sounds to me like you hung around with
some rather shallow people in your youth.  You don't need a make-over, you
need to get new friends!

The images you posted make your smile look very Caucasian.  If that was your
goal, you have more than succeeded.

If this really bothers you that much, you should perhaps seek the help of a
therapist for a few weeks.

Wot, no Jews?  There has to be a joke in there somewhere.
Do you remember the comic Johnny Yune?  Korean guy with great,
self-effacing schtick.  Was on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson many
times, and always cracked me up--maybe 25 years or so ago.  He'd do this
fish out-of-water routine, and then sang a song--usually in Yiddish--in
a beautiful baritone.  Good stuff.

... Last night my husband and I had dinner at a local spot with an
unusual variety of patrons!  Some of us sat in chairs, others lounged
picnic style on the patio decking around the bistro tables.  Some were
dressed in bedazzled tee-shirts (no pants and no shoes and they still
let them in), one tall-ish brunette female wore nothing more than a
beautiful &quot;diamond&quot; necklace.  And there was a striking fellow named
Jack whose family admits that he was homeless for a period of time; but
he has a solid homelife now...  Jack just couldn't take his eyes off
this cute little redhead wearing a flashy little royal blue summer
sweatshirt and a pink scarf around her neck a couple tables away; but,
she didn't seem to even notice poor Jack.  She was just enjoying her
five course dinner with the couple she brought with her.  And as for our
table, there were six of us... four preferred chairs and two preferred
the little faux fur lounge bed next to the table; their five course meal
also served picnic style.  It was the italians who preferred the picnic
style dining ... and as the evening wore on and the breeze turned a bit
chilly, they dressed in lovely sweaters; one pink and one blue.  Their
dessert truffles were the hit of their dinner, I think!  All in all, the
dinner went to the dogs...

No, we weren't at some wild Las Vegas club... we were at a fund raiser
to benefit the SPCA ... it was a an evening unlike most... Who were
those characters?  Well, the italians were our family members (our
grand-dogs)...

Italian Greyhounds http://www.italian-greyhound.net/ ,

the tall brunette?... a charming Doberman who was one of several &quot;like
her&quot; ... all beautiful and charming but the only one in that particular
necklace ...

... and Jack, a Nova Scotia Duck Toller-Retriever
http://www.nsdtrc-usa.org/photo_gallery1.htm

The girl who paid no attention to Jack? ... a smallish golden retriever
who seemed unconcerned with anything and everybody... I wouldn't think
anyone would accuse her of being nosey or the gossiping type ;-)

And there were many other canines of various &quot;ethnicities&quot; ... and I
must say **everyone** looked uniquely themselves and **everyone** got
along just fine!!!  (BTW, Three Dog Bakery put on the event.  They host
one 3-4 times a year.  There were four seatings for this event
yesterday.  So, it was a big success.)

And as for my Buddy, the Finnish Lapphund... I didn't plan ahead to take
him but he would have had a great time too.

&gt;&gt; Steve

&gt; ... Last night my husband and I had dinner at a local spot with an
&gt; unusual variety of patrons!  Some of us sat in chairs, others lounged
&gt; picnic style on the patio decking around the bistro tables.  Some were
&gt; dressed in bedazzled tee-shirts (no pants and no shoes and they still
&gt; let them in), one tall-ish brunette female wore nothing more than a
&gt; beautiful &quot;diamond&quot; necklace.  And there was a striking fellow named
&gt; Jack whose family admits that he was homeless for a period of time; but
&gt; he has a solid homelife now...  Jack just couldn't take his eyes off
&gt; this cute little redhead wearing a flashy little royal blue summer
&gt; sweatshirt and a pink scarf around her neck a couple tables away; but,
&gt; she didn't seem to even notice poor Jack.  She was just enjoying her
&gt; five course dinner with the couple she brought with her.  And as for our
&gt; table, there were six of us... four preferred chairs and two preferred
&gt; the little faux fur lounge bed next to the table; their five course meal
&gt; also served picnic style.  It was the italians who preferred the picnic
&gt; style dining ... and as the evening wore on and the breeze turned a bit
&gt; chilly, they dressed in lovely sweaters; one pink and one blue.  Their
&gt; dessert truffles were the hit of their dinner, I think!  All in all, the
&gt; dinner went to the dogs...

&gt; No, we weren't at some wild Las Vegas club... we were at a fund raiser
&gt; to benefit the SPCA ... it was a an evening unlike most... Who were
&gt; those characters?  Well, the italians were our family members (our
&gt; grand-dogs)...

&gt; Italian Greyhounds http://www.italian-greyhound.net/ ,

&gt; the tall brunette?... a charming Doberman who was one of several &quot;like
&gt; her&quot; ... all beautiful and charming but the only one in that particular
&gt; necklace ...

&gt; ... and Jack, a Nova Scotia Duck Toller-Retriever
&gt; http://www.nsdtrc-usa.org/photo_gallery1.htm

&gt; The girl who paid no attention to Jack? ... a smallish golden retriever
&gt; who seemed unconcerned with anything and everybody... I wouldn't think
&gt; anyone would accuse her of being nosey or the gossiping type ;-)

&gt; And there were many other canines of various &quot;ethnicities&quot; ... and I
&gt; must say **everyone** looked uniquely themselves and **everyone** got
&gt; along just fine!!!  (BTW, Three Dog Bakery put on the event.  They host
&gt; one 3-4 times a year.  There were four seatings for this event
&gt; yesterday.  So, it was a big success.)

&gt; And as for my Buddy, the Finnish Lapphund... I didn't plan ahead to take
&gt; him but he would have had a great time too.

&gt; http://www.foresttrail.com/ourfemales.html (Buddy looks most like
&gt; Sunset in coloring).

&gt; Webby ;-)

&gt;&gt;   Everyone was proud of their heritage and
&gt;&gt; &gt; appearance.  And, we all made fun of each other's accents and
&gt;&gt; &gt; nationalities
&gt;&gt; &gt; from time to time.  I was not upset that, they did not appreciate my
&gt;&gt; &gt; rendition of &quot;O Sole Mio&quot; at all.  :-)   It did slow down the
&gt;&gt; &gt; criticisms of
&gt;&gt; &gt; Pavarotti's last marriage.

&gt;&gt; &gt; People of Asian races tend to have slightly different shaped front
&gt;&gt; &gt; teeth.
&gt;&gt; &gt; This is normal and looks proper.  Sounds to me like you hung around
&gt;&gt; &gt; with
&gt;&gt; &gt; some rather shallow people in your youth.  You don't need a make-over,
&gt;&gt; &gt; you
&gt;&gt; &gt; need to get new friends!

&gt;&gt; &gt; The images you posted make your smile look very Caucasian.  If that was
&gt;&gt; &gt; your
&gt;&gt; &gt; goal, you have more than succeeded.

&gt;&gt; &gt; If this really bothers you that much, you should perhaps seek the help
&gt;&gt; &gt; of a

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Your race is fine.  You are part of a great and noble race.  Be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; proud
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I was at a 40th Birthday party Saturday night with two Koreans, one
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Japanese, one Chinese, two blonds, eight Indians, and my wife and me
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (Italians).  It was great.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Wot, no Jews?  There has to be a joke in there somewhere.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you remember the comic Johnny Yune?  Korean guy with great,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; self-effacing schtick.  Was on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; many
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; times, and always cracked me up--maybe 25 years or so ago.  He'd do
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fish out-of-water routine, and then sang a song--usually in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yiddish--in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a beautiful baritone.  Good stuff.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Steve

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ... Last night my husband and I had dinner at a local spot with an
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unusual variety of patrons!  Some of us sat in chairs, others lounged
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; picnic style on the patio decking around the bistro tables.  Some were
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dressed in bedazzled tee-shirts (no pants and no shoes and they still
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; let them in), one tall-ish brunette female wore nothing more than a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; beautiful &quot;diamond&quot; necklace.  And there was a striking fellow named
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jack whose family admits that he was homeless for a period of time; but
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; he has a solid homelife now...  Jack just couldn't take his eyes off
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; this cute little redhead wearing a flashy little royal blue summer
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sweatshirt and a pink scarf around her neck a couple tables away; but,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; she didn't seem to even notice poor Jack.  She was just enjoying her
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; five course dinner with the couple she brought with her.  And as for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; our
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; table, there were six of us... four preferred chairs and two preferred
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the little faux fur lounge bed next to the table; their five course
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meal
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; also served picnic style.  It was the italians who preferred the picnic
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; style dining ... and as the evening wore on and the breeze turned a bit
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; chilly, they dressed in lovely sweaters; one pink and one blue.  Their
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dessert truffles were the hit of their dinner, I think!  All in all,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dinner went to the dogs...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No, we weren't at some wild Las Vegas club... we were at a fund raiser
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to benefit the SPCA ... it was a an evening unlike most... Who were
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; those characters?  Well, the italians were our family members (our
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; grand-dogs)...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Italian Greyhounds http://www.italian-greyhound.net/ ,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the tall brunette?... a charming Doberman who was one of several &quot;like
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; her&quot; ... all beautiful and charming but the only one in that particular
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; necklace ...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ... and Jack, a Nova Scotia Duck Toller-Retriever
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.nsdtrc-usa.org/photo_gallery1.htm

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The girl who paid no attention to Jack? ... a smallish golden retriever
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; who seemed unconcerned with anything and everybody... I wouldn't think
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; anyone would accuse her of being nosey or the gossiping type ;-)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; And there were many other canines of various &quot;ethnicities&quot; ... and I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; must say **everyone** looked uniquely themselves and **everyone** got
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; along just fine!!!  (BTW, Three Dog Bakery put on the event.  They host
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one 3-4 times a year.  There were four seatings for this event
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; yesterday.  So, it was a big success.)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; And as for my Buddy, the Finnish Lapphund... I didn't plan ahead to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; take
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; him but he would have had a great time too.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.foresttrail.com/ourfemales.html (Buddy looks most like
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sunset in coloring).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Webby ;-)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   Everyone was proud of their heritage and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; appearance.  And, we all made fun of each other's accents and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; nationalities
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; from time to time.  I was not upset that, they did not appreciate my
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rendition of &quot;O Sole Mio&quot; at all.  :-)   It did slow down the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; criticisms of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Pavarotti's last marriage.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; People of Asian races tend to have slightly different shaped front
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; teeth.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This is normal and looks proper.  Sounds to me like you hung around
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some rather shallow people in your youth.  You don't need a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; make-over,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; need to get new friends!

It's nearly impossible for a dog to pretend to be a Whippet.  A phone
and some height measurements would help a lot!  As you know, the Whippet
looks so much like an IG that it's hard to tell the difference without
some size reference.

I really thought Newbie was pulling my leg ... hahaha.  (He's pretty
good at doing that, as we know!)

Okie Dokie.  The jury needs a few more pics and may wish a few
measurements (height, chest).  Obviously, Jakk has sight hound features.
Those legs and paws are incredible!!  What a cutie!!  If you want to
send some other pictures into smd, there may be some others interested
in Jakk's appearance.  If you just want to send them to me, you know how
to do that.  If you have a pic standing, sitting forward facing and/or
sideways and anything in motion... send away!!!!!!!  :-)

&gt; &gt;Webby

&gt; These pix are from 2005 and Jakk has more musculature and
&gt; a deeper chest now. But, based on the AKC descriptions he must
&gt; be mixed with something else cuz his nose is pinkish not black,
&gt; and the chest may not be deep enough.

&gt; Will try to get some better pix.

&gt; My guess is a regular grey and a beagle or
&gt; an italian with a larger dog.

&gt; Picture in motion ? You are kidding right ?

&gt; This dog can run/play all day, prolonged distance
&gt; running ~25-30mph and sprints up to 45 mph.
&gt; Has no trouble keeping up with the four wheelers.

The &quot;jury&quot; now says with a grin, &quot;could be a whippet mix!&quot;  That boy can
run!!!  To get a picture of him in motion, you better get out your very
best camera.  I guess the one of him sleeping represents a rare photo
op.  ;-)
