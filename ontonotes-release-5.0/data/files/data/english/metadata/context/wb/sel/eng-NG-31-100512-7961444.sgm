I don't know but with manual transmission you can reach higher speeds
than automatic but is the mileage better condsidering the high price
of gas now?

The Si Only comes in a Manual Tranny, so there is nothing to compare it to.
As for mileage, the Si is not built for mileage.  I average about 25-27 in
mixed driving, and can get about 32 on the highway.

Si is for people who want fun.
For gas misers there is prius and similar shitboxes.

I have a 2007 Prius shitbox, and I love it.

I also have a 2006 Accord and a 2005 Pilot.  But I am averaging 55mpg for my
commuting.

There was a segment on Good Morning America yesterday.  There is a group of
guys in (IIRC) So Cal that have competitions for best mileage.  They break
a number of safety rules to get there, of course, and probably cost
themselves more in tires and such than they save in gas, but it was at
least interesting...

&gt; Well, its design does allow strange driving techniques to get good
&gt; mileage.

&gt; What's most interesting is that its design allows NORMAL people driving
&gt; NORMALLY using the SAME driving methods they've always used, to realize
&gt; huge gains in gas mileage.
">

what is normal for me is the gas pedal to the floor.
car mags took prius to the track on a few occasions
and got mileage in teens. what i'm trying to tell is that
on a twisty switchback unclogged with other drivers you'd get shitty
mileage IF you like spirited driving and IF you can stand doing such a
thing in prius. but, if you did, you would not have bought a prius. to
each it's own.
si is built for people who like to drive as opposed
to vegetate in the rush hour traffic.
'nuff said.

okay, i'll bite. you mean what you really wanted a a DX/LX/EX
but bought a properly geared car instead and have the buyer's
remorse at the gas station? Sell your SI and buy a civic
with relaxed gearing or something else if you hate the company, but
make no mistake about it:
you WILL know exactly what you are missing.
along with the relaxed gearing on lesser civic comes
mushroom suspension, slightly lesser engine and the list
goes on.

i, for one, having bought 2005 outback sport absolutely
positively hate now all the shitboxes with the
relaxed gearing and would do everything i can
to prevent the bastardization of the gearing ratios
on the cars that currently have them right.

i think if Honda were to make the gearing taller
the car magazines would notice it and prospective si
drives would have the sense to leave in droves.

i would not mind the car getting lighter but i assume
it's expensive to do and i don't expect civics to become
any lighter. if anything it's simpler to drop si
powertrain into fit and change the cladding for
a &quot;sporty&quot; look (remove 3 doors is considered to make
a car sporty??? for some idiots i guess.)

Prius?!

No Prius! '05 Scion tC (wish I'd bought the Si, but 3-4 months was too
long to wait...) and an '88 Supra, with a Direct Connection to the Gulf
station's tanks downtown!  ;)

The tC is rated at 165 HP. The Si is a shade less than 200. I can't even
*imagine* it! Whoooo-Hooooo! But I like the seating position in the Si a
*LOT* better than the tC.

Next time...
