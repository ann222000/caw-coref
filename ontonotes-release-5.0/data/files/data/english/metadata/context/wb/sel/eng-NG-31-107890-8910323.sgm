I will not reply to the following type of request from my web site
www.ppinyot.com .  I figure no reply is better than a flame reply.

Hello,

I am looking for a console radio from 30-40's in great shape. If it is In
need of refinishing that's ok as long as the cabinet's wood is intact.

The radio itself does not need to work and at the age these are I would not
recommend trying to plug in an unrestored radio for safety.

I am flexible on makes, but cabinet must have enough room in it for new
equipment, no table tops or tombstones please.

I will admit to being biased towards Zenith units such as the following
images show but would consider all. Can't have legs though.

We are located in Apex, NC.

Thank you for your time.

I couldn't believe there would be a North Carolina town named after a

Diplomacy is the art of telling someone to go to hell so nicely that they
look forward to the trip.

I find a very interesting sentiment here -- and it's interesting because I
subscribe to a mailing list for Thunderbird owners, and I see the same
thing.  There's an unwritten rule that says you can never, never, ever, mess
with stock.

In the case of the car hobby, plenty of cars get chopped, lowered,
muscled-out, and customized, or maybe even made into a street rod.  It's a
hobby.  However you just don't do that to a Thunderbird!  A T-Bird has to
look like a T-Bird, no matter what, and to alter it in any way is verboten.
In reality, Ford messed with a few of these on their own.  One such vehicle,
the Italien, has just been totally restored by a friend I chat with.  It is
a 63 Thunderbird that has actually been made into a fastback, with lots of
various touches all over the car that would make you react and say, &quot;THAT
isn't concours!&quot;  (Uh, yes it is.)  Another such vehicle is the Palomino,
which was a 64 that Ford made numerous changes to.  So this muddies the
waters as to what is concours and what is not.

Now -- suppose you see a car that has been chopped and customized.  You can
bet on one thing -- this person did NOT take a fully-perfect 49 Mercury and
screw it up.  No, more than likely he found a worn-out clunker with a
straight body, and began modifying the body and installing other components
into it.  We're talking about a car that would otherwise have been crushed.
At first glance, a newcomer might consider such custom jobs a sacriledge,
but after awhile you come to realize what it is, and you begin appreciating
the work that went into it.

With radios it's the same way.  I guarantee you I would be highly p***ed if
someone were to take my Zenith console, remove the chassis, and install in
its place some modern Wal-Mart component stereo.  Then again, if somebody
wants to put a modern stereo into an old cabinet, that's his perogative.
One thing's certain, he likes the style of that cabinet.

If you recall about a year ago, Mark posted a photo of a console cabinet in
a bonfire.  It was pitched because the radio was too far gone, and there was
nothing worth salvaging.  Could this guy have used that cabinet?

I see no problem with turning a piece of junk into a piece of art.

Actually, there really is an Apex, NC and it's just down the road from
me.  Knowing the town, I'd say that it pre-dates the Chinese electronics
maker by a hundred years or so.

It is the loss of a state of the art for that era that gets me.  Would you
take a Stanley Steamer car and put a bigger internal comustion engine in it
or convert a steam powered locomotive to disel electic?  Probably not.  You
would loose the mystique and the steam state of the art at that time.

This is what get me in the chest is realizing a tube chassis is to be
discarded and replaced with a different generation of technology.
