Greenspan Misses Cheneys Memo: Spills the Beans on Oil By Ray
McGovern

09/16/07 &quot;ICH&quot; -- -- For those still wondering why      President
George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney sent our      young
men and women into Iraq, the secret is now largely out.

No, not from the lips of former secretary of state Colin      Powell.
It appears we shall have to wait until the disgraced      general/diplomat
draws nearer to meeting his maker before he      gets concerned
over anything more than the blot that Iraq has      put on his
reputation.

Rather, the uncommon candor comes from a highly respected      Republican
doyen, economist Alan Greenspan, chairman of the      Federal Reserve
from 1987 to 2006, whom the president has      praised for his wise
policies and prudent judgment.  Sadly for      Bush and Cheney,
Greenspan decided to put prudence aside in his      new book, The
Age of Turbulence, and answer the most      neuralgic issue of our
timeswhy the United States invaded Iraq.

Greenspan writes:
">

I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to      acknowledge
what everyone knows:  the Iraq war is largely about      oil.

Everyone knows?  Would that it were so.  But its hardly      everyone.
Sometimes I think its hardly anyone.

There are so many, still, who cant handle the truth, and that      is
all too understandable.  I have found it a wrenching      experience
to be forced to conclude that the America I love      would
deliberately launch what the Nuremburg Tribunal called the      supreme
international crimea war of aggressionlargely for      oil.  For
those who are able to overcome the very common,      instinctive
denial, for those who can handle the truth, it      really helps
to turn off the Sunday football games early enough      to catch
up on whats going on.

60 Minutes

On January 11, 2004, viewers of CBS 60 Minutes      saw another of
Bushs senior economic advisers, former treasury      secretary Paul
ONeill discussing The Price of Loyalty,      his memoir about his
two years inside the Bush administration.       ONeill, a plain
speaker, likened the presidents behavior at      cabinet meetings
to that of a blind man in a roomful of deaf      people.  How does
he manage?  Cheney and a praetorian guard      that encircled the
president help Bush make decisions off-line,      blocking contrary
views.

Cheney has a Rumsfeldian knack for aphorisms that dont parse in
the real world like deficits dont matter.  To his credit,      ONeill
picked a fight with that and ended up being fired      personally
by Cheney.  In his book, Greenspan heaps scorn on      that same
Cheneyesque insight.

ONeill made no bones about his befuddlement over the      presidents
diffident disengagement from discussions on      policyexcept, that
is, for Bushs remarks betraying a      pep-rally-cheerleader fixation
with removing Saddam Hussein and      occupying Iraq.

Why Iraq? Largely Oil

ONeill began to understand better after Bushs      inauguration
when the discussion among his top advisers abruptly      moved to
how to divvy up Iraqs oil wealth.  Just days into the      job,
President Bush created the Cheney energy task force with      the
stated aim of developing a national energy policy designed      to
help the private sector.  Typically, Cheney has been able to      keep
secret its deliberations and even the names of its members.

But a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit forced the Commerce
Department to turn over task force documents, including a map of
Iraqi oilfields, pipelines, refineries, terminals, and potential
areas for exploration; a Pentagon chart Foreign Suitors for      Iraqi
Oilfield Contracts; and another chart detailing Iraqi oil      and
gas projectsall dated March 2001.

On the 60 Minutes, program on December 15, 2002, Steve      Croft
asked then-defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, What do you      say
to people who think this [the coming invasion of Iraq] is      about
oil?  Rumsfeld replied:

Nonsense.  It just isnt.  Theretherethere are      certain.............
things like that, myths that are floating      around.  Im glad you
asked.  Iit has nothing to do with oil,      literally nothing to
do with oil.

Au Contraire

Greenspans indiscreet remark adds to the abundant      evidence
that Iraq oil, and not weapons of mass destruction, was      the
priority target long before the Bush administration invoked      WMD
as a pretext to invade Iraq.  In the heady days of Mission
Accomplished, a week after the president landed on the aircraft
carrier, then-deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz virtually
bragged about the deceit during an interview.  On May 9, 2003,
Wolfowitz told Vanity Fair:

The truth is that for reasons that have a lot to do with the      U.S.
government bureaucracy, we settled on the one issue that      everyone
could agree on, which was weapons of mass destruction      as the
core reason...

That was seven weeks after the invasion; no weapons of mass
destruction had been found; and Americans were growing tired of
being told that this was because Iraq was the size of      California.
Eventually, of course, Wolfowitz boss Rumsfeld was      forced to
concede, as he did to me during our impromptu TV      debate on May
4, 2006:  It appears that there were not weapons      of mass
destruction there.

But three years before, during that heady May of 2003 when all
else seemed to be going along swimmingly, the inebriation of
apparent success led to another glaring indiscretion by      Wolfowitz.
During a relaxed moment in Singapore late that      month, Wolfowitz
reminded the press that Iraq floats on a sea      of oil, and thus
added to the migraine he had already given      folks in the White
House PR shop.

But wait.  For those of us absorbing more than FOX channel news,
the primacy of the oil factor was a no-brainer.  The limited
number of invading troops were ordered to give priority to      securing
the oil wells and oil industry infrastructure      immediately and
let looters have their way with just about      everything else
(including the ammunition storage depots!).       Barely three weeks
into the war, Rumsfeld famously answered      criticism for not
stopping the looting: Stuff happens.  No      stuff happened to the
Oil Ministry.

Small wonder that, according to ONeill, Rumsfeld tried hard to
dissuade him from writing his book and has avoided all comment
on it.  As for Greenspans book, Rumsfeld will find it easier to
dodge questions from the Washington press corps from his      sinecure
at the Hoover Institute at Stanford.

Eminence Grise...or Oily

The other half of what Col. Larry Wilkerson, Colin      Powells
former chief of staff at the State Department, calls      the
Cheney-Rumsfeld cabal is still lurking in the shadows.       What
changed Cheneys mind toward Iraq from his sensible      attitude
after the Gulf War when, as defense secretary, he      defended
President George H. W. Bushs decision not to attempt      to oust
Saddam Hussein and conquer Iraq?  Here is what Cheney      said in
August 1992:

...how many additional American casualties is Saddam      worth?...not that damned many.  So I think we got it      right...when the president made the decision that we were not      going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to take      over and govern Iraq.

Cheneys rather transparent remarks as CEO of Halliburton in      autumn
1999 suggest what lies behind the cynical exploitation of      genuine
patriotism to recruit throwaway soldiers to trade for      the
chimera of control over the oil in Iraq:

Oil companies are expected to keep developing enough oil to      offset
oil depletion and also to meet new demand...So where is      the
oil going to come from?  Governments and the national oil      companies
are obviously in control of 90 percent of the assets.       Oil
remains fundamentally a government business.  The Middle      East
with two-thirds of the worlds oil and the lowest cost is      still
where the prize ultimately lies.

Not only Cheney, but also many of the captains of the oil      industry
were looking on Iraq with covetous eyes before the      war.  Most
people forget that the Bush/Cheney administration      came in on
the heels of severe shortages of oil and natural gas      in the
U.S., and the passing of a milestone at which the United      States
had just begun importing more than half of the oil it      consumes.
One oil executive confided to a New York Times      reporter a month
before the war: For any oil company, being in      Iraq is like
being a kid in F.A.O. Schwarz.

Canadian writer Linda McQuaig, author of It's the Crude,      Dude:
War, Big Oil, and the Fight for the Planet (2004), has      noted
that decades from now it will seem to everyone a real      no-brainer.
Historians will calmly discuss the war in Iraq and      identify
oil as one of the key factors in the decision to launch      it.
They will point to growing US dependence on foreign oil, the
competition with China, India, and others for a share of the
diminishing world supply of this precious, nonrenewable      resource,
and the fact that Iraq &quot;floats on a sea of oil.  It      will all
seem so obvious as to provoke little more than a yawn.

Other Factors Behind the Invasion

There were, to be sure, other factors behind the      ill-starred
attack on Iraqthe Bush administrations      determination to acquire
large, permanent military bases in the      area outside of Saudi
Arabia, for one.  But that factor can be      viewed as a subset
of the energy motivationthe need to have      substantial influence
over the extraction and disposition of the      oil in Iraq.  In
other words, the felt need for what the      Pentagon prefers to
call enduring military bases in the Middle      East is a function
of its strategic importance which, in turn,      is a functionyou
guessed itof its natural resources.  Not only      oil, but natural
gas and water as well.

I find the evidence persuasive that the other major factor in
the Bush/Cheney decision to make war on Iraq was the misguided
notion that this would make that part of the world safer for
Israel.  Indeed, the so-called neo-conservatives still running
U.S. policy toward the Middle East continue to have great      difficulty
distinguishing between what they perceive to be the      strategic
interests of Israel and those of the United States.       And in
my view, they show themselves extremely myopic on both      counts.

Why Are Americans Silent?

Could it be that most of us Americans remain good      Germans
because we are unwilling to recognize the moral      implications
of starting what is likely to be the first of the      resource
wars of the 21st century?; because we continue to be      comfortable
hogging far more than our share of the worlds      natural resources?;
and because we prefer to look the other way      when our leaders
tell us that aggressive war is necessary to      protect that
siren-call, our way of life, from attack by those      who are just
plain jealous?

Perhaps a clue can be found in the remarkable reaction I      received
after a lecture I gave two and a half years ago in a      very
affluent suburb of Milwaukee.  I had devoted much of my      talk
to the implications of what I consider the most important      factoid
of this century: the world is running out of oil.

Afterwards some twenty folks lingered in a small circle to ask
follow-up questions.  A persistent, elegantly dressed man, who
just would not let go, dominated the questioning:

&quot;Surely you agree that we need the oil. Then what's your      problem?
Some 1,450 killed thus far are far fewer than the toll      in
Vietnam where we lost 58,000; it's a small price to pay... a
sustainable rate to bear. What IS your problem?&quot;

I asked the man if he would feel differently if one of the      (then)
1,450 already killed were his own son.  Judging from his      abrupt,
incredulous reaction, the suggestion struck him as so      farfetched
as to be beyond his ken.  It wouldnt be my son, he      said.

And that, I believe, is a HUGE part of the problem.
