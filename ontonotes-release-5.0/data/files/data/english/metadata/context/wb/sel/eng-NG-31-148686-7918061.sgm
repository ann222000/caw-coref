THE AMERICAN LEGION LEGACY RUN

Indianapolis, Indiana to Reno, Nevada, August 19-24:  2,100 miles for the
children of our fallen heroes.

(Indianapolis, Indiana - 13 July 2007)

Good news in an email from Florida.  I knew they were good...but not this
good!  Go Pensacola American Legion Riders!!!

Email on 7/13/2007 from Mike and Tina Kirchoff from Florida, who both made
the Run to Salt Lake City in 2006.  They were among the first to register
for ALLR Reno 2007:

Bill,

Mike and I just got back from our Department of Florida convention where
Mike gave an update on the Pony Express/American Legacy Scholarship Run
during Convention.  Mark Seaman, ALR Director of Post 240 out of Pensacola
gave Mike a check for $12,000.00 that was raised during 2 Poker runs this
year in Pensacola.  Mark committed to Mike last year to raise more funds
from Florida and he sure delivered!!!

Post 240 was able to raise this $12,000 in just 2 poker runs - a great
tribute to a group who commits themselves to this program!

At this time Mike will be bringing almost $19,000.00 from the Department of
Florida to the convention in Reno.  A big change from the $2,500.00 he
brought last year!  We are still collecting and hope to have even more
$$$$!!!!

We made a tour down to Key West after convention in Orlando and just got
home today - it is really HOT here in Florida - can't wait to get up to the
Plains where it might be hot but not quite as humid!

See you in August,

Tina Kirchoff

Questions and Answers.

Question: &quot;I don't have a motorcycle.  Can I register and drive my car along
with The American Legion Legacy Run?&quot;
--Answer: No.  We do have some support vehicles, but they will travel
separately.  The American Legion Legacy Run is for motorcycles and Trikes
only.

Question: &quot;I want to enlist my friends and neighbors and get them to pledge
a few pennies for each mile.  Do you have a pledge form?&quot;
--Answer: Yes.  It is attached to this email update as an attachment.
Thanks for asking!  Many riders have asked for such a form.  It does make is
easier to ask for donations.  Tell everyone to visit our website, too, to
see why we ride for the children.

______________________________________

Many of you have asked for a personal supporter pledge signup sheet.  This
is a way for you to grab small donations, like a penny a mile, a nickel a
mile, or even a dollar a mile for the distance you log on the Legacy Run.
Local businesses, your neighbors, coworkers, and employers are all fair
game.  Let them make a significant donation to your efforts on behalf of the
Legacy Scholarship and The American Legion Legacy Run.

The Pledge Form is attached to this email in Word document format.  Here's
what it looks like:
