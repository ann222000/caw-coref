BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER
Season Three, Episode 12: &quot;Helpless&quot;
Writer: David Fury
Director: James A. Contner

And now we move into probably my favorite stretch of the season.  Re-
watching, this falling out, even temporary, and re-defining of the
relationship between Buffy and Giles feels inevitable, like that's the
only way things could have ever gone.  Not only do I totally buy Giles
as a betrayer in this situation, but I sympathize with him perhaps
more than I should.  Seeing Buffy so vulnerable is perhaps more
disturbing here than any of the series' other variations on it.  Throw
in some nice monster-movie setpieces and a great monster to go with
them, and you have a feast.  While I'm a bit worried about the damage
done to the mythology by making the Watchers so one-note, it works
beautifully for the purposes of this story.
Rating: Excellent

Season Three, Episode 13: &quot;The Zeppo&quot;
Writer: Dan Vebber
Director: James Whitmore, Jr.

This is one that I was hoping to be able to upgrade to Good, knowing
the conceit coming in.  But as Mrs. Quality commented while watching,
&quot;this is such a BAD episode!&quot;  I wouldn't go that far, but Xander
jumping around for the football is one of those moments that makes me
want to jam screws into my eyes and ears, and the rest of the early
going isn't a whole lot less painful.  His headspace is not a good
place for a viewer to be.  The much vaunted gentle mockery of the
series' conventions also falls flat until the very end, if only
because the cheap unknown spirit doesn't seem as cheap on a low-budget
show, and the Buffy/Angel exchanges are no more melodramatic than the
ones we were expected to take seriously in &quot;Amends.&quot;  The last third
of the episode (Faith's interlude is the approximate dividing point,
although a few last bits of lame stuff are afterward) remains its
redeeming feature, as it finally hits its stride along with Xander as
he works in silence (and silly music), connecting on the comedy,
character, and meta fronts.  It always leads me feeling more
appreciative of the episode as a whole, even if it's not a favorite by
any stretch of the imagination.
Rating: Decent

Season Three, Episode 14: &quot;Bad Girls&quot;
Writer: Doug Petrie
Director: Michael Lange

This is good stuff.  It has an odd vibe that threw me a bit as a first-
time viewer, since it looks and quacks like a self-contained story,
but is gradually revealed to be very much a Part I by the end.  Its
primary focus is to get the show where it needs to go with Faith and
Wilkins coming into their own as villains, and Balthazar &amp; co. prove
to be a fun (ACCEPTABLE!) diversion during the ride.  (The fiancée was
disappointed that there wasn't much detail given in the special
features about how they made that costume.)  Also, although Angel
still needs Buffy to save him as usual at the end, he and Giles both
get a chance to play at being cool action heroes.  If anyone tells you
they immediately recognized Wesley's potential to end up going where
the Buffyverse would take him, they're lying.
Rating: Good

Season Three, Episode 15: &quot;Consequences&quot;
Writer: Marti Noxon
Director: Michael Gershman

This is probably my favorite of Season Three, and probably in my top
five or ten for the series.  Even on a show like BTVS, it's rare to
see a single hour of television that hits note after note this
brilliantly, with every scene taking one in directions that are
unexpected but make perfect sense in retrospect.  The action never
lets up, and the intensity is as high as it ever gets during the
library double-crosses, Xander's evening with Faith, and her turn to
the dark side.  If I can love one thing even more intensely than
anything else, it's the first significant (well, with dialogue,
anyway) interaction between Faith and Angel.  Separately they're just
my two favorite Buffyverse characters, but together their scenes
virtually never fail to be anything short of amazing.  Spending this
quality time with Faith arguably does more to define Angel as a
character (and one worthy of a spin-off) than anything else we've seen
this year, and lets us see with the benefit of hindsight why exactly
he's going to be the one to save her from herself.
Rating: Excellent

Additional comments on S3D4: Mrs. Q. and I watched Michael Gershman's
commentary for &quot;Consequences&quot; with the help of some beer and drinking
it whenever he mentioned something about the filming being &quot;very
difficult.&quot;  Very mild hilarity ensued.

Speaking of &quot;Consequences,&quot;   I'm not sure if Oz appears in this
episode.  I feel like someone else pointed out that he doesn't.  The
fact that this character's presence or absence does not register with
me in any way makes me understand for the first time what Green is
talking about in the S4 featurette when he says that Oz never really
fit in as a main cast member, and how he wishes he could've stayed a
semi-regular.  These recap threads bear that out - how many times has
Oz even been mentioned by us discuss-ers this year outside of maybe
&quot;Amends?&quot;  (Even in B&amp;TB, the NG threads don't focus on him, and no
one seems to care enough to say much about his place in the Willow/
Xander fluke arc.)  He may get mentioned again for a few particularly
good lines in &quot;Earshot&quot; and for panicking in GD1, and that'll be about
it.  The other characters are all put front and center in S3, getting
their own important episodes and identity crises, while Oz remains
aggressively passive, a background character through and through,
apparently there only to elicit a wry smile or two from the viewer
each week.

Maybe well-adjusted characters just don't mesh with Whedonverse
shows?  The thing is, though, this isn't one of those situations where
I'm actively disinterested in a main character, as with the Rileys and
Lornes of the world.  I like Oz.  He's hard to not like.  I never mind
him being around.  Yet I notice that much of my appreciation is tied
to his relationship with Willow.  In S2, when things are new and
exciting for her, the show reflects it.  And once the writers realized
the effect that being with him would have on Willow's sense of self (I
don't see that idea expressed particularly clearly in S3, whereas it's
all over S4 from the beginning), things click again.  Thus, Oz has
far, far more memorable moments in his ten episodes of S2 or his nine
episodes of S4 than he does in twenty-two episodes of S3.  I feel sad
upon re-reaching the part of the series where we realize that he's not
going to so much as put in an appearance again.  But again, unless
you're one of the rabid fan-girls who were posting heavily on
jumptheshark.net in 1999 (the archives are a great read if you're
interested in taking a hatchet to your brain cells), if there was ever
a character the show could survive losing without missing a beat, it
was Oz.

(I really use parentheses a lot.)

Thoughts?

The problem here is that the central conflict of this episode is
totally manufactured. Xander's friends never tried to keep him out of
fights before this episode, and they never tried to do it again
afterward. So rather than flowing naturally from consistent
characterization, this episode has everyone acting out of character
just to achieve the goal of splitting Xander off from his friends for
the 44 minutes they needed to tell this particular story. It's pretty
jarring.

On its own, though, the episode does have some good moments. My
favorite is that when Xander interrupts the big melodramatic Buffy/
Angel scene, he also interrupts *their music.* Now that's quality
humor.

The problem with Oz is that he never really developed an identity of
his own outside of being Willow's boyfriend, and he was pretty much
written as the perfect boyfriend for her from the get-go. And that's
really not a lot to hang a character on (though Seth Green was one of
my favorite actors on the show). He wasn't so much a character as an
accessory to a character.

Well, Buffy has from time to time, but no, I can't recall a group

Oddly, Willow will have the same concern about being shut out of
Buffy's world a week later.

There's something else I forgot to mention before, too. The whole
&quot;Xander's role in research is to bring the donuts&quot; is another thing
that was invented for this episode alone. Back in season 2, in &quot;What's
My Line,&quot; it's *Buffy* who's useless at research and gets sent on
snack runs. Xander even makes a joke about it.

There are some big character-related inconsistencies in this episode,
and I don't think they can be waved away with the &quot;unreliable
narrator&quot; explanation.

IMO, everything in the Zeppo should be taken with a grain of salt.  It's all
exaggerated to play as how it would feel to Xander (even if he's not there)
on a day his low attention span and insecurities combine and go into
hyperdrive.  The rough outline is probably true, but the detail rather less
so.

I believe that is established in the first scene with the exaggerated
display of Xander incompetence.  (A few other things too - but that's the
big one.)  Xander certainly has limits in battle, but we've seen him acquit
himself well many times - most especially by rescuing others, including
Buffy multiple times.  The episode might have out-subtled itself here, but I
believe that's intended as a big honking clue that something isn't quite
right.  Reality shouldn't play that way.

That exaggeration is pretty constant in the episode.  My favorite example
(as I've mentioned before) is how it takes two tranquilizer shots to subdue
were-Oz, when it takes only one shot every other time in the series.

There probably was some concern expressed for Xander's safety.  (Buffy has
before and will again play that card.)  But the extent of what we see in
this episode is probably largely imagined by Xander.  Paranoid over reaction
to much milder actual statements.

So, Burt's observation that everyone acts out of character is largely
correct, I believe.  But it's not real.  It's unreality is a primary clue to
how perspective has been twisted to fit Xander's peculiarly distorted view.

I'm pretty confident that it's intentional and that we are supposed to
expect that a true picture would show everybody acting in character.
Whether one likes that sort of thing is a matter of taste.

I did upgrade it to a Good rating in November, and it has held that rating

&gt;&gt; put it) &quot;blah blah blah end of the world blah blah go get donuts&quot;
&gt;&gt; because that's in some way based in reality, but to get them
&gt;&gt; intentionally cutting him out of group activities you have to add
&gt;&gt; still another level of metaphor, and I'm not sure the episode can
&gt;&gt; support it.

&gt; There's something else I forgot to mention before, too. The whole
&gt; &quot;Xander's role in research is to bring the donuts&quot; is another thing
&gt; that was invented for this episode alone. Back in season 2, in &quot;What's
&gt; My Line,&quot; it's *Buffy* who's useless at research and gets sent on
&gt; snack runs. Xander even makes a joke about it.

&gt; There are some big character-related inconsistencies in this episode,
&gt; and I don't think they can be waved away with the &quot;unreliable
&gt; narrator&quot; explanation.
">

When I saw the episode for the first time the whole pushing Xander aside
bothered me a great deal. It did indeed not compute with what we knew. But
now it has become one of my favorite episodes. It even inspired half he name
of my first website.
Yes, it is out of character (maybe some hex produced by the Sisterhood?
-)  ) but in the end of that strange night he did things that totally
balanced out his over the top awkwardness he went through at the beginning.
He showed he was braver than the undead and he rescued Faith who in turn had
sex with him!

I'm aware of them, but his results (up to 65% willing to inflict pain) were
obtained with subjects and &quot;victims&quot; who were strangers to each other, and
for me, those 65% fail the &quot;modicum of ethics&quot; test, which is what is
disturbing about the experiments. From what we have seen of Giles
previously, I'd put him in the other 35% - after all, he's a hero in a TV
show. And of course, Buffy is obviously not a stranger.

The 65% results were also achieved with factors not present here, in
particular the experimenter giving the instructions being physically present
in the same room as the subject at the time the harm was done, and the
&quot;victim&quot; not in the same room. Milligram found that changing either of those
factors substantially reduced the %, so the psychology is more complex than
just &quot;here's an order from an authority figure, so I'll obey it&quot;. Although,
since I don't believe pre-Helpless Giles to be so weak-willed as to be in
the 65% in the first place, he'd also not be so weak-willed as to be
influenced by those factors.

BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER
Season Three, Episode 12: &quot;Helpless&quot;
Writer: David Fury
Director: James A. Contner

And now we move into probably my favorite stretch of the season.  Re-
watching, this falling out, even temporary, and re-defining of the
relationship between Buffy and Giles feels inevitable, like that's the
only way things could have ever gone.  Not only do I totally buy Giles
as a betrayer in this situation, but I sympathize with him perhaps
more than I should.  Seeing Buffy so vulnerable is perhaps more
disturbing here than any of the series' other variations on it.  Throw
in some nice monster-movie setpieces and a great monster to go with
them, and you have a feast.  While I'm a bit worried about the damage
done to the mythology by making the Watchers so one-note, it works
beautifully for the purposes of this story.
Rating: Excellent

***
I wouldn't call the watchers &quot;one note&quot; (unless, perhaps, I'm
misunderstanding what you mean by the term)--after all, there's a world of
difference between Giles, Wesley (not yet introduced by this episode of
course), Merrick, Quentin, and (by implication) the late Kendra's watcher.
The leadership (if Quentin is representative) seems to be made of
cold-blooded bastards, but in the field there does seem to be quite a range.
The main problem I have with the WC (pun intended) is that there really is
no legitimacy to their authority over Buffy (or any other individual
slayer), they just assume it and everyone goes along with the gag.  It isn't
until the middle of season 5 before Buffy points out that The Emperor Has No
Clothes.

This episode is one that I alluded to in my earlier condemnation of the
Scoobies reactions in Revelations.  Buffy's &quot;betrayal&quot; in not saying to the
others something to the effect of &quot;Angel's back, let's go stake him&quot; is
completely overshadowed by Gile's greater betrayal here.

Now, don't get me wrong, my personal condemnation here of Giles is actually
pretty mild.  After all, he was raised to be a Watcher, to follow their
rules, and when in &quot;youthful rebellion&quot; he went outside that the results
were pretty bad.  He's got a strong motivation to cling to the &quot;established
order&quot; even with the &quot;bending&quot; of the rules he'd already done in working
with Buffy.  Add that to the results of the psychological studies referenced
uptopic, and one can understand why Giles did what he did.  Understanding,
however, does not lessen it as a betrayal, though.

Fortunately, Buffy was more than up to the challenge.  I really liked her
&quot;out of the box&quot; solution to that particular vampire problem (or should I
say &quot;out of the bottle.&quot;)

Other aspects of the episode from a more &quot;critical/review&quot; type approach.
The episode was very well paced--with neither dullness nor confusing
fastness.  The acting was good too, of course, IMO, it usually is, but more
so than usual here.  Buffy's hurt and anger at Giles' betrayal came off
especially well and Kober's portrayal of Kralik was inspired.  Scared me and
I'm fearless. ;)
***

Season Three, Episode 13: &quot;The Zeppo&quot;
Writer: Dan Vebber
Director: James Whitmore, Jr.

This is one that I was hoping to be able to upgrade to Good, knowing
the conceit coming in.  But as Mrs. Quality commented while watching,
&quot;this is such a BAD episode!&quot;  I wouldn't go that far, but Xander
jumping around for the football is one of those moments that makes me
want to jam screws into my eyes and ears, and the rest of the early
going isn't a whole lot less painful.  His headspace is not a good
place for a viewer to be.  The much vaunted gentle mockery of the
series' conventions also falls flat until the very end, if only
because the cheap unknown spirit doesn't seem as cheap on a low-budget
show, and the Buffy/Angel exchanges are no more melodramatic than the
ones we were expected to take seriously in &quot;Amends.&quot;  The last third
of the episode (Faith's interlude is the approximate dividing point,
although a few last bits of lame stuff are afterward) remains its
redeeming feature, as it finally hits its stride along with Xander as
he works in silence (and silly music), connecting on the comedy,
character, and meta fronts.  It always leads me feeling more
appreciative of the episode as a whole, even if it's not a favorite by
any stretch of the imagination.
Rating: Decent

***
I've seen this called &quot;Xander's Identity Episode.&quot; Well, I have to disagree
with that assessment.  First, you've got everybody acting way out of
character.  The Xander jumping around for the football, while not strictly
contradicted as a character trait with what we've seen to date just doesn't
&quot;gel&quot; with the character for me.  Xander had been hurt before--a lot worse
than he was when they faced the demons at the start of the episode and that
didn't lead the others to decide to leave Xander out for his own good.  To
me, you just can't establish character growth and development with having
everyone acting out of character.  Not only that, but at the beginning of
the very next episode, we see Xander being intimidated again by Cordelia so
he's right back to being insecure Xander again.  If anything, the biggest
change in Xander's character was back in Amends, where he dropped a good
portion of the self-righteousness he had been carrying around at least since
Angel turned bad in S2.  Also, this episode really doesn't foretell in any
meaningfull way where Xander's &quot;identity&quot; will eventually lead him with his
love for Anya (although the baggage he's still carrying from his own family
sabotages that), a job he enjoys and is good at, etc.

One thing I did like about it was that getting a car and declaring oneself
&quot;car guy&quot; is not the same thing as actually _being_ a &quot;car guy&quot; as he learns
when he finds enthusiastic car talk--even in the mouth of a pretty girl--to
be extremely boring. OTOH, I _am_ a car guy and found the girl Xander picked
up to be quite a bit too &quot;one note&quot; for my taste.

Still and all, while, IMO, the episode did not do what it was apparently
supposed to do, it was a fun watch.  I probably agree with the &quot;decent&quot;
rating.
***

Season Three, Episode 14: &quot;Bad Girls&quot;
Writer: Doug Petrie
Director: Michael Lange

This is good stuff.  It has an odd vibe that threw me a bit as a first-
time viewer, since it looks and quacks like a self-contained story,
but is gradually revealed to be very much a Part I by the end.  Its
primary focus is to get the show where it needs to go with Faith and
Wilkins coming into their own as villains, and Balthazar &amp; co. prove
to be a fun (ACCEPTABLE!) diversion during the ride.  (The fiancée was
disappointed that there wasn't much detail given in the special
features about how they made that costume.)  Also, although Angel
still needs Buffy to save him as usual at the end, he and Giles both
get a chance to play at being cool action heroes.  If anyone tells you
they immediately recognized Wesley's potential to end up going where
the Buffyverse would take him, they're lying.
Rating: Good

***
Mostly agree with the above.  A couple of points.  I still cringe at the
name of the vampire group (the Eliminati?  Please!), and I also find demon
Balthazar rather cringeworthy myself.

Something I did notice this time around.  One characteristic of Wilkins was
similar to one I really liked in Spike in season 2 (particularly the
beginning portion)--the cheerful amorality.  They express it quite
differently, of course, but they both have that undercore of &quot;having fun
with being evil.&quot;  I find that a lot creepier than the more &quot;serious&quot; evil
of other Big Bads.
***

Season Three, Episode 15: &quot;Consequences&quot;
Writer: Marti Noxon
Director: Michael Gershman

This is probably my favorite of Season Three, and probably in my top
five or ten for the series.  Even on a show like BTVS, it's rare to
see a single hour of television that hits note after note this
brilliantly, with every scene taking one in directions that are
unexpected but make perfect sense in retrospect.  The action never
lets up, and the intensity is as high as it ever gets during the
library double-crosses, Xander's evening with Faith, and her turn to
the dark side.  If I can love one thing even more intensely than
anything else, it's the first significant (well, with dialogue,
anyway) interaction between Faith and Angel.  Separately they're just
my two favorite Buffyverse characters, but together their scenes
virtually never fail to be anything short of amazing.  Spending this
quality time with Faith arguably does more to define Angel as a
character (and one worthy of a spin-off) than anything else we've seen
this year, and lets us see with the benefit of hindsight why exactly
he's going to be the one to save her from herself.
Rating: Excellent

***
Oh, yeah.  Unfortunately, I absolutely love the characterization of Angel
given here by his interaction with Faith, especially how his own dark past
is used to attempt good in the present rather than only being something for
which he is trying to atone.  The irony of evil being a source for good is a
theme we see again and again in this series.

In the confrontation between Faith and Buffy at the wharf, I do think Faith
struck a nerve.  Mind you, I don't think Buffy is ever really in any danger
of becoming like Faith, but I do think she _worries_ about becoming like
Faith.  But then, worrying about becoming like Faith is one of her stronger
innoculations against actually becoming like her.

One thought I had about this episode is that if I were a cold-hearted
bastard like Quentin Travers, there would be no &quot;imprisoning&quot; of rogue
slayers.  After all, if you imprison a slayer you end up without a slayer

&gt; also not be so weak-willed as to be influenced by those factors.
">

Except that Giles' indoctrination is a LOT stronger than the
indoctrination given Milgram's subjects.  Giles comes from a long
line of Watchers.  He's been raised to be a Watcher, raised and
trained his entire life to see the Watcher's Council as THE
legitimate authority in matters supernatural.  Raised and trained
to see his duties to the Council to be more important than any
personal concerns.

It isn't about being &quot;weak-willed&quot;.  It's about having a strong
sense of duty trained into you.

(And as has been pointed out by another poster, Giles' one act of
serious rebellion previous to this did not end well.)

What Giles does in &quot;Helpless&quot; is a major betrayal, arguably the
worst thing that any of the Scoobies does until the last episode of
Season 6.  But it's a betrayal that's entirely in character for
Giles.  Because being a Watcher isn't just a job for him.  To a
large degree it's who he is.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Season Three, Episode 12: &quot;Helpless&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Writer: David Fury
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Director: James A. Contner

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;only way things could have ever gone.  Not only do I totally
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;buy Giles as a betrayer in this situation

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Not me. This is Giles the psycho killer. There is no way any
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; reasonable person (which I think we Giles has been till now)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; would do this to someone
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; they cared about, and no way anyone with a modicum of ethical
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sense (which I
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; think Giles has, at least now in his old age) would do it to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; anyone.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I suggest you do a little reading on some classic psychological
&gt; &gt;&gt; experiments done by Stanley Milgram on Obedience to Authority.

&gt; &gt; I'm aware of them, but his results (up to 65% willing to inflict
&gt; &gt; pain) were obtained with subjects and &quot;victims&quot; who were
&gt; &gt; strangers to each other, and for me, those 65% fail the &quot;modicum
&gt; &gt; of ethics&quot; test, which is what is disturbing about the
&gt; &gt; experiments. From what we have seen of Giles previously, I'd put
&gt; &gt; him in the other 35% - after all, he's a hero in a TV show. And
&gt; &gt; of course, Buffy is obviously not a stranger.

&gt; &gt; The 65% results were also achieved with factors not present
&gt; &gt; here, in particular the experimenter giving the instructions
&gt; &gt; being physically present in the same room as the subject at the
&gt; &gt; time the harm was done, and the &quot;victim&quot; not in the same room.
&gt; &gt; Milligram found that changing either of those factors
&gt; &gt; substantially reduced the %, so the psychology is more complex
&gt; &gt; than just &quot;here's an order from an authority figure, so I'll
&gt; &gt; obey it&quot;. Although, since I don't believe pre-Helpless Giles to
&gt; &gt; be so weak-willed as to be in the 65% in the first place, he'd
&gt; &gt; also not be so weak-willed as to be influenced by those factors.

&gt; Except that Giles' indoctrination is a LOT stronger than the
&gt; indoctrination given Milgram's subjects.  Giles comes from a long
&gt; line of Watchers.  He's been raised to be a Watcher, raised and
&gt; trained his entire life to see the Watcher's Council as THE
&gt; legitimate authority in matters supernatural.  Raised and trained
&gt; to see his duties to the Council to be more important than any
&gt; personal concerns.
">

Repeat the Milgram experiment using subjects in the military and a
superior officer as the authority figure, and that 65% turns into
something like 95%.

No they don't.  The authority of a general is ceded to him by the
government.  Now, one may question whether governments/states have any
legitimate authority, but such is, within limits, generally assumed.  The
Watchers Council has no such legitimacy.

Quentin claims it, but his claim does not hold up.  Bascically, WC vs.
V&amp;D (Vamps and Demons) is a Hatfield/McCoy feud, or maybe a vigilance
committee going after the Clanton Gang.  They have no authority that is not
simply assumed on their own part.  Now, given the circumstances of their
particular vigilante activity, I would certainly be willing to recognize a
&quot;right&quot; to recruit volunteers or to hire mercenaries.  They do not have any
legitimate authority to take Mamelukes.

Chain mail is good against edged weapons.  It's week against piercing
weapons.  If anything has a sharp enough point to get within a ring, it's
not that difficult to break the rivits holding it closed* and punch on
through.  That's one of the reason the battle of Crecy was so one-sided.
Arrows would just go right through chainmail even at distances where they'd
lost a lot of their initial energy.

*Chain mail was made by first wrapping iron/steel wire around a thin spindle
forming a long coil.  Rings were then clipped from the spindle.  For the
best chain mail, the ends of the rings were flattened and overlapped, then a
hole was punched through the flattened section and a steel rivit used to
secure the flattened ends together.  The weakest mail just had the ends
abbutted together.  Somewhere in between was mail where the ends were welded
together (welds broke more easily than rivits).

Ah, but we may not be talking about the council for millenia.  We may

(implied, at least later to be the &quot;leader&quot;) in it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Re-
&gt; watching, this falling out, even temporary, and re-defining of the
&gt; relationship between Buffy and Giles feels inevitable, like that's the
&gt; only way things could have ever gone.
">

I'm not sure what you're going for with that, but this rewatching really
reminded me how much the episode is about Buffy inevitably having to move
beyond Giles - not just Giles's failure and temporary abandonment of Buffy.
The general growing up theme about moving out on your own is pretty strong
this episode.  (I was struck how Joyce is the truly &quot;helpless&quot; one this
episode.)  Some big subtext with Giles is his struggle to let Buffy go.

That's quite paradoxical since the notion is buried in an overtly evil plot
by the WC to force Giles to abandon Buffy.  Giles is so wrong to do what he
does to Buffy, yet Buffy probably comes out stronger for it - kind of like
the WC intended - and all the love and care Giles shows Buffy at the end may
no longer be all that helpful.

From the WC's point of view, Giles was the failure here.  Granted, they're
evil.  But in Joss's perverse world, it's the evil ones that keep coming up
with the true insight.  One way of briefly describing this plot is to say
that Giles makes Buffy handle the crisis on her own, but then can't bear her
suffering and runs to her side.  There are -er- inaccuracies in that
description, but it seems that subconsciously it's how Giles will
internalize this.  Especially in the sense of blocking Buffy's development.
So later you get his Restless dream where his &quot;daughter&quot; Buffy is
infantilized.  And especially you get the S6 crisis when he leaves Buffy.
His part of OMWF mirrors this episode in the fashion I described.  Again he
forces Buffy to go alone into the den of evil.  Then can't stand what he's
done and tries to rush to her aid.  Here we have the WC to scold Giles about
his true duty.  In OMWF he mercilessly scolds himself.  And then effectively
fires himself just as the WC does here.

What completes this parallel for me is that in each case Giles essentially
gets it wrong on both ends.  The abandonment in both cases is cruel
(especially if you extend the S6 one to include his departure to England),
and probably misreading what's truly best for Buffy.  Yes she comes through
both times - probably stronger for having done it - but with penalties.  Too
much scar tissue kind of strength, and a forgetting that so much of Buffy's
true strength is built out of the support of her friends.  Then when he
tries to rush in to help at the end, it's mostly too late.  Serving more to
highlight the prior abandonment than to truly help.  (Yeah, Giles does get
the second vampire in Helpless, but it feels like an afterthought placed
next to Buffy's exhaustion from the real battle that Giles missed.)

In both Helpless and OMWF Giles is in a lot of pain over wanting to be there
for Buffy.  Probably in both cases it's the father's love that is spoken of
so strongly in Helpless.  In OMWF, though, it's probably more clear that he
doesn't know how to do that.  His idea of how to help her is more training,
more Slayer building.  The tools he brings to the effort are those of a
Watcher - not a parent.

Or perhaps the better explanation is that he can't be both a watcher and a
father.  That the trying makes him fall short at each.  In other words, evil
as they are, the WC nailed it.

Personally, I think it's more a personality flaw in Giles.  But whatever the
explanation, Giles does fall short.  Now that I know where the series will
go, there's all that much more added pain in the penultimate scene of
Helpless as I realize that Buffy and Giles aren't going to be able to hold
onto that closeness.

Anyway, I'm pretty pleased with how this watching has helped me reconcile S6
Giles.  I hadn't fully recognized before how much the letting go aspect was
mirrored here.  And especially how Giles could screw it up.  I don't think
I'll ever get over some of the clunky aspects of the S6 story, but at least
it feels a little truer to character.  S7 remains harder for me to handle.
More thought still required.  But presumably this episode at least start
Giles on a path of reworking his watcher identity - ultimately bringing him
around to a place much more aligned with WC philosophy than he could
probably imagine here in Helpless.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Not only do I totally buy Giles
&gt; as a betrayer in this situation, but I sympathize with him perhaps
&gt; more than I should.
">

I think Giles goes through periodic efforts to distance himself - even kind
of dehumanize himself - trying to be the one able to make the hard decision.
(Perhaps Wesley's problem was that, in spite of putting on his hard face, he
kept too much of his humanity exposed.  So he kept wounding himself
grievously.)  But then breaks down and runs to a kind of emotional
outpouring (in a very British fashion) that's kind of awesome.  It only
happens once in a while.  This episode - especially at the very end - is one
of the best examples.  Sympathy cannot help override disappointment when I
watch Giles suppress the personal devastation of his career taken from him
so that he can care for Buffy's wounds.

I think that's what's especially lacking in S7.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Seeing Buffy so vulnerable is perhaps more
&gt; disturbing here than any of the series' other variations on it.
">

Perhaps.  I'm not quite convinced of that.  But it is an outstanding
depiction.

As people have mentioned before, one of the interesting manifestations of
her weakness is seeing how desperately Buffy wants to hold onto her
slayerness.  For so much of the series, being The Slayer is presented as a
problem.  Makes it impossible to lead a normal life.  Threatens to turn her
into a killer.  Almost certainly will kill her eventually.  (Already has
actually.)  And so on.  This episode really stands out for briefly showing
Buffy thinking that it's a good thing.  (Quite a change from Anne.)  Though
the way it turns out, Buffy probably doesn't feel so good about slayerhood
at the end.

What I noticed more this time around, though, was the connection to feelings
of abandonment.  She's already upset about her real father blowing her off,
and disappointed at Giles's lack of response to her reaching out to him.
Now her very nature and identity seems to have run off.  The abandonment
element then hits with a vengeance when the loss of her powers can be
attributed to the direct actions of Giles.  Then I realize that being Slayer
has become her primary connection to people, to love.  Giles, Xander, Willow
and even Angel are in her life because she's the Slayer.  I suppose that
it's not the big theme of this episode, but it still provides a lot of
foundation for the linkage between being The Slayer and love.  That'll get
more explicit in S5.

&gt; beautifully for the purposes of this story.
">

I wrote a lot about that last time around and will let it stand.  Briefly,
I'm quite happy with the WC concept at this point.  A powerful and
interesting entity could have been built out of this.  My disappointment
starts with the arrival of Wesley.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Rating: Excellent

I've always loved this episode, but even more this go around.  It's
relatively narrow focus prevents it from achieving the sense of great import
that Revelations and Consequences do.  But it's second to none for gripping
you with emotion.  And, hey, fantastic scary monster story too.  Kralik
would be a good candidate for the series best one episode monster.  This is
a very strong Excellent.

&gt; Season Three, Episode 13: &quot;The Zeppo&quot;
&gt; Buffy/Angel exchanges are no more melodramatic than the
&gt; ones we were expected to take seriously in &quot;Amends.&quot;
">

But they are more self mocking.  I keep seeing the argument that it's no
different than what we've seen before - yet everybody notices it here
anyway.  *Something's* got to be different for it to stand out enough to be
noticed.

I think I laugh at the stilted language of the main cast more every time I
watch the episode.  I suppose they could have made it more obvious by
getting people to throw their hands up to their foreheads and swooning.  But
I think carrying it to that level of ridiculousness would get in the way of
everything being played as Xander would see it.  It's not only a joke.
Though they get mighty close to that level with the Buffy/Angel/Xander
scene.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Rating: Decent
">

I enjoy the construct and keep appreciating the details.  I think this may
be the first episode that they really play with the audience's perceptions
of reality.  The series will do that again.  But the episode stubbornly
resists being a truly great one.  It'll have to settle for a Good rating
from me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Season Three, Episode 14: &quot;Bad Girls&quot;

&gt; but is gradually revealed to be very much a Part I by the end.
">

Yeah, but it's still pretty self contained anyway.  I think this is the
easiest Part I in the series for me to watch without having to immediately
rush to Part II.

For me, this episode is the peak of Faith as mirror to Buffy - the possible
alternate identity for Buffy to adopt.  As such it's more about Buffy than
Faith.

&gt;&gt; the relationship between Buffy and Giles feels inevitable, like
&gt;&gt; that's the only way things could have ever gone.

&gt; I'm not sure what you're going for with that, but this
&gt; rewatching really reminded me how much the episode is about
&gt; Buffy inevitably having to move beyond Giles - not just Giles's
&gt; failure and temporary abandonment of Buffy.
">

Among other things, I see this episode as an important point in the
shift in the command structure of the group--from a division of
labor where Buffy is in tactical command out in the field but Giles
is tends to be in charge of general strategy and planning, to Buffy
being the sole leader.

While the new command structure is not necessarily better, the
shift was probably inevitable given the people involved.

(Inevitable even without the events of &quot;Helpless&quot;, although
&quot;Helpless&quot; and its aftermath did probably accelerate the changes.)

&gt;&gt; Season Three, Episode 14: &quot;Bad Girls&quot;

&gt;&gt; This is good stuff.  It has an odd vibe that threw me a bit as
&gt;&gt; a first- time viewer, since it looks and quacks like a
&gt;&gt; self-contained story, but is gradually revealed to be very much
&gt;&gt; a Part I by the end.
">

One of my favorite bits is near the beginning, when Buffy is
introduced to Wesley.  She's conspicuously deferential to Giles,
sending the message that, as far as she's concerned, he's still her
REAL Watcher.

(Of course, despite what Buffy might say at this point, Giles is
never really her Watcher again in the same way that he was before
&quot;Helpless&quot;.)

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Season Three, Episode 12: &quot;Helpless&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Writer: David Fury
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Director: James A. Contner

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;only way things could have ever gone.  Not only do I totally
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;buy Giles as a betrayer in this situation

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Not me. This is Giles the psycho killer. There is no way any
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; reasonable person (which I think we Giles has been till now)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; would do this to someone
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; they cared about, and no way anyone with a modicum of ethical
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sense (which I
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; think Giles has, at least now in his old age) would do it to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; anyone.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I suggest you do a little reading on some classic psychological
&gt; &gt;&gt; experiments done by Stanley Milgram on Obedience to Authority.

&gt; &gt; I'm aware of them, but his results (up to 65% willing to inflict
&gt; &gt; pain) were obtained with subjects and &quot;victims&quot; who were
&gt; &gt; strangers to each other, and for me, those 65% fail the &quot;modicum
&gt; &gt; of ethics&quot; test, which is what is disturbing about the
&gt; &gt; experiments. From what we have seen of Giles previously, I'd put
&gt; &gt; him in the other 35% - after all, he's a hero in a TV show. And
&gt; &gt; of course, Buffy is obviously not a stranger.

&gt; &gt; The 65% results were also achieved with factors not present
&gt; &gt; here, in particular the experimenter giving the instructions
&gt; &gt; being physically present in the same room as the subject at the
&gt; &gt; time the harm was done, and the &quot;victim&quot; not in the same room.
&gt; &gt; Milligram found that changing either of those factors
&gt; &gt; substantially reduced the %, so the psychology is more complex
&gt; &gt; than just &quot;here's an order from an authority figure, so I'll
&gt; &gt; obey it&quot;. Although, since I don't believe pre-Helpless Giles to
&gt; &gt; be so weak-willed as to be in the 65% in the first place, he'd
&gt; &gt; also not be so weak-willed as to be influenced by those factors.

&gt; Except that Giles' indoctrination is a LOT stronger than the
&gt; indoctrination given Milgram's subjects.  Giles comes from a long
&gt; line of Watchers.  He's been raised to be a Watcher, raised and
&gt; trained his entire life to see the Watcher's Council as THE
&gt; legitimate authority in matters supernatural.  Raised and trained
&gt; to see his duties to the Council to be more important than any
&gt; personal concerns.

&gt; It isn't about being &quot;weak-willed&quot;.  It's about having a strong
&gt; sense of duty trained into you.

&gt; (And as has been pointed out by another poster, Giles' one act of
&gt; serious rebellion previous to this did not end well.)
">

Took the general sentiments right out of my mouth.  Indoctrination is
an extremely powerful force.  I'd assume that the Watchers have
specific training that involves drilling into members' heads the idea
that however painful it may be to put their Slayer through whatever,
it's what has to be done for the sake of the future of the human
race.  Add to that Giles learning as a child that he has a sacred
duty, and it being something that he comes back to after his misspent
youth.

That's one of my bigger problems with the Watchers throughout the
series - they're presented as not only authoritarian, but also pretty
stupid.  The Watchers we see (including Wesley, while a Council
member) consistently demonstrate complete incompetence in what they
profess to be doing, and Buffy consistently comes up with better ways
to fight evil than they're managed with their thousands-year-old
organization and resources.  As far as adversaries or authorities go,
the WC is a straw-man.

I think it's a happy discovery indeed.  Not just because Faith is
fascinating in her own right, but because there are limits to what they can
pull off in the business of Faith being a mirror to Buffy - the thing she
might be.  They do follow through on that repeatedly - like with the I am
the law theme.  But it becomes clear - especially here in S3 - that Buffy
has brakes on her, through both her personal connects and through her innate
heart - that prevent her from truly going down Faith's path.

The great thing about Faith taking off as her own story is that it lets the
mirror be reversed so that Buffy can be the alternative for Faith to be
drawn to.  Ultimately I think that proves the more interesting side of the
mirror mirror story.  But better than both is that they can be explored in
tandem.  It sustains this weird sense of connected sisterhood between them
in spite of their many and manifest differences.

Yeah, I know what you mean.  He is rather the slacker.  But his drifting
strikes me as different than apathy.  He still chooses what he wants and can
be quite determined about settng aside what he doesn't.  I think you get
hints of that in some of his famous relationship monents with Willow - like
telling her to leave him alone to work out his Xander issue and that feeling
good about herself is her problem.  Maybe going on the road wouldn't be the
particular thing - I chose that because of what the show has him do in S4 -
but I struggle seeing being a Scooby as much of an enticement to him.  Some
day he'd run into something else he liked better or just get sick of being a
Scooby.  And that would be trouble between him and Willow no matter what.

The character list is only a contributing factor, albeit a valuable one.
I'm mostly speaking to the dismissive attitude towards later seasons.  I'm
not going to quarrel with individual favorite choices.  I really do believe
a decent case can be made for each of the seven seasons being the best one.

S7 is the most ambitious season of all to my mind.  Not just in quantity,
but in quality of meaning.  What it aspires to is fantastic - and most of it
does get communicated, if only in outline.  The struggles in execution,
which aren't minor, still don't stop the message.  I'm amazed at how much
was effectively wrapped up for the whole series by the end - while still
retaining the sense that there are still great lives to live for our heroes.
The TV series feels complete - which often doesn't happen.  But the
imagining goes on forever.

The elements that produce that are many - perhaps too many for its own good.
I think the most important is simply tying the series together.  That's
obviously represented in how the final episode addresses the conflict
introduced in the first episode of the series.  But it's not limited to
that.  A whole bunch of favorite series themes are worked one last time in
S7 - from trust to redemption to the journey through life and many more.
The dream of S7 is just awesome.  You can really feel that dream if you let
yourself.

Nothing is going to convince me that Wesley is portrayed as capable at
his job.  Looking up stuff is only one part of being a Watcher, and
outside of &quot;Choices,&quot; the show highlights Wesley strutting around
talking about fighting vampires in controlled circumstances, getting
beaten up, ready to sell out after getting beaten up, losing sparring
matches to a guy who's not even paying attention, and so on.  And he's
the guy the WC chose to handle their two Slayers, taking over where
Giles was such a failure.

&gt; From the WC's point of view, Giles was the failure here.  Granted, they're

&gt; internalize this.  Especially in the sense of blocking Buffy's development.
&gt; So later you get his Restless dream where his &quot;daughter&quot; Buffy is
&gt; infantilized.  And especially you get the S6 crisis when he leaves Buffy.
&gt; His part of OMWF mirrors this episode in the fashion I described.  Again he
&gt; forces Buffy to go alone into the den of evil.  Then can't stand what he's
&gt; done and tries to rush to her aid.  Here we have the WC to scold Giles about
&gt; his true duty.  In OMWF he mercilessly scolds himself.  And then effectively
&gt; fires himself just as the WC does here.

&gt; What completes this parallel for me is that in each case Giles essentially
&gt; gets it wrong on both ends.  The abandonment in both cases is cruel
&gt; (especially if you extend the S6 one to include his departure to England),
&gt; and probably misreading what's truly best for Buffy.  Yes she comes through
&gt; both times - probably stronger for having done it - but with penalties.  Too
&gt; much scar tissue kind of strength, and a forgetting that so much of Buffy's
&gt; true strength is built out of the support of her friends.  Then when he
&gt; tries to rush in to help at the end, it's mostly too late.  Serving more to
&gt; highlight the prior abandonment than to truly help.  (Yeah, Giles does get
&gt; the second vampire in Helpless, but it feels like an afterthought placed
&gt; next to Buffy's exhaustion from the real battle that Giles missed.)
">

I'm inclined to parallel the extended S6 story rather than only OMWF,
because the reasons he gives in OMWF lead him to leave for England the
next week.  Really short on time right now, but for me the difference
is that in &quot;Helpless,&quot; Giles realizes what he's done wrong, and takes
steps to correct it, and it's shown that he'll have to live with what
he's done for a long time, and is ready to face it.  That's a
satisfying character story with a beginning, middle, and
continuation.  Pat, maybe, but sometimes I want pat from my heroes.
That's missing in S6; I don't think either the show or the character
do enough to hold him accountable for abandoning Buffy, and it hurts
the story a lot for me.

&gt; As people have mentioned before, one of the interesting manifestations of
&gt; her weakness is seeing how desperately Buffy wants to hold onto her
&gt; slayerness.  For so much of the series, being The Slayer is presented as a
&gt; problem.  Makes it impossible to lead a normal life.  Threatens to turn her
&gt; into a killer.  Almost certainly will kill her eventually.  (Already has
&gt; actually.)  And so on.  This episode really stands out for briefly showing
&gt; Buffy thinking that it's a good thing.  (Quite a change from Anne.)  Though
&gt; the way it turns out, Buffy probably doesn't feel so good about slayerhood
&gt; at the end.

Well, it's deceptively simple in some ways.  Buffy wants a normal
life, but she really doesn't want to give up her swank super-powers.
Specifically, once you know what's out there, it'd be nice to know you
can defend yourself against it.  From WTTH: &quot;I didn't say I'd never
slay another vampire.  It's not like I have all these fluffy-bunny
feelings for them,  I'm just not gonna get way extracurricular with
it.  You know, if I see one, sure I'll--&quot;  Quite a recovery from the
summer in L.A., though.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What I noticed more this time around, though, was the connection to feelings
&gt; of abandonment.  She's already upset about her real father blowing her off,
&gt; and disappointed at Giles's lack of response to her reaching out to him.
&gt; Now her very nature and identity seems to have run off.  The abandonment
&gt; element then hits with a vengeance when the loss of her powers can be
&gt; attributed to the direct actions of Giles.  Then I realize that being Slayer
&gt; has become her primary connection to people, to love.  Giles, Xander, Willow
&gt; and even Angel are in her life because she's the Slayer.  I suppose that
&gt; it's not the big theme of this episode, but it still provides a lot of
&gt; foundation for the linkage between being The Slayer and love.  That'll get

&gt; &gt; Season Three, Episode 13: &quot;The Zeppo&quot;
&gt; &gt; Buffy/Angel exchanges are no more melodramatic than the

&gt; But they are more self mocking.  I keep seeing the argument that it's no
&gt; different than what we've seen before - yet everybody notices it here
&gt; anyway.  *Something's* got to be different for it to stand out enough to be
&gt; noticed.

The only reason I noticed it (of course, I don't listen to background
music, so a bit of a special case) is that the end of the episode made
sense out of where they were going with it.  Too ridiculous and one
loses the sense of it feeling real to Xander, but the problem with
being slightly restrained is that the series tends towards cheese
anyway, so I honestly do not get anything out of the self-mocking.

Well, most of it, anyway.  I'm kinda fond of the Willow/Xander
exchange (&quot;It's really bad... I love you, Xander!&quot;  &quot;...D'huh?&quot;)  And,
as mentioned, it finally works at the end, with the tiny glimpse big
noisy clusterfuck in the library and the follow-up refusal to explain
anything to us.  But the rest, not impressed.  And I will forever fail
to see how the Ozwolf being harder to subdue than in a normal episode

&gt; he's genuinely formidable.

I'd still been thinking of Trick as the main foe; until now, it wasn't
clear to me who was the dominant one in their partnership.  It makes
sense to learn that the writers hadn't been sure at first either.  For
those who haven't seen the commentary, Doug Petrie tells the story of
the moment he started to &quot;get&quot; Wilkins (when he'd written a sarcastic
line for him about his meeting with the boy scouts or whatever, and
Joss told him 'no, no, no - he really does love doing events like

&gt; Exactly how much danger there is of that can be subject to debate.
&gt; I'd say she tried it in &quot;This Year's Girl&quot; and it didn't take, because
&gt; it's simply not who she is at this point.  But the notion of Faith as
&gt; an aspect of what Buffy could be is a major theme which the show hits
&gt; on repeatedly; Faith becoming a fascinating character in her own right
&gt; was probably more of a happy discovery rather than her main reason for
&gt; being created.  That'll continue with Faith's focus on making Buffy
&gt; more like her, running all the way into &quot;Graduation Day.&quot;
">

I was confused by the &quot;This Year's Girl&quot; reference until you mentioned below
that you meant &quot;Bad Girls.&quot; Yeah, in &quot;Bad Girls&quot; Buffy flirted with the Dark
Side.  That's not an uncommon phase for people to go through.  However,
Buffy had a core of, well, morality--an idea that just because you want
something it's not right.  And their different reactions to the killing of
the mayor's assistent really underscores the difference between them.  I
want to call it a divergent point, but it's not really.  They are already on
different paths from a lot farther back.  It's just the mayor's assistent's
death marks a point where the divergence accelerates.

In many ways, Buffy and Faith mirror each other.  Where Buffy worries about
becoming like Faith (causing Faith's accusations along those lines to
sting), Faith worries that others are _not_ like her (leading to her
constant &quot;all men are beasts&quot; and &quot;you're just like me&quot; diatribes--the
Slayer doth protest too much).

In S7 it's asserted that it's about the power.  Along the way it is at least
implied, if not outright demonstrated, that the whole Slayer construct is
designed to control that power.  A short life-span is a natural result of
that construct.  And riding herd, as you put it, is part of the method.

On the other hand, it also seems clear that fighting vampires really was the
motive for creating the Slayer.  It's an arguable point whether the demon
battle or the control of power has become the greater objective over time.

Buffy's epiphany not only breaks the control, but expands the power by
orders of magnitude.  From her point of view, that control proves not only
to be morally wrong, but a practical error as well by virtue of limiting the
power too much.  It is for an untold future to say what perils such power
uncontrolled might have.  The WC attitude could be defended as them
harnessing a demon power that they dare not let run free.

&gt; I'm inclined to parallel the extended S6 story rather than only OMWF,
&gt; because the reasons he gives in OMWF lead him to leave for England the
&gt; next week.
">

It's not a precise match I know.  I focused on OMWF because it has the part
where Giles leaves Buffy on her own, then regrets his choice and comes
running after.  That behavior occurs other times too, though I'm not going
to try to identify when.  I can say that it is mocked a little in The
Freshman.  In any case, I think it starts in Helpless, setting up the
framework for the parallel.

The other part of the parallel is not being able to reconcile watcher duty
with fatherly love.  I had forgotten how that was explicitly stated in
Helpless.  I had previously thought that it must be implied in S6.

The underlying issue of Giles fearing that he's holding Buffy back isn't so
much a parallel as an ongoing and evolving attitude within Giles.  Giles
doesn't even think that way in Helpless, though I believe that's what starts
his doubts.  That bastard Travers planted the seed by emphasizing Buffy's
growth while Giles seeks to protect her.

In any case, the full picture surely does include Tabula Rasa.  But I think
the crisis for Giles is still in OMWF.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; and it's shown that he'll have to live with what

Yes, but Helpless is the start of Giles's path - a path that will
unavoidably include periods of great separation from Buffy and awkward
places where he can't be what Buffy needs.  His thinking evolves a lot by
the time S6 rolls around and he convinces himself that he's done something
different wrong, and that living with that for a long time means him living
without Buffy.  I believe the S6 departure is intended to be very painful
for him - perceived by Giles as a great sacrifice.  I don't think the
depiction quite lives up to that - part of its awkwardness.  But I still
think it's the intent.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I like the Helpless conclusion a lot better myself.  It's one of the
greatest Giles episodes ever.  I'm definitely not trying to put the S6
events on a comparable level.  I'm just trying to give better sense to them.
Make me hate them a little less.

In any case, considering what comes up in S7, perhaps they didn't want Giles
to come off so well, and to leave the implications hanging.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; do enough to hold him accountable for abandoning Buffy, and it hurts

This is pretty speculative on my part, but the accountability could be his
inability to reconnect successfully with Buffy in S7.  His departure may
have proved to be a more thorough divorce than either fully realized until
the big dust up in LMPTM.  As you may recall, that episode was constructed
to parallel Revelations with Giles taking on Xander's role.  Part of the
concept is for the events of that episode to be the culmination of attitudes
built up over an extended period.  Perhaps the fracturing of trust between
them extends back to his S6 departure.

Whether there's an Amends equivalent can be debated.  Things were too rushed
at the end of S7 to do justice to that and many other details.  But there is
one huge difference between LMPTM and Revelations.  Buffy and Xander were
humbled enough by the experience to at least agree on a cease fire.  Quite
the opposite for Giles and Buffy in S7.  Buffy closing the door on Giles
then had to be brutal for him.

So Giles did get payback eventually.

Oh, sure.  The seaon's narrative continues along.  But I don't think that's
central to Consequences.  That's Buffy's need for contrition vs. Faith's
flight from it.  A battle for Faith's soul that Buffy loses.  Faith lectures
Buffy something fierce, but I think it's really for her own benefit.
Working up the rationale.

&gt; BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER
&gt; Season Three, Episode 12: &quot;Helpless&quot;
&gt; Writer: David Fury
&gt; Director: James A. Contner
.
&gt; And now we move into probably my favorite stretch of the season.  Re-
&gt; watching, this falling out, even temporary, and re-defining of the
&gt; relationship between Buffy and Giles feels inevitable, like that's the
&gt; only way things could have ever gone.  Not only do I totally buy Giles
&gt; as a betrayer in this situation, but I sympathize with him perhaps
&gt; more than I should.
">

I agree with the latter (both the sympathy and there possibly being more
of it than there should be).  But I struggle to buy Giles's role in
Helpless.  As in fact I struggle to swallow the whole idea of the
Cruciamentum.  It's too self-defeating to be believable if the Council is
sincerely trying to fight evil, but it doesn't make sense as an Council
plot to murder Slayers, either.  And anyway, the evil-Council theory
doesn't really fit with what we see of them later in S5 and S7, where they
are shown to be wrongheaded but basically on the same side as the Slayer.
Which, in my opinion, makes for a more satisfying story.  Other people
want to see shades of grey in vampires, I want to see them in Watchers!
... Getting back to Giles's part in the test, I could theoretically buy
him reluctantly doing it, but we should have seen signs of worry and
stress and guilt as Buffy's birthday approached.  Even if a lifetime of
Watcher's training and indoctrination really could make Giles go along
with the test, it would have been very very hard for him.  Keeping all his
emotional trauma all confined within this one episode does nothing to make
the Cruciamentum feel less like a contrived plot device.  Showing him
fretting about something back in Lovers Walk or even just Gingerbread
would have helped make the contrivance go down a little easier.

So the centerpiece of this week's plot never really worked for me.  But
that's okay, because the drama built around that centerpiece kicks ass.
I love the same things everyone else does: the Buffy-Angel scenes
(especially the one featuring Spordelia and the heart thing), the
emotional scene when Giles confesses to Buffy, villain of the week Kralik,
the final reconciliation and sacking scene, and so on.  It's all very well
acted.

Did anyone else think that Angel hit the wrong note with his birthday gift
for Buffy, an old edition of _Sonnets from the Portuguese_?  Buffy is
certainly not stupid, but she's never seemed to be much of a reader
either.  A book of poetry seems a little intimidating to Buffy at a moment
when her self-confidence has just taken a major blow ... but I sometimes
wonder if her reaction would have been much different even if she wasn't
going through that particular crisis at the same time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Seeing Buffy so vulnerable is perhaps more
&gt; disturbing here than any of the series' other variations on it.
">

Especially when she's running for her life, screaming for help -- she's
not just weakened, she's in exactly the same situation that so many
ordinary girls and women face.  I don't think we ever see that so
explicitly in the other variations on vulnerable-Buffy.

Random thought: I think this is the only definite clue we get about
Faith's exact age.  She must be younger than Buffy, since the Council
hasn't tried the Cruciamentum on her yet.

I wonder if Buffy and the others told Joyce exactly what Giles had done,
or if they let her think that it was some random Council goon who stole
Bufffy's powers.  It's hard to imagine Joyce forgiving the man who
*POISONED HER CHILD*, after all, yet I don't recall any tension between
her and Giles because of it later.  This points to another problem -- the
final Buffy-Giles scene is the only explicit sign of reconciliation that
we see between them.  Unless I'm forgetting something in a later episode?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I'll only go as far as Good, mainly because of my problems with the very
idea of the Cruciamentum.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Season Three, Episode 13: &quot;The Zeppo&quot;
&gt; Writer: Dan Vebber
&gt; Director: James Whitmore, Jr.
.
&gt; This is one that I was hoping to be able to upgrade to Good, knowing
&gt; the conceit coming in.  But as Mrs. Quality commented while watching,
&gt; &quot;this is such a BAD episode!&quot;  I wouldn't go that far, but Xander
&gt; jumping around for the football is one of those moments that makes me
&gt; want to jam screws into my eyes and ears, and the rest of the early
&gt; going isn't a whole lot less painful.
">

I usually skip over the whole football part.  It's both un-Xander (he'd
love to be popular, but rarely if ever tries to suck up to the jocks) and
un-funny (unlike most of the episode's last two acts).

I had pretty much the same OFV reaction that Wouter mentioned, finding the
whole pushing-Xander-aside plotline to be badly overdone and, as Burt
rightly points out, jarringly inconsistent with pretty much the whole
series so far.  Much as I enjoyed some of the humor (how can you not love
the mailbox?) and drama (Faith), the episode as a whole kind of pissed me
off.  I guess I feel a little protective towards Xander.  He's not my
favorite character, but he probably has the highest individual product of
(amount of my affection for character) * (amount of disrespect character
gets from fans) * (amount writers are willing to twist character to make a
joke).  And he lacks the ardent cult of defenders that certain other
characters have.  So my first reaction was to be annoyed that poor Xander
was being written out of character for the sake of a few laughs.

The theory that The Zeppo is shown from Xander's distorted point of view
went a long way to reconciling me to that part of the episode.  However,
I'd like to take that theory in a slightly different direction.  A lot of
Xander's part in The Zeppo is not literally how Xander perceives the
world, even on a very down day.  Instead, it's a symbolic representation
of how Xander *feels* about the world.  For example, being given donut
duty and nothing else doesn't mean he really thinks that's all he does,
forgetting all the research and fighting he's done in the past; but it
symbolizes his doubts about how useful he is to the team.  Same thing with
his repeatedly offering to help, only to be brushed off.  This could even
apply to the annoying football scene at the beginning:  trying to join the
jocks' game of catch isn't the kind of thing Xander would normally do, but
it symbolizes his secret, doomed wish to be more popular.  These plot
elements are flatly inconsistent with what we've seen of Xander and his
friends in the past 46 episodes, but they're shown here as an insight into
Xander's emotional state.  So, that's my theory.  It makes The Zeppo a lot
easier to swallow for me.

&gt; place for a viewer to be.  The much vaunted gentle mockery of the
&gt; series' conventions also falls flat until the very end, if only
&gt; because the cheap unknown spirit doesn't seem as cheap on a low-budget
&gt; show, and the Buffy/Angel exchanges are no more melodramatic than the
&gt; ones we were expected to take seriously in &quot;Amends.&quot;
">

IMO the best part the gentle mockery is not the exaggeration of the usual
melodrama.  There *is* a great deal of exaggeration, but what really makes
it work is that the whole A story is kept in the background, so that we
only see isolated snippets of BtVS's classic ... argh, what's the word?
Tropes?  Motifs?  Gimmicks?  Whatever, we only isolated snippets of them,
without most of the context that usually surrounds them, making us realize
how often we see the same standard elements: the discovery of a looming
apocalypse, the research session, the teary Buffy-Angel scene, the
climactic battle and so on.  And I don't know if this was deliberate on
ME's part or not, but this little parody shows us something else: the
standard tropes (or whatever)  are really just the framework that episodes
are built on.  The heart and soul of BtVS is not in them, but in the long
term development of the characters, the stuff that usually surrounds those
tropes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; of the episode (Faith's interlude is the approximate dividing point,
&gt; although a few last bits of lame stuff are afterward)
">

That has got to be one of the hottest humorous sex scenes I've ever seen.
&quot;Just relax and take your pants off.&quot; &quot;Those two concepts are
antithetical.&quot;  (What a great unexpected term for Xander to use -- I'm
reminded of Jayne's &quot;pretentious&quot; in Shindig.)  One great little detail is
that Faith actually seems to enjoy the afterglow, for a minute, before
kicking Xander out.  This not only makes the out-kicking funnier, it also
shows us beyond doubt that Faith really is enjoying herself.  She isn't
driven to joyless random sex by some psychological trauma.  She chooses to
live the way she does because she likes it, traumatic background
notwithstanding.  This fits in very well with what we see in the first
three quarters of Bad Girls.

Other random notes:

-AOQ questions why Ozwolf is harder to subdue than usual.  The reason
given within the story is that the energy of the opening Hellmouth has him
more hyped up than he's ever been before.  (Outside the story, the
writer's intent was surely to add to the exaggerated apocalyptic
atmosphere, as well as to provide a reason why Ozwolf is in the basement.)

-The zombies are a rather awkward mixture of high school jock and criminal
thug -- two flavors that certainly *could* go together, but really need a
little explanation.  Perhaps this too is symbolic of Xander's attitude
about jocks?

-Willow's &quot;I love you&quot; reminds me more of Xander's in Becoming 2 than the
near-death situation in Lovers Walk, as it's ambiguous if the love in
question is just friendly love or if there might be a hint of something
else.

-The time bomb always reminds me of the one in _Galaxy Quest_, which stops

I'm a lot more OK with the test than you.  I'm curious how you see it as
self-defeating.  My approach doesn't really get there.

I doubt they're trying to murder Slayers, but I don't think they'd be much
concerned about the risk of death either.  The Slayer construct assures a
perpetual supply.  They might accept the inevitable periodic Slayer death in
this test as simply weeding out the weaker Slayers and then quickly moving
on to the next.  I tend to accept the more or less stated intent to &quot;test&quot;
The Slayer.  Both in the sense of finding out what she's made of and
advancing her abilities through ordeal.

The coincident test of the watcher would be important too.  I imagine its
aim is to assure that the man in the field is adequately ruthless in pursuit
of WC aims.  Ruthless would be the overall watchword for the exercise, and
the dominant characteristic of the WC as presented here.  I believe that
would be consistent with the S7 emphasis on power and control where The
Slayer is symbolically and literally chained to watcher authority.  The
watcher's first job may be to hold the reins tightly.  That would support
the underlying issue of the S5 encounter - that the WC has no power without
The Slayer.

The test itself is more than a thousand years old.  (I forget offhand how
much more.)  As I imagine it at its inception, the normal circumstances for
a Slayer would be terribly harsh.  A mean and cruel world around her.  And
an isolated beyond Spartan personal life style dominated by one harsh task
master.  I suspect the ruthlessness of the exercise would feel a whole lot
more par for the course than it does for Buffy.  And I suspect that survival
would feel a whole lot more like triumph than it does for Buffy.

For the WC to be so hidebound by ancient tradition would seem problematic on
the face of it.  But in a series that routinely uses cross bows and swords
as weapons, I'm not sure that the WC deserves to be singled out for that
criticism.

More to the point, the WC represents society's patriarchal tradition - one
that is intended to be seen as a pointless relic of an ancient past.  Buffy
is the focal point of change.  It is through her that the cruel abuse of the
Cruciamentum is laid bare.  Just as it's through her that the tyranny of the
WC is broken - representing empowerment breaking the tyranny of patriarchy.
(BtVS usually is reasonably restrained with its feminist message -
emphasizing the monster story and character impact over the preaching.  But
it's still there.  And the WC as patriarchy is one of the strongest
allegorical relationships.)

Where I think the WC concept seriously falters is in the arrival of Wesley -
even though he personally is a good character.  The savvy ruthlessness of
Travers that we see this episode is what is conspicuously absent in Wesley.
At a critical point in their relationship with their Slayer charges - not
one, but two Slayers - both with watcher issues that could make them hostile
to the WC - they send a wet behind the ears goof.  The palpable sense of
power that Travers exudes this episode is instantly lost and never
recovered.

I thought it was... odd.  Didn't quite work for me, though it didn't impede
much either.  I generally write it off as Angel not knowing how to do gifts.
He may have tried to draw on what he remembered of gift giving in his human
days over two centuries before.  Perhaps that's what the guys he knew gave
their lady friends back then. (I'm guessing he never had a serious enough

Buffy:  (to Giles) I don't know how you managed. (he looks up at her) It was
the bravest thing I've ever seen.

OK, Ok.  That's Zeppo talk.  But I think events took over.  First they had
to save the world.  Then a new watcher comes to town.  On the one hand
they're busy being thrust into working together to common ends.  There's a
natural reconciliation built into the deeds.  And of course there's Buffy's
relief in Consequences when Giles so certainly believed in her rather than
Faith.  I'm sure that went a long way to reconciling.

On the other hand they probably can't fully reconcile.  The thing that's
always united the two has been sundered.  Giles isn't Buffy's watcher
anymore.  That fact just hovers in the background through the remainder of
the season.  And a big relationship change occurs as Buffy gradually becomes
very much the one in charge.

&gt; antithetical.&quot;  (What a great unexpected term for Xander to use -- I'm
&gt; reminded of Jayne's &quot;pretentious&quot; in Shindig.)  One great little detail is
&gt; that Faith actually seems to enjoy the afterglow, for a minute, before
&gt; kicking Xander out.  This not only makes the out-kicking funnier, it also
&gt; shows us beyond doubt that Faith really is enjoying herself.  She isn't
&gt; driven to joyless random sex by some psychological trauma.  She chooses to
&gt; live the way she does because she likes it, traumatic background
&gt; notwithstanding.  This fits in very well with what we see in the first
&gt; three quarters of Bad Girls.
">

I'm personally of the opinion that Faith pumping Buffy about Xander the next
episode has to be because she's actually thinking about him after.  Not
quite the use 'em and lose 'em attitude she affects.  In other words,
Xander's sense of connection isn't entirely wrong.  Not enough connection to
even come close to overriding Faith's mental state in Consequences.  But
still real.

But Xander's insight and potential probably had been at least somewhat under

&gt; I'm a lot more OK with the test than you.  I'm curious how you see it
&gt; as self-defeating.  My approach doesn't really get there.
">

The problem with the test--leaving aside its abject cruelty--is that it
accomplishes nothing.  Quentin's monologue about a Slayer needs to be
cunning, etc. sounds all noble and such, but what does a test to destruction
of those characteristics really accomplish?  If the Slayer has them in
sufficient quantity, she survives the test (&quot;sufficient quantity&quot;, of
course, being defined as &quot;enough to survive the test), but then she has them
whether she's put through the test or not.  If she doesn't, she dies.  But
then, if she really is inadequate, she'll die soon enough in the field--and
may take down quite a few vamps along the way before that happens.  Then
again, maybe she'll develop those qualities with more experience and
seasoning.

The test just makes no sense.  Now, it's not at all inconsistent with
the kinds of &quot;tests&quot; done at the tests inception.  One need only to look at
some of the tests for &quot;witches&quot; of a much more recent vintage to see that.
However, continuing the test in the modern day with only appeal to tradition
and some vague assurances that &quot;she'll be stronger for it&quot; merely
underscores how hidebound and out of touch the WC is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I doubt they're trying to murder Slayers, but I don't think they'd be

&gt; Slayers and then quickly moving on to the next.  I tend to accept the
&gt; more or less stated intent to &quot;test&quot; The Slayer.  Both in the sense
&gt; of finding out what she's made of and advancing her abilities through

I would word that slightly differently.  Instead of &quot;test&quot; I'd say
&quot;cull.&quot; And no one test is really going to assess &quot;what she's made of.&quot;  As
for &quot;advancing her abilities through ordeal&quot; that's the &quot;throw them in and
hope they float&quot; approach to training.  While it might produce a few good
swimmers, it also produces a lot of people who are deathly afraid of the
water.  And if you didn't allow rescue (which this test doesn't) you also
end up with a lot of people who drown--maybe someone who would have been an
Olympic medalist if you had taken a more supportive approach.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The coincident test of the watcher would be important too.  I imagine
&gt; its aim is to assure that the man in the field is adequately ruthless
&gt; in pursuit of WC aims.  Ruthless would be the overall watchword for
&gt; the exercise, and the dominant characteristic of the WC as presented
&gt; here.  I believe that would be consistent with the S7 emphasis on
&gt; power and control where The Slayer is symbolically and literally
&gt; chained to watcher authority.  The watcher's first job may be to hold
&gt; the reins tightly.  That would support the underlying issue of the S5
&gt; encounter - that the WC has no power without The Slayer.
">

I think S7 shows us quite well what the pre-Buffy intended relationship
between Slayer and WC was:  the First Slayer wasn't a volunteer.  Wasn't
even a member of the community.  She was a prisoner, chained and forced
against her will to take on the roll.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The test itself is more than a thousand years old.  (I forget offhand
&gt; how much more.)  As I imagine it at its inception, the normal
&gt; circumstances for a Slayer would be terribly harsh.  A mean and cruel
&gt; world around her.  And an isolated beyond Spartan personal life style
&gt; dominated by one harsh task master.  I suspect the ruthlessness of
&gt; the exercise would feel a whole lot more par for the course than it
&gt; does for Buffy.  And I suspect that survival would feel a whole lot
&gt; more like triumph than it does for Buffy.
">

Well, in a society where one tests whether someone is a witch by tying
them up and throwing them into a lake--if they float, they're a witch and
are therefore executed.  If they sink, and therefore drown, they're
innocent--it probably would seem like par for the course.  The world has
moved on.  The WC hasn't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; For the WC to be so hidebound by ancient tradition would seem
&gt; problematic on the face of it.  But in a series that routinely uses
&gt; cross bows and swords as weapons, I'm not sure that the WC deserves
&gt; to be singled out for that criticism.
">

Some years back I was involved in paper and pencil RPG's.  A local
gamemaster was starting a modern vampire game where the setting was local
and the characters were based on the players.

As soon as I knew the score, I started thinking.  I had a small
revolver--I never used it and only had it since a friend gave it too me when
he entered the military, but I had it--and quickly described using reloading
equipment and light powder loads and bullets handcrafted out of wood.  A
six-shot ranged staker.  The super-soaker filled with holy water was
obvious.  And so on.

You have to ignore a lot of what the modern world has learned both in
terms of technology and approaches to problem solving for vampire stories to
work in the modern day.

&gt; More to the point, the WC represents society's patriarchal tradition
&gt; - one that is intended to be seen as a pointless relic of an ancient
&gt; past.  Buffy is the focal point of change.  It is through her that
&gt; the cruel abuse of the Cruciamentum is laid bare.  Just as it's
&gt; through her that the tyranny of the WC is broken - representing
&gt; empowerment breaking the tyranny of patriarchy. (BtVS usually is
&gt; reasonably restrained with its feminist message - emphasizing the
&gt; monster story and character impact over the preaching.  But it's
&gt; still there.  And the WC as patriarchy is one of the strongest
&gt; allegorical relationships.)

A lot to agree with here, but I'll have to think on it more.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Where I think the WC concept seriously falters is in the arrival of
&gt; Wesley - even though he personally is a good character.  The savvy
&gt; ruthlessness of Travers that we see this episode is what is
&gt; conspicuously absent in Wesley. At a critical point in their
&gt; relationship with their Slayer charges - not one, but two Slayers -
&gt; both with watcher issues that could make them hostile to the WC -
&gt; they send a wet behind the ears goof.  The palpable sense of power
&gt; that Travers exudes this episode is instantly lost and never
&gt; recovered.
">

The other Watchers we've seen or heard about is what makes me think that
the current &quot;hardline&quot; approach epitomized by Quentin may be new and may, in
fact, be Quentin putting his stamp on those in his immediate circle.  That
said, I think Quentin's assignment of Wesley was an error.  Quentin's intent
may have been to send a stuffy, stickler for the established order who is
sufficiently full of himself to stay behind the scenes and dictate to the
Slayers how things should be.   What he got was the &quot;wet behind the ears
goof&quot; who screws up (and knows he screwed up) badly almost right out of the
gate, who gets pulled into &quot;field action&quot; and folds so fast that he can't
even really deceive himself that he wasn't completely out of his depth, and
thus cannot be the aloof order-giver that Quentin may have wanted.

This, of course, is all pure speculation, but fun speculation. ;)

&gt;&gt; Did anyone else think that Angel hit the wrong note with his

&gt; I thought it was... odd.  Didn't quite work for me, though it didn't

Of course we'll never know the true intent, but I tend to think of the
culling as an acceptable, even useful, side effect rather than the primary
purpose.  Incidentally, for the purposes of the story, I think it should be
taken as implicit that the Council has reason to believe the test has
value - based on the thousands of years of experience.  If it always turns
out bad, then even the WC would do something different.  So something
perceived of as good must be a normal outcome.

As for what she's made of, they're looking at a fairly narrow range.  To
survive this long it's probably already accepted that her normal Slayer
powered and watcher trained skills are adequate.  Strength, courage,
technique and so on.  (Besides, in S5 we learn that they have other tests
available for that kind of thing should they deem it necessary.)  Here
they're looking more outside the box - searching for creativity, how she
deals with completely unfamiliar circumstances, and determining if she will
crumble in the face of the seemingly hopeless.  I suspect most of all they
want to find out if she uses her Slayer ability as a tool or a crutch.

I'm sure nobody believes it's a definitive test.  It's so crude that both
good and bad luck must regularly intrude.  But it is an opportunity to
observe a defined condition.  A lot of useful information could come from
it.  While they notified Buffy of the results in a pass/fail context, I
would expect a more nuanced review to occur in the background.  Wesley
should be briefed on the results of that review, hopefully aimed at defining
how best to use Buffy - and to further train her.

Another possibility is that they're using the extremity of the test to help
determine if they have a truly unusual Slayer.  A superstar among Slayers.
(Which Buffy actually is by the standards of this universe.)  That cold have
a profound impact on how they intend to use her.  Lesser Slayers might be
left in standard defensive mode.  But a great one could be targeted against
something bigger.  Go on the offense as it were.

As for trial by ordeal, putting someone into a situation beyond their
previously understood limits is a well recognized way of extending those
limits.  She may very well have had the capability all along, but this
demonstrates it to her, and in so doing gets her to actually utilize that
capability.  Without the test she could continue on acting below her
capacity.  Furthermore, the throw them in and hope they float analogy
doesn't really hold.  Buffy isn't actually helpless.  She's just denied one
set of tools.  She still has others.  She knows a lot about vampires and how
to defeat them.  We see her equip herself effectively with that in mind.
And she's seen her friends - people without Slayer powers - fight vampires
effectively at her side.  She even knows that they have succeeded without
her help at all.  Going into that house without her Slayer powers is not a
hopeless venture, merely more difficult than she has grown accustomed to.

typically a girl had been slayer for three to five years by her eighteenth
if she hasnt learned by then perhaps the best odds are to start with a new slayer
and not waste resources on the current one

remember that not only is there endless supply of slayers

you can see if the next slayer is any better

people are quite capable of cruel brutal decisions

got my slater killed in the line of duty
giles is being sarcastic but this is what watchers actually do
its what he did twice to buffy

travers says the test is of the slayer and the watcher
they need watchers who are willing to make brutal decisions
without restraints about cruelty

we also see that when giles murders ben
ben wasnt bad enough to deserve an execution
yet doing so giles probably saved the lives of hundreds or millions of people

&gt; typically a girl had been slayer for three to five years by her eighteenth

&gt; slayer
&gt; and not waste resources on the current one

Unless the Slayer is actively *avoiding* fights, she's got a few years
experience surviving in the fight against the demons.  That will tell
the Council a lot more about her abilities than any silly test.  If she
is avoiding fights, then they should know, and they can assassinate her.

The incompetent ones eliminate themselves.  Crippled Slayers become easy
prey for the monsters, or can be eliminated directly. No need for a test.

&gt; people are quite capable of cruel brutal decisions

&gt; its what he did twice to buffy

&gt; travers says the test is of the slayer and the watcher
&gt; they need watchers who are willing to make brutal decisions
&gt; without restraints about cruelty

It was a decision to betray his Slayer, for the sake of a pointless
test, not a strategic necessity in the battle against the forces of
darkness.

&gt; we also see that when giles murders ben

Again, clearly not a pointless act.  It was necessary to save lives.

- capture her
torture the hell out of her
but dont kill her
we dont need a new slayer
they cant all be like my faith

whether wilkins was right that killing buffy would call another
at least some villians had been thinking about this

also we only see normal human healing accelerated
not some mystical healing beyond human capabilities
so that if you sever the slayers spine at the right place in the neck
i think you got a quadrapeligic slayer until she dies
or is killed
and an intelligent demon is going to help her survive a long time

or just trap her in an armored car for a few decades

youre starting from the assumption that it is pointless
it does have a purpose

whether that purpose is a good purpose is a separate issue

Which is completely irrelevant to the Cruciamentum.

You are quibbling between the meanings of pointless and stupid.  Fine,
I'll concede.  It's a stupid test, not a pointless one.

That'd be fun fanfic too I think, but from the point of view of creating
BtVS I fail to see what would be advanced by such a background.  The WC
serves symbolic and practical story functions in relationship to Buffy's
development.  They are a major force trying to hold Buffy to the traditional
Slayer mold that Buffy seeks to break free of.  The politics back in London
aren't terribly relevant to the advancement of that story.  What we see in
Sunnydale is the arrival of a silly git - for whatever reason.  The watchers
have survived for thousands of years.  It will later be suggested that their
ancestors created The Slayer.  It will be claimed that they wield enormous
behind the scenes power beyond merely directing The Slayer.  The concept is
of a formidable and ruthless organization not easily tossed aside.  And then
the WC shows up in Sunnydale in the form of Wesley, thereby undermining the
premise of any potency whatsoever.  There will be some effort to recover
ground in Choices, but hardly enough, and that little is thrown away again
in Wesley's final BtVS scenes.

There will be plenty of non-Wesley examples too.  For whatever reason, the
writers chose to play the WC as comically inept.  I think it was a wasted
opportunity and one of the least successful constructs in the series.  It
never reconciles well with the import of watchers themselves in the series
mythos.
