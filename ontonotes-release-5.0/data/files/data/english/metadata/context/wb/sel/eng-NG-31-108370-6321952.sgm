Swetark Ganesha

Madar has a very special significance in Indian herbs. Though it is
poisonous, yet it is full of several benefits. In Ayurveda, medicines
made of its poison are used as life-giving drugs. Among these trees, one
gives white flowers. This tree is called as Swetark. This a very rare
tree.

It is mentioned in our ancient texts, that a house where Swetark Ganesha
is worshipped it gets freedom from from poverty, obstacles, quarrels,
horror and all sorts of negativites. It also gives knowledge and
concentration power to students. It also gives promotion in job and
maintains harmony in married life.

It is essential to chant any of the following Ganesha mantras while
worshipping Swetark Ganesha:
• Om Vakratundaya Namaha
• Om Shree Ganeshaya Namaha

While worshipping Swetark Ganesha, the worshipper may use the following
items:
Red Cloth, Red Aasan, Coral or rudraksha mala

Offer the following to Ganesha:
• Coarse brown sugar / Gur

Namaste Derick, usually 5 beads are required to balance the combination
you have in mind.  You see, the One Mukh should be the Centre Bead. 4
and 6 mukhs are on either side of the chain. That leaves 11 mukh without
another bead on the other side of the chain.

Then again, have a look at the proposed layout below:

Layout One with 11 mukh pendalled above One Mukh.
4         6
11
1

Layout Two
4          6
11         _? (Which other bead would you like to have here?)
1

Please meditate on the above to see what you would like to do.  Shall
tell you the benefits of each mukh bead in the next message.

Namaste Derick,  please scroll below for One Mukh info:
1 Mukhi Rudraksha                       [1 mukhi rudraksha]
The One Mukhi Rudraksha is the symbol of Godhood, Supreme Truth and
Attainment of Eternity. The One Mukhi Rudraksha is itself Lord Shankar
and it is the main among all Rudrakshas of all faces. It is ruled by the
Sun and enlightens the Super Consciousness. It brings the power of
Dharana to the wearer meaning the power to concentrate the mind on an
object. The wearer of One Mukhi Rudraksha gets his mental structure
changed and he begins to feel renunciation from the worldly affairs and
naturally inclines towards GOD. His mind begins to concentrate on the
Supreme Element that is Partattva Dharana cha jayate Tatprakashnam thus
the discoverers of Aatma Tattva must wear One Mukhi Rudraksha.
[Lord Shiva]

This is the best of all Rudrakshas. Peace and pleasure abide in the
house where One Mukhi Rudraksha is worshipped. The person who worships
it obtains not only all the worldly pleasures during his life span but
also remains unaffected by them. One Mukhi Rudraksha is found in two
shapes round and the half moon shape. Round Rudraksha is highly praised
in our ancients texts but it is very rare and more of a myth . One mukhi
Half moon is easily available and found in a family tree of Rudraksha
from India and Srilanka. From the point of view of importance there is
no difference between them. Therefore it must be real and pure in
whatever shape it may be. The cost of One Mukhi Round is more than the
half moon shaped Rudraksha.

Excerpts from Puranas

Srimaddevibhagavat 11th Skand Chapter V verses 25 and 26 it is stated "
According to Jabala instinct for wearing Rudraksha results only after
attaining the perfection of Vedas and blessings of Lord Siva during
preceding births "

In Chapter VII verse 23 it is stated "Rudrakshas infused with Bija
mantras should be worn. One Mukhi Rudraksha helps envisioning the
Partattva "

Padma Purana Chapter 57 Translated by Bhatta 1989 it is stated in verse
38 to 39 " The Rudraksha of one mouth is virtually Siva It removes the
sin of brahmanacide. Therefore one should wear it for the destruction of
all (ones) sins. He would go to Siva's heaven and rejoice with Siva. O
Kartikeya a man would obtain a Rudraksha of one mouth due to great
religious merit and due to Siva's favour and would also obtain Kailasa
".

Namaste,

The first layout is the  one that was suggested to me by
Ms.Neeta  when I sent the information to her , originally I was suppose to
have the 6,4,11 but after doing much reading I descided to add the  1 which
I know would be good for me.what other bead would you suggest that I have, I
have  sent the order after she sent me a  picture of the design, my initial
thing was to add the 10 that I already have but  descided to wear that as a
stand alone.  I hope this would not put the combination out of balance and
get negative affects.

Namaste Derick, sincerely would suggest you stick to the First Layout
recommended by Ms Neetaji as she is one of the greatest experts in
rudraksh. With the first layout, the One Mukh can be pendalled below
the 11 mukh bead. How do you feel about this? You must also let your
instinct guide you, just like you feel strongly about adding the One
Mukh as you have a "Knowing" that it will be good for you. This is
one of the ways our Upaguru or Inner Guru guides us. There are never
any negative effects from wearing rudraksh, no matter how the
combination is made. What I meant by "balance" is that of the
physical or aesthetic.  Assuring you that the spiritual balance will
still be there nevertheless.

Properties of Different Mukh Beads
----------------------------------
7 mukhi Rudraksha is the symbol of Anang shiva. Seven faced rudraksha
is saptmatradhi Daivat, saptashyadevat and saptmuni Daivat. It
represents Goddess Mahalaxmi. Good health and wealth is blesses to
him who wears Seven Faced Rudraksha. Those who are suffering from
miseries pertaining to body, finance and mental set-up should wear
it. By wearing seven face Rudraksha man can progress in business and
service and spend his life happily. Seven mukhi rudraksha may be worn
on a regular basis. It affects entire psychological and physical
neurophysiology. It sublimates the malefic effects of Shani. There is
no taboo written in authentic Puranas to be followed while wearing
them. They have a life of thousand years if well taken care of. They
should be preserved in a locker or at some safe place since they are
considered as very valuable.

Represents: Goddess Mahalaxmi
Ruling Planet: Saturn (Shani)
Recommended for: Weakness, colic pain, handicapness, pain in bone
and muscles, paralysis, long term disease, impotency, worries and
hopelessness.
Mantras :   Om Mahalakshmi Namah
or
Om Hum Namah

http://www.rudraksha-ratna.com/7mukhi.htm

=================

8 mukhi Rudraksha is the second form of reflection of the first son
of Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesh and is one who is worshipped prior to
other gods. Eight linings present on it makes it a very effective
Rudraksha. Its wearer becomes unaffected by miseries – physical,
divine or mental. It sets the wearer free from the sin caused by
telling a lie. It gives the wearer all kinds of attainments –
Riddhies and Siddhies and leads him to Shivloka. His opponents are
finished i.e. the minds or intentions of his opponents are changed
and all obstacles in his path are removed. Ruling planet is Rahu
hence helpful in sublimating the malefic effects of Rahu. It's
malefic effects are similar to that of Shani or Saturn as in 7 mukhi.
It is held responsible for causing sudden effects. Snake bites are
also the result of malefic effects of Rahu. Wearing 8 faced rudraksha
keeps a check on the malefic effects of the planet Rahu. Ideal for
writers and intellectuals.

Represents: Lord Ganesh
Ruling Planet: Rahu
Recommended for: Lung, feet, skin and eye catarrhisis, hydrocel,
airtracia.
Mantras:    Om Ganeshaya Namah
or
Om Hum Namah
