Hi, all,
I guess I'll bust out the Zipps. I figure it's a good excuse to buy some Zipp
brake pads. I'm getting the new shifters, cables, chaine etc. put on Friday.
For those new to racing I recommend doing maintenance like this at the
beginning of the season b/c it really stinks to have a mechanical (shifter
cables breaking--I've had this happen 2x) during a race.

I'm am totally into carpooling, and would gladly pay my part of the gas.

Best,
Robert

I'm into carpooling also, but I want to ride the loop again after
the race, slowly. With that in mind, I will drive or ride, it
doesn't matter. I have a Jetta stationwagon with a bike rack for 2
bikes and plenty of room for a couple of trainers and stuff. I live
on 22nd st near Eastside Cafe.

I probably will not be down for more miles and I will need to get back home as soon as possible.  I fly out to Ohio State University Monday for a business trip and my wife recently blew out her ACL so I need to get back and relieve her from baby duty ASAP.

I can just drive that way no one will have to worry about my schedule.  I will see you all there Sunday morning!!!kirk

We can ride together.  I have a jeep liberty, no bike rack but with the seats down in the back i think we can fit 2 bikes and gear.  Where do you live?  I'm at Mo Pac and 360 by Barton Skyway.

Sounds great, Kirk.  I live off of Lamar just north of Koenig, so it'd probably make sense for me to meet you at your place, since you're south.  Is everybody bringing trainers, or just riding around to warm up?  I have rollers, but I may need a little help getting on lol!
Hey Robert, good call on the maintenance issues.  Thanks for sharing!  I took my bike into BSSN, and it needs:  new chain, new cables/housing, and shifting adjustments (not to mention a good cleaning!)

i have a couple of rookie questions about racing and riding in general.

1. how do you ensure you have enough fluids during a race?  in the case of my race last sunday i had a 24 oz bottle of water and a 20 oz bottle of gatorade on my bike and ran out of fluids with many miles left to go.  i can't imagine what it would be like if this was a race with real mileage!  this weekend i intend to bring an extra bottle and put in my jersey pocket.  i have used a camel back for longer rides and use one every time i go mountain biking; i don't need the extra weight while on the road bike and not to mention that it's just NOT done in road racing.  any suggestions?

2. what methods have ya'll used to keep from cramping during races or longer rides?  i bring the gatorade with the electrolytes in it and i eat foods and take in fluids like fig newtons and cran-rasberry that are high in potassium and sodium leading up to the ride/race, but still experience issues.  i've heard about electrolyte tablets and for fun rides like wurst ride they serve pickles at the rest stops which help, but my real concern is while racing.

3. pre race riding, i know there are many different theories out there most people encourage you to ride up to the day before the ride, however i usually feel better the day of the event if i stop riding 2 days prior.  but feeling like i needed to make up some ground fitness wise, i rode last saturday for about an hour, and race day i was a little sore and did not feel in top form.  typically what i do if the event is on sunday i ride really hard up to thursday and then i stop riding and focus on carbo loading up to the night before the race then i eat light the day of the event drinking plenty of fluids upt o an hour before event.  i try to eat something like 5-10 minutes pre-event. what usually works best for ya'll?

thanks for your help, i'm sure i will have more questions later.

My two cents below.  I'm sure others have good suggestions, too.

How long a race? (# of hours)  There are two strategies:
1) Pre-hydrate
2) Train your body to get by with less

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2. what methods have ya'll used to keep from cramping during races or

longer rides?  i bring the gatorade with the electrolytes in it

Off-the-shelf gatorade is hopelessly low in sodium, one of the most
important nutrients to stave off cramping.  I can't stand the taste of
Gatorade, but &quot;Gatorade Endurance&quot; at least has more sodium.  You can also
take tablets, but it's easier if the sodium is already in your drink.  (This
all presumes that your doctor hasn't told you to avoid sodium.)  Personally,
I strongly prefer eLoad and it has worked wonders (sometimes I add the
brand's mineral capsules, too).  Some (not I) find that a little protein in
their drink helps them.

People sweat at different rates and depending on the heat/humidity.  I've
developed a sense of what works for me and personally consume about 16 oz
per hour, up to 32 oz when it's really hot out.

Weigh yourself before and after the race.  If you've lost or gained more
than 2-3% of your body weight from fluids, you've probably exceeded your
optimum tolerance.

prior.

Everybody's different and each have different recovery periods.  It is good
to get some movement the recovery days immediately prior.  Easy spinning at
a &quot;walking&quot; effort is all that's necessary, but try to get at least 30-45
minutes of it.

Careful with carb loading.  It really doesn't require &quot;pigging out&quot;, just
enough to store up some glycogen in the muscles.

Personally, I like my stomach empty and I only eat oatmeal for breakfast and
carry a CLIF bar to eat after the first 2 hours, then every hour.  I also
have a gel after 90 minutes, then every 60 minutes.

Don't over think any of this.  The real work is in the training.

Daniel's comments are all good.  I would add a few more tips:
1.  I make up my own endurance drink, using table salt, fruit juice (I prefer pomegranate because it has carbs, lots of potassium and anti-oxidants), and a little protein powder.  But YMMV.  If you like the taste of Gatorade, just add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt (590mg of sodium) to a bottle and use that.  If it tastes like sweat, you know you're on the right track.  But try it before hand - if you won't drink it because you don't like how it tastes, you don't come out ahead.  ;-)
2.  If you expect to have trouble staying hydrated because of heat, or because prior experience says so,  drink a half-bottle or even a full bottle just before the race starts.  Just don't drink so much that you need a pee stop in 30 minutes.  But starting well hydrated can really help a lot.
3.  My best plans for pre-race week are to do fairly short, hard workouts on, say, M, W, F for a Saturday race.  Rest Thursday, not Friday, then do a short workout Friday (perhaps half of what you'd normally do on a weekday). All you want to do on that Friday ride is get get your muscles awake and pumping, then cool down and stop.  Race Saturday.
The latest research says rest the SECOND day before the race, not the day before.  Seems our fatigue is more determined by rest two days before than by the day before.  My own experience bears this out for me, but as Daniel says, try stuff to see what works for you.

Weigh yourself before and after the race.  If you've lost or gained more than 2-3% of your body weight from fluids, you've probably exceeded your optimum tolerance.

Hi, all,
Kirk, these are all great questions. There are some basic rules of thumb
which I think Stanton can speak to, and I will attempt. Some of these issues
are up to the individual.  Here's my stab at your questions.

1. Since it's been dry, it makes sense that hydration is something of an
issue even though it's not hot. I try to hydrate a lot in the 3 days up to an
event. For Saturday 2 bottles should be enough. It will be a fast race, and
you may not even get much of a chance to think about drinking.

2. I experience cramps for 2 reasons. A) Electrolyte imbalance. I've been
fairly successful with Nuun tablets in water. There's no sugar, and it tastes
good. B) The other reason I get cramps is that I am stressing my body beyond
where it's trained. The solution there is fairly simple--get in shape. I do
weights,leg presses and leg lifts which help too.

3. It depends on the race. Since this race is a &quot;C&quot; race for me, I'm doing it
for fun, and to get in the groove. Plus I read an article in Procycling
recently where Greg Lemond speaks a lot about high intensity efforts, and few
things in training simulate the stresses of racing. If it's a &quot;C&quot; or &quot;B&quot; race
I tend to &quot;train through&quot; meaning I don't significantly alter my training
program for the race. If it's an &quot;A&quot; race like Hammerfest, I taper for the
race.

Both you and Jake are fairly strong riders. The key as you know is not to
crash and not to get dropped. Everything else gets sorted out at the end on
these short races. It's rare for short races for there to be  a break away
that sticks thought it happens.  Let's have fun in preparation for the big
fish in this case it would be Fayetteveill and Hammerfest.

Good questions.

Best,
Robert

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; i have a couple of rookie questions about racing and riding in general.

&gt; 1. how do you ensure you have enough fluids during a race?  in the case of
&gt; my race last sunday i had a 24 oz bottle of water and a 20 oz bottle of
&gt; gatorade on my bike and ran out of fluids with many miles left to go.  i
&gt; can't imagine what it would be like if this was a race with real mileage!
&gt; this weekend i intend to bring an extra bottle and put in my jersey pocket.
&gt;  i have used a camel back for longer rides and use one every time i go
&gt; mountain biking; i don't need the extra weight while on the road bike and
&gt; not to mention that it's just NOT done in road racing.  any suggestions?

&gt; 2. what methods have ya'll used to keep from cramping during races or
&gt; longer rides?  i bring the gatorade with the electrolytes in it and i eat
&gt; foods and take in fluids like fig newtons and cran-rasberry that are high
&gt; in potassium and sodium leading up to the ride/race, but still experience
&gt; issues.  i've heard about electrolyte tablets and for fun rides like wurst
&gt; ride they serve pickles at the rest stops which help, but my real concern
&gt; is while racing.

&gt; 3. pre race riding, i know there are many different theories out there most
&gt; people encourage you to ride up to the day before the ride, however i
&gt; usually feel better the day of the event if i stop riding 2 days prior.
&gt; but feeling like i needed to make up some ground fitness wise, i rode last
&gt; saturday for about an hour, and race day i was a little sore and did not
&gt; feel in top form.  typically what i do if the event is on sunday i ride
&gt; really hard up to thursday and then i stop riding and focus on carbo
&gt; loading up to the night before the race then i eat light the day of the
&gt; event drinking plenty of fluids upt o an hour before event.  i try to eat
&gt; something like 5-10 minutes pre-event. what usually works best for ya'll?

&gt; thanks for your help, i'm sure i will have more questions later.

Hydration: over the past 2-6 weeks I've tried several things which might be of interest this weekend.

a. Pre-hydrate. Pee. Pre-hydrate. Drink additional water for 1-2 days before the event. Reduce Coffee and tea. Immediately before the race keep drinking water and pee as often as you need. 5 minutes before the gun, guzzle 1/2 bottle or more of water.
b. Nunns tablets are excellent they go in the water you're drinking the morning of the race. Also &quot;Sports Legs&quot; are a pill you take the morning of the race (get Nunns and Sports Legs at Bicycle Sports Shop).
c. I have also taken one or two &quot;Tums&quot; before big events just to be safe.
d. I also take a flask or two of Hammer Gel in my jersey pockets. I also take a couple of Gu or Cliff Shots taped to the bike's top tube or stem (or if you prefer stuff a Gu or Cliff shot under the leg of your shorts).
Also, don't eat a big meal right before the ride. Better a light breakfast - 2-3 hours before.
Workouts during the week before the race should be short and light.

Actually, if you want to get the most out of your enhanced Gatorade, mix up a salt mix consisting of 1 part salt substitute (potassium chloride) with 3 parts tabls salt.  This is the original Gatorade formula that replaces the potassium as well as sodium salts.  Use this mix and follow Daniel's instructions below.

Another suggestion I have heard in the past is to eat a protien rich breakfast at least 2 hours before a race or long ride to minimize cramping.  Part of the cause of cramping is fuel deprivation.  I have had some good success with this and suffer more from cramps when I skip the eggs with breakfast.  I also supplement my Gatorade mix wth a small addition (1 TBSP per bottle) of protien powder.  Gatorade is coming out with a performance Gatorade mix with protien added as well as the additional salt.

Actually, if you want to get the most out of your enhanced Gatorade, mix up a salt mix consisting of 1 part salt substitute (potassium chloride) with 3 parts tabls salt. This is the original Gatorade formula that replaces the potassium as well as sodium salts.

Magnesium is also important to ward off cramping.  It also helps to take
herbals that shift the metabolism more toward fat burning.

i came across this during some research and a suggestion from one of the riders in the tour das.  i may try this because you can customize and it takes into consideration osmolality which is important because your body can only absorb at a certain rate.  they describe it as having too much &quot;stuff&quot; in your drink; i.e. carbs, electrolytes, protein etc...

does anyone have any experience with this product?

At $1.55 per 16 oz for that, vs 75 cents for eLoad, I'm sticking with eLoad.

James and I use something called Essentials, which is absorbed faster than
anything else out there.  It is complete nutrition and requires almost no
digestion because the proteins come as polypeptides, and the fatty acids are
nanoized, water soluble and pass right into the blood stream.  I don¹t use
anything else anymore.

Take care!

Hi all,
does anyone know if I can get my racing license for the year online and use it for this Sunday's race? I was just going to get a day license, but since I'm planning on doing more races, the full year license makes sense.  Where is this license to be found?
thanks,
jake

Actually, if you want to get the most out of your enhanced Gatorade, mix up a salt mix consisting of 1 part salt substitute (potassium chloride) with 3 parts tabls salt. This is the original Gatorade formula that replaces the potassium as well as sodium salts. Use this mix and follow Daniel's instructions below.

Go to https://www.usacycling.org and get your license.  They will then direct
you to a page that you can print out to prove that you have your license, which
you can use until your card arrives in the mail.
