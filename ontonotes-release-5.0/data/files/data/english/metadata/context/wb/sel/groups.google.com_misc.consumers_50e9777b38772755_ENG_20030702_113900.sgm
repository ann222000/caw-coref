Infuriating Billboard Posted By: Lindy B. (cpe-66-27-38-253.socal.rr.com)
Date: July 2, 14:21

I was driving home from class today and passed a billboard that read:
&quot;Running sucks. Being a fat slob sucks worse.&quot; The ad showed a running shoe
-- it was for Avia shoes and also had Sport Chalet on it.
(This was in the San Fernando Valley, about a mile away from a competing
sporting goods chain). I'm not a big fan of running -- I prefer walking,
hiking and swimming -- but it pisses me off -- the pairing of the words
&quot;fat&quot; and &quot;slob&quot; just to sell their stinkin' shoes. They could have made
the same point in a much less damaging way. Or if they are really enamored
of that marketing campaign, don't put it on a billboard, for goodness sake,
put it in a very targeted running magazine. This just sends a hurtful,
damaging message to a general audience. I want to respond in a thoughtful,
impactful way that shows my anger. Any suggestions?
I'm still really pissed off. --Lindy B.

"/> I suggest a total proactive response. Buy a billboard nest to theirs. Show
several ample proportioned women roasting a skinny runner on a spit over a

The bold message across the billboard would read,

Runners Suck, But Being Hungry Is Even Worse.

Which Is Why We Eat The Runners.

And The Runners Wearing Avia Shoes Are Easiest To Catch

Are you a fat slob? Do you love a fat slob perhaps? Is that why you were
offended? My suggestion is quit cross-posting your
pissy-whiny-fatslobloving garbage and lift some weights. Oh, and aliens are
going to eat the fat ones first.

"/> Mike, this guy is 100% GOOD USENET.

Here's a conundrum, fat slobs: are you exerciseophobic?

The answer, wideload size 38 stretchpants, is clearly YES - otherwise they
would not be fat slobs.

&gt; Date: July 2, 14:21

&gt; I was driving home from class today and passed a billboard that read:
&gt;&quot;Running sucks. Being a fat slob sucks worse.&quot; The ad showed a running
shoe
&gt; -- it was for Avia shoes and also had Sport Chalet on it.
&gt; (This was in the San Fernando Valley, about a mile away from a competing
&gt; sporting goods chain). I'm not a big fan of running -- I prefer walking,
&gt; hiking and swimming -- but it pisses me off -- the pairing of the words
&gt;&quot;fat&quot; and &quot;slob&quot; just to sell their stinkin' shoes. They could have made
&gt; the same point in a much less damaging way. Or if they are really enamored
&gt; of that marketing campaign, don't put it on a billboard, for goodness
sake,
&gt; put it in a very targeted running magazine. This just sends a hurtful,
&gt; damaging message to a general audience. I want to respond in a thoughtful,

&gt; Date: July 2, 14:21

&gt; I was driving home from class today and passed a billboard that read:
&gt;&quot;Running sucks. Being a fat slob sucks worse.&quot; The ad showed a running
shoe
&gt; -- it was for Avia shoes and also had Sport Chalet on it.
&gt; (This was in the San Fernando Valley, about a mile away from a competing
&gt; sporting goods chain). I'm not a big fan of running -- I prefer walking,
&gt; hiking and swimming -- but it pisses me off -- the pairing of the words
&gt;&quot;fat&quot; and &quot;slob&quot; just to sell their stinkin' shoes. They could have made
&gt; the same point in a much less damaging way. Or if they are really enamored
&gt; of that marketing campaign, don't put it on a billboard, for goodness
sake,
&gt; put it in a very targeted running magazine. This just sends a hurtful,
&gt; damaging message to a general audience. I want to respond in a thoughtful,
&gt; impactful way that shows my anger. Any suggestions?
&gt; I'm still really pissed off. --Lindy B.

"/> So, being a fat slob doesn't suck worse than running? Or cardio in general?

&gt;&gt;That just proves that so called &quot;educated&quot; idiots are still idiots.

&gt;How so?

"/> Education should enlighten people as to the evils of bigotry. I find
that in some, education merely solidifies their inflated sense of
superiority to the point where everyone around them is inferior.

There is no enlightenment for these kind of people. One needn't like
everyone. The only requirement is tolerance. These fools don't know
how to do that and that makes them sad people indeed.

&gt; Date: July 2, 14:21

"/> Billboard, hosted on private property for paying customer, exercises
freedom of expression; infuriates fat slob Lindy B!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I was driving home from class today and passed a billboard that read:
&gt;&quot;Running sucks. Being a fat slob sucks worse.&quot; The ad showed a running shoe
&gt; -- it was for Avia shoes and also had Sport Chalet on it.

"/> I would not buy shoes from a company that believes that running sucks.
Maybe running sucks because they wear their own shoes!

This part of the statement is where they dropped the ball. They have
damaged their credibility among people who love running.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (This was in the San Fernando Valley, about a mile away from a competing
&gt; sporting goods chain). I'm not a big fan of running -- I prefer walking,
&gt; hiking and swimming -- but it pisses me off -- the pairing of the words
&gt;&quot;fat&quot; and &quot;slob&quot; just to sell their stinkin' shoes. They could have made
&gt; the same point in a much less damaging way.

"/> What damage? Words cannot do any damage, only actions. (Of course,
words *can* damage the speaker's or writer's credibility).

What's damaging is Lindy's obesity, not the painful reminder of it!

It's the *lard* that will kill her in the long run, not the billboard.
The billboard got her all worked up, which increased her heart rate
and improved her cardiovascular function! It did her good!

If being fat did not suck, then the billboard wouldn't upset her. If
the billboard said ``being fit and trim sucks'', would fit and trim
people get offended? No, because they would just laugh it off as
obvious nonsense! But you can't laugh off this billboard as obvious
nonsense. Obesity is a serious, nation-wide health crisis in the
United States and elsewhere.

Lindy in fact *agrees* with the billboard, but the immature brat in
her wants to lash out against anything that gives rise to an intrusion
of an uncomfortable truth into her life.

She should do a web search for the phrase ``cognitive dissonance''.
It's a discomfort that one experiences when confronted with facts that
are contrary to what you believe or what you do. The only rational,
productive way to eliminate that discomfort is to accept the truth,
and change your behavior. There are other outcomes, such as continued
denial, endless rationalizations of the discrepancy, etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Or if they are really enamored
&gt; of that marketing campaign, don't put it on a billboard, for goodness sake,
&gt; put it in a very targeted running magazine.

"/> No, that kind of ad belongs in a magazine for the diet-and-weight
obsessed. Maybe _Shape_ or something like that. Not a running
magazine. Real runners are interested in improving their speed and
endurance, not weight loss. Weight loss happens by itself; when you
become a runner, you eventually acquire the body of a runner---you are
what you do. If you are a slob, you look like one. If you are a figure
skater, you look like one. Dancer, swimmer, ditto, etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This just sends a hurtful,
&gt; damaging message to a general audience.

"/> Waaah! Sniff.

I propose this revision:

``Running is great! Being a self-pitying, everyone-else-blaming fat
slob in denial is a private disaster.''

&gt;&gt; I was driving home from class today and passed a billboard that
&gt;&gt; read: &quot;Running sucks. Being a fat slob sucks worse.&quot;

&gt;Sounds about right. So?

&gt;&gt;The ad showed a running shoe
&gt;&gt; -- it was for Avia shoes and also had Sport Chalet on it.
&gt;&gt; (This was in the San Fernando Valley, about a mile away from a
&gt;&gt; competing sporting goods chain). I'm not a big fan of running -- I
&gt;&gt; prefer walking, hiking and swimming -- but it pisses me off -- the
&gt;&gt; pairing of the words &quot;fat&quot; and &quot;slob&quot; just to sell their stinkin'
&gt;&gt; shoes.

&gt;Offensive, but true and effective.

"/> No. It is neither true nor effective. Your decision to buy into idiot
propaganda is no one else's problem but yours. If you really thought
it offensive you would not buy into it. Hygiene or housekeeping
habits are not partial to size.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; They could have made
&gt;&gt; the same point in a much less damaging way.

&gt;Damaging?

"/> Yes. Damaging. It is just like saying that all blacks have tails or
that all thin people are idiots.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;Or if they are really enamored
&gt;&gt; of that marketing campaign, don't put it on a billboard, for
&gt;&gt; goodness sake, put it in a very targeted running magazine. This
&gt;&gt; just sends a hurtful, damaging message to a general audience.

&gt;Of fat slobs?

"/> See? You weren't offended at all. Liar.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I want to respond in a thoughtful,
&gt;&gt; impactful way that shows my anger. Any suggestions?

&gt;Get running...

"/> Not everyone can run. Not every one can shoot his mouth off like you
and be told to go fellate a rifle.

So, what are you waiting for?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I'm still really pissed off. --Lindy B.

"/> And she should be-royally. I could be really posting stupid and say I
despise thin people because they are narrow-minded prepubescent
retards that don't know their asses from a hole in the ground simply
because the $3 Queer AKA NR is.....but I won't sink to his
level......he is a nasty hedonistic reprobate that should be used for
an elephant dildo...but that is ONLY him-and marty the maggot. (or

&gt;Billboard, hosted on private property for paying customer, exercises
&gt;freedom of expression; infuriates fat slob Lindy B!

"/> For public viewing, fuckwit. That makes a difference.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I was driving home from class today and passed a billboard that
&gt;&gt; read: &quot;Running sucks. Being a fat slob sucks worse.&quot; The ad showed
&gt;&gt; a running shoe -- it was for Avia shoes and also had Sport Chalet
&gt;&gt; on it.

&gt;I would not buy shoes from a company that believes that running
&gt;sucks. Maybe running sucks because they wear their own shoes!

"/> With that kind of ad campaign, I am not surprised.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;This part of the statement is where they dropped the ball. They have
&gt;damaged their credibility among people who love running.

"/> Who obviously don't give a damn about who they hurt. Your brain fall
and you accidently stepped on it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; (This was in the San Fernando Valley, about a mile away from a
&gt;&gt; competing sporting goods chain). I'm not a big fan of running -- I
&gt;&gt; prefer walking, hiking and swimming -- but it pisses me off -- the
&gt;&gt; pairing of the words &quot;fat&quot; and &quot;slob&quot; just to sell their stinkin'
&gt;&gt; shoes. They could have made the same point in a much less damaging
&gt;&gt; way.

&gt;What damage? Words cannot do any damage, only actions. (Of course,
&gt;words *can* damage the speaker's or writer's credibility).

"/> You just sold your soul to say that? You are your own best argument.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;What's damaging is Lindy's obesity, not the painful reminder of it!

"/> Get a life. She does not need to be reminded that she is fat. She
knows that already. That is not even the issue here. The issue is
insulting a whole group of people just to sell shoes.....you seem to
be a selfish sort, you know?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;It's the *lard* that will kill her in the long run, not the
&gt;billboard.

"/> It is your postings that will do you in....becuase you probably feel
that way in real life and there is nothing more dangerous than a fat
person carrying heat.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The billboard got her all worked up, which increased her heart rate
&gt;and improved her cardiovascular function! It did her good!

"/> Oh go fuck a duck.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;If being fat did not suck, then the billboard wouldn't upset her. If
&gt;the billboard said ``being fit and trim sucks'', would fit and trim
&gt;people get offended? No, because they would just laugh it off as
&gt;obvious nonsense! But you can't laugh off this billboard as obvious
&gt;nonsense. Obesity is a serious, nation-wide health crisis in the
&gt;United States and elsewhere.

"/> Oh bullshit. Thin people would get just as offended because they are
in the throes of rabid self-denial to get society's approval. She is
a fickle mistress, isn't she?

Fuckwit...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Lindy in fact *agrees* with the billboard, but the immature brat in
&gt;her wants to lash out against anything that gives rise to an
&gt;intrusion of an uncomfortable truth into her life.

"/> What a maroon..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;She should do a web search for the phrase ``cognitive dissonance''.
&gt;It's a discomfort that one experiences when confronted with facts
&gt;that are contrary to what you believe or what you do. The only
&gt;rational,
&gt;productive way to eliminate that discomfort is to accept the truth,
&gt;and change your behavior. There are other outcomes, such as
&gt;continued denial, endless rationalizations of the discrepancy, etc.

"/> The only truth here is there are idiots in this world. You are a
perfect example.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Or if they are really enamored
&gt;&gt; of that marketing campaign, don't put it on a billboard, for
&gt;&gt; goodness sake, put it in a very targeted running magazine.

&gt;No, that kind of ad belongs in a magazine for the diet-and-weight
&gt;obsessed. Maybe _Shape_ or something like that. Not a running
&gt;magazine. Real runners are interested in improving their speed and
&gt;endurance, not weight loss. Weight loss happens by itself; when you
&gt;become a runner, you eventually acquire the body of a runner---you
&gt;are what you do. If you are a slob, you look like one. If you are a
&gt;figure skater, you look like one. Dancer, swimmer, ditto, etc.

"/> YOu just stated the core belief in the size acceptance movement.
&quot;Weight loss happens by itself.&quot;

You just screwed yourself. Congratulations and kudos to the $3Queer!
You just screwed him too :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; This just sends a hurtful,
&gt;&gt; damaging message to a general audience.

&gt;Waaah! Sniff.

"/> See above.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;I propose this revision:

&gt; ``Running is great! Being a self-pitying, everyone-else-blaming
&gt; fat
&gt; slob in denial is a private disaster.''

"/> No. &quot;Running is great! Being a fat-phobic idiot can get you an early
funeral from a fat person carrying heat is a preventable cause of
death.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Infuriating Billboard Posted By: Lindy B.
&gt;&gt;&gt;(cpe-66-27-38-253.socal.rr.com) Date: July 2, 14:21

&gt;&gt;&gt;I was driving home from class today and passed a billboard that
&gt;&gt;&gt;read: &quot;Running sucks. Being a fat slob sucks worse.&quot; The ad
&gt;&gt;&gt;showed a running
&gt;shoe
&gt;&gt;&gt;-- it was for Avia shoes and also had Sport Chalet on it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;(This was in the San Fernando Valley, about a mile away from a
&gt;&gt;&gt;competing sporting goods chain). I'm not a big fan of running --
&gt;&gt;&gt;I prefer walking, hiking and swimming -- but it pisses me off --
&gt;&gt;&gt;the pairing of the words &quot;fat&quot; and &quot;slob&quot; just to sell their
&gt;&gt;&gt;stinkin' shoes. They could have made the same point in a much
&gt;&gt;&gt;less damaging way. Or if they are really
&gt;enamored
&gt;&gt;&gt;of that marketing campaign, don't put it on a billboard, for
&gt;&gt;&gt;goodness
&gt;sake,
&gt;&gt;&gt;put it in a very targeted running magazine. This just sends a
&gt;&gt;&gt;hurtful, damaging message to a general audience. I want to
&gt;&gt;&gt;respond in a
&gt;thoughtful,
&gt;&gt;&gt;impactful way that shows my anger. Any suggestions?
&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm still really pissed off. --Lindy B.

&gt;&gt; I feel your angst. Maybe if you have a few twinkies and drive
&gt;&gt; home a different route, you'll feel better.

&gt;and being critical of fat does not make one 'phobic'. that's a buch
&gt;of PC crap. if one is scared of fat people that makes on 'phobic'.
&gt;if one merely thinks that being fat sucks, and that running can help
&gt;make one not fat, that is called being pragmatic and realistic.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Infuriating Billboard Posted By: Lindy B. (cpe-66-27-38-253.socal.rr.com)
&gt;&gt;&gt;Date: July 2, 14:21

&gt;&gt;&gt;I was driving home from class today and passed a billboard that read:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Running sucks. Being a fat slob sucks worse.&quot; The ad showed a running
&gt; shoe
&gt;&gt;&gt;-- it was for Avia shoes and also had Sport Chalet on it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;(This was in the San Fernando Valley, about a mile away from a competing
&gt;&gt;&gt;sporting goods chain). I'm not a big fan of running -- I prefer walking,
&gt;&gt;&gt;hiking and swimming -- but it pisses me off -- the pairing of the words
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;fat&quot; and &quot;slob&quot; just to sell their stinkin' shoes. They could have made
&gt;&gt;&gt;the same point in a much less damaging way. Or if they are really
&gt; enamored
&gt;&gt;&gt;of that marketing campaign, don't put it on a billboard, for goodness
&gt; sake,
&gt;&gt;&gt;put it in a very targeted running magazine. This just sends a hurtful,
&gt;&gt;&gt;damaging message to a general audience. I want to respond in a
&gt; thoughtful,
&gt;&gt;&gt;impactful way that shows my anger. Any suggestions?
&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm still really pissed off. --Lindy B.

&gt;&gt; I feel your angst. Maybe if you have a few twinkies and drive home a
&gt;&gt; different route, you'll feel better.

&gt; and being critical of fat does not make one 'phobic'. that's a buch of PC

&gt; thinks that being fat sucks, and that running can help make one not fat,

&gt;&gt; Well, if you want to just go through life hating yourself because
&gt;&gt; society says you should-be my guest. Me, I have better things to
&gt;&gt; to-like horsw-whipping idiots.

&gt;Look here, young lady, I don't hate myself. I hate this 2 kg of
&gt;lard around my middle that I have to lug every single kilometre I
&gt;run. I don't want it to be there.

"/> So get rid of it already. Just don't ridicule fat people in the
process.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Infuriating Billboard Posted By: Lindy B.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(cpe-66-27-38-253.socal.rr.com) Date: July 2, 14:21

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I was driving home from class today and passed a billboard that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;read: &quot;Running sucks. Being a fat slob sucks worse.&quot; The ad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;showed a running
&gt;&gt;shoe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-- it was for Avia shoes and also had Sport Chalet on it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(This was in the San Fernando Valley, about a mile away from a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;competing sporting goods chain). I'm not a big fan of running --
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I prefer walking, hiking and swimming -- but it pisses me off --
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the pairing of the words &quot;fat&quot; and &quot;slob&quot; just to sell their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stinkin' shoes. They could have made the same point in a much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;less damaging way. Or if they are really
&gt;&gt;enamored
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of that marketing campaign, don't put it on a billboard, for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;goodness
&gt;&gt;sake,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;put it in a very targeted running magazine. This just sends a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hurtful, damaging message to a general audience. I want to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;respond in a
&gt;&gt;thoughtful,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;impactful way that shows my anger. Any suggestions?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm still really pissed off. --Lindy B.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I feel your angst. Maybe if you have a few twinkies and drive
&gt;&gt;&gt; home a different route, you'll feel better.

&gt;&gt;and being critical of fat does not make one 'phobic'. that's a buch
&gt;&gt;of PC crap. if one is scared of fat people that makes on 'phobic'.
&gt;&gt;if one merely thinks that being fat sucks, and that running can help
&gt;&gt;make one not fat, that is called being pragmatic and realistic.

&gt;&gt;whit

&gt; You might have more credibility if you didn't insert ridicule and
&gt; opposed ridicule.

"/> i am ridiculing the concept of 'fatphobic' to describe people.

that is also, imo, unjustified ridicule. because somebdoy disagrees with
you vis a vis fat, does not make one 'phobic'

So you don't want to be fat and you are trying to

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; be an athlete. That is OK...not everyone can do that. Ridicule is not
&gt; acceptable, especially in a support group. Check where you are cross
&gt; posting.

&gt; LV

"/> and check yourself before you wreck yourself. belittling those who disagree
with you on concepts, by calling them phobic is what was initially done.
and i responded. if their POV is wrong, then attack them with ideas, not
with labels that have no validity

Satire and parody, both forms are ridicule, are time honored ways to
make a point. Mel Brooks is packing them in every night, at a hundred
bucks a ticket, to see a play that ridicule hitler, political
correctness, politics, the theater community, etc. Only an idiot
would say Mel was an idiot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Just do not become an idiot.

&gt;&gt;You mean, by refusing to trim posts and having an obese sig that
&gt;&gt;takes up a screen and a half? That kind of idiot?

&gt;Ok. this is where you stop flogging the dead horse. If you don't like
&gt;my sig-kill file me. As I am doing to you NOW.

"/> Just pointing out what kind of idiot you are. There are standards of
behavior on usenet, and one of those simple standards is to keep your
sig file a reasonable length. You don't. Therefore, you are an
idiot.

Allisson is from soc.singles, a regular there (at least as of several

Steve Chaney exists. His main role is as a target.

He has the bad, typical trollish habit of refusing to admit when he's

instance, he continued to insist that he saw me at a party when I was
a couple of thousand miles away that entire weekend, and everybody
