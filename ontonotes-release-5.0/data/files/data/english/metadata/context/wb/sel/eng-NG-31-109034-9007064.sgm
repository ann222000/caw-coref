Greetings and salutations.

This is a two-parter: first, we need a convincing scenario for a WWI-
equivalent in which the US and the Confederacy go to war as allies of
opposing European blocks. The alliances do not have to be the same as
in Turtledove or for that matter as OTL in Europe.

The second part will deal with a scenario for a second round between
the US and the Confederacy (no Nazi paralells needed) but should wait
until we have a first-half scenario we can agree with.

(A Confederate-German alliance? As OTL, the Germans want an ally to
keep the US off their backs. OTOH, what can the Germans, cut off from
the Americas by the British navy, do to help the Confederates?)

One possibility (which I haven't researched, so it's very tentative):
Civil war in Mexico, which sucks in other Latin American countries on
one side or the other, European countries with colonies in the Americas
south of the US/CSA, then ones without colonies -- and the US and CSA.

OK. Back when Turtledove was popular here, I pointed out that the
power blocs in the series were goofy.

So; taking from Chet, crazed grieving Lincoln loses the Civil War.
Subsequently, the CSA attempts to prop up Maximilian, winning the
northern tier of Mexican states. Blaine leads a war in the 1870's,
which doesn't ignite intervention but leaves the Confederacy sore and
hurting, and North America gets its own arms race. West Virginia is
marginally enlarged, while a pro-Union part of Tennessee and Kentucky
&quot;return&quot; to the Union.

The US has much warmer relations with Russia than in OTL. Though no
formal alliance is signed, the purchase of Alaska, among other things,
has made both powers happy to act bilaterally, given the tepid
affections of the UK for the Confederacy, and Russia's ongoing
tensions with the UK, though no alliance is signed.

The Confederate government is the mistress of several masters--the
increasingly disdainful government of Billy Gladstone, prissy,
moralistic, and embarrassed when it points to Bulgarian atrocities
that the Ottomans point to slavery--and spends much of its time trying
to get onside with poor, isolated Third Republic France; it ends up
loosely aligned with the Catholic Church and the military right,
approximately as conservative as the CSA and as interested in
revanche.

The Spanish-American War and a period of reproachment between the UK
and the US, leading to the completion of the Panama Canal, the
annexation of Cuba, Santo Domingo, and Puerto Rico, as well as
defensive deals against German Imperialism put the squeeze on the
Confederates in the 1890's and 1900's.

The US ends up uniting Russia and the UK as the third part of the
Entente Cordial, while France facilitates, ever on the edge of a right-
wing coup, the CSA gladly signs on with the militaristic Kaiser's
Germany, with Woodrow Wilson spending time at Alexander von Humboldt
U.

France gets plugged in somewhere, as do Austria and Italy.

Labor unrest in the CSA is severe, and the fin de siecle there
features, if not Europe's Anarchists, Trade-Union-Liberationism. On
the one hand, poor whites rural and urban attempt to unionize and put
the squeeze on slave labor, while slaves are ever revolting, and free
blacks are forming their own unions. Overall, Populism with bombs and
assassinations. Of course, plenty of these groups get succor in the US
Caribbean islands, and perhaps a fateful assassination in Panama or an
ill-covered money trail in the CSA will lead to war as much as that
damnfoolthing in the Balkans. Either way, the CSA has been headed for
an authoritarian police state, though without the crisis to get there,
until the disastrous war.

Which is an epic suck. While the Confederacy is among first to declare
for the pride of her erstwhile ally, Austria-Hungary, the United
States is more reluctant, responding more to the Confederacy than to
events in Europe.

To put things politely, the Confederacy gets hammered, early and hard.
The war looks more like Germany and Russia than like the Poppies in
Flanders Field.

Progressive Party President TR's clean, well-ordered, well-regulated
United States has a better grasp of industrial warfare, and more
industry to war /with/. The Dreadnaught-heavy US Navy bombards the
Confederate Coastline, as well as &quot;infiltrating&quot; agents saboteur,
while the link to the Pacific is snipped early and happily.

The encircled Confederacy, short of food and material grinds up its
Police Aparat not only against slaves and free blacks, but against
poor whites, and later, everyone.

A Populist Revolt in Louisiana in 1917 signals the end of the CSA's
war efforts, coupled with the US Marines landing in New Orleans. It is
the first Central Alliance Ally to come to the table, though
negotiations at Beacon Hill are drawn out, in part due to the collapse
of a recognizable Confederate government, and in part due to sheer
Yankeeness. In the end, a handsome bastard cousin of Longstreet's, a
who rides handsomely on a white horse, makes good cover for the cabal
of plantation owners and psuedo-industrialists such as the CSA has,
though its control of the Carolinas, the Louisiana bayou, and the
Florida swamps is spotty, it signs away the Florida Keys, the Carolina
barrier islands, the rest of Tennessee, Kentucky, the Mexican States,
and West Texas, dubbed &quot;Houston&quot; with its capital at San Angelo.

General peace breaks out rather later; the US Navy uses stolen CS
codebooks to destroy the German blockade, though few troops are
forthcoming to fight the war, devious new technologies like tanks
appear, bringing Germany to heel around 1920 or so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Eh; the CSA, barred by treaty for having much of an external armed
forces, cranks out militias, secret police, and paramiltiaries by the
yard. The government that emerges is the Klan (loosely speaking), gone
national and vile, with a veneer of magnolias to make it acceptable,
at least initially, but once the revolution begins, a brand of
populist-racist nativism takes over the separate cadres, and
eventually, leads to a coup in the late twenties.

The police state is in full swing, its new ideology Southern Baptist,
Socialist Darwinian, moon-shine swilling mixed bag that mixes populist/
socialist policies to placate the poor whites (backbone of the
militias--think Larry the Cable guy in jackboots with a burning cross)
and it begins to rearm, chewing up slave labor to the point that
Confederates tempt fate by trying to steal from the refugee camps over
the border. Eventually, our sideburned dictator declares war to
restore Texas, et. al. Or something.

I think the biggest hole in Turtledove's paste job is the Confederacy
itself. It seems to have no real reason for existing other than making
a group of planters happy.

Any nation of any stature would sooner ally with Mexico than the CSA,
internal lines or no, there isn't enough population to defend its
territory and once the USA gets the idea of having more soldiers and a
Navy of consequence into the minds of its planners the CSA is toast.

The real problem would be occupation and reunification if possible. A

Dr. Turtledove's latest series does not need  redemption by the censors
of  this newsgroup.

Turtledove's books sell by the tens of thousands and the self-anointed
&quot;masters of alternate history&quot; sell  nothing. The  SHWI censors  don't
really   write alternate history, they spew criticism of those who do
write the stuff.  Therefore, it is not surprising that  Harry
Turtledove, a very prolific author in the genre,  is so despised by
those &quot;know it alls&quot; that do not accomplish anything.

I am far from  a fan of Turtledove. Early on and thereafter, I
criticized the international politics presented in _How Few Remain_
where the multilateral assault on  Blaine's USA  does not profit  two of
the three members of the British- Rebel- French team.   I also do not
like the &quot;decompression&quot; of  Turtledove's narrative.

But writing an outline of &quot;how I would be better than Turtledove if I
wrote his books&quot;  is pathetic. It is like a home-movie auteur correcting
Spielberg

Authorial fiat, one should suppose. I had anticipated that the CSA
would be annexed entire at the end of *WWI, but to match the scenario
requirements, I tried again, and opted for a pseudo-dodge which gave

I suggest you take a look at the economy of the South in the period
1870 to 1930, not much different than what you describe. And that is
with some Northern money coming in to pay for the needed improvements.
The Populists would have had a field day getting into power against
the planters. Besides the North can use the Mississippi and there are
plenty of good ole boys who will carry rifles for $20 a month.

A weak Germany wouldn't have lasted ten minutes at Munich (which would
have probably been held someplace in France) and probably would have
lost out in the Polish front. Think of what would have happened if the
Allies had made provisions for the German Army to be not only small
but carefully regulated. Von Seekt is as much the father of WWII as
Hitler, who saw a tool sharpened and ready for action and used it. It
just wasn't as good as he thought.

The success of southron succession would be a blot on the escutcheon

To a point; as long as the CSA remains a benign banana republic, then
yes. But as the CSA would remain an erratic neighbor that posed a long
term threat to US Security and the International order, the US is more
likely to respond by first attempting to constrain/restrain the CSA
through alliances and territorial acquisition; if that fails,
diplomatic and economic isolation. Of course, as a rogue state/police
state/pariah, it will eventually require its destruction through
annexation and reeducation.

Quite.

I'm also deeply insulted to be compared to some home movie auteur vis
a vis Turtledove, given that both require at best the theatre of the
imagination, with help from logic and research, and he's gone far
beyond his middling roots as a Byzantinist. I mean, let's recall:
http://tinyurl.com/363nud

While Ray hasn't been a member of the reality-based community for
before that Potemkin Texan sauntered into the Rose Garden (How's the
Jacobite Party of Omaha, Ray? Storming Bristol to install King Francis
yet?), apparently Harry hasn't been great guns on research or accuracy
either in fiction or in professional form, anyway. Ray's comment, like
mine some weeks ago, is just baseless back and forth sour graping.

So, if we want to take me down a peg, let's be honest: I'm a leftist
liberal arts college graduate taking the easy shots at M Night
Shyamalan in a purely social capacity. And I'm right, too.

Not the same thing at all.

Korea, Germany, and France were divided
by outside force.

One of the two
German regimes had no legitimacy at all,
and dissolved as soon as its external
prop went away.

Alsace was territory seized by a foreign
power.

Korea: well, I note that Korea has not
re-unified, and South Korea doesn't seem
especially interested in re-unification.
There seems to be lot of worry about what
it would cost SoKo to take on the burden
of 23M miserably poor NoKoans.

Besides, all of these were divisions of
long established nations. Germany was
the youngest in formal political identity,
but Germany as a national identity existed
long before 1871.

But the United States as a political
identity existed for maybe 80 years
before the CSA's separation. Large
parts of the CSA were acquired by the
U.S. even later.

Well, yes; having seen how hard it was on Germany to achieve

government in its long term form (The Ministry having been established
in 1969) and short term/electoral popularity (Sunshine policy having
begun in 1999 by President Kim Dae Jung which won him a Nobel Peace
Prize in 2000, continued by Roh Moohyun, the current President). So,
while there is obvious concern about the cost of reuniting the North
with the South, there's clearly a strong feeling in the popular body
and the government to advance to the long-term goal of reunification.

_White_ Protestants, may be, although after three wars, they aren't 'our

Quite; but in 187x, the Union had acquired parts of Tennessee,
Kentucky, and Virginia, transferring them into whole states. The
pattern continued in 1917; it would appear that the US would be able
to continue to digest the CSA piecemeal or otherwise.

As for white Protestants, I'd anticipate an interbellum period in
which lots of those get sucked over the Union border, if possible,

I dunno; it depends on how annexation goes; barring them from
emigrating would be one way to make it work, but from a pragmatist's
standpoint, Confederate born blacks have the most to gain in immediate
wage increase in Kentucky or Houston or whatever as well as in
collaborating with any possible occupation regime. While its possible
that the nexus of Evangelism which powered abolitionism may sour on
it, it's equally possible that it continue to piggyback on progressive
politics and the prohibition movement to truck along in an abstract
way, though restrictionism, as ever, will turn on between, say,
1924-1935....

While I think this is a possibility, I think the Union would want to

Trouble is, Turtledove has hyped up his Confederacy into a sort of

something like a Fascist Italy, ie a not very nice regime, but not big
enough to threaten anyone who really matters. Mussolini fell because
he turned his country into a battleground in the serious war against
Hitler. Absent Adolf, Italy is never likely to be conquered, because -
being no real threat to any &quot;power&quot; bigger than Greece - it simply
isn't worth conquering. Seems to me that's about how it would be with
the CSA. It just may be able to pinch Cuba and bits of Mexico, if the

It has been separate from the South since 1861, and iirc the alt-ACW

displaced north. And since that date, southern blacks have not been
free to move. So the black population is likely to be tiny compared to
that of OTL's northern states. Any &quot;ghettos&quot; are probably inhabited by
_white_ southern immigrants rather than by blacks. Indeed, would the
latter's racial views seriously clash with those of the average
northern white - let alone those of, say, the Irish community?

Well, irredentism, for sure. The US resents the CSA for breaking away;
the CSA will resent the US after the Blaine War nearly ends their

Well, no. If we accept that there is the War for Succession, followed

You and I disagree about the way the CSA would both feel and conduct
itself within the international system. I think thats expansionist
behavior will loom large in the eyes of the US, strengthening the
sense of hostility and threat. While the CSA might not be annexable in
one 19th century go, and may not threaten the survival of the US, it
nonetheless is a grave enemy of international peace and order, and one
that has a border with the US and aims to periodically attack the US.
Negating the original success of the creation of the CSA, or
liquidating the threat. The mixture of irredentism, rage, etc. should
lead to chipping away and eventual destruction of the regime by
reconsolidating it into the US. Perhaps python style.

Other flaws. Antebellum free blacks were not without rights. In the south
of our timeline they tried to form confederate regiments, and some served
with the Confederate army - his racial element is unrealistic. &quot;Jim
Crow&quot; was a reaction to defeat, and wouldn't have occured. Turtledove's
CSA is blaming its blacks for events in OTL.

A Union defeat, and the increasing militarization of the USA would have
made the US much less attractive to immigration. Several major subplots
are based on the false assumption that OTL's immigration would have
occured.  It was the lack of conscription, and the general openness, that
made America attractive.

In OTL the Allied benefitted greatly from American support even before the
US entered WWI.  If instead, North America was diverting resources,
especially from the British, it would have hada major impact. Also
Turtledove says Canada had peacetime conscription dating to the late 19th
century, meaning the whole Empire does, meaning Britain of his 1914 would
have been a very different place than in OTL.

its &quot;free colored&quot; residents had a position in law
far superior to free colored elsewhere in the U.S.

This was a relict of French and Spanish rule, when
racial distinctions were not strictly enforced. By
1860, these laws had nearly all been abolished, and
Louisiana's free colored were reduced to the same
powerless and rights-less position as in the rest
of the Deep South.

The LNG was a desperate effort by the free colored

&quot;Jim Crow&quot; was a reaction to the presence

Especially without the threat of a federally imposed abolition of slavery,
and without a desire to &quot;get even&quot; after being defeated, there is no
reason to believe the south would have moved in the direction of stripping
its black freemen of the rights they had. A key element of the Turtledove
series is a status of blacks that is worse than Jim Crow, which is not a
likely result of his POD.

To emphasize: the last *desperate* few weeks.  The North's arming of
ex-slaves or black freemen was considered by the South to be an
abominable war crime; many were slaughtered on surrender, sometimes
with their officers, and the South refused to exchange them under
cartel (which is why the cartel exchange system broke down, helping to
lead to Andersonville &amp;c).  As late as January 1864, General
Cleburne's proposal to recruit an army of slaves got reactions from
divisional commanders like &quot;monstrous proposition ... revolting to
Southern sentiment, Southern pride, and Southern honor&quot; and &quot;at war
with my social, moral, and political principles&quot; (McPherson, p. 832),
or from a Congressman, &quot;Victory itself would be robbed of its glory if
shared with slaves&quot; (p. 835).

!  At the risk of Godwinizing, that's like saying that, after
Kristalnacht and the Nurenburg laws, there was no reason to believe
the Nazis would move in the direction of stripping its Jews of the
remaining rights they had.

The South lionized the Dred Scott decision, which said that blacks wer
&quot;so far inferior, that they had no rights which a white man was bound
to respect&quot;.  Allowing blacks to keep rights would have been contrary
to all Southern principles.

Stop confusing OTL with alternative history. In January 1864 the war was
long since ended. For all purposes the Confederate capture of Baltimore
and Washington in 1862 ended the war.  While some equivalent of the 13th
amendment might have passed eventually by the Union (several slave states
are depicted in the series as being in the USA but without slavery), race
never became a big issue. There were no Colored regiments in the Union
army, ever. The short, 18 month conflict, ended before the Union took any
anti-slavery measures. In OTL, by 1864 it was a war about slavery (note
that almost all northerns by 1866 realized they were ardent abolitionists
retroactively). Turtledove's description of a treatment of southern blacks
in which the free black population lost its rights, and in which
oppression of blacks became draconian, is not supported by his overall
narrative. From a POD of a southern victory by the end of 1862, one would
see a small southern black middle class, and an improvement of conditions
for slaves (as many southerners advocated).

The stripping of free colored rights began
long before there was any threat of Federal
imposed abolition.

Not only that, but Deep Southerners feared
free colored as possible agents of slave
insurrection. There were free colored in
Charleston who owned property, even a few
who were rich - until Denmark Vesey's 1823
conspiracy, after which all such were
driven out.
