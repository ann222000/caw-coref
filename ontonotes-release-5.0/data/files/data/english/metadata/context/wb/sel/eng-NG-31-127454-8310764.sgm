Me too sorta, for a couple reasons:

1. I'm not particularly looking forward to Harry Potter being over forever.

2. I am never happy with the bevahior of the publishers around release time.
The hype, the strong-arm threats made to libraries and bookshops, the
overplayed secrecy.  Last go-round they were snatching books back out of
little kids' hands who accidentally got it too early and threatening them
with legal action.  Not to mention the bigger supposed &quot;fan websites&quot; which
are just promotional venues for the pubs and are censored and run like
little dictatorhips.  That always puts a little kink in my joy at forking
over my $30 or whatever come release time.

I've said it a couple times before, but I'll say it one more time.  JKR has
so many loose ends to tie up, she can't possibly get them all, nor can she
possibly get them to everyone's satisfaction.  Thus it's almost guaranteed
that the book will disappoint everyone on some level.

Well I'm not looking forward to it in that their won't be any more which is
kind of a shame but still I'm hopeful that Jo will at least leave the series
somewhat open ended so we can imagine what sort of life Harry and co will
have into the future.  I still think he'll survive the books but then it's
only a few days till we know for sure now, isn't it?

You, too?  That's been my biggest fear for years, that Rowling would
get rundown by a bus or bitten by a rabid fan, or lose her notes to a
flood or a fire.

I just hope that this bandwagon fandom fad thing doesn't interfere
with my future enjoyment of her books.  I've been wondering for years
what she would do next.   As much as I love Harry Potter, I hate it
when every little thing becomes frontpage news.  It's especially bad
when so many in the news industry think it's kinda funny and don't
respect how seriously some of the fans take reading the books in
unspoiled peace.

People are already getting hold of the book and writing reviews.  I
wish they would embargo the reviews until Saturday when all of us who
all already planning to buy the book will have done so.  I thought
reviews were for the benefit of people sittiing on the fence, not
those of us waiting patiently.   Although I am tempted to go visit all
the big box stores in the area to see if they've &quot;accidentally&quot; set a
pallet of Deathly Hallows in the main aisle.

There were stories of the publisher requesting that books be returned
or else!  I forget which publisher, though.  It was either the US or
Canada.  Some were returned, but &quot;or else&quot; never happened stores don't
keep track of sales in a way that makes it easy to find the
purchaser.  Books aren't controlled subtances that you must sign for,
fortunately.

If the leak (carpet-book) is real, I am going to spend one hell of a time
trying to figure out what the hell happened, or have the books ALWAYS been
this bad? I have a friend who insists the books have always been this
incomplete, and poorly written. She does make a point....she likes the books
for the characters and the world they're set in, the magical world...the
world itself is brilliant. The stories? Not so much. She points out that JKR
tends to create really wonderful characters in one book, then in the later
books, they just peter out and aren't developed. Lupin in Book 3- wonderful.
Later books, not, and apparently in DH, very lame. Tonks in Book 5 ,
terrific- Book 6- she's gone downhill. Luna Lovegood started out great and
ended weakly. Sirius, too.  etc. I never thought it before, but I have to
admit I see it now.

She thinks the leaked book is real, which I have not but am wondering now.
I've insisted it MUST be fake and given my reasons, to which my friend
laughed and told me to go read Half Blood Prince again, only to read it from
the start *looking* for it to be a fake. Dagnabbit, she has a point! If I
read Half Blood Prince geared up for inconsitencies or weak bits, and
character changes and the like, I could convince myself that's not Jo's
writing. If you accept her books for what they are and accept what she feeds
you, with no questions and expectations, you can relax and like it, but if
you LOOK closer, you can find many things in the books just like what I'm
complaining about in the carpet-book.

I'm crushed. And confused. It's *just* a book, how did expectations get so
high? My friend has a theory on this, too. Harry Potter became bigger than
Jo's one-woman writing. The first few books were tight but she kept adding
characters and concepts until the books became so huge and complex that it
started to get out of control and became impossible for her to tie up in
nearly as complex of a way as people started to *expect*. Maybe it's because
all the fans hang on every word, convinced that the books are full of
meaning that's not there and red herrings that are not so intentionally
thought-out. Look at all the fansites analyses. Look how much we DREW from
the books and how complex our guesses and theories are. We took the book
places Jo never intended for it to go.

Plus one more thing, JKR has a habit of not tying things up as well in the
books anyway. Look how many interviews she gives clarifying for us that
Dumbledore is really dead and Sirius is not coming back. It should have been
apparent in the books but she could tell us that all day in interviews and
half the people still expected twists. But the books probably DID make those
deaths obvious and permanent. But JKR write herself into a hole when she
started doing all these interviews and taking questions and getting us ready
for Book 7. She told us we'll see something very important about Ginny in
the last book,. If carpetbook is real, she didn't deliver. She told us we
should be asking why Dumbledore had James's cloak, and yes, we do see that
in the carpet-book. When someone asked her if anyone else was present that
night in Godric's Hollow she said &quot;No comment&quot; implying it would ruin the
story if she told, and who WAS there in carpetbook? The Potters' cat, who
has no other role in this series. Oy. She simply talked too much.

JKR told us everything would be tied up, and perhaps, everything SHE
intended IS tied up. I thought Ginny would end up having some important
power. I thought we'd find out some huge reveal about WHY Neville Longbottom
has such a bad memory- it seemed like his gran or someone else was tampering
with his memory, there were so many clues. I thought we;d find out something
important about the Locked Door in the Ministry of Magic, and also, I
thought we'd find out what James and Lily Potter's occupations were. JKR has
told us we would, and that they were very important. ?? What happened, JK?

Also, Patronuses were a concept that seemed to be extremely important. A
Patronus is supposed to be crucial to a character's nature. In the
carpet-book, we learn little about Patronuses. And what we do see is mostly
Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley and has little do with anything
important. We learn what Snape's is, and frankly, Dumbledore's reason for
trusting Snape is very weak indeed. Remember JKR SAID Snape's boggart and
Patronus were OH so crucially important and would reveal a lot in the last
book? People had brilliant theories- Snape's Patronus is a Spider, Spinner's
End was a brilliant clue, it alluded to his death, too. Snape's patronus was
a phoenix and Dumbeldore knew only a good soul could produce a phoenix. All
kinds of magical guesswork was going on to deconstruct Snape and in the end?
Cue the music for the Young and the Restless (American soap opera)...Snape's
Patronus used to be Lily's, a doe, and he has it because he loved her. There
is nothing more magicl about Harry having Lily's eyes except they remind
Snape of his love for Lily Evans. Oy! This is pretty weak for a wizard's
story. Even if the book IS supposed to be about the power of love. And we
still don't know what's behind the locked door. We at least theorized that
the Minstry was using the actual magic of love to do experiments with, whose
power could magically be used to better the world and defeat evil.

Didn't expect JKR to tie literally everything up, but expected much more.
Albus Severus?

And I still think the very idea of Harry trying to &quot;Accio Hagrid&quot; is insane.

I'm still not giving up hope that the whole thing *is* a clever fake

To me, it's very much like fanfiction. This may be the real book but I
cannot believe this is the plot that JKR had in her mind from the very
beginning, NO way.

I'm really disappointed. I'm still holding out that something about this
book will turn out to be a hoax. Again, my friend responds to my every point
with &quot;But all the previous books are just like that, too!&quot; I've been reading
some comments from other people who don't like the book either, and it's
definitely deserving to be made fun of. About the scene with Ginny taking
Harry into her room to tell him Happy Birthday, people are criticizing it
saying it is alluding to Ginny deciding to have sex with Harry but they are
interrupted by Ron bursting in on them. Ginny keeps saying she wanted to
give him something to remember her by in case he meets some veelas or
something in his quest (and she obviously doesn't pull out a gift!) Harry
mentions he won't have time for dating and Ginny's all &quot;Oh, the silver
lining I've been hoping for!&quot; and kisses him like she &quot;never has before&quot;.
GAG!!! Then Ron bursts in. This is pure crapola of the worst sort of
fanfiction. I said no way JKR wrote this. My friend says oh yes it would be
VERY much like the crap JKR writes and reminds me of the love monster in
Harry's chest in Half Blood Prince. And then I remember what she's talking
about! This is painful. I don't know if it's because I think most of the
romance part of the Harry books is unnecessary, and poorly done, and not
integral to the plot, or because I[m older, or because I don't like cheese
in my books..

Please let it be fake, I went from insisting on the record it's fake to
being worried. If it's real I'm glad I encountered the leaks. I cannot
**imagine** having stayed away from spoilers like I tried so hard to do,
just to have the book delivered and open it up, and read some of these
scenes.

What bugs me more is it had the potential to be pretty good if an editor
stepped in! If you'd just remove some of the more offensive drivel, JKR
could have the plot remain as it is and just tune up the writing, and it
would be ok- just want to make it clear that it's not that I don't like the
carpetbook because of the plot. I honestly don't care, and never did, WHO
ends up together in relationships. I realized I wouldn't like all of the
deaths, etc. It's not the plot, it's the parts of the writing that are
written so poorly. If that makes sense.

I feel there are plot holes, but I think if the book was trimmed of certain
things that aren't integral anyway, it would improve. Seriously. Tonks and
Lupin didn't do anything useful anyway and as an editor I would have
suggested to JKR one of two things: don't put that crap storyline of Lupin
being full of regret in the book at all. If you want Tonks and Lupin to die
and leave behind an orphaned son, so you are determined to write it that
they were married before the book begins, then tread carefully. Go minimal-
have a scene where they announce their marriage, cut ALL of the
Lupin-is-having-issues storyline, and then write them a really meaningful
death scene after having mentioned that the baby was born. Stop at this!
This way JK could keep her storyline (Tonks and Lupin married with child,
then they die so Harry can be godfather to their orphaned son) without
wrecking her characters. Book 3 covered the prejudice against werewolves
well enough- Lupin was the best DADA teacher and he lost his job, etc. That
gave the point. I would have told JKR to do this, or if she didn't feel they
must have a child, to avoid the wedding and pregnancy altogether and just
make their role in the book minimal then, avoid the wreck of a story
altogether- in this case I would have suggested that she have them survive.
But if she agreed to drop the baby but still have them die, I would have
insisted she write them a proper death scene. I still think Sirius lacked
one- we read the carpetbook and unlike what JKR said, we do NOT see clearly
why Sirius had to die or in that manner. Sirius was a wasted character whose
death was poorly written.
