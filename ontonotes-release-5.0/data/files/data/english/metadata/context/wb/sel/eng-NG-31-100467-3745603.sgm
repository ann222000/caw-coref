As everyone probably knows, Richard Pryor passed away recently. I want
to post about his natal chart and progs/dirs/transits, which I'd
started to look at, but last night my computer died (I'm hoping it's
just a dead battery, not a motherboard problem-- the power comes on and
all the lights light up, but the computer doesn't even try to start
booting), and the laptop I'm using right now (which isn't really mine,
it belongs to the company I work for) has no astrology software on it,
in any case I can't access my notes or software from my computer.

Well, I got Richard Pryor's birth data from Astrodienst, if you do a
noon chart for his given birth place and birth date, then ask for the
celebrity Astro-Twins, you'll see his data listed, which has a birth
time of 1:02 PM CST. I don't know the source of the data, but
presumably it's from birth certificate, if I could access my
AstroDatabank I could check to see if he's in there.

In some of the bios/obits for him, and also on his web site, it says he
was raped by a teenager from his neighborhood at age six I think (or
seven, but I think it was six). Natally, he has Jupiter conjunct Saturn
in Taurus (2nd House), opposing Venus conjunct Mars in Scorpio (8th
House), all squared by Chiron conjunct Pluto in Leo (5th House) as I
recall. I don't know the date of the childhood rape, so I just used his
sixth birthday, and looked at the dirs/progs/transits. Right away I saw
directed Chiron squaring natal Mars, which seems very appropriate
symbolically for that event (woundedness or pain/suffering of a sexual
nature). Looking at the transits for that time, it is interesting that
transiting Saturn was also squaring Mars (and conjoining directed
Chiron), and at the same time transiting Chiron was conjoining natal
Mars (and squaring directed Chiron). So even though natal Chiron is the
"planet" which is most out-of-orb in that natal T-Square, it seems to
have played an important role in it. At least, if the childhood rape
was so important to him that it's specifically mentioned on his web
site, then it would appear to have influenced his life to at least some
extent (otherwise I presume it wouldn't have been mentioned). And I
don't know what events occurred at other times when portions of that
natal T-Square were activated by transit, progression, or direction,
but I do think that the rape which coincided to the activation by
directed Chiron, transiting Saturn, and transiting Chiron does suggest
what Chiron's part (at least) in the T-Square meant in his life.

If I can get my computer fixed, I'll work on his chart some more, but
until then I thought I'd start this thread in case anyone else wants to
jump in and look at his chart. He was raised in a brothel run by a
grandmother, by the way, where his mother worked, and that had a big
impact on him.

Sorry to hear about your computer problems, Michael. Always an awful
helpless feeling until you have it all back and working. Hope it is all
back by now -- 2 weeks later. No reponse to this excellent thread in 2
weeks time -- shaking head.

Here is another site for his BD of December 1, 1940 at 1:02 pm CST in
Peoria Illinois:

http://www.astrotheme.fr/en/portraits/HynZBZp4L8B8.htm

http://conspiracyplanet.com/channel.cfm?channelid=131&amp;contentid=3056

I am always amazed at how little interest the people on this group have
for looking at astrology charts even when someone knowledgeble tries to
start a thread. No replies whatsoever until now. Always seem to rather
argue philosophy of free will b.s. or politics than look at astrology
charts of people and events. Shaking head...

Interesting chart! And interesting life!

With Mars conjunct Venus and opp Jupiter and Saturn and square Pluto,
well.... Then Venus, Mercury and Mars are in Scopio so being surrounded
by sex and sexually abused fit the pattern of his chart for intense
sexual events in his life.

I have often heard that Jupiter is always involved with death. Well,
the T. Mars had just past his Jupiter and Saturn (right on the Jup/Sat
MP) in Taurus (square his Arc of Death at 8 Leo) and T. Jupiter was in
his 8th house square T. Saturn in his 5th and square his N. Saturn at 9
Taurus. T. Saturn was coming back to that point at 10 Leo Ret.

Natally he has Venus and Mars /-/ Chiron and Jupiter and Saturn //
Chiron, so... Chiron was being triggered with the Jupiter, Saturn and
Mars transits, big time. The Jupiter // Chiron indicates a Cinderella
person -- rags to riches so to speak.

So when the T. Mars stationed on his Saturn on December 10, 2005 and T.
Mars was opposed N. Mars and Jupiter was opp his Saturn, he died. Pluto
was also Square his Asc as of December 1, so...

They do not call Mars and Saturn the Arc of death for no reason, IMO.
That Pluto transist is another texbook case with the Mars-Saturn
transits.

I do not have time to look at the Progs. and Dirs., but this is such an
interesting chart and life event shown so dramatically in the transits.
Thanks, Michael!

&gt; Did it ever occur to you some might not have an interest in Richard Pryor,
&gt; rather than erroneously assuming some don't have an interest in looking at
&gt; any charts at all? Oh, gee, how silly of me to point out the obvious.
&gt; Shaking head...

Why does Richard Pryor have to be an "interest" with this thread? This
is a natal astrology chart about sexual abuse, drug addiction,
Parkinson's of a person who went from rags to riches and death by
Mars-Saturn and Jupiter.

This is not a Hollywood star's club is it? Are we voting on favorites
here? This is a "lets look at astrology charts and aspects" group or
did I wander into the wrong place? Â Shaking head...

You both have valid points. We don't need to like or admire someone to
study their chart, but that said, we do tend to look at charts of
people or events that interest us (quite apart from whether we like or
dislike them).

I read that Richard Pryor's mother abandoned him when he was 10. No
date is given, so I'm using his 10th Solar return as a starting point.
T.Saturn was in his 7th, just past his N.Neptune. It retrograded back
to N.Neptune while he was 10, and around April 9, 1951 it was
Rx-conjunct N.Neptune while T.Jupiter was simultaneously opposite
N.Neptune, both also squaring his N.MC within 1 degree. I wonder if
that was around the time his mother abandoned him? Or perhaps around
July 16, 1951, with T.Saturn conjunct N.Neptune again (3rd pass), and
P.Moon conjunct N.Uranus?

He set himself on fire on June 1, 1980. I always thought it was
supposed to have been an accident (explosion) while freebasing cocaine,
but the web page where I found the date says it was deliberate-- he
poured cognac and/or other flammable liquids on himself and lit it
because he was morbidly depressed while in a drug-crazed state of mind
(freebasing cocaine). T.Saturn was in his 6th House but near his
N.Desc. Looking back, T.Saturn had come just a hair shy of conjoining
N.Neptune before going Rx on January 6, 1980, so the freebasing
"accident" occurred 1 Saturn cycle after his mother abandoned him,
leading me to wonder if he was remembering that abandonment when he set
himself on fire-- or rather had been swelling on it for some months. At
the time T.Saturn went Rx on January 6, 1980, T.Chiron was conjunct
N.Saturn, which to me suggests pain or suffering related to a
long-standing condition or situation, or events that occurred in the
past, or an older person, etc. On June 1, 1980, when he actually set
himself on fire (no time of day given, so I'm using 12 noon PDT), T.Sun
was opposite his N.Sun (within about 2 degrees, the exact aspect was
May 30, ca. 11 AM), and T.Moon conjoined N.Moon (exact on June 1, ca. 4
AM), so the "accident" was just after a Solar semi-return and on the
day of a Lunar return. I have to admit that I've never used Solar
semi-returns, but I think it suggests a more objectified view of self
("opposition" = "objective awareness"), like looking at oneself in the
mirror as it were, and/or possibly a conflict between self and an
authority figure, or between self and self's mate (spouse or
significant other). He certainly had relationship problems galore
throughout his life. Also, D.Neptune was conjunct his N.Mars (just
past, but within 1 degree), symbolically appropriate for a fiery or
flammable situation while using drugs and/or alcohol. At the same time,
D.MC was squaring N.Jupiter and N.Mars. And T.Uranus was opposing
N.Uranus, suggesting restlessness or a desire for change, to break out
of ruts and do something liberating, or a desparate wish for a breath
of fresh air in his life. Also, D.Asc. was squaring N.Pluto, possibly
suggesting a life-or-death event. And D.Mars and D.Venus had just
recently sesquisquared his N.Chiron, suggesting an aggravation of old
wounds related to his love/sex/male/female issues.

Going back to an earlier event, in September, 1967 (no date given, so
I'm using September 15), he was in the middle of performing to a
sold-out audience in Las Vegas, when he had an "epiphany" and said,
"What the f*** am I doing here," and walked off the stage. He felt he
was trying to be like Bill Cosby-- essentially, a clean, white-friendly
or acceptable black comedian, instead of being true to himself. Since
this was basically about the face he was presenting to the world, it's
revealing that P.Asc. was conjoined with his N.Jupiter/N.Saturn
conjunction, and opposite his N.Venus/N.Mars conjunction, suggesting
that he was struck by the gross dissimilarities between the mask he
wore while performing, vs. his tumultuous life experiences and the
inner conflicts that arose from them. Also, T.Chiron was in his 1st
House, opposing N.Neptune, suggesting pain or suffering (and a need for
healing) related to his image, and perhaps feeling that he was
essentially living a lie for other people, by telling the kind of jokes
they were expecting rather than being honest with them by presenting
his real thoughts and comic portrayals of the kinds of people he'd
grown up around. Also, T.Uranus was conjunct his N.Desc. around that
time, suggesting an abrupt change in his relationships with other
people (which could include his "relationship" with his audience), and
"coming out" or "going public" with a totally different persona or
approach.

Great work, Michael. It seems you are well on your way to an article
for publication in some excellent astrology publication. Very
interesting and valid interpolations, IMO.
