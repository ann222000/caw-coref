Bats and Fireflies

Saturday, July 14, 2007, 8:00 p.m. - 10:00 p.m.
at the Conservancy Farm
8383 Vreeland Road, Superior Township, MI 48198

Last year, we saw 103 Big Brown Bats fly out of the barn where they sleep
during the day at the Conservancy Farm.  Come out and help with the count as we
watch them head towards the LeFurge Woods Nature Preserve for their nightly
insect hunt. As the sky darkens, we'll see fireflies by the hundreds light up the
surrounding fields.

Everyone is welcome - bring friends and family.  We'll have a few chairs
available but it's suggested to bring your own lawn chairs.  A blanket and pillows
are a good way to watch, too.  Be prepared for mosquitoes and cooler
nighttime temperatures.  Kids are especially welcome but, please, no pets.  For
further information, please contact Scott Tyrrell (styrr ... @SMLCland.org /
734-484-6565).

Hope to see you Saturday!
