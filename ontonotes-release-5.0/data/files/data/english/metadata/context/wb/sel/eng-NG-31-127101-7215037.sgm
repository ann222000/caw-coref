DELHI STYLE GOLDEN CHICKEN PILAU
This makes for 2 portions PCa friendly.

1/2 Lb Chicken Breast fillets, diced bitesize.

A handful of blanched almonds (Optional)
Half a pint of Basmatti rice - rinsed in several running waters.
A Pint - just over of a good chicken stock (I used a cube today)
2 Tablespoons Olive Oil.

Deep pot - 2 quarts - heat the oil and fry off the chicken in batches to
give a little colour.
Drain chicken to a plate - get oil back in the pot.
Put ALL the veggies in the pot and stir aboutabit. - 2 mins.
In with the spices and stir aboutabit - 2 mins and then add the rinsed rice.
Let the rice soak up the spices and oils.
Add the stock.
Add the almonds.
Slowly bring to a simmer - now skim oil off the top if you want to.
Stir it ONCE.
Put on the lid (tight) and put on the slowest heat.
DONT stir for at least 12 minutes.
Check for the rice being swollen and cooked out.
Should be fairly dry and no liquid in the bottom.
Leave for a while for the flavours to meld.
Reheat in the micro when ready to eat.
Garnish with chilli flowers and coriander leaves.
Even better for breakfast next day.
