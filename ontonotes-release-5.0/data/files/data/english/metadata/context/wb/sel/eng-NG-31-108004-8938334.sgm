Well folks, it's been an interesting few days. We'll start with yesterday
(Monday).  Went off to FINALLY pick up my new glasses (with bifocals) and as
I went by the bead shop, I spotted my girl friend's car. Gee, usually she
works on Thursday, but I haven't seen her since August, so I'll stop. It was
an auspicious call. She had just taken ownership of the store and I got to
be her very first customer. I paid some of the tally (like I could walk out
empty handed) with a one and signed and dated it for her. It is now hanging
on the wall at the store.

I finally got to Lens Crafters and picked up the bifocals. They're going to
take getting used to - I get dizzy when I look down and either need a lower
chair for the computer or just wear my distance glasses... LOL Also scored a
great pair of jeans at Marshall...

But this AM brought another good surprise. DS had the big screw in his leg
removed. He and DH left at 5:30 AM and I joined DH in the waiting room by
8:20 AM (DD went to the neighbor's). I'm sitting there and notice a couple
walk in about 9 AM. It's an old daylily buddy (we only live a few miles
apart) that I haven't seen in years. His wife is there for one those routine
tests we get when we hit 50 or so. We had a good time catching up. He was
amazed by how big the kids are and he's a grandfather now.

So - we're home now, since DS only had heavy sedation, I can wander and do
stuff, but not leave the house for his pizza. (thank heavens)

-----

So, I'm off to do some laundry and other housewifery and escape the
videogames.

Cheryl

PS - just found out the DS can be back on the ice in 2 weeks and the
surgeon's team needs a goalie for pick up games.....

Hi CHeryl!

I'm so glad your son's doing well. He must be looking forward to
getting back on the ice. You'll adjust to the bifocals pretty quickly,
I'm sure. My dad took about a week to get used to his. And think of
all the needlework waiting for you now!

Right now, I'm thinking I'll wait for a day alone to get used to the

Glad DS is doing well.  As for the bi-focals - just be a bit careful with
the first and last step on stairs - you tend to miss `em, even when you`re
used to bifocals!

All in time - you'll get used to your new bifocals quickly.

I, on the other hand, am adjusting to a new pair of walking shoes! I'm
trying to break them in a little bit at a time. They're fancy-shmancy
(read: expensive) shoes that are sort of like the old earth shoes -
tipped back in the heel. (The soles kind of rock.) I didn't want to take
a long walk in them right off, and also wanted to make sure they'd fit
properly for more than the 10 minutes in the store by wearing them on
the carpet at home so I could return them if they weren't right. So I
wore them all day yesterday around the house and by evening I had a few
&quot;stretchy&quot; aches, but felt okay today when I got up. So I think they're
keepers!

Now I just have to find/make some *time* for a walk!

Glad to hear of DS's progress. And a new bead store! You'd better tell
me where it is...

Yesterday was &quot;shoe&quot; day for me, too. I bought a pair of black chucks
with daisies and cherries on them. I just couldn't resist. And then I
bought a new pair of Nikes for walking. I truly hate the end of sandal
season and thought some new shoes might easy my transition.

Hudson NH - it's not a new store, just a new owner. But, she told me I can't
go to any other bead shops now ;( (it was a joke)

When I was looking for  a dressy pair, I found great pair of black clogs. I
have to go back and get them - so soft inside and not as big a heel.
