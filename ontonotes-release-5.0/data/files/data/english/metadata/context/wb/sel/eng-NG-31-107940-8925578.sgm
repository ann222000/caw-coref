It kind of amazes me that someone with Scott Crossfield's level of
experience could have that happen to them. Embedded TS were predicted
across a large swath of his flight path.

The report implicated the ATC guy. Said he didn't give Crossfield
weather updates when he wasn't busy enough NOT to give the updates. For
some reason Crossfield didn't ask for them, either.

One thing that really struck me was the report said Crossfield's plane
entered a level 6 TS. Straight into it, then turned to get out, but
stopped returning radar signals at 5500 feet.

Dang.

Can anyone tell me why the e-mail address shown for my original e-mail
is wrong? I haven't used Hotmail.com for 5-10 years and no longer have
an address there????

John,  that version is so old, that I don't recall how to configure
it, but you can inquire at this newsgroup:

You may be right. I'll look there.

Seems I remember now, setting it up as a throw away address long time
ago.

Tnx

John

Maybe that was the altitude it came apart at?  I heard it came down in
pieces.  Apparently Alice (his wife) still has the bent prop leaning up
against the fence at home.  This was an accident that should never have
happened.

I forget if I read it or if someone told me.  Apparently she can't let
go.  It's really sad.  He was really young for someone his age and a
really nice guy.  My kids went to Crossfield elementary and they just
thought of him as the &quot;guy who comes to the science fair lives across
the street&quot;.  He's missed in the community.  I met a couple of his kids
after the crash as they are sort of carrying on for him.  I really liked
him and all he stood for.   He was a great man.
