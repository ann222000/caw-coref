An amateur paper that may provide some insights into various
gravitational phenomena:

http://mtaonline.net/~hheffner/FullGravimag.pdf

It may be especially of interest to EM folks because EM theory is
readily applied to gravity problems by the methods shown.

Hello Horace...

An interesting and imaginative paper. I browsed it quickly and bookmarked it
for full reading later.

Since you did not reference it in your work, are you perhaps not aware of
Jefimenko's new book, &quot;Gravitation and Cogravitation?&quot; It is also available
through Electret.

This book integrates work from several of his sources with a host of
additional ideas. If you have not seen it, I suggest you do so. You will
find sevearl areas wherein your concepts are reflected.

I have been told that Jefimenko has been in hospital for some months. I
certainly hope for a full recovery. I'll pass the URL for your paper to a
colleague of his. If he is able, I imagine he would be interested in reading
and commenting.

Thanks.  Unfortuantely, I have highly edited the article to remove as
much speculative stuff as possible - due to a refusal by the
moderators of sci.physics.research to even allow me to post a link to
the article.  The response form the moderator was:  &quot;Unfortunately,
your paper is still overly speculative, starting from its assumption.
Electromagnetic theory and general relativity are not isomorphic. If
you prefer a different theory of gravity, you must first show that it
reduces to GR, in some limit.&quot;

In other words, GR, dispite its inability to span the quantum realm,
or to explain negative energy or the galaxy rotation problem, is the
only permissable game in town.

I you should want a copy of the old article I would be happy to send
it to you.  The pioneer anomaly stuff is now located at:

Actually I did buy a copy.  Clearly I think very highly of Jefimenko's
work (awestruck is a better expression)  as I based mine on it.
Though it is a very fine book, it appeared to me to be mainly a
consolidation of Jefimenko's life work.  I only browsed it
superficiallly though, for that reason.  I apologize for this late
response to your remark, as I wanted to look it over again to see if I
missed something.  As noted various places in my article, Jefimanko's
work is the foundation upon which I have built.  My addition is the
incremental step of building a full isomorphism by making the mass
charge and field units imaginary.  (Note that Jefimenko's bold face i
is a unit vector, not  the imaginary i = (-1)^(1/2) used in my units.
I have posted articles in this regard since 2003.  Some of my early
thinking is loacted at:

http://www.mtaonline.net/~hheffner/GR-and-QM.pdf
http://www.mtaonline.net/~hheffner/Gravimagnetism.pdf

I did find some material I overlooked.  Most interesting is Chapter
17, especially 17-1.11.  I'll have to think about that a bit.  It
provides some basis for EM and GK field coupling, which is great,
though I am not still sure I understand the initial assumptions
leading there.  The bending of light section that follows is very
interesting, though it doesn't deal with negative gravitational
objects, which was my focus.

Also notable is the reference to negative gravitational fields on page
311, and formula 19-1.6, which is roughly similar to the formula I
derived for the glactic mass distribuiton to solve the galactic
rotation problem.  Jefimenko's basis for that formula was including
the effects of the mass equivalent of the energy of the gravitional
field. Though that sounds rational, I personally can not buy the
notion that gravitons,or gravitational fields, self-interact, because
black holes would then be impossible.  I still think neagtive
gravitaional charge is the likely source, and the existence of such
chrage is mandated by the fundamental assumption that the isomorphism
exists, which is not a long stretch of logic. Further, such charge
represents and exaplains the &quot;negative energy&quot; problem and a variety
of others, and fleshes out the entire realm of gravimagnetic
formulations, not just those Jefimeko lists. Jefimenko is still in the
unfortunate position of having to determine equation signs on a case
by case basis.

I heard a similar comment re Jefimenko, to the effect that his work was not
worthy of study since he had not reduced all of his theories to Lagrangians.

It's a shame that GR has been placed on such a pedestal -- especially so
since Jefimenko has demonstrated that so much of GR's results can also be
derived from a careful consideration of Newtonian concepts with retardation.

BUT all attempts at a unified field theory must, I submit, reduce to
Newtonian/Maxwellian principles for simple cases.

One of the things that I have learned in reading Jefimenko is that I have to
be VERY careful. Most writers, upon deriving a new concept, will usually
highlight the finding with stars, circles, lines and -- if they can manage
it -- music and dancing girls. In contrast, Jefimenko is wont to allow a new
concept to slide in with no fanfare whatsoever.

As an example, I completley missed, on first reading, the significance of
INDUCTION as being a non-magnetic phenomenon! Phooosh! It went right by me.
At 3:00 AM I awoke with an &quot;omigosh!&quot;

So, Caveat Lector. I'm re-reading (more carefully) the Gravitation book.
Already found a couple of little &quot;zingers.&quot; Kinda like -- at Easter time --
going BACK into the yard to find the eggs that I missed the first time out
with my basket!

&gt;I apologize for this late

I need to think a lot about your choice of units.

Curiously enough, I was re-reading that section yesterday and marked that
equation with an exclamation point.

The initial assumption is that gravity attracts photons. How do we know
this?

We know that EM waves contain energy. And there is a mass-energy
relationship -- E equals M C squared. And THAT seems to requires that there
be some form of &quot;distributed mass&quot; in a region containing EM. Is that
&quot;distributed mass&quot; what we call a photon? I don't know.

I'm also still trying to understand Jefimenko on this. After all,
antigravity -- a fallout of his analysis -- is too close to SF for my
liking. (Although I believe that Forward's paper in the 60's was written by
the same fellow that also authored several excellent SF stories. Or is that
a different Robert Forward?)

I sent it via Dave Walker -- one of the folks that Jefimenko thanks in his
book's forward for critiques and suggestions. Perhaps Dave may reply -- even
if Jefimenko is unable to.

Dirac's notations are dumb; the spinors are pseudovectors whereas the
sign of energy refers to a scalor.  The experiment reeks of Uncle Al's
GR-hole chirality.
