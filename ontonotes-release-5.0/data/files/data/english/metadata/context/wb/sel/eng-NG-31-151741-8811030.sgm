LOUISVILLE - The Presbyterian  Peacemaking Program has made
worship resources available on its Web site for  churches and
other groups planning to mark the International Day of  Peace
(Peace Day) on Friday, Sept. 21.

[This can be found at _ http://www.pcusa.org/peacemaking/_
( http://www.pcusa.org/peacemaking/ )    ]

The United Nations General Assembly has set Sept. 21 of each
year as  the International Day of Peace - a day of global
ceasefire and non-violence  when all nations and people are
encouraged to honor a cessation of  hostilities.

The World Council of Churches (WCC) is also  encouraging
congregations worldwide to pray for peace on Sept. 21 or  on
the following Sunday.

&quot;The International Day of Peace calls the  people of the
world to ponder the possibility of peace,&quot; said the  Rev.
Mark Koenig, coordinator of the Presbyterian Peacemaking
Program.  &quot;The day provides an opportunity for Presbyterians
to join Christians,  interfaith partners and people of
goodwill in proclaiming God's vision of  peace. Together,
through our prayers and our actions, we affirm our  intention
to live into that vision.&quot;

Materials featured on the Web  site of the Presbyterian
Peacemaking Program for this year's Peace Day  observance are
prayers from the Presbyterian United Nations Office in  New
York City and a collection of prayers from Europe. They join
a  brochure from the WCC about the International Day of
Peace.

Peace worship  resources.

Peace Day has been a focal point for community-uniting  and
peace-inspiring events since its inception in 1981. Last
year more  than 3,500 Peace Day events took place in 200
countries, according to the  International Day of Peace Web
site, which also offers related  resources.

The observance comes as a group of 10 peacemakers  are
visiting the United States as part of the annual
International  Peacemakers Program of the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.).

The program  provides opportunities for leaders engaged in
peacemaking in countries around  the globe to come to the
U.S. in order to promote mutual understanding from a  global
perspective.

Since arriving Sept. 11, the peacemakers have been  visiting
churches, middle governing bodies and educational
institutions  across the country. They are scheduled to
depart the U.S. on Oct.  8.

The peacemakers are the Rev. Vilma Yanez-Ogaza from  the
Presbyterian Church of Colombia; Samuel Rizk from the Forum
for  Development, Culture and Dialogue in Lebanon; Karla
Ramos-Amaya from Casa  Semillas Integrated Ministries in El
Salvador; and Mamo Wejega Korjo from the  Ethiopian
Evangelical Church of Mekane Yesus.

Also, the Rev. Yahya  Tirta Prewita from the Purwantoro
Javanese Christian Church in Indonesia;  Maruzella Abboud
from the Near East School of Theology in Lebanon; Yody  Morán
and David Andrews from the Joining Hands Against Hunger
Network in  Peru; the Rev. Alfredo Abad-Heras from the
Iglesia Evangélica Española  (Spanish Evangelical Church);
and Elizabeth Ajak from the Sudan Council of  Churches.

The Presbyterian Peacemaking Program was created in  1980
when the General Assembly of the former United Presbyterian
Church in  the United States of America adopted Peacemaking:
The Believers'  Calling.

The work of the Presbyterian Peacemaking Program is guided
by  three affirmations outlined in the document:

The church is faithful to  Jesus Christ when it is engaged in
peacemaking.
The church is obedient to  Jesus Christ when it nurtures and
equips God's people as peacemakers.
The  church bears witness to Christ when it nurtures the
moral life of the nation  for the sake of peace in the  world.
