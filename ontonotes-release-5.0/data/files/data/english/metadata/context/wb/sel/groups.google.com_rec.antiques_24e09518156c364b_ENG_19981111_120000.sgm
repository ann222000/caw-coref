I just purchased two figurines of the Royal Bayreuth sunbonnet babies at a yard
sale. These are about 6-1/2&quot; long X 4-1/2&quot; deep X 5&quot; high. They are
beautifully done -- but obviously not antique. I imagine they were made in the
past 10 years or so. They are marked on the bottom &quot;Royal Bayreuth Designs.&quot;
The name of the day they represent is marked in English and in German. One of
the figurines has a &quot;made in Japan&quot; paper sticker on it.

I know these are not from the old Royal Bayreuth company in Germany, but can
anybody tell me anything about them? Are they licensed by Royal Bayreuth? Who
were they made by and when? Are they still available? What are they worth?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Please e-mail:
JeanBH ... @aol.com

Thanks so much!

Dear Jean,
If you will think for yourself for a minute, use the old
noodle, you will figure out exactly what these are.
It ain't rocket science, you know.

And then you end up with this? Jesus!
&quot;Are they licensed by Royal Bayreuth? Who
were they made by and when? Are they still available?
What are they worth?&quot;
Is there anything you do not want?
Have you ever once contributed one iota
of knowledge to this group?
I doubt it since you want only e-mailed to you answers.
I am not checking deja news to find out. I do not care.
Sigh...
Tell me, lady-who-is-not-reading-this, are you this
self-centered in all the time? Do you ever do anything
for someone who is not an ally or a blood relative?
If so, send me some fucking proof, because so far all
I have seen from you is memememmemememmememe and it
is pretty ugly.
I don't know you. And I do not think I care to.
T.

"/> Whoa, Trancery why are you so angry? And I mean in general? You respond to
everyone with either a polite answer yet more often you respond with such
maniacal tirades that one can't help but wonder if you are in need of
professional help. As a recent victim of yours, and being so taken aback by
your malevolent posts about me naturally I've been hesitant to speak up. But
doing a bit of my own homework, I think you need to calm down, take some deep
breaths, try and remember that these are only words on a monitor, you are not
being forced to answer/read or respond to the posts. Obviously doing so
elevates your anger level to a point where you cannot control it, rather than
risk possibly an aneurysm, why not just avoid these types of newsgroups since
they obviously upset you so. Perhaps frequent the music related newsgroups,
mellow out, listen to some relaxing Barry Manilow or Kenny G, take a break from
the arduous job of posting hate filled responses. I would hate to see you
start cutting yourself or worse, because of your instability and lack of
control. Mayhaps you should revisit some of the hypnosis clinics, or psych
wards, I'm sure they would put you back on Thorazine in an instant. Why they
need only see your obsessive behaviour online, the fact you seem to alienate
every newsgroup you post or subscribe to, that most the boards you frequent,
you are considered to be belligerent and psychotic or the other side of the
spectrum, helpful, knowledgeable but definitely off kilter.
Let's face it, you scare people, as for the ones you do seem to have a rapport
with, well I think that is self-explanatory.
Kindly do not respond to this, I am merely suggesting you seek medical
attention, or if it suits you take a long vacation from messageboards that seem
to send you into a frenzy.
Joan

Joan, the parts I enjoy the most are when you think
you are being smart. The unintentional humor is
priceless. You keep it up, sweetie. Stay just the
way you are!

By the way, what do YOU say the figures are?
Thrill me and make a guess. It is easy. You don't even
have to know anything.

T, I suppose you are referring to the post you were responding to, hell I could
care less, nor did I care that you reamed her, I'm just tired of reading &quot;some&quot;
of your wicked posts, most times I must admit, I chuckle, but there are times
when you seem to go right off the deep end with no apparent reason, sometimes
you just slap a FS or WTB post but every once in awhile you just get plain
vicious. Do you take their posts personally? I noticed you requested some
info on silver items a few months ago, yet just a few days ago you ripped some
guy a new asshole for asking similiar question. You answer one person with
charm, next post your screaming like a banshee, ranting about blah-blah, yada
yada yada. Just try &amp; relax, no need to keep posting same tirade every time,
either ignore them or tease them for days just try not to get so mean-spirited
that ya scare off everyone.
As for my unintentional humour, that's a mighty big assumption, but hey, if it
elicits a smile from you than I guess you're one step closer to walking
upright.

Hi Maryann, that certainly seems to be the general consensus.
Thank you for also standing up to that type of abuse. There are only a couple
of people on this board that seem to take great pleasure in ridiculing others.
Haven't a clue why, thought it was a slow buildup of anger because of mass
influx of advertisements &amp; inane questions but now know this is not the case.
99% of the posters are genuinely warm &amp; friendly, willing to help or direct
anyone's credible queries, that 1% though has made this particular newsgroup
very leery to offer help, request help or post anything without double checking
spelling, hoping to gawd you're not asking a question that becomes fodder for
their teasing pleasure. Now most everyone can handle teasing, what this 1%
takes pleasure in though is not even remotely considered teasing. The proof is
in every post that has ever been answered. Note that the longest threads
always have something to do with either lambasting some poor schmuck or this
type of discussion. When was the last time anyone has really carried on a
discussion about antiques that hasn't ended in the typical cryptic messages
that exclude everyone but a select few.
And note every message posted with the exception of spam &amp; 1%er's, always
relays fears of possibly getting smart-ass responses because their not sure the
topic they want to bring up is going to be acceptable. I've seen many posts
where the question is valid &amp; seems like a wonderful subject to learn about,
only to see no one responds to the question but rather starts poking fun at
either the subject, or the person or something else that happens to spark their
kill instincts.
I stay because everyone here has wonderful insights &amp; I always learn something
usually everyday, but when I learn something via the 1% it is always at a
price. Not material worth but definitely they take away a certain amount of
one's self-esteem. When you people start questioning your every post and
response in these messageboards it's like you've forgotten what this board was
intended for. All of you have something interesting to say, no one holds the
monopoly on what's topical &amp; what's not. So everyone, relax, post your
thoughts &amp; share a bit of yourself, cuz the next time I see one of those ever
so popular &quot;let's get this newbie&quot; type threads, I'm going to pray that
everyone here takes note &amp; calls a halt to those practices. I would just like
to feel comfortable enough to post a thought or a question without the worry of
getting made fun of, as I'm sure everyone here would like also.

Joan

"/>&quot;What is the price of Experience? Do men buy it for a song?
Or wisdom for a dance in the street? No, it is bought with the price
Of all that a man hath, his house, his wife, his children
Wisdom is sold in the desolate market where none come to buy
And in the wither'd field where the farmer plows for bread in vain
It is an easy thing to triumph in the summer's sun
And in the vintage and to sing on the waggon loaded with corn
It is an easy thing to talk of patience to the afflicted
To speak the laws of prudence to the homeless wanderer
To listen to the hungry raven's cry in wintry season
When the red blood is fill'd with wine and with the marrow of lambs &quot;

Blake

Lovely, yet I'm a bit baffled, are you explaining something to me? Could you
respond directly without the embellishment, I'm not very good at deciphering
what your thoughts are via someone else's writings. Just a little more clearly
this time eh?

far as ignoring Trance, I hadn't made any plans to, if he still wants to join

taking his meds, then his posts get a wee bit psychotic, I for one am worried,
this is when he'll decide to apply for a position with the post office!
