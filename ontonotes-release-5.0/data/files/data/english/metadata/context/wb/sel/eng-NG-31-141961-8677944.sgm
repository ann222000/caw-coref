Grand Juries have become Rubber Stamps for Prosecutors

Raymond Ronald Karczewski©

Grand Juries are generally used by DA's (district attorneys) to take
the heat off them on &quot;iffy&quot; or politically charged cases.

An example of that can be found in the case brought against me as
Oregon's first Paper Terrorist (Simulation of Legal Process) for
attempting to hold my public officials accountable for their
corruption and criminal conduct in the prosecution of my case
03CR0170.

The corrupt,  underhanded, and despicable DA (District Attorney) CLAY
E. JOHNSON (who has since retired from office at the peak of his
career) conducted a secret Grand Jury Session in January of 2003, when
the STATE OF OREGON AND COUNTY OF JOSEPHINE anticipated that I would
file a Commercial Claim against them for their repeated Commercial
Defaults in their refusal to answer the questions of Jurisidiction
over this Living, Breathing, Flesh-and-Blood, Sentient, Natural Man.
See:  the oft-repeated demand, but never answered, 23 questions of
Jurisdiction contained in &quot;The Two Million Dollar Traffic Stop&quot;
http://www.arkenterprises.com/gptraff.html and the subsequent
Commercial Judgement which resulted from such repeated defaults:  See:
http://www.arkenterprises.com/tortjoco.html

He sat on it for seven months before moving on it, doing nothing but
waiting and watching, waiting and watching, waiting and watching to
see what I would do.

When I filed the defaulted Commercial Judgment with the Secretary of
State's office In Salem Oregon, and it became a matter of Public
Record they came after me, arrested me, and the rest is, as they say,
American Jurisprudence History in the making (When a fiction court can
blithely, without cause, but upon the whim of equally fictional
lawyers and judges,  prosecute a non-fiction Living, Breathing, Flesh-
and-Blood, Sentient, Natural Man, without his consent, waiver of
rights or contract --  When the servant has the audacity to punish his
master --  when tyranny begins to make sense to the common man who has
lost his God-given, good sense, then and only then does a BASSACKWARD
SOCIETY MAKE SENSE.)

As to the relevance of Grand Juries as they now exist, read my wife
Anita's experience as she attempted to bring up a Grand Jury
Investigation into VOTER FRAUD in JOSEPHINE COUNTY, OREGON before it
became fashionable in the rest of the country.  See:  HISTORY OF GRAND
JURY INVESTIGATION INTO VOTE FRAUD IN JOSEPHINE COUNTY, OREGON
http://www.arkenterprises.com/dialch16.htm#HISTORY

This man and wife have faced down more government &quot;boogeymen&quot; than you
long talking, short walking political theorists  can shake a stick
at.   While few like Ed and Elaine Brown, and Ray and Anita Karczewski
act, the rest of you talk, talk, talk.

I'm losing patience with you folks.  Ed's and Elaine's time is running
out, and you're still talking.

Grand juries are empaneled to determine if a serious enough crime has
been committed to  charge someone. I thought you said you'd been to
law school. Did you get the application to attend off a match book
cover?

ITYM, attempting to extort money from the Officers of the Court
in your state. It is a legal charge, and has been upheld by the legal,
and lawful courts of Oregon. Whether you recognize the legality of
the Oregon courts is irrelevent.

Libel on its face. If you had anything worth owning, he could sue
your sorry ass, and walk out of the JoCo courts with title to your
property, real, and personal. You would give it up, and whine about
having to pay the man...but you'd cough up.

I can hardly wait.

Lie. He retired because he was of an age to. He has effectively
removed himself from your target list.

Nice spin. Too bad it's all a load of bollocks. His Grand Jury was no
different from hundreds of others called into session. You've been
to law school. Find one of your law texts and look it up.

There were no such &quot;Judgments&quot; rendered. &quot;Judgments are a legal
finding. Do you have a case number relating to these so-called
&quot;judgments?&quot;

As I recall, the state of Oregon declared your demands for state money
to be absolutely bogus, and in the absence of any defense of your
filings declared them null and void. The state does not have to act on
any filings it currently does not have. I seem to remember, yours were
gleefully trashed by the Oregon State LEOs.

You can't collect shit, if there's no paper.

Why the Hell do you insist on repeating stuff three times? Wasn't it
you who insisted that repetition was a sign of ignorance? Why yes,
I do believe it was you.

You're a real piece of work, Raymond! Under which article of the
Constitution is this pipe dream found? Show me the Law (where have I
read this before?) that says a criminal, charged with a crime has to
consent to being prosecuted for that crime. Come on, Fatboi, show us
the Law!

Yeah? So what? The proceedings didn't go the way you programmed
Anita to influence them. BFSD! According to the trash I just read on
your web shite, no testimony was offered that might have uncovered
a smoking gun. No election irregularities were detected. Maybe, just
maybe, THERE WEREN'T ANY, you ineducable, conspiracy-sniffing
piece of cat feces!

BULL-FUCKING-SHIT! You'fre government masters said &quot; jump,&quot; and
&quot;shit!&quot; serially, and you dirtied yourself on the way down. You are
not a hero. You are a feckless coward, and I predict you will die at
your computer with foam dribbling out of the cornes of your mouth.
And poor Anita will be charged with cleaning yet another of your

Three convicted felons, and a woman on her deathbed. Quite a

I'm sure we'd all be quick to follow your stellar example, if you'd
gather up your balls and go to Connecticut to stand shoulder to
shoulder with those other two felons.
