What sex bullies?  Where?

I don't know about Shakespeare's &quot;outlook,&quot; which seems difficult to
determine unless (like Michael Martin) you have privileged access to
his psychic remains, and I haven't seen much &quot;androgyny&quot; in terms of
true sexual ambiguity; what I do see quite a lot is sex role
reversal.  And that's far more pervasive than people realize:  but
Shakespeare *generally* uses role reversal far more than people
realize.  I'm inclined to say that it's an effect of his technique
which we recognize more easily because we are looking for &quot;androgyny.&quot;

Nor do I especially see much Marxism in his work; at least not the
Marxism of Marx or Engels.  Does he talk about themes of wealth,
privilege and power?  Sure.  Does that reflect a modern social concern
with the economic discourse around privately-held means of
production?  No.

exactly what are you accusing your alleged sex bullies of doing?  I

In this ng, Ms. Mouse posted a bad limerick which invaded my sexual
privacy in May and would not have been allowed (in the sense of
attracting a consensus of condemnation) coming from a guy. I persuaded
her to remove it but for an interval, other posters repeated the
bullying attempt to replace on-topic discussion with discussion of my
private sexuality.

Shakespeare is conscious, in a way ordinary men couldn't then and
cannot now be conscious, of &quot;being a man&quot;.

For the ordinary man, discussion of his manhood above the physical
level is a no-fly zone because in industrial society his sexuality is
a public good and a public danger. Shakespeare however is able to have
his women challenge male leadership both on its own terms (as when the
termagant Margaret screeches at Henry VI for not living up to a moral
order that she has no first-person acquaintance with) and on common
human ethical terms.

But to speak from the female point of view a man has to be
&quot;androgynous&quot;. Shakespeare would never title a play &quot;'tis a Pity She's
a Whore&quot;.

Note the bimbo-feminist's anxiety when men cease in fact to be boys
and start to try to be androgynous. Many women are creeped out by
androgyny as seen in Alan Alda. In Shakespeare classes, students have
to confront the reality of Hamlet's failure, over four acts, to be a
&quot;man&quot;.

Shakespeare shows how to solve this particular &quot;tragic equation&quot;. He
rejects magnamity as a solution: Henry V is magnaminous but not a man
able to solidly found the Lancastrian legitimacy, as Chorus says at
the end, because Henry won a battle but lost a war (in a striking
parallel to modern Iraq) by making alpha-male demands at the peace
conference.

Reread Lear, Conrad. &quot;Take physic, pomp: expose thyself to what
wretches feel&quot;.

Shakespeare, of course, didn't read Marx. But Marx read Shakespeare
both in translation and original and he, and Engels in Manchester, saw
that the problem with industrial society is the way that through
commodification it replaces the green world of free choice with the
grey world where Isabella has to &quot;keep her job&quot; and not say &quot;justice,
justice, justice, justice&quot;: the world of modern America where you're
never &quot;wasting time&quot; if you &quot;make money&quot;.

Read Norman Mailer's The Gospel According to the Son: in it, Christ
tells the story of his Passion, Death and Resurrection in first
person.

As an Essene, he comes out of the desert touching neither wine nor
women, but at the Marriage Feast of Cana, he starts to drink and carry
on with &quot;bad&quot; women. He realizes that the power isn't within him it's
outside him as well and that the next step is to let go of the final
sense of pride, by being &quot;unclean&quot;.

MM:
Spinoza, you seem to be stuck on square one.  There are reasons behind
what they posted against you.  Those posts didn't come out of
nowhere.  There is an iceberg under that tip, which is above the
surface.  They felt, IMO, that you were invading their self-images.
IOW, you were getting into their privacy.  You need to look at the
causes of things, and not just the results.  Her limerick was more
directed to you, but you were writing about Anti-Strats in rather
derogatory fashion, I'd say.  Try to get off square one, and go to
square two.

Exactly.  Precisely.  It is not just the women, either.  Men are
really seeking the Divine Feminine.  Women are seeking the Divine
Masculine.  Neither will necessarily fit in our preconceived

He could also be at the level of the Supreme Being.  The same could be
said of the Divine Feminine, Mary Magdalene.  Christ called her, &quot;The
woman who knew all.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Heinous and bogus

&gt; &gt; &gt; balderdash.  And Bloom, it seems to me, is writing very much from and

This newsgroup is about the truth of Shakespeare, and Shakespeare
Denial is a lie. If you look at the archive, the de-rogation's object
was NOT the personalities or sexual privacy of the Deniers except
indirectly.

The Scholastic principle of the &quot;double effect&quot; applies. I defend what
I believe to be the truth (and as a statement issuable by me this
reduces to &quot;I defend truth&quot;, a statement which leaves people free to
not believe me). I defend truth with vigor and attack the false (what
I believe to be false) with a certain elan, a certain ferocity, a
certain *furor Nilgentium&quot;.

In Scholastic &quot;just war&quot; theory, the evil of war is permitted when it
has the double effect of securing victory and peace in a just war and
causing death and destruction. Thus the &quot;level 3&quot; hurt feelings were I
think justified.

But they weren't only justified by Scholasticism. They were also
justified because as I have repeatedly said, they were on topic.
Calling Shakespeare Denial a small-f fascist artifact was something
ABOUT Shakespeare biography.

Whereas invading my sexual privacy was among other things off-topic.

I will NOT be brought down to the level of this newsgroup, and I WILL
post from my level, which I sadly conclude is higher, even though the
thought leaders may have studied Shakespeare in school or may be
actors of Shakespeare. I sadly conclude this, because what it means is
that post-graduate higher education may be a fraud which produces
dickless wonders and harridans.

A male of female can be androgyne with strong bisexual drives.
Androgyny isn't a one-dimensional scale such that you lose sex drives
in the middle. Titania, for example, is apparently bisexual, since,
reading between the lines, she couples with Oberon after the
resolution and with a mortal woman, in Arabia.

Queer theorists tell us that the modern concept of homosexuality as an
exclusive drive was manufactured by authority to define a class of men
who could be persecuted. This model is falling apart: for example,
Alan Bennett's play and film The History Boys has modern English
school-boys who acknowledge and accept bisexual drives.

It's that males seem to fall-off from being &quot;sexy&quot; as far as
discriminating women are concern after a certain set-point wherein
their bravery becomes suicidal or braggadocio. Speaking for myself, I
am attracted to self-assertive females including cops and soldiers who
are women, but up to a similar set-point: I punch out at the &quot;PMS,
handcuffs and a gun&quot; syndrome in lady police officers, for example.

Shakespeare saw clearly that instincts are good, and made for one
purpose alone: survival. His pathology is generally about a cancerous
overdevelopment of one instinct, be that Brutus' instinct to be the
noble Roman, Lear's instinct to retire, or even, possibly, Hamlet's
instinct to think, an instinct unique to humans. As soon as the
instinct doesn't contribute to human survival, Shakespeare punches
out.

Thus androgyny would have kept Mercutio and Tybalt ALIVE.

I am past the point of wondering about whether I'm normal, having
accepted at a deep level that I'm not and need not apply for
acceptance on the basis of a normality (for good or bad) I don't
possess. In certain ways, especially verbal, I am off the charts as
was my father before me. But then I had no math anxiety, and was able
to cobble together a successful software career as a result.

For this reason, I can assure you that I felt no sexual anxiety about
dick length when Ms Mouse posted. I was instead concerned that other
men, less self-confident, would be mistreated when a man cannot so
much as make a peep about female sexuality without some bimbo-feminist
coven hounding him.

Can I add a couple of notes?

The first aspect is, if we credit Yalom's Birth of the Chess Queen, a study
of the power of women 1000 the current time, and its concommitant
representation of the female on the chess board. The first and most
startling factor is the transmogrification of the wimpy 'minister' figure,
into the most powerful piece on the board, and a gender change.

A second factor is that through the middle-ages women players competed
successfully with men at the board, to at least parity. They also did this
politically, with perhaps the most powerful monarchs in Europe being female.

Yalom comments that have achieved this parity, including full right to
property, etc, this period reached its apex during the Elizabethan era. So
contextually that is the exoteric background, or the polity of gender.

Otherwise, the philosophic system in Europe attained a different idea of
what people were, which was neither Protestant nor Catholic, yet still
biblical. To represent what is male or female /in philosophic terms/ it is
necessary to remember the semiotic shift of image :: thing represented. This
sysmbol system had several forms, all rooted in a combination of esoteric
Hewbrew and Christian mythology - and that represented every person as both
male and female. Even 'the first man' was admitted to have a woman inside
him - Eve emerging from 'Adam's Rib' is a symbolic reference, no? Its not a
serious suggestion of creactionist bio-chemistry!

To look at the development of the symbolic representation of man's
understanding to the cosmos at this juncture, in such systems as John Dee,
whether we take the alternating zyzygy of astrology, or the male/female
alchemical 'man', or even the alternating male and female forms in Tarot -
we see Western thought engaging yin/yang appreciations as in oriental
systems.

Now -- to interpolate these symbol systems with gender identities is
possible -- and there may be merit in doing so, though a reader must
consider that that may not have been the intention, which symbolically was:-

All people are male on the outside, and female on the inside.

If that statement is read as a mythos, or as a statement of psychological
semantic worth - then you arrive at the core factors powering the Western
tradition.

The gloom surrounding Macbeth begins exactly here, with a man confronted by

them not, but we do! We in the audience sense something awfully wrong.

That is almost certainly an unintended oxymoron. The word &quot;Chaos&quot; is itself
a binary companion to &quot;Cosmos&quot; in an even earlier philosophical system. You
cannot ban one of them any more than you could ban July and not December.

Cosmos constellates; it takes all there is and inter-relates them to a
whole - but this act does not create or renew life, and thus Cosmos, like
December, gives way to Spring and ultimately to July when all is dissolved
into Chaotic soup, but from which mess bubbles up new life, combinations and
so on.

In the sense of Kali Yuga above - what ancient system there was is now at
its weakest, but also has attained via Chaos the greatest valency for
regeneration. And thank God! Since we would be stuck forever with the
worship of cows, and so on, which may even have made sense at one time, but
how so is no longer known, or useful to us.

Indeed, it is not even the most advanced 'Hindoo' thought to wish to avoid
further incarnation, but actually to fully arrive here on the planet, rather
than hovering an inch above the ground for one's whole life, speculating on
means of escape or to catch a ride with a Savior, headed outta here. The

A more perceptive mythos for our time is perhaps perceived in Tolkien, who
mentioned the age of wizards and heroes passing, and now its up to us
hobbits!

Well, I don't want to argue anything of any particular religion, except
these mentions of symbolic thought are the inner sponsors of what is
ex-pressed.
And rejection of the female is man's [everyone's outer self] plight - just
as at the meta-level some religious expressions [Christianity too] have
rejected the 'female' Mother-Earth.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have not followed you on this.  I see females being matched with
&gt; &gt;&gt; males to achieve sexual fulfillment, and males being matched with
&gt; &gt;&gt; females for the same purpose, however you want to look at it.  I don't
&gt; &gt;&gt; think a female would like to be matched with an &quot;androgynous,&quot; male?

&gt; &gt; A male of female can be androgyne with strong bisexual drives.
&gt; &gt; Androgyny isn't a one-dimensional scale such that you lose sex drives
&gt; &gt; in the middle. Titania, for example, is apparently bisexual, since,
&gt; &gt; reading between the lines, she couples with Oberon after the
&gt; &gt; resolution and with a mortal woman, in Arabia.

Husserl's phenomenology may offer a way out of this mess, which is
evident in the course arguments take in this ng, where people have to
be &quot;right&quot; when they're wrong. To me, phenomenology is stopping
smoking, and no longer being able to deny the reality of &quot;big&quot;
constructs and events, such as Sep 11.

A phenomenological approach allowed me to for example read the New
York Times and, in the interests of survival, understand the full
horror of what had happened by meditation and perhaps prayer about and
for Father Mike Judge. His death summed it up: this wasn't an ordinary
disaster: the NYFD was decimated, even the chaplain, and bodies rained
like fruit from the skies.

&quot;Denial&quot; such as logical positivism inculcates in its refusal to
accept the voice of the emotions, wasn't possible. I had to say to
myself, whoa, holy fucking shit, this is BIG, and is my family OK.

Our human capability for analysis, in Adorno, can not be said to be
anything more than one more evolutionary trick intended purely for
survival of the person who thinking about that capability, in an

yes - Krishna is 'the perfect man' and 'Cosmos'. But any such stage is
frozen as a sort of museum icon, not dynamically interactive now. Krishna is
a form which can only be elsewhere, since here, all is interactive duality.
Even the idea of a non-intereractive duality does not exist in nature, not
man's, not in the nature of nature, and not in the nature of 'god', and not
that there are multiple natures!

Of course, given the conditions under which people live their lives in

activity in which we pretend to engage...communicative reason in which
(cf. Kant and Habermas) a quantum of good faith, based on a modicum of
common courtesy and management of hostility, is a given.

What is nonsense is to pretend that the managed hostility isn't
present, and to generalize any sign of anger to be a prime mover.
Missing is consideration of the possibility that the anger is there
but is not the motivation.

The things I take issue with are not in fact minor matters of
interpretation or taste. Shakespeare Denial, which is the main view
I've taken issue with since January of this year, is a conspiracy
theory which requires that one &quot;question&quot; the entire corpus of
professional Shakespeare scholarship since Nicholas Rowe and Samuel
Johnson. In fact, it reverses the view of men who had more access,
perhaps, to records, and, most definitely, to the nuances of
Shakespeare's early modern English. This was that Shakespeare's FLAW
was that he was not a man of aristocratic views (a major thesis of the
Shakespeare Deniers who maintain that Shakespeare &quot;must have been&quot;
aristocratic) and not a university man (a major thesis of the
&quot;Marlovians&quot;).

A man or woman engaged in communicative reason does not base an entire
theory on the certainty that scholarship as an ongoing effort can be a
tissue of lies. This is not because he or she is naive. It is because
such an assumption violates something derivable from and related to
Kant's &quot;categorical imperative&quot; (so act that your action can be
recommended as a moral law for everybody).

Just as theft (&quot;I take what you have and make it MINE, MY own private
property) violates private property and renders theft itself moot, to
want to participate seriously in Shakespeare scholarship by denying a
consensus AND charging professionals with lying is to render your own
scholarship easy prey to a Thermidor, in which the legitimacy of the
rebellious is questioned and in play by more rebels.

Now, this doesn't mean that one can NEVER question legitimacy, whether
scholarly or political. In point of fact, there come historical
junctures where you have to. But no such time has arrived in
Shakespeare studies.

My opponents on this issue, and the issue of whether women should be
permitted in this ng to sexually harass men without no such license
being given to men, and in such a way that productive exchange turns
into the defense of one's intimate legitimacy, are consistently making
extraordinary attacks, whether on persons (such as Michael or Phil
Innes) or on scholars, attacks which are terroristic in Lyotard's
sense (cf. The Postmodern Condition) because they seek to eliminate
the possibility of dialogue.

This is bad faith because in the ethical register it destroys a common
treasury and in the cognitive register it is a contradiction. For this
reason, I owe no surplus courtesy to my opponents beyond the basic
recognition they deserve, where I DON'T (where I HAVEN'T) called them
&quot;raca, thou fool&quot;.

The Shakespeare Deniers and sexual harassers do NOT act in good faith,

Of Corsican, as Napoleon said. Read the corpus, read the text. Queen
Margaret, the termagant harridan bimbo who is married to the boy king
Henry VI in the eponymous trilogy, is forever hammering on what a man
and a king should be, in the annoying way of women who don't
themselves have to step up to the plate.

[Don't mess with me about the History plays. I decided to test myself,
so I took a test on the Histories at http://shakespeare.about.com/library/blhistoriesquiz.htm
and scored 100% without preparation or looking at another Web site.
You have to know the name of Richard III's horse to pass this test.]

Leontes and Othello are anguished about &quot;being a man&quot;. Whereas
Marlowe's heroes take manhood for granted and seek an excess or
surplus manhood through pacts with the Devil and with conquest.
Marlowe did craft the character of Edward II but stands outside it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; For the ordinary man, discussion of his manhood above the physical
&gt; &gt; level is a no-fly zone because in industrial society his sexuality is

&gt; level...  not necessarily to the public good.

&gt; &gt; a public good and a public danger. Shakespeare however is able to have
&gt; &gt; his women challenge male leadership both on its own terms (as when the
&gt; &gt; termagant Margaret screeches at Henry VI for not living up to a moral
&gt; &gt; order that she has no first-person acquaintance with) and on common
&gt; &gt; human ethical terms.

&gt; So, the fact that Shakespeare wrote female parts well -- by which we
&gt; mean we like them -- demonstrates he was more androgynous than other
&gt; men, rather than that he was simply a better writer?

But what makes him a &quot;better writer&quot;? You beg the question. Being a

&quot;creative writing&quot; imagine, a matter of soullessly learning stunts and
tricks. It's EMPATHY.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Hamlet's advice to Polonius was about how Polonius should treat the
Players. Polonius was planning to shit on them because they were of
the lower class.

But when Polonius, earlier in the play, harasses Hamlet, Hamlet tells
Polonius that old men are fools whose eyes drip plum color'd gum.

To treat a man after your own honor and dignity is to tune the
treatment meted out to the substantive reality of the situation. The
Players offended no-one and therefore did not deserve the treatment
Polonius and Claudius would probably have given them...a cuff, a blow,
and cheating on their pay.

Whereas here, people expect &quot;honor and dignity&quot; to accorded buffoonish
and sexually harassing conduct, completely discredited Shakespeare
Denial which destroys and undercuts three centuries of scholarship,
and Bubba Hoss Pard Grumman's bizarre theory that a real man can
theorize without reading.

&gt; Yes, you broke the rules. This is why it is clownish of you below to
&gt; be a Parent and to advise me on the behalf of the group as to the
&gt; &quot;real&quot; rules of conduct.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've got to say, I'm with Martin on this one:  although I agree with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your assessment concerning the authorship question (that is, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shakespeare plays are written by Shakespeare, and there is little or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no substantial evidence to the contrary), I think your &quot;scholastic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just war&quot; argument simply provides you with an excuse to attack
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people.

&gt; &gt; &gt; ....which leaves you at a loss to explain my hostility, which means,
&gt; &gt; &gt; in turn, that we may take hostility as a *primum mobile*...a given.

&gt; &gt; We've observing you behaving in a hostile manner; that's not exactly a
&gt; &gt; given.  Especially since what you do give you cannot take.

&gt; Who's &quot;we&quot;? And rules applicable to a punch-up don't apply. Any way oo
&gt; oo I broke the rules...your rules.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, given the conditions under which people live their lives in
&gt; &gt; &gt; cities, this may make some sense. But, it makes futile the very
&gt; &gt; &gt; activity in which we pretend to engage...communicative reason in which
&gt; &gt; &gt; (cf. Kant and Habermas) a quantum of good faith, based on a modicum of
&gt; &gt; &gt; common courtesy and management of hostility, is a given.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What is nonsense is to pretend that the managed hostility isn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; present, and to generalize any sign of anger to be a prime mover.

&gt; &gt; I'm advocating that you manage your hostility better.

&gt; I think I do a great job since I make constructive contributions to
&gt; this ng such as the quiz post using my anger as an energy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Missing is consideration of the possibility that the anger is there
&gt; &gt; &gt; but is not the motivation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The things I take issue with are not in fact minor matters of
&gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation or taste.

&gt; &gt; What I take issue with is that you act like a child, and you have a

&gt; More precisely you fear you are a child. Anyone who can start a post,
&gt; lecturing another on the behalf of a &quot;we&quot; on conduct with &quot;oo oo I
&gt; broke the rules&quot; is a child who is unaware of a major contradiction.

&gt; &gt; punishing, petty way of phrasing your posts that lowers the quality of
&gt; &gt; the discussion.  Maybe you get a kick out of it; but remember that
&gt; &gt; those points you do make are rarely considered, because people are too
&gt; &gt; preoccupied wondering when you'll wipe yourself.

&gt; ...and a child introduces the toilet sooner or later. Also, a child's
&gt; greatest anxiety is acceptance by his peers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Shakespeare Denial, which is the main view
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've taken issue with since January of this year, is a conspiracy
&gt; &gt; &gt; theory which requires that one &quot;question&quot; the entire corpus of
&gt; &gt; &gt; professional Shakespeare scholarship since Nicholas Rowe and Samuel
&gt; &gt; &gt; Johnson. In fact, it reverses the view of men who had more access,
&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps, to records, and, most definitely, to the nuances of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Shakespeare's early modern English. This was that Shakespeare's FLAW
&gt; &gt; &gt; was that he was not a man of aristocratic views (a major thesis of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Shakespeare Deniers who maintain that Shakespeare &quot;must have been&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic) and not a university man (a major thesis of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Marlovians&quot;).

&gt; &gt; &gt; A man or woman engaged in communicative reason does not base an entire
&gt; &gt; &gt; theory on the certainty that scholarship as an ongoing effort can be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; tissue of lies. This is not because he or she is naive. It is because
&gt; &gt; &gt; such an assumption violates something derivable from and related to
&gt; &gt; &gt; Kant's &quot;categorical imperative&quot; (so act that your action can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; recommended as a moral law for everybody).

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just as theft (&quot;I take what you have and make it MINE, MY own private
&gt; &gt; &gt; property) violates private property and renders theft itself moot, to
&gt; &gt; &gt; want to participate seriously in Shakespeare scholarship by denying a

I admit, there have been times in my life I've watched old reruns.
The last time was perhaps 3 years ago in a doctor's waiting room.  It
was _I Dream Of Genie_, the episode where Whatsisname was trying to
figure out how to desalinate sea water, to make a name for himself,
while Genie wanted to go flying on a magic carpet.  Genie, being
immortal, could indulge in her senses, whereas Whatsisname needed to
secure a legacy.

No, I'm remembering what job I had at the time, and that was five
years ago.  Since then I've seen some _Twilight Zones_, but those I
got out of the library, so I'm not sure they quite qualify as &quot;old
reruns.&quot;  And I saw them on someone else's set, yes.

The problem is your ontology...your sense of what is, and this was set
in your childhood when, in all probability, you sat in front of TV.

I had a few years free of TV in my formative years since TV didn't
come to my neighborhood until 1954. 8 years after that I abandoned TV,
and today I don't have cable or network television.

A South African friend didn't have TV until 1975. This wasn't a good
thing, of course: the apartheid government banned TV lest he and other
people of color in SA get ideas. But, he became a Rhodes scholar and
has a keen critical sense.

To the TV watcher, expressible opinions, opinions that can be put into
clear language, seem predictable since they don't conform to the
structure of TV, in which constant novelty is presented ironically.

And, people who make outlandish claims such as Bubba Bob Hoss Pard
Grumman, that one doesn't need to read only think, have lost the right
to disagree with me. As have people who simultaneously violate rules
while defending the &quot;rules&quot;.

Note that you remember it. It fascinated you despite the fact that it
was tripe, known to be such at the time it was made, and made for
profit.

And the SAME spirit that powers Shakespeare Denial is destroying
libraries, which are places for books and not DVDs.

Well, when you have a beautiful woman on screen saying, &quot;Master, let's
go for a magic carpet ride, please, Master, please!&quot;  --and the guy's
ignoring her, it tends to draw you in.  Why?  Because it's contrary to
experience.

Was it tripe?  Well.  Time will tell.

Funny.  I saw _Hamlet_ on a DVD from the local library just the other
day.  Free, too.
