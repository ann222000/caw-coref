Simon Cowell Quitting &quot;Idol&quot; After Three More Seasons

Music mogul Simon Cowell will quit American Idol after three more
seasons.

The British pop svengali has found stars Kelly Clarkson, Ruben
Studdard, Fantasia Barrino, Carrie Underwood, Taylor Hicks, and Jordin
Sparks on the first six seasons of the show and is currently in the
middle of auditioning wannabe singers for season seven.

Despite the show's phenomenal success, Cowell admits he can't see past
season 10.

He says, &quot;There has to come a point when I will step down from being
on camera and remain behind the scenes because you can't keep doing
this for ever.

&quot;I have three more seasons under contract with American Idol and that
will be it. And it will probably come at the same time (for British
talent show The X Factor) in the U.K.

&quot;I am contracted for another two or three seasons in Britain and I
think by that point the public will be sick to death of me anyway and
it will be time to go.&quot;
___ end

&quot;After three more seasons&quot;? - That's not really &quot;quitting&quot; IMO, that's
just getting bored.

This presumes the show does not crash and burn sooner. The market is so
saturated with such shows and the last two years were so weak, it would
be no surprise if AI's numbers started tanking as soon as the final 12
are selected. If this season doesn't have a Kelly or Carrie, sayonara Simon.

I agree - and SLGreg has a really goods point as well.

Just thinking of the thinning talent pool - Idol may only have a few
good years left, unless they shake it up a bit; different age classes
(young/med/older), instruments, dance performance, etc.  They've
already raised the age limit once, I'm thinking they may have to lower
it or make other moves in order to keep the contest interesting,
Lythgoe has already acknowledged that some changes are in order.

If he can't see past season 10, then he has four more seasons.  (Not
faulting you, Dave; it's either Simon or the author of the article who
can't count.)

I have a feeling the audience and especially the music buying public
will have jumped ship long before Cowell does.  I'm not even sure I'm
coming back for Season 7.

Simon will be around, current contract or not, as long as AI is on.
He's holding X-Factor in his back pocket and he does not want Fox, IMHO,
to think that he tanked AI for X-Factor.  This is especially true

I just don't see this show going that long, frankly.  The show,
although I watch it faithfully, has little if any credibility with
me.  Their track record just isn't that good.  When you consider that
the guy voted out at #4 in Season 5 outsold every other contestant in
CDs this year, you have to wonder about the wisdom of the current
system.  Being the cynical Pollyanna that I am, I keep hoping that
someone with real talent will win and sweep all the doubts away as
they win every award known to the industry, but I just don't see how
that can work with the current system.  As you all know, I haven't
agreed with the final outcome on any AI except for the 1st season.
I'm no expert, but I think I have pretty good ears.

I think it is, dave.  Even now, years later, they have not brought Pop
Idol back because it is seen as diminished relative to X-Factor.  It
certainly scared the bejeebers enough out of Fox, IMHO, for them to
contractually black in out in the American market as they are reported
to have done via Cowell's current contract.

It's not a line extension to AI, it is the conqueror of it. If it ever
makes it to American tv, either after AI ends or through some other
means, it will dwarf it. Cowell's concept is that much better, IMHO,
than Fuller's of AI....and Fuller's concept was/is pretty terrific.

From what I've read, Pop Idol ran 2 seasons and X Factor started in what
would have been Idol's 3rd season.  It appears that Cowell was leaving
Idol to produce X Factor, and the network chose to go with his new show
instead of Idol.  Maybe they figured Idol would tank without him.

If you've ever seen much of an X-Factor on youtube, it's pretty easy to
understand why it would eviscerate Idol if it ever went up against it.

Do you really think Simon Fuller would have pulled his show just because
Simon Cowell wouldn't be on it?  Those Brits have all known each other
and worked together for years as well as competed against each other.

Fuller saw the future and folded the tent, rather than take the hit.  He
can revive the show at any time and be safe as a result. It's being
discussed now in Britain but, supposedly, only if it does not run
against X-Factor, during the same period of time, not time period.

AI has, at least IMHO, two more years where even the trash beginning
shows will lead the pack.  About then, Hollywood week will be when the
ratings kick in, if no changes are made before then.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds to me like he'd go now if it weren't for the contract(s).

&gt; &gt; &gt; Simon will be around, current contract or not, as long as AI is on.
&gt; &gt; &gt; He's holding X-Factor in his back pocket and he does not want Fox, IMHO,
&gt; &gt; &gt; to think that he tanked AI for X-Factor.  This is especially true
&gt; &gt; &gt; considering how fast X-Factor wiped Pop Idol out in England.

&gt; &gt; Don't agree that 'X-Factor' wiped out 'Pop Idol', did the two ever
&gt; &gt; compete for ratings?

&gt; Nope.

&gt; &gt; X-Factor &quot;outlasted&quot; Idol, but it wasn't due to it being a better
&gt; &gt; program.

&gt; I think it is, dave.  Even now, years later, they have not brought Pop
&gt; Idol back because it is seen as diminished relative to X-Factor.  It
&gt; certainly scared the bejeebers enough out of Fox, IMHO, for them to
&gt; contractually black in out in the American market as they are reported
&gt; to have done via Cowell's current contract.
">

I agree with all that - but IMO Pop-Idol would only be seen as a
diminished relative because it was taken off the air for reasons other
than losing viewership/ratings to X-Factor.

This is where we disagree - in order to conquer something, there has

Disagree - I'm not all that impressed with the X-Factor format nor
feel that it's all that much better than Idol's.  IIRC, Idol &quot;used&quot; to
have a somewhat similar format, with judges selecting their favorite/
sponsored performer, plus wild cards, etc. it didn't work then, and it
won't work on a new (to American viewers) Idol wannabe talent show.

What made X-Factor a better known show this year, in its Third season,
was Leona Lewis and her pimping by TPTB.  Other than that, I'd guess
not many American viewers have ever heard of X-Factor.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Cowell's concept is that much better, IMHO,

Nah - I see Cowell's idea with X-Factor as more an attempt to distance
himself and his property from Idol, it didn't work - to the point of
Fuller now having joint ownership in X-Factor as Cowell/Freemantle
chose to settle out of court.

Nope. AI's audience is fundamentally optimistic. Each year they hope to
see real talent win, but I think they're getting jaded. I believe if
this year they perceive little or no talent in the final 12, they will
start to bail out, though the ratings will get a bump for the last
couple of weeks. Look for a deeper ratings trough in middle weeks of the
finals (9-4 contestants) than in former years.

&gt; Simon Cowell Quitting &quot;Idol&quot; After Three More Seasons

&gt; Music mogul Simon Cowell will quit American Idol after three more
&gt; seasons.

&gt; The British pop svengali has found stars Kelly Clarkson, Ruben
&gt; Studdard, Fantasia Barrino, Carrie Underwood, Taylor Hicks, and Jordin
&gt; Sparks on the first six seasons of the show and is currently in the
&gt; middle of auditioning wannabe singers for season seven.

&gt; Despite the show's phenomenal success, Cowell admits he can't see past
&gt; season 10.

&gt; He says, &quot;There has to come a point when I will step down from being
&gt; on camera and remain behind the scenes because you can't keep doing
&gt; this for ever.

&gt; &quot;I have three more seasons under contract with American Idol and that
&gt; will be it. And it will probably come at the same time (for British
&gt; talent show The X Factor) in the U.K.

&gt; &quot;I am contracted for another two or three seasons in Britain and I
&gt; think by that point the public will be sick to death of me anyway and
&gt; it will be time to go.&quot;

That's presuming there is 3 more seasons.  I'm pretty sure at least
for myself last season was finally it...I was on the fence initially
about even watching last season.  We shall see whether they can hold
the ratings that long.

Hillary Clinton does not have to count two votes to know she will beat

To a degree, I understand where Mike is coming from.  If you want to
use the word &quot;rigged,&quot; so be it, but the fact is that the producers
&quot;nudge&quot; the viewing audience into keeping around the ones they think
have the most potential, both for record sales and good human interest
television.  This season they went too far in the latter direction and
it backfired on them.  In choosing the Top 24, I don't think they ever
saw either Jordin or Blake as a top 2 finalist.  My feeling is they
were trying to find another black diva and figured it would be Melinda
and LaKisha at the end.  When LaKisha tanked it by being all over the
place vocally and possessing not an ounce of charisma or stage
presence and Melinda, who was basically flawless vocally and was a
sweet, unassuming soul, probably skewed unpopularly with focus groups,
they went on and pushed Blake and Jordin.  Blake can't sing to save
his life, but he had the &quot;it&quot; factor with the little girls, as
probably did Jordin with all the big-assed goofy Ugly Bettys who dream
of being a star instead of getting knocked up in high school.

I do think the show has a team of analysts who study the marketing
potential of every Top 24 semi-finalist way before the show begins
airing live.  They know who to push and who to let fall by the
wayside, otherwise they would give everyone equal air time with the
backstories.  And if their initial findings skew differently once the
voting begins, they can easily find things to use to back their new
front runners. They are not going to leave this solely up to the
voting public, even if they don't actually fake the votes themselves.

However, if a situation like Sanjaya would have made it to the danger
zone of the Top Three, I think they probably have a contingency plan.
But it's not a conspiracy, it's just television and, in a larger
sense, business.  Anyone who thinks it's all just left up to the
American public with no fiddling about, well... I won't tell you the
truth about Santa Claus.

It's likely Idol won't beat XF in the ratings 'now', due to it's being
previously cancelled and allowing XF to gain a giant foothold in
market share, publicity, and name recognition.
Where we disagree again is in our opinions of XF's success should it
be ported to the U.S.  Doing so would place it in almost the same
position the 'comeback' version of Pop Idol will be in in the U.K. I
think - where AI has been a ratings monster and ingrained in the
'merican publics brains, any following programs with similar themes
will be viewed as knockoffs, which technically speaking, X-Factor is.
I would think Cowell's absence would be a major strike against it -
perhaps not the kiss of death, but sorely missed for sure.

&gt;&gt; Finding the pony in the room filled with horse shit is the fundamental

&gt;&gt; Bowes to whatever proceeded &quot;dish night&quot; at the Bijou.

&gt; Mickey, you might want to consider posting in the 23 Skidoo room,
&gt; because no one under the age of 80 understands what the fuck you're
&gt; talking about with these pre-&quot;Crash of '29&quot; colloquialisms of yours.

Except for those who successfully completed grammar school. Oh btw, if
you're referring to Major Bowes or Dish Night, let me direct you to

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Bowes_Amateur_Hour

http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dish%20night

... though the definition above does not mention that talent shows were
frequently a feature of &quot;dish night.&quot; I'm guessing you missed the many
mentions of talent shows, including those of Ted Mack and Major Bowes et
al., in this forum last year. They all must have been during one of your
periodic snit fits.

I disagree with your disagreement.  ;-D

IMO &quot;X Factor&quot; has a much better formula and format and broader appeal
than &quot;Idol.&quot;  I *love* that show!

But as they say, &quot;vive la différence!&quot;

I find it interesting -- and am glad - that the four biggie &quot;Idol&quot;
type shows -- American Idol, X Factor, Canadian Idol and Australian
Idol are all broadcast in different seasons.  When CI ends in a couple
of weeks, Austalian Idol starts up in the early fall, then X Factor in
the winter, and American Idol in the Spring.  I don't believe this is
a coincidence, since it's only in the U.S. where we cannot get broad
international programming on our TV's.
