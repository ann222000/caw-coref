This morning I went out for a run. I'd been listening to the news. Everything in the world was pretty hunkydory, what with Blair trying to make poverty history in Africa at the G8 meeting, and London having won host city for the Olympics over Paris and that fat Frog Chirac with his comments about British food.
When I got back from my run, the London subway system had been attacked, and a doubledecker bus blown up -- a terrorist response to the G8 meeting.
Fuck me with an Improvised Explosive Device up the ass. You turn your back and shit happens.
At least 33 dead I just read. I don't believe in the death penalty, but maybe there should be an exception for terrorists. I hate people who do extreme things for some cockamanie ideal.
Next time there's more than one world leader in NYC, I ain't taking the subway in the morning rushhour. First Madrid, then London -- what other big cities have subway systems? Paris and New York. It's going to happen here, let's face it, and when it does, it'll be in the subway. Try walking to work every now and then, so you're used to it when next something big enough is going on in NYC or Paris for terrorists to want to mark the occasion with their boom boom shit.
(And while we're at it, these hackers who send viruses out on networks, and these goddam spammers, aren't they terrorists after a fashion, too? Computerrorists, to coin a phrase. Treat them as such. I know, they don't kill people, but like terrorists, all they do is create havoc. Ten year minimum sentence, I say.)
Fuck, I've got friends in London. Emails flying all over.
But I wish people would stop saying we'll win the war on terror, like Bush said yet again. You can't win the war on terror. You can catch terrorists, yes, but I wouldn't dignify the scumbuckets by saying we're at war with them. It's because we think we're at war with them that we do stupid things like start a war with Iraq and create more terrorists. You're not at war with people when you're the main recruitment agency for them.
