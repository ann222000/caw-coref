All,
I am from the Studebaker Newsgroup, but my son has a 67 cougar with a bad
steering box.  The local Cougar club was of no help.  He is in dire need of
some help and am hoping someone has the parts or knows where to get them.

Gary and Denise,

I am a fellow SDC member and may happen to have some parts to help out
with the Cougar.

I don't know about the steering box, but many parts from mustangs will
interchange.  Check with a salvage yard that may have a cross reference
book.  Good luck I wish I hadn't sold my two 67 xr7's.
