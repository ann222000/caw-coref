Progressive Muscle Relaxation

Progressive muscle relaxation is one example of a deep relaxation
technique that can be used to reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety,
insomnia, and certain types of chronic pain. Based upon the simple
premise of tensing, or tightening, one muscle group at a time followed
by a release of the tension, this form of relaxation is used by
physicians (in combination with standard therapies) for a number of
conditions, including headaches, cancer pain, high blood pressure, and
digestive disturbances. This form of muscle relaxation is progressive
in two senses.
Firstly, the muscle groups are tightened and relaxed one at a time in
a specific order, generally commencing with the lower extremities and
ending with the face, abdomen, and chest, although other sequences
have been used by some practitioners. Secondly, a greater degree of
muscle tension is attempted in subsequent exercises as compared with
beginning efforts as one gains experience with the technique.
The technique of progressive muscle relaxation was described by Edmund
Jacobson in the 1930s based upon his premise that mental relaxation
should naturally result from physical relaxation. Like the Relaxation
Response pioneered by Herbert Benson in the 1970s, progressive muscle
relaxation can be learned by nearly anyone and requires only 10-20
minutes per day. You may practice this technique seated or lying down
in a completely quiet place free from all distractions. The individual
muscle groups are tightened for 5-8 seconds and the tension is then
released. While releasing the tension, try to focus on the changes you
feel when the muscle group is relaxed. Imagery may be helpful in
conjunction with the release of tension; you can try to imagine
stressful feelings flowing out of your body as you relax each muscle
group. You should stay relaxed for 15-30 seconds and move on to the
next muscle group.
In addition to its stress-reduction and health benefits, progressive
muscle relaxation is an excellent tool to help learn about the body
and its signals. With practice and time, you can learn to accurately
identify tension signals in your body and actively work to reduce
stress and tension and their accompanying physical reactions.

How to Create a Serene Sacred Space

"Sacred Space" is a special place you can retreat to and spend time
alone in quiet meditation or retrospection. Here are a few helpful
ideas for creating an indoor sanctuary.
Difficulty Level: average
Time Required: 25 to 45 minutes

Here's How:
Choose an area within the interior of your home for your "Sacred
Space" (a spare bedroom, a revamped pantry area, a corner space, etc.)
Clear this space of stagnant energies by performing a ritual smudging
(cleanse with smoke from burning sage wand). This should also be
repeated periodically after you begin using your sacred space
Consider your personal comforts and each of your senses in choosing
the suggested furniture and articles to fill this space.
Comfort: floor cushions, a gentle swaying rocker, or perhaps a stuffed
chaise to stretch out in.
Sounds: wind chimes, water fountains, CDs & player, a hand-carved
wooden flute.
Taste: peppermints for mental clarity, calming herbal tea blends,
cinnamon red hot candies to awaken the taste buds.
Smells: scented candles, incense, freshly cut sprig of lavender.
Visual: mirrors, posters, paintings, artwork, altar.
Touch: objects with a variety of textures such as crystals, feathers,
sea shells, woven cloths, teddy bears, etc.
A window placement within the space is especially welcome to allow
fresh air and sunshine for healing and happiness.

Tips:
Once your space is ready, honor it by making your presence there
often.
Set boundaries by deciding who else, if anyone, is allowed in your
Sacred Space.
Keep a supply of colored pens and notebooks if you want to maintain a
journal in your Sacred Space.

How to Relax and Ground Your Body

Grounding exercises help tremendously with maintaining a balance of
our physical and spiritual bodies. This particular exercise can serve
as an excellent tool for identifying physical stresses and upsets.

Difficulty Level: average
Time Required: 25-60 minutes

Here's How:
Lay down comfortably on a bed or massage table.
Bring your thoughts from its busy mental chatter downward by focusing
on your feet.
Notice the soles of your feet, your toes, in-between your toes, the
top of your feet. Do they feel hot? or cold? Do they hurt? Are they
numb? Do you feel your blood circulating through them? Are they
feeling tired?
Once you have a made a strong connection with your feet, you may then
move your focus upwards to your ankles.
Notice, but don't judge how the different parts feel. For example,
when you wiggled your toes, how did that feel?
Gradually shift your focus now to your lower legs, onto your knee
caps, behind your knees, your thighs and upward.
Keep reminding yourself not to rush.
Allow yourself to breathe throughout the exercise, especially as you
come to any areas of discomfort (stressed muscles, soreness, etc.) or
at any spot that feels like there may be an energy block.
Once you have moved through your torso and up to your neck drop back
to your fingertips.
Move to the hands, up your arms and shoulders, returning now to your
neck.
Finish up with your face and scalp.

Tips:
Don't rush this process. Take your time moving upwards to each part of
your body.
Do not touch yourself. Just allow your mind to switch focus from
wherever it is and mentally consider your body's sensations.
Do this exercise while laying down is recommended, but for anyone who
tends to fall asleep quickly upon hitting the pillow sitting upright
in a chair may be preferable.

Basic Guided Relaxation:
Advanced Technique
Article by L. John Mason, Ph.D.

This guided relaxation exercise is taken from exercises from Dr.
Mason's best selling book, Guide to Stress Reduction. A version of
this technique is found on most of the guided relaxation tapes/CD's
found at the Stress Education Center's Tapes/CD's page. Please find
the one that is best for your specific requirements. Look in the
health series, if you have symptoms of stress.

For the best results, have someone read this guided relaxation slowly
to you, with appropriate pauses. You can also read this exercise into
a tape recorder and then play it back to yourself when you want to
relax. Remember, this exercise will work best for you with regular
daily use and repetition over time. (4-6 weeks to see positive change
and 8-12 weeks of regular use for the maximum benefits to begin.) Good
health and enjoy your relaxation!

Start of relaxation. Begin here.

When you are ready to begin, start by getting yourself into a
comfortable position in a space where you will not be unnecessarily
disturbed, for about twenty minutes.
As you sit back or lie back more comfortably, check to see if your
arms and legs are in a relaxed uncrossed position. Let your shoulders
release tension and let your neck begin to relax by letting your head
just sink back comfortably into the pillow or chair.
Check the muscles of your head and face, especially the muscles around
your eyes, even your eye brows, and the muscles around your mouth,
including your jaw and even your tongue.
Before we begin, let me remind you that I do not want you to try to
relax too quickly. In fact, I do not want you to try to relax at all!
Because without any effort you will be able drift as deeply into
relaxation as you wish to go, by just letting go of stress, thoughts,
and physical tensions.
To begin, start by taking three deep slow diaphragmatic
breaths...pausing after you inhale, and then exhaling fully and
completely. You might even imagine that as you exhale you can begin to
release thoughts, tensions, even discomforts with the warm breath that
you breathe out and away. (pause)
After these first three slow breaths, then continue to breathe slowly,
but naturally. Perhaps you can feel yourself taking another step
deeper into relaxation and comfort with every exhalation. As you
breathe slowly and naturally, please turn your attention to the
relaxation that may be beginning in your arms and down into your
hands. If you look very carefully, you might feel a slight difference,
where one of your arms might be just a bit more relaxed than the
other. It might be just a subtle difference, but one arm might feel
slightly heavier, as if the muscles in that arm were more loose or
more flexible. Or perhaps, one arms feels slightly warmer, as if,
blood and energy could flow more freely and easily all the way down
that arm... as if it were flowing down, through wide open blood
vessels, and slowly, but freely, pulsing down into the hand and
fingers. (pause)
Or perhaps, both of your arms are equally relaxed, and that would be
perfect as well. The only thing that matters is that you continue to
breathe slowly and naturally, and perhaps you can begin to feel
yourself drifting deeper into a dreamlike state where you can feel
greater calmness and comfort, and where you begin to develop even
greater awareness and control.
As you continue to breathe slowly and gently, perhaps you can begin to
become aware of the relaxation that may be starting down into your
legs and feet. If you were to look very carefully, you might become
aware of a slight difference, where one of your legs might be a bit
more relaxed than the other. You might also find that one leg feels
slightly heavier, as if the muscles in that leg were more loose or
flexible. Or perhaps, you may find that one leg feels slightly warmer,
where the blood and energy can flow more freely and easily, all the
way down that leg, through wide open blood vessels, and you may feel
it slowly but freely pulsing down into your foot and toes. (pause)
Or perhaps, your legs feel equally relaxed, and that would be perfect
also. The only thing that matters is that you continue to breathe
slowly and gently, and allow yourself to drift deeper into this
dreamlike state of calmness, comfort, and control.
Perhaps you can feel the control growing stronger as you feel yourself
just beginning to sink back into what ever you are sitting or lying
upon, as the tensions just begin to melt away.
Even the muscle of your back can begin to relax even better. You may
feel the muscles of your back begin to soften or loosen as you slowly
breathe away any unwanted tensions. The relaxation can begin to spread
to the other muscles of your back, even spreading up into your upper
back and your shoulders. Perhaps your shoulders can drop down into a
more comfortable position. And you may feel the control growing
stronger as you can begin to feel your head just sinking back,
completely supported by the pillow or the chair, as your neck begins
to relax even better. Even the muscles of your head and face can relax
even better.
Perhaps you can imagine yourself as if you were outdoors on a warm and
pleasant day. You imagine that you are standing near a pond of water,
where the water is calm and clear, and the surface is smooth. You may
even be able to feel the warmth of the sunlight or of the warm
breezes... Perhaps you can imagine, that if you were to drop a rock or
a stone into the water, you could watch as the waves or the ripples
spread across the surface of the pond in every direction. And perhaps
you can imagine that you can send soothing and cleansing waves of
relaxation down from the top of your head, in every direction, to
soothe, heal, and cleanse every muscle and cell of your body. You
might imagine that these waves can begin to drift down to relax the
muscle at the top and sides of your head... Or you might feel the
waves drifting down to relax your forehead even better... letting it
go calm and smooth.
The soothing waves of relaxation can wash down to relax the muscle
around your mouth, even your jaw can loosen a bit better. The waves of
relaxation can slowly spread down to soothe and relax the muscles of
your neck and shoulders... and you may begin to feel them drifting
down through your arms... slowly drifting all the way down... perhaps
you can even feel the waves slowly pulsing down into your hands and
fingers. (pause)
Or you can feel the waves slowly drifting down through your back and
your chest... You may even feel that your breathing is more calm and
regular... Or you may feel that your heartbeat is more calm and
regular... As you breathe slowly and freely, you may even be able to
feel your stomach and abdomen beginning to let go and to relax more
freely. Your lower back and pelvic area can begin to relax even
better... The waves of relaxation can begin to spread down your
legs... slowly drifting all the way down and out through the bottom of
your feet, or perhaps you can feel the waves of relaxation slowly
pulsing down into your feet and toes...
Now, just as if you were watching this pond of water, it can once
again become calm and still. The water can begin to settle, to become
calm and clear. Even the surface can once again become calm and
smooth. You may wish to turn away from the pond and to follow a
pathway that takes you to a perfect place... a place where you can be
by yourself, and feel calm and comfortable.
Once you arrive there, you can look around to find the most
comfortable place to lay down. As you drift over to that spot, you
just sink back into whatever you would be sitting or lying upon. As
you settle back, perhaps you can even feel the warmth of the sunlight
gently shining down on you. You can begin to soak up the warmth as the
tensions just melt away. You may even be able to hear the sounds that
may surround you. Like the sounds of running water, or the sounds of
birds, or of the warm breezes. Perhaps you can even imagine that you
can smell the fragrance of salt air, flowers, grass, or of the woods
that may surround you.
Imagine that you can begin to soak up the warmth from the sun. Perhaps
you can even imagine that you can begin to breathe in the sunlight and
warmth. As you fill with this warming, healing light and energy,
remember that as you relax, there will be an increase of blood flowing
more freely and easily to every cell of your body. Every cell will be
bathed in an increased supply of oxygen and nutrients. Every cell will
be able to soak up the perfect amounts of these nutrients to help to
heal and recharge each and every cell. As the cells begin to fill
health and happiness, you can continue to drift in this peaceful state
of calmness and relaxation... Though you remain calm and comfortable,
perhaps you begin to see yourself healing fully and completely... You
may even be able to see yourself in perfect health, smiling and
celebrating in the sunshine on this warm and beautiful day. You may be
able to see yourself being active, as if you were smiling, or playing,
celebrating, or dancing...
Remember that every time you practice this exercise you will be able
to get better at it. You will be able to relax more deeply and more
completely. You will be able to let go more quickly. And the effects
of the calmness and comfort will last longer, carrying over throughout
your day, enabling you to be more calm and efficient with your
available time and energy.
If you are using this exercise at bedtime, or if you wish to drift off
to sleep now, then you can begin to do so. If you wish to drift off to
sleep now, then continue to breathe slowly and gently, focus on the
relaxation in your arms and your legs... and drift off into a deep and
restful state of sleep where you will be able to rest fully and
completely. When you awaken you will be fully rested and alert. So if
you wish to drift off into sleep then you can do so.
If you wish to awaken now, then you can begin to do so.
If you wish to awaken now, then you can begin to see yourself
returning to this room, bringing the feelings of calmness and comfort
back with you to a more fully waking state. If you wish to awaken now,
then you may wish to feel the bed or the chair beneath and slowly
awaken, letting the feelings of calmness, comfort, health and joy
return with you to a fully waking state.
If you wish to awaken now, you may wish to take a deep breath, letting
the calmness, comfort, and relaxation return with you to a fully
waking state. And you may wish to take another deep breath and
stretch, becoming wide awake, feeling refreshed and alert.

This mental "journey inside the body" can be used at the end of a PMR
course (progressive muscle relaxation) or as a "stand-alone"
relaxation exercise. It takes about 4 minutes. The notes underneath
the instructions originally were meant as a lead for myself (or any
trainer) when reading the instructions to a group.

The exercise is done sitting upright on a chair with both feet flat on
the ground. To get some support sitting upright you might push your
bottom into the back of the chair.

At the end of the exercise the eyes are kept closed for a short while.
You breathe in deeply and move the fingers and toes playfully. You
breathe in deeply again and stretch yourself. After breathing in
deeply a third time the eyes are opened. This breathing and stretching
serves to reactivate the circulation.

There is no order to actively relax the parts of the body which you
are focussing on. Just perceiving passively does the trick! Simply let
the relaxation response happen as it comes!

Exercise: a journey on the inside

Resting (30 sec.)

Sit down relaxed keeping an upright position. Close your eyes and
enjoy the rest.
(15 sec.)

Accept any perceptions such as noises from the outside as well as
thoughts which appear spontaneously, but let them pass by again. Don't
ponder on them. Try not to start daydreaming.
(5 sec.)

When anything important comes to your mind simply make a mental note
of it so you can come back to it later. Then let the thought pass by
like any other thoughts, ideas, or perceptions..
(10 sec.)

Perceiving the hands (40 sec.)

Now lead your attention into the right arm and eventually into the
right hand. Your attention is completely devoted to your right hand:
how does it feel -
warm or cold?
dry or damp?
heavy or light?
How does it lie there, where do you perceive pressure?
(15 sec.)

Next lead your attention into the left arm, mentally travelling down
to the left hand. How does your left hand feel?
warm or cold?
dry or damp?
heavy or light?
How does it lie there, where do you perceive pressure?
(15 sec.)

Possibly you can feel your pulse in the fingertips.Check how your left
hand feels compared to the right.
(10 sec.)

Perceiving the feet (40 sec.)

Now lead your attention into the right leg and eventually into the
right foot. Your attention is completely devoted to your right foot:
how does it feel -
warm or cold?
dry or damp?
How does it touch the ground?
Are the toes stretched out or crooked?
(15 sec.)

Next lead your attention into the left leg and eventually into the
left foot. Does it feel -
warm or cold?
dry or damp?
How does it touch the ground?
Are the toes stretched out or crooked?
(15 sec.)

Compare how both feet feel.
(10 sec.)

Perceiving the face (20 sec.)

Devote your attention to your face:
Are the eyes closed lightly or do you feel a pressure?
How does the jaw feel - relaxed or tense?
Do the lips touch gently or do you press them together?
(25 sec.)

Complete inside journey (60 Sec.)

Now conduct a mental journey through your body.
Start visiting your hands again,
then lead your attention to the face,
next to your neck and shoulders,
to your abdomen and back,
eventually reaching the feet again.
(60 sec.)

Conclusion (50 sec.)
Now terminate your exercise still keeping the eyes closed.
(20 sec.)
Breathe in deeply and move the fingers and toes gently
(10 sec.)
Breathe in deeply again and stretch yourself.
(10 sec.)
Breathe in deeply a third time and open your eyes.

Basic Instructions

Relaxation is the opposite of tension. The following exercise can be a
tool for you to use to control tension and enhance relaxation in both
your body and your mind. It will probably be most useful to you if you
or a friend would tape record the following exercise and listen to it
rather than to just try to read and remember the various parts of the
exercise. Read the exercise slowly with pauses to allow the relaxation
to occur. If you do make a tape for yourself, please remember to use
it only when you are sitting or lying comfortably at home or where you
are not needing to be involved in an activity requiring you to be
fully alert. Do not use the tape while operating any kind of
machinery, including cars. One of the main activities suggested in
this exercise involves alternatively tensing and relaxing muscle
groups. Put enough tension into the muscles to make them tense, but
not enough to cause pain. Feeling pain means that you are tensing too
much.

Tension Reducing Exercise
Settle back and get as comfortable as you possibly can. Close your
eyes gently. Tune in to your breathing. (Pause) Notice it's pace and
rhythm. (Pause) take another breath, a little deeper this time,
letting yourself feel completely calm, peaceful, comfortable and
relaxed. (Pause) Now , with the rest of your body feeling more and
more comfortable and relaxed, slowly clench your right fist. Clench it
tighter and tighter and study the tension. Keep it clenched and feel
the tension in your fist, hand, and forearm. (Short Pause) Now let
your hand relax and go limp, allowing your fingers to become loose.
Notice the contrast between the feeling of tension and now the feeling
of relaxation. (Short Pause) Let your whole body go and relax even
more completely. (Short Pause) Now bend both of your elbows and tense
your biceps. Tense them hard until they almost quiver. Hold them tight
and study the tension. (Short Pause) Now let your arms straighten out
and drop gently to your sides. go limp, feeling heavy and relaxed.
Notice the tension leave your muscles and experience relaxation that
replaces the tension. Let the feeling flow and spread into the rest of
your body so that you feel peaceful and calm. Feel yourself becoming
more and more relaxed. (Pause) (From this point onward, pause where it
seems appropriate to allow enough time for the tensing and relaxing to
occur.)
Focus all your attention on your neck, your shoulders, and your upper
back. As you breathe, imagine that you are releasing tension from your
neck, shoulders, and upper back. With each breath you take, feel your
neck, shoulders, and upper back grow heavier and more and more
relaxed. As you release tension in your arms, neck, shoulders, and
upper back, feel the wave of relaxation moving downwards through your
torso, lower back and stomach. With each breath, you become more and
more relaxed.
Now tighten and flex the muscles in your buttocks and thighs. You can
flex your thighs by pressing down on your heels with your toes in the
air. Hold the tension. Keep the muscles tight and tense. now let go.
Relax and notice the difference as you let your hips and thighs relax
and allow that feeling to proceed on its own until you feel completely
and deeply relaxed.
Now press your toes straight out away from your body as if you were on
tiptoes. Feel the muscles in your calves become taught and tense. Hold
the tension. Study the tension and now relax. Feel the difference
between the tension and the delightful, calm, peaceful feeling of
being deeply relaxed. Feel the heaviness of your entire lower body as
you relax further still.
If you wish, you can become even more deeply relaxed by merely taking
a deep breath and slowly exhaling. As you breath deeply, feel your
entire body become heavy, comfortable and relaxed. Think the following
thoughts to yourself: "I feel quiet. I am feeling deeply relaxed. My
body feels calm and quiet. My neck, my jaws, my forehead are all calm
and smooth. My whole body is heavy, comfortable, relaxed, and quiet.
My arms and hands are heavy and warm. I am at peace." (At this point,
give yourself a few more minutes of deep relaxation before moving on
toward ending the relaxation session.)
(Ending the experience) Take a deep breath, wiggle your toes and open
your eyes. when you do so you will feel refreshed and calm.

Enhancing the Experience
You can practice deepening this feeling of relaxation by taking deep
breaths and releasing tension with each exhalation and imagining a
wave of relaxation moving from the top of your head to the ends of
your toes. As you become aware, through this exercise, of different
muscle groups and how deliberately you can control the experience of
tension and relaxation in your muscles, you increase your capacity to
relax. In similar fashion, each time you practice this relaxation
exercise you will find it more familiar and easier to use.
