I listened in for about 25 minutes waiting my turn to
ask a question.  But I found this to be disturbing and
had trouble sleeping last night.

I waited patiently for my turn.  There was the Vietnam
War veteran who was vehemently opposed to Davis'
support of the war as it is.  As we all learned from
Vietnam victory was denied by the politicians.  So if
he would just let us bomb Syria and Iran we would be
on our way to victory.

There was the woman who noted that once Jesus rules in
the middle east all will be well.

There was a young man who expressed his support of the
war in Iraq because we have no choice but he inquired
as to why impeachment was not being sought for the
lies that started the war.  Davis' response was
interesting in that he did not outright dismiss
impeachment but he said nothing notable has been an
impeachable offense so far.  However, Davis alluded
that may change.

There was the Iraq war mom mourning over the loss of
her son and how great Tom Davis is because he came to
visit her and had the Vienna Fire hall named after her
son.

After about 25 minutes I needed to get back to work.
I wonder if this is a regular practice and he just
does this without warning.  I think I will call and
inquire.

Sounds like waiting to talk on C-SPAN's Washington Journal.  Is it any wonder the guy won't support impeachment or ending the war with callers like that?
