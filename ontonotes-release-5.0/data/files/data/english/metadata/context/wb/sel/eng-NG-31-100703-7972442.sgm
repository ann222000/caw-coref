Looks Ok - I dare say you could get an equivalent or better spec Acer or
Toshiba from the likes of Dabs or laptopsdirect - alternatively Dell do make
good machines.

Not a bad deal but to be a fair comparison you need to add in the cost of a
webcam, card-reader, USB mouse and a carry case and bring the warranty back up
to three years as offered by the Medion (the Dell warranty alone takes it up to
£502). Also, if you want all the multi-media stuff then you might have to factor
in a change of O/S (though you can get the Dell with WinXP Pro installed which
would cover most things).

Bottom line, the Medion is not a bad deal...just not an outstandingly good one
:-) It all depends on what you want in the initial off-the-shelf bundle.

Cheers

Kevin

Quite. The Vista Business does not include the home entertainment features. So
You would have to specify Business ultimate or Home premium at extra cost.
Ending up about the same as for the MEDION MD 96290 laptop.

True. But with a laptop in particular, there are other factors than just the
paper spec. Build quality, screen quality, keyboard quality, battery life...

As a rule, I'd agree with you.  The only thing in this Medions favour though
is the 3 years warranty - Sony laptops aren't all that these days IME...

They vary a lot in build quality.
Some of the ones we've bought have been very solid but the most recent one
flexes very badly.
By contrast , all the Dell machines have been very solidly made
