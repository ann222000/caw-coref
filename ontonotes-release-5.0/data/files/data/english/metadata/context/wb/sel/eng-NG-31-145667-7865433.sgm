So what have I been doing you may wonder?Painting large pieces and
doing a commission andpreparing new work for a restaurant where I
showand so on and so on. BUT today I went out toa marvelous place that
I have gone to for years.It is an unspoiled acreage where the owners
grow all sorts of things you can pick yourself, and thenthere are the
flowers. I went there today and therewas no one around. It was the
perfect warm summer's day and I had rows and rows of flowersall to
myself. Bees buzzed and goldfinches raided the seeds of dozens of
sunflowers. I am going to posta bunch for you to feast your eyes on. I
took 87photos!
