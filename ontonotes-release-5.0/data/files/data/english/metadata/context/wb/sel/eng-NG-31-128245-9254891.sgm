+++JORDAN TIMES 23 Oct. '07:&quot;Arab states in Gulf need to prepare for
different crisis scenareos-Kuwait&quot;
QUOTE:&quot; 'consecutive crises have convinced your peoples that those around
them are not necessarily their friends'&quot;
KUWAIT CITY (AP) - The six Arab states in the Gulf need to coordinate on how
to deal with looming crisis scenarios so they are not caught unprepared,
Kuwait's top national security official said Monday.
.  .  .They fear the consequences of a military confrontation between Tehran
and the United States, as well as the effects of any nuclear accidents in
Iran. Tehran insists its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes,
though the US accuses Iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, an Iranian top military officer said his country was capable of
firing 11,000 rockets into enemy bases within a minute of any attack on
it...., the missile commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corp., did not
identify the enemy, but the US has troops in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar and
Bahrain.
... Saudi Arabia's intelligence chief... said the members of the loose
economic and political alliance have to make serious moves to &quot;defend
against and cushion any dangers&quot; that could reach them from the worsening
situation in Iraq.
Iraq is torn with sectarian Shiite-Sunni violence, and Turkey, its neighbour
to the north, is threatening that if diplomacy fails, it will send troops
into the country to fight Kurdish rebels attacking it from there.
&quot;Consecutive crises have convinced your peoples that those around them are
not necessarily their friends,&quot; and they want a strong shield to protect
them, Abdul Rahman Attiyah, the secretary-general of the GCC told the
meeting before it was closed to the press.
