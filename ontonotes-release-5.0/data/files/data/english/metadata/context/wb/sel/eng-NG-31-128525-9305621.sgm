Daily Bible Reading

Evelyn Underhill

If God were small enough to be understood, He would not be big enough to be worshiped.

-Evelyn Underhill

Psalm 26

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prayer for Help and Thanksgiving for It&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Of David.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

To you, O LORD, I call;
my rock, do not refuse to hear me,
for if you are silent to me,
I shall be like those who go down to the Pit.
Hear the voice of my supplication,
as I cry to you for help,
as I lift up my hands
toward your most holy sanctuary.

&lt;video&gt;&lt;/video&gt; Do not drag me away with the wicked,
with those who are workers of evil,
who speak peace with their neighbors,
while mischief is in their hearts.
Repay them according to their work,
and according to the evil of their deeds;
repay them according to the work of their hands;
render them their due reward.
Because they do not regard the works of the LORD,
or the work of his hands,
he will break them down and build them up no more.

Blessed be the LORD,
for he has heard the sound of my pleadings.
The LORD is my strength and my shield;
in him my heart trusts;
so I am helped, and my heart exults,
and with my song I give thanks to him.

The LORD is the strength of his people;
he is the saving refuge of his anointed.
O save your people, and bless your heritage;
be their shepherd, and carry them forever.
