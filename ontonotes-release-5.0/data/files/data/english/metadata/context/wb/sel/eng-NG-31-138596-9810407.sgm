'We used to think there was a black community'

With her towering afro and radical rhetoric, Angela Davis was one of
the iconic faces of black politics in 1970s America. She talks to Gary
Younge about Barack Obama, the racism of the black middle class, and
how it feels to be remembered as a hairdo

Angela Davis was intrigued to see recently that a significant number
of young black women to whom she was delivering a talk were wearing
images of her from the 70s on their T-shirts. She asked what the image
meant to them. &quot;They said it made them feel powerful and connected to
other movements,&quot; she says. &quot;It was really quite moving. It really had
nothing to do with me. They were using this image as an expression of
who they would like to be and what they would like to do. I've given
up trying to challenge commodification in that respect. It's an
unending battle and you never win any victories.&quot;
For all her many achievements over the past 37 years, Angela Davis
remains, for many, a symbol frozen in time. The time was 1970. It
marked the end of a tumultuous era of civil rights struggle that
culminated in the assassination of two of black America's most
renowned leaders - Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. A period of
peaceful demonstrations for integration in the rural south had been
followed by a spate of violent disturbances in the urban north. The
focus had shifted from integration to black power; the influences from
Gandhi and the Bible to Mao and Marxism. In 1967, Aretha Franklin
called for &quot;r-e-s-p-e-c-t&quot;; by 1970, the anthem was Edwin Starr's War.

The symbol was resistance. Smart, handsome, eloquent, fearless and
stylish, Davis strode the political stage with her fist raised high
and her afro combed even higher. A rebel and a revolutionary. A
silhouette for summerwear. Radical and chic like Che - except that she
has lived to see her political resistance transfer into popular
culture.

A student in her history of Afro-American women's studies class at San
Francisco State University during the 80s recalls: &quot;She wanted to
teach and she was a very conscientious teacher, really engaging. But
she would make some cogent point about history and then someone would
literally put up their hand and make some comment about her hair. I
thought, 'They're not letting her be who she wants to be.'&quot;

Davis once said: &quot;It is both humiliating and humbling to discover that
a single generation after the events that constructed me as a public
personality, I am remembered as a hairdo.&quot;

A few weeks ago, at the Women of Colour Resource Centre in Oakland,
California, Davis presented the Sister of Fire award to a young poet
from Queens in New York who could barely contain her excitement at
being in her presence. &quot;I can't believe I'm on the same stage as
Angela Davis,&quot; she gushed. &quot;I read about her in school ... And she's
still alive.&quot; Davis and her contemporaries at the ceremony laughed.

&quot;I have reconciled myself to the existence of this historical figure
and its relationship to the work that I'm trying to do today,&quot; she
says. This is less difficult than it might seem since her present work
is intricately connected to both the work she has been doing most of
her adult life and the incident that made her famous: prisons.

Back in the 60s, as the American state moved to criminalise radical
black protest, she primarily campaigned on the issue of political
prisoners such as the Black Panther George Jackson. Her political
activities had already made her a target for the conservative
establishment. In 1969, she was fired from her job as assistant
professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, for being a
member of the Communist party, only to see that decision overturned by
a supreme court judge.

Then, on August 7 1970, her own infamous run-in with the criminal
justice system started. On that day, Jonathan Jackson, 17, held the
Marin county courthouse at gunpoint and sprung three prisoners - James
McClain, William Christmas and Ruchell Magee - who were either
witnesses or on trial. The men led the judge, Harold Haley, the
prosecuting attorney and some jurors to a waiting van and fled. In the
ensuing chase, Jackson, Christmas, McClain and Haley were shot dead,
while the attorney was paralysed by a police bullet.

Jonathan was the younger brother of George Jackson, whom Davis had
fallen in love with during the campaign for his release. Jonathan's
gun was registered in Davis's name. Davis was nowhere near the shoot-
out, but a warrant was issued for her arrest, for conspiracy to
kidnapping and murder. She went on the run.

Davis's disappearance sparked an intensive, public search and
propelled her to the FBI's top 10 most wanted, and to international
attention. Two months later, she was arrested in a motel in mid-town
Manhattan. President Richard Nixon branded her a &quot;terrorist&quot;. Facing
the trinity of rightwing hate figures - Nixon, the then California
governor Ronald Reagan and FBI director J Edgar Hoover - Davis became
an international cause celebre. A global campaign called for her
release. Aretha Franklin offered to post quarter of a million dollars
in bail. &quot;I have the money,&quot; she said. &quot;I got it from black people and
I want to use it in ways that will help our people.&quot;

In January 1971, Davis appeared in Marin county court, unapologetic
and defiant, facing charges that could have lead to her execution. A
year and a half later, an all-white jury acquitted her. As an academic
of great renown, she went on to enter the canons of black and feminist
theory with her books - on women, on race and class and women, on
culture and politics. She wrote a bestselling autobiography and stood
for vice-president in 1980 and 1984 on the Communist party ticket.

Much has changed in her life since the days of her trial but a great
deal has remained the same. Davis still teaches at the University of
California - although now at Santa Cruz, where she is professor of
history of consciousness and feminist studies. At 63, she is still
recognisable from those iconic 70s shots, although her hair is now a
cascade of corkscrew curls. And her primary focus remains the criminal
justice system. According to the US justice department, on current
trends, one in three black boys born in 2001 will end up in jail.

&quot;The prison system bears the imprint of slavery perhaps more than any
other institution,&quot; she says. &quot;It produces a state that is very
similar to slavery; the deprivation of rights, civil death and
disenfranchisement. Under slavery, black people became that against
which the notion of freedom was defined. White people knew they were
free because they could point to the people who weren't free. Now we
know we're free because we're not in prison. People continue to suffer
civil death even after they leave prison. There is permanent
disenfranchisement.&quot;

The US, argues Davis, is still struggling with its refusal to address
slavery's legacy. &quot;There was the negative abolition of slavery - the
breaking of chains - but freedom is much more than just the abolition
of slavery. What would it have meant to provide economic security to
everyone who had been enslaved; to have brought about the
participation in governance and politics and access to education? That
didn't happen. We are still confronted by the failure of the
affirmative side of abolition all these years later.&quot;

Does that not leave black politics entrenched in a paradigm set almost
150 years ago? &quot;The problem is that we [as a country] haven't moved
on,&quot; she says. &quot;Certainly it's important to recognise the victories
that have been won. Racism is not exactly the same now as it was then.
But there were issues that were never addressed and now present
themselves in different manifestations today. You only move on if you
resolve these issues. It took 100 years to get the right to vote.&quot;

Born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1944, Davis was raised in the
tightknit world of the black middle class in a small southern town. It
included the families of secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and Alma
Johnson, who would later marry former secretary of state Colin Powell.

Davis was seven years younger than Johnson and 10 years older than
Rice. Their worlds intertwined but never quite collided. Rice's
father, John Wesley Rice Jr, worked for Johnson's uncle as a high-
school guidance counsellor. Johnson knew Rice as a child; Davis knew
Johnson, because they attended the same church. Birmingham became
notorious during the 60s as the town that set dogs and hoses on
African-Americans seeking the vote, and for the bombing of the 16th
Street Baptist church, in which four little girls were killed in 1963,
one of whom was Rice's friend. Its reputation was so bad that Colin
Powell's parents considered not going to their son's wedding and joked
about the likelihood that they would be lynched when they got there.

Although all three emerged from that time and place to take advantage
of the new opportunities available, Davis's perspective on her
achievements could not be more different to Rice's. &quot;In America, with
education and hard work it really does not matter where you come
from,&quot; Rice told the Republican convention in 2000. &quot;It matters only
where you are going.&quot; She later told the Washington Post: &quot;My parents
were very strategic. I was going to be so well prepared, and I was
going to do all of these things that were revered in white society so
well, that I would be armoured somehow from racism. I would be able to
confront white society on its own terms.&quot;

Davis insists this is disingenuous. &quot;It was never about individuals. I
never grew up thinking that the measure of my success was as an
individual. There was always a sense that the measure of your success
was to a large part one that was linked to community advancement. Most
people weren't going to make it as far as she or I did. She never
would have had the opportunities she had without the benefit of the
struggles that took place in the 60s. If you can, with conscience,
talk about a post-civil rights era, we have to talk about the
limitations of civil rights. It produced individual successes but it
never produced group successes.&quot;

The advancement of the likes of Powell and Rice within the Bush
administration, argues Davis, exemplifies a flawed understanding of
what it means to tackle modern-day racism. &quot;The Republican
administration is the most diverse in history. But when the inclusion
of black people into the machine of oppression is designed to make
that machine work more efficiently, then it does not represent
progress at all. We have more black people in more visible and
powerful positions. But then we have far more black people who have
been pushed down to the bottom of the ladder. When people call for
diversity and link it to justice and equality, that's fine. But
there's a model of diversity as the difference that makes no
difference, the change that brings about no change.&quot;

This, she says, is how the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama is
generally understood. &quot;He is being consumed as the embodiment of
colour blindness. It's the notion that we have moved beyond racism by
not taking race into account. That's what makes him conceivable as a
presidential candidate. He's become the model of diversity in this
period, and what's interesting about his campaign is that it has not
sought to invoke engagements with race other than those that have
already existed.&quot;

Davis's initial response to Obama is one she often gives to questions
both specific and general: &quot;It's complicated,&quot; she says. Her answers
are candid but measured. Not measured necessarily to fit prevailing
public opinion - she believes prisons should be abolished, for example
- but for their consistency and precision. She talks slowly and in
long whole sentences and will often deconstruct the question before
replying. Asked about the class stratification in the black community
and its implications for black political leadership, she says, &quot;It's
complicated. We used to think there was a black community. It was
always heterogenous but we were always able to imagine ourselves as
part of that community. I would go so far as to say that many middle-
class black people have internalised the same racist attitudes to
working-class black people as white people have of the black criminal.
The young black man with the sagging pants walking down the street is
understood as a threat by the black middle class as well. So I don't
think it's possible to mobilise black communities in the way it was in
the past.

&quot;I don't even know that I would even look for black leadership now. We
looked to work with that category because it gave us a sense of hope.
But that category assumes a link between race and progressive politics
and, as Stuart Hall says, 'There aren't any guarantees.' What's more
important than the racial identification of the person is how that
person thinks about race.&quot;

The confluence of black and progressive politics in the US has been
further diminished, argues Davis, as a result of 9/11, which gave all
Americans the option of retreating behind the flag or responding to a
world that was reaching out. &quot;In that sense, 9/11 was a pivotal
moment,&quot; she says. &quot;It was a multicultural moment. Black people aren't
immune to the nationalism in this country. That was a moment when
global solidarity was pouring in and instead of people reaching out,
they closed down. So this was a moment that clearly involved black
people. But it clearly didn't envelop Arabs.&quot;

Black Americans may not have been immune to the hyper-patriotism of
recent years, but they were more resistant to it. Of all racial
groups, African-Americans have still been the least likely to support
both the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. None the less, explains Davis,
&quot;enough black people perceived it as a consolidation in nationalism.
They finally felt part of the nation. It didn't matter that one
million were in prison. It only mattered that they were part of the
nation.&quot;

Davis is, however, encouraged by the youth of all races. &quot;I'm amazed
at the sophistication of a lot of younger people,&quot; she says. &quot;We
didn't have the ability when I was younger to say all the things we
wanted to say. We didn't have the conceptual opportunities for that. A
lot of this stuff just rolls off their tongues. Whatever they produce
won't be an insurgency of the old type, although I do think that
engagement with race and racism will be an important part of it. You
have to get over the idea that you win something once and for all and
that struggles have to look the same.&quot;

The situation they have inherited, however, is &quot;complicated&quot;. &quot;I don't
envy people trying to give political leadership now,&quot; she says. &quot;In
the past it was easy. There was black and white.&quot;

· Angela Davis, Gary Younge, Heather Small, Wole Soyinka and Stuart
