There goes his no claims bonus... if he has insurance.

Some young scooter rider about an hour ago decided to plant himself in
the back of the nice shiny 2 year old Nissan Almira Tino which
occupies my driveway.

I was sitting at the front of some traffic lights in Hythe going home
waiting for them to change, handbrake on, neutral, listening to Radio
4 when I see a red scooter in my rear view mirror coming in my
direction.

Rider looked like he'd adopted some kind of 'sports' position at
first, but then when he got closer he appeared to be looking down
where his feet lived perhaps rearranging some shopping.  He was
getting closer and still wasn't looking where he was going and hadn't
slowed down so I give a long honk of the horn and he looked up, gave
it a handful of whatever brakes red scooters have, slows down but
plants himself sideways into the back of the car with a big thud on
the back window.

Car ignition off, take keys out, hazard lights on, traffic lights
still red.  I quickly go to see what Mr. Scooter has done to himself.

He looked a bit still at first (think of the paperwork....) and was
sporting a blue and white Adidas number top and bottom, matching
trainers, no gloves and a motorcycle helmet as his primary protection.
I bent down and asked him if he was okay and he rolled around a bit
and tried to get up.  I let him know that he should probably stay
where he was and not move but he decided to have a cough and splutter
and get up and then fall down on the pavement and kept whining about
his hands but was otherwise still alive and full of adrenaline.

As he was hurt I called an ambulance and police (Highway Code someone
injured in RTA = must tell police) who arrived promptly but before
they arrived I had a natter with the kid, got his phone number and
address.  He said he didn't have his insurance details on him and he
couldn't remember who he was insured with.  I called the phone number
he gave me while he was still there (to make sure the phone number was
valid in case he didn't have any insurance) and a woman answered and
after explaining that he son was okay she asked to speak to him.  I
handed my phone over to him and I could hear her screaming at him from
ten feet away.  Something tells me this isn't going to be the last he
hears about this from his mum.

The ambulance arrives and gives him the once over, they wash out some
of the cuts on his hand and his mother comes running down the road and
starts telling me off for hurting her son.  Thankfully the police
quickly tidy the situation up and are quite happy to accept from the
red scooter sized dent in the back of the car, the bumper, the broken
rear windscreen wiper, the discoloured couple of inches of rear window
and the snapped numberplate that he hit me when I was stationary.  I
gave the police my details and took the name and address of Mother
Scooter (which matches the address her son gave me) and continued my
journey home.

I'll call Royal &amp; SunAlliance tomorrow to put in a claim my end.

You mean they *didn't check* that your reversing lights weren't lit at the
point of impact?

Very shoddy work...

It's a long story but the main points are it's an adapted car which
carries my disabled father and it belongs to Motability thus it's not
my car.  While it's in for repair at their authorised repair shoppe a
proper replacement needs to be made available so not just any car will
do to take my father to his many hospital appointments.

If it was just a normal car then I'd make do but to save on hassle
I'll do it properly through them.  The excess is £75 and the insurance
is 'free' anyway so no increase in premium for the car will arise
either.

So it turns out to be a kid.  Fortunately for them they are still bendy

Claims in the past have been done quite swiftly.  They have a specoal
Motability unit.  Not that I've made any claims in the past, but
Mother has when she drove into the side of a car wash (don't ask) and
the like.

Even so, the MIB would have covered something like this.

&lt;Digging up the past&gt; Mother said that it wasn't her fault and she
wasn't going to put a claim in as my bike was somehow in the wrong so
I phoned up Auntie Carole and told mother that she really should call
her insurance company before Carole Nash did.

After about 8 hours she did, which is nice of her.
