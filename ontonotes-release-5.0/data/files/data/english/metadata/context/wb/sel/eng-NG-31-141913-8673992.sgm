Greek PM gets mandate to form new gov't

ATHENS, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis
Monday received a mandate to form a new government, one day after
voters swept him and his ruling New Democracy party back to power in
Sunday's parliamentary election.

&quot;We are fully aware of our responsibilities toward the people,
regardless of what they voted,&quot; Karamanlis said after his customary
meeting with Greek President Karolos Papoulias.

The president gave Karamanlis the mandate to form a government.

Karamanlis raised his party's banner of reforms when speaking to the
nation in a televised statement in Athens after his party clinched its
re-election, saying that the result was a clear mandate from the people
for his government to carry out the reforms.

Karamanlis and his party were re-elected after winning about 41.84
percent of the votes and a working majority of 152 seats in the
300-member single-chamber parliament.

The main opposition PASOK party posted a slump with 38.1 percent of
the votes and 102 seats in the parliament.

The two left parties, the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and the
Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA), posted a strong showing,
gaining 8.15 percent and 5.04 percent of the votes respectively. The
KKE won 22 seats and the SYRIZA won 14 seats, nearly doubling their
parliamentary seats.

The Popular Orthodox Rally (LAOS) party, with 3.79 percent of the
votes and 10 seats, became the newcomer to the first-ever five-party
parliament.

Incumbent victorious in Greece

Karamanlis secures another term with his party's victory,
despite anger at his response to deadly wildfires.

By Paul Tugwell and Tracy Wilkinson

SARONIDA, GREECE--Greece's ruling conservatives on Sunday won a
fiercely contested election overshadowed by the summer's devastating
wildfires, scoring a victory despite widespread public discontent that
gave a boost to smaller political parties.

With nearly all of the ballots counted, the New Democracy Party of
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis was ahead with about 42.2%, while the
leading opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, had about
38.2%.

Karamanlis claimed victory early today, saying the nation had handed
him a &quot;clear mandate to continue with the reforms the country needs.&quot;
And PASOK leader George Papandreou conceded defeat, saying his party
had &quot;fought a battle and lost it.&quot;

The two factions have taken turns ruling Greece for decades.

Many voters spurned the traditional leaders and voted for parties that
ranged from the hard-line left to extreme right, according to the exit
polls. The two major parties together took 86% of the vote in 2004.

&quot;I voted for KKE [the Communist Party], not because I believe in
communism but because I'm tired of the two large parties,&quot; said
Anastasios Papailias, a 46-year-old tour operator, outside a polling
station south of Athens. &quot;It's better to have a stronger presence of
the smaller parties in parliament so New Democracy and PASOK can't do
whatever they want.&quot;

Voters were outraged at the government's seemingly clumsy handling of
the recent wildfires that killed at least 65 people and destroyed
thousands of acres of prime farm and forest land. And the blame did not
stop there; voters accused successive governments of neglecting the
environment and turning Greece into the tinderbox that made it so
vulnerable to the fires' destructive rampage.

Financial scandals and a host of pocketbook issues also played an
important role in Sunday's vote. Although unemployment is down and the
economy is growing at a respectable pace, 20% of the country still
lives below the poverty line, making Greece one of the poorest members
of the European Union.

Karamanlis, prime minister since 2004, called elections six months
early and is now on the verge of another four-year term. He said before
Sunday's election that his government was determined to pursue
difficult economic changes, such as overhauling the pension system. He
also pledged to help rebuild areas ruined in the fires.

&quot;Our country lived through an unprecedented natural catastrophe . . .
and yet from this trial we have emerged armed with greater
determination,&quot; he told supporters. &quot;The state will do whatever is
needed, for as long as it is needed, to completely heal all the wounds.&quot;

With election returns coming in late Sunday and early today, it
remained unclear by what margin New Democracy would win. Securing a
clear majority in the 300-seat Parliament is crucial to its ability to
govern and carry out its promised program.

If preliminary projections hold, it would appear that the Socialists
were unable to capitalize sufficiently on dissatisfaction with the
government. PASOK's performance calls into question Papandreou's future
as party leader.

Both he and Karamanlis are scions of family dynasties that have
dominated Greek politics for most of the last half-century.

To the extent that voters went with smaller parties, they were
rebelling against the status quo that the two dynasties represent.

&quot;I didn't want to vote for either of the two large parties; they're out
of touch,&quot; said first-time voter Constantinos Danos, 19. He said he
cast his ballot for the Green Party as &quot;a new and different alternative
to the big parties. And they have fresher ideas. I also feel that they
are closer to Greece's youth.&quot;

Athina Papadopoulou, 45, a lawyer, cast a protest vote for a far-left
party because none of the other factions held any appeal for her.

&quot;This election was a real dilemma,&quot; Papadopoulou said. &quot;I didn't want
to give my vote to either of the two large parties, as they are both as
bad as one another, always saying the same things.&quot;

Georgia Vlaxou, 34, who organizes conferences for a living, said she
voted for New Democracy, as she always has, but reluctantly.

&quot;There is no real alternative,&quot; she said. &quot;In Greece, we need something
new, perhaps a new party with younger politicians and new ideas.&quot;

A likely benefactor of the desertion from the main parties is a
far-right, populist faction known as LAOS, its acronym in Greek. Early
results indicate that it will probably meet the 3% vote threshold
needed to enter Parliament for the first time.

The party is seen by many as xenophobic: It advocates closer ties to
the Greek Orthodox Church, a quota on immigration and the deportation
of many immigrants already in the country.

Car salesman Vangelis Kalogeropoulos, 34, abandoned New Democracy for
LAOS because the two main parties &quot;promise everything and deliver
nothing.&quot;

Kalogeropoulos said he didn't support LAOS, but he wanted &quot;another
voice in Parliament that can act as a brake on New Democracy and PASOK.&quot;

Late Sunday, celebrations for New Democracy had erupted in Athens, with
cars clogging streets, drivers honking their horns.
