Can a form change session variables?
</HEADLINE>

Hi,

In the first page I declare a session variable. Than, on the same
page, I make a form which contains a variable which  has the same name
as the mentioned session variable. Pressing the &quot;submit&quot; button of the
form I go to the second page which immediately redirects me back to
the first page (with the &quot;header&quot;). And the mentioned variable does
NOT have the value which I have specified in the form.

It means, that session does NOT recognize the form variables as
session variables in spite on the fact that these variables have
identical names. Is that true?

PHP does not automaticall register variables with your session.

Please review http://de.php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php for details.

Do you access your (expected) form/session variable like this:
$_SESSION['count'] ?

It used to - there is a parm in the php.ini file called register_globals.

In earlier versions, this was enabled and would do what you want.
However, this is a huge security risk and has been disabled by default
in recent versions.

It's simple to get the variable from the session, though.

What do you mean under &quot;PHP ... register&quot;? I have registered variables
by &quot;session_register&quot;.

No. I do like that:
session_start();
session_register(&quot;txt_l_1&quot;);
..........
print &quot;&lt;input type='text' name='txt_l_1' value=\&quot;$txt_l_1\&quot; &gt;\n&quot;;

The user has no knowledge of anything in the session (other than the
session name), since everything is on the server (and thus unavailable
to the user).

And yes, you stored the value in the session, so it's easy to retrieve
it from the session whenever you need it.  It will be there until either
you clear it or the session is ended.

register_global is actually broken in 5.2.5, set it to off and it still acts
as if  on.

If that were the case I would expect to see a bug report at php.net.
There isn't one.

Unless I totally misunderstood... if I set register_globals to off, and set
$_SESSION['foo'] = 1, I should not be able to access $foo, eight? but I can.

Sure you can.  The two have no relationship to each other.

$_SESSION['foo'] is an element of the $_SESSION array with the index of
'foo'.

$foo is a variable named 'foo'.

The only thing they have in common is an 'f' and two 'o's.

And please learn to quote properly.

I agree with jerry stuckle

$_SESSION is different from $foo;
$_SESSION is different from $_GET['foo'];
$_GET['foo'] is the same with $foo (if register_global is on, if not
they are different.)

the only relationship with session with $foo or $_GET['foo'], they are
both variables in php.
session used to store variables like $foo, $_GET['foo'] on current
session. thats why we have
session_register(); to register variable on session. coz they are
different.

if they are not different, they will not provide session_register...

I missed what point?  You didn't quote the relevant points of my
message, so I have no idea what you're talking about.

Then don't expect to get answers on this newsgroup.

What you say has absolutely no importance at all.

It's hard to follow a thread without any quoting. Too much quoting is
bad, but too less or no quoting at all is even worse. You want to read
about the netiquette.
