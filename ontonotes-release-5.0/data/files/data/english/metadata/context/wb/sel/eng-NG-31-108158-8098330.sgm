Carole Schember gave me something to think about when she said &quot;the
world would be a better place if everyone read the Boy Scout
Handbook.&quot; I first met Carole Schember when I was working on a news
story about a local scout leader.

We sat in her daughter's living room, and while we talked, she
absently paged through a copy of &quot;The Official Boy Scout Handbook.&quot; It
wasn't a new book, but it had the same lovingly used look I've seen
with some Bibles.

And she spoke passionately about how young people need direction, and
good role models.

We ended our visit, and as I was about to leave, she handed me her
copy of the Boy Scout Handbook and said &quot;I want you to have this.&quot;

I hadn't given scouting much thought for 40 years, but I knew it was a
gift that was being given with great feeling. I stood at the door and
paged through the book, past chapters on topics I've always identified
as the backbone of scouting -- pitching tents, tying square knots and
hiking. I told Mrs. Schember I have a 6-year-old son, and would be
honored to share the book with him.

I was a scout when I was young, but there weren't enough kids in Rose
Creek to form a Boy Scout troop. So the program ended following the
Webelos program, the transition between Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts.

I had pretty much forgotten about my scouting days until that visit
with Carole Schember, and after putting Steven to bed that night, I
settled in on the couch to read through the handbook more carefully.

And the memories came flooding back, memories of weekly pack meetings,
scouting jamborees on the Mower County Fairgrounds and community
service projects such as picking up garbage in the ditches along
Highway 56.

Once, we even found a dollar in the ditch. In 1966, it was enough to
buy each of the 10 kids in our pack an ice cream cone.

I remembered walking with my Cub Scout pack in Rose Creek's centennial
parade in 1967; and earning an Arrowhead by completing a project that
required the planning, cooking and cleanup of a meal for your family
-- in my case, hamburgers, French fries and chocolate malts.

I even built a pretty fast Pinewood Derby car.

And each month I would page through my copy of &quot;Boy's Life&quot; and be
fascinated by stories about stamp collecting, space exploration, or
kids my age who were organizing food drives and cleanup projects in
their communities.

I was in some pretty good company. More than 100 million Americans
have been Boy Scouts since the organization was founded in 1910. Neil
Armstrong and Henry Aaron were scouts. So were Walter Cronkite, Bill
Gates and Steven Spielberg. Gerald Ford and Harrison Ford too.

But reading through the handbook reminded me that there is more to
scouting than building campfires and learning first aid. The Scout Law
proclaims that &quot;A scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly,
courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and
reverent.&quot;

Objectively, I'd say I accomplished about six of those things today.
There's room for improvement, but what a great goal.

My copy of the Boy Scout Handbook is looking a little more worn now
than it was when I first got it, and I have shared it with Steven.

And now I know what Carole Schember was talking about.

Maybe if we heard &quot;On my honor I will do my best ...&quot; more often, we
wouldn't hear &quot;You have the right to remain silent ...&quot; so much.
