Subject: Physical reasons why not to eat meat

Physical reasons why not to eat meat

Meat-eating societies have been created by man. God never intended for us to
eat meat. During the past 20 years the United States and Europe have shared
the nefarious title of being the largest consumers of animals in the world.
Perhaps this could be the main reason as to why we also have the highest
amount of people per capita in prisons, mental institutions, and hospitals
and why we have the most incurable and horrible diseases in the world. We
question third- world countries, where the people are illiterate and live
simply, but there is actually very little disease there – especially where
the people are mostly vegetarian.
Today, the consciousness of the people has been somewhat raised in that they
are aware it is wrong to torture animals in laboratory experiments but these
same people have no understanding when it comes to actually eating them!God
is all mercy, love and grace and cannot bear to see how abuse and tortured
the animals He has created have become. One of the 10 great Commandments
given to Moses was "Thou shalt not kill."The cattle industry has, in recent
years, become one of the largest and most wealthy industries in the U.S., if
not the world. It also is a powerful monopoly in the food business. Another
powerful industry is health care –hospitals, pharmaceutical companies,
doctors, and health insurance. Is there a direct correlation between these
two industries?

Most of the animals living today in the U.S., New Zealand & Australia; The
far East; Africa; China; Russia, and Europe are grown for eating
purposes.All animals raised for consumption – cows, pigs, sheep, chickens,
and even some fish, are grown in an artificial environment, often in small,
confined holding pens or cages. They are crowded together and fed grains
that contain chemical stimulants to make the animals grow abnormally fast
and synthetically fat. The muscles and tissues of the animals are pumped up
through the effect of these chemicals. Most of these poor creatures never
see the light of day. Chicken's beaks are cut off so they cannot peck each
other to death, due to their miserable living conditions. Their wings are
also cut so they cannot fly. When their death sentence is issued, they are
put on a conveyer belt and the head is pulled off. When it is time for
slaughtering the poor cows, sheep, pigs, and goats, they are shipped by
truck or train boxcar to various slaughter/ packing houses in the country.
Upon reaching their destination, the innocent creatures are herded into
holding pens and crowded together to await execution. Of course, these
animals are not dumb. They can feel, smell and hear the fate they are abut
to experience.

In this complete state of terror and panic, the animal secretes deadly
hormones into its nervous system, which are pumped into each muscle of the
animal.Tortuous death is either by a bullet to the brain, electrocution, or
the throat is cut. When the animal is butchered, certain other hormones,
chemical dyes, and preservatives are allowed to be injected into the dead
flesh of the animal so it can stay in the meat counters a longer period of
time without rotting. The public has been warned due to the contamination of
our oceans and because of the dyes and preservatives used in the meats.

There are two easy ways to become a vegetarian:
1. Visit one of these slaughterhouses.
2. Try to butcher a live cow or sheep yourself and eat it.

We are walking on a double-edged sword: ingesting deadly and carcinogenic
hormones, chemicals and dyes that either the animal secretes itself, has
eaten, or is injected with after death.All meat eaters suffer horrible
nightmares at one time or another. Perhaps this is one reaction to eating
meat.No animal will never willingly offer itself to you for slaughter, but
fruits,nuts, vegetables and grains change to a beautiful color and drop
automatically when they are ready. Most also reproduce themselves
spontaneously.
It takes about two acres of grain to produce one beef cow, whereas 100 human
beings can be fed using the same amount of grain. A vegetarian diet is
cheaper and has more variety. Vegetarians are usually very healthy, suffer
little dental problems, have more energy, and look fresher and brighter than
meat eaters. With the ingestion of more living foods, lethargy decreases and
energy increases, constipation ends and disease diminishes. As far as
protein content goes, we have been propagandized to think we need more
protein than we actually do. Simple alfalfa sprouts have more protein
content than meat. Sprouts are a living food to give vitality and energy –
meat is totally dead and useless.Interesting that most animals people eat –
are vegetarian themselves! The strongest animal in the world is the elephant
and it eats leaves and grasses only.
