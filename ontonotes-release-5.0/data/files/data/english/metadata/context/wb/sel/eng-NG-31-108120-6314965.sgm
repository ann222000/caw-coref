Just out of interest, what is the purpose of petal shaped lens hoods?

Is it so that you can still access filters and lens cap with the hood
installed, or is it because they are designed to let more light to the
corners of the photo?  Or maybe something else?

Petal shaped hoods control flare better than round types because they take
into account the aspect ratio of the camera's sensor, so the angle of view
is greater in one direction than the other.

When mounted correctly, notice that the largest petals are above
and below the lens, corresponding to the shortest dimension of the
sensor.  The petals on the left and right are shorter, and
correspond to the greater horizontal width of the sensor.  The lens
hood's cutaways in the corners are shorter than any of the petals

That's not what I am sure about.

The Canon 24mm prime and 35mm prime have a petal hood, however the 50mm and
85mm have a round hood.  Then the 70-200 2.8 has a petal style hood.

That's because the wider thhe angle of the lens, the more critical it
is to keep the hood out of the way to prevent vignetting.  Longer focal
lengths don't *need* to go with a petal style, usually, although some
come with them.

No.  It's possible for a lens hood to increase vignetting, but
they're not used to prevent it.  Their purpose is to prevent the
wrong light rays from hitting the lens, the ones that produce
unwanted reflections and flare.  Think of how people sometimes put
their hands up to their eyes to help eliminate glare it they're

The ultimate lens hood will let only light hit the lens that's
going to end up impacting the sensor.  The light rays that are
blocked should be those that would go wide of the sensor.  A round
lens hood could only meet these qualifications if the sensor was
round.  Since the sensor is rectangular, the more effective lens
hoods are the ones that use petals.  If they're circular, they'll
either pass some light rays that they shouldn't, or block others
that shouldn't be blocked (causing a bit of vignetting).  If a well
designed round lens hood is used, you could always add some petals
to it to make it a bit more effective.  This might not provide
enough additional benefit to compensate for the larger size that
might make it harder to pack and store conveniently.

That's closer. "Petal-shaped" or "cookie cutter" lens hoods, also sometimes
called "perfect" lens hoods, are designed to keep non-image-forming light
rays out of the lens as much as is practicable, by blocking more of the
light from the top, bottom and sides that would fall outside the rectangle
of the film or sensor.

Actually, Charles, I don't think that's the reason.  The cutouts are there
to avoid vignetting on the corners of wide angle lenses, wide zooms when set
wide, and even some short to long tele zooms, like the 70-200 f2.8L IS
Canon. Notice that lenses like the 100-400 IS Canon don't have petal shaped
hoods, nor does the 70-200 f4L IS.

You may be right, maybe even probably.  &lt;g&gt;  But it was an odd way
to put it, since if there's no vignetting without a lens hood,
adding a lens hood designed for a particular lens should add no
vignetting whatsoever, whether the hood is round or has
petals/cutouts.  If a round lens hood extends as far as possible
beyond the lens so that to extend it any further would initiate
vignetting, if the hood was extended with petals in the proper
locations, vignetting wouldn't be introduced. But more potentially
flare producing light would be blocked.

I should amend my first sentence.  Since vignetting is one of the
easier image problems for software to correct, there might be a use
for super-hoods, designed to block "too much" light.  This would be
useful for lenses that are notorious flare producers, or even for
good, relatively flare-free lenses if they are needed to take
pictures of objects near very bright lights, even if the lights
aren't within the frame.  It would a worthwhile tradeoff for some
situations, eliminating the more problematical flare at the expense
of vignetting that can be corrected.

: He means isn't the cutout there to prevent vignetting, I think...

A lens hood with no cutouts can only be of a length that is just short of
causing vignetting. But with a petal shape, the hood can be longer with
the cuts fitting the corners of the FOV. Where the corners of the image
would extend to the circle of the lens, the middle of the sides do not
extend as far out, and thus the petals can extend further to provide more
protection. Notice that lenses that extend more into the wide angle end
have deeper cuts and more rounded petals. While more tele lenses the cuts
are much shallower (or not there at all) and the petals can be more
squared off. That's why a lens hood must be for a particular lens. The
shape and depth of the hood must match the Field of View of the widest
setting of the lens it will be used with. A mismatched hood could cause
the edges of the hood to intrude onto the image at the widest angle, which
is what vignetting is, afterall.

Maybe for a "super hood" we need a hood that changes length and shape to
reflect the current zoom setting of the lens. This way the hood would
always block all possible off-axis light while stopping just short of
vigneting. :)

Good idea!  The first generation would be "dumb", similar to the
automatic zooming done by some flash units.  In a few years when
enough DSLRs are using EVFs, the "live view" can be tapped to
dynamically operate the hoods for best performance.  (DOH!)

In a halfway there solution Hoya makes a a multi-angle rubber hood
filter you can see what it looks like at:

http://www.2filter.com/prices/products/hoyamulti.html

It still does not solve the problem that a petal shape hood attempts to
fix by having less hood at the corners to accomodate the wider field of
view at the diagonal.  And one thing that has not been noted, on a lens
that rotates the front element while focusing, the petal hood had better
be adjustable like a polarizer filter.  Otherwise, those cutouts will
rotate and be in the wrong postion.

&gt; In a halfway there solution Hoya makes a a multi-angle rubber hood
&gt; filter you can see what it looks like at:

&gt; It still does not solve the problem that a petal shape hood attempts to
&gt; fix by having less hood at the corners to accomodate the wider field of
&gt; view at the diagonal.  And one thing that has not been noted, on a lens
&gt; that rotates the front element while focusing, the petal hood had better
&gt; be adjustable like a polarizer filter.  Otherwise, those cutouts will
&gt; rotate and be in the wrong postion.

Uhm... the hood attaches to the front - if it rotates, the hood rotates
with it.

And if the hood rotates with it there would be a vignetting
problem, since the sensor doesn't rotate.  I assume that by
referring to the "front" rotating, you're not talking about the
entire camera rotating with it.  :)

Oops, yeah, You're Right.  I was just thinking of the lens, not the
sensor, which IS the whole point.  Duh.

It would also be pretty clear that if the front element rotated, then
the lenshood for it would be a simple, round one.
Otherwise, a petal lenshood for this lens would have to attach to a part
of the lens-barrel that is non-rotating.

Canon did the reverse of this with the 24-70 f2.8L.  The lens hood is of a
cylindrical type, not a petal type, and the front element moves in and out
according to focal length to the proper point on the lens hood to give
maximum effect.

Hi Ed, bet you wish you'd never asked!!!  :-))))

The cutouts are still there to prevent vignetting.

Cheers,
