A prayer to angels before undertaking a journey:

In the way of peace direct us, O Lord. We praise and
venerate All the heavenly princes, But especially Raphael,
Faithful physician And companion true, Who with Heaven's
power Bindeth fast the demon.

V. God hath given His Angels charge over thee.
R. To keep thee in all thy ways.

Let us pray:

O God, who didst give the blessed Archangel Raphael unto
Thy servant Tobias to be his fellow-traveler; grant unto us,
Thy servants, that the same may ever keep us and shield us,
help us and defend us.  Through Christ our Lord.  Amen.

Let us go forward in peace, In the name of the Lord.  Amen.

April 4th - St. Isidore of Seville, Doctor (RM)

Born at Cartagena, Spain, c. 560; died in Seville, Spain, in April 4, 636;
canonized by Pope Clement VIII in 1598; and declared a Doctor of the Church
by Pope Innocent XIII in 1722.
Saint Isidore was born into a noble Hispano-Roman family, which also
produced Saints Leander, Fulgentius, and Florentina. Their father was
Severian, a Roman from Cartagena, who was closely connected to the
Visigothic kings. Though Isidore became one of the most erudite men of his
age, as a boy he hated his studies, perhaps because his elder brother, Saint
Leander, who taught him, was a strict task master.

It is probably that Isidore assisted Leander in governing his diocese,
because, in 601, Saint Isidore succeeded his brother Leander to the
archiepiscopal see of Seville. During his long episcopate, Isidore
strengthened the Spanish church by organizing councils, establishing schools
and religious houses, and continuing to turn the Visigoths from Arianism. He
presided over the Council of Seville in 619 and that of Toledo in 633, where
he was given precedence over the archbishop of Toledo on the ground of his
exceptional merit as the greatest teacher in Spain.

Aware of the great boon of education, Isidore insisted that a cathedral
school should be established in every diocese in Spain-centuries before
Charlemagne issued a similar decree. He thought that students should be
taught law and medicine, Hebrew and Greek, as well as the classics. These
schools were similar to contemporary seminaries.

For centuries Isidore was known as 'the schoolmaster of the middle ages,'
because he wrote a 20-volume Etymologies or Origins, an encyclopedia of
everything that was known in 7th century Europe. His "Chronica Majora"
summarized all the events in the world from creation to his own time drawn
from other church historians but with the addition of Spanish history.
Another book completed Saint Jerome's work of biographies of every great man
and woman mentioned in the Bible plus those of many Spanish notables. His
history of the Goths and Vandals is very valuable today. He also wrote new
rules for monasteries, including one that bears his name and was generally
followed throughout Spain, and books about astronomy, geography, and
theology.

While not an original or critical thinker, Saint Isidore's works were highly
influential in the middle ages as demonstrated by the very large number of
manuscripts of his writings. Dante mentions him in the Paradiso (x, 130), in
the company of the Venerable Bede and the Scottish Richard of Saint-Victor.
In fact, at the time of his death, Bede was working on a translation of
extracts from Isidore's book "On the wonders of nature" (De natura rerum).

Isidore longed to convert the Spanish Goths, who were Arians. He rewrote the
liturgies and breviaries of the Church for their use (known as the Mozarabic
Rite, which had been began by Leander), and never wearied of preaching and
teaching those in error during his 37 years as archbishop. He also sought to
convert the local Jews, but by highly questionable methods.

This extraordinary man loved to give to the poor, and towards the end of his
life scarcely anyone could get into his house in Seville, crowded as it was
with beggars and the unfortunate from the surrounding countryside.

When he felt that death was near, he invited two bishops to visit. Together
they went to the church where one of them covered him with sackcloth and the
other put ashes upon his head. Thus clad in the habit of a penitent, he
raised his hands to heaven and prayed earnestly for forgiveness. Then he
received the viaticum, asked for the prayers of those present, forgave those
who had sinned against him, exhorted all to charity, bequeathed his earthly
possessions to the poor, and gave up his soul to God.

The archbishop of Seville was considered the most learned man of his
century. Not only for the reason that the Church was able to proclaim him
Doctor a short time after his death, or because he is the author of the
Etymologies, but because knowledge permeated his whole being. The nexus of
sanctity and learning gladdens this heart.

Learning did not turn Saint Isidore away from sanctity. Indeed, it was
sanctity that surely made such a learned man of him. The saint, possessed by
God, is full of gifts of the Holy Spirit; and learning is one of them. This
learning, the true science which contains all other sciences, favors new
discoveries and multiplies it in every domain that is approached.

Saints are most exclusively the savants of God and their private works are
no less important. And savants are a type of saint because any discovery
discloses something of God. The philosopher as well as the painter, the
seeker as well as the poet, is a savant.

Recall another Spanish saint, John of the Cross, whose works nearly brought
a contemporary philosopher to the edges of sanctity. The bird in Braque's
last painting is a figure of grace. This revelation leads me to believe that
the patient hand that was the means of painting could not have been anything
other than that of a man on the way to sanctity. One can paint birds without
making them suggest such a presence as Braque's painting does. This presence
is not that of the artist, he has absolutely effaced himself; it is the
presence of that which finally transcends him, the presence of God.

The most learned persons have perceived the richness, the 'odor' of
sanctity. Our age may see it flower; how could it have a taste for anything
else after having plumbed the depths of nothingness and despair, if, of
course, it still wants something to which it can aspire. Our generation
needs something solid, substantial. It is dying of weariness and thirst.

A life-giving stream is still running, all we need to do is bend down to
drink it in order to renew the ancient gestures and enter humbly, without
hesitation or compromise, into that which does not go out of fashion and
does not age: into this Church in which today we pray to Saint Isidore, who
is the patron of savants. Saint Isidore, pray for us and for them (Attwater,
Benedictines, Bentley, Delaney, Encyclopedia, Farmer, Walsh).

In art, Saint Isidore is an old bishop with a prince at his feet. At times
he may be depicted (1) with pen and book (often his Etymologia); (2) with a
beehive or bees (rare, but symbolizes oratorical eloquence); or (3) with his
brothers and sister, SS. Leander, Fulgentius, and Florentina (Roeder).
