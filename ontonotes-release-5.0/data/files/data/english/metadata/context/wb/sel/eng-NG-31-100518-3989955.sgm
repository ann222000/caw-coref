Hi,

I am at the moment fighting a battle with Jaguar cars to get my 18 month old
S-type fixed.

My main complaints are,

Faulty transmission which I've let them have two attempts at fixing before
realising that there is an inherent problem.

Premature wear of the rear brakes which lead to the pads and disks needing
replacing and a bill of £400

Crappy dealers, I've tried three so far.

But most annoying of all is the fact that they can't fix the problems with
the transmission even though it is clear that many other owners are
suffering the same type of symptoms.

I am sorry to hear how you have been bitten. Yes you are not alone with
these problems and the list keeps getting longer. This is not opinion,
this is fact as you personally know now.

Let me ask you this...when you first bought it did the transmission
shift slowly? Did it shudder sometimes? There has been a few
transmission controller firmware updates did you stealer(dealer)
mention this? Did he mention what revision number yours has? I can get
you the update numbers if you dealer plays stupid.

FORD has had a bad habbit making silky smooth shifting, something that
will damage the trans is driven spirited. Performance shifts and sudden
and rapid; does this sound like yours? Slow shifting allows friction
disk slippage and ultimately lead to failures unless you drive like
grandma.

Here is another fine example of a corporation that knows they have
issues and do everything to cover it up until the Government steps in
or a group lawsuit is pending. People say "Oh the Jag has been
completely re-engineered and is not  similar to the FORD. If that is
true then why does the Lincoln LS and the Jaguar S type suffer from the
same failures? Hmm.

People on this board dont like me ranting and they make personal
attacks instead of asking for my proof or facts. Quality is not leather
wood and chrome, its longevity. Quality is not having every conceivable
gadget know to man, its piece of mind. I had a junky little car called
a Suzuki Swift. I put 325,000 miles on it and all I ever did to it was
change the timing belt and replace the clutch disk. It was the most
reliable car I have ever owned. Now that is Quality.

As for dealerships..I think they get blamed way too much. What people
dont understand is that the factory dictates what the time is to do a
warranty job and how much they will re-imburse the dealer. I would say
that 85% of warranty work ends up with the dealership eating the
difference. Factory says "!.0 hour to do the work", reality is 2.5hrs.
If you were a dealership would you want to do warranty work at your
loss?

Praise corporations, praise the way they treat us. They are simply
infallible; anyone else that differs from this mantra is an asshole.
(Like me.)

Me Too!!! (LMAO!!!)

These things have had problems with the Ford transmission since the car was
in development. Ford management forced the damn gearbox on Jaguar
engineering, claiming it would save $1,000 per car. (Our guys wanted the ZF
box the car now has). In the end, the crappy gearbox has been a nightmare,
costing driveability, customer satisfaction, warrnaty costs, buy backs, you
name it. But, some beancounter, somewher in Ford probably got a big bonus
and a promotion for this dumb ass decision.
A friend currently drives an '04 Ford pickup.  Guess what? It just got
recalled, needs a major trans repair!

Are you suggesting that is a good idea to keep the transmission in Sport
mode so that the shifts are crisper?
Not fixing the root cause, but getting more life.

Agree with your definition of quality.

My 2003 S-Type R had a shutter making a left turn within a week of buying it
(new).  Brought it in and the dealer fixed it.  Replaced a controller part
if I recall correctly.  Not sure if it was in the transmission or the brake
assembly.  I also took it in several months later for a transmission recall.
When I got it back a note was attached to the receipt saying to drive it
without Sport mode for 500 miles.  I did.  However, with Sport mode turned
off it tends to bang into the next gear, more so when downshifting. So I
leave Sport mode turned on where it shifts smoothly.

What year are these S-Types? My wife wants one and we hear good and bad
about the quality and the dealerships.

LMAO! Actually, the post '02 models with the ZF 6 speed are quite good. The
original used a Ford Explorer-derived truck 5 speed that simply sucked eggs.
Ford forced it on the Jaguar design team, claiming it saved $1,000 per car.
Unfortunately, it COST over that much in warranty repairs, and lost revenue
from bad press &amp; customer dissatisfaction. Typical Ford bean-counter
madness.
