In a recent post, J indicated that this place is not for those two diseases.

I have a question: why not??

I realize there is a specific group for breast cancer and that should be
pointed out (and I assume there is one for leukemia?).

But why would such a person be unwelcome here? I just don't get it. This is
an unmoderated group. It would seem there might be issues aside from the
specificity of the type of cancer that would be appropriate here. What am I
missing? Did the group take a vote and decide all those folks were
unwelcome? If so, did it take a majority vote or unanimous vote?? (I am only
being a tad facetious)

(Oh, and ditto for prostate cancer).

I get the point. My question too. Everyone weith cancer, or possible

Hi, MZB,

You tweaked my curiosity.  Each newsserver carries a somewhat different
list of newsgroups.  I just checked with mine (Giganews) and found
newsgroups for breast cancer and prostate cancer, but not for leukemia or
lung cancer.  Us cancer victims need to stick together.  This is as good a
place as any.  I don't know why any cancer victim would be made to feel
unwelcome here (unless he was perhaps a head case, too, but that is not
right either).

I have lung cancer, you have interests in leukemia and breast cancer,
perhaps we can be of help to each other anyway.

Hi Andy:

I just assumed there was one for leukemia because of a remark J made, but
perhaps I'm mistaken.

I THOUGHT she said this group is not for leukemia victims but I can't find
it now.

Oh, here is the remark from one of J's posts:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Ask and we'll let
you know where you'll be best served.
Other examples of referrals: Different places for leukemias and
lymphomas.  So they can compare notes on types of, symptoms and treatments
specific to their cancers. Or questions specific to those types of
cancers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

I might have read more into this than I should. Not sure if she is advising
folks not to post here or merely suggesting that there may be better
alternatives. I strongly disagree with the former if that is the case. I
agree with the latter as merely an additional place to seek information.

Andy, I first discovered this group when I ended up with superficial basal
cell carcinoma. ie: the best kind to get.

My family practice doctor was going to excise it and although I have a very
high level of confidence in him, I posted asking if I should be referred to
a surgeon. Steph said my local doctor if he is decent should easily be able
to do the surgery. That was probably over 5 years ago. I took the advice and
was cured by the 15-minute procedure. Still, it was a near-traumatic
experience as just the mention of cancer certainly does make one confront
his/her mortality. A few years later my Dad was dx. with Merkel Cell
carcinoma. He passed away about 15 months later. This group was wonderfully
supportive and as a result, I still lurk here. I've always appreciated the
support of J and others.

I don't know if I know qualify to even peruse this group -- except that of
course I do as this is an UNMODERATED group.

I have no idea either. This is a generic group and should be all
encompassing for those with any type of cancer. They can always
seek out a more specific group if they want to.

Let's not make a big deal of this.  People with leukemia, breast &amp; prostate
cancers have specific issues that other specialized groups are much more
fmiliar with.  I can't see anyone being driven out of here - all are
welcome - but people with certain cancers are better served in groups
dealing with their cancers. Msny of the treatments for these cancers are
different &amp; specific. People here tend to cluster around lung, oral &amp; bowel
cancers with occasional others. If you want to 'compare notes' with others,
best with birds of a feather.

Hi, MZB,

My first run in with cancer was also with basal cell carcinoma (of which I
had dozens).  As slow growing as basal cell carcinoma is and as likely as
it is NOT to kill you I tend to call it ALMOST benign.  My next run in
with cancer was with squamous cell cancer (skin cancer), which is probably
the second best kind to get.   My last run in with cancer was with
squamous cell carcinoma (lung cancer), which is one of the worst kinds to
get.

Reason why I recommend ACOR.ORG as a far better source of cancer
information and support than found on an unmoderated Usenet newsgroup.
Yes, the ACOR mailing lists are moderated, but that keeps noise (and
spammers) to a minimum while providing access to many others going
through the same things; both as patients and caregivers.

&gt; &gt;I don't believe J said that they were &quot;not welcome here&quot;.  She merely tells

&gt; &gt;there, sobeit, if not, I am sure they are welcome here.

&gt; Reason why I recommend ACOR.ORG as a far better source of cancer
&gt; information and support than found on an unmoderated Usenet newsgroup.
&gt; Yes, the ACOR mailing lists are moderated, but that keeps noise (and

They are welcome here.  If one or two people say someone *isn't*
welcome here because they have the wrong kind of cancer, too bad---
others here will welcome them regardless.  They may be better served
in another ng, so it can help them to be directed there.  If they
don't have access to the more specific group, or simply would rather
visit here, they're welcome here.  In fact, such a patient is welcome
to crosspost to this group and the more specific group.  That's what
crossposting was invented for.  You said it, I said it, others have
said it---this is an unmoderated group, so nobody has the right to

I agree.

It is sad when I see that someone is made to feel unwelcome either directly
or perhaps in a more insidious manner by the tone of a post. Especially when
the post is written in the guise of a moderator, when no such moderator
exists.

I don't post much and I mostly lurk, but I would urge those of you that do
participate more than I do to quickly make such folks feel welcome here
while also pointing out that there are additional groups more specifically
devoted to the particular cancer (if it is is bc or pc).
