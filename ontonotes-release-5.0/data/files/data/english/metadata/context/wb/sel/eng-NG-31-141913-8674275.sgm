Cafe provides forum for anti-war soldiers

By Jaimeson Champion

Some 80 active-duty soldiers, their friends, families and supporters
gathered Sept. 1 at the Different Drummer Cafe in Watertown, N.Y., just
outside the Fort Drum military base, as part of a sendoff party
organized by the Fort Drum chapter of Iraq Veterans Against the War
(IVAW).

On the Net: Iraq Veterans Against the War

The IVAW called the event for a brigade of young soldiers from the Fort
Drum-based 10th Mountain Division that is about to embark on yet
another 15-month tour in Iraq and Afghanistan. For many soldiers in the
brigade, this will be their second or third tour through those
countriesb hellish battlefields, where they bring an even greater hell
to the Iraqi and Afghan people.

In Watertown and in base towns across the U.S., it is easy to see that
the so-called bvolunteer armyb of the U.S. is composed primarily of
working-class young women and men. Faced with few employment
opportunities and astronomical college tuition costs, working-class
young people are funneled into the ranks of the army by the economic
draft. While the corporations continue to rake in billions of
blood-soaked dollars from the occupation of Iraq, it is working-class
young women and men who will risk life and limb everyday for the next
15 months for a war that an increasing number of them oppose.

The Sept. 1 sendoff featured speakers from IVAW who stressed a message
of solidarity with their brothers and sisters who were about to be
redeployed into harmbs way. Speakers expressed their opposition to the
war in Iraq and spoke of the need to bring all the troops home
immediately so that not a single additional soldier will lose their
life in this imperialist conquest. The sendoff also featured live
musical performances that expressed anti-war sentiments.

The sendoff was the latest in a series of important events and
performances hosted by the Different Drummer Cafe, which opened in the
fall of 2006. The cafe is modeled after the famous GI coffeehouses of
the Vietnam era, which helped to organize GI opposition to the war
against Vietnam. During that other U.S. war of aggression, anti-war
activists established G.I. coffeehouses in base towns across the
country. These coffeehouses provided a safe space for soldiers to get
away off their bases and express their opposition to the war, away from
the watchful eyes of commanders on base. They complemented the work
done by active-duty GIs organizing in the barracks, such as those with
the American Servicemenbs Union (ASU).

The Different Drummer provides an open forum for GIs and anti-war
activists to share ideas and experiences from the current war. Film
showings and town-hall style meetings are held there regularly, with a
high priority placed on open discussion and the free exchange of ideas.
Film showings have included such titles as bPoison DUst,b about the
effects of depleted uranium, and bSir! No, Sir!b about GI resistance
during the Vietnam War. Live musical performances regularly draw in
sizable crowds of young people to the Different Drummer, many of them
active-duty soldiers from Fort Drum.

Recent polls of active-duty soldiers have shown that more than a third
of them no longer support the mission in Iraq. An additional third want
a firm troop withdrawal date set within this year.

But the politicians in Washington, both Republican and Democrat, have
shown that they are in no rush to end this war. Every day the war
continues is another day that the politiciansb real constituents, the
corporations and banks, continue to profit off the blood of the U.S.
troops and the Iraqi population. And after all, the politicians are not
the ones that have to see their buddies lose their limbs to roadside
bombs. They are not the ones who return home racked by post traumatic
stress disorder from the indescribable horrors faced on the battlefield.

The Republicans and Democrats in Washington have proven that they are
unwilling to end the war. But a surge in active-duty troops refusing to
fight or finding ways to resist could end the war in a heartbeat, and
help preserve the collective heartbeat of an entire generation of
working-class young people, besides bringing relief to millions in Iraq
and Afghanistan.

Active-duty organizing, mobilization of Iraq veterans, confrontation of
recruiters and places where GIs can meet and discuss like the Different
Drummer can all play a role in organizing the struggle against the war
and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. Through the mediums that speak
to our generationbmusic, film, poetry, spoken word, etc.bsoldiers and
civilians can come together, united in their commitment to end the war,
and freely exchange ideas and strategies. As the Iraq war slogs through
its fifth year, the need for innovative collaborations between anti-war
soldiers and civilians has never been more apparent.
