Retracting Harness Problem

I'm trying to fix a problem with a 1989 Mercury Cougar LS. One of the
automatic seatbelts, (passenger side), will not close up for the shoulder
harness to function properly. Before it stopped functioning, there were
periods when it opened and closed while driving...mostly when small bumps
were driven over. Just before it stopped functioning, it would open and in
order to close it, I would move the window glass in that particular door up
or down a half inch or so...which corrected the problem for a while. Now,
the automatic seatbelt will not close up for the shoulder harness to work.
The seatbelt light and the door ajar light are both lit on the instrument
panel but the door is securely closed. The interior dome light plunger
appears to work on this door, (the interior dome light goes on when the door
is opened and it goes off when the door is shut). I was hoping someone could
give me some idea of where the control or sensor for the retractable
shoulder belt is so I might try to correct this problem. Also looking for
any ideas on how to fix it.
Thank you.

You've got an intermittent connection to the unit.  The plug from the
motor to the track unit is located on the back side of the door.  There
is also a switch that looks similar to your door plunger that turns the
motor off once it reaches the "back" position - the belt track gets to
that point and depresses the switch.  I would start with taking a look
at those connections and that switch, and also connections to/from the
motor which drives the track.  I believe the motor would be located
generally behind the right rear passenger armrest.  Hopefully digging
into there will yield an answer.

In general, these things are notorious in Fords of this general age.
I've had two of them, one a Cougar.  In my Tempo, it simply wore out,
and wouldn't retract all the way.  I ended up replacing the driver's
side unit with a take-out from a junkyard wreck in otherwise good shape.
Ford doesn't manufacture these any more.  If you did find a new one,
it would be pricey - about $750 or so, with the labor to replace it.  My
used one didn't last a year.  What I did (driver's side) was to slide
the belt along the track manually all the way to the "back" position,
and just unplugged the bugger.  It stays firmly in place.  I have to
sling it over myself when I get in the car, but it works, and passes
safety inspection.  I don't care about it; your passengers may not like
it, but it's the cheapest solution.

Best of luck...

So how do you unplug the bugger?  I cannot stand the annoying noise my
seatbelt makes whenever I open the door and the seatbelt gets stuck,
please help me!
Thanks You
Jason

I know, it drove me crazy, too.

Shut the door, make sure it's fully in the "back" position, then uplug
the car battery.

Open the door, and take off the plastic door paneling.  The plug from
the motor to the track unit is located on the back side of the door.  It
should be fairly obvious which one it is.  One side will have a plunger
switch, which can be easily removed, and the other will have an actual
plug to an electrical source.  Use a screwdriver to get the remove the
clip/plug.   Don't leave any hot wires lying around, since it can be
actuated without the car running.

ok now I'm going to sound really stupid, but how do you unplug the battery,
I mean is there a certain order to remove the caps, and how do I remove
them? And what do you mean the back side of the door?
Thanks Man

Asking questions never makes you stupid.  Wanting to do things yourself
certainly makes you smart.  Not asking, and then screwing things up
makes you stupid.

For the battery, remove the terminal that has the heavy, black cable
connected to it, and then make sure it's out of the way, and won't make
contact accidentally.

The back side of the door... my fault, what I meant was the b-pillar,
the section just BEHIND the door, and just in front of the rear window.

If I had a website I'd post a pic of the area I'm talking about...

I take that back... learning stuff on your own and screwing up is ok, so
long as you admit it, especially when you are self-installing automatic
transmission shift kits.

hey man
okay so I dont think the email thing worked
but its at yahoo.  Also I was wondering if you can kind of explain more
what I'm supposed to disconnect in the door and how to do it?  And you
said don't leave any loose wires, will I need electrical tape or anything?

I am about to send you four pics.

#1 is the b pillar
#2 is the plug you should remove
#3 is one end of it, close up
#4 is the other end of it, close up

I will send them in separate emails with some text descriptions.
2 megapixel res. for email, but it'll do...

Check it again.

Take a look at the pic of the plug / switch I sent you, then find it in
your car once you get the panelling off.  All I meant was to make sure
you remove it rather than leaving it in there, unplugged.  You won't
need to tape anything.

The whole operation took me 15 minutes.  It's really not that big of a
deal.  Let me know how you do.
