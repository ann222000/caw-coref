In 2004, Black people voted 89 percent for the Democratic presidential
candidate and 10 percent for Bush. Some pundits argue that the
Democratic Party is the best hope for African-Americans, given the
chilling Right Wing bent of Republicans. But some of the nation's most
respected civil rights leaders say the faithfulness of Black voters is
not rewarded by Democrats and not desired by Republicans.

What I always find amusing is that many hyphenates hold up Tiger Woods
as a role model, and I do consider him to be a great human being, but they
seem to forget that Tiger is the second generation in his family to make it
very clear that no hyphenate woman is good enough for them to marry.

Tiger Woods is black?  I always thought him to be Thai or maybe Asian.

Tiger calls himself &quot;a Cablinasian&quot;

TIGER WOODS' REJECTION OF ORTHODOX RACIAL CLASSIFICATIONS POINTS THE WAY
TO A FUTURE WHERE RACE WILL NO LONGER DEFINE US.

BY GARY KAMIYA

it was one of those peculiar, almost farcical moments that
occasionally arise in the turgid melodrama of American racial politics.
After Tiger Woods won the Masters Tournament, the media went into a
veritable orgy of racial sentimentality. The 21-year-old golf phenom was
touted as the Great Black Hope, the putter-wielding equivalent of Martin
Luther King Jr. Pundits waxed poetic about the cosmic social significance of
Woods' feat, and those treacly &quot;I am Tiger Woods&quot; ads seemed to gain
complete control of the airwaves. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary
celebrations of Jackie Robinson's breaking of baseball's color line -- an
event of unimaginably greater significance -- Woods' coronation as the Black
Prince of the Country Club gave America a chance to engage in its favorite
ritual, the recitation of warm (if not Fuzzy) racial platitudes. While
blacks celebrated the triumph of one of their own in a lily-white sport,
whites wiped away tears and congratulated themselves on their remarkable
progress. The choreographed racial minuet was proceeding as smoothly as a
30-second Nike spot.

And then Tiger Woods said he wasn't actually &quot;black&quot; at all -- he was
&quot;Cablinasian.&quot;

Woods made his remarks on &quot;Oprah,&quot; when he was asked if it bothered
him to be called an African-American. &quot;It does,&quot; he said. &quot;Growing up, I
came up with this name: I'm a 'Cablinasian.'&quot; As in
Caucasian-black-Indian-Asian. Woods has a black father (or to be precise, if
I am interpreting Woods' reported ancestry correctly, a half-black,
one-quarter American Indian, one-quarter white father) and a Thai mother
(or, with the same caveat, a half-Thai, half-Chinese mother). &quot;I'm just who
I am,&quot; Woods told Oprah Winfrey, &quot;whoever you see in front of you.&quot;

But just &quot;who I am&quot; remained contested ground. According to Time
magazine, Woods' coming out as a Cablinasian caused &quot;a mini-racial firestorm
... Woods' remarks infuriated many African Americans who ... see him as a
traitor ... Some blacks saw Woods' assertion of a multiracial identity as a
sellout that could touch off an epidemic of 'passing.'&quot; Light-skinned Colin
Powell, responding to Woods' comments, &quot;In America, which I love from the
depths of my heart and soul, when you look like me, you're black.&quot;

Adding fuel to the fire stirred up by Woods' comments are their
political implications. Congress is considering adding a multiracial
category to the 2000 census, and supporters of the controversial new
category immediately seized upon Woods' statement as evidence that the old
categories -- black, white, Asian and Pacific Islander, native American and
&quot;other&quot; -- are inadequate. Civil rights groups like the NAACP, who are
bitterly opposed to adding the multiracial category because they fear it
will lead to a loss of black political and economic clout, are not likely to
enjoy the spectacle of Woods becoming a poster child for multiracialism.

I'm not putting forward Tiger Woods as a role model, racial or
otherwise. I don't know anything about him, except that he seems to respect
both of his parents, is an athletic prodigy who is a masterful
self-marketer, and is given to telling dumb black-men-have-big-dicks jokes
in slick men's magazines. But whoever Woods may be, his refusal to be
pigeonholed into a single racial category points the way out of the
dualistic rigidity and emotional hysteria that has led America into a racial
impasse. By choosing to embrace all of who he is -- an entity for which
there is no name, except one that sounds like a tribe from the imaginary
country of Narnia -- Woods, the goofy 21-year-old with the golden-brown skin
and the beautiful swing, has become a messenger for a larger truth: Our race
does not make us who we are.

In our hearts, we all know this. It is a truth written in American
blood by Martin Luther King Jr. and enunciated by every great world
religious tradition. But it is a truth that only whites have traditionally
been allowed to enjoy. The bitter legacy of white racism in America denied
blacks the freedom to define themselves independently of their color.
Because whites saw blacks as being black before they saw them as being human
beings, blacks were forced to embrace what should have been an irrelevancy,
forced to erect a protective ideology upon the accident of their skin color.

That reaction was inevitable. Negritude, Afrocentrism, Black Pride and
other manifestations of identity politics are all understandable ideologies,
but they are -- or should be -- provisional. Like booster rockets, they
should fall away once they have carried their passengers out of the heavy
atmosphere in which white judgment debilitates.

To understand the shortcomings of Black Pride, one need only look at
its mirror version, White Pride. Whites who are obsessed with their racial
identity are either pathological Aryan Nation outsiders lurking around in
the woods, or confused camp-followers of multiculturalism, seeking to find
specious Caucasian &quot;roots&quot; just as they enviously imagine people of color
have found theirs. In either case, their racialist ideology is an attempt to
fill a void that cannot and should not be filled -- because that void is the
space of human freedom. Exactly to the degree that race comes to constitute
one's identity, one is unfree. White Pride followers are like 12-step
zombies who, despairing of living with the anxiety that accompanies freedom,
have handed their identities over to a Higher Caucasian Power. And their
black counterparts trap themselves in a similar cul-de-sac.

Defenders of black racialism respond that one cannot compare black
racial affirmation with its white counterpart, since one group is powerless
and one is powerful. (The extreme version of this argument is that blacks
cannot be racists.) But this response locks blacks in a permanently reactive
stance, enshrining victimhood as their defining characteristic. In an act of
world-class paternalism, Rep. Maxine Waters commented that advocates of a
mixed-race category &quot;want to be seen for all they are, but I don't think
they're making the connection about how it could affect how they're
represented, or who's being an advocate for them when they get mistreated.&quot;
It apparently didn't occur to her that these not-so-tragic-mulattoes might
have different opinions about the dangers of &quot;mistreatment.&quot;

The case of Woods reveals the central stupidity of American racial
politics: the discrepancy between the rigid way we talk about race and the
fluid realities of who we increasingly are. Part of the changed reality is
the rising number of mixed-race people like Woods, who demand and deserve
their own census classification. But part of it is also found within
Americans of all races.

Despite the persistence of bigotry, I believe that white Americans are
far more racially enlightened than ever before. Yes, there are differences
between the races -- differences of class, culture, upbringing, history. But
the polite, orthodox approach to black-white relations, enshrined in
&quot;diversity training&quot; exaggerates those differences and makes genuine
communication all but impossible. Whites have grown enormously weary of the
formal, repetitive, go-nowhere black-white two-step. They desperately want a
signal from blacks that they, too, have had it with trying to communicate
through six panes of multicultural glass.

So where does Tiger Woods fit into all this? First of all, it's
important to point out that Woods did not repudiate blacks or blackness. He
paid tribute to the black golfers who came before him, and he embraced his
black father. What he repudiated was one of America's founding and most
traumatic racial myths -- the one-drop rule, according to which anyone
possessing even a trace of black blood was -- and to some degree, still
is -- considered black.

I am not calling for blacks, or any other group, to recant their pride
in who they are. Nor am I suggesting that those who identify as black,
whatever their ancestry (most American blacks are of mixed race) should
follow Woods' example. The worst thing that could happen would be if
mixed-race people entered into the racial spoils system, competing for
victim status with other minorities. The point is not that people should
flee from who they are, but that, as far as possible, they should be allowed
to create who they are. Everyone should be allowed to choose
