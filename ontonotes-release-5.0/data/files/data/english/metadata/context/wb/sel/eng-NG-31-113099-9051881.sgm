Aluminum melts at a temperature much lower than would allow for the orange
color of the molten metal seen dripping out of the south tower. When
aluminum melts, it is still silvery. This is basic basic physics, yo. What
we observe coming out of the south tower looks exactly like a thermite
reaction which produces molten iron (the main component of structural
steel.) You all are getting VERY desperate, that much is clear.

check out the following from 911fraud.blogspot.com, which has a great
summary of the case against Bush/PNAC/Silverstein:

Watch this video of thermite melting through a car's engine block. Note the
almost lava-like effect. Thermite is part iron oxide (powder) so when it's
ignited, you essentially have liquid metal.

Now watch this video footage of what looks like thermite pouring out of a
wound in the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Note the distinct
difference between it and the larger conventional fire to it's above left.
If this were an electrical fire, the sparks would fizzle out almost
immediately but they don't. The fire burns intensely and incessantly as what
appear to be sparks or droplets of liquid metal fall far and away from it,
still burning an almost white color, indicating that the fuel source is not
used up. It looks as if it's raining lava.

Also look up Steven Jones' paper. He is a physics professor from BYU and no
one has debunked his paper.

Mahmoud Abbas has to stay home. As things stand right now, he must
not go to Washington. Even his meetings with Ehud Olmert are gradually
turning into a disgrace and have become a humiliation for his people.
Nothing good will come of them. It has become impossible to bear the
spectacle of the Palestinian leader's jolly visits in Jerusalem,
bussing the cheek of the wife of the very prime minister who is
meanwhile threatening to blockade a million and a half of his people,
condemning them to darkness and hunger.

If Abu Mazen were a genuine national leader instead of a petty
retailer, he would refuse to participate in the summit and any other
meetings until the blockade of Gaza is lifted. If he were a man of
truly historic stature he would add that no conference can be held
without Ismail Haniyeh, another crucial Palestinian representative.
And if Israel really wanted peace, not only an &quot;agreement of
principles&quot; with a puppet-leader that will lead nowhere, it should
respect Abbas' demand. Israel should aspire for Abu Mazen to be
considered a leader in the eyes of his people, not only a marionette
whose strings are pulled by Israel and the United States, or affected
by other short-term power plays.

Right now power rests with the powerless Abu Mazen. Since Washington -
and perhaps Jerusalem as well - badly want the photo-op otherwise
known as a &quot;peace summit&quot; to show off an &quot;achievement,&quot; Abu Mazen
could and should threaten to boycott the meeting to try and force some
achievement on behalf of his people. Palestinians live in Gaza, too -
an area controlled by Hamas, which Abu Mazen so loathes: He cannot
continue to ignore the inhumane conditions in which Gazans live, caged
in by Israel.

But the impression Abu Mazen makes is that he's no more than a
political survivor. He's participating in the American-Israeli masked
ball not because of naivete or weakness - for him, Gaza is just as
&quot;hostile territory&quot; as Israel is. Therefore, he shares a shameful
common interest with Israel, which will do neither side any good.
Judging by his behavior Abu Mazen not only doesn't object to what
Israel is doing in Gaza, he may even agree with the twisted doctrine
arguing that cruel pressure will subdue Hamas and return the people to
Fatah's embrace. In so doing, Abu Mazen proves that he's no &quot;downy
chick,&quot; as Ariel Sharon once put it, but a cynical rooster who cares
little for the welfare of his people.

A genuine peace conference should involve all the hawks. Peace is
forged between bitter enemies. The question of whether Saudi Arabia
will take part in the summit or not is futile unless it includes real
Palestinian representation. At most Abu Mazen represents only half of
his people and could achieve, at best, half an agreement that wouldn't
survive anyhow, given Hamas' strong opposition. It is in the interests
of all the parties involved, including Abu Mazen, to drag Hamas to the
negotiation table. A peace conference without Hamas and without Syria
is a joke. But the short-sighted coalition of the royal triumvirate,
Jerusalem-Washington-Ramallah, is trying to promote a false vision of
&quot;peace talks&quot; without the decisive partners, while the world is busy
applauding this illusion.

Obviously, it is hard to expect from Abu Mazen that he will rise above
his narrow interests and call for an invitation to be issued to Hamas,
the party that was democratically elected to lead the Palestinian
government. But the least one could expect from the person with the
lofty title of &quot;President of the Palestinian Authority&quot; is to strive
for the greater good of all his people, especially in light of the
extent of their distress. But instead of acting to bring about a
cessation of hostilities and opening Gaza to the world, the
triumvirate is busy formulating yet another position paper that won't
be worth the paper it's written on and that will soon find itself in
the garbage bin of history, along with its predecessors. It will only
serve to impose increasingly cruel hardships on the people of Gaza.
Abu Mazen must not participate in this farce.
