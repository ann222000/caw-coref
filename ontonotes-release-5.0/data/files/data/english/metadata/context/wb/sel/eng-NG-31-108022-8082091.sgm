Chino Latino Seafood Sausage
Recipe By: Brian
Published in: Top Chef

SAUSAGE:
1 Corvina Seabass or any other Seabass (1/2&quot; cubed)
1/2 pounds  Black Tiger Shrimp
1/2 pounds  Scallops
1 tablespoons Garlic chopped
1 tablespoons Ginger chopped
1 bunch Green Onion  chopped
1 bunch Cilantro  chopped
1/2 cup Vegetable Oil
1 tablespoons Sesame Oil
2 tablespoons Red Wine Vinaagarette
2 tablespoons Soy Sauce

SWEET CHILI GLAZE:
1 cup Sambal Chili Paste
1 cup Honey
1/2 cup Red Wine Vinegar
2 tablespoons Corn Starch
2 tablespoons Water

JICAMA SLAW:
1 piece Jicama  Peeled -- Julienned
1 piece Red Bell Pepper  Julienned
1 piece Carrot Peeled  Julienned
1/2 bunch Cilantro  chopped

GINGER VINAIGRETTE:
1/2 cup Shallots
1/2 cup Ginger peeled
1/2 bunch Cilantro
1/4 cup Sriracha
1 cup Canola Oil
2 tablespoons Soy Sauce
1 tablespoons Sesame Oil
1/4 cup Red Wine Vinegar

For the Sausage: Combine all ingredients, except seabass, in Robo
Coupe and Pulse until smooth. Form patties or pipe onto plastic wrap
and form links.
I saw Lee Ann Wong make this dish after forming the sausage in
plastic wrap she  poached them  and then cooled in an ice bath.

For the Sweet Chili Glaze: Combine water and corn starch until
smooth. Combine the first 3 ingredients in a small sauce pot and
bring to a boil. Whisk in the cornstarch slurry and boil for 3
minutes. If this is too hot add more honey. If you like the glaze to
be hotter add more sambal. If you like it thicker, add more slurry.
Brush the sausage with the sweet chili glaze during BBQing.

For the Jicama Slaw: Combine all.

For the Ginger Vinaigrette: Combine all but canola oil in a blender.
Slowly drizzle in oil with blender on high. Combine with slaw.

For Plate up: Serve the sausage with the jicama slaw on the side.
