Ist post -
so HI Y'all!
I am REALLY in a jam -
Always had trouble going into reverse - 1st gear, engage slightly, then
try reverse again and it would usually go
but NOW:
Whole damn shifting cable split right outta the rubber sleeve.
Am so NEW to this, please accept me in spite of my very low and quite
limited understanding?
OK.
so - there are 2 shift cables out from between both sides of the fire
wall, one sheathed in black, the other red.
Black one split out, now will not even engage at all.  Interior side, we
(2 of us on this project - plus the misssing neighbor mechanic that got us
started!!!)
we took apart the console, exposed under shifter boot to see same 2
cables: as must replace the black one:
HOW TO DISCONNECT from console area?
Figure we need to replace the split one, at the very least - and carry
thru to the grommets, as there are 2 along further on the same line that
are too loose.
ALSO: The shift lever mechanism no longer moves freely -
ARE THERE yellow plastic guiders or something that should be there?
Because we  have found 1/2 inch or so pieces of soft broken yellow plastic
thingys (excuse me)
that were under the stuff in the gear box area. Seems way too flimsy for
serious clutch stuff, but I know nothing except what I now see to report,
my trusty Chilton's manual is not helping with this aspect of repair
: (
Guess that's it for now:
Except that I am second owner, drove this car solo X-country several times
- 40 MPG at 75 MPH between AZ and NJ, once upon a time, a long long time
ago...
Thanking Greatly in advance,
Desperately,
~ DAZIE ~       ; )
(PS: horticulture and biology my usual gigs, kindly consider
this if you might want to reply - techno dialect will send me to wish for
a new roller skate key)

The shift cables should come as a set.  Pretty much follow and unbolt as
necessary.  I don't think it requires pulling the dash, but I don't think
it's easy, either.

I've got little idea about the stuff on the tranny.  I'd put the cables on
first and see if it's better.  The frayed cable won't want to compress and
could be causing a problem.

Thank you for your response, TechGuy!
The plot thickens:
I have found the schematic online, following a link I found in this
message board (THANX CREW!)-
And am feeling somewhat satisfied in having removed (90% removed) nearly
the entire length of these 2 cables myself.

But Here's the Latest:
(Again - not knowing proper tech or even tool or hardware names, plz
forgive me):
From the engine side, I am left with only one spot (on both cables) to
disconnect.

Up from the trans, the cables connect there with grommets, (Both were
herniated, sort-of) and then, before the springy looking thingy (short
rubber accordian), there is a 2 part clip (upper and lower) that holds the
cables in place(?) and it is there that I am now stuck: I CAN NOT dislodge
this clip from the lines! They are sort of square, about 1" (one inch
square) &amp; thin like a washer, with a "U" shape out that the cable rests
in, and a ledge type bent over part (to grip &amp; remove?) at the top.

I have added "WD-40" several times over a couple days now, and this thing
just will not budge.

Is there a special tool to use other than prying with a screwdriver, or
pulling up and out with pliers?

On the interior side (drivers side with clutch handle lever area) at  the
farthest other end of the cables, there were soft yellow plastic parts in
this same general area - they were broken, BTW, and were very easy to
push-pull apart and out; but on the engine side - altho not rusted, is
very permanent-looking...

I can supply link to tech-sketch for more detail if needed.

ALSO - I forget where now, but I saw another of the same type metal clip
with a gripper ledge in another area of the engine. I was literally
crouched down inside the engine compartment at the time, hoping that a
closer angle might give me better leverage for yanking at this clip.

Something tells me that 1) Either it aint budging NEVER! or 2) There must
be a Trick, a Tool, or a Technique that I must learn.

I will do whatever it takes - the NEW from the dealer cables cost nearly
$200. but I hope to find 'em used for less than $100.

Admittedly, I am feeling somewhat discouraged. ((and my dear BF is moving
the first of May = no more "Can I catch a ride to..." ))  poor poor meeee

You can try to get the clip off using a LARGE screwdriver/pry bar and
twisting.  Also, sometimes, they can be grabbed with diagonals (wire
cutters).  Basically, anything you can think of which may work is worth a
try.

INDEED!
Thank you, My soon to be X-BF was able to get both of those clips off,
finally!
Next will be to disengage them from the firewall itself.
Seems to me to be a rubber looking cushiony center, where both cables go
thru a plate secured by 2 bolts.

In other words, we plan to remove the old, and replace it.

Dear BF is outta here by the First of May...
Lots of details in my life will change at that time, including mt missing
his strength - sometimes brute force may be needed to budge stubborn
thingys.

Thank You, Mr Hyndaitech, your help is Greatly Appreciated!

Expect the flange on the firewall to be bolted on-- either from the inside
or the outside.
