Hi,

Please recommend a yeast for my barleywine. It's an extract batch.
Calls for:

6.6 lbs amber malt extract
6 lbs light dme
20 hbu galena (boil)
1 oz willamette (finish)

The recipe calls for dry champagne yeast, but I'm not sure I want to
use that. The one I used for mead ferments up to 18%. I'm thinking that
10-12% would be more appropriate.

thanks,

jon

Personally I wouldn't use a champagne yeast, it's going to give you some
flavors that aren't really appropriate for a beer.  It's also not really
necessary.  There used to be a school of thought that beer yeast wasn't
capable of higher ABV fermentations (it may have been true at some point
in the past), but it's not really the case today.  I would guess that
the recipe you found is a fairly old one, or written by a brewer with
some outdated information.

IMO, any general beer yeast should do fine.  Nottingham is a pretty
popular choice as a dry yeast for ales in general.  The Safale options
would probably work fine as well.

Assuming the amber is LME and you're making a 5 gallon batch, you're going
to end up with an OG around 1.100 or so.  IMO, you will definitely want to
make sure you aerate really well and probably pitch a couple packets of
dry yeast (they're fairly cheap).  Ideally, you could make a regular beer
and then use the sediment from that fermentation to pitch in to your
barleywine.  That should give you a really large/healthy yeast population.

I have never re-pitched before, but as it turns out I have a rauchbier
fermenting right now. I used wyeast american ale yeast. I think I've
read about racking the fermented beer off the yeast cake and putting
wort in there.

I figure I could bottle my rauchbier and then cook up the barleywine
the same day, and run the wort through my chiller onto the yeast. The
only things that concern me are sanitation and the fact that there is
always a little bit of the previous beer on top of the yeast cake when I
rack to my bottling bucket.

Any problems with this? Is this a reasonable thing to do, and how would
I maintain a sanitary carboy after I rack the rauchbier?

Thanks much!

You've got the procedure right, the only thing I'd think twice about is
what was in your rauchbier recipe?  I'd be a little worried that some
notes of the smokiness might carry over.  It should be subtle, if it does
at all.  Maybe that's not a bad thing?

If you're worried about it, you don't need to re-pitch.  Just use a couple
fresh packets and you should be OK.

Sanitation shouldn't be a problem.  Just cover the carboy with foil or
something between bottling the rauchbier and brewing the barleywine.  There
shouldn't be any significant risk, it should maintain it's sanitation.

I'm going to give this a try! I wouldn't mind a teeny bit of smoke in
my barleywine, but I don't think I would notice. This is a batch I plan
to sit on for a while. Thanks again for your advice!
