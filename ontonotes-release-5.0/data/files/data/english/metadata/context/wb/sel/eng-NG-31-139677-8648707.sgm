Is there a tool to ferret out meshes that no longer have clothing/objects
attached to them. I've been on a deleting spree and I just thought - oops, I
wasn't taking any precautions not to end up with abandoned meshes.

There was a program that was supposed to do that at MTS2 a while back.  We
discussed it in here and I went and got it.  It showed a whole boatload of
&quot;orphaned&quot; files, but when I started looking at them, I recognized a lot of
them that were indeed still in my game and usable.  So I just uninstalled it
and forgot about it.  It didn't work very well.  I did go back and tell the
creator about my experience with it, but I honestly don't remember who it
was or what the name of the program was or is she ever fixed it.  Maybe
someone else can remember better?

Was that the one by Delphy? Delphy's Download Organizer, or something
like that.
Simpe also does scan for orphaned meshes, I think, as one of the options
on the file scanner plugin. I just can't remember which one it is, and
if you have BV, of course, Simpe may or may not work.

Thanks. I didn't know that about SimPE. Given I haven't yet found (let alone
downloaded) anything for BV I should be fine just running it through my
downloads folder.

Thanks again to both of you.

Now if only I could tell what an unattached mesh should look like when SimPE
is used - surely not everything that comes up in that list is unattached -
is it?

There's that thing that JFade is developing - he keeps mentioning it at
MATY.  I don't know how far he's got with it but you could try a look at his
site.  I thought there was also a plugin for SimPE along those lines (don't
ask me what it is).  It's an issue that several modders have had a go at
(and not succeeded).  I'm guessing it will never be nailed.

I'm just about to put back CC into BV - I want to remove a lot of CC,
especially jewellery.  I know I can convert it but I have decided to use
this as an excuse for a fresh start and a sort out.  I'm going to be doing
it manually, I'm afraid.  Put stuff in, check it's showing properly etc. to
find the meshes and textures.  I'm thinking I might store stuff in Downloads
in a different manner.  I had all the meshes separately in a folder but I
think I might sub-folder everything with it's mesh.

Best wishes

For some reason meshes do not like to be in a different folder than the
recolors.
This in not always true but it does seem so in some cases.
I guess that it is for the same reason that it is hard for moders to make a
program to sort orphaned meshes.

This does indeed appear to be one of the problems but there are other
problems with the addressing-system used with the files.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there a tool to ferret out meshes that no longer have

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I just thought - oops, I wasn't taking any precautions not to end up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with abandoned meshes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There was a program that was supposed to do that at MTS2 a while
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back. We discussed it in here and I went and got it.  It showed a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whole boatload of &quot;orphaned&quot; files, but when I started looking at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them, I recognized a lot of them that were indeed still in my game
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and usable. So I just uninstalled it and forgot about it.  It didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work very well. I did go back and tell the creator about my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experience with it, but I honestly don't remember who it was or what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the name of the program was or is she ever fixed it.  Maybe someone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; else can remember better?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Was that the one by Delphy? Delphy's Download Organizer, or something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like that.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Simpe also does scan for orphaned meshes, I think, as one of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; options on the file scanner plugin. I just can't remember which one it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is, and if you have BV, of course, Simpe may or may not work.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Simpe should still work with downloads.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It may or may not have problems reading the BV files.

&gt;&gt; It is not perfect but it will give you a clue as to what to look for.
&gt;&gt; It just narrows the list down.

&gt; So, what, I scan the list for anything I'm sure I've deleted and hope I
&gt; don't get confused. *grah* They should have named it mesh scanner - not
&gt; _orphaned_ mesh scanner. Ah, well, the alternative is to dump the downloads
&gt; folder and start again - and I'm not feeling that masochistic.

I believe if you look at the 'health' column(I think that's what it's
called - it's been a while since I used it) it will give you some clue
as to which ones are unattached.
I think i'll run it myself later today and then I can (maybe!)give you
better info. :)
