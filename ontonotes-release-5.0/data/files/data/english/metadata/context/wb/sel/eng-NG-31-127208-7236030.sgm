This guy is as erratic as anybody.  I've seen him make good punts, but I've
seen make some pretty bad ones.  The punters still punting this weekend make
me want more.  But I know that isn't happening.

I agree.....he needs to go. We don't need middle of the road. We need
Grade A.

I say we focus all our energies on scoring and making first downs, thus
rendering the need for a punter moot.

The thing I love the most about Dirk is the way the mere mention of his
name elicits the most colorful and unrelenting rainbow of profanity
from JonA's mouth.

Other than that, he doesn't do much.  Time for an upgrade.

Apparently he will have some serious competition, the Eagles "Agreed to
terms. Nothing official yet and certainly nothing is guaranteed ..."

Shit, Trotter and Dawk may have competition too.  Imagine Reno who can
tackle and punt!

He won't get tossed like a ragdoll the way Akers did when he hit the Giants
on the sideline.  Imagine a punter who WANTS to hit people.  Although my
fear would be he says "to hell with punting I'm running this damn thing past
these sissy Americans with pads on."

Considering that in each of those clip kicks he has to take 8 or 9
steps before launching it, he'll get his chance to find out what
contact is.

Plus none of those pussy rugby players wieghs over 190lbs.

I agree. There is no faster game than the NFL. Big guys flying all over
place.It is ratcheted up a few notches. With that said....I hate
punters that look and act like faigs. Having a guy with balls punting
the ball would turn him into an instant cult hero in this town.

It worked for the Chargers when they brought over Darren Bennett....why
not give it a try?

Besides, putting him in pads might make him more fearless.....this
could be a lot of fun.

Being a classic cynical Mick, what I'd like to see is this brash young
Englishmen make the trek over the pond, underestimate exactly what he
has gotten himself into and try to chest tackle some little American
punt returner. Then I'd like to see him knocked out cold by one of
those little PRs. Then retire, head back to whereever the hell he came
from, extolling the virtues of staying the hell home and never fucking
around with an American sport again.

How many times do you garner media attention for a punter, much less fan
reaction.  No doubt on your last line.

First thing I thought of.  Eff it.  Any improvement at punter is nice.  JonA
wouldn't even be able to bitch.
