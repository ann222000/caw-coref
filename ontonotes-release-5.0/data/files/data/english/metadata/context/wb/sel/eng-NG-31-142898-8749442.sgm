There is no democracy in India

By Rajeev Srinivasan
Rediff
Monday, September 10, 2007

The usual suspects made the usual speeches on August 15,
mouthing the usual pure cant. But the sad fact remains that
60 years after the grasping imperialists left, India has
comprehensively under-achieved on all fronts; all that has
changed is the skin-colour of the looters.

Ten years ago, I was far more optimistic,
http://in.rediff.com/news/aug/04rajeev.htm
and wrote about the coming Indian century; today, despite
the obvious progress made on the economic front, I am
overwhelmed by a sense of disappointment.

I have been discouraged by what I have observed in the last
10 years. The loss of heritage. The disdain for indigenous
civilisation. The perversion of the discourse in the
country by Stalinist 'intellectuals'. The regular terrorist
attacks that cheapen Indian lives. The total non-reaction
by government to oppression of people of Indian origin
abroad.

And so I have come to realise that freedom is very
different from mere independence. There is no freedom for
the common man in India: not freedom from want, nor freedom
of expression or thought, nor freedom to aspire to
greatness, nor freedom from the ravages of endemic
corruption. The State is so feeble that India can fairly be
termed a failing State. The Indian State punches so far
below its weight that it might as well not exist.

The failure is both domestic and global. Individual Indians
are shackled, and the blunders of the past 60 years
conspire to create a state of permanent slavery for the
nation. That is the biggest disappointment of all: Indians
aspire to mediocrity. Indians simply cannot imagine that
they can recapture their historical primacy as the greatest
innovators, the most prosperous nation on earth.

The facts are out there for anyone to read: For instance,
economic historian Angus Maddison's World Economy: A
Millennial Perspective, an official European Union
publication, shows that during practically the entire
period 0-1700 CE India was the world's richest nation.
There is circumstantial evidence, too: The fact that every
barbarian, from Alexander the Macedonian, to sundry Central
Asians, to random Europeans, all invaded India. People
intent on loot do not invade poor countries.

India is on the way to economic superpower-dom, according
to the dramatic Goldman Sachs reports (Dreaming with BRICs
and India's Rising Growth Potential). And indeed, in the
last few years, the world has recognised that India will be
an engine of the Asian century, hyphenated with China
(much, incidentally, to the latter's chagrin).

But it is only foreigners who acknowledge India's
potential. Indians themselves are still colonised. Having
destroyed indigenous education, the colonialists put in
place a system designed to suppress creativity and produce
drones who would toil for the empire. It drums into the
minds of children the idea that everything native to India
is worthless.

This project has succeeded beyond Macaulay's wildest dreams
(see his infamous Minutes) in creating a nation of the
terminally confused. Exhibits A and B: India's finance
minister opined recently that India was always a poor
country; some time ago, his boss, the prime minister,
complimented imperialists on the good they did! Aren't
these people economists? All they have to do is to read
Great Victorian Holocausts: El Nino and the Making of the
Third World to understand the appalling war crime,
including the genocide of at least 20 million people,
perpetrated on India by the imperialists.

Yet, in an example of undeserved tolerance towards
rapacious foreigners, Indians shut their eyes to the
dangers of Economics 101: choosing to only make butter, and
no guns. We need guns to protect our butter. Thus the great
dangers in the sustained and inexplicable efforts recently
to make India for all intents and purposes a nuclear vassal
of the United States.

Brought up to believe they are worthless, Indians aspire to
be second-best. Only Indians go to the Olympics [Images] to
be sporting losers, not to win. Nobody else chants the
meaningless mantra that what matters is participation; no,
Virginia, the only thing that matters is winning. India
seeks to play second fiddle to somebody, be it Americans,
Chinese, Arabs -- somebody, anybody. This is a disease that
may have to be excised by large-scale lobotomies; or
perhaps by burning down a certain university that is its
epicentre.

India has been a hectoring busybody on the global stage,
lecturing everybody on morality and virtue. It is also easy
prey: A nation that can be induced to commit collective
suicide through the expedient of buying off its media and
politicians for chump change. The number of fifth-
columnists in India has reached record proportions. India
has 'friends of America', 'friends of China', 'friends of
Saudi Arabia', 'friends of the Vatican' in high places, but
hardly anyone is a friend of India.

Yes, there is formal independence, but there is no freedom.
There is, for instance, no respite from the State religion,
some baffling animal called 'secularism', which basically
means total apartheid against large groups of people.

The State excels in perpetuating the most ridiculous system
ever invented: A chimera that combines all the vices of
Communism and Capitalism and none of the virtues. The
idiocies and inefficiencies of the first and the thievery
and inequities of the second; but not the iron discipline
and will nor the unshackled flair for getting ahead. The
State has interfered in everything it has no business being
in: running airlines, hotels, and so forth; and it has been
practically invisible in everything it is the one and only
provider of: infrastructure, defence, social programs,
human rights. Crony capitalism and the license raj run
rampant.

The State has also failed to provide basic human
necessities: the infamous 'bread, clothing and shelter'
that every government has promised loudly but never
delivered. People in many parts of India are opting for
privatized education, water supply and road-maintenance --
fed up with State incompetence, indifference and
inefficiency, a testament to how badly the State has
performed.

It is obvious that wherever the State exited -- or never
interfered in, not realizing that here was yet another
opportunity to screw up royally -- the native genius of the
people has enabled India to thrive: for instance, in
telecommunications, in information technology.

The Indian State, in sum, is predatory. It preys on the
very people it is sworn and duty-bound to protect and
nurture.

Nor is there democracy in India, other than some strange
beast that has the paraphernalia and form, but not the
substance of rule of, by and for the people. Instead it is
of, by and for the brown sahib, who is only interested in
self-aggrandisement.

There is little to cheer about 60 years after power has
been grabbed by Macaulay's children, the said brown sahibs,
almost every one of them a crook willing to sell the
national interest down the river. They have perpetrated a
crime against humanity by preventing 400 million Indians
from climbing out of poverty and by creating a personality-
cult-ridden, corrupt, failing State.
