Assassinations in Kirkuk, a near-death of the minister of industry
(and actual deaths of his bodyguards) , the death of a GI and wounding
of another in a roadside bombing, were among the violent incidents in
Iraq on Thursday. Guerrillas also attacked a convoy of oil tankers , in
their continued quest to starve Baghdad of energy, and they killed two
clerics in the capital.

Another important labor union leader has been assassinated.

Iraq the Model: Iraqi journalists face jail time for writing
critically about their society. This NYT piece implies that a Kurdish
dissident journalist has been released after having been sentenced to 30
years for criticizing Kurdish warlord Massoud Barzani; as I understand
it, he is to be retried.

Reuters reports that some Iraqi Shiites and other observers believe
that the Bush administration is shifting away from its earlier alliance
with the Iraqi Shiites, preferring the Iraqi Sunni Arabs. The rationale
is said to be a dawning realization in Washington that the Iraqi Shiites
would not react positively to a US attack on Iran. Given the increasing
focus on Iran's nuclear energy program by Bush, his allies in the Iraqi
South are becoming increasing liabilities, given their own warm
relations with Tehran.

Al-Hayat [Ar.] reports that the military adviser to Jalal Talabani
reported that there had been contacts with the Iraqi guerrillas for the
purpose of increasing Iraqi security in all regions of Iraq. The
newspaper alleged that Iraqi clans of Anbar Province for the second day
continued a campaign against foreign fighters styling themselves
al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia, capturing 270 of them. The clans around Ramadi
are also said to have helped the Iraqi army capture 200 "terrorists."
(See Gilbert Achcar's translation from yesterday, below). The article
says that the clan leaders have also been talking to Sunni clerics,
preparing the way for talks between the Iraqi government, the US led
coalition, and guerrilla leaders as early as next week.

[Cole: I think Talabani's office is vastly exaggerating these
developments, and don't trust al-Hayat's editorial line on these alleged
conflicts within the guerrilla movement. Their articles on it read to me
as though they are attempting to convince themselves, and perhaps the
guerrillas, of this story. On the other hand, the story that the US
military will meet next week with guerrilla leaders is entirely
plausible. Such contacts are not new, and the question is whether they
will produce anything of value.]

Gen. Casey has admitted that the US army is stretched in Iraq.

Further pipeline sabotage and bad weather at Basra will keep Iraqi
exports to only about 1 million barrels a day for at least the next
month.

A new report says that the US will not be able to use the $18 bn
voted by Congress to complete water, sanitation and electricy projects
related to rebuilding Iraq. Reuters says, "Only 49 of 136 planned water-
and sanitation-related projects will be completed and only about 300 of
425 planned electricity-related projects." The article blames Saddam for
having run down Iraq but does not mention the role of stringent
US-backed international sanctions in degrading Iraqi society in the
1990s.
