I went the Sean Hannity Freedom Concert here in NJ on Sept. 11th.

It was a regular who's who of conservative speakers. Newt Gingrich and Rudy
Guiliani both spoke eloquently. The list of pundits who spoke was a
right-wingers dream. Mark Levin. Bob Grant. Curtis Sliwa. Laura Ingraham.
Elisabeth Hasselback. Oliver North. And, of course Ann Coulter!

Ann was the best, imo. She opened with this line &quot;How much do I love being
the in the presence of this many right-wingers?&quot;. (There were about 15,000
people there) She took an hysterical shot at Hillary. She set it up by
saying Hillary grew up in the era of &quot;equal rights for women&quot;, when women
were being told to write NASA because they too could be astronauts. Then she
said &quot;And I think Hillary would make a great astronaut, couldn't you see her
wearing a diaper and driving cross country to confront one of Bill's women?&quot;
I was rolling.

The concert itself was great. Lee Greenwood opened and had the whole crowd
singing &quot;God Bless The USA&quot;. Then Leann Rimes performed. Incredible is the
only word I can use to describe her voice. Recordings don't do it justice.
After hearing her live for the first time, I put her voice up there with
Streisand and Carpenter. It's that good.

The headliners were Montgomery-Gentry. The were great doing all their hits,
&quot;My Town&quot;, &quot;Hell Yeah&quot; and my favorite &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, an uplifting song if
there ever was one. Listen here -

This was the first time I went to one of these concerts. Sean Hannity has
been doing them for five years. I won't miss another.

The money pays for the college education of fallen and permanently disable
soldiers. It's encouraging to see all the people out there who love America
and want to support the troops and their families. If you get the chance to
go next year, I highly recommend you do.

I really think Hannity would make a great V.P.  Thompson/Hannity ticket.

Cool! I would never go to one, but was wondering what a whole show would be
like. I actually wish Ann Coulter would come to speak at one of the colleges
in the area. I'd go. I actually sort of like her. (Did I ever mention my
theory that she and Alice Cooper are related? Don't laugh. Check out a photo
of both of them side-by-side sometime!)

TC, I'm as Republican as they come.  I know where the mortgage gets
paid.

That said...this lineup, including the host.

Great People and leaders - 2
Good People but not a leader - 1
Good People - serious influence - 1
Average People getting a check for who knows why - 2
Not so nice People whose opinion should be meaningless - 3
Terrible person, total moron and a disgrace to the party - 1

I'm glad it was for a worthy cause because otherwise it's not where I'd
have put my green.

No, I won't mention names.

I would NEVER vote for a Democrat, because the true strength of moving an
agenda is in having control of the houses in Congress. Even if a certain Dem
isn't as bad as some other Dem, the fact they would control the agenda is
enough for me to NEVER vote for a Democrat.

If the Dems didn't control Congress right now, we wouldn't have to be
putting up with the charade they are currently engaging in in terms of the
war in Iraq. And Lieberman is a good example, if he wasn't caucusing with
the Dems, the Dems wouldn't have control of the Senate.

It's important to have control even if that control is accomplished through
the likes of Snowe and Chaffee.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; TC, I'm as Republican as they come.  I know where the mortgage gets
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; paid.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That said...this lineup, including the host.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Great People and leaders - 2
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Good People but not a leader - 1
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Good People - serious influence - 1
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Average People getting a check for who knows why - 2
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Not so nice People whose opinion should be meaningless - 3
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Terrible person, total moron and a disgrace to the party - 1

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm glad it was for a worthy cause because otherwise it's not where
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'd
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have put my green.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No, I won't mention names.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ;-)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; All I care about is they are on *my* side. All of them.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; TC

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; TC, my friend, I am one of the &quot;consummate insiders&quot; as you know.  They
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are not all &quot;on your side&quot;.  You may think so and they want you to do
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; so
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but they aren't.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Depends on your definition of &quot;on your side&quot;. I'm sure none of them are
&gt; &gt;&gt; voting Democrat. Anyone who doesn't vote Democrat is on my side.

&gt; &gt;&gt; TC

&gt; &gt; TC, you wouldn't have voted for Scoop Jackson, Joe Lieberman, etc.
&gt; &gt; because they were/are &quot;Democrats?&quot;  On the other hand, you would vote
&gt; &gt; for Olympia Snowe etc. because they are &quot;Republicans?&quot;

&gt; &gt; The aisles blur, my friend.  Up and down votes in the Senate, and the
&gt; &gt; House, rarely turn out to be strictly party line.

&gt; I would NEVER vote for a Democrat, because the true strength of moving an
&gt; agenda is in having control of the houses in Congress. Even if a certain Dem
&gt; isn't as bad as some other Dem, the fact they would control the agenda is
&gt; enough for me to NEVER vote for a Democrat.
">

Absent a veto proof level majority, the political reality is that
neither party ever really controls Congress to the extent you believe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If the Dems didn't control Congress right now, we wouldn't have to be

&gt; the Dems, the Dems wouldn't have control of the Senate.

Would the results though, of the Senate's actions, be any different?
They really would not.  Elections are won and lost....both on the
&quot;staged&quot; politics of the spin scheduled for each day and the practical
politics of the reasoned minds of the real leaders and the majority from
both sides of the Congressional aisles. One quarter of both sides of the
Congressional aisles are true believers/ideologues.  The other half,
really, are in the vast middle and could form their own party if they
wanted to do so.  Thank goodness there are cooler heads on both sides
like Lieberman and Snowe.  Those who foam at the mouth, be they Democrat
or Republican, set the process back, not advance it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I agree that control is important but if you can't move a practical
agenda because of them, control really means very little other than
agenda setting and who gets blamed for doing nothing.  Case in point,
look how bad the President's poll numbers are now and compare them to
how worse Congresses are.  Control sure helps the Democrats there,
doesn't it.  Be grateful, right now, that the Republicans aren't in
control because if one party had the responsibility for those kinds of
numbers....we would, most probably, be looking at a Reaganesque
watershed election again, and if the Republicans were in current control
with those numbers....it wouldn't look too good for our side.  Now, we
have a pretty decent chance of regaining at least one house and maybe
convert guys like Heath Shuler while they are still political neophytes.

I disagree with most of this but don't really have time to respond in whole
right now.

I don't think &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;middle of the road&quot; solves anything. It only
pushes many issues off into the future, see: the coming bankruptcy of Social
Security, which was nothing but a Ponzi scheme to being with. Also, there is
no middle of the road when it comes to a lot of issues. Like abortion. And
gay marriage.

Suffice to say, I think my town, my state, my country and my world would all
be better off if a hard-right agenda were put in place. I'd rather have
nothing happening on a Republican watch and not have to put up with the
Democrats nonsense.

TC, I like you. You're a good guy and a lot of fun here.  What you are
saying though puts you in the &quot;sheep&quot; category, just like the vast
numbers of teachers who are in the Democratic camp for equally blind
reasons.

I have earned a good life, in large part, by serving the interests of
the Republican Party as a loyal member....with homage paid to a select
group of Democratic clients.  At the same time, however, the ideologues
really are not respected by the vast majorities of both parties with
whom they serve alongside on the Hill.  You should hear the jokes that
solid, Democrats of conscience, say about the likes of Franken and
Miller.  The same goes for Republicans about the likes of Rush and
O'Reilly.  Congresspersons of both parties, who take their jobs
seriously and with due diligence, pay lip service to the buffoons while
using them, and those who blindly follow, for whatever they need to get
good government established or bad government dismantled.

Trust me, as many Dems and Repubs dislike their extremes within their
own parties as they do the others

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; TC, I'm as Republican as they come.  I know where the mortgage
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; gets
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; paid.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That said...this lineup, including the host.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'd
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have put my green.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No, I won't mention names.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ;-)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; All I care about is they are on *my* side. All of them.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; TC

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; TC, my friend, I am one of the &quot;consummate insiders&quot; as you know.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; They
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are not all &quot;on your side&quot;.  You may think so and they want you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; do
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; so
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but they aren't.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Depends on your definition of &quot;on your side&quot;. I'm sure none of them
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; voting Democrat. Anyone who doesn't vote Democrat is on my side.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; TC

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; TC, you wouldn't have voted for Scoop Jackson, Joe Lieberman, etc.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because they were/are &quot;Democrats?&quot;  On the other hand, you would
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; vote
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for Olympia Snowe etc. because they are &quot;Republicans?&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The aisles blur, my friend.  Up and down votes in the Senate, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; House, rarely turn out to be strictly party line.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I would NEVER vote for a Democrat, because the true strength of moving
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; agenda is in having control of the houses in Congress. Even if a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; certain
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Dem
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; isn't as bad as some other Dem, the fact they would control the agenda
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; enough for me to NEVER vote for a Democrat.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Absent a veto proof level majority, the political reality is that
&gt;&gt; &gt; neither party ever really controls Congress to the extent you believe.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If the Dems didn't control Congress right now, we wouldn't have to be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; putting up with the charade they are currently engaging in in terms of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; war in Iraq. And Lieberman is a good example, if he wasn't caucusing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the Dems, the Dems wouldn't have control of the Senate.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Would the results though, of the Senate's actions, be any different?
&gt;&gt; &gt; They really would not.  Elections are won and lost....both on the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;staged&quot; politics of the spin scheduled for each day and the practical
&gt;&gt; &gt; politics of the reasoned minds of the real leaders and the majority
&gt;&gt; &gt; from
&gt;&gt; &gt; both sides of the Congressional aisles. One quarter of both sides of
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; Congressional aisles are true believers/ideologues.  The other half,
&gt;&gt; &gt; really, are in the vast middle and could form their own party if they
&gt;&gt; &gt; wanted to do so.  Thank goodness there are cooler heads on both sides
&gt;&gt; &gt; like Lieberman and Snowe.  Those who foam at the mouth, be they
&gt;&gt; &gt; Democrat
&gt;&gt; &gt; or Republican, set the process back, not advance it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It's important to have control even if that control is accomplished
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; through
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the likes of Snowe and Chaffee.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I agree that control is important but if you can't move a practical
&gt;&gt; &gt; agenda because of them, control really means very little other than
&gt;&gt; &gt; agenda setting and who gets blamed for doing nothing.  Case in point,
&gt;&gt; &gt; look how bad the President's poll numbers are now and compare them to
&gt;&gt; &gt; how worse Congresses are.  Control sure helps the Democrats there,
&gt;&gt; &gt; doesn't it.  Be grateful, right now, that the Republicans aren't in
&gt;&gt; &gt; control because if one party had the responsibility for those kinds of
&gt;&gt; &gt; numbers....we would, most probably, be looking at a Reaganesque
&gt;&gt; &gt; watershed election again, and if the Republicans were in current
&gt;&gt; &gt; control
&gt;&gt; &gt; with those numbers....it wouldn't look too good for our side.  Now, we
&gt;&gt; &gt; have a pretty decent chance of regaining at least one house and maybe
&gt;&gt; &gt; convert guys like Heath Shuler while they are still political
&gt;&gt; &gt; neophytes.

&gt;&gt; &gt; --
&gt;&gt; &gt; I hope we can all be good neighbors online!

&gt;&gt; I disagree with most of this but don't really have time to respond in
&gt;&gt; whole
&gt;&gt; right now.

&gt;&gt; I don't think &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;middle of the road&quot; solves anything. It only
&gt;&gt; pushes many issues off into the future, see: the coming bankruptcy of
&gt;&gt; Social
&gt;&gt; Security, which was nothing but a Ponzi scheme to being with. Also, there
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; no middle of the road when it comes to a lot of issues. Like abortion.
&gt;&gt; And
&gt;&gt; gay marriage.

&gt;&gt; Suffice to say, I think my town, my state, my country and my world would
&gt;&gt; all
&gt;&gt; be better off if a hard-right agenda were put in place. I'd rather have
&gt;&gt; nothing happening on a Republican watch and not have to put up with the
&gt;&gt; Democrats nonsense.

&gt;&gt; TC

&gt; TC, I like you. You're a good guy and a lot of fun here.  What you are
&gt; saying though puts you in the &quot;sheep&quot; category, just like the vast
&gt; numbers of teachers who are in the Democratic camp for equally blind
&gt; reasons.

&gt; I have earned a good life, in large part, by serving the interests of
&gt; the Republican Party as a loyal member....with homage paid to a select
&gt; group of Democratic clients.  At the same time, however, the ideologues
&gt; really are not respected by the vast majorities of both parties with
&gt; whom they serve alongside on the Hill.  You should hear the jokes that
&gt; solid, Democrats of conscience, say about the likes of Franken and
&gt; Miller.  The same goes for Republicans about the likes of Rush and
&gt; O'Reilly.  Congresspersons of both parties, who take their jobs
&gt; seriously and with due diligence, pay lip service to the buffoons while
&gt; using them, and those who blindly follow, for whatever they need to get
&gt; good government established or bad government dismantled.

&gt; Trust me, as many Dems and Repubs dislike their extremes within their
&gt; own parties as they do the others

I like you too Bob, but in all candid-ness, YOU are what is wrong with the
Republican party.

You think you can make nice with the left. You think compromises can be
wrought with lunatics who would sell the country out in a second. You think
that moderate positions will solve all problems, and as I pointed out, in
some cases there is no moderate position and in others the moderate position
only serves to exacerbate the problem.

Trying to compromise with the left has given us:

1. Abortion on demand
2. Needles for drug addicts
3. Condoms for school kids
4. Medical marijuana
5. Half the people in the country paying for the other half
6. Environmentalist wacko's controlling our ability to garner our own energy
7. The man-made global warming hoax, which is sure to be costing me
something in tax money some time in the near future.
8. A welfare state
9. Criminals released out into the streets to rape and pillage time and time
again
10. The ACLU telling us that NAMBLA is okay, but a cross that's been in
place for 50 years on public property isn't
11. The circumvention of the will of the people through the use of decrees
from liberal judges. Like the overturning of Prop 187 in CA., for instance.

The left *doesn't* compromise Bob, and until *all* Republicans learn that
hard lesson, we'll continue to get more of the above.

I'm a conservative, first and foremost. I'm a Republican because they at
least pay lip service to the things I believe in. I believe in right vs.
wrong, not right vs. left.

People like Rush, Hannity, Tom Delay and Tom Tancredo aren't afraid to tell
the truth about the left, and neither am I. That's why they have my respect
and should have yours.

TC

Ok my friend....now we're going to discuss real life, hard ball, politics.
This may not be what you're used to from: Rush, Mark or Ann but it is
what inside politics is all about.  I'm not even going to pull out the
soapbox here because, in essence, this is going to be the equivalent of
a senior seminar in political science by a guest lecturer from the
&quot;real&quot; world of day to day, hand to hand, political combat.  The gasbags
from both sides of the aisle may speak it for their dollars but I live
it and help shape it through understanding of the realities of the
political process.

Remember, please first, that I was a young man who was heavily involved
in the Reagan Revolution.  Along with a good, now departed, friend, we
called the race before the first positive poll came in at the end, based
on watching the liberal reporters in the spin pool, deflate upon hearing
&quot;ask yourself if your better off now, than you were four years ago.&quot;

I believe Newt Gingrich may be one of the smartest men ever in American
politics.  He's the closest thing, even to this day, to the political
intellect of the Founding Fathers.  I also believe, and he would agree,
that his personality, the character he played, as well as his character
itself, largely kept him from achieving what he, probably would have by
now, and never will.

Now, just who does Newt, by his own admission, believe is a very
practical, pragmatic politician with ideas, while contrary to his own,
that he has profound respect for and can work with for the interests of
the country?  You better sit down because it's Hillary Clinton.  If
you're in his company for more than 30 minutes, he will, inevitably,
remark that he'd love to run for President against her because he would
enjoy the intellectual discourse of debate.  He's even mused about the
old JFK/Goldwater idea of flying around the country and following the
same itinerary so that they could do Lincoln-Douglas style debates,
right in almost every backyard, every day, throughout the country.  Newt
feels that he could also work with her to find mutual solutions to many
of our problems.  Does that sound like a man who is &quot;wrong&quot; being in the
Republican Party?

Have you ever read here, where I've said many times...&quot;there are certain
lines in the sand?&quot;  Sure, there are &quot;no compromise zones&quot; but there are
also many, many more &quot;compromise&quot; ones.  The problem with &quot;compromise&quot;
is that the zealots of both sides cannot get, or take, credit when
compromise is achieved.  Who loses?.....the people of the United States
of America.

By all likelihood, Rudy Guiliani or Fred Thompson (outside chance of
John McCain...all others need not apply, you're wasting taxpayer
funds...while we are at it, the same holds if your a Democratic
candidate and your name is not Clinton or Obama) will be the Republican
nominee for POTUS.  Talk about two men willing to compromise on most
issues.  Are they what's &quot;wrong&quot; with the Republican Party?  Look at
Mitt Romney.....he passed health care in Massachusettes as a Republican
Governor, is he &quot;wrong&quot; with the Republican Party?  We don't even have
to mention John McCain, who sat in a rat's hell of a box for half a
decade of his life....you know he's &quot;wrong&quot;, as well because of his
positions, correct?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Trying to compromise with the left has given us:

&gt; 1. Abortion on demand

Ok, that's a line in the sand issue.  Yet, the other side isn't going to
give either.  So what do we do?......change Supreme Court justices every
generation and switch back and forth every 20 or so years, like the
track we are currently on?

Let me say here, that I agree on that line in the sand on this one, even
if we do wind up switching back and forth ever 20 years.

Gingrich has said for years that abortion foes also need to step up and
fund, governmentally if necessary, good and strong adoption homes and
centers as an alternative, even if it means raising revenue or cutting
Republican oriented budget items.  Is he &quot;wrong&quot; for the Republican
Party?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2. Needles for drug addicts
">

Check what some very prominent conservatives have, softly, spoken on
this.  They are in agreement but like Obama and Clinton on Iraq, they
won't say it too publicly or loud because they know it will cost them
from the fringe, not the center.  The social and economic costs on
families and our health care budget from hep B and AIDS is just too darn
high, not to provide clean needles as well as programs to get off drugs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3. Condoms for school kids
">

Do you want to pick up the costs of welfare for kids who don't show good
judgment...whether it's because they have the morals of alley cats or
because their parents haven't given a damn?  At the same time, if we
don't teach sex ed, at the appropriate levels...plain and simple with no
bias, what should we expect as a result?  Talk about your welfare
spending......lower the birth rate among those under 21 by 25 percent
and you will lower your welfare costs nationally by over half.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 4. Medical marijuana

Did you know Reagan actually thought this might be a good idea for
specific illnesses accompanied by strong governance laws?  Remember old
Ronnie was a strong liberal before he saw the light but he was also a
humanitarian.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 5. Half the people in the country paying for the other half
">

We're in agreement here. The answer though does not lie in tax cuts for
the upper 10 percent of incomes. I ask those readers of this, who are
still here through this dialectic, to please excuse the following
statement from me.....TC, I am in that upper 10 percent and trickle down
doesn't work.  At the same time, neither does the giveaway of LBJ.
Here's a newsflash...within 20 years we will have a flat tax, with
almost no deductions period, as the sole federal tax in this country.
Now, that may be a flat income tax or a value added tax, but it will be
one or the other.  When everyone pays their fair share, everyone will
also feel that they've done their part. Too many influential and
respected Congresspeople and Senators are saying this behind closed
doors and whispering it at dinner parties. When it happens it will be
bipartisan.  So will Social Security reform because compromise is the
only way we're going to fix this issues.

In almost every poll we've done that I can publicly speak about, you
know what is almost always the top response why Americans are mad at big
business?  It's the differential between salaries for top executives vs
the diminished of the value of the salaries of everyone else. This hold
for upper middle class folks and the lowest of the lower class. Think
about the political and economic ramifications of this for a while.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 6. Environmentalist wacko's controlling our ability to garner our own energy
">

Your addressing the coast of Florida and Alaska.  Do you know how much a
gallon of gas would go down if we opened up one or both of these for
development?  About a half a buck a gallon.  Now, if you want to address
why wacko's stop high end road development because of a duck, I agree
with you.  Our infrastructure, nationally, is falling apart because
little has been done since Eisenhower initiated the programs that built
them.  Fix the infrastructure and we will save gabillions on energy
costs, time on travelling and provide more decent blue collar jobs,
especially for those on welfare, then you can possibly imagine.  BTW,
Rudy's platform addresses fixing the infrastructure as a top level
national priority.  It's also a security issue in the post 9/11 world.

On this, unfortunately, the Republican Party has little to distinguish
itself.  Al Gore is not right on many things he's ever proposed but this
issue he's really is a prominent expert. Even the President has come
around to the fact that global warming is reality.  We're all going to
be spending more on this because we bought ourselves the problem with
how we've lived.  Now, part of that is a function of economics...cheap
gas led to.....yadda, yadda, yadda.  At the same time though, the left
will have to accept that nuclear plants are the most efficient and

First, I agree with your description of Newt.

Second, it doesn't matter what Newt thinks of Hillary as a politician,
person or witch that she is, what matters are her socialist views, PERIOD.

If Hillary's view of how the world should operate were implemented, am I
supposed to take some kind of solace in the fact Newt and Hillary had a
great debate?

Hillary and her ilk need to be defeated.

&gt;&gt; position
&gt;&gt; only serves to exacerbate the problem.

&gt; Have you ever read here, where I've said many times...&quot;there are certain
&gt; lines in the sand?&quot;  Sure, there are &quot;no compromise zones&quot; but there are
&gt; also many, many more &quot;compromise&quot; ones.  The problem with &quot;compromise&quot;
&gt; is that the zealots of both sides cannot get, or take, credit when
&gt; compromise is achieved.  Who loses?.....the people of the United States
&gt; of America.

&gt; By all likelihood, Rudy Guiliani or Fred Thompson (outside chance of
&gt; John McCain...all others need not apply, you're wasting taxpayer
&gt; funds...while we are at it, the same holds if your a Democratic
&gt; candidate and your name is not Clinton or Obama) will be the Republican
&gt; nominee for POTUS.  Talk about two men willing to compromise on most
&gt; issues.  Are they what's &quot;wrong&quot; with the Republican Party?  Look at
&gt; Mitt Romney.....he passed health care in Massachusettes as a Republican
&gt; Governor, is he &quot;wrong&quot; with the Republican Party?  We don't even have
&gt; to mention John McCain, who sat in a rat's hell of a box for half a
&gt; decade of his life....you know he's &quot;wrong&quot;, as well because of his
&gt; positions, correct?
">

Your statements only serve to illustrate my point. The Republican party
should be nominating people like Tom Delay for President. Someone who will
stand up to the left and tell them they are wrong.

The people you cite above only serve to water down the Republican party, and
yes, I blame them for doing it and you for accepting it.

&gt;&gt; Trying to compromise with the left has given us:

&gt;&gt; 1. Abortion on demand

&gt; Ok, that's a line in the sand issue.  Yet, the other side isn't going to
&gt; give either.  So what do we do?......change Supreme Court justices every
&gt; generation and switch back and forth every 20 or so years, like the
&gt; track we are currently on?

&gt; Let me say here, that I agree on that line in the sand on this one, even
&gt; if we do wind up switching back and forth ever 20 years.

&gt; Gingrich has said for years that abortion foes also need to step up and
&gt; fund, governmentally if necessary, good and strong adoption homes and
&gt; centers as an alternative, even if it means raising revenue or cutting
&gt; Republican oriented budget items.  Is he &quot;wrong&quot; for the Republican
&gt; Party?

Gingrich is wrong here, and so are you. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY is the key
here, as it is in most issues. People need to be made to feel the
consequences of their actions, not have others pick up the slack for their
irresponsible behavior.

If you don't want kids, don't get pregnant. If you do get pregnant, and you
can't afford or don't want the kid, put the kid up for adoption, but don't
MURDER the kid before he/she even has a chance.

There should be no &quot;switching back and forth&quot;. That's a cop-out. The
question in almost all cases is &quot;What is the RIGHT thing to do?&quot;. Is the
right thing to do to allow irresponsible people to use abortion as birth
control?

&gt; Check what some very prominent conservatives have, softly, spoken on
&gt; this.  They are in agreement but like Obama and Clinton on Iraq, they
&gt; won't say it too publicly or loud because they know it will cost them
&gt; from the fringe, not the center.  The social and economic costs on
&gt; families and our health care budget from hep B and AIDS is just too darn
&gt; high, not to provide clean needles as well as programs to get off drugs.

Again you bow to the left. I say if you want to engage in drug use, just
like if you want to engage in a game of Russian roulette, you're on your

Drugs are illegal. What is the right thing to do? Is it to enable law
breakers to continue to break the law.

&gt;&gt; 3. Condoms for school kids

&gt; Do you want to pick up the costs of welfare for kids who don't show good
&gt; judgment...whether it's because they have the morals of alley cats or
&gt; because their parents haven't given a damn?  At the same time, if we
&gt; don't teach sex ed, at the appropriate levels...plain and simple with no
&gt; bias, what should we expect as a result?  Talk about your welfare
&gt; spending......lower the birth rate among those under 21 by 25 percent
&gt; and you will lower your welfare costs nationally by over half.
">

Again, your explanation is the knee-jerk reaction of a leftist. Since we've
set up a society where no one pays for their bad behavior (a welfare state)
what do we get? Right, more and more bad behavior.

It's not my responsibility to pick up the cost of anyone elses irresponsible
behavior. My parents taught me not to get my teenage girlfriend pregnant and
her parents taught her not to get pregnant.

If I'm teaching my kid abstinance at home, I don't want the school handing
out condoms to them.

The problem is the right keeps backing up on issues just like this one,
instead of standing our ground.

Are you afraid that your children are so weak-willed that they won't

children will actually think for themselves and make their own
decisions?  Heaven forbid people be given a *choice*, and be allowed
to weigh options for themselves, and take responsibility for their own

And studies show, time and time again, if you don't want kids getting
pregnant, they have to be comprehensively educated *and* provided
access to safe means of having the sex that they're going to have
anyway.

The United States has the highest teen pregnancy rates, the highest
unintended teen pregnancy rates, and the highest teen STD rates *by
far* of any industrialized nation in the world, especially for younger
teens.  Yet the rate of actual sex among teens is about the same
across the board in industrialized countries, with the US not really
standing out---we're pretty average.  For example, Swedish teenagers
are more likely to have sex than American teenagers (86% of Swedes
have sex before age 20, compared to 81% for Americans), but the
Swedish teen pregnancy rate is *ONE-THIRD* what ours is.

The real difference between us and everyone else?  We have an
unrealistic, almost fetishistic, focus on abstinence education
(three-fourths of US teens get formal abstinence education before they
even have sex, but only half get formal contraceptive education before
then), and other aspects of our sex education and teen access to
contraception are significantly inferior to other industrialized
countries.  When our teens have sex, they're more likely to get
pregnant and/or get an STD.

&gt;&gt; Ok my friend....now we're going to discuss real life, hard ball, politics.
&gt;&gt; This may not be what you're used to from: Rush, Mark or Ann but it is

&gt;&gt; from both sides of the aisle may speak it for their dollars but I live
&gt;&gt; it and help shape it through understanding of the realities of the
&gt;&gt; political process.

&gt;&gt; Remember, please first, that I was a young man who was heavily involved
&gt;&gt; in the Reagan Revolution.  Along with a good, now departed, friend, we
&gt;&gt; called the race before the first positive poll came in at the end, based
&gt;&gt; on watching the liberal reporters in the spin pool, deflate upon hearing
&gt;&gt; &quot;ask yourself if your better off now, than you were four years ago.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I believe Newt Gingrich may be one of the smartest men ever in American
&gt;&gt; politics.  He's the closest thing, even to this day, to the political
&gt;&gt; intellect of the Founding Fathers.  I also believe, and he would agree,
&gt;&gt; that his personality, the character he played, as well as his character
&gt;&gt; itself, largely kept him from achieving what he, probably would have by
&gt;&gt; now, and never will.

&gt;&gt; Now, just who does Newt, by his own admission, believe is a very
&gt;&gt; practical, pragmatic politician with ideas, while contrary to his own,
&gt;&gt; that he has profound respect for and can work with for the interests of
&gt;&gt; the country?  You better sit down because it's Hillary Clinton.  If
&gt;&gt; you're in his company for more than 30 minutes, he will, inevitably,
&gt;&gt; remark that he'd love to run for President against her because he would
&gt;&gt; enjoy the intellectual discourse of debate.  He's even mused about the
&gt;&gt; old JFK/Goldwater idea of flying around the country and following the
&gt;&gt; same itinerary so that they could do Lincoln-Douglas style debates,
&gt;&gt; right in almost every backyard, every day, throughout the country.  Newt
&gt;&gt; feels that he could also work with her to find mutual solutions to many
&gt;&gt; of our problems.  Does that sound like a man who is &quot;wrong&quot; being in the
&gt;&gt; Republican Party?

&gt; First, I agree with your description of Newt.

&gt; Second, it doesn't matter what Newt thinks of Hillary as a politician,
&gt; person or witch that she is, what matters are her socialist views, PERIOD.

&gt; If Hillary's view of how the world should operate were implemented, am I
&gt; supposed to take some kind of solace in the fact Newt and Hillary had a
&gt; great debate?

&gt; Hillary and her ilk need to be defeated.
">

TC, you and (I think) Bob are somewhat missing the point. The reason
Newt would want to debate Hillary is because she is the only Democrat
candidate bright enough (and perhaps foolish enough) to meaningfully
engage him on the real issues. Much of the public is too ignorant to
follow such a discussion directly, but would be able to discern the
victor of such a debate by the demeanor of the combatants. (Hillary's
short fuse would be an advantage here, as well.) In such a debate, some
light might just be generated along with all the predictable heat.

I don't think you are so much a conservative as you are a proponent of
the right wing stance on a number of the largely unimportant issues,
issues which persist primarily because they are useful for inflaming the
bases of both parties. Most of the points you and Bob discuss in this
thread are important only to the extent that they motivate the simple
minded or ill-educated to back one party or another. For example, global
warming: even if it is a fraud or vastly exaggerated, which I believe it
is, we should still be pursuing *rational* solutions to energy
production/ conservation for economic and foreign policy reasons. As
long as we lack a rational energy strategy, global warming/cooling/
drying/wetting/etc. will remain a political lever too powerful to
discard and little or nothing will be done to address the real energy
issues. Another example would be Roe v Wade: overturning that case would
have no effect in 39 or 50 states, likely fewer, as state governments in
most of the remaining 11 would make immediate changes to grant the same
abortion rights Ronald Reagan signed into law as Governor of California.

The real problems our country faces are degenerative and systemic. The
system of government created by our founders was to have a strong
bicameral legislature, a weak judiciary, and an executive which is weak
except in times of war. (It is no accident that war is declared by
congress but the tools for achieving the peace are largely vested in the
executive.) Since Marbury v Madison (1803), the judiciary has gradually
usurped power from the legislature, a process which continues to this
day. Congress, in turn, usurps power from the individual states with
tacit (and occasionally active) support from the federal courts, which,
in their turn, usurp those new powers unto themselves.

The net result is a very strong federal judiciary and a weak
legislature, empowered only to rob the public in a continuing quest to
perpetuate itself. The executive, regardless of the party affiliation,
is largely ineffective except around the margins. It is a system
guaranteed to foster the corruption we witness.

The only real solution is a rethink of our &quot;living Constitution.&quot; Step
one, put a stake through its heart and kill it dead (Scalia, &quot;I like my
Constitution dead.&quot;) Amend the Constitution to severely limit the power
of the Supreme Court. Step two, amend the 14th amendment and restore
*some* power to the individual states. Amend the 16th amendment to limit
the power of Congress to perform the sort of mischief it does by
limiting both the size of the purse and the purposes to which its
contents can be put.

Since none of the proposed changes are likely, we're pretty much
buggered. This leaves the rational voter only one choice, hold your nose
and *generally* vote Republican, since their stupidity is usually much
less dangerous and always less persistent than the stupidity of the
Democrats. (This does not preclude voting for a Joe Lieberman in races
where the choice is between a sane relatively moral Democrat and a
left-wing whack job.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; you're in his company for more than 30 minutes, he will, inevitably,
&gt;&gt;&gt; remark that he'd love to run for President against her because he would
&gt;&gt;&gt; enjoy the intellectual discourse of debate.  He's even mused about the
&gt;&gt;&gt; old JFK/Goldwater idea of flying around the country and following the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same itinerary so that they could do Lincoln-Douglas style debates,
&gt;&gt;&gt; right in almost every backyard, every day, throughout the country.  Newt
&gt;&gt;&gt; feels that he could also work with her to find mutual solutions to many
&gt;&gt;&gt; of our problems.  Does that sound like a man who is &quot;wrong&quot; being in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Republican Party?

&gt;&gt; First, I agree with your description of Newt.

&gt;&gt; Second, it doesn't matter what Newt thinks of Hillary as a politician,
&gt;&gt; person or witch that she is, what matters are her socialist views,
&gt;&gt; PERIOD.

&gt;&gt; If Hillary's view of how the world should operate were implemented, am I
&gt;&gt; supposed to take some kind of solace in the fact Newt and Hillary had a
&gt;&gt; great debate?

&gt;&gt; Hillary and her ilk need to be defeated.

&gt; TC, you and (I think) Bob are somewhat missing the point. The reason Newt
&gt; would want to debate Hillary is because she is the only Democrat candidate
&gt; bright enough (and perhaps foolish enough) to meaningfully engage him on
&gt; the real issues. Much of the public is too ignorant to follow such a
&gt; discussion directly, but would be able to discern the victor of such a
&gt; debate by the demeanor of the combatants. (Hillary's short fuse would be
&gt; an advantage here, as well.) In such a debate, some light might just be
&gt; generated along with all the predictable heat.

&gt; I don't think you are so much a conservative as you are a proponent of the
&gt; right wing stance on a number of the largely unimportant issues, issues
&gt; which persist primarily because they are useful for inflaming the bases of
&gt; both parties. Most of the points you and Bob discuss in this thread are
&gt; important only to the extent that they motivate the simple minded or
&gt; ill-educated to back one party or another. For example, global warming:
&gt; even if it is a fraud or vastly exaggerated, which I believe it is, we
&gt; should still be pursuing *rational* solutions to energy production/
&gt; conservation for economic and foreign policy reasons. As long as we lack a
&gt; rational energy strategy, global warming/cooling/ drying/wetting/etc. will
&gt; remain a political lever too powerful to discard and little or nothing
&gt; will be done to address the real energy issues. Another example would be
&gt; Roe v Wade: overturning that case would have no effect in 39 or 50 states,
&gt; likely fewer, as state governments in most of the remaining 11 would make
&gt; immediate changes to grant the same abortion rights Ronald Reagan signed
&gt; into law as Governor of California.

&gt; The real problems our country faces are degenerative and systemic. The
&gt; system of government created by our founders was to have a strong
&gt; bicameral legislature, a weak judiciary, and an executive which is weak
&gt; except in times of war. (It is no accident that war is declared by
&gt; congress but the tools for achieving the peace are largely vested in the
&gt; executive.) Since Marbury v Madison (1803), the judiciary has gradually
&gt; usurped power from the legislature, a process which continues to this day.
&gt; Congress, in turn, usurps power from the individual states with tacit (and
&gt; occasionally active) support from the federal courts, which, in their
&gt; turn, usurp those new powers unto themselves.

&gt; The net result is a very strong federal judiciary and a weak legislature,
&gt; empowered only to rob the public in a continuing quest to perpetuate
&gt; itself. The executive, regardless of the party affiliation, is largely
&gt; ineffective except around the margins. It is a system guaranteed to foster
&gt; the corruption we witness.

&gt; The only real solution is a rethink of our &quot;living Constitution.&quot; Step
&gt; one, put a stake through its heart and kill it dead (Scalia, &quot;I like my
&gt; Constitution dead.&quot;) Amend the Constitution to severely limit the power of
&gt; the Supreme Court. Step two, amend the 14th amendment and restore *some*
&gt; power to the individual states. Amend the 16th amendment to limit the
&gt; power of Congress to perform the sort of mischief it does by limiting both
&gt; the size of the purse and the purposes to which its contents can be put.

&gt; Since none of the proposed changes are likely, we're pretty much buggered.
&gt; This leaves the rational voter only one choice, hold your nose and
&gt; *generally* vote Republican, since their stupidity is usually much less
&gt; dangerous and always less persistent than the stupidity of the Democrats.
&gt; (This does not preclude voting for a Joe Lieberman in races where the
&gt; choice is between a sane relatively moral Democrat and a left-wing whack
&gt; job.)

You I will talk to Mickey. You make a lot of sense here, but I disagree with
your premise that things like the global warming hoax aren't that important.

Anything that is used by the left to extract more money from my wallet is
important to me and should be important to everyone.

I agree with your premise about the judiciary becoming way too powerful, but
I also believe the more money we send to Washington, the more power we turn
over to Washington. The more we let them redistribute, the more the people
who are the beneficiaries of the redistribution will clamor for more. Just
about every left-wing &quot;initiative&quot; has some kind of tax related to it.

One other thing, I write what I believe not what the right or left wing
preaches. I hope everyday the Republicans will do the right thing, and time
after time I'm disappointed. But, as you say, a watered down Republican is
still better than just about any Democrat. It's very easy to rationalize bad
behavior. All you have to do is read anything Nathan Sanders writes in
defense of any leftist position.

Lastly, I think if you agree with Newt about Hillary, then you are both
wrong. I'm sure Newt would wipe the floor with Hillary in just about any
type of contest that could be construed as requiring intelligence and I'm
fairly certain he knows it too. He's just being polite in case he gets into
the race.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;I'm going to snip down to the last bits you wrote&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I like you too Bob, but in all candid-ness, YOU are what is wrong with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Republican party.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok my friend....now we're going to discuss real life, hard ball,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; politics.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This may not be what you're used to from: Rush, Mark or Ann but it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what inside politics is all about.  I'm not even going to pull out the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; soapbox here because, in essence, this is going to be the equivalent of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a senior seminar in political science by a guest lecturer from the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;real&quot; world of day to day, hand to hand, political combat.  The gasbags
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from both sides of the aisle may speak it for their dollars but I live
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it and help shape it through understanding of the realities of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; political process.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remember, please first, that I was a young man who was heavily involved
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the Reagan Revolution.  Along with a good, now departed, friend, we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; called the race before the first positive poll came in at the end, based
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on watching the liberal reporters in the spin pool, deflate upon hearing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;ask yourself if your better off now, than you were four years ago.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe Newt Gingrich may be one of the smartest men ever in American
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; politics.  He's the closest thing, even to this day, to the political
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intellect of the Founding Fathers.  I also believe, and he would agree,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that his personality, the character he played, as well as his character
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself, largely kept him from achieving what he, probably would have by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now, and never will.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, just who does Newt, by his own admission, believe is a very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; practical, pragmatic politician with ideas, while contrary to his own,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that he has profound respect for and can work with for the interests of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the country?  You better sit down because it's Hillary Clinton.  If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you're in his company for more than 30 minutes, he will, inevitably,

Reread my post. I stipulate that is the only reason it is important.
Remove the issue by implementing a sensible energy policy, one that
addresses the real issues while at least giving lip service to the
global warming alarmists. Do that and the leverage goes away; meanwhile
useful research and long overdue rebuilding of infrastructure gets done.

&gt; &gt;&gt; You think you can make nice with the left. You think compromises can be

&gt; &gt;&gt; think
&gt; &gt;&gt; that moderate positions will solve all problems, and as I pointed out, in
&gt; &gt;&gt; some cases there is no moderate position and in others the moderate
&gt; &gt;&gt; position
&gt; &gt;&gt; only serves to exacerbate the problem.

&gt; &gt; Have you ever read here, where I've said many times...&quot;there are certain
&gt; &gt; lines in the sand?&quot;  Sure, there are &quot;no compromise zones&quot; but there are
&gt; &gt; also many, many more &quot;compromise&quot; ones.  The problem with &quot;compromise&quot;
&gt; &gt; is that the zealots of both sides cannot get, or take, credit when
&gt; &gt; compromise is achieved.  Who loses?.....the people of the United States
&gt; &gt; of America.

&gt; &gt; By all likelihood, Rudy Guiliani or Fred Thompson (outside chance of
&gt; &gt; John McCain...all others need not apply, you're wasting taxpayer
&gt; &gt; funds...while we are at it, the same holds if your a Democratic
&gt; &gt; candidate and your name is not Clinton or Obama) will be the Republican
&gt; &gt; nominee for POTUS.  Talk about two men willing to compromise on most
&gt; &gt; issues.  Are they what's &quot;wrong&quot; with the Republican Party?  Look at
&gt; &gt; Mitt Romney.....he passed health care in Massachusettes as a Republican
&gt; &gt; Governor, is he &quot;wrong&quot; with the Republican Party?  We don't even have
&gt; &gt; to mention John McCain, who sat in a rat's hell of a box for half a
&gt; &gt; decade of his life....you know he's &quot;wrong&quot;, as well because of his
&gt; &gt; positions, correct?

&gt; Your statements only serve to illustrate my point. The Republican party
&gt; should be nominating people like Tom Delay for President. Someone who will
&gt; stand up to the left and tell them they are wrong.

&gt; The people you cite above only serve to water down the Republican party, and
&gt; yes, I blame them for doing it and you for accepting it.
">

First, I'm one of those that do it, that's how I earn my
living....contesting and winning elections, along with some media,
Hollywood type work.  The day the Republican Party nominates Tom Delay
for President is the day that it guarantees the worst defeat, nationally
and in every Congressional and Senate race, ever.  I can't address Tom
Delay any further.  Suffice it to say, he would not make a good neighbor
much less a terrible President.  He would be worse than Hoover and
Carter combined.

The Republican Party is just that, a party.  It's inclusive of those who
believe more in it than any other party.  At the same time, that means
it excludes others.  You may wish to hold your nose, in your opinion,
and vote for the elephants.  I can live with that because you're voting
Republican.  At the same time though, you're not really a Republican,
you are closer to a Libertarian but you know that no Libertarian will
ever come close to election.

&gt; &gt; Gingrich has said for years that abortion foes also need to step up and

&gt; &gt; Republican oriented budget items.  Is he &quot;wrong&quot; for the Republican
&gt; &gt; Party?

&gt; Gingrich is wrong here, and so are you. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY is the key
&gt; here, as it is in most issues. People need to be made to feel the
&gt; consequences of their actions, not have others pick up the slack for their
&gt; irresponsible behavior.

I'll agree with you on personal responsibility being the key.
Unfortunately, most of the time it does not fit the lock. So, you can
scream platitudes all you want, or you can attempt to effectively
govern.

Since Gingrich is wrong, according to you...guess he doesn't belong in
your Republican Party either, huh?  If you want to return abortion to
the states, which by the way...according to the laws on the books in
almost 80 percent of them would legally allow abortion, that's your
opinion.  I would prefer to outlaw it completely except in cases of the
mother's health, rape and incest.  At the same time, though, Gingrich
is, intelligently, saying that pragmatically, Republicans have to &quot;put
up or shut up&quot; in terms of providing for the lives of the children, not
adults, that are saved through adoption centers etc.  Are you that
heartless, TC, that you want kids to starve because their parents are
prairie dogs?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you don't want kids, don't get pregnant. If you do get pregnant, and you

Precisely what Gingrich says.  At the same time, what do you want to do
with the kids who aren't adopted?  A true caring society would care for
those children.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There should be no &quot;switching back and forth&quot;. That's a cop-out. The

&gt; control?
">

That's the law of the land until it is changed.  I, for one, hope that
it is.  I also hope that when it is, we don't condemn the innocents to
starvation and early death before their first birthday because you feel
that we shouldn't, if necessary, provide these children with shelter,
food and health care.

&gt; &gt; Check what some very prominent conservatives have, softly, spoken on

&gt; &gt; won't say it too publicly or loud because they know it will cost them
&gt; &gt; from the fringe, not the center.  The social and economic costs on
&gt; &gt; families and our health care budget from hep B and AIDS is just too darn
&gt; &gt; high, not to provide clean needles as well as programs to get off drugs.

&gt; Again you bow to the left. I say if you want to engage in drug use, just
&gt; like if you want to engage in a game of Russian roulette, you're on your
&gt; own.

&gt; Drugs are illegal. What is the right thing to do? Is it to enable law
&gt; breakers to continue to break the law.

You constantly talk about your taxed and pocketbook issues.  You'll save
yourself, and society, a great deal of money if you give out clean
needles coupled with drug rehab that if you have to pay health costs,
through your taxes, for hep B and C, as well as AIDS treatments.  Screw
the rest of your arguments, TC, it's a hell of a lot cheaper to
distribute clean needles and offer rehab that it is to pay for the
aftereffects, not to mention the crimes committed to pay for the habits.

&gt; &gt; Your addressing the coast of Florida and Alaska.  Do you know how much a
&gt; &gt; gallon of gas would go down if we opened up one or both of these for
&gt; &gt; development?  About a half a buck a gallon.  Now, if you want to address
&gt; &gt; why wacko's stop high end road development because of a duck, I agree
&gt; &gt; with you.  Our infrastructure, nationally, is falling apart because
&gt; &gt; little has been done since Eisenhower initiated the programs that built
&gt; &gt; them.  Fix the infrastructure and we will save gabillions on energy
&gt; &gt; costs, time on travelling and provide more decent blue collar jobs,
&gt; &gt; especially for those on welfare, then you can possibly imagine.  BTW,
&gt; &gt; Rudy's platform addresses fixing the infrastructure as a top level
&gt; &gt; national priority.  It's also a security issue in the post 9/11 world.

&gt; I don't care if the cost didn't go down at all. I care that middle eastern
&gt; dictators wouldn't be getting the money and then using it to buy up America.

How will using strategic reserves and unused resources from Florida's
untapped offshore resources or the same from Alaska do that?  You really
don't know what you're taking about but you are saying exactly what Rush
and Sean say.  Baa Baa Black Sheep....come on TC, Rush had a wee bit of
a drug issue, right?  Rush sure escaped the long arm of the law, huh?
Don't hold his views or he himself up to anyone as a moral authority.

Middle Eastern dictators and the Chinese are buying up America because
we won't balance our own national checkbook.  To do that we can cut
spending, raise revenue or do both.  If we cut spending, it's going to
be across the board, that's the politics so we will be hurting a number
of defense programs as well as causing economic insecurity from job
losses.  If we raise taxes, there will be no one left to govern because
a vote in favor of tax increases is almost a death knell for one's
political career.  So, in the end, sometime in about Sept. 2009, a deal
will be cut where the answer is both.  Does it really matter if the fat
comes from social programs or business breaks?....it's still sticking it
to America and the voters.

&gt; &gt; issue he's really is a prominent expert. Even the President has come
&gt; &gt; around to the fact that global warming is reality.  We're all going to
&gt; &gt; be spending more on this because we bought ourselves the problem with
&gt; &gt; how we've lived.  Now, part of that is a function of economics...cheap
&gt; &gt; gas led to.....yadda, yadda, yadda.  At the same time though, the left
&gt; &gt; will have to accept that nuclear plants are the most efficient and
&gt; &gt; cheapest way to energize vast metropolitan areas.  They have to be built
&gt; &gt; right though and secured, in order for both sides to come to an
&gt; &gt; agreement on them.

&gt; Man-made global warming is a hoax. Period. Mars is warming and there are no
&gt; people there last time I looked.

&gt; There is nothing we are doing to make the &quot;problem&quot; worse and there is
&gt; nothing we can do to &quot;fix&quot; the problem.

Al Gore turned out, for once, to be right on something.  That one thing
is painful to admit but the truth is what it is.  Even the President now
speaks about the impact of global warming.

&gt; &gt;&gt; 5. Half the people in the country paying for the other half

&gt; &gt; We're in agreement here. The answer though does not lie in tax cuts for
&gt; &gt; the upper 10 percent of incomes. I ask those readers of this, who are
&gt; &gt; still here through this dialectic, to please excuse the following
&gt; &gt; statement from me.....TC, I am in that upper 10 percent and trickle down
&gt; &gt; doesn't work.  At the same time, neither does the giveaway of LBJ.
&gt; &gt; Here's a newsflash...within 20 years we will have a flat tax, with
&gt; &gt; almost no deductions period, as the sole federal tax in this country.
&gt; &gt; Now, that may be a flat income tax or a value added tax, but it will be
&gt; &gt; one or the other.  When everyone pays their fair share, everyone will
&gt; &gt; also feel that they've done their part. Too many influential and
&gt; &gt; respected Congresspeople and Senators are saying this behind closed
&gt; &gt; doors and whispering it at dinner parties. When it happens it will be
&gt; &gt; bipartisan.  So will Social Security reform because compromise is the
&gt; &gt; only way we're going to fix this issues.

&gt; &gt; In almost every poll we've done that I can publicly speak about, you
&gt; &gt; know what is almost always the top response why Americans are mad at big
&gt; &gt; business?  It's the differential between salaries for top executives vs
&gt; &gt; the diminished of the value of the salaries of everyone else. This hold
&gt; &gt; for upper middle class folks and the lowest of the lower class. Think
&gt; &gt; about the political and economic ramifications of this for a while.

&gt; I swear you sound more and more like a leftist.

&gt; Unfortunately, a good portion of America has bought into the Dems socialist
&gt; wet-dream. And why not, it sounds like something for nothing. Good
&gt; Republicans should be pushing back against the culture of entitlement. But,
&gt; unfortunately, we have watered down Republicans like McCain, Guiliani and
&gt; you.

&gt; As a true conservative, I don't begrudge *anyone* for making as much as they
&gt; can. I don't want to punish acheivement. Most people have no clue what it
&gt; takes to be the CEO of a major corporation.
">

Let me stop you here.  I do know what it takes.  Trickle down does not
work.  The gap between the very wealthy and everyone else, is now the
widest that it has ever been in the history of our country.  Maybe you
think that's a good think for a party to stand on that is pro-business
and free markets but it really is not.

Funny...that's a lot of what: Franken, Miller, Limbaugh and Coulter
do.....cocktail parties, speeches and self promotion.  Notice, I've put
the wingnuts of both sides of the aisle in the same pile.

Sheep and sheperds, TC.  One person's Jesse Jackson is another person's
Pat Robertson.  Both are scary as hell and detrimental to democracy,
much less either major party.

I've said a few times that about 2/3 to 3/4 of our business comes from
Republican candidates on a Federal level with the remainder,
appropriately conservative Democrats. We don't take everyone that walks
in the door.  Simple good business sense, alone...before even accounting
for the ethical considerations which are primary, prohibits me from
naming names, but we've turned down some of the most radical.  Our
success rate is approaching 80 percent in the last five years. Part of
that is due to the fact that we do our job very well.  The larger part
is because these people represent what the real majority of Americans
want and believe in.  The rest are those in the area outside of the
curve and that's where you are. Nothing wrong with that but that's the
way it is.

&gt; As far as the flat tax goes, nothing will change. If the government wants to

&gt; foot the bill and the skaters will continue to skate.
">

Ah, now, finally...you're getting at a root problem, namely that the
federal government spends too much money compared to what it takes in.
Sadly, as much as it pains me and many other Republicans, the current
administration has given us a deficit hellhole that is staggering,
especially considering that they came into office inheriting a budget
surplus.

Recently, I spoke before a moderate gathering of elected officials at a
party meeting.  One of the primary reasons for loss of Congressional
control was that the Republican majority in 2000 spent like the Democrat
one it replaced years ago. They spent like the opposition. Now, Iraq was
an equally large reason but runaway spending hurt just as much.

So what do you cut?  As long as we are a democracy and neither party has
enough votes to sustain a veto, it's going to have to be shared
pain......social spending and decreased business subsidies in order to
reduce the federal deficit.

&gt; &gt;&gt; 9. Criminals released out into the streets to rape and pillage time and
&gt; &gt;&gt; time
&gt; &gt;&gt; again

&gt; &gt; I am all for hard time for hard crime.  This is, almost, a line in the
&gt; &gt; sand issue.  As long as the Jackson's and Sharpton's of the world are
&gt; &gt; around, this will remain an unsettled issue.  Come November 2008, Barack
&gt; &gt; Obama may look back and conclude that he is neither President-Elect or
&gt; &gt; Vice President-Elect, because he did not have the political and personal
&gt; &gt; courage to call Jesse Jackson out on his statement this week that &quot;he is
&gt; &gt; not black enough.&quot;  He had an opportunity to make a significant advance
&gt; &gt; within his own party and Independents to seize a middle, even a slightly
&gt; &gt; right of middle ground and let it pass by...even if he did not mention
&gt; &gt; the Jana 6.  Obama has had a decent record on crime but he may have
&gt; &gt; blown the chance of his lifetime by not coming down hard on it, and
&gt; &gt; race, this week.  He might even have blown it so much that he can't be
&gt; &gt; considered for VP because of it.  Now, I don't believe he should be
&gt; &gt; President or VP because he is too darn inexperienced but I also believe
&gt; &gt; that &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; show the true character of our politicians.
&gt; &gt; Obama failed a test that JFK would have added a chapter to in his book,
&gt; &gt; if he had done so this week.

&gt; &gt; Now, let's also be sensible. Hard times for hard crime is acceptable to
&gt; &gt; the vast majority of Americans.  It's also expensive so let's reserve it
&gt; &gt; for those who make life dangerous for the rest of us.  A three-time drug
&gt; &gt; user, or a 3rd degree, non-violent felon would best serve society
&gt; &gt; through a combination of prison and rehabilitation in order to become
&gt; &gt; (or increase the likelihood of becoming) a contributing member of
&gt; &gt; society, rather than a mandatory (expensive) minimum of 10 to 20
&gt; &gt; years...plus come out of prison as a sub-human, likely to now cause
&gt; &gt; significant and seriously violent crime.

&gt; &gt; Death penalty...absolutely, I've no problem with it. Violent criminals
&gt; &gt; who do horrific crimes should pay the ultimate price.  Rehab doesn't
&gt; &gt; work. Life in prison without parole means that they will likely harm
&gt; &gt; others in prison as well as cost society a bundle via &quot;jail welfare&quot;.

&gt; I'm for taking social program money and building prisons, lots of prisons in
&gt; the Arizona desert.
">

How will the people of Arizona feel about that?  That won't solve any
problem at all.  If you want to keep blindly throwing out the O'Reilly
and Limbaugh isms, ok.  Yet, practical people, electing their government
to solve problems, should expect more than the crap that right and left
wing talk radio throws out every day.

&gt; &gt; you're going to truly have a separation of church and state in the
&gt; &gt; classic conservative tradition, nothing of religion belongs on public
&gt; &gt; property.  If God is everyone's God, would He want any of his children's
&gt; &gt; examples to be denied them because they were not of Christianity?

Separation of church and state.  If you are really, truly, a strict

&gt; &gt; Who appoints and approves judges, TC? Governors, state legislators etc.
&gt; &gt; who are elected by the people.  Got a problem with a judge...take it up

&gt; &gt; Earl Warren was a Republican, TC. The most liberal Court this country

&gt; &gt; believed in every piece of the fabric that he helped change.  Ike also
&gt; &gt; said he was the worst appointment he ever made so there is balance in
&gt; &gt; that.  Now, we have a centrist to right leaning Court.  It won't matter
&gt; &gt; who wins the next Presidential election in terms of the Court because no
&gt; &gt; more than 6 Senate seats either way will change.  Whoever is President
&gt; &gt; will have to appoint a moderate centrist in order to get approval.  Now,
&gt; &gt; that person will be a little more to the right or left, depending on the
&gt; &gt; result...but still a moderate centrist.  George H.W. Bush thought he was
&gt; &gt; getting a conservative in Souter....wrong.  Ike thought he was getting
&gt; &gt; one in Warren...wrong. Still, regardless of who does the nominating, the
&gt; &gt; Senate will be so close in numbers that the next one or two appointments

&gt; &gt; unexpected death, it will remain a conservative leaning court for
&gt; &gt; another decade.

If they elect and re-elect people to represent them, then isn't that the

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You think you can make nice with the left. You think compromises can

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that moderate positions will solve all problems, and as I pointed out,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; some cases there is no moderate position and in others the moderate
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; position
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; only serves to exacerbate the problem.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Have you ever read here, where I've said many times...&quot;there are

&gt;&gt; &gt; are
&gt;&gt; &gt; also many, many more &quot;compromise&quot; ones.  The problem with &quot;compromise&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; is that the zealots of both sides cannot get, or take, credit when
&gt;&gt; &gt; compromise is achieved.  Who loses?.....the people of the United States
&gt;&gt; &gt; of America.

&gt;&gt; &gt; By all likelihood, Rudy Guiliani or Fred Thompson (outside chance of
&gt;&gt; &gt; John McCain...all others need not apply, you're wasting taxpayer
&gt;&gt; &gt; funds...while we are at it, the same holds if your a Democratic
&gt;&gt; &gt; candidate and your name is not Clinton or Obama) will be the Republican
&gt;&gt; &gt; nominee for POTUS.  Talk about two men willing to compromise on most
&gt;&gt; &gt; issues.  Are they what's &quot;wrong&quot; with the Republican Party?  Look at
&gt;&gt; &gt; Mitt Romney.....he passed health care in Massachusettes as a Republican
&gt;&gt; &gt; Governor, is he &quot;wrong&quot; with the Republican Party?  We don't even have
&gt;&gt; &gt; to mention John McCain, who sat in a rat's hell of a box for half a
&gt;&gt; &gt; decade of his life....you know he's &quot;wrong&quot;, as well because of his
&gt;&gt; &gt; positions, correct?

&gt;&gt; Your statements only serve to illustrate my point. The Republican party
&gt;&gt; should be nominating people like Tom Delay for President. Someone who
&gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt; stand up to the left and tell them they are wrong.

&gt;&gt; The people you cite above only serve to water down the Republican party,
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; yes, I blame them for doing it and you for accepting it.

&gt; First, I'm one of those that do it, that's how I earn my
&gt; living....contesting and winning elections, along with some media,
&gt; Hollywood type work.  The day the Republican Party nominates Tom Delay
&gt; for President is the day that it guarantees the worst defeat, nationally
&gt; and in every Congressional and Senate race, ever.  I can't address Tom
&gt; Delay any further.  Suffice it to say, he would not make a good neighbor
&gt; much less a terrible President.  He would be worse than Hoover and
&gt; Carter combined.

&gt; The Republican Party is just that, a party.  It's inclusive of those who
&gt; believe more in it than any other party.  At the same time, that means
&gt; it excludes others.  You may wish to hold your nose, in your opinion,
&gt; and vote for the elephants.  I can live with that because you're voting
&gt; Republican.  At the same time though, you're not really a Republican,
&gt; you are closer to a Libertarian but you know that no Libertarian will
&gt; ever come close to election.
">

It's better to stand on principle and lose than compromise away your true
beliefs and win, since you wouldn't really be winning anyway.

I think a candidate who tells the truth about the left would do a *lot*
better than you think. That's why Rush Limbaugh has over 20 million
listeners.

LOL! A true caring society would provide me with a Maserati too! That's what
I think a caring society should do.

A tougher stance needs to be taken. When Rudy took a tough stance against
welfare recepients in NY, the welfare rolls went way down.

Basically what you are saying here is &quot;Since no one wants to pay for the kid
after he/she is born, let's kill him/her before he/she is born and not have
to deal with it&quot;.

There are lots of ways to effect social behavior. You can start small with
these stupid PSA's and work your way up to serious jail time for offenders
who keep having kids and can't afford to pay for them. If you make an
example out of some, the rest will fall in line.

The approach here isn't to worry about the kids too much, we only have a
zillion social programs to deal with that now, the approach is to cut off
the problem where it really lies, with the irresponsible parents.

&gt; How will using strategic reserves and unused resources from Florida's

&gt; Don't hold his views or he himself up to anyone as a moral authority.

&gt; Middle Eastern dictators and the Chinese are buying up America because
&gt; we won't balance our own national checkbook.  To do that we can cut
&gt; spending, raise revenue or do both.  If we cut spending, it's going to
&gt; be across the board, that's the politics so we will be hurting a number

It's the truth, and *drastic* measures need to be taken to reverse it.

You probably won't believe this, but I voted for Ross Perot instead of
George Bush 41. All my Republican friends told me I was wasting my vote and
that people like me would make Clinton President. Maybe I did, and I can
live with that because I did so based on my principles.

I told them that GB 41 had let me down and had not carried on the Reagan
Revolution. He had wallowed in a lot of the leftist issues you and I are
discussing (arguing about?) now instead of governing from the right. I said
he deserved to lose.

That aside, one of the other reasons I voted for Perot was something he said
on Larry King Live. I'll paraphrase - &quot;They're going to fly coach, they're
going to eat a bad meal, they're going to see how real Americans live&quot;. He
was talking about Congress. And even if he was wrong about everything else,
Perot was right about this. Congress has become a bunch of elites, totally
out of touch with the people, and that, first and foremost, needs to change.

&gt;&gt; foot the bill and the skaters will continue to skate.

&gt; Ah, now, finally...you're getting at a root problem, namely that the
&gt; federal government spends too much money compared to what it takes in.
&gt; Sadly, as much as it pains me and many other Republicans, the current
&gt; administration has given us a deficit hellhole that is staggering,

&gt; one it replaced years ago. They spent like the opposition. Now, Iraq was
&gt; an equally large reason but runaway spending hurt just as much.

&gt; So what do you cut?  As long as we are a democracy and neither party has
&gt; enough votes to sustain a veto, it's going to have to be shared
&gt; pain......social spending and decreased business subsidies in order to
&gt; reduce the federal deficit.

As I said in another part of the thread, *drastic* measures need to be
taken.

If I were President, I'd shut down the government, if necessary, until I got
a budget that cut everything by at least 5% initially. Across the board,
except defense. Cut Congressional staffers. Cut Congressional perks. Cut all
budgets. Washington is now an industy instead of a government. Some of the
people there need to find real jobs.

I would then go to the American people and explain why the entitlement era
needed to end. I would attempt to get government totally out of things
government should not be involved in, like Medicare and Social Security.

In order to straighten out this country, a mini-revolution in terms of how
we are governed needs to take place. I'm under no illusions that it will.

Oh gosh, this is about to become very personal but most of what I'm

things I've written over the years...

TC...I am a CEO of a major corporation.  I am fortunately blessed to
have a very good life.  I put myself through school and I am a self made
individual.  How much from people like myself, makes it down to people
like yourself?  Trust me, it doesn't work.  If Congress wants to give me
a tax break, I'll take it, who wouldn't?  The idea of trickle down is
that the wealthy will reinvest in jobs and give to charity.  I'm not
going to say what we (my family) donate (or to whom), that's nobody's
business but ours.  I do know that many who are among the wealthiest
donate very little.  Look to the tax records released by some of the
highest officials in this nations of both parties, to get an idea of
that as they are also some of the nations's wealthiest people.  They got
into politics because their wealth allowed them the time etc. to do so.
Trickle down for jobs is largely a joke in corporate America.  CEO's
care about stock holders more than employees and they/I better because
those are the people who own the company.  Lean, mean, fighting machine
business organizations are the most profitable.  That means minimal
raises, benefit packages etc. for employees.  That means you pay more
for your health insurance and the company co-pay decreases.  That's
simple economics, pure and simple. It's also the American way and I
agree with it.  At the same time, let's be honest and tell it like it
is.

Again, calling me left-leaning is a joke.  All of your heroes are people
that take my call and vice versa.  As I said, some/most are good people;

&gt; &gt; that is due to the fact that we do our job very well.  The larger part
&gt; &gt; is because these people represent what the real majority of Americans
&gt; &gt; want and believe in.  The rest are those in the area outside of the
&gt; &gt; curve and that's where you are. Nothing wrong with that but that's the
&gt; &gt; way it is.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The people mad at big business are generally the ones who don't have the
&gt; &gt;&gt; skills to be part of it.

&gt; &gt; You really believe that, don't you?

&gt; Yes. I know a lot of people who are fairly to very intelligent, but don't
&gt; apply themselves. Hence, they are doomed to driving the fork-lift instead of
&gt; running the shipping department.

&gt; &gt;&gt; As far as the flat tax goes, nothing will change. If the government wants
&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; continue to run with 4 TRILLION dollar budgets, the acheivers will have
&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; foot the bill and the skaters will continue to skate.

&gt; &gt; Ah, now, finally...you're getting at a root problem, namely that the
&gt; &gt; federal government spends too much money compared to what it takes in.
&gt; &gt; Sadly, as much as it pains me and many other Republicans, the current
&gt; &gt; administration has given us a deficit hellhole that is staggering,
&gt; &gt; especially considering that they came into office inheriting a budget
&gt; &gt; surplus.

&gt; &gt; Recently, I spoke before a moderate gathering of elected officials at a
&gt; &gt; party meeting.  One of the primary reasons for loss of Congressional
&gt; &gt; control was that the Republican majority in 2000 spent like the Democrat
&gt; &gt; one it replaced years ago. They spent like the opposition. Now, Iraq was
&gt; &gt; an equally large reason but runaway spending hurt just as much.

&gt; &gt; So what do you cut?  As long as we are a democracy and neither party has
&gt; &gt; enough votes to sustain a veto, it's going to have to be shared
&gt; &gt; pain......social spending and decreased business subsidies in order to
&gt; &gt; reduce the federal deficit.

&gt; As I said in another part of the thread, *drastic* measures need to be
&gt; taken.

&gt; If I were President, I'd shut down the government, if necessary, until I got
&gt; a budget that cut everything by at least 5% initially. Across the board,
&gt; except defense. Cut Congressional staffers. Cut Congressional perks. Cut all
&gt; budgets. Washington is now an industy instead of a government. Some of the
&gt; people there need to find real jobs.
">

Every taken a good look at a major defense contractor?  Please don't
think Halliburton is concerned about anything besides pure ROI profit.
Defense can take just as much a cut as everyone else can. The President
cannot do a darn thing about how Congress spends it own finances so
you're statement is 100 percent wrong on that one.

There is job waste in every corporation including the Federal
Government.  There are also far more, decent, hard working government
workers who could move into the public sector and earn more money but
they choose not to for whatever reasons they have.  Be careful what you
wish for, those people could be better qualified for your own position.

It is simply and totally irresponsible to shut down the government.  You
do that and you shut down both the Pentagon and Social Security.  So you
will compromise our national defense as well as deny the elderly their
checks on time?  Sheep and shepherds again, TC, sheep and shepherds.  It
doesn't matter if it comes from the wingnut left or right.  Both groups
are used by/for their respective parties, majority wishes.

No, I'm not missing the point. Actually, quite the opposite.....like I
said in my talk that I mentioned in another post.....there's a need to
be fiscally responsible, there's a need to address the realities of
Iraq, there's a need to admit that it's time to show real political
courage and &quot;straight talk&quot; with the American people.  The first party
to do so will govern in power for a long, long time.  John McCain was on
the right track in 2000 in that regard.  Perhaps the wrong
messenger...history will be the final judge on that....but on the right
track.

They don't for a number of reasons, not all of them positive.  It's
politically easier to &quot;use&quot; them rather than cast them adrift.  Every so
often both sides cast them a bone or two to keep them busy while the
real politics goes on.  In an ideal world, both parties would cut their
wingnuts out and we'd, probably, have a three party system of: far left
liberals, far right conservative, and everyone else.  That's not

&gt; Maybe, but it still seems to me we have a particularly watery group of

&gt; &gt;&gt; Again, your explanation is the knee-jerk reaction of a leftist. Since

&gt; &gt;&gt; what do we get? Right, more and more bad behavior.

&gt; &gt; You know, calling me a leftist really shows how far from the norm you

Say what you want, TC....I met Ronald Reagan and I worked to get him
elected POTUS twice.  That was his position, deal with it.  He was a
true conservative Republican and not a wingnut.  He was also a practical
politician who knew the full ability of being able to lead through
strength.  That also meant he knew how to placate the wingnuts to get
the real work done.

Those are the kinds of liberals that conservatives, real conservatives
