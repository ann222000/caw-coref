I just recently got a Sun Conure and I need some experienced advice.
Sunny is on a pellet diet and I give him an apple slice daily.  I
bought him some fresh spinach today but not sure how or how much to
feed him.  Am also  wanting to know what else fresh to feed him.

Also he has a couple of hanging toys but I think he needs more.  Any
suggestions?  I want to do the best for him.

Also any suggestions on training techniques would be appreciated.  He
loves to bite and will not willingly get off of me.  I have to chase
him all over me trying to get him to perch and put him in his cage.
But I love him!

Hi we are owned by a Sun Conure called Micky.  Mick is on both pellet
and seed we feed him fresh fruit such as orange apple pear banana
cherries (minus seed they are poisonous) lychees longans corn peas
beans carrot celery ie everything but onion avocado and chocolate.. he
will eat absolutely any meat and will hurt you if you get between him
and a spare rib. loves anything we are trying to eat and pines for
chinese food. Nuts are a fav especially walnuts and he loves to wash it
down with any form of juice you have...Micky is 2 and a half and has
free roam of the boat we live on... he flies everywhere so gets plenty
of exercise, flew outside once and didnt like it one bit flew straight
back..we have heaps of pics and vids if you want them let me know....

Your Sun Conure can eat almost everything that you can. Make sure you
avoid unsafe foods. There are several lists of unsafe foods available
online; here is one example:

http://www.avianweb.com/toxicfoods.html

If he has access to pellets and a variety of foods, I wouldn't worry
about portions for fresh food-offer him a reasonable amount of as
wide a variety as you can and make sure you remove anything that's not
eaten after a few hours to avoid him eating spoiled food. For the most
part, vegetables are more nutritious than fruits, so I would try to
offer more of those.

I like to keep a variety of toys on hand that are rotated every week or
so to keep my bird interested. The main concerns with toys are safety,
appropriateness for your bird's size, and your bird's personal tastes.
The last you'll need to figure out on your own, but there are articles
available on the web that can help you choose appropriate and safe toys
for your bird. Here are some examples:
