Dear Sensei Hayes (and list),

I've been enjoying the monthly dvd's a great deal, and recently
recieved your Kenjutsu Kihon dvd which has really helped me to focus
and clarify my training on that front.

In the Kenjutsu Kihon dvd as well as in one of the monthlies, a sword
has appeared from time to time with a square tsuba and a short,
slightly curved blade.

Most readers will know that the 'square tsuba myth' has been 'debunked'
repeatedly on both kutaki.org and ebudo by those who...ahem...like to
consider themselves VERY much in the know in terms of all things
Hatsumi and ninjutsu.

My feeling is that the appearance of this sword in your recent videos
is no mere happenstance, and so I would like to take this opportunity
to re-open the files on this case yet again.

(here goes)

One main argument that has come up against the idea of a square tsuba
is something along the lines of: &quot;Come on guys, be real here. If
ninjas used square tsubas, then anyone seen walking around with a
square tsuba on their sword would be killed.&quot;

That argument is more often than not issued with an air of finality,
rendering further speculation moot in the face of such cool clarity.
It never sat very well with me. Here are some ideas as to why:

1. Maybe they did wear them in the open. If so, then this would
indicate to me that they were either REALLY brave or REALLY stupid or
maybe that there was once a clan or something known for using a square
tsuba, and so they could do so without anyone caring or associating
such a thing with ninja.

2. Maybe they didn't wear them in the open. Maybe such a thing was an
exclusive tool for use in private. Maybe, at that point, if someone
did see it, it would be the last thing they ever saw. &quot;If you can read
this you're too close&quot; and that sort of thing.

I was also trying to think of some ideas as to why a square tsuba might
be useful:

1. Square wheels don't roll very well. This can be a boon when
dealing with steep, smooth inclines like rooftops, castle walls and
that sort of thing. Put your sword down for a moment and - look! -
there it goes! Skittering down off the edge of the roof and bonking
that poor guard off the head. Put the square-tsuba'd sword down and -
poof - it stays put, like ninja magic. Not having to worry about your
sword staying quietly where you put it is good, methinks.

2. Traps. With a square tsuba, you can put your sword on the ground
edge up and it will stay that way. That would be dangerous, though,
because then someone coming up behind you could step on it and...I'm
sure no ninja ever wanted that!

3. The climbing thing. All the teenage Noda-city wunderkids love to
laugh at this one, but I think it has merit. The simple, square tsuba
leaves a greater amount of surface area to step up on, and that surface
area makes for a much easier time of retrieving the sword with your
foot afterwards.

&quot;That's stupid,&quot; they'll retort, &quot;when they could just do shoten jutsu
and run up the wall, or leap that high.&quot;

Try doing shoten quietly up a thin wood and rice-paper wall. Same with
leaping. I may be reaching here, but I think it safe to say that some
situations require a greater degree of delicacy than others.

4. Weapon unto itself. I can imagine some nasty chokes and strikes
with that tsuba.

5. Tool unto itself. I can imagine a bit of prying and such with that
tsuba. With the short length of the sword you could probably have used
it like a crowbar in certain situations.

But no, the square tsuba is a Myth. EVERYONE knows that!

Except, perhaps, poor kindly and deluded sensei Hayes, who is soooo
passe and has clearly been reading too much Ashida Kim and not spending
enough time in Noda strutting about and schmoozing with the elites and
so on.

; )

Thoughts?

The square tsuba makes an appearance in the Ohara series by Stephen K.
Hayes as well - I believe in Volume 3, Warrior Path of Togakure. One of
the reasons listed there is that square tsuba are, frankly, quick and
easy to make. Take some iron, cut it into roughly whatever shape your
skill and time permit, and stick it on the blade you salvaged from the
battlefield or forged yourself.

One thing that has kept cropping up in my research over and over is
that what we envision as the typical samurai (nice katana, oyoroi
armor, silk kimono, etc.) was in fact a very tiny percentage of the
population, the wealthy ruling class that could afford all the
niceties. Then, as now, having elaborate swords crafted cost money, and
the better the quality, the greater the cost. There was no Wal-Mart or
anything of the like to push down manufacturing costs back then. (and
would you really want to fight a battle for the survival of your
village with Wal-Mart equivalent goods if you didn't have to?)

The square tsuba, like everything else, is likely what ninja of yore
made if resources were not sufficient for something else. A modern
comparison today would be to go to any gun shop, like the Kittery
Trading Post in Maine, and see the vast scale and range of firearms
available. Not everyone will be able to afford the Beretta 92FS (MSRP
$715) but watching movies like Lethal Weapon would have you believe
that they're cheap and commonly available.

Interesting post...

Due to the sarcastic tone of the post I can only assume that you aren't
looking for real input, rather you are just trying to poke fun at the &quot;
teenage Noda-city wunderkinds&quot; as you call them. So instead of spending the
time on a long response, which I am sure others will oblige you with, I will
throw out responses to three of your ideas:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;1. Square wheels don't roll very well. This can be a boon when

"/> This might be valid if the sword had no sori, but due to the curve of the
blade (an accompanying saya) you don't need a square tsuba to stop the sword
from rolling. Just take an iaito and lay it down on a slope and watch how
it magically stays in place.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

to climb up the interior wall to what, the ceiling?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;4. Weapon unto itself. I can imagine some nasty chokes and strikes

"/> I would hope that when studying daisho sabaki and associated taijutsu
methods that you are learning this already without the need for the square
tsuba. This is a common piece of many bujutsu arts, not only ours...

IIRC, by the Shogun himself at one point)? The
spy/assassains of the Tokugawa era?

My favorite example is the &quot;US Army Rangers&quot; -- there
are those that love to talk about them as if they were
always the way they are right now, but there's a long
history to them. Started in the Vermont Militia, IIRC,
during the American Revolution -- back woodsmen who
knew their thing. Then there's the paratroopers of
WWII and our modern Rangers.

Of course when I say that most people are gonna think
of the 101st Airborne, but there's a *lot* more than
that even today.

So *which* ninja would have gotten killed by using
square Tsuba? Iga no Mono of the civil war? Ronin of
the same era?

Okay, so maybe the square Tsubas would have been &quot;out
of line&quot; for the Shogun's &quot;Garden Posts&quot; (ninja
spies/bodyguards that pretended to be gardeners) ...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Like the &quot;Jutsu/Jitsu&quot; thing, ne?

I had always been taught that the &quot;proper&quot; way to
pronounce it was &quot;Jutsu&quot;, but then I started learning
Japanese where I learned that the Japanese drop both
&quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; on a regular basis ... that &quot;j'ts&quot;
(&quot;Jutsu&quot;) sounds very much like (&quot;j'ts&quot;)(&quot;Jitsu&quot;).

Then I learned that, &quot;especially among the older
generation&quot; (Pre WWII?), the two are interchangable
...

I would say to take a look this in light of history;
the answer will change based on who and what you are
talking about. Chris' post, for example, seems
perfectly accurate (to me) if we're talking about the
Iga-no-Mono before Nobunaga invaded.

Hope this helps ...

The question has gotten me a bit curious so I did some brief research.

From a quick look at a few books I have I found a few prints showing
quite clearly swords with square tsuba. The most notable one was by
Shunkosai Hokushu which Shows the Character Nikki Danjo wearing swords
with a definite square tsuba. The print dates to the early 1800s, so it
does not offer proof that such swords were common in medieval Japan, but
it does show they are not a creation of modern day Hollywood.

Another picture shows Ikko-Ikki warrior monks brandishing swords with a
squarish (slightly rounded corners) tsuba. However I haven't found a
date for this one yet.

On the matter of using it as a step I found this interesting reference
in the Tanki Yoriaku Written by Hayakawa Kyuukei in 1735:

&quot;When climbing over a high wall take your mask off and place your sword
vertically. Put your arm in the sword knot, making it as long as
possible, and use the tsuba for a step.&quot;

I don't really follow what is being said here, though the reference to
using the tsuba as a step is fairly clear. Perhaps the bit about the
sword knot is so you can pull your sword up after you. I would doubt
that the reason for making the tsuba square would have anything to do
with this, but once again there is at least some historical precedence
for the tsuba being used in such a manner, though how far back it would
go I do not know.

This weekend I will be on vacation with an SCA group (Society for
Creative Anachronism, medieval recreation group) and know of a couple
people there that are fairly knowledgeable of Japanese arms and armour.
I will see if they have any documentation or information that might be
useful.

Your outside of a building at night, having passed your dice roll to
hide in shadows and all that.

There's a window of sorts a little more than a foot or so above your
head. People are talking inside and you'd very much like to hear what
they're saying. You want to get close and maybe even take a quick peak.

Do you:

A. Yell for them to speak up a bit.
B. Look around and hope you can find a lawn ornament or some such thing
to stand on.
C. Practice your shinobi leaping skills to catch one or two words at a
time here and there.
D. Reach up, grab the edge of the window in your strong grip and hoist
yourself quietly and slowly up.
E. Lean your round-tsuba'd sword against the wall and use the tsuba of
that to help you up to where you want to be.
F. Lean your short, square-tsuba'd sword against the wall and use the
tsuba of that to help you up to where you want to be.

Most folks at this point would probably choose option D, and I'm with
them all the way.

But . . .

Supposing the edge of that window is rotted, or has some decorative bit
of moulding or something around it (to accent the lawn ornaments) which
your expert eye tells you will bend, creak or even break off in a moment
if you were to hang on it with your full weight. Supposing this is
going to be a loooong conversation. Can you hold on that long and still
concentrate on what they're saying? And be aware of your surroundings
in case someone approaches from behind or something.

Let's just suppose at this point that you're at least willing to
consider options E and F.

Now let's suppose that you've got a short sword in a long saya, which
everyone who's anyone now knows is the be-all and end-all, the alpha and
the omega of ninpo sword craft. You lean it against the wall and . . .
whoa that's an awful high step there, but let's just say, what with your
lifetime of flexibility training and such it poses no problem for you,
and then . . . whoa, that's pretty wobbly, what with that finely worked
round tsuba you've got there, but hey, you've trained hard and you can
balance yourself perfectly and . . . whoa! SNAP! Forgot about the
space you left for all that metsubishi, which left your weight being
supported by a few inches of wood with no steel to back it up.

Hey, maybe it breaks, maybe it doesn't. Maybe you don't mind the
wobbling, maybe you do. Maybe there's some fancy footwork that could
make that first step easy. Maybe maybe maybe. That's three maybe's, at
least. Three vague points of potential failure to bet your life and
successful outcome of your intentions on. Fine.

Now let's suppose you've got a short sword with a square tsuba. Maybe
the saya is an inch or two longer than the blad and maybe not, but as
the saya is not for everyday use, it has been fashioned according to
your needs in the field rather than fashionable preferences. The whole
package is a good deal straighter than usual, and perhaps even
reinforced, giving a nice and solid structural integrity to the
sword/saya combo. You lean it against the wall and step up to where you
can control your height with ease. It's not a big step at all. Once
your up there, you spare a moment to marvel at how stable and quiet a
platform (like Linux) the square tsuba makes. Regardless of what kind
of surface it's leaning against, or how wet that surface is or whatever,
it doesn't move a bit, provided you keep the lateral movement to a
minimum, which is much easier now that you don't have to struggle in any
way to keep your balance. Finally, it doesn't break. But you knew it
wouldn't, because you've practiced and perhaps done this many times before!

Wow! It now seems a no-brainer that one would use the length of the
sword knot string thingy to retrieve the sword rather than fumbling for
with your foot as I had suggested earlier. Your findings also seem to
suggest that there may be some support for the idea of the square tsuba
being particular to a certain clan. Not proof or anything, but
certainly evidence.

Thanks for looking into this.

I only ask one question............... Other than for the history lesson,
what is the use in todays modern society is one going to use the tsuba for. I
know this all started form An Shu Hayes' videos, but isn't his point of teachings
is to learn to apply them to the times of now, not hundereds of years ago.
Don't get me wrong I am all for the traditional teachings, but again it is how
you apply it in modern Self Defense.... I should Hope anyway?

just a thought.

I agree that learning how to apply things in modern society is
important, and most likely the focal point of any good self-defense
training. However, sometimes it helps to understand why a particular
technique or piece of equipment evolved the way it did. To really adapt
something to modern use its good to have a deep understanding of its
original context.

And some of us are just history buffs that can't help ourselves.

You pose a fair question.

I think the responsibility is ours as students to begin to draw our own
lessons from whatever we can learn of the strategies and tools of the
past. Sensei Hayes and others like him have worked so hard for so long
to prove time and time again that things which at first glance seem
utterly outdated or anachronistic can actually have some very close
parallels in modern times.

What's the modern parallel for a classical sword with a square tsuba? I
honestly have no idea, and won't until I learn more about whether or not
such a tool existed, and if so how it was used and why and so on. Only
then can we really begin to draw conclusions that are based on something
other than idle speculation or mistaken confidence in incorrect conclusions.

To me, it's exciting to explore the possiblity that many of us may have
been very wrong in the conclusions we may have drawn concerning this
weapon. I myself have been on both sides of the 'square tsuba' fence at
one time or another, and I'd very much like to ferret out what the truth
is behind all this. I'm not too concerned just yet as to how to apply
it today. The simple fact that sensei Hayes, THE foremost authority on
ninjutsu in the western world, has seen fit to show this weapon in his
training tells me that there is something to be learned there.

We can brush it off as nothing, or sit around and hope someone who
'knows better' spoon feeds us some truth . . . or we can show a little
initiative and work on it ourselves.

I've got to say, I'm also curious to see how the 'highly opinionated
gentlemen who desire respect, revenue and renown for living and training
or having lived and trained in Japan' (that wasn't sarcastic, was it?)
respond if and when they find some of their own precious conclusions on
this subject to be eroneous. I'm much more interested in the hearts
and minds of my fellow budoka than I am in their ranks and resumes.

I bear in mind, of course, that sensei Hayes may have thrown those
swords in his videos for people like *me* to hook our egos on and make
fools of ourselves! All part of the fun in ninja training. Another
chance to practice my ukemi.

Lot's to be learned here, in any event, if you ask me.

Hi Kent, always a pleasure to read your posts. I loved the allusion to
role playing games - nice!

Anyway, just to throw a few points in regarding this topic.

Did straight swords exist or were they a product of Edo period media or
Hollywood or what?

The simple answer is yes, straight swords existed. They were called
&quot;chokuto&quot; and they were an early form of Japanese sword dating mostly
from around 646-794AD. Source - The Japanese Sword by Gregory Irvine,
V&amp;A Publications, ISBN 1851773142, page 13. These chokuto are not the
same as the ken shown on Hatsumi sensei's DVD &quot;Ken Tachi Katana&quot;.
Imagine a katana that's straight instead of curved.

Were there such things as square tsuba?

Again the simple answer is yes. You can see one on page 162 of Arms &amp;
Armour of the Samurai by Ian Bottomley and A. P. Hopson, Saturn Books,
ISBN1862220026. This page, which shows all manner of tsuba even
includes one that is skull shaped! As an interesting aside, while in
Japan in 2003 I visited a shop in Suidobashi that sold nothing but
shinai, bokken and related materials. I bought a tsuba that is almost
square - it just has a little cut-out in each corner.

So to bring this back to the topic.

I'm not saying that these examples are of &quot;ninja swords&quot;. I'm simply
pointing out that warriors could quite easily have been walking around
in everyday life, wearing swords with straight blades and square tsuba
without attracting too much attention.

Mind you the black mask was a dead giveaway.....

Mountain Warrior,

Thanks for the feedback. Were the tsuba you saw in your travels truly
'square' or more 'squarish', with rounded corners? I've seen some
'squarish' ones, but the shape really just seemed to be a purely
decorative variation on the usual oval/circular shape we see.

Also of interest, the sword I see in the Quest dvd's has a distinct
curve to it, which is why I didn't bring up the chokuto reference myself.

Thanks,

-Kent

The one I mentioned in the book is almost square, just with a slight
curve to the sides and the corners rounded. The tsuba I bought in
Suidobashi is again almost square but the corners have little cutouts.
Thinking about the &quot;using the sword as a step up&quot; discussion, I don't
think that the tsuba would need to be perfectly square for this
purpose. A round one of course would wobble a lot but I think that
even a square-ish tsuba would provide a stable enough platform.

Thinking on these lines, here's a thought. Let's say a sword was
indeed being used for this purpose. Anyone leaning a sword against a
wall risked having the tsuba making a scraping noise. Would it not be
feasible that such activity would involve the tsuba being wrapped with
a few strips of cloth to muffle any noise? This would have the added
side effect of protecting the tsuba from scratches which could be
something of a giveaway if the ninja was caught shortly afterwards.

Another thing to consider is the ground surface that the saya would be
resting upon during the activity. If it was a soft flowerbed for
example, then the saya would sink into the ground leaving a &quot;footprint&quot;
which might let the guards know someone had been around. If it was a
hard surface e.g. paving slabs then the ninja would have to be careful
again that any potential scraping noises were muffled with cloth.

Just some rambling thoughts on the subject.

I haven't seen that Quest DVD I'm afraid so I can't comment. I only
brought the chokuto reference up myself as it seemed to have some
relevance to the general topic of discussion.

Rather than an academic discussion, I thought I'd actually give this
sword/tsuba thing a try, and make the extensive climb up to my deck
(all of 4 feet) in my backyard with a sword &amp; tsuba. Lessons learned:

[1] Even wedged between the ground and the side of the deck, stability
leaves a lot to be desired.

[2] Granted, it was using a cheap stainless steel sword with an
aluminum saya that I picked up in Chinatown for $30, but the sword
didn't fare so well. The blade is clearly bent a little, and the saya
is very unhappy with me. Perhaps a wood saya would have held up better.

[3] Tsuba are very small. I couldn't get much purchase even wearing
Tevas. Barefoot was okay, and I didn't have any tabi on hand to try
those. Maybe with a gigantic tsuba it would have been better, but maybe
not.

[4] If I were being pursued, the amount of time it took to set the
thing up, check its stability, and clamber up it would have given any
nearby pursuer time enough for a sandwich and a cup of coffee.

[5] If I were trying to be stealthy, again, lots of set up time, but
any wobble made a nice grating sound against the deck. Not to mention
the thoroughly unskillful profanities from falling off.

My personal conclusion for my own training - sword != ladder. Perhaps
with lots more practice and a better quality sword, I could turn it
into something workable, but tsuba or not, square or not, it's a pain
in the saya. For now, I'll stick to using a sword as an actual sword,
until someone comes along and teaches me how to do it properly.

Your mileage may vary.

Next up, I think, on the experimental archaeology front, is 'sword as
gardening implement'.

More soon, after I weed through the possibilities...

My neighbors are very tolerant folks!

On a serious note, though, to me this is very much part of the To-Shin
Do spirit. It's important to know and understand the historical
background of what we do and why we do it, but it's even more important
to know if we can practically apply it today, ourselves, personally. We
can theorize at our keyboards until the end of time, but going out and
trying stuff, seeing if things work for us, is part of taking the
legacy of the past into the future.

The lesson can be expanded even further, if you look at it as meta-data
and not as content in itself. What things do you regularly carry with
you that could serve as climbing implements? I don't regularly carry a
sword on my person nowadays, but I sure do carry a laptop bag and more
cabling than I care to think about - and I also know from experience
that the network cabling is not strong enough to support any meaningful
amount of weight. You can't stand on a machete you buy at Wal-Mart,
either - they're too brittle and snap right above the handle. You CAN
use a laptop's security cable for climbing - the steel cable can handle
quite a load, and makes a darned useful kusarifundo in a pinch, too.

Square tsuba, round tsuba, if it doesn't work/doesn't apply to how you
currently live your life, then it's probably great for Trivial Pursuit:
Sengoku Jidai Edition but not much else...

All great points, especially about the tolerant neighbors. I wear a
suit of 9th century armor and practice shots against a pell made of old
tires in my yard, I'm sure they think I'm completely nuts by now.
They're probably right.

There really is nothing like hands on experience to test the
practicality of something. I know that I am way to heavy to balance on
the tsuba of a sword without doing serious damage to myself or the
sword, though in my younger lighter days I think I could have managed.
Either way its never seemed a terribly practical method of gaining a few
feet to get over a wall to me. Not the most practical solution to a
problem, but a useful one if no better solution is at hand.

I think the real value of such questions is pretty much what you've
said, it gets us thinking of different ways of looking at things. If
you continually force yourself to think in a somewhat non-linear fashion
it tends to become second nature. Seeing whats possible instead of
whats expected is a useful skill in just about anything you do, be it
To-Shin-Do or corporate strategy.

I have a chokuto with a square tsuba, and I'm planning on buying a black
chokuto...also with a square tsuba.

Just got back from a little experimenting of my own. My results
differed from those of Chris, in that my swords (1 'chinatown special'
and 1 much stronger 'practical' type katana) didn't bend or break, and
the tsubas didn't break or bend either. One sword did, however, suffer
some damage to the little metal 'kojiri' cap on the butt end of the
handle. The ground next to the wall where I placed the sword (in saya)
was soft, and as it sank with my weight, the little cap thingy got pried
off as it when down over the edge of a shingle.

So what I learned about 'climbing/spying with swords' pretty much
matched my expectations. On a hard surface, the round saya makes for a
very unstable mount, rolling side to side and sliding away very easily.
On a soft surface, the end of the saya can be pushed into the ground,
giving stability. With stability, I found that by stepping with my left
foot first, toes pointing the right centered over the edge of the tsuba,
I was then able to lean in close to the wall and push up with that leg.
As soon as you're up, the right foot goes with the same alignment onto
the very butt end of the sword handle. This lets you take the some of
the pressure off the tsuba alone, and uses more of the length of the
weapon to support you instead.

I currently can't do this without some little something on the wall for
my fingers to grip just a bit, so that could certainly be a limitation.
Once up, I could change my height with relative ease, as if 'peeking' in
a window and then down again or whatever.

It was clear to me that a shorter sword/saya and a large, square tsuba
would REALLY help in this situation, allowing me, I believe, to climb up
even if the sword is resting on a hard surface. The square edge of the
tsuba would stop it from rocking side to side. The shorter length would
be easier to mount, for me and slightly shorter folks alike. Training
and design could make this work very well, I think.

Useful now or in the historical past? That's for anyone to judge. I
can imagine a lot of situations in a classical espionage milieu in which
being able to gain a couple feet of height quietly and easily could be
of real use.

I'll pick up one of those little black wooden 'ninja' swords when I get
a chance, and experiment a bit with that. I have a feeling though that
the plastic or wooden tsuba on one of those would simply break, but who
knows.

Also bear in mind that we're only looking at one (the most popular and
contested) aspect of how a square (large square, not decoratively
'squarish') tsuba and straighter blade could be of real use.

A sword with a square tsuba WILL NOT ROLL when placed down on an
inclined surface. Someone said earlier that a round-tsuba'd sword will
not roll either. In that person's experience, such may be true, but
when I place my round-tsuba'd sword on, say, a picnic table, and then
start lifting up one edge, I don't have to go too steep before that
sucker (first) flops over and (second, after lifting a bit further)
rolls off completely. Maybe he tried it with a Meiji-era short handled
sword, I don't know. Maybe those behave differently.

In an espionage setting, do you want (a) a sword that MAY NOT roll,
depending on this or that, although it will probably wiggle and clatter
a bit unless you're really careful, or (b) a sword that WILL NOT roll
even when resting on a very steep incline. Personally, I'd want to
eliminate any all all gray areas I could, but that's just me. I'd go
for the tool that stays where I put it, no ifs ands or buts. I'd also
want each tool I have in my arsenal to serve as many functions as
humanly possble, while remaining as streamlined and simple as possible.

I would also want a sword that's not too large, because I'm not planning
on hewing my way on horseback through throngs of bloodthirsty
barbarians, or showing down against Musashi to save my clan from
dishonor. Rather, I'm ultimately not looking to encounter or fight
anyone at all. I want something that's there when I need it and out of
the way when I don't.

We also mentioned choking, and someone mentioned that 'xyz ryu' already
has this covered somehow. That doesn't really matter. What matters is,
would you rather be choked out with an elegantly curved and decorated
little round tsuba, or a great big square thing. No doubt, it's gonna
hurt either way. You take your pick, I'll take mine.

There's also the idea of being able to lay the sword down, edge side up,
as a trap of sorts. Maybe this sounds ridiculous to people. I could
certainly grip about it in such a way as to write it off and make it
sound ridiculous, but, in a persuit sort of situation, how would you
feel about tripping (or being pushed or otherwise tricked or thrown --
by an 'unarmed' stranger, perhaps) and falling on such a thing? Would
it be funny or ridiculous or 'historically inaccurate' then?

Just thoughts!

PS

For those who are sighing heavily and wondering why I'm going on about
this, I urge you to get hold of the March 2005 Stephen K. Hayes Video
Private Lesson. In there, you will see a sword sitting in plain view
with a LARGE -- SQUARE -- UNDECORATED tsuba. It's right there, staring
you in the face.

So what do we do? Look aside and gag privately at how woefully
misguided and mistaken our beloved instructor Stephen K. Hayes is?
Pretend we don't see it?

I feel the challenge is on us, his students, to figure out why it is
there. As I said, I am willing to accept that it may be a trap to snare
overly-imaginative fools like me, but my . . . heart . . . tells me
otherwise, so I'm going on the assumption that the sword in that video
has EVERYTHING to do with ninjutsu, and that it's up to me to figure out
how, why, when, where and what. I wonder at those who can give this a
moment's thought and then shrug it off. Is our teacher just playing
around? Does he not 'know better' like those who self-proclaimed
'guides' have said 'case closed' on this?

I may be completely and utterly mistaken about the supposed advantages
of the short, square-tsuba'd sword, but it is very clearly there and
there for a reason.

I don't think we'll find the answers on Google, and I'm willing to bet
that if we flew to Japan tomorrow and asked Hatsumi himself, he'd
probably shrug it off and say something like, &quot;You only see those in
movies.&quot;

So what do we do? Ask sensei Hayes directly? We could, but I doubt
that he would present a puzzle only to give out the answer at the
slightest provocation . . .

Darn ninjas!
