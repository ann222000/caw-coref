Hello all,

I just finished tapping holes in my latest &quot;production run&quot; of five
plates (stop laughing&lt;g&gt;).  What is the most effective way to clear the
slurry of oil (which I have been using as a cutting fluid[*]) and
Aluminum chips that is dripping from the holes?

[*] haven't broken any taps in a long time, and the threads seem to work.

Thanks!

Bill

I use JP1 fuel or acetone. I'm sure it's the worst thing to use but it
degreases like a m-f... The JP1 leaves a oil to prevent rust but that's no
problem on your AL.

Spray bottle of kerosene, a scrub brush followed by compressed air (outside,

What I have done so far is run a machine screw through the hole using an
electric driver, wipe off the slurry, and reverse the screw, then follow
with household cleaner.  Your idea sounds worth a shot.  How does the
scrub brush enter into it?  The holes are 8-32.

Our shop uses compressed air to blow them out, making a
HORRENDOUS shrieking noise.  They all wear earplugs all day.

I use some stuff called alum-tap that is great for tapping
aluminum.  (I do some machine tapping at up to 1200 RPM for 4-40
threads.)  I then clean them out with my own scheme, which is
twirling the corner of a piece of paper towel into a point.  I
then poke it through the hole and twist it from the pointy end.
I can do this about as fast as the CNC tapping machine
drill-taps them.  I'm sure there is a better way.

The alum-tap is pretty thin stuff, and wipes off with paper
towels.  Nowhere as sticky as threading oil.

Sadly, I am using &quot;mystery oil&quot; (10W30??) from a cheap oil can that I
filled a long time ago.  I use it for things between light oil and
Vactra, which lives in the best working oiler I have on hand.

I use a mascara brush. it is like a miniature bottle washing brush.

...and cleaning swarf out of tapped holes is all I use it for :-)

If you have an ultrasonic cleaner put them in there with the holes up
(if they're blind). Poke a wire in each hole to dislodge any air
bubbles. Oil will rise up put of them like smoke from a chimney.

Slosh it around in some solvent?

Or blow it with compressed air (preferably outside).

I use kerosene or diesel fuel to lubricate when cutting alumimum and
that is a lot thinner than what you must be using.  It this case, the
cuttings (not sure what the &quot;slurry&quot; is) aren't so hard to get rid of
with compressed air.

Many methods work. Depends on how much work you want to do
and what your budget is like.... My home-shop method is the solvent
soak/wipe. I use isopropyl alcohol, which is somewhat less unhealthy
and safer than acetone. In the case of blind holes, I like to use a
syringe and some kind of needle to flush the hole with solvent. You
can always follow that with compressed air, as long as you don't
mind wearing some of the small chips that come out of the holes at
230 mph.
Ultrasonic cleaners are fabulous for this, but pricey for a good-size
one.

I've been having very good results with a water soluable synthetic(?)
cutting lubricant for drilling, tapping, sawing, knurling and turning on the
lathe.. steel, ss, brass and aluminum.

The stuff is marketed by Lenox (a cutting tool brand, band saw blades etc),
named Pro Tool Lube.  The label states that it contains no silicone, is
biodegradeable, and I think the stuff is glycerine-based.
It's given excellent performance for all the cutting tasks mentioned above,
and it rinses away with water, so I can shoot a stream of water from a
trigger-spray bottle into (or thru) holes to flush cutting chips out easily.

There is no troublesome film or oily residue remaining after a plain water
flush/rinse.
When I want to paint parts that I've used the PTL on, I don't need to do any
other preparation, other than what I'd normally do for bare metals.

Pipe cleaners work well, although the ones that are made for crafts seem to
be fuzzy synthetic stuff, and not like good 'ol fashioned pipe cleaners.
Gun cleaning bore brushes are handy too, and there are solvent-proof brushes
for cleaning the siphon tubes of paint spraying guns.

I get the Lenox PTL at Fastenal.

Tap Magic has a mild &quot;oily&quot; odor, not at all objectionable...  until it
burns.  If you use it as a cutting oil on a machine tool (lathe, mill, etc.)
that you are running hard enough that the smoke rolls, the smoke from Tap
Magic will do a number on your respiratory system.  But, for hand tapping,
etc., there is absolutely no problem.

I've been having very good results with a water soluable synthetic(?)
cutting lubricant for drilling, tapping, sawing, knurling and turning on the
lathe.. steel, ss, brass and aluminum.

The stuff is marketed by Lenox (a cutting tool brand, band saw blades etc),
named Pro Tool Lube.  The label states that it contains no silicone, is
biodegradeable, and I think the stuff is glycerine-based.
It's given excellent performance for all the cutting tasks mentioned above,
and it rinses away with water, so I can shoot a stream of water from a
trigger-spray bottle into (or thru) holes to flush cutting chips out easily.

There is no troublesome film or oily residue remaining after a plain water
flush/rinse.
When I want to paint parts that I've used the PTL on, I don't need to do any
other preparation, other than what I'd normally do for bare metals.

&gt; Hello all,

&gt; I just finished tapping holes in my latest &quot;production run&quot; of five plates
&gt; (stop laughing&lt;g&gt;).  What is the most effective way to clear the slurry of
&gt; oil (which I have been using as a cutting fluid[*]) and Aluminum chips
&gt; that is dripping from the holes?

Use a forming tap that doesn't leave chips?
