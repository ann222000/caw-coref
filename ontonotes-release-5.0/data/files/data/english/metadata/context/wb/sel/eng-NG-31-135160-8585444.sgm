Hello, all.  I'm having problems accessing certain websites.  In both
Safari and Firefox, I can't access most of the websites in my
bookmarks bar.  Firefox tells me it can't find the server at &quot;xxx&quot;.
Safari says &quot;You are not connected to the internet.&quot;

The sites that I can go to have current info, such as my bank giving
me current balances, or Coldwell Banker bringing up new listings, for
example.  I also am able to send and receive email.

My ISP says it's a firewall or something like that.  I'm on a G4
Powerbook, looked to the internet via Airport Extreme, which works
just fine from my son's PC laptop at the moment.

Thanks in advance,
Claire

Claire,

You might try plugging the ethernet of the Powerbook directly to the Airport
ethernet port.  If this solves the problem then you might need to use a
different wifi channel, it could be interference from your neighbors being
on the same channel.  Also, you did not mention if your son's PC notebook
was on wired Ethernet or wireless, or if you had tried the same websites
from the PC notebook (I am kind of hesitant to do anything financial in
Windows unless a Windows update has been done, the antivirus has been
updated, and the system has been scanned, and even then I am a bit nervous,
hence my conversion to Macs....).

If you still have trouble, then you might see if your ISP has some sort of
speed test.  The speed test should be run with only one computer active on
the connection, preferably on wired ethernet (so as to prevent possible
wireless interference from skewing the results) and the only application
accessing the Internet at the time to be the speed test (to get accurate
results).  Of course some processes in the background might be consuming
bandwidth so if you get one low result, run a few more tests and see if you
have some good results.  If your results are consistently way below what is
expected for your subscription rated speed, it could be poor sync (in the
case of DSL) or other issues (if cable related).

Here is the &quot;Speakeasy speed test&quot;, I just ran it on my DSL.  One thing to
consider is that &quot;IP protocol overhead&quot; will consume some of your bandwidth
too, unless your line is syncing faster than your subscribed rate (in the
case of DSL).

I hope this helps!

Make sure you do not have block popup windows turned on. I have found
that keeps me from accessing sites like that properly. Try turning
thaqt off if you hav e it turned on. Also make sure you are allowing
cookies from those sites.

David,

After reading your email, I put off doing this for a couple of days
because I knew I would need to dedicate some time at my computer to
do this.  In answer to your first questions, my son's PC was
connected via Airport, and he could access the websites that I could
not.

I disconnected the ethernet cable from the Airport and plugged it
into the Powerbook.  I began trying different things to connect, and
the whole thing seemed more scrambled than ever.  When I'm at another
location that doesn't have wireless internet, such as my sister's
house or some hotels, I just plug in the ethernet and go without a
hitch.  However, this began to get more complicated, bringing up
prompts that were asking for things I'd never heard of before.  So, I
disconnected both our cable modem and Airport from their power,
turned off the Powerbook, and went outside to feed the fish.

After about 15 minutes, I powered back on the cable modem and then
went to water the plants.  Then I powered on Airport, and went to add
water to the pond.  Then I powered on the Powerbook, and VOILA!  it
works!!!!!!!  Yeah!!!!!

This time around, I gave everything lots of time powered off, and
then I powered back on sequentially.  Also, feeding the fish probably
had something to do with it.

I am so-o-o-o-o grateful that this worked.  You know how it is when
you have to call your ISP and they say they know Macs, but they don't.

Thanks David for your input.  Thanks list for being here.

Claire
