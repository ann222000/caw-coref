Along with the water pump change, I'm replacing the coolant.  Of course, VW
dealership told me I should buy their red coolant because it's the best.  Is
there any reason I cant just get brand name red stuff from my auto parts
store and use it?

Sure, you can use any coolant that meets the VW G12 spec.
