The azalide antibiotic azithromycin and the newer macrolides, such
as clarithromycin, dirithromycin and roxithromycin, can be regarded as
'advanced-generation' macrolides compared with erythromycin, the first
macrolide used clinically as an antibiotic. Their pharmacokinetics are
characterized by a combination of low serum concentrations, high tissue
concentrations and, in the case of azithromycin, an extended tissue
elimination half-life. Azithromycin is particularly noted for high and
prolonged concentrations at the site of infection. This allows
once-daily dosing for 3 days in the treatment of respiratory tract
infections, in contrast to longer dosage periods required for
erythromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin and agents belonging to
other classes of antibiotics. The spectrum of activity of the
advanced-generation macrolides comprises Gram-positive, atypical and
upper respiratory anaerobic pathogens. Azithromycin and the active
metabolite of clarithromycin also demonstrate activity against
community-acquired Gram-negative organisms, such as Haemophilus
influenzae. Advanced-generation macrolides, and in particular
azithromycin, are highly concentrated within polymorphonuclear
leucocytes, which gravitate by chemotactic mechanisms to sites of
infection. Following phagocytosis of the pathogens at the infection
site, they are exposed to very high, and sometimes cidal, intracellular
concentrations of antibacterial agent. Pharmacodynamic models and
susceptibility breakpoints derived from studies with other classes of
drugs, such as the beta-lactams and aminoglycosides, do not adequately
explain the clinical utility of antibacterial agents that achieve high
intracellular concentrations. In the case of azithromycin, attention
should focus on tissue pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic concepts.
