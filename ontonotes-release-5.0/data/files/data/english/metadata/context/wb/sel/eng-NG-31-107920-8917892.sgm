Thanks - already seen now on tonight's BBC News (without Spanish
captions). I don't see what this adds to the race coverage. Seems
quite simple to me. Hamilton nearly caught the slowing SC and had to
take avoiding action. As a result, Webber had to brake to ensure he
didn't pass him. The &quot;boy&quot; behind him wasn't paying attention and
&quot;fucked up&quot;. So why &quot;investigate&quot; Hamilton now? Unless...

What they should be looking at was Hamilton's driving beghind the Safety car
all race long - I did think he was pushing the limits on that earlier in the
race when he appeared to try &amp; catch Alonso out at the rolling start. Indeed
Alonso says he passed Hamilton 2 or 3 times because the Ham kept stranding
on the brakes.

Ham has said today that what he was doing was necessary because McLaren were
running a hard brake pad. If that's the case then he's basically accepted
that he was driving less &quot;smoothly&quot; than he could have in order to drive
around the issue of his brake pads.

Those pads were his/his team's choice &amp; subsequently their problem to deal
with - they can't be used as an excuse for driving like a cock. He claims he
was on the radio telling McLaren to get Red Bull to get Webber to back off
because he thought there could be an accident. His (somewhat sanctimonious)
comment is now &quot;I guess I was right&quot;

http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=40921 refers

Hung by his own admission I'd say - its just a question of what the penalty
will be - anything from a $5000 fine to removal of his 10 points is an
option. My guess is a 10 place grid penalty in China is probably the most
likely outcome.

If you were to watch the clip carefully, you will see that
the SC was not slowing, it was taking the corners at
a constant and steady speed. LH was driving like a total
boy racer, an arse, and above his abilities for the conditions.
He did the same at the start of the race to FA.

If LH is given a 10 place grid penalty then we know it wont
be a race he can win, seeing as he only wins from pole.
This is a huge contrast to the achievement of KR, to come
from the back of the grid to finish 3rd. IMO this is a true
display of racing genius.

IMO that is a true display of rampant ignorance.

LH has shown that he is capable of driving through the whole field in
equal equipment in other series.

Nothing against Kimi but he did get a 60 second hand up thanks to
Alonso's accident. Which reminds me, who was the only championship
contender not to have an unprovoked spin or off track expedition during
the race? Were the other 3 all driving above their abilities for the
conditions?

Here here !!

I never head so much balls on this topic. He was 10m away from MW. His
responsibilty was not to pass the SC and not to slam on in front of the car
behind.
He didn't pass the SC an didn't slam on in front of anyone. This is all just
hype for the media to give Spanish &amp; Finlanders some hope for the WDC.

LH is going to win this year and next year and Luca de Montezoomer will

I believe his intent was to force the car behind to pass and get a penalty.
That is the reason for coming to a near stop.  He did it 40 minutes into the
race against Alonso as was pointed out on the group when it happened.   A
crash is hardly a surprise.   Little Schui Jr in the making here.

I watched the Fuji race again today from in-car cameras, much of the
time the camera was either with Alonso or Kimi, and occasionally
dotted around the field including some with Lewis.  Not sure what was
up with Kimi but he seemed to be having to wrestle that car something
chronic, more than Alonso seemed to.  I didn't notice Lewis having
trouble but the camera didn't spend much time with him.

Unfortunately the in-car footage didn't show Alonso's exit or Vettel's
spearing of Webber in any enlightening way but you did get to see some
of it.

Agreed - he was being a tit - apart from the the fact that he says he was
having to be a bit aggressive with his brakes because of the hard pads he
was running . i.e.&quot;Sorry I was being a tit but I had to otherwise I would
have fecked my brakes&quot;. Well that's his problem, not anyone elses.

The rule says you maintain a steady 5 car lengths or something similar.
Fundamentally its pretty unenforceable on the surface.

However, what it really says is &quot;Don't be a tit behind the safety car&quot; - the
actual rule just gives them a mechanism to deal with anyone who does behave
so &amp; in that context they ought to throw it at him. The actual incident with
Webber/Vettel was just one of a series of pieces of odd/bad driving by LH
behind the SC during the race - it needs to be kept in context.

&gt; Agreed - he was being a tit - apart from the the fact that he says he was
&gt; having to be a bit aggressive with his brakes because of the hard pads he
&gt; was running . i.e.&quot;Sorry I was being a tit but I had to otherwise I would

&gt; The rule says you maintain a steady 5 car lengths or something similar.
&gt; Fundamentally its pretty unenforceable on the surface.

&gt; However, what it really says is &quot;Don't be a tit behind the safety car&quot; -
&gt; the actual rule just gives them a mechanism to deal with anyone who does
&gt; behave so &amp; in that context they ought to throw it at him. The actual
&gt; incident with Webber/Vettel was just one of a series of pieces of odd/bad

Hold on. Why is it OK for ALonso to drive up the back of Hamilton,
presumably to get an advantage, but its not OK for Hamilton to try to
make a gap?

Why should Hamilton, or who ever is in front just accept that the guy
behine may have and advantage by driving dangerously up his ass?

If the guy behind thinks the guy in front is a danger to him the
answer is stupidly obvious: back off. And if he shouldnt back off, why
should the guy in front get all sensible?

If its OK for the guy behind to try to get an advantage, why cant the
guy in front?

This is an oddly one way debate.

Indeed, but the rule is about maintaining relatively fixed distances of &quot;not
more than&quot; as opposed to &quot;not less than&quot;. Other rules refer to general
standard of driving &amp; imply that you shouldn't drive erratically behind the
SC. As such that favours the guy behind - indeed if you extend the point
then by driving up close behind the guy in front you can make it difficult
for  him to keep his brakes warm and so gain an advantage on the
restart....;-)

Only on the road is it accepted that if you crash into the back of someone
its always the guy behind's fault. Same logic does not necessarily prevail
at the trac (especially behind the SC!)

&gt; What they should be looking at was Hamilton's driving beghind the
&gt; Safety car all race long - I did think he was pushing the limits on
&gt; that earlier in the race when he appeared to try &amp; catch Alonso out at
&gt; the rolling start. Indeed Alonso says he passed Hamilton 2 or 3 times
&gt; because the Ham kept stranding on the brakes.

&gt; Ham has said today that what he was doing was necessary because
&gt; McLaren were running a hard brake pad. If that's the case then he's
&gt; basically accepted that he was driving less &quot;smoothly&quot; than he could
&gt; have in order to drive around the issue of his brake pads.

&gt; Those pads were his/his team's choice &amp; subsequently their problem to
&gt; deal with - they can't be used as an excuse for driving like a cock.
&gt; He claims he was on the radio telling McLaren to get Red Bull to get
&gt; Webber to back off because he thought there could be an accident. His

I just viewed the ITV footage and you can see Weber continually coming up
very close to LH and not because LH was braking. No wonder LH as on the
blower asking for them to get him to sod off - he was afraid he'd take him
out. Sadly the footage does not show the incident only after it with the
Brundle specualting what had happened. Then why blame Vettel only to later
blame LH? If he'd thought LH responsible he'd have said so there and then.
If he could not see what was happening in front of him, then it's likely he
was driving way too close for sense. They should be forced to leave a good
gap in such weather.Maybe grade the gap according to the weather.

Watched teh video at
http://timesonline.typepad.com/formula_one/2007/10/the-chain-of-ev.html
I think they are the same.

It is hard to believe that Lewis will try overtaking the SC. Surely he
knows the rules, and he might have been stretching it by varying the
pace. Looks like Lewis went wide. Anyway, why should webber brake so
hard, as long as he is not overtaking for advantage on track. He can
always concede the position back to Lewis when he is back on line. It
would have most probably been treated as a normal incident. By braking
hard for whatever reason and Vettel not watching the car in front both
of them spoiled their podium positions. I am not sure Lewis is to blame
as much as other two involved here.

The same gap existed at various other places on both the previous SC
lap. If you have the DVD, have a look at it. Webber almost overshot LH
a number of times and under those conditions it is not a huge
surprise. However, LH did a crummy job at leading the pack. He was all
over the place, twitching almost every time he braked. One thing
especially to raise an eyebrow or two was that he braked for a turn
from some speed way early, then accelerated up with maybe 50 to go and
braked again. Erratic is a spot on description.
He also followed the SC into that turn at SC speeds as if he was just
to glide through, there was no indication that he would do a brake
warming there, especially not the way he did it. He is certainly
responsible, but whether he is at fault, is up to the stewards, who
can request his telemetry and have a better shot at seeing whether it
was intentional or not.

I only have the onboard to refer to. I don't recall what you describe
but I don't doubt you either. I do recall thinking he was being a bit
daft but that may have been just at the restart, which I have been
heavily critical of. I may have missed quite a bit under the SC.

When I'm following someone who's driving erratically I either pass them
or give them plenty of room, I don't crowd them. If I have another
driver up my tailpipe I leave more room still.

Lewis slowed a more than he needed to in that corner but I don't see a
problem with him taking whatever line he chose. If the guys behind had
given themselves a bit of room it would not have been a problem. He
took a very long way round, Webber took the shortest and then decided,
quite unnecessarily, to come to a stop. He didn't need to do that.
Vettel has absolutely no excuses.

I would like to hear what Lewis has to say about it, perhaps he thought
Webber was playing silly buggers and wanted to make a point, but the
collision was in no way inevitable because of his actions, rather
because of those who were following him.

Hamilton may be deserving of a heap of criticism but any penalty would
have to be for much more than that corner in which case it should have
been given in Japan. More to the point if his driving behind the SC was
generally and obviously inappropriate then Charlie should have been on
to Ron asap to advise him so. This was a safety issue in circumstances
that were far from usual and this was a rookie leading behind the SC
for the first time. He does need to learn.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks - already seen now on tonight's BBC News (without Spanish
&gt;&gt;&gt; captions). I don't see what this adds to the race coverage. Seems
&gt;&gt;&gt; quite simple to me. Hamilton nearly caught the slowing SC and had to
&gt;&gt;&gt; take avoiding action. As a result, Webber had to brake to ensure he
&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't pass him. The &quot;boy&quot; behind him wasn't paying attention and
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;fucked up&quot;. So why &quot;investigate&quot; Hamilton now? Unless...

&gt;&gt; If you were to watch the clip carefully, you will see that
&gt;&gt; the SC was not slowing, it was taking the corners at
&gt;&gt; a constant and steady speed. LH was driving like a total
&gt;&gt; boy racer, an arse, and above his abilities for the conditions.
&gt;&gt; He did the same at the start of the race to FA.

&gt;&gt; If LH is given a 10 place grid penalty then we know it wont
&gt;&gt; be a race he can win, seeing as he only wins from pole.
&gt;&gt; This is a huge contrast to the achievement of KR, to come
&gt;&gt; from the back of the grid to finish 3rd. IMO this is a true
&gt;&gt; display of racing genius.

&gt;You might want to track down a copy of the GP2 race from Istanbul last year.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I watched the Fuji race again today from in-car cameras, much of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; time the camera was either with Alonso or Kimi, and occasionally
&gt;&gt;&gt; dotted around the field including some with Lewis.  Not sure what was
&gt;&gt;&gt; up with Kimi but he seemed to be having to wrestle that car something
&gt;&gt;&gt; chronic, more than Alonso seemed to.  I didn't notice Lewis having
&gt;&gt;&gt; trouble but the camera didn't spend much time with him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunately the in-car footage didn't show Alonso's exit or Vettel's
&gt;&gt;&gt; spearing of Webber in any enlightening way but you did get to see some
&gt;&gt;&gt; of it.

&gt;&gt;I thought it revealing to see, from Massa's point of view, the gaps
&gt;&gt;between the 4 cars in front of him shortly before the collision.

&gt;The same gap existed at various other places on both the previous SC
&gt;lap. If you have the DVD, have a look at it. Webber almost overshot LH
&gt;a number of times and under those conditions it is not a huge

&gt;over the place, twitching almost every time he braked. One thing
&gt;especially to raise an eyebrow or two was that he braked for a turn
&gt;from some speed way early, then accelerated up with maybe 50 to go and
&gt;braked again. Erratic is a spot on description.
&gt;He also followed the SC into that turn at SC speeds as if he was just

&gt;&gt; What they should be looking at was Hamilton's driving beghind the
&gt;&gt; Safety car all race long - I did think he was pushing the limits on
&gt;&gt; that earlier in the race when he appeared to try &amp; catch Alonso out at
&gt;&gt; the rolling start. Indeed Alonso says he passed Hamilton 2 or 3 times
&gt;&gt; because the Ham kept stranding on the brakes.

&gt;&gt; Ham has said today that what he was doing was necessary because
&gt;&gt; McLaren were running a hard brake pad. If that's the case then he's
&gt;&gt; basically accepted that he was driving less &quot;smoothly&quot; than he could
&gt;&gt; have in order to drive around the issue of his brake pads.

&gt;&gt; Those pads were his/his team's choice &amp; subsequently their problem to
&gt;&gt; deal with - they can't be used as an excuse for driving like a cock.
&gt;&gt; He claims he was on the radio telling McLaren to get Red Bull to get
&gt;&gt; Webber to back off because he thought there could be an accident. His
&gt;&gt; (somewhat sanctimonious) comment is now &quot;I guess I was right&quot;

&gt;He is such a plonker.

&gt;I only have the onboard to refer to. I don't recall what you describe
&gt;but I don't doubt you either. I do recall thinking he was being a bit
&gt;daft but that may have been just at the restart, which I have been
&gt;heavily critical of. I may have missed quite a bit under the SC.

&gt;When I'm following someone who's driving erratically I either pass them
&gt;or give them plenty of room, I don't crowd them. If I have another
&gt;driver up my tailpipe I leave more room still.

Yeah, but this isn't the road. :) IIRC, cars need to stay close(is it
3 cars ? Not sure) to each other, and the leader within 5 of the SC.
So it is always bunched up and we can't forget about the usual little
mind play that goes on, where the lead car tries to show the guy
behind that he can get away, while the guy behind trying to show that
he can keep up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Well, as said it seemed like he wasn't going to even brake, let alone

ot sure about Vettel. Form the race shots, you can see that visibility
even between LH and Webber was very limited. Having watched the pulled
video a few times i'm thinking Vettel should not have been blamed so
badly. By the rules, yes, but i think he'd have been quite unaware of
what Jami was doing with two cars worth of spray in front of him until
it was too late. I think we can rest assured he didn't do it on
purpose, so let's not behead him just yet. :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I would like to hear what Lewis has to say about it, perhaps he thought
&gt;Webber was playing silly buggers and wanted to make a point, but the
&gt;collision was in no way inevitable because of his actions, rather
&gt;because of those who were following him.
">

Yes, Webber was playing silly buggers, that is also obvious from the
previous lap and usually at least the front two cars do that as a
standard thing. I've seen many SC periods where that goes on, but i
have never seen anyone take such drastic action to prevent it. Not
since a certain tunnel incident in Monaco anyway. &lt;cue Schufosi&gt; ;-)
The reason i think Lewis is responsible, at least partly, is that he
has done something which was clearly unexpected and to my memory
unseen before. Add to that the conditions and you see my point.
Imagine if you and i were driving along, following traffic and with
you behind, i'd plant the brakes just as we are about to pass under
the green lights. By law, it is your fault if you run into me, but
whose stupidity is it ?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Hamilton may be deserving of a heap of criticism but any penalty would
&gt;have to be for much more than that corner in which case it should have
&gt;been given in Japan. More to the point if his driving behind the SC was
&gt;generally and obviously inappropriate then Charlie should have been on
&gt;to Ron asap to advise him so. This was a safety issue in circumstances
&gt;that were far from usual and this was a rookie leading behind the SC
&gt;for the first time. He does need to learn.
">

What, the FIA and the stewards stuffing up ? Say it's not true ! :-)
But yes, he is a rookie and i'd say it would've been his first time
doing this in these kind of conditions, and the situation with Alonso
being out, hitting his speakers might have just mucked with his
concentration too. I won't blame him for that, we all know that
feeling where one almost shakes in excitement. &lt;cue sex jokes&gt;  :)

The over-riding factor here was the weather. Those distances went out
the window and for most drivers (including Webber during the initial SC
period) common sense dictated the necessary distances for safe running,
and temporarily passing one another happened frequently and was not an
issue.

Sure it is not the road but the same thinking applies while they are
simply circulating behind the SC. It's a simple matter of self
preservation.

All of the front 3 just let it all get to them a bit too much.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;fucked up&quot;. So why &quot;investigate&quot; Hamilton now? Unless...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you were to watch the clip carefully, you will see that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the SC was not slowing, it was taking the corners at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a constant and steady speed. LH was driving like a total
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; boy racer, an arse, and above his abilities for the conditions.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He did the same at the start of the race to FA.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If LH is given a 10 place grid penalty then we know it wont
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be a race he can win, seeing as he only wins from pole.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a huge contrast to the achievement of KR, to come
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from the back of the grid to finish 3rd. IMO this is a true
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; display of racing genius.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You might want to track down a copy of the GP2 race from Istanbul last
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;year.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Please don't blind the boy with inconvenient facts...

&gt;&gt;Oh fuck off you twat.
&gt;&gt;I am talking about his performance in &quot;F1&quot;.
&gt;&gt;LH has never won an &quot;F1&quot; race from any position other than pole - FACT.

&gt; You said, you obnoxious twat: &quot;seeing as he only wins from pole&quot;. You
&gt; made no mention of F1. When pointed out to you that you are completely
&gt; wrong, you flail about abusing all and sundry. Great way to win an

&gt; &gt; Yes, anyone who watched the race live on ITV would have seen
&gt; &gt; Hamilton
&gt; &gt; try to pull the same stunt on Alonso earlier in the race and they
&gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt; also have heard the usually mega pro Hamilton commentators comment
&gt; &gt; on
&gt; &gt; this bad behaviour which says it all really.

&gt; &gt; Dunno if this was shown when the race was repeated later in the day
&gt; &gt; as I
&gt; &gt; didn't watch that.

&gt; Hold on. Why is it OK for ALonso to drive up the back of Hamilton,
&gt; presumably to get an advantage, but its not OK for Hamilton to try to
&gt; make a gap?

In what way is braking hard &quot;making a gap&quot;?

&gt; Why should Hamilton, or who ever is in front just accept that the guy

What advantage?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If the guy behind thinks the guy in front is a danger to him the

So you accept that Hamilton was not being sensible.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If its OK for the guy behind to try to get an advantage, why cant the

On what basis are you suggesting the drivers behind Hamilton where
&quot;trying to get an advantage&quot;? What advantage?

Eh? Reading this thread it seems to me that there are all sorts of

Nonsense. He was driving like a boy racer, an arse, and
completely within his quite prodigious abilities in those
conditions.

I might be wrong, but I think all 4 of them went OTT at some point.
(Not through a nudge or anything, simply from over-driving.)

Probably 3 of them did it more than once though.

I don't recall Lewis doing so, in fact I'm pretty sure he didn't, but
if someone knows for sure, either way, I'd be interested. I did check
one commentary which mentioned nothing and the lap times give nothing
away.
Also plenty of people have said he didn't put a foot wrong so they
don't recall anything either.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

KR had a spin behind the SC but I don't regard his off track moments
and those that many drivers had while racing for postion at the end of
the race as driving errors in the same way...more tactical options you
might say.
