The world is flat - but not to the Burmese generals

November 20, 2007 - The world, according to Thomas Friedman the Pulitzer
Prize winning New York Times journalist, is flat. He was referring to the
instantaneous cyber connection in the outsourcing of tech jobs from the
United States to India in his book &quot;The World Is Flat.&quot; But the generals in
Burma did not realize that the world is even flatter now, as evidenced by
the leaking of their brutal crackdown on the monk-led recent demonstrations
on the streets of Rangoon. More than a dozen young Burmese bloggers with
nothing but high-tech competence and a savviness unknown to the regime, were
making the world even flatter than Mr. Friedman's world.

They were able to post deeply moving images and horrendous photos of the
killing and violence inflicted on monks and civilians by the soldiers. The
whole world's mainstream media instantaneously picked up the images and
stories and thus the Burmese regime's way of putting down civilian unrest
was brought onto the center of the world stage. The small pitiful country
that Information Minister Brigadier General Kyaw San described in his
scathing speech against the United Nations, was transformed overnight into a
wrathful entity in the limelight of the global stage.

No matter that the regime tried to minimize the number of deaths and clean
up their image, the whole world did not buy it, not even the Chinese or the
Russians. The video showing the killing of Japanese journalist Kenji Nagai
has wiped away any ounce of credibility the regime had been trying to
achieve. The direct and brutal assault on the Japanese journalist gave an
insight into half a century of killings and violence on Burmese citizens
that the regime had successfully maintained under wraps.

As the truth was told through these visual images, the military junta had
nowhere to hide. Moreover, now news coming out of Japan says that Nagai was
under surveillance by the junta before he was killed, as evidenced by the
Burmese guide that Nagai hired and to whom he entrusted his second camera in
case he was killed. He evidently knew the ruthlessness of the Burmese junta.
The saga of the daylight murder of Nagai may not end quickly. Nagai's
Burmese guide was brought to Japan in October by APF News for safety. The
news of the surveillance on Nagai was reported by his Burmese guide to a
meeting at the Diet in Tokyo. The acts of the junta will keep on being
revealed in spite of the clampdown on news in Burma after the
demonstrations.

The world had indeed been creeping up on the generals without their
knowledge. At present, at the ASEAN summit, reports in the media say the
Burmese Ministers have been trying to block Gambari's scheduled presentation
on Wednesday. This fact clearly shows the guilty conscience of the junta. If
they had nothing to hide why would they want to block Gambari's speech? They
don't seem to realize that they are now major villains on the world stage
and any move they take is going to be scrutinized under a microscope. They
now have nowhere to hide.

There will be a long shadow which will follow the junta wherever they go,
like Angulimala, the villain during the Buddha's lifetime who had killed 999
persons before he met the Buddha. Although Angulimala became enlightened
while meeting the Buddha, legend has it that wherever he went stones and
rocks rained down on him from which he could not escape. Likewise with the
junta's karma of inflicting murder on innocent countrymen and disregarding
and violating human rights, the vipaka of such acts will be like a shadow
following the junta wherever they go.

The fact that the ASEAN ministers are going to converge on the Burmese
ministers behind closed doors already has the Burmese junta on the
defensive. They are in fact getting the first taste of distrust from the
Southeast Asian community of nations in the aftermath of the brutality they
have committed on their unarmed countrymen. ASEAN may not kick them out, but
they do not fully trust the Burmese junta either. Otherwise why would they
question the Burmese ministers before Burma signs the new ASEAN Charter
which is to promote human rights and democracy. In other words, ASEAN will
not let Burma off lightly. At the same time they are giving recognition to
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, which is a sign that they recognize her as a bona fide
political figure in Burma. That should bring some balance to the junta's
might.

Whether the human rights accord is binding or not, once the junta become one
of the signatories, they are morally bound to the ASEAN community to abide
by the mandate stipulated in the Charter. If they don't, and continue to
inflict human rights violations and undermine democratic institutions, it
will give the world the opportunity to put greater pressure on ASEAN to
reconsider the membership of Burma in their club. In so many ways the accord
is binding and a smart move on the part of ASEAN to keep the Burmese junta
under their watchful eyes. But the cost of it is that ASEAN also has to
shoulder the burden of playing nursemaid to the wayward Burmese military and
try to bring them in line. This will be the most interesting and intriguing
part of the saga with respect to the Burmese junta, which is now considered
the black sheep within the family of ASEAN countries.

In a flat world this is what happens. No regime or country is an island and
none can exist in isolation. The Burmese junta is no exception and they will
find that out pretty soon.

You are a liar....

Only the PM of Singapore tried to twist the arms of the
Myanmar PM. He failed miserably and was made a
fool...before all the ministers of Asean and before the
world.

He tried to shame the Myamar PM by inviting the UN
envoy to speak at the Asean summit meeting..it would
give the Ann San Suu Kyi political cause a world stage.

The other leaders, including Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia,
Loa, Thailand and Myanmar...objected.
China told PM Lee bluntly that it will not attend the
Asean + 3 meeting if the UN envoy speaks at the meeting.

The Myamar government has the full support of at least
8 of ASEAN members, India and China.

Myanmar is doing far better than Iraq...a democracy.
650,000 Iraqi were killed by the US invasion. The Iraqi
is without basic necessities...and millions of Iraq were
forced to flee the country. Â Myamarese know better.

Without the strong Army generals in control...Myamar
will be torn apart into several states by civil wars. Millions
innocent Myamarese will die...as in Iraq now.
In a democracy, millions of DEAD Myamarese don't enjoy
free speech, or any rights at all .....NOT even the right to
live.
