It takes some legwork ... well, brainwork, anyway.

Statistics on morbidity and mortality are kept by the CDC and other
government organizations. So start with all the &quot;premature deaths&quot; that
can be attributed to air pollution. Then look at air pollution sources
and rate them by how toxic they are, how many people live in the area
where they are emitted, and how much pollution is emitted. If the
mortality data is broken up geographically, you can even get a closer
correlation that way. Say you had an area near the ocean where offshore
winds keep the air fresh and some other mountain valley where the air
was stagnant in the winter. Clearly the air quality could be compared
with mortality from lung diseases for those two areas. If there was a
difference, then you could attribute it to some difference in the two
environments. It's not trivial to do, of course, and the work needs to
be checked. But even a reasonable interpretation is better than just
throwing up your hands, pleading stupidity, and not trying to do
anything about the problem except to quote that old chestnut about lies,
damn lies, and statistics.

&quot;5,000 premature deaths a year&quot; sounds like a huge number, but you have
to compare that with other causes of death and the size of the
population being talked about. Southern California is what, ten million
people? 5000 out of ten million is 5 out of 10000, and that's right
among the sorts of numbers you get for various specific causes of death.
It's not something to get alarmed about, but it is worth doing something
about.

A similar tricky calculation is the relative benefits of spreading sand
on snow in the winters in Denver. The positive benefit is better
traction and fewer car accidents. But the harm is that the sand gets
ground up into very fine glass shards that you breathe into our lungs
where they start to cause damage. In the long run, that has killed or
injured as many people as the sand was supposed to prevent dying in car
accidents. So what do you do?

They are? I would say that Los Angeles has done a great job of
cleaning up the air, while continuing to provide electrical power, and
transport produce to the city and manufactured goods away from the
city.

It has been illegal to burn trash in backyard incinerators for at
least 50 years, and the first smog devices were required on cars
around 1963.

Around 1967, if you drove along Aviation Boulveard next to the jet
airliner run up area, you were engulfed in oily black fumes from
partly burned jet fuel. When the jetliners took off, there was a trail
of black smokw extending out over Catalina island and as far as it
took for the jetliners to get up to the altitude their fuel controls
were set to operate efficently at.

The airlines voluntarily agreed to install improved combustor cans on
all their engines and the smoke problem was solved.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District refused to allow any
new oil-fired steam generating plants in Los Angeles County, and the
existing plants weren't allowed to operate during daylight hours, so
the electric ultility companies built new powerplants just across the
county line.

And, the restriction on operating steam plants during daylight hours
caused the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to build the
Sylmar Converter Station which converts AC power generated at night
into DC power which is transmitted to The Dalles, Oregon via an 800
mile long DC transmission line that operates at 800,000 volts.

During the daytime, and on weekends, Los Angeles DWP customers get
about half their electric power from hydroelectric plants on the
Columbia riber and British Columbia.

Last I heard, Los Angeles was getting about 5.55% of its power from
Boulder Dam's hydroelectric generators. The DWP also built the Castaic
pumping generator plant which pumps water out of Castaic Lake at night
and can then release it through hydroelectric turbines to provide peak
power in case of an emergency.

Thirty years ago, the air in the southern San Joaquin Valley was
relatively clear, but nowadays, if you look towards Bakersfield from
Tejon Pass, you cannot see the city at all, it's lost in the air
pollution from the diesel trucks that haul produce and dairy products
from the agricultural areas and dairies.

Environmentalists have reduced their estimate on the weight of
volatile pollutions that come out of dairy cattle from 13 pounds per
animal per day down to only about 6 pounds.

Between the diesel trucks which are carrying half of California's
wealth to market and the cows belching and farting methane, the sky in
the south San Joaquin Valley is brown.

If you stand on Moro Rock in Sequoia National Park, you can only see
about 20 miles, but you could once see seven mountain ranges going all
the way from the Sierra Nevada to the Santa Monicas 150 miles away.

There is a little town near Fresno called Mountain View, where it is
claimed you can look east and see Mount Whitney, 60 miles away. I have
never been able to see the mountain through the smog.

And, what about wood burning fireplaces? It's illegal to light up your
wood burning heaters in this county unless you have no other source of
heat or you live above 500 feet.

Then there are the effects of urban sprawl. Most people who drive
through Bakersfield have no idea the the 700 square mile Lake Tulare
ever existed
about 40 miles west.

Changing environmental conditions have cause two major droughts that
began to dry the lake up in the end of the 19th century, and farmers'
need for water to irrigate their crops finished the lake off.

It is now technically a desert where cotton is grown. There is a
little town called Allensworth where a retired African American US
Army officer started a town for freed slaves. The little town is next
to Allensworth State Historical Park. The environmental agency
recently refused to grant a permit for another huge dairy to be built
near Allensworth.

As you ride westward along the Kaweah River from Sequoia National Park
towards Visalia, you might notice a grove of giant valley oaks along
the road.

The oaks were once part of a 400 square mile oak forest that extended
from Sequoia to Lake Tulare. Sailors used to be able to navigate in
lake in schooners 150 years ago, and commercial fishermen used to be
able to catch salmon in nets in the Kings River.

But the lake had to dry up, and the forest had to be cut down so the
lands could be developed for agricultural use. But nowadays,
agricultural land is worth at least $100,000 an acre, so the orange
groves that were planted in the 1930's are now being ripped out and
guess what the orange growers are doing to get rid of the wood?

They are burning the trees, and adding to the air pollution.

Well then, there's hope in this vast wasteland of gloom.

Maybe in 10-15 years, environmentalists will revise their estimates
such that dairy cattle can be legally labeled as ULEV vehicles.

Reasoning like that is something to get alarmed about.  Can it ever be
shown that even one life was saved by not allowing fireplaces to be
lit?  Maybe &quot;something&quot; needs to be done, but there should be a
requirement that the &quot;something&quot; is actually effective at
accomplishing the desired result.  It should also be required to show
that this &quot;something&quot; is more effective than some alternatives.

The full text of the LA Times article can be found at
http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/pardonourdust/2007/06/a_new_fireplace... .

The &quot;5400&quot; number is for _all_ sources of air pollution, not just
fireplaces, the concern with fireplaces is over oxides of nitrogen,
not particulates, and the estimate is that the reduction will be 7
tons per day out of a required 192 to meet a Federal regulation--there
is no claim that that reduction in air pollution will eliminate the
entire 5400 deaths nor is it mentioned what portion of them it will
eliminate.

&gt;&gt; &gt; [1]  pollution from wood burning fireplaces

&gt;&gt; We've had wood buring restrictions in Salt Lake for years.  Burning wood
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; very dirty.  Could be as bad or worse than coal.  Look at the historic
&gt;&gt; record (See London, SLC for starters).

&gt;&gt; I love my fireplace, but I rarely use it.  Thanksgiving, Christmas maybe
&gt;&gt; New
&gt;&gt; Years.
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately for urban areas it isn't one fireplace, its millions.  And
&gt;&gt; don't mention fast food joints and dry cleaners.  Any single business is
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; minor problem, but as an aggragate it is a real problem.

&gt;&gt; We've already reduced automobile pollution by 90%.  The law of
&gt;&gt; diminishing
&gt;&gt; returns kicks in for making cars cleaner.

&gt;&gt; In LA's (And SLC's, Phoenix's) case there are just too damn many people
&gt;&gt; given the geography (all are ringed by mountains) and suffer devastating
&gt;&gt; inversions.

&gt;&gt; BTW, when I live in Alexandria VA as a kid everyone had a 55 gallon drum
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; burned their trash.  Try that now.

&gt; Fairfax County banned all open burning in 1970, when I was 12.    We
&gt; still can have fires in home fireplaces, though.   I'm not sure what
&gt; all those southern Californians are burning in their fireplaces that
&gt; is causing 5,000 premature deaths a year, though.  Maybe it's
&gt; something a little stronger than seasoned oak.
