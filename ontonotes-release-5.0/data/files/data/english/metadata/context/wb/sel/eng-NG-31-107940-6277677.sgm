See

http://us.cnn.com/2007/WEATHER/02/17/winter.weather.ap/index.html

So what would cause windshields to crack on many different types of aircraft
at the same time?  It wasn't impact or anything like that.  The weather was
not exceptional for a Denver winter.  Multiple aircraft models from multiple
manufacturers were affected.

I don't believe the "wasn't impact" part.   I lived in Denver for a
while, and when the winds whip up, stones fly around.   Cracked
windshields and dust-storm-scarred paint can be quite common out
there.

Maybe.  The news article implied that impact wasn't involved.

I was thinking of perhaps some sort of incredibly large temperature
differential, but surely no such differential on the ground could compare with
the differences seen at altitude, so that doesn't seem to explain it, either.

I also understood that most of the cracked windshields occurred on the ground;
only a few involved aircraft that were in the air.

I was under the impression that just about nothing could crack an airliner
windshield short of a transonic brick, but I may be wrong.  On smaller
aircraft, I don't know.  I suppose they have some sort of regular safety glass
for the windshields, but less fancy than that of high-flying jets (?).

How cold did it get in Denver?  Aluminum and plastic have
different contraction rates with cold.  Plastic also gets
brittle with cold.  Wind flexes wing, which also flexes
fuselages, erg---cracks.

Of course these jet windshields are heated to provide the middle layer
of plastic with some flexibility to resist shattering in case of a bird
strike at low temps. Should the heating system be turned off and cold-
soaking occur(electrical bus turned off for trouble-shooting perhaps),
Boeing had a procedure for re-heating the windshield at very low temps
to prevent thermal shock from cracking the glass layers. This involved
cycling the power switches ON-OFF at one minute intervals for several
minutes. Sounds to me as if the temps at DEN were quite low and the flight
crews just turned the windshield heat ON and forgot about it.

Just one possibility of course.....

Denver is considered "high plains desert", and is actually quite
moderate.  Average temperature in February is around 33 degrees.  It's
not unusual to get a blizzard, and then be out in short sleeves the
next day.   (It'll be around 50 F tomorrow! )

It'd be a heckuva lot colder in many other places, so cold windshield
cracks make no sense, unless they used the wrong heating process as
Bob Moore suggests.

On the other hand, they mentioned 100 mph ground winds, and that means
flying rocks to me.   Windshield replacement is a big business out
there due to so much gravel on the roads  :)

A few decades back we toured the s/e part of Australia by car.  At the more

Winds on Thursday &amp; Friday reached over 100 mph in the foothills.
We don't use salt, as a rule, on the roads. Ice slicer and a
combination of fine rocks. Add to this the everyday, run-of-the-mill
rocks and gravel kicked up on the roads, and it's normal to replace
the windshields every 2-4 years (I'm due this year. Last change
was in 2004). Get these winds, a few hefty rocks, and
a new windshield sooner than expected.

KDEN is surrounded by empty fields (for the most part), which means
lots of "stuff" in the area that is kicked up by the winds.

It can't be as cold as the jets routinely see above 30,000 feet.  I
suspect the wind was carrying stones or ice chunks or something like
that which cracked the windshields.

Common misconception.  Wind chill only applies to the heat loss of
animals.   It does not apply to inanimate objects.   The only thing
wind will do to metal, glass, plastic, etc is help cool it faster to
the ambient temperature.

I suspect the the crews turned on the electric windshield heating without
proper warmup when it was very cold, and the cracks resulted from thermal
stresses in the windows.  The cracks were reported to have happened in the
air, where flying rocks would be rare, and not on the ground.

I would think that's still balmy and calm compared to the flight levels. I

It sounds logical.  Many models of aircraft were affected, though (and in fact
Boeing wasn't mentioned--if a Boeing windshield cracks, there's a _real_
problem).  Mostly those Brazilian planes and some others.  Most were on the
ground, not in the air.

Boulder is a town just north of Denver, right at the foothills, which
are steep and abrupt.
Sometime in the late 80s or early 90s, a windstorm from the west blew
out nearly all of the front and back auto windshields in a parking
lot.  IIRC it wasn't debris, but the wind itself.  It gets to howling
there some times.

Probably nothing to do with the current situation, though.  I'd have
to think that a wind that strong would also bend the airplanes up a
bit.

Wind chill has everything to do with how fast heat is lost from
someone at body temperature. It's widely held that the old data,
that's 'wind chill', is not a very accurate measure of the effect of
wind on flesh and there's some work going on for a better measure. The
statement the poster made about any heat-generating object is not
quite complete, I'm sure he meant to remind us that it's related to
the surface temperature of the object, or at least the surface
temperatture in no wind conditions.

Fans in your computer are there to move air mass against hot objects
to carry the heat away, they are trying to create 'wind chill' inside
the computer. You can google 'convective heat loss' or 'forced air
cooling' if you want to explore the subject in more depth.

&gt; Are you sure about that?  I thought water evaporation had a lot to do

Googling on "wind chill" nets a different set of results. Notice the human
reference in the following from weather.gov:

[[
Specifically, the new WCT index:

a.. Calculates wind speed at an average height of five feet (typical
height of an adult human face) based on readings from the national standard
height of 33 feet (typical height of an anemometer)
b.. Is based on a human face model
c.. Incorporates modern heat transfer theory (heat loss from the body to
its surroundings, during cold and breezy/windy days)
d.. Lowers the calm wind threshold to 3 mph
e.. Uses a consistent standard for skin tissue resistance
f.. Assumes no impact from the sun (i.e., clear night sky).

That's not what wind chill is about.  You need to take into account
evaporative cooling, which has a significant effect.

I don't think so.

The windchill temperature is calculated using the following formula:

Windchill (ºF) = 35.74 + 0.6215T - 35.75(V^0.16) + 0.4275T(V^0.16)

Where: T = Air Temperature (F)
V = Wind Speed (mph)
^ = raised to a power (exponential)

Windchill Temperature is only defined for temperatures at or below 50
degrees F and wind speeds above 3 mph. Bright sunshine may increase
the windchill temperature by 10 to 18 degrees F.

I need to retreat a little here. The formula I gave looks to be a
curve fit to an empirical data set, and that data may have been
obtained with evaporative losses as a factor. I seem to remember,
however, the experiments were done observing heat loss from plastic
bottles filled with water, the thickness of the plastic offering more
or less the same thermal impedence as does skin.

So, I hereby extinguish the implied flame.

Sorry about that. Now I'm off to slay more meaningful dragons and save
a maiden or two.

CLEAR!

I think the newsgroup would be interested in this finding.

"Although windborne debris was at first dismissed as a cause for the
14 cracked aircraft windshields last week at Denver International
Airport, investigators now are saying FOD, or foreign-object debris,
was indeed to blame. Microscopic analysis showed fine particles caused
pitting that in turn caused cracking, NTSB investigator Jennifer
Kaiser told the Denver Post. The runways had been sanded during recent
snowstorms, and it's suspected that the winds, gusting up to 48 mph,
drove the fine sand particles into the windshields. The fractures
affected six passenger jets as they were taking off, seven on the
airport surface, and one at 19,000 feet. The NTSB offered no
explanation regarding that high-altitude incident. Also unexplained
was the apparent lack of damage to any aircraft surfaces other than
windscreens. "The only commonality across aircraft type, operator,
location, time and phase of flight was the wind and weather," Kaiser
told the Post.

&gt; &gt; KDEN is surrounded by empty fields (for the most part), which means
&gt; &gt; lots of &quot;stuff&quot; in the area that is kicked up by the winds.

&gt; Boulder is a town just north ofDenver, right at the foothills, which
&gt; are steep and abrupt.
&gt; Sometime in the late 80s or early 90s, a windstorm from the west blew
&gt; out nearly all of the front and back autowindshieldsin a parking
&gt; lot.  IIRC it wasn't debris, but the wind itself.  It gets to howling
&gt; there some times.

&gt; Probably nothing to do with the current situation, though.  I'd have
&gt; to think that a wind that strong would also bend the airplanes up a
&gt; bit.

Isn't sanding areas at an airport kind of a bad idea, precisely because sand
could be FOD?
