Is genuine knowledge attainable at all? What are the limits of
knowledge? From what faculties of the mind does knowledge originate?
Which method should be used to obtain valid knowledge? How do you
justify a priori statements? Is the frosting black or white? Where is
the boundary between the subjective and objective factors? What is the

Hegel argued that nothing is just simply and immediately present, that
nothing is simply given as a firm basis for something else. (Hegel
1969, 68 and 829) Everything in thought and reality becomes what it is
through mediations, which are not the same as relations. A relation
connects two already established things (this city is larger than that
city; Chicago is north of New Orleans). Mediations, on the other hand,
are connections within the processes that establish things. (For
instance, Hegel argues that the totality of the state and the developed
individuality of its citizens are each made actual through the other).
For him, a mediated whole is something more than a set of static
relations; mediated wholes exist in the tensions of the processes of
their own becoming.

http://www.dkolb.org/sprawlingplaces/gateway/kantoutl/hegelonm.html

An inference is the implication of a conclusion from one or more
premises. The inference is mediate if there is more than one premise.
If the conclusion is drawn from only one premise, then the inference is
called immediate infernce.

It was the first day of school and a new student, Suzuki, son of a
Japanese businessman, entered the fourth grade class.  The teacher
said, "Let's begin by reviewing some American history.

"Who said,  'Give me Liberty or give me Death' ?"  She saw a sea of
blank faces, except for Suzuki's

"Patrick Henry 1775," he  said.

"Very  good!  Who said '...government of the people, by the people, for
the people, shall not perish from the earth'?"

Again, no response, except from Suzuki. "Abraham Lincoln, 1863."

The teacher snapped, "Class, you  should be ashamed. Suzuki, who is new
to our country, knows more about its history than you do."

She heard a loud whisper, "Screw the Japs."

"Who said that?" she demanded.

Suzuki raised his hand: "Lee Iacocca, 1982."

At that point a student said, "I'm  gonna puke." The teacher glared and
asked, "All right!  Who said that?"

Suzuki says, "George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991."

Furious, another student yells, "Oh yeah? Suck this!"

Suzuki jumps up waving his hand and shouts, "Bill Clinton, to Monica
Lewinsky,  1997!"

With near mob hysteria, someone screams, "You little s**t. If you say
anything else, I'll kill you."

Suzuki yells, "Gary Condit to Chandra Levy, 2001."

At this, the teacher fainted.  The class gathered around her.

One of the kids says, "Oh s**t, we're in BIG  trouble!"

Suzuki says,  "Arthur Andersen, 2002."

Thinking, unhealthily or healthily, is still an avoidance of being
alone. It is still an avoidance of interactions with others. When one
meditates, for example, they disengage themselves from all other
humans. One does the same when they think, they disengage from
interactions with others for interactions with the self.

Labelling it healthy (or unhealthy) does not change the 'reality' of
what takes place.

It is interesting that you say so, but I am afraid that your reasoning may
be flawed.  Can you spell out what you mean in modal logic, or the formal

Unless of course you consider the possibility that all interaction is

I appreciate your intention. The issue though, is that whether one's
thinking results in depression or in other states of mind or being,
that when one is engaged in that activity they are disengaged from
others and the environment. To make any argument then, of a
philosophical now moment becomes false.

To mediatate and become self-aware of what happens in the body
(breathing for example) is only a partial slice of what is actual in
the moment.

As I was meditating last Friday, there were many people around me,
passing me, buildings, other activity. I was, for the most part,
unaware of them while my focus was internal.

The larger issue for me is in the directed concentration where one
"must" focus one's attention rather allowing all that which is in the
external and internal enviroment to exist and be part of awareness. The
focus of energy (such as meditating on a flame, a though, or one's
breathing) is an attempt to avoid focusing on what the mind finds
interesting.

&gt; The first rule of depression: Think!
">

The root of it all, you say, thinking? Or just the cause of emotional
moodiness? If either I suppose the topic could then be altered to
address strong thinking ways, right?

http://groups.google.com/group/alt.philosophy/msg/72357697afe13bfa

Cognitive therapy or cognitive behavior therapy is a kind of
psychotherapy used to treat depression, anxiety disorders, phobias, and
other forms of mental disorder.

It involves recognizing unhelpful
patterns of thinking and reacting,
then modifying or replacing these
with more realistic or helpful ones.

Its practitioners hold that typically clinical depression is associated
with (although not necessarily caused by) negatively biased thinking
and irrational thoughts.

Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is based on the idea that

how we think (cognition),
how we feel (emotion),
and how we act (behaviour)
all interact together.

Specifically, our thoughts determine our feelings and our behaviour.
Therefore negative thoughts can cause us distress and result in
problems.

One example could be;

someone who, after making a
mistake, thinks "I'm useless
and can't do anything right."

This impacts negatively on their
mood and makes them feel depressed;

then they worsen the problem by
reacting to avoid activities.

As a result they reduce their chance
of successful experience, which
reinforces their original thought
of being "useless".

In therapy the latter example could be identified as a self-fulfilling
prophecy or "problem cycle", and the efforts of the therapist and
client would be to work together to change this. This is done by
addressing the way the client thinks in response to similar situations
and by helping them think more flexibly, along with reducing their
avoidance of activities. If as a result they escape the negative
thought pattern, they will already feel less depressed. They may
hopefully also then become more active, succeed more, and further
reduce their depression.

With thoughts stipulated as being the cause of emotions rather than
vice-versa, cognitive therapists reverse the causal order more
generally used by psychotherapists. Therefore the therapy is to
identify those irrational or maladaptive thoughts that lead to negative
emotion and identify what it is about them that is irrational or just
not helpful; this is done in an effort to reject the distorted thoughts
and replace them with more realistic alternative thoughts.

Cognitive therapy is not
an overnight process.

Even after a patient has learned
to recognise when and where his
thought processes are going awry,
it can take months of concerted
effort to replace an irrational
thought with a more reasonable
one.

With patience and a good therapist, however, cognitive therapy can be a
valuable tool in recovery.

The four column technique;

A major technique in cognitive therapy is the four column technique. It
consists of a four step process. The first three steps analyze the
process by which a person has become depressed or distressed.

The first column records
the objective situation.

In the second column, the
client writes down the negative
thoughts which occurred to them.

The third column is for the negative
feelings and dysfunctional behaviors
which ensued.

The negative thoughts of the second column are seen as a connecting
bridge between the situation and the distressing feelings.

The fourth column is used
for challenging the negative
thoughts on the basis of
evidence from the
client's experience.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_therapy

A common 'everyday example' of alternative thoughts or beliefs about
the same experience and their resulting emotions might be the case of
an individual being turned down for a job. She might believe that she
was passed over for the job because she was fundamentally incompetent.
In that case, she might well become depressed, and she might be less
likely to apply for similar jobs in the future. If, on the other hand,
she believed that she was passed over because the field of candidates
was exceptionally strong, she might feel disappointed but not
depressed, and the experience probably wouldn't dissuade her from
applying for other similar jobs.

Cognitive therapy suggests that psychological distress is caused by
distorted thoughts about stimuli giving rise to distressed emotions.
The theory is particularly well developed (and empirically supported)
in the case of depression, where clients frequently experience unduly
negative thoughts which arise automatically even in response to stimuli
which might otherwise be experienced as positive. For instance, a
depressed client hearing "please stop talking in class" might think
"everything I do is wrong; there is no point in even trying". The same
client might hear "you've received top marks on your essay" and think
"that was a fluke; I won't ever get a mark like that again", or he
might hear "you've really improved over the last term" and think "I was
really abysmal at the start of term". Any of these thoughts could lead
to feelings of hopelessness or reduced self esteem, maintaining or
worsening the individual's depression.

http://counsellingresource.com/types/cognitive-therapy/index.html

Cognitive distortions are logical, but they are not rational. They can
create real difficulty with your thinking. See if you are doing any of
the ten common distortions that people use. Rate yourself from one to
ten with one being low and ten being high. Ask yourself if you can stop
using the distortions and think in a different way.

ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING: You see
things in black-and-white categories.
If your performance falls short of
perfect, you see your self as a
total failure.

OVERGENERALIZATION: You see a single
negative event as a never-ending
pattern of defeat.

MENTAL FILTER: You pick out a single
negative detail and dwell on it exclusively
so that your vision of all reality becomes
darkened, like the drop of ink that
discolors the entire beaker of water.

DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE: You reject
positive experiences by insisting they
"don't count" for some reason or other.
In this way you can maintain a negative
belief that is contradicted by your
everyday experiences.

JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS: You make a negative
interpretation even though there are no
definite facts that convincingly
support your conclusion.

MIND READING: You arbitrarily conclude
that someone is reacting negatively to
you, and you don't bother to
check this out

THE FORTUNETELLER ERROR: you can anticipate
that things will turn out badly, and you
feel convinced that your prediction is
an already-established fact.

MAGNIFICATION (CATASTROPHIZING) OR
MINIMIZATION: You exaggerate the importance
of things (such as your goof-up or someone
else's achievement), or you inappropriately
shrink things until they appear tiny (your
own desirable qualities or other fellow's
imperfections). This is also called
the binocular trick."

EMOTIONAL REASONING: You assume that your
negative emotions necessarily reflect the
way things really are: "I feel it, therefore
it must be true."

SHOULD STATEMENTS: You try to motivate
yourself with should and shouldn't, as
if you had to be whipped and punished
before you could be expected to do anything.
"Musts" and "oughts" are also offenders.
The emotional consequences are guilt. When
you direct should statements toward others,
you feel anger, frustration, and resentment.

LABELING AND MISLABELING: This is an extreme
form of overgeneralization. Instead of
describing your error, you attach a
negative label to yourself. "I'm a loser."
When someone else's behavior rubs you the
wrong way, you attach a negative label to
him" "He's a Goddamn louse." Mislabeling
involves describing an event with
language that is highly colored
and emotionally loaded.

PERSONALIZATION: You see your self as the
cause of some negative external event,
which in fact you were not
primarily responsible for.

Philosophical Problems and Arguments: An Introduction
by James W. Cornman, Keith Lehrer, George Sotiros Pappas
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0872201244/

A person may be quite well justified in what she believes, even though
her justification is based on some false assumption.

For example;

...if a person parks her car in a public parking lot for a few hours,
she is quite well justified, when she returns to her car and does not
observe any alteration, in assuming that the engine of the car remains
under the hood. Of course, if someone has stolen the engine while she
was away, then her belief that there is an engine under the hood falls
short of knowledge simply because it is untrue that the engine is
there. However, imagine that after the engine was stolen a friend came
along, and, noticing the engine had been removed, arranged to have it
replaced with another before the owner returned, so as to relieve her
of the agony of finding her engine stolen. Then the owner will be quite
correct in her belief that there is an engine under the hood of her car
when she returns. Moreover, she is quite well justified in this belief
as well. However, the owner's belief will be based on a false
assumption, namely, that the engine that was under the hood of her car
when she left remains there now. This false assumption leads her to the
true conclusion that there is an engine under her hood. But since the
only justification she has for believing this is based on the false
assumption, we should not say that she knows that there is an engine
under the hood of the car.

We must require not only that a person be well justified in what he or
she believes, but also that his or her justification not depend
essentially on any false assumption; otherwise, a person cannot be said
to know. This qualification may be articulated in a variety of ways. We
shall require that a person be completely justified in believing
something, in order to know what he or she believes is true; and also
that his or her justification must be undefeated by any false
assumption on which it essentially depends.

We conclude that a person knows something just in case his or her
beljef is true, completely justified, and the justification is
undefeated. A skeptic building her case on this analysis of knowledge
may argue, concerning things people commonly assume they know, either
(1) that we do not even believe those things, (2) that they are not
true, (3) that we are not completely justified in believing them, or
(4) that our justification, though complete, is defeated by some false
assumption on which it essentially depends. The most promising place
for the skeptic to get a foothold is condition (3). A skeptic who
wishes to defend some very extensive form of skepticism, for example,
by contending we do not know that any of our perceptual beliefs are
true, will do best to argue that condition (3) in the analysis is never
satisfied by such beliefs. "Are we completely justified in our
perceptual beliefs?" The skeptic says, "No!" and sets out to convince
her dogmatic detractors of the merits of her skepticism.

Basic Assumption problems

When discussing any topic, it is vitally important that your basic
assumptions are correct. It doesn't matter if you are the most logical
person in the world, if you begin your reasoning with "Elves are
running our government" your conclusion is more than likely going to be
incorrect. Here are some common mistakes when making assumptions in a
debate.

1. Reaching definate conclusions based on generalizations

Example: Statistically, men are stronger than women. Therefore, no
woman could every outlift any man.

2. Ignoring other characteristics when reaching conclusions

Example: I am alive. Frogs are alive. Therefore, I am a frog.

3. Ignoring observed phenomena in favor of what someone tells you

Example: I saw my husband kissing another woman in the park, but since
he said he was going out of town, it must have been someone else.

4. Focusing on a single characteristic in a complex situation

Example: OJ Simpson was arrested for one reason: because he was black.

5. Using lack of evidence to reach conclusions

Example: I've never seen Bob punch anyone. Therefore, he must be a
wimp.

6. Circular Reasoning

Example: Pete carries an axe because he is a fireman, and we know he's
a fireman because he carries an axe.

7. Snowball Theory (also called the slippery slope)

Example: If I don't buy this candy bar the store could go broke,
causing people to lose their jobs and be unable to buy anything; which
will cause a loss in sales, a dropping of profits, and the companies
will be forced to start laying people off, which could result in a
depression; this would mean a drop in stocks, a loss of money, mass
suicides, banks running out of money, and finally the total collapse of
western society. So I'd better buy this candy bar.

8. Failing to recognize essential characteristics.

Example: An axe with a seven inch blade will break down a door in
twenty seconds, so a four inch knife should be able to do it in forty
seconds.

Cause and Effect Mistakes

Cause and effect are important things to consider in certain areas of
discussion, especially in history or the applied sciences. Obviously
cause and effect are a chain of events: what affects one thing effects
something else, and so on. Here are some of the more common mistakes in
logical thinking when people are discussing causes and effects.

1. Confusing Cause with Effect

Example: Wearing large dresses makes you look fat.

2. Failing to recognize multiple Causes

Example: The Roman Empire fell because the barbarians invaded.

3. Confusing independent events with Cause and Effect

Example: Napolean sold Louisiana to America. Napolean lost at Waterloo.

Therefore, if Napolean had kept Louisiana he would have won.

4. Not recognizing a cause-effect relationship

Example: What does not exercising have to do with my weight problem?

5. Confusing a correlation with cause and effect

Example: Serial killers chew gum. Therefore, they kill because of gum.

6. Assuming cause-effect rather than coincidence

Example: John is a doctor. Paul killed John. Therefore, Paul killed
John because he was a doctor.

7. Failure to recognize multiple Effects

Example: Hitler's a good guy, since he improved Germany's economy.

8. Failure to recognize that a cause doesn't always lead to the effect.

Example: I've smoked for years and haven't gotten cancer, therefore
smoking doesn't cause cancer.

Theories and Occam's Razor

"plurality should not be posited without necessity" wrote William of
Ockham almost seven hundred years ago. The idea he was trying to
convey, the idea we today call "Occam's Razor" is that if there is more
than one theory that explains something, and both are equally valid,
the simpler one should be assumed to be the correct one.

For example, scientists at the start of this century believed in an
unmeasurable substance called "Ether". It was to explain a great many
ideas of physics. The theory of ether was eventually discarded because
scientists were able to explain things just as well without ether, so
ether was an unnecessary part of physics. This is an example of
applying Occam's Razor; choosing a simpler theory out of two when both
equally explain all the facts. What follows are mistakes people make
with theories in general and Occam's Razor in particular.

1. Ignoring Occam's Razor

Example: Sure, the Mayans could have been wiped out by a disease, but
isn't it just as likely that they were carried off by aliens?

2. Mis-applying Occam's Razor

Example: The simplest explanation for the Apollo moon landings is that
they were faked.

3. Failing to understand that one theory can't always explain
everything

Example: Your theory on bacteria doesn't explain why yogurt tastes
good, so it must be wrong.

4. Reaching a conclusion with no evidence

Example: The Roanoke colony disappeared because they developed time
travel technology.

5. Giving equal balance to a theory who's only strength is that it
cannot be disproved.

Example: You can't prove gnomes don't exist, so it's just as reasonable
to assume that they do.

6. Demanding opponents disprove your theory rather than you supporting
it.

Example: Prove that a monkey can't be trained to juggle.

7. Confusing theory with evidence.

Example: Denying that the sun goes around the earth is admitting you
are ignoring the evidence of your own eyes.

Faulty Analogies

Analogies are a great way to convey ideas: take a simple comparison and
apply it to something more complex. For example, a colony depends on a
country the way a child depends on its parent. However, analogies are
also an area where logic falls apart, and all sorts of bizarre
conclusions can be reached.

1. Applying a flawed analogy to an argument

Example: You can get a computer to control a rocket, therefore you can
get your toaster to drive your car.

2. Extending an analogy beyond its logical limits

Example: Electricity flows through wires like water through a hose.

Therefore, you can stop the electricity by pinching the cord.

3. Extrapolation without understanding the mechanics involved

Example: You can train a dog to fetch a stick, therefore you can train
it to play the piano.

4. Extrapolation beyond all logic

Example: I can lift two hundred pounds easily. Therefore, I can pick up
the Sear's Tower.

5. Irrelevant comparisons

Example: A cow's a better pet than a sperm whale.

Experts

Experts are just that: someone who has demonstrated that they have a
great deal of knowledge in a certain area. Of course, experts can and
do make mistakes, but it would be silly to ignore the advice of an
expert on the possibility that they may be in error when you are not an
expert yourself. The most important thing to do is consider what the
expert says. Is it logical? Is it consistent? Does it agree with what
is known on the subject? Can general statements be verified? An expert
should not be followed like lemmings, but nor should their expertise be
ignored.

1. Ignoring the information of an expert without reason

Example: You may have a degree in medicine, but I still don't believe I
have a spleen.

2. Intelligence by osmosis

Example: My mother is a lawyer, so I know what you're doing is
illeagal.

3. Failing to realize that information is lost when passed along

Example: I told my Chemistry professor your theory on chemical bonds
and he thinks it's wrong, so it must be.

4. Accepting the advice of a known idiot

Example: I know Bill said that it rains donuts, but that doesn't mean
he doesn't know anything about weather.

5. Considering oneself an expert with no training

Example: Who says you need to go to school to learn demolitions.

6. Failure to grasp statistics

Example: I won three games of Russian Roulette, therefore the game is
safe.

Deceitfulness

The first completely new category added to logical flaws. These
arguements are usually employed by someone who is deliberately trying
to cloud the issue rather than discuss things rationally. Not exactly
stupid, they take great effort to accomplish nothing.

1. The Strawman tactic (attributing foolish arguments to your opponent)

Example: You say that perjurers should go to jail, but all perjury is
is lying. Quite frankly, it's absurd to throw all lyars in prison, and
you're a fool for thinking so.

2. Claiming to be misquoted

Example: I didn't mean that Hitler was a good guy, just that I could
see why someone might think he's a good guy.

3. The magicians tactic(distracting away from the issue)

Example: My dog was not on your lawn, and why haven't your bushes been
trimmed.

4. Ignoring the issue by accusing the opponent

Example: Guess what Mr. Kettle, you're black.

5. Making the opponent the issue instead of the argument

Example: That sounds just like something a bigot would say.

6. Characterizing the opponent

Example: Of course you don't agree with my theory; most people with
prejudices don't.

Plain Stupidity

Crossing all kinds of logical boundaries, these are ideas that show the
world that not only are you illogical, you are also an idiot. Avoid
them like the plague!

1. Assuming that everyone is like you

Example: I don't know anything about Biology, therefore you don't
either.

2. Failure to understand that words have definitions

http://www.sfdebris.com/lah.html

Example: The president isn't a criminal just because he broke the law.

3. Believing special circumstances are the norm

Example: A doctor stole a man's kidney to make money. Therefore, all
doctors are untrustworthy and greedy.

4. Failure to grasp what is real

Example: If I had to, I could deliver a baby. I've seen it hundreds of
times on television.

5. Demonstrating that common sense requires effort on your part

Example: If we could drive faster, we'd get there much sooner.

6. Demonstrating supreme ignorance in the topic being discussed

Example: If we just print more money, everybody could be rich.

7. Attacking the opponent instead of the argument

Example: Sure, you know more about literature, but that's

Kant would make a claim that the two things we can know the best are
space and time, else we would't have the space or times to participate
in concepts about our selves.

The information you seek seems to have not yet arrived but we are
trying to find it. Every time we make progress, on the useless goal of
complete justification, we find the same weakness in human inferencial
capacities and their relation to particular abstract concepts that seem
to bother us for some reason and then we make devices, numbers and
action that seem to -compensate- for our mental weakness in these
areas.

Hint, you can NOT use the word truth in your answer, you are required

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The first rule of depression: Think!

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The second rule: Think beyond.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Know yourself first, then thinking becomes healthy.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thinking, unhealthily or healthily, is still an avoidance of being
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; alone. It is still an avoidance of interactions with others. When one
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meditates, for example, they disengage themselves from all other
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; humans. One does the same when they think, they disengage from
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; interactions with others for interactions with the self.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Labelling it healthy (or unhealthy) does not change the 'reality' of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what takes place.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Unless of course you consider the possibility that all interaction is
&gt; &gt;&gt; synchronised thinking.

&gt; &gt;&gt; My &quot;healthy&quot; comment was in the context of an individuall's depression .

&gt; &gt; I appreciate your intention. The issue though, is that whether one's
&gt; &gt; thinking results in depression or in other states of mind or being,
&gt; &gt; that when one is engaged in that activity they are disengaged from
&gt; &gt; others and the environment. To make any argument then, of a
&gt; &gt; philosophical now moment becomes false.

&gt; &gt; To mediatate and become self-aware of what happens in the body
&gt; &gt; (breathing for example) is only a partial slice of what is actual in
&gt; &gt; the moment.

&gt; &gt; As I was meditating last Friday, there were many people around me,
&gt; &gt; passing me, buildings, other activity. I was, for the most part,
&gt; &gt; unaware of them while my focus was internal.

&gt; &gt; The larger issue for me is in the directed concentration where one
&gt; &gt; &quot;must&quot; focus one's attention rather allowing all that which is in the
&gt; &gt; external and internal enviroment to exist and be part of awareness. The
&gt; &gt; focus of energy (such as meditating on a flame, a though, or one's
&gt; &gt; breathing) is an attempt to avoid focusing on what the mind finds
&gt; &gt; interesting.

&gt; Which is why I suggest contemplation is a more advanced activity than
&gt; meditation.
">

Contemplation may 'feel' better, however, the underlying process
remains the same. For you to contemplate what someone has said to you
today ( a world issue, a philosophical question, etc.), is to go into
your mind and have a discussion with your self. In contemplating, you
avoid discussing with others and avoid the quiet and silence of having
no internal discussion. In the same way that people sitting together in
a room will become quickly uncomfortable if there is a lack of
conversation. The more prolonged the silence, the more difficulty that
people have.

I have yet to meet another human who can tolerate, let alone welcome,
inner silence for more than a few moments or a few minutes at a time.

Thank you for all the information related to that particular theory and
treatment option.

Depression is nothing more than a linguistic pointer to a belief that
'life is not worth living'. The more one thinks about the reasons why
life is not worth living, the more depressed they become.

You could invest in CBT or you could check into the reasons why life is
worth living and why life isn't worth living.

With the amount of thinking that has gone on in the last couple of millenia,
you would "think" that we would be up to our earlobes with answers.

An early mentor of mine suggested (when I expressed a desire to study
philosophy), that pholosophers look for answers, whereby 'spiritual
warriors' find them.

My time here continues to validate that proposition :-)

There is a difference between justifying what we do (you need not do
that for me) and understanding the nature of our actions.

If we came up with the answers, there would be no need to think. If we
had no reason to think and if we had the answers, we would be able to
deal with being alone. And of course, if one perceives thinking as a
need, then we are likely to act based on that belief. Thinking is not a
need in the same way that one can die if they don't feed themselves for
days, or if they lack oxygen for more than a few minutes. Although, if
one believes that they could die without thought, again, they are
unlikely to find periods away from thinking.

We are argued as being a social species. While each of us may find
ourselves physically alone for one reason or another, silence in the
mind is difficult to come by. Contemplation, in my opinion, is nothing
more than the ability to endure moments of inner silence, boredom and
being alone. (Ironically, I also call that state 'rest'.)

Sadly, all of my mentors struggle far more than I do in any area that
they have hoped to teach me about. The most notable being one who
cannot be still on a plane for 8 hours.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The first rule of depression: Think!

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The second rule: Think beyond.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Know yourself first, then thinking becomes healthy.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thinking, unhealthily or healthily, is still an avoidance of being
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; alone. It is still an avoidance of interactions with others. When
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meditates, for example, they disengage themselves from all other
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; humans. One does the same when they think, they disengage from
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; interactions with others for interactions with the self.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Labelling it healthy (or unhealthy) does not change the 'reality' of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what takes place.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Unless of course you consider the possibility that all interaction is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; synchronised thinking.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; My &quot;healthy&quot; comment was in the context of an individuall's depression
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; .

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I appreciate your intention. The issue though, is that whether one's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; thinking results in depression or in other states of mind or being,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that when one is engaged in that activity they are disengaged from
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; others and the environment. To make any argument then, of a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; philosophical now moment becomes false.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To mediatate and become self-aware of what happens in the body
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (breathing for example) is only a partial slice of what is actual in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the moment.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As I was meditating last Friday, there were many people around me,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; passing me, buildings, other activity. I was, for the most part,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unaware of them while my focus was internal.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The larger issue for me is in the directed concentration where one
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;must&quot; focus one's attention rather allowing all that which is in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; external and internal enviroment to exist and be part of awareness. The
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; focus of energy (such as meditating on a flame, a though, or one's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; breathing) is an attempt to avoid focusing on what the mind finds
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; interesting.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Which is why I suggest contemplation is a more advanced activity than
&gt; &gt;&gt; meditation.

&gt; &gt; Contemplation may 'feel' better, however, the underlying process
&gt; &gt; remains the same. For you to contemplate what someone has said to you
&gt; &gt; today ( a world issue, a philosophical question, etc.), is to go into
&gt; &gt; your mind and have a discussion with your self.

&gt; Not the interpretation of contemplation as I am referring to. Stepping
&gt; outside of the mind, in full consciousness is what I mean, where one can
&gt; observe the mind al all its intricacies, as opposed to staying within the
&gt; minds limitations and attempting to quieten it.
">

One cann experience full consciousness. To be aware of what is internal
as through contemplation requires a lack of awareness of other things.
Try carrying on a conversation with someone who is contemplating.

At any rate, this seems to be justification to continue to think.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;In contemplating, you
&gt; &gt; avoid discussing with others and avoid the quiet and silence of having
&gt; &gt; no internal discussion. In the same way that people sitting together in
&gt; &gt; a room will become quickly uncomfortable if there is a lack of
&gt; &gt; conversation. The more prolonged the silence, the more difficulty that
&gt; &gt; people have.

&gt; Which is the very reason few talk about the downside of &quot;succseful&quot;
&gt; meditating. Your last sentence says it all.
">

Contemplating to avoid silence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I have yet to meet another human who can tolerate, let alone welcome,

&gt; A healthy response. I have never met anyone who hasnt practiced &quot;spiritual
&gt; exercises&quot; that hasnt amazed themselves regarding their own innate wisdom
&gt; coming to the surface.

This is no more spiritual than ceasing to speak for 5 minutes in a room
of people.

&gt; &gt; Depression is nothing more than a linguistic pointer to a belief that
&gt; &gt; 'life is not worth living'. The more one thinks about the reasons why
&gt; &gt; life is not worth living, the more depressed they become.

&gt; &gt; You could invest in CBT or you could check into the reasons why life is
&gt; &gt; worth living and why life isn't worth living.

&gt; A chicken /egg question. Which do you believe comes first, depressive
&gt; thinking as you describe above, or the related pathalogical chemical
&gt; imbalances?
">

I don't think that it matters.

If thinking about X results in one being depressed, think about
something else, or cease to think for awhile.

To be depressed (regardless of cause) is to make an observation about
one's state of existence, one's perspective of the future, and one's
beliefs about the self. A person who is depressed is often hopeless, of
course, one could cease to think that life is hopeless.

&gt; &gt;&gt; With the amount of thinking that has gone on in the last couple of
&gt; &gt;&gt; millenia,
&gt; &gt;&gt; you would &quot;think&quot; that we would be up to our earlobes with answers.

&gt; &gt;&gt; An early mentor of mine suggested (when I expressed a desire to study
&gt; &gt;&gt; philosophy), that pholosophers look for answers, whereby 'spiritual
&gt; &gt;&gt; warriors' find them.

&gt; &gt;&gt; My time here continues to validate that proposition :-)

&gt; &gt; There is a difference between justifying what we do (you need not do
&gt; &gt; that for me) and understanding the nature of our actions.

&gt; I only ever point out what I have discovered, and am sure of.

&gt; &gt; If we came up with the answers, there would be no need to think.

&gt; We have to think to find answers, but the answers &quot;thinking&quot; produces lead
&gt; to more questions. A good exercise for the mental body, not unlike the sort
&gt; the physical body requires to stay healthy.
">

These are rather vague objectives to have from my view. What is the
question that one seeks to answer. Without knowing the question, how
does one find the answer?

Why do I feel X, or why do I think Y is the individual finding
shortcoming with the self. The self passes judgment on the self.

In a world where thinking is healthy and not thinking is unhealthy, it
is easy to see where one will directs one's attention and action.

Both are healthy. Both are unhealthy.

&gt; 'happy&quot; with &quot;dealing with&quot; here).

The main theory with the most evidence is that depression is an
instinctual response, (a_yeilding) as in yeild to passing traffic.
Depression is theorized to be a "change in status" which can
automatically cause a lowering of the head and the mood in preparation
fo da new boss loc. Submit now, restrain that self!

RANK THEORY from
Evolutionary Psychology
(2nd edition 2001)
by Anthony Stevens &amp; John Price
http://www.huxley.net/rankmood/

"...rank theory proposes that depression is an adaptive response to
losing rank and conceiving of oneself as a loser. The adaptive function
of the depression, according to rank theory, is to facilitate losing
and to promote accommodation to the fact that one has lost. In other
words, the depressive state evolved to promote the acceptance of the
subordinate role and the loss of resources which can only be secured by
holding higher rank in the dominance hierarchy. The function of this
depressive adaptation is to prevent the loser in a status conflict from
suffering further injury and to preserve the stability and competitive
efficiency of the group by maintaining social homeostasis.

In circumstances of defeat and enforced subordination, an internal
inhibitory process comes into operation which causes the individual to
cease competing and reduce his level of aspiration. This inhibitory
process is involuntary and results in the loss of energy, depressed
mood, sleep disturbance, poor appetite, retarded movements, and loss of
confidence which are typical characteristics of depression.

The selective advantage of an evolved capacity for the recognition and
acceptance of rank difference in social groups is that it reduces
aggressiveness and establishes precedence in granting rights of access
to indispensable resources such as territory, food, and potential
mates. It follows that gaining rank is associated with elevated mood
and losing rank with depressed mood. The evolutionary advantage of
living in groups is the protection it provides from predators. For Homo
sapiens it also afforded protection from other hominid groups. Living
in a group became crucial for safety, for access to resources, for
co-operative hunting of large game, and for reproductive success. A
sense of belonging has thus become indispensable to our physical and
mental security. To be popular and hold rank within a group are
immensely desirable accomplishments; to perceive oneself as unpopular
and without rank are causes of misery and unhappiness; while to be
rejected from the group altogether is one of life's greatest disasters.
It is in terms of these factors that joy and sorrow, mania and
depression, contentment and anxiety can be most readily understood.

One important contribution of rank theory is that it has proposes a
hypothesis of how depression actually evolved: it emerged as the
yielding component of ritual agonistic conflict. This has been called
the yielding subroutine (Price and Sloman, 1987). The adaptive function
of the yielding subroutine is twofold: first, it ensures that the
yielder truly yields and does not attempt to make a comeback, and,
second, the yielder reassures the winner that yielding has truly taken
place, so that the conflict ends, with no further damage to the
yielder. Relative social harmony is then restored.

Similarly, we may offer the hypothesis that mania evolved as the
winning component of ritual agonistic behaviour: the winning
subroutine. Here again, the adaptive function is twofold: first, it
ensures that the winner truly wins and makes clear that any attempt at
a comeback by the yielder will be successfully resisted, and, second,
it ensures that should the yielder attempt to reopen the conflict, the
winner will have such resources of confidence, determination, strength,
and energy that he will force the yielder to yield for good and all.

Both yielding and winning subroutines thus ensure that social change is
accomplished relatively quickly without too much disruption of group
activities and that once it has occurred it will prove lasting. The
object of the losing strategy is damage limitation, that of the winning
strategy is status preservation. Inevitably, such subroutines carry
greater significance among group-living species than among those living
a solitary existence. A solitary animal fights for possession of a
territory. If he loses a contest for one territory, then he must be
able to withdraw and move on to fight for another. Yielding should
involve only a brief "disappointment" on the basis that he who fights
and runs away live to fight another day. Group-living individuals, on
the other hand, require more prolonged and complex winning and losing
subroutines, for a loser may have to give up a position in the
hierarchy that he has held for many years. Should he not greatly modify
his behaviour he could be expelled from the group. Chance's concept of
"reverted escape" becomes relevant here.

That the incidence of depression is higher and its course longer than
hypomania suggest that natural selection has favoured the prolonged
yielding subroutine over its winning equivalent. This could reflect the
evident fact that in any asymmetrical society there are potentially
more losers than winners..."

The Evolution of Depression - Does it Have a Role?
Saturday 3 April  2004

Major and minor depression, even post partum depression - could they
serve an important evolutionary function? Is depression a biological
pathology or an adaptation, critical to our reproductive success and
survival as a species? This week, Natasha Mitchell is joined by two
evolutionary biologists who argue that our capacity to be depressed has
evolved over millennia to help us respond to and cope with difficult
social circumstances. It's a deeply controversial thesis that, they
argue, could have implications for how we read and treat depression in
a therapeutic setting. But critics are concerned about what these
implications might be.

Natasha Mitchell: And hello, welcome to All in the Mind, Natasha
Mitchell joining you once again. This week a controversial discussion
that's sure to provoke - depression, could it in fact serve an
important evolutionary function? Is it an illness or a biological
adaptation critical to our reproductive success and survival as a
species?

Ed Hagen: I actually suspect that it's not an illness and so I
decided to pursue an alternative theory that depression actually serves
a useful function, or at least did serve a useful function for our
ancestors over evolutionary time. This is a very radical proposal that
goes against virtually everything that psychiatry believes and it may
well be wrong but I think it's something that's worth considering.

Paul Watson: : People who are invested in the disease model of
depression have been studying it for a long, long time. I think a lot
of them would admit that they still don't understand what depression
is. Certainly it's a state of mind that causes great misery, is very
painful.

Natasha Mitchell: And suicide in some cases.

Paul Watson: : And suicide, but that does not mean there is not a set
of adaptations working in the mind that are trying to further the
person's life at least from a biological perspective. Within the next
50 - 100 - 200 years, it doesn't really matter, the
pharmaceutical industry is going to have our neurochemistry down to the
point where they will be able to save us from having any adversive
experience whatsoever, no matter how our life is actually going. Before
we start turning off all these unpleasant experiences, we need to know
what those unpleasant experiences are for - to understand what the
potential function of depression is in human life.

Natasha Mitchell: Evolutionary biologists Drs Edward Hagen and Paul
Watson. The World Health Organisation has predicted that by the year
2020 unipolar depression will account for the second largest burden of
disease. Which is a staggering statistic and one that makes the
suggestion that depression might have an evolutionary purpose
understandably implausible. After all how could an experience that
makes us feel so bad sometimes for so long, be good for the species?
What use might our ancestral mind have had for depression?

Dr Daniel Nettle is Lecturer in Psychology at the University of
Newcastle upon Tyne and author of Strong Imagination: Madness,
Creativity and Human Nature.

Daniel Nettle: Darwin of course is best remembered for the Origin of
Species in which he said that things that animal species have are there
because they've helped them to survive and reproduce. But he also

&gt; &gt; Kant would make a claim that the two things we can know the best are
&gt; &gt; space and time, else we would't have the space or times to participate
&gt; &gt; in concepts about our selves.

&gt; That's an interesting claim, but I'm not sure I buy it.  I think Kant was an
&gt; imbecile.
">

Can you explain how Kant was an imbecile? Have you ever heard of his
book, The Critique Of Pure Reason? Here are some of his words from it
on space and time;

If we remove from our empirical concept of a body, one by one, every
feature in it which is [merely] empirical, the colour, the hardness or
softness, the weight, even the impenetrability, there still remains the
space which the body (now entirely vanished) occupied, and this cannot
be removed. Again, if we remove from our empirical concept of any
object, corporeal or incorporeal, all properties which experience has
taught us, we yet cannot take away that property through which the
object is thought as substance or as inhering in a substance (although
this concept of substance is more determinate than that of an object in
general). Owing, therefore, to the necessity with which this concept of
substance forces itself upon us, we have no option save to admit that
it has its seat in our faculty of a priori knowledge.

Time is not an empirical concept that has been derived from any
experience. For neither coexistence nor succession would ever come
within our perception, if the representation of time were not
presupposed as underlying them a priori. Only on the presupposition of
time can we represent to ourselves a number of things as existing at
one and the same time (simultaneously) or at different times
(successively).

Time is a necessary representation that underlies all [A31/P075]
intuitions. We cannot, in respect of appearances in general, remove
time itself, though we can quite well think time as void of
appearances. Time is, therefore, given a priori. In it alone is
actuality of appearances possible at all. Appearances may, one and all,
vanish; but time (as the universal condition of their possibility)
cannot itself be removed.

Time itself does not alter, but only something which is in time. The
concept of time thus presupposes the perception of something existing
and of the succession of its determinations; that is to say, it
presupposes experience.

http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/ethics/kant/reason/ch01.htm

That space and time are only forms of sensible intuition, and so only
conditions of the existence of things as appearances; that, moreover,
we have no concepts of understanding, and consequently no elements for
the knowledge of things, save in so far as intuition can be given
corresponding to these concepts; and that we can therefore have no
knowledge of any object as thing in itself, but only in so far as it is
an object of sensible intuition, that is, an appearance...Thus it does
indeed follow that all possible speculative knowledge of reason is
limited to mere objects of experience. ...though We cannot know these
objects as things in themselves, we must yet be in position at least to
think them as things in themselves; otherwise we should be landed in
the absurd conclusion that there can be appearance without anything
that appears.

&gt; &gt; Depression is nothing more than a linguistic pointer to a belief that

&gt; &gt; life is not worth living, the more depressed they become.

&gt; The main theory with the most evidence is that depression is an

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; nature of truth?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The first rule of depression: Think!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The second rule: Think beyond.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Know yourself first, then thinking becomes healthy.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thinking, unhealthily or healthily, is still an avoidance of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; being
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; alone. It is still an avoidance of interactions with others. When
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meditates, for example, they disengage themselves from all other
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; humans. One does the same when they think, they disengage from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; interactions with others for interactions with the self.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Labelling it healthy (or unhealthy) does not change the 'reality'
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what takes place.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Unless of course you consider the possibility that all interaction
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; synchronised thinking.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; My &quot;healthy&quot; comment was in the context of an individuall's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; depression
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; .

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I appreciate your intention. The issue though, is that whether one's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; thinking results in depression or in other states of mind or being,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that when one is engaged in that activity they are disengaged from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; others and the environment. To make any argument then, of a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; philosophical now moment becomes false.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To mediatate and become self-aware of what happens in the body
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (breathing for example) is only a partial slice of what is actual in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the moment.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As I was meditating last Friday, there were many people around me,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; passing me, buildings, other activity. I was, for the most part,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unaware of them while my focus was internal.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The larger issue for me is in the directed concentration where one
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;must&quot; focus one's attention rather allowing all that which is in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; external and internal enviroment to exist and be part of awareness.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; focus of energy (such as meditating on a flame, a though, or one's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; breathing) is an attempt to avoid focusing on what the mind finds
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; interesting.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Which is why I suggest contemplation is a more advanced activity than
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; meditation.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Contemplation may 'feel' better, however, the underlying process
&gt;&gt; &gt; remains the same. For you to contemplate what someone has said to you
&gt;&gt; &gt; today ( a world issue, a philosophical question, etc.), is to go into
&gt;&gt; &gt; your mind and have a discussion with your self.

&gt;&gt; Not the interpretation of contemplation as I am referring to. Stepping
&gt;&gt; outside of the mind, in full consciousness is what I mean, where one can
&gt;&gt; observe the mind al all its intricacies, as opposed to staying within the
&gt;&gt; minds limitations and attempting to quieten it.

&gt; One cann experience full consciousness. To be aware of what is internal
&gt; as through contemplation requires a lack of awareness of other things.
&gt; Try carrying on a conversation with someone who is contemplating.

&gt; At any rate, this seems to be justification to continue to think.

&gt;&gt; &gt;In contemplating, you
&gt;&gt; &gt; avoid discussing with others and avoid the quiet and silence of having
&gt;&gt; &gt; no internal discussion. In the same way that people sitting together in
&gt;&gt; &gt; a room will become quickly uncomfortable if there is a lack of
&gt;&gt; &gt; conversation. The more prolonged the silence, the more difficulty that
&gt;&gt; &gt; people have.

&gt;&gt; Which is the very reason few talk about the downside of &quot;succseful&quot;
&gt;&gt; meditating. Your last sentence says it all.

&gt; Contemplating to avoid silence.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I have yet to meet another human who can tolerate, let alone welcome,
&gt;&gt; &gt; inner silence for more than a few moments or a few minutes at a time.

&gt;&gt; A healthy response. I have never met anyone who hasnt practiced
&gt;&gt; &quot;spiritual
&gt;&gt; exercises&quot; that hasnt amazed themselves regarding their own innate wisdom
&gt;&gt; coming to the surface.

&gt; This is no more spiritual than ceasing to speak for 5 minutes in a room
&gt; of people.

That IS spiritual, as long as you are not reading others script, which
becomes acting.

&gt;&gt; A chicken /egg question. Which do you believe comes first, depressive
&gt;&gt; thinking as you describe above, or the related pathalogical chemical
&gt;&gt; imbalances?

&gt; I don't think that it matters.

&gt; If thinking about X results in one being depressed, think about
&gt; something else, or cease to think for awhile.

&gt; To be depressed (regardless of cause) is to make an observation about
&gt; one's state of existence, one's perspective of the future, and one's
&gt; beliefs about the self. A person who is depressed is often hopeless, of
&gt; course, one could cease to think that life is hopeless.
