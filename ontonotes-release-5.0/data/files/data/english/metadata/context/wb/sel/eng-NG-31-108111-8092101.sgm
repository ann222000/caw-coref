A few weeks ago,I attended a judges seminar. While there, I was literally
accosted by a judge, being a new face, She immediately asked me what my breed
was. She informed me that Elkhounds were not suitable dogs for tracking, and
I really needed either German Shepherd Dogs or Australian Cattle dogs in
order to be gratified with success. Of course, she happened to have some to
sell, as well as videos, books, seminars, etc.

The cutest Australian Cattle Dog ever just came into my life via my neighbors
timely vacation plans.  Life around here has become &quot;interesting&quot; and very
challenging.
Having just had this breed so strongly pushed as being the panacea for
everything, I just have to wonder if rescues are being  over run with these
perfect dogs.

Day two of this little guy. Boy is he ever CUTE! SIX days to go. Lord help me
to please let us both survive his parent's return!!!!!!!!

We get a LOT of them at the shelter.  They are restricted adoption,
meaning adopters have to demonstrate knowledge of the breed and such.

I can see why. This woman is a judge. She's supposed  to know dog
responsibility.

I can't imagine walking up to a perfect stranger and offering this breed
as &quot;the answer&quot;, when i was unaware that there was even a question.
This woman is 20 decades older than myself. I can't imagine her keeping up
with this breed.

I can totally understand restricted adoption. I can also see the appeal
for them if you have a highly active lifestyle and unlimited time tp spend
with them and needed a project in your life.

but to be so forward in insisting this is THE breed for me is so totally
surprising, after two days with this dog. Challenging.. YES. Boring?
NEVER.

The neighbors left with me with orders to train this dog!
He's smart. He's trainable. Ohhhhh what a headache.

He's so much the WRONG dog for me. I couldn't stand to live with the cute
thing.  His saving grace right now is his extreme cuteness. That doesn't
wash with me.

I can hardly wait until he goes home. It's going to be a long long week.

This match.. deemed by others to be perfect for you is remininscent of
someone peddling Anatolians as the perfect dog for a complete dog novice
who  is such a dog novice.. that they had to come here to ask what breed
they need. Or by thinking you are doing a disabled person a favor who
can't control the dog they have and insisting that your &quot;large, out of
control headache , unwanted-- MOVE FAST!!!&quot; Dog would be the perfect match
for them.

yeah right.

You know what?
I can see Paul posting Lucky in a Free To Good home ad. And then not
following up. I can see Lucky being snapped up by a buncher for profit, and
Lucky would become not so Lucky after all.

I bet Paul doesn't even have a clue Bunchers are out there. Oh, and right now
Large dogs are going well for Dog fighting bait as well as research

Boggles.

I used to board dogs in my home, 1 at a time, when I had just 1 dog of
my own.  A very wide range of breeds, mostly puppies or young dogs, but
some mature dogs and even seniors as well.  It was a very good education
about characteristics that I wouldn't want to live with, many of them
breed specific/related.

Just say no to terriers in a house with cats!  I do NOT want Kuvasz in
my visitor-friendly household.    While I love working with them in many
respects, sighthounds are not for me.  Resting your head on my dining
room table (yes, I know that's training) is yucky - especially with an
IW beard.  I could go on......

&lt;&lt;  Having just had this breed so strongly pushed as being the panacea
for everything, I just have to wonder if rescues are being ?over run
with these perfect dogs. &gt;&gt;

They seem to populate rescue, but I've never seen or heard anyone
promote them.  Personally I don't think most of the herding breeds
belong in an average home.  In general they require a higher
commitment to providing physical and mental exercise, plus many still
have strong guarding instincts not necessarily appropriate for
suburbia.

I wish aussies and BC weren't on TV everywhere.  Even though Shy is
quite mellow for an aussie, when people compliment me on her
deportment I'm quick to lie and tell them that she requires an
investment of my time, and that she's only mellow because she gets
regular training and exercise.  I figure it's for the greater good of
the breed.  She's one that would be super in an apartment, with just
walks for pottys, so long as she gets some regular mental enrichment,
but there aren't many like her in rescue and I don't want to give that
impression.  To be honest, it's rare that I recommend my favorite
breed, most of the time I argue against them.

Hope

This little guy is a very busy, very smart, sunny dispositioned, into
everything, and so intent on doing things HIS way, and being very devious
in seeing his way succeeds.  He doesn't appreciate my no-nonsense trend to
control and dominate things. He seeks amusement to outwit me and
circumvent my every mission.
Escaping the yard and running home has been twice accomplished today by
climbing on top of the dog house, leaping to the garage roof, and heading
out to the pasture, running across a cornfield and headed for home. Little
twerp has a good sense of direction, because it's possible he could be
lost until harvest time if he did not succeed.
He was then allowed out time on a harness/trolly system, which he figured
how to slip out of. Last out, he was on the harness/buckle collar
combination where the clip is double attached to both the harness loop AND
the buckle collar loop. He hasn't figured out how to escape that.

He has learned that barking does not pay (Yeesh what an obnoxious voice)
nor jumping on people or things. He gets attention for sitting quietly.
He's learned sit/down today.

He's a very &quot;in your face&quot; type dog, needing attention constantly.
Currently every bid for attention is being rebuffed, yet as soon as he
sits quietly by my side, he then gets picked up and petted.

He seems to think rules are made to be broken.

I have no right to enforce them.

Everywhere I go with Bella, I hear stories of families that had to give
up their Aussies because they were too &quot;active&quot;. Usually it's a young
teenaged girl that tells me this. I assume that the puppy was picked on

This puppy ranks with the best in cute factor. I'm positive most of his
behavior issues are because of a doting family spoiling this adorable
child. They just can't say &quot;NO&quot;, and they acknowledge he rules the roost.
He can't understand why I don't agree here.
And Tuck and Reka make themselves scarce, because he's a bigger challenge
than either wish to deal with. Escape is their only option, because they
know they may not take action and fix it.

I don't think his issues are any more severe than any other puppies in a
spoiled household. It's good fortune for him that his family took a
vacation at this stage of his development, before these behaviors get out
of hand.... and he gets bigger.

He's a rescue about to happen.

his cute factor is his own worst enemy

Um yeah.  It's that upwardly mobile thing that so many herding dogs
get into.  Give them an inch, they take a mile.  :)  For me that is
part of what is so enchanting about aussies, but for most households
it's what causes the downward spiral into rescue or a meeting with the
needle.

Yup, and the magic cure is a farm with room for them to run.
Grrrrrrrr!!!!  The thing is, a dedicated person can indeedy handle
aussies in an apartment.  I know of two people who had multiple
aussies (4 and 6) in an apartment situation, but they worked their
butts off to give them plenty of exercise and training.  It just makes
me so mad when people contact me wanting to give up their aussie
because they need too much exercise (get off your butt), are too hairy
(get a better vaccuum), or are barking / snapping at strangers (do
your research - the breed should have guarding instincts that need
appropriately channeled - and get a backbone and give them some
leadership).

Oh My........you have your hands full.  He sounds like a very head strong
dog.

Gabby is just turning 4 months old and beginning the obnoxious behavior.
She's discovered barking..........arrggggggg.  I swear last night she was
doing it just to hear her self.  We are working on getting her to understand
what quiet means but it's difficult.  I finally last night wacked her on the
nose with a piece of paper when she was barking.  It's not something I
normally do but she was right in my face jumping at the chair and barking.
She jumped back startled and just looked at me then finally went and laid
down.   I was a lot quieter the rest of the evening.

She has much more of the husky behavior in her than the lab and it's going
to take a lot of work I think.  Oh well I'm in it for the long haul it's
just something we have to work on.

This little guy has tried the barking routine. I started with just plain a
spritz of water to the face. He loved it.

back to the drawing board.

He got 10% vinegar to the face, and he decided barking wasn't so much fun.

I think we solved that problem before we got started.

He loves to jump. He's the sproingiest puppy I ever had.

He has learned today that sproing gets no attention. But a quiet sit gets
cookies, and a nice down gets lots of cuddles.  His ideas on how to get
attention have turned topsy turvey. Quiet gets good stuff, noise and
commotion gets bad stuff.

His owners just called for an update. I told them it was a good thing they
called this evening, because they wouldn't have had such a wonderful
report this morning. I proceeded to give them the run down on Riley's
activities.

he's a totally different dog than he was this morning.

Ohhhh Diddy,
I can just see you going crazy while dog sitting.  The big problem is
that your dogs excell in the good behavior department.  Now you have
three heathens in your care, it has got to be rough.
Ahhh, the little pup sounds sweet.  He knows where his home is and he
wants to go there.  No one told him his people are going to come back.
Something tells me they are not going to recognize their new pup.
Something else tells me they will probably let him slide back into his
bad behavior.  Maybe not.
Good Luck....oh yeah, wish I lived closer I would like to drop off a
couple of dogs while I go away for a MONTH.

I think somewhere it's been said that distance makes the heart grow fonder.

Actually the little guy has been wonderful tonight. We've played retrieving
games, and did obedience exercises and he loved being challenged in brain
games. I also gave him Tuck's educational toys, and he's having a ball with
them, although Tuck isn't really too pleased about the whole thing.

&gt;&gt; for them.

&gt;&gt; yeah right.

&gt; You know what?
&gt; I can see Paul posting Lucky in a Free To Good home ad. And then not
&gt; following up. I can see Lucky being snapped up by a buncher for profit,
&gt; and
&gt; Lucky would become not so Lucky after all.

&gt; I bet Paul doesn't even have a clue Bunchers are out there. Oh, and right
&gt; now
&gt; Large dogs are going well for Dog fighting bait as well as research
&gt; candidates.

Someone called me and said they would post her on Freecycle, but I have not
yet seen the ad. Wherever she goes, I will make sure the people make an
effort to meet her and work with her to make sure they can handle her, and
I will also insist on a home visit to make sure there are no red flags
there. I will also try to get one of the rescues to handle the official
adoption, so as to reduce my legal liabilities. I would also assume the
adoption agency would request a donation, and that is a good assurance that
someone will not make a profit from a totally &quot;free&quot; dog.

I have made a commitment to her welfare, but it has been nice having only
Muttley to care for since Saturday. I could be fully confident that I could
leave him for 8-12 hours in the house, and then just take him on a short
walk and feed him. He asked for an additional time outside, and now he is
sleeping quietly. We have a good cooperative arrangement, and demand only
reasonable behavior from each other.

Lucky is not an &quot;out of control&quot; dog. She is powerful, and needs more
training, but my *disabled* friend Helene has been able to handle her on
leash, whereas she would not be able to control Muttley. Helene has only
limited use of one arm due to a stroke when she was in nursing school.
Sometimes a larger dog can be a help for a disabled person. It was worth a
try, anyway.

Paul, there you go scratching your fingernails on the blackboard -AGAIN.
There is so much wrong with your logic that I'm speechless.

But let me tell you this..

Larger dogs helping the handicapped have months of training by people
knowledgable enough to train them. Do not expect someone who already has
training issues with their own dogs to automagically turn a sows ear into a
silk purse.

That's true about large dogs.  When Susie was alive, while walking her in
the forest alone one winter day, I  fell on snow-covered ice and hit my head
on the ice.  I was in a lot of pain.   I called her over and she just stood
next to me, while I put all my weight on her back to get up, and it took a
long while.
Two years ago when walking Devon alone in the forest, I tripped on uneven
ground, which had a stone on it, and fell again and fractured my foot.
Again, I called Devon over and she stood there and bore the brunt of my
weight on her back, never moving, as I pulled myself off of the ground.
Both dogs were off leash at the time and were not forced to stand there.
Neither dog was trained for service, but seemed instinctively to know what I
was asking them to do.  I use a walking stick now on my daily walks in the
forest.
A person I know, has a service dog which is a Standard Poodle; she has
always used Standard Poodles.  She has MS.  But, a service dog would have to
be a very calm dog and trained for a particular service.

And he wants a rescue group to take legal responsibility for the
placement of a dog they haven't evaluated, only had at their event to

As much maligned as Muttley has been, he showed similar behavior on a
couple of occasions. I slipped on some wet leaves and fell on my butt, and
although he may have been going his own way when that happened, he
immediately came to my side, sat down, and looked at me. If I had been
injured, I probably could have used him to help me up. Whenever I sneeze,
he comes over to me with a concerned expression and puts his paws on me
until I reassure him that I am OK. And when I was sick for a day or two, he
was especially well behaved and did not request to go out as much as usual,
and was happy enough to be let out on his tether to do his business.

I think dogs know when someone is in distress, and they are generally
magnanimous creatures who love to please their masters. I sense in the OP's
case there are other problems going on, and I doubt that Lucky (or maybe
any dog) would be a good choice. But, again, I thought it was worth a try.

He's intoxicatingly cute. And knows it. Terribly stubborn, and once something
sticks in his craw, nothing will dissuade him. He cares not for consequences.
Consequences be dammned!
It's the constant jumping, IN YOUR FACE.. and jumping to be there (GOD he's a
Boingy dog!) and the fact that he zooms under each footstep tripping you
every step of the way.
Don't know how such a little puppy can jump so high.
Persistant is his first name. His owners just &quot;THINK&quot; his name is Riley.

He can't just be content to be with you. He's got to be in your skin. He

All that is puppy stuff, not breed stuff.  Maybe, a couple of

This was when I was working on a sit-stay.

Maybe sproings, but she comes to side (eventually) while I'm
holding her supper dish.  Then stares at it while waiting for
her release.  Good girl at 12 weeks, but intense!  Huzzah!

That's so funny! My training sessions with Queenie would always devolve
like that. I'd ask her to do something, then she would try every trick
she knew: &quot;do you want me to sit? no? down? no? roll over? no? sit
again?&quot; and eventually jump up to kiss my face. She thinks everything we
do together is a big, fun game.

My hubby has a term for the pogo boinging that &quot;Wonky&quot;, our youngest,
does when happy.  He calls it Wonky Go Bonky.  Amazing how high one
little dog can pogo but it's cute in a strange sort of way.  So long
as she can stop when asked!  :)

So that's where I went wrong!  Maybe I should spring (no pun intended)

Let me guess, one is your golden?  Nellie (my field line rescue) does
vertical zoomies.  I've been teaching her go-outs and she gets so
excited she vertically launches herself from right heel to left heel
to get lined up for them.  I told hubby that instead of cup protectors
I need boob protectors.  But I love her enthusiasm, particularly since
she's one that finds obedience very stressful and hard.  She heels
beautifully but it takes sooooooooooo much effort to restrain
herself.  :)

Yep!  He is a PM dog, but very fieldy in most respects.  Franklin, my
FCR, used to come front and then jump straight up and bonk me in the
nose.    Hard to curb that while keeping his enthusiasm!

Your last puppies have been overly serious, not for you, but in
comparison to what normal puppies are.  You just can't picture normal
puppy boingies.  Every puppy I have known has been a boinger.  Scooter
wasn't when we got him.  We could tell how sick he was by comparing
that time to how he is now that he is doing well.  Sometimes I just
need to go into a dark, quiet room to remember that the whole world
isn't constantly in motion.

Buy a Hula Hoop. Bouncy puppies can do very low jumps through and they
can &quot;jump rope&quot;. It's much better on purpose!
