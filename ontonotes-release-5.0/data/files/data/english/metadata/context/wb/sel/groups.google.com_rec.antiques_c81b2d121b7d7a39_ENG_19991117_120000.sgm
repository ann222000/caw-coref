&quot;Some antique stores these days have resorted to posted signs that ask
customers to refrain from snapping digital photos of their goods. On
some occasions, it seems, the photographer posts the photo on an online
auction site, waits until they get a bid that's higher than the shop's
ticket price, and makes the deal.
&quot;The photographer then purchases the antique, turns around and sells
it to the highest bidder and pockets the difference.&quot;

HUH??????? Are antique store owners really that stupid? (Don't answer;
it was a rhetorical question.)

Anyone wishing to photograph my inventory, post it all to an auction
site, and pay me my asking price when they get a better offer, is more
than welcome to do so. (Of course, if I sell it to someone else before
the auction ends, they might be in a bit of trouble.)

Sounds a heckuva lot easier than listing it myself.

What's the difference or the big deal?... you (not just YOU anyone) go
into a dealer's shop, spot something that you think there's a profit in
but for whatever reason you don't wish to take a chance and part with
money. So, you carrying a description in you mind, and off you go hoping
to punt the gear to another dealer/collector that you think may give you
a profit, and on the strength of that, go back and buy the piece of gear
in question?

Or, even, obtaining a picture (or ringing) Christie's front desk and
getting a free appraisal for sale, based upon that, then going back and
buying the object?

Runners (pickers) do more or less the same thing in principle everyday of
the week.

Maybe I should read the article, obviously I am missing something in the
plot. :)

their digital cameras? Send them to me!

"/> I've never seen a sign like that in an antique store. I suspect that as
is seemingly the case with most Web content these days, the reporter talked
to one shop proprietor before writing the article.

Because, when it comes down to it, what happens in the above instance is
that the shop makes a sale. Excuse me for living, but isn't that a GOOD
thing?

&quot;We're not going to let you take pictures of our things because then you
might want to buy them for resale.&quot;

Yeah, right. Anybody who's been in this business for more than 10 minutes
knows that you make a substantial portion of your sales to the trade.

"/> No, Ronnie, of course you aren't missing anything. I had wondered whether it
was generally considered offensive (by dealers) for customers to ask to take
pictures of items in the shops. But you get no argument from me about what you
wrote about the quote. Anyone who puts up such a sign is putting ego ahead of
sales.

"/> No I don't think it's offensive, just as long as the dealer is asked
beforehand ... &quot;excuse me but would you mind awfully if I took a couple
of shots&quot; ... summit like that.

Think it would be offensive, well slightly rude, if someone popped into
another dealers shop and started to fire off rolls of film just out of
the blue, then buggered off without saying a word or a thank you.

But I must admit, it would be fun after they took the shots and punted
the item all over the place, got a real good &quot;promised&quot; price then came
back to buy the item .... it would be fun to say .. &quot;oh sorry that's sold
now, he who hesitates is lost&quot; ... or summit like that ... course it's
not sold and is still setting there bold as brass.

Tell the truth, we have a couple of annoying guys that go around the
trade, never buy anything unless they have a sure-fired punter already
lined up. They will eyeball something, maybe photograph it, then go off
trying to tout it around the trade, telling all sorts of porky-pies, then
comeback in a few days later and will start with a big haggling match. In
a case like that, I would get a kick out telling them it's sold ..even if
it's not sold .. Sure there's always another mug around the corner,
everything sell eventually so why spoil the fun in between.

....... one-upmanship is a great game to play, passes away the slow dark
winter months just after Christmas. ;&gt;))

As the old saying goes, &quot;Don't wish for something; you might get it&quot; -
seems to be the case. I collect one narrow area, and with all the
outlets in New England, probably never spent more than a couple hundred
dollars per year, due to the fact that the items were not very
expensive, plus not that much turned up. With Ebay, my spending and
collection has grown at least ten-fold. In fact, through Ebay bought one
of my &quot;holy grail&quot; items: Sent the check, got the package, looked at the
item once and put it away in a carton with my other stuff. It wasn't the
price, but the method that makes it kind of dull now.

So, I think the fun is going away, but I am probably in the minority.
Nowadays, for most people collecting means putting in your order for the
latest Byer's or other collectible item at a local gift shop. Why not do
it on line?

"/>  We carry these garden benches that are made new of old wood. They are
each unique and made for us locally. We've had people come and take
pictures..and they never ask! When I catch them at it I go out and
mumble something about it being all right to take pictures because his
designs are &quot;Of Course&quot; all copyrighted. That seems to slow them down. I
know they are just planning to try to duplicate the design..and they
know I know. BTW, those folks never buy a bench, nor do they come in the
shop.
I know most of you aren't selling new things, but has this picture
taking thing come up for any of you in this sort of situation?
Crafted/artists items being photographed? Does the artist mind? I'd love
some ideas on how else to handle this.

"/> Some local jewelry stores have a &quot;picture taking prohibited -- our designs
are copyrighted&quot; sign in their window.

Of course the proper thing to do is to ask before photographing someone's
things or before using a picture of theirs. Funny how so few people do.
