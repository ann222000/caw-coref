Dear Everyone-In-My-Life,

First, thanks for being great. I'm incredibly blessed with fantastic friends and I wouldn't trade any of you for anything in the world. I enjoy the time we spend together, and I appreciate all the things you do for and with me.

However, you may want to avoid me for a bit. You see, I've met this great guy last weekend and we have been talking, emailing, and text messaging incessantly all week. I'm very much smitten, and I'm sure you're happy for me.

On the downside, however, I am now prone to gush a bit about how happy I am with this new person in my life. Not only am I concerned with how tolerant you'll be hearing every nauseatingly cute (to me) detail, I also want you to like him. It would not be helpful if you've heard the name Elliot so often before you meet him that you kind of want to slap me. Because, seriously, that's about all I can talk about right now.

Also, he's coming back up to visit Seattle&#151;well, me&#151;later this month. I'm going to be a spazzing-out bundle of nerves probably from the 20th on as I anticipate his arrival and obsess with the cleanliness of my apartment and such, and then I'll have nothing to talk about after the 27th other than Elliot for at least four days.

Normal programming will resume, I hope, after 1 October.

Thanks for your patience and understanding,
Putnawa the Smitten
