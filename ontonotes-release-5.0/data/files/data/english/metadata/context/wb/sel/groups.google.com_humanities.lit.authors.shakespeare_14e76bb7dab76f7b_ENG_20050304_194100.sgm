In the spirit of friendly competition:

I would like to announce that in Portland at the Shakespeare Authorship
Conference on April 7, Roger Stritmatter and I will be presenting the paper
&quot;Shakespeare and the Explorers: Why The Tempest Does Not Depend on
Strachey's True Repertory.&quot;

We've recently made some very significant and exciting discoveries, which,
we believe, will demolish the traditional belief that The Tempest must have
been written in 1611.

Will be ready to discuss this after we've presented. Have had my head buried
in books for weeks.

Regards,
Lynne

Lynne,

I won't press, but are you talking about a plot source for the play or
categorically eliminating the Strachey letter as a primary source for
lines in the play?

Not sure how to estimate my one 1961 source as &quot;traditional belief,&quot;
but I see Bentley's chart on performances and first printings lists
Tempest as performed 1611-12. He notes that Sir Edmond Chambers did
an authoritative job on first composition dates in his 1930
publication. He says production day is traditionally considered the
date of birth, evidently because it's rare to be precise about any of
the plays' dates. He does surmise that plays were performed as soon
as written.

Bentley speculates that Tempest is often grouped with Cymbeline, The
Winters Tale, and The Two Noble Kinsmen as late plays written to be
performed at Blackfriars, not for a public theater as are most of the
plays. I suppose this might mean a substantially different
audience--and style--if true. Another point he raises is that the
stage direction in Tempest, act V, &quot;Here Prospero discovers Ferdinand
and Miranda, playing at chess,&quot; may indicate use of &quot;an inner enclosed
space,&quot; common as one of the three playing areas of the stage.

Enjoy your presentation in Portland, in April.

Yes. Apart from anything else, there is so much info it'll take us that long
at least to put it all in place. And we'd like to do a power point
presentation, which will take time to put together. But it's been VERy
interesting doing the reading and sorting it out--like being a detective. I
still have one big question--which I promise to bring to HLAS.

I think the play is very Shakespearean, particularly in its language, and
I'm pretty sure, with the possible exception of the masque, it was all
written by one person; however, I'm inclined to believe that although the
masque is rather stilted, it was written by Shakespeare also. There's a
small clue to similar sources.

We Oxfordians tend to push the play away because of the traditional dating.
I've never done that. I could hear Shakespeare speaking through the lines.
But here was a puzzle for me: the reliance of The Tempest on Strachey as a
source pushed it well outside Oxford's dates. Moore's and Multhopp's essays
were intriguing, but hardly exhaustive. They were a starting point, but on
their own they didn't do the job.

Excluding Strachey as a necessary source doesn't prove that Oxford was
Shakespeare. But it does remove an impediment to his candidacy.

OK, no more of this. Back to work. :)

Thanks for your interest, everyone.

Regards,
Lynne

Roger take 'A True Declaration' into consideration
or is the pamphlet not relevant to your case? (Why

No, I assume Bently refers to a timely connection between writing and
producing. As we know, publishing/printing of company plays was
contrary to vested interests.

About the FF, I think we have to recognize it as the source of a lot
of &quot;traditional belief.&quot; The general editor of that must have known
what s/he was about for deciding what to include and in what order. I
understand that several plays not included, which some consider
admitting, remain outside the traditional pale/fence. Compared to the
FF, modern Works versions published with some canon variances seem
arbitrary and capricious.

On the other hand, I assume the order in the FF is different than when
plays came along; but Tempest is listed last among the comedies.

I think you would be brave to enter the lions' den of FF ordinance
armed only with applause over discovering something about the Strachey
letter. You may have to practice your perning and gyring for the
firey furnace of peer review, Notes and Queries at least.

But don't worry; if in your quest you suffer pedanic cuts and parries
(awful for a mouse that roars), I assume you always have a warm corner
by the h.l.a.s. fireplace to lick wounds (;-(

bookburn,

Queene Anne was particularly fond of masques
which, according to some, explains the masque written into the play.
There's also material from
the body of the Strachey letter that provides
subplots for The Tempest, for example the Stephano/Stephen Brown
anarchy that took place at Jamestown. I think Kathman's thesis is
pretty defensible. I'm really looking forward to the debate.

Cordially,

Elizabeth

What did she mean by 'excluding the Strachey
letter?'

She used the term 'necessary.' Excluding
Strachey as a 'necessary source.'

I thought Lynne meant that she and Stritmatter
had located hitherto undiscovered evidence
available only to Oxford but now now she seems
to imply that she and Roger have found evidence
that excludes the Strachey letter.

Is she only toying with us?

an interesting webpage about The Tempest

(quote)

THE TEMPEST

Most consider this Shakespeare's last full completed play in his
lifetime and a sort of farewell to the theater. Due to an arbitrary
performance record of November 1, 1611 and a Stratfordian strain to
make travel accounts work as specific sources within the framework of
Shakspere's life, this play's composition has been dated at 1611.

They wave forth William Strachey's account of a shipwreck in 1609 off
the coast of Bermuda and connect it to Ariel's reference to the
&quot;still-vex'd Bermoothes&quot; (I.ii.229). But Strachey's letter from July
15, 1610, was not published until 1625 (Sobran 153); the wreck in The
Tempest doesn't resemble the one in Strachey's account -- in fact,
there isn't a wreck at all; and ample accounts of shipwrecks off
Bermuda existed in the decades earlier (cf. Whalen 120).Besides, the
island in this play is in the Mediterranean.

Ben Jonson's Volpone of 1605 seems to paraphrase and satirize this
play, but Stratfordians claim a common source instead accounts for the
echoes.

1611 is a problem anyway, since James I was no fan of the occult: &quot;The
new king was fanatically opposed to anything to do with magic,
spiritualism or the supernatural&quot;; so &quot;Whoever wrote The Tempest was
uniquely privileged&quot; (Michell 206), or it was written in 1603 or
earlier.

Michell makes a case for William Stanley, sixth Earl of Derby,
as the author (205-211). His older brother, the fifth Earl,
was named Ferdinando and the Earls ruled the Isle of Man,
to the south of which is an island called the Calf of Man
which resembles Prospero's island.

Compound &quot;calf&quot; words appear in the play, in reference to Caliban,
perhaps a representative of the Celtic-speaking Manx inhabitants.

Derby was a son-in-law of Oxford.

Critics have tried to articulate the special sense one receives
from The Tempest. Since its characters are &quot;representative
rather than individual&quot; (Wells 364) and &quot;personality seems
no longer to be a prime Shakespearean concern&quot; (Bloom 673),
instead one senses a &quot;multiplicity of suggestiveness&quot; (Wells 364)
about the play.

&quot;The Tempest has an unrivaled power to inspire
in almost all sensitive readers a belief that
it contains a secret meaning. Even those who make no attempt
to search it out retain the feeling that it is there
and that if it could only be found it would lead close
not merely to the heart of Shakespeare's convictions about life
but close to the heart of life itself&quot; (Goddard 280).

&gt; | &gt; | In the spirit of friendly competition:
&gt; | &gt; |
&gt; | &gt; | I would like to announce that in Portland at the Shakespeare
&gt; | &gt; Authorship
&gt; | &gt; | Conference on April 7, Roger Stritmatter and I will be
&gt; presenting
&gt; | &gt; the paper
&gt; | &gt; | &quot;Shakespeare and the Explorers: Why The Tempest Does Not Depend
&gt; on
&gt; | &gt; | Strachey's True Repertory.&quot;
&gt; | &gt; |
&gt; | &gt; | We've recently made some very significant and exciting
&gt; discoveries,
&gt; | &gt; which,
&gt; | &gt; | we believe, will demolish the traditional belief that The
&gt; Tempest
&gt; | &gt; must have
&gt; | &gt; | been written in 1611.
&gt; | &gt;
&gt; | &gt; Not sure how to estimate my one 1961 source as &quot;traditional
&gt; belief,&quot;
&gt; | &gt; but I see Bentley's chart on performances and first printings
&gt; lists
&gt; | &gt; Tempest as performed 1611-12. He notes that Sir Edmond Chambers
&gt; did
&gt; | &gt; an authoritative job on first composition dates in his 1930
&gt; | &gt; publication. He says production day is traditionally considered
&gt; the
&gt; | &gt; date of birth, evidently because it's rare to be precise about any
&gt; of
&gt; | &gt; the plays' dates. He does surmise that plays were performed as
&gt; soon
&gt; | &gt; as written.
&gt; |
&gt; | Um, bb, are you suggesting that the plays that first turned up in
&gt; the folio
&gt; | were in fact written in 1623?

&gt; No, I assume Bently refers to a timely connection between writing and
&gt; producing. As we know, publishing/printing of company plays was
&gt; contrary to vested interests.

&gt; About the FF, I think we have to recognize it as the source of a lot
&gt; of &quot;traditional belief.&quot; The general editor of that must have known
&gt; what s/he was about for deciding what to include and in what order. I
&gt; understand that several plays not included, which some consider
&gt; admitting, remain outside the traditional pale/fence. Compared to the
&gt; FF, modern Works versions published with some canon variances seem
&gt; arbitrary and capricious.

&gt; On the other hand, I assume the order in the FF is different than when
&gt; plays came along; but Tempest is listed last among the comedies.

&gt; I think you would be brave to enter the lions' den of FF ordinance
&gt; armed only with applause over discovering something about the Strachey
&gt; letter.

My guess is that they've found other sources earlier than the Strachey

This is a secret I'd really like to spill, but I'm still working on
parts of it. Roger is working on other parts of it. And I'd say it's
not so much a secret as a jigsaw puzzle. We're fitting the pieces
together. It's only a month till Portland. Not very much time at all
to do it. And the end of this month and the beginning of April my time
is totally taken up with giving readings and workshops here in Canada,
so I must get on with it.

Perhaps Terry will report back. He'll be in Portland. I'll be back at

| an interesting webpage about The Tempest
|
| (quote)
|
|
| THE TEMPEST
|
| Most consider this Shakespeare's last full completed play in his
| lifetime and a sort of farewell to the theater. Due to an arbitrary
| performance record of November 1, 1611 and a Stratfordian strain to
| make travel accounts work as specific sources within the framework
of
| Shakspere's life, this play's composition has been dated at 1611.
|
| They wave forth William Strachey's account of a shipwreck in 1609
off
| the coast of Bermuda and connect it to Ariel's reference to the
| &quot;still-vex'd Bermoothes&quot; (I.ii.229). But Strachey's letter from July
| 15, 1610, was not published until 1625 (Sobran 153); the wreck in
The
| Tempest doesn't resemble the one in Strachey's account -- in fact,
| there isn't a wreck at all; and ample accounts of shipwrecks off
| Bermuda existed in the decades earlier (cf. Whalen 120).Besides, the
| island in this play is in the Mediterranean.

&quot;Shipwreck&quot; must have been an exciting topic for Elizabethans, what
with the shipwrecks from the Spanish Armada, pirating of shipwrecks
off the coasts, loss of ships at sea from storms, and their uses in
biblical (Jonah, Jesus) and literary treatments. I don't know if there
was any mystery about a Bermuda Triangle, but maybe the Spanish
galleon drivers had their special prayers. There was a genre of
utopias and dystopias, evidently. And here we have shipwreck and
survival of a colony, and also the theme of utopia in a New World,
possibly a New Eden.

Shakespeare was no landlubber, with many instances of plots using
shipwreck as a device to introduce identity confusion or lost fortune.
In Bentley, Twelfth Night gets a first performance date of 1599-1600.
Comedy of Errors gets a 1592-93, and Merchant of Venice, 1596-97.I
notice that in &quot;Shakespeare in Love,&quot; the conclusion describes Twelfth
Night in terms of the violent storm and shipwreck Viola escapes,
supposedly suggested by a real trip to Virginia.

| Ben Jonson's Volpone of 1605 seems to paraphrase and satirize this
| play, but Stratfordians claim a common source instead accounts for
the
| echoes.
|
| 1611 is a problem anyway, since James I was no fan of the occult:
&quot;The
| new king was fanatically opposed to anything to do with magic,
| spiritualism or the supernatural&quot;; so &quot;Whoever wrote The Tempest was
| uniquely privileged&quot; (Michell 206), or it was written in 1603 or
| earlier.

I think Kathman points out that James I wrote a book about witchcraft;
hence, he was interested.

| Michell makes a case for William Stanley, sixth Earl of Derby,
| as the author (205-211). His older brother, the fifth Earl,
| was named Ferdinando and the Earls ruled the Isle of Man,
| to the south of which is an island called the Calf of Man
| which resembles Prospero's island.
|
| Compound &quot;calf&quot; words appear in the play, in reference to Caliban,
| perhaps a representative of the Celtic-speaking Manx inhabitants.
|
| Derby was a son-in-law of Oxford.
|
| Critics have tried to articulate the special sense one receives
| from The Tempest. Since its characters are &quot;representative
| rather than individual&quot; (Wells 364) and &quot;personality seems
| no longer to be a prime Shakespearean concern&quot; (Bloom 673),
| instead one senses a &quot;multiplicity of suggestiveness&quot; (Wells 364)
| about the play.

I predict Tempest is the most likely Shakespeare play to receive
re-creation according to the discipline of popular taste, lending
itself well to science fiction treatments, like on Star Trek, and
meaningful parables of survival and &quot;lifeboat&quot; analogues of the human
predicament.

| &quot;The Tempest has an unrivaled power to inspire

| and that if it could only be found it would lead close
| not merely to the heart of Shakespeare's convictions about life
| but close to the heart of life itself&quot; (Goddard 280).

For me, the epiphany moment comes at the conclusion, when Prospero
puts down his staff and cloak, releases the spirit, and departs,
ending the play and suggesting Shakespeare's retirement at the same
time. That's the most satisfactory conclusion in all the plays, IMO.

I guess my prediction is nothing new. There have been lots of stories
and poems that parallel parts of Tempest, such as Browning did on
Caliban's ruminations on Prospero. That one seems to go back to
archetypal stuff about the potter-pot relationship. I wouldn't be
surprised if Tempest, on some level, is about using a New Eden
situation to speculate about evil in it, and Caliban represents an
aspect of human nature, or something. bb

&quot;Yogi Buchon&quot;&lt;yogibuc ... @yahoo.com&gt; wrote

&lt;&lt;. Strachey's account of a shipwreck on Bermuda in
1609 wasn't published until after Shakespeare's death in 1616. So,
Shakespeare &quot;must have&quot; read it manuscript? Where's the evidence,
other than wishful thinking and vague parallels which Strachey may
have mimicked from St. Paul's account of his shipwreck in the Bible?
The location of the play is not the New World or Bermuda, it's the
Mediterranean. If you choose to believe otherwise go right ahead, but
you are wrong. Here's what the highly respected Northrop Frye wrote
in his introduction to the *The Tempest* in the Pelican Shakespeare:

&quot;The scene of the play, an island somewhere between Tunis and Naples,
suggests the journey of Aeneas from Carthage to Rome. Gonzalo's
identification of Tunis and Carthage, and the otherwise tedious
business about 'Widow Dido' in the second act, seems almost to be
emphasizing the parallel. Like *The Tempest*, the *Aeneid* begins
with a terrible storm and goes on to tell a story of wanderings
in which a banquet with harpies figures prominently&quot;

&quot;Echoes from the shipwreck of St. Paul (Ariel's phrase
'Not a hair perished&quot; recalls Acts xxvii, 34)...
are appropriate enough in such a play.&quot;

&quot;It is a little puzzling why New World imagery should be so prominent
in *The Tempest*, which really has nothing to do with the New World,
beyond Ariel's reference to the 'still-vexed Bermoothes' and a
general, if vague, resemblance between the relation of Caliban to the
other characters and that of the American Indians to the colonizers
and drunken sailors who came to exterminate and enslave them.&quot;&gt;&gt;

&quot;Yogi Buchon&quot;&lt;yogibuc ... @yahoo.com&gt; wrote

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Quite right, Bob, I think you missed these words
&gt; from the linked website above:
&gt; ----------
&gt;&quot;Kenneth Muir's The Sources of Shakespeare's Plays (1978) thinks the
&gt; Bermuda pamphlets are probable sources for The Tempest, adding:
&gt; The extent of the verbal echoes of [the Bermuda] pamphlets has,
&gt; I think, been exaggerated. There is hardly a shipwreck in history
&gt; or fiction which does not mention splitting, in which the ship
&gt; is not lightened of its cargo, in which the passengers do not give
&gt; themselves up for lost, in which north winds are not sharp, and
&gt; in which no one gets to shore by clinging to wreckage. (280)
&gt; Not exactly ringing endorsements.
&gt; Muir continues by remarking that Strachey's account is influenced by
&gt; St. Paul's shipwreck and by Erasmus' colloquy. St. Paul's account of
&gt; his wreck at Malta, Acts of the Apostles 27-28:12, takes up less than
&gt; two pages in either the Geneva or King James Bible, in contrast to the
&gt; 114 pages of the two Bermuda pamphlets. In those two pages we find
&gt; the following parallels to The Tempest:
&gt; 1. A voyage to Italy within the Mediterranean.
&gt; 2. Discord among the participants; the crew against the passengers.
&gt; 3. The ship driven by a 'tempest'.
&gt; 4. Loss of hope.
&gt; 5. An angel visits the ship; compare to Ariel.
&gt; 6. Desperate maneuvers to avoid the lee shore of an unknown island.
&gt; 7. Detailed description of nautical techniques.
&gt; 8. The ship runs aground and splits.
&gt; 9. Passengers and crew swim ashore on loose or broken timbers;
&gt; compare to Stephano coming ashore on a butt of sack.
&gt; 10. The island has barbarous inhabitants; compare to Caliban.
&gt; 11. Supernatural involvement.
&gt; 12. A seeming miracle; St. Paul immune to snakebite.
&gt; 13. A safe trip to Italy after a stay on the island.
&gt; ----------
&gt; And, here's yet another parallel, parallel #14, between *The Tempest*
&gt; and St. Paul's account of Malta in Acts of the New Testament:
&gt; 14. &quot;He ordered those who could swim to throw themselves overboard
&gt; first and make for land, and the rest on planks or on pieces of the
&gt; ship. And so it was that all escaped to land. After we had escaped, we
&gt; then learned that the island was called Malta. And the natives showed
&gt; us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all,
&gt; because it had begun to rain and was cold. Paul had gathered
&gt; a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire...&quot; Acts 27.43-28.3
&gt;&quot;Enter Caliban with a burden of wood.&quot; TMP 2.2.1
&gt;&quot;Work not so hard! I would the lightning had
&gt; Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile&quot; TMP 3.1.16-17
&gt;&gt; ... Moore skips the strange coincidence of the Strachey account's
&gt;&gt; coming just before we first here about an obviously late play of
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's and ignores all the points brought up
&gt;&gt; by David Kathman (albeit later) and his and Terry Ross's site.
&gt; Again, Strachey's account of the Bermuda shipwreck wasn't published
&gt; until years after 1611. Wishful thinking about Shakespeare reading a
&gt; manuscript won't do. Wishful thinking about placing the setting of
&gt; *The Tempest* in the Atlantic won't do.

|
| &gt; | THE TEMPEST
| &gt; |
| &gt; | Most consider this Shakespeare's last full completed play in his
| &gt; | lifetime and a sort of farewell to the theater. Due to an
arbitrary
| &gt; | performance record of November 1, 1611 and a Stratfordian strain
to
| &gt; | make travel accounts work as specific sources within the
framework
| &gt; | of Shakspere's life, this play's composition has been dated at
1611.
| &gt; |
| &gt; | They wave forth William Strachey's account of a shipwreck in
1609
| &gt; | off the coast of Bermuda and connect it to Ariel's reference to
the
| &gt; | &quot;still-vex'd Bermoothes&quot; (I.ii.229). But Strachey's letter from
July 15,
| &gt; | 1610, was not published until 1625 (Sobran 153); the wreck in
The
| &gt; | Tempest doesn't resemble the one in Strachey's account -- in
fact,
| &gt; | there isn't a wreck at all; and ample accounts of shipwrecks off
| &gt; | Bermuda existed in the decades earlier (cf. Whalen 120).
| &gt; | Besides, the island in this play is in the Mediterranean.

| &gt;&quot;Shipwreck&quot; must have been an exciting topic for Elizabethans,
what
| &gt; with the shipwrecks from the Spanish Armada, pirating of
shipwrecks
| &gt; off the coasts, loss of ships at sea from storms, and their uses
in
| &gt; biblical (Jonah, Jesus) and literary treatments.
| --------------------------------------------------------------
| Mostly St. Paul:
| --------------------------------------------------------------

Jonah's three days in the belly of the whale is supposed to presage
Jesus three days in resurrection. In a way, Prospero doesn't take
revenge but redeems himself.

I heard that Posidon harrassed Odysseus after Agamemnon unnaturally
sacrificed his daughter in propitiation before crossing the &quot;wine
dark&quot; sea to go after the Trojans.

| &lt;&lt;. Strachey's account of a shipwreck on Bermuda in
| 1609 wasn't published until after Shakespeare's death in 1616. So,
| Shakespeare &quot;must have&quot; read it manuscript? Where's the evidence,
| other than wishful thinking and vague parallels which Strachey may
| have mimicked from St. Paul's account of his shipwreck in the Bible?
| The location of the play is not the New World or Bermuda, it's the
| Mediterranean. If you choose to believe otherwise go right ahead,
but
| you are wrong. Here's what the highly respected Northrop Frye wrote
| in his introduction to the *The Tempest* in the Pelican
Shakespeare:
|
| &quot;The scene of the play, an island somewhere between Tunis and
Naples,
| suggests the journey of Aeneas from Carthage to Rome. Gonzalo's
| identification of Tunis and Carthage, and the otherwise tedious
| business about 'Widow Dido' in the second act, seems almost to be
| emphasizing the parallel. Like *The Tempest*, the *Aeneid* begins
| with a terrible storm and goes on to tell a story of wanderings
| in which a banquet with harpies figures prominently&quot;
|
| &quot;Echoes from the shipwreck of St. Paul (Ariel's phrase
| 'Not a hair perished&quot; recalls Acts xxvii, 34)...
| are appropriate enough in such a play.&quot;
|
| &quot;It is a little puzzling why New World imagery should be so
prominent
| in *The Tempest*, which really has nothing to do with the New World,
| beyond Ariel's reference to the 'still-vexed Bermoothes' and a
| general, if vague, resemblance between the relation of Caliban to
the
| other characters and that of the American Indians to the colonizers
| and drunken sailors who came to exterminate and enslave them.&quot;&gt;&gt;

| &gt;&gt; I must be missing something because all Moore's trivial attempt

|
| &gt;&gt; It brings in St. Paul, too, but pretty irrelevantly, since
about
| &gt;&gt; all that the Paul adventure has in common with the Tempest
| &gt;&gt; adventure is the wreck of a ship. ...
|
| &quot;Yogi Buchon&quot;&lt;yogibuc ... @yahoo.com&gt; wrote
|
| &gt; Quite right, Bob, I think you missed these words
| &gt; from the linked website above:
| &gt; ----------
| &gt;&quot;Kenneth Muir's The Sources of Shakespeare's Plays (1978) thinks
the
| &gt; Bermuda pamphlets are probable sources for The Tempest, adding:
|
| &gt; The extent of the verbal echoes of [the Bermuda] pamphlets has,
| &gt; I think, been exaggerated. There is hardly a shipwreck in history
| &gt; or fiction which does not mention splitting, in which the ship
| &gt; is not lightened of its cargo, in which the passengers do not give
| &gt; themselves up for lost, in which north winds are not sharp, and
| &gt; in which no one gets to shore by clinging to wreckage. (280)
|
| &gt; Not exactly ringing endorsements.
|
| &gt; Muir continues by remarking that Strachey's account is influenced
by
| &gt; St. Paul's shipwreck and by Erasmus' colloquy. St. Paul's account
of
| &gt; his wreck at Malta, Acts of the Apostles 27-28:12, takes up less
than
| &gt; two pages in either the Geneva or King James Bible, in contrast to
the
| &gt; 114 pages of the two Bermuda pamphlets. In those two pages we find
| &gt; the following parallels to The Tempest:
|
| &gt; 1. A voyage to Italy within the Mediterranean.
| &gt; 2. Discord among the participants; the crew against the
passengers.
| &gt; 3. The ship driven by a 'tempest'.
| &gt; 4. Loss of hope.
| &gt; 5. An angel visits the ship; compare to Ariel.
| &gt; 6. Desperate maneuvers to avoid the lee shore of an unknown
island.
| &gt; 7. Detailed description of nautical techniques.
| &gt; 8. The ship runs aground and splits.
| &gt; 9. Passengers and crew swim ashore on loose or broken timbers;
| &gt; compare to Stephano coming ashore on a butt of sack.
| &gt; 10. The island has barbarous inhabitants; compare to Caliban.
| &gt; 11. Supernatural involvement.
| &gt; 12. A seeming miracle; St. Paul immune to snakebite.
| &gt; 13. A safe trip to Italy after a stay on the island.
| &gt; ----------
| &gt; And, here's yet another parallel, parallel #14, between *The
Tempest*
| &gt; and St. Paul's account of Malta in Acts of the New Testament:
| &gt; 14. &quot;He ordered those who could swim to throw themselves
overboard
| &gt; first and make for land, and the rest on planks or on pieces of
the
| &gt; ship. And so it was that all escaped to land. After we had
escaped, we
| &gt; then learned that the island was called Malta. And the natives
showed
| &gt; us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all,
| &gt; because it had begun to rain and was cold. Paul had gathered
| &gt; a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire...&quot; Acts 27.43-28.3
| &gt;&quot;Enter Caliban with a burden of wood.&quot; TMP 2.2.1
|
| &gt;&quot;Work not so hard! I would the lightning had
| &gt; Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile&quot; TMP
3.1.16-17
|
| &gt;&gt; ... Moore skips the strange coincidence of the Strachey
account's
| &gt;&gt; coming just before we first here about an obviously late play of
| &gt;&gt; Shakespeare's and ignores all the points brought up
| &gt;&gt; by David Kathman (albeit later) and his and Terry Ross's site.
|
| &gt; Again, Strachey's account of the Bermuda shipwreck wasn't
published
| &gt; until years after 1611. Wishful thinking about Shakespeare reading
a
| &gt; manuscript won't do. Wishful thinking about placing the setting of
| &gt; *The Tempest* in the Atlantic won't do.

| &gt; I don't know if there

| &gt; survival of a colony, and also the theme of utopia in a New World,
| &gt; possibly a New Eden.
|
| &gt; Shakespeare was no landlubber, with many instances of plots using
| &gt; shipwreck as a device to introduce identity confusion or lost
fortune.
| &gt; In Bentley, Twelfth Night gets a first performance date of
1599-1600.
| &gt; Comedy of Errors gets a 1592-93, and Merchant of Venice, 1596-97.I
| &gt; notice that in &quot;Shakespeare in Love,&quot; the conclusion describes
Twelfth

Bermoothes are cited in old dictionaries as 'the Bermudas', sourcing the
term to Shak. But what were the Bermudas?

~ &quot;A cant term for certain obscure and intricate alleys, in which persons
lodged who had occasion to live cheap or concealed. They are supposed to
have been the narrow passages north of the Strand, near Covent garden.
Bermudas also denoted a species of tobacco.&quot; /Nares

The formation BERM~ is unusal, and from A. Sax., as found in BERME; yeast

Havelok and Layamon.

BU; is an ox. But an association with 'tempest' forces could be found in
BUR; a blow, force or violence.

Both BER~ and BUR[n] formations refer to a man or knight. More promising is
BURN; which has a meaning, to waste [time] &quot;wee burne time,&quot; /Mother Bombie,

&gt;&gt; I would like to announce that in Portland at the Shakespeare Authorship
&gt;&gt; Conference on April 7, Roger Stritmatter and I will be presenting the
paper
&gt;&gt;&quot;Shakespeare and the Explorers: Why The Tempest Does Not Depend on
&gt;&gt; Strachey's True Repertory.&quot;

&gt;&gt; We've recently made some very significant and exciting discoveries,
which,
&gt;&gt; we believe, will demolish the traditional belief that The Tempest must
have
&gt;&gt; been written in 1611.

&gt;&gt; Will be ready to discuss this after we've presented. Have had my head
buried
&gt;&gt; in books for weeks.

&gt; Can you post a copy online for the benefit of those of us who are
&gt; unable to attend your presentation, Lynne? I think that you should have
&gt; scheduled your presentation for April 1, to celebrate Art's birthday. :-)

We're doing a powerpoint. It will take us about six months afterwards to get
it ready for publication, which I must admit isn't my strong point. I love
doing the research. I love writing novels. But academic papers. Ugh.

I think it will be fine for me to discuss it online after we present it, and
will do so if I don't get attacked gratuitously. I'll just check if I may,
but by then everyone will know the material is ours, so I think it will be
fine.

Regards,
Lynne

&lt;&lt;Long ago, when I was still in the process of rising to the
top echelons of the conspiracy's hierarchy (and even hereditary
Rex Deus Templars must earn their spurs like eVERyone else, Art),
I was assigned to infiltrate Phaeton pseudonymously and to report
my findings to the Grand Master, so I speak from experience.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Of course, the Order of the Temple does not normally confide
the *whole* truth to modern Templars, but only to hereditary Templars

&lt;&lt;In this hereditary chain, Prince Henry Sinclair became the Grand
Master of the Crafts and Guilds of Scotland, as well as being a Knight
Templar, pledged to protect the Christian ideals. He was known as
Henry &quot;the Holy&quot; St. Clair. He was a true leader and was chosen as the
Commander of a Templar inspired expedition to the New World in 1398.
The Templars had found a temporary refuge in Scotland, but Scotland had
neither the space nor the scope to accommodate them. They wanted a new
land where their ideals could take root and flourish. They knew about
the New World. Trade was already taking place. The New World beckoned.

His Venetian admiral, Antonio Zeno, said Prince Henry was a man
&quot;worthy of immortal memory because of his great bravery and goodness.&quot;
He reached America 94 years before Columbus. He treated the indigenous
people with respect, understanding, and consideration. He called them
his &quot;beloved sons&quot;, as he recognized they had the same underlying
beliefs he had himself, namely that God and Nature was One. There is no
doubt, Henry St. Clair practiced his faith in everything he did. Before
he ended his stay in the New World, it is thought that he applied his
experience and religious beliefs in building the NEWPORT Tower,
following the design lines of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
in Jerusalem.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Hi Bob.

thanks for the compliment, but as you know, who we debate is out of
our hands. I got an e-mail from the Trust &amp; was assigned Foelster just
as soon as his name appeared on the ng. Boy, I'm glad I was taken off
Crowley: the man is too well-read &amp; intelligent, it was all I could do
to keep up with him.

I'm damn glad they've never given me Art to debate; I feel sorry for
poor David. Of course that new anagram program they have is sure coming
in handy for him, but I *NEVER* want to go toe-to-toe with Art--he
knows too much, although I doubt if he's even aware of all he knows.

Hey, I finally got the check. Something about a computer virus in the
mainframe at Stratford. I was glad to see it--the rent was overdue
&amp; I had to pay a late fee.

Sorry about that last e-mail appearing on the ng.
Apparently I hit &quot;post&quot; instead of &quot;e-mail.&quot; It won't happen again.

My 14-year-old is giving me trouble--the usual ersatz teenage angst. He
doesn't want to accept his occupation being already chosen for him. I
told him it was like the Phantom--the ghost who walks--&amp; that it was an
honor to be born into a family with a 400-year old mission, but he just
sulks off &amp; gets on the computer. I'm sure he'll come around--we all
do, eventually.

Meanwhile all he does is play on the computer (he's a real whiz at
programming) &amp; mutters about how he's going to &quot;fix me&quot;&amp; about
some grandoise plan he has to &quot;expose the truth to the world.&quot;

Yeah, right, that'll be the day, hey Bob?

Who do you think is going to get the old monument in April? Schoenbaum
had it for so long I think they almost completely forgot about it. I
vote for Matus--he deserves it. I've heard some say that Dave or Terry
should get it, but they're a little young yet, I think. I know damn
well it'll be years before I'm eligible, not to mention that whoever
gets it keeps it for life.

Say, before they ship it to whomever they give it to we should all
gather around it &amp; have our picture taken &amp; send it to Kennedy! I'd
want to pose atop the woolsack. Wouldn't that be a hoot! I bet the old
fart would think he was having the DTs! If a picture could be printed
with some type of disappearing ink that couldn't be copied it would be
worth it. Maybe he'd have a heart attack or something &amp; we'd be rid of
that thorn in the side &amp; make our jobs a lot easier.

Well, that's about it for now. Brenda says to tell the family &quot;hi&quot;
&amp; that we'll see you all in Stratford in April.&gt;&gt;

Thanks for posting this, David. I wouldn't have seen it otherwise.

By the way, Art is obviously hallucinating. I defy anyone to find the post I

There are a lot of mysteries:

1) Why does a college math professor spend so much of his time debunking
people that he claims are either crackpots or trolls?

2) Why did Tom Reedy finally break his silence (after six and a half years
mind you!!) in order to deny authorship of a post that he deleted almost
immediately after it was posted. The rest of the Goon Squad seemed quite
content with the idea of the post being real but Tom Reedy's idea of a joke
(...quite possibly it was); why didn't Tom play along with that ploy (or
