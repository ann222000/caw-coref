Looking for cheats or trainer.

Also, someone working on a Walkthrough?

There's talk on the game's boards about all three, but nothing too
specific yet. A walkthrough for that game would be a daunting task, as
the player's approach to that game almost completely revolves around the
type of character they have. I'm sure it could be done, though. I just
finished it the other night, so if you're stuck on something let me know
and I'll try to help you out.

Ooze

/AOL that. I just finished for the second time, so now I am pretty much
finished for good (not much variety, apart from random drops, and this
time through I got all the spells and killed everything alive). Off to
play Witcher, if I can ever download the 123MB 'patch'. Jeez, doesn't
anyone understand 'do it right the first time' (or at least close enough
to keep the patch sizes sane).

No.  Mostly because the suits don't understand &quot;wait until its actually
finished before you release it&quot; let alone &quot;maybe we should test it first&quot;.

Ooze,

Thanks for the offer on help, but I don't play games that do not have
cheats.  I have not downloaded Eschalon yet.

Wish I could remember the actual quote, Murphy's Law type thing, but it
goes something like &quot;Any job no matter how trivial will rise in
complexity so as to use all the time and money budgetted for it.&quot;

In my experience this holds true for a number of people and isn't
restricted to any given group of people or jobs. You can't even
stereotype the reasons it happens. Some people just can't finish
anything, others worry about job security or having to transfer to a
subordinate role in another group.

There's several managment techniques you can use to help things along
like PERT charts and bonuses or incentives. Even those can be subverted.
For example some of the projects we recieved funding for, the contract
was a dollar ammount per project over a year budget. You can bet we were
pressured by management to allow two weeks for even the most trivial
task such that we would need at least one additional year of funding.

You've got Johnny Programmer making his $80k/year paying the mortgage on
his two bedroom condo. He doesn't want to be laid off when the CD goes
gold and everyone gets rich but him/her so he sandbags. You've got a
manager who is tired of hearing excuses and getting pressure from the
banks and venture capitalist to get a product out. Hard to win in that
situation.

I'd just offer a bonus, but payable after five years.  For each bug that
is found in the shipped product, the bonus gets smaller.

(If the bonus reaches zero, then the fixer is sent to the programmer's
homes.  But we won't talk about that.)

Parkinson's Law?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law :
Parkinson's Law as commonly referenced states that &quot;work expands so as
to fill the time available for its completion.&quot; A more succinct phrasing
also commonly used is &quot;work expands to fill the time available.&quot;

Thanks for the excellent ref! Applied much more widely then I thought
and just as relevant if not more so today as when it was first concieved.
