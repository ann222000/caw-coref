Benchmarks, Timelines and Lies
Like a Soldier
By STEPHEN FLEISCHMAN

When you're wounded and left on Afghanistan's plains,
And the women come out to cut up what remains,
Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains

An' go to your Gawd like a soldier.

Kipling

Rudyard Kipling knew what he was talking about when he wrote that verse. As a
chronicler of the British Empire in its declining years, he foreshadowed the
coming of America's Empire in his advice to the British soldier. But we know
that a better way to support our troops is to bring them home now. Who would
want to be the last soldier to die in the Iraq war?

It seems that the Bush Administration is beginning to admit what we have known
for some time-that the war in Iraq is already lost. So should we continue to
"blow out our brains" as the British did on Afghanistan's plains, or should we
cut and run as we did in Vietnam, although a bit too late.

The Bush war party is being gored by the horns of a dilemma. Some members of the
establishment are calling for a reduction of forces, maybe 30 thousand or so, to
ward off stinging defeat in the upcoming Congressional elections. Other factions
in the Administration, mainly the neo-cons, are calling for the addition of more
troops to do what some say should have been done in the first place-send in
overwhelming force and do what Colin Powell so graphically described in the
first Gulf War, "surround the enemy, cut it off and kill it." Unfortunately for
him (and for us) he didn't take his own advice and went along with the Rumsfeld
concept of doing this war "on the cheap".

Not quite so cheap, as it turned out. The theft of 18 billion dollars, here and
there, doesn't seem like much compared with the 1 trillion or 2 trillion the war
has cost our hardy taxpayers thus far, depending on who's calculating the
damage. How many school lunches or health insurance policies would that buy?

When will we get out of Iraq? Not until we're kicked out, it seems. This is
getting more and more like déjà vu all over again. Bush has given up his mantra
"stay the course" but he has not quit his other bright saying, "When the Iraqis
stand up, we'll stand down". The estimates change almost daily. "Now the Iraqis
are standing upnow they're standing down now they're being decimated by the
insurgents well, some of them are standing up, noI mean standing down

Meanwhile, judging from the nightly news clips, our troops seem to be running
around in circles in the most dangerous place in the world-busting into people's
houses, intimidating children, terrorizing women, and harassing their men,
killing some of them, looking for terrorists and insurgents. A great way to win
the hearts and minds of the people; a cliché they still talk about. But the
resistance goes on, the way it did in Algiers when Algeria finally dumped the
French.

"Take up the White Man's burden--Send forth the best ye breed " said Kipling.
That's what Bush thought he was doing when he sent young men like Cindy
Sheehan's son, Casey, into battle in Iraq in order to bring freedom and free
enterprise (not for the Iraqis but for Halliburton, Bechtel and Boeing) into
this Saddam-ized country.

Now that Bush's military adventurism is falling apart, the news of it is busting
out all over. Even the popular German news magazine, Der Spiegel, heralded the
US loss of the Iraq War, this week, under a banner headline "Power and Lies".

Now, even Republicans are beginning to speak up. Pennsylvania Congressman Curt
Weldon, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, once a hawk, is now
asking for a timetable to bring the troops home. Other dissident Republicans are
following suit. Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut favors a timeline for
troop withdrawals, New Jersey's Tom Kean, Jr., running for the Senate called for
Rumsfeld's resignation and said Bush had made "horrendous mistakes", Pat Tiberi
of Ohio called for new leadership at the Pentagon, Sen. Lindsey Graham called
Iraq "a mess", and so it goes. They all want to put some distance between George
Bush and their candidacy. A looming election has magical powers.

To distract his right-wing constituency from the truth, Bush has given the
so-called Iraqi government a "timeline for benchmarks"-a series of tasks for
establishing security that they must complete in a period of time before the
occupying troops can leave. Another gimmick. If they haven't been able to
accomplish these tasks before having a timeline, they're not going to be any
better off with one.

What are we going to think of next? Major General J.D. Thurman, senior commander
of US forces in Baghdad came up with a good answer-do what's right for the
country. Right now, the Iraqis are so splintered, it would be harder to get them
back together again than it would be to get Humpty Dumpty back on the wall. So
why not let them fight it out and if they decide to split into three regions,
Sunni, Shia and Kurds, so be it.

Meanwhile, the resistance grows. Everyone waits expectantly for that tipping
point when Grand Ayatollah al Sistani tips his turban and the Shia join the
Sunni insurgency against the occupiers-the end of the beginning.

If it can be said that Osama bin Laden was the "Gunga Din" of 9/11 (carrying
water for al Qaeda), there will come a time when George W. Bush will have to say
to Osama, "You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din".
