&gt; Gore: Polluters finance research to cast doubt on global warming

&gt; By GILLIAN WONG Associated Press Writer
&gt; Article Launched: 08/07/2007 02:09:21 AM PDT

&gt; SINGAPORE—Research aimed at disputing the scientific consensus on global
&gt; warming is part of a huge public misinformation campaign funded by some
&gt; of the world's largest carbon polluters, former Vice President Al Gore
&gt; said Tuesday.

&gt; &quot;There has been an organized campaign, financed to the tune of about $10
&gt; million a year from some of the largest carbon polluters, to create the
&gt; impression that there is disagreement in the scientific community,&quot; Gore
&gt; said at a forum in Singapore. &quot;In actuality, there is very little
&gt; disagreement.&quot;

&gt; Gore likened the campaign to the millions of dollars spent by U.S.
&gt; tobacco companies years ago on creating the appearance of scientific
&gt; debate on smoking's harmful effects.

&gt; &quot;This is one of the strongest of scientific consensus views in the
&gt; history of science,&quot; Gore said. &quot;We live in a world where what used to
&gt; be called propaganda now has a major role to play in shaping public
&gt; opinion.&quot;

&gt; After the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of the
&gt; world's top climate scientists, released a report in February that
&gt; warned that the cause of global warming is &quot;very likely&quot; man-made, &quot;the
&gt; deniers offered a bounty of $10,000 for each article disputing the
&gt; consensus that people could crank out and get published somewhere,&quot; Gore
&gt; said.

&gt; &quot;They're trying to manipulate opinion and they are taking us for fools,&quot;
&gt; he said.
&gt; He said Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil
&gt; company, is one of the major fuel companies involved in attempting to
&gt; mislead the public about global warming.

&gt; Last year, British and American science advocacy groups accused
&gt; ExxonMobil of funding groups that undermine the scientific consensus on
&gt; climate change. The company said the scientists' reports were just
&gt; attempts to smear Exxon Mobil's name and confuse the debate.

&gt; Gore said that with growing awareness of climate change, the world will
&gt; see an acceleration in efforts to fight the problem, and urged
&gt; businesses to recognize that reducing carbon emissions is in their
&gt; long-term interest.

&gt; But while Washington should lead by example, he said developing nations
&gt; also have to play a part.

&gt; &quot;Countries like China, just to give an example, which will next year be
&gt; the largest emitter in the world, can't be excluded just because it's
&gt; technically a developing country,&quot; Gore said. &quot;When you look at the
&gt; absolute amount of CO2 each year and going forward, China will soon
&gt; surpass the U.S.&quot;

&gt; Gore said that as the Asian giant's economy expands, China faces an
&gt; increased risk from climate change and must leapfrog old, polluting
&gt; technologies while maintaining growth.

&gt; The Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency said in June that China
&gt; overtook the United States in carbon dioxide emissions by about 7.5
&gt; percent in 2006. China was 2 percent below the U.S. in greenhouse gas
&gt; emissions in 2005, the agency said.

That was a very interesting article in Newsweek this week.
Clearly written by a &quot;non-denier&quot;.

The following article that appeared in Newsweek is much more interesting
IMO.

But, hey!  Science is so much better now.

Well then how do we know that has the science improved?...if at all?...
to the point that only 30 years later you can now say that the science
is correct...That would be a COMPLETE 180 degree turn.  Surely you can
understand the &quot;deniers&quot; when science offers as an explanation the
complete opposite as to what it has offered earlier.....

Can you imagine what it would have been like if rather that Einstein
thinking outside the box (as opposed to other physicists at the time)
and developing his theory of relativity, instead they had a
conference....behind closed doors....and over a long weekend they HAD to
decide the issue of say...relativity.

Einstein....and other groundbreaking scientists develop theories,
publish them and then the science is checked, rechecked.  further
experiments are devised to test the theory, etc....

Instead with planetary climate...the IPCC (UN right?-forget about the
lack of trust in the UN) locks everyone in a room and says &quot;decide this
weekend..the report needs to get out&quot;.
And while you are deciding forget that our science has been wrong for
the last 100 years....If they can even admit that....

It seems reasonable to question those who are offered payment to rebuke
the current warming alarmists, but doesnt the same hold true for the UN?
It is obvious...oil for food, etc... that they should be held to the
same standard as you would hold the paid naysayers.  At least those
paying the scientists actually produce and supply something needed.

News flash, Bob: science evolves.  Especially in fields like climate
science where -- over the past third of a century -- there has been
massive amounts of research conducted in the field.

Hey, if science/technology evolves, how come cell phones haven't
gotten any smaller over the years? How come diseases that used to kill
people haven't become more treatable? And when are they going to

Oh, wait. Never mind.

OK, I'll try and slow down here...
Of course science improves....over time....
However, for science to do a complete 180 degree turn..at least in my
understanding...does not constitute &quot;good&quot; science, it constitutes &quot;bad&quot;
science.  The question is which is bad...the one where they said global
cooling is happening or the one where they said global warming is happening?
I suspect the one that they said &quot;global warming&quot; is happening.

So, the global cooling enthusiasts were COMPLETELY WRONG!!

Please tell me you understand where I am coming from...?? !!! lol

The problem seems to be that you've only repeated it three times so

I do find comfort in the fact that Ray admits climate scientists can and

Ten years from now...who knows what honesty Ray will be capable of?

In other words, even though there is signficant evidence to support
the science, you're willing to accept the risk of catastrophe in the
hope that, perhaps, they're wrong.

More repeating?  Apparently so.

Here's the official position of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences
in 1975 with respect to climate change, quoted from that same Newsweek
article that you find so compelling, Bob:

&quot;Our knowledge of the mechanisms of climate change is at least as
fragmentary as our data. Not only are the basic scientific questions
largely unanswered; but in many cases we do not yet know enough to
pose the key questions.&quot;

The National Academy of Sciences was correct back then.

And here's the official position of the National Academy of Sciences
in 2005 -- 30 years of climate science research later, here in the
modern era:

&quot;[T]here is now strong evidence that significant global warming is
occurring... It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades
can be attributed to human activities. This warming has already led to
changes in the Earth's climate... Increasing greenhouse gases are
causing temperatures to rise... The scientific understanding of
climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking
prompt action.&quot;

http://nationalacademies.org/onpi/06072005.pdf

The National Academy of Sciences was correct a third of a century ago
with respect to their assessment of the science of climate change, and
they are correct again now.

Reading for comprehension: live it, love it, be it.

&gt;&gt;I'll start my subscription up to Newsweek at that time.

&gt;&gt;I do find comfort in the fact that Ray admits climate scientists can and

&gt;In other words, even though there is signficant evidence to support

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; More repeating?  Apparently so.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here's the official position of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in 1975 with respect to climate change, quoted from that same Newsweek
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; article that you find so compelling, Bob:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Our knowledge of the mechanisms of climate change is at least as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fragmentary as our data. Not only are the basic scientific questions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; largely unanswered; but in many cases we do not yet know enough to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pose the key questions.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The National Academy of Sciences was correct back then.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And here's the official position of the National Academy of Sciences
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in 2005 -- 30 years of climate science research later, here in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; modern era:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;[T]here is now strong evidence that significant global warming is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; occurring... It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can be attributed to human activities. This warming has already led to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; changes in the Earth's climate... Increasing greenhouse gases are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; causing temperatures to rise... The scientific understanding of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prompt action.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://nationalacademies.org/onpi/06072005.pdf
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The National Academy of Sciences was correct a third of a century ago
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with respect to their assessment of the science of climate change, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they are correct again now.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Reading for comprehension: live it, love it, be it.

you know Ray...You still havent explained the Maunder minimum.

Thanks for clearing up the fact that when climate scientists and the
media were declaring a state of global cooling in 1975, what they were
actually doing was saying we need more science, better science, more
money, more govt grants. How did the words &quot;global cooling&quot; ever enter
into the discussion?  Forget it you never answer....

Maybe...just maybe....all the evil polluters heard this global cooling
&quot;idea&quot; and on their own started tossing as much co2 in the
air...yeah...they knew this would cause a &quot;warming&quot;...and maybe they
went to far....thats all.

It had to happen that way, because there has never been a period of
warming before.  Warming has got to be caused by the greenhouse effect.

Oh cr#p!  I forgot about the maunder minimum.....
Maybe the idea of cattle emmissions will work.
We may be able to get 92 or 93% to agree to that.

But when we speak of the 90%, who are we actually speaking of?
scientists organized via the UN...?
Can't be....

How many climate &quot;scientists&quot; are there?
In the World?
What percentage of those agree?

When you say in 1975 &quot;they were not sure?&quot;, what percentage of
&quot;scientists&quot; were unsure?

I understand that the &quot;naysayers&quot; attack your &quot;lifes work&quot;, and you
should defend what you believe in.

However, on the other hand, I do not understand you inability to explain
an event so closely related to the climate, the Sun and planet Earth.

You know Bob, you still haven't researched what we know today about
how solar variability affects global temperature - doing that would
clear up your misguided Maunder Minimum obsession.

For some reason however - call it a hunch - you won't bother to
actually research the issue, and will instead keep repeating &quot;Maunder
minimum&quot; as if it somehow undermines the scientific consensus on
global warming.

Global cooling was a hypothesis advanced by some climate scientists a

If you are a climate scientist, you are less than adequate.

I have a hypothesis also....it does not get national attention, and it

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So what part of:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;There was no scientific consensus with respect to climate change back
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the 70s, except that more research was required&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem seems to be that you've only repeated it three times so

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and still much more needs to be done....
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; More repeating?  Apparently so.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here's the official position of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in 1975 with respect to climate change, quoted from that same Newsweek
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; article that you find so compelling, Bob:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Our knowledge of the mechanisms of climate change is at least as
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fragmentary as our data. Not only are the basic scientific questions
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; largely unanswered; but in many cases we do not yet know enough to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pose the key questions.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The National Academy of Sciences was correct back then.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And here's the official position of the National Academy of Sciences
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in 2005 -- 30 years of climate science research later, here in the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; modern era:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;[T]here is now strong evidence that significant global warming is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; occurring... It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can be attributed to human activities. This warming has already led to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; changes in the Earth's climate... Increasing greenhouse gases are
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; causing temperatures to rise... The scientific understanding of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prompt action.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://nationalacademies.org/onpi/06072005.pdf
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The National Academy of Sciences was correct a third of a century ago
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with respect to their assessment of the science of climate change, and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they are correct again now.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Reading for comprehension: live it, love it, be it.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You cant be serious.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They were right...although they should have concluded a completely
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opposite result?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Huh? The 1975 Newsweek quote clearly says that they are not sure. The
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2005 quote lacks the uncertainty of the 1975 quote and makes a much
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stronger statement.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Bob/jackstraw is a troll who at this point is just throwing mud, in
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the hopes of obscuring the fact that his &quot;science did a complete 180
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; degree turn&quot; rhetoric is bullshit.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Either that or he's an idiot.  Or both.
&gt; &gt;&gt; you know Ray...You still havent explained the Maunder minimum.

&gt; &gt; You know Bob, you still haven't researched what we know today about
&gt; &gt; how solar variability affects global temperature - doing that would
&gt; &gt; clear up your misguided Maunder Minimum obsession.

&gt; &gt; For some reason however - call it a hunch - you won't bother to
&gt; &gt; actually research the issue, and will instead keep repeating &quot;Maunder
&gt; &gt; minimum&quot; as if it somehow undermines the scientific consensus on
&gt; &gt; global warming.

&lt;snip&gt;

Solar variability and the Maunder minimum ...hmmm
can you explain that?
Because if you can, I think you are due a Nobel Prize.

Funny how you want me to research and I want you to research...,which
proves my point..your science is weak.

Please point me to the scientific article that explains my &quot;misguided&quot;
maunder minimum...I apologize for not seeing it sooner.
I am assuming, from your post that you can point me to explanations of
solar variability.  Not mathematical models, but an understanding that
can ACTUALLY explain the Maunder Minimum.
I look forward to reading these.

As an aside...regarding the recent disclosure that global warming is
happening on multiple planets...please point me to that scientific
explanation.....sounds like a &quot;measuring instrument&quot; problem to me.

Also, if it is not too much trouble, if you could somehow explain the
United Nations involvement in this....specifically , would it be in the
UN's interest to have the USA become an equal power as opposed to a
&quot;Super power&quot;?

I really want to be part of the group...help me
Wait...Deadheads are not part of the group...
sh*t I am an idiot.

Thanks for your time, consideration and your thoughtful insight....

&gt;&gt; I do find comfort in the fact that Ray admits climate scientists can and

&gt; In other words, even though there is signficant evidence to support

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wonder why your science is questioned.......lol
&gt;&gt;&gt; By people like you?  I don't wonder about that at all.
&gt;&gt; thanks for biting....

&gt; Sure - it's a slow evening.

&gt;&gt; science does not concern itself with &quot;people like you&quot;

&gt; Yeah - now you've got it: science only concerns itself with people
&gt; like me.  Tough luck there.

well thought out in :30 seconds..........

still...... no answers from Ray...........
so sad...especially when the World's fate depends on it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So what part of:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;There was no scientific consensus with respect to climate change back
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the 70s, except that more research was required&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are you still not clear on?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem seems to be that you've only repeated it three times so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; far.
&gt;&gt;&gt; and still much more needs to be done....so we should stop waving the
&gt;&gt;&gt; World is going to end flag.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Either way we should know for sure in what did Al Gore say  ?  ten years
&gt;&gt;&gt;from now?
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll start my subscription up to Newsweek at that time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I do find comfort in the fact that Ray admits climate scientists can and
&gt;&gt;&gt; have been wrong.

&gt;&gt; In other words, even though there is signficant evidence to support
&gt;&gt; the science, you're willing to accept the risk of catastrophe in the
&gt;&gt; hope that, perhaps, they're wrong.
&gt;conservation...as in conservatism.... is always a good thing...lies are
&gt;never a good thing.

&gt;Funny how you want me to research and I want you to research...,which

Except for the fact that the vast majority of the world's climate
scientists agree with Ray, you might have a good point.
