A story about analysis of the text of E3 was mentioned on SHAKSPER; haven't
seen it mentioned here yet, so here's the link:

The conclusion drawn from the computer analysis used was that it's not by
Shakespeare, but shows signs of being by Marlowe, in part at least.
There was also a clear distinction between Marlowe's work and Shakespeare's,
and Two Noble Kinsmen was noticeable different to the rest of the recognised
canon, which all appeared to be by a single author.
I look forward to seeing the full paper when it's published.

I'm pleased to hear it. I recall arguing for this on HLAS back
in May '99, on the &quot;Edward III: If not Shakespeare, Who?&quot; thread.

Me too.

The relevant bit about Marlowe says: &quot;They also showed a
substantial difference between the works of the bard and
those of Christopher Marlowe, who some have argued was
the real Shakespeare.&quot;

No doubt it does. The problem with all such studies,
however, is that they (I guess understandably) go on to
arrive at a conclusion - i.e. that Marlowe's works and
Shakespeare's works must therefore have been written by
different people - when that conclusion is not justified.
It may of course be justified in other ways, but cannot
be determined by these data alone.

Let me illustrate this, as I have done before, but a long
time ago. It uses a method not unlike their's, but simpler.

Take any play you like by either Marlowe or Shakespeare,
and count up how many times each of the following 25 words
appears,

all, at, and, both, by, for, from, her, in, me, never,
nor, now, or, shall, she, such, then, these, thine, thus,
where, why, will, with.

Then arrive at a grand total. Call this total 'A'.

Now, for the same play, do likewise for the following 25.

a, an, as, hath, if, it, more, most, much, no, not,
of, our, out, so, some, than, that, there, they, this,
upon, what, which, you.

This is total 'B'.

Now:

* If A is greater than B, the play is by Marlowe.
* If B is greater than A, it is by Shakespeare.

(To be fair, there are 3 exceptions to the first rule,
2 Henry VI, 3 Henry VI and Titus Andronicus. Each of
these has been attributed to Marlowe in its time,
however).

It can be seen quite clearly, therefore, that there is
a highly significant difference (at least as far as this
is concerned) between the plays of Marlowe and the plays
of Shakespeare. It would therefore appear to show quite
conclusively they cannot have been written by the same
person.

This argument is totally fallacious, since it takes no
acount of *time*. When we plot the results obtained by
the above calculation on a timescale, we find that not
only do the figures fail to support that conclusion but
that they actually support the exact opposite - that the
two sets of plays were by the same author. See this at

My contention is that almost all of the differences
between the works of Marlowe and Shakespeare can be
explained in much the same way - the effect of time.

Surprise, Peter, I think I agree with everything you say in your post.
One request: please, if the main scholars in the field decide Marlowe
wrote Edward II, don't lord it over us for being so early of that view
the way Richard Kennedy has for being, apparently, the first to say
Ford wrote The Elegy. (I think all you'll need to prove Ed was by
Kit, by the way, are some initials on it other than CM.)

Nice to see some sensible discussion and debate - not that I'd expect
anything less from you, Peter.

I take your point about possible time-dependent variation, and your graph is
certainly an interesting one. The regression curve is good, but adding such
a curve when presenting data can 'fool' the eye into seeing more of a
relationship than is really present. It's unfortunate that there is so
little data at the Marlowe end to work from.

I think what will be important in the full paper will be to see the
relationship 'tree' that is mentioned in the article. This should show some
correlation to time, as you suggest, and the critical matter then is where
in the tree the CM plays fit. If the whole WS canon springs from one
'trunk' with a separate 'trunk' for CM's work, then your hypothesis takes a
knock. If the CM-authored plays are on a branch within the main 'tree',
with some relationship to the earlier WS plays, then you may be on to
something.

Yes, of course it can, and it 'proves' nothing on its own,
but provided that there *is* such a relationship, (and the
Shakespeare R2 in this case was well over 50%) then I
don't think it is being dishonest to help people 'see' it.

This is true, particularly as regards the actual dates when
most of them were written. Even if I just lumped the whole
lot into a single figure, however, and slotted it in around
1590, I think the point would still be made.

I am still waiting for that bit of evidence to turn up that
proves the Marlovian theory wrong, but it's been nearly
forty years now, and I'm beginning to give up hope! I would
very much like to see the article when it comes out,
although that may take some doing.

The Globe article says that the technique &quot;will be described
in an upcoming issue of the prestigious physics journal,
Physica A,&quot; It appears that it is written by Dr. Ary L.
Goldberger, together with Albert C.-C. Yang and C.-K. Peng.

So if anybody gets to hear of its actual publication, please

Help us out in finding that bit of evidence for you, Peter: tell us

Let's you and him fight? Do me a favour!

The point is that if you have actually looked at the article
James and Tom pointed out, you will have seen that this
*could* apparently 'demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt'
that Marlowe could not have written the plays we attribute
to Shakespeare.

James said that it was &quot;Nice to see some sensible discussion
and debate&quot; on the subject, and I agree. What you found to
say was:

&quot;Surprise, Peter, I think I agree with everything you say
in your post.&quot;

at which point it would have been good if you had stopped,
but no, such an admission apparently stuck in your gullet,
so we had to have:

&quot;One request: please, if the main scholars in the field
decide Marlowe wrote Edward II (sic), don't lord it over
us for being so early of that view the way Richard
Kennedy has for being, apparently, the first to say
Ford wrote The Elegy.

By this I must assume that you did not look at what I had
said in my earlier post?

Richard K. was the first to suggest that it might have been
Ford, whereas I made it clear that most of the argument
I was presenting came from A.D. Wraight, who was certainly
not the first to suggest it either.

You then went on:

&quot;(I think all you'll need to prove Ed was by it, by the
way, are some initials on it other than CM.)&quot;

which, even if I could understand what you were on about,
doesn't look a whole lot like &quot;sensible discussion and
debate&quot; to me.

It's a bit unfair to want Peter to use a phrase describing a concept as
alien to him as reasonable doubt. Marlovianism and all other forms of
anti-Shakespeareanism are the antimatter to the matter of reasonable
doubt -- they cannot coexist in the same space. People who are capable
of reasonable doubt do not wait for evidence to appear: they actively
seek it.

I like the idea of having Peter falsify Oxfordianism, but I propose to
up the ante. In my opinion the Mayan leader Pacal is a more likely
candidate for the authorship of Shakespeare's plays than Marlowe,
Oxford, or Bacon. According to José Argüelles, Pacal was an
extraterrestrial spirit-being, so it would have been no problem for him
to go from seventh-century AD Palenque to sixteenth-century AD London,
and it goes without saying that an extraterrestrial spirit-being would
be far more likely to display Shakespeare's astonishing and encyclopedic
knowledge than any mundane mortal. In addition to taking the form of
'Shakespeare,' Pacal also took the form of 'Geoffrey Chaucer,' so my
hypothesis dovetails neatly with Chaucerianism.

Now that I have founded Pacalism, I need only sit back and wait for that
bit of evidence that proves it wrong. Or perhaps I should get to work
on my book, _Pacal: Father of Queen Elizabeth I_, in which I use the
Super-KP theory to show that Elizabeth had to remain an unmarried Virgin
Queen in order to conceal her extraterrestrial origins.

That is my main reason for posting here, Mark. And I assure

Do you? OK, as our topic is stylometric evidence, I think that
the graph I give at
blows it out of the water. The corresponding data are given at
, which will allow
you to reconstruct the graph, should you so wish, according to
Oxfordian datings. My one uses Wells and Taylor's.

Then compare the two. The coefficient of determination (R^2)
of the Shakespeare data on my chart, a measure of the
trendline's validity, is 0.8742 or over 87%.

However, using Eva Turner Clark's dates, for example, this
figure drops to 0.1117 (11%) which is little better than a
random distribution. (And if you remove *Henry VIII* it goes
down to below 5%!)

I obtained Clark's dates from a post by Paul Streitz in 1999.

So my request WAS pertinent. I take it from your recentest post that

someone whose NAME was &quot;William Shakespeare&quot; wrote those works?

We've been over this before, Peter -- although
I don't remember the presentation of your data
being in such a mess. It's very hard to follow
your 'reasoning' this time.

However, you are allowing yourself to be fooled
by your own numbers. It is a very easy thing to
do -- it happens to me all the time. It happens
to everyone who works with figures like this --
as all scientists know. That's why you have to
get your 'reasoning' checked out by someone
else, who (a) is competent at this kind of thing;
and (b) is prepared to put the time in to try to
follow your argument.

You obviously haven't had your work checked.

One very obvious error -- which I pointed out to
you years ago -- is that you are manipulating
your figures to produce entirely spurious sets
of 'results' on which you then subject to a test
for correlation, inevitably producing a super-
duper 'positive' result. (And when you get a
R2 of 87% you should KNOW you've screwed
up. No one _ever_ gets an R2 of that size.)

To give you a parallel (a) pick at random 40
different literary works; (b) arrange them any
way you like, say in alphabetical order of name;
(c) go through your list of 'function words' and
find which words show a pattern of 'increasing'
(up words) and which show a pattern of
'decreasing' (down words) -- over your
alphabetical range). Depending how you do it,
a fair number will show an adequate pattern
of going up or going down. Discard the rest
(a vital step).

Then for each work, add up the total of the 'up
words' and the total of the 'down words',
divide one by the other, put it all on a graph
and -- hey presto -- you'll have proof that
. . . . . err . . . . your method works over an
alphabetical order -- words that go up, really
do go up; and words that go down, really do
go down. You'll have a damn good correlation
figure. Pass the results on to Art Neuendorffer,
and he'll be sure to make a special sense out
of it for you. You'll have discovered some fresh

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It happens
&gt; to everyone who works with figures like this --
&gt; as all scientists know. That's why you have to
&gt; get your 'reasoning' checked out by someone
&gt; else, who (a) is competent at this kind of thing;
&gt; and (b) is prepared to put the time in to try to
&gt; follow your argument.

&gt; You obviously haven't had your work checked.

&gt; One very obvious error -- which I pointed out to
&gt; you years ago -- is that you are manipulating
&gt; your figures to produce entirely spurious sets
&gt; of 'results' on which you then subject to a test
&gt; for correlation, inevitably producing a super-
&gt; duper 'positive' result. (And when you get a
&gt; R2 of 87% you should KNOW you've screwed
&gt; up. No one _ever_ gets an R2 of that size.)

&gt; To give you a parallel (a) pick at random 40
&gt; different literary works; (b) arrange them any
&gt; way you like, say in alphabetical order of name;
&gt; (c) go through your list of 'function words' and
&gt; find which words show a pattern of 'increasing'
&gt; (up words) and which show a pattern of
&gt; 'decreasing' (down words) -- over your
&gt; alphabetical range). Depending how you do it,
&gt; a fair number will show an adequate pattern
&gt; of going up or going down. Discard the rest
&gt; (a vital step).

&gt; Then for each work, add up the total of the 'up
&gt; words' and the total of the 'down words',
&gt; divide one by the other, put it all on a graph
&gt; and -- hey presto -- you'll have proof that
&gt; . . . . . err . . . . your method works over an
&gt; alphabetical order -- words that go up, really
&gt; do go up; and words that go down, really do
&gt; go down. You'll have a damn good correlation
&gt; figure. Pass the results on to Art Neuendorffer,
&gt; and he'll be sure to make a special sense out
&gt; of it for you. You'll have discovered some fresh
&gt; aspect of the nature of literary works in the

Thanks for that amusing digression, Paul, but I think
we should get back to the figures I presented, don't you?

Here's what you do.

1) Take all of the plays believed to be in the
Shakespeare canon, in any order you like. The date
doesn't matter in the slightest at this stage.

2) Against each play, write down:
* the number of lines of verse
* the number of run-on lines (enjambments)
* the number of feminine endings

[You don't have to count these yourself. I believe I found
them in Methuen's *Shakespeare Encyclopaedia*, under 'verse
tests']

3) For each play, add together the number of run-on lines
and the number of feminine endings, and express this
total as a percentage of the number of lines of verse.

4) Now, against each play, put a year for its authorship,
quite unrelated to those figures.

[I used the dates (or a rough midpoint of the dates) given
by Gary Taylor in his and Wells's *Textual Companion* to
their Oxford Complete Works. Obviously I could have chosen
any one of several suggested lists of dates]

5) Now plot the figures obtained in step 3) against the
dates given in step 4) on an X-Y scattergraph.

6) Get the spreadsheet to insert a trendline, and to
display the R2 value for you.

Using the dates suggested by different scholars, we get
the following R2 values (how much confidence we can place
in the validity of a linear trendline in each case):

Taylor - 86%
Schoenbaum - 87%
Riverside - 86%
Bloom - 85%
Chambers - 88%

When we insert the dates given by Eva Turner Clark,
however, this figure plummets to 9%.

Not that you really need to have these figures, of course.
Simply looking at the graph

shows how ridiculous it is to suggest that those last five
plays (Coriolanus, Winter's Tale, Cymbeline, The Tempest,
&amp; Henry VIII) were written before Oxford's death in 1604.

What would work, of course, would be for you to shift
every single play back in time by about the same amount
(say 10 years?). Has any Oxfordian suggested this?

This led Ule to conclude that the work was done at two different
times.

Which is possible.

But in any case threaders can see the assumption that a writer has a
fixed style that he or she cannot change is wrong.

I like to give the example with rare words.

There are many common words that Shakespeare simply didn't use.

Surely he knew them....

If we were to find a play were he did use one, even frequently, would
it mean it wasn't his?

Hardly.

Hope you get that e-mailer fixed.

Paul,

Just a note from the past. Ule was the first person to actually run
the _entire_ canons of Marlowe and Shakespeare and to use a method
that overlapped entire canons.

Another way of saying this is that most authorship studies take
samples, but Ule took no samples. He did _entire_ canons.

That study showed a remarkable overlapped between the works of Marlowe
and Shakespeare, an overlap that puts some of Marlowe's and
Shakespeare's works closer &quot;together&quot; than are some of the works
inside their respective canons.

Ule didn't know what the program would find when he ran it. But the
results have been published (and ignored) for decades.

Neither one of us is likely to author a concordance to the works of
the Shakespeare's Apocrypha or Nashe or Marlowe...as Ule did, let
alone have them published by Georg Olms Verlag. I think they are
still in print.

Ule did this in the days when data was entered by key punch and all a
guy could get was a line on a punch card. He had rooms full of punch
cards!! (:})

It is a well established fact that the name William Shakespeare did
not appear on a title page until after Marlowe's death.

It is an equally well known fact that there was no forensic
information linking the body said Marlowe's to Marlowe...just the
testimony of those three friends.

Why would anyone have stood by the body and faced charges when they
could have dumped it in the river and vanished into the night, Paul?

Surely they stood with it in order to identify it.

Peter has proven that the Inquest was invalid. Outside the
jurisdiction of the Queen and without the aid of the local Coroner.

And then we have him turning up alive at Valladolid six years later to
the day...20/30 May 1596...not to mention a sixty year trickle ( or
tickle) of his works that did not end until 8/18 April 1654 or on the
61st anniversary of the appearance of _Venus and Adonis_, kinda odd
right?

You have your &quot;Relative use of 50 different function
words&quot; up on your site as

telling us that it is based on your 'Appendix IX'.

And since you don't tell us on which item of 'stylometric
evidence' you calculated your R^2 of 87%, I had good
grounds for assuming that it was on that.

If this is NOT correct, please re-write your web pages so
that other people can follow them. For example, you tell
us that your data is at

The filename 'appx9a.htm' is not a helpful filename --
especially when you give the page the title:
&quot;A Deception in Deptford - App'x IX&quot;

And then your headings within this document are:

&quot;APPENDIX IX - Source data for Appendices V - VIII
Date Appendix V Appendix VI Appendix VII Appendix VIII &quot;

All that MAY mean something to you. Apart from
the word 'Date', it means nothing to me -- nor
would mean anything to anyone else.

Further confusion results from incorrect web
references in your posts, and exceedingly vague
and sloppy descriptions, like this

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

What kind of 'stylometric evidence' are we expected
find on the web page we eventually get there.? How
come that nothing on any of your web pages refers to
any other (except maybe through some obscure
'Appendix coding). Why can't you use HTML pointers
-- so we can go back and forward between your text
and your graphs?

You then claim that this &quot;graph blows [the Oxfordian
case] out of the water&quot;. Oh yeah?

I am still not sure which &quot;graph&quot; we are talking about,
nor which data it is supposedly based upon. Nor how
anything blows anything Oxfordian out of the water.
Names and cross-references can be useful at times,
Peter rather than lists of various 'appendices' with
Latin numerals.

You do NOT show that figure on any of your charts

My problem with this 'reasoning' is that you
assume that Shakespeare did not know what
a feminine ending was, nor a run-on-line, and
that he had as much control over his use of
them as, say, he had over, say, his liver function,
or the rate at which his arteries hardened.

That is the unstated assumption. For, if he DID
know, then it would have been under conscious
control, and -- believe it or not -- he'd have decided
for each work (and indeed, each character and each
scene) what style to use, with these issues as a
normal part of those decisions.

One of the strange aspects of this 'reasoning' --
(and this type of 'reasoning') is that it is NEVER
applied to any other author. It is a speciality of
Strats (and their Marlite acolytes) in respect of
the Great Bard alone.

Why do you think that is the case?

You might as well apply computers to the search
for the Holy Grail.

Before you ever get into numbers, you should
state clearly in ENGLISH what it is that you are
trying to prove. How can anyone, with one grain
of sense, set out to justify the theory that Shake-
speare did NOT know what feminine endings
were . . nor run-on lines?

One thing that the article says is that works were analyzed as wholes.
Since it's already well accepted that 2NK was a collaboration, and
bloody obvious that parts of E3 were not written by the same person as
the rest (or at least not at the same time), these results are
interesting, but not particularly significant.

It would be interesting if E3 turned out to be a collaboration (after

"/>

No Paul, I am showing 'beyond reasonable doubt' that
the Oxfordian theory is a non-starter, remember?

I am sorry you found my earlier attempts too hard to
follow, though. I will try to make this one simpler.

Please look at the following chart:

Each of the white squares represents a play by Shake-
speare. I have added up the number of run-on lines
and the number of feminine endings for each of those
plays, and calculated what percentage that number is
of the number of lines of verse in that play.

[There are also black circular spots corresponding to
plays by Marlowe, but these may be ignored as far as
this particular discussion is concerned.]

If you look at the Y-axis (that's the vertical one)
you will see that it shows percentages running from
0% to 100%. The vertical position of each play shows
us the percentage I calculated for that play.

If you look at the X-axis (that's the horizontal one)
you will see dates running from 1580 to 1615. I have
placed each play according to the date given to it by
Wells and Taylor, the editors of the Oxford *Complete
Works of Shakespeare&quot;. Wherever they give a possible
range of dates, I have placed it at the midpoint of
that range.

If you are interested in knowing which play is which,
what the date is, and what the percentage, look at:

As you will see, only one of the columns gives
percentages - the one headed Appendix VII. These,
obviously, or at least obvious to most people,
are the relevant ones.

Returning to the chart, we see that (if the dates
are roughly correct) there is a very clear increase
in Shakespeare's relative use of 'run-on lines +
feminine endings' over time. Since the use of such
techniques is a conscious decision, we may assume
that he found them more and more acceptable and
pleasing to his 'ear' as the years went by.

Such a change over time is called a trend, and a
single line which best 'fits' a trend of this type
can be calculated. The line which best fits the
data plotted on the graph has been worked out, and
is shown thereon.

[Various ways of calculating such a trendline are
possible. In this case the one offering the best fit
was the so-called 'polynomial' version, based upon a
quadratic equation. This is the one shown.]

Very few of the plays actually fall on the line, of
course; each one deviates from it to a greater or
lesser extent. The overall extent of this deviation
can be used to calculate how valid the trendline is;
in other words how useful it is likely to be in
drawing conclusions based upon it. The greater the
deviation, the less valid it is. In this case,
however, the deviation is relatively small.

[In other words, there is a very high correlation
between the two variables: r = 0.935]

The average (mean) value for all of the plays' per-
centages is 41%. [This will not be exactly the same
figure that one would get for his works if they were
lumped together, of course].

What we can calculate is how much of the overall
variation from that mean figure can be explained by
the trend [ie the regression of Y on X] and how much
must be due to other random factors. In this case
(although this is not given on the chart) we can
calculate that no less than 87% of the variation is
due to the trend, and therefore only around 13% of
it arises from other factors. Clearly, this is very
valid indeed, and we can have a high confidence in
predictions or estimations based upon it.

Similarly high results are obtained if we replace
the dates suggested by Wells and Taylor with those
of others, whether Chambers, Schoenbaum, Bloom, or
the 'Riverside' editors, for example.

Had Taylor *derived* his dates mainly from those
metrical changes, of course, the high correlation
would have been inevitable; but he didn't.

The reasons he has for ascribing a particular date
to each play are described in detail in his &quot;The
Canon and Chronology of Shakespeare's Plays&quot;, a
chapter in his and Wells's *Textual Companion* (pp.
89-134). A large range of types of evidence, both
'external' and 'internal', is considered each time.
Just *one* of the several 'internal' ones is a
'metre test', by Wentersdorf. This combines at least
eight different types of metrical information into
one 'portmanteau' figure, and two of these bits of
information are 'feminine endings' and 'overflows',
(which I take to be run-on lines or enjambments.)

Reading how Taylor reached his conclusions, however,
it is clear that these 'metre tests' played only a
tiny part in it, and that he would have arrived at
a virtually identical result in each case even if
he had not had this information available to him at
all.

So we have two sets of data assembled in a way that
keeps the possible contamination of one set of data
by the other to an insignificant minimum.

Yet when we plot these two sets of figures upon a
chart we find that the date upon which the play was
said to have been written (the independent variable)
has a highly significant effect upon the percentage
of lines of verse having run-on on lines or feminine
endings (the dependent variable).

What conclusions may we draw from this?

1) that the relative percentage of run-on lines and
feminine endings in the verse of his plays did
increase steadily throughout Shakespeare's career.

2) that any suggested series of dates for the plays
that does not reflect this fact in amounts comparable
to those at present offered by the majority of Shake-
spearean scholars is almost certainly wrong.

For example, when we use the dates suggested by Eva
Turner Clark, (the only Oxfordian attempt that I am
aware of, but I am happy to try any others that come
to light), we find that only 11% of the variation is
explained by the trend, and no less than 89% arises
from other random factors.

We may therefore conclude beyond reasonable doubt
that her suggested timescale is impossible, and that
unless Oxfordians can come up with another timescale
adequately explaining these percentages for all of
the plays currently thought to have been written
after 1604, when Oxford died, their whole theory,
as I said earlier on, is blown out of the water.

pete ... @rey.prestel.co.uk

P.S. While we are on the subject, it is perhaps worth
mentioning that if we were to include those Marlowe
plays (as dated by Tucker Brook) in the calculation,
the R^2 value of the trendline would then go up from
87% to nearly 90% (0.8961).

Jim,
I know Baker and Yogi, and Baker isn't him. Nor is he Alciades, or
Elizabeth Weir. I know this for a fact, so take a different tack.

John really isn't web-savvy enough to change names to avoid
filters...He is simply enthusiastic, even gleeful, when he's writing
and posting, whooping like a cowboy riding a bucking bronco. And if he
is occasionally thrown unceremoniously to the ground, he picks himself
back up and rides again--in an effort to tame own exuberance, and
stick it to the opposition.

It is interesting that Jim would imagine that John Baker and Elizabeth
Weir are the same person based solely on the evidence that Baker once
signed a post 'Liz' several years before Elizabeth started posting here.
It reminds me just a bit of overenthusiastic Shakespeareans' efforts to
identify William Shakespeare as the 'pleasant Willy' Spenser mentions in
_The Tears of the Muses_.

When we know who KQKnave is we'll know everything. He uses several
names and places to post from, no doubt most of those below, I doubt
that Baker is so dedicated to confusing the issues and concealing his
identity, while it is Knave's chief project. It's a comfortable thing
for Knave. He can empty his mouth at HLAS and there's no one who can
be blamed. Very Elizabethan, very like the Shake-speare puzzle, a
name only and no real person behind it. Unless, of course, you like
the Stratford man to be the &quot;soul of the age,&quot; and what a piece of
irony Ben Jonson wrote in that line.

killfile his own posts?

It would be interesting to know for certain whether Spenser was
referring to Lyly or to someone else, but it wouldn't bother me to let
the mystery remain a mystery, either. A world without mysteries would
be a very dull place indeed.
