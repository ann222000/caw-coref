Hi
I have a 1993 Audi 90S V-6 and when I first take off with it, when engine is
cold, the engine almost dies out right after I leave my driveway.  After I
pump the gas pedal a few times it runs fine afterwards.  Any ideas?  Could
the EGR valve or Idle air speed have anything to do with it?

Thanks for any help.

There could be a number of causes like vacuum leak, coolant temp sensor
malfunction, outside temp sensor, dirty injectors, low fuel pressure, dirty fuel
filter ...

You should try pulling the code to get a starting place.
