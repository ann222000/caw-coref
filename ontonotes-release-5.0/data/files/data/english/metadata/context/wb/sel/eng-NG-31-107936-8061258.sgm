Cheney pushes Bush to act on Iran
· Military solution back in favour as Rice loses out
· President 'not prepared to leave conflict unresolved'

The balance in the internal White House debate over Iran has shifted
back in favour of military action before President George Bush leaves
office in 18 months, the Guardian has learned.
The shift follows an internal review involving the White House, the
Pentagon and the state department over the last month. Although the
Bush administration is in deep trouble over Iraq, it remains focused
on Iran. A well-placed source in Washington said: &quot;Bush is not going
to leave office with Iran still in limbo.&quot;

The White House claims that Iran, whose influence in the Middle East
has increased significantly over the last six years, is intent on
building a nuclear weapon and is arming insurgents in Iraq and
Afghanistan.

The vice-president, Dick Cheney, has long favoured upping the threat
of military action against Iran. He is being resisted by the secretary
of state, Condoleezza Rice, and the defence secretary, Robert Gates.

Last year Mr Bush came down in favour of Ms Rice, who along with
Britain, France and Germany has been putting a diplomatic squeeze on
Iran. But at a meeting of the White House, Pentagon and state
department last month, Mr Cheney expressed frustration at the lack of
progress and Mr Bush sided with him. &quot;The balance has tilted. There is
cause for concern,&quot; the source said this week.

Nick Burns, the undersecretary of state responsible for Iran and a
career diplomat who is one of the main advocates of negotiation, told
the meeting it was likely that diplomatic manoeuvring would still be
continuing in January 2009. That assessment went down badly with Mr
Cheney and Mr Bush.

&quot;Cheney has limited capital left, but if he wanted to use all his
capital on this one issue, he could still have an impact,&quot; said
Patrick Cronin, the director of studies at the International Institute
for Strategic Studies.

The Washington source said Mr Bush and Mr Cheney did not trust any
potential successors in the White House, Republican or Democratic, to
deal with Iran decisively. They are also reluctant for Israel to carry
out any strikes because the US would get the blame in the region
anyway.

&quot;The red line is not in Iran. The red line is in Israel. If Israel is
adamant it will attack, the US will have to take decisive action,&quot; Mr
Cronin said. &quot;The choices are: tell Israel no, let Israel do the job,
or do the job yourself.&quot;

Almost half of the US's 277 warships are stationed close to Iran,
including two aircraft carrier groups. The aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise left Virginia last week for the Gulf. A Pentagon spokesman
said it was to replace the USS Nimitz and there would be no overlap
that would mean three carriers in Gulf at the same time.

No decision on military action is expected until next year. In the
meantime, the state department will continue to pursue the diplomatic
route.

Sporadic talks are under way between the EU foreign policy chief,
Javier Solana, and Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, on the
possibility of a freeze in Iran's uranium enrichment programme. Tehran
has so far refused to contemplate a freeze, but has provisionally
agreed to another round of talks at the end of the month.

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei,
has said that there are signs of Iran slowing down work on the
enrichment plant it is building in Natanz. Negotiations took place in
Tehran last week between Iranian officials and the IAEA, which is
seeking a full accounting of Iran's nuclear activities before Tehran
disclosed its enrichment programme in 2003. The agency's deputy
director general, Olli Heinonen, said two days of talks had produced
&quot;good results&quot; and would continue.

At the UN, the US, Britain and France are trying to secure agreement
from other security council members for a new round of sanctions
against Iran. The US is pushing for economic sanctions that would
include a freeze on the international dealings of another Iranian bank
and a mega-engineering firm owned by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.
Russia and China are resisting tougher measures.

Bush Will Act on Iran: Paper
Vice President &quot;Cheney has limited capital left, but if he wanted to
use all his capital on this one issue, he could still have an impact,&quot;
Patrick Cronin, director of studies at the International Institute for
Strategic Studies, told Britain's Guardian newspaper.
And what issue is he speaking of? An attack on Iran.
President Bush had, as recently as last year, favored and
international approach to containing Iran and its nuclear threat - a
position espoused by Sec. of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Sec.
Robert Gates. Although Rice did tell the Voice of America, when asked
if the United States should consider military action in Iran, that
President Bush &quot;is never going to take his options off the
table.&quot; [Editor's Note: Homeland security experts agree: Every home
should have an emergency radio. Click Here for our FREE Offer.]
But the Guardian now reports that Bush has lately been listening more
to Dick Cheney's point of view, which entails military action.
A well-placed source in Washington told the Guardian: &quot;Bush is not
going to leave office with Iran still in limbo,&quot; adding, &quot;The balance
has tilted. There is cause for concern.&quot;
The Guardian's source in Washington explained that as of now, Bush and
Cheney do not trust potential successors from either political party
to deal with Iran decisively.
Any reluctance to strike, however, originates with Israel. &quot;The red
line is not in Iran. The red line is in Israel. If Israel is adamant
it will attack, the U.S. will have to take decisive action,&quot; Cronin
adds. &quot;The choices are: tell Israel no, let Israel do the job, or do
the job yourself.&quot;
Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs said last week he had received
approval from the U.S. and Europe for an Israeli attack on Iran's
nuclear facilities.
&quot;If we start military operations against Iran alone, then Europe and
the U.S. will support us,&quot; Avigdor Lieberman said following a meeting
with NATO and European Union officials.
The United States says Iran is intent on building a nuclear weapon and
is arming insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Impeach Bush And Cheney Now
By Paul Craig Roberts
Unless Congress immediately impeaches Bush and Cheney, a year from now
the US could be a dictatorial police state at war with Iran.
Bush has put in place all the necessary measures for dictatorship in
the form of &quot;executive orders&quot; that are triggered whenever Bush
declares a national emergency. Recent statements by Homeland Security
Chief Michael Chertoff, former Republican senator Rick Santorum and
others suggest that Americans might expect a series of staged, or
false flag, &quot;terrorist&quot; events in the near future.
Many attentive people believe that the reason the Bush administration
will not bow to expert advice and public opinion and begin withdrawing
US troops from Iraq is that the administration intends to rescue its
unpopular position with false flag operations that can be used to
expand the war to Iran.
Too much is going wrong for the Bush administration: the failure of
its Middle East wars, Republican senators jumping ship, Turkish troops
massed on northern Iraq's border poised for an invasion to deal with
Kurds, and a majority of Americans favoring the impeachment of Cheney
and a near-majority favoring Bush's impeachment. The Bush
administration desperately needs dramatic events to scare the American
people and the Congress back in line with the militarist- police state
that Bush and Cheney have fostered.
William Norman Grigg recently wrote that the GOP is &quot;praying for a
terrorist strike&quot; to save the party from electoral wipeout in 2008.
Chertoff, Cheney, the neocon nazis, and Mossad would have no qualms
about saving the bacon for the Republicans, who have enabled Bush to
start two unjustified wars, with Iran waiting in the wings to be
attacked in a third war.
The Bush administration has tried unsuccessfully to resurrect the
terrorist fear factor by infiltrating some blowhard groups and
encouraging them to talk about staging &quot;terrorist&quot; events. The talk,
encouraged by federal agents, resulted in &quot;terrorist&quot; arrests hyped by
the media, but even the captive media was unable to scare people with
such transparent sting operations.
If the Bush administration wants to continue its wars in the Middle
East and to entrench the &quot;unitary executive&quot; at home, it will have to
conduct some false flag operations that will both frighten and anger
the American people and make them accept Bush's declaration of
&quot;national emergency&quot; and the return of the draft. Alternatively, the
administration could simply allow any real terrorist plot to proceed
without hindrance.
A series of staged or permitted attacks would be spun by the

&gt;

The only thing would stop Bush, would be a possible impeachment, and a
prospect of being hanged in The Hague. But the Democrats are almost as
complicit in his war crimes as he is. So the US has becoming more and
more a rogue nation, hated by all of the nations of the world.

The next President, if he/she will not be prevented to take office by
Bush declaring a 'Catastrophic Emergency', will have a hard job to mop
up the mess Bush will have left.

Whatever. And the Guardian is a &quot;reliable&quot; source. Given that their editorials are somewhat
pink, but not outright red, anything that paper writes is suspect from the get-go. Keep
sounding like a broken record, son, and nobody'll believe a word you say. How many times
