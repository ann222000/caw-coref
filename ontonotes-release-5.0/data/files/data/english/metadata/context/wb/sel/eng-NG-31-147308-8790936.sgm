BBQ Buddy,
As you know, Steve has been difficult to contact.  I have managed to
exchange exactly two emails with him this calendar year.  I used the
DST contact info.  If he hosts a domain for him, you might want to
file a complain to Tucows and see if that rouses him from his slumber.

Sorry D00d.

Mike.
P.S. We need to do another BBQ.  I'd like to see how that interface
you were working on is coming.  We'll probably be in the area to go to
the zoo sometime before the end of October, so let me know.

You were all invited the last time, but chose to not make the trip.
So sad.  Too bad.

I need to have another North Coast 4D BBQ sometime.

to the Summit
