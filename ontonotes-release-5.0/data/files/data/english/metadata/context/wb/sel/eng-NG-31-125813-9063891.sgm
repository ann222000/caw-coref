The whole of the North Norfolk coastline is well worth a visit.
For example (in order of closeness to KL) - Hunstanton, Brancaster,
Wells, Sheringham and Cromer.
Cheers

I seem to remember Wells Next Sea being lovely...

Hunstanton.  Very nice, although a bit touristy at times.  For less touristy
places try Heacham or Wells-next-the-Sea.  All three are within about
fifteen miles of Lynn.

If you are willing to try further afield along the North Norfolk cost, then
try Sheringham and Cromer.  Sheringham is my favourite as it has the North
Norfolk Railway.

&gt; We visited Penang when we were in KL.

I went on  Biology Field trip to Brancaster Staithe many years ago. It's
very nice for coastal walk, a small harbour, boat trips to the nature
reserves. They seem to have a very nice hotel (not where I stayed)
http://www.whitehorsebrancaster.co.uk/index.html

Not too far up the coast from there is Blakeney Point
http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-bla...
Not been myself, but recommended by friends for the seal colonies and
birds. Involves a longish walk apparently.

&gt; I wonder who Blakeney was. He has a ridge on the North York Moors.

He was in On the Buses I think.

I wasn't impressed with Cromer but loved Sheringham and Hunstanton
although in general the place is a bit too flat for me.

Try running round the place...  or even cycling.   The top north-east corner
of Norfolk has some very steep lumps.

I've just Googled and the highest point in East Anglia seems to be a 420
feet hill (Great Wood Hill) which surprised me.

I trudged up the Beeston Bump near Sheringham in the early summer, that
felt like a mountain when I got to the top!  Some poor kid had scratched
&quot;Dad's a git&quot; in the concrete under the bench at the top, I'm guessing dad
made them climb it as well!

Local day-trip refuge for local elderly and chavs from
Northamptonshire. Along with Skeggy of course.:)

I rarely go there anymore - the last thing I want to see on a trip
away from home is a bunch of drunken locals from this area!

Other people probably wouldn't notice them.

Suinny Hunny is a nice place though - sort of unassumingly genteel.

I wonder why they plumped for that name, it doesn't rather make
sense.
Why not Wells-next-to-the-sea or Wells-by-the-sea. Apparently when
they opened the local railway in the 1850s the station there was
called Wells-on-sea but the council changed it back to Wells-next-the-
sea in the 1950s.
