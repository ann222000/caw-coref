Portuguese Prosecutor Asks to Seize 'Mystery Object' in Madeleine McCann
Probe
Wednesday, September 12, 2007

A Portuguese judge reportedly is deciding whether to grant an emergency
request by the public prosecutor in the Madeleine McCann case seeking to
seize a &quot;mystery object&quot; described as being vital to the investigation.

Evidence suggesting that Kate and Gerry McCann, the parents of the missing
girl who disappeared just short of her fourth birthday, were involved in
their daughter's death was passed to the judge late Tuesday night.

In addition to the prosecutor's request, the judge will consider whether the
couple should be charged.

The judge has a number of options, including ordering the couple to return
to the Algarve to be placed under house arrest, or submit to further police
questioning. He also could order additional searches and wire taps. The
judge has 10 days to make his ruling.

The public prosecutor's request to seize an &quot;object&quot; vital to the inquiry
could include searching areas such as a lawyer's office or a place of
worship, which are protected under Portuguese laws.

The Daily Mail reported that sources claim the item is Kate McCann's diary.

The newspaper also reported that police want to confiscate Madeleine's toys,
including her favorite Cuddle Cat, which Kate McCann has very publicly held
on to since her daughter vanished.

Police reportedly also want to examine the toys for forensic evidence to see
how much DNA they contain of Madeleine.

Yesterday was a day of significant developments in the case, including:

- The handing over to the public prosecutor of 10 box files containing more
than a thousand pages of evidence detailing DNA results, police interviews
with the couple, witness statements, intercepted e-mails and tapped phone
calls;

- Police telling Portuguese newspapers that a large quantity of Madeleine's
hair was found in the trunk of the car that her parents hired 25 days after
she disappeared;

- Detectives briefing local newspapers that bodily fluid with an 88 percent
match to the child was also found in the car; and,

- A visit to the McCanns' home in Rothley, Leicestershire, by a senior
police official.

In a statement outside his offices in Portimão, a spokeswoman for José Cunha
de Magalhães e Meneses, the prosecutor, said that he believed that the files
contained sufficient evidence to change aspects of the McCanns' status in
the case. He passed the case on to the judge who rules on crimes still under
investigation.

In another development, Portuguese Attorney General Fernando Jose Pinto
Monterio entered the investigation, appointing a second public prosecutor to
the case.

Luis Bilro Veinõ, from the Evora district in central Portugal, will work
with Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses to help with the vast amount of evidence.
He is one of Portugal's most senior public prosecutors and a member of the
governing body, the Conselho Superior da Magistratura Portuguesa. Monterio
said that he hoped that &quot;objectivity and serenity&quot; would now prevail, and
said that during such a complex investigation it was necessary to make
&quot;uncomfortable investigations&quot;.

Indicating that the investigation could yet be widened away from just
Britain and Portugal, the attorney general said: &quot;The investigations did not
end so we will need more interventions from the police. After that we should
re-evaluate the restrictions it is possible to impose and which level of
international co-operation we will need.&quot;

Detectives are convinced that Kate McCann was in some way linked to the
accidental death of her daughter, and that she and her husband then disposed
of the body.

Hair and bodily fluids have been found in the trunk of the car that the
McCanns hired shortly before visiting the Vatican. Police have said that the
amount of hair in the Renault Scenic is too much simply to have been
transferred on Madeleine's clothing and other belongings when the couple
moved to a villa in the resort.

One trace of bodily fluids has an 88 percent match with the child, rather
than the 100 percent match that was previously reported, detectives said in
an off-the-record briefing on Monday night. They denied that blood traces
had been found.

The McCanns, both 39-year-old doctors, vehemently deny any involvement in
the death. They fear that they are being framed by police and that evidence
is being planted.

The latest developments came as Dr. Michael Baden, a world-reknowned
forensic expert with the New York State Police, told The Times of London
that a decaying body would produce a &quot;mass of material&quot; unless it was
tightly wrapped.

Baden, who has investigated hundreds of child murders, said: &quot;In a body
which had been decaying for 25 days you would expect to find a mass of
material unless the body was tightly wrapped. But if it was so tightly
wrapped, how was the hair able to escape?&quot;

Baden said that bacteria causes the body to putrefy and the decomposing
tissues merge with the blood. The lining of the nose and mouth are the first
to liquefy. It would still be possible to obtain a good DNA sample from such
material.

Mr Baden added: &quot;From the details that have been reported I do not think
there is evidence that a corpse was in the trunk.&quot;

If the judge approves new searches they will focus on the streets around the
church in Praia da Luz, the resort where Madeleine vanished shortly before
her fourth birthday. Police sources told local newspapers that the child's
body could have been concealed in the area, where roadworks were being
completed, in the days after her disappearance before being later moved.

The McCanns went to pray for their daughter in the village's 18th-century
church, Nossa Senhora da Luz. Within an hour of reporting the child missing
they asked for the local Catholic priest, and a few days later were given
keys to the church so that they could visit at any time.

Father José Manuel Pacheco, the priest, said: &quot;I find it perfectly normal
that the police will carry out new searches in Praia da Luz, and not
excepting the church.&quot; However, he said he had not been informed that the
church itself would be searched.

Detective Chief Superintendent Bob Small, head of Leicestershire's special
crime investigation unit, spent an hour at the McCanns' home yesterday. The
East Midlands force refused to confirm or comment on the visit. Portuguese
police are still waiting for further tests to be returned from the Forensic
Science Service in Birmingham
