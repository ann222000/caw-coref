I found the following interesting:

"If the damaged DNA is in one of the germ cells (egg or sperm) then
the DNA changes may be carried into the next generation. While many
plant and animal experiments leave no doubt that radiation exposure
can alter genetic material, we should note that this genetic effect
has not yet been observed in the case of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki
survivors. However this does not mean that there is no such effect in
humans. It may be that there were genetic abnormalities produced that
were incompatible with life and those pregnancies therefore ended in
miscarriage. It may also be that an increased rate of genetic
abnormalities will be found in future generations, that is, the
changes will skip one or more generations.

The phenomenon called genomic instability has been the subject of
research in recent years. This is the process whereby damage inflicted
on cells is detected only after several cell divisions. This
phenomenon has been reproduced several times in laboratory studies of
human cells but has not been confirmed in living humans. Such studies
would necessarily need to be extraordinarily long. However if the
theory of induced genetic instability is correct, then the human gene
pool could be permanently altered."

I'm convinced that before genetic engineering of humans can occur to
make them non-aggressive there will be at least one (if not more)
nuclear bombs detonated on civilian populations either by nuclear
terrorists (due largely to unsecured nuclear material) and/or by
states. Unlike Hoelzer I don't see this just as a current "snapshot in
time". Theoretically, the international environment could change but I
see no "forseeable" trends leading to non-proliferation and securing
nuclear materials, taking nuclear warhaeads off launch status, etc. Of
course, the biggest threat is between the U.S. and Russia which have
the majority of the nuclear arsenal but a nuclear terrorists could
trigger and inflame the international situation to the degree other
countries could become involved.
The hypothetical question I'm interested in is would a "widespread"
nuclear conflict (and this would need to be defined by the tonnage and
destructiveness of nuclear weapons detonated on civilian/military
centers) cause genomic instability of the human species?

Although according to this article germ cells were not damaged in
Hiroshima and Nagasaki these were small bombs compared with the
warheads today or the fissionable material located at nuclear sites.
Since animal experiments leave no doubt radiation exposure can alter
genetic material it seems a widespread nuclear event could damage the
germ cells in some way. Is this reasonable to assume? As the article
states, "It may also be that an increased rate of genetic
abnormalities will be found in future generations, that is, the
changes will skip one or more generations." The Japanese people? Â The
Marshallese people? Any info on this?

It goes on to say, "The phenomenon called genomic instability has been
the subject of research in recent years. This is the process whereby
damage inflicted on cells is detected only after several cell
divisions. This phenomenon has been reproduced several times in
laboratory studies of human cells but has not been confirmed in living
humans". I suppose if a big enough nuclear event does happen this will
provide existing scientists with a new "fruitful" area" of research.
Finally, it states "However if the theory of induced genetic
instability is correct, then the human gene pool could be permanently
altered". How? That is what I'm curious about. Are there any
geneticists with enough of a background in nuclear radiation to at
least hypothsize what the genetic consequences could be?

I've also read that those humans who survived a big nuclear event and
were able to reproduce would be a highly selectable minority. Assuming
that is the case what would this special population possess in terms
of genes to be able to survive and propagate? I'm assuming a nuclear
winter scenario here.

I have to assume the military has already come up with "contingency"
plans for various scenarios but I think there are some unanswered
scientific questions. Given the current climate it seems likely
martial law would be declared but with a country with this size
population it would seem likely there would be a scarcity of resources
to respond; witness Hurricane Katrina.

Of course there is North Korea, Pakistan and India and Iran. One saw
how the U.S. responded to 911; bombing Afghanistan and invading and
bombing Iraq and killing 100,000 women and children. What would be
their response if they found out a terrorist cell who detonated a
nuclear bomb in the U.S. was supported by a state? Likely they would
respond with nuclear weapons. This Administration has a record of when
something bad happens of making it worse.

Australia is a rich source of uranium.

Medical Association for Prevention of War, Australia
The health impacts of nuclear power
Nuclear Forum, UNSW, October 18, 2006
Dr Sue Wareham, Former President,
Medical Association for Prevention of War
"The health impacts of nuclear power" is not necessarily an easy topic
to talk on because it is an area of medicine where there are large
gaps in our knowledge. Our knowledge has been evolving over about a
century or more, and for most of this time it has been a controversial
area of medicine, significantly because powerful interests have
clashed with the need for open, transparent research.

After the discovery of strange rays emanating from a compound of
uranium in 1896, and hence the discovery of radioactivity, which
followed very closely the discovery of X-rays in 1895, scientists and
the medical community sought applications for these new and intriguing
phenomena. However it soon became apparent that there were hazards
associated with their use, especially the development of cancers.

It was in 1928 that the first recommended limits for radiation
exposure were set. Since that time these limits have been revised on a
number of occasions, and on each occasion they have been reduced. That
is, new knowledge on the biological effects of radiation exposure has
consistently raised further concerns about the effects of previously
accepted levels of exposure.

It would therefore be extremely foolish to regard our current state of
knowledge as final, and to accept currently accepted exposure levels
as guaranteeing safety. In fact exposure limits are not designed to
guarantee safety. They are set at a level that is said to reduce risk
to "acceptable" levels. This in itself is not necessarily a criticism.
Most human activities expose us to some risk. What is more worrying
however is the fact that the nuclear age is very young and decisions
we make now, with our deeply imperfect state of knowledge, may have
lasting adverse effects for an extremely long time.

Early understanding of radiation biology was that there was a
threshold below which radiation caused no harm. This threshold
hypothesis has largely been abandoned, and there is now near universal
agreement that there is no evidence of a threshold below which
radiation exposure poses no risk. The Committee on the Biological
Effects of Ionizing Radiation, which is a panel within the US National
Academy of Sciences, re-affirmed in its most recent statement in June
2005 that "the smallest dose has the potential to cause a small
increase in risk to humans".

In June 2005, the British Medical Journal published a review of the
risk of cancer after low doses of ionising radiation to workers in the
nuclear industry in 15 countries, and this showed a small excess risk
of cancer. While the fact that the risk from low level radiation
exposure may be small in any particular individual, when this risk is
translated across populations, the increase in numbers of cancers can
be considerable.

One of the factors that the nuclear industry frequently reminds us of
is the fact that we are all exposed to background radiation, from
cosmic rays from the sun, from outer space, from gamma radiation from
the ground and from building materials, and to the naturally occurring
isotopes, especially potassium, in our own bodies. In addition
radiation from the legacy of atmospheric nuclear tests, from luminous
watch dials and high-altitude flights add to our exposure, as do
medical tests involving X-rays or nuclear medicine scans that many of
us undergo. What the industry does not tell us is that there is no
evidence that any of these things, including background radiation, are
perfectly safe. Almost certainly they contribute to cancer in our
society regardless of additional radiation from the nuclear power
industry.

It is well accepted in medicine that tests involving ionising
radiation should not be done unless the expected benefit outweighs the
risk of low-level radiation exposure. This is not a controversial
aspect of medicine. It is core, mainstream medical practice. It is
also unquestioned that X-rays are not done early in pregnancy when the
foetus is forming, and generally not in late pregnancy either, because
the risk to the foetus from X-rays is well known and accepted. We know
that children are more sensitive to the effects of radiation than
adults, and females are more sensitive than males.

How does ionising radiation affect health ?
Radiation exposure involves the transfer of energy to bodily tissues,
and this energy can harm or destroy molecules in human and other
animal cells. If the dose of radiation is sufficiently high, such as
that received by some of the liquidators at Chernobyl and by many of
the victims at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, then acute radiation sickness
will result, with predictable results that can be fatal depending on
the dose.

If the dose of radiation is low, however, the situation is less clear-
cut. Often the damage done to a cell is not clinically important. But
if the damage is to a molecule of DNA, which

Ragland,

I have an issue with the gross inconsistency of the MANY Â DIVERSE
rationales that have been tendered by many "experts" each speaking as though
from a cloud above -- if not Mt. Olympus, then certainly -- above the heads
of the ignorant masses of non-experts.

By 1900 there was a wide concensus among many fields of scientific inquiry
and speculation that there was a fundamental flaw in Darwin's concept of
natural selection, which was the SAME flaw in Lamarck's concept of
transmission of acquired characteristics; which was the SAME flaw in Herbert
Spencer's notion of "survival of the fittest," which... you get the idea...
was:

NONE Â OF Â THEM Â HAD Â COME Â UP Â WITH Â THE Â MECHANISM Â OR Â MECHANISMS Â PER
SE.

You and I know that Darwin kept REVISING his "Origin of the Species" in an
effort to "adapt" it to the objections of his peers. Â And historians who
have read the eleven or so REVISIONS have observed that, with each and every
rewrite his ideas became more, and more and more and more... guess what...
LAMARCKIAN.

When Mendel's work got resurrected (roughly a half century after it first
came out), as a result of its being perceived by an increasing number of
theorists and critics to offer the missing "mechanism," that (if I've got it
right from my reading) was what enabled the New Darwinian Synthesis (also
called Neo-Darwinism). Â And some historians (if I've got this right)
indicate that up to then there was a wide split between the preference among
many leading biologists for the classical Darwinian view of "natural
selection" and the paleontologists' preference for a more Lamarckian view.
Putting it very succinctly (hence in risk of distortion by simplistication)
paleontologists and biologists had a new synthesis which both could see some
possible sense in.

Today, if we were to say that *THE Â MECHANISM Â WHEREBY Â NATURAL SELECTION
TRANSPIRES* is clear and present and of a sufficient degree of detailed
verification to be termed a "law" (in the scientific sense) that would be AT
VERY Â BEST Â premature... and, at WORST, it would be presumptious and could
turn out to be untenable somewhere downstream from today.

This old layman has said it before and shall say it again, "Science is NOT
dogma. Â And deciples of a dogma, no matter how many experts might subscribe
to it, is Â not "top rate" science.

The angrier any entrenched advocate gets upon being accused of bias, the
more this old layman is reminded of the saying among political analysits
that, "When they say it's not about the money... it's about the money." Â I
use that analogy not because money is at issue (at least not in every
instance) but because certain GROUP Â CONSENSUSES Â as to the claiming of one
school of thought asserting their favorite presumptions against members of
members of another veritable cult of opinion, impress this old coot as more
of a "shouting match" and less of an actual search for answers... which is
what I would guess that "top rate" science should be about. Â And the
comparison is that when someone says it's not about a grouping of members of
a common opinion, that very well might be EXACTLY what it is about.

What ever happened to "I don't know.. but I'll tell you what I THINK," and
without opponents trying to enshrine their "opinion" in an ivory ego temple,
and put it on a pedestal.

If it were simple, obvious, and confirmed in minute detail, then there would
not BE any debate. Â And a many a person would not have to be called "stupid"
or "intransigent" or some such derogatory nomenclature for not bowing his
head in abject subjection.

If someone is going to point to a human and tell me that natural selection
by way of selfish genes made him smart enough to out-survive other critters,
then that person should not mind my asking, why the same did not happen to,
say, opossums. Â I read in a publication for game biologists that the very
most essential characteristic of Opossum Virginialis' which most accounts
for its adaptation to multiple geographical areas and invironments is the
fact that it is too stupid to get into habitat and food source ruts. Â More
specifically, the article informs that the cerebral cavity of a Virginia
Opossum, by comparison to other species indicates that it is "playing with
only about two-thirds of a deck."

So what have we here. Â Smart out-survives dumb for humans; but dumb
out-survives smart for opossums.

Oh, the rationalizing might go, I'm not looking at the WHOLE picture. Â What
works for an opossum works for the niche or niches they fill, but does not
work for the niche or niches humans fill. Â Get the picture. Â If one STARTS
OUT Â with the presumption that natural selection works because of
competition, then the way you PROVE that is by coming up with a
rationalization for why hot is cold and black is white and smart pays when
it pays and dumb pays when it pays...

If a scientist speaks of gradualism, and points to many species that have
changed gradually, and cites that to be a product of mutations, even during
times when geography, that is fine so far as it goes. Â But let him NOT Â OMIT
telling me how rhinoceroses were, by comparison, less vulnerable to
gradualism.

I'll stop. Â There are far too many rationalizations built upon
rationalizations built upon rationalizations for this poor old man to keep
up with... except to observe that as gaps appear in one's hypothesization,
if he is totally committed to it, all that is necessary is to beg the
presumption and gerrymander an explanation as to how it applies to the
"seeming" exception.

Ragland,

Let me expand a teensy bit on this point.

If I ask a deeply committed advocate of natural selection why there were
changes in the lengths of giraffe's necks over a lot of millinea, the
regurge response is that the giraffes kept needing longer necks to reach
foliage higher than other animals could reach.

If I ask a deeply committed advocate of natural selection why elephants are
so big and strong, ONE reason might be that it enables them to push over
trees to eat the leaves which otherwise only giraffes could reach. Â Or, more
often the reason given to why any animal is big and strong is because that
provided an advantage of other animals that are smaller and weaker.

Then, if I ask a deeply committed advocate of natural selection why
rhinoceroses have remained so near the same for (millions?) of years, then
the answer is likely to be, "Oh, that's simple. Â They were well adapted way
back then, and did not HAVE to adapt as much as giraffes and elephants.

Or, if I ask a deeply committed advocate of nature selection why there was a
LINEAR progression from Eocene horses fossils in what is now the western
U.S. with four toes in front and three in back to hooves, then the answer
may be something such as "because hooves were advantageous."

I Â DO Â NOT Â REFUTE Â any of this. Â What my stance is, as of this moment is
NOT Â WHETHER natural selection has taken place, but HOW.

And if the discoveries of genes and DNA and RNA explain it, great. Â But one
question that keeps nagging at my curiosity is this:

If mutations are random, then why do they EVER come up with mutations that
CAN be selected in the first place.

I need to think through the sub-questions that lead up to this one,
actually. Â But something about the assertion that just giving something a
name does not explain the nitty gritty details NECESSARY for it to mean
anything.

If a patient asks a doctor, "What is causing me to have this fever, malaise,
joint pain, anorexia, muscle pain, joint pain ...?"

The doctor says, "Influenza."

Patient says, "Oh."

So, if we ask why giraffes "changed" to having longer necks, while elephants
got larger and grew long tusks, and
rhinocerouses stayed the same, and someone says, "Natural Selection."

There is an important difference between an explanation's being "self
explanatory" and its being "self instantiating."

Natural selection surely makes sense in its abstract simplistic form.
"Well, you see you get these random mutations and the ones that work get
chosen, while the ones that don't result in inferiority, which results in
getting cancelled out of the gene pool. Â Simple as that."

"How?"

"Genetics."

"Now that we KNOW how to compute it, what are the statistical odds against
ANY BENEFICIAL mutation being come up with in a species that will have any
ADAPTIVE Â VALUE? Â  One in ten. Â One in a hundred. Â One in a million?"

How can random mutations come up with a linear progression from four toes to
a hoof in front and three toes to a hoof in the back? Â When we think long
and hard about it, what were the odds of a whole SERIES of mutations coming
up with a hoof? Â Just random chance, huh?

What's wrong with that picture, until and unless we know EXACTLY why an
earthworm can have many times more genes than a human.

Now please do not think that were I am going with this is to any dogma,
theistic, pantheistic, magical, or any other.
I'm not. Â I am not offering an answer. Â I am only saying... how do we KNOW.

Natural Selection, as a model for describing some things that have occurred
in nature is POST Â HOC. Â It is taking a result and guessing up a model which
describes it, and giving that a name. Â (Darwin did a WONDERFUL job of
describing some aspects of what has happened, and giving that a "NAME.")

Doctors had names for things like "consumption" long before any microbe or
virus was discovered.

"Why am I losing weight, doc? Â Why am I getting weaker? Â Why do I cough all
the time?"

Doctor: Â "Consumption."

Patient: Â "Oh."

That was what Darwin thought. Â However more recent workers
have concluded that giraffes have long necks so they
can better club other giraffes over the head with them -

&gt; have read the eleven or so REVISIONS have observed that, with each and every
&gt; rewrite his ideas became more, and more and more and more... guess what...
&gt; LAMARCKIAN.

&gt; When Mendel's work got resurrected (roughly a half century after it first
&gt; came out), as a result of its being perceived by an increasing number of
&gt; theorists and critics to offer the missing &quot;mechanism,&quot; that (if I've got it
&gt; right from my reading) was what enabled the New Darwinian Synthesis (also
&gt; called Neo-Darwinism). Â And some historians (if I've got this right)
&gt; indicate that up to then there was a wide split between the preference among
&gt; many leading biologists for the classical Darwinian view of &quot;natural
&gt; selection&quot; and the paleontologists' preference for a more Lamarckian view.
&gt; Putting it very succinctly (hence in risk of distortion by simplistication)
&gt; paleontologists and biologists had a new synthesis which both could see some
&gt; possible sense in.

&gt; Today, if we were to say that *THE Â MECHANISM Â WHEREBY Â NATURAL SELECTION

&gt; turn out to be untenable somewhere downstream from today.

&gt; This old layman has said it before and shall say it again, &quot;Science is NOT

&gt; to it, is Â not &quot;top rate&quot; science.

&gt; The angrier any entrenched advocate gets upon being accused of bias, the
&gt; more this old layman is reminded of the saying among political analysits
&gt; that, &quot;When they say it's not about the money... it's about the money.&quot; Â I

&gt; what I would guess that &quot;top rate&quot; science should be about. Â And the

&gt; What ever happened to &quot;I don't know.. but I'll tell you what I THINK,&quot; and
&gt; without opponents trying to enshrine their &quot;opinion&quot; in an ivory ego temple,
&gt; and put it on a pedestal.

&gt; If it were simple, obvious, and confirmed in minute detail, then there would
&gt; not BE any debate. Â And a many a person would not have to be called &quot;stupid&quot;
&gt; or &quot;intransigent&quot; or some such derogatory nomenclature for not bowing his
&gt; head in abject subjection.

&gt; If someone is going to point to a human and tell me that natural selection
&gt; by way of selfish genes made him smart enough to out-survive other critters,
&gt; then that person should not mind my asking, why the same did not happen to,
&gt; say, opossums. Â I read in a publication for game biologists that the very
&gt; most essential characteristic of Opossum Virginialis' which most accounts
&gt; for its adaptation to multiple geographical areas and invironments is the
&gt; fact that it is too stupid to get into habitat and food source ruts. Â More
&gt; specifically, the article informs that the cerebral cavity of a Virginia
&gt; Opossum, by comparison to other species indicates that it is &quot;playing with
&gt; only about two-thirds of a deck.&quot;

&gt; So what have we here. Â Smart out-survives dumb for humans; but dumb
&gt; out-survives smart for opossums.

&gt; Oh, the rationalizing might go, I'm not looking at the WHOLE picture. Â What
&gt; works for an opossum works for the niche or niches they fill, but does not
&gt; work for the niche or niches humans fill. Â Get the picture. Â If one STARTS
&gt; OUT Â with the presumption that natural selection works because of
&gt; competition, then the way you PROVE that is by coming up with a
&gt; rationalization for why hot is cold and black is white and smart pays when
&gt; it pays and dumb pays when it pays...

&gt; If a scientist speaks of gradualism, and points to many species that have
&gt; changed gradually, and cites that to be a product of mutations, even during
&gt; times when geography, that is fine so far as it goes. Â But let him NOT Â OMIT

I just stated my opinion on the liklihood in the forseeable future of
a nuclear bomb being detonated on a population. Yes, it seems rather
arrogant to state I'm "convinced" this is going to happen. However,
even biologist Guy Hoelzer agreed if "present" trends continue it is a
likely hypothesis this will happen. He is open, however, to the
environment changing and man is an important part of this process. In
other words things could change which would make the liklihood of a
nuclear bomb being detonated on a population less likely.
However, considering the current proliferation outside the traditional
nuclear club of seven countries or so, nuclear smuggling and unsecured
nuclear material both in the U.S. and Russia (in Russia it is worse)
and international terrorist groups...I'm not encouraged.

As one scientist stated we all go extinct and people are more
concerned about their own mortality than that of a massive wipeout. I
think, however, its time for ordinary folks to start discussing the
after effects of a nuclear bomb being detonated. I admit this could
take many scenarios and no one knows what the the destructiveness of
the bomb(s) will be, where they will be detonated or how various
states will react to the event. IMO, it will result from a terrorist
cell. So why not discuss hypothetical scenarios? What would be the
most accessible and likely targets in the U.S.? The U.S. is generally
despised around the world. Even the show "24" on television makes its
drama from such scenarios. If the terrorists don't attack an unsecured
U.S. nuclear facility which already hypothetically has the material to
set off a chain reaction than it seems a port city would be likely
selected.

A full scale nuclear event would really refute Darwin since it would
result in the possible extinction of mankind.
I see in the cards, however, a "limited" nuclear event where most
countries are petrified and "stay out" of the mess. I see the U.S.
retaliating against the "sponsor" state of such a terrorist cell is
successful in detonating a nuclear bomb in the U.S. Besides the
horrible death toll on the targeted populace and the after effects of
the radiation I see another adverse effect on civil and human rights
and the dissolution of the U.S. Constitution. As retired General Tommy
Franks stated (and which he was widely censured for saying so) if
there is another terrorist attack then there will gradually come
Martial Law in the U.S.

But all of this is not related to my original question (which you
really did not answer but are free to email me) how this would effect
the biology and ecology of the earth. We are already in global
warming. Short of a nuclear winter what would be the effects of a
nuclear bomb(s) on the ecology and biosphere? Would it increase global
warming? I would think it would. I would think it would do damage to
the ecology of earth. I've read today's nuclear bombs are much more
deadlier than the ones dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Some of them
also are multiple warheads with biological and chemical weapons.

Genomic instability posited the worse case scenario and no one has
responded. I find it hard to believe no germ cell damage was done to
the Japanese, Marshallese and victims of Cherynobyl. Are germ cells
really that robust? Â Have any experiments been done on animals and is
there a threshold at which radiation levels induce changes in germ
cells?

Didn't you already answer this one yourself? Â It's not random chance,
it's natural selection.

Presumably, among the three toed horses, random chance led to some
being born with 2 toes and some with 4. Â For all we know, there might
have been more born with 4 than with 2. Â But the ones born with fewer
and larger/stronger toes could run faster and so passed on their genes
more often than the ones with more toes.

We sometimes imagine that variation in a species is a big step, but
it isn't always. Â Most of the time it probably isn't at all.

If you look at all of the horses around today, or all of the people,
or all of any population, you'll see a great deal of variation.
Some are large and some are small. Â Some have long hair and
some have short hair. Â Some are brown and some are white.
And so on. Â There is a very large mix of alleles for a very large
number of genes in any population gene pool. Â If conditions
develop in such a way that some particular allele is favored, it
often doesn't require a great act of genetic mutation for
natural selection to have something to select on.

I don't know anything about the evolution of the hoof, but I
wouldn't be surprised if it turned out that, among three toed
horses, some horse was born not with one toe, but with a
little bigger middle toe and slightly smaller outer toes - and
so on. Â Also, of course, a horse might have been born with
a smaller middle toe and bigger outer toes. Â But one of
them won the race to the mare, or out ran the cheetah,
or whatever it was that gave him the advantage.

GENETIC EFFECTS IN GERM CELLS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

National genetic monitoring in Belarus was developed by Prof. Lazyuk
G. and is functioning since 1979. The Belarusan monitoring can be
compared with the monitoring of Eurocat and International
Clearinghouse registers by the list of congenital developmental
malformations of strict control (anencephalia, meningoceles, cleft lip
and/or cleft palate, polydactylia, reduction defect of limbs, atresias
of esophagus and anus, Down's syndrome and, separately, the group of
multiple malformations) and by the method of their record-keeping.
Research by Lazyuk (1996) 27 Â according to the programme of Belarusan
national genetic monitoring has revealed that "The frequency of
Mandatory Registered Congenital Malformations has increased
significantly since 1986 in all the regions of Belarus, being most
pronounced in embryos, foetuses, and neonates from the areas with
137Cs contamination of 15 Ci/Km2 (555 kBq/m2). The observed increase
in the congenital malformation frequency in neonates considerably
exceeds the predictions made by the International Commission on
Radiological Protection" 28 .

As seen from the Table 4 an increase in the number of children with
congenital and hereditary malformations in the so-called clean regions
made up 24%, in the regions with 137Cs contamination density from 1 to
5 Ci/km2 did 30% and in the areas with contamination density of 15 Ci/
km2 and above made up 83%.

takes into consideration the number of pregnancies that were aborted
due to genetic indications (above 1500 pregnancies over the period of
1991-1994), the frequency of embryonal developmental disturbances

1992 to 22.4 in 1994).

Congenital and Hereditary Diseases at the Ministry of Public Health of

Lazyuk G. has compared mean doses, i.e. the sum of the effective
equivalent doses of external and internal irradiation for the
settlements were the parents lived with the frequency of congenital
developmental malformations in their children (Table 6) 27 . No direct
relationship between the frequency of congenital developmental
malformations and the dose taken by one or both parents before fetus
conception was observed. It should be noted, however, that the study
on the function of individual dose distribution for the population in
radiocontaminated areas showed that individual doses can be 5-6 times
as high as the mean dose values 4 .

Cs-137 contamination zone (from: 27 )

Taking into consideration the absence of significant correlation
between the frequency of congenital developmental malformations and
the Chernobyl dose, as well as rise in developmental malformations in
"clean" regions Lazyuk G. supposes the given data, in particular a
great increase in malformations of multifactorial origin, indicate
that the increase in embryonal development disturbances in the
population of Belarus is caused not only and, possibly, not so much by
ionising radiation, as by additional factors. Such additional factors
can be the following: inferior diet, chemical environmental
pollutants, alcoholization of reproductive age population and many
others.

However interpretation of sharp increase in developmental
malformations of strict control after 1986 and annual rise in all
recorded developmental malformations should be quite different, in my
opinion. The following aspects should be taken into account:

The so-called "clean" regions in Belarus are also radiocontaminated.
The myth on clean region greatly affects the researchers.

The forms of dose-effect relationships in the range of low doses of
prolonged chronic irradiation remain uncertain. There is evidence for
the existence of plateau phenomenon on dose curves. Therefore in the
range of low doses a monotonous rise in the frequency of congenital
developmental malformations with the dose increase might not be.

The type of nourishment for the whole population in Belarus is
practically similar though in 1986-1989 the attempts were made to
improve nourishment of people in the most contaminated regions.

The amount of chemical pollutants was considerably reduced due to
crisis in economy and annual rise in embryonal developmental
malformations is still observed.

The above stated, with good reason, makes it possible to regard an
unquestionable fact of a dramatic increase in congenital developmental
malformations as obvious consequence of the Chernobyl irradiation.

Discrepancy between data of Lazyuk 27 Â and those for children whose
parents had suffered from atomic bombardments in Japan seemed to be
caused by different conditions of radiation as a result of the
Chernobyl disaster and atomic explosions.

The joint research work of English, Russian and Belarusan
investigators 29 Â on the frequency of mutations in children whose both
parents constantly lived in the radiocontaminated Mogilev Region of
Belarus since the instant of the catastrophe is of great interest. The
range of area contamination was from 1 to 15 Ci/km2. An accurate dose
taken by the parents was unknown. The 137Cs contamination level of the
area, however, was a satisfactory indicator for moderate collective
radiation dose. The children born in February - September 1994 in 79
families formed the group under examination. Since the whole Belarus
is radiocontaminated, the children from 105 families of the Great
Britain formed the control group. The frequency of mutations in
minisattelite loci of the children from Mogilev Region turned out to
be increased twice, the total mutation number in the more contaminated
regions was 1.5 time as much as in the less contaminated ones. So, the
mutation frequency was shown to be correlated with the caesium
contamination level of the area.

This research work presented statistically significant data of two-
fold increase in the mutation frequency in germ cells of irradiated
parents. It should be noted that it is an unexpectedly high frequency
of mutability for mutations under the influence of radiation. The
value of a double dose for mutations in human germ cells resulting in
serious consequences for progeny health makes up 1 Gy 30 .

What is the dose taken by the people in Mogilev Region over the years
1986-1994? Its accurate value is unknown. However, according to the
assessment made in Belarus 2 Â an individual equivalent dose due to
external and internal irradiation is no less than 5 mSv per year (0.5
rem). An accumulated dose for 9 years achieves about 45 mSv or 4.5
rem. This is a very small dose in comparison with the value of the
double dose for human germ cells equal to 1 Gy.

The authors admit that either the estimates of the dose taken are
rather reduced or low doses of chronic irradiation are much more
effective inductors of mutations than high doses of acute irradiation.
However reduced the estimates of the

Maybe the problem here is that you're having trouble figuring out
where all the variation comes from that natural selection operates
upon.

Bear in mind that _mutation_, i.e., changes in DNA base pairs
during DNA replication, is only one source of genetic variation.
In bacteria it's probably a major source. Â In plants and animals
that use sexual reproduction, it's a minor source.

Humans have 23 chromosomes pairs. Â The selection of which
individual from the father's pair (i.e., from his father or his mother)
and which individual from the mother's pair (from her father or
her mother) is random. Â Thus there are 2^23, or over 8 million
possible variations in chromosome selection in each gamete.

But even that is only part of the story since each chromosome
pair undergoes one or more "crossovers" during meiosis producing
a random mix of DNA from each chromosome of a pair. Â This
introduces even more variation than that introduced by the
random selection of which chromosome goes into the gamete.
These crossovers can occur in the middle of a gene leading
to novel alleles never before seen.

I'm not sure that's what you're questioning, but if it is, you can
see, I think, that natural selection has a great deal of variability
it can work on. Â In the horse case, I don't think we need to
imagine cosmic rays or other genetic damage as the reason
why some horses wind up with a bigger middle toe than others.
I am thinner than my father. Â My son is taller than I am. Â My
daughter is heavier than my wife - and so on and so on. Â Our
children don't look exactly like us or like each other. Â If big
feet or big hands turned out to have serious survival value,
there's plenty of natural variation among humans from which
to select those characters. Â So too, I think, for horses and
their toes.

The bacterial case is different - though even among bacteria
it is now known that sex-like gene transfers occur. Â Bacteria
have a higher rate of mutation than humans because they
do not have the same replication proof-reading mechanisms
that eukaryotes have. Â Also, with such rapid reproduction
(mitosis can be repeated in as little as 20 minutes with some
bacteria under ideal conditions), the number of reproductive
events is many orders of magnitude higher than for horses
or humans, and the corresponding availability of mutations
is higher and the effects of mutation are seen more rapidly.

I have to disagree. Â As to the production of novel genes by recombination,
that rarely happens. Â Mutation is much more common. Â In fact, the number
of point mutations per generation in humans is a couple times larger than
the number of crossings-over.

Furthermore, you are wrong to suggest that the gene shuffling which
takes place among weakly linked genes (those on different chromosomes, say)
provides an important source of variation for NS to work on. Â Variation
is indeed created, and there may even be differential survival and
reproduction of the variants. Â But variants created by recombination
of this sort will inevitably be destroyed by recombination in further
generations - the kind of variation you are talking about is not
_heritable_ variation, and hence has little value for evolution. Â Most
of the 'progress' made by selection gets undone as the linkage
disequilibrium is relaxed. Â On the other hand, mutations continue to
breed true for many generations.

Hmmmmm.

I see your points. Â I've probably been thinking about this
incorrectly. Â However, bear with me while I push this idea a bit
further in order to fully explore it.

There are several kinds of changes that occur from one generation
to the next. Â We'll call "mutations" those changes in which, for
one reason or another, a DNA replication results in an imperfect
copy, perhaps with a single base pair modified from its original
sequence. Â These changes are random, heritable, and introduce
novel alleles when they occur in coding or control portions of
the DNA.

The other changes that I mentioned are changes due to chromosome
recombination and chromosome crossovers. Â They are not caused by
DNA replication errors. Â These changes are certainly random. Â I
think they are heritable (I'll argue for that in a minute),
but it's not clear whether they produce novel alleles, (I'll
discuss that one too.) Â The role they play in evolution may
therefore be very different from the role mutation plays - though
I think it is probably also very important - which is presumably
why sexual recombination seems so universal in higher organisms.

There are also other sources of genetic change that are neither
DNA replication errors nor normal meiosis events which I won't
discuss further here - transposons, ploidy errors, viral
infection and reverse transcription. Â There may be others too.

On the issue of heritability: How can the crossover and
recombination changes not be heritable? Â The results of
crossovers and chromosome recombinations become the genetic
material of the offspring that inherits them. Â He can't pass on
anything else because he doesn't have anything else. Â It will be
the case that half of that genetic material is lost in the next
reproductive event, and new genetic material is received from the
other parent, but anything that wasn't included in the 2nd
generation cannot magically appear in the 3rd, though it might be
reintroduced by another parent.

The issue of novel alleles is much less clear. Â As you point out,
chromosome recombination can't create them. Â But perhaps
crossovers can. Â I'm thinking of two ways that this can be the
case, the first of which seems to me a normal consequence of
crossover and the second an accidental consequence.

The first way is if a crossover occurs in the middle of a gene
coding sequence. Â Conceivably, the two alleles of the gene have
one or more differences on each side of the crossover point. Â For
example, something like this, where the capital letters stand for
sequences and 'x' is the crossover point:

ABCDEFGxHIJKLMNOP
ABCDYFGxHIJKZMNOP

After the crossover we have:

ABCDEFGxHIJKZMNOP
ABCDYFGxHIJKLMNOP

These alleles are novel, aren't they? Â They don't match either
parent.

Is that rare? Â I don't know. Â I think I do know that crossovers
in general are more common than point mutations. Â If I remember
correctly, in eukaryotes (or maybe it's just mammals?) the
uncorrected mutation rate is about 10 to the minus 9. Â That's 3
mutations in 3 billion base pairs that make up a human gamete.
Of course that rate is significant, and it would be even larger
in some situations, like organisms living near sources of
radiation.

To the best of my knowledge however, chromosomal crossovers are
actually much more common. Â Every chromosome requires at least
one in order to complete meiosis, and IIRC the average is around
2.5. Â For humans with 23 chromosomes that gives us an average of
57.5 crossovers per gamete.

Now - how many of those produce anything novel? Â I don't know.
It might be very few. Â Furthermore, we might argue that there
would be none at all if it weren't for the fact that point
mutations create some differences in alleles to get recombined
during crossovers.

There is also a second source of change in crossovers. Â Not all
crossovers occur at the same spot in both chromosomes.
Mismatches occur where one DNA strand winds up longer and the
other shorter. Â Presumably the great majority of crossovers don't
have these errors, and the great majority that do do not produce
viable offspring. Â I don't know the numbers. Â I do know however
that there is considerable evidence of this occurring in the
past and it is apparently common in tumor cells. Â An event like
this might, for example, account for the differences between the
X and Y chromosomes. Â These changes are also heritable. Â However
they are not normal events.

The situation is a little murky here and subject to some
interpretation. Â Perhaps the right perspective is something like
this:

DNA changes provide _all_ of the primary raw material
for natural selection. Â Those changes are of several kinds,
including point mutations and other DNA replication errors,
crossover frame errors, ploidy errors, transposons, viral
infections and reverse transcriptions, and possibly other
sources.

Crossovers during meiosis may provide some secondary material
for change (if I'm right about the crossovers creating novel
alleles.) Â This may be statistically significant, or may not
(I don't know and don't know if anyone does.) Â The results of
these changes are truly novel, however they are "secondary"
in the sense that they require prior "primary" changes to
provide the raw material.

Crossovers and recombinations during meiosis provide much
wider distribution of novel alleles, allowing them to
circulate throughout the population and be combined with
other alleles from different genetic lines in the population.

Does this sound reasonable and accurate?

There are, and one important one is so-called 'illegitimate recombination'
which you describe below as the second source of allele change in
crossing-over. Â Besides allele changes, it can also induce copy-number
variation and other effects that are quite heritable. Â In disdaning

There is some heritability, but only half as much as in the case of
a novel allele. Â There is a 50% chance of passing on a novel allele
to each offspring. Â There is only a 25% chance of passing on a
novel combination of (both of) two alleles on two different chromosomes.
(The chance is somewhere between 25% and 50% if the two alleles are
on the same chromosome).

Since, unless the novel combination imparts an enormous fitness advantage,
the expected number of offspring surviving is only two, Â the combination
is unlikely to be passed on for more than a few generations before it
is broken up again.

&gt; The issue of novel alleles is much less clear. Â As you point out,
&gt; chromosome recombination can't create them. Â But perhaps
&gt; crossovers can. Â I'm thinking of two ways that this can be the
&gt; case, the first of which seems to me a normal consequence of
&gt; crossover and the second an accidental consequence.

&gt; The first way is if a crossover occurs in the middle of a gene
&gt; coding sequence. Â Conceivably, the two alleles of the gene have
&gt; one or more differences on each side of the crossover point. Â For
&gt; example, something like this, where the capital letters stand for
&gt; sequences and 'x' is the crossover point:

&gt; Â  ABCDEFGxHIJKLMNOP
&gt; Â  ABCDYFGxHIJKZMNOP

&gt; After the crossover we have:

&gt; Â  ABCDEFGxHIJKZMNOP
&gt; Â  ABCDYFGxHIJKLMNOP

&gt; These alleles are novel, aren't they? Â They don't match either
&gt; parent.
">

Yes. Â That can happen.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Is that rare? Â I don't know.
">

Yes, it is rare. Â Most crossing-over does not take place inside coding
genes, and even when it does, the odds are that there will be an exact
match on one half-gene or the other.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think I do know that crossovers

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If I remember

&gt; Of course that rate is significant, and it would be even larger
&gt; in some situations, like organisms living near sources of
&gt; radiation.

&gt; To the best of my knowledge however, chromosomal crossovers are
&gt; actually much more common. Â Every chromosome requires at least
&gt; one in order to complete meiosis, and IIRC the average is around
&gt; 2.5. Â For humans with 23 chromosomes that gives us an average of
&gt; 57.5 crossovers per gamete.

My memory says about 35 crossings-over. Â And it is not the case that
each chromosome requires one. Â I suspect that you got your figure

'genome pieces' which independently segregate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now - how many of those produce anything novel? Â I don't know.
&gt; It might be very few. Â Furthermore, we might argue that there
&gt; would be none at all if it weren't for the fact that point
&gt; mutations create some differences in alleles to get recombined
&gt; during crossovers.

&gt; There is also a second source of change in crossovers. Â Not all
&gt; crossovers occur at the same spot in both chromosomes.
&gt; Mismatches occur where one DNA strand winds up longer and the
&gt; other shorter. Â Presumably the great majority of crossovers don't
&gt; have these errors, and the great majority that do do not produce
&gt; viable offspring. Â I don't know the numbers. Â I do know however
&gt; that there is considerable evidence of this occurring in the
&gt; past and it is apparently common in tumor cells. Â An event like
&gt; this might, for example, account for the differences between the
&gt; X and Y chromosomes. Â These changes are also heritable. Â However
&gt; they are not normal events.

&gt; The situation is a little murky here and subject to some
&gt; interpretation. Â Perhaps the right perspective is something like
&gt; this:

&gt; Â  Â  DNA changes provide _all_ of the primary raw material
&gt; Â  Â  for natural selection. Â Those changes are of several kinds,
&gt; Â  Â  including point mutations and other DNA replication errors,
&gt; Â  Â  crossover frame errors, ploidy errors, transposons, viral
&gt; Â  Â  infections and reverse transcriptions, and possibly other
&gt; Â  Â  sources.

&gt; Â  Â  Crossovers during meiosis may provide some secondary material
&gt; Â  Â  for change (if I'm right about the crossovers creating novel
&gt; Â  Â  alleles.) Â This may be statistically significant, or may not
&gt; Â  Â  (I don't know and don't know if anyone does.) Â The results of
&gt; Â  Â  these changes are truly novel, however they are &quot;secondary&quot;
&gt; Â  Â  in the sense that they require prior &quot;primary&quot; changes to
&gt; Â  Â  provide the raw material.

&gt; Â  Â  Crossovers and recombinations during meiosis provide much
&gt; Â  Â  wider distribution of novel alleles, allowing them to
&gt; Â  Â  circulate throughout the population and be combined with
&gt; Â  Â  other alleles from different genetic lines in the population.

&gt; Does this sound reasonable and accurate?

Yes.

&gt;&gt; possible variations in chromosome selection in each gamete.

&gt;&gt; But even that is only part of the story since each chromosome

&gt;&gt; These crossovers can occur in the middle of a gene leading

Whoah. Â Just because variants generated by recombination are
sometimes transient in nature, that doesn't mean they have
'little value for evolution'. Â Those variants act as an important
defense against parasites. Â The ability to resist parasites is an
extremely valuable characteristic.

As for the idea that sexually created combinations
cannot persist because they will inevitably be destroyed by
further recombination - that seems mistaken. Â Such variation
most certainly /can/ be inherited.

Offspring typically have a 25% chance of inheriting
two unlinked genes from one of their parents. Â For such
a combination to monopolise the next generation, about
75% of offspring would need to die. Â For it to merely
persist - by being present in half the offspring - only

That would be a lot of death for a population of modern
humans - but it's peanuts for many fish, spiders, plants,
etc, where often &gt; 99% of offspring typically don't make it.

Also, unlinked genes are not the only type of variation
created by recombination. Â Linkage cannot simply be ignored.
Genes are often within linkage reach of dozens of other genes.
These have a substantially reduced chance of being divided again
by recombination straight away. Â That's a lot of heritable
sexually-created combinations for you right there.

In case it helps:

"Patterns of Meiotic Recombination in Human Fetal Oocytes"
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=379134

....gives averages of 70 crossovers in the female and 50 in the male
for a total of 120 crossovers per individual per generation.

"Estimate of the Mutation Rate per Nucleotide in Humans"

http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/156/1/297

....gives 175 mutations per generation.

To address the original: "In fact, the number of point mutations
per generation in humans is a couple times larger than the
number of crossings-over." - table 4 in that paper gives
estimates of the mutation rate for different classes of
mutation. Â Around 90% appear to be SNPs.
