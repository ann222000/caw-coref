If I can be blunt, I think the biggest problem with Map Builder isn't
functionality... it's lack of documentation. Lots of us are asking
some fairly basic questions here, yet I'm not seeing many useful
answers.

Maybe a more thorough FAQ would be helpful, or even a wiki. Andrew
could start it off, and as the rest of us find ways to either resolve
problems or embellish the service, we could add notes to the wiki.

Just a thought.

Hello Charles,

wiki is a great idea. I'll install wiki over the weekend.
