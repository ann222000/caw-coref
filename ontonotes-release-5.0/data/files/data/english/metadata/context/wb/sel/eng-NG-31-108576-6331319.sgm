The Battle For Your Mind

Persuasion &amp; Brainwashing Techniques
Being Used On The Public Today

By Dick Sutphen

The following is an expanded version of a talk Dick Sutphen delivered
at the World Congress of Professional Hypnotists Convention in Las
Vegas, Nevada. Although the paper carries a 1984 copyright to protect
the contents from unlawful duplication for sale, Dick invites
individuals to make copies and give them to friends or anyone in a
position to communicate this information. Since the paper was
released, it has been distributed to millions and is currently
available on dozens of Websites. As a result of this awareness, Dick
has been contacted by law enforcement officers, the BBC and
investigative reporters. On numerous occasions, the information has
helped to bring public attention to the misuse of conversion tactics.

Some government agencies don't want this information generally known,
for the techniques are used in armed forces basic training. Some
Christian Fundamentalists, cults, and human-potential trainings would
also prefer that the public remain unaware of how they are recruiting
new members.

I'm going to talk about conversion, which is a nice word for
brainwashing. Everything I'll share only exposes the surface of the
problem. I don't know how the misuse of these techniques can be
stopped other than through public awareness. It isn't possible to
legislate against what often cannot be detected; and if those who
legislate are using these techniques, there is little hope of
affecting laws to govern usage.

In talking about mind manipulation, I am talking about my own
business. I know it, and I know how effective it can be. I produce
hypnosis and subliminal tapes and, in some of my seminars, I use
conversion tactics to assist participants to become independent and
self-sufficient. But, any time I use these techniques, I point out
that I am using them, and those attending have a choice to participate
or not. They're also aware of the desired result of participation.

So, to begin, I want to share a basic fact about brainwashing: IN THE
ENTIRE HISTORY OF MAN, NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN BRAINWASHED AND REALIZED,
OR BELIEVED, THAT HE HAD BEEN BRAINWASHED. Those who have been
brainwashed will usually passionately defend their manipulators,
claiming they have simply been "shown the light" ... or have been
transformed in miraculous ways.

The Birth of Conversion

Any study of brainwashing has to begin with a study of Christian
revivalism in eighteenth century America. Apparently, Jonathan Edwards
accidentally discovered the techniques during a religious crusade in
1735 in Northampton, Massachusetts. By inducing guilt and acute
apprehension and by increasing the tension, the sinners attending his
revival meetings would break down and completely submit. Technically,
what Edwards was doing was creating conditions that wipe the brain
slate clean so that the mind accepts new programming. He would tell
those attending, "You're a sinner! You're destined for hell!"

As a result, one person committed suicide and another attempted
suicide. The neighbors of the suicidal converts related that they,
too, were affected so deeply that, although they had found "eternal
salvation," they were obsessed with a diabolical temptation to end
their own lives.

Once a preacher, cult leader, manipulator or authority figure creates
the brain phrase to wipe the brain-slate clean, his subjects are open
to new programming. New input, in the form of suggestions, can be
substituted for their previous ideas. Because Edwards didn't turn his
message positive until the end of the revival, many accepted the
negative suggestions and acted, or desired to act, upon them.

Charles J. Finney was another Christian revivalist who used the same
techniques four years later in mass religious conversions in New York.
The techniques are still being used today by Christian revivalists,
cults, human-potential training, some business rallies and the U.S.
armed services.

Let me point out here that I don't think most revivalist preachers
realize or know they are using brainwashing techniques. Edwards simply
stumbled upon a technique that worked, and others copied it and have
continued to copy it for over two hundred years. And the more
sophisticated our knowledge and technology become, the more effective
the conversion. I feel strongly that this is one of the major reasons
for the increasing rise in Christian fundamentalism, especially the
televised variety, while most of the orthodox religions are declining.

The 3 Brain Phases

The Christians may have been the first to successfully formulate
brainwashing, but we have to look to Pavlov, the Russian scientist,
for a technical explanation. In the early 1900s, his work with animals
opened the door to further investigations with humans. After the
revolution in Russia, Lenin was quick to see the potential of applying
Pavlov's research to his own ends.

Three distinct and progressive states of transmarginal inhibition were
identified by Pavlov. The first is the Equivalent phase, in which the
brain gives the same response to both strong and weak stimuli. Second
is the Paradoxical phase, in which the brain responds more actively to
weak stimuli than to strong. Third is the Ultra-Paradoxical phase, in
which conditioned responses and behavior patterns turn from positive
to negative or from negative to positive.

With the progressions through each phase, the degree of conversion
becomes more effective and complete. The ways to achieve conversion
are many and varied, but the usual first step in religious or
political brainwashing is to work on the emotions of an individual or
group until they reach an abnormal level of anger, fear, excitement or
nervous tension.

The progressive result of this mental condition is to impair judgment
and increase suggestibility. The more this condition can be maintained
or intensified, the more it compounds. Once catharsis or the first
brain phase is reached, the complete mental takeover becomes easier.
Existing mental programming can be replaced with new patterns of
thinking and behavior.

Other often-used physiological weapons to modify normal brain
functions are fasting, radical or high sugar diets, physical
discomforts, regulation of breathing, mantra chanting in meditation,
the disclosure of awesome mysteries, special lighting and sound
effects, programmed response to incense, or intoxicating drugs.

The same results can be obtained in contemporary psychiatric treatment
by electric shock treatments and even by purposely lowering a
patient's blood sugar level with insulin injections.

Before I talk about exactly how some of the techniques are applied, I
want to point out that hypnosis and conversion tactics are two
distinctly different things -- and that conversion techniques are far
more powerful. However, the two are often mixed ... with powerful
results.

How Revivalist Preachers Work

If you'd like to see a revivalist preacher at work, there are probably
several in your city. Go to the church or tent early and sit in the
rear, about three-quarters of the way back. Most likely repetitive
music will be played while the people come in for the service. A
repetitive beat, ideally ranging from 45 to 72 beats per minute (a
rhythm close to the beat of a human heart), is very hypnotic and can
generate an eyes-open altered state of consciousness in a high
percentage of people. And, once you are in an Alpha state, you are at
least 25 times as suggestible as you would be in full Beta
consciousness. The music is probably the same for every service, or
incorporates the same beat, and many of the people will go into an
altered state almost immediately upon entering the sanctuary.
Subconsciously, they recall their state of mind from previous services
and respond according to the post-hypnotic programming.

Watch the people waiting for the service to begin. Many will exhibit
external signs of trance -- body relaxation and slightly dilated eyes.
Often, they begin swaying back and forth with their hands in the air
while sitting in their chairs. Next, the assistant pastor will come
out. He usually speaks with a "voice roll".

Voice Roll Technique

A "voice roll" is a patterned, paced style used by hypnotists when
inducing a trance. It is also used by many lawyers  (several of the
most famous are highly trained hypnotists), when they desire to
entrench a point firmly in the minds of the jurors. A voice roll can
sound as if the speaker were talking to the beat of a metronome, or it
may sound as though he were emphasizing every word in a

Quintal, you amaze me.  I'll have to retract my claim that everything
you post is bullshit.  This one was really interesting.  If all your
articles were like this one, I'd have nothing to say against you.
