I have an old cut-crystal bowl which was evidently used to for
flowers. It has a film of mineral deposits inside the upper half from
water evaporation. Does anyone know the best way to get rid of this film,
without using anything which would scratch or damage the crystal? I've
tried ammonia.

"/> You can try soaking it in vinegar. I think there is some kind of
commercial product for this, but can't remember what it is.

"/> Ammonia is a general cleaner and degreaser - it'll do nothing
for mineral deposits (which are usually lime.)
Try these (in sequence):
1 - Buy a bottle of the &quot;concentrated&quot; vinegar in the grocery
store and pour it in full-strength. (Of course, if this bowl
is large, you'll need more than one.) Let it soak (cover
the bowl with plastic to avoid evaporation) for two or
three days. By then, the deposits should either have
melted away, or have been loosened.

2 - Lime-Away (even stronger.) Read the label directions
very carefully.

If neither of those work, you'll need to consult a glass expert
to determine if the inside of the bowl should be repolished
(which will devalue it, but at that point, it's not a problem.)

"/> Hi Kris ...... would you care to expand on this? I have a somewhat
limited knowledge on cut lead glass, limited to a particular period
and country (18thc and early 19thc Irish) In that field a 'bloomed'
example would be a defective example and unless 'rare' would be hard
to sell, now reploshing such a piece wouldn't devalue it by any more
than, it has already been devalued, but may in fact make it easier to
sell. Is this not the case with all glass? And how would one determine
the inside of a 'bloomed' example was reploished? is there some
tell-tale sign one can look for?

"/>  That was my point with saying &quot;at that point, it's not a problem.&quot;
Obviously, a piece that has encrusted mineral deposits is not
very salable.
&quot;Bloom&quot;, however, means something very different to me, being
that the glass has absorbed the minerals and is now cloudy.

"/> Ronnie, my friend is a collector of cut glass, and she once showed
me a piece that she'd purchased. She had been seeking a mate to
a vase, so that she could display the pair on her fireplace mantle.

She handed me one and said &quot;Do you see anything odd?&quot;
Not being a fan of such (and frankly, having limited knowledge),
I looked carefully and told her I thought it was a beautiful piece.
She then handed me the other. It was much shinier inside, and
looked a bit more &quot;clear&quot; when you held both of them up to the
light.
What she told me is that she'd purchased it at a very good price
at an antique show, and the dealer told her that it was priced
low because it had been repolished. (My friend is very picky,
knew the dealer well, was a good customer, and the dealer was
always honest with her.) The piece, on its own, looked fabulous.
When she took it home, she could see the differences.

She was happy with her purchase, as where she displayed the
pair, you could not tell the difference. You could, however,
tell the difference when you held both up to the light together.
