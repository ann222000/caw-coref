Help with lenses choice - ultra wide to 70mm for 30D?

Up to now, I have been using point and shoot camera Olympus C3030Z
which has served me faithfully for close to 6 years. It was a great
camera for its time but now I feel the time has come to step up to a
DSLR camera and bring my hobby to the next level. I had a chance to
use 30D for 2 months and I am totally hooked! :)

Here is the equipment I plan to purchase so far:
Canon EOS 30D
Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8 IS L
Canon EF 1.4X II Extender
Canon Speedlite 580EX Flash
SanDisk 8 GB Extreme III CompactFlash Card

The problem is that I am not sure what would be the best choice for
wide and mid range lenses. Here are some of the lenses I have
considered and I need help with:

Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM Standard Zoom
Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM

Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM
Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L USM

Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM

The type of photography I really enjoy is landscapes, indoor/outdoor
sports, parties, weddings (just as a backup of the backup
photographer :)). I would like to try portrait and macro photography
as well. As a matter of fact I will be going on a trip to a mountain
region early summer where I plan to shoot indoor/outdoor architecture
and landscape so the wide/ultra wide lenses will be a must.

Based on your experience, which combination of lenses do you think
would be a better choice for the range of ultra wide to 70mm?

I would really appreciate your help!

Regards,
Dimitar

Me personally, I would go for the following lenses:

24mm 1.4L
50mm 1.4 (or 50mm 1.2L if your budget allows and you prefer 'L' lenses)
10-22mm EFS

This combination matched with your 70-200 2.8LIS/1.4 converter is fantastic!

The suggestion to buy the $1600.00  50 f1.2 is not the best advice, IMHO.
Nobody this new to DSLRs should start with such a lens.  It's difficult to
master even in the hands of...a master.  Most newbies have little use for
such a large aperture lens in this range, and are usually
confused/frustrated with DOF that can measure barely in mm.

I think the vast majority of people will be happiest with a high quality
zoom.  To keep things reasonable, he'd do well with a super wide (10-22,
16-35, or 17-40), and a walkabout lens like the 28-135 IS.  If money isn't a
problem, then switch out the 28-135 for the 24-105 f4 IS L, or the 24-70 2.8
L.

Completely agree with recommendation of the 7-=200, though it's expensive.
With my cropped sensor 10D (before my FF 5D), this was a favorite, and
always in my bag.  With full frame, I still love it, but I'm looking for
longer again.

Regarding wides and landscape, remember that stitching is fairly easy these
days, and can offer you wider and more detailed prints than ANY
ultra-wide...so you have options for lanscapes.
For me, I was very happy with the following always-carry kit using a similar
DSLR:

16-35 2.8 L
24-70 2.8 L (replaced the 28-135 which I happily used for years)
24-105 f4 IS L (now my main walking lens)
70-200 2.8 IS L (a no-brainer in this range for anyone who can afford it and
carry its weight)
1.4x
580EX flash

For macro:
Canon 100mm 2.8 (maybe Canon's sharpest lens...easily performs like L lenses
optically, and a bargain for the quality you get)

Decent super-zoom:
100-400 IS L (not as sharp as fixed L 400mm, but beats the non-L zooms)

My 2 cents...  OOMV...

&gt;&gt; Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L USM

&gt; Don't waste your time with the 16-35, as it's a dog that has way too much
&gt; light falloff in the corners.  The jury is still out on the upcoming
&gt; 16-35/2.8L II that supposed to address all these shortcomings.  If you
&gt; can't
&gt; wait for this lens I would suggest you get a 17-38/2.8 Nikkor and an
&gt; adapter
&gt; for maximum image quality.

&gt;&gt; Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM

&gt; Some will recommend you get the 50/1.2, but this lens is way overpriced
&gt; for
&gt; the performance and mediocre bokeh.  The only choice here is the 58mm
&gt; f/1.2
&gt; Noct Nikkor.
">

What if he wants a lens that actually autofocuses?  And what if he wants a
lens that is sharp in the center at wide open, rather than a little soft in
the center unless you stop down?  Not the best advice you've given,
lately...
OTOH, the advice to not get the 50 f2.2 is tempered by the unwarranted
advice to get an out of production fast lens that neither autofocuses nor
outperforms the Canon version.
