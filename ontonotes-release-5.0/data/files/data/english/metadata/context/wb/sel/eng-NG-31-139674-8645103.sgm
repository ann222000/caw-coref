Playing in a small town club in New Zealand.
Duplicate, 7 tables.  Semi-casual, mixed grades, playing director.

You are drawing trumps, play a last round to draw the final
outstanding trump, and it doesn't appear !
Do you prompt your opponents ?  Or wait and claim the possible penalty
trick.
Does it matter if they never make the spare trump anyway ?
Does it make a difference to you if the opponents are beginners, or
aged ?

TIA

I'd prompt them, regardless of their experience or skill, because I'd
feel a little slimy winning an extra trick that way.

What would you do if you noticed that an opponent had dropped a card
on the floor? Wait to see if it results in a revoke?

In an important game, I proceed in tempo and gain whatever revoke penalty
is determined by the rules.  The revoke is an error by my opponents akin to
bidding a slam off two aces.  I take my two aces without giving them the
chance to change their minds; same with the revoke.

In a non-important game, I prompt: beginners, aged or in-between.

In the long run I think it is best just to apply the rules and get everybody
to get used to the fact they have to follow them.  If somebody starts
waiving things for beginners they get used to it and then get upset when
somebody else acts correctly to their detriment.

Note that if you do decide here to tell him he revoked and it is corrected
then he has an exposed card and you are not allowed to waive the penalty for
that (law 72A3).

There was a situation in a recent Bermuda Bowl final when Bob Hamman tried
to ignore an Italian infraction early in the match that cost an overtrick
(ie probably 1 IMP) but the director refused to let him do it and forced the
players to record the result with the penalty applied.

Well, if I *didn't* miscount, either way it's going to be a director
call.  I'm willing to overlook some minor irregularities with a beginner,
but a penalty card is too big a deal.  So no.

Mistakes are part of the game and some, if not most, mistakes will cost.
Surely nobody even in a casual game will score a contract made when declarer
miscounted the hand and went down ... :)  Then why should revoking be any
different than, say, miscounting the hand as declarer?

The trouble with prompting is that there will be a penalty card to deal with
and TD needed at table anyway - unless this game is so casual that everybody
makes their own rulings.

I'm with Tim,  I'd ask the opponents to check their cards.  I'll let

Hideous Hog would quickly announce, &quot;Just checking for lurkers.&quot;
Then he'd lead another trump, and if still doesn't appear, prompt
each opponent.  No reason to lose his edge by letting an opponent
score that trump later.

I want to emphasize that a player who decides to collect the revoke
penalty is beyond reproach for his ethics ('personal' or otherwise)
and sportsmanship and deserves no criticism regardless of your
prejudices.  The only potential for poor sportsmanship here is a
revoker who fails &quot;to pay any penalty graciously.&quot;

This is a matter of taste, perhaps style.  There is no problem of
ethics or sportsmanship in making either decision.

Law 44C: &quot;In playing to a trick, each player must follow suit if
possible. This obligation takes precedence over all other requirements
of these Laws.&quot;

Every novice, every casual player, every nonagenarian player, and
especially every duplicate player knows to follow suit.

So there is nothing illegal or unethical about not asking.  That said,
Law 61B allows declarer to ask defenders if they have revoked.  So
asking is permitted, as is not asking.

Do what you feel comfortable with.  You clearly don't describe this as
an important game; if you are feeling charitable then go ahead and
ask.  If you are feeling competitive then don't.  Either way you
should do so with a clear conscience.

Once, playing a club game with an excellent player but infrequent
partner,  a LOL novice revoked.  My partner let her retract the revoke
after it was established; the TD was not called.  I probably would not
have done that myself, but I said nothing to countermand my partner's
actions.  We got a below average for the board; the revoke penalty
would have given us a near top.  C'est la vie.

Yes, but usually HH is playing the hand and RR, having mis-seen the
card that was led, thought he was winning the trick.  His partner, the
Emeritus Professor of Bio-Sophistry, sees HH's puzzled look and says
&quot;No trumps, partner?&quot;  HH tries to tell RR to pick up the penalty
card, which is a card he would never have played to the next trick,
and is of course a blocking card which, when discarded, creates the
only possible holding by which the hand can be defeated.  But the
Secretary Bird will no more accept the waiver of a penalty than he
would waive one himself, and so the contract is down one.  Score 100
for the Rabbit's Guardian Angel.

On the other hand, a novice who understands that playing a game is about
following the rules might well have been insulted by being patronised in
this way.

The most basic rule of trick-taking games is that you have to follow
suit if you can. Why do some people have a problem with applying a
penalty when people break that rule?

I agree with all of those who have said that this is a matter of
personal preference and that neither ethics nor sportsmanship requires
a particular decision either way.

I sometimes play in a beginner / intermediate game that has the
specific purpose of encouraging new players to take up duplicate.  In
that game, when one of the new players revokes and I know it from my
count of the suit, I just tell them they have to follow suit, let them
pick up the wrongly played card, and continue.  I would do the same
for other obvious beginners in a casual club game.

In pretty much all other contexts, I would remain silent, lead to the
next trick, and accept the advantage of my opponent's error.

One way of handling this situation: feign ignorance of the laws.
Suggest you don't know what to do now, so it would be best to call the
director to straighten things out.  Of course, the TD will enforce the
revoke penalties,  but you are off the hook for appearing to be a
stickler for the rules.

&quot;Ignorance of the law is no excuse&quot;, but what about faking it?

Almost true.  But there are some exceptions: see www.pagat.com/spoil5/25.html
, www.davidparlett.co.uk/histocs/maw.html , www.pagat.com/karnoeff/kaiserja.html
for examples.  Also www.pagat.com/put , which describes some trick-
taking games in which the suits are irrelevant.

An empathetic and kind opponent can achieve the same calm down effect with
other means also.   If he is THAT  flustered and mortified, and needs
calming down, I believe he could become MORE flustered by the preferential
treatment and patronizing.  He might get guilty feelings adding to his
distress, from  &quot;getting away with it&quot; when everyone else gets a penalty for
revoking.  Never know, good intentions can backfire.

While I see nothing wrong with the attitude Steve expresses here, in my
experience allowing the revoke to stand may very well lead to a net loss
simply because, if the opponents use the remaining trump to take the lead
after I've used up my entries, they are quite likely to gain more than
two tricks from the play -- and most directors are in too much of a hurry
to even look at the question of awarding proper restitution, so at best
I'd probably only be awarded an average-plus on the hand.

So I prefer to avoid this possibility by prompting for the opponent to
correct his revoke.

You either need to play in games with better directors, or provide them
with the reason that they need to award a greater than 2 trick penalty when
you call them at the end.

Indeed. Also, a table result will presumably be obtained - in which
case &quot;average plus&quot; is an illegal adjustment.

I am sorry for you for the TDs you apparently have to suffer.  Most
TDs around the world try to do their job and would not give an illegal
Average Plus because it is easier than doing their job.

If you are worried about that and fear you won't get a proper TD
ruling, then indeed ask for the revoke to be corrected, and try to
make something useful out of the penalty card.  I might do that anyway
if I thought the penalty card could be more valuable than the penalty.

As David says, competent TDs will make sure you score no worse than
you would have if no revoke had occurred.

I actually have a lot of sympathy for you, though.  One of my earliest
experiences as a bridge player was being cut off from an entryless
long suit in dummy by an opponent's revoke.  (He had Jxx and &quot;created
a stopper&quot; by revoking.)  That cost me 3 or 4 tricks, and the two the
TD gave back were not enough.  I actually knew at the time that this
was a wrong ruling, but the TD was never going to change her ruling in
favor of a kid (as I was then) and against a regular customer.  Now
that I'm a cynical old man, I am fairly sure the revoke was
intentional.  I still don't know whether the TD was deliberately
favoring the regular or merely incompetent, though I'm inclined to
suspect the latter.  In those days, the main skill needed to be a
director was fast and accurate matchpointing and adding.

That incident was long ago, and all other parties involved are dead
now, but as you can tell, it made quite an impression on me.

Yeah, might not want to go into such detail, there, Steve.  While I
concede that last sentence should deter future bad rulings of the same
sort, there's no statute of limitations on that particular fix of a
director ruling/possibly intentional revoke.
