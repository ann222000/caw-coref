See
" http://www.tundrasolutions.com/forums/generalinfo/recalls/tsbs/el0110... "

It's for the 1999/2000, as it was published in 2000, but it shouldn't
have changed, as 2001 is the same generation of Camry (Camry changes
every model year ending in 7 and 2) I don't think that the first two
years of this generation (1997-98), which is why they are not included
in that TSB, though I could be wrong about this. I know that the
procedure for my 2001 4 Runner is the same as that page lists for the
the 2000 4 Runner.

No debate, but it's worthwhile to point out there are significant
negatives of DRLs, and I don't blame you for wanting to disable them.

IMVAIO, debates of DRLs are ON-TOPIC, since Toyota has seen fit to
include them on their vehicles. I would not have purchased my 4 Runner
had I not been sure that there was a way to disable the DRLs.

I think that the better way to disable them, rather than removing the
pin from the connector is to cut the wire and solder/crimp on some
bullet connectors or a switch, i.e.
" http://www.allelectronics.com/cgi-bin/item/PB-21/700325/SPST_PUSHBUTT... "

This way you can easily restore the DRLs if you ever sell it to someone
that wants them back.

You are a fucking asshole. There are NOT valid reasons for disabling DRL's
aside from a temporary device allowing disabling for short period of time,
e.g. when entering a military base or a ferry or going through customs.

Indeed it is. There is no scientific basis for it, at least in the U.S..
Even the NHTSA found no benefit, except to pedestrians. There are enough

That was a tad harsh. I agree completely, but I think you were a bit over
the top. Lights ON is always safer for everyone in every situation at any
time. Period.

On a two-lane road, oncoming cars can easily notice that your car is going
the same direction as it passes another car, or going in the opposite
direction and heading straight for you. This tidbit of knowledge tells you
that you might have to alter your behavior to accomodate the other driver.

Pedestrians have a visual clue that the approaching cars are there -- but
you seem to accept the notion that DRLs are good for pedestrians so I don't
need to dwell on that subject.

DRLs provide the EXACT same safety feature set to other drivers as the
center-rear-brake-light. They alert other drivers of changing conditions.
Obviously the conditions are not the same, but the idea of alerting others
of conditions is the same.

I'll accept an argument that says DRLs are not very useful in each and every
situation that a driver might encounter, but they are NEVER a problem.
Having lights on for safety has long been a behavior of big rig trucks. One
never knows when a "safety situation" might arise, that is why lights should
be switched on when the vehicle starts.

Thanks for being rude, it gave me a chance to vent ...

We agree completely, except the rude part.

I've never seen specific instructions for the 9th generation Corollas
(2003-2007), but someone did mention that Toyota uses the same control
system as in the Matrix/Vibe. Cutting wire 12 on the harness going to
the DRL module is what disables the DRLs on the Matrix/Vibe. It depends
how confident you are about your ability to put things back together if
it's not the correct wire. See
" http://forums.genvibe.com/zerothread?id=1188&amp;page=4 ".

Most Toyota dealers will do this work for you, either for free, or for a
very nominal charge. My brother-in-law, who is an independent mechanic,
goes to Toyota classes at the local college (Skyline College in San
Bruno, CA) which has a partnership with the Toyota Technical Education
Network, and he mentioned that the Toyota mechanics in the classes on
electrical systems stated that disabling DRLs is a daily occurrence in
Toyota Service departments. Many new buyers demand that the DRLs be
disabled as a condition of the sale, and others return to have them
disabled due to the inherent problems with DRLs.

Besides all the proven hazards of DRLs, my neighbor, who is cop in the
next city over, stated that ever since DRLs became wore widely used, the
number of fix-it tickets for burned out headlights has skyrocketed. DRLs
significantly reduce the life of headlights. The worst DRL systems are
those used by Saturn, and now by Honda, that use the high beam headlight
filaments, at reduced brightness, for the DRLs. Despite the reduced
brightness, they still shine directly into oncoming motorists eyes. This
is the situation that the NHTSA reported on.

The whole DRL mess is something that the government needs to get
involved in, and set some standards.

1. DRLs should be a separate set of lights to prevent premature failure
of headlings.

2. DRLs should have limits on intensity, as proposed by the NHTSA.

3. There should be a method of turning off the DRLs for situations where
their use is unacceptable, or illegal.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's a bunch of damn foolishness.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Indeed it is. There is no scientific basis for it, at least in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; U.S.. Even the NHTSA found no benefit, except to pedestrians. There are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enough

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, then FUCK the tens of millions of pedestrians. Who cares about
&gt;&gt;&gt; them. Sarcasm switch now off. Any one with at least a NORMAL IQ realizes
&gt;&gt;&gt; that Lights ON is more safe for EVERYONE than Lights OFF. Get a FUCKING
&gt;&gt;&gt; brain.

&gt;&gt; That was a tad harsh. I agree completely, but I think you were a bit over
&gt;&gt; the top. Lights ON is always safer for everyone in every situation at any
&gt;&gt; time. Period.

&gt;&gt; On a two-lane road, oncoming cars can easily notice that your car is
&gt;&gt; going the same direction as it passes another car, or going in the
&gt;&gt; opposite direction and heading straight for you. This tidbit of knowledge
&gt;&gt; tells you that you might have to alter your behavior to accomodate the
&gt;&gt; other driver.

&gt;&gt; Pedestrians have a visual clue that the approaching cars are there -- but
&gt;&gt; you seem to accept the notion that DRLs are good for pedestrians so I
&gt;&gt; don't need to dwell on that subject.

&gt;&gt; DRLs provide the EXACT same safety feature set to other drivers as the
&gt;&gt; center-rear-brake-light. They alert other drivers of changing conditions.
&gt;&gt; Obviously the conditions are not the same, but the idea of alerting
&gt;&gt; others of conditions is the same.

&gt;&gt; I'll accept an argument that says DRLs are not very useful in each and
&gt;&gt; every situation that a driver might encounter, but they are NEVER a
&gt;&gt; problem. Having lights on for safety has long been a behavior of big rig
&gt;&gt; trucks. One never knows when a &quot;safety situation&quot; might arise, that is
&gt;&gt; why lights should be switched on when the vehicle starts.

&gt;&gt; Thanks for being rude, it gave me a chance to vent ...

&gt;&gt; We agree completely, except the rude part.

&gt; The imbeciles who dis DRL's have such thick skulls that rudeness IS
&gt; necessary to penetrate their stupidity.

Never mind. I was confused ... (again)

&gt; Myself, I just wish there was an override switch, so you can turn
&gt; the stupid lights off by hand to signal truckers at night.

You lose key signaling methods with DRLs. It would not be difficult to
design a system that got around those problems.

Flashing your headlights is
a) the accepted signal to a trucker that it is safe to change lanes
b) a signal to alert drivers that have forgotten to turn on their headlights
c) a signal at a 4-way stop or in a parking lot to let the other driver
go first
d) a signal to other vehicles that you are traveling with that you need
to stop.

&gt;   The basic idea behind DRL's is sound, it's the "Force it on you"
&gt; attitude that bugs me.

It's not just the forcing, it's that if they insist on forcing it, then
they should also be setting standards for the design, so that the
negatives can be mitigated, and so that the system can be over-ridden
when necessary.

It would not be difficult to design a DRL system that would overcome all
the negatives of the present systems, but it requires more than just a
relay.  Unless all manufacturers are forced to implement a system with
specific features, intensity, aiming, etc., it's not going to happen, as
such a system would actually cost $20-30 to implement.

At least the Toyota Camry system automatically turns on the real
headlights when it gets dark. One of the biggest problems with DRLs is
people that don't turn on their headlights when it gets dark, because
they think that they are already on. This is especially bad when the DRL
system doesn't turn on the tail lights as well as the headlights.

If they really wanted to get fancy, they could link the DRLs to a
navigation system, and turn them off on freeways where they are not
necessary, and have them on when driving on high speed rural roads (the
same places where they now advise you to turn on your lights for safety).

Unfortunately, there are a lot of brainwashed people out there, that
have forgotten how to think critically. You get statements like "Lights
ON is always safer for everyone in every situation at any time. Period."
And "they are NEVER a problem." Does he really believe this, or is he
just trolling? It's hard to tell. Neither of those statements are true,
but it's clear that some people don't understand that there are pros and
cons with DRLs.

I'm in Canada where DRLs are required to be working when the dealer
delivers the car.  Where you would flash your headlights on and off, I
achieve the same effect by flashing my high beams.  This seems to be
effective, as trucks always thank me by turning their taillights off
briefly.

I drive in Germany too, and most people are using DRLs there even though
it's not the law yet. (but soon will be)  The US has very odd rules wrt
headlight design and DRLs.  For example, I think motorcycles are
required to have a DRL - why not cars too?

There is one situation where I wish I could have turned off my "always
on' DRL's---driving through a neighborhood light display at Christmas
where they had up signs requesting that lights be turned off. I had to
turn off the engine and do the parking brake trick to turn off my DRL's.

A switch would have been nice.
