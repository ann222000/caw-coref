Back in the office
and thought I would just share a few words on our trip this weekend
while it's still fresh in my mind.  After 3 days in Gauteng helping
Brendon do a road trip promoting Maxpaddle &lt; http://www.maxpaddle.com/ &gt; ,
we got to Parys.  We were signed up with Hugh for a beginners course.
Both Brendon and I have paddle &quot;skills&quot; in the surf and Bendons done the
Fish, Dusi etc.  I had never paddled a river and had learnt what I knew
from a textbook and by trial and error.  We checked in at WWT, got
directions to Gatsien and soon I was standing on the riverside ready to
slip in.  The scenery was beautiful, my heart was racing and it was an
honour to have the Vaal baptize me into whitewater kayaking and soon
Gatsien would bliksem me too.  One of the local guys offered to wait for
us and show us down to the wave.  While on the topic of locals I must
say thanks to all the people we met and paddled with.  Your hospitality
was amazing, thank you.

30 cumecs is tame but if you are nervous and a virgin paddler then you
are in for a hammering.  I got bliksemmed a few times, had a swim but
soon found some sort of way around the wave and had some fun.  It was
quiet at the hole just the three of us then just the two of us then
three again into the dark.  There was a 40 knot wind blowing up the
river at times, enough to rip the paddle right out your hands.  I had an
interesting time at the hole and now was officially wet behind the ears
as far as whitewater kayaking goes and looked forward to the course.  We
were once again guided out the river by a caring local paddler who had
also informed us that Hugh was going to give us a hard time about our
bad rolling technique.

We ended up in a swimming pool the next day on the rivers edge.
Lightening, thunder and rain made it miserable and we evacuated the pool
at one stage.  We ended the day back at Gatsien learning to cross eddie
lines.  Here's the thing:  That man Hugh Du Preez is amazing.  He is a
wealth of knowledge when it comes to paddling.  The techniques he showed
us blew my mind.  Athough they are not natural to me yet I know they
will transform my surf kayaking and obviously make river paddling safe
and a reality for me.  &quot;Hugh you need to write a book (I am serious) and
make an instructional video.  There are too many paddlers doing it
wrong.&quot;

The trip down the river on Sunday was brilliant.  Learning to use eddies
was the most fun I had on the weekend.  The highlight was a hole
somewhere around Ha De Da.  It was working the best of the three holes
on the trip.  Hugh even started coming out the closet and busted some
sick moves.  I think he even drew some blood from his face, lost his
paddle but carried on like nothing had happened without the paddle.
Legend.

I am more amped than ever for kayaking and look forward to learning more
and to some degree tame and be tamed by our rivers and oceans.
See you on the water
Dean.
