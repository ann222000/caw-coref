It's only free speech if its your platform, your audience and your
mike.  Otherwise it's called freeloader speech!

Jim,

it's like Uncle Bernie inviting himself to
Thanksgiving dinner at your house.

He really isn't your Uncle is he?

Freedom isn't free.  Sometimes there's a price you pay.  If you're an
idiot
college student, the price is a tazer.

There's nothing more free than jail if you have no place in the

He should have been shot. Creating a public disturbance isn't free speech.
It is being an asshole.

I can see tasering someone if in defense of life and limb, not when
the people in already subdued and in hand cuffs.  Perhaps the campus
police should be tasered in their gonads...

He wasn't yet in handcuffs, thats why they needed to tazer him.  He
wasn't actually tazered in the fullest sense either, the female
officer used the tazer in contact mode on his shoulder, this produces
only localized pain.  To achieve the full effect of a tazer, one must
be shot with the probes, this completely immobilizes the subject.

You need to watch the video, it shows that they were extremely patient
and kind with this nitwit, it also appears that he was looking to be
tazered on video in order to capture his own 15 minutes of fame.

When someone is in danger of life and limb, they need to shoot to kill.

He just wanted to be noticed Jim.

Just like GeraldKrug the scarecrow.

If he only used his brain.

You are assuming that he actually has a brain?
