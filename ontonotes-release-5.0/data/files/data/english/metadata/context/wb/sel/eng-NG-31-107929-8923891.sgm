I need to know what is wrong with my car before i go off to college so
i can get it fixed.

One day I stopped at a stop sign and it died and would not start. I
had gas so I thought maybe it flooded. I waited about 15 minutes and
nothing happened. So I went and put a lil gas in the carb and it
started but when I pressed the gas pedal it wasn't reving up or
nothing. So what do I do if my gas pedal doesnt work?

Find out why.

It will run with gas poured in it, so it isn't getting any the normal way.

The fuel filter could be plugged.

The fuel pump could be bad.

You could have a broken fuel line.  (any gas smells around the car lately?)

Your gas gauge might be stuck. so you are actually out of gas.

A few ideas for you.

With temperatures like we've been having, vapor lock came to mind.  We
seldom see it
now since the high fuel line pressures of injection system tend to keep the
gasoline
liquid.  But carburetors were sometimes very susceptible.

Are you SURE there's anything &quot;electric&quot; involved in the carb on an 87
Caprice, other than computer feeback to a VDC solenoid to trim the
mixture? If the pedal is having NO effect, I'm betting that the
accelerator pedal cable is broken or disconnected.

And veering off-topic....

That's the theory, but you wanna hear some irony? I drive a carbureted
car every day ('66 Dodge, 440 engine, Edelbrock AVS carb, 20k miles on a
fresh overhaul).  From April to October, it runs *perfectly*. Even in
110-degree ambient weather, sitting in stop-and-go traffic at 5:00 PM
with the AC turned up full-bore, it won't vapor lock or overheat (dang,
did Chrysler ever know how to build a cooling system back then).

But come October and the switch to &quot;winter&quot; gasoline, it vapor-locks all
too easily when the ambient temp gets over 75F. And since I live in
Texas, that's just about every day.  I despise winter-blend gasoline,
and all it does is increase evaporative emissions anyway. Modern EFI
cars vaporize the fuel just fine even when its blended for normal lower
vapor-pressures, and older cars like mine vapor lock on the crap, so why
even use it? Its a scam, I tell ya! :-p

Sure, winter blends have more volatile components, and would be more prone
to vapor lock.

I have had had many cars that never vapor locked, even in the worst of
weather.
But, you may remember, in those days we also ran the engines cooler than we
do
today, whenever possible.

I agree that fuel injection solves a lot of problems.

I've never had a car that *DID* vapor lock until the winter-blend swill
for the last couple of years came out. :(  Its still not bad enough to
stall the car, but its really annoying to have it stuble and surge
mid-acceleration.  I have a further heat mitigation plan that I'm going
to try this winter. Worst case, I'll add a fuel return line and
duplicate the continuous circulation fuel system that the HP 440 and 426
Hemi B-body cars had circa 67-72, which used the fuel tank as a heat
sink to keep the fuel in the lines much cooler during low-flow intervals
(idling at a stoplight, for example). My 69 R/T doesn't have the problem
at all, even with the worst winter-blends we get here.

A number of years back, I would see mid-80s low-pressure throttle-body
injected cars vapor locked in the middle of winter beside the road as
often or more often than carb cars. A good hot day with all the gas
stations selling winter blend and you might see 2 or 3 stalled cars on
the daily commute, but at the time the blends weren't bad enough to
vapor lock my carb'd car. I think that the early TBI cars got the fuel
hotter than carb cars on the assumption that the higher pressure would
make it OK, but 15 PSI or so just wasn't quite high enough.  MPFI with
40-60 PSI pretty well fixes it altogether.
