Namely it improves local viewing of the stars overhead.

I had experienced a blackout last night that started just at 9:50 PM
and lasted until around 1:30 AM.

(I was watching Heroes and was pissed off to miss the last few mins.)
Still, I was able to step outside to congregate w/ my neighbors a
bit.

Also the Moon was near full and the landscape looked Soooo much better
by moonshine &lt;hick&gt; than by those nasty street lights. (Yuck)

I stood outside for about a half an hour looking at Orion and th Moon
and noticing a rather bright star just the left of and down a bit from
'the mighty hunter', I wonder what it might have been.

As I post this it reminds me I need to go camping soon.

One thing I recall from a few blackouts back when I lived in Southern
California, is just how much light pollution is local. Even living in
the middle of a sea of light pollution covering thousands of square
miles, a blackout affecting only a few blocks affords a considerable
reduction in sky brightness for those inside it.

Had I had a telescope a year and a half ago, I could have really
enjoyed the dark skies here in New Orleans. To think, I was here for
one of the biggest blackouts in the city's history and didn't have a
scope.

Except when there's a full moon out. ;)

Well, that's certainly a good thing. Especially when you can show them
M51 or the Orion nebula in all their glory. A few might even start to
appreciate what you're up to and why it's nice of them to turn off the
floodlight in their backyard.

Another side effect of blackouts: new babies (ob 2001: star children?) 9
months later.

I stepped outside during a blackout a few years back and could
plainly
see the Milky Way in Monoceros.  I grabbed the 60 mm, and went.  Later
I was
joined by a few of the neighbors and we just mowed 'em down for a
couple of
hours.  I mean tough objects.
The skies are good here in E Ark but not great, except that night.
I don't have that 60 anymore so I'm looking for another "grab &amp;
go". Blackouts
are frequent around here and usually welcome.
