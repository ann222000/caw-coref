First of all, thank you all for the ideas for my skellemancer.

When I asked for help, DanASkully just defeated Diablo in Normal, and was
beginning the uncharted territory through A5 normal, with hopes to go into
Nightmare when I got to level 40.

Cow runs were a tad boring and surprising little xp, so I said screw it! and
jumped into Nightmare at 37.  As several have stated, with some patience and
restraining the urge to melee, it has been fairly uneventful.  I am happy
that I have only died 3 times so far since my previous post, and none of
those deaths were to a Act Boss.  (yes, I play SC to stay away from stupid
deaths).

My usual playing strategy is run a Countess, then Andy, then make a little
improvement in the regular game play (usually one waypoint or quest).
Yesterday, no pre-amble.  I just started in Upper Kurast, and kept running
until the end of A3.

Given the concerns that a poster had about meeting Mephy, i was a little
nervous as I went down the levels of the Durance of Hate.  I was level 57
when I approached, but my small army (10 skeletons, 4 mages, Fire Golem,
Cold Rogue) did fine.  I started off with a decrypify every few seconds,
waited until my rogue got a few shots with her cold arrow, then i switched
to life-tap.  I had to recast my golem twice, and the golem died one more
time right at the end.  I used one fat-purple, not because of Mephisto, but
because of a hidden (behind Mephisto) night lord that kept hitting me with a
meteor.  The battle was long, but I believe I never took any damage from
Mephy himself.  And the Fire Golem was the only casualty in my army.

Then I saw the drop.  Isenhart's sword, and a rare spear.  I needed to make
sure that I wasn't playing Normal when I saw it.  I hope in this instance
the Quest-drop isn't indicative of further Mephy runs.

Again, thanks for all the help earlier... I am off to run through Act 4.  I
think I can hear Diablo laughing at me.

Congrat's on advancing to Nightmare!

I know you weren't soliciting advice, but here's a bit for you:  Ditch
that cold rogue by going to Act II in Nightmare and hiring a Might
merc (they're listed as &quot;offense&quot;).  The reasons are threefold:  1)  A
cold rogue can freeze and shatter enemies, meaning less corpses for
you to use corpse explosion on, 2)  The might merc increases the
damage for all partied members in range of his aura, meaning your
minions will kill faster, and 3)  If you're playing online or playing
SP with a mod enabling the online runewords, your might merc can wield
the Insight runeword in a polearm, meaning an almost limitless supply
of mana for you to blow up corpses with.

Man, drop that cold rogue NOW and hire an act 2 Might merc. It's the

Agreed. In fact, the key reason to switch to a Might merc (NM
Offensive) is that from Hell, you will see a drastic slow down
of your bony warriors' killing speed, sometimes intolerably
slow. Most people therefore use a Might merc.

Nevertheless, this is not a must. First of all, one of the
ultimate skellimancer setups is a teleporting necro with a rogue
using a Faith bow (uber runeword bow). Secondly, if killing
speed, ie, game progressing, is not your prime concern, and you
are playing for joy and pass-time, then you can experience any
kind of merc (except a cold iron wolf) for your necro. I myself
have never used a rogue for my skellimancers, but occasionally I
will use a prayer merc.

My wife never switched merc, and she ended up using her original
rogues for all of her characters, and she had finished the game
multiple times, often using craps she found on the way (she
never bought/gambled anything from vendors). It usually took her
a long time to finish the game (eg. her necro took 3 hours to
kill Diablo in Normal: an hour to take D to silver, then went to
take a break and watch a sitcom, came back to find D at full
health, another hour or so to kill it. Since she only played
with one finger, the fire golem + IM tactic didn't work for her.)

Other than the comments offered by Flank and Bing I'd just like to say that
I prefer Clay Golem for end bosses. He's cheap to re-cast and slows them
down considerably, meaning they do far less damage as they're hitting less

Thanks for the feedback...

I just fired my rogue, and have a new Might merc.  I outfitted him with a
&quot;fast&quot; pole arm that i bought from NM Larzuk, until i can find a 4os
fast/very fast and a SOL.

But wait, you may ask, wasn't it just yesterday that you were talking about
just starting A4?  I had a couple of hours to kill, so I thought I would
give it a try.  My intent was to just find Izzy, and see what my army would
do, but things got a little fun and interesting.

With decrypify, and the still cold rogue, izzy was slowed down signficantly,
and the army (and additional 4 revived Pit Lords that decided to join the
fray), Izzy was down.  Consistent with my recent luck on drops, Izzy dropped
about 1000 gold and nothing else.  I passed the stairs to the City of The
Damned on the way to find Izzy, so I went down the stairs.  About 2 screens
away, there was the waypoint and the Stairs down again.  Whoo Hoo!

I made it to the Forge, and I haven't checked the tables, but the Forge Drop
was a Lem (Very far my best rune ever), so until I check the tables or
someone sets me straight, I am going to say that this was a better-luck-than
normal drop.

Chaos Sanctuary was pretty easy.  I would have expected to lose *some*
skeletons to the OKs when they got IMed, but I never lost one.  Diablo was a
different matter.  first of all, I had trouble with my wheel on my mouse so
switching &quot;right attacks&quot; was a pain.  Big D did his usual ring-o-flame, and
all 4 of my mages were toast.  I still had 3 Viper Lords left, my merc, and
9 of my skeletons.  He finally wore down all my revives, and i was down to 7
skeletons, when he killed my merc.  Quickly I ran back to my WP, back to the
Pandemonium Fortress to revive my soon-to-be-fired merc.  Went back to see
that D was down to a sliver on life.  FG on the other side of him, and
another 15 seconds or so, when my screen froze.  A sign that either Diablo
was dying, or I was about to be killed by a super-lag.  Fortunately for me,
it was the former.

The drop, a couple of low-level rares (Qatar's, a druid hat; nothing any of
my characters could use).  It seems that drops were back to their sucky
norm.

So today, I read the posts about fire my rogue; and I decide to do it.  In
all my diablo playing off and on through the years, I have never changed
mercenaries.  Today, I did, and did a Countess and Andy run to try it out.
I never saw the countess (not unusual), and the drop was 2 runes: El, Eld.
Andy was significantly faster.  WITHOUT a decrypify, Andy went down in about
10 seconds.  It was fun just watching her life-bar just drain away.  Her
drop a Topaz, and Cathan's Ring.

Now that I have a new mercenary, and no more source of Cold... Now I am
soliciting advice... I am level 60, I have ~10 hard points in Corpse
Explosion.  1 hard point in each Golem and 1 in Golem Mastery.  The advice
above seems to indicate that CG is a far better choice for the chill effect.
If I switch to Clay Golem (I have been using Fire because my +2 Summoning
wand also came with a +2 FG skill) what is the thought of adding more points
to CG and GM?

Thanks again for all the help.

Don't do it, there are much better investments for the points saved there.
You could further pump CE (for more range), you could pump Dim Vision if
you want to go the defensive route. I personally pump Bone Spirit, and
the rest in synergies to that, and Bone Armor, which means that Bone
Prison is probably the most useful there.

Anyway, all are valid. You do have maxed SM and RS?

Patrick.

I use Fire Golem for most of my questing, and Clay only for the end of
act bosses, due to his slowing effect.  However, I only put 1 hard
point into them - if they die, just re-cast them.  As Patrick said,
those points are better put elsewhere.

Me, I like a HUGE Dim Vision, so I put quite a few points into it.  I
really can't overstate the usefullness of being able to blind every
non-boss/champion enemy in an area that's larger than the screen size.

&gt;&gt;Now that I have a new mercenary, and no more source of Cold... Now I am
&gt;&gt;soliciting advice... I am level 60, I have ~10 hard points in Corpse
&gt;&gt;Explosion.  1 hard point in each Golem and 1 in Golem Mastery.  The advice
&gt;&gt;above seems to indicate that CG is a far better choice for the chill
&gt;&gt;effect.
&gt;&gt;If I switch to Clay Golem (I have been using Fire because my +2 Summoning
&gt;&gt;wand also came with a +2 FG skill) what is the thought of adding more
&gt;&gt;points
&gt;&gt;to CG and GM?

&gt; Don't do it, there are much better investments for the points saved there.
&gt; You could further pump CE (for more range), you could pump Dim Vision if
&gt; you want to go the defensive route. I personally pump Bone Spirit, and
&gt; the rest in synergies to that, and Bone Armor, which means that Bone
&gt; Prison is probably the most useful there.

&gt; Anyway, all are valid. You do have maxed SM and RS?

&gt; Regards,

&gt; Patrick.

Thanks Patrick and Frank,

RS is maxed.  SM is either 18 or 19 currently (25 after equipment, i haven't
stripped to see the hard points), and that is where the next 1-2 points are
going.

New report when I make it either to or past Baal.

&gt; I use Fire Golem for most of my questing, and Clay only for the end of
&gt; act bosses, due to his slowing effect.  However, I only put 1 hard
&gt; point into them - if they die, just re-cast them.  As Patrick said,
&gt; those points are better put elsewhere.

Gotta agree with Flank, I play exactly the same way with Golems. Some times
I make an Iron Golem if I find an IK Maul or a Bonesnap etc. Especially if
it's ethereal, it looks cool. &lt;g&gt;. I actually made an IG out of an eth
Kelpie Snare that I managed to keep &quot;alive&quot; for a long time. Pretty cool, an
IG that slows the bosses as much as a CG.

Once RS and SM are maxed and you have all the curses, what to pump is
a matter of playing style, whether you tend to solo or team up,
whether you are HC or SC, etc.  Good choices are DV for defense and CE
or BS for killing power.
