demic-boycott.html&gt; in the Foot: The British Academic Boycott

Posted: 18 Sep 2007 11:39 AM CDT

Back in May the University and College Union (UCU) in the United Kingdom
announced a boycott of Israel. In the four months since that announcement, the
USU has had their posteriors kicked from here to the moon. Everyone from British
parliamentarians to academics across the world have spoken out against the
action. Even the UN expressed its objection to the boycott. Manfred Gerstenfeld
of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, take a look at the UCU boycott as a
case study regarding a how a boycott can turn on its advocates.

tudy&gt; Developments on the Academic Boycott: A Case Study[1]

Manfred Gerstenfeld

The late-May anti-Israeli resolution at the first conference of the University
and College Union (UCU) in the United Kingdom launched a new round in the debate
on boycotting Israel. This controversy was initiated in 2002, also in the UK. In
2005, the Association of University Teachers (AUT) passed a motion boycotting
Haifa and Bar-Ilan universities, which was revoked after a month. In 2006, the
National Association of Teachers of Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) also
passed a boycott motion, which lapsed after a few days when NATFHE merged with
AUT into the new UCU.

The UCU resolution was followed by anti-Israeli boycott resolutions by other
British trade unions. The earlier boycott resolution of the National Union of
Journalists (NUJ) was later made ineffective. The current boycott actions of the
trade unions are probably coordinated by extreme left-wing organizations.

The anti-Israeli actions do not seem to derive from genuine concerns about the
Palestinians' fate. This can be gauged by the boycotters' indifference to what
happens to Palestinians elsewhere.

The battle over the academic boycott has now been internationalized, as many
consider that major academic issues rather than the Israeli-Palestinian one are
at stake. As the debate-which may heat up again after the academic
holidays-between pro- and antiboycotters continues, it is clear that if Israeli
academia is harmed, British academia will also incur substantial damage.

The anti-Israeli boycott campaign on campus in the twenty-first century has its
origins in the United Kingdom. It can be traced back to an open letter by
academics in The Guardian on 6 April 2002. It called for a moratorium on all
cultural and research links with Israel at European or national levels until the
Israeli government abided by UN resolutions and opened &quot;serious peace
negotiations with the Palestinians, along the lines proposed in many peace plans
including most recently that sponsored by the Saudis and the Arab League.&quot;[2]

Since then there have been many efforts to organize anti-Israeli actions both on
campuses and in broader academic frameworks in several countries. In some
universities these have led to outbursts of anti-Semitism accompanied by
violence.[3]

During recent years members of UK academia have continued to play a key role in
anti-Israeli boycott efforts.[4] In 2005, the Association of University Teachers
(AUT) passed a motion boycotting Haifa and Bar-Ilan universities, which was
revoked after a month. In May 2006, NATFHE, another UK academic teachers union,
voted in favor of boycotting Israeli academics. The motion was ineffective as a
few days later NATHFE merged with AUT into the University and College Union
(UCU). This union now comprises about 120,000 teachers at universities,
colleges, and higher-education organizations in the United Kingdom.

The anti-Israeli boycott issue was raised again at the first conference of the
UCU on 30 May 2007Bournemouth. A motion was passed there calling for a debate on
a comprehensive and consistent boycott of Israeli academic institutions. Some
158 delegates voted in favor and 99 against.[5] in

The resolution condemned Israeli academia's involvement with the occupation of
the territories. It called for lecturers to refuse to collaborate on research
with Israeli academics, including refusal to work with Israeli academic
journals.

Sally Hunt, the UCU's secretary-general, asserted during the conference that
most UCU members would not support such a boycott and it would not be a priority
for them. She stressed that the motion was a call for discussion and not an
actual decision to implement a boycott.[6] Hunt did not mention at any time
whether she herself supported the boycott or not.

Earlier, at its annual delegates meeting in April, the National Union of
Journalists (NUJ) had passed a call for a boycott of Israeli products by a 66-54
majority.[7] Groups of journalists at the BBC, Reuters, The Guardian, and
elsewhere issued strong condemnations. In early July, the NUJ succumbed to the
opposition and issued a statement by its executive that amounted to a decision
to ignore the boycott resolution.[8]

The UCU boycott call was followed by several anti-Israeli resolutions by other
British unions. UNISON, the largest UK trade union, voted on 19 June for an
economic, cultural, academic, and sports boycott of Israel.[9] In the last week
of June another large union, the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU),
passed a resolution to ban the import of all Israeli products.[10] That same
week a Northern Ireland union, the Public Service Alliance (NIPSA), unanimously
passed five pro-Palestinian motions including one in support of boycotting
Israeli products and services.[11]

Protests against the UCU resolution built up slowly. Most of the initial ones
came from Jewish organizations and individuals. Already before the UCU boycott,
American Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg decided not to travel to Britain for a
lecture at Imperial College in London in view of the severe anti-Israeli
sentiment emerging throughout the United Kingdom.[12]

Israeli education minister Yuli Tamir and foreign minister Tzipi Livni condemned
the UCU motion.[13] The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) published ads in the New
York Times and other publications against the proposed boycott. They pointed out
the British academics' unfair isolation of Israel in their purported desire to
achieve justice. As ADL national director Abe Foxman noted, &quot;If British
journalists and university professors and doctors want to make a point for
justice, there are 20 countries they could deal with.... If the only country
[that is subject to criticism] in the whole world is Israel, I call it
anti-Semitism.&quot;[14]

In early June, Scholars for Peace in the Middle East (SPME), an independent
international group of faculty members, started a petition of academics
denouncing the academic boycott against Israel. By the end of July 2007 ten
thousand academics had signed it, including thirty-two Nobel Prize winners and
fifty-three university heads.[15]

The Goldhirsh Foundation, an American $150 million research sponsor, reacted to
the boycott developments by stating that it would not fund British research.[16]

Before, during, and after the boycott resolution, an important role in the fight
against the boycott was played by the Israel-based International Advisory Board
for Academic Freedom (IAB), which supported UK lobbying efforts, accumulated
databases, organized media coverage, and informed Israeli academics and the
press about the boycott.[17]

Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz announced that he would sue UK
universities and British academics who supported the boycott, using a variety of
legislational tactics. Among them he cited an American law that bans
discrimination on the basis of nationality, to be used against universities in
the UK with research ties to U.S. institutions.[18]

In an article in the Times a British lawyer, Anthony Julius, and Dershowitz
wrote that the boycotters, in excluding &quot;from consideration the many nations
with far worse human rights records than Israel, . . . are merely practicing
sophistry in defence of their own double standards.&quot;[19] Julius and Dershowitz
went on to cite two reasons to regard the boycotters' position as an
anti-Semitic one. First, it resonated with earlier boycotts of Jews that were
all based on a &quot;principle of exclusion: Jews and/or the Jewish State, are to be
excluded from public life, from the community of nations, because they are
dangerous and malign.&quot;[20]

Second, the boycott was &quot;predicated on the defamation of Jews.&quot; Julius and
Dershowitz provided several arguments for this point, concluding that:
&quot;Boycotters may have Jewish friends, some may be Jews themselves-but in
supporting a boycott they have put themselves in anti-Semitism's camp.&quot;[21]

The British government has expressed its disapproval of the boycott in various
ways. The British ambassador to Israel, Tom Phillips, declared that the boycott
motion would have no impact on British-Israeli relations.[22] British education
minister Bill Rammell said in a visit to Israel that the UK supported academic
freedom and firmly opposed any boycott of Israel. Rammell expressed
disappointment that the UCU had passed the boycott motion and said it was
&quot;fundamentally wrong.&quot;[23]

On 6 June, the then prime minister Tony Blair called on the UCU to put an end to
the boycott, saying he hoped &quot;very much that decision is overturned because it
does absolutely no good for the peace process or for relations in

-temple-quarry.html&gt; Antiquities Find Temple Quarry as they Let Waqf Destroy
Temple Site

Posted: 23 Sep 2007 11:29 AM CDT

May they see it as some sort of consolation prize. Israel's Antiquities
Authority has been supporting the government in allowing the Muslim Waqf to
destroy remnants of the Second Temple, and at the same time Olmert's Government
has been promising to give up Judaism's most holy site--but the Antiquities
Authority has announced a significant archaeological discovery, they have found
one of the limestone quarry's used to cut the stone for the Holy Temple. Big
Freeking deal !!! Yes it is an important archaeological discovery, but it is not
as significant as the actual wall of the second temple that they are allowing
the Waqf destroy.

I have a suggestion for the Antiquities Authority. Maybe we should tear up your
pay check, rip them until they are destroyed but we will show you where they are
printed. Based on your logic that should be good enough.

icle%2FPrinter&gt; find 2nd Temple quarry

Etgar Lefkovits , THE JERUSALEM POST Sep. 23, 2007

In a major archeological discovery, an ancient quarry that supplied huge
high-quality limestone for the construction of the Temple Mount has been
uncovered in Jerusalem, Israel's Antiquities Authority announced Sunday.

The quarry, which is located four km northwest of Jerusalem's Old City, in the
Ramat Shlomo neighborhood, was used two thousand years ago during the
construction of the Second Temple, archeologist Yuval Baruch said.

&quot;This unique and sensational find is the first Second Temple quarry ever found,&quot;
he said.

According to Baruch, the site, which spans at least five dunams, was uncovered
by chance during a &quot;salvage excavation&quot; carried out by the state-run
archeological body over the last two months following municipal plans to build
an elementary school in the area.

Dozens of quarries have previously been uncovered in Jerusalem - including ones
larger than the present find - but this is the first one that archeologists have
found which they believe was used in the construction of the Temple Mount,
Baruch said. Archeologists had previously assumed that the quarry which was used
to construct the Temple Mount was located within the Old City itself, but the
enormous size of the stones discovered at the site - up to 8 meters long - as
well as coins and fragments of pottery vessels dating back to the first century
CE indicated that this was the site used 2,000 years ago in the construction of
the Temple Mount walls - including the Western Wall.

&quot;We have never found any monument in Israel with stones of this size except for
the Temple Mount walls,&quot; Baruch said.

During the Second Temple period, the rulers of the city elected to use high
quality stone in the construction of national public buildings. The stones
selected originated in the hard layers of limestone, referred to in Arabic as
malakeh (from the Hebrew word malkhut or royalty), owing to its beauty and
quality. The huge stones were likely transported to the Temple Mount area by
horses, camels, or slaves, Baruch said, noting that part of an ancient main road
to Jerusalem that was used for the immense operation was recently uncovered just
100 meters from the site of the quarry. The use of these enormous stones during
the construction is what maintained the stability of the structure over
thousands of years, without requiring the use of plaster or cement.

The quarrying of each stone block was done in stages, according to Irina
Zilberbod, the excavation director. First, deep narrow channels were hewn around
all four sides of the block, thereby isolating it from the surrounding bedrock
surface. Then, using a hammer, the stonecutters inserted a row of cleaving
stakes in the bottom part of the block until a fissure was created and the stone
was detached. A 5 kilogram iron tool, which was used by King Herod's workers -
probably Jewish slaves - and was likely forgotten at the site, was discovered
beneath large stones in the middle of the excavations, Baruch said.

The site, which was used for no more than 20 years, was abandoned after the
Second Temple period, said archaeologist Ehud Nesher who also took part in the
dig. The area is now surrounded by olive trees planted by Arab villagers, and a
sprawling Haredi residential neighborhood. The area of the quarry which has been
uncovered is likely only thirty to forty percent of its total size, but
archaeologists have no immediate plans to excavate the rest of the area because
it is private property.

The discovery of the site comes as the state-run archaeological body is immersed
in a bitter controversy over recent Islamic infrastructure work on the Temple
Mount itself, which independent Israeli archaeologists say has damaged
antiquities at the Jerusalem holy site.

The work, which was authorized by the Prime Minister's Office, is meant to
replace decades-old electrical cables at the ancient compound.

The Antiquities Authority, which has been repeatedly censured by the independent
group of archeologists for failing to carry out proper archaeological
supervision on the Temple Mount due to the political sensitivities involved, has
repeatedly declined comment on the issue.

nese-jail.html&gt; Turncoat Rot In Lebanese Jail

Posted: 23 Sep 2007 11:03 AM CDT

Danny Sharon was arrested by Lebanese Intelligence over the weekend. Not for
espionage but because his passport was found at a murder scene. According to the
Lebanese Newspaper Al-Akhbar:

Sharon told investigators that he was a homosexual who frequently visited south
Beirut's Dahiya district, adding that he traded with Israeli and European
countries. The investigation further revealed that Sharon bribed the hotel's
check-in clerk in exchange for not registering him by his full name. The report
said Sharon further told the investigators he had converted to Islam and that
his full name was Daniel Moussa Sharon and that he was born in 1975. He
initially said his father was a Jew of Turkish descent, but later claimed that
his father was actually a Syrian-Jew who immigrated to Israel in 1959. Sharon
said he was able to obtain his German passport through his family's connections,
adding that he had learned Arabic in the United Arab Emirates and that he also
visited Egypt and Jordan on a regular basis. The investigation also revealed
that Sharon had visited Lebanon 11 times since 2005 and that he spent a month
there prior to the outbreak of the Second Lebanon War.

Rabbis in Israel have suggested that the Foreign Ministry need not waste its
time protecting Sharon.

Rabbis:  &lt; http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/123750 &gt; No Need to
Aid Ex-Jew Who Has Joined Enemy

by Hillel Fendel
&lt; http://beta.blogger.com/%20+%20sLinkData%20+%20 &gt; (IsraelNN.com) It was
announced in Lebanon over the weekend that an Israeli-German Moslem named Danny
Sharon had been arrested by local police in connection with a local murder. The
man was reportedly transferred to the Lebanese Intelligence agency for
interrogation - and Israel's Foreign Ministry is &quot;following&quot; the case.

Sharon was born in Germany, grew up in Israel, and converted to Islam several
years ago. He was arrested in Beirut on Thursday after his passport was found at
the scene of the murder. One of the main suspects had claimed as his alibi that
at the time of the murder, he was with a German friend - none other than Sharon,
whose Israeli passport was then found at the scene of the crime in the Lebanese
capital

Sharon allegedly denied being on an espionage mission, saying he was merely on a
tourism visit in Lebanon. This version is supported by the very fact that he
travels with his Israeli passport.

Sharon's fate at present is unknown. From his father's home in Shavei Tzion,
just 15 kilometers south of the Israel-Lebanon border and close to Nahariya,
came this message: &quot;The Foreign Ministry and German consulate are dealing with
this matter. We know nothing more than that, and we of course do not want to
hurt the chances of ending this story as quickly as possible.&quot; Foreign Ministry
sources said they are following the story.

Who is Danny Sharon?
Danny Sharon provided a glimpse at his life when he spoke with the Yediot
Acharonot newspaper 11 years ago. He said he was in Lebanon during Israel's
anti-terrorism operation Grapes of Wrath, in April 1996, and he saw how a
Lebanese rocket missed hitting its Israeli aircraft target. &quot;Together with all
