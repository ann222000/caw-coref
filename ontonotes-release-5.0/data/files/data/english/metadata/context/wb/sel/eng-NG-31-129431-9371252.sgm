Hi runners

Am planning a half marathon with Rajat at Bellandur on Tuesday 16th - we meet at 0530 to run at 0545 so that we can get back in time for work. The run will be on the 'forest side' and we will do a longer loop ( approx 7 km).

Let me know if you are interested - you will need to carry your own fluids/snacks etc.

Regards

Sunil

I'd love to but I'd need to leave 7:30ish. Can't be late to work
tomorrow. So if anyone's leaving at 7:30ish and can give me a ride
back to civilisation, I'm on.

Hello there,

It's going to be White WagonR though ;-) I would be starting from Naamdhari
Fresh/MRF Showroom on ESI Hospital/Domlur road going toward Airport road via
Flyover. Let me know where do you want me to pick you/wait for you.

Hi doc,

I am quite flattered that you have banded me along with the 'kids'. I
am in Delhi now and reaching Blr tonight. Will try and join but not
100% sure.

Nitin, if I want to hitch a ride with you will sms you (if there is
place in the car).
With best regards
Muthu

Hey Claudia,
Either me or one of my associates will aim to abduct you at 5:15 or so.
It'll be a black Honda Civic or Hyundai Santro.
My number is 099456 95732
will keep you informed.
Nitin, counting on you.
Take care.
Rajat

Michaelpalya/Indiranagar and would need a ride though. I don't know where
Bellandur is.

Thanks,

I'd love to but I'd need to leave 7:30ish. Can't be late to work
tomorrow. So if anyone's leaving at 7:30ish and can give me a ride
back to civilisation, I'm on.
