Dr Joseph Goebbels, Der Angriff, 21 January 1929.

The Jew
by Joseph Goebbels

Everything is discussed openly in Germany, and every German claims the
right to have an opinion on any and all questions. One is Catholic,
the other Protestant, one an employee, the other an employer, a
capitalist, a socialist, a democrat, an aristocrat. There is nothing
dishonorable about choosing one side or the other of a question.
Discussions happen in public, and where matters are unclear or
confused one settles it by argument and counter argument. But there is
one problem that is not discussed publicly, one that it is delicate
even to mention: the Jewish question. It is taboo in our republic.
The Jew is immunized against all dangers: one may call him a
scoundrel, parasite, swindler, profiteer, it all runs off him like
water off a raincoat. But call him a Jew and you will be astonished at
how he recoils, how injured he is, how he suddenly shrinks back: &quot;I've
been found out.&quot;
One cannot defend himself against the Jew. He attacks with lightening
speed from his position of safety and uses his abilities to crush any
attempt at defense.
Quickly he turns the attacker's charges back on him, and the attacker
becomes the liar, the troublemaker, the terrorist. Nothing could be
more mistaken than to defend oneself. That is just what the Jew wants.
He can invent a new lie every day for the enemy to respond to, and the
result is that the enemy spends so much time defending himself that he
has no time to do what the Jew really fears: to attack. The accused
has become the accuser, and loudly he shoves the accuser into the
dock. So it always was in the past when a person or a movement fought
the Jew. That is what would happen to us as well were we not fully
aware of his nature, and if we lacked the courage to draw the
following radical conclusions:
1. One cannot fight the Jew by positive means. He is a negative, and
this negative must be erased from the German system, or he will
forever corrupt it.
2. One cannot discuss the Jewish question with the Jews. One can
hardly prove to a person that one has the duty to render him harmless.
3. One cannot allow the Jew the same means one would give an honest
opponent, for he is no honorable opponent. He will use generosity and
nobility only to trap his enemy.
4. The Jew has nothing to say about German questions. He is a
foreigner, an alien, who only enjoys the rights of a guest, rights
that he always abuses.
5. The so-called religious morality of the Jews is no morality at all,
rather an encouragement to betrayal. Therefore, they have no claim to
protection from the state.
6. The Jew is not smarter than we are, rather only cleverer and
craftier. His system cannot be defeated economically-he follows
entirely different moral principles than we do. It can only be broken
through political means.
7. A Jew cannot insult a German. Jewish slanders are but badges of
honor for a German opponent of the Jews.
8. The more a German person or a German movement opposes the Jew, the
more valuable it is. If someone is attacked by the Jews, that is a
sure sign of his virtue. He who is not persecuted by the Jews, or who
is praised by them, is useless and dangerous.
9. The Jew evaluates German questions from the Jewish standpoint. As a
result, the opposite of what he says must be true.
10. One must either affirm or reject anti-Semitism. He who defends the
Jews harms his own people. One can only be a Jewish lackey or a Jewish
opponent. Opposing the Jews is a matter of personal hygiene.
These principles give the anti-Jewish movement a chance of success.
Only such a movement will be taken seriously by the Jews, only such a
movement will be feared by them.
The fact that he shouts and complains about such a movement therefore
is only a sign that it is right. We are therefore delighted that we
are constantly attacked in the Jewish gazettes. They may shout about
terror. We answer with Mussolini's familiar words: &quot;Terror? Never! It
is social hygiene. We take these individuals out of circulation just
as a doctor does to a bacterium.

IMO people should be allowed to say whatever they want within the bounds
of safety. (Shouting fire in the cinema is out)

That leads us to a discussion of whether other people are compelled to
repeat their words, or to facilitate their words reaching a large
audience.

I believe the right to decline a broadcast, or to edit a recording
before broadcast is a valid extension of the right to free speech.

Just because someone says something does not mean another person is
compelled to broadcast it.

The award recipient had the right to say what she did. The Catholic
president had the right to lobby to have the speech edited before
broadcast. The broadcaster had the right to edit the recording and
broadcast the edited version. A chain of preservation of individual
rights.

Thanks for posting this, it is amazingly prophetic! Â What an amazing
article from 1929!

Goebbels reached the same conclusions that many people are reaching
now, that the Jews are collectively a menace.

This passage could have been written today:

&quot;Quickly he turns the attacker's charges back on him, and the attacker
becomes the liar, the troublemaker, the terrorist. Nothing could be
more mistaken than to defend oneself. That is just what the Jew wants.
He can invent a new lie every day for the enemy to respond to, and the
result is that the enemy spends so much time defending himself that he
has no time to do what the Jew really fears: to attack. The accused
has become the accuser, and loudly he shoves the accuser into the
dock. So it always was in the past when a person or a movement fought
the Jew.&quot;

Within 10 years, that menace was eradicated from Germany. Â Then the
Kikes got their revenge, raping and burning Germany. Â Even now Germany
is under the Jew boot.

Now the world sees the wisdom of Goebbel's words.

Hopefully within 10 years we will rid our nations of the pernicious Jew
menace.

&quot;Opposing the Jews is a matter of personal hygiene. &quot;

&gt; &gt; IMO people should be allowed to say whatever they want within the bounds
&gt; &gt; of safety. (Shouting fire in the cinema is out)

&gt; &gt; That leads us to a discussion of whether other people are compelled to
&gt; &gt; repeat their words, or to facilitate their words reaching a large
&gt; &gt; audience.

&gt; &gt; I believe the right to decline a broadcast, or to edit a recording
&gt; &gt; before broadcast is a valid extension of the right to free speech.

&gt; &gt; Just because someone says something does not mean another person is
&gt; &gt; compelled to broadcast it.

&gt; &gt; The award recipient had the right to say what she did. The Catholic
&gt; &gt; president had the right to lobby to have the speech edited before
&gt; &gt; broadcast. The broadcaster had the right to edit the recording and
&gt; &gt; broadcast the edited version. A chain of preservation of individual
&gt; &gt; rights.

&gt; Which leads us to the inevitable conclusion: the right to free speech
&gt; guarantees that if you have enough money and influence, governments will
&gt; not impede your exercise of that right. But, if you do not have those
&gt; things, governments will not help you in exercising that right.
">

In the same way as broadcasters, government is not compelled to help
broadcast the words of others. They may choose to do so however.

Governments, and the people who make up the government, also have a
right to free speech.

Here in Australia we currently have a problem with individuals within
the government causing the government to spend money broadcasting their
personal opinions. It is especially troubling because there is a federal
election happening soon, and the government is spending $millions on
hammering home party political propaganda.

This is great if you happen to agree with the political party in power,
but not so good if you oppose them. Personally I think it is just
embezzlement ad should be treated accordingly under the Crimes Act.

Can the rich afford to pay for mass communication of their opinions? You
bet they can! Is this wrong? Not to a fair dinkum (genuine) liberal.

Can the poor get access to mass communication? Yes. This is the 21st
century for goodness sake. We have a nifty thing called the Internet
that levels the playing field.

That is in addition to the traditional methods of capturing the
attention of the mass media, such as publicity stunts, demonstrations
etc.

Of course the poor have to do a lot of work to get their opinions on the
mass media (other than the Internet). But when you look into the reality
of the situation, the rich have already done the work required and
stored its value in assets and currency. They simply dip into their bank
of stored effort and spend some of it on communication.

To recap, freedom of speech is an individual right that attaches to
people and organisations. This freedom means a person or organisation
has the right to say, or not say, whatever they choose. A natural
extension of the right is the right to influence others to say, or not
say, things on your behalf. This influence may flow from your sparkling
personality, or from your wallet.

Freedom is always a two edged sword. Some people don't seem to
understand the nature of true freedom. With true freedom it is not
possible to compel another to do something on your behalf. That would
mean the other person or organisation did not enjoy freedom.

Freedom of speech. Isn't it great?
Well for us fair dinkum liberals it is ;-)
The rest of you are *free* to make your own arrangements.

We might have all the rights we want, but if there is no government to
protect those rights, those rights mean nothing. Personally, I do not
believe in freedom of speech being an &quot;individual&quot; right, as it means
very little for me to have the right to say whatever I want if you do
not have the right to hear what I say. And viceversa, I might have the
right to read whatever I want, but if you do not have the right to write
whatever you feel like, then that actually infringes my right to learn
what you think.

Thus, I consider freedom not something that an individual has, and that
ends where the freedom of another individual starts, like if we were
talking about real estate. I consider freedom something that actually
has meaning in a community, and not only does not end where other
people's freedom starts, but actually becomes relevant with other
people's freedom, and the lack of freedom in other people affects
adversely my own freedom, pretty much like if I were having a phone with
multiple features, only to discover that the person I want to call does
not have a phone.

X may well have the right to speak or write freely.
Y may have the right to listen or read what X writes.
But W does not have an obligation to convey what X says to Y.
W can do so if s/he chooses however.
This is freedom of speech.

If an obligation is imposed on W to convey what X says to Y, W no longer
has freedom of speech.

Freedom of speech implies a freedom not to speak. If someone, or some
organisation, is forced to say something against their will, they no
longer have freedom of speech.

Freedom of speech does not mean others must listen to what you say
either. Some people think that others must listen to whatever they have
to say for freedom of speech to exist. This simply isn't true.

Those who think others should be forced to listen to what they have to
say, or be forced to repeat what they have to say, miss the whole point
of freedom.

Free people are free to ignore others as well as listen to their views.

Forcing someone to listen, or to repeat your words when they do not
voluntarily choose to do so is the antithesis of freedom.

When I talk about rights, such as the right to free speech, I like to
point out that a right cannot exist alone. For every right there is a
complementary obligation. Take free speech for example. For free speech
to exist, society must observe the complementary obligation to let
others speak freely.

This does not mean that every time someone opens his or her mouth we
must politely pay attention until they have finished. It simply means we
should not stop them from speaking. We are free to ignore what they say.

Every society places limitations on the right to free speech. If someone
starts making a political speech in the middle of a theatre performance
they are quite rightly ejected from the venue. If people &quot;heckle&quot;
another speaker that people have gathered to hear, the same applies. If
someone starts making anti-Christian remarks in an inappropriate forum,
they may find their words edited from a broadcast.

Freedom of speech does not mean you have the right to access a mass
communication channel owned or controlled by someone else.

What it does mean is that you have the right to express your opinion
using the means at your disposal.

A soap box in a public park may be the only means at your disposal. If
so, you will have to learn to live with that situation.

Certainly it may irk you that others have more effective means of
communication at their disposal. But this is akin to the envy a
pedestrian feels as someone sweeps by in a Mercedes saloon car on a
rainy day. It really has nothing to do with freedom at all.
