After dieting since February, this morning my trusty bathroom scale marked a
50 lbs. weight loss!!

BG is good (FBG usually in the 94-110 range),  2 months ago the endo added
Altace to my meds and cut the Metformin from 1000 x 2 to 500 x 2.
Cholesterol went up slightly last time, but was still well within the
allowed range.
A1c was 5.8.  Next month we do the semi annual blood tests and see how I am
progressing.

This morning I tried on 2 suits which have not fitted me for years. One is
good, one is slightly too large  :-).

I continue to lurk and learn. Thanks to all for their valuable lessons.

Congratulations!

After I stabilized at my current weight (9+ years ago!!!), I still kept a
one-size-up suit as a sort of talisman -- also in case I puff up at just the
wrong time, i.e. when I *need* a suit for a funeral or something. It also
serves as an ego-boosting reference garment. So does a very old dress that I
never actually wear but *could* if I wanted to as it fits now as it did many
years ago.

wow Jay, congratulations, that's such a BIG success for you! ! !

who knows, keep the weight down to the 20's for BMI, and you might be able
to totally go off metformin, you are on a very low dose right now!

keep on, keeping on!

After selling two stationary cycles that I didn't use, and a rowing
machine that leaked oil, I swore never to buy another home exercise item.

Well, I bought an Ab Lounger at Costco a year ago and actually use the
thing almost every day.

Two ten-pound weights plus the lounger and walking, cycling or hiking
are about all I need.

Congrats, Jay!  I recently hit the 25 pound loss, so I know how good it
feels! I'm looking forward to my 50th! Go out and buy yourself something
special to mark the occasion. And make it something that will last (not
a piece of clothing that might get too big or will wear out) - something
that you can look at as your trophy :))))

Thats fantastic.  I think just weight loss alone gives us a sense of pride -
its a confidence booster.

Ive found since diagnosis, Ive had to kickstart everything and losing weight
has been a doddle on my new diet.  But just gotta keep working at getting
the bgs stable and ridding myself of nasty cholesterols!

Congratulations to your hard work :))

Wiser to eat less, down to the optimal amount rather than diet to lose
the harmful VAT that has caused your type-2 diabetes.

Good for her, LOL!!!!  But I do think you should get yourself something
that is meaningful to you.  I bought myself a new handbag that I had

My problem with exercise is that I find it terribly boring, so my
exercise is restricted to things that don't take long, or interesting
activities. So I did buy a pullup bar because they're cheap and it
takes me less than a minute to do my semi-daily pullups.

My most expensive and most successful exercise machine so far has been
a good digital camera. I've done more walking and cycling in pursuit
of photographs this year than for any other reason :-)

It really doesn't matter *what* gets you going as long as you go.

When I got kinda bored with just running around my own neighborhood, I took
up road racing, which got me running around a lot of other places (&amp; I
learned a lot more area roads to get there, too, even after living here for
many years -- I'd barely even heard of some of those places before....).

Right now I'm tired &amp; over-stressed on things so I'm just doing the local
nabe for a while -- but it's actually *interesting* when you haven't been
doing it 3x/week *all* the time.

Then there's the run/walk to somewhere to do errands &amp; then bus home
routine.
Whatever it takes....

I started using dumb bells, a starter set I got from a departing
ex-student. With the rapid improvement you sometimes get with a new
exercise I came to need an extra bigger weight disc for them. Since
there's not much to wear out in an iron plate with a hole in the
middle I checked out the local charity shops for second hand
plates. Quite a lot of dumb bells, but only the same stuff as I had
already.

So I checked out a local junkyard. Wow! What a bonanza! I could have
started my own body building gymnasium! In fact it looked as though
more than one local body building gymnasium must have either gone
bankrupt or decided to completely renew all its stock. And they had
enough stationary bikes to start your own racing team. They had more
exercise stuff than you could have carted away in one large truck. And
the prices of single dumb bell weight discs were so low I reluctantly
had to restrict my purchase to what I was actually physically able to
carry away :-)

Obviously complex exercise machines may wear out, but if all you're
after is stationary stuff with no moving parts like benches and
weights I recommend checking the local junkyards.
