1. The Most Powerful Women in IT

In anticipation of labor day, we'd like to salute some of the hardest
working people in IT.  These women, such as VMware chief Diane
Greene, became incredibly successful despite the large gender gap
inherent in the industry. And if you're wondering what happened to
some of our heroes of yesteryear, check out this update.

2. Gateway Deal Is Latest Manifestation of Chinese Ambitions

Acer's move to acquire Gateway gives the Taiwan-based PC maker a
chance to leap past Lenovo and threatening both Dell and
Hewlett-Packard in the worldwide market. The implications of this deal in
the channel are particularly interesting, given Gateway's direct sales
history and the fact that the managed services trend might spark a
resurgence among makers of white boxes. Meanwhile, Seagate is
dismissing reports that it too might be acquired by a company based in
mainland China.

3. Fix Is In For Pesky Vista Validation Problem

As Microsoft continues to take a pounding over Vista, the company
at least moved to fix a problem with its validation process that continues
to get less than stellar reviews from many users. For those considering
Vista, here are some tips; but in the meantime, all eyes are on the
forthcoming service pack one release for Vista.  Will SP1 give people
more reasons to run to rather than from Vista? Of course, every cloud
has a silver lining.  At least one independent software company touts the
ability to let users put the old Microsoft Office 2003 interface on top of
Microsoft Office 2007.
