Anime is a medium.  Your questions make as much sense as asking &quot;what do
we enjoy most about books?&quot; or &quot;what do we enjoy most about movies?&quot; -
the only reasonable response is to ask &quot;in which genre?&quot;

Yes.  Why do you care?  Stereotypes may be based on reality, but
they're not reality, any more than the map is the territory.  And the

It's not too late!  The usenet leg ends today, but the survey
will continue on the web leg for the next two weeks (there's
no difference other than I won't be posting boosters after
tonight).  I'll be posting a very short interim report
with the survey link tonight, if you've lost it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why do we enjoy it so?

I actually don't enjoy it as much as I used to but, when it was broadcast
during the 80s, it took a more mature and imaginative approach than the
farmed-out 'american animation' that was available at the time.  Even in
its edited form, Star Blazers/Space Cruiser Yamato was a breath of fresh
air.

Series and OAVs like Ranma 1/2, Mario M-66, (Demon Prince) Zenki and,
yes, ecchi series like Ultimate Girls have kept the spirit alive while
snorefests like a certain 'X' movie and Drag-on Brawl ZZZZZZ have
threatened to topple the towers, so to speak.

(Something tells the saying about how '90% of everything is crap' applies
even here) 9_9

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What do we enjoy most about anime?
">

Four words: Smoothness, story, risk-taking.

Compared to the childish nature of series like Inspector Gadget and Stunt
Dawgs, the anime I saw took a more 'mature' approach than most -
characters bled, suffered and died, women weren't always whiny victims
and the stories, particularly in Robotech/Macross eps, were cleverly
written if not epic in scope.

In fact, the only 'american' films and shorts I've seen that appear to
match or surpass those classics have been made/supervised by Timm/Dini
(Batman:TAS, Justice League, Batman Beyond), Brad Bird (the Family Dog
pilot), Ralph Bakshi (Spicy City, Wizards), Glenn Eichler (Daria) and
John Kricfalusi (the original Ren and Stimpy) and that should tell you
something about what's currently being tolerated by the current crop of
networks/viewers. 9_9

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Is there a particular stereotype of anime enthusiast?
">

If there is, I probably don't fit it, so to speak.

If people enjoy animation, whether it was made 'in-house' or farmed out,
why should those viewers be branded?

Animation, as a tool/medium, can entertain as well as educate.  It all
depends on who's guiding the pencil(s)/pixels/typewriter keys.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What draws us into the world so fervently?
">

There are several factors I could mention but I'll just say 'atmosphere'
and leave it at that. ~_^

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What is our favorite show?  Why?
">

I actually listed a few favorites up above but I'd be happy to go into
more detail. ^_^

Daria won my heart because of its wide variety of characters and the
acidic wit of its titular character and her friend.  Then again, being
well written didn't hurt either. ~_^

Batman: the Animated Series caught my eye because it offered a fresh
approach to DC's characters.  They were 'deeper' than the ones portrayed
in the cornball 'Adam West' vehicle and the fact that villains were
tragic victims of their oftentimes cruel world made us feel sorry for
them...almost.

Family Dog, when first introduced via the sci-fi series 'Amazing
Stories', added some much-needed grit to a medium almost destroyed by
WB's Bugs Bunny 'Specials'.

And Ren and Stimpy, well...was just plain funny. (before Sick-elodeon
fired their creator but that's ancient history)

I could wax poetic about how Spawn fanned the bat-flames and Zenki mixed
'fetishitic themes' with 'girl power' but I think you get the idea. ^_^

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Is there anything else you would like to add?
">

Just a 'paraphrase' to stir the pot - although it's wonderful that the
various studios are (taking a shot at) catering to their young audiance,
sooner or later, these viewers have to grow up and one can only hope that
the studios/networks will grow with them.  While fart jokes and bad
dialogue may appeal to some people, IMO, they're only the tip of the
iceberg.  There are a lot of brilliant and powerful stories one can tell
and dozens (if not hundreds) of paths one could explore all within the
prime-time/late-night time slots.

All one has to do is that that first (or is that fifth?) simple step...

*the writer feels the sole of a naked geisha's foot sink into his back*
*he shrieks in display of half-agony that quickly turns to exstacy*

Aaaah, that's the spot.

*the geisha bends down to give her customer a kiss on the cheek*

(Okay, I'm exagerating, but you get my point) }:^)

Starting from the top...

My favorite artistic medium is animation.  I mean, its got the big
draws of the motion picture (sound, music, and moving visuals),
except you don't have to depend on live sets or actors, but just
on whatever you can draw on the page.  You can literally create
any world you want.  Some of the most fascinating fictional
locales are animation.  the Third Earth of Thundercats for example.

Animation, of course, also allows you to break the rules a bit.
A show like Dragonball for example, simply wouldn't work in
live-action without looking dorky, as anyone who has seen a
Hong Kong action flick can tell you.

But, well, I live in America, and America really kind of wastes
the potential of the medium.  The last really mature, imaginative,
and well-written cartoon to come out of America was Filmation's
Bravestarr (I know some people would say the various DCAU
shows would count as well, but I'm not one of those people).
Other than that, most of the animation I would consider truly
good or great comes from out of the country.

Usually, from Japan.

Why Japan?  Well because, most other countries tend to
see animation the same way America does:  As being
primarily a repository for crappy humor shows, not as a
medium that can do action and drama.  Japan is the exact
opposite--they will, literally, do anything as a cartoon if they
think it'll make them some money.  So you get a diversity
of animation choices that really doesn't exist anywhere else.

In America, nowadays all you can get are lame cynical
humor shows like Billy and Mandy, or superheroes like
Ben 10 or the endless DC/Marvel tie-ins.  But Japan is
different.  Want an animated soap opera?  Japan's got it.
Want a show entirely about the everyday school life of an
average kid?  It happens.  I want to see an action story
where the hero actually DOESN'T win?  It happens.  And
as we all know, want to see an anime where mean and
terrible things are done to women of all ages (and sometimes,
species)?  Its out there.

And what's more, while Japan will compromise storytelling
for profits (like the case with Shaman King) they usually
still retain the best parts--anime and manga universes
are malleable, they change and evolve as things go on.

I know some anime is stagnant too, but most of it, or at
least most of the ones I'm watching, certainly aren't.
I've been watching Dragonball recently and its a good
case in point:  Goku trains his tail to not be his weakness
anymore (then has it cut off so he won't transform),
most of his enemies either die permanently or reform
and become good guys.  Instead of fighting the same
battles over and over, the Z-Fighters are always facing
new challenges (except Buu, who was kind of a
retread of Cell) and moving on to bigger and better
things.

Meanwhile, Batman is still fighting the diabolical plans
of the Penguin, still falling for the same n00bish &quot;OMG
someone snuck up behind me and knocked me out&quot;
traps that he's been falling for since the 1960s even
though he's supposed to be a super-sensitive trained-in-the
-arts-of-ninjutsu vigilante, still getting perplexed by the
same Riddler conundrums that he's been getting
perplexed by for a million years.  And all the while,
he catches the villains only for them to be free again
in the next episode, having made no notable change in
their mentality, personality, or tactics... or if they do
change, its only for one episode and they go back to
being bad again in the next one.  Sometimes they
even degrade from their original state--Mad Hatter
for example was originally motivated by love and
jealousy, but by the third boxed set he's just another
greedy bank robber (and--not to knock the tastes of
people who like this show--but THIS is everyone's
idea of &quot;mature storytelling&quot; with &quot;dynamic characters?&quot;)

Now, of course there are American cartoons that
don't suck, either because they lack that killer
stagnancy or because they have some other
quality that more than makes up for it.  Those
rare cartoons usually run a chance of standing
side-to-side with the best anime in my opinion.
However those kinds of cartoons are rarely made
here and there hasn't really been a great one in
almost eight years.  Anime however, even though
the discovery of the international market has forced
some dumbing-down on it, has yet to lose the
vital qualities of diversity and malleability.

You seem to have taken personally the complaint that we
aren't here to do your homework. The reason you hit that
reaction is because we do sometimes get people who are
here for work on a school project. The culture of this group
draws a distinction between personal and professional
posting, so it would have been better manners to state
your reason for seeking our opinions. Especially with an

I'm not defending Mr Schwartz' behaviour but you did ask some rather,
well, naive, and overgeneralized questions.  Some, not all.  I've
often been asked to add a gender question, but frankly every time
I attempt to do so, I feel too damn silly, so i delete it.  I wouldn't
mind adding questions along the lines you suggest, but I would be
a LOT more specific.  Part of the reason is that I KNOW that I won't
get much of a response if I a) leave them with open ended questions,
b) give them some idea of what kinds of responses are acceptable.
For example, to ask about political leanings and leave it at that
provides no context with regards to how you expect anime to fit into
the discussion.  This is further exacerbated by the sheer breadth
of anime, in all terms you attempted.  Asking what you did is like
asking why being alive is a good thing.  Or repeating just about
everything that has been discussed in this newsgroup for the last
15+ years.  (actually, you probably should go through the archives
of this newsgroup on Google, and any web forums that have archives)

Frankly, when I saw your first posting, I gave up right on the
spot because of the sheer magnitude of what you were asking, and
then gave up again because of the sheer diversity of responses I
expected to see and not really have an opinion one way or another,
and then gave up yet again when I realized how variable and diverse
any one topic was.  I mean, my mind boggled.  Really, at the back
of my mind, I think it occured to me that you were either an
overly-enthusiastic newbie to anime, or a student trying to write
a term paper on something she has no clue about and is grasping
for clues, and that may have contributed to my dismissing your
posting.  I assure you, though, it was mainly the sheer magnitude
that turned me off.

All I can suggest is that you find some way to work on each
piece of the puzzle, present some anime context in what you
ask, try to break up each piece into a number of even smaller
pieces that you can try to assemble at the end, and try to be
more specific.  That's if you are working on a term paper.
If all you want to do is start discussion, well,... I guess,...
same suggestion, other than &quot;assemble at the end&quot;.

Maybe you should mind your own damn business?  I'll take criticism
from Jen, if she can be bothered to provide any (so far, she hasn't);
I refuse to acknowledge your right to level any at me.  Her questions,
as asked, were inane to the point of being nearly unanswerable.  You
tried-- and good for you for trying.  However, I'm under no obligation
to, and refuse to be intimidated into attempting to make sense of what
was at the very least poorly-written gibberish.  The questions showed
very little interest in or knowledge of anime.  She had no history
posting here, as far as I could tell, and seemed to be interested only
in using the community to write what is likely to be a very lame
paper.  So she's contributing nothing, asking us to contribute a lot
(and that's just with trying to understand what she *really* wanted to
know, instead of what she actually asked-- nevermind actually
answering the questions), and doesn't even seem to care enough to try
to ask questions that could possible elicit any kind of interesting
discussion.

And, for what it's worth, please note that I actually provided her
with a reference to a decent survey that would provide her with a
great deal more interesting data along the lines of what she probably
wanted to ask, but couldn't be bothered to actually do so than she
could possibly gather from this newgroup alone, especially with such
an uninspiring attempt.  So kindly piss off with your pathetically
juvenile &quot;oh, if only everybody were nice, like me, you evil

No, being a thing pursued by geeks is why anime is seen as a geeky
thing.  Have you ever seen real fine art connoisseurs?  They're at
least thirty times as insecure and egotistical as any anime fan I've
ever met.  However, to pick an example at random, when they get
together to discuss fine art, most of them bathe beforehand.

Lack of egotism or insecurity is not, I promise you, a quick ticket to
being seen as an &quot;art medium&quot;.

Of course not.  I also don't expect them to ask me questions about

Actually, it was &quot;What do we enjoy most about anime?&quot; among other

we liked it.  I don't know her; I can't possibly answer.  In any

made up goofy words like 'seriouslessness', joked about anime fans
being pedophiles, poked a bit of fun at her poorly worded questions,

Actually no, there really isn't.  I like good stories, and I like them
in anime as well as other media.  There's nothing that makes me want
to experience any given story in anime form per se; it's just the
medium a lot (probably not even the majority) of the stories I like
come in.  I like maybe a half-dozen genres or so primarily, but as
long as it's a good story, I don't care if it's SF or S&amp;M.

Well, if I did take Jen's questions at face value, they'd be

Because we've discussed this question as a group practically to death
for, gosh, the last 15 years or so?  That's practically everybody's
first statement in this group after &quot;Hi, my name is $foo, and I'm an
anime fan.&quot;  (&quot;Hi, $foo!&quot;)  &quot;I like anime because....&quot;

&quot;Why, do we enjoy it so?&quot; is (in addition to being teeth-gratingly
punctuated) such a broadly general question that it doesn't give
people real meat to sink their teeth in.  Answers are likely to start
out fairly vague, and peter out quickly, especially since this is
(charitably speaking) not a new question to RAAM.  And lo, other than
your bitching at me (and I guess Derek, but I neither know, nor care,
what his motivations for responding were), that's pretty much what
happened.  I'm not surprised, but you sound as if you are.

Here's a much better question:

Do you prefer to watch SF in anime form, or live-action?  Which
medium do you think is better suited to the type of SF you like,
and why?  (If you don't like SF, feel free to substitute
&quot;romantic comedy&quot;, &quot;police drama&quot;, or whatever genres you
prefer.)

There's still no guarantee discussion will continue for a while, but
can't you see how that gives people a specific aspect of anime to
consider (as opposed to just &quot;why do you like it?&quot;), and helps focus
their responses towards a more specific answer that you can then ask
more probing questions about?  I don't know about you, but when asked
about specifics, I can often summon more (and hopefully more
interesting) details than if somebody goes for generalities.

(And personally, I find that for reasons I can't explain, good anime
SF tends to get more of the little details of world-building and
alien-ness than good live-action SF.  Not always, though-- B5 finally
(yaay!) got the physics of space combat closer to right than nearly
anyone since.  And there's lots and lots of drek-- if I must watch bad
SF, I'd rather watch bad live-action SF than bad anime.)

Yeah, you're right, Doctor.  So tell me, is that why I'm living alone

say &quot;hello&quot; to anyone in person, and practically breaking out in

Oh wait, none of that is true.

Hrm.

Maybe... nah, it couldn't be.  You're clearly a genius-level qualified
psychiatrist, capable of diagnosing my innermost feelings on the basis

Oddly enough, I find bitching about his using &quot;effing&quot; to be purile and
pathetic.  I'm sure someone will find my bitching about your bitching to be
purile and pathetic.

In then end, though, you're going apeshit over a stylistic difference.
Think about that for a while.

&gt; &gt; And here is the real problem.

&gt; &gt; Dude, why not just take the question at face value?
&gt; &gt; You're not a character in a Frank Herbert novel,
&gt; &gt; after all.  There aren't wheels within wheels.  If
&gt; &gt; someone asks &quot;why do you like anime?&quot;  She
&gt; &gt; probably MEANS &quot;why do you like anime?&quot;

&gt; Well, if I did take Jen's questions at face value, they'd be
&gt; impossible to answer, because she's asking about 'we' all the time,
&gt; and I don't know her from Eve.  You don't really mean 'take them at
&gt; face value'; you mean 'interpret them in the way I think they ought to
&gt; be interpreted'.  Which is fine. But don't pretend otherwise.
">

Maybe it is interpreting, but personally what you describe--
as per your constant mention of &quot;we&quot;--is what I call getting
hung up on form and semantics and missing the meaning
of the question.

When you get right down to it, the question really was just
&quot;why do you like anime?&quot;  Sure Jen didn't exactly word it
that way, but... Jen's new and, funny thing is, she's also
presumably a human being.  Guess what, human beings
don't always term and code their questions in a way where
it will be perfectly parsed.  Funnier thing, most human
beings don't exactly expect it or require it, either.  Humans
have this funny little capacity to make intuitive leaps and
subjective decisions.  That's why a human being makes a
better dungeon master than a computer.

So what's your deal?  Are you a robot or something?

Don't you remember the list I gave you seven years ago?

Phantom 2040
The Maxx
Gargoyles (78 episodes to choose from; 20 of them don't suck)
Exosquad
Extreme Ghostbusters
etc...

Add more to the list:
Jane &amp; the Dragon (New Zealand-Canada collaboration)
WITCH (for the man who loves Sailor Moon and Jem &lt;g&gt;)
Legend of Prince Valiant

&gt; I know some anime is stagnant too, but most of it, or at
&gt; least most of the ones I'm watching, certainly aren't.
&gt; I've been watching Dragonball recently and its a good
&gt; case in point:  Goku trains his tail to not be his weakness
&gt; anymore (then has it cut off so he won't transform),
&gt; most of his enemies either die permanently or reform
&gt; and become good guys.  Instead of fighting the same
&gt; battles over and over, the Z-Fighters are always facing
&gt; new challenges (except Buu, who was kind of a
&gt; retread of Cell) and moving on to bigger and better
&gt; things.

&gt; Meanwhile, Batman is still fighting the diabolical plans
&gt; of the Penguin, still falling for the same n00bish &quot;OMG
&gt; someone snuck up behind me and knocked me out&quot;
&gt; traps that he's been falling for since the 1960s even
&gt; though he's supposed to be a super-sensitive trained-in-the
&gt; -arts-of-ninjutsu vigilante, still getting perplexed by the
&gt; same Riddler conundrums that he's been getting
&gt; perplexed by for a million years.  And all the while,
&gt; he catches the villains only for them to be free again
&gt; in the next episode, having made no notable change in
&gt; their mentality, personality, or tactics... or if they do
&gt; change, its only for one episode and they go back to
&gt; being bad again in the next one.  Sometimes they
&gt; even degrade from their original state--Mad Hatter
&gt; for example was originally motivated by love and
&gt; jealousy, but by the third boxed set he's just another
&gt; greedy bank robber (and--not to knock the tastes of
&gt; people who like this show--but THIS is everyone's
&gt; idea of &quot;mature storytelling&quot; with &quot;dynamic characters?&quot;)
">

Since 1993, Batman has 150+ animated short stories with varying levels
of continuity.  The best episodes work as short stories, regardless of
how well they fit into any continuity.

I'd love to know how Batman n00bishness is more banal than Dragon Ball
Z's interchangable crew of beer-crushing meatheads?  Batman has its
issues, but at least its best episodes feature more psycologically
compelling characters than the animated equivalents of Hulk Hogan and
Cain.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now, of course there are American cartoons that
&gt; don't suck, either because they lack that killer
&gt; stagnancy or because they have some other
&gt; quality that more than makes up for it.  Those
&gt; rare cartoons usually run a chance of standing
&gt; side-to-side with the best anime in my opinion.
&gt; However those kinds of cartoons are rarely made
&gt; here and there hasn't really been a great one in
&gt; almost eight years.

A character doesn't have to have a huge therapy
bill or enough personality points to write a college
essay about in order to have fun adventures, but
it IS harder to care for a series when its obvious
that no matter what happens, nothing will change
(costume changes and &quot;decades into the future&quot;
plotlines notwithstanding) and everything will revert
to norm whenever it suits the writers.  Say watcha
want about DBZ but stagnancy is one flaw it
DOESN'T have (slow as hell plot advancement
maybe, but not stagnancy).

It's the journey that matters, not the destination.

A scenic tour that ends at the beginning is always more interesting to
me than a eyesore tour that ends in a wasteland :-)

So long as *I* grow as a viewer, I don't particularly care if the
*characters* do.  And even if I don't grow much, I always love to have
a good time.

More later, again.  Got American broadcst timeshifts to sample...

Terrence Briggs, watching Avatar ripoffs on broadcast TV.  Here's
hoping Digata Defenders and Magi-Nation don't suck.
