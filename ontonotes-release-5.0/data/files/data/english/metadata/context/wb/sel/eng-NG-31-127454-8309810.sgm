Ok, here's my attempt at the facts.

It took me two days to read this over again because I've been
documenting and classifying stuff as I went.  My most detailed notes
were ALL mentions of Snape that had anything to do with thoughts,
feelings, actions etc.  One or two only pages I left out where it just
mentioned he passed in the hall or something (nothing relevant to
annotate).  So everywhere Snape is mentioned is here and in the next
post.

So while doing so, I had five categories on my notepad.

1) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S EVIL DOINGS (To Harry et al)
2) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S HUMANITARIANISM
3) EVIDENCE OF FAIRNESS
4) EVIDENCE OF UNFAIRNESS
5) MISCELLANEOUS/WRONG EVIDENCE THAT SNAPE IS EVIL

Please Bear with me but this will be long and worth the read!  You
will see and weigh out where 95% at least of Snape's evilness is
nothing but a facade.  The proof is here (EVERY incident, no matter
how innocuous, I've included it).  with that said, here goes:
Please bear in mind as well:
By evil doings, I mean something that would endanger someone, kill
someone, be disloyal or illegal etc.
By Humanitarianism, I mean help, save or show compassion to someone
By fairness I mean how he's treating someone in compared to others and
By unfairness there is no obvious reason shown for him being mean or
unfair

I'll talk about the last and most interesting category in the next
post.

1) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S EVIL DOINGS
NOTHING.  There is not one reference in the book that Snape does
anything to harm anyone, kill anyone or even remotely put them in
jeopardy.  He's not pleasant, but nothing is shown for him to do
anything wrong that would hold up in a legal or moral court of law
either in a criminal or civil suit. I bow to anyone who PROVES it by
annotation from the book.

2) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S HUMANITARISM
a) P 139 Snape orders Neville to hospital wing after he melts
cauldron and boils on his nose.  (some people may argue he has to
because he's a teach so this may cancel itself out)
b) P 190 Snape is counter cursing (we later find out) Harry's
broom (Quidditch match) and on Page 289 Quirrell admits he was doing
the counter curse. He does this to save Harry.
c) P 289 It's revealed by Quirrell that Snape wanted to be
referee for the Quidditch match to protect Harry

3) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S FAIRNESS
a) P 136-138 Snape calls on him in class and he doesn't know the
answers.  Snape seems to be picking on him in Harry's view so Harry
quickly answers sarcastically &quot;I don't know sir, but I think Hermione
does&quot; &quot;Why don't you ask her&quot;.  Snape minus 1 point for &quot;cheek&quot;  ONE
point?  It's later revealed by Ron he takes lots of points from Fred
and George etc.  In my view this is fair and Harry was sarcastic.  I'd
of given Harry more than 1 point.  He WAS cheeky. Actually on the
subject of points from houses and points from Gryffindor, go back
through the book and total the number of points deducted from
Gryffindor from other professors.... it's MUCH less than Snape!
b) P 196 Malfoy insults Ron's family and Ron takes a swing at
Malfoy as Snape walks in.  Snape takes 5 points from Gryffindor for
fighting. He doesn't know what happened; it's right that he saw Ron
hitting someone and punished him; fighting actually deserves MORE than
5 points?  Detention perhaps or a letter home?
c) P 300 It is revealed that Snape detested James mostly for
saving his life; and he worked hard (Snape) all year to protect Harry
to return the favor (agreed selfish in a way because he wanted to feel
free of the burden of a debt owed) He's selfish, but he's being fair
in some sense; trying to even the score to his disadvantage; after
all, James is dead so this shows he's got some conscience.

4) EVIDENCE OF SNAPES UNFAIRNESS
a) P 139 Snape chastises Harry for standing next to Neville and
not helping him with the potion that landed him in the hospital and
deducts another point from Gryffindor. (actually this is justified
maybe; I mean he's possibly trying to teach the kids to help one
another here; so could actually go to the FAIR side, but I felt more
people would argue against this so I included it as being unfair)
b) P  182 Snape takes 5 points from Harry for having a library
book (Quidditch throughout the Ages) outside the school; which Ron
feels is a rule he made up (no proof of that; assumption and if an
actual rule, it again could go into the FAIR column but I knew people
would be whining so I put it here for the Snape nayers)
c) P 223 Snape awards Hufflepuff a penalty shot  because Fred and
George hit someone with a bludger and another penalty for no reason (
this is Harry's assessment which is clouded when it comes to Snape -
we can't be sure they didn't actually commit a foul so this could go
into the FAIR column as well)

So points so far.  BAD side
FACTUAL evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0.
POSSIBLE evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0
FACTUAL evidence that Snape was UNFAIR to the students in any way 0
POSSIBLE evidence Snape was unfair to Harry et al  3

So points so far GOOD side
FACTUAL evidence Snape showed some Humanitarianism 2
POSSIBLE evidence he showed Humanitarianism 1 (Neville to hospital)
FACTUAL evidence Snape FAIR 0
POSSIBLE Evidence he was fair 3

So  to the good side: Score 2 and 4 Possibles
So to the bad side: Score: 0 and 3 Possibles

the good side: Two HUGE Humanitarianism shows and 0 on the major
points where he's NOT nice in some way.  and 6-3 to the good side for
possibles.

This is just after Sorcerer's Stone.  What is your belief now?  Has it
changed any?  My guess is no.  People are solidified NO MATTER THE
EVIDENCE.

I will post the last thing in another post. I am quite anxious to see
what you say after this post and next.

Actually, that should have read (sorry typo) much MORE than Snape give
out.  As a matter of fact the points he deducts are like 1/10th of
what McGonagall does.

&gt; &gt;we can't be sure they didn't actually commit a foul so this could go

I think it is fair to say that Snape doesn't come out of Philosopher's
Stone too badly. At this point he  is merely a red herring to distract
attention from the real villain.

But begining in the second book, he is no longer a red herring and
becomes more of tyrant.

&gt;&gt; Ok, here's my attempt at the facts.

&gt;&gt; It took me two days to read this over again because I've been
&gt;&gt; documenting and classifying stuff as I went.  My most detailed notes
&gt;&gt; were ALL mentions of Snape that had anything to do with thoughts,
&gt;&gt; feelings, actions etc.  One or two only pages I left out where it just
&gt;&gt; mentioned he passed in the hall or something (nothing relevant to
&gt;&gt; annotate).  So everywhere Snape is mentioned is here and in the next
&gt;&gt; post.

&gt;&gt; So while doing so, I had five categories on my notepad.

&gt;&gt; 1) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S EVIL DOINGS (To Harry et al)
&gt;&gt; 2) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S HUMANITARIANISM
&gt;&gt; 3) EVIDENCE OF FAIRNESS
&gt;&gt; 4) EVIDENCE OF UNFAIRNESS
&gt;&gt; 5) MISCELLANEOUS/WRONG EVIDENCE THAT SNAPE IS EVIL

&gt;&gt; Please Bear with me but this will be long and worth the read!  You
&gt;&gt; will see and weigh out where 95% at least of Snape's evilness is
&gt;&gt; nothing but a facade.  The proof is here (EVERY incident, no matter
&gt;&gt; how innocuous, I've included it).  with that said, here goes:
&gt;&gt; Please bear in mind as well:
&gt;&gt; By evil doings, I mean something that would endanger someone, kill
&gt;&gt; someone, be disloyal or illegal etc.
&gt;&gt; By Humanitarianism, I mean help, save or show compassion to someone
&gt;&gt; By fairness I mean how he's treating someone in compared to others and
&gt;&gt; By unfairness there is no obvious reason shown for him being mean or
&gt;&gt; unfair

&gt;&gt; I'll talk about the last and most interesting category in the next
&gt;&gt; post.

&gt;&gt; 1) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S EVIL DOINGS
&gt;&gt;      NOTHING.  There is not one reference in the book that Snape does
&gt;&gt; anything to harm anyone, kill anyone or even remotely put them in
&gt;&gt; jeopardy.  He's not pleasant, but nothing is shown for him to do
&gt;&gt; anything wrong that would hold up in a legal or moral court of law
&gt;&gt; either in a criminal or civil suit. I bow to anyone who PROVES it by
&gt;&gt; annotation from the book.

&gt;&gt; 2) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S HUMANITARISM
&gt;&gt;      a) P 139 Snape orders Neville to hospital wing after he melts
&gt;&gt; cauldron and boils on his nose.  (some people may argue he has to
&gt;&gt; because he's a teach so this may cancel itself out)
&gt;&gt;      b) P 190 Snape is counter cursing (we later find out) Harry's
&gt;&gt; broom (Quidditch match) and on Page 289 Quirrell admits he was doing
&gt;&gt; the counter curse. He does this to save Harry.
&gt;&gt;      c) P 289 It's revealed by Quirrell that Snape wanted to be
&gt;&gt; referee for the Quidditch match to protect Harry

&gt;&gt; 3) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S FAIRNESS
&gt;&gt;      a) P 136-138 Snape calls on him in class and he doesn't know the
&gt;&gt; answers.  Snape seems to be picking on him in Harry's view so Harry
&gt;&gt; quickly answers sarcastically &quot;I don't know sir, but I think Hermione
&gt;&gt; does&quot; &quot;Why don't you ask her&quot;.  Snape minus 1 point for &quot;cheek&quot;  ONE
&gt;&gt; point?  It's later revealed by Ron he takes lots of points from Fred
&gt;&gt; and George etc.  In my view this is fair and Harry was sarcastic.  I'd
&gt;&gt; of given Harry more than 1 point.  He WAS cheeky. Actually on the
&gt;&gt; subject of points from houses and points from Gryffindor, go back
&gt;&gt; through the book and total the number of points deducted from
&gt;&gt; Gryffindor from other professors.... it's MUCH less than Snape!
&gt;&gt;     b) P 196 Malfoy insults Ron's family and Ron takes a swing at
&gt;&gt; Malfoy as Snape walks in.  Snape takes 5 points from Gryffindor for
&gt;&gt; fighting. He doesn't know what happened; it's right that he saw Ron
&gt;&gt; hitting someone and punished him; fighting actually deserves MORE than
&gt;&gt; 5 points?  Detention perhaps or a letter home?
&gt;&gt;      c) P 300 It is revealed that Snape detested James mostly for
&gt;&gt; saving his life; and he worked hard (Snape) all year to protect Harry
&gt;&gt; to return the favor (agreed selfish in a way because he wanted to feel
&gt;&gt; free of the burden of a debt owed) He's selfish, but he's being fair
&gt;&gt; in some sense; trying to even the score to his disadvantage; after
&gt;&gt; all, James is dead so this shows he's got some conscience.

&gt;&gt; 4) EVIDENCE OF SNAPES UNFAIRNESS
&gt;&gt;       a) P 139 Snape chastises Harry for standing next to Neville and
&gt;&gt; not helping him with the potion that landed him in the hospital and
&gt;&gt; deducts another point from Gryffindor. (actually this is justified
&gt;&gt; maybe; I mean he's possibly trying to teach the kids to help one
&gt;&gt; another here; so could actually go to the FAIR side, but I felt more
&gt;&gt; people would argue against this so I included it as being unfair)
&gt;&gt;       b) P  182 Snape takes 5 points from Harry for having a library
&gt;&gt; book (Quidditch throughout the Ages) outside the school; which Ron
&gt;&gt; feels is a rule he made up (no proof of that; assumption and if an
&gt;&gt; actual rule, it again could go into the FAIR column but I knew people
&gt;&gt; would be whining so I put it here for the Snape nayers)
&gt;&gt;      c) P 223 Snape awards Hufflepuff a penalty shot  because Fred and
&gt;&gt; George hit someone with a bludger and another penalty for no reason (
&gt;&gt; this is Harry's assessment which is clouded when it comes to Snape -
&gt;&gt; we can't be sure they didn't actually commit a foul so this could go
&gt;&gt; into the FAIR column as well)

&gt;&gt; So points so far.  BAD side
&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0.
&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0
&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence that Snape was UNFAIR to the students in any way 0
&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence Snape was unfair to Harry et al  3

&gt;&gt; So points so far GOOD side
&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape showed some Humanitarianism 2
&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence he showed Humanitarianism 1 (Neville to hospital)
&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape FAIR 0
&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE Evidence he was fair 3

&gt;&gt; So  to the good side: Score 2 and 4 Possibles
&gt;&gt; So to the bad side: Score: 0 and 3 Possibles

&gt;&gt; the good side: Two HUGE Humanitarianism shows and 0 on the major
&gt;&gt; points where he's NOT nice in some way.  and 6-3 to the good side for
&gt;&gt; possibles.

&gt;&gt; This is just after Sorcerer's Stone.  What is your belief now?  Has it
&gt;&gt; changed any?  My guess is no.  People are solidified NO MATTER THE
&gt;&gt; EVIDENCE.

&gt;&gt; I will post the last thing in another post. I am quite anxious to see

&gt;It´s amazing work, Sue!! I´m sure when DH is out we will all find he
&gt;is all good and really helping DD defeat Voldemort!!

&gt;Oh wait, we already know that... :]
">

Well, I want to go book by book.  And I really want to see where he's
evil and unfair and mean as people say.  Result of my work (and I
missed nothing)... he wasn't at all.  Not one time in book one.  So at
that point, really it was all a facade.  If you read my second post
about snape, you will see how the audience is taken for a ride only
because they are taken by Harry's perceptions

Snape was healing some of the other students in later books; he
probably could have healed Neville.  I'd have to look at what else
was going on to try to guess why Snape chose to send Neville to the
hospital wing.  (My first guess is that when a first-year does
something like that, it's school policy to send them to the hospital
wing if only so they learn to take accidents seriously.)

A non-P.C. reason for punishing physical fighting in a magical school:
they are supposed to be learning to use their magic!  Though it is
also true that they are not supposed to use their wands at all in the
hallways (but it's okay outdoors?) so the teachers can control the
potential damage.

The supposed selfish motive strengthens the evidence that the

I think it's possible that it was a backhanded way to indicate that
helping each other is normally allowed.  Snape's better teaching is
usually done backhanded, as in a later scene when he docks Hermione
for helping Neville: it points out to the class loud and clear that
the class snob and outcast, Hermione, helped another student.

I was a pro-Snaper anyway, so no change here.  Still, Philosopher's/Sorcerer's
Stone was written to allow for the possibility that it would fail and no others
would be published, and it is the most 'children's book' style even of the
first three books which together would make a decent trilogy.

&gt;&gt;1) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S EVIL DOINGS (To Harry et al)
&gt;&gt;2) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S HUMANITARIANISM
&gt;&gt;3) EVIDENCE OF FAIRNESS
&gt;&gt;4) EVIDENCE OF UNFAIRNESS
&gt;&gt;5) MISCELLANEOUS/WRONG EVIDENCE THAT SNAPE IS EVIL

&gt;&gt; 95% at least of Snape's evilness is nothing but a facade.
&gt;&gt;The proof is here (EVERY incident, no matter
&gt;&gt;how innocuous, I've included it).

&gt;&gt;By evil doings, I mean something that would endanger someone, kill
&gt;&gt;someone, be disloyal or illegal etc.
&gt;&gt;By Humanitarianism, I mean help, save or show compassion to someone
&gt;&gt;By fairness I mean how he's treating someone in compared to others and
&gt;&gt;By unfairness there is no obvious reason shown for him being mean or
&gt;&gt;unfair

&gt;&gt;I'll talk about the last and most interesting category in the next
&gt;&gt;post.

&gt;&gt;1) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S EVIL DOINGS
&gt;&gt;     NOTHING.  There is not one reference in the book that Snape does
&gt;&gt;anything to harm anyone, kill anyone or even remotely put them in
&gt;&gt;jeopardy.  He's not pleasant, but nothing is shown for him to do
&gt;&gt;anything wrong that would hold up in a legal or moral court of law
&gt;&gt;either in a criminal or civil suit. I bow to anyone who PROVES it by
&gt;&gt;annotation from the book.

&gt;&gt;2) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S HUMANITARISM
&gt;&gt;     a) P 139 Snape orders Neville to hospital wing after he melts
&gt;&gt;cauldron and boils on his nose.  (some people may argue he has to
&gt;&gt;because he's a teach so this may cancel itself out)

&gt;Snape was healing some of the other students in later books; he
&gt;probably could have healed Neville.  I'd have to look at what else
&gt;was going on to try to guess why Snape chose to send Neville to the
&gt;hospital wing.  (My first guess is that when a first-year does
&gt;something like that, it's school policy to send them to the hospital
&gt;wing if only so they learn to take accidents seriously.)

&gt;&gt;     b) P 190 Snape is counter cursing (we later find out) Harry's
&gt;&gt;broom (Quidditch match) and on Page 289 Quirrell admits he
&gt;[Snape that is]
&gt;&gt;was doing the counter curse. He does this to save Harry.
&gt;&gt;     c) P 289 It's revealed by Quirrell that Snape wanted to be
&gt;&gt;referee for the Quidditch match to protect Harry

&gt;&gt;3) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S FAIRNESS
&gt;&gt;     a) P 136-138 Snape calls on him in class and he doesn't know the
&gt;&gt;answers.  Snape seems to be picking on him in Harry's view so Harry
&gt;&gt;quickly answers sarcastically &quot;I don't know sir, but I think Hermione
&gt;&gt;does&quot; &quot;Why don't you ask her&quot;.  Snape minus 1 point for &quot;cheek&quot;  ONE
&gt;&gt;point?  It's later revealed by Ron he takes lots of points from Fred
&gt;&gt;and George etc.  In my view this is fair and Harry was sarcastic.  I'd
&gt;&gt;of given Harry more than 1 point.  He WAS cheeky. Actually on the
&gt;&gt;subject of points from houses and points from Gryffindor, go back
&gt;&gt;through the book and total the number of points deducted from
&gt;&gt;Gryffindor from other professors.... it's MUCH
&gt;[typo fix]
&gt;&gt; MORE than Snape give out.  As a matter of fact the points he deducts
&gt;&gt;are like 1/10th of what McGonagall does.
&gt;&gt;    b) P 196 Malfoy insults Ron's family and Ron takes a swing at
&gt;&gt;Malfoy as Snape walks in.  Snape takes 5 points from Gryffindor for
&gt;&gt;fighting. He doesn't know what happened; it's right that he saw Ron
&gt;&gt;hitting someone and punished him; fighting actually deserves MORE than
&gt;&gt;5 points?  Detention perhaps or a letter home?

&gt;A non-P.C. reason for punishing physical fighting in a magical school:
&gt;they are supposed to be learning to use their magic!  Though it is
&gt;also true that they are not supposed to use their wands at all in the
&gt;hallways (but it's okay outdoors?) so the teachers can control the
&gt;potential damage.

&gt;&gt;     c) P 300 It is revealed that Snape detested James mostly for
&gt;&gt;saving his life; and he worked hard (Snape) all year to protect Harry
&gt;&gt;to return the favor (agreed selfish in a way because he wanted to feel
&gt;&gt;free of the burden of a debt owed) He's selfish, but he's being fair
&gt;&gt;in some sense; trying to even the score to his disadvantage; after
&gt;&gt;all, James is dead so this shows he's got some conscience.

&gt;The supposed selfish motive strengthens the evidence that the
&gt;actual behavior was positive and real; he wasn't doing it to convince
&gt;Harry of anything positive.

&gt;&gt;4) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S UNFAIRNESS
&gt;&gt;      a) P 139 Snape chastises Harry for standing next to Neville and
&gt;&gt;not helping him with the potion that landed him in the hospital and
&gt;&gt;deducts another point from Gryffindor. (actually this is justified
&gt;&gt;maybe; I mean he's possibly trying to teach the kids to help one
&gt;&gt;another here; so could actually go to the FAIR side, but I felt more
&gt;&gt;people would argue against this so I included it as being unfair)

&gt;I think it's possible that it was a backhanded way to indicate that
&gt;helping each other is normally allowed.  Snape's better teaching is
&gt;usually done backhanded, as in a later scene when he docks Hermione
&gt;for helping Neville: it points out to the class loud and clear that
&gt;the class snob and outcast, Hermione, helped another student.

&gt;&lt;snip to prove I can&gt;

&gt;&gt;     c) P 223 Snape awards Hufflepuff a penalty shot  because Fred and
&gt;&gt;George hit someone with a bludger and another penalty for no reason (
&gt;&gt;this is Harry's assessment which is clouded when it comes to Snape -
&gt;&gt;we can't be sure they didn't actually commit a foul so this could go
&gt;&gt;into the FAIR column as well)

&gt;Sports decisions are always contestable among teenagers...

&gt;&gt; points so far.  BAD side
&gt;&gt;FACTUAL evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0.
&gt;&gt;POSSIBLE evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0
&gt;&gt;FACTUAL evidence that Snape was UNFAIR to the students in any way 0
&gt;&gt;POSSIBLE evidence Snape was unfair to Harry et al  3

&gt;&gt; points so far GOOD side
&gt;&gt;FACTUAL evidence Snape showed some Humanitarianism 2
&gt;&gt;POSSIBLE evidence he showed Humanitarianism 1 (Neville to hospital)
&gt;&gt;FACTUAL evidence Snape FAIR 0
&gt;&gt;POSSIBLE Evidence he was fair 3

&gt;&gt;So  to the good side: Score 2 and 4 Possibles
&gt;&gt;So to the bad side: Score: 0 and 3 Possibles

&gt;&gt;the good side: Two HUGE Humanitarianism shows and 0 on the major
&gt;&gt;points where he's NOT nice in some way.  and 6-3 to the good side for
&gt;&gt;possibles.

&gt;&gt;This is just after Sorcerer's Stone.  What is your belief now?  Has it
&gt;&gt;changed any?  My guess is no.  People are solidified NO MATTER THE
&gt;&gt;EVIDENCE.

&gt;I was a pro-Snaper anyway, so no change here.  Still, Philosopher's/Sorcerer's
&gt;Stone was written to allow for the possibility that it would fail and no others
&gt;would be published, and it is the most 'children's book' style even of the
&gt;first three books which together would make a decent trilogy.

&gt;&gt;I will post the last thing in another post. I am quite anxious to see
&gt;&gt;what you say after this post and next.

&gt;Wow.  Thanks for all the work you put in.

&gt;=Tamar
">

Thanks; I think a lot of what said is not based on facts. I like
laying it out.  I've made other lists as I was going which I may
comment no sometime waaay later like lists of what wands were made of,
all the gifts Harry got, all the creatures in order of mention,
deaths, uses of underage magic and mention of anything remotely
Christian/Religion related, Dudley nicknames, possible curse words, a
list of certain numbers and a couple interesting sentences.

If anyone wants these before I read the next book, just holler.

&gt;&gt; It´s amazing work, Sue!! I´m sure when DH is out we will all find he
&gt;&gt; is all good and really helping DD defeat Voldemort!!

&gt;&gt; Oh wait, we already know that... :]

&gt; Well, I want to go book by book.  And I really want to see where he's
&gt; evil and unfair and mean as people say.  Result of my work (and I
&gt; missed nothing)... he wasn't at all.  Not one time in book one.  So at
&gt; that point, really it was all a facade.  If you read my second post
&gt; about snape, you will see how the audience is taken for a ride only
&gt; because they are taken by Harry's perceptions

How about his outright assaults on Harry during his Occulmency sessions?
What about intentionally destroying his classwork in many cases?  What
about his verbal assaults on Harry, and others?  He is a sick, sad, and
antisocial personality.

That's true, but would he on his own do it, if he wouldn't get into

And the bond was not transferable, as JK pointed out.  Snape chose to
repay the debt to James' son of his own accord, based in his inner
sense of fairness.  James saved me.  I got him killed.  I owe it to
him to protect Harry (well, Lily too, but there two independent reason

I dunno about point taking, but definitely chastising is

Easily checked out if such a rule exists.  If so, can a teacher deduct
for library matters?

Cours,e one must throw in tougher on non Slytherins, which are usually
more points that one would normally do.

Yes, but as the books go on, Snape does get worse.  Still, they all
pale in comparison to the risk taken to spy on Voldemort.

In the end, Snape's probably just barely more good than evil.  But
still good.  And a jerk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; answers.  Snape seems to be picking on him in Harry's view so Harry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quickly answers sarcastically &quot;I don't know sir, but I think Hermione
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does&quot; &quot;Why don't you ask her&quot;.  Snape minus 1 point for &quot;cheek&quot;  ONE
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point?  It's later revealed by Ron he takes lots of points from Fred
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and George etc.  In my view this is fair and Harry was sarcastic.  I'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of given Harry more than 1 point.  He WAS cheeky. Actually on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; subject of points from houses and points from Gryffindor, go back
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through the book and total the number of points deducted from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gryffindor from other professors.... it's MUCH less than Snape!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     b) P 196 Malfoy insults Ron's family and Ron takes a swing at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Malfoy as Snape walks in.  Snape takes 5 points from Gryffindor for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fighting. He doesn't know what happened; it's right that he saw Ron
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hitting someone and punished him; fighting actually deserves MORE than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 points?  Detention perhaps or a letter home?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      c) P 300 It is revealed that Snape detested James mostly for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; saving his life; and he worked hard (Snape) all year to protect Harry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to return the favor (agreed selfish in a way because he wanted to feel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; free of the burden of a debt owed) He's selfish, but he's being fair
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in some sense; trying to even the score to his disadvantage; after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all, James is dead so this shows he's got some conscience.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4) EVIDENCE OF SNAPES UNFAIRNESS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       a) P 139 Snape chastises Harry for standing next to Neville and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not helping him with the potion that landed him in the hospital and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deducts another point from Gryffindor. (actually this is justified
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; maybe; I mean he's possibly trying to teach the kids to help one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another here; so could actually go to the FAIR side, but I felt more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people would argue against this so I included it as being unfair)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       b) P  182 Snape takes 5 points from Harry for having a library
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; book (Quidditch throughout the Ages) outside the school; which Ron
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feels is a rule he made up (no proof of that; assumption and if an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actual rule, it again could go into the FAIR column but I knew people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be whining so I put it here for the Snape nayers)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      c) P 223 Snape awards Hufflepuff a penalty shot  because Fred and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; George hit someone with a bludger and another penalty for no reason (
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this is Harry's assessment which is clouded when it comes to Snape -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we can't be sure they didn't actually commit a foul so this could go
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into the FAIR column as well)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So points so far.  BAD side
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence that Snape was UNFAIR to the students in any way 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence Snape was unfair to Harry et al  3

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So points so far GOOD side
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape showed some Humanitarianism 2
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence he showed Humanitarianism 1 (Neville to hospital)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape FAIR 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE Evidence he was fair 3

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So  to the good side: Score 2 and 4 Possibles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So to the bad side: Score: 0 and 3 Possibles

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the good side: Two HUGE Humanitarianism shows and 0 on the major
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; points where he's NOT nice in some way.  and 6-3 to the good side for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibles.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is just after Sorcerer's Stone.  What is your belief now?  Has it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; changed any?  My guess is no.  People are solidified NO MATTER THE
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; EVIDENCE.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I will post the last thing in another post. I am quite anxious to see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what you say after this post and next.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It´s amazing work, Sue!! I´m sure when DH is out we will all find he
&gt;&gt;&gt; is all good and really helping DD defeat Voldemort!!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh wait, we already know that... :]

&gt;&gt; Well, I want to go book by book.  And I really want to see where he's
&gt;&gt; evil and unfair and mean as people say.  Result of my work (and I
&gt;&gt; missed nothing)... he wasn't at all.  Not one time in book one.  So at
&gt;&gt; that point, really it was all a facade.  If you read my second post
&gt;&gt; about snape, you will see how the audience is taken for a ride only
&gt;&gt; because they are taken by Harry's perceptions

&gt;How about his outright assaults on Harry during his Occulmency sessions?
&gt;  What about intentionally destroying his classwork in many cases?  What
&gt;about his verbal assaults on Harry, and others?  He is a sick, sad, and
&gt;antisocial personality.
">

I did stipulate at the beginning of the post I thought this was SS/PS
only.  I will go book by book and assess as I go, proving what Snape
is by only facts.  So far, the conclusion after book one, is that
there is NO WAY he's even close to evil.  the most that anyone can say
by preponderance of factual evidence given, is that three times he
MIGHT possibly have been unfair in the taking away a couple house
points.  Which I have shown he was more than fair in doing and
actually took less away than any other professor.  In book one, we
didn't even see a detention.  Yet we see two distinct acts of
humanitarianism in him and 16-17 unjustly accusations by students that
he's mean/evil.  Those are PROVEN by the end of book one.

So those who said he was evil by this time; I think you may need to
reconsider your stance.  Now, next up (may take a while for me to read
as next three days I'll be busy) COS.  The Snape watch will continue.
Muhahahahha.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, here's my attempt at the facts.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It took me two days to read this over again because I've been
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; documenting and classifying stuff as I went.  My most detailed notes
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; were ALL mentions of Snape that had anything to do with thoughts,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; feelings, actions etc.  One or two only pages I left out where it just
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; mentioned he passed in the hall or something (nothing relevant to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; annotate).  So everywhere Snape is mentioned is here and in the next
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; post.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So while doing so, I had five categories on my notepad.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 1) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S EVIL DOINGS (To Harry et al)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 2) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S HUMANITARIANISM
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 3) EVIDENCE OF FAIRNESS
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 4) EVIDENCE OF UNFAIRNESS
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 5) MISCELLANEOUS/WRONG EVIDENCE THAT SNAPE IS EVIL

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Please Bear with me but this will be long and worth the read!  You
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; will see and weigh out where 95% at least of Snape's evilness is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nothing but a facade.  The proof is here (EVERY incident, no matter
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; how innocuous, I've included it).  with that said, here goes:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Please bear in mind as well:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; By evil doings, I mean something that would endanger someone, kill
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; someone, be disloyal or illegal etc.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; By Humanitarianism, I mean help, save or show compassion to someone
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; By fairness I mean how he's treating someone in compared to others and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; By unfairness there is no obvious reason shown for him being mean or
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; unfair

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I'll talk about the last and most interesting category in the next
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; post.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 1) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S EVIL DOINGS
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      NOTHING.  There is not one reference in the book that Snape does
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; anything to harm anyone, kill anyone or even remotely put them in
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; jeopardy.  He's not pleasant, but nothing is shown for him to do
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; anything wrong that would hold up in a legal or moral court of law
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; either in a criminal or civil suit. I bow to anyone who PROVES it by
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; annotation from the book.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 2) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S HUMANITARISM
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      a) P 139 Snape orders Neville to hospital wing after he melts
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; cauldron and boils on his nose.  (some people may argue he has to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; because he's a teach so this may cancel itself out)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      b) P 190 Snape is counter cursing (we later find out) Harry's
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; broom (Quidditch match) and on Page 289 Quirrell admits he was doing
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the counter curse. He does this to save Harry.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      c) P 289 It's revealed by Quirrell that Snape wanted to be
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; referee for the Quidditch match to protect Harry

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 3) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S FAIRNESS
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      a) P 136-138 Snape calls on him in class and he doesn't know the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; answers.  Snape seems to be picking on him in Harry's view so Harry
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; quickly answers sarcastically &quot;I don't know sir, but I think Hermione
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; does&quot; &quot;Why don't you ask her&quot;.  Snape minus 1 point for &quot;cheek&quot;  ONE
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; point?  It's later revealed by Ron he takes lots of points from Fred
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and George etc.  In my view this is fair and Harry was sarcastic.  I'd
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of given Harry more than 1 point.  He WAS cheeky. Actually on the

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; through the book and total the number of points deducted from
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Gryffindor from other professors.... it's MUCH less than Snape!
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;     b) P 196 Malfoy insults Ron's family and Ron takes a swing at
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Malfoy as Snape walks in.  Snape takes 5 points from Gryffindor for
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; fighting. He doesn't know what happened; it's right that he saw Ron
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; hitting someone and punished him; fighting actually deserves MORE than
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 points?  Detention perhaps or a letter home?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      c) P 300 It is revealed that Snape detested James mostly for
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; saving his life; and he worked hard (Snape) all year to protect Harry
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to return the favor (agreed selfish in a way because he wanted to feel
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; free of the burden of a debt owed) He's selfish, but he's being fair
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in some sense; trying to even the score to his disadvantage; after

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; not helping him with the potion that landed him in the hospital and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; deducts another point from Gryffindor. (actually this is justified
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; maybe; I mean he's possibly trying to teach the kids to help one

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; people would argue against this so I included it as being unfair)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;       b) P  182 Snape takes 5 points from Harry for having a library

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; feels is a rule he made up (no proof of that; assumption and if an
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; actual rule, it again could go into the FAIR column but I knew people
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; would be whining so I put it here for the Snape nayers)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      c) P 223 Snape awards Hufflepuff a penalty shot  because Fred and

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; we can't be sure they didn't actually commit a foul so this could go
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; into the FAIR column as well)

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So points so far.  BAD side
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence that Snape was UNFAIR to the students in any way 0
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence Snape was unfair to Harry et al  3

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So points so far GOOD side
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape showed some Humanitarianism 2
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence he showed Humanitarianism 1 (Neville to hospital)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape FAIR 0
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE Evidence he was fair 3

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So  to the good side: Score 2 and 4 Possibles
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So to the bad side: Score: 0 and 3 Possibles

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the good side: Two HUGE Humanitarianism shows and 0 on the major
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; points where he's NOT nice in some way.  and 6-3 to the good side for
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; possibles.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; This is just after Sorcerer's Stone.  What is your belief now?  Has it

&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh wait, we already know that... :]

&gt; &gt; Well, I want to go book by book.  And I really want to see where he's
&gt; &gt; evil and unfair and mean as people say.  Result of my work (and I

&gt;   What about intentionally destroying his classwork in many cases?  What
&gt; about his verbal assaults on Harry, and others?  He is a sick, sad, and
&gt; antisocial personality.
">

IMHO, what you´re both missing is the very fact that makes Snape
interesting: he´s one of the few, or maybe even the only,
tridimensional character in the books. You´re trying to classify him
in good or bad, hero or evil, when there´s much more to Snape than
just that.

Again just my opinion, the reason he´s mean in small, unimportant
things like house points is that it serves as a relief valve for the
highly stressful double-agent job he´s got himself into. As Voldemort
returns, this stress mounts, so it´s pretty consistent that he does no
great harm to the students is PS/SS, COS and PoA, but starts to get
more snappy from GoF on.

Another duality regards just Harry: he sees him first as James´ son,
so tends to give vent to his frustrations when in class (or in the
Occlumency sessions.) However, in life-threatening situations, his
love for Lily´s son comes first and he protects him.

That he isn´t the most adequate Potions teacher around is easily
acceptable; Trelawney is no academic wonder herself. Both ended up
teaching in Hogwarts, protected by DD, mainly due their position
regarding LV, not because of their skill in handling the students.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; into the FAIR column as well)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So points so far.  BAD side
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence that Snape was UNFAIR to the students in any way 0
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence Snape was unfair to Harry et al  3

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So points so far GOOD side
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape showed some Humanitarianism 2
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence he showed Humanitarianism 1 (Neville to hospital)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape FAIR 0
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE Evidence he was fair 3

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So  to the good side: Score 2 and 4 Possibles
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So to the bad side: Score: 0 and 3 Possibles

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the good side: Two HUGE Humanitarianism shows and 0 on the major
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; points where he's NOT nice in some way.  and 6-3 to the good side for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; possibles.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; This is just after Sorcerer's Stone.  What is your belief now?  Has it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; changed any?  My guess is no.  People are solidified NO MATTER THE
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; EVIDENCE.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I will post the last thing in another post. I am quite anxious to see
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; what you say after this post and next.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It´s amazing work, Sue!! I´m sure when DH is out we will all find he
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is all good and really helping DD defeat Voldemort!!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh wait, we already know that... :]

&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, I want to go book by book.  And I really want to see where he's
&gt;&gt; &gt; evil and unfair and mean as people say.  Result of my work (and I
&gt;&gt; &gt; missed nothing)... he wasn't at all.  Not one time in book one.  So at
&gt;&gt; &gt; that point, really it was all a facade.  If you read my second post
&gt;&gt; &gt; about snape, you will see how the audience is taken for a ride only
&gt;&gt; &gt; because they are taken by Harry's perceptions

&gt;&gt; How about his outright assaults on Harry during his Occulmency sessions?
&gt;&gt;   What about intentionally destroying his classwork in many cases?  What
&gt;&gt; about his verbal assaults on Harry, and others?  He is a sick, sad, and
&gt;&gt; antisocial personality.

&gt;IMHO, what you´re both missing is the very fact that makes Snape
&gt;interesting: he´s one of the few, or maybe even the only,
&gt;tridimensional character in the books. You´re trying to classify him
&gt;in good or bad, hero or evil, when there´s much more to Snape than
&gt;just that.
">

In this first book though, there's not much more to him.  Only the
thing with James saving his life is something exposed.  Other than
that, all we know is he's a sort of mean teacher and he's curiously
watched over Harry at least twice.  Those are the facts.  There's
really nothing more to him in this book I see.  Perhaps later on he
develops more.  In this book there is one perception of him:  Harry's
view which is that Snape is evil, up to stuff and out to do him in and
oh, he looks bad.  Other than that, we know nothing of his
relationships, family, friends, history, or have even seen his
hobbies, office or anything!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Again just my opinion, the reason he´s mean in small, unimportant
&gt;things like house points is that it serves as a relief valve for the
&gt;highly stressful double-agent job he´s got himself into. As Voldemort
&gt;returns, this stress mounts, so it´s pretty consistent that he does no
&gt;great harm to the students is PS/SS, COS and PoA, but starts to get
&gt;more snappy from GoF on.
">

I saw the house points things as a means of showing his teacher
authority (he doesn't want anyone to think of him as anything less
than brave and respect his teaching abilities).  He does the points to
show authority only.  He isn't using house points to validate V at
this point. IS he a double agent? Seems so because he's watching over
Harry at this point.  He doesn't realize V is back though does he?
No.  so he's protecting Harry long before he's a double agent!  That
does tell you about his character slightly.  I can't wait to do an
assessment on his acts for the next books.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Another duality regards just Harry: he sees him first as James´ son,
&gt;so tends to give vent to his frustrations when in class (or in the
&gt;Occlumency sessions.) However, in life-threatening situations, his
&gt;love for Lily´s son comes first and he protects him.
">

that's very observant. I'll be happy to read on and note if that's
dead on (I suspect so).

&gt;&gt; 2) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S HUMANITARISM
&gt;&gt;     a) P 139 Snape orders Neville to hospital wing after he melts

&gt;&gt; because he's a teach so this may cancel itself out)

&gt; That's true, but would he on his own do it, if he wouldn't get into
&gt; trouble for it?  That's the big question.  One thing to mock Hermione
&gt; on her teeth, another to let a kid be disfigured.

&gt;&gt; 3) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S FAIRNESS
&gt;&gt;    b) P 196 Malfoy insults Ron's family and Ron takes a swing at
&gt;&gt; Malfoy as Snape walks in.  Snape takes 5 points from Gryffindor for
&gt;&gt; fighting. He doesn't know what happened; it's right that he saw Ron
&gt;&gt; hitting someone and punished him; fighting actually deserves MORE than
&gt;&gt; 5 points?  Detention perhaps or a letter home?
&gt;&gt;     c) P 300 It is revealed that Snape detested James mostly for
&gt;&gt; saving his life; and he worked hard (Snape) all year to protect Harry
&gt;&gt; to return the favor (agreed selfish in a way because he wanted to feel
&gt;&gt; free of the burden of a debt owed) He's selfish, but he's being fair
&gt;&gt; in some sense; trying to even the score to his disadvantage; after
&gt;&gt; all, James is dead so this shows he's got some conscience.

&gt; And the bond was not transferable, as JK pointed out.  Snape chose to
&gt; repay the debt to James' son of his own accord, based in his inner
&gt; sense of fairness.  James saved me.  I got him killed.  I owe it to
&gt; him to protect Harry (well, Lily too, but there two independent reason
&gt; resulting in the same outcome.)

&gt;&gt; 4) EVIDENCE OF SNAPES UNFAIRNESS
&gt;&gt;      a) P 139 Snape chastises Harry for standing next to Neville and
&gt;&gt; not helping him with the potion that landed him in the hospital and
&gt;&gt; deducts another point from Gryffindor. (actually this is justified
&gt;&gt; maybe; I mean he's possibly trying to teach the kids to help one
&gt;&gt; another here; so could actually go to the FAIR side, but I felt more
&gt;&gt; people would argue against this so I included it as being unfair)

&gt; I dunno about point taking, but definitely chastising is
&gt; understandable, if he brings up the importance of helping.

&gt;&gt;      b) P  182 Snape takes 5 points from Harry for having a library
&gt;&gt; book (Quidditch throughout the Ages) outside the school; which Ron
&gt;&gt; feels is a rule he made up (no proof of that; assumption and if an
&gt;&gt; actual rule, it again could go into the FAIR column but I knew people
&gt;&gt; would be whining so I put it here for the Snape nayers)

&gt; Easily checked out if such a rule exists.  If so, can a teacher deduct
&gt; for library matters?

&gt; Cours,e one must throw in tougher on non Slytherins, which are usually
&gt; more points that one would normally do.

&gt;&gt; This is just after Sorcerer's Stone.  What is your belief now?  Has it
&gt;&gt; changed any?  My guess is no.  People are solidified NO MATTER THE
&gt;&gt; EVIDENCE.

&gt;&gt; I will post the last thing in another post. I am quite anxious to see
&gt;&gt; what you say after this post and next.

&gt; Yes, but as the books go on, Snape does get worse.  Still, they all
&gt; pale in comparison to the risk taken to spy on Voldemort.

&gt; In the end, Snape's probably just barely more good than evil.  But
&gt; still good.  And a jerk.
">

The old saying;
There is so much bad in the best of us,
and so much good in the worst of us,
That it ill behooves any of us to judge
The rest of us.
(Ben Franklin, I believe).

Still, while on the side of the light, Snape was a very dark shade of gray.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It took me two days to read this over again because I've been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documenting and classifying stuff as I went.  My most detailed notes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were ALL mentions of Snape that had anything to do with thoughts,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feelings, actions etc.  One or two only pages I left out where it just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mentioned he passed in the hall or something (nothing relevant to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; annotate).  So everywhere Snape is mentioned is here and in the next
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; post.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So while doing so, I had five categories on my notepad.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S EVIL DOINGS (To Harry et al)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S HUMANITARIANISM
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) EVIDENCE OF FAIRNESS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4) EVIDENCE OF UNFAIRNESS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5) MISCELLANEOUS/WRONG EVIDENCE THAT SNAPE IS EVIL

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please Bear with me but this will be long and worth the read!  You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will see and weigh out where 95% at least of Snape's evilness is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing but a facade.  The proof is here (EVERY incident, no matter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how innocuous, I've included it).  with that said, here goes:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please bear in mind as well:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By evil doings, I mean something that would endanger someone, kill
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; someone, be disloyal or illegal etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By Humanitarianism, I mean help, save or show compassion to someone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By fairness I mean how he's treating someone in compared to others and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By unfairness there is no obvious reason shown for him being mean or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unfair

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll talk about the last and most interesting category in the next
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; post.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S EVIL DOINGS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      NOTHING.  There is not one reference in the book that Snape does
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything to harm anyone, kill anyone or even remotely put them in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jeopardy.  He's not pleasant, but nothing is shown for him to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything wrong that would hold up in a legal or moral court of law
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; either in a criminal or civil suit. I bow to anyone who PROVES it by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; annotation from the book.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S HUMANITARISM
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      a) P 139 Snape orders Neville to hospital wing after he melts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cauldron and boils on his nose.  (some people may argue he has to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because he's a teach so this may cancel itself out)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      b) P 190 Snape is counter cursing (we later find out) Harry's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; broom (Quidditch match) and on Page 289 Quirrell admits he was doing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the counter curse. He does this to save Harry.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      c) P 289 It's revealed by Quirrell that Snape wanted to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; referee for the Quidditch match to protect Harry

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S FAIRNESS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      a) P 136-138 Snape calls on him in class and he doesn't know the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; answers.  Snape seems to be picking on him in Harry's view so Harry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quickly answers sarcastically &quot;I don't know sir, but I think Hermione
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does&quot; &quot;Why don't you ask her&quot;.  Snape minus 1 point for &quot;cheek&quot;  ONE
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point?  It's later revealed by Ron he takes lots of points from Fred
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and George etc.  In my view this is fair and Harry was sarcastic.  I'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of given Harry more than 1 point.  He WAS cheeky. Actually on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; subject of points from houses and points from Gryffindor, go back
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through the book and total the number of points deducted from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gryffindor from other professors.... it's MUCH less than Snape!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     b) P 196 Malfoy insults Ron's family and Ron takes a swing at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Malfoy as Snape walks in.  Snape takes 5 points from Gryffindor for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fighting. He doesn't know what happened; it's right that he saw Ron
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hitting someone and punished him; fighting actually deserves MORE than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 points?  Detention perhaps or a letter home?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      c) P 300 It is revealed that Snape detested James mostly for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; saving his life; and he worked hard (Snape) all year to protect Harry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to return the favor (agreed selfish in a way because he wanted to feel

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feels is a rule he made up (no proof of that; assumption and if an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actual rule, it again could go into the FAIR column but I knew people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be whining so I put it here for the Snape nayers)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      c) P 223 Snape awards Hufflepuff a penalty shot  because Fred and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; George hit someone with a bludger and another penalty for no reason (
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this is Harry's assessment which is clouded when it comes to Snape -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we can't be sure they didn't actually commit a foul so this could go
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into the FAIR column as well)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So points so far.  BAD side
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence that Snape was UNFAIR to the students in any way 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence Snape was unfair to Harry et al  3

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So points so far GOOD side
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape showed some Humanitarianism 2
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence he showed Humanitarianism 1 (Neville to hospital)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape FAIR 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE Evidence he was fair 3

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So  to the good side: Score 2 and 4 Possibles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So to the bad side: Score: 0 and 3 Possibles

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the good side: Two HUGE Humanitarianism shows and 0 on the major
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; points where he's NOT nice in some way.  and 6-3 to the good side for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibles.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; EVIDENCE.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It´s amazing work, Sue!! I´m sure when DH is out we will all find he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is all good and really helping DD defeat Voldemort!!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh wait, we already know that... :]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, I want to go book by book.  And I really want to see where he's
&gt;&gt;&gt; evil and unfair and mean as people say.  Result of my work (and I
&gt;&gt;&gt; missed nothing)... he wasn't at all.  Not one time in book one.  So at

&gt;&gt;  What about intentionally destroying his classwork in many cases?  What
&gt;&gt; about his verbal assaults on Harry, and others?  He is a sick, sad, and
&gt;&gt; antisocial personality.

&gt; I did stipulate at the beginning of the post I thought this was SS/PS
&gt; only.  I will go book by book and assess as I go, proving what Snape
&gt; is by only facts.  So far, the conclusion after book one, is that
&gt; there is NO WAY he's even close to evil.  the most that anyone can say
&gt; by preponderance of factual evidence given, is that three times he
&gt; MIGHT possibly have been unfair in the taking away a couple house
&gt; points.  Which I have shown he was more than fair in doing and
&gt; actually took less away than any other professor.  In book one, we
&gt; didn't even see a detention.  Yet we see two distinct acts of
&gt; humanitarianism in him and 16-17 unjustly accusations by students that
&gt; he's mean/evil.  Those are PROVEN by the end of book one.

&gt; So those who said he was evil by this time; I think you may need to
&gt; reconsider your stance.  Now, next up (may take a while for me to read
&gt; as next three days I'll be busy) COS.  The Snape watch will continue.
&gt; Muhahahahha.
">

I don't think it was in book 1, but sometimes he takes points off for
Harry breathing.  Does that strike you as fair?  Or do all the other
students suspend respiration during Potions?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      a) P 136-138 Snape calls on him in class and he doesn't know the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; answers.  Snape seems to be picking on him in Harry's view so Harry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quickly answers sarcastically &quot;I don't know sir, but I think Hermione
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does&quot; &quot;Why don't you ask her&quot;.  Snape minus 1 point for &quot;cheek&quot;  ONE
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point?  It's later revealed by Ron he takes lots of points from Fred
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and George etc.  In my view this is fair and Harry was sarcastic.  I'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of given Harry more than 1 point.  He WAS cheeky. Actually on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; subject of points from houses and points from Gryffindor, go back
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through the book and total the number of points deducted from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gryffindor from other professors.... it's MUCH less than Snape!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     b) P 196 Malfoy insults Ron's family and Ron takes a swing at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Malfoy as Snape walks in.  Snape takes 5 points from Gryffindor for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fighting. He doesn't know what happened; it's right that he saw Ron
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hitting someone and punished him; fighting actually deserves MORE than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 points?  Detention perhaps or a letter home?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      c) P 300 It is revealed that Snape detested James mostly for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; saving his life; and he worked hard (Snape) all year to protect Harry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to return the favor (agreed selfish in a way because he wanted to feel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; free of the burden of a debt owed) He's selfish, but he's being fair
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in some sense; trying to even the score to his disadvantage; after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all, James is dead so this shows he's got some conscience.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4) EVIDENCE OF SNAPES UNFAIRNESS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       a) P 139 Snape chastises Harry for standing next to Neville and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not helping him with the potion that landed him in the hospital and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deducts another point from Gryffindor. (actually this is justified
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; maybe; I mean he's possibly trying to teach the kids to help one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another here; so could actually go to the FAIR side, but I felt more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people would argue against this so I included it as being unfair)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       b) P  182 Snape takes 5 points from Harry for having a library
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; book (Quidditch throughout the Ages) outside the school; which Ron
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feels is a rule he made up (no proof of that; assumption and if an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actual rule, it again could go into the FAIR column but I knew people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be whining so I put it here for the Snape nayers)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      c) P 223 Snape awards Hufflepuff a penalty shot  because Fred and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; George hit someone with a bludger and another penalty for no reason (
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this is Harry's assessment which is clouded when it comes to Snape -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we can't be sure they didn't actually commit a foul so this could go
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into the FAIR column as well)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So points so far.  BAD side
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence Snape meant to harm/kill anyone in any way 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence that Snape was UNFAIR to the students in any way 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence Snape was unfair to Harry et al  3

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So points so far GOOD side
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape showed some Humanitarianism 2
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE evidence he showed Humanitarianism 1 (Neville to hospital)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FACTUAL evidence Snape FAIR 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE Evidence he was fair 3

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So  to the good side: Score 2 and 4 Possibles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So to the bad side: Score: 0 and 3 Possibles

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the good side: Two HUGE Humanitarianism shows and 0 on the major
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; points where he's NOT nice in some way.  and 6-3 to the good side for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibles.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is just after Sorcerer's Stone.  What is your belief now?  Has it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; changed any?  My guess is no.  People are solidified NO MATTER THE
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; EVIDENCE.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I will post the last thing in another post. I am quite anxious to see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what you say after this post and next.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It´s amazing work, Sue!! I´m sure when DH is out we will all find he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is all good and really helping DD defeat Voldemort!!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh wait, we already know that... :]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, I want to go book by book.  And I really want to see where he's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evil and unfair and mean as people say.  Result of my work (and I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; missed nothing)... he wasn't at all.  Not one time in book one.  So at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that point, really it was all a facade.  If you read my second post
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about snape, you will see how the audience is taken for a ride only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because they are taken by Harry's perceptions

&gt;&gt;&gt; How about his outright assaults on Harry during his Occulmency sessions?
&gt;&gt;&gt;  What about intentionally destroying his classwork in many cases?  What
&gt;&gt;&gt; about his verbal assaults on Harry, and others?  He is a sick, sad, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; antisocial personality.

&gt;&gt; I did stipulate at the beginning of the post I thought this was SS/PS
&gt;&gt; only.  I will go book by book and assess as I go, proving what Snape
&gt;&gt; is by only facts.  So far, the conclusion after book one, is that
&gt;&gt; there is NO WAY he's even close to evil.  the most that anyone can say
&gt;&gt; by preponderance of factual evidence given, is that three times he
&gt;&gt; MIGHT possibly have been unfair in the taking away a couple house
&gt;&gt; points.  Which I have shown he was more than fair in doing and
&gt;&gt; actually took less away than any other professor.  In book one, we
&gt;&gt; didn't even see a detention.  Yet we see two distinct acts of
&gt;&gt; humanitarianism in him and 16-17 unjustly accusations by students that
&gt;&gt; he's mean/evil.  Those are PROVEN by the end of book one.

&gt;&gt; So those who said he was evil by this time; I think you may need to
&gt;&gt; reconsider your stance.  Now, next up (may take a while for me to read
&gt;&gt; as next three days I'll be busy) COS.  The Snape watch will continue.
&gt;&gt; Muhahahahha.

&gt;I don't think it was in book 1, but sometimes he takes points off for
&gt;Harry breathing.  Does that strike you as fair?  Or do all the other
&gt;students suspend respiration during Potions?
">

Well, I'll let you know when I get there.  Probably not.  We shall see
though... I'll be totally like I did for the first one. I won't
interject personal thoughts and try to slant them. I'll document proof
with quotes and page numbers.

The problem with this argument is that it only holds up if this is a
one book deal, which it isn't.

We do know that Snape turns out to be good. But we don't know for sure
until the end of book 7 *because* of all the things that happen before
book 7.

At the end of book 1, we aren't supposed to think that Snape is bad.
That doubt is supposed to creep back in later.

And during that doubtful time, we are to look back and know that Snape
could have been behaving himself because Voldemort was assumed to be
dead. Exactly what he told Bellatrix.

Actually Snape was evil *before* the books started. The actual
question that we had (until the end of book 7) was whether he stayed
evil, or truly repented.

&gt; &gt;&gt; about his verbal assaults on Harry, and others?  He is a sick, sad, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; antisocial personality.

&gt; &gt;IMHO, what you´re both missing is the very fact that makes Snape
&gt; &gt;interesting: he´s one of the few, or maybe even the only,
&gt; &gt;tridimensional character in the books. You´re trying to classify him
&gt; &gt;in good or bad, hero or evil, when there´s much more to Snape than
&gt; &gt;just that.

&gt; In this first book though, there's not much more to him.  Only the
&gt; thing with James saving his life is something exposed.  Other than
&gt; that, all we know is he's a sort of mean teacher and he's curiously
&gt; watched over Harry at least twice.  Those are the facts.  There's
&gt; really nothing more to him in this book I see.  Perhaps later on he
&gt; develops more.  In this book there is one perception of him:  Harry's
&gt; view which is that Snape is evil, up to stuff and out to do him in and
&gt; oh, he looks bad.  Other than that, we know nothing of his
&gt; relationships, family, friends, history, or have even seen his
&gt; hobbies, office or anything!

&gt; &gt;Again just my opinion, the reason he´s mean in small, unimportant
&gt; &gt;things like house points is that it serves as a relief valve for the
&gt; &gt;highly stressful double-agent job he´s got himself into. As Voldemort
&gt; &gt;returns, this stress mounts, so it´s pretty consistent that he does no
&gt; &gt;great harm to the students is PS/SS, COS and PoA, but starts to get
&gt; &gt;more snappy from GoF on.

&gt; I saw the house points things as a means of showing his teacher
&gt; authority (he doesn't want anyone to think of him as anything less
&gt; than brave and respect his teaching abilities).  He does the points to
&gt; show authority only.  He isn't using house points to validate V at
&gt; this point. IS he a double agent? Seems so because he's watching over
&gt; Harry at this point.  He doesn't realize V is back though does he?
&gt; No.  so he's protecting Harry long before he's a double agent!  That
&gt; does tell you about his character slightly.  I can't wait to do an
&gt; assessment on his acts for the next books.

&gt; &gt;Another duality regards just Harry: he sees him first as James´ son,
&gt; &gt;so tends to give vent to his frustrations when in class (or in the
&gt; &gt;Occlumency sessions.) However, in life-threatening situations, his
&gt; &gt;love for Lily´s son comes first and he protects him.

&gt; that's very observant. I'll be happy to read on and note if that's
&gt; dead on (I suspect so).

&gt; &gt;That he isn´t the most adequate Potions teacher around is easily
&gt; &gt;acceptable; Trelawney is no academic wonder herself. Both ended up
&gt; &gt;teaching in Hogwarts, protected by DD, mainly due their position
&gt; &gt;regarding LV, not because of their skill in handling the students.

&gt; He's not?  I thought he was one of the best at potions?  I never got
&gt; Trelawaney.  Why they gave her CLASSES to teach is beyond me. I
&gt; understand why DD wanted her in the school (so she's not accidentally
&gt; be in public and do another prophecy incident) but to dumb down the
&gt; kids like that?  Maybe she should've been there more as an
&gt; after-school club thing or something.  Seems like a waste of
&gt; education?
">

I´ll bottom post all the way, tell us if it´s any better to you. BTW,
thanks for the kind comments!

About Snape being a double-agent, he was before Harry was attacked and
still is even in PS/SS, since DD didn´t believed Voldemort vanquished
for good. So Snape had to keep to his disguise, as close to DD as
possible, without revealling himself as anti-V.

One thing about your analysis is that doing it book-by-book isn´t
exactly the same as chronologically, since there are events we only
learn about in later books. And it becomes a little fragmented, since
the series *are* the seven books combined. Of course Snape can´t be
shown in his dual entirety as early as PS/SS, lots of potion must pass
beneath the bridge for that. :)

And notice I said adequate *teacher*, not adequate potitioner. Being a
teacher involves more than being good at the subject. Oh well, that´s
50% better than Sybill, I guess...

&gt;Thanks; I think a lot of what said is not based on facts. I like
&gt;laying it out.  I've made other lists as I was going which I may
&gt;comment on sometime waaay later like lists of what wands were made of,
&gt;all the gifts Harry got, all the creatures in order of mention,
&gt;deaths, uses of underage magic and mention of anything remotely
&gt;Christian/Religion related, Dudley nicknames, possible curse words, a
&gt;list of certain numbers and a couple interesting sentences.

&gt;If anyone wants these before I read the next book, just holler.

That kind of list has been on various websites such as
Mugglenet, The Leaky Cauldron, the Hogwarts Library, etc.
Of course you may have noticed something the others didn't,
but mostly they've been done - except for maybe the &quot;certain
numbers&quot;.  We haven't really discussed magical numbers in any
depth because most of us get distraced when JKR picks numbers
with magical meaning instead of bothering to make the math work.

Trelawney is in Hogwarts to protect her from Voldemort's
DEs.  She was hired immediately after the prophecy was
overheard by someone DD at least knew had been friends
with people who became DEs.  It was during the first Voldemort
War.  After Voldemort was AKed by bouncing off Harry the
first time, there were still vicious attacks by DEs - the
Longbottoms are only one example.   Also, DD had heard
the full prophecy, and he seemed to think that it hadn't
yet come true.  If V was going to come back, then Trelawney
would be in danger again.

Even when it seemed quiet, Dumbledore was still planning
for a defense against a return of Voldemort.  Meanwhile,
Trelawney served a purpose, just not the one she thought
she was hired for.  Dumbledore didn't believe in her
regular fortunetelling, but he believed in letting students
figure things out for themselves.  The best way to debunk
Trelawney's usual stuff was to let her do it, let the kids
be bored and sneer, and let the other teachers do the damage
control for the most egregious &quot;predictions&quot;.

&gt;Ok, here's my attempt at the facts.

&gt;It took me two days to read this over again because I've been
&gt;documenting and classifying stuff as I went.  My most detailed notes
&gt;were ALL mentions of Snape that had anything to do with thoughts,
&gt;feelings, actions etc.  One or two only pages I left out where it just
&gt;mentioned he passed in the hall or something (nothing relevant to
&gt;annotate).  So everywhere Snape is mentioned is here and in the next
&gt;post.

&gt;So while doing so, I had five categories on my notepad.

&gt;1) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S EVIL DOINGS (To Harry et al)
&gt;2) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S HUMANITARIANISM
&gt;3) EVIDENCE OF FAIRNESS
&gt;4) EVIDENCE OF UNFAIRNESS
&gt;5) MISCELLANEOUS/WRONG EVIDENCE THAT SNAPE IS EVIL

&gt;Please Bear with me but this will be long and worth the read!  You
&gt;will see and weigh out where 95% at least of Snape's evilness is
&gt;nothing but a facade.  The proof is here (EVERY incident, no matter
&gt;how innocuous, I've included it).  with that said, here goes:
&gt;Please bear in mind as well:
&gt;By evil doings, I mean something that would endanger someone, kill
&gt;someone, be disloyal or illegal etc.
&gt;By Humanitarianism, I mean help, save or show compassion to someone
&gt;By fairness I mean how he's treating someone in compared to others and
&gt;By unfairness there is no obvious reason shown for him being mean or
&gt;unfair

&gt;I'll talk about the last and most interesting category in the next
&gt;post.

&gt;1) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S EVIL DOINGS
&gt;     NOTHING.  There is not one reference in the book that Snape does
&gt;anything to harm anyone, kill anyone or even remotely put them in
&gt;jeopardy.  He's not pleasant, but nothing is shown for him to do
&gt;anything wrong that would hold up in a legal or moral court of law
&gt;either in a criminal or civil suit. I bow to anyone who PROVES it by
&gt;annotation from the book.
">

Do you remember the Shrieking Shack incident in PoA?  Not the movie
version, but the book version, in which Snape was virtually drooling
at the mouth with glee to feed his old schoolboy rival, Sirius, to the
Dementors?  And while he was at it, he seemed to be hoping that they
would soul-suck Lupin as well...   I'd call a fate worth than death
&quot;harm&quot;, wouldn't you?  (Sirius and Lupin were only saved because the
trio blasted Snape.)

&gt;&quot;harm&quot;, wouldn't you?  (Sirius and Lupin were only saved because the

And he was quite deliberately sending an innocent man to that fate
despite knowing by then that Peter was alive.

In fairness to Snape, we should point out that he did not really
*know* that Sirius was innocent. And his reasoning in this matter may
have been a little deranged, since for 13 years he has been thinking
that Sirius helped kill Lily.

But he *heard* the entire conversation between Sirius and Lupin so it
wouldn't have taken extra seconds to prove the rat was Peter...
instead he chose to want him dead!!

Hi

In most of the English speaking world, the first book is called The
Philosophers Stone, so the confusion is understandable. Whenever I see
SS, I think of Severus Snape, so the title of the thread did seem
initially confusing. I believe the title was changed for the US market
as it was felt that the term wouldn't be understood there and
therefore the book wouldn't sell. I have since read that JKR regrets
having to change this.

In terms of the thread, which I have read, I agree completely, however
I think that Severus was written to generate a hatred amongst the
readership - a character we (and Harry) loved to hate. It took me
until HBP to come round to the belief that SS was not a slimy toad!!

My bad; I forgot the PS/SS. Sorry for the confusion.  I've read 3/4 of
COS and will finish it later today.  Will post probably tomorrow the
breakdown of COS as far as Snape goes (admitting here it's a little
more convoluted this time); but still, the breakdown is interesting
none-the-less.  I hope as it goes on, I don't come to a conclusion
that changes my opinion of Snape because I just love the bad guys.
Actually I have a thing for Lucsious Lucious too!

Harry didn't love to hate him; Snape kept him alive, but he made his
life as miserable as he could.  I remember a fanfic in which Lupin -
before accepting be the DADA teacher - ask DD if Harry has a nemesis, as
James had Snape and DD answered that he had Severus Snape himself.
Although James probably liked to have someone like him, Definitely Harry
didn't. OTOH, for Harry is easier to blame Snape.

Actually, Snape didn't make his life much more miserable than other
student (except looking at him mean or calling on him more often in
class or quick to find Harry doing something cheeky or wrong to give
him detention).  He never gave Harry a detention he didn't earn really
and his homework piles were even to everyone.  Filch gave him just as
bad detention things to do, Umbridge was FAR worse and the Dursley's
treated Harry WAY worse than Snape ever did?  Just my assessment.  I
find no acts that hurt Harry in any way physically or psychologically,
while I find Voldermort, Umbridge and the Dursley's did.
