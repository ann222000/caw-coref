Pomegranate wine update

I started 2.6 gallons of pomegrantate wine (from pure juice) back on Dec
23. Starting data were 1.09SG, 0.65TA, and 72°F. The fermentation has slowed
considerably, but is still creating little islands of bubbles on the
surface. I drew out some product this afternoon and it tested out at 1.01SG
so it seems to be working well. I ran out of whatchamacallit so I couldn't
do an acid test. The new kit is due in on UPS any day now -- meanwhile I'm
going to let it bubble a while longer.
For information, raw pomegranate juice is low in sugar and high in
acid(TA). I had to add three pounds of sugar and 0.4 gallons of water to get
the starting numbers above. The sample I drew out tasted harsh as expected
but not unpleasant, and had a definite pomegranate flavor.
My intention is to rack it next weekend if the SG drives below 1.0. All
my reading says it will take a year to really develop [patience,
grasshopper!] and I'll wait till then to figure out what to do about
sweetness.
While I'm waiting, I think I'll do up a batch of Merlot. Any suggestions
on kit sources?

Casey,
This is helpful information, thanks for sharing. Keep us informed. I
love pomegranate juice and sparkling juice, so was thinking about making
some wine. This will help me out as you document your experience. thanks.
DAve
p.s. I don't like Merlot, so can't recommend a kit. It's odd, I've done
just about ever other kind of kit and like them all, but Merlot is like
the only wine I don't like. :*) I start a WinExpert Selection Estates
Lodi Ranch 11 Cab Sauv. kit tomorrow. Kinda their high end Cab kit. I've
never been disappointed with WinExpert kits, especially their high end
ones. I am going to pick up a Ice Wine kit of theirs next week, once my
local supply house gets more in.

Are you looking to make a 'good drinking wine' or an artisan wine?

If the latter, for Merlot I like to stay away from Central Valley
California (Lodi, Modesto, Madera, Fresno, etc. grapes).  To me, this is
a delicate enough grape that it's worth the extra money to buy top
quality grapes that come from areas with cool nights.  Have you
considered buying from Brehm ( www.brehmvineyards.com)? They have both
Sonoma Valley and Napa Valley merlot frozen grapes available.  That
would be my first choice.  Are you comfortable buying just the frozen
grapes and making your own wine from scratch?

This year the sugars from here (I live in Sonoma Valley) were a little
high at optimal acid balance, so if you want to keep maximum flavor
you'll have higher alcohol (14.4-15.1%v/v)[suggest ferment with Bordeaux
BDX yeast].  You could blend later with a lower alcohol cabernet franc
wine to bring down the alcohol and round out the flavor.

Or you could dilute the must down to 24.5-25.0 deg Brix and be willing
to have a little less varietal flavor [suggest ferment with D254 to have
a little less complex flavor but enhanced mouth feel].

Or choose door #3, split the batch and ferment half each way, then blend
later for an in-between style (my personal choice even though it's more
work).

Gene brings up a valid point, it depends on your tastes.  I make very
few wines other than the ones Gene mentions shying away from though.  I
make table wine, its made to complement regular home cooking, not
something you would see on 'Iron Chef'.  That said, I'll put my Lasagna
up against anybody and we drink our reds with it.

If you like big powerful wines stay away from lower cost juice or
grapes, they make medium bodied wines at best.  On the other hand, they
are easier to drink  and are usually considered more approachable.
They are also good wines to learn with because you have less money tied
up in them.

I don't think powerful wines have a place in everyday drinking but that
is just my opinion and that changes with time too.  Some day I will
quit giving most of it away and buy some of the better grapes Gene
mentions.  I do make northeastern reds from grapes, but they are not
premium grapes either.

I like your response, Joe.

May I piggyback your astute observation?
Also, I changed the subject heading to be relevant to this discussion,
hoping that more people will express interest in this subject.  I
probably should have done that in my initial response, cuz I veered way
off from pomegranate wine.

For approachability to the average wine drinker, even the commercial
Sonoma Valley medium body wines made from the premium grapes outsell
artisan wines by a huge margin.

In my initial response, I was painting with a narrow brush, in that
Merlot is a particularly delicate flavor red wine grape. Even the
'unbig' Merlot wines benefit a lot in the complexity (interest factor)
from high quality grapes.
In mentioning the Brehm grapes, I was lamenting the high sugar this year
(i.e. high potential alcohol).  Merlot doesn't stand up very well to
high alcohol.  Diluting it with water to get the alcohol down is a big
loss, in my opinion.  I would rather get Sonoma Valley Merlot grapes
harvested at 24.5-25.0 deg Brix.

Hopefully, over the next couple of years there might be more Merlot
grapes available nationwide to home winemakers at competitive prices
from here in Sonoma Valley.  This harvest, we had a significant amount
of unpicked Merlot grapes due to a large amount of new vines coming to
maturity. The wineries had bought all they needed...   Should be good
for everyone.

Joe - I'm a big fan of homemade Italian red sauces...we make a pretty good
one here at my house.  I'd like to try yours if you will post your recipe.
Thanks.
