Excerpts from Business Week magazine -

=============================

Last year the post office passed a worrisome milestone - for the first
time, first-class mail shrank in both volume and revenues.
Since first-class mail has long made up over half of USPS revenues,
fears are growing that it's only a matter of time before total
revenues start to shrink.

If so, the ever-growing tide of discounted junk mail won't be
sufficient to buoy USPS. Unable to cut costs fast enough to stay
afloat, the post office would have to accelerate rate increases. That
might cause big mailers to move to alternatives even faster,
triggering a spiral of falling revenues, rising debt, and declining
service.

Because of its universal service obligation - it must serve 1.8
million new addresses every year - USPS has limited room to maneuver.
These days just 5% of mail goes from consumer to consumer. USPS has
been shedding 1-2 billion pieces of first-class mail per year since
2000.

So far the post office has kept its head above water by improving
efficiency, cutting costs, and concentrating on growth in advertising
mail. So-called standard mail - advertisements, catalogs, and
circulars - is approaching the volume of first-class mail.

Trouble is, on average, each piece of standard mail earns the post
office about half as much as a similar piece of first-class mail. The
Postal Service has been quickly evolving into a commercial advertising
medium that also carries some first-class mail.

Cost cuts have helped bolster USPS operating finances so that it has
the leeway to postpone a rate increase until 2007. But Congress is
forcing an accelerated rate hike by insisting that USPS stash $3.1
billion from its overfunded pension pool in an escrow account.
Insiders contend that, strapped for cash, the White House is eyeing
this money to help cushion the ballooning deficit.

So, in mid-March, USPS announced a two-cent increase for first-class
postage and a 5-6% markup for other forms of postage that would take
effect in 2006.

Some in Congress would like to grant the post office more autonomy. A
set of bills in the House and Senate would, among other things, grant
USPS greater flexibility to hitch its rate increases to inflation.
Postmaster General John Potter would also like more case-by-case
freedom, so the post office could compete with private entities by
offering discounts to volume mailers, for example. Despite support for
the bills, the complex political calculus of the deficit makes passage
uncertain.

&quot;Things may just continue as they are,&quot; says Gene Del Polito,
president of the Association for Postal Commerce, &quot;till a real crisis
starts.&quot;

Such a crisis may be just what some critics of USPS are hoping for. It
would provide ammunition to those who want to break up the USPS mail
monopoly, on the model of Germany, Britain, and the Netherlands. If
revenues start to plummet, they reason, more competition may be the
only way to save billions of dollars.

In the U.S., demonopolizing is politically explosive. If mail is left
to market forces, rural, sparsely populated - and mostly Republican -
areas are the least likely to be served.

"/> The USPS is moving to automation and cutting costs, but a lot more can
surely be done:

Ever watch the line of customers in the PO as they walk up to the
clerks.

I would say 60-75% of them have silly requests or ask for services
that they can easily do themselves. I have seen clerks provide free
boxes, packing tape, and indeed even help pack a customers items.
Some people spend extra time just picking out pretty stamps. Many are
told to completely fill out the forms and then come back in line.

If you are organized, 9 out of 10 times you can use the automated
machine or the Internet to print your own postage and do not need to
go through a postal clerk.

I agree. I have stood in long lines at the PO just to see people ask
for stupid things they could have done themselves. I can't imagine the
amount of productivity and money the PO looses helping customers who
didn't really need help if they used their heads.

I personally pay all of my bills online and send online greetings
cards. If my small use of the USPS is a sign of things to come, there
is no way they can survive.

The demise of the USPS as we have known it is inevitable. My
grandfather was a blacksmith. He shod horses for a living. When autos
became affordable, he turned to the racetrack to ply his trade until he
died.
The Internet, with email and online billing and bill paying,
downloading and all are undoubtedly taking away from the USPS.
Raising rates will just accelerate their demise. They must downsize.
Stop Saturday deliveries and cut manpower by 1/6th.

"/>  It might help if they had better self-service machines that offered
more items. A digital scale that shows the exact postage needed for an
item after one enters the type of service wold help. Likewise the
machines should be able to print up an exact amount of postage (i.e.
$1.87) so people would not need a clerk for this.
About the only time I use a clerk is for special things such as
registered or certified mail.

"/> Priority mail can be a waste of money. The USPS &quot;promises&quot; give
Priority Mail special handling, but there is no guarantee. If your
item is under 16 oz, you'll save money by shipping as First Class
Mail. One advantage that Priority Mail does give, if you use the
USPS click and ship service is the ability to print labels and postage
at home on your computer and free delivery confirmation.

For you old timers out there, remember Special Delivery and Air Mail
Stamps? In the later years, these went by the wayside because it was
mostly all special delivery and airmail on the long distance routes.

I favor keeping the USPS a Federal Agency and not going the 100%
private route. Perhaps I'm too nostalgic, but the Post Office is one
of the last good things about America. Incidentally, I thought it was
a sad day when they renamed the U.S. Post Office the U.S. Postal
Service.

Imagine, for a small fixed fee, (much smaller than most countries)
you can have your letter or parcel delivered anywhere, to the remotest
village in Alaska, or a small village in Hawaii, on a mail boat up a
remote river in California usually within 1-3 days. Plus, what would
small town America be without the Post Office and your friendly local
mail carrier. If you are an eBayer or a small merchant, you would go
broke if you had to rely 100% on FEDEX or UPS and that's if they
currently deliver to your location.

At the risk of sounding like James Earl Jones in Field of Dreams, The
US Post Office is, like baseball, one of those institutions that
unites us and define us as Americans. It's part of our heritage and
our history.

I think there are certain things that should be preserved even if a
subsidy is necessary. Included in that would be Saturday delivery for
residential customers.

&gt; Priority mail can be a waste of money. The USPS &quot;promises&quot; give
&gt; Priority Mail special handling, but there is no guarantee. If your
&gt; item is under 16 oz, you'll save money by shipping as First Class
&gt; Mail. One advantage that Priority Mail does give, if you use the
&gt; USPS click and ship service is the ability to print labels and postage
&gt; at home on your computer and free delivery confirmation.

&gt; For you old timers out there, remember Special Delivery and Air Mail
&gt; Stamps? In the later years, these went by the wayside because it was

we sign to have it left in the lobby and take our chances with

We also have the option of going to the UPS/Fed Ex office and

Outer Mongolia.

Now, the Post Office isn't much better about using the
buzzer, but when we get a package from them that won't
fit in our small mailbox, it's remarkably easy for me
to go down to the local branch before work the next
day and pick the package up. If it's too heavy or
bulky, I can even make it home and drop it off before
heading to work and still be on time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Excerpts from Business Week magazine -

&gt;=============================

&gt;Last year the post office passed a worrisome milestone - for the first
&gt;time, first-class mail shrank in both volume and revenues.
&gt;Since first-class mail has long made up over half of USPS revenues,
&gt;fears are growing that it's only a matter of time before total
&gt;revenues start to shrink.

&gt;If so, the ever-growing tide of discounted junk mail won't be
&gt;sufficient to buoy USPS. Unable to cut costs fast enough to stay
&gt;afloat, the post office would have to accelerate rate increases. That
&gt;might cause big mailers to move to alternatives even faster,
&gt;triggering a spiral of falling revenues, rising debt, and declining
&gt;service.

&gt;Because of its universal service obligation - it must serve 1.8
&gt;million new addresses every year - USPS has limited room to maneuver.
&gt;These days just 5% of mail goes from consumer to consumer. USPS has
&gt;been shedding 1-2 billion pieces of first-class mail per year since
&gt;2000.

&gt;So far the post office has kept its head above water by improving
&gt;efficiency, cutting costs, and concentrating on growth in advertising
&gt;mail. So-called standard mail - advertisements, catalogs, and
&gt;circulars - is approaching the volume of first-class mail.

&gt;Trouble is, on average, each piece of standard mail earns the post
&gt;office about half as much as a similar piece of first-class mail. The
&gt;Postal Service has been quickly evolving into a commercial advertising
&gt;medium that also carries some first-class mail.

&gt;Cost cuts have helped bolster USPS operating finances so that it has
&gt;the leeway to postpone a rate increase until 2007. But Congress is
&gt;forcing an accelerated rate hike by insisting that USPS stash $3.1
&gt;billion from its overfunded pension pool in an escrow account.
&gt;Insiders contend that, strapped for cash, the White House is eyeing
&gt;this money to help cushion the ballooning deficit.

&gt;So, in mid-March, USPS announced a two-cent increase for first-class
&gt;postage and a 5-6% markup for other forms of postage that would take
&gt;effect in 2006.

&gt;Some in Congress would like to grant the post office more autonomy. A
&gt;set of bills in the House and Senate would, among other things, grant
&gt;USPS greater flexibility to hitch its rate increases to inflation.
&gt;Postmaster General John Potter would also like more case-by-case
&gt;freedom, so the post office could compete with private entities by
&gt;offering discounts to volume mailers, for example. Despite support for
&gt;the bills, the complex political calculus of the deficit makes passage
&gt;uncertain.

&gt;&quot;Things may just continue as they are,&quot; says Gene Del Polito,
&gt;president of the Association for Postal Commerce, &quot;till a real crisis
&gt;starts.&quot;

&gt;Such a crisis may be just what some critics of USPS are hoping for. It
&gt;would provide ammunition to those who want to break up the USPS mail
&gt;monopoly, on the model of Germany, Britain, and the Netherlands. If
&gt;revenues start to plummet, they reason, more competition may be the
&gt;only way to save billions of dollars.

&gt;In the U.S., demonopolizing is politically explosive. If mail is left
&gt;to market forces, rural, sparsely populated - and mostly Republican -
&gt;areas are the least likely to be served.

is going to be handling the majority of the communications currently
being carried by the USPS in paper form...we are already in a digital
world...now we are going full digital! There is nothing I currently
receive from the USPS that I could not get from the Internet or UPS.

The hand writing is on the wall...USPS is going the way of the horse
and buggy sooner than you may think!

thirty pieces with yours. The seller put it in a used box made of
cheap Taiwan cardboard and about an inch of peanuts. The handle had to
be right against the side of the box because you could see the imprint
in the cardboard.

If the package isn't properly packaged and padded to stand up to
normal handling then it certainly isn't the fault of the PO if it
doesn't make the trip. If it was packed well enough and still got
trashed, the office would've paid the insurance. You didn't say how
yours was packaged but I have a hunch that you don't understand what
adequate packaging is.

I saw a VERY nice looking glass sculpture come through last year in a
thin box and some bubblewrap with one sharp busted off stump sticking
out the side of the flaking cardboard. I didn't need stitches but
that's one mailer's ass that I'd love to take a blowtorch to myself.

One right that is precious to most Americans that most are unaware of
is the right to receive mail. The USPS charter guarantees this.
Along with that right means that you can both send and receive mail at
the same basic (first class) rate whether you live in Bumfuck Iowa or

mail traveled by railroad (usually) or truck; other mail by plane. But the

Personally, I think that mail service, roads, armies, public schools, police,

be a real government entity.

If it were a government entity there would be no need to offer cheap rates to
junk mailers. That in itself would be a tremendous benefit.

UPS the original shipping cost would have covered the breakage without
an extra fee. The box came directly from the Mozilla store and was
properly burst rated and certified, whould you like the info, I still
have the box and packing? It was also stmaped FRAGILE on all 6 sides. I
have to Commend the Mozilla Store for replacing the mug when the USPS
would not take responsibility for their actions. I bought a Cisco hub
off Ebay anf it was damaged as well. This was sent from an individual
and not a store and was NOT what I would call adequately packed. UPS
paid the shipper anyway. Hmm, imagine that....

Let's take the example of the post I just put on another thread about VISA's
policy on asking for additional ID. The way Usenet works is: (1) I put the
information out there and then (2) you can accept it as accurate, look for
confirmation from another source or sources you are more convinced is
accurate, or ask VISA yourself. Unfortunately (for you), there's no way for
you to force everybody who posts anything on Usenet to back it up with one
of those cites you're so fond of. And fortunately (for the rest of us) most
people don't really care about communicating with people who are constantly
demanding they &quot;prove&quot; their credibility. In fact, I suspect that by now
most people realize that with a minimum of effort and common sense they
*can* actually find the cites themselves. People who won't do it just make
themselves look ignorant and stupid.

Take or leave what you read here. Nobody really cares which you choose.

demand proof and assume others are, as you say, full of shit, are taking
that cue from their own behavior and projecting it onto others.

But back to Usenet specifically--over time reading people's posts I get a
definite feel for which people are doing a lot of bs'ing, which people are
too stupid or immature to understand how the world and things in it work,
and which people are generally intelligent and credible. That said,
personally I find it's better for me in the long run to take responsibility
for finding out the things I really need to know, rather than insisting
someone spoon-feed the information to me.

But YMMV, and I only have so much time and interest in trying to enlighten
you. Try doing the research sometime. You might be surprised at how good it
feels to act like a grownup.

&gt; I have a hunch you did not read my entire post. I am quite well versed in
&gt; what is and is not adequate packaging, thank you. I have another hunch
&gt; that you have an ass to cover. If that mug had been sent through UPS the
&gt; original shipping cost would have covered the breakage without an extra
&gt; fee. The box came directly from the Mozilla store and was properly burst
&gt; rated and certified, whould you like the info, I still have the box and
&gt; packing? It was also stmaped FRAGILE on all 6 sides. I have to Commend the
&gt; Mozilla Store for replacing the mug when the USPS would not take
&gt; responsibility for their actions. I bought a Cisco hub off Ebay anf it was
&gt; damaged as well. This was sent from an individual and not a store and was
&gt; NOT what I would call adequately packed. UPS paid the shipper anyway. Hmm,
&gt; imagine that....

&gt;&gt;&gt;They don't actually know what's in the package, do they? A while back
&gt;&gt;&gt;(5-10 years, maybe) postal inspectors were raiding shipping rooms (and
&gt;&gt;&gt;publicizing the raids) to make sure that stuff that should have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;sent
&gt;&gt;&gt;by first class (or overnight USPS service) mail was not being sent by
&gt;&gt;&gt;Fedex or other non-USPS organizations.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Someone sufficiently interested might look up the exact regulation...

&gt;&gt; Dude, there is a group of laws over 100 years old, collectively called
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; Postal Express Statutes, that give the US Government a monopoly on the
&gt;&gt; delivery of letters. There are any number of exceptions, including
&gt;&gt; internal mail or letters of such time value that courriers may be used.
&gt;&gt; To
&gt;&gt; prove the latter point, if the fee is higher than what the post office
&gt;&gt; would have charged, there's no violation of law. Some hapless companies
&gt;&gt; are chosen for such raids each year to keep the law in force.

&gt;&gt; For third time in this thread, there's no monopoly on shipments or
&gt;&gt; packages, just letters.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Now, what about all those banners in the post office urging Spanish-
&gt;&gt;&gt;speaking people to send money back to their homeland safely via USPS
&gt;&gt;&gt;services?

&gt;&gt; What about it?

&gt;&gt; If you all are insisting on crossposting among various newsgroups, would
&gt;&gt; it kill you to make actual points?

&gt; It seems odd -- and pretty chickenshit -- for the feds to require that
&gt; letters
&gt; be delivered only by the USPS while the USPS is actively soliciting
&gt; illegal
&gt; aliens to use their service to send money back to Mexico.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I may misquote, but I'd say &quot;a smart guy should be able to find
&gt;&gt;&gt;this on the Internet himself.&quot; It was a lawsuit by the USPS against a
&gt;&gt;&gt;private company who used either UPS or FedEx to send all their mail
&gt;&gt;&gt;including what would be normally sent first class postage. As I remember
&gt;&gt;&gt;they actually won, but the story was dropped if the company appealed. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;was sometime between 01 and 03. Have fun.

&gt;&gt; It's not up to the other guy to waste time to try to prove your
&gt;&gt; misstatements - if you can't be bothered to back them up, I can't be
&gt;&gt; bothered to believe them.

&gt;You just don't get it, do you, Bob?

&gt;Let's take the example of the post I just put on another thread about VISA's
&gt;policy on asking for additional ID. The way Usenet works is: (1) I put the
&gt;information out there and then (2) you can accept it as accurate, look for
&gt;confirmation from another source or sources you are more convinced is
&gt;accurate, or ask VISA yourself. Unfortunately (for you), there's no way for
&gt;you to force everybody who posts anything on Usenet to back it up with one
&gt;of those cites you're so fond of. And fortunately (for the rest of us) most
&gt;people don't really care about communicating with people who are constantly
&gt;demanding they &quot;prove&quot; their credibility. In fact, I suspect that by now
&gt;most people realize that with a minimum of effort and common sense they
&gt;*can* actually find the cites themselves. People who won't do it just make
&gt;themselves look ignorant and stupid.

&gt;Take or leave what you read here. Nobody really cares which you choose.

"/> You sure waste a lot of words in admitting that you can't back up what
you say.

If you send money to same person a lot, why not send them an ATM card
that they can use in their location.

You could use a special bank account just for that, so you don't have
to worry about a sudden emptying of you main bank account.

The rate of exchange may also be quite favorable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing to thank me for.

&gt;&gt; So THAT'S what life is like as an asshole...

&gt; You wouldnt know what an arsehole was

&gt;&gt; you really are pretty miserable...LOL!!!

&gt; Pathetic, really.

&gt;&gt; Oh, and welcome to my killfile shithead...

&gt; Fat lot of good that will do you, fuckwit child.

&gt;&gt; I should have done that in the first place but thought I'd use the

are.

&gt; Soorree, that pathetic little tantrum needs something, child...

"/> Keep in mind that &quot;Sam Jones&quot; is &quot;Rod Speed&quot; for those in the

his desire for children, shit and sheep. Ask him about his job or dead
parents and watch the sparks fly.
