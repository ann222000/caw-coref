Watergate's Company men: McCord, Sturgis and Hunt

"It doesn't take a genius to figure out that Watergate was a CIA
setup." - Frank Sturgis

Yesterday there was an answer - and it may not even be the answer -
to the question Who is Deep Throat? But that's a sideshow, and not even
a particularly interesting one, when there's still no satisfactory
answer to What is Watergate?

It's become part of history, as it was meant to, that Watergate was
all about a botched White House intelligence operation at Democratic
headquarters and its bungled cover-up. It's not hard to see why. Nixon's
paranoia was more than sufficient to account for its implausibility. And
though the Democrats needed no help imploding in 1972, they were neatly
nudged along by Republican dirty tricks. After all, Karl Rove cut his
teeth on the campaign. (Rove's mentor Donald Segretti served six months
in prison for forging letters on the stationary of early frontrunner
Edmund Muskie.) As Lisa Pease suggests , even the shooting of candidate
George Wallace may have been an example of the oldest dirty trick in the
book.

So bugging the DNC made a perfect cover story. But it's not the
story.

In Secret Agenda: Watergate, Deep Throat and the CIA , Jim Houghan
establishes, using FBI documents and sources ignored by those hypnotized
by the misdirection, that the DNC telephones were never actually bugged,
and that false evidence - crude, defunct bugging devices - were planted
in the headquarters months after the Watergate arrests to support the
cover story. He also found that E Howard Hunt and James McCord, both CIA
men, were using the White House only as a cover for domestic espionage,
including spying on the administration. Most significantly, Houghan
determined that clients of prostitutes in the Columbia Plaza Apartments,
adjoining the Watergate complex, were the real targets of the operation.

Houghan's conclusions may have appeared incredible in 1984. In 2005,
they should be predictable:

"Watergate," then, was not so much a partisan political scandal as it
was, secretly, a sex scandal, the unpredictable outcome of a CIA
operation that, in the simplest of terms, tripped on its own shoelaces.
There is more, much more, but the point is made: our recent history is a
forgery , the by-product of secret agents acting on secret agendas of
their own.

By 1969, McCord had become director of the technical and physical
security sections of the CIA's Office of Security. The broad
responsibility of the OS was to protect CIA assets, operations and
personnel. which entailed maintaining more than 1.7 million files on
"persons of interest." The OS, therefore, had an admitted domestic
reach, reported directly to the Director of Central Intelligence.
Houghan writes that, "in effect, the OS is an extension of the
director's office in a way that other CIA components are not; and
because of this...it has served as a vehicle for some of the agency's
most questionable operations." These include conducting the CIA's first
mind control programs, Bluebird and Artichoke; the Mafia-assisted
assassination attempts upon Fidel Castro; infiltrating anti-war and
black power organizations in the sixties; "Operation Chaos" and sexual
sting operations.

McCord claimed he did not meet fellow CIA agent Hunt until April,
1972, but a Washington landlady, Mrs Furbershaw, who had rented McCord a
basement apartment in 1969 (though he resided in Baltimore with his
family), said Hunt had been his regular guest. Again, McCord is not
supposed to have been in possession of bugging equipment until April,
1972, but when a new telephone line was installed in the apartment the
technician commented to Furbershaw that the rooms contained a great many
of the devices. The FBI reported that McCord had told her he was engaged
in "counterintelligence." McCord always paid his rent in crisp $100
bills, but he was kicked out by the landlady because of a procession of
female visitors, thought to be prostitutes, to his apartment.

What does this picture suggest? Least likely is that religious family
man McCord was conducting serial liasons. Hotels would have been fine,
and less suspicious. It doesn't account for the surveillence equipment,
nor for lying about his aquaintance with Hunt. The apartment appears
more like the safehouse of an intelligence gathering operation, using
Washington prostitutes. And, as Houghan writes, "the Office of Security
was the launching point for domestic operations involving prostitutes,
as well as the repository for all data, tape-recordings and photographs
collected in the course of such operations."

Official history says it was the Watergate phone of Democratic Party
worker R. Spencer Oliver which was tapped, but it doesn't explain why
his phone was singled out. Nor does it acount for why the only bug found
on his phone was bogus. It was discovered September 13, after many
thorough searches, and was of such a size, and so crudely placed, it
could not have been missed before. It was set to a different frequency
from that which McCord had supposedly been intending to use. It was not
functioning, yet was reported to have caused a disturbance on the line,
which the FBI could neither detect nor duplicate. Its design left it
incapable of the function required for monitoring by former FBI agent
Alfred Baldwin. The bug, in fact, was installed after the arrests, in
order to be discovered .

Why? Because the real tap was on the other end: on a telephone in the
Columbia Plaza apartments, which hosted an elite prostitution ring
catering to politicians, statesmen and other public officials. Some of
the clients were referred to it by a DNC secretary using Oliver's phone,
which was considered the most private in the office, and he was often on
the road. (According to Anthony Lukas in Nightmare , "So spicy were some
of the conversations on the phone that they have given rise to
unconfirmed reports that the telephone was being used for some sort of
callgirl service catering to congressmen and other prominent
Washingtonians.")

For two weeks, Baldwin monitored and summarized for McCord the
wiretap, which had probably been placed by Lou Russell, a former FBI
agent and employee of McCord's security firm, who was also a friend of
one of the prostitutes. (Russell died of a heart attack in 1973.)

This set up competing agendas between the Nixon men and the Company
men within the White House. The CIA prostitution operation was so
sensitive that McCord, aided by Russell, set out to sabotage the June
Watergate break-in so the intelligence gathered through the wiretaps
would remain the CIA's proprety. Houghan writes that "in effect the
snake had swallowed its tail: CIA agents working under cover of Nixon's
re-election committee came to be targeted against their own
operation.... All that the agents could do was to stand tall and, when
all else failed, blow their own cover."

The actions of McCord the night of the botched break-in were those of
someone who wanted to get arrested. A security guard found a lock taped
over in the basement, but McCord had taped over locks on eight floors,
including the eighth, occupied by the Federal Reserve Board. It was not
a target of the break-in, and did not provide a means of escape. It was
patrolled by its own guards, and had been burglarized just a month
before, so the guards would be more alerty than usual. If the taped
basement lock had not been discovered first, the one on the eighth floor
would have given the game away.

McCord also repeatedly lied to his accomplicies that night,about such
things as the occupancy of the DNC offices, delaying the break-in while
it was unguarded, and the the tape from the locks. (He claimed to have
removed the tape, but they were left as telltale signs.)

If the deeper truths of Watergate lead past the White House to the
CIA, then Nixon himself is a victim, and not just of his own animus. And
that muddies the morality tale. McCord got to play flawed hero during
the Senate Hearings, and his and Hunt's CIA pedigree were not explored
by legislators and journalists smelling the blood of an unpopular
president. Former intelligence briefer Bob Woodward obligingly led the
investigation away from the intelligence community, as did "Deep
Throat," whether or not he really was the FBI's Mark Felt.

Nixon's cover-up - spurred by the fear that Hunt's arrest could lead
to the reopening of the "Bay of Pigs thing" (his euphemism for the
Kennedy assassination) - helped close the case that the story began and
ended at his office.

Certainly no innocent, but not exactly guilty as charged, either.
Nixon was himself, at last, a patsy.

There's no point in looking for good guys in Watergate, one can
barely discern the factions and wonder who's cooperating and who's
competing at any given moment. Sure Nixon got a raw deal, but according
to Ed Epstein's Agency of Fear , his "plumbers" were looking for
increased surveillance & wiretap powers, no-knock warrants, etc, all
under the aegis of a "war on drugs." This was the genesis of the DEA
which ultimately morphed into the ultra-corrupt privatization of
intelligence under the likes of Bush Sr. I am not as familiar with
Watergate as I would like to be, but I would call it a distorted
manifestation of a high-level turf war.

Jeff...always glad to see Nixon's 'Bay of Pigs' quote out there...as
I believe Haldeman dropped that in his memoir as the REAL rosetta stone
to this thing....something along the line of Haldeman thinking 'well, I
gave them enough, it's their fault if they don't solve this thing, I
can't hold their hand all the way.'

We on the outside have no grasp of what Watergate really was. There
are SO many facets to it...and it may just be the Eastern establishment
fascists were just tired and bored with their country cousin fascist
foul-mouthed Dick; if anyone was going to overturn the constitution,
well by god it would be the Bushes, not a craven Bush stooge.

Nixon was gambling for VERY high-stakes when he tried to twist agency
arms to get the FBI off the investigation by bringing up the Kennedy
assasination; that he trod on other agency crap is not unexpected,
though I really don't think protecting a hooker/intell operation
explains everything.

Funny, the only comment I heard yesterday on the Deep Throat
'breaking story' came from David Gergen on CNN, who said we don't know
what it was all about, maybe it was a bungled burglery, maybe it was
more...'maybe even something a little Oliver Stone-like' was involved
[not a direct quote...the best I can recall, but my ears perked up, as
it's the only variation in the standard storyline I've heard in 24
hours].

Fascinating stuff, thanks.

Question-- was there a political assasination in the past 50 years in
the US that was a simple clear-cut case? Or has EVERY recent American
political assasination been some strange covert operation covered up by
a completely bogus official story? I guess I should also include
suspicious deaths in that category, such as Paul Wellstone's.

Why would the Fed, the DNC amd godknows how many other high power
groups have their officies in a building that can get burgled twice in a
month. Are the two things which are so closely chronologically linked
really unrelated? When I hear Federal Reserve connected to anything
conspiratorial I tend away from thinking it coincindence.

I remember that day well.

In retrospect, and looking at what is going on in the current
administration, I may feel differently about the entire Watergate affair
than today than I did 30 years ago. Perhaps if I compare a President who
ended a war, with one who put us in one, costing billions to this
country, the scales may be tiped a bit to balance less towards the
middle.

I've always had this theory that the far right set Nixon up because
he was normalizing relations with China and his abm treaty with the
Soviet Union. They didn't like him lowering the temperature on the Cold
War so they made him the fall guy for an unneeded burglary and coverup.

From Spartacus , on McCord, Watergate and the CIA:

"Carl Oglesby ( The Yankee and Cowboy War ) argues that McCord was
part of a CIA plot against Richard Nixon. Oglesby has gained support for
this theory from former CIA officer, Miles Copeland, who claimed that
McCord had led the Watergate burglars into a trap. The journalist,
Andrew St. George, suggested that CIA Director, Richard Helms, had prior
knowledge of the Watergate break-in. This was supported by Martha
Mitchell, the wife of John Mitchell. She told the journalist, Helen
Thomas, that she thought McCord had 'been a double-agent' during the
Watergate operation.

Very intersting post today. I am reminded of Akira Kurosawa's classic
film Rashomon about the difficulty of trying to get at the truth from
the subjective perceptions of the individuals involved.

I have not seen anything yet on the Web or in print that has remarked
about the similarity among the assassination conspiracies of that era --
JFK, RFK, MLK, Wallace. They all seem to share a common MO, as if there
is one mind or group of minds responsible for planning out these evil
deeds (Edward Landsdale or David Atlee Phillips, perhaps?). although
executed by others. Fictional murder mysteries pale by comparison with
real life in terms of complexity of the intrigues.

For A more in depth look at Watergate, which tends to compliment most
of what is said in Jeffs peice ;

http://www.tarpley.net/bush12.htm

"One of the major sub-plots of Watergate, and one that will
eventually lead us back to the documented public record of George Bush,
is the relation of the various activities of the Plumbers to the
wiretapping of a group of prostitutes whio operated out of a brothel in
the Columbia Plaza Apartments, located in the immediate vicinity of the
Watergate buildings. [fn 26] Among the customers of the prostitutes
there appear to have been a US Senator, an astronaut, A Saudi prince
(the Embassy of Saudi Arabia is nearby), US and South Korean
intelligence officials, and above all numerous Democratic Party leaders
whose presence can be partially explained by the propinquity of the
Democratic National Committe offices in the Watergate. The Columbia
Plaza Apartments brothel was under intense CIA surveillance by the
Office of Security/Security Research Staff through one of their assets,
an aging private detective out of the pages of Damon Runyon who went by
the name of Louis James Russell. Russell was, according to Hougan,
especially interested in bugging a hot line phone that linked the DNC
with the nearby brothel. During the Watergate break-ins, James McCord's
recruit to the Plumbers, Alfred C. Baldwin, would appear to have been
bugging the telephones of the Columbia Plaza brothel ".

Waddya know BTW. A Bush in there up to his gonads for a change !

Tarpley suggests that this whole episode of course was then siezed
upon in typically pragmatic fashion by the Anglophile Banking elites, of
whom of course Bush 41 was one of their boys - to further consolidate
their control over American politics.

Sounds pretty close to standard political operating procedure to me.

The prostitute/blackmail story seems plausible and might be true.
However, you would think if there were prominent Democrats who cold be
exposed for patronizing the bordello, it is doubtful the Demorctats in
the majority in the Senate would have investigated the scandal with the
zeal that they did. It seems more likely that the prostitution story is
a minor or irrelevant subplot to the main scandal and the covert
goings-on directed by the White House.

Not sure whether you could call this the proximate cause of Watergate
or not, but it's certainly an intriguing (and relevant to now)
rabbithole. From Peter Dale Scott's introduction to Henrik Kruger's The
Great Heroin Coup: Drugs, Intelligence & International Fascism (1980):

The Story of Christian David, an international narcotics trafficker
used by the intellegence services of at least three nations ... tells us
of a less documented history - the secret collaboration of government
intelligence services and parallel police throughout the world, and
their use of criminals, particularly from drug networks, for political
countersubversion. ... In June 1973, Le Monde charged that the break-up
of the Ricord French drug network in Latin America was the result of a
"close Mafia-police-Narcotics Bureau collaboration" in the U.S. The
result of this collaboration, according to Le Monde, was to shatter
Corsican influence in the worldwide narcotics traffic, and create a
virtual monopoly for the US-Italian Mafia connection (whose key figures
were Santo Trafficante in America and Luciano Liggio in Europe). Le
Monde's charges, many details of which have since been corroborated,
were passed over in silence by the US press. This studied disinterest in
the politics of narcotics (other than the propaganda, including flagrant
lies, from official press releases) is a recurring, predictable
phenomenon of our press; and it has visibly had a deleterious impact on
US politics. If the Washington Post and the New York Times, the supposed
exposers of Watergate, had picked up on stories like the one in Le
Monde, then the history of Watergate might have been altered. For the
history of Nixon's involvement in Watergate is intertwined with that of
his personal involvement in drug enforcement. Nixon's public declaration
in June 1971 of his war on heroin promptly led to his assemblage of
White House Plumbers, Cubans, and even "hit squads" with the avowed
purpose of combatting the international narcotics traffic. (Among these
with a White House narcotics mission, or cover, were Krogh, Liddy Hunt,
Caulfield, Sturgis, and Bernard Barker.)

Unfortunately that book is out of print. On the other hand, the full
text of Edward Epstein's Agency of Fear , which details mainly the
domestic political side of Nixon's war on drugs, is available online:

"Watergate" was the start of the Rockefeller/Bush coup, that went on
in various guises through the failed assassination attempt of Ford (3
times!) that would have left an unelected president Nelson Rockefeller
in charge, with George H. W. Bush as his CIA Director, with Cheney
likely remaining as Ford's White House Chief of Staff, and with Rumsfeld
as Ford's Defense Secretary. The coup has continued since 1976, when The
Rockefellers through their private vetting organization the Trilaterals,
appointed almost everyone in the Carter Administration. Next, the
attempt to continue it with Bush's 1980 Presidential Run, his later
attempt to force Reagan to accept him as VP (Reagan rushed late at night
to the Republican Convention floor in 1980, as he said "just to be sure
that some people got the word tonight" that he had accepted his forced
choice of GHW Bush as VP. Candidate.

Then in 1981, Bush attempted to assassinate puppet Reagan.

Then after 12 years of Bush/Reagan, put in another Bush puppet
Clinton (read the book _Compromised or _George Bush: The Immaculate
Deception), then attempt to kill Gore in Air Force Two by redirecting
planes into his airspace over Chicago in 1999 to get him out of the way;
then kill off JFK, Jr., as well because he was 'threatening' (sic) to
run against Shrub, etc.

Then steal the 2000 election. Then make 9-11. Set up police state.
Then steal 2004 election. Then set up more police state. et., etc.,

read this:

Title: WOODWARD, Pentagon plant, rep. of people 2 remove Nixon: why?
"THE 25TH AMEND. TRICK"

Author: skolnick

Date: 2004.04.21 10:02

Description: THE 25TH AMENDMENT TRICK--USED IN TWO ATTEMPTS TO GET TO
THE PRESIDENCY WITHOUT ANY ELECTION Queuing up to appoint President
Nelson Rockefeller, via a SLOW COUP of appointments and assassinations,
a technique that Bush has learned from well it seems. In 1973: plan was
to remove VP Agnew first, appoint a crony, then remove Nixon next
(suitably bribed), thus, having both appointed Pres & VP as appointees,
after the JFK assassination; then kill off the Pres. appointeee (Ford,
who had appointed Nelson as VP). However, Ford survived 3 assassination
attempts--messing the queueing all up. Did the Nelson Rockefeller scheme
die with him, in 1979, after he basically appointed the whole
administration of Trilaterals to Jimmy Carter's administration as a
consolation prize to his failes slow coup? Or did it live on in the
attempt to remove Gore in 1998? and then in Gore assassination attempts
in 2000? And the attempts to vacate Cheney without vacating Bush?
Something to keep in mind: this would be an entirely legal coup. Watch
out. Since November 22, 1963 (murder of U.S. President John F. Kennedy
by a Nazi inside cabal linked to Johnson, Lemnitzer, Nixon, Bush Sr.),
American politics has been overshadowed by a gangster turf war. It was
not taken seriously by voters for four decades. Voters might be well
advised to rethink their decision to ignore this.
