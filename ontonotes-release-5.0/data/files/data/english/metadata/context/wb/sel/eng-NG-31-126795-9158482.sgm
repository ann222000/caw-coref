Subject: Congress Government and appeasement of Muslims.

The Congress party, right from the times of the Father
of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, had been concerned with
the appeasement of Muslims but not at all concerned
about their welfare. This may sound contradiction in
terms but it is true.

The story starts with Mahatma Gandhi who was
assassinated because he wanted Government of India to
release 55 crore rupees to Pakistan which Patel
suspected would go to the war in Kashmir and would
only strengthen Pakistan's hand. Actually, the
central government had taken a decision -- Pakistan
would not be given Rs 55 crores. On January 13 Gandhi
started a fast unto death that Pakistan must be given
the money. On January 13, the central government
changed its earlier decision and announced that
Pakistan would be given the amount. This decision
seemed to be anti-national to Nathu Ram Godse who
decided to assassinate Gandhi on January, 13, 1948.
The working of the minds of Godse and Gandhi have been
depicted beautifully in the play, &quot;Me Nathuram Godse
Bolti&quot; which gives both sides of the picture.

In the play, Nathu Ram Godse says in reply to a
question from Apte, &quot;It is time for protests in
constitutional ways, processions,pickets to come to an
end when the establishment resorts to mindless
injustices. You can't just warn the government through
editorials at such hours. Tell me Nana. What do you
mean by people will not tolerate, people will
revolt...and so on? Who are these people? Do you
mean our readers or those who attend our meetings and
listen to our speeches? No, Nana, people also mean you
and me, us. If we forget what we write and what we
talk then our editorials and brave speeches in the
meetings and futile. A man addressing from the dais is
also a part of the crowd sitting before him. When we
say that the people should revolt, it means that we
should revolt!

Further Godse says, &quot;Time is eternal, indestructible.
You can turn its pages but never,never tear them out.
Gandhi has acquired some position in history which
nobody can deny, not even Nathuram. The page will be
there forever in fact. Sometime in the future, in some
storm, the pages will flutter and there will be that
same Gandhi's page before the world. I
don't refute Gandhi's theory of non-violence. He may
be a saint but he is not a politician. His theory of
non-violence denies self-defence and self-interest.
The non-violence that defines the fight for survival
as violence is a theory not of non-violence but of
self-destruction.

Nathuram Godse further clarifies &quot;The division of the
nation was an unnecessary decision. What was the
percentage of the Muslim population as compared to the
population of the nation? There was no need for a
separate nation. Had it been a just demand, Maulana
Azad would not have stayed back in India. But because
Jinnah insisted and because Gandhi took his side,
India was divided, in spite of opposition from the
nation, the Cabinet. An individual is never greater
than a nation, Nana. But Gandhi has stared considering
himself greater than the nation.

In reply to Apte, Nathuram Godse further clarified
&quot;But we never opposed a Muslim prime minister. In a
democracy you cannot put forward your demands at
today.

Apte states that Muslims were also responsible for the
partition.

To this, Godse replies in a prophetic manner, &quot;Of
course, they are responsible! Gandhi blackmailed them
with his fast unto death. His body, his threats to die
are causing the destruction -- geographical as well as
economical -- of the nation. Today, Muslims have taken
a part of the nation, tomorrow Sikhs may ask for
Punjab. The religions are again dividend into castes,
they will demand sub-divisions of the divisions. What
remains of the concept of one nation, national
integration? Why did we fight the British in unison
for independence? Why not separately? Bhagat Singh did
not ask only for an independent Punjab or
Subhash Chandra Bose for an independent Bengal?&quot;

Godse goes on to say, &quot;I had written this before. At
the time of Partition, when Suharawady surrendered
only due to political pressure, but only Suharawady,
not his followers...they went on with the
massacre. Gandhi started his fast, the Hindus put
their weapons down. I still remember that day. A poor
Hindu told Gandhi, 'I am putting down my
weapons because I don't want your death on my
conscience but I am staying alone with my family in
the Muslim area. That night, before leaving
Hyderabad I visited his home. The whole household was
screaming, weeping, his only eight-year-old son had
been killed by the Muslims. He had no weapon to
defend himself. He threw his son's body on my lap and
said, &quot;Take his blood to your Mahatma. Tell him, if he
goes on fast again, he can finish it by drinking not
orange-juice but my son's blood.&quot; I could
not say anything. Gandhi was the Father of my Nation.
For a moment, I was tempted to pull out the Muslims
from their homes and chop them down. But I controlled
myself. Violence for self-defence is justified,
otherwise it is an ill-cultured act. I returned to
where Gandhi was staying but he had already left by
car. Of course, there would have been no point in
meeting him... he would only have prayed for both the
killer and the victim.

Godse continues, &quot;I was convinced that though Gandhi
is called the Father of the Nation, he delivers his
paternal duties not towards India but towards
Pakistan. I came to the decision that as a son of the
soil, it was my first, foremost and divine duty to
assassinate Gandhi.&quot;

He goes on to narrate, &quot;On January 30, I reached Birla
Bhavan at 12 pm. Gandhi was sitting outside on a cot
enjoying the sunshine. Vallabhbhai Patel's
granddaughter was sitting at his feet. I had the
revolver with me. I could have assassinated him easily
then, but I was convinced that his assassination was
to be a punishment and a sentence against him, and I
would execute him. I
wanted witnesses for the execution but there were
none. I did not want to escape after the execution as
there was not an iota of guilt in my mind. I wanted
to surrender, but surrender to whom? There was a good
crowd to collect for the evening prayers. I decided on
the evening of January 30 as the date for Gandhi's
execution.&quot;

A Policeman named Arjun Das met Gandhi and told him,&quot;
those who threw a bomb here on January 20 were not
devotees. The bureau has cracked down on them.
Madanlal and Shankar Kistaiyya. They are talking. They
are workers of the Hindu Mahasabha. Bapu, that bomb
blast was not an accident. It was sabotage, it was an
attempt on your life.&quot;

Gandhi retorted, &quot;The Hindu Mahasabha and the Muslim
League ... I don't differentiate between them.&quot;

He tells Arjun Das that he does not need protection.
He says,&quot;When I started the fast, both Hindus and
Muslims put their weapons down.&quot;

Arjun Das argues, &quot;Bapu, a bullet does not
differentiate between a commoner and a saint.&quot;

Gandhi tries to convince him, &quot;But the trigger-puller
knows the difference.&quot;

Arjun Das warns Gandhi, &quot;The refugees are furious.
They hold you responsible for their massacre. The
Hindu Mahasabha claims you are responsible for
Partition. These handful of people are conspiring to
assassinate you. It is dangerous to move around among
the people at the time of prayers. Can you stop the
prayers for a few days?&quot;

Gandhi replies, &quot;You want me to stop my prayers? It
has never happened before. I did not let it happen. Be
it imprisonment, detention, fasting or sickness ... I
never let anything stand between me and the prayers.
Kasturba was serious when prayer-time approached. I
started getting up from her bedside. She held my hand,
pressed it. I waited ... Ba slowly slipped into death.
I got up and went for my prayers first, and then I
mourned for my Ba. And today you want me to
discontinue the prayers... for my life?&quot;

Arjun Das pleads, &quot;But your life we need Bapuji.. all
of us. That day you waited for some time for Kasturba,
now for the sake of all of us wait for some days. If
you want, let us pray here... You, Mahadevbhai myself,
Panditji, we all will join the prayers... here.&quot;

Gandhi says &quot;If it is going to satisfy them that they
have penalised a criminal named Mohandas Gandhi, I am
prepared to give them my blood&quot;'

He continues, &quot;That is the misplaced confidence of you
gun-toting people. I was in South Africa, where
Jawahar was not with me to protect me, the police hit
me, imprisoned me. I didn't have a revolver, I had my
confidence. Ultimately. I won the war.&quot;

Arjun Das pleads, &quot;Bapuji, I am not talking about
canes, I am talking about bullets.&quot;

Gandhi is unmoved. He says,&quot;I am talking about
non-violence, a powerful weapon like non-violence.&quot;

Arjun Das says that It is a question of a few days...

Gandhi remains immobile and says,&quot;It is a question of
principle. I am not immortal. I have to die one day.
If my blood is going to cool down their anger, if it
is going to stop riots and arson, if it is going to
satisfy them that they have penalised a criminal named
Mohandas Gandhi. I am prepared to give them my blood.&quot;

Gandhi continues, &quot;I don't differentiate between Ram
and Rahim or Krishna or Karim. I am not overwhelmed
about the fact that I am a Hindu and I don't repent
because I was not born a Muslim. I am I. And I am
honest to my principles and to the truth. Arjundas you
want me to discontinue the prayers for a few days...
but I say, even today, if the killer is waiting
outside for me. I am prepared to welcome him with
folded hands. He can kill Gandhi, not Gandhism.&quot;

Although Gandhi had paid with his life for supporting
Pakistan and thus, appeasing Muslims yet Nehru
continued to appease Muslims. He did not send his
forces to J&amp;K when it was attacked by Pakistani Army
in the shape of Kabailis (tribals) much against
Patel's advice and took action only after the Mahraja
of Kashmir had acceded to India.

Dear All,

It is certainly a highly informative Article.

But I have a point to state that Partition was NOT the brain child of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma wanted a free and United India. Jinnah was also in favour of United India provided that  he was made the Prime Minister of the new nation and this was not to the liking of Nehru who was equally power-hungry. When the Mahatma had almost  given his consent  for Jinnah to become the Prime Minister, there were  riots on the streets of Bombay and elsewhere in the Country, allegedly by the supporters of Nehru. At this juncture, Nehru brainwashed Mahatma to reverse his decision and to accept  the two Nation theory, so that Nehru would become the PM of India and Jinnah would get his Pakistan.

Concerning blunders committed at the time of Partition ( and post partition), for which the Nation  has been  facing increasingly difficult time, perhaps the Indian National Congress  led by Gandhi and Nehru ( Nehru,  in any case was blindfolded by power)  did not have the foresight at that point of time, whilst Sardar  Patel was sidetracked.

Thanks,

J.N.Mahanty
