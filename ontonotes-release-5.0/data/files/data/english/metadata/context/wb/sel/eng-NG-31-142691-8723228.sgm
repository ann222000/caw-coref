REPOST of Doc Tavish's documentation proving &quot;The reason Canadian
Kenneth McVay is distancing himself from the San Antonio Area Foundation
- Nizkor Fund? (It's illegal for one thing!)&quot;

Special Note May 14, 2007: The San Antonio Area Foundation has pulled all
links on their Annual Reports so as to not make available for public
scrutiny how they disperse funding and who receives it.
Nizkor is listed as a recipient in all of the Annual Reports archived.

The San Antonio Area Foundation maintains an endowment fund

go directly into an endowment fund, so that, eventually, the fund
will fuel itself.
SAAF bylaws state that the first $10,000 donated must go into the
creation of an endowment fund maintained as a part of the trust.
That endowment fund, however, has absolutely nothing to do with the
Nizkor Project, nor has the Nizkor Project ever benefited from such a
fund.
It's entertaining watching BlubberBabble try to make sense of it all,
and it's worth noting that he hasn't contacted any of the people at
SAAF for further information, as I suggested. That suggests that, as

Jason's comments definitely merit careful consideration, then discussion.
From all the evidence, it is quite obvious that McVay is a criminal, using
Bnai Brith, SAAF and others, to do criminal MONEY LAUNDERING.

When the SAAF Annual Report, and local news media both prove
McVay is a LIAR, what can one expect from such a foul shabbas-goy?

Jason is right in exposing these crimes.

&gt;&gt;Circular Reasoning, CR.  The conclusion of an argument is, explicitly

&gt;&gt;explaining how it is being used as both a reason and the conclusion.
&gt;&gt;Often this can be done by noting that in the diagram, the conclusion-
&gt;&gt;number appears among the reason-numbers.  Warning: a number that is
&gt;&gt;inside a conditional or a disjunction is not, by itself, being used as
&gt;&gt;a reason or a conclusion!
&gt;&gt;Prime Example - The so-called holocaust happened, because the
&gt;&gt;histories of Kenneth McVay's version of the holocaust say it happened,

Thanks for all the useful info about slimeball Carr.
He seems to have just as unsavoury reputation as his butt-buddy gay McVay.
If more details will be provided, such as address and phone numbers, then
perhaps he will get visitors to discuss with him some of his fallacies?

Thanks for all the useful info about slimeball Carr.
He seems to have just as unsavoury reputation as his butt-buddy gay McVay.
If more details will be provided, such as address and phone numbers, then
perhaps he will get visitors to discuss with him some of his fallacies?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Jason's comments definitely merit careful consideration, then discussion.
&gt;&gt;&gt; From all the evidence, it is quite obvious that McVay is a criminal,
&gt;&gt;&gt; using Bnai Brith, SAAF and others, to do criminal MONEY LAUNDERING.
&gt;&gt;&gt; When the SAAF Annual Report, and local news media both prove
&gt;&gt;&gt; McVay is a LIAR, what can one expect from such a foul shabbas-goy?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jason is right in exposing these crimes.

He seems to have just as unsavoury reputation as his butt-buddy gay McVay.
If more details will be provided, such as address and phone numbers, then
perhaps he will get visitors to discuss with him some of his fallacies?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Jason's comments definitely merit careful consideration, then discussion.
&gt;&gt;&gt; From all the evidence, it is quite obvious that McVay is a criminal,
&gt;&gt;&gt; using Bnai Brith, SAAF and others, to do criminal MONEY LAUNDERING.
&gt;&gt;&gt; When the SAAF Annual Report, and local news media both prove
&gt;&gt;&gt; McVay is a LIAR, what can one expect from such a foul shabbas-goy?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jason is right in exposing these crimes.

I have recieved a number of death threats over the yrs some from members of
the HA including a full patch member of that terrorist org. if anyone ever
does carry that threat out I hope law enforcement uses it as an occasion to
roust you :-) You seem to be a willing part of a criminal conspiracy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jason's comments definitely merit careful consideration, then
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; discussion.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; From all the evidence, it is quite obvious that McVay is a criminal,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using Bnai Brith, SAAF and others, to do criminal MONEY LAUNDERING.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When the SAAF Annual Report, and local news media both prove
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; McVay is a LIAR, what can one expect from such a foul shabbas-goy?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jason is right in exposing these crimes.

The San Antonio Area Foundation maintains an endowment fund
for any organization they support. Ten per cent of all monies donated
go directly into an endowment fund, so that, eventually, the fund
will fuel itself.
SAAF bylaws state that the first $10,000 donated must go into the
creation of an endowment fund maintained as a part of the trust.
That endowment fund, however, has absolutely nothing to do with the
Nizkor Project, nor has the Nizkor Project ever benefited from such a
fund.
It's entertaining watching BlubberBabble try to make sense of it all,
and it's worth noting that he hasn't contacted any of the people at
SAAF for further information, as I suggested. That suggests that, as
always, he doesn't give a rat's ass for the truth. Duh.

Thanks for all the useful info about slimeball Carr.
He seems to have just as unsavoury a reputation as his butt-buddy gay McVay.
If more details will be provided, such as address and phone numbers, then
perhaps he will get visitors to discuss with him some of his fallacies?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Jason's comments definitely merit careful consideration, then discussion.
&gt;&gt;&gt; From all the evidence, it is quite obvious that McVay is a criminal,
&gt;&gt;&gt; using Bnai Brith, SAAF and others, to do criminal MONEY LAUNDERING.
&gt;&gt;&gt; When the SAAF Annual Report, and local news media both prove
&gt;&gt;&gt; McVay is a LIAR, what can one expect from such a foul shabbas-goy?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jason is right in exposing these crimes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kenneth McVay, OBC, repeatedly uses circular reasoning, besides
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;deception and obfuscation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Circular Reasoning, CR.  The conclusion of an argument is, explicitly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or implicitly, used as a reason for itself!  Identify by clearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;explaining how it is being used as both a reason and the conclusion.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Often this can be done by noting that in the diagram, the conclusion-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;number appears among the reason-numbers.  Warning: a number that is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;inside a conditional or a disjunction is not, by itself, being used as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a reason or a conclusion!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Prime Example - The so-called holocaust happened, because the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;histories of Kenneth McVay's version of the holocaust say it happened,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and that's the real history.  Why..? Well because McVay says so... And
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that's the truth!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Can't deal in fact so you march out the same old perjured lawsuit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which Yale lost and didn't have the guts to follow through on the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;funding Mr. McBray!!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And the fact is, that nothing in that lawsuit was perjury and that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it was dismissed on a technicality.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So why do you continue to lie about it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I haven't lied but shite like you remain in denial.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Fabrication of evidence is perjury and issuing phoney subpoenas on ISPs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is a most criminal offense!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What did you do with the $50,000 given to you to start a Nizkor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; operation in San Antonio? Since you claim you don't have a San
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Antonio operation, is it safe to say that you simply embezzled
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the money?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No one ever gave me $50,000. That sum was donated to the San Antonio
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Area Foundation... The San Antonio Area Foundation has never paid me -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or anyone else, to my knowledge... I have no connection in San Antonio,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and neither does Nizkor. Get used to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   The San Antonio Area Foundation maintains an endowment fund
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for any organization they support. Ten per cent of all monies donated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;go directly into an endowment fund, so that, eventually, the fund
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will fuel itself.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   SAAF bylaws state that the first $10,000 donated must go into the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;creation of an endowment fund maintained as a part of the trust.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That endowment fund, however, has absolutely nothing to do with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nizkor Project, nor has the Nizkor Project ever benefited from such a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fund.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   It's entertaining watching BlubberBabble try to make sense of it all,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and it's worth noting that he hasn't contacted any of the people at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;SAAF for further information, as I suggested. That suggests that, as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;always, he doesn't give a rat's ass for the truth. Duh.
