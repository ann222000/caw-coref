Donna,

For what it's worth...

13 weeks and sick as a dog!
But I'm not smoking - and that's what matters.

I have found that the urge to suck another one at times seems strong -
overpowering.

But -  it  will  pass  ! ! !

Find some way to get your mind on something else for a while.

And -  it  will  pass  ! ! !

I quit a few years back.
Then noves next door to a very affable 4 pack a day smoker.

I held out for months but finally caved in and started again.

Now I'm quit again.
And holding on one day a a time.

And when it seems impossible I just remember...

it  will  pass  ! ! !

And that there is the key - except in the beginning, at least for me, it'll
be one second at a time, one minute at a time, one quarter-hour at a time,
one half-hour at a time, etc... you get the picture.

I actually only have 2 packs left in the house. That will &quot;hold&quot; me till
quit time. The reality, though, is I can ride to the 7-11 any time of day,
any day of the week to plunk down $3.00 to get another pack, but I won't.

Woo Hoo Heather!  Way to go!  The first day generally is the most
stressful as you as most aware that you are not smoking.  It's a
little less the next day and the day after that.  Over time you will
think of smoking and then just as quickly remember that you no longer
smoke.  By then most of the times you do think of it is when you have
a trigger reflex going on.  The sickerette with morning coffee.  The
after meal smoke.  Times like that.  Being able to realize that those
are NOT craves but simply triggers makes it a lot easier to just say
no, take a deep breathe and go on.

Hi Richard!  I don't believe I've seen you post here before, but I
might be mistaken.  Regardless 13 weeks is a great amount of
smobriety.  You state you are 'sick as a dog'.  Is that from not
smoking or another problem?  Your posting was unclear.  But I do
totally agree that regardless of when you get an urge or trigger it
will pass no matter whether you smoke or not, so just don't smoke.  It
does get better!

Now, sit back and relax.  The Yodeling Gnomes are heading your way to

Hi Mike,

It has been 7 or 8 years since I was last here.
The quit lasted - but then didn't.
TOO much exposure...

I developed bronchitis (sp?) a few weeks back.

All the little cilia starting to wiggle again - throwing off the
nicotine coating?

I've heard some people get real sick about 10 to 12 weeks in.
Guess I was one of them.

But it's getting better now.

And I don't smoke!  Yea, Baby!

David, I had a few days about a month into my quit where I just felt
crappy.  I wasn't sure if I was getting a cold or having an allergic
reaction to something or what.  Luckily, I had an appointment with my
doctor right at that time and after talking with him we decided to
change my allergy medicines and the problem cleared up within a couple
of days.  I am still finding I clear my throat a lot more often than I
remember doing before the quit, so I'm thinking that I'm still slowly
clearing out my lungs.  I realize that I can't be perfectly healthy in
a day after 40 years of poisoning myself with all that crap that's in
sickerettes!  But it does get better and better the further into the
quit I go!

I'd love to have a chat about sinuses David! And it is very on topic
since I am sure the congestion, if not the infection itself, was
caused by smoking! I am having trouble since February. I don't have
pain any more, just the uneasy feeling they're full all the time. What
are you doing to help yourself? I looked at sinus flooding and lately

I have found very little information regarding the connection between
smoking and cilia function, or more precisely, quitting and regaining
cilia function. Does *every* smoker get his cilia cemented? Are there
smokers that have their cilia still working despite the smoking? How
soon after quitting does cilia resume it's function? Can the person
feel it at all? Is cilia function related to the smoker's cough; if i
had no smoker's cough while smoking for 20 years, does it mean that my
cilia did it's work all this time? Or does it mean the tar is still
down there?
I'd love to have answers to those but I don't.

Drinking it. It is said to have many health benefits, the most popular
being lowering blood fat levels.

I do not think that flooding my sinuses with any vinegar would be a
very good idea! Even plain tap water due to the small amount of
chlorine and lack of salinity can irritate the sinus tissue. Brrrrr.

I believe it's about a month or three when this happens. I don't get sick,
but I do get a raging cough temporarily. The best advise IF that's what is
happening is to drink plenty of fluids, see your doctor if you need some
cough medication, and ride it through. It's a sign of healing IF that's

I had bother about 3 months then again at about 9 months.... Now for the
gross part... my phlegm was streaked with brown flecks during this
cleaning process. In an odd way it was reassuring to see something
happening. I have read that the cilia do recover over time.
Hope this helps
Chris
