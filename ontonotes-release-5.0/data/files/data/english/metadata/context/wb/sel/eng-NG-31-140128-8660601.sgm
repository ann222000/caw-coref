In stormy Green Bay, Bolts look to pour on cheese

By: MIKE SULLIVAN - Staff Writer

GREEN BAY, Wis. ---- The Chargers were welcomed to America's Dairyland with
a thunderous Friday night rain storm as repeated bolts of lightning dotted
the sky. Could it be an omen that electricity is about to return to their
offense?

The first two games of the season have resembled a power outage for the team
that led the NFL in points scored last season. Entering today's contest
against the Green Bay Packers at historic Lambeau Field, the Chargers are
near the bottom in all the key offensive categories.

Looking to run with reigning MVP LaDainian Tomlinson? So far, other teams
have grounded the running game so successfully that only Miami has gained
fewer rushing yards than the Chargers.

Airing it out with Philip Rivers? Must be a no-fly zone with only tight end
Antonio Gates cleared for takeoff as the Chargers sit tied for 27th in
passing yards per game.

Overall, the Chargers (1-1) are 29th in total offense (232 yards per game)
and 24th in scoring offense (14.0 points per game) and in serious need of a
fast start today as they meet up with the revived Packers (2-0).

&quot;I think that's something that we really need to do, seeing that we haven't
scored any points in the first half the first two games,&quot; Tomlinson said. &quot;I
think it's critical that we get some points on the board early in the game.&quot;

Tomlinson points out that only two games have been played and that there's
no need to panic.

On one hand, the opponents were the Chicago Bears and New England Patriots,
two of the league's tougher teams. And in the case of the Patriots, a very
angry team after the &quot;Videogate&quot; controversy that led to heavy criticism of
coach Bill Belichick.

On the other hand, teams expected to contend for the Super Bowl don't wilt
at the sight of any other team.

The Chargers flat out weren't competitive against New England.

The residue of the 38-14 loss to the Patriots can't be washed away by the
powerful storm in Wisconsin. A storm full of points and first downs is
what's needed.

Oh yeah, and a victory.

&quot;I think we'll bounce right back,&quot; Rivers said. &quot;Sometimes getting hit in
the mouth ain't all bad. It can make you respond in the right way.&quot;

Based on their preseason billing as one of the top NFL teams, the Chargers
will clearly be under the microscope today. But the lenses are pointed
inward as well.

At midweek, Tomlinson peeked back at the New England debacle and surmised
that &quot;the Patriots beat us and gave us a good whupping, but that's probably
what we needed at the time.&quot; In other words, if the Chargers are thinking
last season's 14-2 mark gives them the right to sail through this season,
then a horrific 24-point loss on national television might be a well-timed
reality check.

&quot;I would say that might be a good way to put it if I'm trying to figure out
where he's coming from,&quot; general manager A.J. Smith said of Tomlinson's
remark. &quot;When you feel you're a good team and expectations are high and then
all of a sudden you have a national stage and you go in there and don't play
well and get whupped, it just sends you a message.

&quot;First of all, you just got beat by an excellent team and an excellent
coach. Obviously, they were angry at many, many things that were going on in
their lives, and you go strolling in there as a football team trying to get
your second win.

&quot;It was humiliating and embarrassing. You get excited and you fail. That's
the bottom line.&quot;

Blowout losses and one-point losses count the same in the standings, so a
veteran executive like Smith knows that a team must quickly move on. The
players are of the same mind-set as they enter hallowed Lambeau Field.

&quot;Right now, whether it's offense, defense or special teams, we all know we
need to play better,&quot; defensive end Luis Castillo said. &quot;As players, we've
taken that responsibility. There's no time to sit and lull on the last game.
You have to move on.

&quot;We have way too many games to play to sit here and get bogged down on one
game. We're going to get better. We'll play better. Now we worry about the
Packers.&quot;
