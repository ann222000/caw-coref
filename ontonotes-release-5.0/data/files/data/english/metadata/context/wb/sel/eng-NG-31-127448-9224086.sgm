From the article:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
LAKELAND | Two members of a science group who support the addition of
evolution into proposed science standards pleaded on Tuesday with Polk
County School Board members to accept the new benchmarks.

&quot;I hope they come to their senses,&quot; said Jonathan Smith, a member of
the board of directors for Florida Citizens for Science. &quot;Do they want
a million-dollar lawsuit?&quot;

After the two spoke, an eighth-grade science teacher at Union Academy
in Bartow spoke in favor of intelligent design, a belief that living
organisms are so complex that they must have been created by some kind
of higher force.

&quot;When you talk about laws in nature it shows some order or design,&quot;
said Lawrence Hughes, who has taught at the academy for 16 years. &quot;The
laws of nature don't support change from one organism to another
organism.&quot;

Four of the seven School Board members have said they support teaching
intelligent design in addition to evolution in public school science
classes. Board members did not respond when Smith and Joe Wolf,
president of the Florida Citizens for Science, spoke about their
opposition to intelligent design, but board member Margaret Lofton
thanked Hughes after his talk.

&quot;I support what you have to say,&quot; Lofton told Hughes.

Lofton has said that if the issue comes before the board she will vote
against adding evolution to state science standards.

These rubes aren't just IDiot material, they are YEC IDiot material.
Even the Discovery Institute scam artists may have trouble getting
them to switch to the new creationist scam.  It could be Dover all
over again.  I hope that they take some of the switch material that
they are going to be scammed with and mix it in with the old ID scam.
Design of Life and that new scam book put out by the Discovery
Institute could go up on trial along with the ID claptrap.  Heck the
same ID perps that ran the teach ID scam wrote those books.  I'd like
to see them explain the bait and switch scam that they have been
running while they are under oath.

What laws of nature could he possibly be referring to?
And he's a science teacher? How could he get hired by any school

IOW &quot;postmodern synthesis&quot; material. I tell ya, if people don't start
using that phrase (for the mostly ID apporach that eases into YEC) I
might just stop using it, start promoting it. I'll hire Sean Pitman as
my chief &quot;bulldog&quot; and put the DI as well as those YEC and OEC
&quot;dinosaurs&quot; like AIG ant RTB out of business. Paul Nelson and Salvador
Cordova (apparently the DI's token YECs) might jump ship and join an
organization that won't tolerate the likes of Behe (accepts common
descent) or Dembski (&quot;ID can accommodate all the results of
'Darwinism'&quot;) It'll certainly be easier and more profitable than what
I'm doing now. If only I can get past &quot;thou shalt not bear false
witness&quot;. ;-)

That's funny. To hear Ann Coulter tell it, you'd think teachers were
the most overpaid profession of them all, being a sacred virtual
liberal priesthood of godlessness must have its fringe bennies. Is
there a sliding scale for degrees of unbelief where the baby eating
atheists get the highest bonuses (for Christmas of course to have the
most ironic effect).

How many 100's of thousands of dollars will this cost the school board
