I have had an underlying sadness for awhile. Probably because our
little Riley has died; or, it could be caused by hormones; or memories
of other losses that were triggered when Riley died. Who knows? All I
know is that I won't be trying to get rid of the sadness. That will
make things worse.

The Lord reminded me this morning of another benefit of walking in
grace: I'm not expected to rely on myself for things I do not possess.
I don't have joy today - at least not right now. He reminded me that
the fruit of the Spirit is joy. He reminded me that joy does not
originate from me. I am not its source.

Whew!!!! Pressure off!

Years ago the Lord revealed to me to NOT depend on myself when I want
or need patience, joy, self-control, kindness, gentleness,
faithfulness, goodness, peace, love.

My life changed.

When I rely on myself for all those things, usually the opposite comes
out of me! I'm so concentrated on myself that it's most difficult to
just do the day!

The fruit of the SPIRIT is joy, patience, self-control, kindness,
gentleness, faithfulness, goodness, peace, love. These are all God
qualities!

I NEED God-qualities to thrive. I want and need the real thing! Not
some look-alike counterfeit that I conjure up myself.

God is willing to share. He died so that I can thrive and not simply
survive.

I'm going to walk through this sadness today to find out where it will
lead. Pain leads!! I'll need the Lord's self-control: I don't want
to self-medicate or I don't want pain to turn to despair. I'll also
need His gentleness toward myself in order to not beat up on myself for
not being completely on top of things. What else? Oh yeah, I'll need
His kindness and love; when I go through hard times I have the tendency
to take out my frustration on others (and myself!) I'll surely need
His faith; my own doesn't go too far in difficult situations!

At some point His fruit of joy will pour into me and out of me again.

Yes, I'm dependent. Yes, I'm needy. Most of the time I'm embarrassed
to say that. But if I don't embrace that truth, I'll continue to rely
on the fruit of Pam instead of the fruit of the Spirit. The &quot;fruit of
Pam&quot; is an illusion.

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. (Galatians
5:16-22)

Pam, all,
Please allow me to clarify some things i said earlier, because htey didn't
come out right.

I never meant to imply that an alcoholic could drink safely or
responsibly. i've been around recovering folks long enoukgh to know
thatthis is a dangerous and grandiose myth; and means an alcoholic is
still in huge denial.

My only point was thta a recovring alcoholic might wis they could drink
safely; might wish they werent' an alcoholic. In that case, I don't think
theyre looking to justify htier sin; they're wishing they didn't have htis
thorn in the flesh; it's a bit like me wishing I could seen.
It won't happen ths side of heaven, but it's a nice fantasy.
I hope that clarifies things.
Andre

Pam, what you've brought up here is huge! I am of course praying that
God will continue to comfort you and your family. But what you wrote
reminded me of how a few years ago someone I know brought up the
importance of &quot;being with&quot; your feelings, rather than trying to stuff
them. If we try to ignore, deny, or stuff them, they don't just go away
and stop &quot;bothering&quot; us. What we put off processing now will come back
later.

When we allow ourselves to really feel what we feel, only then can we
process things, and those feelings can be dealt with and we can move
on. Once we've allowed ourselves to feel our emotions, we can let them
go.

We also often experience grief for a great loss in waves. I'm reminded
of people I know who have lost siblings and other close relatives &amp;
loved ones, or have been scarred by abusive relationships. If something
is too much for us to face all at once, our phyche may process those
feelings in bite size chunks.

It was really fascinating when I learned all this. The human psyche is
very deep and complex.

I have known Christians who have wanted to manifest the fruit of the
Spirit, but who were visibly forcing themselves to act the part. It's
not the end of the world, or the end of your salvation if you get
annoyed in a stressful situation. But I have seen Christians who were
visibly annoyed trying to put on a calm, cool face, and even that's not
so bad, but when they talk about doing this because they want to
manifest the fruits of the Spirit... trying to stay calm in a stressful
situation is admirable, but I remember being rather turned off when
that spiritual connotation was attached to it.

For my part, cheerful, pleasant people are certainly always easier to
be around, but I'd rather they be honest and open with me if they're
just not feeling that way.

Thanks, Pam.

rob,
Again, I agree 100 percent.
i espeically agree with the importance of feelings all the feelings, no
matter how kugly they may be.
this is why I don't like the whole Positive mental attitude movement.
I hate it when poeple tell me that ifI just chagned the way i think, I
could acheive anything; or that I'm in total control of how I feel.
How grandiose. The Bible tells us to &quot;weep with those who weep,' it
doesn't tell us to throw latitudes at them to cheer them up.
thank you once again for a great post.
Andre

Hey Rob: Just read on the other topic that you've been inspired with
song. I love it. Can't wait to hear you speak on Saturday night.

I'm back on the board because I'm waiting for the electric company to
answer the phone.

Laura, Kyle and I just finished watching Kevin Spacy portraying Bobby
Darin in his new movie. (I can't believe the name of the movie just
slipped my mind! Dang! I'll say it's old age but my children would
say I've been this way for as long as they've known me!) Anyway, I
love that genre of music and Spacy did an excellent job with song and
dance. PLUS, the movie had a powerful storyline.

While watching it, as with many movies I watch or music I listen to,
many memories surfaced and tears came easily for me. How cathartic.

I'm still sad today. And that's OK!

pam,
you're welcome.
I sometimes find e-mail communication frustrating because of the
potential for misunderstanding or misstatement.
But I'm glad it got us talking.
Btw, i am not an addicti, I'm an adult child of a dysfunctional family.
But I've been to plenty of open Aa meetings.
That's how Bob and I met, in an Acoa meeting; I know he won't mind me
telling you.

I want to have a dancer's body.
I want to be flexible, great balance, be able to break dance, back
flips, ballet, gymnastics, etc.
For a long time I have thought it was impossible. I'm already pretty
old, they say your body needs to be trained young..Blah blah..But I
really want to be a dancer, I can't squelch that.
So then I thought, Ok, well I need to change, but how do I change. I
thought it would be insanely hard. I'd have to train 6 hours a day in
torturous positions &amp; exhausting workouts til I pass out. I had this
one ballet teacher once from China how would teach us horribly painful
stretches and tell us that when he was younger he'd hold them for 30
minutes. He was a great dancer, I thought maybe that's what I'd have
to do if I wanted to be great.
Anyway, at some point I thought, maybe there is a way to change without
having to literally torture myself every day.
HOW can I do this smart? Well, I learned something huge then. I have
to love and respect my body in order to dance.
I had thought that dancing and my need to be kind to my body were
mutually exclusive and i had to choose one or the other, but then I
learned they aren't.
I started practcing tai chi, kung fu, deep breathing and learning to
sense my body have been helping me have a better dancing body. I have
been very surprised at what I can accomplish through going about it
differently. Kung fu says never to force your body, which was a
shocking concept, but has been wonderful.
And there are many other concepts and things I've learned from changing
my approach.

My point: I think this is kinda like the fruit thing. I can't make
myself a better person, but I can change my approach &amp; that might quite
naturally make me better. No forcing involved. Like, with the example
of patience, I cannot try to be patient, but I can consider the
events/situations that seem to set an occassion for impatience and
avoid them. Or, I can consider the events that seem to set an
occassion for patience and embrace them.
For me, stirring through my day sets the occassion for my impatience.
Trying to do to many things at once makes me impatient. Making
unreasonable demands on myself &amp; others. Not acknowledging things are
difficult makes me impatient.
For me, deep breathing sets the occassion for patience. Believing
things will be ok, letting myself be present to my surroundings.
Looking at others in the eye, remembering a funny situation on tv or in
my life, giving myself enough time to work through a project..

I'm not trying to emphasize that i have the power to even do these
things, but I am saying that many of our choices impact how we change
as people, and that these choices are often really easy &amp; logical..

&quot;Anyway, at some point I thought, maybe there is a way to change
without having to literally torture myself every day.&quot; (Em post 15)

I think this is true in EVERY situation. &quot;It is for FREEDOM Christ has
set us free.&quot; Torturing ourselves is not freedom. However, I've also
realized that making good boundaries - as Em is describing here - may
&quot;feel&quot; like torture at first. Changing old patterns (with the help of
God) to create new ones (with the help of God) is not an overnight
thingy. It's a process - not a zap - at least for me it's not been a
zap. God producing in me the fruits of His Spirit - will ALSO produce
in me a different way to live! Goes with the territory.

Years ago I smoked heavily. I loved to smoke and I hated to smoke. I
knew the Lord doesn't smoke because He doesn't need the crutch and He'd
never pollute His body like I was doing. Before even hearing of the 12
steps I asked Him to take the desire for cigarettes away from me. I
asked Him for His mind and heart in that area of my life.

The very next day I had NO desire for cigarettes. ZAP! BUT!!!!!!!!!!
I didn't know how to &quot;live&quot; without that relationship. When I didn't
feel like talking to people, I smoked. When I was anxious, I smoked.
When I didn't want to eat, I smoked. I felt so disoriented that first
day. How do I live now? I didn't have the desire to smoke - so
smoking was not an option.

I had to face life on life's terms - without the crutch I so heavily
depended upon.

Same thing happened to me with the food thing. I begged the Lord to
take the desire away from me to binge. He did that - BUT it wasn't a
zap either. Instead, the process He took me on was scary and appeared
like torture. He showed me the reason I binged was because I wasn't
eating when my body was hungry - it rebelled as the Lord had created it
to by urging me to eat in order to stay alive. I was in a self-induced
starvation mode. He showed me that in order to maintain a stable
weight without the torture of the starve/binge cycle, I'd have to eat
when my appetite let me know that. The cycle is broken and I've
maintained a healthy, steady weight for 5 years - by me doing the thing
I feared the most: EAT.

WHen I ask the Lord to exchange His fruits for mine, I'm asking for a
lifestyle change. The transition from unhealth to health can be a
scary process. AND, at least from my experience, well worth the trip.

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. (Galatians
5:16-22)

On the way home from the store today, I was thinking about the fruits
of the Spirit some more. To be honest, I'm still feeling pretty
crummy, physically and emotionally - even though I may not appear that
way on the outside. I was thinking that the Spirit's joy has eluded me
lately. Instead of genuinely laughing, I want to cry. The tears are
eluding me also.

I told that to Phil when I came home. He simply said, &quot;Maybe you're
tired.&quot;

&quot;Oh no. It can't be that simple,&quot; I was thinking. He continued to
tell me that for the past 2 months I've been heavily involved with a
lot of things: both physically and mentally.

So I thought of this: I AM tired. Exhausted. The AA H.A.L.T. theory
comes to mind in that when we don't take care of our Hunger, Anger,
Lonliness, and Tiredness the fruits of the Spirit elude us. How can I
LIVE in any of the fruits if that stuff isn't acknowledged and dealt
with?

Em said in Post 14: &quot;I think this is kinda like the fruit thing. I
can't make myself a better person, but I can change my approach &amp; that
might quite naturally make me better.&quot;

Well, I can't make myself joyful. &quot;But I can change my approach and
that might quite naturally make me better.&quot; I need to look at more
temporary boundaries until I feel better. I've already postponed the
Wednesday morning Metro meetings until after the first of the year and
I'm not taking any new clients until then either. I thought that would
be enough. I know I need to eat more fruits and vegetables and drink
more water - they give me energy.

What I'm really thinking about is our Lord doesn't work apart from our
humanity; He doesn't work apart from the natural. I think that's good.
(the opposite of the gnostic heresy: the spirit is everything; the
body, nothing.) Like Em said, if she wants the Spirit's fruit of
patience, she may need to:

&quot;consider events/situations that seem to set an occassion for
impatience and avoid them. Or, I can consider the events that seem to
set an occassion for patience and embrace them. For me, stirring

Believing things will be ok, letting myself be present to my
surroundings. Looking at others in the eye, remembering a funny
situation on tv or in my life, giving myself enough time to work
through a project.. &quot;

Jesus sure acknowleded His divine nature AND His humanity. Instead of
asking His Father to give Him energy, He'd often walk away from huge
crowds that needed healing and He rested. Instead of asking that His
anger be taken away and have it replaced with peace, He owned His anger
and expressed it appropriately and timely on many occasions. When He
was lonely, instead of asking His father to bless Him in isolating
Himself, He hung out with His Father or His friends. And when He was
hungry, instead of asking the Spirit to take His hunger away, the man
ate!!!

It IS true: the fruits of the Spirit work WITH the natural. When
I'm not experiencing them, I need to look at what's going on in my
life.

Post 19

Thanks, Andre. I've always been an advocate for seeking the Lord in
the practical. To me that means He's going to work with all of the
senses He gave me: feelings, intellect, physical aspects, etc. I'll
need to challenge thoughts, get off my butt and DO, feel my feeling,
etc. etc.

There's trouble, I think, when we don't acknowledge the reality of both
the divine and natural operating together as one.

housework done and taking care of other business (with the help of Phil
who is reminding me I'm not super woman). By doing that, I'm able to
hear from my Lord. This is what He just gave me.

There we were - family, friends, co-workers, nurses, doctors, funeral
directors- basically: all kinds of people, all kinds of relationships.
We cried and laughed, expressed anger, fear, lonliness. Bonding
together: beginning October 5th when we made the sad journey to the
hospital and ending October 10th, the day of Riley's funeral.

I experienced the presence of the Lord during that time AND unity.
Many others have said the same thing. That's what I'm missing!!!
There are a few other times in my life when the same phenomenon - for
lack of a better word - occured: my father's death 11 years ago and
with it a celebration with family and friends that lasted 7 days; my
dad's twin's death - which brought 30 family members together in
Florida last summer, and a trip I made to Toronto about 6 years ago
with 2 car loads of friends. I know there were other times, too.

It's over. My experience with heaven is over! I don't like that!

The Lord brought this event to my mind. Jesus took Peter, James and
John up on a high mountain one day. &quot;There He was, transfigured before
them: His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as
the light. Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah.&quot;
(Matthew 17:1,2)

Wow! To see Jesus like that! And to actually see two of the greatest
prophets that ever lived! Well, the disciples didn't want things to
go back to &quot;normal&quot; just like I don't. They wanted to hold on to their
experience. &quot;Peter said to Jesus, 'Lord, it is good for us to be here.
If you wish, I'll put up 3 shelters - one for you, one for Moses and
one for Elijah.'&quot;

The Father proceeded to change the subject even before Peter finished
his sentence. (Go ahead and read the rest. It's powerful. I'm not
going to include it here.)

Right after Jesus and His guys - excluding Moses and Elijah - came down
from the mountain, things returned to &quot;normal&quot;. Jesus healed a boy
with demons; He had to set everyone straight about paying government
taxes, etc. They all had to walk from place to place, eat (without
access to microwaves and packaged meat, etc.) They had to sleep. I bet
you anything Peter and James grieved the loss of that mountaintop
experience.

It's over. My experience with heaven is over! I don't like that!

Well, the Lord spoke to my heart today and reminded me that &quot;Soon and
very soon, I am going to see the King.&quot; And I'll see both of my
grammas, my grampa who I remember even though I was six years old when
he died, another grampa I never met, Dad, his twin, Riley. Who knows
who else? They won't go away - ever again. True unity. Forever.

Loss is so much a part of this life. It won't be in the next. Thank
God!!

I'm not kidding, I have joy right now as I'm tearing up and getting
ready to cry.

&quot;I knew the Lord doesn't smoke because He doesn't need the crutch and
He'd never pollute His body like I was doing. &quot;

Are you sure, Pam? Why do you suppose it says the top of the mountain
was covered in smoke when Moses went up there to get the 10
commandments from the Lord? Or that the temple that Solomon built was
suddenly filled with smoke when the glory of the Lord filled it?

Maybe there's a good reason why they picked George Burns to play God in

Pam,
yes; i agree, and there's a tendency among many christians, including
myself, to spiritualize everything. If I'm in a funk, or having a bad
day, I think, what is god trying to tell me?
Well, he maky be telling me to get some rest, or take a break, but as you
said, it can't be that simple, can it?
I tend to overreact to bad days, and then I start to question myself, an
think, does God want me to change carers? Because, obviously, if I were
having the right career, I'd never have any bad days right?
God didn't promise us freedom from the limitations inherent in the human
condition. the human condition is meant to be embraced, not transcended,
as some New Agers would have us believe.
the huamn condition is still good, despite the Fall, after all, lowly
human flesh was good enough for Jesus.

OK, fun &amp; joke aside, I am really getting a lot out of this thread. In
our struggle to achieve all we want to in life we sometimes push
ouselves harder than is good for us, and we can often achieve more by
relaxing and learning to enjoy the journey.

I find that's true so often in being a musician too. I know, musicians
are known for being undisciplined and lazy, but sometimes we push
ourselves too hard trying to write or play something brilliant. When I
was just goofing around on the guitar, my former guitar teacher would
say what I was playing sounded good. When I tried to play something
brilliant, he'd say it sounded unnatural or contrived.

Last Saturday at my friend Kevin's house we decided to write and
record a song over the weekend. Since it was just gonna be a &quot;for fun&quot;
thing that we were gonna do while I was over visiting him, we had no
illusioins about creating an artistic masterpiece. But the words and
music came together in a matter of a couple of hours, and we managed to
record all the instruments and vocals before I had to leave for home!
Had we been after perfection, we might still be working on it. Or more
likely, we never would have gotten started.

I like Cigars. And God likes me, therefore, God must like cigars. hee
hee. just kidding.

Pam- I like when you said: What I'm really thinking about is our Lord
doesn't work apart from our
humanity; He doesn't work apart from the natural.

One of the things I constantly tell myself in working with urban
&quot;at-risk&quot; (for lack of a better term) youth, is that I need to take
seriously their REALITY. These kids are often fully engaged in all
SORTS of things that make me cry inside. And I am there to tell them
about Jesus Christ? NO! I am there to SHOW them Jesus Christ. And that
means taking seriously the REALITY of where they are AT. That's tough.
And it hurts because you want so badly to change their reality. But
in order to really help them and show them Love, I have to engage them
in their natural-ness. DEAL with the sex and drugs in a deeper way than
just telling them to stop doing them. The gospel doesn't just make the
physical effects of that go away. I wish! No- they will still have
std's, and they will have their addictions, and they will still go home
and deal with physical, emotional, and sexual abuse that no one else
knows about. Loving them is so much more intense then telling them
once a week how God loves them. Loving them is going to court with
them when they are truant, and taking them to the doctor, and all the
other things that are bigger than them and that scares them. You know?
That's what God wants to do with us. Engage our humanity. Because in
our humanity, we are OH SO frail.

Rob,
Agai; excellent post. It's one thing to value excellence, but it's another
to become compulsive and constantly worry about where we need to improve.
If I need to improve in my work, thenb God will show me what's needed, and
that'll e the end of it.
I don't need to worry about it in the meantime.
i want to enjoy my work so much that it doens't seem like work.
Adam worked in the Garden, but he didn't earn his bread by the sweat of
his brow until the Fall.
Work is good, drudgery isn't.
Unforunately, far too many people belvie in things like self-discipline,
putting your nose to the grindstone, and all the rest of that jive.
They just can't see that it's not only possible, but more effective,
when we enjoy the process, so it's play as well as work.
Andre

Well, I think things can be a bit more complicated than that. Many of
us are blessed so that we don't have to put our noses to the
grindstone, but there is a large part of the human population that has
to not only do that, but more than that, just to survive, and to keep
their families alive. And I think that is worth acknowledging.

When Rob talks about just doing his thing and letting it be what it is,
rather than having a goal and stuggling to achieve that- I think he is
speaking about that on a different level than being disciplined and
working hard (Rob, correct me if I am missing the mark, here). I think
the key to all of this, or the pivotal point, is the control issue in
all of it. Rob can play his guitar, and do it well and focused, but if
he tries to control the outcome- that is where he finds it is not what
he wanted. But I can work HARD, and be disciplined in my work, but
meanwhile keep the perspective that I am not control of what happens as
a result of it, and that is still worthwhile, and for most of us,
required.

I can forget how hard others have to work, as I sit here in my cubicle
all day. But I am reminded at times how hard others have to work just
to eat. I don't know- maybe I am missing the point?

You're right Sarah. There are two sides to that. For us musicians,
before we get to where we can write and record a song in a few hours,
there are long hours of practicing on your instrument, reading books on
how to write songs, picking apart and studying other peoples' songs,
learning how to use studio equipment and software, and several other
things. But I'm usually motivated to do all that stuff gladly because
it's what I love doing and I love the end result of a finished song
that I wrote and played. I enjoy the journey AND getting there! I'm
sure I'm putting into practice what Emily was writing about in her post
because it doesn't seem like pushing myself to the point of discomfort.
Of course, playing rock music is nowhere near as demanding of a
discipline as dancing. But the guitarists that have inspired me are
among the more skilled and disciplined rock guitarists out there.

And Kevin and I worked very late into the night Saturday and Sunday
night recording parts and got far too little sleep. I had to catch up
on Monday night when I got home because I was dead on my feet! It
didn't feel like pushing myself too hard at the time, but I know I need
8 hours of sleep and I can't substitute inspiration for getting enough
rest.

Sarah,
I agree with what you're saying, and it brings me to another point.
i hate it when cranky curmudgeons talk about self-disciplined their
grandparents were, and how lazy kids are today.
you know the line, when I was a kid, I walked tne miles to school in my
bare feet, blah blah blah.
But people in the past werent' doing those things out of a sense of
self-discipline, tkhey were doing them because they _had to.
People _had to get up at three o'clock in the morning to milk the cows; it
was either that or starve.
I don't buy the myth of tkhe good old days; life in the past was nasty,
brutish and short. Thank God we are now living in a time when more and
more people are being liberated from sweat and toil.
Of course, not most of the world, but we're slowly getting there.
I belive one reason Jesus came here was to reverse the curse, that's part
of undoing what Adam did. What did the curse in Genesis 3-16 include? Pain
in childbirth, patraicarchal authority, drudgery, and disease.
If it wasn't ofr christianity, we'd still be living like savages.
It's because of christianity that we have hospitals, orphanages, soup
kitchens, etc.
I'd rather be living today than at any other time in history.

There's a passage in Ecclesiastes, in fact it's: 3:12 talks about work:
&quot;I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to
do good in one's lifetime; moreover, that every man who eats and drinks
sees good in all his labor - it is the gift of God. (New American
Standard version); &quot;That every man may eat and drink and find
satisfaction in his work - this is the gift of God.&quot; (New International
Version)

This verse has meant so much to me over the years! I love to work and
I hate to be enslaved. So many people refer to their jobs as a form of
slavery. If that's the case, I encourage them to start praying!
Again, &quot;It's for freedom that Christ has set us free!&quot; Our Lord will
do one of 2 things - in HIS time - either move us to something
different OR gives us a different perception of our job/career. When
people continually complain about work, I get tired. DO something!
Money is absolutely important, BUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! our Lord is the
source of that cash - not our employer. When I've been in situations
where work is difficult, I run to Jesus - He either changes my heart OR
my job. To trust in Jesus in this way is scary AND worth it. So many
times people say that WE are the ones who are put to the test BY Jesus.
I believe it's the opposite. He challenges us to put HIM to the test.

(There is so much good stuff on the board!! Dang! want to enjoy my
work so much that it doens't seem like work.)

When I'm under any kind of pressure - performance-based SELF-acceptance
OR performance-based acceptance - I am also under the thing called
perfectionism/legalism. I do not perform to my best. It's impossible
to do so. I'm also looking over my shoulder to see how I'm doing or
looking to see if someone else is watching me. (the fall mentality)
I do some music, for example. Man, especially since it's not my gift,
I can really be hard on myself. If I just play without that kind of
pressure, I have a blast. Graduate school, same thing. There was a
point when I was believing that my whole future depended on whether or
not I graduate. What a deception! Of course, I was putting myself
under so much pressure I wasn't enjoying the process. UNTIL, once
again, the Lord reminded me that my future is in HIS hands. I then not
only enjoyed the process, I improved my study habits and did an
excellent job on my projects.

When I'm in an acceptance-based performance relationship with myself
or others, I do an excellent job. More of my energy goes toward my
projects instead of toward &quot;who's looking?&quot;

Legalism verses grace. AGAIN. The 2 systems are everywhere!!!

So much more to say. Not now. Keep talking, guys.

Oh yeah: Regarding smoking: I don't care whether it's a sin or not.
(To look at things like that to me is the legalistic system where
people are motivated by right and wrong instead of, say, what's healthy
and unhealthy; what's loving or unloving.) One of my favorite passages
in Scripture is 1st Corinthians 6:12 where Paul states: &quot;Everything is
permissable for me but not everything is beneficial. Everything is
permissable for me but I will not be mastered by anything.&quot; What
freedom! My Lord on many, many ocassions has said, &quot;Go ahead, Pam, if
that's what you want to do, do it. I'll still love you. Find out for
yourself that what I'm telling you is in your best interest.&quot; (Prodigal
son) Dang. He forces me to take responsibility! I have to determine
if what I'm doing is beneficial? Is it loving? That's the kingdom of
grace. Many people end up suffering dire consequences - NOT rejection
by God!- for not considering if what they are doing is beneficial.)
Walking in grace, then, is about taking on MORE responsibility than
walking in legalism. In grace, though, I have a God who is WITH me to
help; in legalism - there is only a god of condemnation.

SO, like I said, I don't care whether smoking is a sin or not. For me
to go back to smoking would put me back in a world of decreased energy,
lung problems, escape and who knows what else. It's a miracle that I'm
not enmeshed with that crap. It was unhealthy and unloving. AND my
Lord loved me just as much when I smoke as He does now!
