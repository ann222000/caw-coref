Zealous for Zion

John Hagee assembles the Amen Corner's Amen Corner.

by Michael Brendan Dougherty

Members of the Cornerstone Church Orchestra wet their lips for
rehearsal, preparing to blow into their shofars, those curved horns
used to mark Jewish feasts. In anticipation of the evening's event,
organizers arrange thousands of chairs, placing programs on each seat
and covering them with flags-American or Israeli, alternating and
sharply aligned. Tonight, Christians United for Israel will hold a
celebration to supercharge thousands of Christian Zionists as they
prepare to meet their senators and congressmen the next day on Capitol
Hill.

In February 2006, televangelist John Hagee founded CUFI to &quot;respond
instantly to Washington with our concerns about Israel,&quot; telling
reporters to &quot;think of CUFI as a Christian version of AIPAC [American
Israel Public Affairs Committee].&quot; In just over a year, Hagee, with
help from charismatic pastors, is turning CUFI into the largest
grassroots Christian political organization in the country. The second
annual summit in Washington grew from just over 3,000 attendees last
year to 4,500 this July.

CUFI brings together a stunning variety of Christians. While many of
the female attendees wear modest skirts that cover even their ankles,
others, sporting stiletto heels and form-fitting pants, could have
stepped from the pages of Vogue. Not all believe in an imminent
rapture, though many do. Some are Baptist, some Assemblies of God,
others traveled from nondenominational churches. But they agree that
the Bible commands them to &quot;pray for the peace of Jerusalem&quot; (Psalm
122:6), to &quot;speak out for Zion's sake&quot; (Isaiah 62:1), to &quot;be watchmen
on the walls of Jerusalem&quot; (Isaiah 62:6), and to &quot;bless the Jewish
people&quot; (Genesis 12:3). &quot;When 50 million American evangelicals unite
with 5 million American Jews,&quot; Hagee says, &quot;you know it is a match
made in heaven.&quot;

The political goals of CUFI are, in some cases, quite modest. One
presentation focused on encouraging states to divest their pension
funds from corporations that do business with Iran. Others are more
sweeping: the U.S. must cease pressuring Israel to give up land for
peace and must encourage Israel never to divide Jerusalem.

The lure of a sympathetic crowd and the chance to trade pieties with
the most popular televangelists in the nation attracted Sen. Joe
Lieberman and ex-senator Rick Santorum. Each preached to the
converted: Islamic-fascism is the most dangerous threat facing the
United States, and Israel is the &quot;frontline.&quot; Even John McCain took
time from his ailing presidential campaign to make an unscheduled
appearance. Speaking of Iraq, the senator said, &quot;The temptation is to
wash our hands of a messy situation. To follow this impulse, however,
portends catastrophe, for Iraq, Israel, and the United States.&quot;

Hagee's charisma extends beyond his 18,000-member Texas megachurch
through the 160 television stations that carry his program into 99
million households. A scholarship football player in his youth, at 67,
Hagee still retains a lineman's girth and a coach's booming voice. He
counts Jews as well as evangelical Christians, the old and young, the
well-connected and naïve among his devotees.

In the lobby of the Waldman Park Hotel, Harry Stern, a Holocaust
survivor who emigrated from Czechoslovakia, heaped praise on Hagee,
saying he watches his sermon every week.

Another fan, former Israeli Ambassador to the UN Dore Gold, gave two
speeches at the conference. When asked what benefit it was to Israel
to build support in the greenest of the grassroots Christian
community, he replied, &quot;Look at what the Saudis are doing: expensive
P.R. firms in the United States, calling for re-dividing Jerusalem. ...
I'm just giving a few speeches here.&quot;

At a breakout session dedicated to youth, Dr. Robert Stearns invites
college students on a trip called &quot;The Israel Experience.&quot; A video
shows other students exhorting the audience to undertake this
transformative journey. One participant, Elizabeth Wong, says with a
disarming smile, &quot;I feel like my destiny has been tied with Israel.&quot;
The presentation is followed up by a talk by Jeff Mendelson of AIPAC.
&quot;What happens to Israel will happen here,&quot; he says somberly. As the
students begin to file out to prepare for the night's celebration,
they are asked to volunteer to start pro-Israel groups on their own
campuses. One from Missouri State responds to a question about the
Palestinian Christians curtly: &quot;They should go to Israel, and be all
good.&quot; Wong jumps in to correct any misunderstanding: &quot;The so-called
Palestinians, Arab Christians ... whatever you want to call them,
deserve our sympathy, too.&quot;

James Tabor of Middleboro, Kentucky wears a Star of David tie, bright
blue jacket and white pants. Despite his lack of formal education, he
is proficient in the current events of the Middle East. But for all
his ability to pronounce the name &quot;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,&quot; he &quot;still
would like to see him wiped off that map.&quot; Tabor, along with his 11-
year-old daughter, Ashley, carries a hand-drawn sign with American and
Israeli flags and the words, &quot;Press on for Jesus.&quot;

The image of thousands of conservative Christians from the heartland
waving the flags of a foreign nation would have astounded anyone 50
years ago-except maybe George Orwell. In an essay on nationalism, he
criticized G.K. Chesterton, the English writer, for romanticizing
Latin countries, particularly France, on account of his Catholicism.
Orwell called this &quot;transferred nationalism&quot; and argued that fixing
upon another country allows one &quot;to be much more nationalistic-more
vulgar, more silly, more malignant, more dishonest-that he could ever
be on behalf of his native country, or any unit of which he had real
knowledge.&quot; But Chesterton's affinity for France was sentimental-and
harmless. CUFI knits theology and politics to powerful effect:
Christian Zionists support Israel because God commands them to do so.

Not every evangelical is pleased with Hagee or his conference. Pastor
Chuck Carlson flew in from Scottsdale, Arizona to greet CUFI with
giant yellow signs reading &quot;Reject Apostate Christianity&quot; and &quot;Choose
Life, Not War.&quot; &quot;We think up to 100 million people are influenced by
the ideas of John Hagee,&quot; he says. &quot;We're becoming a culture of war.&quot;
Carlson's literature is theologically conservative, attacking Hagee's
gospel as &quot;un-biblical.&quot; He smiles as each bus pulls up, waving as if
inviting visitors into his own home. &quot;The way we're going to work with
the church for peace,&quot; he says, &quot;is to stand out in front of church
and confront them.&quot; The protest attracts plenty of attention and a few
heated arguments, but no converts.

Inside the convention center, nearly every major star preacher from
the Trinity Broadcast Network was present. Jesse Duplantis, Kenneth
and Gloria Copeland, Rod Parsley. Waiting with a somewhat bored
expression on his face is Newt Gingrich.

Hagee's address covers Biblical reasons to support the state of
Israel. While some have criticized him and many of the other
televangelists on stage with him for preaching a &quot;Give-to-Get Gospel,&quot;
Hagee extends the logic to a &quot;Give-to-Get&quot; Zionism. Because Genesis 12
says, &quot;I will bless those who bless thee, and curse him that curseth
thee,&quot; Hagee preaches that &quot;as people, churches, and nations deal with
the State of Israel, so God will deal with them.&quot; He tells the crowd,
with equal parts grin and gruff, &quot;Get ready! Good things are getting
ready to happen to you.&quot;

But not all is brightness. &quot;There are voices in the U.S. State
Department calling for the city of Jerusalem to be divided,&quot; Hagee
says. The crowd shouts a drawn out &quot;No!&quot; unprompted. &quot;Let's make this
clear!&quot; Hagee continues. &quot;There shall be one Jerusalem. Never divided.
For any reason. Not now and not ever!&quot;

Hagee has made Washington a focus of his efforts, but his mission is
larger than politics. He is not as solicitous to Republican interests
as Jerry Falwell was before him; he freely criticizes the president
and cabinet members. A politician works on policy-a trifling thing
compared to a preacher who reveals God's prophecies. Hagee's sermon
rises into a call and response, &quot;Shout it from the rooftops: 'Israel
Lives!'&quot; then dissolves into a hymn before Gingrich approaches the
podium.

With such a tough act to follow, the former speaker disappoints. In
his bland, technocratic cadence, he relates that 91 percent of
Americans believe the words, &quot;Under God&quot; belong in the pledge of
allegiance. The congregation grows restless. They came to hear
something more moving than agreeable poll numbers. But they rouse when
he says, &quot;We don't have a peace process, we have a surrender process&quot;
and when he chastises the president, saying that if he were &quot;serious,
he'd move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem tomorrow.&quot; Gingrich
sits down, and the Cornerstone Church Orchestra picks up their cue.

Images of rabbis teaching in Israel flash across giant screens, as the
crowd starts to rock and wave, lifting their voices, &quot;Sing Us a Song
of Zion.&quot; A young man dressed as an IDF soldier appears on the stage.
He appears to be hurt and remains on his knees. The music begins to
fade. Another young man dressed as an American soldier comes over,
lifts up his Israeli counterpart, and salutes him. The hall fills with
the sound of the electronic keyboard and the crowd punctures the night
air with waving palms and a smattering of &quot;hallelujahs.&quot; Some raise
tear-streaked faces, others bow their heads in ecstatic prayer, all
are resolute and ready for battle. They sing as the music lifts them
higher: &quot;Great is the army that carries out His Word.&quot;
