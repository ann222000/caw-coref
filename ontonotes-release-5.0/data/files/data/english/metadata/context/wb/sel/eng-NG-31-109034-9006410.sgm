1) For some reason, Korolev remains calm despite delays on his 1500kg
Sputnik.  The satellite is not launched until May of 1958--after
Vanguard 1 becomes the first artificial satellite in March.

2) The November flight of Pioneer 2 becomes the first artificial
satellite to fly past the moon, returning valuable scientific
information (though the tv camera returns nothing usable).  Russia's
Luna 1 does not duplicate the feat until early January of 1959.

3) The astronauts contend that Von Braun is too cautious and prevail
in their desire to launch Alan Shepard on a suborbital flight on March
24, 1961--thus, an American is the first in space, over a month ahead
of the first cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin.

I think these what-ifs are ordered in increasing degree of
probability.  They all serve to narrow the space race by having the
Americans succeed first, but then are quickly upstaged by a much more
capable Soviet flight.

This isn't like the Americans making it to the moon first and the
Soviets, far behind, declaring that a race never existed.  These what-
ifs are not clear victories for the Americans, but they do give early
wins when they are perhaps the most vital.  Is a closer space race
good for either side, or does it breed complacency in the US and
frustration followed by despair in the USSR?

I'll respond rest of this very interesting WI afterwards, here's my take
on number three.

Would this lead to a more utilitarian space program, or delayed space
race? First, Soviets had already dual-use Vostok up and coming and could
claim endurance, personnel and EVA firsts. The question is, what would be
the next step? Or the big question is, is there still the push for the
moon for the US? ICBM race for the US was over, the basic systems which
would serve the US for the long time were on the pipeline, together with
boosters capable of lifting significant scientific and military payloads.

USAF would perhaps push for the MOL program, but would it be viable in
light of coming satellite development? What would there be for Gemini to
do? Perhaps docking, EVA and endurance experiments could be substantiated
by potential military and scientific advantages.

On the other hand, Soviet Union would probably develop Proton booster and
Soyuz spacecraft anyway, due to their dual purpose use. But despite space
being the showroom for Soviet superiority, could there be support for N-1
booster?

Almost all sci-fi before the moon race contemplated a space station before
moon mission. Rather than a moon race, I would see that Soviets would push
for Almaz -military space station both for political and military
benefits. US would be pushed to develop some counterweight, perhaps using
Gemini-Titan hardware

And now for the wild card. Soviets, by using their near space experience
and Souyz-Proton hardware might push for modular, LEO built, moon mission
perhaps by mid-70's. This would crown the low image of US of 1970's. Thus,
could we see a Mars race before the end of the cold war, without dead-ends
of Shuttle, Buran and Apollo?

USAF, historically, wasn't interested in MOL until 1963--when the X-20
got canceled.  I don't think that changes much in this TL.

If America wants to go to the moon, and I find it hard to think of a
TL diverging in 1961 that would not have an American lunar program,
then the Soviets will feel compelled to respond.  As long as Korolev
lives, that means the N-1, which won't be ready in time.  If the
Americans feel less pressure to go to the moon, then they might settle
for lower cost options.  For instance, G.E. Apollo (i.e. American
Soyuz).  That has huge ramifications for a Near Earth build up, and
potentially no Gemini.

The Proton and Soyuz are unrelated craft developed by different
bureaux.  The Proton was originally supposed to launch the Russian
version of the X-20.  I only see the X-20 being a viable craft in a
lunarless space program.

The Soyuz was built for a lunar program as well.  Without a lunar
program, I think the Soviets build more sophisticated Voskhods.

Again, the Soviets will try to get to the moon if the Americans try.
Shepard getting in space first wasn't enough to make the Soviets go
turtle.  But yes, both sides expected to have a station up to support
a lunar mission.  This is less important for LOR missions than EOR
missions.  The Soviets didn't have a strong enough booster for LOR.

I have a what-if somewhere around here which posits Korolev dying a
year earlier, and Chelomei building a practical lunar program.

I don't know why Mars is an obvious destination after the moon,
however...

Thanks for responding!

What I mean is that rationale for UR-500/Proton still exists; as a heavy
ICBM and booster for military space stations. Similarly, there is
rationality for Soyuz; in addition to propaganda stunts it can be used as
ferry to military space stations,as a manned space interceptor and a bus
base for various unmanned satellites (in Vostok fashion). US &quot;Souyz&quot; would
be very interesting, especially if it would kill the Shuttle. Less funded
US moon program might well lead into more sustainable manned space
program, IMHO.

Now, if we draw a TL in which the US moon program is not one of crash
variety, could we see a TL in which US moon craft is one assembled in the
orbit (at same time providing experience for building larger space
stations in the future)?

Yes, but what I mean is that is there similar incentive to make flight to
the moon as a national US objective, if the Soviets could be beaten up in
getting man into orbit? There would be incentive to study the moon for
scientific and prestige purposes, but in this TL maybe the US would press
for unmanned &quot;Lunokhods&quot;.

That was the first thing that popped into my mind.

Soviet economy could not afford it, but US economy might. If we, very
roughly, put Soviet moon mission to, say 1976. If Shuttle does not exist,
and GE &quot;Soyuz&quot; provides well and proven modular means of getting men into
space, could we see Carter starting studies for Mars mission and Ronald
Raygun actually starting the project? Without huge Apollo project there
would be no tradition of saying that instead of men in space one should
invest into more schools and hospitals. Without marvel of Apollo the space
would not seem to be thing of the past, as it did seem during late 1970's
and 1980's.

A high-tech, peaceful massive space project with a prospect of beating
Soviets, and more importantly, making them invest into something not
economically useful, might seem to be exactly the thing Reagan (and
perhaps Carter) would want. Moreover, it could be made as a Free World
joint project involving ESA, Japan, etc.
