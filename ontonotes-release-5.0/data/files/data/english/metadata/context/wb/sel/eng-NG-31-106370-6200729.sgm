&gt; Jeb Bush gets rude welcome
&gt; Police disperse angry protesters in Downtown T-station
&gt; Saturday, October 07, 2006
&gt; By Ervin Dyer, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

&gt; Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, in town for a fund-raiser for Sen. Rick
&gt; Santorum, had a close encounter with a large group of anti-Republican
&gt; protesters as he was making his way to the Duquesne Club, Downtown.

&gt; It was about 4:15 yesterday when Mr. Bush met up with the protesters
&gt; near the corner of Liberty and Sixth avenues. The protesters were
&gt; marching to join other pickets already gathered in front of the
&gt; exclusive club, a little more than a block away at 325 Sixth Ave.

&gt; Protesters said Gov. Bush blew them a kiss, acknowledging the crowd of
&gt; about 30 chanting pickets that was made up of United Steelworkers and
&gt; members of Uprise Counter Recruitment, a tour traveling through 22
&gt; cities to support anti-war efforts.

&gt; The protesters came closer.

&gt; &quot;Jeb, go home,&quot; they shouted.

&gt; Mr. Bush, accompanied by a security guard and a female aide, made a
&gt; slow retreat toward the T-station at Wood Street.

&gt; &quot;He was quickly getting out of the way and not wanting to engage us,&quot;
&gt; said Jon Vandenburgh, one of the protesters, who also is a researcher
&gt; for the United Steelworkers.

&gt; Once in the subway station, Mr. Bush scurried to the escalators and
&gt; descended to the mezzanine level, Mr. Vandenburgh said.

&gt; By now, Mr. Bush was cornered. He was surrounded by signs that said
&gt; &quot;Pittsburgh is a Santorum Free Zone,&quot; &quot;Honk if you're sick of Rick,&quot;
&gt; and a crowd growing increasingly louder, according to Mr. Vandenburgh.

&gt; &quot;We don't want you here,&quot; protesters chanted.

&gt; Port Authority spokesman Bob Grove said six or seven officers
&gt; responded to the scene to control the crowds.

&gt; He said Mr. Bush had been walking in the area near the T-station and
&gt; the incident happened spontaneously when about 50 pickets &quot;tailed him
&gt; and stayed with him and went into the Wood Street station.&quot;

&gt; About 75 protesters remained on the street, said Mr. Grove.

&gt; He said the crowd was asked repeatedly to disperse.

&gt; Mr. Grove said a Port Authority canine unit was called in to help with
&gt; crowd control. Two officers used their tasers to stun two protesters
&gt; who &quot;were asked to leave, but did not go,&quot; Mr. Grove said.

&gt; The tasers he said were empty of the cartridges that supply a more
&gt; powerful charge.

&gt; &quot;It was a very tense situation. They were very close to the governor
&gt; and shouting on top of him.&quot;

&gt; As a precaution, the governor was ushered into a T-station supply
&gt; closet and stayed there until the crowd left.

&gt; No arrests were made and no citations were issued, Mr. Grove said. Mr.
&gt; Bush was not injured.

&gt; The two men who were tasered were shaken and left the protest, said
&gt; David Meieran, with the Thomas Merton Center and one of the protesters
&gt; with Uprise Counter Recruitment.

&gt; Mr. Meieran said the Port Authority officers were fairly aggressive
&gt; and pushed them aside.

&gt; Pittsburgh police said they monitored the protest in front of the
&gt; Duquesne Club, which they called peaceful, but did not respond to the
&gt; incident in the T-station.

&gt; The entire incident lasted about 5 minutes. After calm was restored,
&gt; the smaller group of protesters inside the T-station made their way
&gt; back to the Duquesne Club where they staked out the front of the
&gt; building and an alley entrance.

&gt; Mr. Vandenburgh and Mr. Meieran said they later saw Mr. Bush escorted
&gt; to the Duquesne Club, which he entered through a back door at about 5
&gt; p.m.

&gt; A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush said she was unaware of the incident last
&gt; night and had no immediate comment.
