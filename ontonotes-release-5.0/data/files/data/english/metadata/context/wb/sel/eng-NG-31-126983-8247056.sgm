Queshun #2:
Yew probly guest buy now that Ima having troubles with 200 agin.  And yew
guest raht.

Before I uninstall it and re-installed 98SE tell me some ways to get it so
that it runs fastern my old Commodore.

Many, many problams.  Butt jest to start -- it takes for-###-ever to start
up and for-####-ever to shet down.  Surfing is slowern heck.  Plain old
applns like MS-####-Word -- heck, I even git to see that leetle ire-glass
when I hit Control-V to paste somethin!

Hit don't have scandisk, msconfig, msdos or none of them handy fix-um-up
programs like 98 had.  Also, when I hit Cont-Alt-Del, it used to be easy to
see what wuz a running.  Now I have fif-####-teen more menus to go thru and
then sum!

What the ####, over?

git these two progies.  AVG antispyware from grisoft.  Also git
windows defender and set them up and let them do their things.
AVG is the best thing since sliced bread. If you got bad boogers on
your machine it will find them and smash them good.
Let me no how it goes and then get back to me.
Here's wishing you all the best.
Do the avg first and use it then do the windows defender.

No advantage of fat 32 with 2000 or xp. The machine is much more
stable with NTFS partition.

http://www.infocellar.com/software/NTFS-FAT32.htm

Depends on what you want.  NTFS volumes are less subject to
fragmentation.   FAT32 is easier to recover data when you give up and go
back to Win98SE.  Win98SE will read FAT32 but not NTFS.

There are other considerations including volume size, etc.

An easy tool to convert and manage volumes dynamically is  PowerQuest
PartionMagic.  My version is 8.0 and prior to the acquisition by Norton.
Today it is Norton PartionMagic. Frankly, we aren't impressed with
Norton products as a rule.  This one is an unknown.
