&quot;MOSCOW -- The fight is long over here for authority over the security
services, the oil business, mass media and pretty much all the levers
of government. Vladimir Putin's Kremlin, notwithstanding some recent
anti-government protests, has won those wars, hands down, and promises
to consolidate its position in parliamentary elections. But now there
is concern that the Kremlin is setting its sights on Russian culture.&quot;

Not Putin himself. It's the Russians who like to napoleonize
successful leaders. Granted, Putin could try to stop his personal
cult, but in that case they would try to create it for someone else -
not a wise solution. Reportedly even Stalin sometimes tried to
moderate his high-ranking cheerleaders while urging them e.g. to
replace &quot;great Stalin&quot; by &quot;great sov. people&quot; or &quot;great comm.
party&quot; ... well, they got the message and enriched their laudations by
&quot;great Stalin = great sov. people = great comm. party&quot; :-)

(A bit follow up on Yerofeyev and other stuff)

Loyalty card.
Artemy Troitsky
Published 29 November 2007
Even the most-travelled, open-minded Russians are singing Putin's tune,
writes Artemy Troitsky, the country's best-known cultural journalist.

Until recently, the Russian population could be divided into two
political mindsets: the oppo sitionists, both communist and liberal, and
the silent majority. These are the tens of millions of conformists who
vote obediently for the party they are supposed to vote for, but who
ultimately don't give a damn.
Now, from its inner depths, the silent majority has vomited forth a new
generation of noisy &quot;ultra-conformists&quot;, fanatical Putinoids. It's a new
phenomenon, yet to be studied, but at first glance they look like a
mixture of teenybopper &quot;Putin Youth&quot; (those kids who belong to groups
such as the T-shirt-wearing, rigid-right-arm-stretching Nashi) with
disciplined army/police/ security guys, small-time apparatchiks and
middle-aged women of unknown origin (presumably with a sexual crush on
the president). The core of this movement may come from the state, but
it is hard to deny that there's a substantial grass-roots-level element
to it as well.
Putin's sustained popularity in Russia is still a mystery to me. It
certainly has nothing to do with his achievements. Leave aside his
shameful performance during national emergencies (the sinking of the
Kursk submarine in 2000, the shoot-out at the Nord-Ost theatre in 2002
and, of course, the Beslan school massacre in 2004). Putin has also
delivered almost none of his long-term promises. Crime, poverty and
inflation remain as high as ever. Corruption has reached unprecedented
heights. Terrorist attacks continue, while the economy is entirely and
dangerously dependent on the export of natural resources. To this, one
can add the catastrophically declining image of Russia in the rest of
the world - something our president can be especially proud of, as he
seems to follow religiously one of the most rotten pearls of Russian
wisdom, a proverb that says: &quot;If they fear you, they respect you.&quot;
Guus and George
So there must be a voodoo element to the way Putin survives and thrives.
I would put him in the same league as the notoriously lucky Guus
Hiddink, the Dutchman who is coach to the Russian national football
squad. Thanks to incredible twists of fate, notably England's
ignominious defeat by Croatia on 21 November, Hiddink has managed to
squeeze his lousy team into the Euro 2008 finals. Putin's Steve McClaren
is, undoubtedly, one George W Bush, who puts the Russian leader's
mediocracy into the shade with his own flamboyant cretinism. One need
only look at the war in Iraq, which triggered the past few years' huge
rises in global oil and gas prices. The rest you know.
These oil zillions pour into Russian hands in such quantities that even
the tiny orgy of kleptocrats running the country can make it feel
relatively prosperous. Putin's luck also lies in there being no strong
opposition movement. There are no convincing figures able to project an
alternative vision. There is no moral authority challenging the status
quo. All the leading cultural/humanitarian figures and opinion-formers
either praise the boss or keep their mouths shut. His administration has
done a good job of sorting the mass media.
Let me give one small example, so that you can understand better what
kind of country we now live in. Recently on a TV talk show there was a
gentle discussion between Viktor Yerofeyev, a well-known novelist and
liberal columnist, and Nikita Mikhalkov, a well-known film-maker and
professional brown-noser. Mikhalkov expressed his love and passion for
Putin and the urge to glorify him in his works, in a manner probably not
seen since Stalin's day. Yerofeyev tried, in a mild-mannered way, to
calm the ultra-loyal film director down, suggesting that idolising the
president might be a little over the top, and even tasteless. Putin
might be a good guy, but he too has got problems, and we live in a
modern democratic country, etc.
Yerofeyev sounded somewhat more convincing than Mikhalkov. Then, a week
later, the same Yerofeyev was invited to another talk show - this time
on the all-powerful Channel 1. Suddenly he was saying something
completely different. He confessed his admiration for Putin, his loyalty
to his political line and his general happiness about living in Putin's
Russia. It wasn't formally staged as an act of repentance for the
incorrect things he had said, but it didn't need to be. Knowing
Yerofeyev - an ever-independent, western-orientated, ex-samizdat writer
- as I do, I must admit I was impressed.(Scotsman)

You like spoonerisms?

Try: cunning stunt.

Also, what is the difference between a draught horse and a charger?
Well, a charger darts into the fray, whereas a draught horse farts
into the dray.

Oh, pardon me, I have breached spoonerism etiquette:

(Wikipedia)

Finnish
Finnish sananmuunnokset (literal translation 'word transformations'
does not capture the spoonerism hidden in the original Finnish
compound) are mainly used in jokes. Before transformation a Finnish
spoonerism is something innocent and after transformation something
obscene. A Finnish spoonerism is usually performed by telling the
innocent version and letting the listener figure out the outcome.

French
The French contrepèterie is also facilitated by a strong Rabelaisian
tradition for coarse, if witty, humor. Contrepéteurs excel in finding
in seeming innocuous phrases the elements for the lewd and humorous.
According to French tradition--and unlike the examples provided below--
one should never utter nor write the second part of a spoonerism. Only
the first part should be said, leaving readers or listeners trying
hard to find the second funny part. Actually giving the solution of a
spoonerism is considered distasteful.

This is somewhat similar to certain English language jokes involving
spoonerisms, in which one asks questions like &quot;What is the difference
between a rooster and a lawyer?&quot; and provides only the non-spoonerised
part of the answer (&quot;One clucks defiance...&quot;), leaving the usually-
vulgar punch-line (&quot;...the other fucks the clients&quot;) for the listener
to come up with, although it is far more subtle without the explicit
joke formulation.

A famous example is the weekly column &quot;Sur l'Album de la Comtesse&quot; in
the French weekly satirical journal Le Canard Enchaîné.

- For example, Les nouilles cuisent au jus de cane : les couilles
nuisent au cul de Jeanne (which translates roughly as, the noodles are
cooking in a duck broth: the balls hurt Jane's arse). The s and l in
jus and cul are silent in French.

One from French comedian Coluche: Quand les Nippons bougent, la Chine
se dresse : quand les nichons bougent, la pine se dresse (which
translates as, when the Japanese stir, China reacts : when the boobs
jiggle, the cock rises).

Similarly, the French word for a tumble dryer, un sèche-linge, could
give rise to a spoonerism un lèche-singe which would mean a person who
licks monkeys.

A French radio announcer was reputed to say, instead of Les
populations immenses du Cap (the immense population of Cap-Haïtien):
Les copulations immenses du Pape. (The Pope's immense copulations).

German
The German Schüttelreim ('shake rhyme') is a rhyme where the initial
consonants (or even the following vowels) of the last two stressed
syllables are exchanged with one another. For example, Es klapperte
die Klapperschlang', -- bis ihre Klapper schlapper klang. (by Heinz
Erhardt) - The rattlesnake rattled, until its rattles sounded
flabbier.

A popular spoonerism in German derives from the German adaptation of
the TV-show Saturday Night Live (German Title: RTL Samstag Nacht). A
series of sketches was aired which had the title Kentucky schreit
ficken. This spoonerism of Kentucky Fried Chicken means: Kentucky
yells fuck. This was a parody on TV ads for McDonald's which used
spoonerisms.

It's scheduled for December 21, a Christmas gift to the Balts and other
new EU member countries. Traveling from Finland to the Baltics is
already quite simple, visas have not been needed for more than ten
years, passports are inspected only perfunctorily, and inter-Baltic
inspections have been simplified so that there is only one inspection at
the border.

&gt; cult, but in that case they would try to create it for someone else -
&gt; not a wise solution. Reportedly even Stalin sometimes tried to
&gt; moderate his high-ranking cheerleaders while urging them e.g. to
&gt; replace &quot;great Stalin&quot; by &quot;great sov. people&quot; or &quot;great comm.
&gt; party&quot; ... well, they got the message and enriched their laudations by
&gt; &quot;great Stalin = great sov. people = great comm. party&quot; :-)
