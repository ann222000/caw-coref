Hi Cat!

I am sorry that you have had such a hard time with the RSD issues and
the blocks.  Nerve blocks are standard medical treatment guidelines
for CRPS.  Some of the members have had very good luck with the them
and others not such good luck.  As with anything to to with CRPS, we
are all different and affected in different ways.  With that thought,
some of the treatments work for some of us and do not work well with
others.

Please, keep in mind that you are within your legal right to refuse
the blocks here in the US.  Please also, keep in mind that you may be
in search for the treatments (your way - right away) comes to mind,
for quite awhile.  Many of us have had to search for doctors that will
be willing to work with us.  Some of us have had many different
doctors with continued searching, and then others have fallen right
into the offices with the treatment options for them.

There is so much for the scientific community to do to research our
diagnoses and it is very difficult because each of us reacts
differently.  Many of us have a barrage of other issues on top of the
CRPS.  Sometimes these external diagnoses were before the CRPS and
sometimes they are after.  Many of us wonder if the stuff that happens
to us after the diagnoses, has correlation to the CRPS.

They have been making alot of (in my opinion) ground breaking
discoveries about the diagnoses and treatments recently (20 years) all
over the world.  They also seem to be finding out more and more
frequent discoveries as they really begin to look at it.  I am not
sure if there will ever be something that will make all of us remiss,
or if there will ever be a cure.

My thought from day one has been to learn as much as I could
personally and then support those sufferers around me.  I have read
many things about people committing suicide, because of pain and
depression and I pray that someone close to me that suffers will never
feel alone and feel the need to take their life.  Together we can work
together to get awareness out about this.  There is a page where we
have tossed many an idea around.  If you have any idea's please visit
and post it.

I hope this makes sense, as I am quite tired.

Good evening, and sweetest dreams to you!

Rain

Well said Rain
One of the best things about this group is that we are all trying to
get better and are doing the little things that we can do to help
ourselves. The best help we can have is the help we give ourselves by
being informed and sharing what works in a practical sense.

With CRPS it really is not what can be done to/for us but what we can
do for ourselves. Everything we do for ourselves empowers us. That's
why we have pages about healthy nutrition, ideas for assistive devices
and ways of getting around things etc. I encourage all our members to
visit the &quot;Pages&quot; and read some of the good information and perhaps
add what you have found to help.
Hugs
jeisea

Rain and Jeisea,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts here.  I must say I concur.  Also, I
think when we sit back and just wait to see what can be done for us
through passive treatments, we can stay stuck.  I love how group
members have been able to share practical things, such as relaxation
strategies, breathing technique, nutritional ideas, etc that we can
use/incorporate in our daily routines to help ourselves.  I've found
empowerment lessens stress and in turn, improves pain management.

Hugs,
Lynn

For me personally I was in doctor limbo land with concepts and ideas
just as Cat is.  I had things that were not working and information to
me that just seemed so endless and overwhelming.

It was people like Jeisea, and my constant search for knowledge that
helped me become positive about fighting.  From that point on...

I always picture myself in knights armor with a sword (like I could
even hold one) but that is what I picture.  I picture the RSD as a
great Dragon or Monster and each time I get a little more knowledge,
or find another natural way to benifit from, I can picture that sword
held a little higher and that swing at the beast a little more
forceful.

I feel as I though &quot;I have the power within to win!&quot;

~Dumb, maybe~ Does it work for me???  Definately!

Everyday I learn something new, and for that alone, I am ahead of the
game!

Hugs

Rain

Dear Rain,

That was a wonderful thing to say and a great way to describe how you have felt in learning new ways to fight the dragon with the sword that is a source of different ways that you have learned to help in fighting the pain ...you describe things so very well my friend. I also understand how Cat feels with her questions and wanting to find out knowledge about this RSD...I feel like I still have not learned near enough either or that I have to catch up on the ways that unfortunately I have been taught such as being offered meds without alternative ways...a big mistake.You have to become responsible for yourself !

Hugs,

Denee

Or.........you live in a area,where NO Dr really knows about RSD.
I went to a ER one nite.......the nurse there was asking me questions.  She said in her
30 years of workin at that ER.....she had never heard of RSD.
she saw i was in PAIN........and of course my foot showed it to.....
When the ER doctor came in.........i asked him how much he knew about RSD....he was
honest enough to tell me.........he did not know that much about it.
The nurse told me when she got home she was going to look up RSD.......so she could try
to learn about it.

I had a bone scan done at that same hospital.........6 months after injury.
Reflex sympathetic dystropy is what the results were.  That was  8 months ago.

Hugzzzzzzz, CAT

Hey hun,

NOT one nerve block worked on me.........you would have
thought they would have stopped at the 3rd one...not keep
doing them.
The problem i have is workers comp and what they approve.
Not all things they will approve.
So far they havent even paid my ER visits....if they would
get me a good PM DR.......then i wouldnt have to run to the
ER when i am in burning intense pain.

Im hoping one day soon........i will have that one DR who
takes care of this.......and a p.t. person who knows what
they are doing.
I think i have the p.t. girl.......i want to transfer my p.t. over
to this other place...the same place i get my aqua theraphy.

Oh......when i brought up aqua theraphy to my PM DR.
He thought it would be a good idea.......then i said..I needed
a another prescription for the p.t.   He said........IT ISNT
DOING YOU ANY GOOD NOW IS IT...SO LETS TRY THE
AQUA THERAPHY FOR A MONTH.

OMG.......you should have both...........but then.......see what
state im in.......hahaha.

Im watching the roast to flav er flav........and it is a laugh.

Hey yall,

I have been telling Terry i was going to make him his
banana pudding........as hard as it is for me.....im trying to
make it tonite.
I have to sit down after a small stir........it is soooo painful to
stand for even a minute sometimes.
Specially after that last nerve block.

He does most of the cooking...well 99% of it....since i cant
stand.
Im hoping once my heel goes down, things will get better.
And let me say this.............my back does NOT hurt becuz
of the way i have to walk...which is hobble.
I hurt my back the same time i hurt my foot......over a year
ago.

Hugzzzzzzz and thanks for letting me sound off so much,
CAT

And vanilla wafers.
Tasted like there was banana's in there.......you can of course add
banana's, but i really loved it this way.

Has to be banana cream pudding.   It was excellent.....with a great
banana taste.

and stir.......he had to help stir.......but that pudding
finally got done........i had been telling him for a few weeks i was
going to make it........bought all the stuff over a month
ago...........finally just bit the bullet and did it.

I sent this group a receipe on old bay seasoning............copy cat.

Hope yall got it.
