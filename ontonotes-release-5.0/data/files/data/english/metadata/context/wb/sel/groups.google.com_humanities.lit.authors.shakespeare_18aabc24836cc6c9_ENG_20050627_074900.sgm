An Opinion: Anti-Stratfordianism is a defense against the idea that
genius can flower undisciplinedly out of self-education, nowhere in
particular, instead of by following Rules, under the direction of
Proper Educators, in a Correct Environment.

MY opinion:

I find it unlikely, but not impossible, that someone with
Shakespeare's education, known acquaintances, and apparent
experience of life could have penned the works attributed
to him, at least without a great deal of help.

From my examination of the facts surrounding Marlowe's
death, it seems clear that the most likely explanation for
those people to have met at Deptford that day was to make
it *appear* that he was dead, whereas he did in fact survive.

It is possible to interpret the 'Shakspeare' monument at
Stratford as saying that Marlowe was commemorated in it too,
and the probability of this hidden meaning having occurred
by chance is infinitesimally small.

Regardless of what the history books tell me, therefore, it
is my considered opinion that Marlowe survived 1593, and
played a major part in writing the works normally attributed
solely to Shakespeare.

A question:

Is this explanation of why I find myself believing what I
do reflected in any way either in the tired old Stratford-
ian garbage trotted out here by Bob Grumman or, infinite-
ly more disgusting, the 'Holocaust-denial' vomit spewed
out by the likes of McCrea and his ilk?

McCrea's &quot;vomit&quot; is not &quot;infinitely more disgusting&quot; than mine, Peter,
and I resent your saying it is.

I note that you believe Shakespeare would have needed &quot;a great deal of
help&quot; to have written the works attributed to him--which sounds like
agreement with my thesis. I assume you're claiming that you're not
opposing the idea that genius can flower undisciplinedly, etc., but
only believe as you do because the facts lead that way. I continue to
wonder why you are able to see the facts as you do, though. I
unabashedly admit that I'm emotionally predisposed to like the idea
that someone self-educated wrote the Shakespearean plays.

Note: I tend to forget that Marlovians are anti-Stratfordians. There
are really two kinds of anti-Stratfordians: Marlovians and the rest.
Marlovians are much less authoritarian than other
anti-Stratfordians--many, in fact, probably not authoritarian, at all.
My opinion probably should be re-stated:

Genius is the product of two things: 1) according to a new
study, brain capacity and 2) early childhood education.

The brain actually prunes neural branches during adolescence
so you have to get the basics into the brain before adolescence.
Studies on the efficacy of Head Start bear this out.

Bacon had a 'large forehead' according to his peers, and
an unprecedented early education on the very foundation
of the Shakespeare works, the Geneva Study Bible.

The Cooke sisters were fanatical Calvinists--Bacon's aunt
struck her youngest son William so hard when he didn't
study that she killed him-- and illustrious multilingual
scholars.

Bacon escaped being struck and killed as he was reared on
Roger Asham's 'teaching with love' paedagogy.

All human beings are capable of being geniuses or close
to it in one thing or another but we live on a criminally
stupid planet because Strats have drilled it into us that
genius is a product of the 'dimme light of nature.'

That is a lie of apocalyptic proportions.

How about genius as a factor of imagination, where some individuals
have the capacity to visualize internally, conceive/idealize stuff
while day-dreaming, just sort of test out various conceptions and see
their results, etc.? I mention this because it seems threatened by
rote learning and forced-feeding programs.

&quot;Genius&quot; in intelligence testing too often refers to individuals with
great problem-solving ability and memory recall; like the highest
recorded IQ was a guy who spent his life collecting and arranging bus
transfer tickets. Even today, there seems to be resistence against
hiring some university whiz-kids who are all about doing their own
thing and ego battles. One hears about Oxford and Cambridge elites
that they are very able, but &quot;don't ask them to do anything.&quot;
Occasionally one meets Ivy Leaguers who are reluctant to reveal their
alma mater.

Also, what I read is that Elizabethan university education was largely
religious, emphasizing Greek and Latin forms. &quot;Proper educators&quot;
lectured in Latin, not English, and this continued until just before
WW II. The &quot;correct environment&quot; was moral and religious rectitude,
degrees were religious awards requiring allegance to the state
religion. One can imagine how these factor into attitudes by
University Wits competing with Shakespeare, those at the universities
who preferred him, and peers of the relm like Bacon who advocated
expression of English language and mores, instead of foreign.

But I heard Alistair Cook estimate that British undergraduate
education is superior in some unique ways, including on the sporting
fields, contributing to character development and nationalism in about
the way Elizabethans expected.

&lt;&lt;In July of 1791, Mozart was visited by a mysterious stranger clad
in grey, who commissioned a requiem mass. Mozart worked feverishly
on the score of the work, and was evidently well-paid for it. However,
his health was deteriorating, and in his febrile state he imagined that
he was writing the music for his own funeral. Mozart even believed that
he was being poisoned. By December the Requiem remained unfinished;
Mozart's friends and students gathered at the sickening composer's
bedside to sight-read through those sections that were complete in the
vocal parts. Mozart's condition worsened; on 4 December 1791 he is
reported to have emitted 'great arcs of vomit' from his mouth.
He died shortly after midnight on 5 December and was buried in a
commoners' grave, paid for by his patron Baron Gottfried van Swieten;
his burial was probably not attended by any of his friends.&gt;&gt;

At the heart of antishakesperean theology is the elitist belief that
only a university educated man, like Oxford, Marlowe, etc, could have
written the works of Shakespeare.
Read any of the antishakespeare rants, and you find this in common: a
few rants about Shakespeare not being a good father, being too
interested in commerce, and not being university educated. Then you'll
find an enormous number of coincidental links between this or that
person and the works of Shakespeare. It's elitist and moronic.
I would point out, however, that there is no reason to believe
Shakespeare's genuis flowered entirely out of self-education. Surely
he would have attended the school in Stratford?

I agree that there is no reason to believe Shakespeare's genius
flowered entirely out of self-education. But Oxfordians and Baconians
tend not to believe Shakespeare got any &quot;real&quot; education--and he would
have been primarily self-educated, even if he did. But I should revise
my opinion to:

there was a need for him to work. All he got out of school,

- Non-Stratfordian - exemplified by Brutus, who &quot;overcame himself&quot; at

The Marlovians are not elitist and neither are
the Baconians because they have no reason to be.

Bacon was not a university man--he probably
flunked out of Cambridge because his Latin
was not up to par with commoners who attended
the rigorous English Latin grammar schools.
Jonson had to edit the Novum Organum for Bacon.

On the other hand Bacon's English was immeasurably
superior to theirs because the English grammar
schools taught no English.

Bacon was poor, a commoner, a bastard and lame.

There are many impediments to the playbroker
being the author of the plays. His bio is
a perfect mismatch. Bacon is giving a famous
oration against enclosures, Coriolanus mutters
a line against enclosures and the playbroker,
now a rich burgher, is plotting to enclose
a 119-acre tithe=holding Strats innocuously
refer to as 'a field.' Enclosure was a terrible
evil. This guy was not a moral philosopher.

Measure For Measure is about the evils of
English law in regard to womens' dower rights
written just as the burgher is kicking Anne
Hathaway out of his will. (Park Honan, 1997).
Hathaway didn't get a pence and had to move
in with her drunken daughter Judith and her
alcoholic husband.

The plays are republican and Ciceronian.
The burgher is plotting against the republican
Stratford Corporation, a local entity so
republican in its processes that it
might have been set up in New England two
hundred years later. This guy didn't have
a republican bone in his body. He was straight
out of the middle ages.

We know that he was a usuer yet Merchant
is a condemnation of usury. About the same
time it was written, Bacon was thrown into
debtor's prison by a 'hard Jew' and his
sympathetic and gay brother Anthony raised
money on a property to bail Bacon out. The
Antonio in Merchant is to the life Bacon's
brother Anthony.

Elizabeth

Art,

I wanted to clarify that Nelson called Oxford 'a vulture' for getting
in line
to get the land of an executed member of the Essex circle.

Also, I wasn't referring to you as a 'fussbudget vulture'
if that's what you were thinking.

&gt;&gt; MY opinion:

&gt;&gt; I find it unlikely, but not impossible, for someone with
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's education, known acquaintances, and apparent
&gt;&gt; experience of life to have penned the works attributed to
&gt;&gt; him, at least without a great deal of help.

&gt;&gt; From my examination of the facts surrounding Marlowe's
&gt;&gt; death, it seems clear that the most likely explanation for
&gt;&gt; those people to have met at Deptford that day was to make
&gt;&gt; it *appear* that he was dead, whereas he did in fact survive.

&gt;&gt; It is possible to interpret the 'Shakspeare' monument at
&gt;&gt; Stratford as saying that Marlowe was commemorated in it too,
&gt;&gt; and the probability of this hidden meaning having occurred
&gt;&gt; by chance is infinitesimally small.

&gt;&gt; Regardless of what the history books tell me, therefore, it
&gt;&gt; is my considered opinion that Marlowe survived 1593, and
&gt;&gt; played a major part in writing the works normally attributed
&gt;&gt; solely to Shakespeare.

&gt;&gt; A question:

&gt;&gt; Is this explanation of why I find myself believing what I
&gt;&gt; do reflected in any way either in the tired old Stratford-
&gt;&gt; ian rhetoric trotted out here by Bob Grumman or, infinite-
&gt;&gt; ly more disgusting, the 'Holocaust-denial' vomit spewed
&gt;&gt; out by the likes of McCrea and his ilk?

&gt; McCrea's &quot;vomit&quot; is not &quot;infinitely more disgusting&quot; than
&gt; mine, Peter,

I'll just have to take your word for that, Bob.

Far from it. It says absolutely nothing about the need for
&quot;following Rules, under the direction of Proper Educators,
in a Correct Environment&quot;.

What I *do* think is essential (among other things, of
course) is the constant opportunity to explore exciting
new ideas with others of equal or more breadth and depth
of knowledge and experience, and/or of greater intellectual
ability. A university is only where one *starts* to do such
things. Put quite simply, just mixing with other actors all

There's the rub. You just don't like Shakespeare. It doesn't matter
how many coincidences you pile up about the little Earl, Bacon, or

The entire holocaust denier-anti-stratfordian comparison is perhaps summed
up best by Clarance Page in his editorial column today. In it, he talks
about the dust up over Sen. Jack Durbin's comment about excerpts from FBI
e-mails detailing the conditions for detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

After reading such excerpts describing detainees being shackled in a fetal
position lying in their own urine or feces for more than 24 hours with no
food or water, and others being held in conditions of extreme heat or cold
overnight, Durbin said, &quot;If I had read this to you and did not tell you that
it was an FBI agent describing what Americans had done to prisoners in their
control, you would most certainly believe this must have been done by Nazis,
Soviets in their gulags, or some mad regime--Pol Pot or others--that had no
concern for human beings.&quot;

Of course Durbin's political enemies (he is a Democrat) jumped on the
remark, saying he was smearing our troops as being indistinguishable from
Nazis.

In a nutshell, Page concludes that the truth or falsity of such a comparison
doesn't matter. When it comes to overheated comparisons, the Nazis are out
of bounds.

&quot;If there's any lesson from Durbin's gaffe,&quot; he writes, &quot;such as it is, it
is to lay off references to gulags, Pol Pot or Nazis unless you're talking
about the real thing.&quot;

I concur. No matter how true the comparison, it is unproductive to bring up
Nazis or holocaust deniers in any conversation. It serves only to distract
the discussion and often, as in McCrea's case, it seems to be a deliberate
guilt-by-association smear.

Protestations such as Peter made above, &quot;Now go back and read what I
*really* said,&quot; do no good at all when dealing with such a volatile issue.

This is what I have learned from participating in hlas.

&quot;There's the rub. You just don't like Shakespeare.&quot;

I loved Shakespeare until I looked
at the evidence.

We're dealing with three records.

The first is the Shakespeare works which are mined to find 'character
attributes' for the playbroker.

Strats have real evidence--the printed title pages--so they don't have
to manufacture an entire author from the works as do Oxfordians who
have no evidence but Strats do make massive assumptions based on the
works.

The second record is the attestation of his contemporaries in the
theatre
who call him a poet-ape--meaning he's 'aping a poet,' he's not a poet
himself, a 'clown,' a provincial rustic, a &quot;play thief&quot; and a
'supposer' or poser who pretends he's the 'Onely Poet' etc. Strats
pick out the thirty or so attestations that are favorable to their case
and suppress the other one hundred and seventy like those above.

The third record is his documented evidence, such as his will, his
deeds, his criminal record, etc.

That record shows that he was a usuer, plotted against the Stratford
Corporation with Combes to enclose a tithe-holding (plotted throw
cottagers into the road--a horrible evil in 16th c. England--Bacon
actually got a bill passed against it), kicked his wife out of his will
without a dower share (Honan), bought shares in a bawdy house
(Blackfriar's Inn) which the Puritans later seized, and Greene attests
that he's brokering stolen plays, which was common in that
era--servants would copy or steal manuscripts from aristocratic
coteries and sell them to a 'batillus' like W.S.

He also tried to commit murder in London--there's a peace warrant from
the nephew of Sir Thomas Lucy demanding that the playbroker and his
friends stop trying to do him bodily harm--and he was fined for
speculating in malt during a terrible three year famine--heavy rains
ruined crops across England three years in a row and the English were
literaly starving to death.
Fripp says that there were food riots
in Stratford and that the playbroker was probably barricaded in his
house. There was a song about the Earl of Essex hanging malt-hoarders
in their doorways--probably wishful thinking.

So this was not the great moral philosopher who wrote the highly moral
Shakespeare works.

Strats have evidence, some of it forged according to a modern scholar
('We may never know how much of the Stratford record is forged') and of
course they don't want to find out
which documents are forged--none of the Strat record has ever been
subjected to modern forensics.

We do know that the interpolation in the will giving Condell and
Hemminges 'gold rings' is a forgery.

Stratfordianism is a hollow lie but at least Strats have real
evidence--the title pages which means that they are not entirely
delusional.

Strats will always be connected to the Shakesepeare works, even if
Oxford is made Shakespeare--which I think is inevitable--just not in
the way they hoped.

&quot;It doesn't matter
how many coincidences you pile up about the little Earl, Bacon, or
Marlowe, they aren't proof.&quot;

Manuscripts aren't coincidences.

&quot;They're just coincidences. What you need
is proof that Shakespeare didn't write Shakespeare, and what that
&quot;proof&quot; comes down to again and again is &quot;His bio is a perfect
mismatch.&quot; You just don't like Shakespeare.&quot;

There's nothing to admire in the playbroker. He was a hustler in the
London theatre scene and he went back to Stratford where he set himself
as a 'gentleman.' The coat of arms never got any further than an
application but the family used it anyway.

Don't get so overwrought about this.
It boils down in the end to pieces of paper. Strats and Baconians have
paper, Oxfordians and Marlovians do not.

Cordially,

"/>

I do not know enough about people who seriously contend accepted
historical views, to know what comparison would be appropriate (in
which cases), and can only speculate. A more serious problem: I do not
know that those who &quot;deny the Holocaust,&quot; or those who identify others
as &quot;Holocaust deniers,&quot; mean the same thing I would, when they use that
term: what meaning could a &quot;Holocaust denier&quot; give to the term
&quot;Holocaust,&quot; for example, to begin with?

I agree with what Tom Reedy goes on to say -- there is no reason to
make the comparison -- but on the other hand, even if the motivations
of the two groups are not identical, if their methods are, possibly a
reasonable argument involving the similarity could be made. Yet, poor
methodology does not seem to justify the sort of extended comparison
that suggests additional points of similarity, or a moral equivalency.

"/>

Is that why? Maybe it was a clearly stupid remark, stupidly expressed,
and his opponents had a reason to criticize it. Why does anyone think
public statements by political flaks have anything to do with reality?
Their purpose is to talk, and (here) more specifically to talk trash
about someone they want the public to dislike. They do not subject
their statements to scientific analysis before publishing them, and
their statements are not subjected to any kind of analysis afterward --
their statements are chaff and they drift away on the wind, after a few
years being inaccessible even to the historian. The people who hash
out and write those statements are not Ph.D.'s on think-tank staffs!

In our Internet age, that is only becoming more the case, not less.
There is so much more information, and so much more awareness that not
all the information is good. There is more and more being &quot;published&quot;
that can be dismissed out of hand -- that didn't used to be the case.
And at the same time, the actually good information is getting much
better disseminated around the world (for instance, think of the
increased ease with which Americans can find out what Europeans and
Asians and Africans *really* think about our policies, or the fact that
you can so easily recommend a piece that my local paper doesn't carry),
so people can see that they don't need to pay attention to the
political public-relations junk.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; In a nutshell, Page concludes that the truth or falsity of such a comparison

Moreover, it's sloppy. There is no more connection between the terms
of the comparison, as used here, than, say, between pain-killing drugs
and yoga. Political writers, no more than advertisers, use &quot;truth&quot; as
a criterion for the comparisons they're going to make. Scholars (and
responsible journalists, I think) should.

So it continues, the gulliable elizabeth parrots her beloved baconian
scholar-apes unbeknowing that there *is* a difference between scholarly
inquiry and lies.

&gt;&quot;There's the rub. You just don't like Shakespeare.&quot;

&gt; I loved Shakespeare until I looked
&gt; at the evidence.

&gt; We're dealing with three records.

&gt; The first is the Shakespeare works which are mined to find 'character
&gt; attributes' for the playbroker.

&gt; Strats have real evidence--the printed title pages--so they don't have
&gt; to manufacture an entire author from the works as do Oxfordians who
&gt; have no evidence but Strats do make massive assumptions based on the
&gt; works.

&gt; The second record is the attestation of his contemporaries in the
&gt; theatre
&gt; who call him a poet-ape--meaning he's 'aping a poet,' he's not a poet
&gt; himself, a 'clown,' a provincial rustic, a &quot;play thief&quot; and a
&gt; 'supposer' or poser who pretends he's the 'Onely Poet' etc. Strats
&gt; pick out the thirty or so attestations that are favorable to their case
&gt; and suppress the other one hundred and seventy like those above.

&gt; The third record is his documented evidence, such as his will, his
&gt; deeds, his criminal record, etc.

&gt; That record shows that he was a usuer, plotted against the Stratford
&gt; Corporation with Combes to enclose a tithe-holding (plotted throw
&gt; cottagers into the road--a horrible evil in 16th c. England--Bacon
&gt; actually got a bill passed against it), kicked his wife out of his will
&gt; without a dower share (Honan), bought shares in a bawdy house
&gt; (Blackfriar's Inn) which the Puritans later seized, and Greene attests
&gt; that he's brokering stolen plays, which was common in that
&gt; era--servants would copy or steal manuscripts from aristocratic
&gt; coteries and sell them to a 'batillus' like W.S.

&gt; He also tried to commit murder in London--there's a peace warrant from
&gt; the nephew of Sir Thomas Lucy demanding that the playbroker and his
&gt; friends stop trying to do him bodily harm--and he was fined for
&gt; speculating in malt during a terrible three year famine--heavy rains
&gt; ruined crops across England three years in a row and the English were
&gt; literaly starving to death.
&gt; Fripp says that there were food riots
&gt; in Stratford and that the playbroker was probably barricaded in his
&gt; house. There was a song about the Earl of Essex hanging malt-hoarders
&gt; in their doorways--probably wishful thinking.

&gt; So this was not the great moral philosopher who wrote the highly moral
&gt; Shakespeare works.

&gt; Strats have evidence, some of it forged according to a modern scholar
&gt; ('We may never know how much of the Stratford record is forged') and of
&gt; course they don't want to find out
&gt; which documents are forged--none of the Strat record has ever been
&gt; subjected to modern forensics.

&gt; We do know that the interpolation in the will giving Condell and
&gt; Hemminges 'gold rings' is a forgery.

&gt; Stratfordianism is a hollow lie but at least Strats have real
&gt; evidence--the title pages which means that they are not entirely
&gt; delusional.

&gt; Strats will always be connected to the Shakesepeare works, even if
&gt; Oxford is made Shakespeare--which I think is inevitable--just not in
&gt; the way they hoped.

&gt;&quot;It doesn't matter

&gt;&quot;They're just coincidences. What you need
&gt; is proof that Shakespeare didn't write Shakespeare, and what that
&gt;&quot;proof&quot; comes down to again and again is &quot;His bio is a perfect
&gt; mismatch.&quot; You just don't like Shakespeare.&quot;

&gt; There's nothing to admire in the playbroker. He was a hustler in the
&gt; London theatre scene and he went back to Stratford where he set himself
&gt; as a 'gentleman.' The coat of arms never got any further than an
&gt; application but the family used it anyway.

&gt; Don't get so overwrought about this.
&gt; It boils down in the end to pieces of paper. Strats and Baconians have
&gt; paper, Oxfordians and Marlovians do not.

McCrea's remark was absolutely NOT &quot;a deliberate guilt-by-association
smear.&quot; There's no rational way you could be taking him to be saying
anti-Stratfordians believe in treating those who disagree with them the
way the Nazis did--as you HAVE to take the imbecilic Durbin to be
saying. McCrea was comparing one kind of reasoning with another, quite
validly. My own suggestion that Oxfordians and Baconians have a
pronouncedly authoritarian element in their make-up is much closer to
such a smear (but I was clever, and didn't use the f, n or a-s words).
I think barring topics, ideas, historical facts, opinions, even lies,
from discussion for any reason is a worse evil than offending or
distracting the hypersensitive.

Now, a question: if one is trying to explain why seeming intelligent
people believe, against all the facts, that Shakespeare was not
Shakespeare, what set of people considered irrational should one choose
to compare them with? Roswell-believers and von-Daniken followers
seem, surprise, too irrational to me since they bring in creatures from
outer space. Believers in various religions don't work, either,
because faith comes into their beliefs as it does not (by any
reasonable definition) come into the beliefs of any authorship cult.
Creationism? I'm not sure since religion and faith get into its
tenets. JFK Assassination buffs? The problem with them is that they,
at least, have some eye-witnesses on their side. I'm sure there are
others, but I can't think of them at the moment.

Durbin is an imbecile, but because as a politician he should have known how

qualified his statement sufficiently that any fair-minded person would know

You missed my bigger point. McCrea's comparison of the two groups' logical
lapses may have been valid--in fact, they are strikingly similar. But Page's
point--and what I have learned through experience--is that the subjects of
the holocaust and Nazis are so volatile that any point a person is trying to
make using such a comparison is lost in the overheated response.

The fact that McCrea's argument has gotten sidetracked into this discussion
proves my point.

I agree. I believe in free speech. I also believe it behooves a person to
study human nature and frame your arguments in such a manner that the

Almost all of those groups can be used. Even holocaust deniers could be

&quot;Yet your account doesn't seem to square with the Bacon Timeline, which

describes someone neither republican nor commoner.&quot;

I don't think the Baconians like admitting that Bacon was a commoner
because they have those papers from the Escurial that point to Bacon as
the Queen's bastard but Bacon did, in fact, spend a decade or more as a
commoner.

&quot;1561 January 22, born in London to Sir Nicolas Bacon, the lord keeper
of seal, and the sister-in-law of Lord Burghley. &quot;

Burghley was a commoner at that point. He didn't get a barony until
just before Oxford was forced into marrying Bacon's cousin.

Bacon is gentry on his birth certificate. Master Franciscus Bacon.
. . . .
1603 Queen Elizabeth dies, succeeded by James I in whose service Bacon
flourishes.

What this chronology omits is his father's death
and the fact that Sir Nicholas Bacon cut Francis
out of the will which was equivalent to announcing
that Bacon was a bastard.

At the reading of the will, Bacon plunged from
aristocract to commoner.

&quot;1607 Receives office of solicitor.&quot;

He was knighted in a crowd of three hundred
other Englishmen a few years earlier. At that point
he was elevated from commoner to gentry (lower
aristocracy). Correction: when he received his
MA from Cambridge in 1592 he ascended up one
degree to gentry so he was technically a commoner
for fourteen years.

&quot;1608 Named treasurer of Gray's Inn. &quot;

Anybody could be treasurer of Gray's Inn.

&quot;1613 Bacon becomes attorney general.&quot;

No rank attached to that.

&quot;1617 March 7, made lord keeper of the seal,
the same office his father had held.&quot;

Lord Keeper was an office, not a hereditary
rank. The appointment put Bacon in the upper
aristocracy proably eighth or tenth after the king.

Any rise in rank after 1611 is kind of irrelevant to
the question. Bacon was always a republican
(republican parliamentary monarchies are pretty
good systems) even as Lord Chancellor. James I
wasn't a republican.

&quot;1618 January 7, made lord chancellor, and received the title of Baron
Verulam.&quot;

Lord Chancellor is the second from the
top position after the king. I think the
Archbishop of Canterbury tops the Lord
Chancellor although they may be coequal
since the Chancery is an ecclesiastical
court.

1620 Publishes Novum Organum.
1621 Created Viscount St. Albans. Charged with bribery and found
guilty upon his own admission.

Bacon wasn't guilty and he didn't admit to the charge.
He admitted to 'corruption' but there was no law against 'corruption.'
Coke had to invent law to indict Bacon.

Ironically, Coke was shortly indicted by the law he
invented to frame Bacon.

Thanks for the antispam suggestion.

Cordially,

Elizabeth

The distinction isn't between 'scholarly inquiry'
and 'lies,' it's between 'facts' and 'lies.'

I'm not invested in any authorship faction.
I spent a lot of time comparing the evidence--Oxfordians don't have
any--before I concluded that the Baconians had the best evidence. The
problem for Baconians is that they have too much evidence. Thank god
for search engines.

It works this way, Nate. You stay with the

Put those goalposts back where they were, Bob.

How do I seem to believe that genius could flower only by
&quot;following Rules, under the direction of Proper Educators,
in a Correct Environment&quot;? I do not, and never have believed
any such thing.

On the other hand, to say that genius needs a &quot;proper
environment&quot; in which to flower begs the question of just
what a &quot;proper environment&quot; would be, other than &quot;one in
which genius can flower&quot;, which is of course tautological.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I note that you believe Shakespeare would have needed &quot;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; great deal of help&quot; to have written the works attributed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to him--which sounds like agreement with my thesis.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Far from it. It says absolutely nothing about the need for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;following Rules, under the direction of Proper Educators,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a Correct Environment&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Interesting how much more often anti-Stratfordians than
&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratfordians use such locutions as &quot;absolutely nothing.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I note that you fail to address the point I was making.

&gt; I went on to.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What I *do* think is essential (among other things, of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; course) is the constant opportunity to explore exciting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new ideas with others of equal or more breadth and depth
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of knowledge and experience, and/or of greater intellectual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ability. A university is only where one *starts* to do such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; things. Put quite simply, just mixing with other actors all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day, then tucking himself away with an excellent supply of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books would, in my view, have not been enough.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Author, according to you, would have needed a Correct
&gt;&gt;&gt; Environment

&gt;&gt; He would have needed the sort of environment I described -
&gt;&gt; which almost certainly would *not* be a 'Correct' one in the
&gt;&gt; sense you were using it here. (In accordance with an acknow-
&gt;&gt; ledged or conventional standard; proper.)

&gt; He needed an environment with the proper people in it--
&gt; self-education would not have been enough. He couldn't
&gt; have been left to his own devices, but had to have
&gt; . . . a correct environment.

"/>

So is this the same thing as &quot;following Rules, under the
direction of Proper Educators, in a Correct Environment&quot;?
Of course it isn't! What you are (quite correctly) saying
that I believe bears no resemblance to your original state-
ment. That was *not* what you meant by the words &quot;Correct
Environment&quot;, and well you know it. How does your description
encompass such groupings as the literary &quot;Areopagus&quot; or the
so-called &quot;School of Night&quot;, the University Wits, or the
Grays Inn crowd? These are just a few examples of the sort
of &quot;environment&quot; that I have in mind.

&gt;&gt; Why on earth not? I would *exclude* nobody. My question is
&gt;&gt; whether such people alone would have been sufficient, and I
&gt;&gt; doubt it.

&gt; You've caught me not quite saying exactly what I obviously meant, so
&gt; let me correct my statement to &quot;one with the right people in it (and
&gt; not ONLY mere actors or Stratford villagers or even Oxford-educated
&gt; Stratford teachers&quot;).

&gt;&gt;&gt; You imply also that he would have needed a university to
&gt;&gt;&gt; start in.

&gt;&gt; That would certainly help, but I'm not sure that I would
&gt;&gt; regard it as essential.

&gt; That you might consider it essential gives you a lean toward
&gt; fitting my generality.

"/>

No it doesn't. It is not what he would have learnt by
&quot;following Rules, under the direction of Proper Educators,
in a Correct Environment&quot; that I would consider the important
part, but the *social* (including career) opportunities it
would have opened up for him both there and later.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I assume you're claiming that you're not opposing the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idea that genius can flower undisciplinedly, etc., but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only believe as you do because the facts lead that way.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which includes the fact there is no evidence whatsoever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Shakespeare ever having mixed in the sort of circles I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; refer to above, or been able to gain the life experience(s)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that I see reflected in the works.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;No evidence whatsoever,&quot; Paul? I mean, Peter?

&gt;&gt; No evidence whatsoever, Bob. Unless you have some that I
&gt;&gt; have forgotten. The only item I can think of (other than the
&gt;&gt; works themselves of course) is that alleged letter from the
&gt;&gt; Countess of Pembroke saying that &quot;we have the man Shake-
&gt;&gt; speare with us&quot;.

&gt; Dedications to Southampton that were acknowledged by South-
&gt; ampton in such a way as to suggest strongly that Shakespeare
&gt; got into his circle of intelligentsia. Mentions in two
&gt; poems by Davies that strongly suggest Davies and Shakespeare
&gt; were in the same literary circle. Meres's reference to sonnets
&gt; circulated among private friends, which strongly suggests
&gt; Shakespeare had a circle of literary friends. The friendship
&gt; of Jonson. Anecdotal evidence about the Mermaid Inn. Shake-
&gt; speare's almost certain friendship with Fields, a publisher of
&gt; high-brow books. The fact that Leonard Digges's stepfather
&gt; was an overseer of Shakespeare's will. The fact that Shake-
&gt; speare was an important member of the leading acting troupe
&gt; in London, which performed plays in great houses and in court.
&gt; The fact that Armin, a playwright, was also in that troupe.
&gt; An indication of personal acquaintance with him by the
&gt; dramatist Thomas Heywood. I'm sure there is more.

"/>

Ah, I see the problem. We are talking about what I believe,
and how I came to believe it. Naturally this includes the
evidence as *I* would see it, and not how *you* would. Whilst
I fully understand how you come to see these things as such
evidence, I'm afraid that I don't. We could certainly argue
about each one, of course (and probably have done at various
times!) but that would take us even further from the point at

I guess we've thrashed this around enough, Peter. I think you're with
Oxforidans and Baconians in requiring Shakespeare to have had an
environment he wouldn't have automatically gotten as a normal human
being, you don't. Our debate comes down to the definition of
&quot;correct.&quot; I do think your motive are close to minimally
authoritarian--they're just more authoritarian than mine. I think the
individual can make his own way, you don't quite agree.

I note in passing that you skipped my refutation of your claim that
&quot;there is no evidence whatsoever&quot; that Shakespeare belong to a circle

which I am familiar has a &quot;meaning&quot;, be it simple or complex. But to
suggest that the meaning is necessarily &quot;hidden&quot; is, I think a function
of your desire to discover hidden meanings, not a function of the art
itself.

&gt;&gt; McCrea's remark was absolutely NOT &quot;a deliberate guilt-by-association

&gt; Then why did he go to such great lengths to extend the comparison using only
&gt; that group? He went on to envision a future when the holocaust possibly
&gt; would be seen as myth, all because of faulty reasoning used by
&gt; antistratfordians.

Right, he showed the reasoning of the literary conspiracy theorists was
the same as that of the political conspiracy theorists--except that the
litrary conspiracy theorists seemed to make more sense--i.e., were not
as preposterously refutable as the political theorists. So he
suggested that if the political theorists had waited long enough for
living witnesses to die, they could easily start to be as persuasive as
the literary theorists to the gullible. In doing this he effectively
illustrated the invalid nature of the literary theorists expecting the
kind of evidence against their 400-year-old conspiracy as can be used
against the political theorists.

Never once did McCrea suggest anything moral about the literary
theorists.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; There's no rational way you could be taking him to be saying

&gt;&gt; saying.

&gt; Durbin is an imbecile, but because as a politician he should have known how
&gt; the other side would have played his remark. The point is, disagree as much
&gt; as I do with most of what he stands for, Durbin was right. Not only that, he
&gt; qualified his statement sufficiently that any fair-minded person would know
&gt; the point he was making: Americans traditionally don't treat their prisoners
&gt; that way, at least not officially.

&gt;&gt; McCrea was comparing one kind of reasoning with another, quite
&gt;&gt; validly.

&gt; You missed my bigger point. McCrea's comparison of the two groups' logical
&gt; lapses may have been valid--in fact, they are strikingly similar. But Page's
&gt; point--and what I have learned through experience--is that the subjects of
&gt; the holocaust and Nazis are so volatile that any point a person is trying to
&gt; make using such a comparison is lost in the overheated response.

All the viable candidates, except possibly Marley, are products of good

No, but some are trying to keep him out of authorship discussions. And
the social stigma attached to many forms of political incorrectness
make it very difficult for people who don't get their outlook from the

&gt;&gt; Creationism? I'm not sure since religion and faith get into its

&gt; Almost all of those groups can be used. Even holocaust deniers could be

&quot;Certainly, every piece of art with which I am

Only if it has an author. Foucault warned us about
authorless works.

The reason that the Strat case is not settled after
four hundred years is that there's nothing in his
life to explain the works.

There are over a hundred thousand postgraduate
theses on the Shakespeare works, fully half of them
on Hamlet. Hamlet has been sliced, diced and spliced
every conceivable way because Hamlet has no author.

&quot;But to
suggest that the meaning is necessarily &quot;hidden&quot; is, I think a function

of your desire to discover hidden meanings, not a function of the art
itself.&quot;

But it IS hidden, in the sense of Foucault's essay
on authorship.

It will remain hidden until it's connected to its
author. The Oxfordian explanation apparently doesn't
satisfy Art and who can blame him. It's not even as
explanative as the STrat version.

Cordially,

When I was in Portland in 2001, Dr. Steven Steffens, Ph.D, gave a talk
that has some bearing on this discussion. It was titled &quot;Psychological
Contributions to the Study of Creativity: The Requirements for
Greatness.&quot;

The essence of the presentation had to do with statistical analysis of
how greatness in artists developed and matured and showed strong
consistentcy throughout history. (Which I'll get to in a second).

Grumman, as usual, misstates a core Anti Stratfordian belief, which
Peter refines more precisely. I believe it is a straw man argument. I
certainly and many I know would never argue that &quot;genius&quot; can't flower
independently of formal study or out of self exploration and discovery.
That would be absurd. History is replete with those who did precisely
that.

The problem as I perceive our position is two fold. The biographical
life and the art do not seem to match. This was more Peter's
orientation. Which dovetails with the more central issue, where is any
EVIDENCE, even a little, of the kinds of associations such a self
motivated life would provide? (This was Price's position which has been
vehemently fought and denied here and elsewhere.) Such as evidence of
access or ownership of BOOKS. Shakespeare referred to over 2000 Bible
verses. Did he just &quot;pop in&quot; to a friends house to look at a Bible (or
many versions apparently) when needed? &quot;Oh, I need this verse, let me
saunter to ___'s house to refresh my memory. Or a little Holinshed.
Maybe that French guy, Belleforest.&quot;

Back to Steffens. In studying great master artists across the board,
several strands of development stood out. First, there was an
ENVIRONMENT that supported the artist's nurturance. And a long period
of APPRENTICESHIP. The craft dod not spring out of &quot;thin air&quot;. Contrary
to popular belief. Mozart worked long and hard to develop his talent,
even though being a prodigy. Secondly, the first appearance of a
&quot;Master&quot; work took about ten years to blossom after this period of
apprenticeship. True for Mozart and most others.

So according to this model, Venus and Adonis could not have been a
&quot;starter&quot; piece. There had to have been some period of gestation,
juvenalia, development before such a work could emerge.

Finally, in the literary field, great writers almost always early on
had a very strong asociation with BOOKS. They played a huge role in
their early years.

So this kind of off kilter characterization is again brought up. If you
read Twain's critique, who WAS a great writer himself (unless Grumman
declares otherwise in his usual hubris), it was the seamless use of
language and metaphor that spoke to Twain of some experiential
association with the subjects in the works, not the level of formal
schooling or not. Twain himself is a prime example of the model,
spending years as a printer and developing writer (doing snippets for
local papers) before his art began to show. Where was the * REAL
evidence* for these associations for Shakespeare, somewhere, somehow,
instead of the constant, prosaic evidence in the life of money, money,
money.

Threaten someone's life(Wayte)- most likely money involved somewhere
Hoard grain-money
Buy big house-money
Only letter about-you guessed it-BORROWING MONEY
One of Best friends-MONEY LENDER
Lawsuit over-LENDING MONEY

I didn't say this before, but one aspect of the disingenuousness of
current Strat biography is that there is **far** more evidence to point
to Will as a money lender than the single name that allows those to
conjecture a complete period of life as a member of the Catholic
Underground. Why do you suppose this evidentiary line is not followed
as a part of &quot;imaginative biography?&quot; If there is going to be all this
lumping of &quot;Anti's&quot; together, then must you all answer as well for the
egregious antics of your far better known brethren?

If I take a more conservative approach, which I am willing to do, then
some of these points, especially the research Steffens cited, *might*
be taken into account as part of the considerattion of the subject.

And Tom, I applaud in a limited fashion your perspective on the
Holocaust Denial piece. But please tell me, and this has been gone over
ad nauseum, where do Holocaust Deniers gain the same stature of
intellectual currency among prominent artists and intellectuals
thoughout recent history as those who see a problem with authorship
attribution? We can disagree strongly on the nature of the evidence. Or
that there is a problem, but I do not think the situations are
analagous.

The Kennedy assassination is more apt. People disagree strongly but
many people of high regard have cause for doubt in the official
version. Are they &quot;demented&quot; for having those doubts? Are their though
processes &quot;irrational&quot;? (Just for the record, my belief is the
forensics as known suppport a single shooter from the sixth floor. But
whether this rules out any conspiracy _completely_ is a different
story, for many reasons.)

&gt; rote learning and forced-feeding programs.

&gt;&quot;Genius&quot; in intelligence testing too often refers to individuals with
&gt; great problem-solving ability and memory recall; like the highest
&gt; recorded IQ was a guy who spent his life collecting and arranging bus
&gt; transfer tickets. Even today, there seems to be resistence against
&gt; hiring some university whiz-kids who are all about doing their own
&gt; thing and ego battles. One hears about Oxford and Cambridge elites
&gt; that they are very able, but &quot;don't ask them to do anything.&quot;
&gt; Occasionally one meets Ivy Leaguers who are reluctant to reveal their
&gt; alma mater.

&gt; Also, what I read is that Elizabethan university education was largely
&gt; religious, emphasizing Greek and Latin forms. &quot;Proper educators&quot;
&gt; lectured in Latin, not English, and this continued until just before
&gt; WW II. The &quot;correct environment&quot; was moral and religious rectitude,
&gt; degrees were religious awards requiring allegance to the state
&gt; religion. One can imagine how these factor into attitudes by
&gt; University Wits competing with Shakespeare, those at the universities
&gt; who preferred him, and peers of the relm like Bacon who advocated
&gt; expression of English language and mores, instead of foreign.

&gt; But I heard Alistair Cook estimate that British undergraduate
&gt; education is superior in some unique ways, including on the sporting
&gt; fields, contributing to character development and nationalism in about
&gt; the way Elizabethans expected.

&gt; bookburn

&gt; | The brain actually prunes neural branches during adolescence

&gt; | an unprecedented early education on the very foundation
&gt; | of the Shakespeare works, the Geneva Study Bible.
&gt; |
&gt; |
&gt; | The Cooke sisters were fanatical Calvinists--Bacon's aunt

&gt; |
&gt; | Bacon escaped being struck and killed as he was reared on

Emotions are often a positive as well as a negative. For example, I
know people who react very emotionally to shocking events, but who can
empathize very well with the problems of others. Others don't react

As far as the Marlite &quot;case&quot; is concerned, whether others accept or reject
your view is irrelevant. Your game here is not persuasion but
autobiography. However, you do sometimes make claims that go beyond a mere
statement of beliefs and a history of your own spelunking in the caves of
Marlitism, and such claims (surely) ought to be available for review.
When you tell me that you believe such and such, I cannot say you are
wrong, but when you say your beliefs are supported by laws of probability
that exists outside the Marlite Caves, then you might expect to hear a
gentle demurrer.

Your monument &quot;hidden meaning&quot; bit was refuted years ago, and even you do
not believe that your solution is the only one that could be found by
someone who could be led to follow your methods -- nor have you ever been

of the probability, you have not the first clue how to do such a thing,
yet you persist in claiming that you have made some impressive

Let's look at the Gunnar value of the words Gunnar contributed to his

should not be held responsible for the gematriatic worth of my prose):

8406=Re. the following:

5130=Good point!

29739=There are some who - contrary to the evidence of their eyes - insist

26879=that Venus de Milo was originally sculpted WITH arms.

The sum of these Gunnar values is 74067. By a remarkable coincidence,
74067 is exactly the same Gunnar value as the following:

Gunnar's gematria is worthless
for rational investigation,
but his doodling toy may keep
him from more dangerous pursuits,
and thus may have some accidental
value.

16135 = Gunnar's gematria is worthless
13204 = for rational investigation,
11914 = but his doodling toy may keep
17190 = him from more dangerous pursuits,
12921 = and thus may have some accidental
2703 = value.

8406+3913+5130+29739+26879 = 16135+13204+11914+17190+12921+2703 = 74067

Explain how a comparison of the logical processes of anti-Stratfordians and
holocaust deniers is &quot;a good argument.&quot; McCrea makes plenty of good
arguments for Shakespeare as the author in his book (The university library

And nobody is blocking McCrea from making any argument. I am just pointing

Well, of course I realize as a pure artist you can't be expected to make
compromises to accomodate the sensitivities of your audience. Otherwise
they'd never have to face up to their emotional problems with being compared
to holocaust deniers and overcome them.

But those trying to persuade others, as McCrea says he is, would be
well-served by learning how to target their audience. Shakespeare did; it's
not beneath someone writing for the public.

No, I'm not saying that at all. I am saying that in this specific instance,
I agree with Clarance Page. You may have missed my point earlier in this
thread. Here it is again:

*****************

In a nutshell, Page concludes that the truth or falsity of such a comparison
doesn't matter. When it comes to overheated comparisons, the Nazis are out
of bounds.

&quot;If there's any lesson from Durbin's gaffe,&quot; he writes, &quot;such as it is, it
is to lay off references to gulags, Pol Pot or Nazis unless you're talking
about the real thing.&quot;

I concur. No matter how true the comparison, it is unproductive to bring up
Nazis or holocaust deniers in any conversation. It serves only to distract
the discussion and often, as in McCrea's case, it seems to be a deliberate
guilt-by-association smear.

Note what *he* was clearly referring to when he used the words
&quot;join in&quot;. It concerned not joining &quot;antistratfordianism&quot; in
being compelled to rely on its own imposed &quot;hidden meanings&quot;.
Yes? So, when I repeated his words (within quotation marks) it
was, one would have thought, perfectly clear that it was this
meaning that I had in mind.

But any opportunity to demean his opponent by misrepresenting
their words is irresistible to Terry. So the meaning of &quot;join

Briefly, however, as I keep pointing out, this is a *riddle*
and therefore not invalidated by the possible existence of
more than one answer. Here is an example of a similar type
of puzzle from the same period that I have used before:

The enemy to the stomach and the word of disgrace
Is the name of the gentleman with a bold face.

The answer is &quot;Raleigh&quot; made up of the words 'raw' and
'lie', but would it prove that it is *not* a puzzle if
more than one answer could be found? For example, how
about &quot;Sackvile&quot; or &quot;Achely&quot;? Of course it wouldn't, any
more than Terry's conjuring up an alternative answer to
the monument's riddle does. The trick is to find which
answer best fits the clues, not to establish that it is
the only one possible.

It would be nice if, one day, Terry did try to refute the
points that I made in my post &quot;Why the Monument's 'Riddle'
is Valid&quot;, and preferably with as few of his twenty (+)
rhetorical ploys as possible?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is possible to interpret the 'Shakspeare' monument at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratford as saying that Marlowe was commemorated in it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; too, and the probability of this hidden meaning having
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; occurred by chance is infinitesimally small.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course the &quot;hidden meaning&quot; did not occur by chance: it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was imposed by you. Some Oxfordians have similarly imposed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;hidden meanings&quot; that they find just as delightful to them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as your &quot;hidden meaning&quot; is to you. The probability than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a brand of antistratfordianism will arise that is NOT comp-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elled to rely on its own imposed &quot;hidden meanings&quot; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; infinitesimally small, but that is no reason why the rest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of us should join in.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't recall asking anyone to &quot;join in&quot;, Terry.

&gt;&gt; I don't recall that this unmoderated newsgroup was your
&gt;&gt; soliloquy corner, where nothing was allowed from the rest
&gt;&gt; of us but respectful or dozing silence.

&gt; For those of you not familiar with Terry's debating technique,
&gt; this is a perfect illustration of the 'semantic switch' he
&gt; uses at every opportunity. It is in fact an example of the
&gt; first item on my list of Terry's 20 favourite ploys. ('Mis-
&gt; understand', misrepresent, or falsify what your opponent
&gt; has said.)

"/>

I only wish it had been a ploy -- it was a case of carelessness and
misreading.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Note what *he* was clearly referring to when he used the words
&gt;&quot;join in&quot;. It concerned not joining &quot;antistratfordianism&quot; in
&gt; being compelled to rely on its own imposed &quot;hidden meanings&quot;.
&gt; Yes? So, when I repeated his words (within quotation marks) it
&gt; was, one would have thought, perfectly clear that it was this
&gt; meaning that I had in mind.

"/>

It is indeed &quot;perfectly clear,&quot; and I completely misread it. If I could
pretend that my misreading was deliberate or calculated, then I might feel
a little bit less stupid at the moment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; But any opportunity to demean his opponent by misrepresenting their
&gt; words is irresistible to Terry. So the meaning of &quot;join in&quot; is switched
&gt; to taking part in *this* discussion on *this* newsgroup. Easy, isn't it?

"/>

Too easy. I should have been more careful. Peter, please accept the most
abject apology I can offer (I am at this point sporting a bruise on my
nose caused by an attempt to bow from the ankles).

Much of the rest of Peter's post deals with reasonably honest
disagreements and with a few well placed and perhaps well deserved
shots. I'd rather not dilute this apology by offering any &quot;yes, but&quot;
observations.

Peter, I am sorry.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as this thread is concerned, whether others accept
&gt;&gt;&gt; or reject my view on this is irrelevant.

&gt; Note that I am talking just about the relevance &quot;as far as
&gt; this thread is concerned&quot; of whether I am thought to be right
&gt; or wrong. It is of course of considerable relevance to me
&gt; when it comes to discussion of my views in general. Terry
&gt; knows this full well, but it suits his purpose to ignore
&gt; that point. (Ploy number 6 of his, in fact - Ignore an
&gt; important part of what is said to make the rest of it easier
&gt; to deal with.)

&gt;&gt; As far as the Marlite &quot;case&quot; is concerned, whether others
&gt;&gt; accept or reject your view is irrelevant. Your game here
&gt;&gt; is not persuasion but autobiography.

&gt; My &quot;game&quot; on this newsgroup, as I have explained many times,
&gt; is primarily, but not exclusively, to test out my own ideas
&gt; on the authorship question and to encourage an informed
&gt; challenge to the information or reasoning upon which they
&gt; are based. Such rational discussion is unfortunately
&gt; becoming an ever rarer phenomenon here.

&gt;&gt; However, you do sometimes make claims that go beyond a mere
&gt;&gt; statement of beliefs and a history of your own spelunking
&gt;&gt; in the caves of Marlitism, and such claims (surely) ought
&gt;&gt; to be available for review.

&gt; See, he's still pretending that I said he shouldn't comment
&gt; on my words.

&gt;&gt; When you tell me that you believe such and such, I cannot
&gt;&gt; say you are wrong, but when you say your beliefs are supported
&gt;&gt; by laws of probability that exists outside the Marlite Caves,
&gt;&gt; then you might expect to hear a gentle demurrer.

&gt; And again! Where was Terry when we discussed this last April?
&gt; There was one post from him, in fact, but it had nothing to
&gt; do with the topic itself.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I was stating one of the reasons why *I* believe what
&gt;&gt;&gt; I do, responding to Bob's opinion that &quot;Anti-Stratford-
&gt;&gt;&gt; ianism is a defense against the idea that genius can
&gt;&gt;&gt; flower undisciplinedly out of self-education, nowhere
&gt;&gt;&gt; in particular, instead of by following Rules, under the
&gt;&gt;&gt; direction of Proper Educators, in a Correct Environment&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; as far as it applied to me.

&gt;&gt; Your statement of belief is unimpeachable; your claim to
&gt;&gt; have external and objective props for those beliefs may
&gt;&gt; be a fit topic for investigation by those who do not share
&gt;&gt; your beliefs.

&gt; Indeed they may be. Who or what has stopped him?

&gt;&gt;&gt; My reasons for claiming that &quot;the the probability of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; hidden meaning I see in the monument having occurred by
&gt;&gt;&gt; chance is infinitesimally small&quot; has had quite enough of
&gt;&gt;&gt; an airing, I think - most recently in the &quot;Why the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Monument's 'Riddle' is Valid&quot; thread which I started last
&gt;&gt;&gt; April 15th.

&gt;&gt; Your monument &quot;hidden meaning&quot; bit was refuted years ago,

&gt; Terry would have us believe that rhetorical jiggery-pokery,
&gt; such as that which he demonstrated above, equals refutation.
&gt; Not in my book, it doesn't. If I recall correctly, once
&gt; stripped of the irrelevant material, his argument boiled
&gt; down to saying that he didn't think it was a very good
&gt; puzzle, and that it was possible to get more than one
&gt; answer to it. But it took him about 20,000 words to say so.

&gt; (Ploy number 3 - Expand the verbiage and data beyond the
&gt; level that most readers can tolerate.)

&gt;&gt; and even you do not believe that your solution is the
&gt;&gt; only one that could be found by someone who could be led
&gt;&gt; to follow your methods -- nor have you ever been willing
&gt;&gt; to answer that long-standing refutation.

&gt; As it happens, I thought that my post of 21 June 2004,
&gt; responding to Terry's of 11 June on the &quot;Bacon and Bede&quot;
&gt; thread, did a pretty good job of answering it. He certainly
&gt; gave no sign of wanting to discuss it any further after that.

&gt; Briefly, however, as I keep pointing out, this is a *riddle*
&gt; and therefore not invalidated by the possible existence of

Apology accepted, of course, Terry. Most disappointing to

One question. Your post did seem to indicate that you

I just found it on google but don't remember it's having come to my usenet
server. I will answer it (on a new thread) as it has a number of
interesting points (e.g., Galileo and Huygens, and your response on
calculating odds).
