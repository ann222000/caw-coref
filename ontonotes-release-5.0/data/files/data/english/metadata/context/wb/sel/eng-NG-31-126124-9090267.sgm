There's a preview of the first four pages of the JLA Wedding Special
on Newsrama:

http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Sept07/previews/wedding.html

Given I think the Black Canary/Green Arrow makes no sense, either in
terms of character development (once a cheat...) or recent story
development (long story short: she's supposed to be the man who killed
her adopted daughter but she's somehow still marrying him), or how
lame the Ed Benes cover is (if he'd drawn this as an art school
assignment, he'd get about a &quot;C+&quot;), I shouldn't have been looking at
this at all, but Dwayne McDuffie is writing it and will be writing the
JLA and after his great work on JLU I just had to.  I now regret it.

Not that it's bad.  The art is nice and I have faith in McDuffie, but
I'm prevented from enjoying this by the hot editorial mess that DC is
right now and my own Continuity Cop obsessions.

I see Deathstroke and think &quot;This man destroyed Bludhaven, but isn't
being hunted by anyone anywhere!?!&quot;  This undermines pretty much every
superhero in the DCU---especially Nightwing---but also any sort of law
enforcement.  Sarge Steel is chasing after Wonder Woman for because of
Maxwell Lord, but not Slade?  Not to mention the Brotherhood who
actually dropped Chemo?  (I know I keep repeating this, but it remains
a huge problem for me)

I see Dr. Light and think &quot;Wasn't the big fear he'd brag about raping
Sue Dibny which was part of the mindwipe rationale?  So why hasn't he
been bragging to everyone everywhere?

I know jail is a joke in comics, but there used to be a time when
they'd bother showing you how these guys got out.  Now it's beneath
everyone. So many on that spread should be in jail, beginning with The
Joker who should be scarred and in jail!  Couldn't this at least begin
with Luthor breaking them out to form the group?  And wasn't Grodd
thrown in the Phantom Zone at one point with the approval of the UN?

Black Manta died wonderfully in Aquaman.  That, after all these years,
Aquaman would continue tolerating the murderer of his son was finally
ended. Yet, there he is.

Isn't Major Force's head flying through the galaxy?

Isn't Cheshire pregnant with Catman's baby?  You'd think after being
nearly killed by Deathstroke she'd be taking better care of herself
and the baby she wanted so badly.  And shouldn't Chesire be trying to
kill Deathstroke after he tried to kill her?

Don't Grodd and Deathstroke have a blood feud over Grodd killing his
wife?

These questions and so may more plague my brain and prevent me from
enjoying what just might be an old-fashioned fun superhero vs.
supervillain story.

It's hard out here for a fanboy...

Superheroes treat dangerous - even murderous - supervillains as if
they were high-school pranksters whenever it's convenient to the plot.
It's the form of the Idiot Plot - let's call it the &quot;Moral Idiot
Plot.&quot;

There have been a number of encounters between well-respected,
powerful heroes and Jason Todd (who killed minor criminals and tried
to frame Nightwing for the job). After angry words, they let him walk
away.

In Identity Crisis, it was revealed that the JLA knew perfectly well
where the Satellite of Supervillains was. Apparently they considered
the intel they could get from that knowledge to be more important than
arresting the murderers on board; but they've rarely, if ever, used
that intel in a useful way.

Black Adam, after killing millions, was defeated by Just About Every
Superhero In The DCU, and depowered. Somehow he &quot;slipped away.&quot;
Apparently Atom-Smasher helped him? Ooooh, Atam-Smasher! Well, he
could always block MY x-ray vision, telepathic powers, and magical
abilities.

But then, the heroes never seem very set on capturing Lobo, and he's
committed genocide on a planetary scale. But he once had is own comic,
and he's got a fan base, so I guess that protects him.

Another strange thing is that the Black Canary and Green Arrow seem
set on having a very public ceremony, with all their friends attending
in costume. Even a mediocre wedding planner would point out that this
is an invitation to a major supervillain attack.

I have no objection to the wedding turning into a hero/villain melee.
But the heroes should be working a little harder to prevent it, the
villains should have to work a little harder to find out about it and
plan it, and the writers should have to work a little harder to make
the story cohere.

Then I'd expect that when we see Ollie and Dinah talk privately about

I question that there's even a public announcement that Green Arrow
and Black Canary are getting married.  It should be Oliver Queen and
Dianah Lance getting married.  First of all, they'd have to get a
marriage license and it would have to be in their legal names.  A
matter of public record that, if they were to get married in their
fighting identies, a villain would be able to look up and discover
their civilian identities (not that Deathstroke doesn't already.)

Hopefully this wedding is taking place on a private island.

The League of Assassins also thinks that BC blames THEM for Sin's
death, NOT Green Arrow. When Sin &quot;died&quot; BC flipped out on the
Assassins, and didn't display any of her anger toward GA in front of
them. For all they know, she forgave him. What are they
psychotherapists now? They're sociopaths! What the hell do they know

This one actually does make sense: He doesn't want to give the JLA an
excuse to really beat the snot out of him, and he's probably better off
as the victim (look what those so-called heroes did to me) rather than
reminding everybody that this was in retaliation for an act most of the
Rogues would consider reprehensible.

&gt;Big Events and trafic court isn't so much, they may be a bigger
&gt;strain on willing suspension of disbelief.)

&gt;  A matter of public record that, if they were to
&gt;&gt; get married in their fighting identies, a villain would be able
&gt;&gt; to look up and discover their civilian identities (not that
&gt;&gt; Deathstroke doesn't already.)

&gt;Does Ollie have a secret identity again?
">

Well, apparently with the OYL Ollie as Mayor no one knew except, it
seems, Deathstroke.  No explanation, either ignoring what went before
or else relying on assumed Super??? Prime punch.

I cannot agree with you more...this storyline is utterly ridiculous at
this point...it makes no sense and will only harm both
characters...Ollie can't be Ollie if he's hitched and Dinah just looks
pathetic taking him back after he's cheated on her over and over...and
I cringe at the thought that, just as she has whenever she's been with
him in the past, she will likely revert to the &quot;damsel in distress&quot;
mode and all the great character building that has gone on throughout
the course of the Birds of Prey series will be lost.

I think the point was that the world (more specifically the League of

marrying the man who supposedly killed her, and very publically at
that, it might send up a red flag or two about what really happened.

Look at the preview again.  They know full well he's a rapist, but
only the &quot;chick villains&quot; have a problem with it to the point of not
wanting to work with him.

But there is something to be said of a story wherein they learn his
mindwipe was because of a rape.  As far as they know, the JLA just up

Sigh.  If smart, competent writers were there, the very circumstances

&gt; There have been a number of encounters between well-respected,

&gt; to frame Nightwing for the job). After angry words, they let him walk
&gt; away.

&gt; In Identity Crisis, it was revealed that the JLA knew perfectly well
&gt; where the Satellite of Supervillains was. Apparently they considered
&gt; the intel they could get from that knowledge to be more important than
&gt; arresting the murderers on board; but they've rarely, if ever, used
&gt; that intel in a useful way.

&gt; Black Adam, after killing millions, was defeated by Just About Every
&gt; Superhero In The DCU, and depowered. Somehow he &quot;slipped away.&quot;
&gt; Apparently Atom-Smasher helped him? Ooooh, Atam-Smasher! Well, he
&gt; could always block MY x-ray vision, telepathic powers, and magical
&gt; abilities.

&gt; But then, the heroes never seem very set on capturing Lobo, and he's
&gt; committed genocide on a planetary scale. But he once had is own comic,
&gt; and he's got a fan base, so I guess that protects him.

&gt; Another strange thing is that the Black Canary and Green Arrow seem
&gt; set on having a very public ceremony, with all their friends attending
&gt; in costume. Even a mediocre wedding planner would point out that this
&gt; is an invitation to a major supervillain attack.

&gt; I have no objection to the wedding turning into a hero/villain melee.
&gt; But the heroes should be working a little harder to prevent it, the
&gt; villains should have to work a little harder to find out about it and
&gt; plan it, and the writers should have to work a little harder to make
&gt; the story cohere.

&gt; &gt; Superheroes treat dangerous - even murderous - supervillains as if

&gt; &gt; It's the form of the Idiot Plot - let's call it the &quot;Moral Idiot
&gt; &gt; Plot.&quot;

&gt; &gt; There have been a number of encounters between well-respected,
&gt; &gt; powerful heroes and Jason Todd (who killed minor criminals and tried
&gt; &gt; to frame Nightwing for the job). After angry words, they let him walk
&gt; &gt; away.

&gt; &gt; In Identity Crisis, it was revealed that the JLA knew perfectly well
&gt; &gt; where the Satellite of Supervillains was. Apparently they considered
&gt; &gt; the intel they could get from that knowledge to be more important than
&gt; &gt; arresting the murderers on board; but they've rarely, if ever, used
&gt; &gt; that intel in a useful way.

&gt; &gt; Black Adam, after killing millions, was defeated by Just About Every
&gt; &gt; Superhero In The DCU, and depowered. Somehow he &quot;slipped away.&quot;
&gt; &gt; Apparently Atom-Smasher helped him? Ooooh, Atam-Smasher! Well, he
&gt; &gt; could always block MY x-ray vision, telepathic powers, and magical
&gt; &gt; abilities.

&gt; &gt; But then, the heroes never seem very set on capturing Lobo, and he's
&gt; &gt; committed genocide on a planetary scale. But he once had is own comic,
&gt; &gt; and he's got a fan base, so I guess that protects him.

&gt; &gt; Another strange thing is that the Black Canary and Green Arrow seem
&gt; &gt; set on having a very public ceremony, with all their friends attending
&gt; &gt; in costume. Even a mediocre wedding planner would point out that this
&gt; &gt; is an invitation to a major supervillain attack.

&gt; &gt; I have no objection to the wedding turning into a hero/villain melee.
&gt; &gt; But the heroes should be working a little harder to prevent it, the
&gt; &gt; villains should have to work a little harder to find out about it and
&gt; &gt; plan it, and the writers should have to work a little harder to make
&gt; &gt; the story cohere.

&gt; it's fiction
">

You keep saying this. It's a non sequiter.

Everybody knows it's fiction. That's why we keep referring to &quot;the
story&quot; and &quot;the writers.&quot; Maybe you missed that.

Most people believe that even fiction can be evaluated by various
standards, and therefore can be discussed. If you don't believe this,
what are you doing on this discussion board - besides repeating
yourself?

I'm just wondering... Did they expect that ANYBODY would finish reading
Black Canary #3 and think she was really dead? It seemed like an odd
excuse for a &quot;cliffhanger,&quot; since we all knew what was happening (though
not exactly why and how).

Too true. Ra's Al Ghul anyone?  And I'm still disappointed she never
hooked up with The Ray.  I enjoyed his little crush on her.  Then
again, young and sweet, he probably would have worshipped and adored
her.  The last thing she'd ever want.

But the problem is, she's supposed to be smarter now.  This kinda
proves she's not.

Yes, but in the stories of which you speak, the cliffhanger is that the
hero is endangered and the suspense is how he's going to get out of the
situation. Here, Sin is already &quot;dead&quot;, though most readers know it's
all a fake. That doesn't make it a real cliffhanger at all, just a
prelude to an anti-climax -- AND a bit of an insult to our intelligence
if the writer really expected us to believe she was dead.

It's a structural thing: This would have been fine for, say, page 24 of
a 32-page story -- but not for the climax of an issue (though I suppose
the writer thought of this as taking place 3/4 of the way through a
graphic novel, not the end of Issue #3).

The one that always sticks in my mind is the Kyle Rayner GL
issue which ends with the crab mask floating to the surface of
a volcano. Because somebody who was evidently very new to
comics believed it, and wrote a letter of complaint.

I'm also sure it's a cliche cliffhanger for the villain to
throw the apparently-dead hero's body in front of the shocked
supporting cast, but I can't think of any actual examples just
now.

And I'm saying that it's pretty obvious from the circumstances of her

that she wasn't really dead...I doubt they really expected many to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering... Did they expect that ANYBODY would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; finish reading Black Canary #3 and think she was really
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dead? It seemed like an odd excuse for a &quot;cliffhanger,&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; since we all knew what was happening (though not exactly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; why and how).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh come on...how many super-hero stories over the years
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have had cliff hangers with the lead character seemingly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; getting killed?  You know it won't happen but they do it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all the time...at least in Sin's case (not being a title
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; character), it was feasible that she COULD die even if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the story made it pretty obvious that she didn't.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, but in the stories of which you speak, the cliffhanger
&gt;&gt;&gt;is that the hero is endangered and the suspense is how he's
&gt;&gt;&gt;going to get out of the situation. Here, Sin is already
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;dead&quot;, though most readers know it's all a fake. That
&gt;&gt;&gt;doesn't make it a real cliffhanger at all, just a prelude
&gt;&gt;&gt;to an anti-climax -- AND a bit of an insult to our
&gt;&gt;&gt;intelligence if the writer really expected us to believe
&gt;&gt;&gt;she was dead.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's a structural thing: This would have been fine for,
&gt;&gt;&gt;say, page 24 of a 32-page story -- but not for the climax
&gt;&gt;&gt;of an issue (though I suppose the writer thought of this as
&gt;&gt;&gt;taking place 3/4 of the way through a graphic novel, not
&gt;&gt;&gt;the end of Issue #3).

&gt;&gt; Those aren't the stories I was thinking of...there are a
&gt;&gt; lot of stories that end with a cliffhanger of the hero
&gt;&gt; supposedly dead...not just in mortal danger but actually
&gt;&gt; dead...sometimes with other characters reacting to this
&gt;&gt; death (even though it's obvious to the reader that the
&gt;&gt; character will not actually turn out to be dead)...the one
&gt;&gt; that springs to mind (because I re-read it recently) was
&gt;&gt; during the Batman: Knightsend story when Batman jumps in
&gt;&gt; the Batmobile but Azrael has rigged it to
&gt;&gt; explode...Nightwing and Robin are on hand to witness
&gt;&gt; Batman's &quot;death&quot; and react as such...and then, in the next
&gt;&gt; issue, it is revealed that Batman got out before the
&gt;&gt; explosion...it's no different from Sin's &quot;death.&quot;

&gt;The one that always sticks in my mind is the Kyle Rayner GL
&gt;issue which ends with the crab mask floating to the surface of
&gt;a volcano. Because somebody who was evidently very new to
&gt;comics believed it, and wrote a letter of complaint.
">

I also remember another Kyle story from Winick's run on GL where the
issue ended with him being basically incinerated...and the Starman
issue that ended with Jack being ACTUALLY incinerated...the more I
think about it, the more I remember...it happens all the time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I'm also sure it's a cliche cliffhanger for the villain to
&gt;throw the apparently-dead hero's body in front of the shocked
&gt;supporting cast, but I can't think of any actual examples just
&gt;now.
">

Same here...weird...I know I've seen that a lot but I can't think of a
single specific example...unless you count the latest Harry Potter
book (but that's neither here nor there).

&gt; &gt;Clearly the writers aren't expecting us to believe that Batman's dead.
&gt; &gt;My original question was whether they expected us to believe that Sin was.

&gt; And I'm saying that it's pretty obvious from the circumstances of her
&gt; death and the placement as the cliffhanger of the penultimate issue
&gt; that she wasn't really dead...I doubt they really expected many to
&gt; believe she was.- Hide quoted text -

--I'm one of those who didn't think for a second that she was dead.
It was clear midway through issue 3, that something drastic had to be
done as the League of Assassins *would* continually try to acquire
Sin.  So, while it's a cliche, the old &quot;faked death&quot; bit entered my
mind even before the last few pages.
