Which types of vehicles do you think would be able to descend to a
habitable planet - 11 km/s gravity well - land on a completely
unprepared spot no spaceport), take off with no rebuilding OR
refueling, then climb out of the said gravity well, with some payload
picked up from the planet?

The only body which anything has taken off from is Moon. Nothing has
ever taken off from Mars!

Any descriptions/speculations about space warfare should first answer
the question of what your landers are...

Before that question is the question of where you want to land.
There's
only one rocky body in the Solar System so freakishly large that it
takes 11km/s to escape its gravity well from its surface.

One idea I've been pondering lately is how something like Starship
Troopers might actually work if we assume they live in a Saturn-like
moon system (but close enough to the star to put all the moons in
the habitable zone).  All it takes is a few impacts/volcanoes to
spread
microbe life from one moon to the others.  Thus, many of the moons
co-evolve biospheres.  These moons, having a much lower surface
gravity than our own, would be perfect places for armored space
marines to jump across the landscape.  With shallower gravity wells,
it wouldn't take much delta-v for a chemical rocket lander to land
and immediately take off after recovering the marines.

There are approximately two such freaky bodies, if you count over 10
as approximately 11.

A moon in the habitable zone is uninhabitable like, well, Moon, unless
it has a sufficient gravity well. We know that Mars, with 5 km/s
gravity well, is still uninhabitable, and outside habitable zone. And
an oxygen-rich, carbon-dioxide-poor atmosphere is actually harder to
hold (because carbon dioxide keeps exosphere cool by radiating heat
awa, which oxygen does not do). So, any habitable moons have escape
speed over 5 km/s.

How much delta vee did the ship need to arrive at the planet?

Much of the the delta vee for descent to surface could be accomplished
via aerobraking (but this adds mass and complexity - a shield to protect
the payload would be needed).

The atmosphere gives as well as takes away delta vee, though. On the
ascent atmospheric drag subtracts. And the atmosphere necessitates a
higher altitude before the major burn is done resulting in a higher
gravity penalty. Add about 2 km/sec.

Let's say the mission is from earth's surface to one of Landis' floating
cities 50 km above the surface of Venus and back.

Ascent drag &amp; gravity penalty      2.0 km/sec
Entry to Venus Hohmann Transfer   11.3 km/sec
Exit Hohmann to Venus capture       .5 km/sec
Descent to Landis City             0.1 km/sec (aerobraking)
Ascent drag &amp; gravity penalty      2.0 km/sec
Entry to Earth Hohmann Tranfer    10.6 km/sec
Exit Hohmann to Earth capture       .4 km/sec
Descent to Earth Surface           0.1 km/sec (aerobraking)
Total                             27.0 km/sec

If it were a chemical rocket with 4 km/sec exhaust velocity the
fuel mass to payload ratio (with no payload picked up from Venus) would
be e^(27/4) - 1 or about 850 to 1. I'm guessing it'd be difficult to
make even a fuel tank that's only 1/850 the mass of the fuel it encloses.

I believe the rockets would have to be nuclear.

The Earth and Venus capture orbits both have 300 km perigees and about
900,000 and 600,000 km apogees respectively. A little delta vee can be
shed each perigee via aerobraking. But you'd still need some burns to
finesse the passes through atmosphere.

In another NG John Schilling recently gave me an atmospheric
drag/gravity penalty for ascending from Mars. If I have time, I may try
to whomp up a Martian delta vee budget.

Most sensible proposals call for return fuel and reaction mass to be
manufactured from Martian resources (IMO).

How would you manufacture reaction mass?

Reaction mass - air may be considered, but most planes and
airbreathing engines do not work well after the first km/s of
deltavee. And Martian atmosphere is not oxidizer, so you have to carry
both oxidizer and reducer, and breathe air purely for inert reaction
mass/cooling airflow. Habitable planets may have more useful air, but
actually might not.

What exactly are your alternatives?

Sure, if your target planet has a very small population, or a poorly

disembark your soldiers and their weapons at leisure, then engage in
conventional planetary surface warfare against enemies. But if you
have technologically sophisticated and at all numerous enemy, they are

Isn't Titan the only moon we know of with a substantial atmosphere? I'm
not sure Titan would have an atmosphere if it were in the habitable zone.

But our solar system is too small of a data point to extrapolate with
confidence. A system of habitable moons about a gas giant is possible, I
suppose. Your scenario is far more plausible than Heinlein's.

Use solar or nuclear energy to crack CO2 to CO &amp; O2 with a Sabatier
plant. Haul in hydrogren or get it from Martian ice.

Robert Zubrin is one of the most well known advocates of use of in situ

Hm.  The web seems to say the Sabatier process is

CO2 + 4H2 -&gt; CH4 + 2H2O

So basically, you need the energy to electrolyze water to get
hydrogen to start with, a bit of energy to run the above reaction to
get methane at high temperatures, and you get some water back out to
recycle (though only about half).  You have left over oxygen that way...
but just enough to burn the methane later.

But I digress.

It's been awhile since I read Zubrin's books. If I remember right he
advocated using solar or nuclear energy to break Mars' carbon dioxide
into carbon monoxide and oxygen. The plants doing this would be sent in
unmanned missions preceding the manned missions. Geoffrey Landis' book
_Mars Crossing_ used a similar mission architecture.

If I remember right he advocated bringing hydrogen from earth or
electrolysis to get hydrogen from Martian water if it proved practical.

It's possible I misremembered that Zubrin advocated using Sabatier
plants. The process you describe seems different than the one I recall.
He did say methane was a good rocket fuel and a lot easier to deal with
than hydrogen.

One idea that I've been thinking about for a habitable planet lander is
a seaplane. Something vaguely along the lines of SpaceShipOne, but
beefed up a bit to be capable of surface-to-escape flight. Making it
capable of landing on a lake means that it won't need a prepared landing
site.

I speculate that most habitable planets will have lakes.

I had misremembered. Starting the bottom of page 4 of _The Case For
Mars_ by Robert Zubrin:
&quot;...a light truck carrying a small nuclear reactor trundles out. ... The
reactor kicks in and begins to energize the chemical processing unit
with 100 kilowatts of electricity. Now the chemical plant goes to work,
producing rocket propellant by sucking in the Martian air with a set of
pumps and reacting it with the hydrogen hauled from Earth aboard the
ERV. Martian air is 95 percent carbon dioxide gas (CO2). The chemical
plant combines the carbon dioxide with hydrogen (2), producing methane
(CH4), which the ship will store for later use as rocket fuel, and water
(H2O). This methanation reaction is a simple, straightforward chemical
process that has been practiced in industry since the 1890s. ...&quot;

I am wondering where cracking carbon dioxide to get carbon monoxide and
oxygen came from. I believe it was another scheme for using Martian in
situ resources that I read at about the same I read _The Case For Mars_.

My apologies for tossing out misinformation.

Well, let's see... if you give me 10 tons of semi-intelligent (i.e.,
targetable, programmable, active-during-entry kinetic-kill
&quot;crowbars&quot;... read the book &quot;David's Sling&quot; sometime), that works out
to 100 100-kg impactors, impact energy to be determined, but
potentially high (certainly as high or better than a similar mass of
conventional explosives), and not interceptable. Maintance cost on
these in orbit are nil, as are the actual cost of the devices
(compared with, say, your average army troop in terms of *just*
education/training, not to mention the 30 kg of very high-tech gear
you've equiped each and every one with). Oh, and I don't have to
retreive my kinetic-kill crowbars from the surface (I might have to
pay for the environmental impact statement however), which is another
very very drastic cost savings.

And there's at least one crux of the issue - if my 10 tons of crowbars
cost 1/10th what your 10 tons of space troopers do, then I can
probably end up with 100 tons... or even more, because I can replace
mine by assembly line very rapidly, while you have to graw and educate
yours the old fasion way, and there's probably a much more significant
political/economic backlash for loosing them.

Are there things you want intelligent troops on the ground for? Yep...
but even today, with presumably much *much* lower tech than in a
hypothetical interplanetary war, more and more roles are being taken
over by the cheap and expendble robot (and yes, a $100k PackBot is
*very* cheap compared to the average soldier in terms of bquipment and
training). Thus why we have even today UAVs and an increasing array of
UGVs (a much tougher environment), and some unmanned boats (although I
do't think any yet have autonomous control over the weapon systems...
we're not at Skynet yet :-).

Yep - Zubrin notes that to take best advantage of the methane fuel,
you need to burn it not at a 2:1 ratio, but around a 3.5:1 ratio, so
ideally you want extra oxidizer in the mix... and to get that he
proposes using either direct thermal decomposition of 2 CO2 into 2 CO
+ O2, or using the hydrogen again to drive the water-gas shift CO2 +
H2 --&gt; CO + H2O (reuse the H2O after electrolysis), or doing high-
temperature decomposition of the methane to yield pryolitic carbon
which when you pass CO2 over it you get CO, which you can use to
generate O2.

As long as those dangerous things are sitting in some hidden

If you don't know where the targets are in a few hundred million
square kilometers, putting a hundred (or a thousand, or ten thousand)
troops on the ground doesn't sound like a really ideal solution to me.
One satellite overhead will give you more information than 10,000
troops on the ground... especially since given the mass constraints
they'll be on foot (unless you are upping that 100 ton example
limit... considerably).

&gt; The only body which anything has taken off from is Moon. Nothing has

&gt; Any descriptions/speculations about space warfare should first answer

1) unprepared spot :  you need a VTOVL

2) 11 km/s gravity well:  you need a power supply and an engine that
allow, say, 13 km/s delta V, and a thrust at take off of about 1.5
times the gravity*take_off_mass of the veichle .... but this is a very
rough extimate

3) the planet has an atmosphere: your veicle need a termal shield for
re-entry.  This is good, because if not you had to brake using the
rocket/mass reaction engines an so you need a total 22 km/s deltaV
capability.... aerobrake during reentry allow to save a lot of
propellant and energy

The most minimalist design for this could look like a carenated LEM
with a termal shield.... something like DC-X Delta Clipper or other
proposed SSTOs: a lot of shapes are possible.

If you need just to land and take off to orbit and you've not got
airbreathing engines, you don't need an airplane like shape: you have
to exit atmosphere as soon as possible during vertical take off (not
exactly vertical, trayectory optimization for a space launch is not a
simple matter).

The only exotic technology to do this is a power supply.

If you had a light multi terawatt electric generator on board,
probably an engine capable of this performances using few reaction
mass (with a decent mass ratio for the veichle) is feasible.

Of course maybe somebody will invent something capable of
magnetofluiddynamically &quot;move&quot; the atmosphere gases around the veichle
to generate thrust.... this will be another story. And maybe this
thing will be disc shaped :-))

It just occured to me that my favorite rocket drive would
work, and probably work better than any alternatives
mentioned so far.

First off, nuclear doesn't offer the desired performance,
unless you use an Orion style nuclear bomb based
solution.  Without nukes, a nuclear rocket lacks the
critical combination of both high specific impulse AND
high thrust at the same time.

So what's the alternative?  Laser thermal.  Because
the power source is some powerful mothership in
orbit, laser thermal rockets can have the same high
power levels of chemical rockets--but with better
specific impulse since they can use hydrogen
exhaust.  The design of such a vehicle is...interesting.

surveillance is one thing in rural/desert areas, quite another in
highly built-up metropolitan regions, with ten zillion nooks and
crannies to hide things in.

Besides, what you detect is human activity - it shows up in
wilderness. Roads, clearings, disturbed ground... Some of it is just
quarries etc, and not immediate danger. Some is weapons systems.

&gt; One idea that I've been thinking about for a habitable planet lander is
&gt; a seaplane. Something vaguely along the lines of SpaceShipOne, but
&gt; beefed up a bit to be capable of surface-to-escape flight. Making it
&gt; capable of landing on a lake means that it won't need a prepared landing
&gt; site.

It would probably have to have some thermal protection system a bit
more rugged than space shuttle tiles then. Slamming into water at
200kph would skin a shuttle - unless you weren't going straight back
for another re-entry. Liquid H2 sloshing about would also be a
problem, unless the fuel is gelled.

To get up and out of a 11kps gravity well plus cargo, you're looking
at something like a mass ratio of 3 or 4 at the least, probably a
trimodal NERVA that afterburns with LOX for the initial ascent and
then switches over to H2 propellant at higher altitude and velocity.
Maybe even kerosene/LOX engines for the first stage then NERVA for
high altitude. A fully fuelled lander coming down in a rough field
would require landing gear weighing several tonnes I imagine. Probably
also require some air-breathing propulsion for the final approach,
especially if it's a tail lander.

Tripropellants like H2-Li-Fl can give theoretical Isp of about 700s
and oodles of thrust but those things are nasty, even if they could be
made to work practically.

http://www.askmar.com/ConferenceNotes/2006-9%20IAC%20Paper.pdf
The inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC) fusion reactor might fit
the bill, Dr. Bussard seems to think he can crank 1500 Isp out of it
with enough thrust to send a spaceplane to orbit, in the range of
1-10:1 thrust:mass ratio.

I like Isaac Kuo's laser thermal solution, since it would leverage off
the mothership's laser cannons (presumably this is a military ship).
Coupled with a low-orbit fresnel lens you could probably supply the
energy from high orbit or deep space. You'd probably need a fluence of
about 10MW/m2 at least, but that seems reasonable.
