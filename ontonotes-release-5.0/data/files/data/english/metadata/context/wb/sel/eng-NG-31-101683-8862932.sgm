hi all,

just went to Raub to attend a wedding dinner of my fren, and we have the
opportunity to drop by Fraser's hill to have a look...... Before arriving at
Raub, saw many Barn Swallows arrived and settled well at the roadside wyres
near palm plantations, oso seen a CSE perching on the roadside tree. When im
going up to Fraser's and all along the road, we encountered so many grey
wagtails, many are superbly frenly and fly away only when closely
approached, also saw many unIDed birds flying around, a CSE flys while
giving out loud calls, and also a common bird that happens to be my lifer,
haven get a lifer for a while alredi..... it is actually a White-rumped
Shama, but this the first wild bird i saw in the wild..... On the hill at
the paddock, saw some bulbuls, most like Mountain Bulbul, he dont perch long
enuf for me to observe nicely..... My first time on Fraser's and will reli
hope to go there again for serious birding next time.....

On the way back, a Brown Shrike is sighted near Bentong, first Brown Shrike
i saw this season apparently....

regards
Tou
