On the back of the CompUSA receipt is printed their return policy,
which allows 14 days for returns. On the front of the receipt is
their Satisfaction Promise, which allows 21 days. What a conundrum...

Ha, good one. I stopped shopping there a while back because of their
restocking policy which applies to almost everything (not just computer
and printers like other stores).

I once returned a non-functioning computer program to them, and they
were sympathetic.
They took it back...minus a ten bone restocking fee.

&gt; Same here. I bought a video card from them. Turned out to be DOA. In two
&gt; different systems, won't POST. They tried it, won't POST. They were happy
&gt; to charge a 15% 'restocking' fee when they processed my refund. I asked
&gt; them if they often restock dead equipment and got no response. I've not
&gt; been back since. I'm sure they've sold that card another dozen times at
&gt; least.

"/> Why did you leave without the full refund that you were clearly entitled
to?

I bought a version of linux that would only install as the ONLY OS on
the computer -- a fact which was not noted on the box and which was
unacceptable because I wanted to put it on one of my empty partitions.
The software was free with rebate but I took it back anyway because I
was so pissed I wasn't willing to give up the sales tax on it. They
gave me a full refund, in spite of their no-refunds-on-software policy.

Wow, you were lucky. CompUSA's policy is to fully refund defective
merchandise, but they are supposed to charge the restocking fee if you
return a product due to features/functionality.

"/> CompUSA is so dishonest that some people won't even buy
free-after-rebate products from them, and the store in NW Phoenix
sometimes tries to charge the 15% restocking fee even on unopened
items. In my case they did this with a product I had bought just 30
minutes earlier. They claiming I had opened the package and implied
that I had resealed it, which would have been impossible because the
hard plastic required a special sealing machine. In reality it had
been either sealed badly or resealed by the store, but they said they
didn't have any sealing machines, which I found really hard to believe
because I've seen shrink wrapped packages that had obviously been
returned.

"/> But DOA stands for &quot;dead on arrival&quot; which would indicate a problem of
some kind (the previous purchaser had a problem with that package, be
it dead, compatibility, etc..).

I don't agree with their return policies but that's not the point I'm
trying to make. Whether you buy or not, you are obligated to ask/read
what their return policy is before the purchase and should you buy,
you are accepting it as such. In this case, knowing it was a DOA
item, would probably steer me away from it unless I just had to risk
my time/money/hassle to get it.

So the bottom line is you buy an item marked DOA, you have to be
willing to accept some risk or you wouldn't buy it... especially from
CompUSA. And whatever the case, maybe more people know better than to
buy from CompUSA now!! I know I did years ago reading other horror
stories about them.

in Provo on business. I returned the card at a CompUSA near Philadelphia
a couple of weeks later, explained that it didn't work and I was issued
a 100% refund without any hassle at all.

"/> Work up to it. Somebody had a routine about do-it-yourself
assertiveness training:

1. Walk up to a stranger standing outside a building. Hand him your
dog's leash and tell him you'll only be a few minutes. Enter the
building.

2. Stand outside an ice cream shop and ask people leaving with cones if
you can have a lick -- you want to know whether the flavor is any good
before you order one.

That's all I can remember. Try to return something that you really
don't care about one way or the other. Do lots of haggling at yard
sales for stuff you don't care about. Ditto at a used car dealer's --
you don't have to actually buy the car.
