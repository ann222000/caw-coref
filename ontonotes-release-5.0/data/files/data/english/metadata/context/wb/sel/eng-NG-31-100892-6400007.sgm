I'm looking for reading advice. I want to understand more about
phenomenology as expressed by Husserl. I don't want to read his entire
works, so does anybody have advice on where to start? My understanding
is that Husserl re-examines phenomenology over and over across a few
published works, but I'm wondering if there is a concise place I could
look for an introduction?

Phenomenology

One of the most important philosophical movements of the twentieth
century. It was founded by Edmund Husserl at the beginning of this
century and has had many followers, for example, Moritz Geiger,
Alexander Pfaender, Max Scheler, Oscar Becker, up to the present.
Quite naturally, it has undergone many changes, refinements, shifts of
emphasis, etc. Originally, it was primarily a theory of knowledge.
Later on, in the years after 1913, phenomenology developed into a form
of idealism.

Phenomenology distinguishes sharply between perceptual properties on
the one hand, and abstract properties on the other. Consider two white
billiard balls, called A and B. The white colour of A, which one can
see with one's eyes, is said to be located in space where A is. The
white colour of B, similarly, is taken to be located where B is.
Furthermore, it is maintained that the colour of A is not identical
with the colour of B, since they are located at two different places.
The same shade of colour, according to this analysis, divides into as
many 'colour instances' of that shade as there are individual things
with this colour shade.

However, all of these instances are instances of the same colour
shade. There exists, therefore, according to phenomenology, also the
abstract colour shade of which the instances are instances. Let us
call this abstract colour the 'universal whiteness'. Phenomenology
asserts that there is not only a direct perception of instances of
whiteness, but also a sort of direct perception of the universal
whiteness. This perception is called 'eidetic intuition'. By means of
eidetic intuition we have knowledge of the essential features of the
world. Phenomenologists call such universals essences.

An essence can be presented to the mind in its totality in one mental
act of intuition. Perceptual objects, however, can never be so
presented. According to phenomenologists, we can only perceive aspects
of them. This is one of the fundamental differences between essences
and certain individual things. What does it mean to perceive merely
aspects of, say, one of our billiard-balls? There seem to be two
notions of an aspect at work. Firstly, we must distinguish between the
colour instance of billiard-ball A, which is a part of A, and the
differently coloured sensations which we experience when we look at A.
Assume, for example, that A is illuminated from one side, so that half
of it lies in the shadow. Even though that billiard-ball is uniformly
coloured, our colour sensation of it is not uniformly white: one part
of it is much darker than the other. And if we were to put on coloured
glasses, our colour sensation would not be white at all. Now, what
phenomenologists sometimes seem to have in mind when they speak of
perception through aspects is that the property instances of a
perceptual object, its colour, its shape, appear to us only through
the perspective variations of our colour sensation and the variations
of our shape sensations.

Secondly, and much more obviously, spatial perceptual objects can only
be perceived from a point of view. For example, when we look at
billiard-ball A, only one side is turned towards us and we cannot see
its back. In this sense, therefore, we can only perceive, from a given
point of view, a spatial 'aspect' of it. It is clear that this notion
of an aspect is quite different from the one mentioned in the last
paragraph.

According to phenomenology, therefore, our knowledge of things divides
into direct and indirect knowledge, that is, into direct knowledge and
knowledge through aspects. Essences (universal properties) are known
directly, but perceptual objects are only known through their aspects.
However, in addition to perceptual things, there are also mental
things and selves. How are they known? Consciousness, according to
phenomenology, is known, like essences, directly. The mental act of
seeing a billiard-ball, a desire to be once again in Venice, a
remembrance of strolling down the beach in Manly, all of these so-
called mental acts are presented to us without aspects. There is thus
a fundamental difference between the objects of the outside perceptual
world and the objects of the world of consciousness: the former are
never given to us wholly and completely in single mental acts of
perception, the latter are fully given to us when we attend to them.
But the self, the mental individual from which all mental acts issue,
is only presented to us indirectly, like a perceptual object. The
realm of individual things thus divides into an 'immanent' part,
consciousness, and two 'transcendent' parts, perceptual objects and
the self. This makes consciousness special, because what we truly and
directly know is only consciousness. But some phenomenologists go even
further and claim that consciousness has a kind of being quite
different from all other things. This claim plays an essential role in
existentialism.

So far we have appraised phenomenology as a theory of knowledge. But
it is often viewed not as a new philosophical view about old
epistemological problems, but as a new method of doing philosophy, and
one speaks then of the phenomenological method. Sometimes, one even
talks of the science of phenomenology, which is claimed to have its
own method and subject-matter.

So-called eidetic reflection, reflection on essences and their
connections, is of course the heart of phenomenology. This reflection
requires eidetic reduction. By means of eidetic reduction, we shift
our attention from a particular instance of a property to the abstract
property (essence) itself. After the shift has taken place, one will
'see' the essence directly and in its totality. Furthermore, after
eidetic reduction, one also intuits connections among essences. One
may intuit, for example, that the essences of ego and of spatial being
reveal that the former can perceive the latter only in spatial
perspective. Phenomenology, from this point of view, inquires into the
structures formed by essences.

The knowledge gained by a study of the relationships among essences,
according to most phenomenologists, is non-empirical. For example, the
insight just mentioned that an ego can perceive a spatial being only
in perspective is gleaned from a connection between the essence of an
ego and the essence of something spatial; it is not inferred by
induction from individual cases. Such an inference, for example, would
be involved if one concluded from repeated observations of particular
whales that all whales are mammals. But phenomenological truths are
thought to be not only non-empirical in this sense, but also
necessary. The inductive law about whales may be proven false, for
example, by the discovery of a whale that is not a mammal but a fish.
No such possibility exists, however, for the phenomenological truth
about the connection between the essence of being an ego and the
essence of observing spatial things. Since phenomenological truths are
thought to be both non-empirical and necessary, they are said to be
true a priori.

But this is not all there is to the phenomenological method. There is
also phenomenological reduction. It seems that there are two sides to
phenomenological reduction. Firstly, there is a general prescription
to look at things without prejudice, to go to the things themselves,
to leave theoretical speculation behind, etc. Secondly, however, there
is also a more specific side to phenomenological reduction. It
consists, as a first step, in the 'bracketing of the objective world'.
Phenomenologists rely at this point on a thesis which was defended by
the Polish philosopher Twardowski, who, like Husserl, was a student of
Brentano's. Twardowski distinguished between an individual act of
presentation, the content of this act, and the object of the act.
Assume that one is presented with the billiard-ball A. Then there
occurs a particular mental act of presentation. This act has a unique
content which is a property of the mental act, and it has, as its
object, the billiard-ball A. Twardowski's thesis is that every act has
an object, even those acts which intend things which do not exist. If
one hallucinates a big polka-dotted bat, one's act of seeing has an
object, even though this object does not exist. In general, Twardowski
insisted (for example, against Bolzano) that we must distinguish
between the question whether a mental act has an object and the
question whether its object exists. Some mental acts have objects
which do not exist. Phenomenological reduction is then a method of

&gt; Since it would be from someone who is obviously much better read than I, I
&gt; would be interested to know what you think about what Sartre did with his
&gt; &quot;ontological phenomenology&quot; in &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;.

In Sartre's opinion, consciousness does not make sense by itself: it
arises by the awareness of objects. So consciousness of is the proper
way to qualify consciousness. One is always aware of an object. The
latter being something or someone, it accounts to the same. This non-
positional quality of consciousness is what makes it an ontology. And
the fact that third parties are the tangible foundation for the
intangible self is what truly makes it a phenomenological ontology.

Self-awareness is the explicit understanding that one exists.
Furthermore, it includes the concept that one exists as an individual,
separate from other people, with private thoughts. It may also include
the understanding that other people are similarly self-aware. Self-
awareness remains a critical mystery in philosophy, psychology,
biology, and artificial intelligence.

Self-consciousness is credited with the development of identity (see
the self). In an epistemological sense, self-consciousness is a
personal understanding of the very core of one's own identity. It is
during periods of self-consciousness that people come the closest to
knowing themselves objectively. Jean Paul Sartre describes self-
consciousness as being "non-positional", in that it is not from any
location in particular.

Self-consciousness plays a large role in behaviour as it is common to
act differently when people "lose one's self in a crowd". It is the
basis for human traits, such as accountability and conscientiousness.
Self-consciousness affects people in varying degrees, as some people
self-monitor (or scrutinize) themselves more than others. Different
cultures vary in the importance they place on self-consciousness...

...Consciousness and self-awareness are poorly understood. Self-
awareness is a unique type of consciousness in that it is not always
present, and is not sought after. Meditation or repetitive tasks, as
well as some schools of thought in art theory and existentialism seek
to reduce self-consciousness, and even self-awareness, at least
temporarily.

The ability to self-analyze (or scrutinize) is widely believed among
psychologists not to develop until mid-childhood, and arguably is
present in only a few species of animals[citation needed]. Tests that
are usually considered as representative of self-consciousness include
applying a bright dot to a subjects forehead, and then placing them in
front of a mirror - if they reach for their own forehead, it appears
they may realize their own existence in a self-aware sense. Great
apes, dolphins and elephants can pass this test. However, others
criticize this test as testing only the understanding of the
duplicability of image, and not especially meaningful as a way of
gauging self-consciousness.

In the introduction to Being and Nothingness, Sartre details his
rejection of Kant's concept of noumenon. Kant was an idealist,
believing that we have no direct way of perceiving the external world
and that all we have access to is our ideas of the world, including
what our senses tell us. Kant distinguished between phenomena, which
are our perceptions of things or how things appear to us, and noumena,
which are the things in themselves, which we have no knowledge of.
Against Kant, Sartre argues that the appearance of a phenomenon is
pure and absolute. The noumenon is not inaccessible-it simply isn't
there. Appearance is the only reality. From this starting point,
Sartre contends that the world can be seen as an infinite series of
finite appearances. Such a perspective eliminates a number of
dualisms, notably the duality that contrasts the inside and outside of
an object. What we see is what we get (or, what appears is what we
know).

Modularity of mind is the notion that a mind, at least in part, may be
composed of innate structures which have established evolutionarily-
developed functional purposes (ie. "modules"). Proponents believe this
view is implied by Noam Chomsky's concept of a universal, generative
grammar. Such features of language imply there's an underlying
"language acquisition device" structure in the brain. This device is
postulated to be autonomous and specialized for learning language
rapidly; a module.

The visual system is the part of the nervous system which allows
organisms to see. It interprets the information from visible light to
build a representation of the world surrounding the body. The visual
system has the complex task of (re)constructing a three dimensional
world from a two dimensional projection of that world.

Neuroscience reinforces the theory of nomunem and weakens the idea
that ALL self-awareness or consciouness is sufficiently explained by
object presence, evin if necessarily so... -Reanimater

Is Satre a realist then? Or is he a theoretical "hyper-empiricist?" If
the later then, both theoretical, "hyper-methodology" and "hyper-
instrumentalism" may have been properly mapped out by him, this
acknowledging the consideration of the human condition of theoretical
representationalism and it persuasive supporting evidence. -Reanimater

--------------------------------

It is commonly said of modern philosophy that it introduced a
representative theory of perception, a theory that places
representative mental items between perceivers and ordinary physical
objects. Such a theory, it has been thought, would be a form of
indirect realism:  we perceive objects only by means of apprehending
mental entities that represent them.  The moral of the story is that
what began with Descartes' revolution of basing objective truth on
subjective certainty ends with Hume's paroxysms of ambivalence and
skepticism in the conclusion of the first book of the Treatise of
Human Nature.

Representationalism is the philosophical position that the world we
see in conscious experience is not the real world itself, but merely a
miniature virtual-reality replica of that world in an internal
representation.

!!! http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html !!!

Representationalism (or indirect realism) with respect to perception
is the view that "we are never aware of physical objects, [but rather]
we are only indirectly aware of them, in virtue of a direct awareness
of an intermediary [mental] object. (Dancy, 145) Because there are
both direct and indirect objects of awareness in representationalism,
a correspondence relation arises between the mental entities directly
perceived and external objects which those mental entities represent.
And thus perceptual error occurs when the two objects of awareness do
not correspond sufficiently well. In opposition to
representationalism, both (direct) realism and idealism agree that
perception is direct and unmediated, despite their disagreements about
what the object of perception is. (Dancy, 145) In any form of direct
perception, no correspondence relationship is possible, since there is
only one object of perception. Thus only representationalism will give
rise to the view that perceptual errors exist and must be part of a
theory of perception. Nevertheless, both idealism and realism must
still account for the facts that are referred to as "perceptual
errors" by the representationalist.
