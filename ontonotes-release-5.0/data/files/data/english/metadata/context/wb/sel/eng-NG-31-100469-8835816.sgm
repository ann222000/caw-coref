I think the main problem is that modern science is on the whole
reductionistic. Modern scientists tend to focus on smaller and more
precise answers to very specific questions, questions which have one
answer and one only, while astrology is about the broadest possible
canvas on which to paint a picture. I don't feel there's really any
way to reconcile the two, but I see no need to, either; the popularity
of any one style of human thought wanes and flows as with the tides,
and astrology will have its day too.

I agree with you, Dj, and I would also add some things.

One: It's been said that a natal chart is a picture of the inclination of a
human without the will. The human will can decide NOT to use that Mars
Uranus square (or whatever) in a negative way, or not to take advantage of
other chart factors, etc. When trying to prove astrology as it relates to
human experience, character, motivation, etc, the playing field is just too
broad and varied.

Two: When considering mundane astrology, things like earthquakes, hurricanes
and natural disasters might be the best testing ground, since there is no
real human factor involved. The problem is, we don't know all the factors in
play. For instance, why does California tend to have considerable
earthquakes when the outer planets are in 7-10 degrees of the cardinal
signs? Does California have it's own chart? How do we know what it is? We
can look at the state ratification chart, but the land that makes up
California (and the underlying fault zones, certainly) was there long before
it became a political entity. My point is that we have no way to know
(except by observation of phenomenon) what an area's sensitive points are.
I've always felt we were missing a big piece of the puzzle with astrology.

Another angle (and that's the perfect word for more than one reason)
is of the mathematics. Music has its own mathematical structure, which
follows the same path as astrology, yet nobody attempts to predict hit
songs by scientific reasoning or would deride the scientist who
inevitably would fail. Architecture is similar; there is a
mathematical structure, but its esthetics are the major concern. A
bridge or a building can be perfectly functional, and ugly as sin.
Astrology is architecture, not of bridges but of daily life, and can
be used in beautiful as well as ridiculous ways.

Oh yes!!!
The most frustrating part about trying to &quot;prove astrology&quot; is exactly
this. If TIME OF BIRTH was considered an exact science, much about
astrology could ALSO be an exact science. Instead we take on
challenges based on what a &quot;trained psychologist&quot; says about
sagittarius, or equally nebulous factoids open to whatever
interpretation blows in the window......

So true! And what is interesting to me is that the math of music must be
understood to actually play (unless you just memorize and play by ear) it is
purely a language of, and always speaks to, the emotions. I think, in the
same way, astrology means nothing until the human element is added to it.

I need to add - what one should look for are &quot;hits&quot; (aspects of
any sort) involving either natal MC or Asc, or True Solar Arc
Progressed MC or its derived Asc from secondary progressed
planets at the times of major life events (deaths of loved ones,
major relocations, births of one's own children, surgeries, and
other types of life changing events).

And of course, p MC or Asc hitting natal bodies (and I mean only
the modern 10 bodies), or natal angles.

Hits to major natal midpoints (such as Mars/Saturn, the &quot;Death
Axis&quot;) can be interesting too, but I found in every case it's the
angles or their mid-points or mid-degrees that get hit.

If you find that you see no hit to an angle at the time of a
major life event, check the mid-points of both your natal MC and
Asc, and your progressed MC and Asc, also check the mid-degrees.

Sometimes, in lieu of a hit from a secondary progression, there
will be a hit from a Solar Arc body, but I only use the
conjunctions, squares, and oppositions when it comes to Solar
Arcs.

But it's fascinating - it's as if the angles of the chart work
like the hands on a clock, timing every major life event.

&gt;&gt; I need to add - what one should look for are &quot;hits&quot; (aspects of
&gt;&gt; any sort) involving either natal MC or Asc, or True Solar Arc
&gt;&gt; Progressed MC or its derived Asc from secondary progressed
&gt;&gt; planets at the times of major life events (deaths of loved ones,
&gt;&gt; major relocations, births of one's own children, surgeries, and
&gt;&gt; other types of life changing events).

&gt;&gt; And of course, p MC or Asc hitting natal bodies (and I mean only
&gt;&gt; the modern 10 bodies), or natal angles.

&gt;&gt; Hits to major natal midpoints (such as Mars/Saturn, the &quot;Death
&gt;&gt; Axis&quot;) can be interesting too, but I found in every case it's the
&gt;&gt; angles or their mid-points or mid-degrees that get hit.

&gt;&gt; If you find that you see no hit to an angle at the time of a
&gt;&gt; major life event, check the mid-points of both your natal MC and
&gt;&gt; Asc, and your progressed MC and Asc, also check the mid-degrees.

&gt;&gt; Sometimes, in lieu of a hit from a secondary progression, there
&gt;&gt; will be a hit from a Solar Arc body, but I only use the
&gt;&gt; conjunctions, squares, and oppositions when it comes to Solar
&gt;&gt; Arcs.

&gt;&gt; But it's fascinating - it's as if the angles of the chart work
&gt;&gt; like the hands on a clock, timing every major life event.

&gt;Thanks a lot. :)

No hurry at all.  Just something to try when and if you want to.

And Alain, the orbs of these hits should be within no more than +
or - 5 minutes of arc, although I found mine could vary a bit.
Usually, you will get the closest orb hits (within 1 to 4 minutes
of arc) when an Angle (natal or progressed) gets a &quot;hit&quot; from
natal or progressed Uranus.  (Or it's the other way around,
really, it's the Angle that makes the hit.)

I very much hope you'll enjoy working with this technique when
you feel like trying it, and that the results you get will make
the work worth it.

Quite honestly, it was the one thing that proved to me that
astrology works and is quantifiable, quite beyond any
interpretative attributions with which we might imbue the art, it
really is also a science.

&gt; : &gt; Another angle (and that's the perfect word for more than one reason)

&gt; Quote from http://www.exactphilosophy.net/odyssey.zip
&gt; =&gt; discoveries.pdf (page 19):

&gt; Hermes

&gt; Hermes leaves the cave in which he was born twice on the day
&gt; of his birth. The first time, he leaves during daytime,
&gt; quickly finds a tortoise and fabricates a lyre out of its
&gt; shell. The second time, he leaves at dusk, travels far and
&gt; steals some cattle from the sun god Apollon by walking
&gt; backwards as to trick out any prosecutors. Back at the
&gt; cave, he kills two of the cattle and prepares 12 equally
&gt; sized offerings to the gods and then eats one of them.
&gt; After some time, Apollon manages to trace Hermes down
&gt; and takes him up to mount Olympus in order for Zeus
&gt; to judge the matter. Although Apollon is angry at first,
&gt; after hearing Hermes play the lyre, he happily trades
&gt; the cattle for the lyre and quickly learns to make more
&gt; beautiful music than Hermes ever did.

&gt; This describes the relation between sun and Mercury.
&gt; Mercury, as the closest planet to the sun, never travels
&gt; farther away from the sun than into the next or previous
&gt; star sign. In other words, Hermes went first forward into
&gt; the next sign to get the lyre, then back to kill two of the
&gt; cattle, in order to end the age of Taurus and to redivide
&gt; the zodiac into twelve equally sized parts. Apollon, who
&gt; is also related to Leo, is not as flexible as Hermes and
&gt; hence needed a bit longer to realize that the old age had
&gt; ended and the new one had beautiful things to offer, too.

&gt; Erwin Schrödinger once suggested that the conscious
&gt; mind is where new things are learned. Learning to play
&gt; a new instrument, like a lyre, requires at first a lot of
&gt; conscious work until it becomes automatic (i.e. uncon-
&gt; scious) again and one can again fully enjoy making music
&gt; and forgets about the previous efforts.
">

That's exactly how it works. You learn the basics, then the use of them
becomes unconscious as you express yourself in the music.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In the myth, Zeus, who is associated with Saggitar-
&gt; ius, complements the natural process of making some
&gt; things conscious and letting others sink back into uncon-
&gt; sciousness. After all, people had been music a
&gt; long time before there were instruments, using their own
&gt; voices, not knowing that the human voice itself is made
&gt; by oscillating strings too, namely by the vocal cords.
&gt; In other words, even though the greeks had discovered
&gt; how to describe music analytically in terms of individual
&gt; frequencies, after a while things turned out to be not so
&gt; new, but rather variations of something that had existed
&gt; all along, as it almost always is.

Nothin' new under the Sun, eh? ;-)
