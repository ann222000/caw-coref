Dear Flashcoders,

I have stumbled across an interesting issue when I was looking for
different ways of creating an input box. The way I chose, is because
it's the simplest one is to crete it on the authoring time. The path
that I followed was simple, I Created three textboxes, converted them
into input text, set their text spacing to 5, and their alpha to 78.
and select some font and embed certain latin characters. Â Then I put
some text in the box too. and when I test this piece, unfortunately
it's giving me total random results.

here's the swf file I uploaded. First of all, it doesn't load with
alpha in the beginning. If I go ahead and do a backspace on any of
the text box and delete the text and start typing again, if it's the
first attempt, it works without alpha and with correct letter
spacing. BUT, when I press tab to move into the next textBox, and
delete the contents and try to type, it gives me the correct alpha
and 0 text letter spacing. If you try to rerun this swf, you will see
that it gives you those in random order.

I don't really know what's going. I don't like to jump so quickly
that to tell this is a bug but I am really curious to see what you
got. If I create everything in the code, it works fine by the way.

Please let me know your results.
best,
ilteris
