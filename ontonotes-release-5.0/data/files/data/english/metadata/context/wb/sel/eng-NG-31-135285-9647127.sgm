Tonight when I was talking to Ryan he said something interesting:
&quot;Twitter has killed blogging&quot;.

I've never heard anybody say this, but my initial cursory thought was
&quot;yeah, that's right&quot;. But then I was thinking about it some more and
I've formed a new conclusion &quot;Twitter encouraged bloggers who wanted
to stop blogging, to stop blogging&quot;. This could probably be
interpreted a million, or at least maybe 5 or 10, different ways.

My finger hasn't been on the pulse of the blogging world for quite a
while, so maybe this is old news?

I just thought it was an interesting statement, maybe some people
wanted to share their thoughts on it...

I recently read a blog post from Molly Holzschlag about the same topic:
http://www.molly.com/2008/01/05/twitter-sucked-the-blogging-out-of-me/

But personally, I stopped blogging myself a couple years ago so I
can't say that Twitter sucked the blog out of me. It was more like
realizing I was putting more into it than I got out of it. For me to
craft a good blog post would take about a half-hour at least (and
often more). A Twitter post takes 10 seconds and is often more
personal than one of my blog posts would have been.

I look at Twitter as a medium coexisting with blogging rather than
something that supersedes it. Blog posts work best for linking,
sharing information and opinions, while tweets are more well suited
for sharing moments and feelings. The limits of the medium define the
message.

Where I guess it can rob from blogging time is if you're posting a
multitude of tweets instead of doing a blog post. Tweets seem to be
more valuable at the moment they're posted (I'm not going back to
read my old tweets that often). They have a shorter shelf life than a
blog post that can be rediscovered through search engines again and
again. So if you would like to devote your time to something slightly
longer-lasting, do a blog post. It's funny because a few years ago,
the story was that blogging was robbing from other, more productive
pursuits. Now it's Twitter killing blogs.

Although my view is narrow, as I read design/dev blogs almost exclusively,
I agree with your assessment that Twitter kills blogging only for casual,
unfocused or exhausted bloggers.

As an example, Molly Holzschlag recently claimed Twitter &quot;sucked the blog
out of me&quot; -- but her blog posts had been short and infrequent (and
increasingly personal) for a long time.

Meanwhile, the more dedicated and topically-focused bloggers seem to be
using Twitter as fuel and inspiration. An excellent example is yesterday's
ALA article on IE versioning, which created a flurry of outraged tweets
followed by a flurry of thoughtful blog posts.

Finally, Twitter really proves its value by its effect on a third category
of bloggers -- *potential* bloggers. By giving these would-be writers some
instant gratification (and by demonstrating that they rarely have more than
140 characters' worth of wisdom on any given topic), Twitter has averted the
creation of many unnecessary and short-lived blogs.

I sort of lean the other direction on this. First I agree that those
who struggled with producing regular blog entries and things like
driving traffic may have cut the blog entry frequency if not at all.

On the other end of this spectrum are those folks who use Twitter (or
whatever system) as a supplement to blogging. Take for example R.
Scoble or even closer to home, Alex Jones (Yes, our very own
SilverSpider). Both send out tweets once they generate a new blog
post. The in effect gets the blog site out to many who would not
normally have known about the blog entry.

Now the big question is do these people who tweet about their blog
actually blog more frequent.

Ah, you beat my lurking butt to the punch with Tumblr. I adore it.

Long time reader, first time poster... I think Marla is totally right.
I started noticing last year that my blog posts were frequently of the
&quot;Look how interesting this is&quot; variety and felt that blogging wasn't
the best medium for that kind of message. Right about then I found
http://anarchaia.org/ and thought, &quot;Yes, exactly: That's my blogging
form factor.&quot; And along comes Tumblr -- and subsequently my tumblelog
at http://drhayes.tumblr.com .

Twitter really only became valuable for me once I linked up with
someone else who tweets (Hey, Alex!). I'm totally willing to write
blog posts to an audience of none, but didn't bother tweeting until I
knew I was connecting with someone specific.

All told, from my perspective, it seems like blog posts are lengthier
ruminations that might have utility for other people, tumbleposts (?)
are quick snapshots of attention data, and tweets are flashes of
mindspace.

I had read Molly's post as well as a couple of others in response to
it. My take on the matter isn't that Twitter 'killed' blogging. A lot
of blogs were in decline for a while if we use post count as an
indication, but as noted already, the quality and content in many
cases improved for blogs that had been around for a while.

Personally, I do my best to introduce interesting content via my site/
blog as often as I can, but I've never been all that comfortable
posting personal stories about what's happening in my life. My site
tends to be a collection of topics that interest me, and resources
that I want to keep track of, and spread the word about.

Twitter is an interesting combination to me. I've never viewed it as a
blogging alternative, nor as a threat to blogging - they have
different purposes. Twitter is about immediate communication with a
circle of people who are interested in your life. The best thing about
it, for me, is the fact that I hear about the little things impacting
the lives of my friends and colleagues - everything from the fact that
they were up all night with a sick dog or new baby to interesting
links about Web development to short-notice event invites and updates
to diatribes lamenting the stupidity in the world around them. We can
keep up with each other even when we haven't had a chance to meet in a
while.

I fully expect in March that a lot of us will congregate at SXSW
parties or lunch spots because of Twitter - we'll be able to shoot out
a note with something as simple as 'Heading to the beer booth' and a
ton of other people will see it, and decide if they want to join - the
cool thing is, we don't have to have a list of 50 e-mail addresses and
long threaded replies to spread the word. We'll definitely have a
trackable Refresh Austin keyword, or user for the event to make it
easier for us to gather.

Twitter's a different medium and has a different purpose than
blogging, some folks were just making due until it arrived on the
scene and now have the right tool for the job.

Personally, I view blogging and tweeting as two separate things.

Being a casual blogger who doesn't care who reads his blog since the
material is intended for friends primarily, I have a lot of posts sitting
around in draft mode of ideas and introspection, stuff that would never
condense down into a tweet or make sense tweeting about.

I've never been inclined to read through anyone's archive of tweets yet and
don't really expect to. I use Twitter more like those little shout out
boxes. Then again, I didn't really start to tweet until I started using it
to update my Facebook status.

The people I know that blog and tweet don't appear to be blogging any
differently than before they started twittering. Granted my sampling pool is
very small. If one was blogging in a manner similar to how they tweet I
could see the shift from one medium to the other. For me, I still blog
really short entries when sharing links and information, especially, when I
want to embed pictures and the like which aren't possible via Twitter.

Twitter might be a better medium for some to convey their thoughts over
blogging and to them blogging maybe dead.
