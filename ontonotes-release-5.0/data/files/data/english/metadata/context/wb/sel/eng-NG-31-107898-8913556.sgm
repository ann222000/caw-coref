Saving England Wasn't Worth It
by Scott Horton

Editor's note: Antiwar.com Assistant Editor Scott Horton wrote the
following essay for the Oxford Forum, whose editors asked him to
contribute a piece on the Anglo-American role in international
conflict. Unfortunately, the Forum's editors rewrote the essay without
Horton's permission, distorting its thesis beyond all recognition. It
appears here in its full, original version.

Most Americans can't believe that their government maintains an
overseas empire of as many as 1,000 military bases. U.S. interventions
are always portrayed to us as defensive in nature, and for one simple
reason: Americans don't want empire. Our country was founded in
revolution from the clutches of empire, and our culture celebrates
those who oppose it, from George Washington to Luke Skywalker.

We don't want empire, but we have one. Since the end of the second
World War, the people of the United States and of the world have had
to deal with the terrible consequences of our country's involvement.
It turns out it's nearly impossible to turn a limited constitutional
republic into a globe-spanning, war-making leviathan and then go back
again.

The Battle of Britain was won. The Germans had no ability to mount a
successful land invasion of England - or even an unsuccessful one. If
they had, certainly the English would have stashed the queen away
somewhere and fought an insurgency as ruthlessly as the French,
Russians, and Serbs, among others. The British empire may have been
lost without U.S. help, but in the end, it was anyway.

However, the USSR was preserved by American intervention. The U.S.-UK
invasion of Europe simply popped the lid off the jar wherein the two
most despicable regimes in the world were stuck fighting each other.
Had America not helped, the Soviets would likely have met defeat, with
the vastly overextended Nazi empire on course for the same fate soon
after. Instead, Stalin enslaved half of Europe, helped Communists
seize power in China, killed millions more, and ultimately provided
the pretext for America's dominion over the Old World's empires for
the next half-century.

(The Holocaust was never a reason for American intervention. Indeed,
Roosevelt delayed doing anything about the death camps for as long as
he could.)

The consequences of American intervention for the Eastern Europeans
were summed up by former President Herbert Hoover in terms that also
foreshadowed the coming propaganda model for the new enemy:

&quot;In June 1941, when Britain was safe from German invasion due to
Hitler's diversion to attack Stalin, I urged that the gargantuan jest
of all history would be our giving aid to the Soviet government. I
urged that we should allow those two dictators to exhaust each other.
I stated that the result of our assistance would be to spread
Communism over the whole world. ... The consequences have proved that I
was right.&quot;

For a short time after World War II, as after every previous war, the
U.S. began to demilitarize, but the inheritance of so many foreign
empires demanded a permanent state of military readiness and
deployment - and an excuse. The only way to gain consent to secure
this world empire would be to &quot;scare the hell out of the American
people&quot; - that is, lie - as Republican Sen. Arthur Vandenberg advised
President Harry Truman. Suddenly, the Soviet Union, despite having
just lost 20 million people fighting the Germans and with blind
devotion to a system that had been proved not to work a generation
before, was going to take over &quot;the whole world&quot; if we didn't stop it.
Millions of Americans trusted this new crusade to be &quot;containment,&quot;
not world empire.

The &quot;Cold War,&quot; however, was merely a ruse, as former CIA adviser,
ardent Cold Warrior, and self-described &quot;spear carrier for empire&quot;
Chalmers Johnson now realizes and admits. Today's neoconservative
doctrine of &quot;benevolent global hegemony&quot; is merely the newest stage in
an empire made permanent long ago. The role the national government
took in the society and economy could not be more than partially
scaled back after World War II; there was just too much money in it.
Companies who prospered during the war wanted their newfound access to
the U.S. Treasury preserved. America has since employed Pearl Harbor-
style attacks against populations in dozens of countries as a matter
of course, often, it seems, just so it can keep buying more bombs.

And all along the American people have internalized these policies,
believing even that they had come up with them. As Randolph Bourne
wrote back in 1918:

&quot;War is the health of the state. ... [In wartime,] the State thus
becomes an instrument by which the power of the whole herd is wielded
for the benefit of a class. The rulers soon learn to capitalize the
reverence which the State produces in the majority, and turn it into a
general resistance toward a lessening of their privileges.&quot;

The American people are a captive market of 300 million for many of
the world's wealthiest corporations - particularly when it comes to
raiding the Pentagon vault, what military strategist William S. Lind
calls &quot;the largest honey pot in the world.&quot; Lobbyists representing the
munitions industries have multi-million dollar budgets to spend on
niceties for congressmen, military officials, and anyone else crucial
for access to hundreds of billions of dollars. For those in the right
position, it's the best investment in the world.

Former USAID attorney and international law professor Richard
Cummings, in his explosive article for Playboy magazine in March,
&quot;Lockheed Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,&quot; documented the decisive role
played by the military industries in setting the policy of the United
States. Indeed, as Cummings shows, many of the biggest players in the
run-up to the invasion of Iraq were closely connected to Lockheed,
Boeing, and Northrop Grumman. Neoconservative ringleader Richard
Perle's firm Trireme Partners famously cashed in on the Terror War for
over $20 million. In 2002, Lockheed executives actually set up an
&quot;advisory board&quot; to come up with excuses for invading Iraq. (They
mostly settled on crimes committed by Saddam back when he was working
for the U.S., since there were no weapons of mass destruction.)

But American Cold War policy created the best enemy the War Party
could have ever hoped for in the modern Sunni jihadist movement.

As Professor John Mueller points out in his book Overblown, after the
defeat in Vietnam, &quot;containment&quot; lost favor, and the U.S. even turned
to encouraging the Russians. Near the end of the 1970s the United
States began a massive covert operation to lure the Soviet Union into
invading Afghanistan in order to give them their own &quot;Vietnam War.&quot; So
ceasing to contain the USSR broke their economy, while the training
and weapons given to the mujahedeen by the U.S. provided the
experience needed for some to coalesce into what is now known as al-
Qaeda - whose enemy is no longer Russia.

President Carter's National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski
admitted as much with a shrug to the French magazine Le Nouvel
Observateur in 1998:

&quot;What is most important to the history of the world - the Taliban or
the collapse of the Soviet empire? Some stirred-up Muslims or the
liberation of Central Europe and the end of the Cold War?&quot;

The Cold War did end, and it was the perfect opportunity for President
George H.W. Bush to show the world what it means to abdicate power for
the sake of liberty by abolishing NATO, but he didn't. In fact, when
informed of the USSR's imminent collapse, Brent Scowcroft and James
Baker attempted to intervene and find a way to save the evil empire -
to no avail.

Anyone who believed they would get their &quot;peace dividend&quot; by that
point was a fool. The American empire was here to stay. The first
chance George Bush Sr. had, he invaded Panama, killing thousands. Soon
thereafter, with a determined Prime Minister Thatcher as a backbone,
he sent the U.S. Army to the Middle East to stay for good.

Osama bin Laden issued his &quot;Declaration of War Against the Americans
Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places&quot; in 1996. And even though
the Clinton administration backed the Muslim Kosovo Liberation Army
during the bombing of Serbia in 1999 and paid the Taliban millions of
dollars, bin Laden remained hostile.

In his book Dying to Win, Robert A. Pape shows that suicide terrorism
has only one cause: foreign occupation. So the invasion of Iraq has
certainly compounded a serious problem. In 2005, the Royal Institute

&quot;There is no doubt that the situation over Iraq has imposed particular
difficulties for the UK, and for the wider coalition against
terrorism. It gave a boost to the al-Qaeda network's propaganda,
recruitment, and fundraising, caused a major split in the coalition,
provided an ideal targeting and training area for al-Qaeda-linked
terrorists. ... Riding pillion with a powerful ally has proved costly in
terms of British and U.S. military lives, Iraqi lives, military
expenditure, and the damage caused to the counter-terrorism campaign.&quot;

That's the kind of thing that keeps BAE Systems on the American dole
for the long haul - a perfect setup for all war parties involved.
Osama seems a farsighted hero to radicalized millions, and those who
lurk around the U.S. government till have an enemy vague enough to
last, according to Vice President Cheney, &quot;decades.&quot;

The Terror War has already spread to Africa, and a new military
command, AFRICOM, has been set up there. The recent U.S.-backed
Ethiopian invasion of Somalia- in the name of catching three al-Qaeda
&quot;commanders&quot; - is only the beginning, as bin Laden predicted in an
audio tape in the summer of 2006. Many liberals who oppose the
invasion and occupation of Iraq are pushing hard for an invasion of
Sudan - next on bin Laden's wish list.

In his newest book, Nemesis: The Last Days of the American Republic,

Absolutely.

The rank and file of world Jewry is not the villain, and never was:
but they tolerate the Eisners and Bronfmans and such just like they
tolerated the Hambros and Warburgs and Sassoons, and those snakes
don't care any more about Jews per se than they do about anyone else.

Pax Americana has about another ten or twenty years left. And when
she finally goes, 99% of those who think it will be good riddance now
will regret it for the rest of their lives.
