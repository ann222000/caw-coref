Here is a response to Scott's first four questions. It is incomplete,
especially number four. I didn't answer five because I hope I have
responded to that one already.

&quot;1. With regard to the tone of the Episcopal document: What kind of
tone would better represent an appropriate moral attitude toward the
issue of anti-semitism in the Arab world (which is indisputably there,
and certainly should be comprehensively addressed). Related to that,
what was the context
of this remark? What was the general theme of the document in which
they appeared. For example, if the document had to do specifically
with issues of socially responsible investing, it wouldn't surprise me
to discover that the tone was very dry. These things tend to be.&quot;

You're right. The difference in tone can be explained in part by the
different purposes of the two documents - one a journalistic screed by
Rev. Canon Brian Grieves, and the other a more business-like document
detailing a committee's deliberations. But nevertheless, public speech
in the Episcopalian Church about Arab violence and enmity to Jews and
their state is governed by the tone of the SRI document - restrained
and scholarly. But when it comes time to talk about Israeli policies
regarding the Palestinians, Episcopalian condemnations are filled with
active verbs and theological allusions that point out how badly
Israeli policies contradict our idealized visions of the Holy Land.
The same allusions and even more powerful verbs could be used to
highlight hostility toward the Jews in the Middle East, but for the
most part, these active verbs and biblical allusions just aren't
present in the public speech of any mainline church regarding Arab and
Muslim misdeeds in the Middle East.

&quot;2. On the issue of the settlements and blood libel. It is my
impression that just about anything can provide cover for anti-Semites
to revert to traditional anti-Semitic tropes. Though as I understand
the idea of &quot;blood libel&quot; doesn't have to do with Arabs drinking
Jewish blood (which would be offensive, but not &quot;libelous&quot; regarding
the Jews, but would be regarding the Arabs), but with Jews drinking
Christian blood. Are you using the term &quot;blood libel&quot; in a different
sense than I understand it?&quot;

When I wrote &quot;Can the re-emergence of the blood libel be explained by
the settlements?&quot; I was referring the appearence of the blood libel
against the Jewish people in mass media in the Middle East. The blood
libel, along with the protocols of the elders of zion are part of the
mass media in the Middle East. Go to memri.org for more information.
Also, I think Palestinian Media Watch.

&quot;3. More precisely with regard to the connection between the
settlements and anti-Semitism: I would suggest that, though anti-
Semites will be anti-Semites no matter what the Jews in general or
Israel in particular do, that for the ordinary Arab man and woman on
the street, the existence and reported injustices caused by the
existence of the settlements do indeed add credibility to the charges
of the anti-Semites. It is, in effect, a weapon that Israel gives to
its enemies to attack them with. Were Israel to withdraw from the West
Bank and work with the Palestinians to create a real government,
rather than the failed semi-state that currently exists there, it
would go a long way toward delegitimizing the rhetoric of Anti-
Semitism. As I recently heard Raul Hilberg say (this was shortly
before his death), a just settlement of the Palestinian issue is
important, not only for the sake of the Palestinians,  but for the
sake of Israel as well.&quot;

My response is that enmity toward Israel, an issue that mainline
churches have not fully grappled with, is a major obstacle to a just
settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It is in the main, an
independent variable, not a variable dependent on Israeli policy.
Enmity has remained even in the face of Israel's withdrawal from the
Gaza Strip and its efforts to negotiate peace with Arafat.

Enmity toward Israel and Jews existed long before the '67 War, when
Israel took possession of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

Some history Israel took possession of the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip in a defensive war motivated by the enmity you suggest is
provoked by the Israeli presence in the territories. Israel hoped to
engage in a land for peace deal but was met with the Three Nos of
Khartoum a few months after the war where the Arab League met and
said, &quot;No negotiations, no peace, no recognition of Israel.&quot;

Israel made peace with both Egypt and Jordan, which abandoned their
claims to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It took a while, but
Israel began negotiating with the Palestinians in the 1990s, finally
making an offer in 2000, which was met with the Second Intifada. You
may think the offer was no good, but the fact is, Arafat did not make
a counter offer.

&quot;4. All of this said, I continue to wonder what good the kinds of
statements that you would like to see come from denominations would
have for settling the issue. For example, if the UCC were to condemn
the Iranian Holocaust-denial conference of last year, would it have
any constructive effect? It seems to me that pressure works well when
it's pressure on your allies. Soft power and attraction work best on
your enemies. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, might be ripe for the
kind of document you would like to see.?

I will address this issue at length in the future. This is what I said
about a year ago:

http://www.christianfairwitness.com/writings/What%20Fair%20Witness%20...

BEGIN QUOTE

&quot;What does fair witness require? I'll offer four suggestions.

The first is that we must renounce and distance our churches from the
deicide imagery offered by Rev. Naim Ateek. This is not the language
of peacemaking, but the language of demonization. When mainline
churches turn a blind eye, or worse, apologize for the use of this
imagery, one of the bulwarks of anti-Semitism in American society has
fallen.

Secondly, churches must acknowledge the religious component of the war
against Israel. If Protestant leaders in the U.S., including those in
the UCC, are going to condemn Christian Zionism as a threat to peace,
they have an obligation to acknowledge the religious motivation of
violence against Israel. Religiously-motivated hostility toward
Israel, which Hamas embodies, turns the conflict from a disagreement
over borders and settlements into a fight over the existence of the
Jewish State, an issue over which their can be no compromise. We can
no longer remain silent about this component of the conflict.

Thirdly, our churches must start speaking honestly about the problems
in Palestinian society that will make it difficult for Palestinians to
live in peace with their neighbors and build a future for themselves.
Calling for the creation of a Palestinian state while remaining silent
about collapse of civil order in Gaza, the mistreatment of Christians
by Muslims areas under the control of the Palestinian Authority and
the failure of Palestinian leaders to stop terror attacks against
Israel encourages the creation of nothing more than a failed state
that oppresses its own people and menaces its neighbors.

Fourth, our churches have an obligation to acknowledge the support
Palestinian terrorists receive from other countries in the region. If
Protestants in the U.S. are going to invoke America's &quot;special
relationship&quot; with Israel as justification for the focus on its
misdeeds, they have an obligation to acknowledge the support
terrorists targeting Israel have received from Syria, Iran and up
until recently, Iraq.

I would like to offer one closing comment. Our beloved mainline
churches, for all their quirks, controversies and faults have a unique
capacity to arouse the conscience of the American people. We have an
obligation to make sure that the prophetic voices of our denominations
are directed by an informed conscience, not a hostile agenda. It's
time we started living up to this obligation.&quot;

End of Quote:

(My thinking has evolved a bit since then, but this is in the right
direction.)

One more point:

If Israel (an imperfect, but legitimate democracy) is more likely to
listen to us than Iran (a religious theocracy that oppresses its
opposition and youth), then won't our statements have the impact of
constraining the more responsible party in the conflict? Won't they be
used to score propaganda victories for Ahmadinejad? Look at the volume
of criticism leveled at Israel, and then at Iran. Which country, in
the main, has caused more suffering in the region? And which has been
the target of more criticism from mainline churches on an emprical
level?

">

These are obviously complex questions, and I don't claim to be an expert on
international diplomacy, but let me offer a few off-the-cuff thoughts:

1: &quot;Won't our statements have the impact of constraining the more
responsible party in the conflict?&quot; Yes, they will. The more responsible
party OUGHT to act with more restraint. That's what makes it responsible.

2: &quot;Won't they be used to score propaganda victories for Ahmadinejad?&quot; They
might, but again, Ahmadinejad doesn't need our help to construct a
propaganda narrative. He has been known to misrepresent and take out of
context any number of comments by people who would otherwise not agree with
him. That should not stop us from speaking honestly about the issues that
confront us.

3: &quot;Look at the volume of criticism ...&quot; I don't know what newspapers YOU
read, but I see ENORMOUS criticism of Iran coming from every direction these
days, and, by comparison, almost no criticism directed toward Israel.
Obviously, the situation is much different in European papers compared to
the U.S., but I suspect that if you talk to the person on the street in the
United States and ask about Israel and Iran, they would be primed to offer a
much more trenchant criticism of Iran.

Within the corridors of academia, where I dwell most of the time, things are
a bit different. You are more likely to find critics of Israel and defenders
of Iran (and I'm quite sure you followed the Finkelstein imbroglio here at
DePaul), and even within denominations, I'm sure you'll find more criticism
of Israel, though I suspect that the proximate causes are different. But
even within academia, my personal experience is that when the topic is
Israel most folks are quite circumspect about the issues unless they are
considered experts in the field. I, for example, wouldn't simply spout off
about Israeli politics in class or in an article unless it was on an issue
about which I could claim some kind of expert knowledge (ethics and war, for
example, where I've actually defended Israel's bombing if Egypt on just war
grounds in class, and criticized its bombing of Iraq).

But when it comes to, for example, setting denominational policy, again,
what good is done criticizing Iran, as compared to Israel? I suspect that
most Christians see themselves more closely aligned with Judaism, and thus
by the commutative principle, Israel, than with Iran, and therefore actually
have something constructive to say to it.

4: &quot;Which country, in the main, has caused more suffering in the region.&quot;
Well, the answer to this question has a great deal with how you count the
cost. On the one hand, Iran was the defender in the Iran/Iraq war, so
couldn't be said to have CAUSED the suffering of that war. On the other
hand, it sponsors Hezbollah, and so could be said to have caused the
suffering Hezbollah is responsible for. However, Israel causes suffering to
the Palestinians under occupation, and has been doing so continually for
over 40 years. It also encouraged the growth of Hamas as a counterweight to
the PLO in the '80s, which has since come back to haunt it in tragic ways.
Someone with more resources at his disposal could probably multiply examples
on both sides all day, but would we really come to a conclusion about who
has &quot;caused more&quot; suffering?

What I think your question implies is &quot;who do we LIKE more.&quot; And clearly, we
like Israel more. But I go back to my continual theme. It's BECAUSE we like
them more that we are responsible to speak truthfully about their policy. In
the case of Iran, it would simply be seen as piling on.

Let me go off on a brief tangent to make my point a bit clearer. Yesterday,
a colleague sent me a flier that's going around campus about &quot;Islamo-fascism
Awareness Week.&quot; Including such events as:

Ø      A keynote speaker on Islamo-Fascism
Ø      A panel on the Oppression of Women in Islam or any facet of the
Islamo-Fascist threat
Ø      A showing of Suicide Killers, Obsession, or Islam: What the West
Needs to Know or the ABC mini-series The Path to 9/11
Ø      A ³sit-in² outside the offices of the Women¹s Studies Department
protesting the silence of feminists over the oppression of women in Islam
Ø      A petition denouncing Islamo-Fascism and its violence against women,
gays, Christians, Jews and religious people
Ø      A memorial service for the victims of Islamo-Fascist violence around
the world.

Now, on the one hand, I look at the &quot;issues&quot; that this program is designed
to address (e.g., oppression of women) and see them as valid. On the other
hand, I ask, &quot;what purpose does such a program serve? It certainly doesn't
add to any meaningful discussion of or understanding of the complexities of
Islam. It doesn't REALLY help anyone understand issues of women and Islam (a
topic that we actually did deal with responsibly in a Panel at DePaul last
year), and it's not REALLY going to change anyone's mind vis-à-vis say &quot;gays
and Islam. It's sole purpose is to inflame anti-Islamic sentiment and
shore-up the cordons of conservative activists on campus, who are
increasingly indistinguishable from anti-Muslim bigots.

Any attempts, I think, to engage in criticism of the Muslim world has to be
carefully calibrated to avoid seeming to pile onto anti-Islamic sentiment.
Although you might argue in response that a similarly careful calibration is
necessary to avoid anti-Semitism, I would make two points: First, I think
most of the time they are so calibrated (but I'm sure you can find anecdotes
to the contrary), and second, in the United States, I simply don't see
anti-Semitism rearing its ugly head in nearly the same way I see
anti-Islamism.

Enough for today. I'll look forward to any response you feel like offering.

This is too easy a response Scott. It's ducking the issue. Take a look
at Israel on the world stage and in the Middle East. Mainline Churches
have set themselves up as judges of the rights and wrongs of the Arab-
Israeli conflict and we invoke our religious identity and connections
to the region to lend credibility to the narrative we offer. And the
narrative we've offered has been to hold Israel to one standard of
conduct and its adversaries to no standard at all. And a while back,
when this group was on yahoo, I asked you if there were any
fundamental differences between Israel and its adversaries and you
said (to the best of my memory) that there weren't any meaningful
differences.

Now you seem to be saying the opposite, that there are meaningful
differences and that the fact Israel is a more responsible country it
is subject to harsher criticism while the misdeeds of its adversaries
(who won't listen to us anyway) aren't worth mentioning. If they won't
listen to us anyway, then doesn't that suggest that they aren't
amenable to peace? Then if that's the case, Scott, what business do we
have making &quot;peacemaking&quot; statements when one side has no interest in
making peace?

More to the point, what corrective will we undertake to make sure our
peacemaking statements do not have anti-Semitic consequences? And when
I mean anti-Semitic, I don't mean the blood libel, but opposition to
Jewish action because its Jewish. Let's look at the Middle East as it
is. People with guns and explosives hate Jews and are offended by the
notion of a Jewish state in the Middle East. Jews with guns, planes,
security barriers, and F-16s are able to keep them at bay. The
countries inhabited and governed by people who hate Jews and Israel
don't listen to us, but get lots of our money through the sale of oil
to the West. Israelis however, are dependent on the West for weapons
and for financial support.

Now, lets look at the mainline churches. We offer up divestment
resolutions targeting Israel's defense establishment. For example, the
New England Methodists have targeted companies doing business with
Israel's defense establishment for divestment. The New England
Methodists, when challenged say &quot;Well, we don't know of any companies
that provide weapons to the Palestinians, so we haven't made a list.)
What's the ultimate logical consequence of this disparity --
divestment from Israel, condemnations for the Palestinians? Sounds
pretty uneven. Ultimately the New England Methodists have taken a
small, but concrete step toward Israeli disarmament, but have done
nothing to do the same for the Palestinians. This is what the United
Methodists have to offer in its peacemaking agenda: Words of criticism
for Palestinians and a blacklist for Israel. Their justification? &quot;We
are not aware of any investments by Methodists in companies that
supply the Palestinians with armaments.&quot; That's a quote.

Now, given the broad scope of Christian-Jewish history and the
undeniable enmity toward Israel in the Middle East, is such behavior
resonsible? Is it right? Does it really encourage peace? Really. I
hope you can deal with these real world specifics, Scott.

I don't think we have spoken honestly about the Arab-Israeli conflict,
and you have suggested that it's not necessary for us to do so because
well, some of the people who we all know deserve criticism won't
listen to us any way, so we might as well talk about the sins of the
people who will listen to us -- Israel. You are stating in effect,
that the prophetic voice of our church should be motivated by
considerations about who will listen to us, not by the reality we are
commenting on. John 18:38

If we can't accurately describe the realities of the world that people
can check out for themselves and comment on in a credible manner, then
how do we confess to the reality of the empty tomb?

The churches invoke their identity as a religous institution and their
connections to the region to buttress their credibility when speaking
about what's going on and you have told us that they can (and even
should) focus on the misdeeds of Israel (because it listens to us)
over the misdeeds of those who would destroy Israel (because they
don't).

Who benefits, Scott? Who benefits from this religiously sanctioned
silence about the misdeeds of Israel's adversaries and constant
criticism of Israel?

&gt; suffering Hezbollah is responsible for. However, Israel causes suffering to
&gt; the Palestinians under occupation, and has been doing so continually for
&gt; over 40 years. It also encouraged the growth of Hamas as a counterweight to
&gt; the PLO in the '80s, which has since come back to haunt it in tragic ways.
&gt; Someone with more resources at his disposal could probably multiply examples
&gt; on both sides all day, but would we really come to a conclusion about who
&gt; has &quot;caused more&quot; suffering?

&gt; What I think your question implies is &quot;who do we LIKE more.&quot; And clearly, we
&gt; like Israel more. But I go back to my continual theme. It's BECAUSE we like
&gt; them more that we are responsible to speak truthfully about their policy. In
&gt; the case of Iran, it would simply be seen as piling on.

&gt; Let me go off on a brief tangent to make my point a bit clearer. Yesterday,
&gt; a colleague sent me a flier that's going around campus about &quot;Islamo-fascism
&gt; Awareness Week.&quot; Including such events as:

&gt; Ø A keynote speaker on Islamo-Fascism
&gt; Ø A panel on the Oppression of Women in Islam or any facet of the
&gt; Islamo-Fascist threat
&gt; Ø A showing of Suicide Killers, Obsession, or Islam: What the West
&gt; Needs to Know or the ABC mini-series The Path to 9/11
&gt; Ø A ³sit-in² outside the offices of the Women¹s Studies Department
&gt; protesting the silence of feminists over the oppression of women in Islam
&gt; Ø A petition denouncing Islamo-Fascism and its violence against women,
&gt; gays, Christians, Jews and religious people
&gt; Ø A memorial service for the victims of Islamo-Fascist violence around
&gt; the world.

&gt; Now, on the one hand, I look at the &quot;issues&quot; that this program is designed
&gt; to address (e.g., oppression of women) and see them as valid. On the other
&gt; hand, I ask, &quot;what purpose does such a program serve? It certainly doesn't
&gt; add to any meaningful discussion of or understanding of the complexities of
&gt; Islam. It doesn't REALLY help anyone understand issues of women and Islam (a
&gt; topic that we actually did deal with responsibly in a Panel at DePaul last
&gt; year), and it's not REALLY going to change anyone's mind vis-à-vis say &quot;gays
&gt; and Islam. It's sole purpose is to inflame anti-Islamic sentiment and
&gt; shore-up the cordons of conservative activists on campus, who are
&gt; increasingly indistinguishable from anti-Muslim bigots.

&gt; Any attempts, I think, to engage in criticism of the Muslim world has to be
&gt; carefully calibrated to avoid seeming to pile onto anti-Islamic sentiment.
&gt; Although you might argue in response that a similarly careful calibration is
&gt; necessary to avoid anti-Semitism, I would make two points: First, I think
&gt; most of the time they are so calibrated (but I'm sure you can find anecdotes
&gt; to the contrary), and second, in the United States, I simply don't see
&gt; anti-Semitism rearing its ugly head in nearly the same way I see
&gt; anti-Islamism.

&gt; Enough for today. I'll look forward to any response you feel like offering.

What's &quot;good&quot; about it, Chris?

Ultimately, Scott, an ethics professor is telling us that mainline
churches only need to tell the truth when there is a chance we will be
listened to. Is that a way to direct the prophetic voice of a mainline
church?

Is that a principle we should be adhering to?

There are a lot of audiences that we need to take into consideration.
First the audience in the Middle East, made up of many countries that
Scott admits will not listen to us, and some that will.

Then there are people in the U.S. who trust our churches to interpret
reality for them, and if they rely on our churches as a moral compass
for their understanding of world politics, which if we follow Scott's
metric will only hear a partial critique of reality when we speak to
willing audiences in the Middle East.

Now, if our churches aren't obligated to give our members and
listeners here in the U.S. a comprehensive moral view of the world and
reality -- the reality our religion is meant to help us interpret,
then why did Jesus bother with the second touch with the blind man at
Beth-Saida? If trees walking weren't good enough then, why now?

It seems that people seem to believe that since the church is only one
of many competing voices in American society and not the primary or
dominant influence on the conscience of its members, then it can work
to &quot;balance&quot; the distorted narrative offered by other institutions,
like the press, with little concern for offering a comprehensive
description or analysis of the issues its commenting on. How can
responsible Christians arrive at good ethical responses under these
circumstances?

On one hand, we invoke our credibility as religious institutions to
get people to believe us, and then on the other hand, we invoke our
presence in a pluralistic society to assert that we don't need to
offer a comprehensive response to the problems we face and can descend
to offering the one-sided narrative we abhor when we see it on Fox
News. There's a contradiction there.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If Israel (an imperfect, but legitimate democracy) is more likely to
&gt; &gt; &gt; listen to us than Iran (a religious theocracy that oppresses its
&gt; &gt; &gt; opposition and youth), then won't our statements have the impact of
&gt; &gt; &gt; constraining the more responsible party in the conflict? Won't they be
&gt; &gt; &gt; used to score propaganda victories for Ahmadinejad? Look at the volume
&gt; &gt; &gt; of criticism leveled at Israel, and then at Iran. Which country, in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the main, has caused more suffering in the region? And which has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; the target of more criticism from mainline churches on an emprical
&gt; &gt; &gt; level?

&gt; &gt; These are obviously complex questions, and I don't claim to be an expert on
&gt; &gt; international diplomacy, but let me offer a few off-the-cuff thoughts:

&gt; &gt; 1: &quot;Won't our statements have the impact of constraining the more
&gt; &gt; responsible party in the conflict?&quot; Yes, they will. The more responsible
&gt; &gt; party OUGHT to act with more restraint. That's what makes it responsible.

&gt; &gt; 2: &quot;Won't they be used to score propaganda victories for Ahmadinejad?&quot; They
&gt; &gt; might, but again, Ahmadinejad doesn't need our help to construct a
&gt; &gt; propaganda narrative. He has been known to misrepresent and take out of
&gt; &gt; context any number of comments by people who would otherwise not agree with
&gt; &gt; him. That should not stop us from speaking honestly about the issues that
&gt; &gt; confront us.

&gt; &gt; 3: &quot;Look at the volume of criticism ...&quot; I don't know what newspapers YOU
&gt; &gt; read, but I see ENORMOUS criticism of Iran coming from every direction these
&gt; &gt; days, and, by comparison, almost no criticism directed toward Israel.
&gt; &gt; Obviously, the situation is much different in European papers compared to
&gt; &gt; the U.S., but I suspect that if you talk to the person on the street in the
&gt; &gt; United States and ask about Israel and Iran, they would be primed to offer a
&gt; &gt; much more trenchant criticism of Iran.

&gt; &gt; Within the corridors of academia, where I dwell most of the time, things are
&gt; &gt; a bit different. You are more likely to find critics of Israel and defenders
&gt; &gt; of Iran (and I'm quite sure you followed the Finkelstein imbroglio here at
&gt; &gt; DePaul), and even within denominations, I'm sure you'll find more criticism
&gt; &gt; of Israel, though I suspect that the proximate causes are different. But
&gt; &gt; even within academia, my personal experience is that when the topic is
&gt; &gt; Israel most folks are quite circumspect about the issues unless they are
&gt; &gt; considered experts in the field. I, for example, wouldn't simply spout off
&gt; &gt; about Israeli politics in class or in an article unless it was on an issue
&gt; &gt; about which I could claim some kind of expert knowledge (ethics and war, for
&gt; &gt; example, where I've actually defended Israel's bombing if Egypt on just war
&gt; &gt; grounds in class, and criticized its bombing of Iraq).

&gt; &gt; But when it comes to, for example, setting denominational policy, again,
&gt; &gt; what good is done criticizing Iran, as compared to Israel? I suspect that
&gt; &gt; most Christians see themselves more closely aligned with Judaism, and thus
&gt; &gt; by the commutative principle, Israel, than with Iran, and therefore actually
&gt; &gt; have something constructive to say to it.

&gt; &gt; 4: &quot;Which country, in the main, has caused more suffering in the region.&quot;
&gt; &gt; Well, the answer to this question has a great deal with how you count the
&gt; &gt; cost. On the one hand, Iran was the defender in the Iran/Iraq war, so
&gt; &gt; couldn't be said to have CAUSED the suffering of that war. On the other
&gt; &gt; hand, it sponsors Hezbollah, and so could be said to have caused the
&gt; &gt; suffering Hezbollah is responsible for. However, Israel causes suffering to
&gt; &gt; the Palestinians under occupation, and has been doing so continually for
&gt; &gt; over 40 years. It also encouraged the growth of Hamas as a counterweight to
&gt; &gt; the PLO in the '80s, which has since come back to haunt it in tragic ways.

&gt; &gt; has &quot;caused more&quot; suffering?

Dexter,  I think Scott quit and I am not up to his wisdom or scholarship on
this issue.  I did defend a UN resolutions in the 80's at a debate with a
Rabbi in Newton City Hall.  (Newton is a community west of Boston with a
large Jewish population.  Stronger temples than churches)  So I might be
part of the liberal church group that is critical of Israel.  I think the
question is not weather there is a critical edge toward Israel from the
mainline church (I agree there is), but why.  I don't agree that Israel is
the most responsible state in the middle east. I assume all states try to
figure out how to live with some stability in a complex world and the
middles east seems a lot more complex than the northeast USA.  I do believe
Israel is a democratic state as is Turkey and democratic states maybe more
responsive to pressure and maybe more open to change than kingdoms, but all
states in the region are facing difficult pressures including Iran, Turkey,
Egypt.  I think at times we might have a romantic view of Israel but I would
think a state is a state and not the City of God, so they act to protect
their self interest.

I Think one of the reasons we are critical of Israel is that we support
Israel both economically and politically.  We  veto most UN resolutions that
were critical of Israel and if the new defense bill goes through we will be
giving Israel 30 billion $ in the next 10 years.  I assume we do this not
because of some lobby but because we think it is in our self interest and it
get the Jewish and Evangelical vote. At the same time we have little
creditability with the Palestine and maybe we shouldn't. By in large Israel
has a very favorable press in USA and Iran has a very negative press.  Scott
was simply saying we don't say much about Iran because there is no
relations, we have no churches there, no money there.  We do have all sorts
of personal, economic, military and theological connects in Palestine and
Israel.  Some of your folks have lived and studied there.

That book you are reviewing does not sound very good but the Carter book
also got panned and most criticism of Israel is always deflected by the
double standard rebuttal.

I don't have any wisdom for Israel but I wonder if the policy of the past
years will secure Israel's future if the self interest of the US shifts
after a defeat in Iraq or the need for oil forces us to moderate our
support.  The population trends are not very encouraging for Israel's future
and the new Iran influence is not good news. It's not important to make
friends with the mainline churches our future and influence is questionable
but is the fence the best policy? Are guns the only aid we can send? Can
relationship with Jordan or Egypt or Turkey we strengthened?  Is there a
role for the Arabs who may also want stability?  I think Scott was trying to
raise some of these issues. I think there might be room for dialogue if we
could frame the question differently and not see the mainline church just as
an enemy.  There are half way decent people interested in the peace of
Jerusalem in the mainline churches.  Peace, Herb

The issue is not what I'm saying, it's what you're hearing, and what you

their assemblies -- they invoke people regarded as unreasonable
critics (the same way some people regard me in the UCC!)  Is that
fair? Is it right? Is it just? Does it make for peace? And I'm not
talking about inviting the Israeli Diplomatic corps, but people like
Yossi Klein Halevi to speak. They would speak eloquently about what
Israel has done to achieve peace, the risks it has taken, and the harm
the Palestinian terror has done to the Israeli left, and the Israeli
peace movement. The peace movement that was created during the 1990s
has largely been SHATTERED.

And the problem is, and I like Scott have a tough time feeling like
I'm being heard on this issue, is that there are a lot of problems in
the Arab and Muslim world that contribute to the continued existence
of the conflict. And the mainline churches don't comment on them with
the same regularity they deserve. They don't accord them the gravity
they deserve.

Someone I trust said, &quot;Dexter, one of the reasons why we are willing
to criticize the Jewish community is because we feel that it is a
community we are a part of.&quot; She understood that was a problematic
statement, which was why she made the assumption public because she
realized it was problematic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From my perspective, I see a lot of reasons put forth to justify
">

singluar, focused judgement on Israel and relative silence about the
problems and misdeeds of its adversaries. One of the reasons why the
U.S. sends weapons to Israel is because of the enmity of its
neighbors. We talk as if the weapons are the cause of the enmity, when
in fact, the enmity is one of the reasons why the weapons are
necessary. Arab enmity toward Israel is a largely (see the nuance
here) an indepdendent variable, and when we talk about it as if it is
largely a dependent variable, we do great harm.

Now, onto the theology. I am not an expert, but I have one comment. We
would never use leviticus to determine our response to flesh and blood
Gays and lesbians down the street from our house. We would deal with
them as flesh-and-blood human beings and accord them their humanity.

Now, when I see people reading Romans 9-11 to determine how they
should regard the Jewish people -- a flesh and blood community -- real
people -- a sociological reality, I get deeply troubled. When I see
Rev. Dr. Burge write -- in a book about the modern state of Israel --
I get deeply troubled. &quot;Cast out and Burned&quot;? Unbelievable.

Dear Dexter,  I think I can separate the theological discussion reflecting
on Rom 9-11 from the political discussion of the state of Israel.  I think I
can see the state of Israel as a nation state that has won some land from
other people and then for political reasons that believed this was in the
best interest of all their victory was affirmed by the UN.  I do not see the
state of Israel as the work of the Messiah.  The discussion on Rom 9-11 and
other texts deal with the relationship between two peoples who claim to be
the children of Abraham, heirs of the promise and that has been a difficult
discussion for the past 2000 years. My nice clean separation doesn't exist
since questions about  the land  and the Red Heifer keep popping up so its
very complex.  So I think you over speak or maybe I would say distort when
you say main line church would not use Lev to define homosexuals but would
use the NT to define the State of Israel.  I think that is not an accurate
picture of the Mainline Church nor a fair reflection of the discussion.

My experience in the mainline church is similar to Scott on the question of
Israel.  There are zealots  who see Israel as the oppressor, but most of the
time I think there is an attempt to get some balance between our concern for
Israel and our concern for Christian in Palestine and the Palestine people.
I know the Jewish community has often seen this as betrayal but it is hard
to find that balance and I get the feeling often that any criticism is
unwelcome.  Is there any real dialogue going on at present with Israel and
the mainline church?  Even with us it is difficult to talk about this issue
and if the mainline church is seen as the enemy then discussion will be
impossible.

Our present model on this forum doesn't seem to be working (just my
judgment) is there another model?  Herb

That balance has not shown up in mainline resolutions.

Take a look at Whose Land? Whose Promise? It is a combustible mix of
misinformation and hostile theology regarding the Jewish people. Of
course no one is going to like criticism of something important to
them. But ultimately, they will ask whether or not it is fair and what
motivates it.

When they see tolerance for use of deicide imagery in reference to
Israel in mainline churches, mainline leaders limiting their
information to Israel's most irrational critics and sometimes its
enemies, they start to question whether or not Israel will ever get a
&quot;fair shake&quot; in the mainline church.

Is there any real dialogue going on at present with Israel and

It might be necessary for the leaders of churches to consider what
they have done to contribute to this circumstance. This didn't happen
in a vaccuum.

On this, I know a lot more than I am willing to say in this venue. In
a face-to-face discussion, maybe.

I got an idea. If Scott makes a list of bottom line issues that need
to be addressed in any resolution, I will make a similar list.

Sorry to be tardy responding. I'm training for the Chicago Marathon, and
this past weekend was our 26-mile training run before the big marathon, so
it's taken up most of my attention.

I'm really not particularly interested in being the foil for Dexter in this
debate, because I'm really busy, and as I've said before, I don't claim
expertise in this area, except as an interested layperson. Nevertheless,
I'll accept Dexter's invitation, and lay out a few key principles that I
think need to exist, and Dexter can respond at his leisure, but I can't
promise I'll have time to add to this very sketchy, initial thoughts.

So, what needs to take place?

On the Palestinian side:

1) They need to get their political house in order. Right now, their
inability to clean house and govern themselves gives political cover for
those opposed to a Palestinian state, and it's just plain no good for the
Palestinian people.

2) The internationally recognized leaders of the PA, specifically Abbas,
have to renounce violence, and be seen to take steps to reign in the
violence against Israeli interests. (However, the efforts that they're
making to do this contribute to problem (1), above.

3) Strengthen civil society and public service sectors to look after issues
of public welfare and the common good, so that ordinary Palestinians have
the food/water/money that they need to survive.

4) In a general sense, create, insofar as possible, the conditions for
creating a sound government and economy to sustain a Palestinian State. What
makes this exceedingly difficult is that the PA has historically been
extraordinarily corrupt and incompetent. What adds to the difficulty is that
the PA can get almost nothing of significance done right now without the
cooperation of the Israeli government.

On the Israeli side:

1) Move the wall to within the internationally recognized borders of Israel,
without cutting into the PA areas.

2) Re-engage with the PA over issues pertaining to Israeli involvement in PA
matters. Unilateral withdrawal, such as that which took place in Gaza,
didn't accomplish anything good, and created a huge open-air prison for the
Palestinians there. If you want a real life idea of what &quot;Escape from New
York&quot; might be, check out Gaza. If something similar happens within the West
Bank, not even the Wall will keep out terrorism over the long term.

3) In light of that, removed settlements on the West Bank. All of them.
They're in violation of international law, and have been foisted on most
Israelis unwillingly. Let's start, by they way, with Hebron, which is a
completely in-your-face and unjustifiable imposition on the Palestinians.
I've been to Hebron. It's a miserable place.

4) Work constructively with the PA to settle issues such as water rights,
travel (which would be partly ameliorated by the removal of the
settlements), etc., and create a setting in which Palestinians can begin to
build an economy without Israeli interference (e.g., the ability to
construct airports and seaports that would be necessary for such an
economy).

5) Israel needs to practice forbearance with regard to terrorism. It can't
continue the practice of disengaging from the PA every time a terrorist
attack takes place. This essentially gives the terrorists a &quot;heckler's veto&quot;
over the peace process.

What both sides need to decide jointly:

1) Right of return. There has to be SOME recognition of the right of return
for Palestinians who have been alienated from their property, and/or some
financial settlement to allow refugees to resettle on new land. But
obviously at this late date, it's practically impossible to restore to the
Palestinians everything they've lost. Some middle position needs to be
reached.

2) Jerusalem. If the only position Israel will accept is Jerusalem as the
sole property of Israel, a settlement will never work. If the only position
the Palestinians will accept is Jerusalem as the sole property of Palestine,
a settlement will never work. The best option would be Jerusalem as an
international city. But that would be a very delicate balance to maintain.

My bottom line is this: In 2001, at Taba, they came very close to a viable
settlement, but then time ran out on the Clinton presidency. If we could get
back to Taba, with a president as energetic and engaged as Clinton was, we
could get close to something legitimately viable.

Worst case scenario: Another disengaged or hostile U.S. President, combined
with Bibi Netanyahu as Israeli PM, combined with further Hamas consolidation
of power.

I'm sure I could write more. Again, this is all off the top of my head.
