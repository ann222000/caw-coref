I was recetly at Lowe's and spotted bags of aquatic plant soil.  The
packaging stated that the material was pH neutral and it appeared
granular like the flushable kitty litter (one bag was torn).

Anyone have any experience with this type of substrate?

I've bought something very similar to that at Home Depot and found that it
works great at the bottom of my tank. I need to get some more actually...

You talking about the Schultz stuff: http://tinyurl.com/28u9pc

Works great and been around for a while under different names.  Talked
about on the Krib here: http://tinyurl.com/yplmqn

My only complaint is that it is a fairly light substrate (i.e. not
heavy) and have trouble with it holding some plants down until they
are well rooted.

True, and if your not careful You'll get a bucket full of it when you
syphon... But other than that it works great.

I like it too.  I agree that it's a little hard to plant in, but once
the plants root it's fine.  I also use it for pond plants.

I have found mixing plant substrates with standard aquarium gravel
eliminates the problem of holding down roots on new plants without
established roots. This also stretches the budget as well, and I also
add a very small amount to the plant bases after cleanings (it tends
to settle thru the gravel) to help carry more fresh nutrients to the
roots.

When I vacuum, I 'kink' the hose while vacuuming and I only surface
vacuum around plant roots, so the light tendencies of plant substrates
have not caused me a problem here (also after being in the tank for a
while it tends to get heavier from bacteria).
Currently I am using Azoos Plant Grower Media, although I still
occasionally prepare my own form compost mixed with sand (we have
river bottom soil and I compost everything I can).
