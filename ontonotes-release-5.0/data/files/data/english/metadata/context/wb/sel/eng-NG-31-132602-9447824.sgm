Although Sanford is quite a modest fellow, and certainly may blush at
my 'outing' him this way, I just wanted to express my respect and
thanks for his part in the development of American tanka and his
addition to the world tanka scene. Below you will find some
CURRENT links, with examples of his work and a little history, for the
youngsters that may be unaware. Sincerely, Michele

Yes, I bet Sanford WILL blush. Many years of remarkable work, as poet,
translator, teacher, and friend.

P.S. Of those tanka in the links included in this thread, I'm
particularly enjoying this one:

reading over
the answers I spelled out
for an interview,
I wonder if this Sanford
isn't someone I made up

(BTW, the Amazon links don't work well, but when you click the Amazon
link, just type in his name. It's quite remarkable and an education.)
Here's another poem of Sanford's for those who don't get to the links:

jabbed for blood
and the vein missed;
oh, substitute nurse,
must I carry
your black and blue?

It was my pleasure to write a blurb for Sanford's upcoming book: Four
Decades on my Tanka Road, will is an important book for anyone
interested in tanka.

In addition, Modern English Press has reissued a compilation of Five
Lines Down : A Landmark in English Tanka, which Sanford and Kenneth
Tamemura edited in the 1990s. It includes editorial and book reviews
which Sanford has written about tanka, as well as some of the best
tanka in the English language. Many tanka that have been reprinted
elsewhere first appeared in these pays.  &lt; http://www.lulu.com/content/
1047006&gt; Five Lines Down is a must-read.

Dear Janet, Shanna, and Michele--

Dear Janet--I am not sure now if Michele quoted those
poems or Janet or a ghost from the graveyard.  But how
much I have been moved, poems suddenly appearing from
the past.  Sanford

Dear Shanna, you are always such a good sport about
criticism. Keep tanka-ing. Sanford

Dear Michele--I am so jolted you quoted those poems.
It brought back memories. Thank you, thank you,
Sanford

Dear Janet, Shanna, and Michele--

Dear Janet--I am not sure now if Michele quoted those
poems or Janet or a ghost from the graveyard.  But how
much I have been moved, poems suddenly appearing from
the past.  Sanford

Dear Shanna, you are always such a good sport about
criticism. Keep tanka-ing. Sanford

Dear Michele--I am so jolted you quoted those poems.
It brought back memories. Thank you, thank you,
Sanford

Well Sanford, the pleasure is all mine. Janet was the first to quote
your Reading Over, and prompted me to answer with your Jabbed For
Blood. They are pretty good, aren't they? No wonder Michaelangelo held
poetry in higher esteem than any of the other arts (including painting
and sculpture). It's an honor to know you and your work is like
lightening in a bottle. Sincerely, Michele

Dear Michele--

Again thanks.  Later, after I do my rapid hour walk,
do my mat exercises, clean the kitchen/dining/living
rooms, I will take a look at those links. I am
curious.  Sanford

what tanka should do!

Dear Michele--

I just read the Poet's Pofile by Jane Reichhold in her
on-line series--it was published about me in July
2001--this was the first time I saw it, and I am
really surprised. Thank you for letting me know. I
write Jane to thank her.  Fondly, Sanford

Michele, when I was a kid, we had something called
invisible ink, and I remembered it. The poem has some
reference to NORLA, but it applies to all of us who
want all criticism to be sweet.  Fondly, Sanford
I will try wikipedia.org, etc.
