Film lobbyist Jack Valenti dies at 85

By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Movie Writer Fri Apr 27, 3:10 AM ET

LOS ANGELES - Jack Valenti was not just Hollywood's top lobbyist. He
was one of its biggest stars. The 85-year-old Valenti, who died
Thursday of complications from a stroke in March, led the movie
industry out of the prudishness of old Hollywood and into an age of
freer expression with the creation of the film rating system that has
endured nearly 40 years.

The former White House aide went from politics to show business,
overseeing the Motion Picture Association of America with eloquence,
bullheadedness and flair.

Valenti was a passionate envoy, deflecting criticism of Hollywood with
wit and humility, fostering its interests overseas and fiercely
combating threats to the industry such as film piracy.

"In a very real sense, he was the ultimate leading man," said Dan
Glickman, Valenti's successor as head of the MPAA.

A former aide to Lyndon Johnson who was in the motorcade the day
President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Valenti went from Beltway
insider to Hollywood baron when he took over the MPAA in 1966.

His impact on American culture was almost immediate. Recognizing that
the industry had outgrown the morality code regulating movie content
since the 1930s, Valenti replaced it with a ratings system that
survives today with its G, PG, PG-13 and R designations.

Valenti's ratings system "enabled the industry to give parents the
information they need to make appropriate decisions for their children
while at the same time eliminating the possibility of government
censorship from the content of the movies," said John Fithian, who
heads the National Association of Theatre Owners.

The ratings system has its critics, but Valenti always defended it as
an example of democracy in action.

Without it, films might have been subject to government censorship, so
it ensured freedom of expression for moviemakers, Valenti said. And,
he said, the ratings designations gave fair warning to audiences about
content they might prefer to skip.

"While I believe that every director, studio has the right to make the
movies they want to make, everybody else has a right not to watch it,"
Valenti told The Associated Press shortly before his retirement in
2004. "All we do is give advance cautionary warnings and say this is
what we think is in this movie."

A short man with thick, snow-white hair and a speaking style both
eloquent and homey, Valenti was a colorful fixture at the
Academy Awards, major film festivals such as Cannes and other industry
gatherings.

"In a sometimes unreasonable business, Jack Valenti was a giant voice
of reason,"
Steven Spielberg said in a statement. "He was the greatest ambassador
Hollywood has ever known, and I will value his wisdom and friendship
for all time."

Valenti had been hospitalized at Johns Hopkins University Medical
Center in Baltimore until this week, when his family took him home.

Kirk Douglas said Valenti, his friend for more than 45 years, visited
him in New York City in March for a talk the actor gave to a Young
Men's Hebrew Association group.

"He was so full of vitality. He was excited about his book that was
soon to be released. Two days later, I got a call about his stroke. My
wife and I flew to Johns Hopkins hospital immediately," Douglas said.
"He was in a coma. I held his hand and talked to him. Maybe he heard
me. My only consolation is that he did not suffer."

Valenti's Washington career was born from tragedy. As a Texas-based
political consultant working for then-Vice President Johnson, Valenti
was riding in the presidential motorcade on Nov. 22, 1963, when
President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. Valenti, six cars behind
the president, initially didn't know what happened.

"Without a trace of warning, the car in front of us accelerated from
eight miles an hour to eighty," he wrote in his memoir, "This Time,
This Place," to be published in June. "The whole spectacle turned
bizarre, like an arcade game run amok, as we drove madly toward or
away from some unnamed terror."

In an Associated Press interview, he said in 2003 that the
assassination "is so seared in my memory I literally, sometimes at
night - not often, but once or twice a year - I relive that day."

Hurried aboard Air Force One for Johnson's historic flight back to
Washington, Valenti was instantly drafted as a special assistant to
the new president.

His duties grew to include congressional relations, diplomacy and
speech editing, and he attended Cabinet and National Security Council
meetings. Valenti became known for his loyalty, likening Johnson to
Lincoln for his civil rights efforts and declaring, to widespread
ridicule, "I sleep each night a little better" knowing Johnson was in
charge.

"There is a hole in our hearts with his passing. Jack was a giant of a
man. He was our most sage counselor, eloquent spokesman, and ardent
defender," said Johnson's daughter, Luci Baines Johnson. "He made each
of us feel he loved us best, and oh how our family adored him."

Yet Valenti resigned in 1966, over Johnson's objections, to accept the
movie post. He became one of the highest-paid and best-known trade
association executives, with a salary topping $1 million and his own
star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

The ratings system has met with recent disapproval from many film
critics, cinema fans and moviemakers, especially directors of
independent films who say the system favors big studio productions and
over edgier, low-budget fare. Critics also say the system is overly
prudish on sex while allowing excessive violence.

Valenti was always quick to rebut critics, saying frequent MPAA
surveys found that parents with young children felt the ratings system
was a helpful guide.

Born in Houston, the grandson of Sicilian immigrants, Valenti swept
floors and made popcorn in a local theater as a boy. He never lost his
wonder at what he called the "miraculous, unfathomable alchemy" of
moviemaking.

After earning the Distinguished Flying Cross for piloting bombing
missions over Italy in World War II, he worked his way through night
school at the University of Houston, then earned a master's in
business administration from Harvard.

In 1952, he co-founded an advertising and political consulting agency.
He was introduced to Senate Majority Leader Johnson three years later
and was "mesmerized," Valenti recalled. "I felt a primal force was in
my presence."

He met his future wife, Mary Margaret Wiley, through his budding
friendship with the senator - she was Johnson's longtime secretary.
They had three children.

Valenti wrote a handful of books, including one on Johnson, "A Very
Human President," and a novel, "Protect and Defend," published in 1992
by Doubleday with the help of one of its senior editors, Jacqueline
Kennedy.

By the time he retired, the movie business had been on a growth spurt
for more than a decade, with admissions climbing to their highest
level since the late 1950s.

"I'm the luckiest guy in the world, because I spent my entire public
working career in two of life's classic fascinations, politics and
Hollywood," he said in 2004. "You can't beat that."

Right, the kind of "freer expression" that is a primary
image of decadent, profligate Americanism that the
Islamo-Fascists have grown to hate. Thanks a lot, Jack.

I tried to word an even stronger sentence than Richard's but it is an
eloquent expression of the reason for my disdain for much of American Media
aka Hollywood. Hollywood, BTW, being one of the more disgusting trenches in
America. There is NO DOUBT that Hollywood has defined American society with
media in ways which create moral enemies. And non-Americans who derive their
image of America from our media do not understand America.

On the other hand. Everyone in the world ought to have all of the seasons of
South Park on DVD. I mean if you're gonna fool em why not confuse them
completely?
