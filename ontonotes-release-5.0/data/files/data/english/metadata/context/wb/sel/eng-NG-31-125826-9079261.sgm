I went to work on my bike yesterday. In the evening I rode out to visit my
mother.
This made 16 miles altogether.

I didn't wear a helmet.
I didn't ride on the pavement.
I stopped at traffic lights
I used lights and hiviz in the dark
No driver killed me
I didn't kill any pedestrians

Gosh how uneventful.

But it was enjoyable, as expected. I don't see the outside world where I
work so I was surprised to be told it had rained heavily. Although there was
a slight touch of drizzle before I left in the morning and the roads were
damp it didn't develop during my journey.

In the evening the sky was clear, the traffic was light and the lights on
the buildings near the canal reflected in the still water. I made good time
to my mother (the 5 miles only takes 5 minutes longer than by car). The
evening was warmer than expected but I carried fresh clothes. Coming back,
the traffic was lighter, the air fresher and I didn't rush. I like crossing
town on the bike at night - I feel like a ghost, travelling quietly and
anonymously; and even the buildings that are less aesthetic in daylight can
take on a different perspective when under the cover of lights and darkness.

I think that this is the case for the 'silent majority' of cyclists :-)

I had to cycle across Norwich with loppers, shears and four heavy bags
of coffee in my panniers. WVM behind revved at the lights and hugged
my back wheel as I ploughed uphill. It wasn't safe for him to overtake
and he didn't, so at the summit I turned in the saddle and  showed him
a hand, then a thumb up and got the same back. He realised I was

Well said that man.

I am a car driver and have been known to do over 40,000 miles a year on
business.  It's down to about 20,000 at the moment.

I got back onto a bike 6 months ago, for health and recreational purposes,
after well over a twenty year gap.  I've slowly built up to an average of
60-65 miles over a week, which is probably peanuts to some of you, but it's
plenty enough for me!  My usual ride takes me on local roads, suburban
roads, country roads and the first red route outside of London.

I do wear a helmet, but only because the wife nagged me into it and I do
like a quiet life;

I don't ride on the pavement, probably because I'm of the age when coppers
told you off for doing it;

I stop at traffic lights and pedestrian crossings, manoeuvring myself safely
into the middle of the lane as I do;

I don't zip up on the nearside (or offside) of stopped traffic, but wait
with it and find an alternative route asap;

I've got more lights than Blackpool Illuminations for night riding (I've
actually got two front lights, set up in a similar manner to dipped car
headlights with one lighting in front and one lighting the kerb);

I've got the biggest, yellowest jacket you ever did see;

I haven't been killed by a driver yet, even though dare I say it an Audi
driver tried last night - you should have seen the telling off his
girlfriend / wife gave him when she looked out of the car window and saw how
close he was to me;

I haven't killed a pedestrian yet, although there's always time, I suppose!

I did bike a lot as a kid, however, I'm actually riding more miles now than
ever I used to and I'm loving nearly every minute of it.  There have been
some close calls at times, but they've been down to sheer stupidity (and,
I'm not afraid to admit, sometimes on my part).

I really don't understand the total vehemence and blinkered attitudes that
have surfaced lately in this group from cyclists and drivers.  Yes, there
will always be a minority of idiots - that's a fact of life.  Again,
accidents can, and do happen.  Mistakes can be made.  We can all misjudge
things at times.

As ever, common sense should rule, Perhaps the amount of driving I do has
given me a bit of roadcraft, because when I'm driving, I look and allow for
cyclists and bikers and when I'm cycling, I consider drivers.

Agreed. I've had some lovely commutes lately, across the hill tops in
watery sunshine, looking at the mist in the valleys below, then
descending into the mist for the last mile. I feel really lucky with
my commute. Virtually no issues with drivers - although I've had three
school buses come rather close in the past few months, one
particularly badly.

I'd love to acknowledge/thank drivers who wait for a safe place to
pass on my rural commute but don't really know how to do it. Typical
situation is me doing 15-20 mph on a bend. The good drivers stay
behind me until the straight, then go past fairly quickly. With the

past, turning to make eye contact isn't really an option and a

Just raise your right hand in a &quot;Thanks&quot; as they do pass you - if you want
to keep your hand on the bars, just raise the right fingers.

I find that if it's not clear to pass but somebody's about to anyway,
holding my right hand out in a clear &quot;Don't overtake&quot; usually works - then,
when it is clear, wave 'em past.

Most cyclists are drivers old boy. Riding the bike that took me over
the Pyrenees, with thirty years urban cycling experience, on a hill
at 5mph with the van doing the same led me to believe that a gesture

Exactly. I also try not to impede drivers who want to overtake where it's
safe. The other day I was aware of a heavy diesel engine chugging behind me
as I was cycling. All the other traffic had overtaken, so why wasn't this
one doing so? A quick glance over my shoulder showed that it was a very wide
load which wouldn't have had the acceleration to overtake and get back onto
its own side of the road again in between gaps in the oncoming traffic.

So I raised my hand to acknowlege that I had sized up the situation, then
put on a spurt of power to get me to the next farm gateway as quickly as
possible, where I pulled off the road ofr a couple of seconds. The driver
flashed his hazard lights a couple of times as he overtook me, by way of a
thank-you.

Conversely I've driven behind bikes which won't move over to let traffic
past: they continue to ride two abreast, with the second one almost on the
white line, so unless there's a gap in the oncoming traffic that allows you
to pull completely onto the wrong side, you're stuck for the duration. Had
the bikes moved into single file and moved closer to the verge (where there
were no drain covers or other hazards) I could have overtaken safely,
leaving enough room between me and the bike and between me and the oncoming
traffic.

Now I ride on fairly major single-carriageway A-roads quite a lot, and IME a
lot of them aren't wide enough for a car to overtake safely when there's
oncoming motor traffic. There's room enough for it to be done without
hitting things, but that isn't necessarily &quot;safely&quot;. Fortunately most people
seem to agree with me.

If the road is narrow enough such that two riders have the rightmost one
almost on the white line, I very much doubt that it's wider than the stuff
I'm riding.

If you could tell us where the road is where you had this problem, I could
check to see if it is indeed wide enough for what you describe.

One of my colleagues was doing her commute cycle on such a road
recently.  An HGV overtook, giving her lots of room.  Unfortunately the
driver was making so sure the bike had space he neglected to check the
road in front so well and head-onned a car coming the other way.  No
serious injury apparently, but the car driver had to be cut out by the
fire brigade...

&gt;&gt; Now I ride on fairly major single-carriageway A-roads quite a lot, and

&gt;&gt; most people seem to agree with me.

&gt; One of my colleagues was doing her commute cycle on such a road
&gt; recently.  An HGV overtook, giving her lots of room.  Unfortunately the
&gt; driver was making so sure the bike had space he neglected to check the
&gt; road in front so well and head-onned a car coming the other way.  No
&gt; serious injury apparently, but the car driver had to be cut out by the

Never had that. However I have seen the cars coming the otherway braking
hard and/or swerving as far left as possible to avoid the person overtaking
me, so I suspect it's only a matter of time (with any luck, that time will
be longer than my lifetime). Mostly when the latter have overestimated the
transparency of the trees/walls/whatever at the side of the road.

I get a lot less of it in the dark though.

Do you keep both hands on your steering wheel when driving?

I speak only for myself here but I know that I am quite capable of
picking an appropriate moment to use just the one hand. Speaking as a
pedestrian, cyclist, driver and one time scooterist, it's only the
scooter that I never succeeded in using single-handed.

I /always/ thank and acknowledge noticeably considerate drivers. I like
to believe it encourages them to continue driving with consideration.

Similarly, I find that it helps to approach bad drivers
non-confrontationally.  More often than not, it results in an apology.

I don't know if anyone else has said this on the thread, but you really
should wear a helmet. I mean that not as a patronising git, but as
someone with the near death experiences to prove it.

Having said that, you summed up the pleasures of cycling very well. It
is a joy to get out on a bike. A car is just a chore. Lots of people
think that a car is freedom on 4 wheels. It isn't. It's a metal prison.

Actually, that's an interesting article. I have always suspected that a
helmet wouldn't help you much in a serious collision, but the two
incidents that I have been involved in (Both low speed with no other

The problem is that if every time a cyclist said what you did, it was
true then the hospitals would be full of dead and seriously head injured
unhelmeted cyclists. The fact that they aren't indicates that either
helmeted cyclists have far more accidents or that helmets don't work.
As indicated in the link I posted, there is evidence that helmeted
cyclists are over seven times as likely to hit their heads in an
accident as unhelmeted ones.

Yes you are entitled to your opinion and to wear what you want on your
head but you are not entitled to try to tell DavidR or anyone else what
to wear (which is what you did), especially when all the evidence is
that wearing a helmet is not a wise course of action.

&gt;&gt; there
&gt;&gt; were no drain covers or other hazards) I could have overtaken safely,
&gt;&gt; leaving enough room between me and the bike and between me and the
&gt;&gt; oncoming
&gt;&gt; traffic.

&gt; If they have to move over to where there might be drain grills, even if
&gt; there aren't any on that particular bit of road, there isn't enough room
&gt; to overtake safely.
">

... but there weren't grills. That's why I made a point of mentioning the
fact.

It was a wide road - the Thame Bypass which is wide enough to get three cars
(one in each direction and one overtaking), so it's easily wide enough for a
car to overtake a single cyclist without even needing to cross the centre
line.

However the two cyclists were riding a long way apart - one close to the
kerb and one near the centre line, with *almost* enough space to drive a car
between them! It looked deliberate - &quot;we're *not* going to let anyone
overtake us&quot; - rather than forced on them by the layout of the road. And,
no, there are no right-turns off that road, so the cyclist wasn't positioned
for turning right.

It looked very selfish to me. When I'm cycling I'm well aware that I'm a
slow vehicle and a pain in the arse to cars, lorries and buses, so I try as
much as possible not to inconvenience them. That may mean temporarily moving
closer than normal to the kerb (as long as I can see that there are no drain
covers) and on a narrow road pulling in if I can to let cars get past. The
incovenience to me for a few seconds is much less than the inconvenience to
the traffic which might be stuck behind for several minutes.

I can remember riding a motor-bike without a helmet in the 1960s. I
appreciate why the law was changed, but that's easy to say because I
was never affected by it.

Similarly, it was only the (1983) change in the law on seatbelts that
made me wear one. It's becoming history now (almost 25 years), but
back then, a passenger who belted up was sometimes seen as lacking
confidence in the driver in a very obvious way, whilst a driver
belting up could be perceived as preparing for an accident and make a
passenger nervous!

Aaaaaarrrgh.

1: No you don't have the experiences to prove it.  You are (in
essence) guessing - presumably guessing about what might have happened
had you not been wearing a helmet.

2: The population level statistics don't support your assertions.
The statistics everywhere on the planet indicate that helmets either
make no difference at all, or possibly very slightly increase the
risk of death or serious injury.  Until you can explain this plausibly
your claim looks shaky.

3: On an individual basis even the manufacturers don't make the claim
you're implying, and you can be sure that they'll do everything they
can to shift product.

4: You _are_ being a patronising git.  I suggest you actually read
some of the detailed examination of the effects of helmet wearing
rates on injury rates, think carefully, then try engaging in this
conversation again.

5: Top tip: don't, under any circumstances, use the figure 85%.
People will snigger, and you will deserve all the ridicule you

I can't either.  In fact it already is regulated in many ways: it's
illegal to enjoy this activity on pavements, without lights at night,
without pedal reflectors, without effective brakes, while moving
contrary to the traffic flow, ... there are a whole raft of rules which
you can find out about by consulting the Highway Code, or go directly to
the source and check out for example the Pedal Cycles (Construction and
Use) Regulations 1983 (Statutory Instrument 1983 No. 1176) and the
Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989

">

I can remember my friend's dad in the 1970s being very scathing about seat
belts, particularly after (he said) *not* wearing a seat belt saved him from
being squished when someone T-boned him and because he wasn't wearing a seat
belt he was able to move across to the passenger seat before it happened -
it was a car with a bench set in the front: couldn't do it in a modern car!

However my dad drummed into my sister and me that we must always wear our
seat belts if we sat in the front. And mum and dad enforced this rigidly: on
one occasion I took my belt off because I didn't like feeling constrained by
it (it was an old-style non-inertia belt) and dad stopped immediately and
read the riot act: &quot;I don't set off again until you put it on or get in the
back seat&quot;.

Mum's car was a different matter: a 1960 Morris Minor with shiny leather
seats, no seat belts and no latch to stop the front seats from tipping up
(it was a 2-door car). On one occasion, I was sitting in the front and my
sister was behind me in the back. Mum had to stop quickly. I braced myself
and I'd probably have been OK except that my sister shot forward, pushing
the backrest of the seat forward and catapulting me out of my seat into the
very hard, unforgiving metal dashboard. Ouch!!! After that, Dad enquired
about getting seat belts fitted but found that the door pillars and floor
pan weren't strong enough to take the mountings.

Compared with my friends at school, I think we were probably fairly rare in
the 70s in wearing seat belts.

The change in the law in 1983, and the later one making it compulsory to
wear seat belts in the back, had no effect on me: I was already always
wearing one. To this day, I do it automatically as soon as I get in a car,
and I feel &quot;undressed&quot; without a seat belt on.

Turning to cycle helmets: I never used to wear one when I had my first bike
in the 70s and 80s, but then I don't remember seeing them in the shops or
seeing anyone wearing on. When I bought my new bike a few years ago and took
up cycling again, I bought one as a matter of course, especially after the
friend who was with me when I bought the bike had recently come off her bike
(fortunately at low speed) and her helmet had protected her. It would never
occur to me not to wear a helmet - indeed one day I set off without putting
mine on, realised that something wasn't right, turned round at the end of
the road and came back for it.

Having said that, the article quoted earlier in this thread makes
interesting reading. Maybe the case for wearing a cycle helmet is less
clear-cut than for a motorbike helmet (which tends to be larger, thicker and
covers the full head/jaw, not just the top of the head), and certainly the
case for wearing a seat belt, with the risk of flying through the windscreen
without one, is pretty clear-cut.

My gut feeling is that any form of protection is better than none, though
maybe the degree of protection is less than I might expect.

I wonder how long it will be before someone suggests that all cyclists
should wear motorbike leathers to protect them from nasty abrasions if they
come off the bike and scrape along the road! As I'm going down a steep hill,
I sometimes think what the road surface could do to me if I were to hit a
pothole and come off. But cycling in a teeshirt and shorts in hot weather is
much cooler than wearing even long trousers and a long-sleeved shirt, never
mind leathers.

That's where common sense breaks down.  The only effect of seat belts,
as found in the Isles Report which the Government of the day
commissioned and then buried without publishing it, was that the net
effect of seat belts was no change in car occupant deaths and an
increase in pedestrian and cyclist deaths.  This is well covered in the
book Risk by UCL professor, John Adams.

The net effect of helmet compulsion where it has been tried has been a
drop in the numbers cycling which is greater than the drop in head
injured cyclists, so an increase in head injury rates.  This is thought
to be partly due to risk compensation as discussed by Adams (Hagel found
helmet wearing child cyclists were riding faster and had more damage to
their bikes in accidents than helmetless ones).

The same effect is seen elsewhere.  For example a study of Munich taxi
drivers found that in otherwise identical cars, those with ABS fitted
drove faster, braked harder and had more accidents than those without -
and drivers were randomised to cars day to day so its not just the more
aggressive drivers choosing ABS.

So gut feeling in this whole area is not a reliable guide to what you
should do.  Having said that, like you I have worn a seat belt from
childhood and I now have no legal choice so the whole matter is moot but
I don't wear a helmet now cycling and I don't want to be forced to by
the numerous attempts to get them made mandatory in law.

Which is why I react strongly to those who say its common sense you
should wear one.
