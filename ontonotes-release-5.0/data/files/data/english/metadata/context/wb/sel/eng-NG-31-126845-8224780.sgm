A Fear of Foreign Investments
By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

WASHINGTON, Aug. 20 - For years, the Bush administration has shrugged
off concerns about the trillions of dollars that the United States
owes to China, Japan and oil-producing countries in the Middle East,
arguing that these debts give no undue leverage to foreign
governments.

But at a time of global financial instability, the administration has
started to worry that foreign governments are increasingly converting
their dollar holdings into investment funds to acquire companies, real
estate, banks and other assets in the United States and elsewhere. The
fear is that these so-called sovereign wealth funds could destabilize
markets or provoke a political backlash.

In response, the Bush administration is pressing the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank to examine the behavior of these
funds, which control up to $2.5 trillion in investments, and develop
possible codes of conduct for them. Among the proposed rules would be
an obligation to disclose investment methods and to avoid interfering
in a host country's politics.

Officially, the United States welcomes all investments, except those
that could compromise national security. &quot;Money is naturally going to
gravitate toward dollar-based assets because of the strength of our
economy,&quot; the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., said in an
interview. &quot;I'd like nothing more than to get more of that money. But
I understand that there's a natural fear that they're going to buy up
America.&quot;

Still, a note of caution can be heard. One of the American concerns is
philosophical. The United States has for years preached the gospel of
privatization, calling on other countries to sell their government-
owned industries.

Now, with sovereign wealth funds, many experts are asking whether
cross-border investment is evolving into cross-border nationalization,
raising the prospect of government interference in free markets, only
this time, in other countries' markets.

Another concern is the sheer size and potential growth of these funds.
Their estimated $2.5 trillion in assets exceeds the sum invested by
the world's hedge funds. Moreover, Morgan Stanley, in a widely cited
study, projects that these investment funds could grow to a staggering
$17.5 trillion in 10 years.

Though sovereign wealth funds do not appear to have played a role in
the recent turmoil in global markets, experts say they could in the
future, in favorable or unfavorable ways - by selling assets abruptly
and precipitating a crisis, or by bailing out funds or companies that
are in trouble.

&quot;They could become either the source of the problem or part of the
solution,&quot; said Edwin M. Truman, senior fellow of the Peterson
Institute for International Economics. &quot;When you have foreign
governments holding stocks and bonds, not just Treasury securities,
you have to ask whether they will be a stabilizing force or a
destabilizing force.&quot;

Mr. Truman said it would be easy to imagine that in a future global
crisis, Mr. Paulson might be calling not just central bankers but also
the directors of sovereign wealth funds. &quot;He may be calling them right
now, for all we know,&quot; he added.

The funds are a product of decades of the United States importing more
than it exports. High energy prices have yielded trillions for oil and
natural gas producers, from Norway and Russia to the Middle East,
while the American thirst for imports of other goods and services has
built up the reserves of China, Japan and other Asian exporters.

The political furor over these funds so far has been limited. Efforts
this year by China and Singapore to buy stakes in Barclays Bank in
Britain, and by Qatar to take over Sainsbury's supermarket chain in
Britain, have caused little stir in Britain.

Neither Dubai's bid for Barney's, the American retailer, nor China's
purchase of nearly a 10 percent stake in Blackstone this year has
produced an outcry in the United States, although there has been some
repercussion in China over the recent losses in the Blackstone
investment.

But in Germany, where there is concern about Russia's buying up
pipelines and energy infrastructure and squeezing Europe for political
gain, Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that purchases by foreign
governments or government-controlled companies pose a risk.

&quot;How do we actually deal with funds in state hands?&quot; Ms. Merkel said
at a news conference in July. &quot;This is a phenomenon which until now
has not existed on such a scale.&quot;

Probably the most political turbulence caused by a sovereign wealth
fund occurred when Temasek Holdings, the state-owned investment branch
of Singapore, purchased a stake in the company owned by the prime
minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra. The deal fed antigovernment
demonstrations that led to his ouster in a coup in 2006.

The worry is that beyond the possibility of foreign funds pushing up
prices on bonds, stocks and real estate, they might exercise
inappropriate control politically or in the private sphere.

Mr. Truman of the Peterson Institute is one of many experts urging the
United States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to
draw up codes of conduct that would keep politics out of investment
decisions and require the funds to share information about the
composition of their portfolios and their investment strategies.

&quot;A government is a different type of animal in the investing world,&quot;
he said. &quot;We call them sovereign wealth funds, but once you're
operating outside your own borders, you're not sovereign in the same
sense.&quot;

Others favor requiring the funds to place their investment decisions
in the hands of nonpolitical managers.

&quot;As Asian countries and petro states get rich, they certainly have the
money to try to exert influence,&quot; said Kenneth S. Rogoff, professor of
politics and public policy at Harvard. &quot;We don't want that influence
to be channeled in a reckless way. There has to be transparency in
company governance and financial governance to protect against it.&quot;

Mr. Paulson and the deputy Treasury secretary, Robert M. Kimmitt, have
traveled to China, Russia and the Persian Gulf to urge top financial
officials to adopt greater disclosure of their investment practices
and to ban government subsidies or other forms of incentives for their
overseas investment activities.

The administration is also telling these countries they must open
their properties to American investments if they want to invest in the
United States.

In an interview, Mr. Kimmitt said sovereign funds seemed to be acting
on sound financial practices and not political motivations, at least
so far. &quot;When I was in China and Russia, I was struck by the degree to
which, although I was talking to government officials, it was like
talking to asset managers,&quot; he said.

Sovereign wealth funds have been around for decades. The Kuwait
General Reserve Fund was established in 1960. The Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority was established in the 1970s and today has investments
totaling roughly $800 billion, making it the world's largest such
fund.

With $300 billion in its fund, Norway is seen by many financial
experts as a model for disclosure of portfolio strategy, holdings and
methods. But it is also unabashedly political, recently withdrawing
its investment in Wal-Mart, citing accusations that the company has
violated child-labor laws and scuttled efforts by employees to
unionize.

But China and Middle East countries have a long way to go before they
are as transparent as Norway is. Some experts wonder what would happen
if China took over an American pharmaceutical company and pressed for
changes in prescription drug programs. Likewise, what would the
reaction be if an Arab government demanded a bailout or tax break for
its company in return for supporting peace talks in Iraq or Israel?

&quot;If these funds buy into a big Fidelity mutual, they make standard
kinds of investments that the Yale endowment makes,&quot; said Lawrence H.
Summers, the economist who served as Treasury secretary and president
of Harvard. &quot;But if they make more direct investments, they become
meaningful actors in the economy, and that raises many more
questions.&quot;

President Bush recently signed a bill to streamline the process of
screening and possibly rejecting purchases of American companies by
foreigners on national security grounds. But these account for only
about 10 percent of such purchases, the Treasury Department says.

A huge outcry resulted when a company controlled by Dubai tried to
take over the management of several ports in the United States and
when a Chinese-government-owned oil company sought to buy Unocal,
suggesting that Americans might not accept increasing amounts of
foreign government purchases.

In both cases, the concern of American politicians was that national
security assets were at stake. But in the 1980s, national security was
not at risk when Americans recoiled over Japanese companies' purchases
of high-profile properties like movie studios and Rockefeller Center.

&quot;The Bush administration is right to look at this phenomenon, not with
alarm but some attention,&quot; said Stephen Jen of Morgan Stanley. &quot;What
needs to be more transparent is the strategy and governance of these
funds, so you don't suspect of them some dark geopolitical strategy in
their investments.&quot;
