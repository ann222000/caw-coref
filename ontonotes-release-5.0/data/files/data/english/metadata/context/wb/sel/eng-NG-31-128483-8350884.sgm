Alliance can't hide its anti-China intent

By GWYNNE DYER
LONDON - When you are creating a military alliance aimed at a third
party, it's always best to swear that you are doing no such thing, and
that you simply share common values with your prospective allies.

Addressing the Indian Parliament last Wednesday, Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe said, &quot;This partnership is an association in which
we share fundamental values such as freedom, democracy and respect for
basic human rights as well as strategic interests.&quot;

Notice how &quot;strategic interests&quot; was just tacked on at the end: Sort
of &quot;Oh, yeah, and that too, if anybody cares.&quot; That's how the game is
played, and Abe didn't mention China at all.

But by defining this new partnership as an association of democracies,
he neatly excluded China from the list of possible members: &quot;By Japan
and India coming together in this way, this 'broader Asia' will evolve
into an immense network spanning the entirety of the Pacific Ocean,
incorporating the United States of America and Australia.&quot;

But not China. And it is not at all a coincidence that all the major
members of this evolving alliance see China as a potential military
threat.

In the U.S., according to recent public opinion polls, more than 50
percent of respondents said they saw China as their country's enemy.
That doesn't mean it's true, but this is what Americans often hear
because, like every country, the U.S. has a caste of military and
civilian &quot;analysts&quot; whose main function is to come up with plausible
future threats to justify the existing pattern of military
expenditures.

Similar cottage industries exist in Japan and Australia, and one is
rapidly emerging in India. Even in China there are soldiers and
academics who make a career out of talking up the &quot;American threat,&quot;
but they are generally ignored and sometimes simply told to shut up by
the Chinese regime, which doesn't want to add fuel to the flames that
are already burning overseas. Whereas in the U.S., Japan, Australia
and increasingly India, these people have the bit between their teeth.

Shinzo Abe is the most militaristic Japanese leader since World War
II, but this grand alliance is not his idea. It is an American
initiative that was gestating even under President Bill Clinton in the
late 1990s, but it really took off after President George W. Bush took
office in early 2001.

Since Japan and Australia were already U.S. allies, the main task was
to bring India, the emerging Asian giant with the potential to rival
China, into the same alliance structure. That was not an easy task,
since India had been nonaligned ever since its independence in 1947.

The U.S. imposed sanctions against India in response to its nuclear
weapons tests in 1998, and U.S. legislation banned any trade in
nuclear fuel or equipment with countries (like India) that refused to
sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It took a huge American
diplomatic effort abroad and the expenditure of a lot of the Bush
administration's political capital at home to get around those
obstacles, but by this year the job was done.

In 2005 the U.S. agreed to lift the ban on U.S. nuclear exports to
India, and India signed up to a military cooperation agreement that
gives it access to the next generation of American weapons and commits
it to joint military exercises with U.S. forces. India gets U.S.
ballistic missile defense, and there are presumably secret clauses
about cooperation on intelligence matters and maybe even on strategic
planning.

Last year, the U.S. Congress obediently changed the law to give India
access to American nuclear exports. It may not technically be an
alliance, but it's definitely not just a sewing circle. If you need
proof, just look at the White House's reaction when opponents of the
alliance in the Indian Parliament tried to kill it.

The new U.S. law says that American nuclear aid to India will be cut
off if the Indians test another nuclear weapon. Legislators in the
Indian Parliament who dislike the alliance seized on this clause as a
reason to reject the deal, claiming that it infringes on Indian
sovereignty.

Washington wants this alliance so much that it has tied itself in
knots to meet the objections of Indian politicians. Last month Bush
went well beyond what the U.S. Congress had authorized, offering to
help India set up a nuclear fuel repository so it can stockpile
uranium against any interruption in the American supply, and even
promising to help India to find other sources of nuclear fuel if
Congress does cut off the supply (presumably after another Indian
nuclear test).

These are not the actions of an administration that is lukewarm about
the alliance with India. In fact, India is the keystone of the new
U.S. strategy in Asia, and Washington will do almost anything to keep
it in place.

As for Abe's visit to New Delhi, it is part of the tidying-up process
where America's existing allies in the region also expand their direct
defense ties with the new Indian ally. The Australians have been at it
too, as have various South-East Asian countries.

These people are not nearly as clever as they think they are. If they
go on like this, they will probably end up with a new Cold War in
Asia.

I think the USA is petrified by the fact that China will very soon be
the world superpower

The USA is rooted big time , and will try and get a few allies to lean
on China for a while , but the yanks will get used to being a third
world basket case in a few years

Nobody can stop China now , and China has enough to do at home before
it worries about other countries phobias

Not a bad analysis.

She makes one serious error of fact - that Australia has a military interest
in containing China. She bundles us up into the group comprising the US,
Japan and India. Our interest is entirely different - we want China as a
customer. The others see China as a threat; we see it as an opportunity.
This is an important dynamic of the group.

What she also forgets, as do most left wing journalists, is that the Western
democracies actually ended up winning the Cold War. However bad Russia is
now, its way better now than it was under Breschnev. It actually did them
good as well.

The Chinese economy may be going gangbusters, but there are still massive
violations of human rights. Maybe the US, Japan, Australia, India alliance
can do for China what the US Western Europe alliance did for Eastern Europe.

It is funny Japan invoke the fundamental value.

Is Japan really a democracy? What kind of demcoracy is that? If
democracy is the opposite of one party dictatorship. Japan is hardly a
democracy, the LDP is only out of power for 10 months after the
Liberal and the Democratic paty had joined at 1952.

If a country observe the form of western demcoracy yet the results are
different. One has to wonder whether the Japanese people are having
fundamentally different value in comparison with the west. The same
about India. The caste value system is still part of the cultural
value fabric.

Nah. The alliance is not about fundamental values. It is about
America and the U.S. trying to contain China. I hope India and
Austrilia think differently.

According to Mr Haha's rationale of chinese politics
in hk.politics, our motherland just finished a military
exercise with countries from the Shanghai Treaty
Organization - a quasi-military alliance founded by
our motherland.

According to him, everything our motherland does,
including forming a military alliance is for peace and
its intent should be beyond dispute, yet any other
neighboring countries forming a similar alliance is for
war against China.

I think you buy this rationale whole heartedly.

&gt; &gt; weapons tests in 1998, and U.S. legislation banned any trade in
&gt; &gt; nuclear fuel or equipment with countries (like India) that refused to
&gt; &gt; sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It took a huge American
&gt; &gt; diplomatic effort abroad and the expenditure of a lot of the Bush
&gt; &gt; administration's political capital at home to get around those
&gt; &gt; obstacles, but by this year the job was done.

&gt; &gt; In 2005 the U.S. agreed to lift the ban on U.S. nuclear exports to
&gt; &gt; India, and India signed up to a military cooperation agreement that
&gt; &gt; gives it access to the next generation of American weapons and commits
&gt; &gt; it to joint military exercises with U.S. forces. India gets U.S.
&gt; &gt; ballistic missile defense, and there are presumably secret clauses
&gt; &gt; about cooperation on intelligence matters and maybe even on strategic
&gt; &gt; planning.

&gt; &gt; Last year, the U.S. Congress obediently changed the law to give India
&gt; &gt; access to American nuclear exports. It may not technically be an
&gt; &gt; alliance, but it's definitely not just a sewing circle. If you need
&gt; &gt; proof, just look at the White House's reaction when opponents of the
&gt; &gt; alliance in the Indian Parliament tried to kill it.

&gt; &gt; The new U.S. law says that American nuclear aid to India will be cut
&gt; &gt; off if the Indians test another nuclear weapon. Legislators in the
&gt; &gt; Indian Parliament who dislike the alliance seized on this clause as a
&gt; &gt; reason to reject the deal, claiming that it infringes on Indian
&gt; &gt; sovereignty.

&gt; &gt; Washington wants this alliance so much that it has tied itself in
&gt; &gt; knots to meet the objections of Indian politicians. Last month Bush
&gt; &gt; went well beyond what the U.S. Congress had authorized, offering to
&gt; &gt; help India set up a nuclear fuel repository so it can stockpile
&gt; &gt; uranium against any interruption in the American supply, and even
&gt; &gt; promising to help India to find other sources of nuclear fuel if
&gt; &gt; Congress does cut off the supply (presumably after another Indian
&gt; &gt; nuclear test).

&gt; &gt; These are not the actions of an administration that is lukewarm about
&gt; &gt; the alliance with India. In fact, India is the keystone of the new
&gt; &gt; U.S. strategy in Asia, and Washington will do almost anything to keep
&gt; &gt; it in place.

&gt; &gt; As for Abe's visit to New Delhi, it is part of the tidying-up process
&gt; &gt; where America's existing allies in the region also expand their direct
&gt; &gt; defense ties with the new Indian ally. The Australians have been at it
&gt; &gt; too, as have various South-East Asian countries.

&gt; &gt; These people are not nearly as clever as they think they are. If they
&gt; &gt; go on like this, they will probably end up with a new Cold War in
&gt; &gt; Asia.

The beauty of the Anglo-Saxon mind and somewhat to a similar extent
the Europid mind is the ability to forget and to tunnel vision.

The beauty of the internet is that it doesn't allow forgetting and is
wide open.

I think Mr. Webb lives in a schizophrenic world. On the internet he is
continually reminded of White Australia's and Anglo-Saxon crimes
against humanity. Off the net he blissfully parties with his like-
minded cohorts!

I recommend the Chinese let loose and learn to party like the Aussies.
After all, you guys outnumber them like 1000 to 1, shake some Chinese
Australia's way and after awhile there won't be any more Australians
who will need to be reminded.

Chinese got a good name here for their restaurants, my Chinese scooter

However we have heard that some US republicans _do_ have sex with animals,
and that China already controls some percentage of the US - hey
I think I just proved your case -.

Imperialism, is not alien to anybody I think, Japan did it, US does it,
China does it, fight for resources, China is buying up the world.
No, Taiwan got economically strong without China mainland, China is jealous
perhaps.
And Tibet was taken by force..
And you will be, for sure, if you are representative of Chinese IQ.

So just for the record, China has attacked and invaded other countries
(Tibet), China has stationed troops in another country to support its
national interest (North Korea), and China has attacked US forces whereas
the US has not attacked Chinese forces.

These were your questions; they are the answers.

Like I said, perhaps you should learn a little about Chinese history - or at
least do a little Googling - before asking basic questions about Chinese
history.

Hope this helps

Taiwan has never been part of China. Prior to 1945 it was part of Japan.
After that it was settled by forces hostile to China.

Tibet was invaded by China in 1950. Prior to that it had been an independent
nation.

China is not buying up the world. Rather, China is sourcing to supply

You don't know much about Chinese history.
At the end of the Qing dynasty, all provinces including Tiebt,
declared independence from the then very corrupted Qing central
government once
the revolution began. Some of the these provinces were later dominated
by
equally corrupted warlords. Many of them were unified by force. But
these provinces including Tibet were not really independent countries.
And
reunifying the country was not invading.

Nothing  New,

the  Ango-Yankee  Echelon  Radar defence  system  was
established  in order
to  fight against the Chinese  military a  long  time ago,
since the beginning of the  Cold  war .

the Radar in Geraldine in Australia was  aimed at China  for a  very
long  tiee already .

&gt; Alliance can't hide its anti-China intent

&gt; By GWYNNE DYER
&gt; LONDON - When you are creating a military alliance aimed at a third
&gt; party, it's always best to swear that you are doing no such thing, and
&gt; that you simply share common values with your prospective allies.

&gt; Addressing the Indian Parliament last Wednesday, Japanese Prime
&gt; Minister Shinzo Abe said, &quot;This partnership is an association in which
&gt; we share fundamental values such as freedom, democracy and respect for
&gt; basic human rights as well as strategic interests.&quot;

&gt; Notice how &quot;strategic interests&quot; was just tacked on at the end: Sort
&gt; of &quot;Oh, yeah, and that too, if anybody cares.&quot; That's how the game is
&gt; played, and Abe didn't mention China at all.

&gt; But by defining this new partnership as an association of democracies,
&gt; he neatly excluded China from the list of possible members: &quot;By Japan
&gt; and India coming together in this way, this 'broader Asia' will evolve
&gt; into an immense network spanning the entirety of the Pacific Ocean,
&gt; incorporating the United States of America and Australia.&quot;

&gt; But not China. And it is not at all a coincidence that all the major
&gt; members of this evolving alliance see China as a potential military
&gt; threat.

&gt; In the U.S., according to recent public opinion polls, more than 50
&gt; percent of respondents said they saw China as their country's enemy.
&gt; That doesn't mean it's true, but this is what Americans often hear
&gt; because, like every country, the U.S. has a caste of military and
&gt; civilian &quot;analysts&quot; whose main function is to come up with plausible
&gt; future threats to justify the existing pattern of military
&gt; expenditures.

&gt; Similar cottage industries exist in Japan and Australia, and one is
&gt; rapidly emerging in India. Even in China there are soldiers and
&gt; academics who make a career out of talking up the &quot;American threat,&quot;
&gt; but they are generally ignored and sometimes simply told to shut up by
&gt; the Chinese regime, which doesn't want to add fuel to the flames that
&gt; are already burning overseas. Whereas in the U.S., Japan, Australia
&gt; and increasingly India, these people have the bit between their teeth.

&gt; Shinzo Abe is the most militaristic Japanese leader since World War
&gt; II, but this grand alliance is not his idea. It is an American
&gt; initiative that was gestating even under President Bill Clinton in the
&gt; late 1990s, but it really took off after President George W. Bush took
&gt; office in early 2001.

&gt; Since Japan and Australia were already U.S. allies, the main task was
&gt; to bring India, the emerging Asian giant with the potential to rival
&gt; China, into the same alliance structure. That was not an easy task,
&gt; since India had been nonaligned ever since its independence in 1947.

&gt; The U.S. imposed sanctions against India in response to its nuclear
&gt; weapons tests in 1998, and U.S. legislation banned any trade in
&gt; nuclear fuel or equipment with countries (like India) that refused to
&gt; sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It took a huge American
&gt; diplomatic effort abroad and the expenditure of a lot of the Bush
&gt; administration's political capital at home to get around those
&gt; obstacles, but by this year the job was done.

&gt; In 2005 the U.S. agreed to lift the ban on U.S. nuclear exports to
&gt; India, and India signed up to a military cooperation agreement that
&gt; gives it access to the next generation of American weapons and commits
&gt; it to joint military exercises with U.S. forces. India gets U.S.
&gt; ballistic missile defense, and there are presumably secret clauses
&gt; about cooperation on intelligence matters and maybe even on strategic
&gt; planning.

&gt; Last year, the U.S. Congress obediently changed the law to give India
&gt; access to American nuclear exports. It may not technically be an
&gt; alliance, but it's definitely not just a sewing circle. If you need
&gt; proof, just look at the White House's reaction when opponents of the
&gt; alliance in the Indian Parliament tried to kill it.

&gt; The new U.S. law says that American nuclear aid to India will be cut
&gt; off if the Indians test another nuclear weapon. Legislators in the
&gt; Indian Parliament who dislike the alliance seized on this clause as a
&gt; reason to reject the deal, claiming that it infringes on Indian
&gt; sovereignty.

&gt; Washington wants this alliance so much that it has tied itself in
&gt; knots to meet the objections of Indian politicians. Last month Bush
&gt; went well beyond what the U.S. Congress had authorized, offering to
&gt; help India set up a nuclear fuel repository so it can stockpile
&gt; uranium against any interruption in the American supply, and even
&gt; promising to help India to find other sources of nuclear fuel if
&gt; Congress does cut off the supply (presumably after another Indian
&gt; nuclear test).

&gt; These are not the actions of an administration that is lukewarm about
&gt; the alliance with India. In fact, India is the keystone of the new
&gt; U.S. strategy in Asia, and Washington will do almost anything to keep
&gt; it in place.

&gt; As for Abe's visit to New Delhi, it is part of the tidying-up process
&gt; where America's existing allies in the region also expand their direct
&gt; defense ties with the new Indian ally. The Australians have been at it
&gt; too, as have various South-East Asian countries.

&gt; These people are not nearly as clever as they think they are. If they
&gt; go on like this, they will probably end up with a new Cold War in
&gt; Asia.

really idiot !!! when did China send military abroad to fight against
natives or to help corrupt government ?? did China send terrorists
half way round globe to bomb American buildings ? has China stationed
troops in other countries to keep Chinese interests ?? answer me,
stupid idiot !!!!!!!!!
-----------

The answers are yes, no, and yes. I would have thought that was pretty
obvious.

The question was NOT about the European settlement of Australia, or China's
geo-political aspirations, or anything other topic you have raised above.

Can't you read?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;natives or to help corrupt government ??

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ever heard of the Dalailama?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; How about the thread to Taiwan?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Right or wrong, that should answer your question.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So, you've heard of the Dalai Lama, have you? So, you know that he is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; being used by China's enemies to try and divide the China to cause
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; instability, the way they are trying to separate Taiwan from China.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Tibet and Taiwan were never, aren't, and will never be independent
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; countries.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Taiwan has never been part of China. Prior to 1945 it was part of Japan.
&gt; &gt;&gt; After that it was settled by forces hostile to China.

&gt; &gt; Tell us where exactely is the territory of the Republic of China? Also
&gt; &gt; don't forget both Cairo and Potsdam have included Taiwan as Chinese
&gt; &gt; territory Japan annexed thru unequal treaties that must be returned.

&gt; &gt; How convienent of you to forget Taiwan became part of China at the end
&gt; &gt; of Ming Dynasty, and have been administered by Qing (the Ryukyu
&gt; &gt; Kingdom was endowed by Qing courts.)

&gt; &gt; Learn some history.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Tibet was invaded by China in 1950. Prior to that it had been an
&gt; &gt;&gt; independent
&gt; &gt;&gt; nation.

&gt; &gt; How convienent of you to forget Tibet became part of China 700 years
&gt; &gt; ago (there are historical documentations), and it was British colonial
&gt; &gt; invasion that took it away from China. China had the guns to take it
&gt; &gt; back 50 years, and you are bitching about invasion?

&gt; &gt; Better yet, look at the blood soaked grounds we are standing on - who
&gt; &gt; did we invade, and are we going to decimate our own &quot;established
&gt; &gt; statehood&quot;? Hypocrit.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;They are parts of China, and if you don't like it, you can
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; go fuck a duck.

I noticed you've also dropped the Tibet claim, after the Native

BS, the colonialist certainly believed in China's sovereignty to force
her to sing all those unequal treaty to demand concession and sphere
of influence.

How convienent for you to forget that to justify your claim. The fact
is Taiwan's status as part of China is demonstrated by effective
administration at end of Ming Dynasty by Ming general. King of Ryukyu
was later granted title under Qing court.

I guess people like you are blameless - we grew up using the same
rationale to justifiy our own invasion and genocide of Native
Americans. The NA didn't have a state either, never mind they smoked
peace pipe to formalize treaties, erected totems as historical
records, and marked national and geographic boundry with stories and
travel songs.

&gt; &gt; Ohh, so you agree that my answers are correct?

&gt; &gt; &gt;Here's what you wrote, which I responded to:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Taiwan has never been part of China. Prior to 1945 it was part of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Japan. After that it was settled by forces hostile to China.&quot;

&gt; &gt; The last time Taiwan had any governance connection with China, the concept
&gt; &gt; of a sovereign State didn't exist.

&gt; BS, the colonialist certainly believed in China's sovereignty to force
&gt; her to sing all those unequal treaty to demand concession and sphere
&gt; of influence.

&gt; How convienent for you to forget that to justify your claim. The fact
&gt; is Taiwan's status as part of China is demonstrated by effective
&gt; administration at end of Ming Dynasty by Ming general. King of Ryukyu
&gt; was later granted title under Qing court.

&gt; I guess people like you are blameless - we grew up using the same
&gt; rationale to justifiy our own invasion and genocide of Native
&gt; Americans. The NA didn't have a state either, never mind they smoked
&gt; peace pipe to formalize treaties, erected totems as historical
&gt; records, and marked national and geographic boundry with stories and
&gt; travel songs.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What, already abandoning your claim about Taiwan?

&gt; &gt; No, somebody else dropped that out.

&gt; &gt; &gt;I don't care what
&gt; &gt; &gt; the question is, I am responding to your historically inaccurate, self-
&gt; &gt; &gt; righteous, hypocritical BS.

&gt; &gt; So you agree with my answers to the questions?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I noticed you've also dropped the Tibet claim, after the Native
&gt; &gt; &gt; American - our own Tibet, was pointed out to you.

&gt; &gt; Not me.

&gt; It is you. In my reply your quote and my reply is still there:

&gt; &quot;&gt; Tibet was invaded by China in 1950. Prior to that it had been an
&gt; independent

&gt; &gt; nation.

&gt; How convienent of you to forget Tibet became part of China 700 years
&gt; ago (there are historical documentations), and it was British
&gt; colonial
&gt; invasion that took it away from China. China had the guns to take it
&gt; back 50 years, and you are bitching about invasion?

&gt; Better yet, look at the blood soaked grounds we are standing on - who
&gt; did we invade, and are we going to decimate our own &quot;established
&gt; statehood&quot;? Hypocrit.&quot;

&gt; But in your post ending with &quot;idiot.&quot;, you dropped it, idiot.

&gt; &gt; You must have confused me with somebody else. Perhaps even yourself.
&gt; &gt; You can backtrack through the thread yourself to see where you screwed up,
&gt; &gt; if you like.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ------------
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; really idiot !!! when did China send military abroad to fight against
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; natives or to help corrupt government ?? did China send terrorists
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; half way round globe to bomb American buildings ? has China stationed
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; troops in other countries to keep Chinese interests ?? answer me,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; stupid idiot !!!!!!!!!
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; -----------

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The answers are yes, no, and yes. I would have thought that was pretty
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; obvious.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The question was NOT about the European settlement of Australia, or
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; China's
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; geo-political aspirations, or anything other topic you have raised above.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Can't you read?

Sorry, I thought you were arguing against the proposition that China had
used military forces abroad.

Now I see that you are providing another example, the invasion and
subjugation of Taiwan under Ming generals.

I was actually just looking at examples under the present communist regime;
if you go far enough back in history you will doubtless find many other
examples (as you have done).

the world to air their views and discuss topics which are of interest to

&gt; &gt;&gt; Right or wrong, that should answer your question.

&gt; &gt;So, you've heard of the Dalai Lama, have you? So, you know that he is
&gt; &gt;being used by China's enemies to try and divide the China to cause
&gt; &gt;instability, the way they are trying to separate Taiwan from China.
&gt; &gt;Tibet and Taiwan were never, aren't, and will never be independent
&gt; &gt;countries. They are parts of China, and if you don't like it, you can
&gt; &gt;go fuck a duck.

&gt; let's just hope not all Chinese are little screamers and animal sexers
&gt; as you seem to be.
&gt; Chinese got a good name here for their restaurants, my Chinese scooter
&gt; is still working, but I do not think I want to be ruled by little yellow
&gt; brainless blurpers like you.
&gt; However we have heard that some US republicans _do_ have sex with animals,
&gt; and that China already controls some percentage of the US - hey
&gt; I think I just proved your case -.

&gt; Imperialism, is not alien to anybody I think, Japan did it, US does it,
&gt; China does it, fight for resources, China is buying up the world.
&gt; No, Taiwan got economically strong without China mainland, China is jealous
&gt; perhaps.
&gt; And Tibet was taken by force..
&gt; And you will be, for sure, if you are representative of Chinese IQ.

You &quot;hope&quot; ? Well, fuck a duck! We have an ignoramus trying to tout

CL , who  told  you  that  Tibet  became a  part of  China  700 years
ago ?

your  grandfather ?

700 years  ago, 1300 AD,
China was  still  ruled  by the  Mongols.

the Mongols ruled  China  until  1350 AD  .

there was  no China  700 years  ago,
700  years  ago, there was  only the  Mongol Yuan  Dynasty  in China.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here are the questions:

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't give a hoot.

&gt; &gt; Ohh, so you agree that my answers are correct?

&gt; &gt; &gt;Here's what you wrote, which I responded to:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Taiwan has never been part of China. Prior to 1945 it was part of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Japan. After that it was settled by forces hostile to China.&quot;

&gt; &gt; The last time Taiwan had any governance connection with China, the concept
&gt; &gt; of a sovereign State didn't exist.

&gt; BS, the colonialist certainly believed in China's sovereignty to force
&gt; her to sing all those unequal treaty to demand concession and sphere
&gt; of influence.

&gt; How convienent for you to forget that to justify your claim. The fact
&gt; is Taiwan's status as part of China is demonstrated by effective
&gt; administration at end of Ming Dynasty by Ming general. King of Ryukyu
&gt; was later granted title under Qing court.

&gt; I guess people like you are blameless - we grew up using the same
&gt; rationale to justifiy our own invasion and genocide of Native
&gt; Americans. The NA didn't have a state either, never mind they smoked
&gt; peace pipe to formalize treaties, erected totems as historical
&gt; records, and marked national and geographic boundry with stories and
&gt; travel songs.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What, already abandoning your claim about Taiwan?

&gt; &gt; No, somebody else dropped that out.

&gt; &gt; &gt;I don't care what
&gt; &gt; &gt; the question is, I am responding to your historically inaccurate, self-
&gt; &gt; &gt; righteous, hypocritical BS.

&gt; &gt; So you agree with my answers to the questions?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I noticed you've also dropped the Tibet claim, after the Native
&gt; &gt; &gt; American - our own Tibet, was pointed out to you.

&gt; &gt; Not me.

&gt; It is you. In my reply your quote and my reply is still there:

&gt; &quot;&gt; Tibet was invaded by China in 1950. Prior to that it had been an
&gt; independent

&gt; &gt; nation.

&gt; How convienent of you to forget Tibet became part of China 700 years

&gt; &gt; You must have confused me with somebody else. Perhaps even yourself.
&gt; &gt; You can backtrack through the thread yourself to see where you screwed up,
&gt; &gt; if you like.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ------------
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; really idiot !!! when did China send military abroad to fight against
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; natives or to help corrupt government ?? did China send terrorists
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; half way round globe to bomb American buildings ? has China stationed
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; troops in other countries to keep Chinese interests ?? answer me,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; stupid idiot !!!!!!!!!
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; -----------

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The answers are yes, no, and yes. I would have thought that was pretty
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; obvious.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The question was NOT about the European settlement of Australia, or
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; China's
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; geo-political aspirations, or anything other topic you have raised above.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Can't you read?

Look, in your worldview you can say that the first human was Chinese,
and merely uniting the Chinese world is what is happening now.

What I am trying to point out is, that if you go back far enough in history,
depending on who you think you are, you can make any claim you like.

If humanity originated in Africa (perhaps, that is one theory), then
[you could claim] China is part of Africa...

What we do not need is like Hitler Jugend echoed Hitlers world ideas
like Third Reich (Yes I get fed up with all the anisemitic posts in us.polictis),
Chinese were killing and murdering in the name of chairman Mao, destroying
much of Chinese cultural heritage, WE DO NOT NEED GOVERNMENT POLICY REPEATING
PARROTS, what we _do_ need is people who can think for themselves.

GWBush policies are the same, he addresses the masses who do _not_ think,
not the intelligentsia.
He burns 10 soldiers a day to keep oil prices up, and plunders his own country
by creating the biggest national deficit ever.
All because people repeat his shit and dance to it.

If you look at it from the opposite side, US owns China a lot of money.
IF I was evil and, by (some mishap or grace), got elected president of the US
after  GWB, I _could_ just decide to call captain Lucky Luke of submarine Jolly Jumper
and give the order to nuke every Chinese city with more then 1 M inhabitants, declare the
Chinese owned debt void, .
The result would be no more cheap imports, no more deficit, more work for the
US car industry, pretty good for the US.
Of course we would lock up anybody who had investments in China too.

So, as long as China does not have hydrogen bombs to spare, in quantity, and the means
to deliver these, I would be a bit humble and play nice, and forget about imperialism,
like grabbing Taiwan.

Of course you Chinese work hard to get a working H bomb, and it seems logical the US needs
to strike before that.

China did not invade Korea. Get your historical facts right.
China sent troops into North Korea only after General MacArthur
ordered American troops acroos the Yalu River into China in his
attempt to invade China in favour of Chiang Kai Shek. At the end of
the Korean War, China withdrew all her troops from North Korea. As for
Tibet, it is part of China. Allowing Tibet to be separated from China
is not in the national interest of China, nor of any other nation, had
that nation been in China's position.

You guys are talking non-sense.  The name of the game is called &quot;Power
grows out of the barrel of the gun&quot;.  If you have the power, you can
change the national boundary anytime you want.  National boundaries
are being changed continuously since time memorial.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;really idiot !!! when did China send military abroad to fight
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;against
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;natives or to help corrupt government ??

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ever heard of the Dalailama?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; How about the thread to Taiwan?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Right or wrong, that should answer your question.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So, you've heard of the Dalai Lama, have you? So, you know that he
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; being used by China's enemies to try and divide the China to cause
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; instability, the way they are trying to separate Taiwan from China.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Tibet and Taiwan were never, aren't, and will never be independent
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; countries.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Taiwan has never been part of China. Prior to 1945 it was part of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Japan.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; After that it was settled by forces hostile to China.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Tell us where exactely is the territory of the Republic of China? Also
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; don't forget both Cairo and Potsdam have included Taiwan as Chinese
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; territory Japan annexed thru unequal treaties that must be returned.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How convienent of you to forget Taiwan became part of China at the end
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of Ming Dynasty, and have been administered by Qing (the Ryukyu
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kingdom was endowed by Qing courts.)

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Learn some history.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Tibet was invaded by China in 1950. Prior to that it had been an
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; independent
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; nation.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How convienent of you to forget Tibet became part of China 700 years
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ago (there are historical documentations), and it was British colonial
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; invasion that took it away from China. China had the guns to take it
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; back 50 years, and you are bitching about invasion?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Better yet, look at the blood soaked grounds we are standing on - who
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; did we invade, and are we going to decimate our own &quot;established
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; statehood&quot;? Hypocrit.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;They are parts of China, and if you don't like it, you can
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; go fuck a duck.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Perhaps doing some reading may be more productive than having sex with
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; duck.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here are the questions:

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't give a hoot.

&gt; &gt; Ohh, so you agree that my answers are correct?

&gt; &gt; &gt;Here's what you wrote, which I responded to:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Taiwan has never been part of China. Prior to 1945 it was part of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Japan. After that it was settled by forces hostile to China.&quot;

&gt; &gt; The last time Taiwan had any governance connection with China, the concept
&gt; &gt; of a sovereign State didn't exist.

&gt; BS, the colonialist certainly believed in China's sovereignty to force
&gt; her to sing all those unequal treaty to demand concession and sphere
&gt; of influence.

&gt; How convienent for you to forget that to justify your claim. The fact
&gt; is Taiwan's status as part of China is demonstrated by effective
&gt; administration at end of Ming Dynasty by Ming general. King of Ryukyu
&gt; was later granted title under Qing court.

&gt; I guess people like you are blameless - we grew up using the same
&gt; rationale to justifiy our own invasion and genocide of Native
&gt; Americans. The NA didn't have a state either, never mind they smoked
&gt; peace pipe to formalize treaties, erected totems as historical
&gt; records, and marked national and geographic boundry with stories and
&gt; travel songs.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What, already abandoning your claim about Taiwan?

&gt; &gt; No, somebody else dropped that out.

&gt; &gt; &gt;I don't care what
&gt; &gt; &gt; the question is, I am responding to your historically inaccurate, self-
&gt; &gt; &gt; righteous, hypocritical BS.

&gt; &gt; So you agree with my answers to the questions?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I noticed you've also dropped the Tibet claim, after the Native
&gt; &gt; &gt; American - our own Tibet, was pointed out to you.

&gt; &gt; Not me.

&gt; It is you. In my reply your quote and my reply is still there:

&gt; &quot;&gt; Tibet was invaded by China in 1950. Prior to that it had been an
&gt; independent

&gt; &gt; nation.

&gt; How convienent of you to forget Tibet became part of China 700 years
&gt; ago (there are historical documentations), and it was British
&gt; colonial
&gt; invasion that took it away from China. China had the guns to take it
&gt; back 50 years, and you are bitching about invasion?

&gt; Better yet, look at the blood soaked grounds we are standing on - who
&gt; did we invade, and are we going to decimate our own &quot;established
&gt; statehood&quot;? Hypocrit.&quot;

&gt; But in your post ending with &quot;idiot.&quot;, you dropped it, idiot.

&gt; &gt; You must have confused me with somebody else. Perhaps even yourself.
&gt; &gt; You can backtrack through the thread yourself to see where you screwed up,
&gt; &gt; if you like.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ------------
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; really idiot !!! when did China send military abroad to fight against
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; natives or to help corrupt government ?? did China send terrorists
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; half way round globe to bomb American buildings ? has China stationed
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; troops in other countries to keep Chinese interests ?? answer me,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; stupid idiot !!!!!!!!!
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; -----------

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The answers are yes, no, and yes. I would have thought that was pretty
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; obvious.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The question was NOT about the European settlement of Australia, or
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; China's
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; geo-political aspirations, or anything other topic you have raised above.
