RECLAMATION.

mine. HA. Take that Joss (well, no, not really: Jonah is shiny and I wanna keep
him).

Comments: It's time these blue bastards learned who they're dealing with.

Links: I've been busy. I started these as a quick reference for myself, but
others wanted them, too. So they're here if you want them. They'll be updated

Inara sat on the bed and looked at the small pistol in her hand. It was silver,
ornate, and had been chosen, like everything else in her life, for its beauty.
That and the way it was easily concealed within her robes.

It had been a very long time since she had actually used it.

Her fingers traced the engravings on the handle. It surprised her how readily
they had all assumed she would load up and join them. Of course, there wasn't
much she wouldn't do for Kaylee, or River for that matter. And it wasn't like
she hadn't been joining them on their jobs lately, she had helped with the
Lassiter, had stood up to Rance Burgess with Nandi. It was just that they had
always, or more precisely Mal had always made sure she was never in the middle
of the danger. She'd always considered herself danger adjacent.

Something inside her tightened when she thought about the fact that he hadn't
even blinked this time.

She sighed and placed the small pistol back in its wooden box and then placed
that back in its hiding place. Considering what they were about to do and who
they were planning to do it against, she was going to feel a lot more
comfortable with something a little bigger.

Inara wondered just how much it would take for Jayne to part with Vera.

***

Two long, austere, expressionless faces peered down the shaft, their eyes
adjusted to the dark quickly. Several figures crouched like ants at the bottom.
One face turned up to them, the glow of the metal cutters illuminating the top
of his bald scalp.

&quot;She's fused the roof access.&quot; He called up to them. &quot;And she's totally
disabled the elevator mechanisms.&quot;

&quot;She's intelligent.&quot; Said the man on the right.

&quot;More so than the lot of you, obviously.&quot; Said the man on the left.

&quot;We can't get in.&quot; His voice rose up, more than a little fear within it.
&quot;There's no way.&quot;

&quot;Cut through the floor.&quot; Said the first man. &quot;If you have to.&quot;

&quot;Find a way.&quot; Said the second. &quot;We don't care how.&quot;

***

&quot;I ain't playin'.&quot;

&quot;Please?&quot; She wheedled.

&quot;No.&quot; Jayne folded his arms over his chest and leaned back on the couch. &quot;Stop
lookin' at me like that, girl. I said no.&quot;

River made her eyes big and wide. She pouted. She even gave a little mewl for
good measure. Jayne set his jaw.

&quot;Seven more hours.&quot; She whined. &quot;Seven.&quot;

&quot;Look, I told you already, I ain't gonna play no gorram cards with no gorram
mind reading freak.&quot;

Zoe looked up from the kitchen as she stirred a spoon through the pot.

&quot;Good call.&quot; She agreed.

River looked him in the face, her eyes moved back and forth and she began to
smile. Evilly. She placed her chin on her hands and looked entirely smug. Jayne
sat up a little straighter.

&quot;Stop it, y'hear?&quot;

River's smile got deeper.

&quot;Fine.&quot; He gritted through clenched teeth and flipped over a card. &quot;Plums are
top.&quot;

***

Jonah watched Simon watch River from the doorway. He could feel the reverence
in the man, the slowly building joy at his sister's teasing, such a normal
state of being.

&quot;It's harder for us.&quot; Jonah watched Simon spin around, red faced at being
caught spying from the shadows. &quot;For you and me.&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry?&quot;

&quot;They don't understand.&quot; Jonah continued. &quot;They think it's difficult for you
because she's your sister, but that's not all.&quot;

Simon nodded for him to continue.

&quot;It hurts us more to see her like this,&quot; he explained, &quot;because we know what
she was like before. They don't have a basis for comparison.&quot;

Simon looked down.

&quot;I should have fought harder. Six months, even.&quot; He spat the words out. &quot;Jesus,
just six months!&quot;

&quot;There's no guarantee it would have made a difference.&quot; It was firm, Jonah's
voice, and left no room for doubt. &quot;She was the strongest, but also the most
fragile out of all of us. She would take anything they dished out, but she'd
already started to crack before I left.&quot;

A confused crinkle formed in Simon's brow.

&quot;Is this your idea of comforting?&quot;

Jonah came to stand next to him, he let his eyes linger on River as she smiled
to herself, quite obviously cheating as Jayne glared at her and handed over
another piece of paper.

&quot;She's the only one of us that never gave up, even when it was at its worst.&quot;
Jonah turned back to Simon. &quot;She always knew you'd come rescue her. Knew, by
the way, not believed or hoped. Knew.&quot;

Closing his eyes, Simon remembered a shaking hand reaching out to touch the
swelling of a black eye. I didn't think you'd come. Even now the words broke
something in him.

&quot;I just took too long.&quot;

&quot;No, you don't get it.&quot; Jonah insisted. &quot;She didn't give up hope, not when I
knew her and even if they eventually broke her down, you're the only one out
here that never gave up. You proved her right.&quot;

***

*She lies sideways on her bed. She's all wrong and that's fine by her, because
nothing has been right for over a month now and why she should be any different
escapes her.*

*The bed stretches out on either side of her, enough for her to spread her arms
out wide if she wants to. Her legs lean up against the wall, straight and long,
the generic gown falling down to her hips, and she crosses her ankles in the
air, watches her toes point, perfect and dainty. Her dance instructor back in
Capital City would have been so proud.*

*The bed is narrow and it supports her back to just underneath her shoulder
blades. River reaches her hands up past her head, revels in the stretch of her
muscles, the pull of her body as she bends back. Her hair hangs down and sweeps
the floor, her hands twist in air as she tightens for a second, then relaxes
into the arch.*

*Something just isn't right, but she doesn't know what.*

*What River remembers is a needle in her arm and then nothing until she woke up
yesterday. Her mouth is dry and tastes like copper. Her head is tender and she
can't move it very fast without causing jolts of pain and bursts of light
behind her eyes.*

*So she moves slowly and stares upside down at the wall.*

*It's not just the pain that scares her, it's the small slips of feeling she
gets whenever someone is near. River can't define it, it's nothing clear or
tangible. She thinks it's like a smell she can't identify. Something familiar
that she breathes in whole and knowing, but exhales ninety five percent of the
very second after, leaving nothing but smoky, almost wisps of nameless scents
and color. The more she chases after them, the less she can define.*

*She hasn't been able to see anyone for nearly two days now and it makes her
nervous. She doesn't know what's been done to them, doesn't even know what's
been done to herself. It's worse, somehow, the crushing fear. Worse when she
can't talk to Jonah or Daniel or Bethany, when she can't be strong for herself
because she has to be strong for Peter and poor, scared little Alex.*

*When she's alone and memories of a brother are enough to make her cry. The
deep ache for laughter in a room full of the scent of books and ink and the
softest buzzing of the cortex link. Where he pretends to be annoyed and she
tries to see how far she can go before he actually gets there.*

*The locks on her door sound and River crumples into herself, folding her legs
down to her body and snapping her head back up. It creates a white hot flash of
pain that makes her cry out, makes her breathless with dizziness as she hugs
her arms around her knees.*

*They've come to take her again. They're either going to take her back to the
medical lab or back to the group. It's a fifty percent chance, but those are
odds she doesn't want to play.*

*River whimpers when the images get to her before the hands do.*

***

&quot;Where have they gone?&quot;

Kaylee looked from the elevator and the darkened hallways that Daniel and
Sebastian disappeared down and back again. There were some frightening sounds
coming from the doors which they'd jammed open with two tables that were nearby
when they first got here. It was only a matter of time before they got through.

&quot;Securing the ground.&quot; Bethany said automatically. &quot;Sweeping for enemies.
Thoughtlessness will get you killed.&quot;

&quot;Enemies...?&quot; Even as she asked it, Kaylee knew the girl was right. The word
stuck in her head, along with 'killed'. They'd waged a war and now they were
going to have to fight it. The reality of it threatened to crash down on her.
&quot;Of course, enemies. Yes. I thought so.&quot;

&quot;It hasn't happened yet.&quot; Alex took her hand. &quot;Show us again. Please?&quot;

They looked at her, four faces that turned to her eagerly. Kaylee felt a smile
tug at the corner of her mouth. Before she finished the thought, the children
sat down and she settled herself into the middle of them.

&quot;She laughs a lot.&quot;

Kaylee began the narration, letting images of a happy River cascade through her
memory. In the darkness, she saw a dreamy faraway look come over Alex's small
face, her mouth hanging open. Bethany closed her eyes and a smile softened her
features. Minmei's hand slipped into Binh's and Kaylee saw him squeeze it.

Above them, the emergency lights flickered on and off. To the side of them, the
sound of power tools cutting through metal scratched through the room.
Somewhere in the distance, Kaylee heard a crash, some muffled thumps and a loud
crack that might have been a gun.

She paused and her eyes searched the black hallway. A small hand took her wrist
and she looked into Alex's gray eyes. The girl nodded and Kaylee felt herself
breathe a little easier.

&quot;River loves games.&quot; She continued, trying not to hear the sound of dragging.
&quot;We chase each other around the ship.&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Kaylee looked over to see Sebastian hauling the body of a man, tied
with rope, to the elevator. &quot;What else do you do together?&quot;

&quot;Sebastian!&quot; Bethany's voice both weary and amused. &quot;I told you to leave her
alone.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; He dropped the man, ignoring the groans that issued, and raised his
hands in innocence. &quot;It's a fair question.&quot;

Bethany made a face at Sebastian and turned to look into the dark hall behind
him.

&quot;Daniel?&quot; She called. &quot;He's doing it again.&quot;

&quot;He's allowed to ask questions. Kaylee's a big girl, she doesn't have to answer
if she doesn't want to.&quot; Came the even response as Daniel entered into the main
room, hauling his own tied man behind him. He stopped to give Sebastian a
pointed look. &quot;Of course, the more he asks, the more we really should share
with Kaylee. Just to be fair. Let's start with the dream he had last
night.&quot;

&quot;Dream?&quot; Sebastian grew wide eyed. &quot;I had no dream.&quot;

A smile grew on Kaylee's face as she watched them.

&quot;Didn't think so.&quot; Daniel replied with a straight face. &quot;Come on, let's get the
rest.&quot;

***

&quot;Hey honey.&quot; Zoe stepped into the bridge and smiled. &quot;I made you soup.&quot;

&quot;Soup? You bought me soup?&quot; Wash spun around, he searched the doorway behind
her. &quot;Are you mad? If Mal catches us in here with...&quot;

&quot;Mal will have to deal with me.&quot; Zoe said calmly and handed him the bowl. &quot;Now
eat, before I hold you down and make you.&quot;

&quot;But... soup?&quot; He stressed. &quot;All these consoles, one little drop...&quot;

&quot;Husband.&quot; She interrupted. &quot;I'm not asking. Eat it.&quot;

He made a face, but managed to bring a spoonful to his mouth. One eye was kept
firm on the door.

&quot;Relax,&quot; she said as she sat in the co-pilot's chair, &quot;he's too busy
supervising a high stakes game of top card between Jayne and River to come up
here and check on you.&quot;

Wash nearly choked on the spoonful of soup he'd been about to swallow.

&quot;Jayne's betting with River?&quot; He laughed. &quot;She doesn't have any chores to bet
with.&quot;

&quot;She's managing.&quot; Zoe chuckled. &quot;By my count, Jayne has to help her draw one
pretty picture, apologize to Simon eight times and Kaylee once and learn to
dance en pointe.&quot;

He grinned.

&quot;Guess she's gonna win every hand, huh?&quot;

&quot;Not so.&quot; Her eyes glittered. &quot;She loses when she wants to. I'm just having a
hard time picturing the Captain letting River take over sniping duty on our
next assignment.&quot;

&quot;Jayne bet that?&quot; Wash's mouth fell open. &quot;Mal's gonna kill him.&quot;

&quot;And River let him win for it.&quot; She nodded.

Wash sighed, deep and heavy as he looked down into his soup.

&quot;Do you think she ever gets bored?&quot; He asked. &quot;Between Simon and Mal, she never
gets to do anything.&quot;

Zoe glanced at him, then stared out into the black. If he was trying to get
somewhere with this, and previous experience told her he was, then it would be
a lot easier if she weren't looking directly at him. He hated an audience when
he was being serious.

&quot;Do you think...?&quot; She paused when he glanced sharply at her, then continued
anyway. &quot;Do you think it's the same for her as it was for you?&quot;

&quot;I don't know.&quot; He admitted softly. &quot;I hope not.&quot;

They sat in silence for a moment and Wash tried to eat more. The soup had
already started going cold and he wasn't even hungry to start with. Not that it
mattered, he would eat it, would finish every last trace of it. They had all
been through too many food rationings to waste it when they had it.

&quot;I felt like I was in anti-grav.&quot; He said slowly. &quot;Where everything takes so
long. You know, every step forward takes ten minutes. My brain was there, but
it wouldn't do what I wanted.&quot;

In the distance, Zoe's eyes picked up the flare of some debris floating through
the black, she automatically scanned the radars, but they weren't picking it
up. Whatever it was, it was too small and too far away to register.

&quot;You didn't know me.&quot; She said it softly and Wash heard the crack in her voice.

&quot;I didn't even know me.&quot; He answered. &quot;It was all gone. I had another life, it
felt complete, but there were no specifics, no details.&quot;

Wash put the half empty bowl down carefully and went to stand behind his wife.
He brought his arms down over her shoulders, rested his hands on her breastbone
and his chin on the top of her head.

&quot;I know you now.&quot; He told her. &quot;I know every little piece of our life together,
every detail, even the bad things.&quot;

She leaned back and kissed the underside of his chin as she smiled.

&quot;There are no bad things, husband.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes.&quot; He leaned over and kissed her upside down mouth. &quot;I remember now.&quot;

***

Four guards, no longer armed, sat propped against the wall with their arms
bound behind their backs, their ankles tied and their mouths gagged. Next to
them was propped one of the doctors and if his binds were tighter than the
others, tighter than strictly necessary, nobody pointed it out.

Kaylee eyed them all with suspicion as she listened to the familiar clicks of
guns being checked and loaded that sounded behind her.

&quot;Sebastian, here, you take an auto.&quot; Daniel said.

&quot;My specialty!&quot; Came the reply.

&quot;One for me, here Bethany, Alex.&quot; The allocation continued. &quot;Minmei, Binh, take
the shotguns, two apiece, and keep the usual pattern.&quot;

A pause.

&quot;Kaylee?&quot; She turned, waiting. &quot;You stay behind us, okay?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Her eyes narrowed. &quot;I don't get one?&quot;

They looked at her.

&quot;The twins get two!&quot; She pouted.

&quot;Gun history?&quot; Daniel watched her face flush red. &quot;I thought as much. We'll
watch out for you, don't worry.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; She made a face. &quot;I just want to make an official objection to this.&quot;

&quot;So noted.&quot; Six voices replied as they nodded as one.

&quot;Well...&quot; She scanned the nearby area. &quot;Can I at least have a chair leg?&quot;

***

River stood up and clutched her two losing pieces of paper, she smiled her
thanks at Jayne who only pretended to snarl back. He was all warm on the
inside, smooth and flowing like melted butter. She stopped to think about the
memory of a kitchen stocked with real food. A wall of intent hit her from the
side and she clutched the papers tighter.

&quot;You're not going on sniper duty.&quot; Mal sighed. &quot;Jayne should damn well know
better. You owe him something else. Work it out between yourselves.&quot;

&quot;We'll see.&quot; She smiled coyly.

Mal's eyes flickered for a moment.

&quot;What else did he win?&quot;

But River folded the paper into the palm of her hand and held it behind her
back. There was no way she was going to let it go. It was the key to getting
Jayne to hold his end of the bargain. Her eyes dared him to fight her for it
and for a second the energy radiating from him suggested that he would, but he
backed down.

&quot;Fine. You just run it by me before doing anything completely stupid, do you
hear me?&quot;

&quot;Yes Captain.&quot;

She gave a salute and her eyes gleamed as she skipped away. The paper curled
into her hand, warmed by it, pressed into the grooves of her skin. She could
feel the lines of ink on it bend into the new creases, snapping over folds and
creating new shapes. It didn't matter, she knew what it said.

***

The warmth of the engine room surrounded him. Jonah liked it here. Everything
in it spoke volumes. He could sit in the hammock and absorb the leftover
threads of Kaylee, learn about her straight from the source. It wasn't a Kaylee
scared and terrified and in desperate need of comfort, nor was it a Kaylee seen
through the eyes of River, tinged with need and adoration and a little bit of
hero worship.

Here, in this room, was a Kaylee who spoke to the engine, who cared for each
and every piece and part. There were patches and repairs made by someone who
couldn't bear waste. Orderly piles of junk on the shelves from one who couldn't
part with anything as long as there was some possible use for it.

The colors lived inside these walls, oranges and rusted reds that spoke of joy
and peace and heat. The emotions that ran through this space were hard and fast
and had been felt to their fullest.

Jonah knew exactly why River was drawn to this woman.

He thought about the coldness he'd woken up to, the sterility and anonymity of
the place that had held him for a year and a half before they'd tried to kill
him. The prison that had held River for six months after that and the children
for another twelve.

Kaylee was everything the Academy was not.

He sat in the hammock, closed his eyes and waited for her. The curiosity of her
crept over him well before he felt the dip and shifting of his weight that
tumbled him against her as she settled herself next to him, shoulder to
shoulder.

*That and more. Kaylee. My fun, like before, but not. Never go back.*

They shared warmth.

*I saw what happened to Magda.* River flinched at his thoughts. *Show me the
other five.*

*Charles. Col. Magda.* She continued the litany of names. *Aida. Tyson. Taban.*

Jonah let the images pass into him, the faces of the younger ones that had died
because of him. It hadn't happened all at once, not on the same day. They'd
made it last, gave the full impact to those left behind.

*There are eight of us now.* He thought. *There should be seven.*

*Hidden in the basement, thirteen made from twelve* her brain countered,
*Shouldn't be there. Too many.*

*We're the variables.* It sounded like both of them and River couldn't discern
who it was. *One of us is included in their plans. The other isn't.*

They sat, side by side, not speaking and trying not to think. There were too
many thoughts to be had and very few of them were pleasant. Very gently,
together, they made the hammock swing.

*You called me sweet heart...* River picked up his hand and examined the large
fingers, the wiry hairs that dotted the back of his wrist. *... still do. On
the inside.*

&quot;River? Don't.&quot;

He said it out loud and she felt him withdraw from her mind more than when he
took his hand away. Both acts left her lonely. The hammock tumbled at the loss
of his weight.

***

*The door opens and River steps inside before they can put a hand on her arm
and guide her in. Faces turn her way and several of them call her name. A group
of them crowd around something in the corner. Her heart freezes.*

*Evan runs up to her, shy little Evan who was so quiet in the first week they
never thought she'd say anything and now she speaks loud and fast so that they
can't see how scared she is.*

*River! The girl cries and grabs her hand. It's Jonah!*

*She lets herself be pulled to the crowd in the corner and already knows what
she's going to see.*

*He hit one of them. Daniel explains. After they took you.*

*They all move, shifting away to make a space for her by his head, and River
can't stop the gasp that escapes her lips. Everything about him looks bloody
and broken and bruised.*

*Jonah. She kneels next to him, takes his hand and twines her fingers into his.
It's about the only part of him that doesn't look like it will hurt. Why?*

*He cracks an eye open to look at her and there is a large purple clot in the
middle of it.*

*You're not wrong. He rasps it through cracked and swollen lips. They didn't
bring you back wrong.*

*River feels it and it stuns her, makes her pause. That inhalation of another
person, the only difference is that this time she keeps it, she knows what it
is. Relief that isn't hers courses through and over her.*

*She doesn't know if the tears in her eyes are hers for him or his for her.*

***

&quot;We'll split up.&quot; Daniel said again and they nodded. Kaylee got the impression
that they were speaking aloud for her benefit. &quot;Minmei, Binh and Alex, you stay
here. Watch these guys and keep an eye out for any breaches of the
perimeter.&quot;

The sound of the metal cutters continued from the elevator.

Alexandria made a face.

&quot;No.&quot; Daniel told her. &quot;You're staying here and you're going to rest. Do you
hear me?&quot;

He reached out to her stubborn face and Kaylee saw him touch a gentle finger to
the red raw marks at the side of her forehead and along strategic points across
the base of her skull.

&quot;It ends today.&quot; His voice was deep and tightly controlled as he made the
promise. &quot;One way or another. It's time.&quot;

They moved then and Kaylee followed him, Bethany and Sebastian down the hall.
The three of them had their guns at the ready and she, well, she had a keen eye
and a broken chair leg. The hallway split into two and, without a word, Bethany
and Sebastian turned to the left.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; She asked him. &quot;One way or another?&quot;

His eyes sized her up and down.

&quot;You know how we're going to get out of here?&quot; Daniel waited for the slow shake
of her head. &quot;Neither do I. There's only one way in or out and that's the
elevator shaft. Even the air is pumped in through miniscule pipes. They're
going to get in sooner or later.&quot;

He stopped in front of a door and turned the handle.

&quot;There are too many of them and not enough of us.&quot; A sigh punctuated his
speech. &quot;You've bought us time, but we can't stop it.&quot;

She stepped into the room behind him and waited for her eyes to adjust to the
dark. Not each room was equipped with emergency lighting. There were odd shapes
along the walls and a distant humming.

&quot;Are you saying what I think you're saying?&quot; She turned on him. &quot;What about the
others?&quot;

&quot;Do you even know what it's like in here?&quot; He didn't look at her as he began
searching the cabinets in the middle of the room. &quot;All those stories River told
you? They're nothing. Nothing to what came after. You don't know, you'll never
know. You heard what they did to Alex last night! You can see the scars! What
makes you think she can take another three years of this? Any of us?&quot;

Kaylee said nothing. One thing she knew about engines was that when one wanted
to overflow, sometimes the best thing to do is let it.

&quot;We watched them wear River down and we couldn't do a thing about it! Every
time she came back from them she was worse, just a little more gone, a little
more cracked. Every single time we knew it would happen to us as well. Jonah
got off easy! They left him alone for the past eighteen months.&quot;

He was shaking and Kaylee took a step towards him. Daniel couldn't feel anybody
but himself at that moment. A bursting of a bubble he hadn't known was there,
hadn't allowed himself to, an oozing of resentment at the responsibility he
hadn't asked for. Five younger faces looking to him to save them, to make it
all alright. Twelve long months of intimidation, fear and pain.

&quot;River got out, too. She left us in here for a year, Kaylee, a full year!&quot;

&quot;It's not her fault.&quot; She said softly.

&quot;And it's not mine.&quot; Daniel let it out in a sigh, his momentum gone as his eyes
scanned the desks in front of him. &quot;Do you think they're just going to slap us
on the wrist for this? We either find a way out or we go down in a blaze of
glory. You think you can come in here and show Bethany how happy River is and
she's just going to accept it and continue to play science experiment? Alex?
Sebastian? They all want out. Or they want it over.&quot;

His face was calm again and he looked her in the eyes when he repeated himself.

&quot;One way or another.&quot;

&quot;River's coming.&quot; Kaylee said it quietly, but with enough conviction for him to
take notice as she hefted her chair leg again. &quot;They're coming back. And I
never agreed to this kamikaze mission of yours. So, I'm not giving up just yet,
I don't care how long it takes.&quot;

Daniel tasted her hope like bitterness on his tongue and he wanted to like it,
wanted to open to it, but he'd learned long and hard. He turned to a handle on
the wall and pulled open a drawer.

&quot;You remember those words, Kaylee.&quot; Her eyes adjusted to the swirling mist of
dry ice that poured over the sides. &quot;Because you're going to need them if that
elevator gives way. You're not ready for what they're prepared to do if they
get you alive.&quot;

***

Jonah's hand swept in broad strokes across the paper, the pencil creating fast
lines and sure measurements. Without thinking about it, the plans he drew were
to scale.

&quot;Four hours.&quot; Mal announced to the table. &quot;We need to organize this thing.&quot;

&quot;They know we're coming.&quot; Jonah announced. &quot;They have to. It's no use being coy
about it, they'll spot this ship the minute we break atmo, because they'll be
looking for it.&quot;

&quot;Frontal attacks,&quot; Zoe nodded. &quot;we're known for them.&quot;

Jonah drew little crosses on the outsides of the building and Jayne eyed it
warily.

&quot;These are their main defense locations. Discreet, but powerful canons. Take
these out from a distance and we've got a good chance of getting close.&quot;

&quot;Um?&quot; Wash raised his hand. &quot;Serenity doesn't have external firepower.&quot;

&quot;Don't need guns.&quot; River stepped into the room. &quot;Canons work on navigation,
radar controls, heat, seek, destroy. Block the nav sats. Electricity fields
swarm the screen. Needle through a haystack.&quot;

&quot;I can do that.&quot; Wash replied.

&quot;This is where they're keeping her.&quot; Jonah pointed as they strained over to
look. &quot;Same as the others. Everything goes our way, they'll all be there.&quot;

&quot;Little problem.&quot; Mal said. &quot;Nothing ever goes our way.&quot;

Jonah's lip curled in amusement.

&quot;We'll know.&quot; He looked at River who stayed standing by the door. &quot;When we get
closer, we'll know where they all are. We'll adjust the plan then. Best case
scenario? They're within easy reach. Just ideal? They're all together
somewhere.&quot;

&quot;Worst case?&quot; Asked Zoe.

&quot;Training ops.&quot; River intoned. &quot;Separated. Guarded. Isolation. Spread out. Too
late if it's the med lab.&quot;

&quot;Then let's not make it the med lab.&quot; Mal felt a chill when he thought of those
words connected with Kaylee. &quot;How are we doing this?&quot;

&quot;Three teams.&quot; Jonah said. &quot;Jayne, Simon and River will find the children. Mal,
Zoe, Wash and Inara will find Kaylee.&quot;

Glances were shared across the table.

&quot;That's an interesting line up you got there, three of them and four of us.&quot;
Mal pointed out. &quot;Exactly what will you and the Preacher be doing?&quot;

&quot;I have my own agenda.&quot; Jonah replied, looking mal straight in the eye. &quot;I need
cover. Mr. Book can provide it.&quot;

&quot;My concern,&quot; Mal continued, &quot;is whether Sheppard Book will return from this
agenda.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Book will be fine. My agenda is River's agenda.&quot; Jonah said as River
stared at him, her mouth falling open. &quot;Get Kaylee, get our children, make sure
they never do this again.&quot;

&quot;The unwinnable war.&quot; River announced. &quot;You won't come back this time.&quot;

&quot;River...&quot; Jonah turned to look at her. &quot;Don't...&quot;

&quot;You never listen to me!&quot;

She shouted the words as she ran out of the room. Mal heard the distinct sound
of a bunk hatch opening and knew she'd gone to Kaylee's room. He turned his
focus back to Jonah.

&quot;You wanna tell us what that was all about?&quot;

*When they finally relent and let him inside her room, Jonah finds her pressed
into a small ball in the corner, sobbing. He's next to her in a flash,
crouching on his haunches and trying hard to resist the urge to touch her as
she scrambles away from him and buries her head in her arms.*

*River? He tries to break into her pain. It's me, it's Jonah.*

*I know, of course I know. She moans into the wall. I can't not know, can I? I
knew when the door opened.*

*What have they done? It's a question whispered to himself. Jesus, River.*

*I can't stop it. I tried, but it's all too loud, too bright, I see what I
shouldn't. I hear everything. Too much at once.*

*She brushes her hair aside to brave a look up at him and the look in her eyes
makes him stone cold with anger.*

*There has to be a way, River.*

*She shakes her head slightly.*

*It hurts, more than anything you know. She whispers her plea. Don't do it.*

*Jonah looks at her with surprise.*

*I didn't say...*

*It's River that reaches out to him, her hand touching his forehead and he can
feel how scared she is, can feel how much she's trembling when she actually
makes contact.*

*I hear it anyway.*

*It happens suddenly, the breaking of a wall, she covers his face and presses
the pads of her fingers into his flesh. He feels her shudder before she climbs
into his arms.*

*Please don't do it.*

*I can do it, River, for you. She softens against him and begins to cry again.
I'll find a way, I promise.*

&quot;Get back to the others, now.&quot; Daniel said, suddenly. He looked at Kaylee's
confused face. &quot;Not you, them.&quot;

She raised an eyebrow, but nodded. Kaylee could not stop looking at the
drawers, six of them, that lined the wall. She couldn't believe, didn't want to
believe the tiny bodies that were stored in them, twisted and misshapen. Her
eyes fell to one of the tags that stood just to the right of a small foot.

Prototype One. Genus: subject RTx and subject JSy. 1507/2516 - 0709/2516.

Daniel clipped a data stick into the desk screen, his eyes scanned the read
out. Next to his hand stood a metal lock box whose lid had been prized open. It
was full of data sticks.

&quot;We need these.&quot;

He was speaking more to himself than Kaylee, who was looking in another drawer
and reading the tag with interest. Her eyes narrowed just a little bit and she
bit her bottom lip.

Prototype Two. Genus: subject RTx and subject JSx. 1112/2516 - 2602/2517.

&quot;What are you waiting for Sebastian? I said now!&quot;

Alex cried. Her head bent down as she let her hair cover her face. Minmei's
hand smoothed over the knobs of the girl's spine, soft and comforting. Binh
looked at his sister.

&quot;He doesn't mean it,&quot; but the three of them knew Binh was lying, &quot;he won't let
anything happen to us.&quot;

Alex sniffled and raised her right hand, the butt of the gun rested in the
crook of her elbow. She squeezed the trigger without looking and didn't flinch
at the loud bursts of fire.

***

Inara knocked softly on the infirmary door. She waited for Simon to look up and
gesture her in. He was looking at a screen bright with many colors that
decorated a spinal cord. She could only assume he was going over River's file.
