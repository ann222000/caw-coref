Well my wonderful Lilly passed away late yesterday afternoon. She was
getting weaker by the hour, so I rushed her to my vet who did the task.
I cuddled her as she slipped away.

Sweet little Lil'. She was such a cheeky rat with attitude. Especially
for the first half of her life. Chewing carpet and holes in walls.
Intent on getting onto the window sill, which would freak me out as it
was high for a rat.

She mellowed with age and became cuddlier for the second half of her
life, which was really nice. Although, she was never a morning rat and
was grumpy when you disturbed her from a deep sleep to give her a
scritch. She didn't like Neil (my husband) for some reason. I don't
know why, as he always wanted to be her friend, but she just had it in
for his fingers.

So, even though there are eight rats remaining, the place is noticeably
emptier without her. It's so heart breaking caring for rats. Lilly
died at the tender age of two years and four months. I'll really miss
my Lilly as will her sisters, Tigger and Crackers. Take care, my little
girl.

Dewi.

Oh no, Dewi, I'm so sorry.  There's been so much sad news on here lately.
Lilly sounds like she was a real character, bless her heart.  Sending you
lots of {{{{hugs}}}}  You are in my thoughts, take care.

I'm so sorry Dewi. :(
It's true that even in large numbers, you feel each passing and find the
cage almost empty without them.

I'm sorry to hear that :-( I replied to your post in the other thread
before reading this one. I'm sure she felt you there during her last
minutes.

Thank you Tracey, Joanne, Tale, rat.charmer (sorry but I don't know
your real name), Lynn, Mandie and Rosemary for your kind words and
thoughts. I really do appreciate them.

Lilly's cage mates (Crackers and Tigger) seem a little lost without
her. So I'm introducing them to three of my other rats, Ginger, Puggles
and Bunny. Hopefully this will inject some new life and enthusiasm into
the pair. Ginger will probably appreciate some mature company as Pugs
and Bun are considerably younger than him.

Thanks again guys.

Dewi.
