&lt;Sorry if this is a repeat post, it does not appear to have posted after a
couple of weeks&gt;

I'm presently looking for a "practice bike" to use for both drilling and
teaching police motor handling skills. I want to put an oil cooler on this,
possibly with a thermostatically activated fan. These drills are hard on
the engine/clutch and almost all occur at low speeds. I know KZ/KZPs have
had oil coolers mounted on them over the years by their owners and am
trying to track down some photos to see what the installation details
looked like. My preference is the KZP but any KZ will be welcome. APBM is
always a good place to post these things, so I'll monitor there and here in
case anyone has one. Thanks.

Why don't you just install a large 12 volt electric fan so that it
blows directly at the air cooling fins on the engine, if you're
worried about overheating?

If you're riding around a parking lot slowly, you're not going to get
much air flow through a small oil cooler anyway.

And, since you are asking about how oil coolers were installed on
those older Kawasakis, you probably don't know that they weren't
hooked up
rationally at all.

The aftermarket kits would take oil under pressure off the main oil
gallery. There's a plug on the right hand side of the engine that they
would remove and
install a plumbing fitting to attach the oil line.

The oil line would be a neoprene rubber hose or a
trick-looking plastic hose covered with braided steel mesh.

That hose would go up over the engine to the oil cooler, which had to
be mounted ahead of the rider according to AMA rules.

Early superbikes that were run on the race track had a small oil
cooler mounted on the plastic tail piece, but the AMA outlawed that
installation because it could leak and oil the track without the rider
ever knowing what was happening.

You may still see WERA endurance race bikes with oil coolers ahead of
the engine, under the engine, in the fender well ahead of the rear
tire, and under the back of the rear fender. I counted about six oil
coolers on one GSXR-1100 at Willow Springs once.

Back to the bogus oil cooler installation on the KZ1000. Here's where
it gets seriously stupid. The return hose from the oil cooler (mounted
ahead of the engine) would go up over the engine and empty into THE
SAME OIL PRESSURE GALLERY near the oil pressure switch!!!!

In other words, there was NO PRESSURE DIFFERENCE between the two hoses
to cause oil to flow through the cooler!

What caused any flow at all, if both hoses "saw" the same pressure?
There was a thermosiphon effect whereby hot oil rose up one hose or
the other, and cooler oil descended back down the other hose.

Beats me which direction the oil flowed. Maybe the braided steel hose
radiated as much heat as the small oil cooler.

Oil in the pan would stay around 180 degrees, oil in the main gallery
would be about 240 to 300 degrees, depending on the operating
conditions.

Lockhart made a small oil cooler that looked like a little heater
core, Derale made a cooler that looked like an air conditioning or
refrigeration condensor with fins on large diameter tubes. Derale
coolers didn't do much oil cooling.

Racers would go to Earl's Supply for a larger capacity oil cooler. It
was thicker than a Lockhart cooler.

I suppose you could easily find an oil cooler for a 1986 to 1992
Suzuki GSXR-750 or GSXR-1100. They are really huge oil coolers.

How do you plumb the thing onto a KZ1000? You take oil off of the main
oil gallery, just like the old Lockhart/Derale/Earl's Supply coolers,
run it through the oil cooler, and dump it back into the crankcase at
the crankcase breather.

That way, you would get oil flow through the cooler.

But there's a problem with taking oil off the main oil gallery.

You don't want to rob the engine of oil pressure. That's a bad
mistake. You need to install a restrictor orifice in one of the
fittings. The orifice hole might be about 3/16ths of an inch in
diameter, but that's just my guess, you'd want to know about
how much oil pressure the engine was losing to the cooler.

The early 903cc Z-1 and the first KZ-900's and KZ-1000's had roller
bearing crankshafts and they didn't need much oil pressure.

But, I seem to recall that Kawasaki switched to plain bearing
crankshafts sometime around 1980. You don't want to rob too much oil
pressure from plain bearings and cam bearings.

The electric cooling fan I mentioned at the beginning would be a lot
simpler to install. So what if it used a lot of battery power while
maneuvering slowly around a parking lot?

It's not like you're going to be stranded somewhere alone if one
battery goes dead...

Big fans like that are used by hotrodders who take the steel or
plastic fan off their car engine and install radiators with attached
electrical cooling fans.

Why on earth bother? Just get a modern machine like a water-cooled dirt

on, as well.

Or do you actually *have* to use a 30 year-old dinosaur?

He may need to use the bikes that folks are actually riding on the
street.  My impression is that he's actually doing training for
motorcycle policemen.

But, you could presumably subsitute a water-cooled bike that is of the
same basic size and weight as the Kawa police bikes.  (None come to mind,
though.)

Otherwise, I wouldn't fiddle with trying to convert the KZs to oil
cooling.  I have an oil-cooled Bandit, and was surprised to discover that
there are additional oil channels/lines for pumping the cooling oil
around.  They don't just pump the lubricating oil through a radiator.
Therefore, I doubt a retro-fitted oil radiator would do much.

A big-ass electric fan may be helpful.  Still, you'd probably be better
off subsituting something water-cooled, though.

That Bandit led to a lot of surprises for you, didn't it, Mike?

Like the time you tried to torque down the cylinder head cover like an
obedient do-it-yourselfer, and snapped off part of a cam bearing cap.
Maybe you learned that you never torque oily bolts unless the manual
specifies lubrication.

And, there's a lot of things you probably don't understand about
Suzuki Advanced Cooling System (SACS), or any other oil cooling
system, for that matter.

Oil lines don't "pump cooling oil around", they are a conduit for oil
pressure and flow. The oil pump is driven by gears off the clutch
basket gear and the pump actually provides the pressure, not the oil
lines.

Many motorcycle engines have/had external oil pressure lines going up
to lube the camshafts, but SACS flows a lot of oil to the area above
the combustion chamber to provide intimate contact between the cooling
medium and the cylinder head.

Oil does NOT transfer heat very well, it will only absorb HALF the
heat that water will absorb. So, why did Suzuki choose oil, instead of
water for a cooling medium?

The cylinder head and block don't require water passages or a water
pump. And, SACS also squirts jets of oil up underneath the piston
crowns to cool the pistons.

Why would Suzuki built SACS engine for almost a decade and then
suddenly switch to water cooling, after all?

It was probably because of oil windage losses. What was squirted up
underneath the pistons had to come down, and the connecting rod and
crankshaft had to fight a rain of oil at high RPM.

Suzuki started turning the GSXR-series engine up to 13K RPM, as they
were originally intended to operate, before the bean counters refused
to authorize I-beam connecting rods that could withstand the stresses.

The engine had to find that excess oil windage, so the SACS became
history for Suzuki sportbikes. Only Kan O' Tunas, Bandits, and
GSX1100G's retained the obsolete SACS.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They don't just pump the lubricating oil through a radiator.
">

Nobody pumps the lubricating oil through a cooler. There would be too
much pressure loss. What they do is *bypass* a small fraction of the
hot oil through a small orifice.

The vast majority of the oil is used for lubrication in non-SACS
engines, and Suzuki used a differential pressure regulator to control
whether oil meant for the cooler was actually dumped right back into
the crankcase.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Therefore, I doubt a retro-fitted oil radiator would do much.
">

Shows what you know, Mike. My GS-1100EZ's oil temperature gauge was
inoperative when I took delivery of the new machine. I got to the top
of a mountain on my first sport ride and looked at the loose wire
dangling near the oil temperature sensor.

I connected the wire and turned the ignition key on and was horrified
to see the oil temperature gauge rise 3/4's of the way up the scale.

There were only a few numbers on the temperature gauge and the oil
temperature rose to what I figured was 280 to 290 degrees F.

I called up the owner of the $crewzuki $tealer$hip and asked him what
to do.

He said that $crewzuki should have never installed the oil temperature
gauge, that it just frightened new owners with the high readings. He
said to go ahead and ride it, but if the gauge pegged all the way out,
to put the bike on a truck and haul it to the shop.

I knew a lot of speed shop owners and magazine people, so I started
asking around about what to do. One semi-professional drag racer
recommended the Lockhart competition model with the braided steel
hoses.

And the Lockhart cooler did work, Mike. It lowered the oil temperature
down from about 290 degrees to about 240 degrees.

You want your oil temperature to reach at least 212 degrees to boil
moisture out of it. If your engine is using petroleum-based oil, you
need to cut your oil change interval in half for every 10 degrees over
240 degrees that the engine runs at.

During the winter time, the Lockhart oil cooler was too effective, the
oil temperature would only reach 180 degrees and the engine wouldn't
carburete properly.

I covered the oil cooler with duct tape in the winter.

Suzuki was using a partial flow system to the oil cooler on their
GS-1000S models (the one with the blue and white quarter fairing) and
that engine was set up with removable plugs for hooking up an oil
cooler.

All the subsequent GS-1100's had the same plugs, but Lockhart didn't
plumb into Suzuki's system.

Instead, they supplied an oil filter cover with an oil bleed notch in
it, to allow oil under pressure to bypass the filter and go to the oil
cooler.

And nothing whatsoever to do with noise/emissions regs, oh no.

You might as well ask: "Why did Honda (and everyone else) build
air-cooled fours, and then switch to water-cooling?"

Those old oil-cooled Suzuki engines were superb lumps: very reliable,
very long-lived. I mean, they've been around for over 20 years, so they
weren't as shit as you claim. They'd just had their day. Time moves on.

No, I will ask, "Why didn't Suzuki go *directly* from air-cooled I-4's
to water-cooled I-4's?"

And I will answer my own question with, "They thought that an oil/air-

Where did I ever say that GSXR engines were "shit"? GSXR fans who were
paying attention noticed that the production model 1986 GSXR-750
produced about 50 horsepower less than the 1985 GSXR that was running
in Formula I, but that was no surprise to anybody.

The street version had a rev limiter that kicked in
2500 RPM lower than the full race machine because Suzuki wasn't
willing to spend the money on I-beam connection rods.

Surprise, surprise. Yamaha was still not willing to install I-beam
connecting rods in their YZF-R6, last time I checked.

The R6 engine was able to withstand continuous running at 15K (2000
RPM past the power peak) because the rods were surface-hardened...

It's pretty low speed stuff and a practice session can last several hours.
One drill, which is to ride along the white line at as close to a stand

Actually, I enjoy the bike I restored and prefer it MUCH more to any modern
bike I could own. I would hesitate to call it a dinosaur and as someone who
prefers an air cooled dirtbike because those guys who poke a hole in their
radiator or sweep a hose off 20 miles into the middle of nowhere, I don't
find the "modern" means "always better". For the kind of riding I enjoy, I
can pretty much kick *any* other bike's ass in this arena... the KZP was
the best close-quarters cop bike ever made, though I'd like to try out one
of the old Guzzi's someday. For what I need to do, it needs to be a police
bike and I'm actually looking for a second KZP.

This isn't quite representative of the sort of riding I'm talking about...
it's a video I made to look at one specific thing in my form (how well I'm
hinging). I'm pretty sloppy on a lot of the things I was playing at as I
never thought anyone other than me was going to see it. With that KZP, I
can tighten up the turns you see here considerably. 14' turn, or &lt; 1.3
parking spaces, and move from max lock/lean to max lock/lean with great
ease. The shorter wheelbase makes threading through narrow place with a
breeze once you master what to do with the front wheel to control the track
of the rear.

I know... It's boring and gay and most will ask what's the point, but I get
to help train police and I find it both challenging and rewarding, and plan
to get into some competition this year.

OK, well, that's fair enough, in every respect. To be honest, I till

Run it on top grade oil and I can't see you'll have a problem.

I remember a movie in which Gene Wilder repeated
the same phrase (1), over and over and over.

It just doesn't matter what great strides European diesel
manufacturers make, if the products aren't cost competitive in the US.

Americans will probably be buying Chinese or Korean built diesels in
the future, because that's where the cheap labor is located. I doubt
that I will be seeing any Jaguar diesels around here.

And, in a blurb crawling across the bottom of my TV screen (as I
watched the unfolding drama of the demise of the fat gold digger who
inherited half a billion U$D), I noticed that the EPA wants diesel
particulate emissions reduced by 90% by 2015.

But I didn't make any effort to investigate the story any further.
Like Gene Wilder said...

(1) "It just doesn't matter", ad infinitum.

If you decide to go with the big fan idea, be sure to keep a close eye

Extra electrical load melts those cheap plastic connectors.

You could probably find some sort of thermoswitch that closes when the
oil temperature gets up around 300 degrees F, and it will get that hot
in the summertime. Just plumb the switch into the main oil gallery.

If you go to www.partsfish.com and look at the CRANKCASE diagram, part
number 92066 is the main oil gallery plug. You can see that the oil
pressure switch is right beside the oil gallery plug, and that's why
it was so stupid to return oil from an aftermarket cooler to that

Dan Gurney modified a lot of KZ1000's for police use in the 1970's,
but I never paid much attention too them when they had me pulled over
for speeding.

I looked at the 2003 KZ1000P diagrams on www.partsfish.com and I don't
see any oil cooler on any diagram.

The KZ1000P still uses the old style roller crankshaft that requires
only a few pounds of oil pressure and still has cam bearings in the
cylinder head.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If this works the way the heating loop in my den works when the check valve

Some inexpensive cars had no water pumps, they relied on the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;How do you plumb the thing onto a KZ1000? You take oil off of the main
&gt; &gt;oil gallery, just like the old Lockhart/Derale/Earl's Supply coolers,
&gt; &gt;run it through the oil cooler, and dump it back into the crankcase at
&gt; &gt;the crankcase breather.

&gt; How was the connection to the crankcase breather made? Did you just fire
&gt; the oil back into the breather? If so, was there any downside to sealing
&gt; the breather off?
">

Personally, I wouldn't want to disable the crankcase breather, but
racers wouldn't much care what systems they defeated when they
modified an engine.

There is probably a baffle plate inside the 14070 body, breather that
is shown on the BREATHER COVER OIL PAN diagram. It would be easy
enough to take the one bolt out of the breather body to see what
you've got there.

You could also drill a 1/4 or 5/16 inch hole in the camshaft cover and
return the cooled oil to the area of the cam chain tunnel so it could
easily flow back down to the crankcase.

You really don't need large diameter hoses (like 3/4ths or 1-inch) for
your oil cooler, unless you're counting on the extra cooling effect
you get from the hoses.

It might look silly to some unenlightened bystanders, but all you
would need is small diameter hoses to an oil cooler, since the flow
through the cooler has to be restricted in order to avoid robbing the
cam bearings of pressure.

One other point that I neglected to mention is that lean fuel/air
mixture madated by the EPA to reduce air pollution and allow imported
motorcycles to pass emissions tests cause the engines to run hot.

Opening the idle mixture screws 1/8th or 1/4th of a turn really helps
keep an engine cool in traffic on hot summer days.

It's a simple matter to drill a pilot hole in the EPA anti-tamper
plugs that conceal the idle mixture screws. Then you screw a small
sheet metal screw into the pilot hole and pull the plug out with a
pair of pliers.

Then you can open the idle mixture screws about 1/4 of a turn
counterclockwise and the engine will run cooler, start easier, warm up
faster, and have better throttle response.

You can tell if you have turned the idle mixture screws too far CCW,
the idle RPM will slow down.

The mistake that amateur mechanics make when they adjust the idle
mixture screws is they think the idle RPM should keep increasing as
they open the screws.

When the idle mixture gets too rich, the idle speed slows
down and they compensate by turning the master idle knob clockwise.

Then the engine idles far too fast when it gets warm and that drives
the amateur mechanics up the wall, since they don't know that the
extra gasoline that makes the engine idle too fast is coming from
three transition ports
uncovered too soon by the bottom edge of the throttle butterflies.

The corrective action for high speed idling is to turn the idle
mixture screws clockwise a bit, and then readjust the master idle
knob.

So what else is in the cop world over your way?

Round these parts marked plod bikes are either Pan Europeans (Honda

The unmarked traffic police bikes? There's a couple of Honda Blackbirds
and a VFR8 locally, Strathclyde over to the west have a silver ST1300
(with onboard video) and Grampian plod have (or had last year anyway) a
Ducati 999. I'm reliably informed that some of the English bike cops
have been using the new Fazer 1000 and there's at least one R1 police
bike out there.

Rhode Island rings a bell. Some of my ancestors were governors and
such in Providence and were controlling the future development of the
colony and the state, until there was an outbreak of democracy, and a
new constitution replaced the deal we made with Charles II in 1663.

Add motorcycles to the thought, and I get visions of
Jim Carey as a Rhode Island motorcycle patrolman with multiple

a midget chauffeur and he has to raise three black kids but he never

The rims were called "clencher" rims and Goodyear made the special
tires, as I recall.

Shooting out a tire on a pursuing motorcycle is like a one in a
hundred possibility, *if* the shooter had an assault rifle and took
his time sighting on the tire instead of the officer.

High speed pursuits on Southern California freeways are too dangerous,
officers will break off pursuit if the speeds get up around 100 mph.

There's a freeway overpass on Interstate 5 near Newhall, CA that is
named after a motorcycle officer that was so dedicated to duty, he
rode off the collapsed ramp and fell a couple of hundred feet to his
death after the last big earthquake.

And that's why there are no diesel motorcycles in California ;-)

While it is simpler to buy something than to start from scratch and
build something *completely new*, I know for a fact the KZ-1000 will
run cooler if he just richens up the idle mixture, and the cooling fan
will work better than the oil cooler.

Dyno operators will use box fans to cool motorcycle engines between

keep air flowing past the cooling fins.

Engineers at a certain fly-by-night company that supplied
telecommunications equipment to the Saudis were disinterested in
keeping up with inspection records, and everytime I would ask somebody

Nope. I'll quite happily back you when you post something relevant and

Hoyt, with an H. God rest his carbonised soul. He was astonishingly good
on some things, and equally appalling on others. I remember with
fondness a long-running dispute over whether (of all things) a Honda 250
Rebel had vertically split crankcases, which I insisted it did.

It ran for days, as he trotted out more and more "experts" and
"evidence" to "prove" it was not so, and then he went and looked at
one....

I think Potage or whatever he's morphed into these days is filling the
gap quite nicely.

&gt; The aftermarket kits would take oil under pressure off the main oil

&gt; The oil line would be a neoprene rubber hose or a

On my '81 1100, the right side fitting tapped into the gallery from the pump. This split to a
parallel gallery that ran to the filter cover mating surface. The stock cover had a recess that
allowed oil into the filter cavity. A non-recessed cover would block the gallery and force all oil
through the cooler. The cooler return emptied directly into the filter cavity.

Anyone with any experience with the GSX750 care to explain the chrome dome on the filter cover? It
looks like it might house a plunger to force oil through the non-existent cooler, but I don't know
that for a fact.

The pressure switch is a flap that senses the flow of oil into the gallery. You modify the housing

&gt;&gt; How was the connection to the crankcase breather made? Did you just fire

&gt;You could also drill a 1/4 or 5/16 inch hole in the camshaft cover and

&gt;You really don't need large diameter hoses (like 3/4ths or 1-inch) for

&gt;you get from the hoses.

&gt;It might look silly to some unenlightened bystanders, but all you

dangerous and was ordered abandoned and all did except for one police motor
that followed the perp everyplace he went... sidewalks... over curbs...
where ever. I believe the chase ended with the perp getting away but all of
the police motors were accounted for as having disengaged and the highly
skilled pursuit officer was theorized to have been a movie stunt man. This
was supposedly aired on tv and lots saw it... I'd love to find a tape or

&gt;COOL! Ride safe and have fun. I'll get out to the Wudi sometime. I'm
&gt;looking for a trials bike and another KZP at the moment, but am committed
&gt;to spending much much more time on my XR this year. It'll have to be a new
&gt;riding area, but that's my plan.

&gt;Please say hello to Deb for me... take care Jim!

&gt;Mike

&gt;&gt;Toodlelooo!  I'm off to the Ozark Mtns for a ride.

Mike,
This place (Brock Creek) is trials bike heaven.
I even have a Dunlop trials tire mounted on the rear of my GasGas
EC300  for this ride.

Come down this way anytime.
Give me some warning and I'll take some time off and show you some of
my riding places (and my sling blade).   &lt;G&gt;

Ride safe, Bro.

Some time in the early eighties I had a set of  Goodyears on a GS1100. They
had some sort of double lip bead retention system on the tire only. No
special rim required. Can't recall the name but clencher doesn't seem right.
Long time ago. I do remember highlighting the lettering with a paint stick.
By the time the tires were replaced RWL was common. Tossed the stick.

Turns out they were GT2.

I never owned one, but my friends would often show up on old
California Highway Patrol or Los Angeles Police Department KZP's that
they had bought at auction, and I would get a chance to ride one.

Another guy bought a new one for funeral escort use.
Last time I looked they were certainly the cheapest 1000cc machine.

One of my friends works as a car and motorcycle mechanic at Foothill
Division and we would talk about
the problems the officers had with chains that only lasted 4000 miles
when used for pursuit, etc.

While I was thinking about your oil cooler installation, another thing
that occurred to me was whether a heavy duty oil pump is available, or
if there were aftermarket
oil pump drive gears like Vance &amp; Hines sold for Suzukis.

Installing the V&amp;H oil pump gears doubled my GS-1100's oil pressure.

Low pressure system anyway, of course. Nobody ever said the old Z was a
weak engine, so I really wouldn't bother.

&gt; I'm presently looking for a &quot;practice bike&quot; to use for both drilling and
&gt; teaching police motor handling skills. I want to put an oil cooler on
&gt; this,
&gt; possibly with a thermostatically activated fan. These drills are hard on
&gt; the engine/clutch and almost all occur at low speeds. I know KZ/KZPs have
&gt; had oil coolers mounted on them over the years by their owners and am
&gt; trying to track down some photos to see what the installation details
&gt; looked like. My preference is the KZP but any KZ will be welcome. APBM is

run.

They did? Oh hang on a minute, are we talking the four-valver engines
here? In the UK the old two-volvers (with roller bearing cranks) were
all designated GS and the four-valvers (with plain bearing cranks) were
named GSX, but I have a feeling that in the US this didn't necessarily
apply.

The old two-valve engines were absolutely solid. Some of the
four-valvers did have the occasional hiccup.

Nope. The "X" had nothing to do with the type of bearings. The engine
number of my 1982 GS-1100EZ starts with "GSX". It has 4 valves per
cylinder and a roller bearing crankshaft.

The 1980 GS-1100 was designated GSX-1100ET,  the 1981 was designated
GSX-1100EX.

But the 1983 came back as a GSX-1100ED

OTOH, a Kan O' Tuna also has 4 valves per, and a plain bearing crank.

There's probably more about it on thegsresources.com, if anybody
really cares about the mystery of the "X"...

The Z-1 and KZ-1000 engines were the strongest built
I-4's I have ever seen.

A cottage industry grew up around Griffith Observatory in the 1980's.
Any rider who could afford to open a $mall $peed $hop was starting a
business.

One rider who was peddling big bore kits for extra money told me that
the Kawasaki engine was much more indestructible than the Suzuki
engine, but everybody who was messing with Suzukis was doing it
because they had 4 valves per cylinder.

He told me that he spent a lot of money just making his Suzuki engine
survive, and that he could have gotten the same power out of a
Kawasaki engine by buying more speed parts.

The old KZ1000 engine is still favored by drag racers, even the ones
who are buying cast iron cylinder blocks to bolt their billet cylinder
block onto. What's left, besides the crankshaft and the cylinder head,
filled with titanium valves and aftermarket cams?

My remarks about changing the oil pump gears were, of course, directed
at the OP who is studying ideas on how to install an oil cooler.

An oil cooler must inevitably rob some of the oil flow from the bottom
end and the camshafts. So the more flow he can get, the more cooling
effect he'll get from the oil cooler (if that's the way he chooses to
proceed).

Vance and Hines were interested in drag racing before they got into
road racing (now they are into Harleys) and drag racers needed lots of
oil flow to the top end to
meet the lubrication needs of the cam lobes.

Racers would install more radical camshafts and run the engines at
higher RPM, up to an incredible 15K with fully modified 1425cc drag
race Suzukis.

Since they ran the quarter mile with *cold* engines to enhance
compression and even set up cylinders with  *zero* piston clearance
for the same reason, and they really never got the engine as hot as
road racing endurance engine might get, they would install the high
speed oil pump gears and a restrictor which made more oil flow to the
cam shafts.

The GS-1100 motors came with incredibly weak valve springs that would
hardly seat the valves. If you got the engine really hot with
petroleum oil, the wax would actually stick to the lobe of the
camshaft on the closing side, and the tappet wouldn't even wipe the
wax off.

Wilder camshafts required stiffer valve springs, and the springs
increased rubbing friction on the cams and tappets, so more oil flow
was indicated for that reason.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

One guy told me that the speed shop who modified his his engine for
him told him to never idle the engine when the bike was on the side
stand, not just when it was hot.

But, he probably had a mild grind V&amp;H cam in the engine. He bragged to
me that the motorcycle came on hard around 9000 RPM in 3rd gear, and
he was amazed that I was effortlessly keeping up with him on my stock
GS-1100.

He concluded that he just might have wasted his money
at that speed shop. Other riders actually talked about
hurting the speed shop owner because of the poor quality work he did.
