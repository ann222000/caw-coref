Washington actions
would have any positive effect on Congress. --If anything, the
demonstrations may well harden congressional resistance and create an
atmosphere conducive not only to the victory of reactionary candidates
in the coming elections, but also to the defeat of those candidates who
are, or would be, friendly to the social and economic objectives of our
struggle.-- Logan was also concerned that King and SCLC would not --be
able to preserve the non-violent image and integrity of our
organization-- once the protests got under way. Given the --explosive
potential of the situation,-- serious violence would be inevitable.
--You say, Martin, that you ?will use disruptive tactics only as a last
resort? . . . but you understand, of course,-- Logan asserted, --that in
view of the likely police response to these disruptive tactics, you are
in effect saying that you are prepared to court violence as a last
resort.-- Logan was also --troubled and unhappy [emphasis mine] at how
inadequately-- the planning had been handled so far --It does not appear
to me, or to anyone with whom I have talked, that an adequate job has
been done.-- And --there is the question of objectives. Have they been
clarified? Have you worked out what you will accept, short of your total
objectives . . . ?--

In response to Logan's admonitions, King phoned her almost daily for
more than a week in an unsuccessfull effort to persuade her to withdraw
the complaints, which she had sent to the entire SCLC board. Andrew
Young joined in the attempt, writing Logan and her husband, Arthur, that
--we are too far gone to turn around-- on the campaign. --This is very
much a faith venture . . . -- [emphasis mine)
