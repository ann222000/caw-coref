Kim Jong-il's military-first policy
By Kim Myong-chol

July 11, 2007 http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/IG11Dg02.html

(snip)

The Korean People's Army, which has a proud history of being the first
to outfight the once-invincible US armed forces, is capable of badly
mauling them again in both asymmetrical and modern warfare. The KPA's
newly formed rapid-response strike force can go into action at a
minute's notice to torch any remotest target on the US proper from all
sides.

Three facts illustrate the awesome destructive potential of the KPA.
May 1993 saw the KPA launching two long-range missiles over Japan, one
splashing down off Honolulu and the other off Guam. Last July, the KPA
test-fired mock nuclear-warhead-carrying missiles, all intended to
fall within Korean waters. The detonation last October of a mini-nuke
showed the extent and sophistication of North Korea's nuclear
technology, removing a long-kept veil of strategic ambiguity.

Now that North Korea has emerged as a nuclear-weapons state on its own
accord, it is capable of single-handedly deterring the US from
launching a preemptive strike on it. It can afford to forgo a peace
treaty and normalized relations with the superpower. As things have
turned out, the first nuclear test by North Korea has gone a long way
toward removing the divided Korean Peninsula furthest from dark clouds
of war than any other time since the Korean War and facilitated direct
talks between Pyongyang and Washington.

The writer has a Korean name.  Perhaps he overstates his case.  But
nonetheless no US politician or general is about to go charging in for
a fight just because he doesn't like Kim junior's haircut.  And that
is the DPRK's objective.

That is it in a nub, you need to spend enormous percentages of your
national wealth to acquire a weapon which you cannot deliver. &quot;Off
Honolulu&quot; is about 3500 miles short of that target in the Sea of Japan
and whatever was sent&quot;off&quot; Guam never left. That &quot;mini Nuke&quot; last July

I had much earlier in another post assessed the value of the nuke as a
defensive weapon against an enemy who wants to invade or regime change
one's homeland.   Say Saddam had a few  small nukes.  Would a US
general send in several brigades to the gates of Bhagdad and risk
having Saddam setting one off there among the US invasion force?   Its
his (Saddam's) homeland and its his capital being attacked.  He is
certainly within his rights under any rule of law to defend himself on
his own land.  Likewise if Saddam had nuke armed rockets with a modest
600 mile range, would the USN dare to station any carrier group in the
Mediterranean or the Straits of Hormuz, etc. to launch strikes against
Iraq?  Not likely.  For the same reasons no US president or politician
will advocate an invasion of a nuke armed country based on trumped up
evidence and hype.  War will have to be based on real threats and no
government is ever crazy enough to threaten to attack the US mainland
dierectly.

Read the full Asia Times story.  DPRK is shutting down its nuclear
reactor and therefore its supply of more bomb material..  It feels
safe enough that it has the few nukes necessary to establish the above
stand off.  Objective established the DPRK can afford to reduce its
military expenditures and tend to her other   needs.  If this is
indeed the DPRK's objective and result it will be an admirable and
amazing achievent not lost on the world's other small powers.

But once he uses nukes, the US would be within its rights to utilize

So it all depends on just how badly you'd think Saddam would want to
burn and glow.

Really.

Were the North Korean people equally happy when Japan suspended rice aid, or
when South Korea cut off all agricultural aid?

Are the North Koreans walking taller now that they've had all aid cut off
and have to feed themselves without any foreign assistance?

Question.  Over the past 60 years how many times had the US provided
aid to NK?   How many times had the US tried to starve them out
through global embargoes?  Overall did NK get to eat enough or did the
US actions caused them to suffer from malnutrition on many occasions.
Starving a country unfriendly to the US is a wellknown instrument of
US foreign policy.  Cuba, Saddam's Iraq,  Iran, Myammar, African
countries, China before Nixon's visit.  Huh?

Just like you to be the principal cause of their problems and then
blame your victims for their misfortunes.

Food aid to DPRK was and is provided by ROK and by China.  China's aid
is for sefl preservation for she does not want desperate starving
Korean refugees swarming over the border.  There is a large ethnic
Korean population in the Chinese provinces abutting NK that will get
restless.  ROK aid including food aid would have been much more if not
for US pressure.

Not irrelevant. According to
http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/050913/13world.htm the US in the
decade prior to 2005 provided $600 million of $2 billion total food aid to
North Korea. Apart from ROK and PRC, who are presumably supplying most of
the rest, this means that the United States is one of the major reasons why
North Koreans eat.

Seems to me that the major cause of North Korean misfortune is a fanatic
Communist regime. That has nothing to do with the US. Last I checked the
practical execise of communism in every country that has tried it has led to
misery, economic ruin, human-rights violations, and anguish.

Their governments made it clear that they wanted the USA to go
Communist.  The American and British public did not want that level of
exploitation by the politicians nor the incompetence.

The British people got rid of the feudal system several hundred years
ago and did not want it bring back.  Even in the Middle Ages town
dwellers were not surfs.

$600 million over a decade.  Or $60 million per year in the kindest
interpretation.  Often this was not forthcoming until international
pressure forced the issue.  $600 million out of $2 billion.  That's 30

contributions outside the UN mechanism and therefore unreported yours
will probably be 10 or 20 cents on the dollar.  And all that was no

&gt;George W. Bush announced his opposition to the Agreed Framework during his candidacy. Following his inauguration in January 2001, the new Administration began a review of North Korea policy. At the conclusion of that review, the Administration announced on June 6, 2001, that it had decided to pursue continued dialogue with North Korea on the full range of issues of concern to the Administration, including North Korea's conventional force posture, missile development and export programs, human rights practices, and humanitarian issues. In 2002, the Administration asserted that North Korea was developing a uranium enrichment program for nuclear weapons purposes. U.S.-D.P.R.K. tensions mounted when Bush categorized North Korea as part of the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; in his 2002 State of the Union address.

Bush reneged on every agreement Clinton made to the North Korean and
no aid was provided to NK in Bush 's administration.  Instead NK was
threatened with death and desgtruction  if it did not....xxxxx.    No
aid reached DPRK for the last ten years because by the time Clinton
reached an agreement his term was ending and  Bush came in.  Suffice
to say that DPRK played its nuclear bomb and missile launcher very
well.  DPRK got what it wanted (the US to back off from threats of
war) and Bush didn't get any of the objectives he had set out for DPRK
at the start of his administration.  Look up the archives on Asia
Times Online if you wat to get an authorative analysis.  You will
never read anything of substance in your media.

Remember, the discussion here is why small nations want the nuke.
DPRK proved its case.   Frankly I think the DPRK bomb is a squib and
its missile a dud.  But they did the job.  Bush backed down.

&gt; True.  But in what way are they a threat to the US that your country
&gt; has to starve them?
">

How has the US done that? I pointed out in a post to Fred that the US has
forked out over $600 million of $2 billion total food aid to NK in the
decade prior to 2005, and as far as know, the US hasn't been stinting since
2005 either. If there is any one country that has possibly provided more
food aid to NK it is China, but the PRC has an ulterior motive - there are
lots of ethnic Koreans in northern China, and they wouldn't much like their
relatives starving to death.

Tell me exactly how the US has starved people? I think if you look at the
historical record that the United States has dispensed astonishing largesse
at very little compensation to itself. Unfortunately a great deal of that
aid has been tainted by going through dubious channels (corrupt local
officials), and also there is a tendency of people helped to piss on the
people who helped them.

Seriously, though - point me to an instance of where the US tried to starve
a country. Try hard. You're talking about a country that along with the
British, Canadians, Ozzies, Kiwis, South Africans and French went balls out
to mount a massive airlift operation to supply a capital city in 1948 and
early 1949. 278,228 flights, 2,326,406 tons of supplies, and a lot of good
aircrew killed. It hasn't changed since.

What it is is sour grapes. If there is a country on the planet that has
delivered more aid than the United States I'd like to find out who it is.
That's not to denigrate other countries that contribute according to their
means, but the fact remains, the US over the years has expended stupendous
capital in securing areas and making people's lives better. Of course, to
listen to the other side, all the US does is napalm civilians. Those idiots
have never seen a combined party of USN sailors and USMC Marines that
instead of spending a day partying in foreign bars instead packs a bunch of
engineering equipment, paint, tools etc and heads up to a deserving local
school or medical clinic that needs to be repaired, and at the end of the
day retires to crappy bunks on ship feeling like they actually did good for
once. Most normal American military people (I count myself among them) would
rather do that kind of thing than bomb people. Believe it or not.

With respect to Iraq that is precisely bullshit. Saddam seems to have had no
problem in building many large palaces and maintaining a very large military
and paramilitary...all while under the blockade. Fact of the matter is that
Saddam did not give a shit about his fellow countrymen, no more than Stalin
or Hitler did. The foreign aid was there - it just didn't get to the people
that needed it.

As for Cuba, give me a break. The fucking country could be a success story
and instead it's a basket case because of Fidel and Communism. It doesn't
even have anything to do with a US economic blockade, because almost
everyone else trades with Cuba. The fact is that Cuba is fucked because it
still operates on a command economy. The PRC only started to pick up its
boots once it recognized free enterprise. Cuba has yet to really to do that,
which is why it's still screwed.

Let me put it this way - I have visited Cuba about 5 times. When I did I
felt safe, because I had six 155mm howitzers on base, another dozen mortars,
the largest minefields east of South Korea, and about 300-400 Marines. If I
visited the rest of Cuba I wouldn't feel safe at all, because it is a
communist fuckup. Sort of like China.

Yes, and they were travelling on Canadian passports and probably staying at
sanitized resorts. No small number of those resorts for Westerners have
pretty extensive security forces on the perimeters and further out, just so
the problems of the countryside don't intrude on tourist dollars.

Not many Canadians going to Cuba actually encounter the &quot;people&quot;. If they
did somehow escape the reservation and visit a little farming village or
sneak into a Havana slum, they'd certainly encounter the people, and it
probably wouldn't be pleasant. After all, a Canadian or European means
dollars on the hoof.

I was making a joke about me, Nilita, primarily. As in, I was being ironic.
The entire time that I was in the Marines I could have used my Canadian
passport to visit Cuba while I took leave, and pass on my microfilm to my
controller in State Security. Just as in theory I could have done the same
to visit Estonia when it was still a Soviet republic. Fact is I did neither
because I was a serving US Marine and it was requested that I not do that.

For your information, the Cuban military manages a number of hotels in the
tourist sector. This is fact. I have some Canadian acquaintances who will
testify to that, so it's not just US State Dept info. Ask yourself the
question - why does a country's armed forces need to manage hotels for
foreign tourists unless they are worried that they can't control (1) the
tourists and (2) the population.

Holidays to Cuba are being heavily promoted on UK Television currently.

A quick internet search shows
http://www.theholidayplace.com/holidays.asp?a=18025554_752694681&amp;i;=CU#ab
that accepts bookings for approximatley seventy hotels ,seemingly scattered
about the landscape, costing between £600 ~ £1000 per nine nights ... .

The tourist agents mention;-
&lt;quote&gt;Although tourism is growing, Cuba is largely unspoilt and you can
still escape from it all on a secluded beach far from the crowd. &lt;/quote&gt;
Folks, I know, have mentioned hiring a vehicle in Cuba and doing the tourist
'bit'.

http://www.novelacuba.com/nc/car.aspx?gclid=CL3z4eDMsY0CFSUnEAodDyqfuA
shows rentals for a vehicle as approx six-seven hundred Euro per week.

The tourist agent's website does caution &lt;quote&gt; Please note Walkie-Talkies,
GPS and satellite communication devices are not permitted in Cuba, in any
format. Such items are likely to be confiscated and incur a large fee for
release. For most updated information please visit official Cuba Customs
Website.&lt;/quote&gt;

It's hard to reconcile stories off folk I know with your unsubstantiated

&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; Let me put it this way - I have visited Cuba about 5 times. When I did
&gt;&gt;&gt; I felt safe, because I had six 155mm howitzers on base, another dozen
&gt;&gt;&gt; mortars, the largest minefields east of South Korea, and about 300-400
&gt;&gt;&gt; Marines. If I visited the rest of Cuba I wouldn't feel safe at all,
&gt;&gt;&gt; because it is a communist fuckup. Sort of like China.

&gt;&gt; Really?  I've had lots of friends who have visited Cuba, and they've
&gt;&gt; really enjoyed it and the people.  My daughter tentatively is planning to
&gt;&gt; spend a week there before the fall.

&gt;&gt; - ni

&gt; Yes, and they were travelling on Canadian passports and probably staying at
&gt; sanitized resorts. No small number of those resorts for Westerners have
&gt; pretty extensive security forces on the perimeters and further out, just so
&gt; the problems of the countryside don't intrude on tourist dollars.

Are there no Cuban expats around that one can ask? I know a couple of
Cubans over here in Tokyo teaching salsa dancing, none of them want to

Peter, I think you know that I am no paranoid. It's a simple fact that Cuban
resorts are guarded by Cuban police and Cuban military, and many of the
hotels are actually run by the Cuban military. Unless you wish to dispute
the Wall Street Journal
( http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116356024065223514.html?mod=todays_us... )
or the US State Department (who also advises that many hotels are actually
run by the Cuban military). Last I checked the US State department was
pretty liberal and factual.

This is substantiated by the US State Department, which is actually fairly
neutral on things like this. Gaviota SA would be the specific Cuban military
operation that manages hotels.

Fact of the matter is that when Canadians or Europeans visit sunny Cuba they
are pumping dollars right into the Cuban military, and even helping to prop
up that despicable regime. But I guess it's OK if you don't know that you
are doing that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brian

&gt;&gt;&gt; Err, Brian, I like you and generally find you a sympathetic ear. Are you
&gt;&gt;&gt; seriously saying that you didn't know that resorts in Cuba for Western
&gt;&gt;&gt; tourists aren't guarded by the Cuban police and Cuban military? Like in
&gt;&gt;&gt; a major way? Because they are.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Arved
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately; Arved. as I've said in the parts you've snipped,  what
&gt;&gt; you've written doesn't track with what people who have taken holidays in
&gt;&gt; Cuba have said to me.

&gt;&gt; I asked you to substantiate your statements - you haven't !

&gt;&gt; I'm unable to determine why you've evaded giving any answer.

&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter one iota _what_ I know -&quot;you didn't know that resorts
&gt;&gt; in Cuba for Western  tourists aren't guarded by the Cuban police and
&gt;&gt; Cuban military? &quot;  ... _You_ stated that    &quot; .... country's (Cuban)
&gt;&gt; armed forces &quot;need to manage hotels for foreign tourists unless they are
&gt;&gt; worried that they can't control (1)  the tourists and (2) the
&gt;&gt; population.&quot;. [Which you seem to have downgraded to &quot;guarded by the Cuban
&gt;&gt; police and Cuban military&quot;.]

&gt;&gt; Now -if you _know_ and wish to spread the allegation you made 'For your
&gt;&gt; information, the Cuban military manages a number of hotels in the tourist
&gt;&gt; sector...&quot;; please give chapter and verse;  For instance what formation
&gt;&gt; is it in the military that manages  &quot; a number of hotels in  the tourist
&gt;&gt; sector&quot; ? Is it the 'Corps of Red Coats?&quot; [UK insiders references ] or is
&gt;&gt; it the feared 'Maplin's Yellow Coats' ? Is this military 'hotel
&gt;&gt; management' headed by a General (one star?. two star? .... is it a
&gt;&gt; separate corps? what is the branch of service insignia? ... silver
&gt;&gt; service?

&gt;&gt; Last time I displayed my Anglo body to the scorn of the carioca on
&gt;&gt; Copacabana - the beach was patrolled by Naval Military Police - [there's
&gt;&gt; a peculiarity of Brasilian Law that all property within three hundred
&gt;&gt; metres(?) of the  high water mark is the property of the Navy- something
&gt;&gt; to do with cannon fire ]. Is Brasil somewhere I should fear?
&gt;&gt; Last time I spent some days in New York City -as a tourist- I noted the
&gt;&gt; plethora of patrol officers of the NYPD apparently 'guarding' the hotels
&gt;&gt; ... like in a major way ... because they are!

&gt;&gt; I don't know what to believe .... but I do not  that unsubstantiated
&gt;&gt; propaganda comes from both sides ... the truth is usually not reported in
&gt;&gt; the media.

&gt;&gt; Brian

&gt; http://ctp.iccas.miami.edu/FOCUS_Web/Issue46.htm

&gt; This is substantiated by the US State Department, which is actually fairly
&gt; neutral on things like this. Gaviota SA would be the specific Cuban
&gt; military operation that manages hotels.

&gt; Fact of the matter is that when Canadians or Europeans visit sunny Cuba
&gt; they are pumping dollars right into the Cuban military, and even helping
&gt; to prop up that despicable regime. But I guess it's OK if you don't know
&gt; that you are doing that.

&gt; AHS
">

Why have you not responded to my comments on the presence of NYPD patrol
officers 'guarding' tourist in NYC? I it because you realise how paranoid
your statement that  '
hotels in Cuba are '.... guarded by the Cuban police &quot;.
Having read the article(s) concerning Gaviota SA' I now see that it's
apparently a _JOINT_ venture between a Cuban Development organisation and
several European outfits fr'instance Club Med  (French).  I wonder which
'partner' pulls the strings and determines the level of service
agreement --- number of  muggings within ? Kilometres of the hotel
boundary'? Number of homicides permitted per week?  Does the NYPD have any
such collaboration with hotel operators - one wonders?

Although I have no intention of travelling there myself - surely I do wonder
why you only mentioned 'Canadians and Europeans' visiting Cuba - Did you
mean to imply that only the citizens of the self-proclaimed 'Land of the
Free' are forbidden by their government from visiting Cuba?

&gt;Peter, I think you know that I am no paranoid. It's a simple fact that Cuban
&gt;resorts are guarded by Cuban police and Cuban military, and many of the
&gt;hotels are actually run by the Cuban military. Unless you wish to dispute
&gt;the Wall Street Journal

&gt;or the US State Department (who also advises that many hotels are actually

&gt;pretty liberal and factual.
">

You have stated fact, except for the last sentence, which boggles
the imagination. The Wall Street Journal is a right wing rag
politically which has more than once published absolute trash
about Cuba.

Who in hell do you think would protect resorts in Cuba? Who
protects them in any other country?

You are aware that the Cuban army runs a lot of Cuban businesses,
it is a communist state, after all.

Now consider whether the data you have suggests that the extra
protection afforded the Cuban resorts is more than in the
Bahamas, St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, Barbados, or even Miami.
Be careful in your answer, I've worked in all those places except
Miami where an uncle and his family live.

In Cuba, one can simply wander off the grounds of at least three
resorts, (take taxis into town from two of them). I have not
wandered around Havana but my son and my in-laws both have, on
different occasions. (When I chose to take an evening stroll in
Barbados, they sent a guard dog with me.)

You need to get out more.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for foreign tourists unless they are worried that they can't
&gt;control
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (1)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the tourists and (2) the population.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Arved

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you give names and locations for these hotels?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or, is the _information_ only to be shared with a select few?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It'll perhaps help people who might be contemplating taking
&gt;holidays
&gt;&gt; &gt;on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cuba.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brian

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Err, Brian, I like you and generally find you a sympathetic ear. Are
&gt;&gt; &gt;you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;seriously saying that you didn't know that resorts in Cuba for
&gt;Western
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;tourists aren't guarded by the Cuban police and Cuban military? Like
&gt;in
&gt;&gt; &gt;a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;major way? Because they are.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Nonsense, you need to get out more.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Peter, I think you know that I am no paranoid. It's a simple fact that
&gt;&gt; &gt;Cuban
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;resorts are guarded by Cuban police and Cuban military, and many of
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;hotels are actually run by the Cuban military. Unless you wish to
&gt;dispute
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the Wall Street Journal

&gt;&gt;&gt;( http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116356024065223514.html?mod=todays_us...
&gt;e
&gt;&gt; &gt;_one)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;or the US State Department (who also advises that many hotels are
&gt;&gt; &gt;actually
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;run by the Cuban military). Last I checked the US State department was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;pretty liberal and factual.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You have stated fact, except for the last sentence, which boggles
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the imagination. The Wall Street Journal is a right wing rag
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; politically which has more than once published absolute trash
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about Cuba.

&gt;&gt; &gt;I see that you didn't bother reading the article.

&gt;&gt; Care to attempt to support that statement?

&gt;I read the rest of your post.

&gt;&gt; You are a subscriber,
&gt;&gt; I take it.

&gt;Yes, and occassionally I even read the editorial page - however the linked
&gt;article by Jose de Cordoba (he's a previous winner of the Maria Moors Cabot
&gt;Prize) didn't appear in that section.
">

So you can't support your contention? If winning that particular
prize doesn't label him, just what would in yourm opinion?

For the audience, google &quot;Jose de Corba Wall Street Journal&quot; and
follow a few of the links to get an idea of the quality of this
source. Do it right now, both of you.

I have no patience with people niggling about spelling errors either, Peter.

The fundamental point is that the Cuban military operates a lot of the Cuban
economy, including the tourist sector. This should not be a major surprise -
it's a communist country. In a totalitarian regime the military and police
do tend to operate much of the economy.
