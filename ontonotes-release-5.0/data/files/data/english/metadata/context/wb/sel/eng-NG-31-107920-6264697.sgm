I'm trying to think when a World Champion last went out showing that he
could and would still be competitive. Like him or loath him,
yesterday's drive from Schumacher showed that he still has pace and
still has it in him to race. He's retiring before he either dies or
goes on past the sell-by date and makes a fool of himself.

So who else *retired* at or near the top of their game?

Prost in 1993 perhaps? It's not clear that he drove much at 10/10 that
year, he did just what he had to do to win the championship but he did
not disgrace himself.

And then  before that was Jackie Stewart in 1973. Stewart had made up
his mind at the start of the season that he would retire at the end -
no matter what happened. He told only Ken Tyrell and kept it secret
from his wife in case she go through too much emotional turmoil - or so
legend has it. Stewart won the championship and drove well that year.

Schumacher has done what not too many top sportsmen do - retire when he
was still good enough to be missed.

Mika Hakkinen is the one I can't make up my mind about. He never came
back from a sabbatical - though it may be that he was kept hanging on
by contractual factors that bound him to undertake promotional duties
for McLaren and/or Mercedes.

2        M Häkkinen
1        M Hawthorn, J Clark, J Brabham, D Hulme, N Lauda, &amp; N Piquet

Alonso was competitive, 2nd is a pretty good result and way better
than he needed. He's done it all season.  Hakkinen did the same, as
did Prost and Senna.

It was a pretty piss poor performance, 7th in qualifying was ok but
when Trulli can get 3rd it's nothing to write home about.

Ralf has been past his sell by date for years, he's always making a
fool of himself.

He only did 9 laps and then retired, it's not permanent, he'll be back
next year at the wheel of his Toyota, anyway why are you going on
about Schumacher in a thread about Champions?

How many champions retired whilst driving THE top car ?
Its an unfair question really, what if schumacher starts his own team and
drives a poor car like Graham Hill? Would it be fair to remember him that
way? when its obvious schumacher could have gone on winning with ferrari
until he was in his 40's
If you forget Mansell climbing in an aweful McLaren, then Adelaide 1994 was
a good way to remember him, out qualifying schumacher and winning the race
aged 42.

He apparently had mental health problems, or something. That from a DTM
commentator.
