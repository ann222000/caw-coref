Hi,
I've just rolled out my first horde and got the quests done upto Hillsbrad,
now I'm drawing blanks on where to go to next.

I'd like to carry on increasing my rep with Under City if possible but thats
not modt important.
I'd rather be questing than grinding out in Hillsbrad to level up, any ideas
where I can go to next?

Thanks.

My undead warrior is 26. I have seen some quests in Camp Taurajo, in the
barrens. In Stonetalon some quests are green, but I still have some yellow
quests. There is Ashenvale, too. I don't have any quests from 1000 needles
yet, but I think you can do some.

I would go to 1Kneedles. This is south of CT. You can make a couple of
quests there and at LVL29+ you can go east to the shimmering flats.
There are lots of quests that you can make until you reach LVL34-35.

You should also go to the instance Kral of Razorfen. Which is good for
27+. Entry is near the lift at 1Kneedles.

You won´t make much reputation points with UC, but if you did all
quests at TM, you should be good at that anyway. You could go
to the Scarlet Monastery after the shimmering flats. I guess you´ll
make some UC reputations points there.

I you want the dead horse, you can do all the quests from the forsaken
(even the quests in the starting zone, I don't know if you have already
done them).

There are some quests in Thunderbluff, given by the forsaken, too.

There are some forsaken around the world that will give you some rep. :

- In Duskwood, near the old tower next to road who lead to deadwind pass.
You'll have to be 35-40, don't remember exactly.

- A ghost in a farm, near the first field in the plaguelands (that's for
your 50th levels ;)).

These two are easily missed.

After the wool donation, there is silk, magewave, and runecloth. Only the
runecloth can be repeated.

I think you can search for quests by reputation gain in some website
(wowhead maybe?). I did it with my troll, and search the quests like that,
but it was a french site.

Sounds to me like you missed the (single and rather too-well-hidden)
quest in Silverpine that would have sent you to the Barrens at about
level 12, and would have opened up a raft of quest lines to keep you
busy and entertained. If you've the patience, I'd suggest going now.
Go to Crossroads, talk to everyone in sight (most of the quests will
be grey by now, and you certainly won't be getting yellow quest
indicators for them) and spend a few hours catching up on a few of
them - at level 27, you should rip through most of them fast enough.
Chat to people in any new places you come to, too.  By the end of that
you should have quests in half a dozen different areas, a good feel
for how those parts of the world fit together, and no shortage of new
things to do to keep you busy.

It wasn't perhaps always the case when the game first came out, but by
now there's enough quest content in there that, if you find yourself
running out of ones to do, you've almost certainly missed something
somewhere.

Cheers - Ian

if you collect 30 PVP-marks each from Alterac, Warsong and
Arathi Basin, you can exchange this for a Epic PVP boney horse.

But I think you got to be LVL60 for that.

Up &quot;to&quot; Hillsbrad, or &quot;through&quot; Hillsbrad?  There are
several undead quests in Hillsbrad itself.  Do those.

If you just want rep, then you can do quests that give
undead rep at any time.  If you skip any, you can go
back and do them even if the quest is gray and the
quest giver no longer has an &quot;!&quot; over his head.  Then
just check the web databases to find all the quests
that give undead rep and do the ones that you missed...

Good luck trying to get exalted.  I have a night elf
who quested in all the night elf zones (darkshore,
ashenvale, felwood, ferelas, etc).  I may have missed
some night elf quests, but not very many (didn't do
Dire Maul for one).  So I hit level 60, and check my
reps, and I'm only reverred with night elves.  I'm
a sliver away from being exalted.  Not that it matters
for me, but I was kind of surprised.  So if anyone
wants cross-race mounts at level 60, it will take
a lot more work than just doing all the obvious quests
for that race.  (though I hear that post-TBC some
low level quests give more rep now)

I think that changed with BC. My Drainai Hunter was maybe
at LVL21 when a message came up &quot;you are now honoured with
the fraction Alliance&quot;. This is not to be seen on the
Menu, it is just a Message that comes in the chat-box once.
He was at that time more or less honoured with all 4-5 basic
alliance groups.
