"Dems abandon war authority provision"

WASHINGTON - Democratic leaders are stripping from a military spending
bill for the war in        Iraq a requirement that        President
Bush gain approval from Congress before moving against        Iran.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (news, bio, voting record), D-Calif., and
other leaders agreed to remove the requirement concerning Iran after
conservative Democrats as well as other lawmakers worried about its
possible impact on        Israel, officials said Monday.

The Iran-related proposal stemmed from a desire to make sure Bush did
not launch an attack without going to Congress for approval, but drew
opposition from numerous members of the rank and file in a series of
closed-door sessions last week.

Rep. Shelley Berkley (news, bio, voting record), D-Nev., said in an
interview that there is widespread fear in Israel about Iran, which is
believed to be seeking nuclear weapons and has expressed unremitting
hostility about the Jewish state.

"It would take away perhaps the most important negotiating tool that
the U.S. has when it comes to Iran," she said of the now-abandoned
provision.

"I didn't think it was a very wise idea to take things off the table
if you're trying to get people to modify their behavior and normalize
it in a civilized way," said Rep. Gary Ackerman (news, bio, voting
record), D-N.Y.

Several officials said there was widespread opposition to the proposal
at a closed-door meeting last week of conservative and moderate
Democrats, who said they feared tying the hands of the administration
when dealing with an unpredictable and potentially hostile regime in
Tehran.
