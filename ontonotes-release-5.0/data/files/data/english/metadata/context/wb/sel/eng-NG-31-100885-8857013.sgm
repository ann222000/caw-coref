Hi!  I'm new to this site.  I have a ~3.5 yr.  female albino lop ear (she is
spade).  Last night I noticed her straining &amp; actually moaning a little when
trying to pee...which she did pee but, just a little bit at a time, and would
try 3-4 times in a row....then stop.  I have noticed her private area (for
lack of a technical term) soaked w/her pee the last few days.  And, I started
looking on-line for help &amp; found out about &quot;urine scold&quot; So, last night I
gave her a &quot;butt bath&quot; while I was running warm water over her area..I did
notice her pee a little then too.  Then of course I dried the area w/a towel
&amp; then blow dryer (being very careful to make sure it was not hot on her very
sensitive skin).  She seemed to be soothed from the bath &amp; didn't complain,
or thump at me when I sat her back down.
First thing this morning I took her to vet which gave me 1ml/day for 5
days of Baytril antibiotic in her water (as of this moment I don't see that
she has drank much if at all).  She seems to be eating normal..I've given
fresh &amp; clean veggies, kale, baby carrots...tried yogurt chips &amp; then
straight plain yogurt (but, she does not like &amp; will not eat).  She eats
Timothy hay everyday.  I use to just feed her commercial pellets &amp; Timothy
hay w/treats of 1 bagel chip each morning (she loves! &amp; the vet said she
didn't think that was a problem).  The reason I stopped giving her fresh
veggies everyday is she would get sticky, gooey poop stuck to her bottom &amp;
thus everywhere she hopped... &amp; I liked her to get out &amp; be w/us in the house
so, I stopped &amp; went w/the commercial food &amp; Timothy...
Oh, and she seemed to 'soak' the towel in the carrier I took her in this
morning but, I am very worried as again I still see her straining w/a little
moan (which shoots fear straight to my gut) and not being productive w/any
pee but, may get out a few wet pellets.  So, it looks like the last time she
peed was this morning &amp; she hasn't drink much if at all but, is eating.
Everything else about her mannerisms seem to be normal.  She is really
loving the extra attention as I have been a very worried mamma.
What do y'all think?  I was thinking of taking some pedialyte in a syringe
(minus the needle of course!) &amp; putting at the side of her mouth to take some
liquid.

Is your vet rabbit savvy?  If not, I would get a second opinion. I
would have your rabbit checked for a bladder sludge or perhaps a
kidney stone.

Rabbits are prone to bladder stones.

Of course, I do not know if that is what she has, but it sounds as if
your vet may not be sure either.

If the vet did not test the urine for bacteria, that an infection is the
cause of the problem is just a guess, IMO.

The suggestion to see if you can find a better, more rabbit-savvy vet is
a good one, also IMO.

Where are you?

Someone here may have someone to recommend, or you can check the House
Rabbit Society's vet list for the US.

Also Arlette maintains a worldwide vet list here:

Good luck, and please let us know the results.

Thank you for the reply.
Not sure about how savvy (as I am still new to the area) but, she was
one of the 2 at this 'exotic' pet clinic that had training in rabbits.
Although, the other vet that usually looked at rabbits was not in.  She felt
around and said she didn't feel anything that would indicate a stone.  She
said if she didn't get better in a few days to then bring her in and then she
would have to be x-rayed to see if she has a stone(s).  She thinks it is a
urinary tract infection.  I just gave her another bath &amp; I noticed she peed
some more while the warm water was running over her...the warm water I think
is soothing to her...and I haven't noticed the thick &quot;toothpaste&quot; looking
type pee as associated w/sludge (so I read anyway) I also put vaseline on her
delicate red skin that is irritated.  It looks like she has drunk more of her
antibotic water.. which I see her sniffing &amp; not sure of so, I filled it up
for the evening.  Oh, and good news..turns out she does like the berry
flavored yogurt chips (but, not plain yogurt)..I'm hoping that will help
w/the infected looking area down there...almost looks a bit 'yeasty'.  I also
set out a heating pad w/a thin blanket over it &amp; coaxed her to sit beside me
on it...but, she doesn't seem to interested in the heating pad (whatever that
means)...I was hoping it would be soothing to her in some way.

Thank you for the reply.  I checked out the site &amp; didn't see any
recommendations for Huntsville, AL...just Birmingham &amp; Mobil (both long ways).
I'll definitely keep you posted.

Ninny,
I agree also that you need to have a vet who knows what they are doing,
however, if this vet feels that it is a bladder infection and has prescribed
Baytrill, I'm surprised that she didn't tell you to give it to her by
syringe(without the needle of course) ... just draw up the required dosage
and slowly squirt it into the side of her mouth between the front and back
teeth. This way you'll know she is getting her medication. You could add
some water to the dose also or just give her a few syringefulls a day of
water or pedialyte (as you had thought of doing)  if you feel she isn't
drinking enough. She really does need the fluids to flush her kidneys and
bladder. If she doesn't drink, it may be necessary to give her some fluids
subQ (just under the skin) The vet can do this and can also teach you to do
it at home if necessary.

Totally agree with Dori.

When I am dosing by syringe, I hold the rabbit in my lap, facing my
knees.  I gently  put my left hand over her head, using thumb and middle
finger to find the gap behind front teeth on both sides of her mouth.

I press in gently to open mouth then squirt medicine slowly into gap
with my right hand (pre-loaded syringe, of course).

I think you will feel better knowing your rabbit is getting the full
dose of medicine that was prescribed.

And hopefully, the rabbit will feel better, too, because the presumed
infection is being treated.

Poor little thing!  Bladder infections *hurt*!!

sounds like she has sludge. get lots of fluids in if you can..
also, and it works great.. she needs to absorb the calcium she is
eating. magnesium is needed right now. go to walmart or something like
it if you have one. and get 250mg of magnesium and some cranberry
extract gels.  giev her half the tab. crushed and squeeze out the
contents of two gel caps cranberry in syringe. use as little water as
possible to make sure you get it all in. do this once a day. i had to to
this for about two months for angelica.  if she will eat it, give her a
half a walnut  per day.. this will give her what she needs.
angelica had this same problem, hopefully there are not any stones yet.
it took four days of her sitting in her litter box non stop for it to
clear. time will vary depending on your bun..
it is very simple. calcium needs magnesium to absorb... period.. i have
been using it since the beggining of the year when it was suggested to
me. the cranberry will help with any infection  and is good all around
anyway...  i hope you have a good rabbit vet. if not. post at apr and we
can help to find you one if we can. are you using benebac? acidophilous?

if it is just a uti, the meds should get her peeing in a couple days or
so back to normal..harley took three days.
sometimes at the beggining of the sludge, you might not see any white
stuff. it kinda gathers inside and builds up. jelly just had a small
amount of white&quot;powder&quot;. the simple thing i did got it all better
whithout vet visit. i did concult with him..
cranberries will help uti too..  try to relax and not fixate on her. i
tend to do that one. as long as she is eating etc..  she should be just
fine soon

I did as you suggested and gave her the 1cc this morning in her mouth..I do
feel much better knowing that she got the majority of it.  I also put
Pedialyte in her water bottle.  I heard her drinking this morning too.

Thank you, Beth.  I do need to relax about it &amp; not fixate on her.  I just
get so nervous knowing the weekend is about here &amp; thus no access to a rabbit
vet.  But, good news is I woke up this morning to a couple of pee marks &amp;
some of the sticky poo on the linoleum floor in the washer/dryer room where
she stays.  I've never been so happy to clean up pee &amp; poop! ;)  But, I
didn't notice her have a little sneeze, or maybe a little cough.  I thought i
might have heard her do that 1 other time last night.  I hope these
antibiotics will help.  Is it normal for a rabbit to leave their sticky poo
on the floor and not eat it?  I did notice that there wasn't any stuck to her
butt.

very small bits for three days. then the antibiotic kicked in and he
made a puddle. you might need some pain control too. ask your vet about
it.. coudl be all owie..
i too freak out over the weekend. but , now my bestfreind is a vet and
she can at least help with meds if it comes up. she and my other great
vets(i have two more) keep me stocked up on emergency things . they have
trained me very well for at home care.  maybe your vet can show you how
to do fluids sometime. it is very helpful in emergency care..

Oh my!  They are some gorgeous bunnies!  What type is Buffy?  She looks like
my cat! ;)  Where do you rescue them from?  Where do you keep the bunnies?
I'm alwasy looking for new ways for her to get exercise but, not having to
clean poo on carpet, etc.
Also, I called the vet again to ask about the latest development of the
sneeze/cough I hear every once in awhile.  She (actually the vet tech b/c the
vet is busy, of course) said that she probably had a depressed immune system
and might have picked up something while at the vet's office.  Figures!  You
know that old saying of if you want to get sick... just go to the hospital.
But, she said my antibiotic should help that also.
Ninny is the name of my rabbit...b/c she is the boss!  She will run my cats
around the house.

A bladderstone is exactly what Marcy had and was awaiting surgery for
when she passed on last Tuesday.  Have your rabbit x-rayed, and if she
has one, it will show up.  If she seems bloated, she needs surgery now.

I am so sorry to hear about Marcy.  I have noticed Ninny peeing a little
puddle now (this morning).  Did Marcy pee much w/the bladderstone?

Sorry I didn't return to this thread until now.  Yes, Marcy was able
to squeeze out a drop here and there, but not as usual.  By now, you
should know what it was; what was it?

Whatever it was...I'm guessing the antibiotic worked b/c I have seen her
pee here &amp; there (no moaning).  In fact, yesterday she got into my office
(she knows she is not allowed on the carpet) &amp; she went &amp; peeed my my cat's
auto litter box...good size there (she loves to be the boss over the cats).
When cleaning her I see that her private area seems to be all cleaned up and
no white-looking stuff.  I continue to keep her off the commercial rabbit
food (since the vet said that is where she is getting too much calcium? since
rabbits do not get rid of excess amounts of calcium...they continue to have
it build up in their body...I also read that on the internet) and just giving
fresh greens, &amp; a yogurt chip as a dessert (she LOVES them)....I also started
dipping her greens in plain yogurt (was meant to help in case that was a
yeast infection she had down there).  But, I still notice her having pee
stain around the area (not as bad....I will continue with the &quot;butt baths&quot;)...
I'm thinking this isn't normal, or is it?  And, another good thing is since
just having on fresh greens diet...no more &quot;mud butt&quot;...which is strange I
thought it would be the opposite...I thought I would see a lot more &quot;mudd
butt&quot; with a diet of all fresh greens &amp; no commercial food.

Hi Beth!  the 1/2 walnut you think will help w/the urine soak around her area?

Thank you, sweetie!

ninny. the walnut has magnesium in it. it helps calcium absorb. i have
been using them for most of this year and all the buns pee has cleared
up!!!  nature at it's best. and there is no harm in giving them. my vets
agree.. :)  angelica had the same problem. it cleared up fast..  i did
cranberry extract for two months too..
