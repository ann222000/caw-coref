Hi Lindsay.

&quot;By the way, why do you want a long touch? &quot;

It would have been very helpful to have Blue stand and touch a wall
target AND stay there while I duct tape a plastic bag over her cast
which I need to do every time she leaves the house. What I am doing now
is putting her in a down to do it. She holds a down with out a stay cue
until released. She doesn't yet have a stand stay and I don't want try
to train it with me monkeying with her cast. Her down stay was very
good before the injury.

And I am thinking it will be very helpful for my greyhound to keep his
nose down on his &quot;spot,&quot; trained using a target at the bottom of
contact obstacle in agility until I catch up and release him. I am fat
and slow. He is thin and fast.

&quot;If Blue doesn't have a *wait* cue and you're interested in ideas on
how to build one, please write back.&quot;

Blue has a wait cue just not in that context. Wait to my dogs means
stop all forward motion until I call you or redirect you. It does not
matter at all if they change positions. So if Blue is standing when I
ask her to wait, she might be sitting when I get back to her. If I am
longer than 30 seconds or so I am sure my greyhound will be laying down
flat on his side when I get back to him.

I'd be interested in hearing what your wait means and how you trained
it.

"/> I'm not completely sure what our &quot;wait&quot; means.

I trained it informally, putting food or toys on Lumi's nose for her
to flip into her mouth. &quot;Wait&quot; meant, Don't try to eat this, I'm
trying to get it on your nose. Of course, it was simple Premack to
train. As long as Lumi holds her nose level, the object keeps coming
closer. If she lifts her head, the object backs away. To be honest,
I wasn't trying to train the cue &quot;wait&quot;, I was interested in the flip.

I later discovered that Lumi had generalized &quot;wait&quot; considerably. I
had been using &quot;leave it&quot; to get her to stay next to me when I was
throwing a toy. But someone pointed out on DogTrek that that's not a
true &quot;leave it&quot;. &quot;Leave it&quot; means turn away or back off. So I
thought I'd switch to &quot;wait&quot;.

We did one rep where I said &quot;leave it&quot; and then &quot;wait&quot; and then I
threw the toy and she waited. The next time, as an experiment, I
just said &quot;wait&quot; and threw the toy. She waited. I don't really
understand how she could have generalized it so well, or learned it
so fast, whichever one she did. Oh, well.

By the way, when we were training duration for eye contact, we didn't
use &quot;wait&quot;. Instead, I counted out loud: 1-2-3-etc. I assume that
Lumi remembered those words from Susan Garrett's 1-2-3 game, but of
course that's a very different context than adding duration to eye
contact. Yet it worked.

So maybe Blue and Red's version of &quot;wait&quot; would work on adding
duration to a nose touch. Of course they might lie down while
they're doing it. :0)

Don't you use a keep on going signal (aka intermediate bridge) as advertised on your email list for duration?

"/>&quot;Advertised&quot;. That's funny. :0)

You know, we do mention that training system on the home page,
because it's something I wouldn't mind exploring.

But it hasn't gotten much traction on our list. I've Googled for
some of the articles, and I've found them a bit hyped while lacking
in much detail. The idea, for example, of training a totally
reliable recall in a matter of minutes is difficult to believe, and I
haven't found enough detail in the articles to attempt to reproduce
the results.

But setting aside that training system, I think that I happened to
use a keep-going signal when I used counting to lengthen Lumi's
attention (eye contact). In fact, maybe you could look at Susan
Garrett's 1-2-3 game as a KGS, too.

So in suggesting that Robin use &quot;wait&quot; to add duration to Blue's nose
touch, yeah, I think that would be a KGS, wouldn't it?

Susan Garrett's 1-2-3 Go! game is NOT a KGS. It simply proofs a &quot;Stay&quot; or
&quot;Wait&quot; for distraction. The game is to include not just the saying of words
(&quot;1&quot;&quot;2&quot;&quot;3&quot;&quot;Carrot&quot;&quot;Bubble&quot;, etc.) but body movements as well. The idea
is that one and only one cue should release the dog from the wait position.

As I understand it, a KGS must be just like any other conditioned marker.
Just like the click or word-click such as &quot;yes&quot;, a KGS must be conditioned
over time to have relevance to the dog. In email on another list, Bob
Bailey suggested that the KGS should only be used for long duration
behaviors (those being measured in minutes, not seconds). Karen Pryor, in
her seminars, cautions attendees not to rely on a KGS for things like &quot;Stay&quot;
or &quot;Weaves&quot; as they can be more of a distraction than a help if not properly
conditioned in a dog. Patricia McConnell's book &quot;The Other End of the
Leash&quot; describes the human tendency to want to help and our seemingly
instinctive need to verbalize as reasons that we often overwhelm our dogs in
training with our verbal &quot;help.&quot;

In my own experience, I have found a KGS to have little or no value as it is
very difficult to condition properly in a dog. So how can the KGS get the
desired response if we can't condition it properly? Well, when we verbalize
to our dogs they have to pause to figure out what that sound means. This
pause can be interpreted, particularly if used in &quot;Stay&quot; or &quot;Wait&quot; as being
an effective KGS. Before using a KGS to any significant degree I would find
a few behaviors to proof the KGS command on - things like &quot;go in that
direction&quot; or &quot;push the ball&quot; - things that can be easily be shown to prove
that your KGS has the desired effect. Additionally, the KGS must be the
SAME CUE EACH TIME. Just like the &quot;Click&quot;, a KGS has to be consistent to
have consistent meaning to the animal.

The approach I use most often to increase the duration of a behavior is good
old fashioned patience and observation. I put the dog in a &quot;wait&quot; and see
how long they will hold it until they break if I do or say nothing. I then
try to time my click to *just before* they move a muscle. I then gradually
try to hold off on that click a little bit longer each time until I build
the desired behavior. Believe me, it doesn't take long for the dog to
figure out that if they move before the click, there is no reinforcer but if
they wait it out and get the click, good things happen.

Sorry but I'm not a big believer in shortcuts. I'm also becoming more and
more convinced that one of the great problems in dog training is the
&quot;superstitious learning&quot; of handlers in believing this technique or that
technique works without taking the proper steps to verify their findings
through experimentation with their dogs. Just because something seems to
work is not a reason to just accept it and move on. Better to understand
why it works and to prove that it does, in fact, mean what you think it
means to your dog. I cannot tell you the number of times I *thought* I
taught my dog something only to find she *learned* something else entirely!

Best of luck.

On my drive home today, I was thinking about how often I'm told that XYZ is
the way to train something (or untrain something since I tend to deal with
problem behaviors). When I ask why sooner or later it gets around to,
&quot;That's how everyone does it&quot; or &quot;Famous Trainer wrote it in a book&quot;.

&quot;That's how everyone does it&quot; doesn't mean anything. Quite often in human
history almost everyone has believed stuff that isn't true. Everyone used
to believe the world was flat. Everyone used to believe the molecule was
the smallest unit of matter. In fact, right now think about the political
party you belong to, then think about that party's major competitor. How
many people are in that other party? A lot, right? What if I were to say
that because a lot of people are in it, the other party's viewpoint is
correct? The number of people practicing some technique or adhering to
some viewpoint has nothing to do with whether the technique or view is
valid.

&quot;Famous Trainer A wrote a book&quot; can mean a lot of things. An engaging
writing style that captured some publisher's attention. A controversial
viewpoint that hasn't been published previously. A vet tech or a
veterinarian. (Think about that. How much do they really know about animal
behavior outside the clinic? Some may know tons. others may know very
little.) Some interesting data from some research (TOO RARELY IF EVER!!!)
Thirty years of experience training dogs.

Which brings up another question. does duration or persistence in the field
equal expertise? What if they only saw one dog a year? What if they worked
extensively with 3 dogs. their own. for 30 years? Or what if they said
they've worked with 1500 dogs in their careers. what did they DO with those
dogs? Clean up their poop? Choke them with a prong collar? And how do we
know they worked with 1500 dogs? We have to take their word for it, right?
Do they understand behavioral principles? Where did they get that
understanding? Did they get it from another trainer with 30 years training
experience? Where did THAT trainer get her expertise?

It's important that as trainers we remember that OUR behavior is under the
same kinds of contingencies in the environment our dogs' behaviors are
under. Reinforcement, punishment, extinction. it all applies to us all the
time, just like it all applies to our dogs all the time. Also, these
procedures are not just things we do to the people and animals we're
teaching. they're natural occurrences in the environment. They are
happening all the time whether we plan for them or not.

On Tuesday I told my undergrad students that they are always reinforcing and
extinguishing their instructors' behavior. it's not just us BA teachers
trying to reinforce their responding. their responses have a lot to do with
how we behave in front of the class. If they are all doodling or sleeping
or whatever, it may be a commentary on my performance as a teacher, but I
told them that if they want me to be a more interesting teacher, pay
attention and respond a lot when I'm saying the kinds of things they want me
to tell them. I will still have certain material I have to teach them to
meet the course requirements but responses like that can tell me HOW to
present the material so it's interesting to them, and we can BOTH win. I
get an attentive class, and they get interesting lectures and class
activities.

An interesting side-point. When people go to communicators or psychics they
report that they considered the person accurate when they only got 6% of
their readings right. In other words, if a psychic told them 100 things and
only 6 of 100 were actually correct, the people considered that &quot;amazing&quot;
and highly accurate. Why? Because of how the info is presented.

If a lecturer stands in front of a group it is not uncommon for the group to
assume that because s/he is up there, s/he knows what s/he is talking about.
Actually all you really know is that s/he is standing in front of a group
saying things. (Soooo cynical, right? Well, seriously. do they know more
than you? Maybe not.)

When I talk to groups about my work or about reinforcement or whatever, I
speak about things for which there is data. When you attend seminars, ask
questions. Do not worship any gurus. Do your own thinking.

Important things first.

My comments regarding the &quot;superstitious learning&quot; on the part of some
handlers was not directed at you or any particular training techniques you
may employ with your dogs. My apologies to any who may have misinterpreted
what I wrote. If I had specifically intended to challenge your training
methods, courtesy would dictate that I address you directly and in detail
regarding where we might differ.

*************

As to your points regarding &quot;counting&quot; and its effect on the dog, I would
challenge you on some of them.

You state that you believe that &quot;counting&quot; acts as a &quot;winding up, a coiling&quot;
of the dog. Can you tell me why saying &quot;one.two.three..&quot; would act more
effectively to &quot;wind up&quot; your dog than saying, for example,
&quot;red.blue.orange&quot;? I assume that in either case, the dog has insufficient
context or training to place any significance on any of the words used.
Surely you can't be suggesting that dogs understand that 2 comes after one
and that 3 comes after 2.

I would instead suggest that the handler's tone of voice and body language
play significant rolesin signaling the dog that the opportunity for
reinforcement is being presented. In response, the dog's focus on the
handler increases sharply as it attempts to discover what it is that will
earn the reinforcer (that is, if the training is being done effectively).

In effect, we are trying to get the dog to focus keenly on us in
anticipation of the CORRECT cue for the desired behavior. We are asking
them to ignore any and all stimulus other than the correct cue before
proceeding. This could include airplanes flying over head, the handler
turning his back or raising an arm, and even the handler making sounds that
are not the proper cue to continue. All of these non-relevant stimuli are
distractions and we are proofing the dog to reward only a response to the
desired (i.e., correct) cue.

I would suggest that it is a combination of the delay in offering the
correct cue and the handler's behavior that results in &quot;winding up&quot; the dog.

I don't believe the dog finds the counting in Susan Garrett's 1-2-3-Go! game
relevant as anything more than a distraction from the cue &quot;Go!&quot; I say this
because I have been working with my dog for well over a year on start-line
waiting for agility. We began using Susan's 1-2-3-Go game. We rapidly
progressed from saying &quot;1..2..3&quot; to saying &quot;Apple..Banana..Pear&quot; to making
quick movements to doing jumping jacks to running a few steps away from the
dog. All of which was proofing a solid &quot;Stay&quot; until the dog heard the cue
&quot;Go!&quot; or, in my case &quot;Ok!&quot; So my belief that the counting is meaningless
except as a distraction and delaying tactic from the dog's point of view
comes from a great deal of experience and experimentation.

Your views on this may differ from mine but I would encourage you to develop
some new training situations and test your theory. I would be interested in
not only your results, but your methods as well.

Hi there.

A kgs/ib CAN be used for short duration behaviours, I'm referring to film work where one needs to use a bandaid to keep behaviour together that one may not necessarily use again. A kgs/ib is a continuous tone, the noise stops when the animal is off track, it starts back up again when the animal is back on track. A KGS and duration on multiple targets has great value in my experience but then it depends on what you are training for. I don't believe they fit into clicker training and shaping.

You will find Lindsay that not many will speak of the kgs/intermediate bridge and clicker training in the same sentence, liken it to splitting vs. lumping as you observed with the recall taught that way. . It is a training technique to help dogs learn duration quickly, maybe only a temporary measure such as putting a dressing on a dogs paw. Hope this explains.

Bravo for testing what your dog really knows! I have been VERY surprised
more than once to find what I was teaching was not what my dog was learning.
It happened with my weave pole training and I had to spend 2 weeks
completely retraining.

As to your belief that &quot;1-2-3&quot; has special significance, well, if you
continue to work to try to find that significance through training
experiments, then I would call that a working theory. If you accepted it as
true without proof and continued to use the technique as though it were
&quot;gospel&quot; (i.e., worked every time for most dogs and handlers), then I might
say this was &quot;superstitious learning&quot; on your part. I think it is important
to experiment with training exercises specifically to get a better
understanding of how our dogs perceive us. Someone once said to me (sorry,
I can't remember the source) that &quot;the dog never lies.&quot; They are doing what
they have learned. It's just that it might not be what you thought you
taught them! Since we can't have a discussion with our dog to see how they
see their world, we have only observation of the dog under various
situations to try to understand their response to the world. I guess we can
only really know our dog by watching and learning from them what they know
and what they don't know.

shortcuts. Some people don't believe in clickers. Have you tried counting to
add duration?

I have to agree with you on this point. Verbalizing while trying to build
duration on &quot;Stay&quot; does, in fact, work in most cases in my experience. I'm
afraid that I don't have any plausible explanation for this except to point
to Patricia McConnell's book The Other End of the Leash. In the book,
McConnell goes into some detail on the effects of certain sounds not only on
dogs but on most species of mammals. Short high pitched sounds tend to
excite while long low pitched sounds tend to calm. Perhaps this is an
instinctive response, I really don't know.

I do know from experiments with my own dog that verbalizing to build
duration works if I use a word like &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;good&quot; spoken in a low volume,
calm voice and drawn out to form a long tone. That said it only works to a
point. Too much and my dog would break the stay, presumably to see what I
was doing over there.

As to your suggestion of counting to add duration, in the context of
Patricia McConnell's findings above, it could work if the tone and pitch of
the counting elicited a calming effect on the animal. But again, it's just
sound at that point since we haven't taught the dog the significance of the
individual words. One potential problem with counting &quot;1-2-3-Go!&quot; is
repeating that phrase and rewarding when the dog breaks on &quot;Go!&quot; The dog
could start to anticipate the &quot;Go!&quot; and you could have a problem keeping
them there if they start to anticipate. Better to start to release after 2
or after 4 sometimes to keep the focus on the Go rather than anticipating
the sequence.

Hope it's a good week for you!

Before replying to your post, I ran a little experiment. I was unable to
elicit any different response to counting than other words that Lumi and I
had never used before in that context, which is consistent with your
comments. I still think that 1-2-3 has special significance, but if it's
true, it was too subtle for me to observe.

Are you saying it acts as a particular kind of discriminitive stimulus?

Someone once said to me (sorry, I can't remember the source) that &quot;the dog
never lies.&quot;

That is based on the behavior analysts' laboratory saying, &quot;The rat is
always right&quot;. The dog is only doing what the environment is set up for him
to do. There is no such thing as disobedience, only conditions that don't
support the behavior the trainer intends for them to support. as you wrote
here:

They are doing what they have learned. It's just that it might not be what
you thought you taught them!

With regards to this.

Since we can't have a discussion with our dog to see how they see their
world, we have only observation of the dog under various situations to try
to understand their response to the world. I guess we can only really know
our dog by watching and learning from them what they know and what they
don't know.

Absolutely! A study was once done that involved putting sensors all over
the bodies of human participants. Reinforcers were provided when a tiny
muscle in the thumb twitched. Sure enough, son the muscle was twitching
like crazy. However, when the participants were debriefed afterwards NONE
of them had a clue as to what was being reinforced. There was clear
reinforcement because the researchers were observing the data from the
sensors, but none of them suspected that a tiny muscle in their hands had
anything to do with it. They developed a variety of superstitious behaviors
like shoulder shrugging and so forth thinking that was what did it.

So, it's not just dogs who can't tell us what is being reinforced!

Observation is the only thing that really can let us know what is being
learned. Human verbal behavior is so complex that even reports from humans
about their own behavior is often demonstrated to be incorrect. (Kind of
scary, huh? Think about the legal system.)

I believe you referred to that as a shortcut, and that you don't believe in
shortcuts. Some people don't believe in clickers. Have you tried counting to
add duration?

Lindsay, how do you go about fading the verbal stimuli?

Here's something to consider. I'm thinking your counting may act as
conditioned reinforcers leading up to the real reinforcer. If you were to
continue to count but not deliver reinforcers at the end of the behavior, my
bet is that the counting would lose its effectiveness unless the primary
reinforcer is social proximity.

My apologies if I can't get back to check responses to this thread. busy

"/> Sorry for the delay in responding.

To answer your question, I think I did some reps with counting and
some without. The ones without gradually got longer and I faded the
ones with. I think it was a little like training leg weaves between
the wall and the sofa. Once Lumi had the idea, I could gradually
push the sofa further and further from the wall, and eventually the
guides were no longer needed at all. Similarly, the counted reps
helped Lumi understand how to maintain eye contact for longer
durations, and once she understood how to do it, the counting wasn't
needed any more.

By the way, in the time since our previous exchange on this thread, I
had occasion to train another duration behavior: bowing. We had a
bow for freestyle, but Lumi's vet decided she wanted Lumi to do long
bows as a stretching exercise. Therefore, in this new version of the
bow, I didn't want Lumi to stand up immediately, nor to lie down.

Not thinking about this thread, and since we usually freeshape, my
first instinct was to train it with simple differential
reinforcement, as Eric had described. But then I remembered that I
had suggested counting and/or &quot;wait&quot; to Robin for the nose touch, so
I tried it. It didn't help in any way I could perceive.

Meanwhile, my biggest problem was waiting a tiny bit too long to
click. On several occasions, my brain sent the message to my hand to
click, but by the time I did, Lumi had started to lie down. It made
me so mad at myself to not be able to stop the click!

For this behavior, the breakthrough in duration came when Lumi
happened to decide to turn the bow position into a nice, long
stretch, which was what the vet wanted in the first place. When Lumi
did that the first time, big party. I've gotten several of those in
the days since. More parties.

One doesn't seem to read much about it when discussing operant
conditioning, but I've found it's easier to train a behavior that the
dog discovers to be self-reinforcing, than one that the dog is only
doing because an arbitrary reinforcer has become associated with it.
In this case, once Lumi realized the bow felt good, it was an easier
response to elicit.

I liked your point about social proximity. The dog's going to find
some things reinforcing regardless of what we intend, and often
regardless of what we understand.

When the counting works -- as I mentioned above, it didn't work for a
bow -- assuming it is a conditioned reinforcer, it's very different
from the way we train with a clicker. Like a lot of clicker trainers
I've read about, for Lumi and me, the click ends the behavior. I
think I've read that some people use a clicker as a KGS even if it's
been trained as an end-of-behavior, for example in going over a
dogwalk. I can see that, especially in the context of discovery
behaviors. If the dog finds it fun to go over the dogwalk anyway,
the clicker may say, &quot;Yes, that's what I want you to do,&quot; and the dog
may feel, &quot;Good, because it's fun to keep going.&quot; In other words,
given that the behavior is self-reinforcing, the clicker's
reinforcement value comes from the fact that it provides information,
and the treats are beside the point. Maybe TAG (with people) works
like that.

Actually, now that I think about it, I clicker trained Lumi to
traverse a dog walk about a month ago. About halfway across the
level part, she lost interest in food and finished the obstacle ahead
of me. When the obstacle came up in the course a few moments later,
she took it on the run. Clearly that kind of enthusiasm didn't come
from a single half traversal conditioned with the clicks and food.
That doesn't say anything about the clicker as a KGS, since the only
click that might have not been reinforced with a treat would have
been the last one, halfway across. But it does show that the dogwalk
may be self-reinforcing for some dogs, making the treats superfluous
if clicks are still be using.

Well, maybe not all conditioned reinforcers are cues. But I think KP
has written several articles based on the notion that all cues for
well-known behaviors with a net reinforcement history (from the
subject's perspective) are therefore conditioned reinforcers.

It can. But also consider that when you continue to count or when others
click without treating you're not really teaching duration. You're teaching
&quot;Keep working as long as that noise keeps happening and then they should pay
up.&quot; But it's tricky. In research that was just finished, clicking without
treating, even if you only skip one treat every other behavior screws up
your behavior. (E.g. if you go, behavior-click, behavior-click-treat
(repeat) instead of behavior-click-treat every time.)

A better way to teach duration is to back chain.

Remember that if you're offering new cues and new reinforcers after every
chunk of behavior you're not teaching duration, you're teaching a bunch of
linked together behaviors. If you can fade out the 1-2-3 or
Click-click-click you'll be okay, but remember that the fading is doing the
teaching in that case.

It's often true that a reinforcer can act as a cue. But when teaching
duration is that what you want? That interim reinforcer cue is also a
crutch.

They're reinforcers if they result in an increase of the behavior they
follow. Think about the Premack Principle. If a preferred behavior can act
as a reinforcer for a less preferred behavior (and of course it can) then
the cue for that preferred behavior will readily take on conditioned
reinforcing effects.

I believe that's what I was trying to say in my original response to

truly believe that the counting she describes in her 1-2-3 Go! game is there
as a distraction. Since there is no reinforcer for behaviour attached to
the counting, it has no relevance to the dog as a cue. That is, as an
*intentional* cue. It is an environmental stimulus and the dog *could* form
associations with that counting. For example, if the trainer was very bad
at timing, maintained a poor success ratio for reinforcement, and used
corrections frequently, it is possible that the &quot;1-2-3&quot; could come to be
associated as a predictor of frustration or punishment.

But, again, I believe that it was designed to be an irrelevant &quot;sound&quot; that
you train the dog to ignore.

I remember a great session at a recent Clicker Expo with Virginia Broitman
and Sherry Lipman where they described the 3 D's of training a behavior -
Duration, Distraction, and Distance. They talked about how one establishes
a behavior and then begins proofing for each of the 3 D's.

When I train, I build duration first in much the way you describe.
Establish the behavior (a &quot;sit&quot; for example) and then back chain a longer
and longer wait until a release. That eventually builds a behavior of a
duration of, say, 15 seconds. Once that is established then we add some
distance by trying to step away while the dog waits. Eventually the
distance builds up to, say, 15 feet. Then we add distractions. This can be
anything from speaking to dropping toys to suggestive body movements to
&quot;taking it on the road&quot; to distracting locations. All of this builds a
durable behavior under as many conditions as I can think of.

I try to train with an eye toward the dog's perspective. How are they
perceiving what is happening? To me, it usually comes down to Jean
Donaldson's wonderful &quot;Good for dogs or Bad for dogs&quot; paradigm where the dog
simply evaluates whether or not the consequence was worth the effort. I
also believe that dogs seek relevance - &quot;What does this have to do with
something that's good for dogs or bad for dogs?&quot; If something happens
enough times that has no relevance, dogs tend to ignore it in favor of
something that seems to have a direct connection to a positive result. This
can result in good training if we manage those connections or superstitious
behavior if we are not careful in observing our dog's response. I could
easily see a dog that is trained repeated in the &quot;1-2-3-Go!&quot; game learning
to anticipate the release after the sound &quot;3&quot; so that the counting sequence,
by it's predictable nature, become relevant as a signal that the opportunity
for reinforcement. But if the &quot;1-2-3&quot; was mixed in with other words and
actions you are building a durable behavior by getting the dog to continue
the behavior in the presence of distractions.

Very interesting topic.

The &quot;counting&quot; in Susan Garrett's 1-2-3 Game or others' version, Ready
Steady, GO, is simply drama. It's all about building the excitement in
anticipation for the release. You want your agility dog to be geared to
blast off but to be sooooo reliable that he always waits for the &quot;real&quot;
cue.

All of the drama in O-N-E T-W-O . . . and so on is about upping the
excitement (proofing in other words) while maintaining the excited stay.
Susan Garrett can get her dogs instantly excited just by the intake of
breath to say O-N-E. That's what you want. A cue to be excited, yet
staying.

SG has switched the order she adds the cues to backchain them. IOW, she
adds &quot;T-H-R-E-E-&quot; to come just before the dog's release cue, then later
adds 2, then later 1.

I don't see any reason to do that. I have always mixed upthe numbers to
keep the dog really &quot;listening&quot;. It's not the next thing that comes after
&quot;three&quot; that releases the dog; it's GO! that is the ONLY thing that
releases the dog.

I may do this &quot;1 ... 1 ... 2 . . . 1 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . . GO! just to
keep my dog honest (so to speak).

There's nothing magical about using 1 2 3. Many people use Ready, Steady,
GO! or other versions. All the same thing, drawn out for drama, up the
excitement, making it really clear that nothing other than the release
word is the cue to blast off.

Hm... it's not really back chaining if the CUE is changed. It's back
chaining if you start training the last part of the behavior first, then add
on the next to the last part of the behavior, continue the through the last
part and reinforce, etc.

This is interesting in terms of a discussion on duration. Is it really
DURATION, or stimulus control? I suggest that if the dog is supposed to
stay put with no cues going on that would be duration, but if the dog is
actively awaiting the correct cue before doing the behavior, that's stimulus
control. Does that sound right?

"/> Kind of...it's really more like duration on steroids. Back to Virginia
Broitman and Sherry Lipman, this is an example of their 3 D's in action. In
my case, I built duration and distance as part of teaching &quot;stay&quot; (in my
case &quot;wait&quot;) in a controlled, calm environment. This taught the dog to
remain in place until the release cue was given (in my case &quot;ok&quot;). Once
those were pretty well established and I had a reliable &quot;wait&quot; under fairly
controlled conditions, we were ready for 1-2-3-Go!

As Helix suggests, the 1-2-3-Go! game adds drama and distraction to the
&quot;wait&quot; cue. This is particularly important with my dog and agility because
she believes it is the most fun thing on the planet. Putting her in a stay
at the start line is like telling a kid to wait at the entrance to
Disneyland! The 1-2-3-Go! game proofs for distractions and helps her to
learn to stay composed and &quot;wait&quot; despite the bustle and distraction of
people, dogs, and all that cool equipment just waiting for her to use.

I go further than that using a technique I learned from a friend in
Edmonton. Since my release from &quot;wait&quot; cue is &quot;Ok!&quot;, I proof by using like
sounding words while she is in a &quot;wait.&quot; For example I might say
&quot;Oklahoma!&quot; or &quot;oh Canada!&quot; or &quot;Oh my goodness!&quot; or &quot;Oh what a beautiful
morning!&quot; That proofs her against anticipating the sound of the letter &quot;o&quot;.

It's all about proofing!
