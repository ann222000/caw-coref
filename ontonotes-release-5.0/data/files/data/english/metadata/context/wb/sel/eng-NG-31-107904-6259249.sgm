Man Sentenced to 10 Years in Drunken Driving Crash

Washington Post - Saturday, October 7, 2006

The mother of 18-year-old Jonathan Tyler Bentley, who was killed last
Thanksgiving when the car he was riding in was hit by a drunk driver's
vehicle, told a Fairfax County judge yesterday that she still goes
into his room every morning, hoping to sense his presence.

"And I can't find it anywhere," Nancy Bentley said, weeping.

Her testimony came as Pablo A. Cruz, 32, was sentenced to 10 years in
prison in the crash on Arlington Boulevard in the Falls Church area,
where Tyler Bentley and two friends were waiting at the Annandale Road
stoplight.

At the hearing in Fairfax Circuit Court, Bentley's father stared at
Cruz, who pleaded guilty in July to aggravated involuntary
manslaughter and drunken driving, and reminded him of the lives he had
ruined.

"What you did by driving drunk," Robert Bentley said to Cruz, "is no
different than if you'd done it with a gun. To me, the penalty you
should pay is the same as if you'd murdered someone."

Prosecutors said Cruz had drunk nine or 10 beers before he drove a
1998 Chevrolet pickup into the back of a 1993 Honda Accord. His blood
alcohol content was 0.16, twice Virginia's definition of intoxication.

---------------------------------

This is why we need to stop the immigration of any more mexicans.  In
their culture DUI is macho and totally accepted even if you kill
someone.

If you shoot someone with a gun and they die you probably will not get
10 years.  His being a Mexican who killed an American is only important
if you are racist.

I biked around White Rock Lake in Dallas, and one day there appeared a large
makeshift memorial, covered with flowers.  The next day, the story was in
the Dallas Morning News.  Meiji Roche, a world-class cyclist, while training
students, was run over and killed by a drunk illegal alien from Mexico, who
was recognized, but managed to drive his pick-up truck back to Mexico.  The
News followed the story and later reported - words to the effect - that the
Mexican government could find him and extradite, but they would not
extradite to Texas, because Texas had the death penalty.
