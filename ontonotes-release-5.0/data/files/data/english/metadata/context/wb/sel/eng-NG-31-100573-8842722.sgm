Get better soon - I have two 'sickies' in my home right now. John's off work
since lunchtime yesterday and he won't be back until next Monday. I was off
for a week (ending 28th) with  this bug.

Take care

Tamara

Well, here I am, back on me feet again, and back at work even though I'm
still weak as a kitten.  Finding some LIGHT work to do, that involves
mostly sitting still, LOL!  Thanks to all who sent good wishes.  One good
thing about being confined to bed for a couple of days is that there's not
much to do all day but READ!  Here's what I've got through since last
Thursday:

Charles Stross: &quot;The Atrocity Archives&quot; - For a techno-geek like me, this
was sheer heaven.  A mix of high-tech, hacking, sci-fi and spy-fi with a
generous dollop of Cthulhu mythos to add flavour to the mixture.  From the
back of the book:

&quot;Bob Howard is a low-level techie working for a super-secret government
agency.  While his colleagues are out saving the world he's under a desk
restoring lost data.  Bob's world is dull but safe, and that's the way it
should have stayed; but then he went and got *noticed*.
Now Bob is up to his neck in spycraft, alternative universes, dimension -
hopping Nazis, Middle Eastern terrorists, Lovecraftian horror and the end
of the world.  One thing is certain - it'll take more than control- alt-
delete to sort this mess out...&quot;

I've read a few other novels by Stross, and I've yet to come across one I
didn't enjoy immensely.  The fact that, like two of my other favourite
authors - Ken Macleod and Iain M Banks, Stross is a fellow-Scot, is just
icing on the cake.  Highly recommended.

Keith Roberts: &quot;Pavane&quot; - Hauntingly beautiful fantasy.  This is one of
those &quot;alternative reality&quot; books.  From the blurb:

&quot;1588:  Queen Elizabeth is felled by an assassin's bullet.  Within the
week, the Spanish Armada has sailed, and its victory changes the course of
history.
1968:  England is still dominated by the Church of Rome.  There are no
telephones, no television, no nuclear power.  As Catholicism and the
Inquisition tighten their grip, rebellion is growing...&quot;

One unusual aspect of the book is that Roberts doesn't divide it up into
chapters, as such - he calls his divisions &quot;measures.&quot; (Followed by a
&quot;coda&quot; - a reference to the medieval dance the book is named after.)  Each
measure is initially a stand-alone short story illustrating aspects of
life for the main characters in the book.  As the story progresses, each
measure links up with others, fore and aft, gradually meshing into a
glorious tale of a nation resisting oppression and rising to freedom.
Stirring stuff, and wonderfully written.

Tami Hoag: &quot;Kill the Messenger&quot; - Well-paced crime-fic page-turner.  From
the back cover:

&quot;At the end of a long, hard day battling the Los Angeles traffic, bike
messenger Jace Damon is called on to make a final pick-up from the office
of sleazy defence attorney Leonard Lowell.  Jace is tired, and needs to
get home to check up on his little brother who he's single-handedly
bringing up.  He makes the collection, but the delivery address turns out
to be a vacant lot.  Then a car tries to run him down, and Jace only just
escapes.  He returns to the attorney's office to find that Lowell has been
murdered - and that Jace is the prime suspect.
Jace is forced to elude both the police and the men who want him dead
whilst he attempts to find evidence to clear his name.  And he must keep
his brother safe from someone who is prepared to kill...&quot;

This is the first Hoag novel I've read, and I was quite impressed.
Someone else in the castle recommended Hoag a while ago, and when I came
across this in a second-hand shop, I thought I'd give it a go.  Glad I did
- I'll be looking out for more of this author's work now!

James Rollins: &quot;The Judas Strain&quot; - Another first for me, Rollins seems to
be an adventure writer mixing the styles of Tom Clancy, Clive Cussler and
Dan Brown.  From the flyleaf:

&quot;Buried deep within a jungle, ancient ruins conceal a deadly secret...
Buried in a tomb in Venice, a great explorer hides a truth that could
shatter history...  Buried in our own genetic code, a mystery like no
other...  But nothing stays buried forever...  and it will be up to Sigma
Force, a covert team of elite scientists, to face what will be
unearthed...&quot;

This is rip-snorting, gung-ho, boys-own adventure writing along the lines
of &quot;Indiana Jones,&quot; etc., and great fun from the get-go.  Only minor
criticism I have is that the reader is supposed to be ALREADY aware of
Sigma Force, and the relationships between the principal characters.  My
fault for reading out of turn, perhaps, but this is NOT a mistake that
Clive Cussler, for instance, has ever made.  Must emphasise, though, that
this is a MINOR nit-pick.  Apart from that, it's a great yarn.

Eric Frank Russell: &quot;With a Strange Device&quot; - Interesting to me (alone,
probably!) from an historical perspective, this is very much a product of
its time.  Written in 1964, it is quite likely that this novel alone
enshrines the &quot;cold-war&quot; paranoia more than any other of its genre.  It
initially concerns the mysterious deaths and disappearances of more than
an average number of scientists working at a secret weapons development
facility.  From the back cover:

&quot;...Russell follows the fortunes of a metallurgist working on defence.
Richard Bransome suddenly learns that a vicious crime he committed twenty
years ago has come to light.  He must get at the truth.  What do the
police know?  Is he a suspect?  Or... could some pervasive, hostile force
gain control of rational minds?...&quot;

Delightful hokum, that actually develops into quite a nice &quot;chase plot,&quot;
once it gets going, but I couldn't help but feel it should have been
rounded off with a statement along the lines of:

&quot;Citizens, beware!!!  Communists are everywhere!!!  This could all to
easily happen to YOU TOO, if you are not vigilant enough!!!&quot;

As I said, a novel very much of its time.

Jeffrey Deaver: &quot;The Stone Monkey&quot; - The fourth in the &quot;Lincoln Rhyme&quot;
series, apparently, but only the second I've ever read.  Nevertheless, all
the old familiar characters are still there, and the plot concerns the
trafficking of Chinese illegal immigrents into America.  No point in
quoting the back-cover blurb, 'cos there's little of it that indicates
what the heck the story's actually ABOUT... But I will say that I enjoyed
this one immensely, as much as the first one I read, and I continue to
delve for more Deavers to add to my collection.

Oh, well, that's enough from me for the time being.  More as and when.

Cheers,
Pete.
