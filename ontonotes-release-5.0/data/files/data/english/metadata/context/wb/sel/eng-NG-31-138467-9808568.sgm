*The God has been good to Me- A Story*

This story, God Has Been Good to Me, is a heart warming story. I guess we
never view life in such a way. We all complain when life seems unfair to us.
We have never taken into account how much we are blessed. Well, God has been
good to me.

For 25 years, I watched him fight cancer of the face. First just a small
speck that begin to grow larger. Year after year I watch him go to hospital
to have a bit cut out each time. As the years went by, more and more of his
face was cut away. When he returned with what is left of his face, he tried
to smile. He never complained or was downhearted.    He was a skilful
mechanic and carpenter. In fact, he was one of the best. Whenever he did a
job, he stand back to see if there is anything left out that could be added
to make it perfect. Then he would see some little place that the average
person would pass up. He would then touch up this or that.

I suspect he said this to himself &quot;My work will be my face and my life&quot; I
doubt if he often look in the mirror at that damaged face where the cancer
eat into everyday. No matter how humble the pace he worked in, how small the
job is or how crude the other workers seem, it never bother him at all. This
was his work and it has to be done right. He never glance at the work of
others; a shoddy work done by others was not his concern. Nevertheless, I
suspect when the job was done, he had a sense of inner pride and joy when he
saw how outstanding it was. But he never boasted about it.

As the years went by, he became weaker and weaker. His hands did not move
with confidence and speed that so characterized him. He was unable to do
many things. However no matter what the work or pay, he always had the
insatiable desire to do a good job.

The help he got was not able to catch his vision. They thought he was
cranky to try so hard to complete each and every detail. So he worked alone.
He did not complain or bitterly rail at the others. He would just appear the
next morning by himself with no explanation of the absence of his helpers.

During the latter day, he had only the shambles of a face. He would wrap it
up in a red bandana handkerchief, leaving only his eyes showing.When you met
him on the streets, he would always give a cheery greeting. As time went on,
it was more and more difficult to say he words. Often he would move his
walking stick. This stick, too, was a thing of beauty, carved out by his
skilful hands.

His life seemed to be filled with contentment and peace. I suspect that he
thanked God for those hands and the fact that it was not marred in any
way.He would often be missed about his usual haunts for weeks or months. He
would make his journey to the hospital for the surgeon to cut away more of
his face. Then you would see him again, a bit more gruesome. There would be
no complain, no telling of his operation and pain. He would just quietly go
to work that was awaiting for him.

In all his time, I never knew him to come back with any complaints about
the pain. You would think there was nothing the matter if you did not see
his face. When the days of his labors seem to becoming to an end, his chief
concern was that his tools might be in good hands. He sent for me one day
and told me he wished someone would appreciate the tools and use them
properly.When I took a young man to see him about the tools, there came a
look of contentment and satisfaction. His work was finished and he was ready
to cash in.

A few days before he died he was walking in the yard. His face was nearly
completely covered with bandages. Only his eyes were uncovered. As he
hobbled about the yard, he said &quot;I am going to keep young just as long as I
can&quot;

The day he died, I went to see him again. The odor was so offensive you
could hardly stay there. What was left of his face was a mass of scars and
there was really nothing to cut away. You could tell he was in great pain
and had many sleepless nights. But still there were no words of complaints.
I shall never forget his last words. Ever afterwards they have made me
ashamed whenever I feel inclined to complain. Still day after day, they are
vivid in my mind.

*The words are &quot;God has been good to me. I had never had any reason to
complain&quot; *

*Rgds*
*Smitha*
