g'day,

somehow it appears that the kill filter is filtering mail from my
friend?

when i get spam type mail i simply use the kill filter selection to
delete those mails that come from spurious addresses.

so as it is likley that the human factor did something wrong how can i
reverse this anomoly?

i've had a look in the kill filter file and ther seems no rhyme nor
reason to what is in there as nothing is dated, and it appears not be
recorded in any alphanumeric order??

in all the time i had 1.9 this never happened.

tia

With peace and brightest of blessings,

len &amp; bev

OK, with you so far.

We'll see.

Yep, mine is just as disorganized, but then,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I'm still using 1.93.

The answer to your implied question is that, if the filter
display organization in 3.3 isn't any better than that in 1.93,
your only option is to examine each of your filters in turn to
try to figure out which one is killing your friend's emails.

Caveat:  In 20 years of PC-ing, I have never found a program that
can, to my expectations, handle both email and news reading.
Including Agent.   I continue to use separate clients for each.

g'day ogden,

i only use the kill file on e/mails.

waht would happen if i deleted all the entries recorded in the kill
file folder, would i then start from scratch. or is ther someway to
start afresh?

it is only in agent that his e/mails are being stopped, as far as i
can ascertain it is not happening at my service provider.

Suggestion: create a high priority filter for your friend's email
address and tell the filter to store the file in whatever folder you
want those messages to go into.  Make sure this filter has a priority
higher than all of your kill filters.  If one of them is the culprit,
this will work around the problem kill filter.  This method will work
for any version of Agent.

Another thought: could one of your watch filters be storing your
friend's email into a folder other than the one you are expecting it
to be in?  That is a common problem when a message could match more
than one filter.

Hope one of these suggestions helps.

Change the operation of the filter to move the mails to a folder called
WTF? instead, and then see what you're getting.  Use the &quot;explain routing&quot;

Add a new &quot;Watch&quot; filter.  Put in a match string that will identify the
emails you're missing.  Set the priority to 999, and select &quot;move to
folder&quot; as the action- create a new folder if need be.

When you create a filter, there's a priority associated with it, which you
can change.  A new filter, IIRC, is added at the end of the priority level
selected.  If you don't ever change the priority, you will find that
they're all pretty much jumbled together.

In the main, I don't have many &quot;kill&quot; filters, as they're so final.
Certainly when creating one, I first set it up as a &quot;watch&quot; filter and have
the mails moved to the trash, until I'm really sure it does what I intend.

anyhow i have change priority, i use killfilter in a basic way that is
any e/mial i deem as spam gets the filter applied to it manually,
though i notice with 3.3 i still get heaps of junk mail in the inbox
unlike with previous versions after an initial period the amount of
junk mail seemd to be getting filtered when i downloaded new e/mials
and not appearing in the inbox's, but now that doesn't seem to work
the same, can the killfilter folder get too large?

Sure.  You want to add a new email watch filter.

For the filter expression, do:
Any-sender: your-friends-email@address
Example: Any-sender: wgar ... @theworld.com

The watch action should be &quot;retrieve message&quot;

The route-to-folder should be whatever folder you want your friend's
email message to go into.

Since you are having problems getting your friend's email, I would
leave the &quot;Do not leave on server&quot; box UNchecked.  Once this filter is
working you can edit it to check this box if you want to (so your
email box on your server does not fill up).

Set the priority of this filter to 700 (that should be higher than all
your other filters if you never changed the priority of any of them,
so if another watch filter is mis-routing the message, it will match
this filter first)

It is up to you if you want to set an expiration time on this filter
(I normally keep these kinds of filters as non-expiring).

That completes the filter.  It should work the next time you go to
retrieve new emails.

If you have further problems, please feel free to ask!!  We are here
to help.

GOD NO!!!  You want kill filters to have a LOWER priority value than
the watch filters.  Filters execute from highest priority to lowest.
That is why the default watch priority level is 600 and the default
kill priority level is 400, so the watch filters will execute before
the kill filters.

The whole point is that the watch filter would have a higher priority.

No, you can have the email go into your Inbox folder if you want.  I
suggested the new folder as a way to make it easier to find those
emails.  You can specify any folder you want for the emails to
automatically go into.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The honest answer is &quot;I don't know&quot;.  If you can figure out which kill
filter was deleting your friend's emails, then you can adjust the
errant filter.  It does not hurt to keep the watch filter for anyone
you want to be sure to receive emails from.
