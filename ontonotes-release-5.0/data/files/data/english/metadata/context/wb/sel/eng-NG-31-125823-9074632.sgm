Its not clear if this will be bi-directional - anyone know?

-----------------------------------------------

A VITAL £7.6m project to provide a direct rail link between Liverpool
docks and the UK’s main rail network is to go-ahead.

The Department for Transport (DfT) yesterday announced a £1.7m grant
to help restore the track at Olive Mount Chord and enhance the gauge
on two key rail routes.

The money plugs the missing link in a complicated funding package also
involving Merseytravel, port owner Peel Holdings, Network Rail and the
regional development agency.  And it means Merseytravel can press
ahead with plans to begin work later this year and complete the scheme
by the end of 2008.  The project is crucial to prevent freight trains
having to reverse across passenger lines at Edge Hill to enter or
leave the docks, a procedure that takes 40 minutes.

Bringing Olive Mount Chord back into use will raise the strict
21-a-day limit on trains in and out of Seaforth, a limit the port is
within about one year of hitting.  At the moment, rail traffic from
the Port of Liverpool heads along the Seaforth dock line to Edge Hill,
where trains have to head back towards Liverpool and into a siding
before reversing back onto the main line.  By restoring the Olive
Mount Chord close to Wavertree Technology Park station, trains will
reach the main line directly.

Cllr Mark Dowd, Merseytravel’s chairman, said:  This is excellent
news, which will enable us to invest in all routes into the docks.
The ports are key economic engines for Merseyside and Olive Mount
Chord will be a vital artery to the ports.  It will allow us to shift
huge amounts of freight from road to rail, while supporting the
continued economic success of the sub-region.”

Last night, the DfT announced that Rosie Winterton, a transport
minister, will see for herself the need for the scheme when she visits
the Port of Liverpool today.

Ms Winterton said: “This funding underlines the Government’s
commitment to improving the rail freight network across the country,
as well as supporting the growth of the Port of Liverpool.

“Importantly, passenger services will also benefit as these
infrastructure improvements are expected to improve reliability.”

Olive Mount Chord, which is just 300 metres long, was closed in the
1970s, when the Port of Liverpool – and rail travel – were both in
sharp decline.

Last year, the Daily Post revealed that Network Rail, Merseytravel and
the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC) were all increasingly
alarmed by delays.

The Port of Liverpool package has been put together by Network Rail
(£3.82m) the regional development agencies (£3.6m), Merseytravel (£2m)
and Peel Holdings (£0.75m)

The DfT’s £1.7m grant is a small slice of £132m for rail improvements
into ports announced by the department yesterday.

The best way would be to electrify it at 25kV.  Install OHLE and earth
it.  Put 25kV through the rails instead.

Result: no more thefts, after one failed attempt.

Formation still there, but numerous trees to shift. However, the most
expensive part is likely to be reinstated pointwork and signalling at each
end, and maybe compensation to Northern for interruptions to passenger
trains when the new points are put in.

Signalling-wise, it's effectively a new build, not a reinstatement.  This
side of the triangle was closed following a fire at Edge Lane Junction box
(which controlled the apex of the triangle), some time in the mid 1980s.
From then, the junction was clipped OOU to lie for Bootle Branch Junction
(within Edge Hill PSB area), requiring a reversal at Edge Hill for eastbound
traffic.

In recent years, Olive Mount Junction box has been abolished, Edge Hill
panel now works TCB to Huyton, with mostly automatic signals between them.

Presumably the two new junctions required by the scheme will added on to
Edge Hill panel, rather than providing a new box.

You do know that in decades to come, echoes of that post will filter in

under-educated scrote will be caught trying to break into relay rooms or
signalling cabinets &quot;because there's gold in there&quot;?  :-)

The chord is bi-directional but has to allow for future doubling, it will be
controlled from the existing Edge Hill PSB.
