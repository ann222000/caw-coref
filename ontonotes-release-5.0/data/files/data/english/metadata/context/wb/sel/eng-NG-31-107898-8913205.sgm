I know you're desperate to make me happy...but that's going a bit too

You need to replace your trigger locks and check yourself into the

This will be news to the Pentagon: retiring is now tantamount to
&quot;abandoning [your] post&quot;. That's a very serious charge, 2pid. Millions
of retired vets from all branches of service will be affected.

BTW, what do you base this incorrect implication on? The fact that in
your 'mind' no soldiers should ever retire, as that means &quot;abandoning
your post&quot;?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

As I said: no morals whatsoever.

And why are you giving rapists and child abusers a pass?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Which of these do you want to give a pass to?
">

So if you do not support capital punishment, you are in favor of
&quot;giving them a pass.&quot; Such as it is when 'discussing' things with
2pid, which is why he's called &quot;2pid&quot;.

Besides, 2pid, you favor it in my case, yet you admit above that
&quot;you'll never know what [I] did...&quot; That's hardly &quot;beyond a reasonable
doubt.&quot; So let's call it what it is: you just support killing people
you disagree with or who you don't like.

So now that you've let your guard down, the 'basis' for your
'intergity' is there for all to see.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You

A serious question, as I'm quite concerned about your mental state. Do
you even recall all of the reasons I chose to retire when I did? I've
explained them to you. You seem to be able to only remember and fixate
on one, which is exactly how propaganda works, 2pid.

I think I now understand why you have so much difficulty discussing
things. You can only remember the post that's up in front of you at
any given moment. Otherwise, &quot;It's all gone, Shhhh!&quot;

Lol!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Where's Jesse?  Where's Al?  Where's Twana?.....ooops

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They've been shot for disagreeing with you, 2pid. You should be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happy.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know you're desperate to make me happy...but that's going a bit
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; far.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't see it, 2pid. You want Sanchez and me shot as 'traitors'.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; That is a lie.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now this could me me and either Sanchez or McCain...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Neither McCain nor Sanchez abandoned their post.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What you did...I'll never know.

&gt;&gt; &gt; This will be news to the Pentagon: retiring is now tantamount to
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;abandoning [your] post&quot;.

&gt;&gt; The desperate spin continues.....oh well.

&gt; Oh, you had another intent? Do tell.

I think you did when you went to protest and
only managed to retire.
