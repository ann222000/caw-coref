I tripped across this load of cabinets in my browsing. http://tinyurl.com/2taewp .
Just a heads up for someone local. I'd go the $5, if they were closer to me, just to
keep them from the trash or bonfire. I've harvested lots of nice veneer from derelict
or damaged cabinets.
Many of then would be good for a "veneer farm" (Mark?) although a couple look worth
hanging on to for a little while. I see a Crosley 02CA or similar, a 41-ish Philco and
a small tombstone. Some even still have ED speakers in them.

Whyizzit, you save chassi in hopes of finding a cabinet, and you save cabinets in
hopes of finding a chassis, but you never seem to find 2 that match?
I've noticed that there are a lot of empty cabinets showing up lately, locally and
on Ebay. I wonder why?

Are folks parting out radios, or junking non-functional old
electronics they don't understand but holding onto wood that most
people can get their mind around?

How sick to throw all that fine wood away!.  They look to be in great
shape.  I've got a chassis that may fit in the center one with the
large round opening; My grandfather gave me an expensive (for th' day)
shortwave chassis with a large round preset-full dial.  A customer at
his radioshop 40 or 50 years ago never came back for it.  Man, Mi is a
long way from Oklahoma . . . .
