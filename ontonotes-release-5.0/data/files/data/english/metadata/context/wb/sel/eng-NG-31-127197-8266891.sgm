With the NFL and NCAA Football starting up and the MLB playoff race
heating up it's easy to see that David Beckham and the MLS will be
struggling to get any sports press coverage in the coming weeks.

They'll give it to him in LA since there's no local NFL team there and
the Dodgers have lost something like 15 of their last 20.

Well there's the Angels, USC Trojan and UCLA Bruin football that will
dominate LA sports headlines. The MLS will job hard to them three. LA
sports writers also write heavily about the NFL, Pac-10 football and
MLB playoffs in total regardless of LA having a team or not.

But do you think Los Angeles really gives a hoot when they don't have
an NFL team? They watch the games, but they don't have a rooting
interest. And do folks who don't attend USC or UCLA really care about
the Trojans or the Bruins?. I lived in Anaheim for awhile. Do you
think I cared less about either the Trojans or the Bruins? Of course
not. The Angels are an Orange County team. Even still, nobody gives a
hoot about Beckham but movie stars because they want to feel like they
are in sync with Europe.

In terms of people giving a shit, outside of immigrant soccer fans

Hey, it's not his fault someone wanted to pay his overrated hasbeen ass
a shitload of money to come over and let the media pretend like
Americans should give a fuck about him and his sport.

Barry Bonds just roided his way to the greatest record in all of
American sports and 1 day after he did it, nobody gave a shit anymore.
And we're supposed to be wowed by Beckham?

It's not our fault the rest of the world isn't bright enough to know
that soccer sucks.  I suspect, if anything, this was more about MLS's
attempt to gain foreign markets than it was ever about trying to get
into more American households.

The funny thing is Beckham isn't even a scorer. He's an assist guy.

Assist Guy = BORING
