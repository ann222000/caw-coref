Holman's been getting his knickers all bunched up because the yids have been
accused of pulling a rather embarrassing (for them) article from the web.

This is not a new phenomenon, as anyone familiar with Youtube, for example,
will be aware.

This activity of the ole yid is used in order they can label as &quot;liars&quot;
anyone making reference to these now &quot;disappeared&quot; articles and clips etc.

Classic example:

I've frequently posted links to a video clip of Viktor Ostrovsky explaining
how, when he was engaged with Mossad, he could get anyone causing the yids
problems to be labelled as being an anti-semite.

This clip has conveniently (for the yids) disappeared from the Youtube
archives.

If I am to post the transcript of his conversation from the video clip now,
the yids will ask for verification he said the words I attribute to him, by
way of posting a link to the clip. Given the clip no longer exists, I will
be branded a liar due to a lack of verification of the statement.

This is a typical ploy of the stinky yids and serves as another classic
example of the levels they will stoop to in order they protect their
precious Holocaust(tm) and defend themselves from criticism.

And they wonder why they are universally loathed.

1. The article has been pulled from a subset of the websites in which it
once appeared. A recent Google search revealed that it is still carried
on 219 websites. Cramer is wrong.

2. The article refers to a seemingly non-existent Associated Press
release about an equally non-existent speech allegedly given by Lord
Shawcross on March 16, 1984. All efforts that I have made thus far to
locate concrete references to the speech and associated press release
have yielded negative results.

3. If my hunch is correct, the speech was never given and the press
release does not exist. Responsibly run websites remove references to
fabricated speeches and press releases.

4. Ben Cramer blames &quot;the yids&quot; for everything he dislikes. He lacks the
cranial capacity to understand that people with a sense of ethics and a
regard for truth who run responsible websites remove material of
questionable or bogus authenticity.

Oh, ferfuckssake. Do you really believe the yids are incapable of any wrong?
Are you incapable of seeing the control they have over America's political
proces, much of the world's press, the Federal Reserve etc.? Â You call that
integrity? Do you accept their pushing America into a war against Iraq being
the actions of a group who hold integrity dear to themselves? Do you accept
that a country full of these arseholes, who have brutalised their neighbours
for nigh on sixty years, with complete disregard for international law or
convention, hold integrity dear to themselves?

For you to think the yids don't use their power to control and sanitise the
media and also to control the political agenda is naive at best. Can you say
CAMERA? Â Can you say Hasbara Project?

You're a blind, pro-yid arsehole, holman, who needs to have his contact with
children put to a stop immediately. That you're permitted to poison the
minds of the young and impressionable with your yid mantra, dogma and
ideology is bordering on criminal.

And the yids have yet to prove he didn't make the speech. They've simply
declared the speech a forgery and &quot;debunked&quot; the entire episode. No proof.
No evidence, just the &quot;it's been debunked&quot; claim, in isolation. Again.

You and the rest of the yid industry, will be running around with your tails
in the air for weeks over this apparent &quot;victory.&quot; A very hollow victory,
laddie, as you have provided ammunition enough to use this particular
episode as a brilliant example of the activities of the yid industry in
protecting their lies and myths.

You have yet to respond to my question as to why so many of the clips,
critical of the yids on Youtube, have disappeared from their archives. Why
have you ignored that little fact of life, yougenie? NONE of the links I
have showing the white supremacists or neo-fascists in action have been
removed. ONLY the links to clips which are critical of the yids or show yid
brutality.

Whilst you're on a roll, why don't you moan and kvetch about the fact the
Finnish Air Force uniform still bears swastikas on them.

There you go. Another cause celebre for you to indulge yourself in.

Net Hate in Neverland

To locals, he's a roadside instutition. But to the Usenet, he's a monster.

By Julia Reischel
Article Published Sep 21, 2006

When Mickey Ben-Tovim drives by Peter Pan Gifts, a small seashell shop in Delray Beach,
he slows his Ferarri and squints through the windows cluttered with conchs and cowries,
searching for a man he wants dead.

&quot;He's truly one of the more vile individuals you'll ever come across,&quot; says Ben-Tovim, an
Israeli-born Sarasota computer programmer. &quot;I have on occasion thought about causing him
bodily harm, but then I thought, you know, I'm not going to risk my freedom for his. But
I was a Marine Corps sniper. If I had the urge to kill him, I would've done it a long
time ago, and no one would ever find out.&quot;

For at least a decade, 74-year-old Alex Seredin, owner and proprietor of Peter Pan Gifts,
has spent his nights posting Internet messages filled with his hatred of Jews. A search
on his e-mail address produces thousands of messages laced with all-caps profanity and
the word kike.

Using a variety of pseudonyms such as &quot;El Conquistador&quot; and &quot;Strider,&quot; all of which trace
back to the same BellSouth account, Seredin is a regular presence on messageboards
dedicated to Jewish culture and Holocaust denial. Under &quot;Serwad,&quot; his oldest nom de
guerre, he writes with unflagging passion about the sins, as he sees them, of Israel and
Jewry.

In a typical message, titled &quot;HOLOCAUST IS THE JEW LIE AND DOWNFALL,&quot; Seredin explains
that anti-Semitism is the fault of Jews themselves: &quot;I am not against the Jewish people,
but I really think they should know that those of us that are not Jewish, do not sit
around all day every day thinking about being Jewish,&quot; he writes. &quot;And that the idea to
introduce oneself as Hello my name is David and I'm a Jew at EVERY encounter is really
what engenders anti-Semitism, let alone that is very tiresome.&quot;

Many of his posts quickly degenerate into short, profane volleys with other newsgroup
regulars, with Seredin demonstrating that he has a short temper and an oddball vocabulary
of racial slurs.

&quot;HOW ZIONAZIS FUCK AMERICANS&quot; reads one post. &quot;WATCH OUT KIKE WE ARE COMING&quot; reads
another. &quot;PALESTINIANS SHOULD EXPEL ALL THE BLOODY KIKES&quot; runs a third. &quot;IF THEY DO NOT
WANT TO LEAVE THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN PICK AND SHOVEL!&quot;

By posting dozens of messages like these every day, Seredin has earned a storied
reputation as one of the most venerable and irrational racists in the newsgroup
community.

&quot;There are 200 million Islamo-fascists who are bent on destroying our way of life, and
Seredin is one of those people who buys into it,&quot; Ben-Tovim says. &quot;It's anger - it's all
anger.&quot;

&quot;His posts all sound alike,&quot; says Susan, a Usenet regular from Maryland who has been
sparring with Seredin for years. &quot;They're all the really frothing at the mouth, English
not quite perfect. And then he starts making sexual slurs. He usually speaks about the
clit. He says clacker, which I think is supposed to mean the same thing. He resorts to
this when he's backed into a corner. He's vociferous and gross about it.&quot;

The war became a dirty one long ago. Ben-Tovim and others tracked down Seredin's home
address and business and published them on the messageboards, along with his private
telephone number and the name of his wife, Mona.

&quot;I'm getting worried about Alex,&quot; one poster wrote in late 2005. &quot;The anger. The upper
case. This is an urgent message to anyone who lives in Delray Beach, Florida. Stop by
Alex's home and shop and see how he is doing! Here are the coordinates.&quot;

Seredin, who refused to be photographed for this article, has fought back with similar
tactics but has never managed to shift attacks away from himself. Ben-Tovim says Seredin
serves a useful purpose in the Usenet ecosystem. &quot;Alex is so outrageous that he's
actually a very good example of how ignorant anti-Semitism is,&quot; he says. &quot;He's a very
good way of making all anti-Semites look bad. He shouldn't be silenced - he should be
exposed.&quot;

The fact that he spends his days selling seashells to aging Floridians out of a store
named for a beloved children's storybook character makes him curiously compelling to
everyone on the messageboards.

&quot;I wonder what the heck he is doing,&quot; Susan says. &quot;Sitting in the back waiting for
customers, typing between sales?&quot;

On a recent lazy summer Monday afternoon, Alex Seredin is behind the counter at the
center of his large, whitewashed roadside shop, attending to a belligerent gray-haired
customer while tinny piped-in country music tinkles above.

&quot;Just let me see it!&quot; his patron barks as Seredin handles one of the many shells she is
buying. Square-faced, with a cap of white hair and a large round belly under his lavender
T-shirt, Seredin responds good-naturedly with a genial &quot;ho, ho, ho&quot; as he hands it back
to her. He looks exactly like a tropical Santa Claus after a good shave.

His jolliness soothes his customer. Pawing over her purchases, she becomes pleased. &quot;This
is really going to look kitsch!&quot; she murmurs, delighted.

&quot;There are some real treasures here. It's a wonderful place for kids,&quot; Seredin calls
after her in his wheezy Eastern European accent. &quot;Have a good day, my dear.&quot;

Though it's officially after business hours, a trickle of customers keeps coming in to
wander through the rows of baby sharks floating in bottles of electric-blue liquid, tubs
of $1 starfish husks, and shells of every variety. Seredin buys the shells in bulk,
shipped over from Indonesia and Malaysia, and resells them to beachcombers looking for
souvenirs. He purchased the store from its original owner in 1996, when Seredin and his
wife followed the snowbirds from Ottawa to Florida and decided to roost.

&gt; Face it Susan, you will always be a Shiksa..

&gt; For the growing minority of non-Jews living in Israel, a sense of belonging
&gt; can
&gt; be impossible to achieve.

&gt; Just recently, former MK Michael Kleiner described non-Jewish immigrants to
&gt; Israel as &quot;dirty water.&quot; He applied the metaphor to Russian immigrants, but
&gt; his
&gt; racist statement was also aimed at me. The only difference is that I'm the
&gt; dirty water that slopped in from England, not Russia. Kleiner's comments are
&gt; not unusual in Israel. For years now I've been listening to politicians,
&gt; public
&gt; officials, even ordinary people spilling out bile toward the non-Jewish
&gt; citizens of the country.

&gt; Living in Israel as a gentile is not an easy experience. There is always
&gt; someone out there to remind you that not only do you not belong, but that in
&gt; some way you are polluting the purity of the country. During my early years
&gt; in
&gt; Israel, the first question people asked me was whether or not I was Jewish.
&gt; It
&gt; was like an obsession. In taxicabs, at bus stops, at interviews, at work,
&gt; even
&gt; in the supermarket, the question followed me everywhere and anywhere. &quot;Are
&gt; you
&gt; Jewish?&quot;

&gt; I lied about it twice. The first time to a taxi driver. He eyed me
&gt; suspiciously
&gt; and then launched into a tirade about his brother who had married a goy and
&gt; gone to live in America. &quot;It's people like him who are destroying the Jewish
&gt; race,&quot; he told me angrily, his eyes locked on mine in the mirror. &quot;I cannot
&gt; forgive him.&quot;

&gt; The second time I was standing in a queue at a public toilet. I was six
&gt; months
&gt; pregnant and the toilet attendant, an elderly man with a stoop, shuffled over
&gt; to me. &quot;Where are you from?&quot; he asked. &quot;England, but I live here now,&quot; I
&gt; replied in Hebrew. &quot;Are you Jewish?&quot; he asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; I said, hoping to put
&gt; the
&gt; whole conversation to rest. Instead the man took my hand, and with tears in
&gt; his
&gt; eyes thanked me for moving to Israel, and for bearing this child here in the
&gt; Jewish homeland. I never lied about it again.

&gt; I met my Israeli husband in India in 1990. We lived in England for a few
&gt; years
&gt; and then decided to move to Israel and get married. Before we left, my
&gt; husband
&gt; asked if I would convert to Judaism. He told me it was important for both him
&gt; and his family. I agreed. I'm not a practicing Christian. I only went to
&gt; church
&gt; on special occasions. My faith went so far as the morning assembly at my
&gt; Church
&gt; of England school and the Lord's Prayer. I was open to Judaism. I thought
&gt; that
&gt; becoming Jewish would be an intellectual and emotional challenge. I thought
&gt; it
&gt; would bring me closer to my husband's family and my new way of life. I
&gt; expected
&gt; it to give me great insight into the Jewish people. In retrospect it did, but
&gt; certainly not in the positive way I was anticipating.

&gt; My first encounter with Orthodox Judaism came in London, where I approached a
&gt; rabbi who worked with university students. He gave me a handwriting test and
&gt; after examining my graphic flourishes, said he would be happy to teach me.
&gt; The
&gt; first week he talked about the laws pertaining to the physical relationship
&gt; between married couples. The following weeks the subject was the same. The
&gt; rabbi complimented me on my eyes, commented on my appearance, and told me his
&gt; wife was eight months pregnant. I grew uncomfortable and soon stopped going.

&gt; `Just a game'

&gt; My husband and I moved to Israel in 1993. We got married in a civil ceremony
&gt; in
&gt; Cyprus, and then a year later married in Britain. We also wanted to have a
&gt; wedding in Israel, but decided to delay it until I became Jewish.

&gt; We applied to the rabbinate in Jerusalem. I sat with my husband in the
&gt; corridor
&gt; waiting to see a rabbi. The mood in the halls was tense.

&gt; &quot;Don't let them see you're nervous,&quot; one young conversion candidate advised
&gt; me.
&gt; &quot;They'll never let you through if they think they've got you scared.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You just have to play a game with them,&quot; another would-be convert agreed.
&gt; &quot;Don't tell them anything other than what you have to. Don't give anything
&gt; away.&quot;

&gt; Half way through our long wait, a girl burst out of a room sobbing furiously.
&gt; &quot;I've been studying a year and a half. I've taken test after test and they
&gt; still tell me that I'm not committed,&quot; she wailed.

&gt; After talking with the rabbi, my husband and I realized that it would be
&gt; impossible to convert this way. We were already married and our lifestyle in
&gt; Tel Aviv was far from that required by the Orthodox. We started looking for
&gt; alternatives, and found a rabbi who would be willing to help me convert for
&gt; NIS
&gt; 600 a week.

&gt; The rabbi lived in an Orthodox suburb in the hills surrounding Jerusalem.
&gt; Twice
&gt; a week we sat in his tiny, dark apartment studying at the dining room table.
&gt; Whenever I asked a question he would snap at me angrily. &quot;Don't ask
&gt; questions.
&gt; It's a matter of faith. You're not supposed to understand. You're just
&gt; supposed
&gt; to believe.&quot; Sometimes he would ask a question and as I made to reply, he
&gt; would
&gt; bark out &quot;wrong!&quot;

&gt; Whenever possible, he criticized the Christian religion. He told me it had
&gt; been
&gt; set up for people who were too lazy to live by Jewish rules, by people
&gt; looking
&gt; for an easy life. On one occasion he told me that Baruch Goldstein should be
&gt; praised for killing 29 Arabs in an attack in Hebron in 1994.

&gt; Throughout those awful weekly meetings I kept quiet. I gritted my teeth,
&gt; studied the books, paid him the money and did not say a word. Inside,
&gt; however,
&gt; I began to seethe. I was sickened by his hypocrisy. He set himself up as a
&gt; man
&gt; of faith, then took our money without a moment's hesitation. The more I
&gt; learned
&gt; about the Jewish religion in Israel, the more I realized how rife it was with
&gt; corruption. The media was full of stories about Orthodox figures taking
&gt; bribes,
&gt; about scams and dodges carried out in the name of religion. And worse than
&gt; that, it was like an open secret. Everyone knew about it, they even laughed
&gt; about it, but no one was prepared to do anything to stop it. Instead they
&gt; insisted that it was vital that I become Jewish.

&gt; After a while I began to question this insistence. No one actually cared
&gt; whether I believed in Judaism or not, not even the rabbi. No one cared
&gt; whether
&gt; I'd continue to celebrate Christmas or any other Christian holidays. When I
&gt; told Israeli friends that I felt this was morally wrong, many sympathized,
&gt; but
&gt; others dismissed my fears. &quot;It's just a game,&quot; they'd say. &quot;Don't even think
&gt; about it.&quot; All anyone seemed to care about was that it would say Jewish on my
&gt; ID card, and that somehow, therefore, I would fit in.

&gt; As time went by, I became increasingly distressed. I was shocked by the
&gt; discrimination I saw around me toward anyone who was not Jewish. In my
&gt; office,
&gt; colleagues called me &quot;shiksa&quot; and &quot;goy&quot; as if it were a joke. They made
&gt; comments about my non-Jewish appearance. Readers wrote letters of complaint
&gt; if
&gt; newspapers dared run adverts for Christmas festivities. The media was
&gt; constantly running stories about how the Jewish race was being destroyed by
&gt; assimilation. A cartoon published in 1996 showed a man sitting at a table.
&gt; &quot;The
&gt; two major threats to Jewish continuity today are - terrorism and
&gt; assimilation!&quot;
&gt; he said. &quot;Or, in other words, the non-Jews who want to kill us - and the
&gt; non-Jews who want to marry us.&quot;

&gt; Facing facts

&gt; I continued visiting the rabbi, but he began to grow uneasy as stories about
&gt; corruption in the conversion process began to leak to the press. Finally he
&gt; told me that he could no longer help. &quot;You're not prepared to suffer enough
&gt; to
&gt; become Jewish,&quot; he said.

&gt; We next tried a rabbinical court lawyer in Jerusalem, a man with good
&gt; connections to Shas. He offered to convert me for a large sum of money. We
&gt; met
&gt; him in a hotel on the outskirts of Jerusalem. He asked me about Jewish
&gt; friends,
&gt; about any connections I had with Judaism as a child. After some coaxing, I
&gt; realized he was not after the truth, just some fabricated story about how,
&gt; even
&gt; as a child, I had always wanted to be a Jew. He told my husband to gather
&gt; certificates and documents showing that I bought my meat only from Kosher
&gt; butchers, that I attended synagogue, and was following the rules of the
&gt; Orthodox way.

&gt; By the time we left the hotel I knew that I did not want to be Jewish. I
&gt; bitterly regretted my decision. I was antagonistic and hostile. I did not
&gt; want
&gt; to lie or cheat anymore. Not long afterward we were given details of a rabbi
&gt; in
&gt; Paris who would convert me for $5,000 in a simple, one-day process. By then,
&gt; however, it was too late. I was so ashamed of the whole process that I could
&gt; not go through with it. I felt that by converting I would actually be
&gt; committing a sin. I decided, however hard it would be, that Israel would have
&gt; to accept me as I was.

&gt; My husband's family took the decision badly. They felt I had cheated and
&gt; manipulated them, and for a long time afterward their frustration spilled
&gt; over
&gt; into our relationship. Very few people here understood
