I love my vision with my RGP contacts, but in low light I'm getting
starbursts around point sources of light.  It has to be quite dark,
like driving on a country road at night - then lights in the distance
turn into annoyingly large asterisks.  An oncoming car or even a nearby
streetlight is enough to bring things back.  I have this problem
despite iterating several times with my optometrist and getting the
biggest possible contacts with a large optical zone.

Should this problem be solvable?  I'm kind of confused because he's
known about this problem from the begnning, but he's only gradually
creeped up on bigger and bigger optical zones.  Why would anyone not
want the maximum possible OZ all the time?  Cost?

I'd really like to know if I should keep trying to fix this or if some
people just have to live with it if they have large enough pupils.  Are
there any other options anyone can suggest?  I've read a little about
macrolens, but the information is limited and I'm not aware of a way to
find a local doctor willing to fit me.

Changing the OZ might not fix starbursts around point sources in your
central vision..

OZ problems usually create rings and peripheral flashes that move when you
blink.

Starbursts sound more like surface effects, protein or crazing.

What happens to starbursts when you blink and move the lenses?

What happens if you clean your lenses right before driving?

The cornea isn't spherical. Changing the OZ changes the fit. Peripheral
curves are there to match the natural shape and to reduce thickness.

Thanks for the reply.  The reason I think OZ is because it is so
obviously related to the size of my pupil.  If I'm looking at a far off
light at night and it's totally dark, it'll have a big starburst.  Put
some car headlights in the mix and it totally sharpens up.  I can watch
the starbursts grow and shrink as the light situtation changes. Would
this be the case if it were something else?  He just recently increased
the OZ size and it's better, though not fixed.  Worse in left eye too.

At night I can see pretty much the whole perimeter of something (OZ or
lens itself) in my peripheral vision.  Like a halo kind of.  That
itself doesn't bother me much.

I'll have to experiment with cleaning the lenses and then going out at
night.  It's true that I've always had many hours of wear before these
night situations arise.

Okay, so a large OZ is good, but the trade-off is that you have a
thicker center potentially, and less lens to work with for comformat
around the edges (if I understand you right).  Makes sense.

So if you were my doctor, what would you try to help fix the problem,
aside from seeing if cleaning them helps?

Sounds like the starbursts get smaller as your pupils get smaller.
Generally, edge effects are discrete or mobile, not gradual like that.

_That's_ the most common complaint when the OZ is too small. You can get
that from the junction between two back curves, or more dramatically from
the outer edge of the lens.

Surely the halo moves when you blink. Do the starbursts move or vary
similarly as the lenses move?

About the starbursts - do they look like rays, fanning outward from a point
source? Is there any pattern or symmetry, like two or four arms? Or is each
&quot;burst&quot; a uniform spot of light? Or a directional smear?

I would be trying to figure out the source of the starbursts from your
description. I confess I'm not there yet.

I admit, if it's something you can only elicit in certain conditions and it
isn't disabling, I might eventually tell you it's something I can't fix.
&quot;Starbursts&quot; are present in every pair of low-power glasses, due to internal
reflection. We don't consider it failure.

I might be increasing the overall diameter as well as the OZ.

Can you  replicate the starbursts at home or in some other controlled
situation?

If you are in total darkness and you look at the moon do you see it
clear?  how about very distant lights?

If you can replicate the effect you can try the effect with your
glasses on.

Otherwise you might want to consider that you are getting a reaction
to the cars coming towards you that is &quot;opening your eyes&quot; wider
because you are not totally relaxed about night driving?

Pupil size varys with anxiety and emotional levels you are
experiencing.

I would have thought you can buy a very large contact lens that will
cover all of your iris.   For sure in the past i have seen those.

If it is your pupil size this must be quite a common problem after all

That's important, the difference between those two.

Since this occurs late in the day you should rule out swelling. Your
starbursts are uniform color, not rainbowed, right? Rainbows indicate
epithelial swelling. When you take off your contacts and put on glasses,
there's no fogging or starbursts, right? Stromal swelling produces an effect
called &quot;spectacle blur&quot; cause it persists a little while after you switch to
glasses.

You said you would try cleaning them late and putting them back in... any
results?

If there is a peripheral curve, it might cause an unfocused image that
remains static while the lens moves. But I would expect a blob-like halo
around points, probably not a burst of individual rays.

Well, it's clearly something near the edge if it varies with your pupil.

I gather you never got a printed rx for your contacts, but you can measure
the OAD (overall diameter) with a mm rule. If they're 9mm or less, chances
are that larger contacts would help, and I might ask for an aspheric back
surface.

Unless cleaning them gets rid of the starbursts. Be sure to check that.

Let me educate you here.

If a contact lens is insufficiently large to cover a large pupil
diameter then the outer area of the contact lens is then exposed to
cause some kind of interference with the normal optics you would
expect.

I assume you are in any case aware of that?

I know from my own experience that *during the day* I was able to see
the spot placed on one of my contact lenses for id purposes.  It makes
sense therefore that at night for a person with large pupils they are
going to get some kind of effect from the edge of the lens.

Or perhaps you can educate me otherwise?

The other factor is that he had very poor night vision with glasses.

Can a human eye actually see well at night for central vision in more
or less total darkness for these kinds of dim pin point light
conditions?

And if he has a highly steeply curved cornea he would never see well
at night for a large pupil.  Could a RGP give an ortho k effect at the
edge?

A prescription might be useful here:-)

Your aberration appears to be pupil dependent.  It's probably
spherical aberration.  Optics should be able to solve this problem.
You need to know the size of your dark-adapted pupil and the size of
the contact lens optical zone.  It appears you don't have this
information.

The crystalline lens is also a potential source of aberrations,
although this seems unlikely in your case.  There are instruments that
can measure these aberrations directly.  They are called
aberrometers.

Thru the ages people have described stars as being star like

Same goes for venus i think?

But if you look at venus with binoculars you just see a perfectly
round light source.

Generally people think of stars as being more like an asterik than a
round point of light?    Even if they might have good acuity, the
optical quality is not perfect?

So is the cornea and lens a pure optical shape for all of its
available ability to allow light to enter the eye or is the central
area the most successful?

just wondering here

And i was forgetting but you mentioned it earlier that as the pupil
opens chromatic aberation becomes an increasingly more important
factor in human vision

Some people might just notice that more than others.

As it happens Charles has a prescription that Roberto Kaplan
identified as being associated with intolerance and inflexibility and
lack of patience.

Perhaps in fact he just sees what most people are seeing?

It just bothers him that much more?

Hence your frustration that you cannot help in this case?     Ie his
vision is in fact just normal?

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the reply.  The reason I think OZ is because it is so
&gt; &gt; obviously related to the size of my pupil.  If I'm looking at a far
&gt; &gt; off light at night and it's totally dark, it'll have a big
&gt; &gt; starburst.  Put some car headlights in the mix and it totally
&gt; &gt; sharpens up.  I can watch the starbursts grow and shrink as the
&gt; &gt; light situtation changes. Would this be the case if it were
&gt; &gt; something else?  He just recently increased the OZ size and it's
&gt; &gt; better, though not fixed.  Worse in left eye too.

&gt; &gt; At night I can see pretty much the whole perimeter of something (OZ
&gt; &gt; or lens itself) in my peripheral vision.  Like a halo kind of.  That
&gt; &gt; itself doesn't bother me much.

&gt; &gt; I'll have to experiment with cleaning the lenses and then going out
&gt; &gt; at night.  It's true that I've always had many hours of wear before
&gt; &gt; these night situations arise.

&gt; &gt; Okay, so a large OZ is good, but the trade-off is that you have a
&gt; &gt; thicker center potentially, and less lens to work with for comformat
&gt; &gt; around the edges (if I understand you right).  Makes sense.

&gt; &gt; So if you were my doctor, what would you try to help fix the
&gt; &gt; problem, aside from seeing if cleaning them helps?- Hide quoted

Thanks for the reply.  I still need to do the experiment with cleaning
my lens in the evening and seeing if it helps.  I tend to doubt it
will, but no harm in trying.

My night vision was generally excellent at night with glasses, to the
extent that my astigmatism was properly corrected.  That's why I'm
noticing this so much.  I assume this rules out my eyes themselves as
the problem, as opposed to their interaction with the contacts?

My optometrist seems to be acting like he's out of ideas, though I'm
only on my third try (first on the right eye).  First out of the chute
were pretty good, but my left eye had some residual astigmatism.  He
went to stiffer material, which pretty much fixed the astigmatism, but
the starbursts were terrible.  This one has a bigger OZ, and the
starbursts are now almost equal on both.  Tolerable, but somewhat
annoying.

Since I can read 20/20 in the exam room, he thinks I'm done, it seems.
Around here, the optometrists make all their money seling product, so

It's also mostly irrelevant when you're wearing rigid contacts.

His &quot;asterisks&quot; must arise from the peripheral curve in the GP, or from the

I didn't respond to the original post, because I have no experience
with RGP lenses.

From what you describe, I'd say you're very likely correct about the
optical zone.

I noticed the same thing when I tried Focus Night &amp; Day lenses.  Star
images were not in focus at all - looked a lot like typical spherical
aberration.  The size of the OZ for those lenses is not published.
However, going to 8.0mm with Acuvue lenses produces good results, as
does the 8.9mm OZ with B&amp;L PureVision lenses (though they are just as
horribly uncomfortable as the Focus lenses).

Since your entire lens is only 9.0mm, it's reasonably safe to assume
that the OZ is much smaller than that of the soft lenses mentioned
above.

I think the only real solution for you is to get your pupil size
measured, and go with a lens size that allows for an appropriate
optical zone.

I deal with this problem on a frequent basis in patients who have had
LASIK.  Some of these people have 9.0 mm pupils, which doesn't work
well with a 6.5 mm optical zone.  The reason it isn't typically an
issue with contact lens patients is because the typical contact lens
optical zone is 7.6 mm or more.  Edge flare from RGP lenses at night
is probably an acceptable side-effect for most people, and it is
seldom a source of complaint.

But, if that is indeed an issue with you, it wouldn't be all that
difficult to design an RGP lens with a 9.0+ mm optical zone.  The lens
would be correspondingly large, too.  I have trial lenses like that.
As well, aberrometry permits me to measure the spherical aberration
and how lens design affects it.  I'm probably one of the few odd-ball
OD's who fits contacts to reduce higher order aberrations in patients
who have major problems with them.  Hopefully, wavefront generated
contact lenses will expand the types of aberrations we can treat, such
as the irregular astigmatism arising from keratoconus.

It is common for people to observe these problems when it is dark,
especially for people treated with LASIK (as was mentioned before) or
for people who have a cornea that has some higher order aberrations.
Contacts and spectacles only correct for low order aberrations, such
as defocus and cylinder. Some people have higher order aberrations
(coma, trefoil,...) that cannot be compensated with conventional
methods. Fortunately during the day these aberrations play no role

Sorry.  Rishi Giovanni Gatti (Zetsu), Lena102938, and Otis Brown are
trolls who haunt s.m.v.

Rishi has published, and is trying to sell worthless books.

Otis is pathologically dishonest and actually hurts people.
Following his advice can induce double vision in those
not working closely with an eye doctor.

Lena102938 uses anti-eye doctor rhetoric as a substitute for ANY
actual information.  It seems she now has to wear glasses and has
developed a pathological (and ILLOGICAL) resentment toward the
industry that &quot;foisted these glasses upon her.&quot;

You'd do well to ignore them and wait for responses from the
caring, compassionate eye doctors who DO also participate in this site.

Hi there

I have large pupils and i have two sets of lenses the initial ones
changed the site as far as it could but i needed bigger ones.
Couldn't just use the bigger ones as it was really targeting the main
pupil area and would need to use lesser strength glasses at night.  So
I have to wear the smaller ones for about 3 days and then the larger
for the out areas of the pupil.    It works better than just the one
set of lenses and I find I don't need my glasses as much at night.  I
hope this helps.

&gt; Hi there

&gt; I have large pupils and i have two sets of lenses the initial ones
&gt; changed the site as far as it could but i needed bigger ones.
&gt; Couldn't just use the bigger ones as it was really targeting the main
&gt; pupil area and would need to use lesser strength glasses at night.  So
&gt; I have to wear the smaller ones for about 3 days and then the larger
&gt; for the out areas of the pupil.    It works better than just the one
&gt; set of lenses and I find I don't need my glasses as much at night.  I
&gt; hope this helps.
