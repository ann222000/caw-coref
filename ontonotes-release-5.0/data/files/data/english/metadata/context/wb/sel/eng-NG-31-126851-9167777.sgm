RuPaul: Starrbooty's revenge

Queen of drag returns to roots and meets Atlanta at the crossroads

BY JAMES KELLY

Published 10.17.07

There must have been some magic or serendipity in the air in Atlanta
during the early 1980s, when some of the most compelling cultural
trends emerged to define the era. Long before gentrification began to
alter the face of the city's urban core, Midtown and the surrounding
areas thrived with countercultural energy. It was a chance situation
that bred significant change in Atlanta's artistic landscape, and
shaped international fame for one person who was right smack-dab in
the middle of it all -- actor/singer/showboat RuPaul.

The queen of drag finally comes full circle – once a hopeful young gay
man looking for acceptance, now a returning heroine – on his trip back
to Atlanta for the Out on Film premiere of his first self-written and
self-produced feature film, Starrbooty.

From his early days as a singer on Atlanta Public Access TV's
&quot;American Music Show&quot; to his transition into the most popular drag
queen in the world, RuPaul Charles has always had his sights set on
superstardom. Originally from San Diego, he relocated to Atlanta in
1976 and entered Northside School for the Performing Arts. It was an
environment that catered to creative misfits and provided both a
meeting place and a training ground for the youthful artist. A chance
discovery of the &quot;American Music Show,&quot; with its campy drag and
irreverent humor, enticed RuPaul to venture into Midtown and explore
the burgeoning art and music scene.

In a recent phone interview, RuPaul recalls his early encounters with
Dick Richards and James Bond, who produced the show. &quot;That's where I
really got my start. [The show was] like my grandpa and grandma's
house, and it always felt safe there. It was college for me.&quot; The
&quot;American Music Show&quot; introduced RuPaul to a fascinating group of
like-minded people, and opened a new world to him.

Befriending members of the local band the Now Explosion, RuPaul and a
couple of his high school friends, Robert Warren and the late Todd
Butler, formed a band called Wee Wee Pole, and began to perform in the
then-vast Atlanta club scene. With so many venues having open booking
policies, such as the 688 Club, the Bistro, Rumors, Margaritaville,
Club Rio and the notorious Celebrity Club, there were plenty of places
for RuPaul, the Now Explosion and other campy but talented bands that
pushed the boundaries of music and theater to perform. It was also an
era of late-night follies. &quot;That was a great time. I loved staying up
all night, roaming around Midtown. Back then I really enjoyed
hallucinogenics. We had the run of the city,&quot; he laughs.

Reflecting on the optimism of those times, RuPaul says, &quot;We all
witnessed the explosion of the B-52's and R.E.M., and we knew it was
possible to make an impact. Midtown was in a position to house kids
without a lot of money, and the South tends to nurture eccentric
behavior. We had a good run in the mid-'80s, before things started
getting torn down.&quot;

But it wasn't just based on opportunity; the music and the
performances had to be good. Wee Wee Pole was a bass-driven, funky
dance band, featuring two plus-sized female backup vocalists called
&quot;the U-Hauls.&quot; The quirky Now Explosion brought musical theatrics to a
higher (or lower) art, and gets a lot of credit from RuPaul for being
innovators among Atlanta's rich scene. &quot;The Now Explosion was a
portal. They taught me not to take life so seriously, to laugh at
myself and everything going around us. They were originators, and when
we would go to New York, they were amazed at the freshness.&quot;

So amazed that a lot of the fresh ideas and performance concepts were
integrated into the growing NYC club-kid scene. And as the Atlanta
scene slowly diminished due to gentrification and other factors,
RuPaul and members of the Now Explosion relocated to the Big Apple.

Working the NYC dance clubs as a solo performer, RuPaul eventually
constructed an image that took the world by storm, and he found the
international fame he had been seeking for most of his life. By
bringing drag into the mainstream, he had hit records, a TV show, a
cosmetics deal and eventually movie roles. It seemed RuPaul had
everything he ever wanted. But something was missing, and it was time
to figure out what it was.

&quot;I wanted to become famous to fill a void, and ultimately I became
famous, but the void was still there,&quot; he says. &quot;I had to fill that
void with my own sense of wholeness. And now I do things that I enjoy
doing.&quot;

After some much-needed time off for soul-searching and rest, RuPaul is
revitalizing his career by doing some things over, albeit a little
differently. A recently remixed CD of his most popular songs is out,
but his biggest project is the independent film Starrbooty, written by
and starring RuPaul and directed by Mike Ruiz. The original Starbooty
was a series of no-budget short films starring RuPaul, which were
produced in Atlanta in 1986 with Jon Witherspoon of the Now Explosion.
&quot;We were taking our cues from John Waters and Russ Meyer,&quot; RuPaul
recalls. &quot;But the new one is the exact same; but it's a better-made
movie and has a more cohesive script.

&quot;This is bad, but it's funny. I wanted to be irreverent, and not
politically correct. This is the RuPaul from the Atlanta years –
pushing boundaries.&quot;
