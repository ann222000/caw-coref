semi-OT: bloodstains in the gi

So...

I received a good object lesson in &quot;keep your hands up and don't charge
your opponent's fist with your face&quot; last night in class. This of course
led to the predicted outcome: the fountain of red stuff pouring downward
onto my gi.

I've tried peroxide to get out the comely new coloration on my uniform,
but to only limited effect: there's quite a bit of it on there. Bleach
pens also seem to not want to do anything.

So: my question for those of you out there who have been around a while
(Chas, Gerald, Herb) and those who wear do-gi regularly (Robert Low?) or
maybe who wore them (Trav? Chokey?), what's the best way to get the
bloodstains out? More peroxide?

I would like to NOT sacrifice this gi top, as it's actually a pretty
good medium-weight gi.

Thanks!

Take OUT the bloodstains?  Sounds like too much to brag about/show
off.  I've heard remarkable things about Tide pens and blood stains.
It sounds however that you've already laundered it, which may have
made the stain set.  I'd still try the Tide pen though.  How much
blood on the top are we talking here?

Well, I've only ever had to remove others' blood from my clothes - never
my own :-)  And the modern advances in forensics have generally induced
me to burn them rather than clean them :-)

First of all, it's best NOT to wash it in hot water.  Cold is best, warm
is OK, but hot is right out.  &quot;Hot&quot; sets the stain.

The sequence typically is, soak with lots of cold water with ordinary
salt and ordinary detergent.  Then maybe peroxide.  Repeat the sequence
at least once if required.  (It may work for some but I'm not a fan of
hypochlorite bleach - Javel.  Ineffective in weak concentrations and
very hard on the material if concentrated - turns it yellow too)

If that won't do it (even after repeated attempts) the heavy artillery
is ammonia, strong acetic acid, or oxalic acid (salts of lemon).   I've
had good results with oxalic acid but YMMV.  The heavy duty ones (except
ammonia!) can be a bit hard on the material (cotton, I presume), so I'd
try ammonia first.  Remember: NO HOT WATER!

And if all else fails, why not dye the gi pink like Judo Gene Lebell?

I had a similar experience but with my partners blood, had that ugly
stain down the front of my dogi. one of the uchideshi who worked in a
restaurant part time showed me this trick

Wet the stained parts of the dogi with cold water then sprinkle on meat
tenderizer(buy it at the grocery store) Let it soak into the stain for
about an hour then just wash it in the machine.

Don't get them out. It gives the uniform and you character. Just tell the
FNG's that it is not your blood.
That is funny. Last night one of my instructors told us how he fell  while
demonstrating a throw causing his nose to smash on his buddy's ( another
instructors) head. Of course, there was copious red stuff. He stuffed his
nostrils with paper. He introduced himself to a prospective student, who
dropped by, as the instructor. Of course, the bloody repairs were still
stuck in his nose. The prospective student left and has not been seen since.

Sounds like a good idea to me.

Soak it in cold salt water.  And wash it cold.  If you wash it hot you set the
stain.

You generally have to buy stain remover specifically designed for blood.

I've had decent luck with a product called &quot;iron out&quot; as well but that
tends to be so harsh that it wears the fabric twice as fast.

As an alternative, just keep the stain.  It's a good story and makes you
look like you've been around the dojo once or twice.  :-)

Oxyclean and any of the Oxygen based cleaners (like bleach) won't work
because the Iron in the blood doesn't bleach.  When it oxidizes it just
turns rust colored (duh).  :-)

Who knew that the denizens of RMA would make such good housewives one
day?

(back when I did TKD, one guy managed to put a big, very visible
scorch of his iron on the back of his gi - so of course we nicknamed
him 'Iron Man'.  Later he washed it with something red, and only the
scorch picked up the dye, leaving it a delicate pink)

I'm surprised Badger didn't suggest tie-dying as the answer.  The blood
stains will hardly be seen through the mix of other colours.

If you get a 'fro and some funky background music you will rule the dojo.

Meh. Somehow, knowing my instructors, I think the elegance of *that*
solution will be underappreciated.

One of my buddies in the dojo already has the Jew-fro thing going on; I
can't compete with that.

Thanks to all for the answers. Right now, H2O2 has been doing a stellar
job of reducing the stains from bright polka-dots all over the top to
something that's visible if you know what to look for...

Sorry, but I've never actually tried to get bloodstains out.  I leave
them in b/c I don't give a shit.  If my belt is dragged on the ground,
I don't care about that either.
