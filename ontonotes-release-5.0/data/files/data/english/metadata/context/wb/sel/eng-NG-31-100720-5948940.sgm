Evolution is Intelligent Design

I'm a simple Joe, neither scientist nor priest, sitting in my garden,
reading the latest communiqués from the battle raging between the
Evolutionists and Creationists. I'm hopelessly confused. Seems to me
both sides are arguing a controversy that doesn't exist. Aren't
evolution and Intelligent Design one and the same?

Creationists argue the theory of evolution must be wrong because of
the marvelous and amazing genius and sheer beauty of the universe. As
proof, they like to cite the astounding contraption known as the human
eye, arguing the theoretical process of evolution could not have
created such a wondrous thing. It must be the result of what they call
Intelligent Design. A catchy phrase. I like it. Sounds lots better
than the "The Theory of Natural Selection" which leaves me worried I
might be left out. But their term describes far more than a process of
design. It's code for the unspoken meaning, "God did it and faithless
science is wrong. Repent before it's too late! We're not making this
up. It says so in the Bible."

The evolutionists leap from their chairs shouting, "You've got no
proof. We do. And a court ruling too. We put an end to your fairy-tale
Creationist ideas at the Scopes trial. You say the earth was created
6,000 years ago? How do you account for the irrefutable geological
science that shows the earth is 4.5 billion years old? We're not
making this up. It says so in the geological record."
What's the fuss? Evolution is intelligent design. The terms are
synonymous. I was taught that what makes natural selection so nifty is
that it kills off unsuccessful designs because they don't succeed and
conversely, allows good designs to survive because they do succeed.
Guided by this process, nature keeps itself thriving and healthy. As
new conditions develop, flora and fauna are adjusted, and visa versa,
in an intricate dance, the result of which is truly marvelous to
behold. Just look at your garden.

Nothing in evolutionary theory says anything about God's hand. It does
refute a few statements made in various versions of the Bible, but
questions about the age of the earth or the process that creates new
species are not essential to the existence of God or faith. I do
understand the Creationists disagree, but they changed their mind
about Galileo, realizing that the relation of Earth and Sun did not
prove or disprove the existence of God. Maybe they'll come to see
their error in this too. And I see that some Evolutionists mistake the
wizardry of science for having something to do with spiritual matters.
Both sides are trying to mix oil and water.
Seems to me the Creationists are missing a great opportunity to
promote their views. Clearly evolution is intelligent and it's been
using that intelligence to do a bang-up job creating the designs of
life. Who could have devised such a wondrously simple and elegant way
of creating the splendors of nature but God? Why don't the
Creationists jump on the genius of evolution as proof of God's
creation of the universe?

On the other side of battlefield, why don't the Evolutionists say,
"You Creationists have finally got something right. We're so glad
you've come to see the truth. Intelligent design is precisely the
fundamental mechanism at work in evolution. If evolution were stupid,
it obviously wouldn't work. Like the marvel of the human eye,
evolution is one more of the countless wonders of nature we now
understand thanks to science."

Whether or not God created the universe, and whether or not he has the
time to worry about helping some tiny arthropod get through the
Cretaceous period, is all together a different subject. Understanding
and delineating the processes of nature does not, as the Creationists
argue, refute the existence of God. And conversely, belief in God does
not require a person to renounce science. At least, it shouldn't.

Seeing a bee hover over a flower in my garden makes me think. I'm
neither scientist nor priest, but from high school, I know something
about the bee and the flower: pistols and stamens, and pollen sacs and
cross-fertilization, their structures, processes, and interdependence.
This knowledge does not diminish my awe or the inspiration I feel. The
mysteries of their lives I know nothing about, their beauty, and my
relation to them, give me a feeling of great joy, stirring spiritual
awareness made richer by my high school science.

Human beings have somehow developed the ability to unravel the
mysteries of the natural world: DNA, the evolution of species, the Big
Bang, quantum physics. Well done and keep going. But these
breakthroughs have never begun to approach the question of the
existence of God, despite the often fervent declarations from both
scientists and priests. So what if all the planets and stars in the
heavens were created by a gigantic explosion? What caused the
explosion? What created whatever it was that exploded? What created
the set of physical rules allowing for and governing the phenomenon of
an explosion? What's the purpose of all this? Fundamental questions
about the reasons for the universe and its characteristics, or the
very purpose of existence, continue to elude us. But each new
scientific breakthrough has brought better understanding of the
universe and our place in it. Each new understanding has replaced
mystery and untruth with the joyous illumination of truth. I don't
know him well, but I think God would be delighted.
