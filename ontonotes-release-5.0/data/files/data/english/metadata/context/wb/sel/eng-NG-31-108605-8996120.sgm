According to a snippet in a UK Sunday Newspaper (Sunday Times);-

A New Zealand MP wrote to a Health Minister on behalf of a constituent
demanding to know what steps the NZ government were taking to reduce the use
of DiHydrogen Monoxide,

There's got to be a SMN relevance there , somewhere.

There was an attempt to start a petition on a UK government web site to ban
the stuff.

Itw as squashed within minutes.

On thing about UK Civil Servants is that some of them have no sense of
humour,  or if they have they do keep it terribly well hidden.

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.
Barbeques on fire by the chalets past the castle headland
I watched the gift shops glitter in the darkness off the Newborough gate
All these moments will be lost in time,  like icecream on the beach

More than once, the issue has come up and been expanded on ad
nauseum.  Nothing new ever comes from the debate, but there are always
a few newbies that decide to jump into the pool with both feet and
float a new conspiracy theory.  The fact is that it kills and has been
responsible for the deaths of more people and animals than any other
chemical in history.  But nothing will change regardless of any new
truth that might be spilled onto the internet.  This has all been put
through the wringer so many times I'd say there is scarcely any new
evidence left to slake the thirst of those wishing to imbibe at the

There was once a cult in the United States that practiced a form of
personal risk by actually immersing themselves in the deadly fluid on
Saturday nights. A rejection of this group occurred in the 1960s and
early 1970s but there are signs that the practice has returned,
slightly modified by a spray of the fluid on the body of the celebrant
and then the removal of it through immediate application of an isogon
of sacred material.

Yes - rum also neutralises the bad effect.  DiHydrogen monoxide can

Here's a contrary view - obviously funded by industry stooges:

http://www.armory.com/~crisper/DHMO/

Hydrogen Hydroxide: Now More Than Ever!
----------------------------------

Perhaps you've heard of it: a colorless, odorless liquid; a powerful
coolant and solvent; an easily- synthesized compound which is used by
industry, the military, commercial operations, and even private
individuals.

Yes, we are talking about hydrogen hydroxide, also known as dihydrogen
monoxide, and we are here to tell you that what you've heard about DHMO
is probably not the whole truth. There are forces out there, such as the
Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide, who would seek to legislate its use
and availability, placing heavy limitations on it-- and eventually,
eradicating it entirely.

In the interest of fairness, we invite you to see their argument, and
then we urge you to return here, to learn the truth. Their subversive
agenda must not be allowed to prevail.
Hydrogen hydroxide is beneficial!

It has been shown that hydrogen hydroxide enhances the functionality,
growth, and health of many forms of life-- including humans!-- and
current research suggests that it has become an integral part of our
planet's ecological balance.

Hydrogen hydroxide is environmentally safe!

Opponents of dihydrogen monoxide would have you believe that it is
some kind of uber-toxin, that it wreaks caustic terror on anything it
touches. This couldn't be farther from the truth; when handled properly,
it enhances nature rather than destroys it, and even a worst-case
scenario DHMO accident would be a trifle for the natural cycles of our
world to handle.

Hydrogen hydroxide is benign!

The Coalition and others have popularized the label &quot;dihydrogen
monoxide&quot; over the more chemically-accurate &quot;hydrogen hydroxide&quot; because
they know how loaded the former name is. &quot;Monoxide&quot; has become synonymous
with pollution, toxic gases, industrial waste-- and while hydrogen
hydroxide is sometimes a factor in these problems facing our world today,
it is rarely the dangerous element.

Hydrogen hydroxide occurs in nature!

To hear its naysayers' descriptions, one would think hydrogen
hydroxide was solely the product of industrial technology; that it came
from years of research in clandestine labs. This is not the case!
Hydrogen hydroxide has been a part of nature longer than we have; what
gives us the right to eliminate it?

We need hydrogen hydroxide!
Don't let an uneducated and terror-stricken mob of fanatics railroad you
into giving up your right to choose!

Support the use and distribution of hydrogen hydroxide in your
neighborhood, city, state, and country!

Brought to you by the Friends of Hydrogen Hydroxide and the Scorched
Earth Party. Those interested in joining our cause, or simply interested
in learning more about hydrogen hydroxide, its uses and benefits, and
those who are trying to ban it, should send mail to
crisper=d ... @armory.com.

I'm not so sure:

http://louisville.edu/admin/dehs/LSM/cryogenic.htm

MATERIALS
Materials for cryogenic service must be carefully selected because of the
drastic changes in the properties of materials when they are exposed to
extremely low temperatures.

Suitable materials are:

* Metals such as:
o stainless steel (330 and other austenitic series),
o copper,
o brass,
o bronze,
o monel, and
o aluminum.

*However*, look at the physical properties of liquid methane:

http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/

Liquid methane has a specific gravity of 0.45 at 111.2 deg K and 1
atm!!  Vessel design would sure have to be different for a ship to float!

Liquid absolute viscosity is 0.12 cP, so kinematic viscosity is
0.27 cSt, compared to 1.0 cSt for water.  Surface tension is 13.5
dyne/cm, compared to 73 dynes/cm for water.  I don't know what that would
do for wave-making.

You're making it too hard.  Sitting still it goes through some 8,000
or so tons of the stuff.  A gallon weighs around 8 pounds.  So sitting
still it goes through around a million gallons of the stuff.  Figure
it's around .1 miles long, so for every .1 miles it moves it goes
through another million gallons.

It goes through billions of gallons of the stuff during a single tripe
from North America to Europe.  Think about the pollution involved in
that much dihydrogen monoxide!

Of course, that depends on *how* low the temperature is.   Wiki

&gt; What about bouyancy? Liquid hydrogen has a density
&gt; of .05 while with liquid oxygen it is .85. CRC didn't have a density
&gt; figure for liquid methane. My guess is that it is somewhat lighter
&gt; than water, but I don't really know. If it is less dense, you may have
&gt; to add lots of freeboard and reserve bouyancy to what would be
&gt; adequate for a waterborn ship.

Liquid methane has a specific gravity of 0.45 at 94 deg K.  Vessel
design would sure have to be different for a ship to float!

Liquid absolute viscosity is 0.2 cP, so kinematic viscosity is
0.44 cSt, compared to 1.0 cSt for water.  You'd have that difference in
the Reynolds number for a given hull at a given speep.

Surface tension is 18.2 dyne/cm, compared to 73 dynes/cm for water.
I don't know what that would do for wave-making.

Other considerations: you'd sure have to have heating for
everyone...  and insulation inside the hull. And if you had a man
overboard, he'd be frozen solid in an instant!

I think Gen Jack Ripper's formula -  grain alcohol and rainwater -
offers palliation during the terminal stages (ie from about 10 years
old onwards) of this debilitating and painful malady.

Why use metal for the hull anyway? at those temperatures ice or better
pikegrete makes a decent construction material which gets stronger as
temperature drops.

What's more using ice means the hull forms an insulator, heat
conductivity is much lower than metals.

Off course if the seas are liquid methane it would be something other
than humans building ships.
