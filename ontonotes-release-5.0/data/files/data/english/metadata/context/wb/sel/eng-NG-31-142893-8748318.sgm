It's not surprising that Christians run across cultists, heretics and
nonChristians who deny the Biblical doctrine of the Trinity. Michael Ediger
addresses the topic from his experience with a denier known as &quot;Apollos.&quot;

Biblical Basis for the Doctrine of the Trinity
by Michael J. Ediger

Introduction

Near the end of my ministry in Kentucky, just prior to moving to Denver, I
wrote a series of three articles on the Holy Spirit for the church
newsletter. The first of these articles dealt with the personhood of the
Spirit and His place in the Trinity. This subject struck a nerve with one
gentleman who received the newsletter, who was not a member of our
congregation. He took it upon himself to &quot;set me straight&quot; on the subject
and sent a copy of a paper he had written on the Holy Spirit. Over the next
twelve months we corresponded, primarily debating the doctrine of the
Trinity. He denied it; I affirmed it.

It is not my intention to do an in-depth study of the doctrine of the
Trinity. To attempt such would be beyond the limits of this paper as well as
futile, for finite man is incapable of fully understanding the triune nature
of the infinite God (Isa 55:8-9; Job 11:7). My purpose is to present the
Biblical evidence that supports the Trinity, thereby answering the question,
&quot;Does the Bible teach that there is one God who exists eternally in three
Persons?&quot; To accomplish this, I will deal primarily with the following
hypotheses:

1) What does the Bible mean when it asserts that God is &quot;one&quot;?
2) Is the Father God?
3) Is Jesus (the Son) God?
4) Is the Holy Spirit a Person? Is He also God?

Several observations will of necessity be included under each of the above
hypotheses in order to be as clear as possible in the space allowed for this
study. Other issues, such as the relationship of the three members of the
Godhead to one another and the eternal progression of the Holy Spirit, must
be omitted for the purposes of this paper.

At the end of this study, I will relate the results and my conclusions
specifically to the beliefs of the gentleman from Kentucky. His position
will be proven false, and the Trinity proven Biblical.

1. What does the Bible mean when it asserts that God is &quot;one&quot;?

&quot;Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!&quot;1 These words formed
part of the Shema-the prayer each Jew recited twice daily. That Jehovah is
the one true God is affirmed throughout the Bible. The Chronicler (2Chron
15:3), the Prophets (Isa 37:28; 43:18; Jer 18:16), the Evangelists (Mk
12:29-32; John 17:3) and Paul (1Cor 8:4-6; 1Tim 2:5) are among those who
record this fact.

Jehovah Himself claimed to be the only God in Exodus 26:2-6. He would not
tolerate the worship of any man-made objects (verses 4-5) because He alone
is God, and therefore exclusively worthy of worship.

Yet, as will be shown, the Bible presents two others as God-the man Jesus
and the Holy Spirit. How do we harmonize this with the Shema, that &quot;God is
one?&quot; The key is in understanding what is meant by the word &quot;one.&quot;

Genesis 2:24 uses the same word. &quot;For this cause a man shall leave his
father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become
one flesh.&quot; Clearly, there are two people in this relationship. Yet
Scripture says they &quot;become one.&quot; One what? The obvious answer is, one unit
(family). As such, they are one or single in purpose; but they remain two
persons. It is the relationship between man and woman that provides us with
the image for the one-ness of God.2

&quot;Obviously, there is some sense in which two can be one, since man and woman
are one flesh. Because God is one, it does not necessarily demand that He
cannot also be two or three in another sense or respect.&quot;3 The relationship
between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is similar to that of the man and woman
in Genesis 2. All three are one or single-minded in purpose (e.g., John
chapters 14 -16). They are three distinct Persons (as we shall see later),
yet one is essence (e.g., John 10:30; 17:21ff).

Many illustrations of this tri-unity have been offered; but all fall short
of perfectly picturing God's triune nature. For example, the family unit is
one but made up of distinct persons-father, mother, and child. Another
oft-used example is the one of water-ice-vapor, the three states of
moisture. These help despite being inadequate.

All such man-made attempts to explain God's nature fail because the unity of
the Father, Son and Holy Spirit:

... is beyond the concepts we use to characterize the unity of people and
things.... Some conception of the divine nature is available to us from
divine operations, and God's works are believed to be faithful to God's
essence. But our conceptions do not exhaust God's being nor enable us fully
to comprehend it.4

Because of our finiteness, we do not claim to fully understand the Trinity;
neither do we consider ourselves able to fully explain it. &quot;Since the
Trinity is without qualification the mystery of the faith, faith alone must
provide the approach to the doctrine of the Trinity.&quot;5

By looking at the evidence from Scripture we can, by faith, accept it as
God's truth. It is to that evidence we now turn.

II. Is the Father God?

Paul says in 1Cor 8:6, &quot;there is but one God, the Father.&quot; This is the One
to whom Jesus prayed in Gethsemane (John 17) and to whom He ascended (John
20:17).

That the Father is God is seen in Isaiah 63:16 and 64:8 in the Old Testament
and in the following passages from the New Testament: 2Cor 1:3, Gal 1:1,
Phil 2:11, Col 1:3, and 1Pet 1:2. Other passages such as Matt 6:8ff; 7:21,
and 1Cor 11:3 also allude to this fact.

God the Father is shown as a distinct Person from the Son and the Holy
Spirit at Jesus' baptism in Matt 3:16-17. &quot;And after being baptized, Jesus
went up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and
He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon Him, and
behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, 'This is My beloved Son, in whom
I am well-pleased.&quot;

Similarly, the Father is distinct from the others in the baptismal formula
of Matt 28:19, the Apostolic Benediction of 2Cor 13:14, and elsewhere (John
14:16,26; 15:26; Acts 2:32-33; 1Cor 12:4-7; and others).

The Bible clearly teaches the Father is God. This point is not usually
debated. The problem some have with the Trinity begins with the Person of
Jesus Christ.

III. Is Jesus (the Son) God?

That Jesus of Nazareth was an actual historical figure has been
well-established by Josh McDowell in his book, Evidence That Demands a
Verdict (volume 1).6 The information McDowell presents is quite sufficient
to satisfy even the most skeptical person.

The question under consideration here has to do with Jesus' deity. If it can
be established from the Bible that Jesus has the same divine nature as God
the Father, then we must believe He also is God-God the Son.

Gary Zeolla lists ten different ways in which the deity of Jesus Christ can
be established.7 For our purposes, we will consider only a few of these.

Jesus is called God in several passages in the Bible. These include John
1:1; 20:28; Hebrews 1:8; Titus 2:13; 2 Peter 1:1; and 1John 5:26. Other
passages, such as Romans 9:5; Philippians 2:6f; and Colossians 2:9, ascribe
deity to Jesus, thereby showing Him to be God.

One of the verses most often used to prove Jesus is God is John 1:1.
Jehovah's Witnesses claim this verse has been mistranslated and in their New
World Translation of the Holy Scriptures have rendered the debated phrase,
&quot;and the Word was a god&quot; instead of the more accepted, &quot;and the Word was
God.&quot; The construction of the phrase in Greek is theos en ho logos.

Robert Bowman writes in regards to this construction:

elsewhere in the New Testament, whenever the word theos is used in the same
construction, it always clearly refers to the true God (Mark 12:27; Luke
20:38; John 8:54; Phil 2:13; Heb 1:16). Thus, the fact that the Word is
called theos in John 1:1 in this construction does not make him any less God
than the Father.8
Another oft-used text is John 20:28, Thomas's declaration, &quot;My Lord and my
God!&quot; Some (like the JWs) try to explain this away by claiming Thomas was
using the expression, &quot;My God!&quot; in the same way it is carelessly used today,
as an exclamation of astonishment. But this is hardly the case. As Bowman
points out, such use was &quot;virtually unknown in Thomas's culture.
First-century Judaism regarded any [such] careless or thoughtless use of the
words Lord and God as bordering on blasphemy.&quot;9

Also, the text Specifically says, &quot;Thomas answered and said to Him&quot; (i.e.
Jesus). So Thomas was speaking to Jesus, not making an exclamation.

Although He did not come right out and say, &quot;I am God,&quot; Jesus did claim to
be God. The prime example is found in John 8:58, where Jesus said to the
Jews, &quot;Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.&quot; Here,
Jesus echoes the very words of God to Moses (Exod 3:14; see also Deut 32:39;
Isa 43:10). The following verse (v. 59) tells us that the Jews &quot;picked up
stones to throw at him.&quot; Why? Because they understood Jesus' words as a
&quot;claim to the divine name, and hence to the divine nature and eternity..&quot;10

Further, that Jesus is God is shown by the attributes and acts ascribed to
both Jehovah and Jesus. Both are eternal (John 1:1; 17:5; Mic 5:2; Heb
1:11), omnipresent (Ps 139:7-16; Jer 23:23-24; Matt 28:2o; Eph 1:23),
omniscient (John 1:48; 2:25; 6:64; Col 2:3), and omnipotent (Matt 28:18; Heb
1:3).
Both are confessed as Lord (Isa 45:23; Phil 2:11) and worshipped by angels
(Ps 148:2; Heb 1:6) as well as by people (the Psalms; John 4:21-24; Matt
28:17). Both are called Savior (Isa 43:11; 45:22; John 4:42), Judge (Joel
3:12; John 5:27), and Redeemer (Hos 13:14; Rev 5:9;

Carl,

Not worth reading.  The first article you posted by this guy was full
of lies; this one will be too.

If you would spend more time worrying about your own cultist behavior
and less time about others; you might become profitable to God.  Why
waste your life as an anti Christ, anti God, anti Saint when you could
be something more like Christ?  Surely, you are not proud of being a
hatemonger.

There is no &quot;Biblical doctrine of the trinity.&quot;

In fact, even _honest_ trinitarians admit that it was unknown to First
Century Christians.

History of The Trinity

The growth of the doctrine of a triune God, is briefly but plainly, set
forth in the following facts:

A.D. 29 Jesus said, &quot;The Lord our God is one Lord&quot; (Mark 12:29).

A.D. 57 Paul said, &quot;To us there is but one God&quot; (1 Cor. 8:6).

A.D. 96 Clement said, &quot;Christ was sent by God&quot;.

A.D. 120 &quot;Apostles' Creed&quot;: &quot;I believe in God the Father&quot;.

A.D. 150 Justin Martyr, introduces Greek Philosophy.

A.D. 170 The word &quot;Trias&quot;, appears first in Christian literature.

A.D. 200. &quot;Trinitas&quot; is first introduced by Tertullian.

A.D. 280 Origen, opposes prayers to Christ.

A.D. 260 Sabellius: &quot;Father, Son and Holy Ghost are three names for the
same God&quot;.

A.D. 300 Trinitarian prayers unknown in the Church.

A.D. 325 &quot;Nicene Creed&quot; affirms Christ to be &quot;Very God of Very God&quot;.

A.D. 370 Doxology composed.

A.D. 381. Council of Constantinople invents &quot;Three persons in One God&quot;.

A.D. 388 Emperor Theodosius threatens punishment to all who won't
worship the Trinity.

The false doctrine of the &quot;trinity&quot; was &quot;formulated&quot; and or &quot;developed&quot;
during the three or four hundred years after the passing of the Apostles
-- after the Bible was complete.

The false doctrine of the triune god was institutionalized by the pagan
man/god Constantine in AD 325. The &quot;trinity&quot; is a Greek Metaphysical
explanation of pagan triune gods 'painted over' (added into) scripture.
The idea that God is a &quot;triune god&quot; is not found in the Word of God.

Athanasius has also admitted that the triune gods was added to the
church after the Bible was completed -- and that those who believe what
IS in the Bible will be judged for what they find IN God's Word:
Quote:
I certainly agree that for those who are truly seperated from the
historical Christian Church and her teachings and who have possession
of the Holy Bible and have faith in God will not be judged according
to what I or any within the historical Church have been exposed to,
but will stand before God on the Last day and shall be accountable to
Him for what they -did- know and how they loved and responded to
others with the little truth they had.

Athanasius statement is certainly convoluted, but it is a confession
that &quot;trinity doctrine&quot; was unknown to First Century Christians, and
that it is unnecessary for salvation.

A Christian may, indeed should, believe every Word God gave to describe
and reveal Him Self, His Son and His Holy Spirit to His People -- and
reject the false doctrine of the triune gods.

The bible describes a family from cover to cover, and every family
consists of three. Adam was the first child created in the image of
God then God separated His image into male and female, neither of them
equals and neither more important than the other.  So from the very
beginning God created His image as a family - a child and two
parents.  When a man and woman come together physically and
spiritually as one in God life is carried forward whether or not they
have physical children.  That's an image of God.
Each of us who are God's spiritual children share this relationship
with our Heavenly Father and His Spirit.  The relationship of three
exists.
Scripture doesn't have to say 'trinity' because it describes it.

&gt;I have several times pointed out the Trinity in the narrative

&gt;  The Holy Spirit appeared in the burning bush.

&gt;  Isaiah pointed out that the Messiah would be BOTH Father AND Son.

John,

You are not a serious Bible student.  You tell some good stories and
may be a good story teller but you are not a serious student of the
Bible.  If you were serious you would righly divide the word of truth
by expounding the Scriptures line by line and word by word rather than
offering &quot;the Bible says this because I say so.&quot;  What credability you
had went down the tubes when you began agreeing with Carl who knows
less Bible than you.

While I always recognized that you were not one to know the word
verbatim; you did have a lot of it in your heart.  But lately, you
have been showing you understand less of it than I thought you did.

Hebrew bible students know better, even the Greek tradition does not
sponsor a Trinity concept.  Invariably, it must be misconstrued taking text
out of context, interpolating it to mean what you want to hear.  Of course,
you have established beyond doubt that a biblical scholar you are not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The Trinity does not exist in Genesis and to claim so means that you are
taking text out of context as well as interpolating it to mean whatever it
is you want.  Here is the last chapter of Genesis.

50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed
him.
50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father.
And the physicians embalmed Israel.
50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days
of embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him threescore and ten days.
50:4 And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke unto the
house of Pharaoh, saying: 'If now I have found favour in your eyes, speak,
I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying:
50:5 My father made me swear, saying: Lo, I die; in my grave which I have
digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now
therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come
back.'
50:6 And Pharaoh said: 'Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made
thee swear.'
50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the
servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the
land of Egypt,
50:8 and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house;
only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the
land of Goshen.
50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and it was a
very great company.
50:10 And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the
Jordan, and there they wailed with a very great and sore wailing; and he
made a mourning for his father seven days.
50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
mourning in the floor of Atad, they said: 'This is a grievous mourning to
the Egyptians.' Wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is
beyond the Jordan.
50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them.
50:13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in
the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field,
for a possession of a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, in front of
Mamre.
50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that
went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
50:15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said:
'It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil
which we did unto him.'
50:16 And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying: 'Thy father did command
before he died, saying:
50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph: Forgive, I pray thee now, the
transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee
evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of
the God of thy father.' And Joseph wept when they spoke unto him.
50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they
said: 'Behold, we are thy bondmen.'
50:19 And Joseph said unto them: 'Fear not; for am I in the place of God?
50:20 And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good,
to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
50:21 Now therefore fear ye not; I will sustain you, and your little
ones.' And he comforted them, and spoke kindly unto them.
50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house; and Joseph
lived a hundred and ten years.
50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation; the
children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees.
50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren: 'I die; but God will surely
remember you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which He
swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.'
50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying: 'God will
surely remember you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.'
50:26 So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old. And they embalmed
him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

&gt;50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed
&gt;him.
&gt;50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father.
&gt;And the physicians embalmed Israel.
&gt;50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days
&gt;of embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him threescore and ten days.
&gt;50:4 And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke unto the
&gt;house of Pharaoh, saying: 'If now I have found favour in your eyes, speak,
&gt;I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying:
&gt;50:5 My father made me swear, saying: Lo, I die; in my grave which I have
&gt;digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now
&gt;therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come
&gt;back.'
&gt;50:6 And Pharaoh said: 'Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made
&gt;thee swear.'
&gt;50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the
&gt;servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the
&gt;land of Egypt,
&gt;50:8 and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house;
&gt;only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the
&gt;land of Goshen.
&gt;50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and it was a
&gt;very great company.
&gt;50:10 And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the
&gt;Jordan, and there they wailed with a very great and sore wailing; and he
&gt;made a mourning for his father seven days.
&gt;50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
&gt;mourning in the floor of Atad, they said: 'This is a grievous mourning to
&gt;the Egyptians.' Wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is
&gt;beyond the Jordan.
&gt;50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them.
&gt;50:13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in
&gt;the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field,
&gt;for a possession of a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, in front of
&gt;Mamre.
&gt;50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that

Scripture describes the trinity.

I'll repeat what I wrote Aug 30, 6:31 pm and carry the understanding
directly after.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The bible describes a family from cover to cover, and every family consists of three. Adam was the first child created in the image of God then God separated His image into male and female, neither of them equals and neither more important than the other.  So from the very beginning God created His image as a family - a child and two parents.  When a man and woman come together physically and spiritually as one in God life is carried forward whether or not they have physical children.  That's an image of God.
&gt; Each of us who are God's spiritual children share this relationship with our Heavenly Father and His Spirit.  The relationship of three exists.
&gt; Scripture doesn't have to say 'trinity' because it describes it.
">

There is more in scripture than we can understand, but relationships
of threes exist from cover to cover and we (spiritual children of God
i.e.: saved through belief in Christ and learning from the Spirit) are
able to understand those.

Scripture is filled with relationships of threes and they are all
important.  I have learned that of these relationships are built upon
the foundation of one:  Water.

In Jeremiah 2:13 God said &quot;They have forsaken me, the spring of living
water.&quot;  Zechariah 4:18 prophesies the Christ and God's spiritual
children of the New Testament: &quot;On that day living water will flow out
from Jerusalem, half to the eastern sea and half to the western sea,
in summer and in winter.&quot;  The apostle John described living water in
chapter 4 and also in Revelation 7 and 22.  Revelation 22 describes
&quot;the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the
throne of God and of the Lamb&quot; which ties it back to Jeremiah 2:13 (a
'spring' is a source, and 'water' is life.)

Recognizing and understanding the role of physical and spiritual water
in scripture is important as the physical descriptions and our
physical understanding helps us understand the spiritual relationships
that exist there.  It's like Michael Ediger observed in the first post
of this thread:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
He wrote:&gt; &quot;Many illustrations of this tri-unity have been offered;
">

but all fall short of perfectly picturing God's triune nature. For
example, the family unit is one but made up of distinct persons-
father, mother, and child. Another oft-used example is the one of
water-ice-vapor, the three states of moisture. These help despite
being inadequate.&quot;

Michael was right on target when he wrote what he did.  Michael
recognized the relationship existing with water but could not explain
it.  The explanation exists and it could only come from a spiritual
child of God outside of his field of study.

The spiritual bond of a loving family unit (of three) is like the
nuclear bond of the water molecule.  The two hydrogen atoms are
physically associated with power and heat, and the oxygen atom is
physically associated with life and the promise of life.  Our lives
cannot exist without water, nor can we physically exist without the
energy of the hydrogen atoms or the life provided through the oxygen
atom.  Just as we need physical water and it's components to live, we
also need the family structure described in scripture to live.

Understanding the physical structures and phases of water in scripture
help us recognize and understand the spiritual relationships that are
described there.  Only the spiritual children of God from our physical
generation are capable of understanding the relationships written into
scripture concerning water.  Paul expressed in 1 Corinthians 2 that
the Spirit of God knows the thoughts of God. Paul also said (v14)
&quot;14The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come
from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot
understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.&quot;

I know what I'm sharing probably isn't clear but I may be able to
provide enough insight on this subject where it would make more sense
after a period of evaluation.  This doesn't change the salvation gift
in any way - it helps us understand it.  I don't know it all but I
understand this.  What I cannot do well is effectively communicate.

You know, these threads are both blessings and frustrations.  There's
a lot of good stuff that disappears into the archives.

&gt; &gt; In fact, even _honest_ trinitarians admit that it was unknown to First
&gt; &gt; Century Christians.

&gt; &gt; History of The Trinity

&gt; &gt; The growth of the doctrine of a triune God, is briefly but plainly, set
&gt; &gt; forth in the following facts:

&gt; &gt; A.D. 29 Jesus said, &quot;The Lord our God is one Lord&quot; (Mark 12:29).

&gt; &gt; A.D. 57 Paul said, &quot;To us there is but one God&quot; (1 Cor. 8:6).

&gt; &gt; A.D. 96 Clement said, &quot;Christ was sent by God&quot;.

&gt; &gt; A.D. 120 &quot;Apostles' Creed&quot;: &quot;I believe in God the Father&quot;.

&gt; &gt; A.D. 150 Justin Martyr, introduces Greek Philosophy.

&gt; &gt; A.D. 170 The word &quot;Trias&quot;, appears first in Christian literature.

&gt; &gt; A.D. 200. &quot;Trinitas&quot; is first introduced by Tertullian.

&gt; &gt; A.D. 280 Origen, opposes prayers to Christ.

&gt; &gt; A.D. 260 Sabellius: &quot;Father, Son and Holy Ghost are three names for the
&gt; &gt; same God&quot;.

&gt; &gt; A.D. 300 Trinitarian prayers unknown in the Church.

&gt; &gt; A.D. 325 &quot;Nicene Creed&quot; affirms Christ to be &quot;Very God of Very God&quot;.

&gt; &gt; A.D. 370 Doxology composed.

&gt; &gt; A.D. 381. Council of Constantinople invents &quot;Three persons in One God&quot;.

&gt; &gt; A.D. 388 Emperor Theodosius threatens punishment to all who won't
&gt; &gt; worship the Trinity.

&gt; &gt; The false doctrine of the &quot;trinity&quot; was &quot;formulated&quot; and or &quot;developed&quot;
&gt; &gt; during the three or four hundred years after the passing of the Apostles
&gt; &gt; -- after the Bible was complete.

&gt; &gt; The false doctrine of the triune god was institutionalized by the pagan
&gt; &gt; man/god Constantine in AD 325. The &quot;trinity&quot; is a Greek Metaphysical
&gt; &gt; explanation of pagan triune gods 'painted over' (added into) scripture.
&gt; &gt; The idea that God is a &quot;triune god&quot; is not found in the Word of God.

&gt; &gt; Athanasius has also admitted that the triune gods was added to the
&gt; &gt; church after the Bible was completed -- and that those who believe what
&gt; &gt; IS in the Bible will be judged for what they find IN God's Word:
&gt; &gt; Quote:
&gt; &gt; I certainly agree that for those who are truly seperated from the
&gt; &gt; historical Christian Church and her teachings and who have possession
&gt; &gt; of the Holy Bible and have faith in God will not be judged according
&gt; &gt; to what I or any within the historical Church have been exposed to,
&gt; &gt; but will stand before God on the Last day and shall be accountable to
&gt; &gt; Him for what they -did- know and how they loved and responded to
&gt; &gt; others with the little truth they had.

&gt; &gt; Athanasius statement is certainly convoluted, but it is a confession
&gt; &gt; that &quot;trinity doctrine&quot; was unknown to First Century Christians, and
&gt; &gt; that it is unnecessary for salvation.

&gt; &gt; A Christian may, indeed should, believe every Word God gave to describe

&gt; &gt; reject the false doctrine of the triune gods.

&gt;&gt; The bible describes a family from cover to cover, and every family consists of three. Adam was the first child created in the image of God then God separated His image into male and female, neither of them equals and neither more important than the other.  So from the very beginning God created His image as a family - a child and two parents.  When a man and woman come together physically and spiritually as one in God life is carried forward whether or not they have physical children.  That's an image of God.
&gt;&gt; Each of us who are God's spiritual children share this relationship with our Heavenly Father and His Spirit.  The relationship of three exists.
&gt;&gt; Scripture doesn't have to say 'trinity' because it describes it.

&gt;There is more in scripture than we can understand, but relationships
&gt;of threes exist from cover to cover and we (spiritual children of God
&gt;i.e.: saved through belief in Christ and learning from the Spirit) are
&gt;able to understand those.

&gt;Scripture is filled with relationships of threes and they are all
&gt;important.  I have learned that of these relationships are built upon
&gt;the foundation of one:  Water.

&gt;In Jeremiah 2:13 God said &quot;They have forsaken me, the spring of living
&gt;water.&quot;  Zechariah 4:18 prophesies the Christ and God's spiritual
&gt;children of the New Testament: &quot;On that day living water will flow out
&gt;from Jerusalem, half to the eastern sea and half to the western sea,
&gt;in summer and in winter.&quot;  The apostle John described living water in
&gt;chapter 4 and also in Revelation 7 and 22.  Revelation 22 describes
&gt;&quot;the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the
&gt;throne of God and of the Lamb&quot; which ties it back to Jeremiah 2:13 (a
&gt;'spring' is a source, and 'water' is life.)

&gt;Recognizing and understanding the role of physical and spiritual water
&gt;in scripture is important as the physical descriptions and our
&gt;physical understanding helps us understand the spiritual relationships
&gt;that exist there.  It's like Michael Ediger observed in the first post
&gt;of this thread:

&gt;He wrote:&gt; &quot;Many illustrations of this tri-unity have been offered;
&gt;but all fall short of perfectly picturing God's triune nature. For
&gt;example, the family unit is one but made up of distinct persons-
&gt;father, mother, and child. Another oft-used example is the one of
&gt;water-ice-vapor, the three states of moisture. These help despite
&gt;being inadequate.&quot;

&gt;Michael was right on target when he wrote what he did.  Michael
&gt;recognized the relationship existing with water but could not explain
&gt;it.  The explanation exists and it could only come from a spiritual
&gt;child of God outside of his field of study.

&gt;The spiritual bond of a loving family unit (of three) is like the
&gt;nuclear bond of the water molecule.  The two hydrogen atoms are
&gt;physically associated with power and heat, and the oxygen atom is
&gt;physically associated with life and the promise of life.  Our lives
&gt;cannot exist without water, nor can we physically exist without the
&gt;energy of the hydrogen atoms or the life provided through the oxygen
&gt;atom.  Just as we need physical water and it's components to live, we
&gt;also need the family structure described in scripture to live.

&gt;Understanding the physical structures and phases of water in scripture
&gt;help us recognize and understand the spiritual relationships that are
&gt;described there.  Only the spiritual children of God from our physical
&gt;generation are capable of understanding the relationships written into
&gt;scripture concerning water.  Paul expressed in 1 Corinthians 2 that
&gt;the Spirit of God knows the thoughts of God. Paul also said (v14)
&gt;&quot;14The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come
&gt;from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot
&gt;understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.&quot;

&gt;I know what I'm sharing probably isn't clear but I may be able to
&gt;provide enough insight on this subject where it would make more sense
&gt;after a period of evaluation.  This doesn't change the salvation gift
&gt;in any way - it helps us understand it.  I don't know it all but I
&gt;understand this.  What I cannot do well is effectively communicate.

&gt;You know, these threads are both blessings and frustrations.  There's
&gt;a lot of good stuff that disappears into the archives.

Ray,

I appreciate your observations and the time you spent putting your
post together.

Three like the other numbers in the word of God is used with spiritual
significance as it is the number that denotes completeness.  But there
are used with spiritual significance where they are used and not where
they are not used.  While water, steam, and ice may be three forms of
the same substance; each substance is complete in itself and does not
rely on the other forms to be complete.  So in that case the real
number is one which is the number that denotes unity and commencment.

There is one major flaw in the doctrine of the Trinity that cannot be
overcome.  There must be three for a Trinity to exist.  The Father and
the Son make two.  There is no Holy Ghost mentioned in the word of God
(I did not say version).  According to the myth, the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghose exist in heaven as co-equal co-eternal God's that
make One God.  But there is no verse in the Word of God that says that
a Holy Ghost resides in Heaven with the Father and the Son.  There is
only one vese in the King James Version which was corrected in every
following version that says theere is a Holy Ghost in heaven.  Every
other verse in the word of God says there is a holy spirit on the
earth that is the agent or gift of God.

1Jn 5:7-8 KJV
7  For there are three that bear record ** in heaven, the Father, the
Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
8  And there are three that bear witness in earth,** the Spirit, and
the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

The words between asterisks are not found in any Manuscript before the
15th and 16th centuries.  They were in William Tyndale's Bible, the
Bishops Bible, and the Geneva Bible and found their way into the King
James Version but were removed from the RV,ASV, and subsequent
versions.

There are only three other verses in the New testament where the words
Holy Ghost and heaven occur in the same passage and all of them show
that the Holy Ghost is located on the earth and is something that is
lesser than the God that sent it.

Luk 3:22 KJV  And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a
dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my
beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

Act 7:55 KJV  But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up
stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing
on the right hand of God,

1Pe 1:12 KJV  Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but
unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you
by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost
sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.

Of the 380 plus usages of penuma in the Greek New Testament, the
editors of the King James Version deliberately misinterpreted about
180 of the verses by adding to, taking away from, or changing the word
of God.  They did this by adding the definite article to the English
before spirit when it was not in the Greek texct, by omitting the
definite article from the English when it was in the Greek text, by
changing the noun hagion to a proper adjective, by changing the
adjective hagion to a proper adjective, and by changing the noun
pneuma to a proper noun.  They rendered &quot;pneuma hagion&quot; as &quot;the Holy
Ghost&quot; when it should have been rendered &quot;holy spirit&quot;.  They rendered
&quot;to pneuma to hagion&quot; as &quot;the Holy Ghost&quot; when it should have been
rendered &quot;the spirit the holy (spirit)&quot;.

It seems to me that if a Trinity did exist in the word of God,
scholars and theologians would not have to falsify the texts to cause
use to exist.

In 425 AD men got in the habit of voting men to God.  It would have
been nice if God would have said &quot;Jesus is God&quot;; but God did not say
that.  It would have been nice if Jesus said &quot;I am God&quot;, but Jesus did
not say that.  Men took a vote and promoted Jesus to God.  Then they
took another vote and added a third God.  People before them had voted
god's into existence.

Then came the editors of the King james Version, all Trinitarians with
the same religious, political, and philosophical beliefs.  They took a
vote and voted things into the version that proved their belief
systems.

People rationalize lots of things.  Rationalization is no guarantee of
truth.  Truth comes from the word of God; not the opinions and votes
of men.  People make mistakes all the time.  God doesn't and I suspect
that God has a pretty good idea of Who He, His Son and holy spirit
are.  Had God wanted us to believe in a Trinity, He would have told us
to do so.

On my website is a table that shows every usage of pneuma in the Bible
and shows that holy spirit is always on the earth at work for God in
the creation whether as the gift or the agent. You can view the table
on my web site.  It is the link in the bottom left corner of the grid.

&gt;&gt; In fact, even _honest_ trinitarians admit that it was unknown to First
&gt;&gt; Century Christians.

&gt;&gt; History of The Trinity

&gt;&gt; The growth of the doctrine of a triune God, is briefly but plainly, set
&gt;&gt; forth in the following facts:

&gt;&gt; A.D. 29 Jesus said, &quot;The Lord our God is one Lord&quot; (Mark 12:29).

&gt;&gt; A.D. 57 Paul said, &quot;To us there is but one God&quot; (1 Cor. 8:6).

&gt;&gt; A.D. 96 Clement said, &quot;Christ was sent by God&quot;.

&gt;&gt; A.D. 120 &quot;Apostles' Creed&quot;: &quot;I believe in God the Father&quot;.

&gt;&gt; A.D. 150 Justin Martyr, introduces Greek Philosophy.

&gt;&gt; A.D. 170 The word &quot;Trias&quot;, appears first in Christian literature.

&gt;&gt; A.D. 200. &quot;Trinitas&quot; is first introduced by Tertullian.

&gt;&gt; A.D. 280 Origen, opposes prayers to Christ.

&gt;&gt; A.D. 260 Sabellius: &quot;Father, Son and Holy Ghost are three names for the
&gt;&gt; same God&quot;.

&gt;&gt; A.D. 300 Trinitarian prayers unknown in the Church.

&gt;&gt; A.D. 325 &quot;Nicene Creed&quot; affirms Christ to be &quot;Very God of Very God&quot;.

&gt;&gt; A.D. 370 Doxology composed.

&gt;&gt; A.D. 381. Council of Constantinople invents &quot;Three persons in One God&quot;.

&gt;&gt; A.D. 388 Emperor Theodosius threatens punishment to all who won't
&gt;&gt; worship the Trinity.

&gt;&gt; The false doctrine of the &quot;trinity&quot; was &quot;formulated&quot; and or &quot;developed&quot;
&gt;&gt; during the three or four hundred years after the passing of the Apostles
&gt;&gt; -- after the Bible was complete.

&gt;&gt; The false doctrine of the triune god was institutionalized by the pagan

child and two parents&quot; but a child become two children.&quot;

The very most important message in the bible is the message of
salvation through Jesus Christ.  Please remember this above everything
else.  No one has to understand deep scripture and not everyone can.
Read the New Testament and learn about Jesus Christ.  THAT'S what is
important!  When you believe in him your life begins anew.  You'll be
a new creation, spiritual infant and all.  Take what others tell you
and do what you're doing now - ask questions and verify what you are
told against scripture.  Always ask questions and always challenge
what you're told because if you do this you'll eventually understand
the answers and when you do that, there is no more guessing.  But you
have to choose Christ first.  There is no understanding of scripture
until that choice is made and even then, not everything in scripture
can be clearly understood by everyone.  But it sure is interesting.

Now I'll try to answer your question and concluding statement.

My 24 year old daughter is still my child.  I am 54 and always will be
a child of my parents.

When God created Adam, I understand that He created an adult that had
to learn what was right and what was wrong.  Adam was old enough to
make decisions.  He made adult choices and he didn't understand
death.  When God separated His image into male and female he created a
physically mature woman who learned from both God and from Adam. Adam
led woman (she hadn't been given the name 'Eve' yet) to make the
choice in the garden that separated both of them from God.

Luke 3 provides the linage of Jesus Christ beginning from his father
Joseph who adopted him. Pay particular attention to verse 38 which
states: &quot;the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son
of God.&quot;  You will find this link takes you to biblegateway.com the
book of Luke chapter 3
http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=1&amp;chapter;=4&amp;version;=31

Adam and Eve had many, many children after they were forced from the
garden of Eden. All of this (concerning Adam and Eve) is described in
the first four chapters of Genesis.

Your question and observation is good!  Ask questions, challenge the
teacher and compare their answers to what scripture says.  Pray for
understanding - True Christianity is a one-on-one relationship with
the Father through Jesus Christ, and a relationship is not a religion.

&gt; &gt;&gt; forth in the following facts:

&gt; &gt;&gt; A.D. 29 Jesus said, &quot;The Lord our God is one Lord&quot; (Mark 12:29).

&gt; &gt;&gt; A.D. 57 Paul said, &quot;To us there is but one God&quot; (1 Cor. 8:6).

&gt; &gt;&gt; A.D. 96 Clement said, &quot;Christ was sent by God&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; A.D. 120 &quot;Apostles' Creed&quot;: &quot;I believe in God the Father&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; A.D. 150 Justin Martyr, introduces Greek Philosophy.

&gt; &gt;&gt; A.D. 170 The word &quot;Trias&quot;, appears first in Christian literature.

&gt; &gt;&gt; A.D. 200. &quot;Trinitas&quot; is first introduced by Tertullian.

&gt; &gt;&gt; A.D. 280 Origen, opposes prayers to Christ.

&gt; &gt;&gt; A.D. 260 Sabellius: &quot;Father, Son and Holy Ghost are three names for the
&gt; &gt;&gt; same God&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; A.D. 300 Trinitarian prayers unknown in the Church.

&gt; &gt;&gt; A.D. 325 &quot;Nicene Creed&quot; affirms Christ to be &quot;Very God of Very God&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; A.D. 370 Doxology composed.

&gt; &gt;&gt; A.D. 381. Council of Constantinople invents &quot;Three persons in One God&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; A.D. 388 Emperor Theodosius threatens punishment to all who won't
&gt; &gt;&gt; worship the Trinity.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The false doctrine of the &quot;trinity&quot; was &quot;formulated&quot; and or &quot;developed&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; during the three or four hundred years after the passing of the Apostles
&gt; &gt;&gt; -- after the Bible was complete.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The false doctrine of the triune god was institutionalized by the pagan
&gt; &gt;&gt; man/god Constantine in AD 325. The &quot;trinity&quot; is a Greek Metaphysical
&gt; &gt;&gt; explanation of pagan triune gods 'painted over' (added into) scripture.
&gt; &gt;&gt; The idea that God is a &quot;triune god&quot; is not found in the Word of God.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Athanasius has also admitted that the triune gods was added to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; church after the Bible was completed -- and that those who believe what
&gt; &gt;&gt; IS in the Bible will be judged for what they find IN God's Word:
&gt; &gt;&gt; Quote:
&gt; &gt;&gt; I certainly agree that for those who are truly seperated from the
&gt; &gt;&gt; historical Christian Church and her teachings and who have possession
&gt; &gt;&gt; of the Holy Bible and have faith in God will not be judged according
&gt; &gt;&gt; to what I or any within the historical Church have been exposed to,
&gt; &gt;&gt; but will stand before God on the Last day and shall be accountable to
&gt; &gt;&gt; Him for what they -did- know and how they loved and responded to
&gt; &gt;&gt; others with the little truth they had.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Athanasius statement is certainly convoluted, but it is a confession
&gt; &gt;&gt; that &quot;trinity doctrine&quot; was unknown to First Century Christians, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; that it is unnecessary for salvation.

&gt; &gt;&gt; A Christian may, indeed should, believe every Word God gave to describe
&gt; &gt;&gt; and reveal Him Self, His Son and His Holy Spirit to His People -- and
&gt; &gt;&gt; reject the false doctrine of the triune gods.

Thank you Bob,

Every relationship I've been able to find in scripture points to a
trinity.  The understanding I've shared about the child and parents in
Genesis is a strong point but it is only one of them.  My
understanding of water supports this.  The structure of the book of
John supports my understanding.  All of the verses I've located about
the Spirit in the NT agree with all of the verses I've been able to
find in the OT.  I clearly recognize the Spirit in Genesis 1 in the
first few verses.  It isn't the word Spirit that makes me understand
what I do, it is how the Spirit is described.  It's what the verses
speak to me.

I know the Spirit is real because of what I have physically seen and
experienced.  I don't know how to explain the Spirit to you other than
the Spirit gives life and that the words of Christ are spirit and they
are life.  God is the source of life. I haven't read secular materials
about scripture or even the books the thousands of other Christian
people have written to know this.  I have found this truth on my own
through my studies of scripture from Genesis to Revelation and prayer.
I have listened to others and compared what they've said to what
scripture says.  I continually pray for understanding.  The Spirit has
to be real because the structure of scripture describes this truth to
me.

I understand that scripture was written to carry God's understanding
to us through the many language translations of man.  I know that some
people might have changed some words to suit their agenda or an
incorrect word may have been chosen in translations but they couldn't
change the structure of how scripture was written because they
couldn't understand the structure.  The structure remains, nothing has
changed.  The word of God is eternal and our physical generation is
the only one in the written history of man who can begin to grasp the
depth of the information it contains.  He wrote His book for us to
understand and it can be understood.

If you do not understand what I do then that's OK.  Do you believe in
God's promise of eternal life through His Son Jesus Christ?  If you do
then you believe in him? If you believe Jesus Christ is who he says he
is and you confess him to others in the life you live then you are my
brother. This is what matters!  If Jesus Christ wants you to know what
I know then he will make it so.

Jesus calls on us to understand scripture with our heart.  A
dictionary doesn't suffice.  Nor does anything else anyone has said or
written unless we ask questions and evaluate and compare, check and
adjust, and adjust, and adjust.  This is how we grow and mature.  We
emulate Christ.

Scripture is filled with metaphors.  The words of scripture are
defined but defined words are difficult (sometimes impossible) to
understand.  I have found many of the words of scripture to be
metaphors making the verses have double meanings.  This isn't wrong
but right - the metaphors create word pictures so that we as physical
creatures can understand spiritual matters.  Word pictures in writing
are the only way to communicate emotions or thoughts.

I recognize a trinity of God.  I recognize His image as that of a
family and every family has a child and two parents.

Oh, you mentioned the spirit being only on the earth.  Adam was
created from the dust (or elements) of the earth and the breath of
life was breathed into him.  I have learned that Genesis 1 describes
the creations of not one, but three types of heavens and earths.  Our
physical planet earth with its waters on the outside and a heaven
above is one (and it was created for us to understand scripture), Adam
(created from the elements) is an earth with waters on the inside and
a heaven within (something like a mirror image of our planet and
sky).  When we are born again, we become new creations and a third
Genesis occurs.  Paul spoke of a third heaven.  The third heaven is
the spiritual heaven in the Kingdom of God.

God sent His Spirit to earth - to His spiritual children - to help
us.  Read Revelation 12.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The bible describes a family from cover to cover, and every family consists of three. Adam was the first child created in the image of God then God separated His image into male and female, neither of them equals and neither more important than the other.  So from the very beginning God created His image as a family - a child and two parents.  When a man and woman come together physically and spiritually as one in God life is carried forward whether or not they have physical children.  That's an image of God.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Each of us who are God's spiritual children share this relationship with our Heavenly Father and His Spirit.  The relationship of three exists.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Scripture doesn't have to say 'trinity' because it describes it.

&gt; &gt;There is more in scripture than we can understand, but relationships
&gt; &gt;of threes exist from cover to cover and we (spiritual children of God
&gt; &gt;i.e.: saved through belief in Christ and learning from the Spirit) are
&gt; &gt;able to understand those.

&gt; &gt;Scripture is filled with relationships of threes and they are all
&gt; &gt;important.  I have learned that of these relationships are built upon
&gt; &gt;the foundation of one:  Water.

&gt; &gt;In Jeremiah 2:13 God said &quot;They have forsaken me, the spring of living
&gt; &gt;water.&quot;  Zechariah 4:18 prophesies the Christ and God's spiritual
&gt; &gt;children of the New Testament: &quot;On that day living water will flow out
&gt; &gt;from Jerusalem, half to the eastern sea and half to the western sea,
&gt; &gt;in summer and in winter.&quot;  The apostle John described living water in
&gt; &gt;chapter 4 and also in Revelation 7 and 22.  Revelation 22 describes
&gt; &gt;&quot;the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the
&gt; &gt;throne of God and of the Lamb&quot; which ties it back to Jeremiah 2:13 (a
&gt; &gt;'spring' is a source, and 'water' is life.)

&gt; &gt;Recognizing and understanding the role of physical and spiritual water
&gt; &gt;in scripture is important as the physical descriptions and our
&gt; &gt;physical understanding helps us understand the spiritual relationships
&gt; &gt;that exist there.  It's like Michael Ediger observed in the first post
&gt; &gt;of this thread:

&gt; &gt;He wrote:&gt; &quot;Many illustrations of this tri-unity have been offered;
&gt; &gt;but all fall short of perfectly picturing God's triune nature. For
&gt; &gt;example, the family unit is one but made up of distinct persons-
&gt; &gt;father, mother, and child. Another oft-used example is the one of
&gt; &gt;water-ice-vapor, the three states of moisture. These help despite
&gt; &gt;being inadequate.&quot;

&gt; &gt;Michael was right on target when he wrote what he did.  Michael
&gt; &gt;recognized the relationship existing with water but could not explain
&gt; &gt;it.  The explanation exists and it could only come from a spiritual
&gt; &gt;child of God outside of his field of study.

&gt; &gt;The spiritual bond of a loving family unit (of three) is like the
&gt; &gt;nuclear bond of the water molecule.  The two hydrogen atoms are
&gt; &gt;physically associated with power and heat, and the oxygen atom is
&gt; &gt;physically associated with life and the promise of life.  Our lives
&gt; &gt;cannot exist without water, nor can we physically exist without the
&gt; &gt;energy of the hydrogen atoms or the life provided through the oxygen
&gt; &gt;atom.  Just as we need physical water and it's components to live, we
&gt; &gt;also need the family structure described in scripture to live.

&gt; &gt;Understanding the physical structures and phases of water in scripture
&gt; &gt;help us recognize and understand the spiritual relationships that are
&gt; &gt;described there.  Only the spiritual children of God from our physical
&gt; &gt;generation are capable of understanding the relationships written into
&gt; &gt;scripture concerning water.  Paul expressed in 1 Corinthians 2 that
&gt; &gt;the Spirit of God knows the thoughts of God. Paul also said (v14)
&gt; &gt;&quot;14The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come
&gt; &gt;from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot
&gt; &gt;understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.&quot;

&gt; &gt;I know what I'm sharing probably isn't clear but I may be able to
&gt; &gt;provide enough insight on this subject where it would make more sense
&gt; &gt;after a period of evaluation.  This doesn't change the salvation gift
&gt; &gt;in any way - it helps us understand it.  I don't know it all but I
&gt; &gt;understand this.  What I cannot do well is effectively communicate.

&gt; &gt;You know, these threads are both blessings and frustrations.  There's
&gt; &gt;a lot of good stuff that disappears into the archives.

&gt; &gt;Ray

&gt; Ray,

&gt; I appreciate your observations and the time you spent putting your
&gt; post together.

&gt; Three like the other numbers in the word of God is used with spiritual
&gt; significance as it is the number that denotes completeness.  But there
&gt; are used with spiritual significance where they are used and not where
&gt; they are not used.  While water, steam, and ice may be three forms of
&gt; the same substance; each substance is complete in itself and does not
&gt; rely on the other forms to be complete.  So in that case the real
&gt; number is one which is the number that denotes unity and commencment.

&gt; There is one major flaw in the doctrine of the Trinity that cannot be
&gt; overcome.  There must be three for a Trinity to exist.  The Father and
&gt; the Son make two.  There is no Holy Ghost mentioned in the word of God
&gt; (I did not say version).  According to the myth, the Father, the Son
&gt; and the Holy Ghose exist in heaven as co-equal co-eternal God's that
&gt; make One God.  But there is no verse in the Word of God that says that
&gt; a Holy Ghost resides in Heaven with the Father and the Son.  There is
&gt; only one vese in the King James Version which was corrected in every

With regard to the Spirit of Genesis 1:2, it is used in the genitive
of origin (of); that which proceeds our from within God which to my
way of thinking indicates that God gave a piece of Himself to
accomplish the reconsruction of the earth so that it could be
inhabited by those he desired to be part of the great big family that
He desired.  Spirit is used in the figurative sense where the word
&quot;moved&quot; means to &quot;brood&quot; as a chicken broods over its nest indicating
the exertion of an invisible downward force upon the surface of the
earth to put the earth in motion.  The figure is called
Anthropoatheia; ascribing to God what belons to human and rational
creatures, irrational creatures, and inanimate objects.

The Spirit of God in Genesis 1:2 is sesparate from God and is in the
creation; not the heavens and because it was sent by God is lesser
than the Greater and the agent of God at work in the creation.  Hence,
it is not the third person of a Trinity because it is not located in
the heavens with God and not co-equal with nor co-eternal with God.

See page 3 which is page 15 of the pdf here:
http://www.companion-bible.com/CBPdffiles/01%20Genesis%201-71%20Prefa...

It is interesting that you speak of the structure of John because I am
writing an article on John 1 which includes comments about the
structure of the book as a whole and the interrelationship of the book
with the other books called Gospels.  I see, no prologue in the first
chapter, rather the alternated subjects which contrast John 1:1-28
where the subject is the Forerunner with John 21:1-25 where the
subject is the Successors.

See page 1304 here:
http://www.companion-bible.com/CBPdffiles/36%20Matthew%201303-1380.pdf
See page1510 here:
http://www.companion-bible.com/CBPdffiles/39%20John%201510-1574.pdf

The Comforter which is the spirit the holy (spirit) (not &quot;the Holy
Ghost as improperly translated) and the spirit of truth is both the
gift and agent of God that is in the creation sent by God through
Jesus Christ which abides in members of the body of Christ.  It is the
incorruptible seed that makes children of God His children.  It is the
second of two Comforters that exists as it does in the form it exists
during a specific period of time from Petencost to the return of
Christ for His church when we shall all be changed.  Thus we have a
Paraclete (Comforter) with us so that we do not sin and a Paraclete
(Advocate) in heaven with the Father in case we do sin.  Neither
Paraclete is God, but lessers than God sent by God to accomplish His
will on the earth.

Joh 14:16 KJV
And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter,
that he may abide with you for ever;

Joh 14:26 KJV
But the Comforter, {which is} the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things
to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

Above the translation is very wrong.  First, the pronoun &quot;he&quot; refers
to the Comforter because it is the nominative singular masculine
&quot;eikenos&quot; which requires a singular masculine antecedent.  Comforter
from the subsantive &quot;parakleton&quot; is nominative singular masculine and
the antecedent for the pronoun.  Spirit cannot be the antecedent
because spirit is always neuter (here nominative singular neuter) and
a pronoun must agree with its antecedent in number and gender.

The words &quot;the Holy Ghost&quot; are the incorrect translation of &quot;to pneuma
to hagion&quot;; &quot;the spirit the holy (spirit)&quot;.  Normally, when the word
&quot;hagion&quot; (holy) follows &quot;pneuma&quot; (spirit) it is used as an adjective.
In Greek the adjective comes after the noun it modifies but in English
before the noun it modifies.  So, normally, &quot;to pneuma hagion&quot; would
be rendered &quot;the holy spirit&quot; beause the adjective is moved to the
front of &quot;pneuma&quot; so the ENglish would read &quot;the holy spirit.&quot;

But this verse is one of about 26 or 27 special verses were the phrase
&quot;to pneuma to hagion&quot; occurs.  The second definite article &quot;to&quot; before
&quot;hagion&quot; causes &quot;hagion&quot; to be come a noun.  Greek adjectives become
nouns when they are preceded by the definite aticle.  Therefore, since
&quot;hagion&quot; is a noun the editors had no authority to drop the second
definite article, change the noun back to an adjective, or convert the
common noun (pneuma) and the common known (hagion) to a proper
adjective (Holy) and to a proper noun (Ghost).  This bogus translation
format was used in every case where the equivalent of &quot;to pneuma to
hagion&quot; occurs in the Greek.  That means that in 25 plus verses the
editors deliberately falsified the text.

The verse should read:

Joh 14:26
But the Comforter, {which is} the spirit the holy (spirit), whom the
Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring
all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

Therefore, the spirit the holy is that which was sent and is therefore
separate from and lesser than the Giver (God).  In addition to the 26
deliberate forgeries of this type there are also 52 other
falsifications of the text where the editors added the definite
article by pneuma to change the text to read &quot;the Holy Ghost&quot; rather
than &quot;holy spirit&quot;, and also many times where the omitted the definite
article when it contradicted their doctrines.

Joh 15:26 KJV
But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the
Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he
shall testify of me:

Joh 16:7 KJV
Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go
away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but
if I depart, I will send him unto you.

1Jn 2:1 KJV
My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.
And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
the righteous:

The bottom line is that the edirors falsfied the text to indicate that
a third person of the Trinity exists.  There is no verse in the word
of God that says there is a Holy Ghost in heaven other than the
falsified version of 1st John 5:7,8.

1Jn 5:7-8 KJV
7  For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the
Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
8  And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the
water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

The above text occurs only in manuscripts from the 15th and 16th
centuries.  Vesions after the KJV corrected the falsification of the
text which occured in William Tyndale's Bible, the Bishops Bible, the
Geneva Bible, and the KJV.  The verses should read as follows:

1Jn 5:7-8 RV
7  And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is
the truth.
8  For there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water,
and the blood: and the three agree in one.

1Jn 5:7-8 ASV
7  And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is
the truth.
8  For there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water,
and the blood: and the three agree in one.

1Jn 5:7-8 NASB
7  For there are three that testify:
8  the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are in
agreement.

There is no Greek New Testament verse in the word of God that says
that there is a &quot;the Holy Ghost&quot; that is co-qual and co-eternal
residing in the heavens with the Father.

There is no doubt that there is a Spirit (in heaven)  and a spirit (on
the earth) because the word of God says so.  Also because we are able
to perceive the operations and manifestations of the spirit in the
creation.  Prayer is nice and appropriate.  The Scriptures are that
which God has given us to read using our five senses to know about
God.  The spirit is that which God has given us to confirm the truth
of the Scriptures and to bring the power of God into our lives through
the application of the principles in the word of God.  The Comforter
brings to &quot;rememberence&quot; what we have stored in our brain that was
taught to us by Jesus Christ.  The New testament is the revelation
from Jesus Christ.  Therefore, we need to put the word in our minds so
that the Comforter can cause it to be remembered and understood.  It
can not cause us to remember what we have not already &quot;membered,&quot;
unless in the case of revelation where word of knowledge, word of
wisdom, and discerning of spirits takes palce for a specific purpose.

Hi Bob,

All of this goes back to the creation story.  It is all related.
However, we are not in different camps.

God created Adam and from Adam created woman.  Genesis 24 states: &quot;For
this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to
his wife, and they will become one flesh.&quot;

God created us in His image.  When he created woman he separated His
image.  Woman historically has provided the children with the
understanding of her husband.  Woman has historically been the
caregiver and the teacher to help the children grow and mature.  The
instructions and guidance of the mother live with the children for the
rest of their lives.  The male historically has been away from home
supporting his family. Both of them love their children and show their
love in different ways. The children are with the mother much more
than their father.

What is described in scripture is there for a reason.  God revealed
His image as male and female to us for a reason.  God didn't just
haphazardly create male and female out of a whim. The description of
the creation story of man shows us how to understand Him
spiritually.

When a man and a woman come together physically in the blessing of
God, a child is sometimes conceived.  Man or woman by themselves
cannot create a child - they have to come together and become one.
This is true for physical children, it is also true for spiritual
children.

God and his Spirit are one.  They may be described as two because we,
men and women, are His creations and He has given us this image but
when a child is conceived and brought into the world the two parents
work as one to raise the child.  Consider what the New Testament is.

There are three sections of the bible.
The first section is life before the flood.  God the provider gave
children everything and asked for nothing.  There was no spiritual
understanding in His creations or no presence of His Spirit in the
lives of Adam' or his descendents.  The world became a very wicked and
evil place.  This is akin to one parent providing for their child or
children without any restrictions or guidance.

The second section describes only God or His Spirit.  God spoke
through or placed His Spirit on one leader or a prophet at a time and
there were many that mimiked Him.  All that God's chosen people
understood of God was that He spoke to them and acted through one
person. God made rules they didn't understand.  They could not
understand His ways and they always quickly turned away from Him.
Although God manifested Himself before the nation of Israel many times
they had no understanding only fear (fright) and they learned that
when God was away they could seemingly do what they wanted or thought
was best.  They always fell back to the ways of life before the flood.

This is what happens to us when we do not understand the reasons
behind our rules or laws.  We find that we might do something wrong
and get away with it and our wrongful actions get more frequent and
bolder.  Our physical children and some of God's spiritual children
who know us follow our example.  Eventually we get hurt yet our
momentum keeps on rolling through our children.  The prophets were
ignored or hated or killed because people didn't understand the ways
of God.

The third section is today.  God has poured his Spirit out on all of
His spiritual children.  When Jesus Christ was born a new creation was
born into the world.  This spiritual creation was a result of God and
His Spirit coming together as one.  God and Spirit as one conceived
and brought forth into our world a spiritual child, just as a man and
a woman come together as one and conceives and brings forth into our
world a physical child.  Responsible parents work together as one to
raise their children and our God has a lot of children.

For the reasons I have shared I clearly understand the image of our
God as three:  Father, Spirit, Child. I also now understand God's
spiritual family structure as two: Father-Spirit, Child.  The latter
would be why you understand as you do.  I've learned something new!

The way I see it, we're in the same camp.

&gt; &gt;Thank you Bob,

&gt; &gt;Every relationship I've been able to find in scripture points to a
&gt; &gt;trinity.  The understanding I've shared about the child and parents in
&gt; &gt;Genesis is a strong point but it is only one of them.  My
&gt; &gt;understanding of water supports this.  The structure of the book of
&gt; &gt;John supports my understanding.  All of the verses I've located about
&gt; &gt;the Spirit in the NT agree with all of the verses I've been able to
&gt; &gt;find in the OT.  I clearly recognize the Spirit in Genesis 1 in the
&gt; &gt;first few verses.  It isn't the word Spirit that makes me understand
&gt; &gt;what I do, it is how the Spirit is described.  It's what the verses
&gt; &gt;speak to me.

&gt; With regard to the Spirit of Genesis 1:2, it is used in the genitive
&gt; of origin (of); that which proceeds our from within God which to my
&gt; way of thinking indicates that God gave a piece of Himself to
&gt; accomplish the reconsruction of the earth so that it could be
&gt; inhabited by those he desired to be part of the great big family that
&gt; He desired.  Spirit is used in the figurative sense where the word
&gt; &quot;moved&quot; means to &quot;brood&quot; as a chicken broods over its nest indicating
&gt; the exertion of an invisible downward force upon the surface of the
&gt; earth to put the earth in motion.  The figure is called
&gt; Anthropoatheia; ascribing to God what belons to human and rational
&gt; creatures, irrational creatures, and inanimate objects.

&gt; The Spirit of God in Genesis 1:2 is sesparate from God and is in the
&gt; creation; not the heavens and because it was sent by God is lesser
&gt; than the Greater and the agent of God at work in the creation.  Hence,
&gt; it is not the third person of a Trinity because it is not located in
&gt; the heavens with God and not co-equal with nor co-eternal with God.

&gt; See page 3 which is page 15 of the pdf here: http://www.companion-bible.com/CBPdffiles/01%20Genesis%201-71%20Prefa ...

&gt; It is interesting that you speak of the structure of John because I am
&gt; writing an article on John 1 which includes comments about the
&gt; structure of the book as a whole and the interrelationship of the book
&gt; with the other books called Gospels.  I see, no prologue in the first
&gt; chapter, rather the alternated subjects which contrast John 1:1-28
&gt; where the subject is the Forerunner with John 21:1-25 where the
&gt; subject is the Successors.

&gt; See page 1304 here: http://www.companion-bible.com/CBPdffiles/36%20Matthew%201303-1380.pdf
&gt; See page1510 here: http://www.companion-bible.com/CBPdffiles/39%20John%201510-1574.pdf

&gt; The Comforter which is the spirit the holy (spirit) (not &quot;the Holy
&gt; Ghost as improperly translated) and the spirit of truth is both the
&gt; gift and agent of God that is in the creation sent by God through
&gt; Jesus Christ which abides in members of the body of Christ.  It is the
&gt; incorruptible seed that makes children of God His children.  It is the
&gt; second of two Comforters that exists as it does in the form it exists
&gt; during a specific period of time from Petencost to the return of
&gt; Christ for His church when we shall all be changed.  Thus we have a
&gt; Paraclete (Comforter) with us so that we do not sin and a Paraclete
&gt; (Advocate) in heaven with the Father in case we do sin.  Neither
&gt; Paraclete is God, but lessers than God sent by God to accomplish His
&gt; will on the earth.

&gt; Joh 14:16 KJV
&gt; And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter,
&gt; that he may abide with you for ever;

&gt; Joh 14:26 KJV
&gt; But the Comforter, {which is} the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
&gt; send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things
&gt; to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

&gt; Above the translation is very wrong.  First, the pronoun &quot;he&quot; refers
&gt; to the Comforter because it is the nominative singular masculine
&gt; &quot;eikenos&quot; which requires a singular masculine antecedent.  Comforter
&gt; from the subsantive &quot;parakleton&quot; is nominative singular masculine and
&gt; the antecedent for the pronoun.  Spirit cannot be the antecedent
&gt; because spirit is always neuter (here nominative singular neuter) and
&gt; a pronoun must agree with its antecedent in number and gender.

&gt; The words &quot;the Holy Ghost&quot; are the incorrect translation of &quot;to pneuma
&gt; to hagion&quot;; &quot;the spirit the holy (spirit)&quot;.  Normally, when the word
&gt; &quot;hagion&quot; (holy) follows &quot;pneuma&quot; (spirit) it is used as an adjective.
&gt; In Greek the adjective comes after the noun it modifies but in English
&gt; before the noun it modifies.  So, normally, &quot;to pneuma hagion&quot; would
&gt; be rendered &quot;the holy spirit&quot; beause the adjective is moved to the
&gt; front of &quot;pneuma&quot; so the ENglish would read &quot;the holy spirit.&quot;

&gt; But this verse is one of about 26 or 27 special verses were the phrase
&gt; &quot;to pneuma to hagion&quot; occurs.  The second definite article &quot;to&quot; before
&gt; &quot;hagion&quot; causes &quot;hagion&quot; to be come a noun.  Greek adjectives become
&gt; nouns when they are preceded by the definite aticle.  Therefore, since
&gt; &quot;hagion&quot; is a noun the editors had no authority to drop the second
&gt; definite article, change the noun back to an adjective, or convert the
&gt; common noun (pneuma) and the common known (hagion) to a proper
&gt; adjective (Holy) and to a proper noun (Ghost).  This bogus translation
&gt; format was used in every case where the equivalent of &quot;to pneuma to
&gt; hagion&quot; occurs in the Greek.  That means that in 25 plus verses the
&gt; editors deliberately falsified the text.

&gt; The verse should read:

&gt; Joh 14:26
&gt; But the Comforter, {which is} the spirit the holy (spirit), whom the
&gt; Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring
&gt; all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

&gt; Therefore, the spirit the holy is that which was sent and is therefore

&gt;Hi Bob,

&gt;All of this goes back to the creation story.  It is all related.
&gt;However, we are not in different camps.

&gt;God created Adam and from Adam created woman.  Genesis 24 states: &quot;For
&gt;this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to
&gt;his wife, and they will become one flesh.&quot;
">

MP6,

You are getting your verbs confused.  Created from &quot;bara&quot; means to
cause to exist that which has not existed before, something from
nothing.  Made from &quot;asah&quot; means to take what already exists and mix
or unmix it to produce something as water and coffe grounds over heat
makes coffee.   Formed from &quot;yatsar&quot; means to form or fashion from
something as a vessel from clay.  The word used of woman was none of
these; but a different verb, &quot;banah&quot; to build.

Gen 2:22 KJV
And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman,
and brought her unto the man.

The body of woman was built.  But the spirit part of woman was created
(bara) on the 6th day, the same day the body of man was formed.

Gen 1:27 KJV
So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he
him; male and female created he them.

What is the image of God?  God is invisible spirit.  Spirit does not
cast a shadow or a reflection; hence as a representation of God;
spirit.

Gen 2:7 KJV
And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

Now the name changes from God to Lord God which is the same God in
covenant relationship with the creation as man's supplier.  Here a
body is supplied to hold the spirit and soul which are imparted into
the man.  The spirit of man was created, the soul of man was mde, and
the body of man was formed.  God does not breathe because God is
spirit.  The figure is Anthropopatheia used to indicate that God
imparted life into man from within His own self.

God did not create woman from man.  God created man and woman, and
then built the woman from man; specifically from behind the rib - the
bone marrow so that the DNA of man was used to build the woman.  The
children produced by the couple would have been perfect if it were not
for the sin committed by them in the garden.  Which by the way was
caused by wrongly divideding the word of truth by not paying attention
to how words are used.  Eve added to the word, omitted from the word,
and changed the word and was left with no rightly divided word of
truth.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;God created us in His image.  When he created woman he separated His
&gt;image.  Woman historically has provided the children with the
&gt;understanding of her husband.  Woman has historically been the
&gt;caregiver and the teacher to help the children grow and mature.  The
&gt;instructions and guidance of the mother live with the children for the
&gt;rest of their lives.  The male historically has been away from home
&gt;supporting his family. Both of them love their children and show their
&gt;love in different ways. The children are with the mother much more
&gt;than their father.
">

That is not what the word of God says.  It says God created man (Adam)
in his image, male and female created they him.  It does not say that
God created any other men or women.  All other men and women came from
their mommies and daddies when they were made.  You daddy and mommy
made you; not God.  God se the process in motion but what is produced
is the responsibility of the parents that produce it.  God don't
create crack babies; parents do.  God does not make genetically
defective babies, daddies and mommies do.

There is nothing in the Bible that I know of that says God separated
his image.  It does say &quot;male and female created he them&quot;; nothing
about separation.

By the way, who was it that said:

Gen 2:24 KJV
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

It was Adam the ruler of the earth.  The man responsible for making
laws applicable to all creatures on the earth.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What is described in scripture is there for a reason.  God revealed
&gt;His image as male and female to us for a reason.  God didn't just
&gt;haphazardly create male and female out of a whim. The description of
&gt;the creation story of man shows us how to understand Him
&gt;spiritually.
">

There is no creation story.  It is the account of the reconstruction
of the earth so that it could be inhabited.  The first earth as
created and became toho va boho.  The second earth was made and
formed, established, to be inhabited:

Isa 45:18 KJV
For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that
formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it
not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is
none else.

No He did not reveal that he was a female.  Read the verse.

Gen 1:27 KJV
So God created man [Heb adam]  in his own image, in the image of God
created he him; male and female created he them.

God created Adam in his own image.  He even told us twice so we would
not misunderstand what he said.  (1) God created Adam in his own
image, (2) in the image of God created he &quot;him&quot;.  Then it says male
and female created he them.  God is not a female.  Actually, God is
neither masculine or feminine with regard to sex because he has no sex
in the human sense because he does not reproduce as humans do.  His
offspiring are created.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;When a man and a woman come together physically in the blessing of
&gt;God, a child is sometimes conceived.  Man or woman by themselves
&gt;cannot create a child - they have to come together and become one.
&gt;This is true for physical children, it is also true for spiritual
&gt;children.
">

Has nothing to do with the blessing of God.  Any man and woman can
make a baby if they are physically capable.  God has nothing to do
with it; other than providing the process.  When God does get involved
in the impregnation of a woman it is phenomena; not natural.  Well,
blessing means &quot;speak well of&quot; so it you mean God approves of
childbirth, then yes He does.  No spirital chidlren cannot reproduce.
God does not reproduce as humans reporduce nor do angels.  Each spirit
being is a created being.  That's why we who are saved are new
creations in Christ Jesus.  Babies are not born born again.  They are
holy (pure) but not saved until they confes Jesus as Lord.  The the
spirit part of them is created in them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;God and his Spirit are one.  They may be described as two because we,
&gt;men and women, are His creations and He has given us this image but
&gt;when a child is conceived and brought into the world the two parents
&gt;work as one to raise the child.  Consider what the New Testament is.
">

Which spirit?  And do you mean one in number or one in purpose?  God
is one spirit.  On the earth is holy spirit.  How many holy spirits
are there if there is a Comforter in each believer?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;There are three sections of the bible.
&gt;The first section is life before the flood.  God the provider gave
&gt;children everything and asked for nothing.  There was no spiritual
&gt;understanding in His creations or no presence of His Spirit in the
&gt;lives of Adam' or his descendents.  The world became a very wicked and
&gt;evil place.  This is akin to one parent providing for their child or
&gt;children without any restrictions or guidance.

&gt;The second section describes only God or His Spirit.  God spoke
&gt;through or placed His Spirit on one leader or a prophet at a time and
&gt;there were many that mimiked Him.  All that God's chosen people
&gt;understood of God was that He spoke to them and acted through one

&gt;they had no understanding only fear (fright) and they learned that
&gt;when God was away they could seemingly do what they wanted or thought
&gt;was best.  They always fell back to the ways of life before the flood.

&gt;This is what happens to us when we do not understand the reasons
&gt;behind our rules or laws.  We find that we might do something wrong
&gt;and get away with it and our wrongful actions get more frequent and
&gt;bolder.  Our physical children and some of God's spiritual children
&gt;who know us follow our example.  Eventually we get hurt yet our
&gt;momentum keeps on rolling through our children.  The prophets were
&gt;ignored or hated or killed because people didn't understand the ways
&gt;of God.

&gt;The third section is today.  God has poured his Spirit out on all of
&gt;His spiritual children.  When Jesus Christ was born a new creation was
&gt;born into the world.  This spiritual creation was a result of God and
&gt;His Spirit coming together as one.  God and Spirit as one conceived
&gt;and brought forth into our world a spiritual child, just as a man and
&gt;a woman come together as one and conceives and brings forth into our
&gt;world a physical child.  Responsible parents work together as one to
&gt;raise their children and our God has a lot of children.
">

You missed something.  If you are talking about dispensations, then
there are at least six or seven of them.  Let's see, there is the
original paradise, then the patriarchal, then the Law, then grace,
then the appearing, then back to paradise.  I think there is one more
in there somewhere.  I'd have to do some research.

Jesus Christ was not created when he was born.  He was concieved &quot;of&quot;
holy spirit; not &quot;the Holy Ghost&quot; and that pregancy produced a normal
human who was genetically perfect because no blood was contributed to
the child by a human father.  For about thirty years he was a body and
soul man.  Then spirit was put upon him; not created.  He did not get
spirit in him until the resurrection.  When he appeared to the
disciples he was flesh and bones; not flesh and blood.  Spirit
replaced the soul (the shed blood) in the resurrected body.  God said
&quot;I did not have sexual intercourse with that woman.&quot;  God don't lie.

Bob and all,

I want to share this - I know it's lengthy but it what you'll read
supports who Christ is.  I wrote it a while back and have shared it
with my friends in other places.
*********

I've made statements that the Holy Spirit is much like a loving
mother, or a loving caregiver. I've also made the statement that the
Holy Spirit is a part of who God is.

I studied the New Testament and made a list of the verses identifying
the Holy Spirit and then listed the quality or qualities described by
each verse.  It is pretty interesting because as I learned about the
the Spirit of God I learned about Jesus Christ.  I also recognized
many qualities of the woman I am married to.

My wife and I have six children, two adopted. We are a Christian
family, and the following paragraph is a description of my wife from
the eyes of me and my children:

My wife (my children's mother) is a teacher, a counselor, a giver of
power, and can be likened to water in that she fills them with all
that God has given her.  We know that she is truthful.  She is a
promise to us and a gift from God.  Her instructions to the children
speak through others.  She is a witness and her teachings are received
by them.  She is an encourager and is an anointment to them from God.
The results of her training come upon others as others listen to and
observe them. She gives guidance and direction.  She is an instructor,
has authority, is a loving wife to me and is my partner.  She is an
instrument of our Fathers love.  She is powerful.  Her love and
instructions indwells their bodies.  She's a giver of knowledge and
provides fellowship with them and their friends.  She is a giver of
joy, an assistor, and constantly renews their tired spirits.  She is a
giver of gifts and she shares what she has.  My wife is an instructor,
a guide, and she testifies God's truth to them.  She is their prayer
partner and I know she was sent to us from heaven.  She is a living
example of Gods love to everyone she comes into contact with. My wife
is the mother of my children and the woman that I love.

The picture I just painted of my wife come from words that Jesus
Christ and his disciples used to describe the Holy Spirit. What I just
described is a Godly wife and mother and a loving caregiver. Yet if
you read the descriptions in the verses below you should recognize the
qualities of Jesus Christ!  I encourage you to read each of the verses
in context and list your own observations. If you are a woman, read
about how our God created you to be in His image.

This does not mean that the Holy Spirit is a woman - it means that the
Spirit of God falls on all of as and each of us is able to perform the
role as the situation calls for. God created man - male and female -
in His image. We are not equals yet neither of us are more important
than the other.  He gave us different qualities so that together we
and our family can be strong. Our families are physical creations of
our God's spiritual structure and we - our families - represent who
and what our God is.

Our children learn about God through the living examples of their
parents. Understanding our God is difficult without help and we -
Godly parents - provide our children with the visual and physical
concepts of our God's spiritual love. We as parents are God's examples
of who and what He is like. We are the stewards of his children. The
Father and His Spirit are the blueprint examples of a husband and his
wife. Godly men and women are individuals who come together in a
marriage as one just as the Father and the Holy Spirit are one.

Glory to God in the Highest!
Ray

The following is a list of the qualities of the Holy Spirit as
described by Jesus and his disciples. What I have written is my

&gt;Bob and all,

&gt;I want to share this - I know it's lengthy but it what you'll read
&gt;supports who Christ is.  I wrote it a while back and have shared it
&gt;with my friends in other places.
&gt;*********

&gt;I've made statements that the Holy Spirit is much like a loving
&gt;mother, or a loving caregiver. I've also made the statement that the
&gt;Holy Spirit is a part of who God is.

&gt;I studied the New Testament and made a list of the verses identifying
&gt;the Holy Spirit and then listed the quality or qualities described by
&gt;each verse.  It is pretty interesting because as I learned about the
&gt;the Spirit of God I learned about Jesus Christ.  I also recognized
&gt;many qualities of the woman I am married to.

&gt;My wife and I have six children, two adopted. We are a Christian
&gt;family, and the following paragraph is a description of my wife from
&gt;the eyes of me and my children:

&gt;My wife (my children's mother) is a teacher, a counselor, a giver of
&gt;power, and can be likened to water in that she fills them with all
&gt;that God has given her.  We know that she is truthful.  She is a
&gt;promise to us and a gift from God.  Her instructions to the children
&gt;speak through others.  She is a witness and her teachings are received
&gt;by them.  She is an encourager and is an anointment to them from God.
&gt;The results of her training come upon others as others listen to and
&gt;observe them. She gives guidance and direction.  She is an instructor,
&gt;has authority, is a loving wife to me and is my partner.  She is an
&gt;instrument of our Fathers love.  She is powerful.  Her love and
&gt;instructions indwells their bodies.  She's a giver of knowledge and
&gt;provides fellowship with them and their friends.  She is a giver of
&gt;joy, an assistor, and constantly renews their tired spirits.  She is a
&gt;giver of gifts and she shares what she has.  My wife is an instructor,
&gt;a guide, and she testifies God's truth to them.  She is their prayer
&gt;partner and I know she was sent to us from heaven.  She is a living
&gt;example of Gods love to everyone she comes into contact with. My wife
&gt;is the mother of my children and the woman that I love.

&gt;The picture I just painted of my wife come from words that Jesus
&gt;Christ and his disciples used to describe the Holy Spirit. What I just
&gt;described is a Godly wife and mother and a loving caregiver. Yet if
&gt;you read the descriptions in the verses below you should recognize the
&gt;qualities of Jesus Christ!  I encourage you to read each of the verses
&gt;in context and list your own observations. If you are a woman, read
&gt;about how our God created you to be in His image.

&gt;This does not mean that the Holy Spirit is a woman - it means that the
&gt;Spirit of God falls on all of as and each of us is able to perform the
&gt;role as the situation calls for. God created man - male and female -
&gt;in His image. We are not equals yet neither of us are more important
&gt;than the other.  He gave us different qualities so that together we
&gt;and our family can be strong. Our families are physical creations of
&gt;our God's spiritual structure and we - our families - represent who
&gt;and what our God is.

&gt;Our children learn about God through the living examples of their
&gt;parents. Understanding our God is difficult without help and we -
&gt;Godly parents - provide our children with the visual and physical
&gt;concepts of our God's spiritual love. We as parents are God's examples
&gt;of who and what He is like. We are the stewards of his children. The
&gt;Father and His Spirit are the blueprint examples of a husband and his
&gt;wife. Godly men and women are individuals who come together in a
&gt;marriage as one just as the Father and the Holy Spirit are one.

&gt;Glory to God in the Highest!
&gt;Ray

&gt;The following is a list of the qualities of the Holy Spirit as
&gt;described by Jesus and his disciples. What I have written is my
&gt;understanding from each of these verses - I encourage the reader to
&gt;read the verses in context and compare my understanding to yours.  See
&gt;if you are able to recognize the Holy Spirit as a loving caregiver.

You wrote this:&gt; &quot;God did not create woman from man.  God created man
and woman, and then built the woman from man; specifically from behind
the rib - the
bone marrow so that the DNA of man was used to build the woman.  The
children produced by the couple would have been perfect if it were not
for the sin committed by them in the garden.  Which by the way was
caused by wrongly divideding the word of truth by not paying attention
to how words are used.  Eve added to the word, omitted from the word,
and changed the word and was left with no rightly divided word of
truth.&quot;

Genesis clearly states that God created Adam first.  You may be right
about the DNA but that is not verifiable.  You are adding your own
interpretation - formulated guess - into your statement above.  You
cannot make a statement of truth soly based on what man thinks he
knows today.

I am Eve's advocate.  Eve (woman) did not exist when God gave Adam the
'what not to do' instructions.  Nowhere is it mentioned that God told
woman any of what He told Adam.  The information she told the serpent
had to have come from her understanding of what Adam told her.  Read
the words that God told Adam and what she said to the serpent.  They
are different.  And if you look closely at what is recorded, Adam was
with her and he didn't correct her. To carry this even farther, Adam
and woman were super people - intellectually superior to man today
(Genesis 1- 4 validates me).  Adam's memory would have been perfect.
Adam led her to that 'tree' and watched her interactions with the
serpent and he watched her take the 'fruit' and 'eat' it.  When he saw
her pleasure and saw that she didn't die he 'ate' it too. And then
they felt guilt and shame.  God created Adam in His image.  He told
Adam he could do anything except one thing.  There is only one thing
that He would have prohibited and that was that His image was not to
be defiled.  Adam was willing to let woman die just to see what would
happen because he had no concept of death.

And I am not getting my 'verbs confused'.  You are incorrect in your
assumption that I am a word 'picker aparter' as you project.  I am
reading what I have available which is what my Father has provided for
me.  I am not totally relying on the strict definition of words as you
seem to do, I am reading their understanding - what they are
communicating and I am learning that way.  I recognize that many of
the words have double meanings, both of them true in every case.  I am
able to do this because I can see them.  The apostle John revealed
this to me from the structure of his writings.  I just shared in a
previous post how I am able to understand how you do not believe in a
trinity and how you understand the Spirit as you do and I am in
agreement with you on the Father-Spirit-Son issue, I think.  I
explained what I understood.  You did not comment on it so I do not
know what you think.

I'm not knocking what you think you know - I have learned from you.
Bob, It is not good to talk down to others when you may have lost
sight of where you are.

You have mentioned the spirit on earth several times.  Most people do
not know what 'earth' is.  Every human is 'earth'.  I briefly touched
on it earlier but didn't go very far.  I can share insight and show
the development of this understanding but not tonight - it's too late.

&gt; &gt;Hi Bob,

&gt; &gt;All of this goes back to the creation story.  It is all related.
&gt; &gt;However, we are not in different camps.

&gt; &gt;God created Adam and from Adam created woman.  Genesis 24 states: &quot;For
&gt; &gt;this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to
&gt; &gt;his wife, and they will become one flesh.&quot;

&gt; MP6,

&gt; You are getting your verbs confused.  Created from &quot;bara&quot; means to
&gt; cause to exist that which has not existed before, something from
&gt; nothing.  Made from &quot;asah&quot; means to take what already exists and mix
&gt; or unmix it to produce something as water and coffe grounds over heat
&gt; makes coffee.   Formed from &quot;yatsar&quot; means to form or fashion from
&gt; something as a vessel from clay.  The word used of woman was none of
&gt; these; but a different verb, &quot;banah&quot; to build.

&gt; Gen 2:22 KJV
&gt; And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman,
&gt; and brought her unto the man.

&gt; The body of woman was built.  But the spirit part of woman was created
&gt; (bara) on the 6th day, the same day the body of man was formed.

&gt; Gen 1:27 KJV
&gt; So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he
&gt; him; male and female created he them.

&gt; What is the image of God?  God is invisible spirit.  Spirit does not
&gt; cast a shadow or a reflection; hence as a representation of God;
&gt; spirit.

&gt; Gen 2:7 KJV
&gt; And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
&gt; into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

&gt; Now the name changes from God to Lord God which is the same God in
&gt; covenant relationship with the creation as man's supplier.  Here a
&gt; body is supplied to hold the spirit and soul which are imparted into
&gt; the man.  The spirit of man was created, the soul of man was mde, and
&gt; the body of man was formed.  God does not breathe because God is
&gt; spirit.  The figure is Anthropopatheia used to indicate that God
&gt; imparted life into man from within His own self.

&gt; God did not create woman from man.  God created man and woman, and
&gt; then built the woman from man; specifically from behind the rib - the
&gt; bone marrow so that the DNA of man was used to build the woman.  The
&gt; children produced by the couple would have been perfect if it were not
&gt; for the sin committed by them in the garden.  Which by the way was
&gt; caused by wrongly divideding the word of truth by not paying attention
&gt; to how words are used.  Eve added to the word, omitted from the word,
&gt; and changed the word and was left with no rightly divided word of
&gt; truth.

&gt; &gt;God created us in His image.  When he created woman he separated His
&gt; &gt;image.  Woman historically has provided the children with the
&gt; &gt;understanding of her husband.  Woman has historically been the
&gt; &gt;caregiver and the teacher to help the children grow and mature.  The
&gt; &gt;instructions and guidance of the mother live with the children for the
&gt; &gt;rest of their lives.  The male historically has been away from home
&gt; &gt;supporting his family. Both of them love their children and show their
&gt; &gt;love in different ways. The children are with the mother much more
&gt; &gt;than their father.

&gt; That is not what the word of God says.  It says God created man (Adam)
&gt; in his image, male and female created they him.  It does not say that
&gt; God created any other men or women.  All other men and women came from
&gt; their mommies and daddies when they were made.  You daddy and mommy
&gt; made you; not God.  God se the process in motion but what is produced
&gt; is the responsibility of the parents that produce it.  God don't
&gt; create crack babies; parents do.  God does not make genetically
&gt; defective babies, daddies and mommies do.

&gt; There is nothing in the Bible that I know of that says God separated
&gt; his image.  It does say &quot;male and female created he them&quot;; nothing
&gt; about separation.

&gt; By the way, who was it that said:

&gt; Gen 2:24 KJV
&gt; Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
&gt; cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

&gt; It was Adam the ruler of the earth.  The man responsible for making
&gt; laws applicable to all creatures on the earth.

&gt; &gt;What is described in scripture is there for a reason.  God revealed
&gt; &gt;His image as male and female to us for a reason.  God didn't just
&gt; &gt;haphazardly create male and female out of a whim. The description of
&gt; &gt;the creation story of man shows us how to understand Him
&gt; &gt;spiritually.

&gt; There is no creation story.  It is the account of the reconstruction
&gt; of the earth so that it could be inhabited.  The first earth as
&gt; created and became toho va boho.  The second earth was made and
&gt; formed, established, to be inhabited:

&gt; Isa 45:18 KJV
&gt; For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that
&gt; formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it
&gt; not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is
&gt; none else.

&gt; No He did not reveal that he was a female.  Read the verse.

&gt; Gen 1:27 KJV
&gt; So God created man [Heb adam]  in his own image, in the image of God
&gt; created he him; male and female created he them.

&gt; God created Adam in his own image.  He even told us twice so we would
&gt; not misunderstand what he said.  (1) God created Adam in his own
&gt; image, (2) in the image of God created he &quot;him&quot;.  Then it says male
&gt; and female created he them.  God is not a female.  Actually, God is
&gt; neither masculine or feminine with regard to sex because he has no sex
&gt; in the human sense because he does not reproduce as humans do.  His
&gt; offspiring are created.

&gt; &gt;When a man and a woman come together physically in the blessing of
&gt; &gt;God, a child is sometimes conceived.  Man or woman by themselves
&gt; &gt;cannot create a child - they have to come together and become one.
&gt; &gt;This is true for physical children, it is also true for spiritual
&gt; &gt;children.

&gt; Has nothing to do with the blessing of God.  Any man and woman can
&gt; make a baby if they are physically capable.  God has nothing to do
&gt; with it; other than providing the process.  When God does get involved
&gt; in the impregnation of a woman it is phenomena; not natural.  Well,
&gt; blessing means &quot;speak well of&quot; so it you mean God approves of
&gt; childbirth, then yes He does.  No spirital chidlren cannot reproduce.
&gt; God does not reproduce as humans reporduce nor do angels.  Each spirit
&gt; being is a created being.  That's why we who are saved are new
&gt; creations in Christ Jesus.  Babies are not born born again.  They are
&gt; holy (pure) but not saved

E: May or may not be a divine through their own will, may be a victim
of apotheosis [the Chinese pantheon is a good example of these types of
gods.]

Germanic in origin.
