Aunty Suu, we are living in hope or Our only wish is to see a win-win
situation -1

Chan Mya Aye

I am just an ordinary member of the public like the others. And as an
ordinary person I am able to share and appreciate the aspirations,
convictions and hopes of most of the people. Besides, I believe in and
support democracy. I am a person who is actually in favour of the
nation's present democracy transition.

But I am not a man who applauds everything the government does or
blindly trusts in and supports all what the anti-government elements
do. I am just a duty-conscious person who is never hesitant to support
or condemn an act after assessing all its good and bad effects with my
own conscience.

So, I am not a follower of anyone. I accept myself a neutral standing
on my own free will and views and stance. My only wish is to see my
nation and people standing tall among the global community and
enjoying progress and prosperity. I totally hate the present national
hardships that are entirely against the interest of the nation and the
people.

Keeping in mind long-term interest of the nation and people, I would
like to frankly tell the government as well as Aunty Suu everything I
deem necessary. As I am going to present my own vision impartially, I
solemnly believe that my discussions will reflect the aspirations of
today's entire public.

Honesty is the best organizational method. I wish to assess and
present all the current political incidents of the nation sincerely.
In my view, our political situation is in a stalemate facing hardships
without moving forward with greater momentum.

It is not good if the stalemate is too long. Even at present we are
grappling with economic and social hardships due to political
deadlock. Time and again, disturbances and demonstrations are
springing from political, economic and social troubles. The
consequence is that the nation is in a bad shape and is unable to
march straightly to public-desired democracy or implement market
economy well.

We were all hopeful and happy when the government's Announcement
(1/2007) came out. The announcement has made an offer saying that
Senior General Than Shwe will meet Aunty Suu in person if she abandons
her four means to block Myanmar. It is the government's official
offer. I expected something important might happen when Mr Gambari met
Aunty Suu twice during his visit to Myanmar. But it's true that I
dared not expect to that degree. The Announcement (1/2007) is indeed
good news for the nation's future. My appreciation is that it is a
constructive new step the entire people of Myanmar will have to
welcome.

As usual, some foreign radio stations were airing all sorts of
comments from various view points concerning the announcement. News
reports viewing the announcement as a positive step were few. Mostly,
news reports were dominated by slanders on it. Before Aunty Suu had
made any comments on it, those radio stations were saying that she was
in a position to promise that she would not commit again the offence
she had never committed before; that she had been asked to surrender
before the meeting; and that they objected the offer as it was not a
genuine dialogue. I have been hearing again and again the demands to
release Aunty Suu first. When I heard those responses, I was so
disappointed and wondering whether the dialogue would actually take
place.

Despite those circumstances, the government has never given up the
national re-consolidation, officially assigning Deputy Minister for
Labour U Aung Kyi as Minister for Relations on 8 October 2007 to take
further step towards a dialogue with Aunty Suu. We have noticed that
the government has been heading for a dialogue with Aunty Suu.

Aunty Suu, I sincerely believe that it's the right time for you to
make a positive response with a view to serving the interest of all.

Actually, we, ordinary people, are just the audience watching what the
government, Aunty Suu and NLD are doing. We are tired of watching a
stalemate for a long time considering that we should not go on like
this forever. There should be some forms of compromise. If one side
makes a concession, the other side should do so. The situation will
get worse if both sides are arrogantly intransigent refusing to budge
from their stand.

Concerning the demand for the release of Aunty Suu first, I would like
to say as much as I understand. I assume that the government is not
intentionally imposing the restriction order on her. The government
may have unavoidable circumstances and reasons to do so. Concerning
the matter both sides may have many different opinions and much to
discuss. But it is not an unsolvable problem. I hope that it can be
solved one day.

If we look back the recent past, we can see that Aunty Suu became
popular on the Myanmar political stage with NLD as the springboard
after the 1988 unrest. To the extent of my knowledge, when the unrest
began in March 1988, underground elements of BCP (Burma Communist
Party) decided to accelerate the unrest and to keep Daw Khin Kyi as a
national leader in the forefront. As Daw Khin Kyi's health was
deteriorating, they planned to present her daughter Aunty Suu as
public leader.

I have learnt that BCP UGs were successful in approaching you in May
that year; and that you met with old politicians such as U Nu, Mahn
Win Maung, Bohmu Aung and U Saw Kya Doe and signed the proclamation to
form the People's Advisory Committee. At a clandestine meeting held on
21-8-1988, Aunty Suu was designated as the leader and spokeswoman of
United Alliance. Later, Aunty Suu became a public figure after giving
speeches to the strikers at the compound of Yangon General Hospital on
23-8-1988 and talks at the ground lying in the west of the Shwedagon
Pagoda on 26-8-1988. I was one of your supporters then.

Aunty Suu, you became the general secretary of NLD when the government
permitted formation of political parties. The NLD central executive
committee was formed with 42 members, 14 each from the threeparty
alliance - Aung-Suu-Tin group. On 3-12-1988, U Aung Gyi broke away
from the NLD and formed a separate party with the excuse, saying that
leftists were dominating your group. After U Aung Gyi quit NLD, it was
solely dominated by Aunty Suu and the NLD CEC was just nodding to all
what you said. NLD members were not able to differentiate between the
NLD central and you. Personality cult was common in the party then.
NLD CECs were like lay attendants of an abbot monk. They didn't dare
do anything without your knowledge. The matter is like approving what
I have known from the paper &quot;National Political Movement and
Assessment on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi'' compiled by Moe Thee Zun in which
he said NLD CECs didn't dare decide even a small matter without Daw
Aung San Suu Kyi's knowledge.

The government said that the NLD instead of launching its organization
campaigns and adopting and presenting policy guidelines within the
framework of the law and principles as a duty conscious party was
sticking to its extremist idea of opposing and confronting the
Tatmadaw. During the time, we were not able to distinguish between
right and wrong. We had to accept your declaration &quot;Defy all orders as
a duty&quot; you had made at NLD press meet held on 5-6-1989 as your
political stand.

Later, we began to see Aunty Suu attempting to grab power through
short-cut or in other words making instigation for recurrence of the
1988 unrest rather than working in accord with democracy principles
within the framework of law. You even tried to organize a mass walk
with the slogan &quot;Martyrs never die&quot; on the Martyr's Day in 1989,
plotting to stage a 1988-unrest-like civil commotion which you named
&quot;the Second Revolution&quot; if the government tried to stop it. Hence, the
government had to take preventive measures to expose and arrest BCP
UGs acting from behind the scenes. It is said that discussions were
held at the NLD office the whole night on 18-7-1989 to decide whether
such mass walk should be staged or not. In the end, the meeting agreed
to obey your order. After viewing and discussing the matter from
various angles again and again you decided to call off the plan. It is
a very important decision. Because of your correct decision, just in
time the nation managed to avoid undesirable riots, appalling losses
and unpleasant incidents. It is true that you won public respect for
that decision.

As your order to call off the plan did not arrive at the township
party offices in time, the situation went beyond limit in some
townships. In my view, your slogan &quot;Martyrs never die&quot; was so severe
that it would result in evil consequences. For the first time, the
government had to impose restriction order on Aunty Suu on 20-7-1989
as it found 40 persons including joint in-charge of support committee
of ABSDF insurgents illegally staying in your house. It imposed the
order on Aunty Suu in accord with section 10 (b) of the law to protect
the nation from the danger of those willing to destroy it. As you
understand law more than us you will know best whether the action was
in accord with the law or not.

Aunty Suu, leaders of the State met you on 20-9-1994 and 28-10-1994
while you were under restrictions. We had watched on TV the Head of
State cordially clarifying the situation and discussing with you
during the second meeting. It is indeed a joyful and pleasant scene
for all. Ordinary people like me were glad with the thought that a way
had been found for national reconsolidation. Your late husband Michael
Aris visited you and on his return to England he issued your
declaration at Bangkok Airport on 22-1-1995. Your declaration which
said that you would continue to launch anti-government campaign
destroyed all our hopes.

However, the government lifted the restriction order imposed on Aunty
Suu on 10-7-1995 although your stance was to continue your anti-
government campaign. As the NLD was participating in the National
Convention at the time, the government seemed to hope that

You do not like the idea of her being released. You said you will be
so disappointed. You know. The SPDC army generals know. Every single
Burmese know that the SPDC has been in power for more than 19 years.
More than half of this period has been wasted on dialogue, discussion,
national reconciliation that never materialized. The SPDC regime never
had no respect for political and civil rights.  There is no freedom of
speech, no freedom of belief,no freedom of movement, no freedom of any
kind in general. The Burmese People's struggle was and is always
originally for freedom.  You can not defend the SPDC on this. So, in
the dialogue between the SPDC army and Aung San Suu Kyi (National
League for Democracy 's leader), one party -- memeber of the SPDC--
has all kinds of power and the other paty -- Suu Kyi -- is left with
no advisors nor consultants.  Under such a constraint and restriction
put in place on her, there is no room left for a genuine dialogue to
take place.  It is exactly like a negotiator between police and car
driver, which can never be equal. The SPDC, with no apparent &quot;end-
game&quot; in sight, is a strong party that will simply exert its power in
the negotiation -- remind its opponent  of the rewards and/or
punishments its power can provide.  So this planning dialogue is no
different from any dialogues that occured over the past nine years.
What caused the stalemate was the fact that the SPDC were not ready to
weep on someone's shoulder. It awalys wants to look over others'
shoulders.  It heads nowhere exactly in the same way the SPDC army
heads nowhere except to the absolute power.   Unfortunately or worst
of all, the SPDC put her under house arrest for many years while the
army generals always used the big sticks/killing tactics in dealing
with any dissenting voices in public. Under the rule of the SPDC army,
there is no sympathy, no consideration, no humility, no tolerance of
dissidents in Burma. And NO Compromise...
You might hear that &quot;Power Concedes Nothing Without A Demand&quot;. From
the SPDC army, it never did and it never will. You surely know who has
the power and who do not. Your blame should belong to those who are
currenly holding the state power and also are arrogantly intransigent
refusing to budge from their stand..

&gt;&gt;&gt; And you said &quot;Aunty Suu, make a positive response to 'serving the interest of all'... &quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
">

Interestingly, the phrase &quot;serving the interest of all&quot; really stands
out in your message. This messsage should not be for Aung San Suu Kyi.
Instead, it should be forwarded directly to the names of  the &quot;SPDC
members &quot; so that response to it will be rapid and immediate. You do
not want the TRUTH in here. Right? Who is NOT serving the interest of
all and who is abusing the power vehicle in Burma politics today?
Imagine what is like a headless body walking when it happens. And also
imagine like head bouncing without thre rest of its body.. Even if
failures seen in Burma politics are evident, then you make no mistake
by shifting blame on someone who is not evidently responsible. Asking
Aung San Suu Kyi to make a positive respond is like demanding all of
the political detainees to gave a public speech. A handful of army
generals on high position, concerning the backfire, find it easier to
find scapegoats  than to admit wrondoing. In addition to that, they,
under the influence of their own repeated propaganda, are feeling more
like saviours.

You again accused Aung San Suu Kyi of  fostering a cult of personality
at the party meeting.  This is your own personal view and newly found
belief. As long as it does not hurt anyone, who bother. At the same
time, you should not fail to discuss about what the SPDC's chief Than
Shwe is, how his single-minded inhuman handling over the protests by
monks and people who peaceful demanded for political reform and
reforms. It's at a point where people of Burma have already considered
giving up any interest in regime's a mountain of lies and its
unrealistic claims because people are so helpless, and seemingly
content being exploited, ripped off, lied to, manipulated and
conrolled by the military generals with bloods on their hands as well
as their guns. You are the defenders for the regime; maybe that is how
you make your own living. It is amazing to see your mind-boggling
accusations against opposition parties and those who involved in
peaceful demonstrations. Your sins is not only attacking the public
for doing good jobs for Burma but also  blindly denying the facts.
Your message was all a load of old cobblers and another trick from
your master SPDC regime. You all, SPDC cronies/henchmen, clearly  do
not appreciate or understand what patriotism is all about. See here
how she was released/re-arrested since 1988:
-Under house arrest since July 1989 .
-Released in July 1995
-Under house arrest since September 2000
-Relased in May 2002. On 30 May 2003, NLD member, including her was
attacked by a government-sponsored mob  in the northern village of
Depayin,
-Under house arrest since September 2003.

Today she is still under house arrest while the SPDC army is still
holding the power that it kidnapped from people at gunpoint after the
1990 election. Whenever asked, Than Shwe and group say &quot;Government
took over state responsibility inevitably.&quot;
&quot;inevitably...inevitably...inevitably&quot;. Why can not give up even after
19 years? Even tattoos can be removed or  birthmarks can be removed.
These power takers (military men) can not &quot;inevitably&quot; removed; the
only thing that makes it possible is only when the undertaker comes
and takes them from their power seats.  The SPDC Than Shwer, Maung
Aye, Shwe Mann, and many more in green uniforms are truely undeniably
&quot;absolute power grabber through  short-cut&quot;.

Lincoln said: &quot;You can fool all the people some of the time, and some
of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the
time&quot;.  The subject you posted was one of the most inaccurate and
distorted article I have seen and also the same version with some
variations repeatedly posted from the SPDC's mouthpiece .

My advice to you is &quot;repaire you sin before too late, Chan Mya Aye&quot;.
Do not keep yourself with the military butchers in the SPDC's cabinet,
but they continued to promote the deadly illusion that the armed
forces were part of the &quot;peoples' democratic revolution.

If you were truly a neutral observer posting from Myanamar, you'd be
arrested, tortured,a dn possibly killed - but we know you are not.

What kind of nonsense is the sentence &quot;I assume that the government is
not intentionally imposing the restriction order on her. &quot; If it is not
the junta's INTENTION, HOW COME she has been restricted for so
long??????  It is utterly, clearly, unmistakeably true that the
governemnt has INTENTIONALLY restricted Aung San Suu Kyi. How dare you
call her 'Auntie'.

These gangsters in control have one interest in mind: their own. That is
why Gen Than Shwe was able to host such a lavish wedding for his
daughter, and how she received wedding gifts said to be worth a
staggering US$50 million (Bt1.8 billion). (The video is at
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsbZnW5h3So )

The Junta held an election and LOST. All the nonsense about
reconciliation and diagloue and progress towards democracy is bullshit.
These people will be gotten rid of only by force. That is the only
language they understand.

You are just a propagandizing toady.
