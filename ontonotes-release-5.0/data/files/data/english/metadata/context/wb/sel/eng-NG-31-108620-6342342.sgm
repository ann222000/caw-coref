Yep!  Looked smooth as silk.  Fairing separation also went smoothly.

The video feed cut out at about T+5 minutes though, at least on my

This looks bad.  There was some oscillation during second stage
operation before I lost video feed.  Reports are that telemetry was
lost.  I'd say it's a bust.

However, they got this far and no doubt learned some lessons, and
showed a surprising system robustness in being able to recycle for
launch on short order.

We'll have to wait for data analysis to determine what went wrong
with the second stage; guidance platform or hydraulic control of
the engine seem likely culprits.

That would be normal for a radiatively cooled engine like this

OK - I guess I was just expecting it to be a bit more uniform.  Is it
just the first stage engine then that is ablatively cooled?

Seems it made it into space, but does not say orbit.  Kind of sounds
like there might have been a problem.  No matter what, this is much

I'd have liked a fully successful launch, but a lot of hardware
was validated.  I agree, it's definite progress.  We'll have to wait

not.

Stills from the rocketcam indicate there was a "dirty"
staging in which the first stage contacted the second
stage engine bell.  The second stage apparently corrected
for the nudge, but may have developed control problems
a minute or so later which may not have been due to the
bump.

Good thing for the rocket cam and the clear images it
was able to convey; it will help with the failure analysis.
It looks as though the second stage engine itself was working
okay up to the moment of loss of signal.

I don't see a problem.  It's radiatively cooled, so it's going

Did not make orbit...

http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon/f2/status.html

220 GMT (10:20 p.m. EDT Tues.)

Musk promises to provide additional information later tonight about
what happened to the rocket.

0218 GMT (10:18 p.m. EDT Tues.)

"I think it is fair to charactize this as a success," Musk says.

0214 GMT (10:14 p.m. EDT Tues.)

Musk says 90 percent of the Falcon 1 rocket's technical challenges
were proven out with this launch. He doesn't foresee needing another
test flight before launching the first operational mission in late
summer carrying the U.S. military's TacSat 2 spacecraft.

0204 GMT (10:04 p.m. EDT Tues.)

Musk says "the high likelihood" is the vehicle re-entered the
atmosphere prior to making an orbit.

0156 GMT (9:56 p.m. EDT Tues.)

Musk says the rocket didn't reach the intended orbit and actually may
have re-entered the atmosphere. The rolling motion caused the second
stage engine to shut down early. Despite the problem, Musk considers
this to be "a very good day" for SpaceX.

0154 GMT (9:54 p.m. EDT Tues.)

"We did have a roll-control anomoly," Musk says of the second stage.
Some oscillations could be seen in the last bit of video from a camera
mounted on the second stage before the webcast stopped. Fate of the
rocket remains unknown.

Hot-spots like the one shown are definitely not what I would expect. At
the very least it indicates a pretty questionable injector.  Maybe it would
have been OK had it burned the entire 10 minutes and maybe it wouldn't.

I saw at least 3  anomalies:
Hot-spots in second-stage engine.

Recontact at staging - which definitely left a mark. It also appeared to
dislodge something at the flange of the bell which flew off around the time
of fairing sep. It seemed to be an issue with the first stage whipping out
of line rather than a start transient on the second stage.

Unstable slow poles in second-stage DAP. It looked to me to be a pretty
classic stability issue, as opposed to a piece-part failure. It was
diverging very slowly but definitely diverging.

It will be interesting to study the video, once it becomes available.

There's a more complete video on YouTube that clearly shows the
instability building up to a very pronounced roll and tumble
before the loss of signal.  This suggests a guidance problem,
perhaps propellant slosh.  The ring separating from the nozzle
was apparently normal; the contact with the first stage was
not, but guidance appeared to correct that issue promptly.

SpaceX needs a few days to digest the data and determine the
problem, but real progress was made on this second flight.

Yeah, it looked to me to be good old garden variety unstable vice a hard
failure. I would also guess that fuel slosh would be a leading candidate,
but it won't be all that easy to distinguish that from some sort of
transport lag issue. Although I suppose if it's a slosh issue the frequency
will go up as the fuel runs out/acceleration increases, and if it's a
transport lag the frequency will likely stay constant.

I'll have to get the longer video. It's a rare opportunity to
demonstrate a real live stability issue to our junior engineers. Sort of a
"Galloping Gertie" film for controls engineers. We had just had a
discussion, a half an hour earlier, about how there seemed to be a rather
casual attitude in the "cheap space" world towards stability and control.
Not that others hadn't already learned the same lesson, the hard way, of
course.

No doubt. But I bet, after a few more of these little problems, they
might begin to realize why there are a lot more people working these
problems in the professional side of the aerospace world.

Hopefully they have good telemetry from this portion of the flight and will

The 2nd stage was clearly "coning" near the end of the above video.  Looks
like a guidance and control problem.  I suppose it could also be a problem
with the 2nd stage engine that the guidance and control system couldn't cope
with.

Looked to me like it was some problem that G&amp;C was trying to cope with
(hence the 'coning' of the second stage gimbal) but which was either
getting worse with ascent (eventually exceeding the control authority
of the engine gimbals) or else Guide was 'behind' the problem, leading
to a slow regenerative feedback, at which point the booster starts to
spin because the guidance can't keep up anymore.

If it's the latter sort of timing problem, it really should have been
spotted in simulation.  Therefore, I want to say it's the former - a
gradually building aerodynamic instability the magnitude of which
eventually exceeded the control authority of guidance and the motor
gimbals to correct, leading to uncontrolled roll of the vehicle.

Of course, we're all just guessing based on one optical video...

True.  Hopefully they've got some good 2nd stage telemetry which will point
them to the root cause.  But this wouldn't be the first time that the
simulations all looked o.k. but something unforeseen turned up in the flight
test.  It's the unknowns that get you.

Yep.  This is why I lean toward it being an actual aerodynamic
instability that is increasing during the flight rather than a pure
G&amp;C 'lag' issue.  The latter sort of problem DOES tend to show up
during simulation, while finding the former relies on the fidelity of
the aero model and flow fields that you have for your vehicle (which
you have to fly to get and prove out).

What insurance?  It's a government payload, and they'll make the
call on whether they want to fly on the third attempt or wait for another
validation flight.

Lots of things were happening on this flight and we need to wait for a
full analysis of what actually happened, and what the necessary fixes
will be.  I'm happy that it got as far as it did, exercising all of the
hardware and flight modes.  That's how problems get found; the launch
business is not for the timid.

If you only have a single engine, yes. The SIVB separation on both
Saturn 1b and Saturn V left the interstage behind.

The SII stage took the interstage along in case of serious thrust
fluctuation between different engines on startup or a total engine
failure, which could cause the engine bells to hit the interstage if
it was left attached to the SIc stage instead. With one engine it
either starts and runs or it doesn't.

The problem got worse later in flight when the rocket was essentially
out of the atmosphere. No 'aerodynamic' there. Could have been
sloshing of the propellant or some other part of the hardware behaved
differently then in the simulator. Still, G&amp;C should have been more
robust - it was obvious long before the end that something is wrong

No aerodynamics involved, it's far too high. After watching it several
times, I would have to guess that it's a fuel swirl/slosh issue.

It was clearly stable at separation and not later. This is not all that
unexpected. The stability margins typically go down as the fuel runs out,
because the inertia goes down, and the gimbal torque/angle ratio goes up
(since the CG moves forward as the stage gets lighter). Both of these raise
the effective system gain, and anything like this will certainly go unstable
if the gain goes up sufficiently. Of course you design it for adequate
margin at the worst-case condition, but if you miss something, like the fuel
slosh "swirl" mode that couples the axes together, you may go unstable. I
would guess that's what happened here.

I would disagree that this couldn't or even wouldn't likely have been
found in analysis. It's a well-understood problem and while it's non-trivial
to come up with a good linear stability model, it's certainly well within
the state of the art. What I suspect, and once again, not to cast any
aspersions on anyone, is that all they did was a bunch of time-domain
simulations. This is very common these days, and very appealing to newbies
since you have enough computing power available to do thousands and
thousands of them in a Monte Carlo procedure. But that's also how you get
caught on stuff like this, as many people have found (the hard way) before.
That's why they call them "start-ups", not an unexpected situation. I have
access to some great reports from the late 50's/early 60's about stuff like
this, let's say they aren't the first people to run into problems like this!
All "not for public discussion" of course.

It's also not all that trivial to solve. It's not insoluble but from
experience it's not as easy as Mr. Musk seems to want to imply. I wouldn't
be surprised if they end up needing more tank baffles. Just dropping the
gain might be possible, but if you didn't see the problem the first time,
you won't know how much to drop it. The first step needs to be to modify the
analysis so it accurately predicts the problem.

I have no idea why they are referring to it as a roll control anomaly. It
was quite obviously going unstable in pitch/yaw long before roll gave up the
ghost.

This is odd, and a little disturbing.  Also the reference to "clean
staging", when most everyone watching the webcast could see the
interstage hit the Kestrel nozzle and put a pretty big rate on the
second stage.

Surely even if they weren't watching the video, they'd see the pitch/

I'll have to go check, but it think the recontact actually reduced the
rate, which was slewing off very quickly right from separation. It was a
VERY hard hit. If I we knew the exit plane diameter we could estimate it,
but to my eye it looked to bend the nozzle out-of-round something on the
order of an inch or so. It appeared to spring back most of the way, but in
any case, very bad. I would have to assume that something hung up in the
separation system, but finding it and correcting it may be a challenge.

Not a chance!  I can't see why it would in any way fall under ITAR to
discuss failures. I would say marketing/spin doctoring. Read their website
about how much economy and reliability they are gaining with their
revolutionary features - like holding the rocket on the pad until the system
reports back that it is running correctly. That wasn't revolutionary in
1944, much less 2006. It borders on arrogance, but that's hardly a new
feature in rocket science. Usually, after a few decades, that gets beaten
out of you. It's a very humbling business.

Huh?

ITAR in its present form was *motivated* by discussion of failures.  The
1995 and 1996 Long March failures, to be precise.  As both launchers were
carrying US satellites, Hughes and Loral participated in the subsequent
investigation, and co-authored the "Why Chinese Rockets Blow Up and How
To Make It Not Happen Again" report.  Copies of which went to the Chinese,
with full Commerce Department approval.

Since the Commerce Department is an executive branch agency, which in
1995-6 was run by the Clinton Administration, and since Congress in that
era was suffering a severe case of Clinton Derangement Syndrome, this was
construed as, "Traitorous Clinton Administration Conspires to Help the
Commie Red Chinese Build Better Nookyuler Missiles With Which to Murder
God-Fearing Americans", which brouhaha ended with A: ITAR in its current
form, with satellite and launcher technology on the Munitions List and the
State Department in charge, and B: tens of millions of dollars in fines to
Hughes and Loral for, essentially, having talked about why rockets blew up
in a forum where Evil Furriners were listening.

I don't think ITAR has much to do with what Musk has or has not been
saying recently, but the suggestion isn't absurd and I can certainly
see how discussing failures in public might fall under ITAR.

I understand all that - but as far as I can tell this doesn't apply at

Just watched the video, missed the launch because I turned of the feed after
the first engine start. Nice turn key and go vehicle they have.

Lack of Helium seems to be what finished it off. No roll control, tank
pressurization went down, and no settling burn.

Your right it's obviously pitch/yaw, maybe a slosh problem. As the tank
empties and the vehicle accelerated the the pitch/yaw gimbal began to move,
ever so slightly. Like the control system was coming up on a resonate
frequency with a slosh mode. It really looked like the vehicles attitude
was solid, when the engine began pitching and yawing slightly. Fighting and
exciting the liquid in the tank.

The Space Shuttle worries about slosh, especially during RTLS with the pitch
over maneuver just prior to MECO. Large pitch maneuver, too much LOX in the
tank and it will recontact after separation.

SpaceX really should have thought about using auto-gains in their flight
control system (attitude control). Too much gimbal movement, adjust the
gains. Too much attitude error, adjust the gains the other way.

Except the Commerce Department aren't the guys who have to clear stuff
for ITAR and never have been.  Commerce controlled 'dual-use' stuff,
which I believe at the time included comsats but DID NOT include their
launchers.

Note that the reason this stuff was transferred BACK to State (also an
executive branch agency, in case you missed it) is that Commerce fell
down on doing what they were supposed to do to clear its release under
the Clinton directive that transferred control of comsat (not missile)
technology (very briefly) to Commerce in 1996.  Before 1996 all this
stuff was on the Munitions List.  Two years later it was back on the
Munitions List.

"Unhappy with this outcome, Commerce appealed to the National Security
Council and President Clinton. In March 1996, after many interagency
meetings, President Clinton ordered that comsats be transferred to
Commerce. To accommodate State’s concerns, he issued an executive
order in December 1995 that required Commerce to refer all export
licenses to the Departments of State, Defense, Energy, and the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency. A majority vote of these five agencies
would decide licensing conditions. By October of 1996, all
jurisdiction over comsats was transferred to Commerce."

.
.
.

"This analysis created a major controversy, as it was unclear whether
Commerce had the authority to approve such an export. A congressional
review determined that these launch failure reviews were conducted
without required Department of State export licenses, and communicated
technical information to the PRC in violation of ITAR."

The sort of distortion of events that you put forward is typically
what happens when someone's ideology drives them to say what they
think is 'right', whether it's true or not.

&gt; :1995 and 1996 Long March failures, to be precise.  As both launchers were
&gt; :carrying US satellites, Hughes and Loral participated in the subsequent
&gt; :investigation, and co-authored the &quot;Why Chinese Rockets Blow Up and How
&gt; :To Make It Not Happen Again&quot; report.  Copies of which went to the
&gt; :Chinese, with full Commerce Department approval.

&gt; Except the Commerce Department aren't the guys who have to clear stuff
&gt; for ITAR and never have been.  Commerce controlled 'dual-use' stuff,
&gt; which I believe at the time included comsats but DID NOT include their
&gt; launchers.

&gt; :Since the Commerce Department is an executive branch agency, which in
&gt; :1995-6 was run by the Clinton Administration, and since Congress in that
&gt; :era was suffering a severe case of Clinton Derangement Syndrome, this was
&gt; :construed as, &quot;Traitorous Clinton Administration Conspires to Help the
&gt; :Commie Red Chinese Build Better Nookyuler Missiles With Which to Murder
&gt; :God-Fearing Americans&quot;, which brouhaha ended with A: ITAR in its current
&gt; :form, with satellite and launcher technology on the Munitions List and
&gt; :the State Department in charge, and B: tens of millions of dollars in
&gt; :fines to Hughes and Loral for, essentially, having talked about why
&gt; :rockets blew up in a forum where Evil Furriners were listening.

&gt; Note that the reason this stuff was transferred BACK to State (also an
&gt; executive branch agency, in case you missed it) is that Commerce fell
&gt; down on doing what they were supposed to do to clear its release under
&gt; the Clinton directive that transferred control of comsat (not missile)
&gt; technology (very briefly) to Commerce in 1996.  Before 1996 all this
&gt; stuff was on the Munitions List.  Two years later it was back on the
&gt; Munitions List.

&gt; &quot;Unhappy with this outcome, Commerce appealed to the National Security
&gt; Council and President Clinton. In March 1996, after many interagency
&gt; meetings, President Clinton ordered that comsats be transferred to
&gt; Commerce. To accommodate State’s concerns, he issued an executive
&gt; order in December 1995 that required Commerce to refer all export
&gt; licenses to the Departments of State, Defense, Energy, and the Arms
&gt; Control and Disarmament Agency. A majority vote of these five agencies
&gt; would decide licensing conditions. By October of 1996, all
&gt; jurisdiction over comsats was transferred to Commerce.&quot;

&gt;                              .
&gt;                              .
&gt;                              .

&gt; &quot;This analysis created a major controversy, as it was unclear whether
&gt; Commerce had the authority to approve such an export. A congressional
&gt; review determined that these launch failure reviews were conducted
&gt; without required Department of State export licenses, and communicated
&gt; technical information to the PRC in violation of ITAR.&quot;

&gt; The sort of distortion of events that you put forward is typically
&gt; what happens when someone's ideology drives them to say what they
&gt; think is 'right', whether it's true or not.
">

It goes even further than you make out. In the early 1992-1995 time frame,
NASA and a bunch of other agencies were directed to make available a bunch
of Public Domain software tools through Cosmos. A repository that was to
charge a distribution fee to give anyone wanting a copy, a copy of the
tools. SORT, which is a 3-DOF trajectory optimization program being one of
these. SORT is a much better Program than the much older one called POST.

I worked with the group that developed SORT, used SORT extensively, a
modified (quasi 6-DOF) version of the trajectory part of SORT was actually
used in the Day of Launch I-load Update processor called DIBS which update
the first stage trajectory for the Day of Launch winds, DOLILU-1. Another
version of SORT along with DIBS went into DOLILU-2 which fixed a bunch of
other issues with day of launch I-load update.

In the late 1990s-2000s, I decide it was time to start working a bit on my
own stuff and wanted a "legitimate" copy of SORT, the public domain
version, and was ready to spend the 500-600 dollar distribution fee to get
my very own "legitimate" copy on 9-track tape. Cool.

I spent 3 years trying to get a copy of the "Public Domain" software.
Multiple request, many telephone calls, ... The Cosmic repository had been
transfered to a University in Georgia, when they got copies all the
software, guess what. Many of the tapes had been corrupted, like someone
had take a big magnet and selectively waived it around in the repository.
More phone calls, emails, to the point begging and tears, NASA finally
agreed to give me a copy with a condition that essentially would let them
at any future time rip the tool from my hands again. NASA has no qualms
about ripping the "Public Domain" tools out of the hands of those who
develop and use them.

I was felt so humiliated, discussed and depressed at that point, I just
dropped it. In retrospect, it would have been much easier to just find
someone who got a copy of SORT when it first hit the repository. Like from
the Australians who have a copy, or probably the Russian or Chinese. I'm
sure they probably got there copies early. But a US citizen, forget it.

I think "have no meaningful effect on engine performance" is a bit
optimistic. If the nozzle was dented by the contact with the separating
first stage it may still have essentially the same overall thrust but it
could well be assymmetric enough to screw with the control systems.

Possibly. Did you notice the ring around the lip of the end of the Nozzle
fell off after the the engine heated up.

Sure looked like what one would expect from a resonate frequency between the
control system and slosh. It came on very slowly, a little pitch then a
little yaw, pitch, yaw, .. and then increased and round and round the
engine went, larger and larger circles. Round and round the fluid went,
larger and larger circle. Stop moving the engine. Maybe, it did get bent,
asymmetrical thrust changing control frequencies and cross-coupling. But,
it sure recovered fast (very tight) from the separation attitude transient,
one quick movement of the nozzle and back on attitude.

I still think it's slosh. Either way, auto-gains in there flight control
would have fixed it.

I suppose as a US citizen it never occurred to you to write your own
software. Oh, the horror. Better to let India write software for you.

I've read this was expected and as designed. This glued-on ring
stabilizes the nozzle during launch and as soon as the nozzle heats up
it drops off. The nozzle-walls are quite thin and while the nozzle is
stable with the engine burning (and pressurizing it from the inside) it
may be delicate enough to need support as long as the engine is not
running.

Unless I missed it being discussed in this thread, did SpaceX recover
the first stage? Reusing the first stage - or perhaps parts from it -
was part of their original plan to cut costs. For this flight, it would
presumably be useful to inspect the engine and pumps for any unexpected
damage.

It is not clear to me that a simple auto-gain would necessarily work
in this case.  Some systems work below resonance, and rely on the
resonance averaging out (when you balance a meter stick on your
finger, you don't need to worry about bending modes).  Some work above
resonance, and depend on control forces being able to compensate for
the resonance effects (Balancing the rocket at launch is in this
mode).   But some systems, especially where the system changes during
operation, need to operate through resonances.  The basic idea here is
to get through resonance quickly enough that the vibrations cannot
build to a destructive value before you reach the other side and
regain control.  Drive shafts for big ships, and spin-polarized
synchrotrons, both use this idea.

It would not surprise me if a rocket needs to work in this regime.  As
the rocket empties, the performance of the engine gimbals remains the
same, while the resonant frequencies (and the Qs) will vary
considerably as the tanks empty.  Here a simple auto gain will not
work (as I understand it) - as the resonance approaches, it will just
keep lowering the gain to keep the system stable, possibly resulting
in in-adequate control.  It would not realize that it can increase the
gain, allow the system to go temporarily unstable, then regain control
on the other side of the resonance.  Programmable gains vs time can
deal with things like this, but can screw up if your model is wrong.
(IIRC, this is what happened to Delta-III -there was an un-predicted
resonance in their control band, they ate up all their fluid trying to
control it, then lost all control when fluid ran out).

Given modern computer power, and distributed small accelerometers, you
could imagine a smart auto-gain that cross-correlated the engine
position and all the accelerations, measuring and modeling in real
time all the resonances and their Qs and their rates of change, and
then adopting an optimum control strategy.  This could deal with
unanticipated effects and physical damage.  But I suspect this would
be really hard to qualify, since you'd have lots of very complex
software in the control loop, worries about convergence of the
algorithms, prove the computed control strategy converges in time, and
is stable, and so on.

So my guess would be they used fixed gains vs time (or tank level, or
something else simple).  There was something wrong with their model  -
perhaps the engine was dinged, Qs are different in vacuum, the modeler
thought some effect was negligible but it is not, some effect was
stronger than anticipated (this got the Ariane 5 upgrade - their main
engine generated more torque around the long axis than anticipated),
and so on.  Then the system became unstable and boom....

I think the Delta III was even more subtle - it ran out of hydraulic
fluid for the SRMs and so stopped trying to fight the roll
disturbances, at which point they damped out and the thing flew fine.
But then it didn't have enough authority to deal with a high-altitude
wind shear that it encountered.  So close...
