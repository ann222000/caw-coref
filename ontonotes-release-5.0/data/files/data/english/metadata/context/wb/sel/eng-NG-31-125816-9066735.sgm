Item 260158425856

I've decided to wage a campaign against the irritating people that try
and get you to pull auctions for their benefit.

This one might run and run....

Anyone reckon I can get his Ebay account pulled?

Well you can get him a warning for abusive email at least.

I agree with you. I never close early but every now and again someone won't
take no for an answer or just comes back with a message full of abuse
because you won't sell to them on the cheap. I always report the latter. As
you say people like that wreck Ebay for everyone willing to stick to the
rules.

When I come across something I really want I also message the sellers asking
if they are likely to end early for someone else as I am interested but am
fed up with being gazumped by the &quot;how much for a quick sale&quot; brigade.

I am quite prepared to make a silly offer if someone's auction has
closed with no bids. But these pricks are starting to get on my tits.

And I still want to get a death threat from an Ebay auction.....

It's idiosyncratic - not incorrect,  Who is to say *what*  is correct, or

'Obstruse' (or, 'abstruce', if you prefer)  is the word that springs most

&gt; I can only say that you seem to attract them like flies round shit, and
&gt; the one mans protest about Iraq and Americans, is it really necessary?  I
&gt; think it is totally out place and I'm surprised that ebay permitted
&gt; it, even if I might find myself agreeing with you in part on that subject,
&gt; it is still out of place there.

&gt; You seem to relish strife and grief, why didn't you simply state UK
&gt; bidders only and set a BIN price £50 quid or whatever minimum you are
&gt; prepared to accept, which would have precluded anyone asking that same
&gt; question and would probably have got the damned thing out from under your
&gt; feet as quickly as possible with the least hassle.  If someone needs or
&gt; wants the thing and the price is reasonable it'll go, not everyone has the
&gt; patience to endure the unpredictability of an auction.
">

It's a bit odd that a bloke who whines if anyone proclaims they've
plonked someone should plaster their eBay battles over ukrm.

One might think it was a form of attention-seeking, if it wasn't for the
unimpeachable source.

Try not to get in too deeply, Tony.   One of *the* essential criteria for
Usenet success is the ability to refrain from pointing out typing errors.
To do so, you see, makes you look like a Lamer.

It is a generally held view (and an entirely valid one, in my opinion) that
those who *do* seize with glee upon inadvertent errors do so because they
have minuscule genitalia and an entirely unsatisfactory life.

They could well be  nazi's and rapists, into the bargain.

So stop it, there's a good lad.

Nice try, but everyone can see that these were not just &quot;typing errors&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Item 260158425856

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've decided to wage a campaign against the irritating people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that try
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and get you to pull auctions for their benefit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This one might run and run....

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone reckon I can get his Ebay account pulled?&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ------

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My word -  a scrap dealer with attitude! - whatever next? ,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lol!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My word, an illiterate poster. Whatever...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ...Ah. Yes. Like that's uncommon.&lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wow!,  an educated scrap dealer - now, there's a novelty.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps, in view of your superior command of English,  you'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; care to point out the illiteracy (allegedly) contained  in my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; previous post?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll bite. Commas after quesion marks are a no-no. That's not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going to get you very far is it?&lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's idiosyncratic - not incorrect,  Who is to say *what*  is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correct, or incorrect, for that matter? - a few more months of mass
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; immigration and we'll all be speaking in an amusing patois, anyway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I used to care - but, now, I just worry about the important things
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in life, like uppity scrap dealers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps you'd like to order pizza for us because your Jihad is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nearing completion. &lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Obstruse' (or, 'abstruce', if you prefer)  is the word that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; springs most readily to mind when studying that enigmatic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence.  You'll have to simplify it for me, I'm afraid - I'm a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plain man and I speak plainly, it's no use bamboozling me with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your esoteric scrap-dealer talk!

&gt;&gt;&gt; A pretty good rule when trying to gain the upper hand in a usenet
&gt;&gt;&gt; exchange
&gt;&gt;&gt; of opinions is &quot;don't use words that you can't spell correctly&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The post
&gt;&gt;&gt; that you were referring to may be abstruse but you are obtuse.&lt;

&gt;&gt; Try not to get in too deeply, Tony.   One of *the* essential
&gt;&gt; criteria for Usenet success is the ability to refrain from pointing
&gt;&gt; out typing errors. To do so, you see, makes you look like a Lamer.

&gt;&gt; It is a generally held view (and an entirely valid one, in my
&gt;&gt; opinion) that those who *do* seize with glee upon inadvertent errors
&gt;&gt; do so because they have minuscule genitalia and an entirely
&gt;&gt; unsatisfactory life.

&gt;&gt; They could well be  nazi's and rapists, into the bargain.

&gt;&gt; So stop it, there's a good lad. &lt;&lt;

&gt; You'll notice that I chucked in an aberrant apostrophe there - just
&gt; to be kind.

Brilliant! Now he's talking to himself.

&gt; made such an obvious tit out of yourself.
">

Without wanting to appear unduly unkind,  it's extremely difficult not to
feel superior to a semi-educated gippo, such as yourself.

I am, however, doing my best.

If you can tear your eyes away from the pursuit of your latest ebay bargain
(something old and ferrous, no doubt?) you will notice the close proximity
of the 'S' and 'C' keys on your keyboard.

You will also (if you take the trouble to read the post that appears to have
offended your grammatical sensibilities) notice that 'obstruse' was
correctly spelled - which would make it rather unlikely that I would
misspell its peer, given that only the first vowel is different.

So, to sum up - case dismissed, you unwashed ebay tinker.

That's certainly relevant to some of the participants here - particularly so

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Item 260158425856

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've decided to wage a campaign against the irritating people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that try
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and get you to pull auctions for their benefit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This one might run and run....

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone reckon I can get his Ebay account pulled?&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ------

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My word -  a scrap dealer with attitude! - whatever next? ,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lol!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My word, an illiterate poster. Whatever...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ...Ah. Yes. Like that's uncommon.&lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wow!,  an educated scrap dealer - now, there's a novelty.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps, in view of your superior command of English,  you'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; care to point out the illiteracy (allegedly) contained  in my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; previous post?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll bite. Commas after quesion marks are a no-no. That's not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going to get you very far is it?&lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's idiosyncratic - not incorrect,  Who is to say *what*  is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correct, or incorrect, for that matter? - a few more months of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mass immigration and we'll all be speaking in an amusing patois,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anyway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I used to care - but, now, I just worry about the important things
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in life, like uppity scrap dealers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps you'd like to order pizza for us because your Jihad is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nearing completion. &lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Obstruse' (or, 'abstruce', if you prefer)  is the word that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; springs most readily to mind when studying that enigmatic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence.  You'll have to simplify it for me, I'm afraid - I'm a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plain man and I speak plainly, it's no use bamboozling me with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your esoteric scrap-dealer talk!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A pretty good rule when trying to gain the upper hand in a usenet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exchange of opinions is &quot;don't use words that you can't spell
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correctly&quot;.  The post that you were referring to may be abstruse
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but you are obtuse.&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Try not to get in too deeply, Tony.   One of *the* essential
&gt;&gt;&gt; criteria for Usenet success is the ability to refrain from pointing
&gt;&gt;&gt; out typing errors.

&gt;&gt; Nice try, but everyone can see that these were not just &quot;typing
&gt;&gt; errors&quot;. The &quot;superior&quot; approach doesn't work too well for you when
&gt;&gt; you have just made such an obvious tit out of yourself.

&gt; Without wanting to appear unduly unkind,  it's extremely difficult
&gt; not to feel superior to a semi-educated gippo, such as yourself.

&gt; I am, however, doing my best.

&gt; If you can tear your eyes away from the pursuit of your latest ebay
&gt; bargain (something old and ferrous, no doubt?) you will notice the
&gt; close proximity of the 'S' and 'C' keys on your keyboard.
">

BWAHAHAHA!  That was pathetic.  They aren't close enough for that excuse to
work.  Keep it up please.  This is very entertaining.  Now tell us about
&quot;obstruse&quot;.

Oy Vey!!! - can't you get *anything* right?! - it's
'bwwwwwwwwwwwwhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaa!!!'

The effect you *should* be aiming for is the maniacal whoop of a victorious
savage, who has just torn out the still beating heart of his prostrate
enemy, and is proceeding to eat it! - *not* (as in your case) a quite
passable impression of a chain-smoking old git clearing his throat prior to
depositing another gobful of phlegm on the pavement!

Perhaps you should consider bidding for my  'Ten Easy Steps To Usenet
Victory' course?  (item  694725702736)

Unlike the older gent, I am not averse to a BIN offer - so, mail me.........

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and get you to pull auctions for their benefit.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I can only say that you seem to attract them like flies round shit, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; the one mans protest about Iraq and Americans, is it really necessary?
&gt;&gt; &gt; I
&gt;&gt; &gt; think it is totally out place and I'm surprised that ebay permitted
&gt;&gt; &gt; it, even if I might find myself agreeing with you in part on that
&gt;&gt; &gt; subject,
&gt;&gt; &gt; it is still out of place there.

&gt;&gt; &gt; You seem to relish strife and grief, why didn't you simply state UK
&gt;&gt; &gt; bidders only and set a BIN price £50 quid or whatever minimum you are
&gt;&gt; &gt; prepared to accept, which would have precluded anyone asking that same
&gt;&gt; &gt; question and would probably have got the damned thing out from under
&gt;&gt; &gt; your
&gt;&gt; &gt; feet as quickly as possible with the least hassle.  If someone needs or
&gt;&gt; &gt; wants the thing and the price is reasonable it'll go, not everyone has
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; patience to endure the unpredictability of an auction.

&gt;&gt; It's a bit odd that a bloke who whines if anyone proclaims they've
&gt;&gt; plonked someone should plaster their eBay battles over ukrm.

&gt;&gt; One might think it was a form of attention-seeking, if it wasn't for the
&gt;&gt; unimpeachable source.

&gt; &quot;Oh, the irony.&quot;&lt;&lt;
