Terminology used in this Book
(Taken from Sheik Mahmoud Murad's book 'Common mistakes in
Translation')
1. Rubb: Some prefer to translate the term 'Rubb' into 'Lord.' Beside
the fact that the latter is a Biblical term referring to the alleged
lordship of the slave of Allah, Prophet Jesus, the word ‘lord’ which
is limited to ‘master', 'chief', ‘proprietor’, or 'ruler', can never
convey the conclusive signification of the term 'Rubb'. Among other
signification, the term 'Rubb' means, the Creator, the Fashioner, the
Provider, the One upon Whom all creatures depend for their means of
subsistence, and the One Who gives life and causes death.

2. Deen: The word translated as religion is 'Deen', which in Arabic
commonly refers to a way of life, which is both private and public. It
is an inclusive term meaning: acts of worship, political practice, and
a detailed code of conduct, including hygiene or etiquette matters.

3. Sal'lal'laahu a'laihi wa sal'lam. Some translate it as 'peace be
upon him'. This translation is incorrect; the correct translation is,
'may Allah exalt his mention, and render him and his household safe
and secure from every derogatory thing'.

All praise is due to Allah, the Rubb of the worlds, and may Allah
exalt the mention of His Prophet, and render him and his household
safe and secure from all derogatory things.
When talking about Prophet Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, one
should keep in mind that he is talking about the greatest individual
in history. This is not a baseless claim; for the one who reads his
biography, and learns of his mannerisms and ethics, while keeping
aside all preconceived notions would certainly reach this conclusion.
Some fair and just non-Muslims have reached this conclusion as well.
Professor Hasan Ali, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his magazine
'Noor al-Islam' that a Brahmin colleague of his once told him: 'I
recognize and believe that the Messenger of Islam is the greatest and
most mature man in history.' Professor Hasan Ali, may Allah have mercy
on him, asked him: 'Why do you consider him as the greatest and most
mature man?' He answered: 'No man possessed the characteristics,
mannerisms and ethics that he possessed at one time. He was a king
under whom the entire peninsula was unified; yet he was humble. He
believed that the dominion belonged to his God alone. Great riches
would come to him, and yet he lived in a state of poverty; fire would
not be lit in his house for many days and he would stay hungry. He was
a great leader; he led small numbers into battle against thousands,
and yet he would decisively defeat them. He loved peace agreements,
and would agree to them with a firm heart; even though he had
thousands of his brave and courageous Companions by his side. Each
Companion was very brave and could confront a thousand enemies alone,
while not feeling the least bit intimidated. Yet, the Prophet was kind-
hearted, merciful, and did not want to shed a drop of blood. He was
deeply concerned about the affairs of the Arabian Peninsula, yet he
did not neglect the affairs of his family, household, or the poor and
needy. He was keen to disseminate Islam amongst those who had gone
astray. In general, he was a man concerned with the betterment and
wellbeing of mankind, yet he did not indulge in amassing worldly
fortune. He busied himself with the worship of Allah and loved doings
deeds which pleased Allah. He never avenged himself on account of
personal reasons. He even prayed for his enemies' wellbeing, and would
warn them of the punishment of Allah.
He was an ascetic regarding worldly affairs and would worship Allah
throughout the night. He was the brave and courageous soldier who
fought with the sword - and the infallible Prophet - the conqueror who
conquered nations and countries. He slept on a mat of hay, and a
pillow filled with course fibers. People crowned him as the Sultan
over Arabs, or King of the Arabian Peninsula, yet his family lived a
simple life, even after they received great fortunes; the riches were
piled in the Masjid. Fatima complained to him about the strenuous work
she did, the grinding stone and water jug which she used to carry -
how they had left marks on her body. The Messenger at that time was
dividing the female and male slaves amongst the Muslims. He did not
give her a portion of that wealth; instead, the Prophet taught her a
few words and supplications. His Companion, Umar came to his house and
looked in his room, and saw nothing but a hay mat which the Prophet
was sitting on, which had left marks on his body. The only provisions
in the house were half a Saa' (measure of weight) of barley in a
container, and a water skin that hung on the wall - this is all the
Messenger of Allah owned at a time half the Arabs were under his
control. When Umar saw this, he could not control himself and wept.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, said: 'Why are
you weeping O Umar?' He replied: 'Why shouldn't I weep - Khosrau and
Caesar enjoy themselves in this world and the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah exalt his mention, only owns what I see!' He responded: 'O Umar,
wouldn't it please you that this is the share of Khosrau and Caesar in
this life, and in the Hereafter this pleasure would be for us alone?'
When the Prophet examined his troops prior to the occupation of
Makkah, Abu Sufyan stood beside al-Ab'bas, the uncle of the Prophet,
may Allah exalt his mention, and they looked at the banners of the
Muslim army. Abu Sufyan at that time was not a Muslim. He was amazed
by the vast number of Muslims; they advanced towards Makkah like a
torrent of water. No one could stop them and nothing stood in their
way. Abu Sufyan then said to al-Ab'bas: 'O Ab'bas, your nephew has
become a grand King!' Ab'bas responded saying: 'This is not kingship,
rather prophethood, and the Message of Islam.'
Ad'ee at-Ta'ee, the son of Ha'tim at-Ta'ee who is the paradigm of
generosity, attended the assembly of the Prophet, may Allah exalt his
mention, while he was still a Christian. When he saw how the
Companions aggrandized and respected the Prophet, he was confused -
was he a Prophet or a king? He asked himself, 'is this a king or a
Messenger of the Messengers of Allah?' While he was pondering over
this, a destitute woman came to the Prophet, and said: 'I wish to tell
you a secret.' He said to her: 'which road in Madinah do you want me
to meet you in?' The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, left with
the destitute maid, and took care of her needs. When Ad'ee saw the
humbleness of the Prophet, he realized the truth and discarded the
crosses that he was wearing and became a Muslim.'
We will mention some statements of the Orientalists concerning
Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention. We as Muslims believe in the
Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, and his Message. We are
mentioning these statements for the following two reasons:
a. To serve as a reminder and admonition for name-sake Muslims who
abandoned their Prophet, so that they would heed and return to their
Deen.
b. So that non-Muslims would know who the Prophet is from the
statements of their own people, so that they would be guided to
Islam.
I ask these people to not hold any preconceived notions when searching
for the truth, when reading this or any other Islamic material. I ask
Allah to open their hearts and chests to accept the truth, and to show
them the right path and inspire them to follow it.

Who is the Messenger, Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention?
His Lineage:
He is Abul-Qasim (father of Al-Qasim) Muhammad, son of Abdullah, son
of Abdul-Mutalib. His lineage traces back to the tribe of Adnan, son
of Ismael [the Prophet of Allah, the son of Ibraheem, the one whom
Allah chose for His love] may Allah exalt their mention. His mother is
Aminah, daughter of Wahb.
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, said:
'Indeed Allah chose the tribe of Kinanah over other tribes from the
children of Ismail; He chose the Quraish over other tribes of Kinanah;
He chose Banu Hashim over the other families of the Quraish; and He
chose me from Banu Hashim.'  (Muslim #2276)
Thus, the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, has the noblest
lineage on earth. His enemies attested to this fact; Abu Sufyan, who
was the arch enemy of Islam before he became Muslim, attested to this
fact in front of Heraclius, the Ruler of Rome.
Abdullah b. Ab'bas, with whom Allah is pleased, reported that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, wrote to Caesar and
invited him to Islam and sent him a letter with Dihya Al-Kalbi, who
handed it to the Governor of Busra who then forwarded it to Caesar.
Caesar as a sign of gratitude to Allah, had walked from Hims to Ilya
(i.e. Jerusalem) when Allah had granted Him victory over the Persian
forces. So, when the letter of the Messenger of Allah reached Caesar,
he said after reading it, "Seek for me anyone of his people, (Arabs of
Quraish tribe) if present here, in order to ask him about the
Messenger of Allah!" At that time Abu Sufyan bin Harb was in Sham with
some men from Quraish who had come (to Sham) as merchants during the
truce that had been concluded between the Messenger of Allah; and the
infidels of Quraish. Abu Sufyan said, ‘Caesar's messenger found us
somewhere in Sham so he took me and my companions to Ilya and we were
admitted into Caesar's presence to find him sitting in his royal court
wearing a crown and surrounded by the senior Byzantine dignitaries. He
said to his translator. "Ask them whom amongst them is a close
relation to the man who claims to be a prophet."’
Abu Sufyan added, ’I replied: "I am the nearest relative to him." He
asked, "What degree of relationship do you have with him?" I replied,
"He is my cousin," and there was none of Bani Abd Manaf in the caravan
except myself. Caesar said, "Let him come nearer." He then ordered
that my companions stand behind me near my shoulder and said to his
translator, "Tell his companions that I am going to ask this man about
the man who claims to be a prophet. If he tells a lie, they should
contradict him immediately."’
Abu Sufyan added, ’By Allah! Had it not been for shame that my
companions brand me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about
him when he asked me. But I considered it shameful to be called a liar
by my companions, so I told the truth.’
‘He then said to his translator, "Ask him what kind of family he
belongs to." I replied, "He belongs to a noble family amongst us." He
said, "Has anybody else amongst you ever claimed the same before him?"
I replied, "No." He said, "Have you ever blamed him for telling lies
before he claimed what he claimed?" I replied, "No." He said, "Was
anybody amongst his ancestors a king?" I replied, "No." He said, "Do
the noble or the poor follow him?" I replied, 'It is the poor who
follow him." He said, "Are they increasing or decreasing (daily)?" I
replied, "They are increasing." He said, "Does anybody amongst those
who embrace his Deen become displeased and then discard his Deen?" I
replied, "No." He said, 'Does he break his promises?" I replied, "No,
but we are now at truce with him and we are afraid that he may betray
us."
Abu Sufyan added, ’Other than the last sentence, I could not say
anything against him.’
‘Caesar then asked, "Have you ever had a war with him?" I replied,
"Yes." He said, "What was the outcome of your battles with him?" I
replied, "Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we." He said,
"What does he order you to do?" I said, "He tells us to worship Allah
alone, and not to worship others along with Him, and to leave all that
our fore-fathers used to worship. He orders us to pray, give in
charity, be chaste, keep promises and return what is entrusted to us.
"'
‘When I had said that, Caesar said to his translator, "Say to him: I
asked you about his lineage and your reply was that he belonged to a
noble family. In fact, all the Messengers came from the noblest
lineage of their nations. Then I questioned you whether anybody else
amongst you had claimed such a thing, and your reply was in the
negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have
thought that this man was following a claim that had been said before
him. When I asked you whether he was ever blamed for telling lies,
your reply was in the negative, so I took it for granted that a person
who did not tell a lie to people could never tell a lie about Allah.
Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king. Your reply
was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would
have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.
When I asked you whether the rich or the poor people followed him, you
replied that it was the poor who followed him. In fact, such are the
followers of the Messengers. Then I asked you whether his followers
were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing.
In fact, this is the result of true faith till it is complete (in all
respects). I asked you whether there was anybody who, after embracing
his Deen, became displeased and discarded his Deen; your reply was in
the negative. In fact, this is the sign of true faith, for when its
pleasure enters and mixes in the hearts completely; nobody will be
displeased with it. I asked you whether he had ever broken his
promise. You replied in the negative. And such are the Messengers;
they never break their promises. When I asked you whether you fought
with him and he fought with you, you replied that he did and that
sometimes he was victorious and sometimes you. Indeed, such are the
Messengers; they are put to trials and the final victory is always
theirs. Then I asked you what he ordered you. You replied that he
ordered you to worship Allah alone and not to worship others along
with Him, to leave all that your fore-fathers used to worship, to
offer prayers, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep promises, and
to return what is entrusted to you. These are really the qualities of
a prophet who, I knew (from the previous Scriptures) would appear, but
I did not know that he would be from amongst you. If what you say is
true, he will very soon occupy the earth under my feet, and if I knew
that I would reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him;
and were I with him, then I would certainly wash his feet. "'
Abu Sufyan added, ’Caesar then asked for the letter of the Messenger
of Allah and it was read. Its contents were:
"I begin with the name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most
Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad, the slave of Allah, and His
Messenger, to Heraclius, the Ruler of the Byzantine. Peace be upon the
followers of guidance. I invite you to Islam (i.e. surrender to
Allah). Accept Islam and you will be safe; accept Islam and Allah will
bestow on you a double reward. But if you reject this invitation of
Islam, you shall be responsible for misguiding the peasants (i.e. your
nation). O people of the Scriptures! Come to a word common between you
and us, that we worship Allah, and that we associate nothing in
worship with Him; and that none of us shall take others as Gods
besides Allah. Then if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are
they who have surrendered (unto Him)" [3.64]
Abu Sufyan added, ’When Heraclius had finished his speech, there was a
great hue and cry caused by the Byzantine dignitaries surrounding him,
and there was so much noise that I did not understand what they said.
So, we were ordered out of the court.’
‘When I went out with my companions and we were alone, I said to them,
”Verily, Ibn Abi Kabsha's (i.e. the Prophet's) affair has gained
power. This is the King of Bani Al-Asfar fearing him.”’
Abu Sufyan added: 'By Allah, I became surer and surer that his Deen
would be victorious till I ended up accepting Islam.'  (Bukhari #2782)

Place of Birth and Childhood:
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, was born in the year 571
(according to the Gregorian calendar) in the tribe of Quraish [which
was held noble by all Arabs] in Makkah [which was considered the
religious capital of the Arabian Peninsula].
The Arabs would perform Hajj in Makkah, and circumambulate around the
Ka'bah which was built by Prophet Ibrahim and his son Prophet Ismael,
may Allah exalt their mention.
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, was an orphan. His father
passed away before he was born, and his mother died when he was six
years old. His grandfather, Abdul-Mutalib, took care of him, and when
he died, his uncle, Abu Talib, took care of him. His tribe and the
other tribes worshipped idols made from stone, wood and even gold.
Some of these idols were placed around the Ka'bah. People believed
that these idols could ward off harm or extend benefit.
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, was a trustworthy and honest
person. He never behaved treacherously, nor did he lie or cheat; he
was known amongst his people as 'Al-Ameen', or 'The Trustworthy'.
People would entrust him with their valuables when they wanted to
travel. He was also known as 'As-Sadiq' or 'The Truthful' for he never
told a lie. He was well-mannered, well-spoken, and he loved to help
people. His people loved and revered him and he had beautiful manners.
Allah, the Exalted, says:
Indeed you are of a great moral character.  [68:4]
Thomas Carlyle said in his book: 'Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic
in History':
'But, from an early age, he had been remarked as a thoughtful man. His
companions named him "Al Amin, The Faithful." A man of truth and
fidelity; true in what he did, in what he spoke and thought. They
noted that he always meant something. A man rather taciturn in speech;
silent when there was nothing to be said; but pertinent, wise,
sincere, when he did speak; always throwing light on the matter. This
is the only sort of speech worth speaking! Through life we find him to
have been regarded as an altogether solid, brotherly, genuine man. A
serious, sincere character; yet amiable, cordial, companionable,
jocose even - a good laugh in him withal: there are men whose laugh is
as untrue as anything about them; who cannot laugh. A spontaneous,
passionate, yet just, true-meaning man! Full of wild faculty, fire and
light; of wild worth, all uncultured; working out his life - takes in
the depth of the Desert there.'
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, liked to seclude himself in
the cave of Hira before he was commissioned as a prophet. He would
stay there many nights at a time.
He, may Allah exalt his mention, did not practice falsehood; he did
not drink any intoxicants, nor did he bow to a statue or idol, or take
an oath by them or offer to them an offering. He was a shepherd over a
flock of sheep which belonged to his people. The Prophet, may Allah
exalt his mention, said:
'Every prophet commissioned by Allah was a shepherd over a flock of
sheep.' His companions asked him: 'Even you, O Messenger of Allah?' He
said: 'Yes, I would take care of a flock of sheep for the people of
Makkah.'  (Bukhari 2143)
When Prophet Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, turned forty, he
received divine revelation; he was at the cave of Hira. The Mother of
the believers, A'ishah, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'The first thing that Allah’s Messenger, may Allah exalt his mention,
received, while in the Cave of Hira in Makkah, were good visions
[dreams]. Every time he had a dream, it would come true and clear,
like the split of the dawn. Later on, Allah’s Messenger, may Allah
exalt his mention, began to love being alone in meditation. He spent
lengthy periods for days and nights to fulfill this purpose in the
Cave before returning back to his family. He would take a supply of
food for his trip. When he came back to his wife Khadeejah, with whom
Allah is pleased, he would get a fresh supply of food and go back to
the same Cave to continue his meditation.’
‘The Truth came to him while he was in the Cave of Hira. The Angel
Jibreel, may Allah exalt his mention, came to Muhammad, may Allah
exalt his mention, and commanded him to read. Muhammad, may Allah
exalt his mention, replied, ”I cannot read!“ Jibreel, may Allah exalt
his mention, embraced Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, until he
could not breathe, and then let him go saying: ”O Muhammad! Read!“
Again, Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, replied: ”I cannot
read!“ Jibreel, may Allah exalt his mention, embraced Muhammad, may
Allah exalt his mention, for the second time. He then ordered him to
read for the third time, when he did not he embraced him tightly until
he could not breathe, and then let him go saying: ”O Muhammad!
Recite with the Name of Your Rubb! Who created, Created man, out of a
(mere) clot of congealed blood: Proclaim! And your Rubb is Most
Bountiful. [96:1-3]
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, returned home
trembling. He entered his home and told Khadeejah: “Cover me up, cover
me up!“ Khadeejah, with whom Allah is pleased, covered Muhammad, may
Allah exalt his mention, until he felt better. He then informed her
about what happened to him in the Cave of Hira. He said: ”I was
concerned about myself and my well-being.“ Khadeejah, with whom Allah
is pleased, assured Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, saying: “By
Allah! You don’t have to worry! Allah, the Exalted, will never
humiliate you! You are good to your kith and kin. You help the poor
and needy. You are generous and hospitable to your guests. You help
people who are in need.“ Khadeejah, with whom Allah is pleased, took
her husband Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, to a cousin of hers
named Waraqah bin Nawfal bin Asad bin Abdul Uzza. This man became a
Christian during the Era of Ignorance. He was a scribe, who wrote the
Scripture in Hebrew. He was an old man who became blind at the latter
part of his life. Khadeejah, with whom Allah is pleased, said to her
cousin, ”O cousin, listen to what your nephew [i.e. Muhammad , may
Allah exalt his mention, ] is about to tell you!“ Waraqah said:  ”What
is it you have seen, dear nephew?“ The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
exalt his mention, informed him of what he had seen in the Cave of
Hira. Upon hearing his report, Waraqah said, ”By Allah! This is the
Angel Jibreel, may Allah exalt his mention, who came to Prophet Musa,
may Allah exalt his mention. I wish I would be alive when your people
will drive you out of Makkah!“ The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt
his mention, wondered: ”Are they going to drive me out of Makkah?!“
Waraqah affirmed positively saying, ”Never has a man conveyed a
Message similar to what you have been charged with, except that his
people waged war against him - if I am to witness this, I will support
you.” Waraqah lived only a short period after this incident and passed
away. Revelation also stopped for a while.’  (Bukhari #3)
The chapter of the Qur'an quoted in the hadeeth above marks the
beginning when he was commissioned as a Prophet. Allah, the Exalted,
then revealed to him:
O you (Muhammad (may Allah exalt his mention) enveloped (in
garments); Arise and warn! And your Rubb (Allah) magnify! And your
garments purify!  [74:1-4]
This chapter of the Qur'an marks the beginning when he was
commissioned as a Messenger.
With the revelation of this chapter of the Qur'an the Prophet, may
Allah exalt his mention, began calling his people to Islam openly. He
began with his own people. Some of them refused adamantly to listen to
him because he was calling them to a matter which they had not
witnessed before.
The Deen of Islam is a complete way of life, which deals with
religious, political, economical and social affairs. Furthermore, the
Deen of Islam did not only call them to worship Allah alone, and to
forsake all idols and things they worshipped; rather, it prohibited
them from things they considered pleasurable, such as consuming
interest and intoxicants, fornication, and gambling. It also called
people to be just and fair with one another, and to know that there
was no difference between them except through piety. How could the
Quraish [the noblest tribe amongst Arabs] stand to be treated equally
with the slaves!! They did not only adamantly refuse to accept Islam;
rather, they harmed him and blamed him, saying that he was a crazy
person, a sorcerer and a liar. They blamed him with things they would
not dare to have blamed him with before the advent of Islam. They
incited the ignorant masses against him, and harmed him and tortured
his companions. Abdullah b. Masood, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'While the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, was standing up and
praying near the Ka'bah, a group of Quraish were sitting in their
sitting place, one of them said: 'Do you see this man? Would someone
bring the dirt and filth and bloody intestines from the camels of so
and so, and wait till he prostrates, and then place it between his
shoulders? The most wretched amongst them volunteered to do it, and
when the Prophet , may Allah exalt his mention, prostrated, he put the
filth between his shoulders, so the Prophet , may Allah exalt his
mention, stayed in prostration. They laughed so hard that they were
about to fall on each other. Someone went to Fatimah, with whom Allah
is pleased, who was a young girl, and informed her of what had
happened. She hurriedly came towards the Prophet, may Allah exalt his
mention, and removed the filth from his back, and then she turned
around and she cursed the Quraishites who were sitting in that
sitting.  (Bukhari #498)
Muneeb al-Azdi said: 'I saw the Messenger of Allah in the Era of
Ignorance saying to people:
'Say there is no god worthy of being worshipped except Allah if you
would be successful.' There were those who spat in his face, and those
who threw soil in his face, and those who swore at him until midday.
Whenever a certain young girl came with a big container of water, and
he would wash his face and hands and say: 'O daughter do not fear that
your father will be humiliated or struck by poverty.'  (Mu'jam al-
Kabeer # 805)
Urwah b. az-Zubair said, 'I asked Abdullah b. Amr al-Aas to tell me of
the worst thing the pagans did to the Prophet, may Allah exalt his
mention, and he said:
'Uqbah b. Mu'ait approached the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention,
while he was praying near the Ka'bah, and he twisted his garment
around his neck. Abu Bakr, with whom Allah is pleased, hurriedly
approached and grabbed Uqbah's shoulder and pushed him away saying:
'Do you kill a man because he proclaims Allah as his Rubb, and clear
signs have come to you from your Rubb?' ' (Bukhari 3643)
These incidents did not stop the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention,
from giving Da'wah. He called the many tribes that came to Makkah for
Hajj to Islam. A few believed from the people of Yathrib, which is
known today as Madinah, and they pledged to support him and help him
if he chose to go with them to Madinah. He sent with them Mus'ab b.
Umair, with whom Allah is pleased, who taught them Islam. After all
the hardships that the Muslims of Makkah faced from their own people,
Allah allowed them to migrate from their city to Madinah. The people
of Madinah greeted them and received them in a most extraordinary
manner. Madinah became the Capital of the Islamic state, and the point
from which the Da'wah was spread.
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, settled there and taught
people Qur'anic recitation and Islamic Jurisprudence. The inhabitants
of Madinah were greatly moved and touched by the Prophet's manners.
They loved him more than they loved their own selves; they would rush
to serve him, and spend all they had in his path. The society was
strong and its people were rich in terms of Iman (Faith) and they were
extremely happy. People loved each other, and true brotherhood was
apparent amongst its people. All people were equal; the rich, noble
and poor, black and white, Arab and non-Arab - they were all
considered as equals in the Deen of Allah, no distinction was made
among them except through piety. After the Quraish learnt of the
Prophet's Da'wah and that it had spread, they fought with the Prophet,
may Allah exalt his mention, in the first battle in Islam, the Battle
of Badr. This battle took place between two groups which were unequal
in preparations and weapons. The Muslims were 314; whereas, the pagans
were 1000 strong. Allah gave victory to the Prophet, may Allah exalt
his mention, and the Companions. After this battle, many battles took
place between the Muslims and the pagans. After eight years the
Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, was able to prepare an army
10,000 strong. They headed towards Makkah and conquered it, and with
this he defeated his people, who had harmed him and tortured his
Companions in every way. They had even been forced to leave their
property and wealth behind and flee for their lives. He decisively
defeated them, and this year was called 'The Year of the Conquest.'
Allah, the Exalted, says:
When the victory of Allah has come and the conquest, and you see the
people entering into the Deen of Allah in multitudes, then exalt him
with praise of your Rubb and ask forgiveness of Him. Indeed, He is
ever accepting of repentance.  [110:1-3]
He then gathered the people of Makkah and said to them:
'What do you think I will do to you?' They answered: 'You will only do
something favorable; you are a kind and generous brother, and a kind
and generous nephew!' The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, said:
'Go - you are free to do as you wish.'  (Baihaqi #18055)
This was one of the main reasons why many of them accepted Islam. The
Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, then returned to Madinah. After
a period of time, the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, meant to
perform Hajj, so he headed towards Makkah with 114,000 Companions and
performed Hajj. This Hajj is known as 'Haj'jatul-Wa'daa' or the
'Farewell Pilgrimage' since the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention,
never performed another Hajj, and died shortly after he performed it.
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, died in Madinah on the 12th
day of Rabi ath-thani in the 11th year of Hijrah. The Prophet, may
Allah exalt his mention, was buried in Madinah as well. The Muslims
were shocked when they learnt of his death; some Companions did not
believe it! Umar, with whom Allah is pleased, said: 'Whoever says that
Muhammad is dead, I will behead him!' Abu Bakr, with whom Allah is
pleased, then gave a speech, and read the words of Allah:
Muhammad is not but a Messenger. Other messengers have passed away
before him. So if he was to die or be killed, would you turn back on
your heels to unbelief? And He who turns back on his heels will never
harm Allah at all; but Allah will reward the grateful.  [3:144]
When Umar, with whom Allah is pleased, heard this verse he stopped
saying what he was saying, since he was very keen on applying the
rules of Allah. The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, was 63 years
old.
He stayed in Makkah for forty years, before being commissioned as a
prophet. After being commissioned as a Prophet; he lived there for
another 13 years in which he called people to Tawheed (true
monotheism). He then migrated to Madinah, and stayed there for ten
years. He continuously received the revelation there, until the Qur'an
and the Deen of Islam were complete.
George Bernard Shaw said:
‘I have always held the religion of Muhammad in high estimation
because of its wonderful vitality. It is the only religion which
appears to possess that assimilating capability to the changing phases
of existence which make itself appeal to every age - I have
prophesized about the faith of Muhammad that it would be acceptable
tomorrow as it is beginning to be acceptable to the Europe of today.
Medieval ecclesiastics, either through ignorance or bigotry, painted
Muhammadanism in the darkest colours. They were, in fact, trained to
hate both the man Muhammad and his religion. To them, Muhammad was an
anti-Christ. I have studied him, the wonderful man, and in my opinion,
far from being an anti-Christ, he must be called the Saviour of
humanity - ’

The Description of the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention:
Hind the daughter of Abu Haalah at-Tamimi, with whom Allah is pleased,
described the Prophet of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, with the
following description:
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, was a sensational
man, who was honored by all who saw him. His face glowed like the full
moon. He was of moderate height, not too tall and not too short. He
had a large head and his hair was wavy. He would part his hair if it
got long, otherwise, his hair did not exceed the lobes of his ears
under normal circumstances. He was a healthy pink. His forehead was
wide. His eyebrows were naturally groomed, and were not joined. There
was a vein between his eyebrows that swelled in case of anger. His
nose was straight and had a special glow. The bridge of his nose was
slightly high. He, may Allah exalt his mention, had a thick beard with
soft cheeks. His mouth was slightly large. He had moustaches. His
teeth had gaps in between. His neck was [pretty] like that of a doll,
and it was silvery white. He, may Allah exalt his mention, was
moderately built and very strong. His belly and chest were on the same
level. His chest and shoulders were wide. His body joints were big.
His skin was white. He had hair from the end of his breastbone to his
navel. There was no hair on his breasts, but his arms and shoulders
were hairy. His forearms were large and his palms were wide. Both his
hands and feet were short, and his fingers were of moderate length.
His feet were flat and smooth; due to the smoothness of his feet water
would not settle on them. He walked in strides and in a graceful
manner; he would lift his feet, and not drag them. Whenever he, may
Allah exalt his mention, turned he would turn with his entire body [as
opposed to turning his neck and head only]. He lowered his gaze at all
times. He looked down to earth more often than he looked up to the
heaven. He often glimpsed at things [as opposed to staring at things].
He offered the greetings to others before they offered it to him.’
Someone asked: 'Describe his manner of speech.' Hind said: 'The
Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, appeared sad most of the time,
and would be in deep thought. He would never rest completely, and he
did not speak unless he needed to. Whenever he spoke he would start
and complete his statements with the name of Allah. He spoke clearly
and uttered meaningful, precise and accurate statements only. His
statements were very decisive; no one could distort his words. He was
extremely kind and caring. He never insulted others. He was grateful
for every blessing Allah bestowed on him, no matter how minute it
seemed; he never belittled anything. He did not criticize any food he
tasted, nor did he praise it. He was never upset for worldly affairs.
If a person was wronged he would become very angry. His anger would
not subside until the person's right was given to him. He would not
become angry if he was wronged, nor would he avenge himself. When he
pointed, he pointed with his entire hand; when he was surprised he
would flip his hand. When the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention,
talked he would tap his right palm using his left thumb. When he was
angry he would turn his face away, and when he was pleased and happy
he would lower his gaze. Most of his laughter was done by smiling.
Whenever he smiled, his teeth appeared like pearls of hale.'
Al-Hasan, may Allah be pleased with him, said: ‘I did not inform al-
Husain about this (description of the Prophet) for a period of time,
but he had already asked his father (Ali, may Allah be pleased with
him) about these details. Al-Husain, may Allah be pleased with him,
said: 'I asked my father about how the Prophet, may Allah exalt his
mention, entered upon his family, and left them and about his manners
in general.’ Al-Husain, may Allah be pleased with him, said: ‘I asked
my father how the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, spent his time
in his house, and how he divided his time.' He replied: 'He divided
his time into three portions; one portion for the sake of Allah, the
other for his family, and the third he divided between himself and
people. He did not conceal any advice or guidance from any of them. He
would spend the portion he allotted for his Ummah by attending to the
needs of people according to their religious status and needs. He
would busy these people by teaching them that which would benefit them
and their Ummah, and by informing them of what they needed. He would
say to them: ‘Let those who are present convey (what they have
learned) to those who are absent, and inform me of the needs of those
who cannot attend our sitting, for: 'Whoever informs the ruler of a
person's plight, Allah would affirm him on the bridge on the Day of
Resurrection.'
Al-Husain, may Allah be pleased with him, further said, ‘I asked my
father about the manners of the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention,
while he was outside his home?’ He said, ‘He safeguarded his tongue
[from idle talk] and gave sincere counseling and talked with
beneficial speech by which he would be able to gather and unite
people. He honored the generous, kind and noble person amongst each
people, and he would charge them with the affairs of their people. He
warned people against evils and guarded himself against them as well,
though he never frowned in the face of any person. He asked about
people's situation and ordered with the good and forbade evil. He, may
Allah exalt his mention, was moderate in all his affairs. He never
wasted an opportunity to remind his companions and give them sincere
counseling. He, may Allah exalt his mention, was prepared for every
case, and would uphold the truth and was not heedless. The people who
sat nearest to him were the best among people. The best Companion was
him who offered the best advice. The Companion highest in rank was the
one who supported and helped him in the best manner.
Al-Husain, may Allah be pleased with him, said: ‘I asked my father how
the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, behaved in his sittings, and
he said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, never
got up or sat down without mentioning the name of Allah. He forbade
designating a certain spot to a person so that he would consider it as
his own. He sat wherever he found a spot. He also ordered others to do
the same, when they entered a sitting. He divided his time equally and
justly among his Companions who sat with him. The one who sat with the
Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, would think that he was the most
important and beloved individual to him. If a person came asking him
for a certain need, he would not rush him, rather he would allow the
person to complete his request and leave at his own accord. The
Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, would not return one who asked
empty-handed; he would even say nice words to him if he was not able
to fulfill his request. He had an open heart and an open mind. He was
considered like a kind and caring father to everyone; all people were
to him equal. His sittings were sittings of knowledge, perseverance,
patience, modesty, and trust. No one would raise his voice in the
presence of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention. No
one talked evil about another in his presence either. Those in the
sitting treated each other in a humble manner, and they respected the
elderly and were merciful to the young and they respected the
stranger.'
Al-Husain, may Allah be pleased with him, said: 'I asked my father
about the Prophet’s attitude with people in his meetings and sittings,
and he said to me: ‘The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his
mention, was constantly cheerful. He was extremely kind and caring. He
was never rough. He never raised his voice in public or used foul
language. He never talked ill of anyone or gossiped. He never adulated
anyone. He never disappointed anyone. He avoided three things;
argumentation, talking too much and interfering in what is of no
importance to him. He also avoided three other things; he never talked
ill of anyone, he never mocked anyone and he never spoke of anyone's
fault in front of others, nor did he criticize anyone. He spoke only
about things that he hoped to be rewarded for. Whenever he spoke his
Companions looked at the ground [out of respect and attention] it was
as if birds landed on their heads. When the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah exalt his mention, stopped talking, his Companions talked. They
never differed in front of him. Whenever one of his Companions talked,
the rest would attentively listen until he completed his statement.
Only leading Companions talked in the presence of the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah exalt his mention.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, demonstrated
extreme patience when he listened to a stranger with a difficult
accent or dialect. He would not ask the speaker any question until he
completed his statement. In fact, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
exalt his mention, directed his Companions to assist the person who
sought his help. He never interrupted a speaker until the speaker
completed his statement and stopped at his own accord or if the person
got up to leave.’  (Baihaqi)

Some of the Prophet's Manners & Characteristics:
1. Sound Intellect: The Messenger, may Allah exalt his mention, had an
excellent, complete and sound intellect. No man has ever had an
intellect as complete and perfect as his. Qadhi Iyaadh, may Allah have
mercy on him, said:
'This becomes clear to an individual when the researcher reads the
Prophet's biography and understands his state of affairs, and his
meaningful and inclusive utterances and traditions, his good manners,
ethics and moral character, his knowledge of the Torah and Gospel and
other Divine Scriptures, and his knowledge of statements of the wise,
and knowledge of bygone nations, and ability to strike examples and
implement policies and correct emotional manners. He was an example
and paradigm to which his people related to in all branches of
knowledge; acts of worship, medicine, laws of inheritance, lineage,
and other matters as well. He knew and learned all of this without
reading or examining the Scriptures of those before us, nor did he sit
with their scholars. The Prophet had no formal schooling, and was
without knowledge of the above before being commissioned as a Prophet,
nor could he read or write. The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention,
was wise to the fullest extent of his mental capacity. Allah, the
Exalted, informed him of some of what had taken place (in the past)
and of that which would take place in the future. This is a sign that
the Dominion belongs to Allah, and that He is capable over all
things.'
2. Doing Things for the Sake of Allah: The Prophet, may Allah exalt
his mention, would always do deeds through which he would seek the
pleasure of Allah. He was harmed and abused when he invited and called
people to Islam; yet he was patient and endured all of this, and hoped
for the reward of Allah. Abdullah b. Masood, with whom Allah is
pleased, said:
'It is as though I am looking at the Prophet, may Allah exalt his
mention, talking about a Prophet who was hurt by his people. He wiped
the blood from his face and said: 'O Allah! Forgive my people, for
they know not!'  (Bukhari #3290)
Jundub b. Sufyaan, with whom Allah is pleased, said that the
Messenger's finger bled during one of the battles, and he said:
'You are but a finger which has bled; which suffers in the path of
Allah.'  (Bukhari #2648)
3. Sincerity: The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, was sincere
and honest in all his matters, as Allah had ordered him. Allah, the
Exalted, said:
(Say, 'Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and my
dying are for Allah, Rubb of the worlds. No partner has He. And this I
have been commanded, and I am the first (among you) of the Muslims.)
[6:162-163]
4. Good Morals, Ethics and Companionship: The narrator said,
"I asked A'ishah, with whom Allah is pleased, to inform me of the
Prophet's manners, and she said: 'His manners were the Qur'an'"
This means that the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, abided by
its laws and commands and abstained from its prohibitions. He would
observe the virtuous deeds mentioned in it. The Prophet, may Allah
exalt his mention, said:
'Allah has sent me to perfect good manners and to do good
deeds.' (Bukhari & Ahmed)
Allah, the Exalted, described the Prophet, may Allah exalt his
mention, saying:
(And indeed, you are of a great moral character) [68:4]
Anas b. Malik, with whom Allah is pleased, who was the servant of the
Prophet , may Allah exalt his mention, for ten years; day in and day
out, during the Prophet's travels and when he was a resident in
Madinah. Throughout this period of time, he knew of the Prophet's
manners. He said:
'The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, did not swear at anyone,
nor was he rude, nor did he curse anyone. When he blamed anyone he
would say: 'What is wrong with him, may dust be cast in his
face.'   (Bukhari #5684)
5. Politeness and Good Manners: Sahl b. Sa'd, with whom Allah is
pleased, reported:
"A drink was brought to the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, and
he drank from it. On his right side there was a young boy and on his
left side were elderly men. He asked the young boy: 'Do you mind if I
give the drink to them?' The young boy said: 'O Prophet of Allah! By
Allah! I would not prefer anyone to drink from the place you drank.
This is my fair share [due to sitting to your right].’ The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, handed the boy the
drink."  (Bukhari #2319)
6. Love for Reformation and Reconciliation: Sahl b. Sa'd, with whom
Allah is pleased, said that the people of Qubaa' fought amongst
themselves and threw rocks at each other. The Prophet, may Allah exalt
his mention, said:
'Let us go to resolve the situation and make peace between
them.'  (Bukhari #2547)
7. Ordering with the good and forbidding evil: Abdullah b. Abbas, with
whom Allah is pleased, said:
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, saw a man wearing
a gold ring, so he reached for it, removed it and threw it. He then
said:
'Would one of you seek a burning charcoal and place it on his hand?!'
The man was later told, after the Prophet, may Allah exalt his
mention, left: 'Take your ring! Make good use of it [by selling it].'
The man said: 'No, by Allah! I will never take it after the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, threw it away.'  (Muslim #2090)
8. Love of Purification: Muhaajir b. Qunfudth, with whom Allah is
pleased, reported that he passed by the Prophet , may Allah exalt his
mention, while he was urinating; he greeted him with Salaam, but the
Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, did not return the greeting
until he made wudhu and apologized saying:
'I disliked that I should mention Allah's name while I am not in a
state of purity.'  (Ibn Khuzaimah #206)
9. Safeguarding and Minding One's Language: Abdullah b. Abi O'faa,
with whom Allah is pleased, said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah exalt his mention, would busy himself with the remembrance of
Allah; he would not talk in vain. He would lengthen his prayers and
shorten the speech, and he would not hesitate to help and take care of
the needs of a needy, poor or widow.  (Ibn Hib'ban #6423)
10. Excelling in Acts of Worship: A'ishah, with whom is Allah is
pleased, said that the Prophet of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention,
used to pray during the night until his feet would swell.
A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: 'Why do you do this, O
Messenger of Allah, and Allah has forgiven your past and future sins?'
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, said: 'Shall I not be a
grateful slave?'  (Bukhari #4557)
11. Forbearance and Kindness: Abu Hurairah, with whom Allah is
pleased, said At-Tufail b. Amr ad-Dawsi and his companions came to
meet the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention.
They said: 'O Messenger of Allah, the tribe of Daws, has refused to
accept Islam, so supplicate Allah against them. It was said: ‘the
tribe of Daws is doomed and destroyed!’ The Prophet, may Allah exalt
his mention, raised his hands and said: 'O Allah guide the tribe of
Daws and bring them!'
12. Good Appearance: Al-Baraa' b. Aazib, with whom Allah is pleased,
said:
'The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, was a person of average
height. His shoulders were wide. His hair reached his earlobes. Once I
saw him adorned in a red garment; I never saw anything more beautiful
than him.'  (Bukhari #2358)
13. Asceticism in Worldly Affairs: Abdullah b. Masood, with whom Allah
is pleased, said:
'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, went to sleep on
a mat. He got up and he had marks on his side due to the mat that he
had slept on. We said: 'O Messenger of Allah, shall we not make
bedding for you?' He said: 'What do I have to do with this world? I am
only like a wayfarer who rides a beast that stopped to take shade and
rest under a tree, and then leaves it behind and continues on the
journey.'  (Tirmidthi #2377)
Amr' b. al-Haarith, with whom Allah is pleased, said the Messenger of
Allah , may Allah exalt his mention, did not leave a Dirham or Dinar,
or slave male or female after his death. He only left behind his white
mule, his weapons and a piece of land which he declared as Sadaqah
(charity).'  (Bukhari #2588)
14. Altruism: Sahl b. Sa'd, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'A woman gave the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, a
Burdah (gown). The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, asked his
Companions: 'Do you know what a Burdah is?' They replied, 'Yes, O
Prophet of Allah! It is a piece of woven cloth [similar to a shawl].
The woman said: 'O Prophet of Allah! I have woven this shawl with my
own hands, for you to wear.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt
his mention, took it while he direly needed it. After a while, the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, came out of his home
wearing it, and a Companion said to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
exalt his mention, : 'O Prophet of Allah! Grant me this shawl to
wear!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, said:
'Yes.' He thereafter sat for awhile, and headed back home, folded it
and gave it to the person who asked for it. The Companions, with whom
Allah is pleased, scolded him saying: 'It was not appropriate for you
to ask for his shawl; especially since you know he would not turn
anyone down, or send them away empty-handed! The man said: 'By Allah!
I only asked him to give it to me because I want to be shrouded in
this shawl when I die.' Sahl, the narrator of the Hadeeth, with whom
Allah is pleased, said: 'The shawl was used as a shroud for that man
when he died.'  (Bukhari #1987)
15. Strong Faith and Dependence on Allah: Abu Bakr, with whom Allah is
pleased, said:
‘I looked at the feet of the pagans while we were in the cave [of
Thawr]. I said, ‘'O Prophet of Allah! If anyone of them looks down at
his feet he would see us!’ The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his
mention, said: ‘O Abu Bakr! What do you think of two with whom Allah,
the Exalted, is their Third?’  (Muslim #1854)
16. Kindness and Compassion: Abu Qatadah, with whom Allah is pleased,
said:
'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, performed Salah
(prayer) while he was carrying a young girl named Umaamah, daughter of
Abul-Aas. When he bowed, he put her on the ground, and when he stood
up, he would carry her again.'  (Bukhari #5650)
17. Simplification and Ease: Anas, with whom Allah is pleased, said
that the Messenger of Allah , may Allah exalt his mention, said:
'I start the prayer with the intention of lengthening it, but when I
hear a child crying, I shorten the prayer as I know the mother of that
child would suffer from his screams!’  (Bukhari #677)
18. Fearing Allah, being Mindful to not trespass His Limits and
Devotion: Abu Hurairah, with whom Allah is pleased, said that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, said:
‘Sometimes, when I return to my family, I would find a date-fruit on
the bed. I would pick it up to eat it; but I would fear that it was
from the charity, and thus, throw it back [on the ground].’  (Bukhari
#2300)
19. Expending Generously: Anas bin Malik, with whom Allah is pleased,
said:
'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, was never asked
for something when someone accepted Islam, except that he granted that
person what he asked. A man came to the Prophet, may Allah exalt his
mention, and he gave him a herd of sheep that was grazing between two
mountains. The man returned to his people and said: 'O my people
accept Islam! Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, gives out
generously like one who does not fear poverty.'  (Muslim #2312)
20. Cooperation: A’ishah, with whom Allah is pleased, was once asked
about how the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, behaved with his
family. She said:
'He helped and assisted his family members with their chores; but when
the call to prayer was heard, he would leave to attend the prayers.'
Al-Baraa bin ‘Azib, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
‘I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, on the Day
of the Trench carrying dirt [that was dug from the trench] until the
dirt covered his chest. He was quite hairy. I heard him saying a few
lines of Abdullah b. Rawaahah's poetry: 'O Allah! Had it not been for
You, We would have never been guided, nor offered prayers or give in
charity. O Allah! Let tranquility descend upon us, and make us firm
when we meet our enemies. Verily they have transgressed against us!
And if they wish for an affliction we reject and refuse it! He, may
Allah exalt his mention, raised his voice while saying these lines of
poetry.'  (Bukhari #2780)
21. Truthfulness: A'ishah, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'The trait and characteristic which the Prophet, may Allah exalt his
mention, hated most was lying. A man would tell a lie in the presence
of the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, and he would hold it
against him, until he knew that he repented.' (Tirmidthi 1973)
Even his enemies attested to his truthfulness. Abu Jahl, who was one
of the harshest enemies, said: ‘O Muhammad! I do not say that you are
a liar! I only deny what you brought and what you call people to.’
Allah, the Exalted, says:
(We know indeed that what they say certainly grieves you, but surely
they do not call you a liar; but the unjust deny the verses of
Allah.)  [6:33]
22. Aggrandizing the limits and boundaries of Allah: A'ishah, with
whom Allah is pleased, said:
'The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, was not given a choice
between two matters, except that he chose the easier of the two, as
long as it was not a sinful act. If that act was a sinful act, he
would be the farthest from it. By Allah! He never avenged himself. He
only became angry when people transgressed the limits and boundaries
of Allah; in that case he avenged.'  (Bukhari #6404)
23. Pleasant Facial Expression: Abdullah bin al-Harith, with whom
Allah is pleased, said:
‘I have never seen a man who smiled as much as the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah exalt his mention.'  (Tirmidthi #2641)
24. Honesty and Loyalty: The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, was
well-known for his honesty. The pagans of Makkah -who were openly
hostile towards him- would leave their trust-items with him. His
honesty and loyalty was tested when the pagans of Makkah abused him
and tortured his companions and drove them out of their homes. He
ordered his nephew, Ali b. Abi Talib, with whom Allah is pleased, to
postpone his migration for three days to return to people their trust-
items.
Another example of his honesty and loyalty is demonstrated in the
Truce of Hudaibiyah, wherein he agreed to the article in the treaty
which stated that any man who left the Prophet, may Allah exalt his
mention, would not be returned to him, and any man who left Makkah
would be returned to them. Before the treaty was concluded a man named
Abu Jandal b. Amr had managed to escape from the pagans of Makkah and
rushed to join Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention. The pagans asked
Muhammad to honor his pledge and return the escapee. The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, said:
'O Abu Jandal! Be patient and ask Allah to grant you patience. Allah
will surely help you and those who are persecuted and make it easy for
you. We have signed an agreement with them, and we certainly do not
betray or act treacherously.'  (Baihaquee #18611)
25. Bravery and courage: Ali, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
‘You should have seen me on the Day of Badr! We sought refuge with the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention. He was the closest
among of us to the enemy. On that Day, the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah exalt his mention, was the strongest one among us.’  (Ahmed
#654)
As for his courage and bravery under normal circumstances - Anas b.
Malik, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, was the best of
people and the most courageous. One night, the people of Madinah were
frightened and headed towards the sounds they heard during the night.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, met them while
coming back from the place of the sound, after he made sure that there
was no trouble. He was riding a horse that belonged to Abu Talhah,
with whom Allah is pleased, without any saddle, and he had his sword
with him. He was assuring the people, saying: 'Do not be frightened!
Do not be frightened!’
Anas, with whom Allah is pleased, further said: ‘Verily, we found the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, to be like an
ocean.’     (Bukhari #2751)
He met up with people riding a horse with no saddle, and he carried
his sword, for there might be a reason or need to use it. He did not
wait for others to check out the source of trouble; as is done in
these situations.
In the Battle of Uhud, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his
mention, consulted his Companions. They advised him to fight, while he
himself did not see the need to fight. However, he took their advice.
The Companions, upon learning the Prophet’s feelings regretted what
they had done. The Ansaris said to him, 'O Prophet of Allah! Do as you
please.’ But, he replied:
‘It does not befit a Prophet who has worn his war attire to remove it
until he fights.'  (Ahmed #14829)
26. Generosity and Hospitality: Ibn Ab'bas, with whom Allah is
pleased, said:
'The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, was the most generous of
people. He was most generous during Ramadhan when he met Jibreel, may
Allah render him safe from every derogatory thing; he would meet him
every night during Ramadhan to practice and review the Qur'an with
him. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, was so
generous, that he was faster than the swiftest wind in this regard.
(Bukhari #6)
Abu Dharr, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'I was walking with the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, in the
Har'rah (volcanic region) of Madinah and we faced the mount of Uhud;
the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, said: 'O Abu Dharr!' I said:
'Here I am O Messenger of Allah!' He said: 'It would not please me to
have an amount of gold equal to the weight of Mount Uhud, until I
expend and give out (in the sake of Allah) within a night or within
three nights. I would keep a Dinar of it to help those who are in
debt.  (Bukhari #2312)
Jabir b. Abdullah, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, did not refuse to give
anything which he had, to someone if he asked for it.'  (Bukhari
#5687)
27. Bashfulness and Modesty: Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri, with whom Allah is
pleased, said:
'The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, was more modest and bashful
than a virgin who hides in the women's quarter of the tent. If he
hated or disliked something, we could sense it from his facial
expressions.'  (Bukhari #5751)
28. Humbleness: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention,
was the most humble person. He was so humble that if a stranger were
to enter the Masjid and approach the Prophet's sitting place and he
was sitting with his Companions one would not be able to distinguish
him from his Companions.
Anas bin Malik, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'Once, while we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah , may Allah
exalt his mention, in the Masjid, a man on his camel came in, after he
tied it with a rope, he asked: 'Who of you is Muhammad?' The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, was sitting on the ground while
he was leaning, with his Companions. We directed the Bedouin, saying:
'This white man, who is leaning on the ground.' The Prophet, may Allah
exalt his mention, did not differ nor distinguish himself from his
Companions.
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, would not hesitate to help
the poor, needy and widows in their needs. Anas b. Malik, with whom
Allah is pleased, said:
'A woman from the people of Madinah who was partially insane said to
the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, : 'I have to ask you about
something.' He helped her and took care of her needs.'  (Bukhari #670)
29. Mercy and Compassion: Abu Masood al-Ansari, with whom Allah is
pleased, said:
'A man came to the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, and said: "O
Messenger of Allah! By Allah! I do not pray Fajr prayer because so and
so lengthens the prayer." He said: 'I have never seen the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, deliver a speech in such an angry
state. He said:
'O People! Verily there are among you those who chase people away! If
you lead people in prayer, shorten the prayer. There are old and weak
people and those with special needs behind you in prayer.'  (Bukhari
#670)
Osama bin Zaid, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
‘We were sitting with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his
mention. One of his daughters sent a person calling him to visit her
and see her son, who was on his deathbed. The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah exalt his mention, told the person to tell her: 'Truly to Allah
belongs what He took, and He has given everything a set time. Command
her to be patient and to seek the reward of Allah, the Exalted.' His
daughter, with whom Allah is pleased, sent the same person back again
saying: 'O Prophet of Allah! Your daughter took an oath that you
should come.’ The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, got
up, and Sa'd bin Ubaadah and Mu’adth bin Jabal accompanied him. The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, sat with the child
while he was on his deathbed. The child’s eyes froze in their places
like stones. Upon seeing that, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt
his mention, wept. Sa'd said to him, ‘What is this 'O Prophet of
Allah?’ He said: ‘This is a mercy that Allah, the Exalted, places in
the hearts of His slaves. Truly, Allah is merciful to those who are
merciful towards others.’  (Bukhari #6942)
30. Perseverance and Forgiveness: Anas bin Malik, with whom Allah is
pleased, said:
‘Once, I was walking with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his
mention, while he was wearing a Yemeni cloak with a collar with rough
edges. A Bedouin grabbed him strongly. I looked at the side of his
neck and saw that the edge of the cloak left a mark on his neck. The
Bedouin said, ‘Oh Muhammad! Give me [some] of the wealth of Allah that
you have.’ The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, turned
to the Bedouin, laughed and ordered that he be given [some
money].’  (Bukhari #2980)
Another example of his perseverance is the story of the Jewish Rabbi,
Zaid bin Sa'nah. Zaid loaned the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt
his mention, something. Zaid said:
‘Two or three days prior to the return of the debt, the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, was attending the funeral of a man
from the Ansar. Abu Bakr and Umar, Uthman and some other Companions,
with whom Allah is pleased, were with the Prophet, may Allah exalt his
mention. After he prayed the Jinazah (funeral prayer) he sat down
close to a wall, and I came towards him, grabbed him by the edges of
his cloak and looked at him in a harsh way, and said: 'O Muhammad!
Will you not pay me back my loan? I have not known the family of Abdul-
Mutalib to delay in repaying debts!
I looked at Umar b. al-Khat'taab, with whom Allah is pleased - his
eyes were swollen with anger! He looked at me and said: 'O Enemy of
Allah, do you talk to the Messenger of Allah and behave towards him in
this manner?! By the One who sent him with the truth, had it not been
for the fear of missing it (Jannah) I would have beheaded you with my
sword! The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, was looking at Umar
in a calm and peaceful manner, and he said: 'O Umar, you should have
given us sincere counseling, rather than to do what you did! O Umar,
go and repay him his loan, and give him twenty Sa'a (measurement of
weight) extra because you scared him!'
Zaid said: 'Umar went with me, and repaid me the debt, and gave me
over it twenty Sa'a of dates. I asked him: 'What is this?' He said:
'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, ordered me to
give it, because I frightened you.' Zaid then asked Umar: 'O Umar, do
you know who I am?' Umar said: 'No, I don't - who are you?' Zaid said:
'I am Zaid b. Sa'nah.' Umar inquired: 'The Rabbi?' Zaid answered:
'Yes, the Rabbi.' Umar then asked him: 'What made you say what you
said to the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, and do what you did
to him?' Zaid answered: 'O Umar, I have seen all the signs of
prophethood in the face of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his
mention, except two - his patience and perseverance precede his
ignorance and the second, is the more harsher you are towards him, the
kinder and more patient he becomes, and I am now satisfied. O Umar, I
hold you as a witness that I testify and am satisfied that there is no
true god worthy of being worshipped except Allah alone, and my Deen is
Islam and Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, is my Prophet. I also
hold you as a witness that half of my wealth - and I am among the
wealthiest people in Madinah - I give for the sake of Allah to the
entire Ummah.' Umar, with whom Allah is pleased, said: 'you will not
be able to distribute your wealth to the whole Ummah (nation), so say,
'I will distribute it to some of the Ummah of Muhammad, may Allah
exalt his mention.' Zaid said: 'I said, then I will distribute (the
apportioned) wealth to some of the Ummah.' Both Zaid and Umar, with
whom Allah is pleased, returned to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
exalt his mention. Zaid said to him: 'I bear witness that there is no
true god worthy of being worshipped except Allah alone, and that
Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, is the slave of Allah and His
Messenger.' He believed in him, and witnessed many battles and then
died in the Battle of Tabuk while he was encountering the enemy - may
Allah have mercy on Zaid.'  (Ibn Hibban #288)
A great example of his forgiveness and perseverance is apparent when
he pardoned the people of Makkah after its conquest. When the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, gathered the people;
who had abused, harmed and tortured him and his companions, and had
driven them out of the city of Makkah, he said:
'What do you think I should do to you?' They said: 'You are a kind,
generous brother and nephew!' He said: 'Go - you are free!'  (Baihaqi
#18055)
31. Patience: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, was
a paradigm of patience. He was patient with his people before calling
them to Islam; for they would worship idols and do sinful acts. He was
patient and tolerant with the abuse and harm the pagans of Makkah
inflicted on him and his Companions and sought the reward of Allah. He
also was patient and tolerant with the abuse of the hypocrites in
Madinah.
He was a paradigm of patience when he lost his loved ones; his wife
Khadeejah, died during his life. All his children died during his
life, except for Fatimah, with whom Allah is pleased. His uncle al-
Ab'bas, with whom Allah is pleased, passed away as well. The Prophet,
may Allah exalt his mention, was patient and sought the reward of
Allah.
Anas b. Malik, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'We entered the house of Abu Saif - the blacksmith - with the Prophet,
may Allah exalt his mention. Abu Saif's wife was the wet-nurse of his
son, Ibraheem. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention,
lifted his son Ibraheem, and smelled and kissed him. After a while he
went and saw his son again - he was dying. The Prophet, may Allah
exalt his mention, started to cry. Abdurrahmaan b. Auf, with whom
Allah is pleased, said: 'O Prophet of Allah, you too cry!' The
Messenger, may Allah exalt his mention, said: 'O Ibn Auf, this is a
mercy' - the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, shed more tears and
said: 'The eyes shed tears, the heart is saddened, and we only say
what pleases our Rubb, and we are saddened by your death, O
Ibraheem!'  (Bukhari #1241)
32. Justice and Fairness: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his
mention, was just and fair in every aspect of his life, and in the
application of Shari'ah (Islamic Jurisprudential Law).
A'ishah, the mother of Believers, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
‘The people of Quraish were extremely concerned about the Makhzoomi
woman (i.e. the woman from the tribe of Bani Makhzoom) who committed a
theft. They conversed among themselves and said, ‘Who can intercede on
her behalf with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention?’
They finally said: 'Who dares to speak to the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah exalt his mention, in this matter except Usamah b. Zaid, the
most beloved young man to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his
mention, .' So Usamah, with whom Allah is pleased, spoke to the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, regarding the woman.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, said:
'O Usamah! Do you intercede (on their behalf to disregard) one of
Allah's castigations and punishments!’
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, got up and
delivered a speech, saying:
'People before you were destroyed because when the noble among them
stole, they would let him go; and if the poor and weak stole they
would punish him. By Allah! If Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad
stole, I would cut her hand off.'  (Bukhari #3288)
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, was just and fair
and allowed others to avenge themselves if he harmed them. Usaid b.
Hudhair, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'A man from the Ansar, was cracking jokes with people and making them
laugh, and the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, passed by him,
and poked him at his side lightly with a branch of a tree that he was
carrying. The man exclaimed: 'O Prophet of Allah! Allow me to avenge
myself!' The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, said: 'Go Ahead!'
The man said: 'O Messenger of Allah, you are wearing a garment, and I
was not, when you poked me!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt
his mention, lifted his upper garment, and the Ansari kissed his body
saying: 'I only meant to do this, O Messenger of Allah!'  (Abu Dawood
#5224)
33. Fearing Allah, and Being Mindful of Him: The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah exalt his mention, was the most mindful person of Allah.
Abdullah bin Masoud, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
‘[Once] the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, said to
me: ‘Recite to me from the Qur'an!' Abdullah b. Masood, with whom
Allah is pleased, said: 'Shall I recite it to you, and it is revealed
to you!' The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, said: 'Yes.' He
said: 'I started to recite Surat an-Nisaa, until I reached the verse:
(How then if We brought from each nation a witness, and We brought you
as a witness against these people!)  (4:41)
Upon hearing this verse, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his
mention, said: 'That is enough!' Abdullah b. Masood, with whom Allah
is pleased, said, I turned around and saw the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah exalt his mention, crying.'  (Bukhari #4763)
A'ishah, the mother of the believers, with whom Allah is pleased,
said:
‘If the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, saw dark
clouds in the sky; he would pace forwards and backwards and would exit
his house and enter it. As soon as it rained, the Prophet, may Allah
exalt his mention, would relax. A'ishah, with whom Allah is pleased,
asked him about it, and he said: 'I do not know, it may be as some
people said:
(Then, when they saw the (penalty in the shape of) a cloud traversing
the sky, coming to meet their valleys, they said: 'This cloud will
give us rain! Nay, it is the (calamity) you were asking to be
hastened! A wind wherein is a Grievous Penalty!)  (46:24)
34. Satisfaction and Richness of the Heart: Umar b. al-Khattab, with
whom Allah is pleased, said:
'I entered the Messenger's house, may Allah exalt his mention, and I
found him sitting on a mat. He had a leather pillow stuffed with
fibers. He had a pot of water by his feet, and there was some clothes
hung on the wall. His side had marks due to the mat that he lay on.
Umar, with whom Allah is pleased, wept when he saw this, and the
Messenger, may Allah exalt his mention, asked him: 'Why do you weep?'
Umar said: 'O Prophet of Allah! Khosrau and Caesar enjoy the best of
this world, and you are suffering in poverty?!' He said: 'Aren't you
pleased that they enjoy this world, and we will enjoy the
Hereafter?'  (Bukhari #4629)
35. Hoping for Goodness Even for his Enemies: A'ishah, the mother of
the Believers, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
‘I asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention: "Did you
face a day harder and more intense than the Battle of Uhud?” He
replied: 'I suffered a lot from your people! The worst I suffered was
on the Day of al-‘Aqabah when I spoke to Ali b. Abd Yaleel b. Abd
Kilaal (in order to support me) but he disappointed me and left me. I
left the area while I was quite worried, and walked - when I reached
an area called Qarn ath-Tha'alib, I raised my head to the sky and
noticed a cloud that shaded me. Jibreel, may Allah exalt his mention,
called me and said: 'O Muhammad! Allah, the Exalted, has heard what
your people have said to you - and has sent the Angel in charge of the
mountains, so you can command him to do what you please.' The Prophet,
may Allah exalt his mention, said: 'The Angel in charge of the
mountains called me saying: 'May Allah exalt your mention and render
you safe from every derogatory thing! O Muhammad, I will do whatever
you command me to do. If you like I can bring the Akhshabain mountains
together and crush them all.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt
his mention, said: 'It may be that Allah raises from among them a
progeny who worship Allah alone and associate no partners with
Him.'  (Bukhari #3059)

Abdullah b. Umar, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'When Abdullah b. Ubai b. Salool died, his son Abdullah b. Abdullah
came to the Prophet , may Allah exalt his mention, and asked him for
his garment, so that they could shroud their father with it. He then
asked the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, to pray the Jinazah
(funeral prayer) on him, and he got up to do so, but Umar, with whom
Allah is pleased, grabbed the outer garment of the Prophet, may Allah
exalt his mention, and said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Will you pray on
him, and Allah has forbidden you to do so! The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah exalt his mention, said: 'Allah has given me the choice, for He
says:
(Ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them; even if
you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will not forgive
them; this is because they disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger, and
Allah does not guide the transgressing people.)  [9:80]
And I will ask for forgiveness for him more than seventy times.' Umar,
with whom Allah is pleased, then said: 'He is a hypocrite!' The
Prophet, performed the prayer, and Allah revealed:
(And never offer prayer for any one of them who dies and do not stand
by his grave; surely they disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger, and
they shall die in transgression.)  [9:84]  (Bukhari #2400)

Some of the Prophet's Ethical Manners:
1. The Prophet's close relations with his Companions: This is well-
known due to the fact that we have detailed reports about the
Prophet's biography. The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, is the
example which we should emulate in all our matters. Jareer b.
Abdullah, with whom Allah is pleased, said: 'The Prophet, may Allah
exalt his mention, did not prevent me from sitting with him, since I
accepted Islam. He always smiled when he looked at me. I once
complained to him, that I could not ride a horse and he hit me in my
chest and supplicated Allah, saying:
'O Allah! Steady him, and make him a person who guides others and a
source of guidance.'  (Bukhari #5739)
2. The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, would entertain his
Companions and joke with them: Anas b. Malik, with whom Allah is
pleased, said the Messenger of Allah , may Allah exalt his mention,
was the most well mannered person. I had a young brother whose name
was Abu Umair - he would play with a small bird called 'An-Nughair'.
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, said to him:
'O Abu Umair, what did the Nughair do?!' while he was playing with
it.  (Muslim #2150)
The Prophet , may Allah exalt his mention, did not only entertain and
joke with his companions by word of mouth; rather, he sported and
amused them as well. Anas b. Malik, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'A Bedouin named Zahir b. Haram would give gifts to the Prophet, may
Allah exalt his mention, and he would prepare things for him as well.
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, said: 'Zahir is our desert,
and we are his city.'
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, approached him while he was
selling his goods, and the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention,
hugged him from behind, and he could not see him. He then said: 'Let
me go!' When he knew that it was the Prophet, may Allah exalt his
mention, who was hugging him, he pressed his back towards the
Messenger's chest! The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his
mention, then said: 'Who will buy this slave from me?' Zahir said: 'O
Messenger of Allah, I am worthless!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
exalt his mention, said:
'You are not considered worthless by Allah!' or he said: 'You are
valuable and precious to Allah.' (Ibn Hibban #5790)
3. He would consult his Companions: The Prophet , may Allah exalt his
mention, would consult his Companions, and take their opinions and
points of view into consideration in issues and matters which no
textual proofs were revealed. Abu Hurairah, with whom Allah is
pleased, said:
'I have not seen a person more keen for the sincere advice of his
companions than the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his
mention.'  (Tirmidthi #1714)
4. Visiting the sick, whether he was Muslim or non-Muslim: The
Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, was concerned about his
Companions and would make sure that they were well. If he was told
about a Companion who was sick, he would rush to visit him with the
Companions that were present with him. He wouldn't only visit the
Muslims who were sick; rather, he would visit even non-Muslims. Anas
b. Malik, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'A Jewish boy would serve the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention,
and he fell sick, so the Prophet , may Allah exalt his mention, said:
'Let us go and visit him.' They went to visit him, and found his
father sitting by his head, and the Messenger of Allah , may Allah
exalt his mention, said: 'proclaim that there is no true god worthy of
being worshipped except Allah alone' and I will intercede on your
behalf on account of it on the Day of Resurrection.' The boy looked at
his father, and the father said: 'Obey Abul-Qasim!' so the boy
uttered: 'There is no true god worthy of being worshipped except Allah
alone, and Muhammad , may Allah exalt his mention, is the last
Messenger.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, said:
'All praise is due to Allah, Who saved him from the Fire of
Hell.'  (Ibn Hibban #2960)
5. He was grateful for people's goodness towards him, and would reward
that generously: Abdullah b. Umar, with whom Allah is pleased, said
that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, said:
'Whoever seeks refuge with Allah against your evil, then do not harm
him. Whoever asks you by Allah, then give him. Whoever invites you,
then accept his invitation. Whoever does a favor for you or an act of
kindness, then repay him in a similar manner; but if you do not find
that which you can reward him with, then supplicate Allah for him
continuously, until you think you have repaid him.'  (Ahmed #6106)
A'ishah, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, would accept
gifts, and reward generously on account of that.' (Bukhari #2445)
6. The Messenger's love for everything which is beautiful and good:
Anas, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'The hand of the Messenger of Allah , may Allah exalt his mention, was
softer than any silk that I had ever touched, and his scent was
sweeter than any perfume that I had ever smelt.'  (Bukhari #3368)
7. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, loved to help
others by interceding on their behalf:
Abdullah b. Abbas, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'The husband of Bareerah, with whom Allah is pleased, was a slave
whose name was Mugheeth - I saw him walking behind her in the streets
of Madinah crying, and his tears were falling off his beard. The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, said to Al-Abbas:
'Doesn't it amaze you, how much Mugheeth loves Bareerah, and how much
she hates Mugheeth!'
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, said to Bareerah: 'Why don't
you go back to him?' She said to him: 'Are you commanding me to do
so?' He said: 'No, but I am interceding on his behalf.' She said: 'I
have no need for him.'  (Bukhari # 4875)
8. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, would serve
himself: A'ishah, with whom Allah is pleased, said:
'I was asked how the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention,
behaved in his house.' She said: 'He was like any man; he washed his
clothes, milked his sheep, and served
himself.'                         (Ahmed 24998)
The Prophet's excellent manners, not only made him serve himself;
rather, he would serve others as well. A'ishah, with whom Allah is
pleased, said:
'I was asked how the Messenger of Allah, may Allah exalt his mention,
behaved in his house.' She said: 'He would help out in the house with
the daily chores, and when he heard the Adthan he would leave for the
Masjid.' (Bukhari 5048)

Statements of Justice and Equity:
1. The German Poet, Goethe, said: 'I looked into history for a human
paradigm and found it to be in Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention.'
2. Professor Keith Moore, said in his book: "The Developing Human": It
is clear to me that these statements must have come to Muhammad from
God, or Allah, because most of this knowledge was not discovered until
many centuries later. This proves to me that Muhammad must have been a
messenger of God, or Allah.' He further said: 'I have no difficulty in
my mind reconciling that this is a divine inspiration or revelation,
which lead him to these statements.'
3. Dr. Maurice Bucaille, said in his book: "The Qur'an, and Modern
Science": ‘A totally objective examination of it [the Qur'an] in the
light of modern knowledge, leads us to recognize the agreement between
the two, as has been already noted on repeated occasions. It makes us
deem it quite unthinkable for a man of Muhammad's time to have been
the author of such statements, on account of the state of knowledge in
his day. Such considerations are part of what gives the Qur'anic
Revelation its unique place, and forces the impartial scientist to
admit his inability to provide an explanation which calls solely upon
materialistic reasoning.’
4. Annie Besant in 'The Life and Teachings of Mohammad,' said: 'It is
impossible for anyone who studies the life and character of the great
Prophet of Arabia, who knew how he taught and how he lived, to feel
anything but reverence for the mighty Prophet, one of the great
messengers of the Supreme. And although in what I put to you I shall
say many things which may be familiar to many, yet I myself feel,
whenever I reread them, a new way of admiration, a new sense of
reverence for that mighty Arabian teacher.'
5. Dr. Gustav Weil in 'History of the Islamic Peoples' said: 'Muhammad
was a shining example to his people. His character was pure and
stainless. His house, his dress, his food –they were characterized by
a rare simplicity. So unpretentious was he that he would receive from
his companions no special mark of reverence, nor would he accept any
service from his slave which he could do for himself. He was
accessible to all at all times. He visited the sick and was full of
sympathy for all. Unlimited was his benevolence and generosity as also
was his anxious care for the welfare of the community.'
6. Maurice Gaudefroy said: 'Muhammad was a prophet, not a theologian,
a fact so evident that one is loath to state it. The men who
surrounded him and constituted the influential elite of the primate
Muslim community, contented themselves with obeying the law that he
had proclaimed in the name of Allah and with following his teaching
and example.'
7. Washington Irving, said: 'His military triumphs awakened no pride
nor vain glory as they would have done had they been effected by
selfish purposes. In the time of his greatest power he maintained the
same simplicity of manner and appearance as in the days of his
adversity. So far from affecting regal state, he was displeased if, on
entering a room, any unusual testimonial of respect was shown to
him.'
8. Marquis of Dufferin said: 'It is to Mussulman science, to Mussulman
art, and to Mussulman literature that Europe has been in a great
measure indebted for its extrication from the darkness of the Middle
Ages.'

The Wives of the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention:
After the death of his first wife, Khadeejah, with whom Allah is
pleased, the Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, married eleven
women; all were divorcees, except for A'ishah, with whom Allah is
pleased. Six of his wives were from the tribe of Quraish, and five
were from different Arabian tribes, and one was from the Coptic
Christians in Egypt. She was the mother of Ibraheem. The Prophet, may
Allah exalt his mention, said:
'If you own a Coptic Christian, treat them kindly for between us is a
pledge and relationship.'  (Abdurrazaaq #19325)
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, married these women for a
number of reasons:
1. Religious and legislative purpose: The Prophet, may Allah exalt his
mention, married Zainab b. Jahsh, with whom Allah is pleased. The
Arabs in the Era of Ignorance would prohibit a man from marrying the
wife of his adopted son; they believed that the adopted son was like a
man's actual son in all aspects. The Prophet, may Allah exalt his
mention, married her, although she was the wife of his adopted son,
Zaid b. Harithah, with whom Allah is pleased. The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah exalt his mention, married her to abolish this belief.
Allah, the Exalted, says:
(And when you said to him to whom Allah had shown favor and to whom
you had shown a favor: keep your wife to yourself and be careful of
(your duty to) Allah; and you concealed in your soul what Allah would
bring to light, and you feared men, and Allah had a greater right that
you should fear Him. But when Zaid had accomplished his want of her,
We gave have her to you as a wife, so that there should be no
difficulty for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted
sons, when they have accomplished their want of them; and Allah’s
command shall be fulfilled..)  (33:37)
2. Political reasons and for the sake of Da'wah, and to invite people
to Islam, and to gain the favor of the Arab tribes: The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah exalt his mention, married women from the largest and
strongest Arab tribes. The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention,
ordered his Companions, with whom Allah is pleased, to do this as
well. The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, said to Abdurrahmaan
b. Auf, with whom Allah is pleased:
'If they obey you (i.e. accept Islam) then marry the daughter of the
head of the tribe.'
Dr. Cahan said: 'Some of the aspects of his life may seem confusing to
us due to present day mentality. The Messenger is criticized due to
his obsession of attaining worldly desires and his nine wives, whom he
married after the death of his wife Khadeejah, with whom Allah is
pleased. It has been confirmed that most of these marriages were for
political reasons, which were aimed to gain loyalty of some nobles,
and tribes.'
3. Social reasons: The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, married
some of his Companions’ wives who had died, in Jihad or while giving
Da'wah. He married them even though they were older than him, and he
did so to honor them and their husbands.
Veccia Vaglieri in her book 'In Defense of Islam' said: 'Throughout
the years of his youth, Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, only
married one woman, even though the sexuality of man is at its peak
during this period. Although he lived in the society he lived in,
wherein plural marriage was considered the general rule, and divorce
was very easy - he only married one woman, although she was older than
him. He was a faithful husband to her for twenty-five years, and did
not marry another woman, except after her death. He at that time was
fifty years old. He married each of his wives thereafter for a social,
or political purpose; such that he wanted to honor the pious women, or
wanted the loyalty of certain tribes so that Islam would spread
amongst them. All the wives Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention,
married were not virgin, nor were they young or beautiful; except for
A'ishah, with whom Allah is pleased. So how can anyone claim that he
was a lustful man? He was a man not a god. His wish to have a son may
have also lead him to marry; for the children that he had from
Khadeejah all died. Moreover, who undertook the financial
responsibilities of his large family, without having large resources.
He was just and fair towards them all and did not differentiate
between them at all. He followed the practice of previous Prophets
such as Musa, whom no one objected to their plural marriage. Is the
reason why people object to the plural marriage of Muhammad, may Allah
exalt his mention, the fact that we know the minute details of his
life, and know so little of the details of the lives of the Prophets
before him?
Thomas Carlyle said: 'Mahomet himself, after all that can be said
about him, was not a sensual man. We shall err widely if we consider
this man as a common voluptuary, intent mainly on base enjoyments,--
nay on enjoyments of any kind.'

Textual Proofs which support the Prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah
exalt his mention:
Proofs from the Qur'an:
1. Allah, the Exalted, says:
(Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the
Messenger of Allah, and the last of the Prophets: and Allah has full
knowledge of all things.) (33:40)
2. Eesa, may Allah exalt his mention, gave the glad tidings of Prophet
Muhammad in the Gospel. Allah, the Exalted, says:
(And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: "O Children of Israel! I
am the Messenger of Allah (sent) to you, confirming the Law (which
came) before me, and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after
me, whose name shall be Ahmad." But when he came to them with Clear
Signs they said, 'This is evident sorcery!')  (61:6)

Proofs from the Sunnah:
The Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, said:
'My example and the example of the Prophets before me is like a man
who built a house, which he built and perfected except for the space
of one block; people would go round the house and stare in awe at its
perfection and say, 'had it not been for this space!' The Prophet, may
Allah exalt his mention, said: 'I am that brick, I am the last of
Prophets.'  (Bukhari #3342)

Previous Scriptures:
Ataa' b. Yasaar, with whom Allah is pleased, said: 'I met Abdullah b.
Amr b. al-Aas, with whom Allah is pleased, and I asked him:
'Tell me about the description of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
exalt his mention, in the Torah.' He said: 'He is described in the
Torah with some of what he is described in the Qur'an; 'We have indeed
sent you as a witness (over mankind) and one who gives glad-tidings,
and warns others, and one who protects and safeguards the commoners.
You are My slave and Messenger; I called you Mutawakkil (The Trusted
One). You are neither ill-mannered nor rude, nor do you raise your
voice. You do not pay evil with evil; rather, you forgive and pardon.
I will not collect his soul until I guide the nations, and until they
say, 'There is no true god worthy of being worshipped except Allah
alone' and until they clearly see the Truth.'
Ata, with whom Allah is pleased, said: I met Ka'b, the Rabbi, and
asked him about this narration, and he did not differ with Abdullah b.
Amr b. Al-Aas, with whom Allah is pleased, except for a minor
difference in the wording of the narration.'  (Baihaqi #13079)
Abdul-Ahad Dawud, said: 'but I have tried to base my arguments on
portions of the Bible which hardly allow of any linguistic dispute. I
would not go to Latin, Greek, or Aramaic, for that would be useless: I
just give the following quotation in the very words of the Revised
Version as published by the British and Foreign Bible Society.
We read the following words in the Book of Deuteronomy chapter xviii.
verse 18: "I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren,
like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth." If these words
do not apply to Prophet Muhammad, they still remain unfulfilled.
Prophet Jesus himself never claimed to be the Prophet alluded to. Even
his disciples were of the same opinion: they looked to the second
coming of Jesus for the fulfillment of the prophecy. So far it is
undisputed that the first coming of Jesus was not the advent of the
"prophet like unto thee," and his second advent can hardly fulfill the
words. Jesus, as is believed by his Church, will appear as a Judge and
not as a law-giver; but the promised one has to come with a "fiery
law" in "his right hand."
In ascertaining the personality of the promised prophet the other
prophecy of Moses is, however, very helpful where it speaks of the
shining forth of God from Paran, the mountain of Mecca. The words in
the Book of Deuteronomy, chapter xxxiii. verse 2, run as follows: "The
Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth
from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints; from his
right hand went a fiery law for them."
In these words the Lord has been compared with the sun. He comes from
Sinai, he rises from Seir, but he shines in his full glory from Paran,
where he had to appear with ten thousands of saints with a fiery law
in his right hand. None of the Israelites, including Jesus, had
anything to do with Paran. Hagar, with her son Ishmael, wandered in
the wilderness of Beersheba, who afterwards dwelt in the wilderness of
Paran (Gen. xxi. 21). He married an Egyptian woman, and through his
first-born, Kedar, gave descent to the Arabs who from that time till
now are the dwellers of the wilderness of Paran. And if Prophet
Muhammad admittedly on all hands traces his descent to Ishmael through
Kedar and he appeared as a prophet in the wilderness of Paran and
reentered Mecca with ten thousand saints and gave a fiery law to his
people, is not the prophecy above-mentioned fulfilled to its very
letter?
The words of the prophecy in Habakkuk are especially noteworthy. His
(the Holy One from Paran) glory covered the heavens and the earth was
full of his praise. The word "praise" is very significant, as the very
name Muhammad literally means "the praised one." Besides the Arabs,
the inhabitants of the wilderness of Paran had also been promised a
Revelation: "Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their
voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of
the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. Let them
give glory unto the Lord, and declare His praise in the islands. The
Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a
man of war, he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his
enemies" (Isaiah).
In connection with it there are two other prophecies worthy of note
where references have been made to Kedar. The one runs thus in chapter
1x. of Isaiah: "Arise, shine for thy light is come, and the glory of
the Lord is risen upon thee ... The multitude of camels shall cover
thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall
come.. All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee,
the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with
acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my
glory" (1-7). The other prophecy is again in Isaiah "The burden upon
Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling
companies of Dedanim. The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought
water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him
that fled. For they fled from the swords and from the bent bow, and
from the grievousness of war. For thus hath the Lord said unto me,
Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the
glory of Kedar shall fail: And the residue of the number of archers,
the mighty of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished" Read these
prophecies in Isaiah in the light of one in Deuteronomy which speaks
of the shining forth of God from Paran.
If Ishmael inhabited the wilderness of Paran, where he gave birth to
Kedar, who is the ancestor of the Arabs; and if the sons of Kedar had
to receive revelation from God; if the flocks of Kedar had to come up
with acceptance to a Divine altar to glorify "the house of my glory"
where the darkness had to cover the earth for some centuries, and then
that very land had to receive light from God; and if all the glory of
Kedar had to fail and the number of archers, the mighty men of the
children of Kedar, had to diminish within a year after the one fled
from the swords and from the bent bows - the Holy One from Paran
(Habakkuk iii 3 ) is no one else than Prophet Muhammad. Prophet
Muhammad is the holy offspring of Ishmael through Kedar, who settled
in the wilderness of Paran. Muhammad is the only Prophet through whom
the Arabs received revelation at the time when the darkness
