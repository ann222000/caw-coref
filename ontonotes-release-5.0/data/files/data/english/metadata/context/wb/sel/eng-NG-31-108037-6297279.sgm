Here's some old chats with Lord British I downloaded off CompuServe back
in 1996 or so.  I am afraid they are not archived anywhere else.  The
cover the period 1984-1994, and you can hear Lord British answer
important questions concerning the Amiga memory usage of ports, as well
as scaring everyone by saying that U8 will require 50 MHz 486 with 32 MB
of RAM.

He also discusses some of the most important releases in the series,
including Ultima IV Part 2 and the famous 1991 Multiplayer Ultima.

However, I found this quote the most interesting:

There are about 10 Ultima 6 contest winners in Ultima 7...
Some of them are...
a girl named "Wench" (in the game, of couse)...
a boy and his dog, who both made it in...
a self-proclaimed Hermit...
and even an infant, but their names elude us right now. GA
