I'm curious about Monism, in particular I'm interested to know how far our
resident Monists take their idea and why.

On the one hand, absolute physicalism is something I think I could, more or
less, accept. Darwinism affirms that the evolution of organic things
operates according to a single cohesive set of mechanisms. We know this; we
can watch it happen. The social behaviour of a species is also controlled by
physical genetic make up. By way of a basic example, imagine the behaviour
of a male human-being with extremely low (or even extremely high)
testosterone. I have no problem with the tent &quot;the mind is what the brain
does&quot;. I'm on your team, but I draw the line here.

My suspicion is that Monism is something a little more fanciful for some of
our members; a little more like theistic wish-thinking. In particular, I
wonder if they might be misusing some pretty solid scientific truths to
justify more mystical ideas about &quot;God&quot;?

Am I right? I'm not trying to &quot;out&quot; theists here, I'm just curious about how
far beyond the line of rationalism they take the idea.

My 'theory', if you will, uses string theory to prove the
possibility and likelihood of monism, in that it solves the EPR effect
(and no other theory currently does) and it lends a bit of credence as
to why C is a constant.  If, as I hypothesise, that all the strings
are joined in the Calabi-Yau space, then the universe IS monistic in
that all energy stems from one 10-dimensional object comprised of
stringy energy.  From my point of view, the realisation of monism came
AFTER I tried to solve the EPR effect.  Once I had made the
realisation that, if the strings were joined and the 'reality' was a
10-dimensional object of stringy energy, I THEN realised that:
1) that object exists everywhere that energy exists throughout all
time and space, and, therefore, it was omnipresent.
2) that object is the only actor in the system, performing EVERY
act performed by energy, therefore, it was omnipotent.
3) irrespective of HOW consciousness actually works (and, although
I believe I have SOME idea, I do not profess to have the intricate
details about it that would allow us to make better use of
it...perhaps in time), if there is only one actor in the system, then
all consciousness is, in effect, an aspect of that one object,
therefore, that object is the ultimate and only 'knower' in the system
and, therefore, it is omniscient.

Once I had realised that the object fit the classical description
of deity (omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent), without any moral
bias (i.e., I do not find that object to be omnibenevolent, as it
perform ALL actions, including any we may perceive to be evil), I
realised that the universe could well be monistic and, I have found no
evidence whatsoever to be in conflict with my theory.  The God that my
theory describes is completely consistent with scriptural accounts of
Brahman and I have found no physical or scriptural evidence to even
hint that there is a discrepancy between Brahman and the 10-
dimensional object of stringy energy that forms the monad of my
theory.  So what other conclusion could a rational man come to?
As my theory is technically bound to string theory, I, of course,
have to accept that it cannot be proven empirically yet.  But I don't
believe that should necessarily prevent anyone from accepting it as a
perfectly valid possibility.  And, as my theory solves ther EPR effect
in a rather elegant fashion (and elegance seems to be a recurring
theme repeatedly discovered and verified by science), I believe that
makes it more likely than other theories that do not solve that
problem.  There is no other 'Theory of Everything' that unites all
forces into one force AND unites all action to one actor.  It is the
ultimate TOE, as it resolves everything into one thing.
The concept of God, as defined by omnipresence, omnipotence and
omniscience, came from looking at the science without prejudice
AGAINST such a concept.  If your science is designed to give rational
(and by rational, I mean to imply that 'GOD' can NEVER be a scientific
result, as this is the current view of the so-called 'scientific'
community) results, then your science is designed to offer solutions
that are opposed to (i.e., offered as an alternative to) God.  Whereas
my scientific approach had no such anti-deity prejudice.  If I'm right
about the joining of strings, then 'that which is' can be described as
fitting the classical definition of deity (the 3 Os) and that deity is
amoral (not immoral!).  The theory seems to piss off both scientific
(due to it being empirically unprovable) AND religious communities
(well, certainly those that hold that God is omnibenevolent), which
makes me think it's even MORE likely to be true.
If you look at the data with a prejudice against God, you will
never see it; however, if you throw off that prejudice, the concept
pervades quite naturally.  There was a time when I was atheist.  That
is to say, I didn't believe that there was such a thing as God,
although I realised intellectually that the concept could not be
currently disproven and, therefore, had to remain as a possibility.
String theory allows for such a possibility and it doesn't need to
stretch beyond physics to get there.  It only requires considered
thought without prejudice.
Hope that helps you understand how far beyond rationalism I've
gone.  I don't think I've gone beyond the truly rational at all; I
just never approached rationalism with a specific prejudice against
deity, as I always knew that the concept is still within the
scientific realms of 'not provable and not unprovable' and, therefore,
must remain a possibility to be truly fair to the data.

Okay, Pat, taking one thing at a time.

It seems to me that you have approached the whole thing with a very peculiar
prejudice; in particular you have chosen to go with a &quot;classical
description&quot; of God. Why is this particular unverifiable idea given value --
and overriding value! -- in your quest for truth? Because lots of people
believed it? Because, at least culturally, you were exposed to the idea and
therefore it sort of &quot;fits&quot;? I think, right here, you have crossed the line
of rationalism in deciding upon a particular concept of God; or even on God
at all.

I also think you're ascribing your own motives to science that aren't
science's. Of course science must start out to disprove God; that's how
science works. Develop a theory, then try and prove the thing wrong.
Endlessly. With extreme prejudice. There can be nothing special about &quot;God&quot;
that should require special dispensations from science. It doesn't work like
that. There has to be prejudice against all theories. Very strong prejudice.

Hence I think you saying: &quot;If your science is designed to give rational
results, then your science is designed to offer solutions that are opposed
to (i.e., offered as an alternative to) God. Whereas my scientific approach
had no such anti-deity prejudice&quot;, kind of proves you can neither claim
science or rationalism as an ally (much less the basis for your theory). If
you don't like what science tells you because its results are rational, then
tough! Think of all the spurious other things we could claim science
supports if we proceeded to manipulate how it works.

Again, though, it worked the other way around.  When I realised that
the 10-dimensional object was omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient,
THEN, I called it God.  What would you call an object that is
omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient if you had no bias AGAINST
God?  Remember that I was atheist.  I didn't believe that God existed
and THEN I was presented with a description of the universe as
omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient.  I wasn't looking for God, I
was looking for a way to solve the EPR effect.  God sort of just fell
out of the envelope.  I'll say it again: If I'm right about the
strings joining, then the universe IS God.  And that God works
perfectly according to 'the laws of physics' and not according to 'the
laws of physics as we know them'.  It is amoral.  It is congruent with
the Hindu concept of Brahman and Advaita Vedanta.  It is congruent
with the Tao.  It is congruent with Ibn al-Arabi's interpretation of
the Qur'an's Allah.  It is congruent with Spinoza's God.  It is
congruent with Maimonides.  Why do you suppose that is?  I think it's
because they were all on the right track, just coming from the other
direction.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No.  That's the rub of prejudice.  Science is about discovering how
things are.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

I agree, however mankind is not currently technologically capable of
proving or disproving string theory.  So, that's out of my hands and
is, therefore, not a problem I can attack.  The mathematics behind
string theory is provable, so we know that it is a valid possibility.
Solving the EPR effect through manipulation of the Calabi-Yau geometry
makes my version of string theory a more likely prospect, as it solves
a fundamental problem without changing the rules.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Endlessly. With extreme prejudice.
">

How can you say that science must have extreme prejudice?
Prejudice is specifically antiscientific, as prejudice is bias.  Good
science does not come with a built in bias.  Without prejudice is
fairer to truth.  The prejudice against one thing prevents you from
EVER seeing it as a possible truth, yet you know (as I do) that God is
not disprovable by science.  Yet you still hold your prejudice.
Remember, when we let prejudice into law, we get things like Dred
Scott, where people are legally chattel and when we let prejudice into
science, we get things like an institutionalised religious community
of atheists blinded by their science, which has turned into the art of
making 'Not God'.  Good science is not a biased art of deception, is
it?  Well, mine isn't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;There can be nothing special about &quot;God&quot;
&gt; that should require special dispensations from science. It doesn't work like
&gt; that.
">

That's right, which means that, if it hasn't been disproven (and God
has not been), then it must remain a possibility.  And not thrown off
at the beginning because you feel it can't be right.  That's bias and
not science.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;There has to be prejudice against all theories. Very strong prejudice.
">

No, there has to be evidence to stand behind a prejudice, and you have
(i.e., there is) no evidence to support the theory that &quot;there is no
God&quot;.  Lack of evidence cannot be logically used to support anything.
I present evidence that the 10-dimensional object of stringy energy is
omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient.  Call it what you like.  Call
it Tendose (that's 10-Dimensional Object of Stringy Energy), it's
still omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient.  And, if you were to
look up those three words to 'discover' what there is that is
described that way, you'll find the word God used quite a bit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Hence I think you saying: &quot;If your science is designed to give rational
&gt; results, then your science is designed to offer solutions that are opposed

So, as one of the scientists who hold a bias against God, it irks you
that it can be seen as rational.  I can live with that.  If you hold
that rational implies godlessness, then you only prove your bias.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If
&gt; you don't like what science tells you because its results are rational, then
&gt; tough!
">

I agree.  However if you think that rational implies godless then
you've added a religious (or, more properly, an anti-religious) bent
to your science and it is not completely rational, which I take to
mean balanced reasoning that objectively views the data without
prejudice.  If your science has, built into it, a dogmatic belief
that, irrespective of the facts, God cannot be a valid result, your
science is skewed. Simple as.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Think of all the spurious other things we could claim science

Spurious is as spurious does.  Science has the spurious belief that
God can not be a valid result when it knows that it cannot disprove
it.  That is completely illogical.  If A cannot be disproven, then A
must remain a valid possibility, otherwise you're practicing a
religious avoidance of a possible truth making your science bend away
from a straight and fair path.

Pat,

Have I got this right?

[1] You believe that you have established logical proof that the universe is
omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient. I don't think you can call it
&quot;scientific proof&quot;, but I accept, for the moment, that you think it might be
logically or mathematically possible according to string theory. And, of
course, it cannot be disproved.

[2] You have embraced some superstitious or supernatural ideas because they
are not in conflict with your first premise. Or, maybe more than that: you
believe that the prophet, ju-ju man, or whoever, who came up with the ideas
were somehow divinely inspired toward &quot;truth&quot;? In a sense, they arrived at
the same profound truth by some &quot;other&quot; means?

And therefore God exists?

xxxianxx

&gt; &gt; Okay, Pat, taking one thing at a time.

&gt; &gt; It seems to me that you have approached the whole thing with a very
&gt; peculiar
&gt; &gt; prejudice; in particular you have chosen to go with a &quot;classical
&gt; &gt; description&quot; of God. Why is this particular unverifiable idea given
&gt; value --
&gt; &gt; and overriding value! -- in your quest for truth? Because lots of people
&gt; &gt; believed it? Because, at least culturally, you were exposed to the idea
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; therefore it sort of &quot;fits&quot;? I think, right here, you have crossed the
&gt; line
&gt; &gt; of rationalism in deciding upon a particular concept of God; or even on
&gt; God
&gt; &gt; at all.

&gt; Again, though, it worked the other way around.  When I realised that
&gt; the 10-dimensional object was omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient,
&gt; THEN, I called it God.  What would you call an object that is
&gt; omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient if you had no bias AGAINST
&gt; God?  Remember that I was atheist.  I didn't believe that God existed
&gt; and THEN I was presented with a description of the universe as
&gt; omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient.  I wasn't looking for God, I
&gt; was looking for a way to solve the EPR effect.  God sort of just fell
&gt; out of the envelope.  I'll say it again: If I'm right about the
&gt; strings joining, then the universe IS God.  And that God works
&gt; perfectly according to 'the laws of physics' and not according to 'the
&gt; laws of physics as we know them'.  It is amoral.  It is congruent with
&gt; the Hindu concept of Brahman and Advaita Vedanta.  It is congruent
&gt; with the Tao.  It is congruent with Ibn al-Arabi's interpretation of
&gt; the Qur'an's Allah.  It is congruent with Spinoza's God.  It is
&gt; congruent with Maimonides.  Why do you suppose that is?  I think it's
&gt; because they were all on the right track, just coming from the other
&gt; direction.

&gt; &gt; I also think you're ascribing your own motives to science that aren't
&gt; &gt; science's. Of course science must start out to disprove God; that's how
&gt; &gt; science works.

&gt; No.  That's the rub of prejudice.  Science is about discovering how
&gt; things are.

&gt; &gt;Develop a theory, then try and prove the thing wrong.

&gt; I agree, however mankind is not currently technologically capable of
&gt; proving or disproving string theory.  So, that's out of my hands and
&gt; is, therefore, not a problem I can attack.  The mathematics behind
&gt; string theory is provable, so we know that it is a valid possibility.
&gt; Solving the EPR effect through manipulation of the Calabi-Yau geometry
&gt; makes my version of string theory a more likely prospect, as it solves
&gt; a fundamental problem without changing the rules.

&gt; &gt; Endlessly. With extreme prejudice.

&gt;      How can you say that science must have extreme prejudice?
&gt; Prejudice is specifically antiscientific, as prejudice is bias.  Good
&gt; science does not come with a built in bias.  Without prejudice is
&gt; fairer to truth.  The prejudice against one thing prevents you from
&gt; EVER seeing it as a possible truth, yet you know (as I do) that God is
&gt; not disprovable by science.  Yet you still hold your prejudice.
&gt; Remember, when we let prejudice into law, we get things like Dred
&gt; Scott, where people are legally chattel and when we let prejudice into
&gt; science, we get things like an institutionalised religious community
&gt; of atheists blinded by their science, which has turned into the art of
&gt; making 'Not God'.  Good science is not a biased art of deception, is
&gt; it?  Well, mine isn't.

&gt; &gt;There can be nothing special about &quot;God&quot;
&gt; &gt; that should require special dispensations from science. It doesn't work
&gt; like
&gt; &gt; that.

&gt; That's right, which means that, if it hasn't been disproven (and God
&gt; has not been), then it must remain a possibility.  And not thrown off
&gt; at the beginning because you feel it can't be right.  That's bias and
&gt; not science.

&gt; &gt;There has to be prejudice against all theories. Very strong prejudice.

&gt; No, there has to be evidence to stand behind a prejudice, and you have
&gt; (i.e., there is) no evidence to support the theory that &quot;there is no
&gt; God&quot;.  Lack of evidence cannot be logically used to support anything.
&gt; I present evidence that the 10-dimensional object of stringy energy is
&gt; omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient.  Call it what you like.  Call
&gt; it Tendose (that's 10-Dimensional Object of Stringy Energy), it's
&gt; still omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient.  And, if you were to
&gt; look up those three words to 'discover' what there is that is
&gt; described that way, you'll find the word God used quite a bit.

&gt; &gt; Hence I think you saying: &quot;If your science is designed to give rational
&gt; &gt; results, then your science is designed to offer solutions that are
&gt; opposed
&gt; &gt; to (i.e., offered as an alternative to) God. Whereas my scientific
&gt; approach
&gt; &gt; had no such anti-deity prejudice&quot;, kind of proves you can neither claim
&gt; &gt; science or rationalism as an ally (much less the basis for your theory).

&gt; So, as one of the scientists who hold a bias against God, it irks you
&gt; that it can be seen as rational.  I can live with that.  If you hold
&gt; that rational implies godlessness, then you only prove your bias.

&gt; &gt;If
&gt; &gt; you don't like what science tells you because its results are rational,
&gt; then
&gt; &gt; tough!

&gt; I agree.  However if you think that rational implies godless then
&gt; you've added a religious (or, more properly, an anti-religious) bent
&gt; to your science and it is not completely rational, which I take to
&gt; mean balanced reasoning that objectively views the data without
&gt; prejudice.  If your science has, built into it, a dogmatic belief
&gt; that, irrespective of the facts, God cannot be a valid result, your
&gt; science is skewed. Simple as.

&gt; &gt;Think of all the spurious other things we could claim science
&gt; &gt; supports if we proceeded to manipulate how it works.

&gt;    Spurious is as spurious does.  Science has the spurious belief that
&gt; God can not be a valid result when it knows that it cannot disprove
&gt; it.  That is completely illogical.  If A cannot be disproven, then A
&gt; must remain a valid possibility, otherwise you're practicing a
&gt; religious avoidance of a possible truth making your science bend away

To clarify, what I am saying is that science operates from the basis of a
single prejudice -- basically that all of its experiments set out to prove a
theory wrong. That's all I meant. Of course science doesn't care one way or
another about the out come.

God is older than science, so the theory says. By proving its own
existance (that's you, Lee ;-)), science therfore proves God. How do
you like that?

Heh I love your choice of words here Ian.   I have to ask though from
where does this fervent dislike for all that is religious stem from?
It is akin, in it's intensity, to that of of a theist defending his
belief.

I just find it odd in a man who holds such a disdain for
irrationality, that I witness just such seemingly irrational behavior!

As to the original question though, do you distinguish between
differing type of Monist then?  Is for example Pat with his string
theory, any different from the scientist looking for the one all
defining rule of everything?

It is part of my pysche that people are differant all over the world,
and that we should 'live and let live' and celebrate these
differances, so it goads me somewhat to witness what is almost hate
speech, from anybody to anybody else, hence Ian the nature of my reply
to you.

We all get that you don't do God, but why the constant (in the
language you use) belittling of those that do, do you really look down
upon us so?

Hi Lee,

If the words you are referring to are &quot;superstitious&quot;, &quot;supernatural&quot;,
&quot;prophet&quot;, &quot;ju-ju man&quot;, et al; then what is your point? These are all
perfectly accurate descriptions. For example, Pat mentioned that, in
deciding upon a concept of God for his theory, that he referenced Hinduism.
Hinduism, by absolute definition is both supernatural and superstitious. It
is a religion. Also, gurus are prophets, and a prophet by another name is a
ju-ju man. What do you have against West African wise men? That sounds like
religious hatred to me, Lee. How dare I taint the names of your blessed
gurus by calling them ju-ju men! :)

You don't like these words, but that is because they serve as an unwelcome
reminder of how far beyond rationalism you have allowed your mind to wander.
They are accurate; you are a superstitious man. Sikhism is full of rituals
and practices. None of this questioning of your rationalism implies anything
about your intelligence (which I respect), so please do not take offence.

I don't have a fervent dislike for religion. No way. I have a distrust of
religion's so-called &quot;truths&quot;, and also of its motives and the motives of
those who choose to believe. This distrust is based upon self-evident
truths: the spurious and inconsistent nature of scripture, the concept of
faith, the absence of tangible evidence for its claims, and the cult-like
operations of many religions. Also there's perfect demonstrations in this
very group of strong psychological predispositions toward mysticism. Whilst
you might like fairies, Pat likes to conflate science with mysticism; it's
all different manifestations of the same appetite of wonder: the same kind
of wish-thinking.

I'm quite shocked that you call what I have said &quot;hate speech&quot;. I respect
your right to believe in whatever you like, but if you're going to come to
the table with an idea and try and palm it off as rational, then expect that
idea to be attacked in the strongest possible terms. If you're feeling
yourself getting precious about that idea, then there's your warning sign
that you have abandoned rationalism.

It's not that I don't &quot;do God&quot;. God has nothing to do with it, really. We
could be talking about ghosts, telekinesis, the Secret, freemasonry, or
alternative medicine. What I value is rationalism and science, and I think
it's worthwhile pointing out when people abuse these concepts to justify or
add weight to superstitious ideas as well as the great unknowable (is there
a God?).

I'm interest in Monism and how far people take the idea. Like I said, I
think I can get behind physicalism. That's not too much of stretch for me.
However, I was curious about the basis for people taking this further -- as
far as deification. I suppose I knew already that something dubious like
string theory was involved with Pat's form of Monism, but that doesn't mean
I'm not interested to learn more and have a bit of back-and-forth about it.

Hey Ian,

Let me perhaps be a little clearer, the words you use and the way in
which you use them, and the tone which they convey seem to me(and I
guess to some others also) to indicate a snobishness, they convey to
me a sense of superiority that you feel over those who practice
superstiousness, and I'm am also willing to bet you write in such a
manner on purpose.

Heh you and I have had at this before, and each time you pull the
'what, what did I say?' card.  Suffice to say, if you are going to
insult people(and you know as well as I do that belittleing somebodies
faith is insulting them) then at least have the 'bottle'(English slang
for bravery) to stand by your words and not pretend to know not what
you have done.

My only point in my post was to point out to you, how you come
across.  Hah Like I undoubtedly come across as a raving 'sensitive
soul' by engaging in this toing-and-throwing.

However!

Rationality vs irrationality.

What makes you so certain that irrationality has no place in our
minds?  Why must you look down on those who freely choose to open up
to the irrationality in life?  Or what data do you posses that has
shaped this dislike for irrationality, and that rational thought is
the only way for us?

&gt; Pat,

&gt; Have I got this right?

&gt; [1] You believe that you have established logical proof that the universe is
&gt; omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient. I don't think you can call it
&gt; &quot;scientific proof&quot;, but I accept, for the moment, that you think it might be
&gt; logically or mathematically possible according to string theory. And, of
&gt; course, it cannot be disproved.

If the strings are joined as I think they are, then I have
established, logically, that the one object is omnipresent, omnipotent
and omniscient.  And, yes, I agree that I cannot call it a scientific
proof, as there is no empirical evidence to back it up due to our
technology.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; [2] You have embraced some superstitious or supernatural ideas because they
&gt; are not in conflict with your first premise. Or, maybe more than that: you
&gt; believe that the prophet, ju-ju man, or whoever, who came up with the ideas
&gt; were somehow divinely inspired toward &quot;truth&quot;? In a sense, they arrived at
&gt; the same profound truth by some &quot;other&quot; means?
">

What is superstitious about a universe that follows the laws of
physics?  If something happens in this universe, then there are laws
to explain it.  We, as a species, don't have ALL the answers yet.  And
that doesn't mean that events outside our understanding are
supernatural, it just means they are outside our current
understanding.  These others that I mentioned have all come up with
descriptions of God based on first accepting that God exists and THAT
is coming at it from the other direction.  I came up with a
description of the universe that matches their description of God,
when I wasn't TRYING to describe God.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And therefore God exists?
">

No, God must remain as a possibility, and, moreover, it should be
viewed as being likely, given my geometric topology of the Calabi-Yau
space.  But I would NOT say that 'therefore God exists', as I have no
empirical proof.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, Pat, taking one thing at a time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that you have approached the whole thing with a very
&gt; &gt; peculiar
&gt; &gt; &gt; prejudice; in particular you have chosen to go with a &quot;classical
&gt; &gt; &gt; description&quot; of God. Why is this particular unverifiable idea given
&gt; &gt; value --
&gt; &gt; &gt; and overriding value! -- in your quest for truth? Because lots of people
&gt; &gt; &gt; believed it? Because, at least culturally, you were exposed to the idea
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; therefore it sort of &quot;fits&quot;? I think, right here, you have crossed the
&gt; &gt; line
&gt; &gt; &gt; of rationalism in deciding upon a particular concept of God; or even on
&gt; &gt; God
&gt; &gt; &gt; at all.

&gt; &gt; Again, though, it worked the other way around.  When I realised that
&gt; &gt; the 10-dimensional object was omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient,
&gt; &gt; THEN, I called it God.  What would you call an object that is
&gt; &gt; omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient if you had no bias AGAINST
&gt; &gt; God?  Remember that I was atheist.  I didn't believe that God existed
&gt; &gt; and THEN I was presented with a description of the universe as
&gt; &gt; omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient.  I wasn't looking for God, I
&gt; &gt; was looking for a way to solve the EPR effect.  God sort of just fell
&gt; &gt; out of the envelope.  I'll say it again: If I'm right about the
&gt; &gt; strings joining, then the universe IS God.  And that God works
&gt; &gt; perfectly according to 'the laws of physics' and not according to 'the
&gt; &gt; laws of physics as we know them'.  It is amoral.  It is congruent with
&gt; &gt; the Hindu concept of Brahman and Advaita Vedanta.  It is congruent
&gt; &gt; with the Tao.  It is congruent with Ibn al-Arabi's interpretation of
&gt; &gt; the Qur'an's Allah.  It is congruent with Spinoza's God.  It is
&gt; &gt; congruent with Maimonides.  Why do you suppose that is?  I think it's
&gt; &gt; because they were all on the right track, just coming from the other
&gt; &gt; direction.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I also think you're ascribing your own motives to science that aren't
&gt; &gt; &gt; science's. Of course science must start out to disprove God; that's how
&gt; &gt; &gt; science works.

&gt; &gt; No.  That's the rub of prejudice.  Science is about discovering how
&gt; &gt; things are.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Develop a theory, then try and prove the thing wrong.

&gt; &gt; I agree, however mankind is not currently technologically capable of
&gt; &gt; proving or disproving string theory.  So, that's out of my hands and
&gt; &gt; is, therefore, not a problem I can attack.  The mathematics behind
&gt; &gt; string theory is provable, so we know that it is a valid possibility.
&gt; &gt; Solving the EPR effect through manipulation of the Calabi-Yau geometry
&gt; &gt; makes my version of string theory a more likely prospect, as it solves
&gt; &gt; a fundamental problem without changing the rules.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Endlessly. With extreme prejudice.

&gt; &gt;      How can you say that science must have extreme prejudice?
&gt; &gt; Prejudice is specifically antiscientific, as prejudice is bias.  Good
&gt; &gt; science does not come with a built in bias.  Without prejudice is
&gt; &gt; fairer to truth.  The prejudice against one thing prevents you from
&gt; &gt; EVER seeing it as a possible truth, yet you know (as I do) that God is
&gt; &gt; not disprovable by science.  Yet you still hold your prejudice.
&gt; &gt; Remember, when we let prejudice into law, we get things like Dred
&gt; &gt; Scott, where people are legally chattel and when we let prejudice into
&gt; &gt; science, we get things like an institutionalised religious community
&gt; &gt; of atheists blinded by their science, which has turned into the art of
&gt; &gt; making 'Not God'.  Good science is not a biased art of deception, is
&gt; &gt; it?  Well, mine isn't.

&gt; &gt; &gt;There can be nothing special about &quot;God&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; that should require special dispensations from science. It doesn't work
&gt; &gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; that.

&gt; &gt; That's right, which means that, if it hasn't been disproven (and God
&gt; &gt; has not been), then it must remain a possibility.  And not thrown off
&gt; &gt; at the beginning because you feel it can't be right.  That's bias and
&gt; &gt; not science.

&gt; &gt; &gt;There has to be prejudice against all theories. Very strong prejudice.

&gt; &gt; No, there has to be evidence to stand behind a prejudice, and you have
&gt; &gt; (i.e., there is) no evidence to support the theory that &quot;there is no
&gt; &gt; God&quot;.  Lack of evidence cannot be logically used to support anything.
&gt; &gt; I present evidence that the 10-dimensional object of stringy energy is
&gt; &gt; omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient.  Call it what you like.  Call
&gt; &gt; it Tendose (that's 10-Dimensional Object of Stringy Energy), it's
&gt; &gt; still omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient.  And, if you were to
&gt; &gt; look up those three words to 'discover' what there is that is
&gt; &gt; described that way, you'll find the word God used quite a bit.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hence I think you saying: &quot;If your science is designed to give rational
&gt; &gt; &gt; results, then your science is designed to offer solutions that are
&gt; &gt; opposed
&gt; &gt; &gt; to (i.e., offered as an alternative to) God. Whereas my scientific
&gt; &gt; approach
&gt; &gt; &gt; had no such anti-deity prejudice&quot;, kind of proves you can neither claim
&gt; &gt; &gt; science or rationalism as an ally (much less the basis for your theory).

&gt; &gt; So, as one of the scientists who hold a bias against God, it irks you
&gt; &gt; that it can be seen as rational.  I can live with that.  If you hold
&gt; &gt; that rational implies godlessness, then you only prove your bias.

&gt; &gt; &gt;If
&gt; &gt; &gt; you don't like what science tells you because its results are rational,
&gt; &gt; then
&gt; &gt; &gt; tough!

&gt; &gt; I agree.  However if you think that rational implies godless then
&gt; &gt; you've added a religious (or, more properly, an anti-religious) bent
&gt; &gt; to your science and it is not completely rational, which I take to
&gt; &gt; mean balanced reasoning that objectively views the data without
&gt; &gt; prejudice.  If your science has, built into it, a dogmatic belief
&gt; &gt; that, irrespective of the facts, God cannot be a valid result, your
&gt; &gt; science is skewed. Simple as.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Think of all the spurious other things we could claim science
&gt; &gt; &gt; supports if we proceeded to manipulate how it works.

&gt; &gt;    Spurious is as spurious does.  Science has the spurious belief that
&gt; &gt; God can not be a valid result when it knows that it cannot disprove
&gt; &gt; it.  That is completely illogical.  If A cannot be disproven, then A
&gt; &gt; must remain a valid possibility, otherwise you're practicing a
&gt; &gt; religious avoidance of a possible truth making your science bend away
&gt; &gt; from a straight and fair path.

towards the concept of God, but that's due to the overriding concept

&gt; Hi Lee,

&gt; If the words you are referring to are &quot;superstitious&quot;, &quot;supernatural&quot;,
&gt; &quot;prophet&quot;, &quot;ju-ju man&quot;, et al; then what is your point? These are all

&gt; Hinduism, by absolute definition is both supernatural and superstitious.

Coming from one who has not really studied it, one might come to that
conclusion.  But, to be fair, when the Vedas were written some 4000+
years ago, mankind's general scientific background was pretty sparse,

relegating to the laws of physics.

So do I.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;This distrust is based upon self-evident
&gt; truths: the spurious and inconsistent nature of scripture, the concept of
&gt; faith, the absence of tangible evidence for its claims, and the cult-like
&gt; operations of many religions. Also there's perfect demonstrations in this
&gt; very group of strong psychological predispositions toward mysticism. Whilst
&gt; you might like fairies, Pat likes to conflate science with mysticism; it's
&gt; all different manifestations of the same appetite of wonder: the same kind

Except that I wasn't wishing FOR it.  I don't 'like' to conflate
science with mysticism, I like to find where the same phenomena are

disrespect the religious view and so that religion can no longer hide

&gt; idea to be attacked in the strongest possible terms. If you're feeling
&gt; yourself getting precious about that idea, then there's your warning sign
&gt; that you have abandoned rationalism.

&gt; It's not that I don't &quot;do God&quot;. God has nothing to do with it, really. We
&gt; could be talking about ghosts, telekinesis, the Secret, freemasonry, or
&gt; alternative medicine. What I value is rationalism and science, and I think

But who says that it's unknowable?  Maybe it's only unknowable now,
given our technology.  150 years ago, much of what we take for granted
would have been unthinkable.  And I, for one, won't let the technology
gap stop me from hypothesising based on what information is available
to me now.  I have proven that this kind of God is possible according
to the laws of physics and, as it solves heretofore unsolvable

Much like the rest of us do when we argue for that in which we
believe.  I believe Ian is, in his heart of hearts, an empiricist.
I.e., he won't accept something unless it can be shown to be
irrefutable.  Which is fine.  I can relate to that being a man from
Missouri (Missouri is called the 'Show Me' state, as its residents
almost always demand to be shown before they accept); but, what Ian
must accept is that God is still, technically, a scientific
possibility, as it has not been empirically demonstrated to NOT

Oh, I don't know.  I think putting up the bare-faced question itself
showed pretty much bottle.  It's like calling in poker.  Time for the
monists to show their cards.  But, I'm afraid this is Universal Texas
Hold-'Em that were playing and, although I've shown my two cards and
Ian has shown his two cards, there are the 5 OTHER cards that the
dealer throws.  And not all of those have been thrown, so we can't
yet, see who really wins.  Putting on my best analogy hat, I'd say
that my two cards are, at least, of the same suit if not also in
sequence, giving me a better prospect of a flush or straight but Ian's

Here, I'd have to back the rational, depending on what you're
classifying as 'irrational'.  I do believe that there is a perfectly
rational explanation for every event in this universe; however, I
don't believe we understand a tenth of what we need to know regarding
energetic fields (like electric fields, magnetic fields, etc.).  If
string theory is the paradigm of reality, then fields will naturally
extend into the Calabi-Yau space and, what those fields do THERE is
outside our capacity to probe.  However, there may be ways of
inferring what takes place there and it is along those lines that
science must work in order to best prove or disprove possibilities.
If by irrational you mean 'that which is not yet fully understood',
then, of course, I would have to agree that the irrational is exactly
what science should be working towards resolving, yet, due to its own
precious resolve (that there is no God), it fears such exploration and
avoids it.

&gt; &gt; Hi Lee,

&gt; &gt; If the words you are referring to are &quot;superstitious&quot;, &quot;supernatural&quot;,
&gt; &gt; &quot;prophet&quot;, &quot;ju-ju man&quot;, et al; then what is your point? These are all
&gt; &gt; perfectly accurate descriptions. For example, Pat mentioned that, in
&gt; &gt; deciding upon a concept of God for his theory, that he referenced Hinduism.
&gt; &gt; Hinduism, by absolute definition is both supernatural and superstitious. It
&gt; &gt; is a religion. Also, gurus are prophets, and a prophet by another name is a
&gt; &gt; ju-ju man. What do you have against West African wise men? That sounds like
&gt; &gt; religious hatred to me, Lee. How dare I taint the names of your blessed
&gt; &gt; gurus by calling them ju-ju men! :)

&gt; &gt; You don't like these words, but that is because they serve as an unwelcome
&gt; &gt; reminder of how far beyond rationalism you have allowed your mind to wander.
&gt; &gt; They are accurate; you are a superstitious man. Sikhism is full of rituals
&gt; &gt; and practices. None of this questioning of your rationalism implies anything
&gt; &gt; about your intelligence (which I respect), so please do not take offence.

&gt; &gt; I don't have a fervent dislike for religion. No way. I have a distrust of
&gt; &gt; religion's so-called &quot;truths&quot;, and also of its motives and the motives of
&gt; &gt; those who choose to believe. This distrust is based upon self-evident
&gt; &gt; truths: the spurious and inconsistent nature of scripture, the concept of
&gt; &gt; faith, the absence of tangible evidence for its claims, and the cult-like
&gt; &gt; operations of many religions. Also there's perfect demonstrations in this
&gt; &gt; very group of strong psychological predispositions toward mysticism. Whilst
&gt; &gt; you might like fairies, Pat likes to conflate science with mysticism; it's
&gt; &gt; all different manifestations of the same appetite of wonder: the same kind
&gt; &gt; of wish-thinking.

&gt; &gt; I'm quite shocked that you call what I have said &quot;hate speech&quot;. I respect
&gt; &gt; your right to believe in whatever you like, but if you're going to come to
&gt; &gt; the table with an idea and try and palm it off as rational, then expect that
&gt; &gt; idea to be attacked in the strongest possible terms. If you're feeling
&gt; &gt; yourself getting precious about that idea, then there's your warning sign
&gt; &gt; that you have abandoned rationalism.

&gt; &gt; It's not that I don't &quot;do God&quot;. God has nothing to do with it, really. We
&gt; &gt; could be talking about ghosts, telekinesis, the Secret, freemasonry, or
&gt; &gt; alternative medicine. What I value is rationalism and science, and I think
&gt; &gt; it's worthwhile pointing out when people abuse these concepts to justify or
&gt; &gt; add weight to superstitious ideas as well as the great unknowable (is there
&gt; &gt; a God?).

&gt; &gt; I'm interest in Monism and how far people take the idea. Like I said, I
&gt; &gt; think I can get behind physicalism. That's not too much of stretch for me.
&gt; &gt; However, I was curious about the basis for people taking this further -- as
&gt; &gt; far as deification. I suppose I knew already that something dubious like
&gt; &gt; string theory was involved with Pat's form of Monism, but that doesn't mean
&gt; &gt; I'm not interested to learn more and have a bit of back-and-forth about it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; As to the original question though, do you distinguish between

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is part of my pysche that people are differant all over the world,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the one hand, absolute physicalism is something I think I could, more

&gt; &gt; &gt; we

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does&quot;. I'm on your team, but I draw the line here.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My suspicion is that Monism is something a little more fanciful for some
&gt; &gt; &gt; of

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am I right? I'm not trying to &quot;out&quot; theists here, I'm just curious about

God is nature itself, all existence in the universe, all knowledge in
the universe, all bliss which motivates all beings in the universe.
So, when the scientist studies the knowledge in physical or biological
domain, he is actually studying God ... This much is the concept. To
realise it intimately, personally, is to know one's self.

&gt; Okay, Pat, taking one thing at a time.

&gt; It seems to me that you have approached the whole thing with a very peculiar
&gt; prejudice; in particular you have chosen to go with a &quot;classical
&gt; description&quot; of God. Why is this particular unverifiable idea given value --
&gt; and overriding value! -- in your quest for truth? Because lots of people
&gt; believed it? Because, at least culturally, you were exposed to the idea and
&gt; therefore it sort of &quot;fits&quot;? I think, right here, you have crossed the line
&gt; of rationalism in deciding upon a particular concept of God; or even on God
&gt; at all.

&gt; I also think you're ascribing your own motives to science that aren't
&gt; science's. Of course science must start out to disprove God; that's how
&gt; science works. Develop a theory, then try and prove the thing wrong.
&gt; Endlessly. With extreme prejudice. There can be nothing special about &quot;God&quot;
&gt; that should require special dispensations from science. It doesn't work like
&gt; that. There has to be prejudice against all theories. Very strong prejudice.

&gt; Hence I think you saying: &quot;If your science is designed to give rational
&gt; results, then your science is designed to offer solutions that are opposed
&gt; to (i.e., offered as an alternative to) God. Whereas my scientific approach
&gt; had no such anti-deity prejudice&quot;, kind of proves you can neither claim
&gt; science or rationalism as an ally (much less the basis for your theory). If
&gt; you don't like what science tells you because its results are rational, then
&gt; tough! Think of all the spurious other things we could claim science
&gt; supports if we proceeded to manipulate how it works.

Truly, science has advanced the most when it has aspired to resolve

&gt; &gt; Let me perhaps be a little clearer, the words you use and the way in

&gt; I don't think, for a minute, that Ian intends to come across as an

&gt; one will speak with conviction.  I think Ian believes that he is
&gt; correct and will argue his point as if that belief is a given fact.
&gt; Much like the rest of us do when we argue for that in which we
&gt; believe.  I believe Ian is, in his heart of hearts, an empiricist.
&gt; I.e., he won't accept something unless it can be shown to be
&gt; irrefutable.  Which is fine.  I can relate to that being a man from
&gt; Missouri (Missouri is called the 'Show Me' state, as its residents
&gt; almost always demand to be shown before they accept); but, what Ian
&gt; must accept is that God is still, technically, a scientific
&gt; possibility, as it has not been empirically demonstrated to NOT
&gt; exist.  Nor has it been empirically demonstrated to even be not
&gt; likely.  One cannot stand tall on a mountain of 'lack of evidence'.

&gt; &gt; Heh you and I have had at this before, and each time you pull the
&gt; &gt; 'what, what did I say?' card.  Suffice to say, if you are going to

I am now beyond the Cauchy horizon, thinking of travel beating time.
Strangely, I am hemmed in by airport walls.  The reality of Paris
Charles de Gualle, rotten food, hemmed in by airport walls and the
need now to spend another night in the Hotel Crap in Bucharest, before
my trip to the loop of solitude in Moldovan space, and all because
whatever now passes as British Rail screwed my connection and has cost
me two days.  Who needs complex integrative mathematics to know there
is no god other than irony, eating airport food on standby for the
next flight which may never come, not far from excellent restaurants
in the 7th Arondisement! This will be my last portal to the universe I
am about to leave, my laptop soon to be consigned to a hotel safe,
beyond the extensive reach of Moldovan airport security.  Rangers won
3 nil last night, a sure confirmation of closed-string-loops, United
only by the skin of teeth Planck unit of an infinite string.

Science at some levels is highly specualative and based on thought
experiements.  God as I meet him/her/genders beyond (maybe there are a
dozen or so in biology now) is as credible as any thought experiment
in the beginning.  Vlutvlut, logrooof pintangle muchadoaboutnothin
could well be the key to the universe.  I heard a drunken Norwegian
say it once.  A noise very similar has just seeped from the airport
Tannoy system, I think announcing my flight.  Farewell, brave world,
for I am off the the land of the legged snakes I call Pollard.  They
know little of biology, but talk more sense than most.  In terms of
the return of desire, think not of snakes in the pejorative, but as
friendly talking creatures, essential in any good religious
literature.  I would merely point out that such stout fellows, in
irony, are some evidence for god in their honest profession of atheism
and genuine argument - for the existence of such decent people might
just be the work of some spirit less cursed than a british rail
timetabler.  EPR is not a phenomenon, but a thought experiement (don't
Bell Theorem me - that's another story).  The rationale of this
message is &quot;Support Your Local Ian Pollard&quot;.  Making sense, once we
forget distinctions between thought and experiment is all too easy in
words.  Sometimes it is good to pull out a bottom card, to remind

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Ian,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me perhaps be a little clearer, the words you use and the way in
&gt; &gt; &gt; which you use them, and the tone which they convey seem to me(and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; guess to some others also) to indicate a snobishness, they convey to
&gt; &gt; &gt; me a sense of superiority that you feel over those who practice
&gt; &gt; &gt; superstiousness, and I'm am also willing to bet you write in such a
&gt; &gt; &gt; manner on purpose.

&gt; &gt; I don't think, for a minute, that Ian intends to come across as an
&gt; &gt; intellectual elitist but, when one is convinced that they are right,
&gt; &gt; one will speak with conviction.  I think Ian believes that he is
&gt; &gt; correct and will argue his point as if that belief is a given fact.
&gt; &gt; Much like the rest of us do when we argue for that in which we
&gt; &gt; believe.  I believe Ian is, in his heart of hearts, an empiricist.
&gt; &gt; I.e., he won't accept something unless it can be shown to be
&gt; &gt; irrefutable.  Which is fine.  I can relate to that being a man from
&gt; &gt; Missouri (Missouri is called the 'Show Me' state, as its residents
&gt; &gt; almost always demand to be shown before they accept); but, what Ian
&gt; &gt; must accept is that God is still, technically, a scientific
&gt; &gt; possibility, as it has not been empirically demonstrated to NOT
&gt; &gt; exist.  Nor has it been empirically demonstrated to even be not
&gt; &gt; likely.  One cannot stand tall on a mountain of 'lack of evidence'.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Heh you and I have had at this before, and each time you pull the
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'what, what did I say?' card.  Suffice to say, if you are going to
&gt; &gt; &gt; insult people(and you know as well as I do that belittleing somebodies
&gt; &gt; &gt; faith is insulting them) then at least have the 'bottle'(English slang
&gt; &gt; &gt; for bravery) to stand by your words and not pretend to know not what
&gt; &gt; &gt; you have done.

&gt; &gt; Oh, I don't know.  I think putting up the bare-faced question itself
&gt; &gt; showed pretty much bottle.  It's like calling in poker.  Time for the
&gt; &gt; monists to show their cards.  But, I'm afraid this is Universal Texas
&gt; &gt; Hold-'Em that were playing and, although I've shown my two cards and
&gt; &gt; Ian has shown his two cards, there are the 5 OTHER cards that the
&gt; &gt; dealer throws.  And not all of those have been thrown, so we can't
&gt; &gt; yet, see who really wins.  Putting on my best analogy hat, I'd say
&gt; &gt; that my two cards are, at least, of the same suit if not also in
&gt; &gt; sequence, giving me a better prospect of a flush or straight but Ian's
&gt; &gt; cards are slightly higher than mine, maybe even a pair, giving him the
&gt; &gt; initial appearance of having a better hand.

&gt; &gt; &gt; My only point in my post was to point out to you, how you come
&gt; &gt; &gt; across.  Hah Like I undoubtedly come across as a raving 'sensitive
&gt; &gt; &gt; soul' by engaging in this toing-and-throwing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; However!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Rationality vs irrationality.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What makes you so certain that irrationality has no place in our
&gt; &gt; &gt; minds?  Why must you look down on those who freely choose to open up
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the irrationality in life?  Or what data do you posses that has
&gt; &gt; &gt; shaped this dislike for irrationality, and that rational thought is
&gt; &gt; &gt; the only way for us?

&gt; &gt; Here, I'd have to back the rational, depending on what you're
&gt; &gt; classifying as 'irrational'.  I do believe that there is a perfectly
&gt; &gt; rational explanation for every event in this universe; however, I
&gt; &gt; don't believe we understand a tenth of what we need to know regarding
&gt; &gt; energetic fields (like electric fields, magnetic fields, etc.).  If
&gt; &gt; string theory is the paradigm of reality, then fields will naturally
&gt; &gt; extend into the Calabi-Yau space and, what those fields do THERE is
&gt; &gt; outside our capacity to probe.  However, there may be ways of
&gt; &gt; inferring what takes place there and it is along those lines that
&gt; &gt; science must work in order to best prove or disprove possibilities.
&gt; &gt; If by irrational you mean 'that which is not yet fully understood',
&gt; &gt; then, of course, I would have to agree that the irrational is exactly
&gt; &gt; what science should be working towards resolving, yet, due to its own
&gt; &gt; precious resolve (that there is no God), it fears such exploration and
&gt; &gt; avoids it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Lee,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If the words you are referring to are &quot;superstitious&quot;, &quot;supernatural&quot;,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;prophet&quot;, &quot;ju-ju man&quot;, et al; then what is your point? These are all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfectly accurate descriptions. For example, Pat mentioned that, in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deciding upon a concept of God for his theory, that he referenced Hinduism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hinduism, by absolute definition is both supernatural and superstitious. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a religion. Also, gurus are prophets, and a prophet by another name is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ju-ju man. What do you have against West African wise men? That sounds like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; religious hatred to me, Lee. How dare I taint the names of your blessed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gurus by calling them ju-ju men! :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You don't like these words, but that is because they serve as an unwelcome
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reminder of how far beyond rationalism you have allowed your mind to wander.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They are accurate; you are a superstitious man. Sikhism is full of rituals
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and practices. None of this questioning of your rationalism implies anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about your intelligence (which I respect), so please do not take offence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't have a fervent dislike for religion. No way. I have a distrust of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; religion's so-called &quot;truths&quot;, and also of its motives and the motives of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those who choose to believe. This distrust is based upon self-evident
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truths: the spurious and inconsistent nature of scripture, the concept of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; faith, the absence of tangible evidence for its claims, and the cult-like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operations of many religions. Also there's perfect demonstrations in this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very group of strong psychological predispositions toward mysticism. Whilst
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you might like fairies, Pat likes to conflate science with mysticism; it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all different manifestations of the same appetite of wonder: the same kind
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of wish-thinking.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm quite shocked that you call what I have said &quot;hate speech&quot;. I respect
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your right to believe in whatever you like, but if you're going to come to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the table with an idea and try and palm it off as rational, then expect that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; idea to be attacked in the strongest possible terms. If you're feeling
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself getting precious about that idea, then there's your warning sign
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that you have abandoned rationalism.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's not that I don't &quot;do God&quot;. God has nothing to do with it, really. We
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be talking about ghosts, telekinesis, the Secret, freemasonry, or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alternative medicine. What I value is rationalism and science, and I think
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's worthwhile pointing out when people abuse these concepts to justify or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; add weight to superstitious ideas as well as the great unknowable (is there
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a God?).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm interest in Monism and how far people take the idea. Like I said, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think I can get behind physicalism. That's not too much of stretch for me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, I was curious about the basis for people taking this further -- as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; far as deification. I suppose I

What we are discussing, actually, is the fact of quantum
entanglement and how, if the strings are joined, that explains the
mechanical connection governing entanglement by exposing the locality
they share in the Calabi-Yau space.  It solves the EPR thought
experiment, de facto, by virtue of demonstrating that locality rather
than non-locality is the reality.  Nice card, but it's me rather than

Pat,

You're right to call me an empiricist. I like biology and chemistry because
we are mostly able to deal with tangibles; from antiretrovirals to super
plastics to microevolution, we can see this stuff, watch it working, and
recreate it. On the other hand, when it comes to physics, I think the
enormous holes in the science -- even in the standard model -- are open to
some quite mystical interpretations. One example of this, I think, is String
Theory.

In the realm of pure mathematics, many things might be &quot;possible&quot; but that
does not make them true, likely, or applicable in the physical world. Until
you bring them out of the conceptual bubble of mathematical theory and have
them available as physically operable parameters then they are just
curiosities. But In the absence of any testable hypothesis, I can't see why
String Theory should be given any more credibility than the Bible or the
Qu'ran. I think multiverses, megaverses, Calabi-Yau manifolds, and
braneworlds are all possibilities. I can't disprove the mathematics of them
-- but so what? It's important, if we're trying to be rational (which was
the focus of my post), to appreciate that until there is some actual
evidence then these things should be put into the appropriate context. This
is not to say that I don't value the work of experimental physicists (I do),
but I'm baffled that anyone could think themselves rational by saying they
have accidentally discovered God via a scientific theory that many
scientists refuse to even acknowledge as a &quot;theory&quot; and then corroborated
this with religious mythology. That's not rational; that's obviously quite
bonkers. :)

&gt; &gt; Pat,

&gt; &gt; Have I got this right?

&gt; &gt; [1] You believe that you have established logical proof that the
&gt; universe is
&gt; &gt; omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient. I don't think you can call it
&gt; &gt; &quot;scientific proof&quot;, but I accept, for the moment, that you think it
&gt; might be
&gt; &gt; logically or mathematically possible according to string theory. And, of
&gt; &gt; course, it cannot be disproved.

&gt; If the strings are joined as I think they are, then I have
&gt; established, logically, that the one object is omnipresent, omnipotent
&gt; and omniscient.  And, yes, I agree that I cannot call it a scientific
&gt; proof, as there is no empirical evidence to back it up due to our
&gt; technology.

&gt; &gt; [2] You have embraced some superstitious or supernatural ideas because
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; are not in conflict with your first premise. Or, maybe more than that:
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; believe that the prophet, ju-ju man, or whoever, who came up with the
&gt; ideas
&gt; &gt; were somehow divinely inspired toward &quot;truth&quot;? In a sense, they arrived
&gt; at
&gt; &gt; the same profound truth by some &quot;other&quot; means?

&gt; What is superstitious about a universe that follows the laws of
&gt; physics?  If something happens in this universe, then there are laws
&gt; to explain it.  We, as a species, don't have ALL the answers yet.  And
&gt; that doesn't mean that events outside our understanding are
&gt; supernatural, it just means they are outside our current
&gt; understanding.  These others that I mentioned have all come up with
&gt; descriptions of God based on first accepting that God exists and THAT
&gt; is coming at it from the other direction.  I came up with a
&gt; description of the universe that matches their description of God,
&gt; when I wasn't TRYING to describe God.

&gt; &gt; And therefore God exists?

&gt; No, God must remain as a possibility, and, moreover, it should be
&gt; viewed as being likely, given my geometric topology of the Calabi-Yau
&gt; space.  But I would NOT say that 'therefore God exists', as I have no
&gt; empirical proof.

&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; therefore it sort of &quot;fits&quot;? I think, right here, you have crossed
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of rationalism in deciding upon a particular concept of God; or even
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; God
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at all.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, though, it worked the other way around.  When I realised that
&gt; &gt; &gt; the 10-dimensional object was omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient,
&gt; &gt; &gt; THEN, I called it God.  What would you call an object that is
&gt; &gt; &gt; omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient if you had no bias AGAINST
&gt; &gt; &gt; God?  Remember that I was atheist.  I didn't believe that God existed
&gt; &gt; &gt; and THEN I was presented with a description of the universe as
&gt; &gt; &gt; omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient.  I wasn't looking for God, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; was looking for a way to solve the EPR effect.  God sort of just fell
&gt; &gt; &gt; out of the envelope.  I'll say it again: If I'm right about the
&gt; &gt; &gt; strings joining, then the universe IS God.  And that God works
&gt; &gt; &gt; perfectly according to 'the laws of physics' and not according to 'the
&gt; &gt; &gt; laws of physics as we know them'.  It is amoral.  It is congruent with
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Hindu concept of Brahman and Advaita Vedanta.  It is congruent
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the Tao.  It is congruent with Ibn al-Arabi's interpretation of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Qur'an's Allah.  It is congruent with Spinoza's God.  It is
&gt; &gt; &gt; congruent with Maimonides.  Why do you suppose that is?  I think it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; because they were all on the right track, just coming from the other
&gt; &gt; &gt; direction.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also think you're ascribing your own motives to science that
&gt; aren't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; science's. Of course science must start out to disprove God; that's
&gt; how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; science works.

&gt; &gt; &gt; No.  That's the rub of prejudice.  Science is about discovering how
&gt; &gt; &gt; things are.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Develop a theory, then try and prove the thing wrong.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree, however mankind is not currently technologically capable of
&gt; &gt; &gt; proving or disproving string theory.  So, that's out of my hands and
&gt; &gt; &gt; is, therefore, not a problem I can attack.  The mathematics behind
&gt; &gt; &gt; string theory is provable, so we know that it is a valid possibility.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Solving the EPR effect through manipulation of the Calabi-Yau geometry
&gt; &gt; &gt; makes my version of string theory a more likely prospect, as it solves
&gt; &gt; &gt; a fundamental problem without changing the rules.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Endlessly. With extreme prejudice.

&gt; &gt; &gt;      How can you say that science must have extreme prejudice?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Prejudice is specifically antiscientific, as prejudice is bias.  Good
&gt; &gt; &gt; science does not come with a built in bias.  Without prejudice is
&gt; &gt; &gt; fairer to truth.  The prejudice against one thing prevents you from
&gt; &gt; &gt; EVER seeing it as a possible truth, yet you know (as I do) that God is
&gt; &gt; &gt; not disprovable by science.  Yet you still hold your prejudice.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, when we let prejudice into law, we get things like Dred
&gt; &gt; &gt; Scott, where people are legally chattel and when we let prejudice into
&gt; &gt; &gt; science, we get things like an institutionalised religious community
&gt; &gt; &gt; of atheists blinded by their science, which has turned into the art of
&gt; &gt; &gt; making 'Not God'.  Good science is not a biased art of deception, is
&gt; &gt; &gt; it?  Well, mine isn't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;There can be nothing special about &quot;God&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that should require special dispensations from science. It doesn't
&gt; work
&gt; &gt; &gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That's right, which means that, if it hasn't been disproven (and God
&gt; &gt; &gt; has not been), then it must remain a possibility.  And not thrown off
&gt; &gt; &gt; at the beginning because you feel it can't be right.  That's bias and
&gt; &gt; &gt; not science.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;There has to be prejudice against all theories. Very strong
&gt; prejudice.

&gt; &gt; &gt; No, there has to be evidence to stand behind a prejudice, and you have
&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e., there is) no evidence to support the theory that &quot;there is no
&gt; &gt; &gt; God&quot;.  Lack of evidence cannot be logically used to support anything.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I present evidence that the 10-dimensional object of stringy energy is
&gt; &gt; &gt; omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient.  Call it what you like.  Call
&gt; &gt; &gt; it Tendose (that's 10-Dimensional Object of Stringy Energy), it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; still omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient.  And, if you were to
&gt; &gt; &gt; look up those three words to 'discover' what there is that is
&gt; &gt; &gt; described that way, you'll find the word God used quite a bit.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence I think you saying: &quot;If your science is designed to give
&gt; rational
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; results, then your science is designed to offer solutions that are
&gt; &gt; &gt; opposed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to (i.e., offered as an alternative to) God. Whereas my scientific
&gt; &gt; &gt; approach
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had no such anti-deity prejudice&quot;, kind of proves you can neither
&gt; claim
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; science or rationalism as an ally (much less the basis for your
&gt; theory).

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, as one of the scientists who hold a bias against God, it irks you
&gt; &gt; &gt; that it can be seen as rational.  I can live with that.  If you hold
&gt; &gt; &gt; that rational implies godlessness, then you only prove your bias.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you don't like what science tells you because its results are
&gt; rational,
&gt; &gt; &gt; then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tough!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree.  However if you think that rational implies godless then
&gt; &gt; &gt; you've added a religious (or, more properly, an anti-religious) bent
&gt; &gt; &gt; to your science and it is not completely rational, which I take to
&gt; &gt; &gt; mean balanced reasoning that objectively views the data without
&gt; &gt; &gt; prejudice.  If your science has, built into it, a dogmatic belief
&gt; &gt; &gt; that, irrespective of

I suppose you're right. But this just confirms that, by the most accurate
tools and mechanisms currently available to us, we cannot establish whether

Several weeks ago I had a good talk with Pat about his theories.  I
personally think they are very interesting, and mostly likely
unprovable.  What I appreciate more from Pat is his insight in
Kabbalah.

I think the important thing is, Pat has a belief, and I will go
further and use my own personal experience, a 'knowledge' of things
that cannot be explained currently.  That which you guys call God.  He
has made a valiant effort to reconcile that with what he knows about
how the world works.

We are not completely rational beings.  I believe in a number of
things that many would consider dubious (a nod to Chris, there).  What
matters to me is not the concrete atomic existance of something, but
its use.  If something, like a idea, like God, has a use to me, and
thus has gained an existance.

Who is anyone to say that patterns of neurons firing one's mind has
less of an existence than patterns of atoms, or patterns of energy
that make atoms.  For those who are afraid of such ideas, this doesn't
mean that anything goes, there are still good ideas and concepts, and
bad ones.  Of course, who decides which is which?

I think Pat's model of reality is a great one to tie everything
together.  I personally like a few loose ends, myself.

I look at it another way.  The fact that a helicopter was not feasibly
technologically possible for Leonardo DaVinci to create, didn't
prevent him from noting that it would work and how it could work.  It
is in that spirit that I will strive to push forward what I know CAN
work and leave it up to posterity to empirically prove or disprove it
when that is possible.  I fully agree with you that, empirically, it's
on shaky ground, but so many things fall into place GIVEN my theory
and working from ITS premiss, that I feel it's better to state it than
to ignore it.  Even at the risk of being called irrational by some or
a heretic by others.  Besides, it may lead the way to empirically
inferring Calabi-Yau events and hastening man's ability to empirically
prove or disprove string theory through logical inference of field
dynamics.
Like I said, it angers both camps and leaves them both
dissatisfied.  Personally, I think the religious camp gives up more as
they (well, some of them) have to forego the concept that God is
omnibenificent and accept that what we perceive as evil, ultimately
must come from God.  A God that obeys the laws of physics, to me,
sounds as if the scientific community has given up less ground
overall.

&gt; Pat,

&gt; You're right to call me an empiricist. I like biology and chemistry because
&gt; we are mostly able to deal with tangibles; from antiretrovirals to super
&gt; plastics to microevolution, we can see this stuff, watch it working, and
&gt; recreate it. On the other hand, when it comes to physics, I think the
&gt; enormous holes in the science -- even in the standard model -- are open to
&gt; some quite mystical interpretations. One example of this, I think, is String
&gt; Theory.

&gt; In the realm of pure mathematics, many things might be &quot;possible&quot; but that
&gt; does not make them true, likely, or applicable in the physical world. Until
&gt; you bring them out of the conceptual bubble of mathematical theory and have
&gt; them available as physically operable parameters then they are just
&gt; curiosities. But In the absence of any testable hypothesis, I can't see why
&gt; String Theory should be given any more credibility than the Bible or the
&gt; Qu'ran. I think multiverses, megaverses, Calabi-Yau manifolds, and
&gt; braneworlds are all possibilities. I can't disprove the mathematics of them
&gt; -- but so what? It's important, if we're trying to be rational (which was
&gt; the focus of my post), to appreciate that until there is some actual
&gt; evidence then these things should be put into the appropriate context. This
&gt; is not to say that I don't value the work of experimental physicists (I do),
&gt; but I'm baffled that anyone could think themselves rational by saying they
&gt; have accidentally discovered God via a scientific theory that many
&gt; scientists refuse to even acknowledge as a &quot;theory&quot; and then corroborated
&gt; this with religious mythology. That's not rational; that's obviously quite
&gt; bonkers. :)

Or, simply ahead of its time.  I do appreciate that I cannot
empirically prove my theory.  I submit to the time in which I was
born.  But suppose, for an instant, that I'm correct.  If I don't say
anything, how much longer do you think it would take for mankind to
come back around to it?  Believe it or not, I feel quite obliged to
state the case.  If I tell the world and I'm wrong, then no harm comes
of it; but, if I'm right and I don't tell the world, I think that it
would be a long time before those pieces of the puzzle would be put
together like that again and science will have lost footing forever.
The only risk is looking as foolish as Plato does now to some.  And,
I'm sure, those who really know me already have empirical evidence for
that. ;-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Pat,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Have I got this right?

&gt; &gt; &gt; [1] You believe that you have established logical proof that the
&gt; &gt; universe is
&gt; &gt; &gt; omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient. I don't think you can call it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;scientific proof&quot;, but I accept, for the moment, that you think it
&gt; &gt; might be
&gt; &gt; &gt; logically or mathematically possible according to string theory. And, of
&gt; &gt; &gt; course, it cannot be disproved.

&gt; &gt; If the strings are joined as I think they are, then I have
&gt; &gt; established, logically, that the one object is omnipresent, omnipotent
&gt; &gt; and omniscient.  And, yes, I agree that I cannot call it a scientific
&gt; &gt; proof, as there is no empirical evidence to back it up due to our
&gt; &gt; technology.

&gt; &gt; &gt; [2] You have embraced some superstitious or supernatural ideas because
&gt; &gt; they
&gt; &gt; &gt; are not in conflict with your first premise. Or, maybe more than that:
&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe that the prophet, ju-ju man, or whoever, who came up with the
&gt; &gt; ideas
&gt; &gt; &gt; were somehow divinely inspired toward &quot;truth&quot;? In a sense, they arrived
&gt; &gt; at
&gt; &gt; &gt; the same profound truth by some &quot;other&quot; means?

&gt; &gt; What is superstitious about a universe that follows the laws of
&gt; &gt; physics?  If something happens in this universe, then there are laws
&gt; &gt; to explain it.  We, as a species, don't have ALL the answers yet.  And
&gt; &gt; that doesn't mean that events outside our understanding are
&gt; &gt; supernatural, it just means they are outside our current
&gt; &gt; understanding.  These others that I mentioned have all come up with
&gt; &gt; descriptions of God based on first accepting that God exists and THAT
&gt; &gt; is coming at it from the other direction.  I came up with a
&gt; &gt; description of the universe that matches their description of God,
&gt; &gt; when I wasn't TRYING to describe God.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And therefore God exists?

&gt; &gt; No, God must remain as a possibility, and, moreover, it should be
&gt; &gt; viewed as being likely, given my geometric topology of the Calabi-Yau
&gt; &gt; space.  But I would NOT say that 'therefore God exists', as I have no
&gt; &gt; empirical proof.

Pat,

Don't misunderstand me, I'm really happy that you are saying something and
putting a theory out there. Look at the Bertrand Russell quote in my
signature. :) I have no such theory to offer, and I don't imagine I ever
will. I'm too sceptical to commit something so loose and  abstract as a
unifying theory, even one largely grounded in logic or mathematics.

As much as I like your theory, and it's about the best I've come across on
Mind's Eye, I cannot frame it in a context of rationalism. I can't even do
that with String Theory by itself, let alone taking things to the next step
(deification).

And if you think Plato looks foolish now, remember it was his pupil
Aristotle who thought earthquakes were caused by underground winds. :)

&gt; Don't misunderstand me, I'm really happy that you are saying something and
&gt; putting a theory out there. Look at the Bertrand Russell quote in my
&gt; signature. :) I have no such theory to offer, and I don't imagine I ever
&gt; will. I'm too sceptical to commit something so loose and  abstract as a
&gt; unifying theory, even one largely grounded in logic or mathematics.

&gt; As much as I like your theory, and it's about the best I've come across on
&gt; Mind's Eye, I cannot frame it in a context of rationalism. I can't even do
&gt; that with String Theory by itself, let alone taking things to the next step
&gt; (deification).

Cheers!!  I can relate to that.  Deification is a huge step, I agree;
but, when confronted with the 3 Os, I didn't have another word in my
glossary that I could induce from them.

&gt; And if you think Plato looks foolish now, remember it was his pupil
&gt; Aristotle who thought earthquakes were caused by underground winds. :)

Yes, and as P ans S waves were discovered later, Aristotle's wind
isn't a bad primitive analogy.  It was far from the truth in one sense
but, in another way, it was a keen insight, from a someone lacking
technological advances, to relate earthquakes (movement of earth) and
wind (movement of air), as both are wavelike, like the movement of
water.  It was this level of analogy that sprang from looking at the
world as the four elements of earth, air, fire and water.  Imagine
what Aristotle could have pondered if he'd been shown a periodic table
of elements.

Heh and so by binding yourself to one sort of thought only, you freely
admit that you are not adequately equipped to provide some answers to
some questions?

I freely admit there are questions that I cannot answer, of course.  I am
certainly binding myself to one sort of thought, that of evidence-based
analysis and empiricism. The difference is that you're seeing that as a bad
thing and I'm not. Isn't life odd? :)

Yeah you are right, I think by doing what you do you close yourself
off to certain ideas.

Obviously you do so because you can see no merit (or perhaps value?)
in these other ideas, but I don't think it bad, but sad that you
choose such a path.

What fascinates me is why we are so different (not just you and I) but
all people.
You are, I am sure, if not 100% then pretty close to it certain that
your own personal philosophies of live are correct.

I am equally as certain as to the veracity of my own philosophies of
life.  When we get two seemingly opposed ideals then either, one is
wrong, or both are wrong, or can it be said that both are correct?
(Subjectivity and wot not)

Obviously when it comes to matters of science, there is either dark
matter or there is not. When it comes to more abstract ideas though, I
really do believe that there is room for one, two, three, or more or
even contradictory ideas to all be correct.

Pat's version of string theory I can certainly get behind, as it very
much resembles the Sikh view of God, as espoused in the Mool Mantar
(google it).

I really don't need this to be empirically proven before I feel happy
putting my trust in it being so.  Heh yet you see this as a bad thing.

Like a cat, a few loose ends are an invitation to me to pursue; so
here goes...

Religious &quot;Orthodox&quot; Jews wear &quot;tzitzitzs&quot;, or fringes,(the loose
strings) exposed beneath their outerwear both ro remind them that they
are to fulfill the mitzvot(both positive and negative) in relationship
to God and to each other; and to identify themselves to other Jews as
well as proudly claim to the persecuting &quot;others&quot;, &quot;Here I Am!&quot;
Those fringes today are interpreted more often by modern Jews to mean
that we are to be reminded that God did not complete the work of
creation, but created a covenant, with lots of loose ends (and torn
threads) with the Israelites who, bless their hearts, allegedly said,
&quot;We will do and we wil hear&quot; to this revelation (which, apparently,
has had its usefulness). Modern Jews relate this to the mitzvah
(positive good deed) of Tikkun Olam--repair of the world.

Some take the idea even beyond imagination eg. One who does everything
yet has done nothing OR One who does nothing yet has done every thing
and there is so called theory to prove it. I am not aware of all isms,
but some of them do not require you to believe the theories (in fact
one is not supposed to believe it ) unless there is verification and
experience, which may not be universal or global but may be individual
in nature.

&gt; I'm curious about Monism, in particular I'm interested to know how far our
&gt; resident Monists take their idea and why.

&gt; On the one hand, absolute physicalism is something I think I could, more or
&gt; less, accept. Darwinism affirms that the evolution of organic things
&gt; operates according to a single cohesive set of mechanisms. We know this; we
&gt; can watch it happen. The social behaviour of a species is also controlled by
&gt; physical genetic make up. By way of a basic example, imagine the behaviour
&gt; of a male human-being with extremely low (or even extremely high)
&gt; testosterone. I have no problem with the tent &quot;the mind is what the brain
&gt; does&quot;. I'm on your team, but I draw the line here.

&gt; My suspicion is that Monism is something a little more fanciful for some of
&gt; our members; a little more like theistic wish-thinking. In particular, I
&gt; wonder if they might be misusing some pretty solid scientific truths to
&gt; justify more mystical ideas about &quot;God&quot;?

&gt; Am I right? I'm not trying to &quot;out&quot; theists here, I'm just curious about how
&gt; far beyond the line of rationalism they take the idea.
