As I usually do on the anniversary of my country's birth, I think
about patriotism...what it means.  For many, patriotism is how one
serves the country.  When I was a child, the only way was to be a
member of the armed forces.

The Beatles changed all that.  They were &quot;foreigners&quot; to those of us
in the US, and yet they were like us.   Their popularity, and
eventually the meaning of many of their songs, ushered in a worldview
perspective for those of us living in the United States.  This
phenomenon was not unique to America as The Beatles became accepted by
people as far apart as Italy, Japan, Australia, and although a bit
more cautiously, in the Soviet Union.

A worldwide citizenry, where people recognized the commonality they
had with others across the globe, and the realization that all people
desired the same things...peace, safety, good health, nourishment, and
love...stripped away the national boundaries.  People were still proud
of the region they lived in, but they realized that the future of the
world was far more important.

So, although I am proud to be a citizen of the United States, despite
the slippery slope slide away from democracy our current crop of
leaders are engaged, I recognize that The Beatles, and the era of good
will they began, is the right direction for loyalty...a loyalty to the
Earth, no matter what language we speak.

The 60's music and peace movement may have contributed to a global
consciousness, but the seeds were already planted by many others who came
before.
You can go as far back as 2000 years and find a universal message of love
and goodwill in Christ's teachings.  The song &quot;The Word&quot; seems like Lennon's
interpretation of the opening verses of the Gospel of John.  The heavy
emphasis on love echoes the message already found in the 3 epistles of  John
in the New Testament. Woodrow Wilson's League of Nations and later the
United Nations need to be factored in as more influential than the Beatles.
Henry David Thoreau's writings sparked a lot of debate on the roll of
citizenry and were influential as well.

Karl Marx predicted and explained the current 'globalist' trend over 150
years ago. The rapacious, unstoppable growth of capitalism during its
progressive era 'stripped of its halo' not only aristocracy, religion,
and other such traditional institutions, but the nation-state as well.
As long as the bourgeoisie rule, this growing internationalism of
society serves their interests and profits, turning some countries (see
'United States', 'United Kingdom') into rich imperialist superpowers,
and others into vassals, de facto colonies (see 'Iraq', 'Vietnam') from
whom wealth and resources are sucked, by force if necessary, in order to
bulk up the middle class in the oppressor nations, as a buffer against
discontent at home.

However, this process has also laid the first foundations of the
groundwork on which a true global society will be built once the
proletariat has seized power. As with nationalisation of industry,
centralisation of capital, and the working class itself, that which the
bourgeoisie has created as a tool to serve their greed in fact will soon
be turned against them and become an instrument of their own fall.

From the Communist Manifesto:

'Modern industry has established the world market, for which the
discovery of America paved the way. This market has given an immense
development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land. This
development has, in its turn, reacted on the extension of industry; and
in proportion as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in
the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital,
and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle
Ages. ...

'The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the
instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and
with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes
of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first
condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant
revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social
conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the
bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations,
with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are
swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can
ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned,
and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real
conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.

'The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the
bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe. It must nestle
everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere.

'The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given
a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country.
To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has drawn from under the feet
of industry the national ground on which it stood. All old-established
national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed.
They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life
and death question for all civilised nations, by industries that no
longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the
remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at
home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants,
satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring
for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In
place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we
have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of
nations. And as in material, so also in intellectual production. The
intellectual creations of individual nations become common property.
National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more
impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures, there
arises a world literature.

'The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of
production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws
all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation. The cheap
prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down
all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians’ intensely
obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels all nations, on
pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it
compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst,
i.e., to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world
after its own image. ...

'The Communists are ... reproached with desiring to abolish countries
and nationality.

'The working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they
have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political
supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must
constitute itself the nation, it is so far, itself national, though not
in the bourgeois sense of the word.

'National differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and
more vanishing, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom
of commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of
production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto.

'The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still
faster. United action, of the leading civilised countries at least, is
one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.

'In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another will
also be put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will
also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes
within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will
come to an end.'

Well said.

The Beatles crystallized, and were the catalysts for, egalitarianism,
which had it's roots long before they took their first baby-steps in
Liverpool.  They evolved and came to the forefront during a time when
people in greater numbers were more open to these ideas.  The world
shrunk geographically, but expanded consciously.

They were messengers, not avatars, when it came to producing the right
environment for mind expansion.    Musically, they were innovators and
inventors both.

I think the Beatles took advantage of capitalism without really being
any kind of *-ist.
Whatever *-ism(s) you use as your guide(s) through life, money tends
to force compromises in most of us.  No matter how charitably inclined
or socialistically bent we may be, we'll still keep the best share of
the gains (however they're gained) for ourselves, monks and nuns
excepted.  Materialism and financial accumulation are harder habits to
kick than heroin.

Ask anyone who has a tenner (twenty bucks) to spare.  Do you buy that
new DVD or do you give it to charity?

Abe, I must confess that I don't understand your line of reasoning
here.  No where do I say that The Beatles were unique in wanting to
expand their knowledge, or seek non-material goals.  All I'm saying is
that The Beatles, with the world at their feet, with enormous fame and
fortune, became disillusioned when they realized that it didn't solve
all of their individual problems, and wasn't the &quot;be-all and end-all&quot;
of existence.  And so, they began a quest which both mirrored, and in
some cases, initiated similar searches for spirtual meaning among
their contemporaries.

How you managed to derive from  my words that I think The Beatles
started a search for meaning before anyone else ever did...I...just
don't....words fail me within my incredulity over this.

'Enjoying making money' does not make you a capitalist. The Beatles
earned their money by their own work and their own art. Capitalists
merely hire other people to do all the work, make millions off what they
accomplished, and then pay them seven bucks an hour to keep them from
revolting.

&gt;&gt; &gt; member of the armed forces.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The Beatles changed all that.  They were &quot;foreigners&quot; to those of us
&gt;&gt; &gt; in the US, and yet they were like us.   Their popularity, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; eventually the meaning of many of their songs, ushered in a worldview
&gt;&gt; &gt; perspective for those of us living in the United States.  This
&gt;&gt; &gt; phenomenon was not unique to America as The Beatles became accepted by
&gt;&gt; &gt; people as far apart as Italy, Japan, Australia, and although a bit
&gt;&gt; &gt; more cautiously, in the Soviet Union.

&gt;&gt; &gt; A worldwide citizenry, where people recognized the commonality they

&gt;&gt; &gt; So, although I am proud to be a citizen of the United States, despite

No doubt.   You are quite correct,  In America alone, the actions of
the LBJ and Nixon Administrations fomented, and provided a jumping off
point for those who joined the ranks fo the antiwar movement.
However, The Beatles meant so much to people at the time, that in
addition to the musio, lyrics, and Fab Four attitude, just the fact of
four young people uniting in a common effort in an entertainment world
controlled by post WWII moguls provided inspiration that &quot;anything is
possible&quot; to other groups of people.  And that could very well be the
central contribution of The Beatles, in terms of the various movements
of the Sixties...&quot;they did it, so can we&quot;.

Nonsense. Everyone sharing a universal basic sense of responsibility and
love is not the same as everyone believing the exact same things. A
worldwide citizenry is not only possible but necessary, because without
global cooperation and planning, based on science and reason instead of

Um, no. The reason people formed nations was that the independent
city-states that existed until that point were no longer centralised
enough to keep up with advances in technology and social institutions,
and were no longer a sufficient economic or political basis for solving
the problems of the day. Just as before that, the cities evolved from
separate small towns when the latter were no longer sufficient, and
before that, the towns evolved from separate tribes, and the tribes
evolved from separate families. And just as how in the next century or
two, we will need to either have the separate nations evolve into a
global civilisation, or all go exctinct.

Well, basically correct. But it's not really capitalism they took
advantage of. Money will still exist under socialism (for the first
period of it, until it evolves into true communism), and artists will
still get paid for what they contribute to society, and that is a good
thing. What allows people like the Beatles to make the money they

occasionally allow someone to make money who actually deserves it, as

labourers to do everything for eight bucks an hour, while they extract
millions in surplus value for themselves. In fact, it is capitalism that
sucked money AWAY from the Beatles' pockets, and put it into those of

thing about why the art was so great.

Making money you actually earned is not capitalism. Having money you've
earned stolen from you to fatten the wallets of your bosses is capitalism.

Yes, it's certainly true that some individuals were better than others.
But individuals are not the issue. The fact that capitalists and their
upper-middle-class bureaucratic cronies are driven by inexorable social
forces, AS A CLASS, to behave in certain selfish ways means that the

Wrong again. The fact is that they became who they did BECAUSE of the

How did Sgt. Pepper come about? It came about because they had the money and

That was only possible with the support of a major record label behind them.
