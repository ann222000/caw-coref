Explanation

Idea Stock Exchange: An online debate forum. Google organize websites, but I would like to organize ideas. This website cuts out the middle man; the people who design websites and organize ideas. This website will make money, like Google, with advertising. However, it will rank ideas (with a computer programming algorithm) instead of web pages.

Categories

We are drowning in information, we need some way of organizing it

This web will help people resolve conflict because it can also help people keep track of information. Every idea will be organized into categories like the ones you see on the right. The principle of competition between ideas, would make you want to put your idea in the right category, to make sure that it is seen the most.

Lots of web sites seek to express positions, and the reasons for believing them. However no web site has yet sought to address all truth. On this web site all information will end up as a support for some opinion. We are drowning in information, but the problem is not too much information, it is that we have now way of dealing with it, all at once, or outside of some context.

You go to one person’s web site to learn what Rush Limbaugh thinks; you go to another web site to learn what Al Gore thinks. You go to another web site to learn what Abraham Lincoln once said. There has never been any attempt to summarize the knowledge of the world into one whole. However with a million hands, and a system that promotes the survival of the fittest idea, that keeps getting better, conflicts will solve themselves magically. While you sleep, thousands of people will be working on a solution. Highlights of the worlds best essays, newspaper articles, books, speeches, and debates will evolve into a united whole. This web site will become a great frame of reference. We can look at the best reasons for believing or not believing anything.

Conflict

I would also have a spot on the web for conflicts of specific parties. There are many parties that are in conflict such as All Gore and George bush, or the Israelis and the Palestinians. In other parts of my web site I would try to address the “problem of violence in the middle east” without making it a case of group a vs. group b. Assuming that these portions of my web site we have already tried to list all of the interest of every individual party we can go forward with addressing the conflicts between specific groups. This section of the web site would address conflicts in which violence is taking place, or certain groups have declared other groups as their enemy. This part of the web site may have to be framed in a conflict between group A and group B manor.

The purpose of this side of the group is to lesson the tension between these groups and to increase understanding.

Extreme care will need to be used in making this portion of the web site most productive. Some groups in side this portion of the site have killed the members of the other side of their conflict. Emotions will run very high. But even if this was nothing more than a discussion board in which appeasing sides could vent their frustration, some good may be done. However I believe we can do much better than that. Again we must follow the principles of successful dispute resolution.

Getting to yes teaches us that we all have mutually overlapping common interest, and it is best if both sides of a dispute physiologically work together against a problem instead of working against each other. However we must be realistic and acknowledge the guns that different groups have pointed at each other. This web site can do some things to help these groups too.

On the front page of this portion of the sight we will have a list of common interest, goals, and values. Perhaps before you can vote or submit conflicting goals, interest, or values, you will have to vote on weather you agree or disagree with the top ten positions of your advisory.

There are many advantages of having a spot for violent debates. This would help focus interest on the issues that need the most attention. Common interest, goals, and values between groups that are fighting can be discussed.

A possible problem comes with the freedom of anonymity. People may feel too free to express malicious ideas. In addition traditional problems will arise between people as the work their way to the real issue, and deal with roadblocks in the dynamic exchange of ideas. Creating a way that the people on the site can regulate themselves could solve this problem. One way to create a web site that allows freedom, but is self-regulating would be direct people in the way of evaluating solutions, interest, and goals. We could ask people if the way the solution, interest, or goal was worded might cause people problems. Perhaps someone worded their position in a partisan way, or maybe used hostile emotions. Each of these separate issues could be a plus or minus, that sends your idea up or down the slide. Questions could be asked such as, “Is this action consistent with principles? Which ones?” If people know before hand the criteria with which their ideas will be judged, they will frame their
comments in the best way.

Chat rooms

If you want to speak to someone in a chat room about an issue, you will probably just find high school kids talking about Brittany Spears.
Ever time you have a discussion with a new person, you have to start at ground zero, as though now one had ever argued that issue before. This sucks.
Reasons to agree:
It is as though we are so self-righteous as to believe that no one else besides us has ever argued about certain ideas, and we don’t care what they said. It is very presumptuous of us to think that we can find truth, independent of what the rest of the world thinks. Every issue should have it's own website with a comprehensive list of reasons to agree or disagree.
This problem with chat rooms makes you start over, with every discussion you have. Any advances you make in understanding will be lost when you turn of the chat window. What would happen to science if scientist followed this method? What if every scientific record was written in a format that could not be re-traced or examined for those of other generations? What if scientist wrote everything in sand? People have been arguing about things for thousands of years. Why do we always have to start at ground zero, when we meet someone and want to discuss issues. As we start thinking about this, we can see why a web site like the history channel may want to adopt it. What does Abraham Lincoln have to say about issues we are facing today?

Database

Database of user background—know history and context of person writing the ideas—explain why this is good) Perhaps the comments from the Chinese concerning their interest will only be able to be evaluated from other Chinese.

Experts

Perhaps we could have a portion of the web site that high lightens the issues that have the biggest discrepancies between experts and the masses. One option for deciding who experts are will be to let professors at colleges be experts in their field. We could ask colleges to keep us updated with a list of professors, and their user-names. We could inter this into the data base, and the computer will do the rest, giving them the ability to have more status in their field.

Explanation of this website.

This website promotes the best ideas like Google promotes the best websites. It does this with two technologies.

The first is a computer algorithm. This algorithm could advance ideas that:

tend to have the highest ratio of number of reasons to agree vs. reasons to disagree with them,

tend to have higher ranking links of websites that agree with the idea, than the rank of links that disagree with the idea. For instance, if someone puts a link to a statement by the union of concerned scientist, from their website, it would have a higher weight than someone with a link to a personal website.

tend to have members who agree with it who have more education. This would be easy to do by maintaining a list of e-mail address of professors from different schools. You could say a professor's vote counts as two. Universities could publish the e-mail addresses of different departments so professors only had more weight in their area of expertise.

The second is the use of specific categories that facilitate the complete analysis of a particular idea. These categories could include the following categories for discussion of a particular idea:

reasons to agree and disagree with each idea,

common and apposing interest of those who agree or disagree with an idea,

probable motives of those who agree or disagree with an idea,

best &quot;things&quot; that agree or disagree, such as books, websites, songs, etc.
This website cuts out the middle man, the people who design websites, and organize ideas.

Every editorial ever written should be put onto this web page. The online community could then brainstorm reasons to agree and disagree with each assertion.

An IEO (idea executive officers) could be in charge of a position for a year. For instance

Senator McCain could be the IEO for the Campaign Finance reform bill.

The best democracy ?

The Dewey decimal system of ideas,

A way of compiling all the best ideas about every subject,

Slash-dot of opinions

Online debate forum

Stock Exchange of Ideas

A place where anyone can post their beliefs and reasons for believing them.

You can vote on weather or not you agree with a view, or any of the reasons why people believe something.

A big discussion boards.

A place to post problems on the internet, and then brainstorm with the online community possible solutions to those problems.

In a sentence it is a place where anyone can post their beliefs and reasons for believing them. But you may have already seen other discussion boards, and you may ask why this one is any different. My answer to that would be that through the miracle of modern technology we are able to allow you to vote on weather or not you agree with a view, or any of the reasons why people believe something.

Media

1. This web site is currently looking for a media partner.

A TV station like KBOI has a pretty good web site. Maybe they are local enough to give something like this a try. Of course it would be perfect if yahoo adopted this approach to their discussion boards. It would be my ideal situation of they e-mailed me and asked me to work with them on the project.

2. This web site also needs people to submit my beliefs.

I have tried to fill in as many reasons for believing as many things as possible but I am only one person.

3. I would like some assistance from people who know a lot about web design.

I could pay a little bit of money for some help. All I need is for a way for these pages to be self sufficient. I need people to be able to log in. For them to be able to vote, and for the votes with the highest percentage of agreement to go to the top. Now that shouldn't be too difficult?

This will lead to much better understanding of the issues that we face as humanity. It will replace the Opinion/Editorial function of newspapers, and political commentary web sites from people who have biases toward one opinion or another.

Problems with newspapers, websites, TV, the radio and other written forms of argument.

When someone reads an opinion on a piece of paper it is as though the writer has taken the reader into a dark ally where no one can hear, dispute or correct the things that are being said.
There is no give and take between different sides.
One said monopolizes the readers attention.
The opposing side, does not get to insert links to facts that dispute claims.
The apposing side is essentially locked out.
We often advocate transparency in government. We want to see what is happening and what causes people to make decisions. However when ever you write something down in a newspaper, you are forcing the reader to hear that opinion in a non natural form, where the apposing side does not have a chance to disagree.
All opinions should be written on the internet, where people can come along and add hyper links to all the reasons to agree or disagree. This will expose journalist to the same &quot;transparency&quot; that they have been preaching to everyone but themselves. This allow people to respond instantyly to stupid things that are said. And no, the &quot;discuss this article&quot; at the bottom of online postings does not count. Every sentence needs to have the ability to have reasons to agree or disagree, not just a chat room that goes away after some amount of time.

We would have a section of this page designated to news events. People could see how news events fit into the framework of why people do things. You could see where a news event is used by people of evidense for certain courses of action. News in and of itself doesn’t do any good. The fact that people are dying in Africa because of aids does nothing unless its used as a specific reason for a specific course of action. Right now the news media acts like a lawer, telling each side what the other side said, often getting things wrong, creating distrust and confusion on both sides of the isle.

The media, much like a lawyer, has the motivation for money, not just the best solution. They don’t necessarily want the republicans and democrats to find the best solution: they want a juicy story. They want to come up with the weeks list of &quot;winners and losers&quot; to fit into their &quot;oversimplified&quot;&quot;dummied-down&quot; story line. The US News even weekly section entitled: Winners and Losers. In this role the media plays the person who whispers in each contestants ear what the other person said about them, and tells the unwitting partisan to go duke it out in one more round.
Why do we rely on the media to tell us what the issues are and what we should think about them?

The source of conflict is that we do not understand and therefore accept other people's reasons for doing things.

Reasons to agree:

People’s reasons for doing things come from their values and their needs. These values and needs help people decide what should be done with problems that they face.

The principles of dispute resolution can be applied anywhere people have conflict as long as they are willing to meet at a common table and discuss their differences. The internet is the largest &quot;table&quot; at which mankind has ever met, and thus offers great opportunities for conflict resolution. However communication on the Internet will only bring people together to the degree that they follow the principles of successful dispute resolution. I believe that an arena can be built on the Internet that will naturally promote successful dispute resolution. The online community should create a list of all of the possible solutions to the problems that they face.
Reasons to agreeReasons to disagree
This fulfills a technique taught in getting to yes, “generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do.”
This website will become a way of sharing, and debating the validity of ideas on these list.
However with a million hands, and a system that promotes the survival of the fittest idea, that keeps getting better, conflicts will solve themselves magically.
Reasons to agree:
While you sleep thousands of people will be working on a solution. Highlights of the worlds best essays, newspaper articles, books, speeches, and debates will evolve into a united whole. This web site will become a great frame of reference. We can look at the best reasons for believing or not believing anything.

People from each side could list their interest and goals.
Reasons to disagree
These lists would become too large.
People could be allowed to vote on weather or not certain interest or solutions to a problem are valid. The interests that are the most valid could rise to the top. This would make the site user-friendlier.
Reasons to agree:
Perhaps the comments from the Chinese concerning their interest will only be able to be evaluated from other Chinese.

The evaluation of ideas on the site would be in line with another method taught in Getting to Yes; to separate the people from the problem.
When someone is voting on weather or not they agree with something someone has said, they can only vote on it because of the merits of what was said, because they will not know the person who said it.

Having people list their interest with respect to a specific problem, would meet the criteria for successful negotiation to focus on interest, not positions.
This would help confronting sides understand each other better.
This web site will constantly update itself. This web site has a dynamic ability to stay current. What’s popular one day may not be popular another day.
This web site will be able to do many things that no mediator could do. It can track the opinions of millions of people.
It can keep people from voting twice, by having them log in.
Also your votes could be tracked. This information could be used for a variety of purposes such as the political campaign. For instance if you wanted to run for election you could instantly publish your specific opinion on hundreds of issues. If a large number of voters had this information for one candidate, it could force other candidates to follow suit. This could force politicians to be specific, cutting down on annoying one issue adds.
This web site would also be a sociologist dream come true. No more calling people and asking questions. Sociologist could join the effort, and help ask better questions. Polling agencies could also get involved. Sociologist could track trends as people age, or according to their location, sex, race, or any other information.
This could go a long way towards an on line democracy.
Mediators and lawyers could also use this web site to learn from how other problems are being solved.
This web will help people resolve conflict because it can also help people keep track of information. Lots of web sites seek to express positions, and the reasons for believing them. However no web site has yet sought to address all truth. On this web site all information would end up as a support for some opinion. We are drowning in information, but the problem is not too much information, it is that we have now way of dealing with it.
Reasons to agree:
You go to one person’s web site to learn what rush Limbaugh thinks; you go to another web site to learn what All Gore thinks. You go to another web site to learn what Abraham Lincoln once said. There has never been any attempt to summarize the knowledge of the world into one whole.

We should create a computer algorithm that represents an idea's score. This idea organizing algorithm is meant to organize ideas just like Google organizes websites (putting the best at the top). This website will promote quality. The idea score is based on an algorithm that takes into consideration these factors:

Quantity of reasons that agree or disagree with the idea: The side with more reasons (to agree or disagree) would get more points than the other side. For example this idea has more reasons to agree than disagree. Just like when you fill out a list of reasons to or not to do certain activities, you tend to choose the side with more reasons to agree.
Number of people who agree or disagree with the idea: The side with more people who agree should get more points. People could vote for or against ideas.
The website with better web links. Better is determined by Google rank. There would be a field where you could enter link that &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;disagree&quot; with the idea. The side with better web links would win. Example
Results of peer evaluations: Their would be forms that people would fill out that asked pointed questions about each idea. You could respond to each question on a scale from 1 to 10. These results would affect the total score for each idea.
Money. &quot;Follow the money.&quot; People could donate money to this website if they believe in it. But a better way of doing it would be to let people donate money towards a specific idea. If you don't like the way this sounds you should read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. I'll just briefly say that money is the only way of measuring someone's blood, sweat, and tears. Money is the only way that someone can pay someone else for their work. Also, it could be used on this website as tug of war analogue. Money could be donated to each side of an idea.
Experts. Each idea would get more points if it was submitted from the e-mail address of a professor with a degree in the subject mater that is being discussed. For instance if someone said that Abraham Lincoln was an idiot. And someone disagreed, and someone else agreed. If the person that disagreed had a degree in history and the idea was submitted to the history section, then the person who disagreed (the professor) would win. The more prestigious the school, the more points. Prestigious would be ranked by the US News report, or some other un-biased judge. I don't care about you people that say, &quot;The smartest people don't always make the best decisions.&quot; We are talking about percentages. Of course the smartest people don't always make the best decisions, but they would tend to make better decisions that stupid or uneducated people.
Items that agree. People would be able to submit books that they think are important to read to make an educated decision about a certain topic. For instance &quot;The communist manifesto&quot; by Carl Marx and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; by Ian Rand may be considered to be the most important books to read regarding weather or not we should raise taxes. Those that had read those books, should have more say on this idea than those who have not, because this website desided that those books are very important to understand to make a decision about this issue. But the algorithm could go deeper. We are only just beginning to enter the rabit hole. We could let people who have read these books submit essays on them (like book reports in school). The people with a higher &quot;grade&quot; on their essays would get more say in those issues that people have said that those books are important.

The goal of the algorithm is to put the best ideas to the top. I don't know which one of these would carry more weight. For instance should experts or web links carry more weight?

I think it would be cool if each user could say which things they want to pay attention to. That way if one user respects authorizes, like people with degrees.

If every one gets a vote on which books you should be an authority in a subject, than why shouldn't those who wrote a book reports on those books be given more authority in that subject?

I’m very sorry I deleted any of your annotations, I am new at this website, that is the only excuse I can give, and I promise I will not delete any more.

If every one gets a vote on which books you should be an authority in a subject, than why shouldn't those who wrote a book reports on those books be given more authority in that subject?

&quot;If an idea that has certain intrinsically good aspects is presented in a manner that for the most part will tend to garner a negative vote, it will be seen as a bad idea before even any further depth can be ascertained. That is, not as many people will be interested in viewing it objectively, or even at all, given an initial coating of negative feedback.&quot;

And how would my algorithm do this worse than any other website? I actually think that that could be worked into the algorithm, that if you bought into an idea before it was popular, than you would be given more credit.

&quot;Quantity of Reasons: Unworkable&quot;

How is it unworkable? A computer counts the number of ideas, not too difficult.

&quot;Impractical&quot; Why?

&quot;not qualitative&quot; I address quality with other parts of the algorithm.

&quot;not representative,&quot; Why? Don't just make up accusations, defend them

&quot;open to abuse,&quot; Every system is open to abuse. If you punish those who commit this abuse, or remove the rewards for abuse, do you think it would stop?

&quot;promotes low standards of morality,&quot; How so? What does that mean?

&quot;ill-conceived,&quot; Gosh, what did I say that made you so mad?

&quot;requires vetting of reasons for validity,&quot; That's the whole point

&quot;Money: &quot;Oil is the only effective fuel for today's energy needs&quot; - Paid for on behalf of the members of OPEC by the Members of OPEC. Lot's of reasons for this one too.&quot;

I would have a place where people evaluate the motivation of those who agree and those who disagree.

&quot;Authority: Again, how do we ensure that a person's supposed authority is real, and, if it is, that it relates to the idea in question?&quot;

Give me a chance and I would explain. I thought that we could maintain a list of professors along with the subjects they teach. I think this would be pretty easy to get off of the schools official website.

&quot;For example, does a professor in Ancient Egyptian history score more points than a boot scrubber who lived through the Second World War on an idea about Fascism?&quot;

I don't understand the comparison. Why not compare a professor who had a degree in current history? The system is not completely developed. It is just an idea of mine. I did not write it out in precise and vivid detail. You can make up a stupid way of implementing my idea, and then say it is stupid, but I never advocated that method. Yes your guy who &quot;lived through WWII&quot; might be better, but I'm looking at statistics. Statistically speaking wouldn't you rather have someone with a degree in economics making decisions about economics than someone who has never heard of economic (see it's easy to when an argument you exaggerate).

Conflict Management Method
1. Decide to treat others with respect and use the skills:

State your opinion breifly
Pause
Reflect to Yes

2. Summerize needs, issues or values
The IEO can sumerize the needs of people making the arguements. He can play a phsycologist trying to give additional analaysis of the ideas. (Perhaps people can bet on certain ideas. People can make a game out of it like a stock exchange, and make money on it.)

Values: The IEO can sumerize the main categories (PRINCIPALS, values) that ideas go into.

3. The IEO can also problem solve if necisary.
Double check on needs. Ask for the involvment of those who'se opinions end up in the top 10.
List alternatives to the solutions that the top ten come up with.
Decid on solution.

Identifying real needs during conflict. Ideas that get less than 1% agreement can be discarded if the ieo feels that they are invalid reasing

Reward those who have the most people agree with them. Reward those who propose solutions.

Each issue should have a link for agree: disagree: and solotions. Each of these then becomes a new item for evaluaton.

People have been un-able to chose definatly if abortion should be legal or not. Perhaps people should
1. Not act outraged with those who disagree.
2. Make sure that love is shown those who do have abortions.'
3. Prevent as many people from getting pregnant as possible.
4. Let people in each state figure out what they want. If some people think it is moraly irrisponsible to have abortions and they don't want their kids influenced by those who think it is allright, maybe they have a right to that. Let each state decide. If that states that allow abortion go to pot, then we know that perhaps it was a bad Idea.

Potential problems.
The states that allow abortion will probably also alow prostitution, drugs, and alcohal. And who is to say which one of these caused there state to go to pot.

Follow up:
Since the laws haven't changed we can't really observe things very well. We'll follow up when and if they change.

Each year the IEO and the people that have the highest number of agreement inside their catigory get together and make a new home page for their issue.

A 9 month brain stom session, 3 months of solution finding.

Result based listening
Explore
Reflect until you understand the problems

Transition:
State the problem
State the goal
Ask what's been though of or done
Reflect

Resolve
Ask f your input is wanted
Speak
Check
Reflect
Summarize commitment
schedule follow up

Action

Self Feedback
Ask about strengths
* What went well?
*What made it go well?
Reflect

Ask about improvements
*what didn't go as well as you'd hoped?
*What would you do differently next time?
Refelect

Maybe before you disagree with someone you have to put into your own words exactly which part you disagreed with. You could do this by highlighting or bolding the part that you disagree with.

Perhaps people who have their comments evaluated could have special consideration in avaluating weather or not the person who disagreed got their statement right.

You could be verty specivic about what you disagree with something.
Psycologist could help out in this section.

These people are arguing two different things (this would reflect badly on ther person who made the last comment.)

This could all be software that people who want to argue download.

Why don't schools get involved in making something like this.

Take this to BSU president.

Each agreement should have a list of possible obstacles. Also a summary and follow up session, to see what happened in the real world.
