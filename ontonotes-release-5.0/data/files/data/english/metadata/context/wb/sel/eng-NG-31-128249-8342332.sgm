Dear All,

Below are 2 items and a book review. I really hadn’t intended to distribute materials today, but these are too important, I feel, to be ignored. The first item gives you an inkling of how Israel’s leaders tend to their flocks. The second relates an event all to common in the OPT, and the reason that it is all to common is because no one in the Israeli government and military care any more about what soldiers do to Palestinians than the Nazis cared about what their soldiers did to Jews. Israeli soldiers get by with murder—literally, and while human rights groups complain, nothing changes. The killings, the harassment, the inhumane rule. I reserve my comments on the book review for the final section.

MK: Monthly grant for Holocaust survivors a 'mockery'

http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/887889.html

Hebrew: http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/887884.html

[The Hebrew title is “The Chairperson of the Holocaust Survivors Organization: The State prefers the biological solution to our distress,” and continues with statistics: “Every year 10% of the Holocaust Survivors die: the state approved a grant of less than 100 shekel (roughly $20.00) a month for 120,000 needy survivors in their 70s and older . . . “ According to this evening’s TV news on channels 1 and 10, the payments are not due to begin till 2008, after which the grant will rise yearly till 2010—in 2009 it will be 160 shekel presumably. Olmert, by the way, looked as smug as ever when he declared that by contrast to previous years, his government is righting the injustice done to the survivors for 60 years by giving them a grant. Is he so stupid as not to realize that 80 shekel a month more can’t purchase medications and won’t stop the most needy from having to depend on soup kitchens or rummaging for food in garbage cans. It’s pitiful to see an elderly ill man—a survivor of horrors-- saying that all he can afford to buy is chicken wings. For a country that rose from the ashes of the Holocaust and which has made the Holocaust into an industry, to treat the survivors in this manner is worse than shameful. It is disgustingly revolting. But that’s Israel’s leaders—human life counts for naught!]

By Barak Ravid, Haaretz Correspondent

Chairwoman of the Knesset lobby for Holocaust survivors, Labor MK Colette Avital, condemned on Monday the monthly allowance the government has decided to grant 120,000 survivors.

The decision is applicable to 120,000 survivors over the age of 70 who receive old age allowances. Each person can expect to receive NIS 83 per month in the first year, a sum which will increase gradually until 2011.

Avital called the decision a &quot;mockery.&quot;

&quot;Are one thousand shekels a year meant to solve the distress, the hunger and the need for medicine and assistance?&quot; Avital asked.

Prime Minister Ehud Olmert announced Monday that Holocaust survivors over the age of 70 living in Israel will receive a special benefit to supplement their pensions and National Insurance allowances.

In line with the decision, the state will allocate NIS 120 million to the fund in 2008, a sum that will be doubled in 2009, and eventually reach more than NIS 300 million by 2011.

&quot;It's a mockery,&quot; said Gita Koifman, 68, from Kiryat Motzkin. Koifman is a Ukranian Holocaust survivor, and chairwoman of an organization representing concentration camp and ghetto survivors.

&quot;Whoever decided that 100 shekels can help someone who lives on NIS 2,100 per month is apparently living in another country. The survivors we're talking about may not be hungry for bread, but they do need medicine that they can't buy for themselves. They skimp on things you wouldn't imagine. The government is laughing at the survivors.&quot;

In addition to the monthly grant, which will be paid through the National Insurance Institute, millions of shekels will be allocated by non-governmental sources. Some of this amount is to go to the Holocaust Survivors' Welfare Fund, which pays for survivors' medical treatment. The same Fund will receive an additional NIS 10 million from the government.

The decision evolved from conclusions and recommendations drawn up by an interministerial committee made up of Welfare Minister Yitzhak Herzog, Pensioners Minister Rafi Eitan and representatives from the health and finance ministries, National Insurance Institute and the Prime Minister's Office.

&quot;We are correcting a 60-year-old blight,&quot; Olmert said of the decision. &quot;Holocaust survivors living in Israel are entitled to live respectably without reaching a situation in which it is beyond their means to enjoy a hot meal.

&quot;The neglect of successive governments will not continue. It is important to see to it that Holocaust survivors receive these supplements and are able to live honorably.&quot;

Israeli Soldiers &quot;Execute&quot; what they Learn in Military School
Posted by Sami Awad on July 27th, 2007

http://samiawad.wordpress.com/2007/07/27/how-many-times-does-somethin...

Today I joined thousands of Palestinians in the burial of a nineteen year
old Palestinian boy who was beaten to death by Israeli soldiers; his name
was (and is) Jihad Al-Sha'er. In order to not have his story become a number
in the books of records, I decided to write it in this article.

Jihad's story should be a warning to all those who are losing their humanity
to the corruption of absolute power.

To give a clear picture of what happened, I talked to several villagers from
the village of Tiqua' where Jihad was from including some who eye witnessed
the incident and some very close friends that I respect and trust.

In the morning of July 26th Jihad left his home and headed up the street to
a nearby taxi stop. He was going to Bethlehem University to complete his
enrolment for the upcoming fall semester; on the other side of the taxi stop
stood an Israeli army Hummer. A soldier standing outside the army vehicle
called Jihad for no reason at all other than what seems to have been out of
boredom from standing in the hot summer heat. Jihad hesitantly walked to the
soldier who asked him for his identification card. Jihad only had his birth
certificate as part of the paperwork he was taking with him for
registration. Even though that is enough, the Israeli soldier, again from
what seems to be born of boredom began to taunt and then physically assault
Jihad. As the assaults grew, Jihad physically defended himself and a brawl
broke up between the two who could have easily been the same age. Seeing
this, four other Israeli soldiers from the same army vehicle jumped out and
began beating Jihad with their batons and the buds of their rifles. Even
after falling to the ground the beatings continued.Tens of Israeli army
jeeps came as reinforcement, for what? I truly don't know. Jihad was carried
in one of the army vehicles to an unknown location.

It is not known what happened after that but after several hours the Israeli
army called the Palestinian Red Crescent to &quot;pick up&quot; Jihad at one of army
checkpoints leading into Bethlehem. The ambulance picked up the body of a
dead nineteen year old.

A surplus of absolute power was given to these Israeli soldiers by their
commanders and government that led them (directly or not) to treat others as
a lesser form of a human being. This is not the first time and I am sad to
say will probably not be the last time such things happen.

As I thought about it more I asked myself what if in that evening, as the
soldiers were sitting in their base, one of them stood up expressed remorse
and regret for what had happened then how will the others react? How will
his commanders react?

If (big IF) there is enough pressure to open an investigation, the Israeli
army and government will claim this as a &quot;singular and tragic incident that
does not reflect the Israeli military,&quot; but the facts present a different
reality. What happened might be a &quot;unique / rare incident&quot; (every act of
violence and brutal killing is unique) but in reality, what is happening is
a clear reflection of the systemic demonizing that is embedded in the
Israeli military and political establishment.

==========================================
”Kovel's indictment is this: Israel is the most dangerous place on earth for Jews. It now has the largest gap between rich and poor in the whole industrialized world. Forty percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Half of the Israeli families cannot meet their monthly bills.” [below]

I not only agree with the above statement, but have myself been saying this publicly for at least three years. Israeli soldiers and Israel’s leaders are dangerous for Palestinians, and Israel is the most dangerous place in the western world for Jews. No where else have so many Jews died in violence since WWII. And they continue to because of their leaders’ continued hunger for land, placing expansion as a criterion above life. Israel has the money to support Holocaust survivors, and also has money for the social welfare of its citizens, but Israel’s leaders prefer to spend money on expansion rather than on the welfare of the people. Of course globalization also plays a part. The latest Bank of Israel report (April 16, 2007) paints a glowing picture—showing Israel to be thriving economically (the “GDP this past year grew by 5.1%”; “investment in Israel reached record levels,” etc). But while 19 families control 1/3 of the economy ( http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/884060.html ),

1 of every 3 Israeli children lives under the poverty line, as do 80,000 Holocaust survivors, as do 2/3 of the elderly. Moreover, 25% of Israelis forego medical care because they cannot afford it, and the rumor has it (channel 1 TV news reported this evening) that more cuts in social welfare are in the offing. One reason for the cutbacks is to create cheap labor, which globalization demands. Israel supplies enough of it to have become viable for outsourcing in certain fields. Another reason is that Israel’s leaders, while talking peace, are doing the opposite, expanding as fast as they can in the West Bank, and spending much funds on doing this.

I agree with everything that I can garner from the review below, except that I have no problem calling the single state Palestine. After all, that’s what this land was called all the centuries that Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived here in peace before Zionism raised its head. Why not revert to the name this land once bore for so long? More important, we need a country where all—whoever wishes to live on this blood-soaked land--can feel secure, can dream of a future with no wars, and parents can count not only on raising their children in a free society but on being buried by their offspring rather than as so often happens now, burying their 18 ,19, and 29 year olds—sacrificed on the alter of expansionism.

??? ???????? ????????? Review of Overcoming Zionism; Creating a Single Democratic State in Israel-Palestine, by Joel Kovel

Review of Overcoming Zionism; Creating a Single Democratic State in Israel-Palestine, by Joel Kovel http://www.ziopedia.org/ar/articles/zionism/review_of_overcoming_zion...

Michael Steven Smith

Wednesday, 18 July 2007

Joel Kovel has given us an impressive important book. The first printing of OVERCOMING ZIONISM sold out without a single review, major or otherwise. The Library of Congress, which has copies of nearly everything, still doesn't have it on its shelves. Neither does the library at Bard College, where he teaches. Nevertheless word of this extraordinary work is spreading. The taboo in the United States (not Israel) against seriously discussing and criticising Zionist Israel has been broken with the publication of Jimmy Carter's bold book labeling the situation in the Occupied Territories &quot;apartheid&quot; and with prestigious professors Walt and Merscheim's exposure in the London Times (it was turned down by the Atlantic Monthly) of the power of the Israeli lobby. I anticipate that OVERCOMING ZIONISM is going to get a long run. Kovel takes the discussion on how to &quot;overcome&quot; Zionism exactly where it ought to be and articulates how this may be accomplished. He writes beautifully, even poetically, not just on Zionism's sordid history, but on its ideology, its ethics, even on the terrible ecological devastation in Israel itself, where every river is polluted, some to lethal levels. And he writes with courage and hope.

Kovel believes that the creation of Israel in l948 as a colony of settlers who established an exclusively Jewish state has created a multi-faceted disaster, that it was &quot;a dreadful mistake&quot; and should be undone, with Israel de-Zionized and integrated into the middle east. His solution to achieve this is stated in the book's subtitle: Creating a Single Democratic State in Israel/Palestine.

Kovel's last chapter is captioned Palesreal: A Secular and Universal Democracy for Israel/Palestine. This is an elegant solution. He lays out an action program to accomplish this. How did Kovel, a Jew from Brooklyn, the oldest son of Ukrainian immigrants who did well, moving Joel and the family to &quot;the purgatory of Baldwin, Long Island&quot;, come to this radical critique and equally radical solution? Joel graduated from Yale and became a rising star in the medical profession. He taught at a medical school before giving it up, switching careers, and taking a social science professorship at Bard where for a time he held the Alger Hiss chair. He is still there, the only Marxist on the faculty. This book is not going to further his career. What kind of Jew am I, he asks, and answers &quot;a very bad one&quot;

More accurately he defines himself as what Isaac Deutscher called &quot;a non-Jewish Jew.&quot; Not that he is not spiritual. He writes of reaching for the infinite. But he is not religious. Being part of a sect is too narrowing and confining. He identifies with the Jewish heretics who transcended Jewry, but who are nonetheless part of the Jewish tradition, &quot;...starting with Spinoza, then Marx, Freud, Proust, Einstein, Kafka, Wittenstein and Rosa Luxemburg,&quot; the great geniuses of modern thought. He writes that like them, &quot;the true glory of being Jewish is to live on the margin and across boundaries.&quot; Kovel writes that for Jews, their ethical reference point is the tribal unit.

Since ancient times as hill people on land east of the Mediterranean they set themselves off as &quot;a people apart&quot;, chosen by Jehovah, with whom they have a covenant. In Kovel's view, &quot;&quot;...Zionism' s dynamic was drawn from the most tribal and particularistic stratum of Judaism, and its destiny became the restoration of tribalism in the guise of a modern, highly militarized and aggressive state&quot;, which they implanted in the center of Islam. Herein lies the tragedy.

At the turn of the l9th century, a Zionist conference in Vienna delegated several rabbi's to travel to Palestine on a fact finding mission. The rabbi's arrived and cabled back, &quot;the bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man&quot;. The Zionist Jews had &quot;a fantasied relationship to a mythic territory... .and that has been the fatal flaw in Zionism, both before and after the conquest,and why we call it, ungenerously but truthfully, a bad idea.&quot; Kovel writes incisively of what ensued and deserves to be quoted at length. &quot;A tremendous struggle would be necessary, therefore, if the Zionists were to dislodge these inhabitants, and only a tremendously concentrated desire could suffice to energize that struggle.&quot; There were great difficulties. &quot;...the resistance of those who stood in the way would have to be displaced; the exigencies of geo-politics; and one's own inner being, which would have to be retooled from the self-image of an ethical victim to that of a ruthless conqueror. All of these obstacles could be dealt with by signing on to Western imperialism and capitalism.&quot; Jewish suffering and persecution became justification for aggression in asserting the &quot;outlandish claim of a territory controlled 2500 years ago by one's putative ancestors.&quot;

The Israelis took 78% of the territory in l948 and another 14% in l967. The logic of Zionism - to create an ethnically pure Jewish state - led to organized terrorism; &quot;the essentials had been put in place by the mid-1930s&quot; and the opportunity came in l948.

The leaders of Zionism, Chaim Arlosoroff, Vladamir Jabotinsky, even and especially David Ben Gurion quietly articulated the need to drive the Arabs out. South African Prime Minister Henrik Verwoerd said in l96l something the liberals wouldn't: that the Zionists &quot;took Israel from the Arabs after the Arabs had lived there for a thousand years. In that, I agree with them, Israel, like South Africa, is an apartheid state.&quot;

When the smoke lifted in l948, 531 Arab villages had been destroyed, some 750,000 Palestinians driven out. Three Israeli Prime Ministers have been world class terrorists, bent on ridding Palestine of its natives.. In l948 Menachem Begin organized the dynamiting of the British headquarters in the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, killing 88 persons, including 15 Jews. That year also saw the terrorizing of the Villiage of Dier Yassin. With Begin in command, Yitzhak Shamir, who was also to become a PM, and whose frankly facist organization The Stern Gang, actually made overtures to the Nazi's to create a Jewish state along totalitarian lines, took part in the operation.

This most odious act of ethnic cleansing took place in the peaceable Arab village on April 9, l948. Under Begin's command, &quot;acting in collaboration with the Zionist leadership,&quot; ...&quot;an elite force descended on the village and systematically set about to slaughter its people, disemboweling a pregnant woman, raping others, taking prisoners and then shooting them, and not stopping until noon the next day when 93 villagers lay dead&quot;.

The terror at Dier Yassin was a decisive factor in the Arab exodus. The ethnic cleansing had been clearly planned by the Zionists leadership, as Israeli historian Ilan Pappe has documented (The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine). Thus the Zionists established Israel with a crime against humanity. The corrupt and now comatose Ariel Sharon, the third Israeli terrorist PM, was actually found guilty by an Israeli court for permitting the Sabra and Shatilla massacre in Lebanon in l982, where estimates are as high as 3000 Palestinian refugees were killed, mostly knifed to death by Lebanese falangists in their refugee camp with the facilitation of Sharon.

In l953 Sharon led a cross-border raid in Qibya, Jordan &quot;in which the community was reduced to rubble, with 45 houses blown up and 69 people killed, the majority women and children.&quot; He repeated his mass murder in Lebanon last year, using American made cluster bombs. [The 2006 Lebanese escapade was Olmert’s doing; Sharon was in the hospital comatose, but he was responsible for the 1st Lebanese war. D]It is truly remarkable, as Kovel points out, that a terrorist could ascend to national leadership three times and &quot;scarcely anybody has bothered to ponder its meaning.&quot;

Insightfully, Kovel writes that the ensuing bad conscience of the Israeli' and their &quot; resulting feelings become projected and turned into the blaming of others - whether these be expropriated Palestinians or critics of Israel, who become either anti-semites and/or that curious entity, the &quot;self-hating Jew.&quot;

Israel, as a racist state, discriminates in the critical areas of immigrants, settlements, and land development. Any Jew in the world who can show that his grandmother on his mother's side was Jewish may obtain automatic citizenship, yet the Arabs expelled in l948 and l967, despite international law and United Nations resolution 194, are not permitted their right to return. 92% of the land in Israel is administered by The Jewish National Fund, which does not allow its use by non-Jews.

Racism is in the nature of a colonial settler state. What is remarkable is the degree in which Zionists deny this. Kovel gives examples of a top Israeli general calling Palestinians &quot;drugged cockroaches in a bottle,&quot; he cites the 2006 poll where more than two- thirds of Israelis would refuse to live in the same building as Arabs, where the idea of transfering Arab citizens with voting rights out of the country is popular, and where soccer fans curse and attack Arab members of their national team.

But to admit of this racism would be to put Israel in the same camp as apartheid South Africa and deligitimatize it. Kovel writes, reminiscent of Thomas Jefferson, that no state has an absolute right to exist, hence all states are to some degree illigitimate, that states may be relatively or absolutely illegitimate, that a racist state is illegitimate, and Israel being an exclusively and discrimatory Jewish state is a racist state.

He concludes that &quot;The problem then is with Zionism and the Jewish state as such, and not its illegal occupation of the West Bank.&quot; The point he arrives at is to change it, &quot;to dissolve the Jewishness of the state. For this, one does not smash or trample Zionism; one overcomes it and frees people from it's chains.&quot;

He goes beyond the two-state solution, necessarily, because by steady aggression and agrandizement the Zionists have whittled the Palestinian territory down to 8% of the what it was in l948, leaving the natives with a negligible fragment, without much water, polluted, economically unviable, denuded of its agriculture, isolated by Israeli- only roads, and partly encircled by an obscene wall.

What to do?

Speak the truth about Israel. Expose the Zionist lobby. Force it to register as an agent of a foreign government. Bring lawsuits for violation of human rights, like the Center for Constitutional Rights did against an Israeli general for mass killing in a village, or another against the U.S. Caterpillar company for making gargantuan bulldozers sold wittingly to the Israeli army for the express purpose of house demolition, one of which, incidentally, ran over and murdered Rachel Corrie, to whom Kovel partly dedicates his book.

Place Israel where it belongs, in the company of apartheid South Africa. Cut the threads of Israel's support system, boycott it academically, economically, and culturally. Palestinians are the largest and oldest refugee population in the world.

Central to the campaign against Zionist Israel is to support their right of return. Zionism can thus be brought down in an entirely peaceful manner. The Right of Return is more basic than liquidating the occupation, which would leave the Zionist state unchanged. The Right of Return would require the end of the occupation as a pre-condition and can directly undo the Jewishness of the state with the returnees having full and equal rights. Even now, counting the occupied territories, the population is roughly 50/50, Jew and Arab.

Kovel calls the new state &quot;Palisrael&quot;. This new entity could reshape itself according to the precepts of recognition and responsibility, which points to a society organized along essentially non-capitalist lines. He asks, &quot;What else is a true democracy except a form of society in which people collectively self-determine their lives, and therefore their means of producing that life? Joel Kovel knows that this &quot;will not come for a long time, perhaps it will never come, given the awesome wealth and power at the command of the empire, and its craven press, cowed public,and corruptred political consciousness. Or perhaps it will...Given the larger meaning of Israel, its fate will depend on the convulsions awaiting the world system, upheavals whose content cannot be precisely forseen....&quot;

He concludes: &quot;Such is the reality facing dreamers for a better world: a slim chance, and a long haul. As ever, it is the journey that counts, the seeking of good conscience, good will, and good comrades.&quot;

It is difficult to review this rich multi-layered book in a short review. Much had to be passed over, like the Zionists collaboration with the Nazi's in the thirties, their forcing Jews in the deplaced persons camps in Europe to immigrate to Israel, their misuse of the holocaust, the interpenetration of the governments of Israel and America and the services to imperialism the Israelis give, like their support of the Contra wars, the Zionist lobby, the acquiring of the atomic bomb by Israel, which Kovel sees as the single greatest barrier to nuclear non-proliferation.

Kovel's background as a psychiatrist is evident in his wise understanding. Judaeophobia in Nazi Germany &quot;draws from a time when Jews were, if not blameless, at least powerless and were made to pay the debts demanded by the anti-communism of the facist state and by Christendom' s bad conscience.&quot;

He calls it &quot;intellectual barbarism&quot; to take current Arab criticism of Israel as &quot;anti-semitism&quot; , but he well understands that given the circumstances the Arabs have shown &quot;the whole spectrum of human response...ranging from emancipatory and nonviolent expression to crude atavisms including racist belief, and in the case where the invader is set up as a Jewish state, anti-semitism.”

He is widely read on the subject (the book has an excellent bibliography, with websites) and has traveled to Israel/Palestine. What kind of state have they wrought? Kovel's indictment is this: Israel is the most dangerous place on earth for Jews. It now has the largest gap between rich and poor in the whole industrialized world. Forty percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Half of the Israeli families cannot meet their monthly bills.

Kovel reports that the immediate cause of this has been a fierce neoliberal assault on the poor and the public sector. &quot; Israel provides the worst primary and lower secondary education in the Western world...&quot; Socialist ideals lie in ruins, &quot;with the extreme right-wing religious fundamentalists playing a far larger role in Israel than the enlighted socialism that was to have been the emblem of the new Jewish society.&quot;

As a result a serious amount of outmigration is taking place with in 2004 some 760,000 Israelis living abroad. Jews leaving Russian prefer, ironically, to go to Germany. I am sending OVERCOMING ZIONISM, to comrades and friends, including a political prisoner, where prison rules restrict to ten the number of books a prisoner can have in his cell. I think that if persons following the current discussion and concerned about the problems of Jews and Zionism and Israel and the Arabs and the middle-east, even world peace, could have but one book on the subject on their shelf, it should be this one.

Michael Steven Smith, author and New York City Attorney, worked in Israel in l959 and was a member of the National Lawyers Guild fact finding team just before the first intifada in l985. He returned and testified before a United Nations committee on human rights. His cousin, an Hungarian refugee from the Nazi's, was the last soldier to die in the l967 war. His youngest brother lives four miles from the Lebanese border.
