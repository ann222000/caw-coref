A reader sent me these questions that he said Christopher Hitchens
had posed. I then found them at his web site . They are:

1) Do you believe that a confrontation with Saddam Hussein's regime
was

inevitable or not?

2) Do you believe that a confrontation with an Uday/Qusay regime
would

have been better?

3) Do you know that Saddam's envoys were trying to buy a weapons

production line off the shelf from North Korea (vide the Kay report)
as

late as last March?

4) Why do you think Saddam offered "succor" (Mr. Clarke's word) to
the

man most wanted in the 1993 bombings in New York?

5) Would you have been in favor of lifting the "no fly zones" over

northern and southern Iraq; a 10-year prolongation of the original
"Gulf

War"?

6) Were you content to have Kurdish and Shiite resistance fighters do
all

the fighting for us?

7) Do you think that the timing of a confrontation should have been
left,

as it was in the past, for Baghdad to choose?

My reply would be simple. If you are arguing for war, you don't have
to ask all these fancy questions. There are really only two questions
you have to answer. The first is, would you yourself be willing to die
fighting for this cause you have espoused? The second is, would you be
willing to see your 18-year-old son or daughter killed for this cause?
(I do not ask if you would be glad or satisfied; I ask if you would be
willing).

My answer with regard to the aftermath of September 11 and defeating
al-Qaeda in Afghanistan is, yes, I would have been willing to go fight
and die myself to protect my country from another such attack. And, had
my son been of age and had he enlisted after September 11, I could have
accepted that and everything it entailed.

With regard to Iraq, the answer to both questions in my case is "no."
I would not have been willing to risk my own life to dislodge Saddam
Hussein from power. And, I would certainly not have been willing to see
my son risk his, nor would I like to see him ever sent to Iraq as a
draftee, because I believe the entire aftermath of the war has been
handled with gross incompetence, and I certainly don't want my flesh and
blood mauled by the machinations of Richard Perle and his buddies.

With regard to Mr. Hitchens's questions, most of them are logical
fallacies, of the same form as "have you stopped beating your wife?"
There are some questions that are traps. For instance, there are many
reasons for which Saddam might have harbored one person wanted in
connection with the first world trade center bombing that are not
particularly sinister. It certainly is untrue that Saddam had anything
to do with that bombing. It was done by al-Qaeda. The question is a
trick because it tries to lead the reader in a particular direction,
even though the evidence does not.

Likewise, ' Do you think that the timing of a confrontation should
have been left, as it was in the past, for Baghdad to choose? ' is
further instance of beging the question . The question is posed in such
a way as to make the reader accept that there must have been a
"confrontation" between the Baath military and the US. Gen. Zinni
thought there would never have been any such thing, and that Saddam was
contained. Gen. Zinni is not a milquetoast. Iraq had a weak army, a
paralyzed command structure, rusting equipment, and could not even hold
out in its own country against the US for more than a few days when the
US launched a "confrontation." So the question can be rejected, since
there may never have been such a confrontation. And, if there was, it
seems obvious that the US could always win it hands down. That being the
case, the US was never in any danger from the Saddam regime, which was a
toothless old lion with rheumatoid arthritis and bad breath.

These word games are inconsequential. Do you, Abraham-like, offer up
your first-born at this altar? That's what nearly a thousand US military
families have done with regard to deaths, and thousands more with regard
to permanent maimings and cripplings, and what yet thousands more are
likely to be asked to do. If it had been me, I wouldn't have ordered
them to do it, not in Iraq.

Another question we could throw back at Mr. Hitchens (who, it seems
to me, isn't actually doing much for the war effort in Iraq), is
whether, if you could only capture one, would you rather have Saddam
Hussein in custody, or Usama Bin Laden? Given what we know Usama is
planning, I opt for putting all our efforts and I mean all our efforts
into capturing him tout de suite. Chasing around Iraq after Salafis and
Mahdists doesn't make the homeland even one whit safer.
