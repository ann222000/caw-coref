Been out of touch for a while.

Bailey has moved up to her sisters 96 XR 200 as she outgrew her 2002 XR100.
So now I need to rebuild the forks for her on the 200.

I have them out, and have pulled the caps off of the tops and removed the
spacers and springs.  I have removed the clips that hold the seals in.  So -
what is it that keeps the tubes connected to the lower legs?  Should I just
be able to force the seals out now by pulling the tubes out of the lower
legs?

Anybody got any suggestions on aftermarket springs or other goodies for
these forks while I have them apart?  Any trick conversions for the front
end of an XR200?

Thanks!

Tom

How timely, I just did the forks on a '97 XR200 this weekend.

Before the tubes will come apart, you need to remove the damper rod.
These aren't cartridge forks.  You need to take out the bolt on the
bottom of the tubes.  This is best done with an impact wrench.  A
holder on the top side of the damper rods may still be required.  It
takes a large hex, or I build my own tool by carefully grinding down
a strip of 1/8" steel strip so that it just fit into two points of the hex.

I put gold valve cartridge emulators into the forks.  This requires you
to drill six 5/16 holes in the bottom of the damper rod to replace the
four small holes that are already there.  To keep the same preload,
you will have to cut some PVC about 1/2" shorter than the existing
spacer (the emulator fits between the spring &amp; the damper rod).
The emulators should really smooth out the harshness that lighter
riders will feel in the rocks.

The oil in our bike was original.  It was pretty black, even tho the
bike has seen little use.  I put in Honda 5W fork oil.

Good luck Tom.  Let me know how it works out.

Are those conventional forks?

I have used a broom handle and friction as a backup "holder" inside
when working  on conventional forks in the past, when necessary.

Just a thought, as this requires thorough cleaning afterword to remove
any possible wood (wud) debris.

Yup, that was what I was getting ready to do.  While looking over
my scrap material shelf for a wood dowel, I spotted some 1" wide
x 1/8" thick steel strap.  I removed about .080" from the width &amp;
it fit perfectly into the slot.  The only drawback is that it flexes
a bit in torsion, requiring an impact wrench to reseat the rod.

I ended up making a tool today for this.

I rummaged around in my shop and found a motor mount bolt (i believe that's
what it is) from my TT600 that  I parted.  The hex end of it looked about
the right size to I attached it to a pice of PVC with some tape to get it
long enough to stick down into the tube with and - yep - perfect fit on the
inside hex end of that tube that's down there.   So then I found that a
piece of 1/2" copper plumbing pipe is about the exact diameter of the bolt.
So I connected the two together with a copper pipe splice joint I had too,
and then added a hex fitting at the other end to put a wrench on and viola -
new fork disassembly tool.  Worked great.

So - what's the free length of the springs supposed to be?

Thanks Jeff.

Race Tech makes the Goldvalve Cartridge Emulator.  My '97 uses p/n FEGV3501

Don't know on spring length.  It would be in the service manual.  Why do you
need to know?  In my experience, an OEM spring will never take a set or
"sack out".

What you really want to measure is the sag.  The sag with geared-up rider on
the bike should be ~1/3 of the total travel.  You should adjust the spring
spacer to get the correct amount of sag.  The stock spacer on the XR200 is
~5" long.   This generates close to zero preload on the fork cap as your
remove it.

Tom,

The Gold Valve cartridge emulators are supplied by Race Tech, and are
available at any Tucker Rocky or Parts Unlimited affiliated motorcycle
dealer.

Cool tool!

The spring length, I can't help you with.  Unless you want to
"spring" (pun intended) for new springs, just preload your springs
about 5 to 10 mm.  Figure this as:  while you are screwing the cap
into the fork leg,  the cap needs to contact the springs between 5 &amp;
10 mm before  the cap bottoms out in the threads.

If you think you need heavier springs for the weight of the rider,
then do both ends, and go to the Race Tech web site, and put your
information in the "spring search" form.

Good Wrenching to you!

Like Deeney said, there is no preload at all on the caps when I removed
them.  The forks always seemed like they were soft, but then I am probably
too big for the bike anyway, and now I am rebuilding for a 110# rider.  Then
again - they have not had an adequate amount of oil in them for some time
either.  That was the other reason for the rebuild - the seals have had it.

When I trailer the bike, I can nearly sack out the front end entirely when I
strap it down.  The fender has a deep 'well' to it if you will, and that
adds to the sacked look.  I am thinking about getting an aftermarket fender
that isn't 3" deep where it mounts and that will at least make it look like
its got more travel..

I really just kind of assumed that the springs would be done on a 10 year
old bike.

Thanks guys for the help.

Nope.  Unless it's Chinese spring steel, coil springs do not sack out

I'm setting up our 200 for a rider of similar weight.

A friend of mine rides an XR200 in the winter.  Jim is 230#.  Other than
lack of power, he has few complaints about the suspension.

For the rear shock, the late 90's models are not rebuildable.  This
was a step backwards.  I'm going to keep an eye out for one of
the older shocks that have a remote reservoir and are rebuildable.

Either put some air bleeders on the forks (to allow the release of
pressure when the bike is tied down), or purchase or construct a block
to go between the fender and tire, to take up the force of the tie
downs.

This gets the pressure off the seals during transport.

You can tie it down other ways...

First, I really like bike shoes the best.

This was my previous favorite method...
http://people.eku.edu/cornmanadm/db/Tiedown.jpg is extremely stable
and spreads the load front and rear. Put the eyebolts about 2 feet (or
a little less) apart and just in front of the attachment points on the
bike.

OK - So the guy that had the seals on Ebay also had a set of springs for it
too.  They are 23" long as opposed to the original 17.5".  Bought those from
him too.  He had them in his bike and really like what they did for the
front end.  He also added a 1.5" preload spacer on top.

I'll let you know how this all works out.

Tom,
Your statement brings serious questions to my mind.

Let me preface my question with the statement that I am no expert on
XR200 forks, and have no idea as to the unladen length of the springs.

&lt;now, the question&gt;
With the longer spacer and springs, the total "spring length" is
going to be  7" longer than stock. (23" - 17.5" = 5.5" + 1.5" = 7")
If your forks can't accommodate that much extra spring length, the
springs will bind under compression, and things won't work so well.

I suggest that the "ebay guy" has an older XR200R, with longer
travel suspension.    If so, that would be a good reason for the
spring being so much longer than stock.

Good Wrenching and Riding to You!

Good point! I'd suggest a quick calculation about the minimal length of
the assembly (wire diameter * number of windings + spacer &lt;= fork
travel) to avoid the cap popping off with the first harsh landing.

Safe riding to you!

Spring formulas are a bit complex.  A longer spring could be softer.
It all depends on the number of coils &amp; the wire diameter.  I was
astounded that the stock XR200 had a 5.5" long spacer.  It also had
a lot of coils on the spring.  Figuring out if a spring is going to bind
should be fairly straight forward.

&gt;Let me preface my question with the statement that I am no expert on

&gt;&lt;now, the question&gt;
&gt;  With the longer spacer and springs, the total &quot;spring length&quot; is

Tom,
Generally, when I go to change fork springs, I lay the old springs
on a piece of cardboard on a table and mark off the length of the
original spring, and at one end, I add the length of the spacer and
add another  mark.
I then lay the replacement spring, and it's spacer, on the cardboard
and compare the difference between the two set-ups.

Now, I adjust the length of the spacer to give me the same overall
length (adjusting +/- for how much pre-load that I want to give the
replacement springs).

This keeps me in the ball park on spring length, since I usually am
working with springs that are designed for ( or at least fit) the
application I am working on.

Depending on the length of your spacer, you may still be able to use
your "new" springs, by shortening (odd word, thing "cutting down")
your stock spacer.

Let us know what's happening.

If you were truly AHR, you might even go about measuring spring
rate.  This can be done by measuring the unloaded length first.
This you should measure the deflection under load.  This can be
done by placing the spring over a dowel of some time, then stacking
weights on top of the spring.   The spring constant is #/inch, or kg/mm.
If you had previously set up your bike sag, you need to set your spacer
so that the spring force at 1/3 of the suspension deflection is
comparable to what you had before.

Not that I've ever gone to these lengths...

Alternatively, you can calculate the spring rate based on the
dimensions.  The problem with this approach is that the spring
rate is dependent on the wire diameter to 3rd power.

A cool calculator can be found at
http://www.stockcarproducts.com/pstech10.htm

Play around with it and you can see that a small error in
measuring wire diameter will make a big difference in spring
rate.

I would use calculations to get close, but do measurements to
verify.

All these calculations brings to mind a comparison of the carrying capacity
of an African swallow vs. the European swallow... as it all has nothing to
do with anything...  I neglected to mention prior that I am supposed to
remove the original spacer, and replace with the smaller one.

He admitted though that he had used this setup for himself and he's 185#.
My wisp of a child Bailey will top out at a buck-ten soaking wet.

He also had ATF filled to within 4.5 inches from the top, with the forks
compressed and springs in.

So - I realize I am up for some dial-in, but I am going to start with a
short enough spacer to induce very little pre-load, and perhaps some 5 wt.
oil.

?!?!?!?

Fork oil level is always measured with the forks fully compressed, and no
springs.
I think I just set my 200 oil at 5" from the top.

That's the perfect approach.

While a lot of folks dis' the use of ATF, I liked to use it in my
old non-cartridge forks.  It holds up great under shear, has
anti-foaming agents, and great lubrication properties.  It is a
little thicker than 5W fork oil.

Good luck there.  If I can ever ride our bike, I'll let you know how it
works out.

Of course, once the suspension actually starts moving, heat is
generated in the oil generally originating at the valve stacks and
bushing interfaces.  These heat sources generate a voltage
differential through the piezoelectric properties of the oil,
ultimately setting up associated currents in the spring windings.  The
resultant electric field dynamically modulates effective spring rate,
thus rendering all previous calculations inadequate.
