uh... spontaneous? I guess if I mix rum and coke, I would get a

He didn't, then again I am not a creationist.

Have I used the wrong word?  By "spontaneous" I meant
that the reactions that Miller and Urey observed required
no outside manipulation on their part.  They created what
they believed were primitive earth like conditions and then
just watched for a week.

However in a strict chemical sense, maybe "spontaneous"
should be applied only to exergonic reactions - which the
Miller-Urey experiments were not.

Of course I agree, and don't personally believe that
God exists at all.

However I do feel the need to argue for my position and
treat each creationist as a reasonable person who wants
to get at the truth, not just engage in a shouting match.
So rather than make absolute statements like, "God didn't
create life", I prefer to say why I think that, and to show
what I think is missing in the arguments made by the
other side.

Thanks for the feedback.

His whole experiment was manipulation Scientist Stanley L. Miller,
working in the laboratory of Harold Urey, took hydrogen, ammonia,
methane, and water vapor (assuming that this had been the primitive
atmosphere), sealed these in a flask with boiling water at the bottom
(to represent an ocean), and zapped electric sparks (like lightning)
through the vapors. Within a week, there were traces of reddish goo,
which Miller analyzed and found to be rich in amino acids—the essence of
proteins. You may well have heard of this experiment because for years
it has been cited in science textbooks and school courses as if it
explains how life on earth began. But does it?

Actually, the value of Miller’s experiment is seriously questioned
today.  Nevertheless, its apparent success led to other tests that even
produced components found in nucleic acids (DNA or RNA). Specialists in
the field (sometimes called origin-of-life scientists) felt optimistic,
for they had seemingly replicated the first act of the molecular drama.
And it seemed as though laboratory versions of the remaining two acts
would follow. One chemistry professor claimed: “The explanation of the
origin of a primitive living system by evolutionary mechanisms is well
within sight.” And a science writer observed: “Pundits speculated that
scientists, like Mary Shelley’s Dr. Frankenstein, would shortly conjure
up living organisms in their laboratories and thereby demonstrate in
detail how genesis unfolded.” The mystery of the spontaneous origin of life.
In the years since, however, that optimism has evaporated. Decades have
passed, and life’s secrets remain elusive. Some 40 years after his
experiment, Professor Miller told Scientific American: “The problem of
the origin of life has turned out to be much more difficult than I, and
most other people, envisioned.” Other scientists share this change of
mood. For example, back in 1969, Professor of Biology Dean H. Kenyon
coauthored Biochemical Predestination. But more recently he concluded
that it is “fundamentally implausible that unassisted matter and energy
organized themselves into living systems.”

Your remark is akin," ignore the effects of a dirty bomb," just ignore
the source.  consider laboratory work bears out Kenyon’s assessment that
there is “a fundamental flaw in all current theories of the chemical
origins of life.” After Miller and others had synthesized amino acids,
scientists set out to make proteins and DNA, both of which are necessary
for life on earth. After thousands of experiments with so-called
prebiotic conditions, what was the outcome? The Mystery of Life’s
Origin: Reassessing Current Theories notes: “There is an impressive
contrast between the considerable success in synthesizing amino acids
and the consistent failure to synthesize protein and DNA.” The latter
efforts are characterized by “uniform failure.”

Realistically, the mystery encompasses more than how the first protein
and nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) molecules came into existence. It includes
how they work together. “It is only the partnership of the two molecules
that makes contemporary life on Earth possible,” says The New
Encyclopædia Britannica. Yet the encyclopedia notes that how that
partnership could come about remains “a critical and unsolved problem in
the origin of life.” True, indeed.

Appendix A, “Teamwork for Life” (pages 45-7), reviews some basic details
of the intriguing teamwork between protein and nucleic acids in our
cells. Even such a glimpse into the realm of our body cells elicits
admiration for the work of scientists in this field. They have shed
light on extraordinarily complex processes that few of us even think
about but that operate every moment of our lives. From another
standpoint, however, the staggering complexity and precision required
returns us to the question, How did all of this come about?
