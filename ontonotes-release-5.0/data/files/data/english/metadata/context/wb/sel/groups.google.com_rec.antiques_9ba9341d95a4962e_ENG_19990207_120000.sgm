What is the cut off year for ivory work. I often find old pieces in my
wonderings and was wondering what year they need to predate inorder to
offer them in the market.

Please email answers- don't get into the newsgroups often.

Thanks -

Dennis

"/>  If they are already in the country, you don't need to worry
about it. If you plan to sell them ancross national boundaries,
you DO have to make sure you can date them to pre-1972 (?) so
they will be &quot;grandfathered&quot; as pre-ban pieces.
The US Customs service site might have the rules in print.

It's a little-known fact that the Y1K problem caused the Dark Ages.
