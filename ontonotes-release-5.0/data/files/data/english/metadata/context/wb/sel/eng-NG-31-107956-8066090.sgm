No offense, but I'd rather see something different - it just looks

I really like it, at first then started thinking of it on the Parker.
Although very well done, and it would silk screen well I found the
skull design, a little typical. I might consider using other than the
typical human skull, and look for one, or something else that more
pinpoints you, your lifestyle, other hobbies, or even a characture of
your self to more &quot;personalize&quot; it. For instance, if you were a
Vikings fan, use a Viking skull, or you like to fish, a fish skull, if
you are Irish, a Leprechaun. At first I thought it should be more
complex, but the more I look at it, the more I like it, three color,
sharp and clean. Of course if you are only going to use it twice and
resell it you might want to stick with what you got as it is still
very nice;)

Don't take me wrong, I really like your design, just posting my
thoughts. Anyway, if you are interested, I could probably put it on a
silk screen for you to use on shirts, flags, or whatever. Been
thinking about breaking out a new bottle of opaque come fall. It would
make a great t-shirt... I might make two sets of screens;)

Have for years.  I've been told by some historians that my collection
of all things pirate is one of the better ones in the  US for a
non-museum private collection.  I have some books in my library that
are occasionally used as resources - all of them are out of print.

These logos are some of the ones I'm using for a logo I'm setting up
for my own use.

I'm still working on the final art.

Well then it will suit your boat just fine. Been a while since I did
SS but I stocked up on the materials recently for a project or two

Modern graphics are funny.  Some are closeup only, like airbrush art.
Others are seen from far away.

I one saw the Indonisian Tall ship entrant at Baltimore Harbor.  A
real Pirate busting schooner!  Except it looked tacky on the schooner.

Real pirates haunt Indoniasian waters. REAL MAINLINE PROFESSIONAL
SCHOONER.  BAD FLAG.

It needs modern undating.  OLD WORLD Flag and modern times do not mix.

The Jolly Roger needs an interpretation.  And yours is not so bad.  It
is modern.

I once saw a guy take a flag and cause the police to haunt the boat.
A guy had an old drug running schooner, and the Coast Guard just
busted the thing for inspection so bad it had to be dry docked. It was
in the Washington Post Magazine.
Way back.

So stay simple or complex.  If you want to run the police line make
the statement.  If you truly want low key?  Stay low key.

Note: real time boaters want low key.

Maybe make a temporary on season latex boat picture?  See if it looks
ok for your true lifestyle.

&gt; Don't take me wrong, I really like your design, just posting my
&gt; thoughts. Anyway, if you are interested, I could probably put it on a
&gt; silk screen for you to use on shirts, flags, or whatever. Been
&gt; thinking about breaking out a new bottle of opaque come fall. It would
&gt; make a great t-shirt... I might make two sets of screens;)

Skull and crossbones was not a common private signal used by pirates.
Certainly not even beginning to approach the almost universal use
suggested by Hollywood. Harry's cartoon rendition looks pretty phony-
but that's part of the charm. &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; is about as
indicative of actual pirate life as the &quot;B&quot; westerns were for cowherds
in the American midwest. Not every vacero carried a brace of matched
six-shooters, and most couldn't draw with any great speed or even
shoot particularly straight. Look at the number of rounds fired at
well documented gunfights like the OK Corral vs the number of people
actually hit, and that was at close range! To an identical extent,
darn few pirates fit the image of Captain Jack Sparrow or his crew.

The &quot;Yo-Ho&quot; logo chosen by Harry at least addresses the reality that
it's all bogus and silly. And why not, if that's your thing? That
said, I personally try to steer well clear of anybody &quot;playing pirate&quot;
and flying skull and crossbones. (You have to wonder what else they
aren't taking very seriously). I admit to feeling the same way about
boats flying inflatable martini glasses from the signal mast or
flybridge- so I'm not exclusively anti-pirate.

Um...no?

All Pirate Flags had some element of the skeleton and a fair majority
feature the skull and crossbones as a central element - or at least
the ones the more famous of the Pirates that remain intact.  Those
that are part of the oral history follow the same format as those
remaining flags that are still part of the historical record.

How many ways can I say this...

Um...no?

The historical accuracy of the pirate flag can be traced quite
adeguately. Intimidation of the enemy or victim was an important part
of the Pirate's arsenal - the flags were designed to conjure up fear
and dread. Combined with the reputation of not showing mercy the
Pirate could intimidate an enemy to surrender sans resistance.  Much
easier for the Pirates.

The images were often associated with a known pirates reputation or
could be used to display specific warnings. For example, Bartholomew
Roberts bore a grudge against the island colonies of Barbados and
Martinique, so in their waters he used a flag showing a pirate figure
standing on two skulls. Under one were the letters 'ABH' (standing for
'A Barbadian's Head'), and under the other was 'AMH' (for 'A
Martiniquan's Head'). The threat was clear.

I'm not going to get into the whole history of naval identification
and the evolution of red and black privateering flags into the Pirate
flag because it would stretch into a zillion words and it just ain't
worth it.

Suffice to say that the term Jolly Roger is derived from the French
(Jolie Rouge or Jolly Red) used by French privateers and/or Middle
English for Roger (begger or vagrant).  There is also some discussion
about the term &quot;Old Roger&quot; relating to The Devil or Evil One. In any
case, there was an evolution from privateering flag to Pirate flag
when privateering was banned by law.

This is not to say that there wasn't any variation in the base design.
It is also true that, historically and by oral record, the only Pirate
to fly the classic Skull and Bones was Edward England. The first
reference to the modified Skull and Bones was Emmanuelle Wynne who
flew a black flag embellished with a skull, crossed bones and an
hourglass.  Henry Every flew a basic skull and crossed bones, though
with the skull turned to the side on both a red and black flag.  All
these were used prior to the turn of the 18th century. While there
isn't any surviving evidence, there is existing evidence that
additional emblems on the basic red or black Skull and Bones flag were
increasingly associated with piracy and different symbols were in turn
associated with individual pirate captains.

The common symbol was the skull, the symbol of death. It was also
frequently depicted in association with crossed bones which were
powerful death symbols of those times - evidence of this is prevelant
in grave markers of the times. During these times symbolism in art and
everyday life was powerful laced with incredible meaning.  For
example, dancing skeletons meant dancing a jig with death, a
fatalistic reference the flyer didn't care about his fate. Others,
such as raised toasting glass and weapons indicated the same type of
death defying bravado.

In any case, the skull, skeleton and such were common identities of
Pirates and were indeed used.

Edward Teach - Horned skeleton and spear with bleeding heart.

Edmond Condent - Three Skull and Bones.

Edward England - Skull and Bones.

Henry Every - Skull sideways with Bones.

Christopher Moody - Winged hour glass, weapon, Skull and Bones

Jack Rackham - Skull with crossed swords.

Jean Lafitte - Skull and spears, Skull and Bones with some kind of
Voovo symbol.

Etc., etc., etc.

It's a great ride, especially on a typically steamy Orlando day. I like
the jungle cruise, too. Now, at Disneyland, the last time I was there,
the Pirates ride was visible from an indoor restaurant.
