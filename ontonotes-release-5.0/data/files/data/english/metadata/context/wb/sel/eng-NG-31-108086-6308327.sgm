Love my digital calipers and the ability to switch between metric and
English at a touch. Now some have a third mode, fractional. The ultimate
digital caliper for modelers should have all that and also the ability to
enter a scale factor and read directly the scale size..and then flip to see
it in millimeters, inches, fractions, etc.  Technically (speaking as a
one-time digital designer) it is not difficult to do. The only way to get
this function today is to buy a really high-end digital caliper with a
computer interface.  Then you have to drag a cable and computer around as
you work.  Cumbersome and expensive.  Should be self-contained.
Maybe we modelers can get a movement going and interest a caliper
manufacturer in such a project.

Do you know how it determines the denominator when it's not an exact
conversion?  E.g., would 15mm convert to 1/2 (18% small), 5/8 (6%
large), 9/16 (5% small), 19/32 (1/3% large), etc?  Hopefully, the user
would have some choice.  I can think of a couple of ways of doing it -
do you know how they do it?

A quick googling found several models - with fractional resolutions of 1/64
or 1/128.  I suppose the documentation will explain whether the device will
read low, high or closest to available unit.

That would be handy for the target market of woodworkers and such, I don't
see it such a big deal for scale railroad modeling.  I really would like to
see scale size available.

There was an HO scale dial caliper out, not sure if it's still available.

I think I'll stick to my old manual type ones , I've had them for many

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The most logical thing would be for it to read in the fractions that it is
set up to resolve, and jump from one to the next, without trying to get
exact matches to the other scales.  If you are reading in 1/128's of an
inch, for example, you are interested in the closest value to the actual
diameter--not the closest value to a number in some other scale.

Sounds like you need to buy a 1" square rod at the hardware store.
Normally in 3' lengths, can be cut down...

Then using paper or plastic sheeting - print scales.  Verify sizes, redo as needed.
Then since you are a model maker, make a scale.  Square not triangular.

Since square - you can do your two scales and metric and inch or
others as needed.  Naturally, if you had a CNC mill, then the job is trivial.

But a laser pinter or bubble  has the ability.  Just coat the paper with
Stay Clear and away you go!

What I meant in my example was: If you measured something that was
actually 15mm, but wanted it to read in fractions, how would it display?

I would hope that it wouldn't display in some fixed denominator, e.g.,
128 ths.  Because measuring something to be 96/128 is not nearly as
useful as knowing it's 3/4.  What about 80/128, now what is that?  Let's
see ... divide both by 16 gives 5/8.  OK, 5/8 it is.  I'd want one that
would say 5/8, not 80/128.  Can you imagine a list of material described
this way:  "2 pcs 80/128 brass, 4 72/128 long".

So there are calipers with digital outputs? That gives me an idea: what
if a guy were to connect such a caliper to a small custom-made unit,
instead of a computer, that would display the size in whatever scale
desired?

I probably have enough skills programming a little bitty CPU (like the
Ubicom [formerly Scenix] SX-28) to make something like this. Sounds like
a fun project. Could fit in a small box, easy to more around with you.

Anyone know the type of interface these calipers use? USB? Serial?

Wouldn't an architect's  6 scale drafting ruler work? I don't have on
handy but I believe they usually have a 1/2" = 1' scale on them. I
think they are twelve unit based.

C.T.T. Inc. of Dallas Texas makes inexpensive scale rulers.  I bought
mine at Caboose Hobbies in Denver.  Walthers also stocks them Here is a
link:  They are not as precise as a caliper but they get the job done
in most cases (:&gt;

Isn't that annoying while you are getting closer to the 3/4". I mean you
start at 1/2 and crank to 3/4. The display will be:

1/2
65/128
33/64
67/128
17/32
69/128

That would drive my **crazy**. But I also don't work in fractions. :-))

Isn't it called SPC Port ?
Search for that - there are kits and information.

USB is a hardware and software definition
serial is a generic term.

RS232, ... are hardware and defines frames for software...

It is serial, but SPC is what is in most shop tools for measurement.

Yes, I saw the two links the other person posted, including one that's
even better than your Yadro one (the one from Shumatech).

So the Chinese scales just output two values (absolute &amp; relative pos.)
over and over again, 48 bits of info. Should be pretty easy to capture
(being careful to filter out the glitches as pointed out on both those
pages). A simple little embedded processor with a(n) LCD display could
easily convert to any scale desired.

1:24 is 1/2" to the foot, a standard architectural scale. You should be
able to find a ruler marked in inches even in NZ, since your switch to
metric was relatively recent. Most rulers sold here in Canada are metric
on one edge, and imperial on the other.

Yes, most rulers destined for school desks have imperial on one face,

You might find an architectural scale (you know, those triangular

Yeah, but even the imperial system isn't perfect as the American ounce,
quart, and gallon are unique sizes.

It really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things as 1/4":1' can be
drawn in metric at 1:50 and yield approximate sizes.  For that matter, so
can railway scales: G = 1:25, O = 1:50, HO = 1:100.  Thus, one wouldn't have
to mix measurement systems such as HO at 3.5mm:12" to make 87.1:1 which I
find hilarious.  But, that would be too simple for those with Mensa
qualities.

Cheers,
John

it was see below blatantly copied from the web
The US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4ft, 8.5
inches. That's an exceedingly odd number !!
Why was that gauge used?
Because that's the way they built them in England, and English
expatriates built the US railroad
Why did the English build them like that?
Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the
pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used
Why did "they" use that gauge then?
Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools
that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing, Okay!
Why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing?
Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would
break on some of the old, long distance roads in England, because that's
the spacing of the wheel ruts.
So who built those old rutted roads?
Imperial Rome built the first long distance roads in Europe (and
England) for their legions. The roads have bee used ever since
And the ruts in the roads?
Roman chariots formed the initial ruts, which everyone else had to match
for fear of destroying their wagon wheels. Since chariots were made for
Imperial Rome, they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing
The United States standard railroad gauge of 4ft, 8.5 inches is derived
from the original specifications for the Imperial Roman war chariot
And bureaucracies live forever......

So the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's
arse came up with it, you may be exactly right. because the Imperial
Roman war chariots were made just wide enough to accommodate the back
ends or two war horses
Now the twist to the story.......

When we see a Space Shuttle sitting on a launch pad, there are two big
booster rockets attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These are
solid rocket boosters or SRB for short
The SRB are made by Thiokol at their factory at Utah.
The engineers who designed the SRBs might have preferred to make them a
bit fatter, but the SRBs had to be shipped by train from the factory to
the launch site.
The railroad line from the factory happens to run through a tunnel in

The SRBs had to fit through the tunnel.
The tunnel is slightly wider than the railroad track, and the railroad
track is about as wide as two horses' behinds
So, a major Space Shuttle design feature of what is arguably the world's

years ago by the width of a horse's arse

&gt;&gt; I was under the impression that the Roman chariot was to blame for that
&gt;&gt; little quirk....

&gt;it was see below blatantly copied from the web
&gt;The US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4ft, 8.5
&gt;inches. That's an exceedingly odd number !!
&gt;Why was that gauge used?
&gt;Because that's the way they built them in England, and English
&gt;expatriates built the US railroad
&gt;Why did the English build them like that?
&gt;Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the
&gt;pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used
&gt;Why did &quot;they&quot; use that gauge then?
&gt;Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools
&gt;that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing, Okay!
&gt;Why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing?
&gt;Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would
&gt;break on some of the old, long distance roads in England, because that's
&gt;the spacing of the wheel ruts.
&gt;So who built those old rutted roads?
&gt;Imperial Rome built the first long distance roads in Europe (and
&gt;England) for their legions. The roads have bee used ever since
&gt;And the ruts in the roads?
&gt;Roman chariots formed the initial ruts, which everyone else had to match
&gt;for fear of destroying their wagon wheels. Since chariots were made for
&gt;Imperial Rome, they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing
&gt;The United States standard railroad gauge of 4ft, 8.5 inches is derived
&gt;from the original specifications for the Imperial Roman war chariot
&gt;And bureaucracies live forever......

&gt;So the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's
&gt;arse came up with it, you may be exactly right. because the Imperial
&gt;Roman war chariots were made just wide enough to accommodate the back
&gt;ends or two war horses
&gt;Now the twist to the story.......

&gt;When we see a Space Shuttle sitting on a launch pad, there are two big
&gt;booster rockets attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These are
&gt;solid rocket boosters or SRB for short
&gt;The SRB are made by Thiokol at their factory at Utah.
&gt;The engineers who designed the SRBs might have preferred to make them a
&gt;bit fatter, but the SRBs had to be shipped by train from the factory to
&gt;the launch site.
&gt;The railroad line from the factory happens to run through a tunnel in
&gt;the mountains.
&gt;The SRBs had to fit through the tunnel.
&gt;The tunnel is slightly wider than the railroad track, and the railroad
&gt;track is about as wide as two horses' behinds
&gt;So, a major Space Shuttle design feature of what is arguably the world's
&gt;most advanced transportation system was determined over two thousand
&gt;years ago by the width of a horse's arse

I prefer the simpler metric system, but eschew condemning _any_ system.

No matter how hard we may strive to justify a "basis" for any system, they
are, after all, arbitrary by the choice of the men who use them.  There
exists no universal physically-based measurement system - nor can there
until we understand all of physics and the universe - so why cry "foul" if
someone chooses to use a system you don't like that's no more or less
arbitrary than the one you do like.

I just prefer the SI-system, as I do not have to remember all those
conversion factors.
Or would you prefer to use roman numerals for calculations :-)?

Well, having been brought up with both, and having bought all kinds of
things measured in both systems, and having lived through an incomplete
conversion to metric here in Canada, my considered conclusion is that
the old system is more consumer friendly. Why? Precisely because its
measures are based on the human body.

And human drinking capacity. Have you noticed that "standard" metric
drinks are sized very close to the old measures, with some rounding off
here and there? Eg, a half pint is 227ml - the standard soft drink in
Europe is now 250ml, which is about one tablespoon more.

There's also the convenience of estimating quantities that give us
results within a half unit or so. For a carpet, for example, a
centimetre is too small, and a metre too large, but a foot is just about
right.

The usual argument in favour of the metric system is that it's
"rational", because all its units are related to each other by powers of
10.*** Well, so what? The hard fact is that most people never convert
units into each other -- they never need to do so. People need units
that are easy to imagine in terms of use or consumption. It's no
accident that in Austria when I were a lad sliced meat was bought by the
"Deka", ie the 10gm unit. It's rather small, being less than half an
ounce, but it's in the right range - a slice of ham weighed about a
Deka, depending how the butcher set the slicing machine. On a recent
trip to Austria I shopped at a farmer's market. I noticed that people
asked for "about 1/8 kilo" of cheese, etc, not for 125gm. Interesting, eh?

I have nothing against the metric system, I use it a lot, actually. But
I do get testy with people who believe that it's inherently superior to
other systems of measurement. It isn't. It's just different. The same
goes for the imperial system. Use either for what it's good for, and
ignore it otherwise.
