Roe v. Wade was a flawed decision, not because it affirmed the
right of women to control their own reproductive systems, but
because it created out of thin air our government's right to intrude,
once a fetus is deemed to be viable outside a woman's body.

It was a foot in the door for the Religious Reich, and started the
whole progression of absurd legislation that has been seen since,
such as charging someone with two murders when they kill a
pregnant woman.

If you read the current platform of the Republican Party, the next
step is to have 14th Amendment equal protection rights assigned
legally to fetuses. That will by definition make murderers out of
all women who have abortions, and will make doctors who
perform them accomplices to murder.

You better believe the Republicans are doing everything possible
to force women back to the good 'ol days of coat hangers and
back alleys.
