But sorta on topic because the machine it's working with is drilling four
1/2&quot; holes in a pipe that is being clamped and automatically rotated and
slid into position...  The customer is drilling a thousand holes in a pipe
with a single button push and a cheapo-PLC...  But...  He wants me to work
clamping into it now that the machine has run smoothly for a few years...

Why?  Because it makes a better hole I suppose.  :)

Anyone know if there is such thing as a pneumatic swing arm clamp (DeStaco
type) that has a dry contact electrical switch to provide a &quot;proof of open
clamp&quot; signal?  Can't be moving or rotating that pipe if the clamps are
still closed...  And I can control the clamp close / open cycle with my
pneumatic controls but can't provide a &quot;proof of open clamp&quot; signal to his
PLC without an integrated product...

Oh the things I get myself into...  :)

Many pneumatic cylinders have reed or hall effect switches on cylinder body.
Ask Destaco if that is an option.  I can't believe it is not.

Joe,
Can you use a magnetic reed switch for the inputs? (24v) We use one like
you are talking, pneumatic, swing, then clamp, but it uses reed switches
for the open/closed detection.  I can't think of the name at the moment,
but it will come to me.

When I worked for the big corporation, we often used magnetic proximity
switches for this sort of thing. You've just got to find a place where you
can drill a 1/4&quot; hole and imbed a magnet. The switch itself closes when the
magnet is within a 1/4  inch - non contact and good for 100,000s of cycles.

Bimba makes 'em.
http://www.bimba.com/Products/FlatCylinders/TwistClampCylinders/

...and Compact Air
http://www.compactautomation.com/products_work_twist.htm

I know Bimba has dry contact (reed) switches as well as Hall sensors,
not sure how many choices Compact Air offers.

Googling &lt;&quot;swing clamp&quot; pneumatic&gt; and &lt;&quot;swing clamp&quot; air&gt;
turned up several others I wasn't aware of; for example
http://www.monroeengineering.com/clamp_swing_pn/page304.htm
http://www.vektek.com/Air/swing_clamp.htm

On the other hand, if you mean air operated toggle clamps, last I knew
Destaco makes those.

I've got a better set-up than that...  But only because the customer can not
handle the extra inout from a pressure switch on his PLC.

When my drill retracts, it also puts pressure to the clamps...  And thre is
a built in pneumatic timer to make sure that they don't open immediately...
The clamps get full system pressure rather than post regulator pressure so
there is at least the expectation that they will open if there is no
obstruction...  But no &quot;proof&quot; as I desire.

Customer thinks that the expectation is enough, but I want to offer the
&quot;right&quot; option so I don't get a call a year from now saying, &quot;All your ER
spindles are bemt and my clamps are now a permanent part of one of my
parts...&quot;

My &quot;prox switch&quot; guru was out today...  But I know we use both NPN/PNP type

Hmm ... the burglar alarm switches which used to be in Radio
Shack (and may still be, for all that I know) were in plastic and had a
pair of screw terminals on them

They would close whenever a magnet was close enough to them.

The real problem might be a buildup of chips on the magnet over
time, if he is drilling steel.  If aluminum or plastic -- no problems
there.  I would still coat over the screw terminals with an insulating
tape or some kind of insulating coating.

Good Luck

I tried to use one of those as an automatic door bell button when we

I actually think the clamps are destaco, but I can check monday.  We just
use standard balluff or festo PNP flat pack cylinder prox switches. I
would suggest you supply 24V to the sensor off of the plc power supply,
then tie the signal output to an ice cube relay (or a phoenix contact
solid state relay) which would actually pass the current along the series
to the PLC, since the current may be too much for the sensor in a series
application.  These things are only good for a few mA. Reliable as whiz
tho when properly used.  The only bad thing about a magnetic sensitive
prox is the range of sensing is not 'precise' per se`. You can shade it
to one side or the other of the magnet stop position, this will make it
more accurate. This is the most common type of clamping sensor we use, by
far. Probably in the neighborhood of a couple of thousand of these
sensors in use at our plant.

The application's need is relatively simple so I may just do it that way.
The clamp opens quite a bit so if I were to use the prox to sense the clamp
body's position, I should be fine.  No real chip debris in that area from
what I can see from the photos I received (I LOVE doing business without
traveling sometimes...)

Should solidify the plan this week.  I appreciate all the information and
ideas from you and others on this.

No problem Joe. I design and build automation on a daily basis, both
&quot;normal&quot; automation with actuators etc, and robotic automation using 6
axis robots. It's usually a combination of both, along with conveyance
systems, clamping systems, etc.
