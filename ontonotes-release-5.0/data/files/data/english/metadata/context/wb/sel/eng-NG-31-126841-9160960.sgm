This post, written by Satyam Khanna, originally appeared on _Think Progress_
( http://www.thinkprogress.org/ )

When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) wore a headscarf _while  visiting the
Umayyad mosque_ ( http://thinkprogress.org/2007/04/04/pelosi-laura-bush-scarf/ )
in Damascus in April, the right wing  pounced on her, attacking her as
&quot;_subservient_ ( http://instapundit.com/archives2/003880.php ) &quot; and  calling the act
&quot;_disgust[ing]_
( http://www.theneweditor.com/index.php?/archives/5629-Feminist-in-the-... ) .&quot;  Ironically, the right wing failed
to note that First Lady _Laura  Bush had also worn a headscarf_
( http://www.mahablog.com/2007/04/04/pelosi-wears-scarf-righties-bark-a... )  while
previously visiting the al-Aqsa  mosque in Jerusalem.
During a tour of the Middle East this week, Laura Bush again donned a
traditional hijab _given  to her as a gift_
( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/10/25/laura-bush-dons-hijab-wi_n_6... )  by a Saudi Arabian doctor.
Subsequently, several _progressive_
( http://instaputz.blogspot.com/2007/10/will-right-wing-blogosphere-den... )   _bloggers_
( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/10/25/laura-bush-dons-hijab-wi_n_6... )   questioned whether similar
&quot;opprobium&quot; would follow from the right wing  this time. Now we have our answer.
The conservative blogosphere has released its seething intolerance,
collectively rising up to denounce Laura Bush as &quot;_Ms.  Pander Clause_
( http://www.debbieschlussel.com/archives/2007/10/mrs_bushs_peopl.html ) &quot; for wearing the head
cover:

&quot;I find the image from Saudi Arabia so disturbing. ... That  she would oblige
her hosts by wearing a shmata on her head is a tacit  endorsement of Islam's
subjugation of women.&quot; -- _Weekly  Standard_
( http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2007/10/this_isnt_right.asp )

&quot;Bad craziness in Saudi Arabia ... [W]e get this,  from one of the most
misogynistic societies on the planet: a photo of  Laura Bush wearing an abaya and a
veil. -- _Little  Green Footballs_
( http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=27685&amp;only;&amp;rss; )

&quot;This is Sheikha Laura, yesterday, in the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia ... Laura
Bush [is] butt-kissing Saudi King  Abdullah.&quot; -- _Debbie  Schlussel_
( http://www.debbieschlussel.com/archives/2007/10/mrs_bushs_peopl.html )

Showing tolerance and respect for other cultures is  interpreted as
&quot;butt-kissing&quot; by far right conservatives.
UPDATE: Jeffrey Feldman boils down the White House  perspective:

Islamofascism - Bad! (nuclear war, invasion,  death)

Islamofashion - Good! (smiles, happy,  love)
UPDATE II: _Carpetbagger_
( http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/13376.html )   notes that Atlas Shrugs called the picture the &quot;Nightmare Pic of the
Day,&quot;  stating, &quot;We are the king of the world. We are the best and the
brightest.  _We  are America goddammit_
( http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2007/10/nightmare-pic... ) . ... This is submission.&quot;
