Hi all,

So, I think this topic has been posted before, but I wanted to get
some fresh answers to the topic of how real some of these problems are
that dentists claim that you have.

Last week, I went to a new dentist on a new barebones limited
insurance I have (only covers dental exam, not even basis
prophylaxis), and I came out with a recommendation that I needed $3000
of dental work to fix my supposedly god awful horrible teeth. I've
had this story unloaded on me before, and it is really truly
nerve-wrecking since you never know if they are telling the truth or
not.

The problem is that the dentist's bread and butter is made by
telling you you have crappy teeth - and if they think you have money
(I am not wealthy, but I drive a nice car and wear nice clothes) I am
sure they use this to decide what is &quot;wrong&quot; with me.

Here are the problems given - I'd like a honest and frank opinion
from any qualified prof's on the board who have a better conscience
and no need to worry about making a buck off of me:

1) Impacted wisdom teeth pull - I have 2 impacted wisdom teeth and I
have had 3 past dentists claim that this can cause tartar buildup
inside and next to the adjoining tooth and have had suggestions to
have them pulled along with the top two. What is the truth? Is this
is a medical danger?

2) Deep cleaning - I have been told in the last two visits that I am
not flossing enough and that my tooth pockets have gotten too big and
need deep cleaning. I don't feel any particular pain, although I will
admit, I do have a mild tinginess in my gums because I went a few
weeks without flossing (my mistake) and my gums have become really
soft, so when I floss now, my gums bleed. However, I'm back on a
daily floss plan - do I really need a deep clean? Is there some way I
can tell myself how bad my teeth are? What is the truth? Is this a
medical danger?

3) Cavities - 4 dentists ago, I had no cavities. 3 dentists ago,
nearly every tooth had a cavity. I did nothing about it. 2 dentists
ago, I had no cavities once again. Last week, I had 4 cavities, one
requiring a root canal and crown. Quite ironically, it happens that 2
of the cavities are on my wisdom tooth so the dentist recommended its
all the more reason to have them pulled! Which is interesting,
because in one sentence she said food rarely goes back to the rear of
the teeth so I shouldn't feel bad about having them pulled, and in the
next one she is saying that I have cavities back there. I use a home
flouride treatment periodically and have generally not had any
particular sensitivity to foods except for extreme cold and hot (which
I think everyone has). Is there some way I can tell myself how bad my
teeth are? What is the truth? Is this a medical danger?

I appreciate any guidance, self-checks, home therapies, that you can
suggest. I don't want to damage my teeth beyond repair, but then
again, if it weren't for the dentist, looking at my teeth in the
mirror, the only thing I can spot visually is a) my back teeth are in
fact impacted but I don't know if that's really a problem and b) my
gums have softened because I was off the flossing for a while, so they
bleed when I floss now, again, I don't know if that's fixable by just
resuming the flossing.

Please provide any advice you have. Thanks.

"/>  OK, there is a standing doctrine that there is no such thing as a post
that is off-topic in talk.origins; however the above places a serious
challenge to this belief. I hereby propose the following solution to this
apparent &quot;refutation&quot;, and invite others to forward alternative hypotheses:
1) Many creationists practice credential inflation by claiming degrees
in fields irrelevant to biological evolution.
2) Dentistry is a field unrelated to biological evolution (allowances
made for comparative primatology).
3) The person posting above has a problem with a dentist whom he
believes to be twisting the facts to suit their own agenda.
4) Creationists make a habit of twisting facts to suit their own
agenda.
therefore
.:C) The poster's wisdom teeth are offered as an example of suboptimal
design, thereby refuting creationism.

Other theories?

&gt;&gt; So, I think this topic has been posted before, but I wanted to get

&gt;&gt; that dentists claim that you have.

&gt;&gt; Last week, I went to a new dentist on a new barebones limited
&gt;&gt; insurance I have (only covers dental exam, not even basis
&gt;&gt; prophylaxis), and I came out with a recommendation that I needed $3000
&gt;&gt; of dental work to fix my supposedly god awful horrible teeth. I've
&gt;&gt; had this story unloaded on me before, and it is really truly
&gt;&gt; nerve-wrecking since you never know if they are telling the truth or
&gt;&gt; not.

&gt;investigative reports have shown that many dentists do attempt to pad
&gt;their income with expensive scare tactics. then again in this

Some will call virtually any brownish spot a cavity. Some will call
white lines cavities (the white lines are basically the precursor to a

black hole in the tooth.

This will cause you to get completely different, but all technically
correct, diagnoses from different dentists.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem is that the dentist's bread and butter is made by

&gt;Hi, I posted similar message a while ago but still having problems
&gt;with this issue. I want to remove my amalgam fillings (please dont
&gt;ask why, i dont want to start long discussion about safety of amalgam
&gt;-:). Most of them can be removed easily but i have 2 back teeth with
&gt;root canals which have amalgam build up going partially to the canals.
&gt; My general dentist said she can't remove them and i need to go to
&gt;endodontist. So far I went to 3 endodontists and none of them agreed
&gt;to do this procedure. Some of them said they dont do this procedure
&gt;at all, other said there is a risk for the tooth, so they dont wanna
&gt;do it. So is it possible to remove that stuff from my teeth,
&gt;hopefully without destroying them? I can do post and crown on them
&gt;after that, but dont wanna leave silver filling inside. What
&gt;specialist should i go to?

&gt;Thanks,

tooth, it is no substitute for a REAL crown which fits the tooth
properly.

&gt; Hi all,

"/> Hi,

Have you been having regular very 6 months professional cleaning; this
could also be done in dental clinic of a dental hyguenic program at
local 2 yaers college if they offer it..usually, they get practise
experience foer the students..while you pay cheap rate.

They don't do cavity fillign and stuff..

Now..I will tell you my expericne and then answer each of your
question.

After being broke for 3 years during which I didn't see any dentist -
I had my wisdown test removd and all cavities filled and was having
regular dental cleanig prior to that period, I went to see a dentist.

Everything he said sounded reasonable but I was annoyed that he wanted
me to do some cosmetic work on the tiny, little, barely noticeable
chip I have on a tooth (as a kid, I used to play by opeong bottle with
my tooth though my mtoher said not to do that because in my mind, i
was like..my teth are strong... until one day, I felt something and
knew that I had a little chip; I was smart enough not to do it again.
BTW, my teeth are very straight -never need brace and uite pretty)
but when he realized that I had no dental insurance - I didn't buy it
knowing that I would need any major work -he didn't suggest that
anymore. I did some filling done with him...

I continued to go to him ..
till i moved to another satte..

Here...I didn research to find the best one for my sister who needed
urgent care..

The guy turned out to be the top in his field; When he was doing
fillings for mys sietr, I was like &quot;What the h**l?&quot; because it seemed
that every teeh seemed to be needing caviti filling but she had
neglected her teeth and also was lazy to brush properly and so I
thought that hers could be that bad ..until...it was time for me to
dental cleaning and I decided to do with him..though my intention was
not have the same dentist..

When he told me about needing the cavities filling..I was like ..I had
been seeing a dentist regularly and how come he never told me...

when I said that, I think he got worried that I would confront my old
dentist for failing to inform me about those and so he said that some
dentists wouldn't consider those pockets as cavities (as far as I was
concerned, they were natural pockets on each tooth excluding the front
ones) and I realzied what was also happening with my sister on those
fillings. She did have other filings that were legitmately needed. I
was the one in charge of supevising sincc she had a bad experience
prior to my arrival here, getting ripped off...

She alraedy had most of her teeth done and so we didn't stop the
dentist..

So ..some of yours could be those things that are not necessary. So, I
suggest .. you ask detail questions and understand what tooth need
filling at where by getting a picture of the drawing of the whole
mouth and understand what he wanted you to have it doen on each of
those teeth by referring to them by numbers...

And this dentist would give me the total cost of the whoel mouth when
i aksed for it. Instead, he would give me for a quater of the
mouth...I amy go to him again one more thing but I refuse to do any
unnecessary work.

Since he know that I am very informed (I accompanied my sister and
asked everything done on her and in fact, by referring to each teeth
with the number after I found out about those unnessary
fillings....yes, I let them knwo that I was watching evry details..),
he can't fool me with unnecessary work.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; So, I think this topic has been posted before, but I wanted to get
&gt; some fresh answers to the topic of how real some of these problems are
&gt; that dentists claim that you have.

&gt; Last week, I went to a new dentist on a new barebones limited
&gt; insurance I have (only covers dental exam, not even basis
&gt; prophylaxis), and I came out with a recommendation that I needed $3000
&gt; of dental work to fix my supposedly god awful horrible teeth. I've
&gt; had this story unloaded on me before, and it is really truly
&gt; nerve-wrecking since you never know if they are telling the truth or
&gt; not.

&gt; The problem is that the dentist's bread and butter is made by
&gt; telling you you have crappy teeth - and if they think you have money
&gt; (I am not wealthy, but I drive a nice car and wear nice clothes) I am
&gt; sure they use this to decide what is &quot;wrong&quot; with me.

&gt; Here are the problems given - I'd like a honest and frank opinion
&gt; from any qualified prof's on the board who have a better conscience
&gt; and no need to worry about making a buck off of me:

&gt; 1) Impacted wisdom teeth pull - I have 2 impacted wisdom teeth and I
&gt; have had 3 past dentists claim that this can cause tartar buildup
&gt; inside and next to the adjoining tooth and have had suggestions to
&gt; have them pulled along with the top two. What is the truth? Is this
&gt; is a medical danger?

"/> Wisdom teeth are best to remove as they push other teeths
(crowdedness) but if you already have them they have already pushed
those other teeth but still, it would make it better for brushing if
they are gone...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; 2) Deep cleaning - I have been told in the last two visits that I am
&gt; not flossing enough and that my tooth pockets have gotten too big and
&gt; need deep cleaning.

"/> What type of deep cleaning? What's the term? deep planing? That would
be cleaning under the gum..Unless..you have neglected dental care for
a long time, your gum are in bad shape, I doubt that it would be
necessary for just missing lossing here and there....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't feel any particular pain, although I will
&gt; admit, I do have a mild tinginess in my gums because I went a few
&gt; weeks without flossing (my mistake) and my gums have become really
&gt; soft, so when I floss now, my gums bleed. However, I'm back on a
&gt; daily floss plan - do I really need a deep clean?

"/>  Once the plague has calcized and became claculus, they have o be
removed by professional clenaing since flossing won't remove them..

Why don't you go to a dental clinic at a local college and get that
regular prof cleaning done first...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Is there some way I
&gt; can tell myself how bad my teeth are? What is the truth? Is this a
&gt; medical danger?

"/> If it is really bad, the danger is the health of your gum and hence
affect on your teeth

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; 3) Cavities - 4 dentists ago, I had no cavities. 3 dentists ago,
&gt; nearly every tooth had a cavity.

"/> This sounds like those natural pockects ones..I suggest you go to
dentist with worn out clothes..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I did nothing about it. 2 dentists
&gt; ago, I had no cavities once again.

"/> That means..those the above comment I amde was likely

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Last week, I had 4 cavities, one
&gt; requiring a root canal and crown.
&gt; Quite ironically, it happens that 2
&gt; of the cavities are on my wisdom tooth so the dentist recommended its
&gt; all the more reason to have them pulled! Which is interesting,
&gt; because in one sentence she said food rarely goes back to the rear of
&gt; the teeth so I shouldn't feel bad about having them pulled, and in the
&gt; next one she is saying that I have cavities back there. I use a home
&gt; flouride treatment periodically and have generally not had any
&gt; particular sensitivity to foods except for extreme cold and hot (which
&gt; I think everyone has). Is there some way I can tell myself how bad my
&gt; teeth are? What is the truth? Is this a medical danger?

"/>  I have wisdom teeth removed and I recommend that.. but your budget is
tight, you might want to wait if it is not causing too much probelm..I
am not a dentis by the way. just sugegsting that you have to evaluate
your need...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I appreciate any guidance, self-checks, home therapies, that you can
&gt; suggest. I don't want to damage my teeth beyond repair, but then
&gt; again, if it weren't for the dentist, looking at my teeth in the
&gt; mirror, the only thing I can spot visually is a) my back teeth are in
&gt; fact impacted but I don't know if that's really a problem and

"/>  May be need of wisdow teeh removal..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;b) my
&gt; gums have softened because I was off the flossing for a while,

"/>  Just for a little bit won't do harm...after next clenaing, keep up
with it...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;so they
&gt; bleed when I floss now, again,

"/> That's normal...it just emans..you have calculus (calcized plague)
that needs to be removed via routine prof cleaning ...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I don't know if that's fixable by just

My mistake, nto deep palning but root plaing which is deep cleaning
... under the gum....

If you have not doen regualr prof clenaing for a very long time and
didn't brush (and floss) well, may eb you need it but the key is

- ask what ti to be done on each tooth and how much for each work
- how much for root planing...usually, half a mouth (top bottom) is
done once and the seond half done after giving a chance for the gums
to heal ..

get a second opinion....

to be the quacks of the medical profession. I've never found myself
doubting any procedure a doctor wanted to do (&quot;Blood test? Sure here's
my arm&quot;) but now that fluoride in the water have wiped out the
majority of cavities, dentistry is all about 'appearance' which is
subjective as hell.

"/> Ever done the reverse on your dentist? My hypothesis is: the more
expensive the office, the more likely they'll find something wrong
with you.

I came up with that hypothesis last week, after I saw an orthodontist
who had a silver convertible BMW, an expensively manicured garden and
a state of the art designed office. I came in to check how much it
would cost to straighten 4 of the teeth in my bottom jaw (they aren't
very visible but I wanted a quote). He told me I needed: $16,000
braces top and bottom (although only the bottom ones were crooked),
four teeth removed and replaced by titanium bolts, an operation on my
bottom jaw to lengthen it and several crowns. At least $30,000 of
work, probably more.

I'd hate to see what he charges people with obviously crooked teeth...

out a few years ago and I'm very glad I did. I'm far more comfortable

If they're not painful, why bother unless they're crowding other teeth
in your jaw? Sure they may get tartar, but that's what dentists are
there for. Use a tartar control toothpaste.

clean teeth and give fluoride treatments as part of a usual check up

An x-ray may reveal an UNSUCCESSFUL root canal therapy. The loosening
is where the bacteria are raising up the tooth until they fistulate
(create a tunnel to the exterior) and exit through the oral cavity.
Then it settles in for a while.

It may need retreatment.

&gt;majority of cavities, dentistry is all about 'appearance' which is
&gt;subjective as hell.

&gt;Get a second opinion.

&gt;&gt; The problem is that the dentist's bread and butter is made by
&gt;&gt; telling you you have crappy teeth - and if they think you have money
&gt;&gt; (I am not wealthy, but I drive a nice car and wear nice clothes) I am
&gt;&gt; sure they use this to decide what is &quot;wrong&quot; with me.

&gt;Ever done the reverse on your dentist? My hypothesis is: the more
&gt;expensive the office, the more likely they'll find something wrong
&gt;with you.

&gt;I came up with that hypothesis last week, after I saw an orthodontist
&gt;who had a silver convertible BMW, an expensively manicured garden and
&gt;a state of the art designed office. I came in to check how much it
&gt;would cost to straighten 4 of the teeth in my bottom jaw (they aren't
&gt;very visible but I wanted a quote). He told me I needed: $16,000
&gt;braces top and bottom (although only the bottom ones were crooked),
&gt;four teeth removed and replaced by titanium bolts, an operation on my
&gt;bottom jaw to lengthen it and several crowns. At least $30,000 of
&gt;work, probably more.

&gt;I'd hate to see what he charges people with obviously crooked teeth...

&gt;&gt; Here are the problems given - I'd like a honest and frank opinion
&gt;&gt; from any qualified prof's on the board who have a better conscience
&gt;&gt; and no need to worry about making a buck off of me:

&gt;&gt; 1) Impacted wisdom teeth pull - I have 2 impacted wisdom teeth and I
&gt;&gt; have had 3 past dentists claim that this can cause tartar buildup
&gt;&gt; inside and next to the adjoining tooth and have had suggestions to
&gt;&gt; have them pulled along with the top two. What is the truth? Is this
&gt;&gt; is a medical danger?

&gt;Are they painful? If so, get rid of them. I had 4 painful wisdom teeth
&gt;out a few years ago and I'm very glad I did. I'm far more comfortable
&gt;without them.

&gt;If they're not painful, why bother unless they're crowding other teeth
&gt;in your jaw? Sure they may get tartar, but that's what dentists are
&gt;there for. Use a tartar control toothpaste.

&gt;&gt; 2) Deep cleaning - I have been told in the last two visits that I am
&gt;&gt; not flossing enough and that my tooth pockets have gotten too big and
&gt;&gt; need deep cleaning. I don't feel any particular pain, although I will
&gt;&gt; admit, I do have a mild tinginess in my gums because I went a few
&gt;&gt; weeks without flossing (my mistake) and my gums have become really
&gt;&gt; soft, so when I floss now, my gums bleed. However, I'm back on a
&gt;&gt; daily floss plan - do I really need a deep clean? Is there some way I
&gt;&gt; can tell myself how bad my teeth are? What is the truth? Is this a
&gt;&gt; medical danger?

&gt;Deep cleaning? This must be an American thing. In Australia dentists
&gt;clean teeth and give fluoride treatments as part of a usual check up
&gt;but I've never heard of 'deep cleaning'. Sounds like a marketing trick
&gt;to me.

&gt;&gt; 3) Cavities - 4 dentists ago, I had no cavities. 3 dentists ago,
&gt;&gt; nearly every tooth had a cavity. I did nothing about it. 2 dentists
&gt;&gt; ago, I had no cavities once again. Last week, I had 4 cavities, one
&gt;&gt; requiring a root canal and crown.

&gt;Did you teeth actually hurt when they told you about the cavities?
&gt;Nothing like pain to make you believe what the dentist is saying! ;-)

&gt;&gt;Quite ironically, it happens that 2
&gt;&gt; of the cavities are on my wisdom tooth so the dentist recommended its
&gt;&gt; all the more reason to have them pulled! Which is interesting,
&gt;&gt; because in one sentence she said food rarely goes back to the rear of
&gt;&gt; the teeth so I shouldn't feel bad about having them pulled, and in the
&gt;&gt; next one she is saying that I have cavities back there. I use a home
&gt;&gt; flouride treatment periodically and have generally not had any
&gt;&gt; particular sensitivity to foods except for extreme cold and hot (which
&gt;&gt; I think everyone has). Is there some way I can tell myself how bad my
&gt;&gt; teeth are? What is the truth? Is this a medical danger?

&gt;I wish I knew the answer to that one. I wish there were truly reliable
&gt;dentists out there that were capable of given an objective opinion.

&gt;Again, I can only suggest getting a second opinion.

&gt;&gt; I appreciate any guidance, self-checks, home therapies, that you can
&gt;&gt; suggest. I don't want to damage my teeth beyond repair, but then
&gt;&gt; again, if it weren't for the dentist, looking at my teeth in the
&gt;&gt; mirror, the only thing I can spot visually is a) my back teeth are in
&gt;&gt; fact impacted but I don't know if that's really a problem

&gt;If there's no pain, it's a problem only if you decide it's a problem.

&gt;&gt;and b) my
&gt;&gt; gums have softened because I was off the flossing for a while, so they
&gt;&gt; bleed when I floss now, again, I don't know if that's fixable by just
&gt;&gt; resuming the flossing.

&gt;In theory, flossing and gargling Listerine should fix it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Have you been having regular very 6 months professional cleaning; this
&gt;&gt;&gt;could also be done in dental clinic of a dental hyguenic program at local
&gt;&gt;&gt;2 yaers college if they offer it..usually, they get practise experience
&gt;&gt;&gt;foer the students..while you pay cheap rate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;They don't do cavity fillign and stuff..

&gt;&gt;&gt;Now..I will tell you my expericne and then answer each of your question.

&gt; apparent typos.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;OK, I've got one. It's about The Tooth From Hell. Lower tooth, two in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;front of the wisdom tooth I don't have. It's had two amalgam fillings,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a gold crown, and then a root canal (RC maybe 10 years ago, maybe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;longer; first filling perhaps 40 years ago). Every once in a while it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;seems to loosen up a bit and hurt like hell for several days. Then it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stops wiggling and the pain disappears.

&gt;&gt;&gt; REPLY:

&gt;&gt;&gt; An x-ray may reveal an UNSUCCESSFUL root canal therapy. The loosening
&gt;&gt;&gt; is where the bacteria are raising up the tooth until they fistulate
&gt;&gt;&gt; (create a tunnel to the exterior) and exit through the oral cavity.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Then it settles in for a while.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It may need retreatment.

&gt;&gt;I've had X-rays since the root canal which showed no problem. If they
&gt;&gt;were taken when it wasn't loose/painful, would anything have shown up?

&gt; Okay, no retreatment, but sometimes there is a fistula extending out
&gt; through the periodontal ligament.

Exactly. Sometimes the dentist or endodontist finds a slight opening
between the tooth and gum and slides in a very fine silver point that
approximates the size and bore of a sewing needle.

Down down, down, and then the doc snaps an x-ray showing the fistula.

It may heal in time ....

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi all,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Have you been having regular very 6 months professional cleaning; this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;could also be done in dental clinic of a dental hyguenic program at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;local 2 yaers college if they offer it..usually, they get practise
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;experience foer the students..while you pay cheap rate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They don't do cavity fillign and stuff..

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Now..I will tell you my expericne and then answer each of your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;question.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hiya Amanda,

&gt;&gt;&gt; English not your native tongue ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Just a shot in the dark there.

&gt;&gt; I'm guessing dyslexic. Not really her fault either way, but it does make
&gt;&gt; for some odd reading.

&gt;&gt; Amanda, I'd say a spellchecker might be a reasonable thing for you to
&gt;&gt; use. Your posts contain a _lot_ of words with simple spelling errors,
&gt;&gt; usually apparent typos.

&gt; you guys should just appreciate that i bothered to apend time giving info
&gt; that no one botered to give him straight

"/> Oh, I appreciate your contribution. I was merely trying to be helpful.

--
&quot;You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor'and 'hate your enemy.'
But I say to you, love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you, that
you may be like your Father in heaven, since he causes the sun to rise on
the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.&quot;
(Matthew 5:43-45, New English Translation)

"/> Excellent point.

But it occurs to me that we now have a real, live dentist posting to
talk.origins, and we haven't posed the obvious question yet.

Dr. Eichen, some folks in the past have posted material written by
members of your profession that they think debunks evolutionary biology.
They get a little flustered when we inquire if they should perhaps see a
paleontologist the next time they have a toothache.

So what's your take on this evolution business? Hoax or Truth(tm)? Fact
or flight of fancy?

Is it in fact a pulp chamber filled with rot and decay, as some like to
point out? A canker in the mouth of science? Do we need to root out all
trace of these poseurs before science can move on to the next level?

Chris

&gt;&gt; Hi all,

&gt;&gt; So, I think this topic has been posted before, but I wanted to get
&gt;&gt; some fresh answers to the topic of how real some of these problems are
&gt;&gt; that dentists claim that you have.

&gt;&gt; Last week, I went to a new dentist on a new barebones limited
&gt;&gt; insurance I have (only covers dental exam, not even basis
&gt;&gt; prophylaxis), and I came out with a recommendation that I needed $3000
&gt;&gt; of dental work to fix my supposedly god awful horrible teeth. I've
&gt;&gt; had this story unloaded on me before, and it is really truly
&gt;&gt; nerve-wrecking since you never know if they are telling the truth or
&gt;&gt; not.

&gt; I know what you mean. Dentists (and particularly orthodontists) seem
&gt; to be the quacks of the medical profession. I've never found myself
&gt; doubting any procedure a doctor wanted to do (&quot;Blood test? Sure here's
&gt; my arm&quot;) but now that fluoride in the water have wiped out the
&gt; majority of cavities, dentistry is all about 'appearance'

"/> Appearance (not health) is what triggers some people (like my lazy
fraternal twin) to start taking care of their teeth. Only when tooth
pockets get too big and not looking pretty, she started caring...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;which is
&gt; subjective as hell.

&gt; Get a second opinion.

&gt;&gt; The problem is that the dentist's bread and butter is made by
&gt;&gt; telling you you have crappy teeth - and if they think you have money
&gt;&gt; (I am not wealthy, but I drive a nice car and wear nice clothes) I am
&gt;&gt; sure they use this to decide what is &quot;wrong&quot; with me.

&gt; Ever done the reverse on your dentist? My hypothesis is: the more
&gt; expensive the office, the more likely they'll find something wrong
&gt; with you.

&gt; I came up with that hypothesis last week, after I saw an orthodontist
&gt; who had a silver convertible BMW, an expensively manicured garden and
&gt; a state of the art designed office. I came in to check how much it
&gt; would cost to straighten 4 of the teeth in my bottom jaw (they aren't
&gt; very visible but I wanted a quote). He told me I needed: $16,000
&gt; braces top and bottom (although only the bottom ones were crooked),
&gt; four teeth removed and replaced by titanium bolts, an operation on my
&gt; bottom jaw to lengthen it and several crowns. At least $30,000 of
&gt; work, probably more.

&gt; I'd hate to see what he charges people with obviously crooked teeth...

&gt;&gt; Here are the problems given - I'd like a honest and frank opinion
&gt;&gt; from any qualified prof's on the board who have a better conscience
&gt;&gt; and no need to worry about making a buck off of me:

&gt;&gt; 1) Impacted wisdom teeth pull - I have 2 impacted wisdom teeth and I
&gt;&gt; have had 3 past dentists claim that this can cause tartar buildup
&gt;&gt; inside and next to the adjoining tooth and have had suggestions to
&gt;&gt; have them pulled along with the top two. What is the truth? Is this
&gt;&gt; is a medical danger?

&gt; Are they painful? If so, get rid of them. I had 4 painful wisdom teeth
&gt; out a few years ago and I'm very glad I did. I'm far more comfortable
&gt; without them.

&gt; If they're not painful, why bother unless they're crowding other teeth
&gt; in your jaw? Sure they may get tartar, but that's what dentists are
&gt; there for. Use a tartar control toothpaste.

&gt;&gt; 2) Deep cleaning - I have been told in the last two visits that I am
&gt;&gt; not flossing enough and that my tooth pockets have gotten too big and
&gt;&gt; need deep cleaning. I don't feel any particular pain, although I will
&gt;&gt; admit, I do have a mild tinginess in my gums because I went a few
&gt;&gt; weeks without flossing (my mistake) and my gums have become really
&gt;&gt; soft, so when I floss now, my gums bleed. However, I'm back on a
&gt;&gt; daily floss plan - do I really need a deep clean? Is there some way I
&gt;&gt; can tell myself how bad my teeth are? What is the truth? Is this a
&gt;&gt; medical danger?

&gt; Deep cleaning? This must be an American thing. In Australia dentists
&gt; clean teeth and give fluoride treatments as part of a usual check up
&gt; but I've never heard of 'deep cleaning'. Sounds like a marketing trick
&gt; to me.

&gt;&gt; 3) Cavities - 4 dentists ago, I had no cavities. 3 dentists ago,
&gt;&gt; nearly every tooth had a cavity. I did nothing about it. 2 dentists
&gt;&gt; ago, I had no cavities once again. Last week, I had 4 cavities, one
&gt;&gt; requiring a root canal and crown.

&gt; Did you teeth actually hurt when they told you about the cavities?
&gt; Nothing like pain to make you believe what the dentist is saying! ;-)

&gt;&gt;Quite ironically, it happens that 2
&gt;&gt; of the cavities are on my wisdom tooth so the dentist recommended its
&gt;&gt; all the more reason to have them pulled! Which is interesting,
&gt;&gt; because in one sentence she said food rarely goes back to the rear of
&gt;&gt; the teeth so I shouldn't feel bad about having them pulled, and in the
&gt;&gt; next one she is saying that I have cavities back there. I use a home
&gt;&gt; flouride treatment periodically and have generally not had any
&gt;&gt; particular sensitivity to foods except for extreme cold and hot (which
&gt;&gt; I think everyone has). Is there some way I can tell myself how bad my
&gt;&gt; teeth are? What is the truth? Is this a medical danger?

&gt; I wish I knew the answer to that one. I wish there were truly reliable
&gt; dentists out there that were capable of given an objective opinion.

&gt; Again, I can only suggest getting a second opinion.

&gt;&gt; I appreciate any guidance, self-checks, home therapies, that you can
&gt;&gt; suggest. I don't want to damage my teeth beyond repair, but then
&gt;&gt; again, if it weren't for the dentist, looking at my teeth in the
&gt;&gt; mirror, the only thing I can spot visually is a) my back teeth are in
&gt;&gt; fact impacted but I don't know if that's really a problem

&gt; If there's no pain, it's a problem only if you decide it's a problem.

&gt;&gt;and b) my
&gt;&gt; gums have softened because I was off the flossing for a while, so they
&gt;&gt; bleed when I floss now, again, I don't know if that's fixable by just
&gt;&gt; resuming the flossing.

&gt; In theory, flossing and gargling Listerine should fix it.

These are bait-and-switch marketing plans and have nothing to do with
finding a caring dentist. Go back to your group of friends and ask for
a dental recommendation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; of the cavities are on my wisdom tooth so the dentist recommended its
&gt;&gt;&gt; all the more reason to have them pulled! Which is interesting,
&gt;&gt;&gt; because in one sentence she said food rarely goes back to the rear of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the teeth so I shouldn't feel bad about having them pulled, and in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; next one she is saying that I have cavities back there. I use a home
&gt;&gt;&gt; flouride treatment periodically and have generally not had any
&gt;&gt;&gt; particular sensitivity to foods except for extreme cold and hot (which
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think everyone has). Is there some way I can tell myself how bad my
&gt;&gt;&gt; teeth are? What is the truth? Is this a medical danger?

&gt;&gt; I wish I knew the answer to that one. I wish there were truly reliable
&gt;&gt; dentists out there that were capable of given an objective opinion.

&gt;&gt; Again, I can only suggest getting a second opinion.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I appreciate any guidance, self-checks, home therapies, that you can
&gt;&gt;&gt; suggest. I don't want to damage my teeth beyond repair, but then
&gt;&gt;&gt; again, if it weren't for the dentist, looking at my teeth in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; mirror, the only thing I can spot visually is a) my back teeth are in
&gt;&gt;&gt; fact impacted but I don't know if that's really a problem

&gt;&gt; If there's no pain, it's a problem only if you decide it's a problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;and b) my
&gt;&gt;&gt; gums have softened because I was off the flossing for a while, so they
&gt;&gt;&gt; bleed when I floss now, again, I don't know if that's fixable by just
&gt;&gt;&gt; resuming the flossing.

&gt;&gt; In theory, flossing and gargling Listerine should fix it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; you assume I use news reader.

&gt;&gt; 1. You're obviously reading and responding to news articles; therefore,
&gt;&gt; you are using a news reader of some sort. It may be web-based, proxied,
&gt;&gt; or otherwise have its true nature obscured from your (foggy) vision, but
&gt;&gt; rest assured that there is a news reader program involved somewhere.

&gt;&gt; 2. You don't need a news reader to use a spell checker.

&gt;&gt; You're not very bright, are you, sweetie?

&gt;i post through google; show me an easy way to co spell check. not

Oh well, since I have stumbled across this (though why it is in
talk.origins, I haven't a clue) . . .

Do you have a word processing program? They all have spell checkers.
Either compose your post on it and then copy it into Google or, after you
compose it in Google but before you hit the &quot;post this message&quot; button,
copy it into the word processor to check the spelling. The copying takes
literally a second or two. Correcting the spelling, from what I've seen,
may take longer . . .

"/> Pieret,

I replied to the person who started this thread because no one was
givign him straight answer. I did it fate and hence a lot of spelling
error. But I am sure that he understaood and that's what counts, as
far as I am concerned. I will not spend time checking in WORD and
post it here. I have better things to do. The main thing is to get
info across, not tesign English skill.
Heck, my Chemistry advisor (from grad schoolw ay back) and I
communicate emails all in lower case ..to save time.. it's his idea
and I like it.

For those who do not want to read, they have a choice not to read.
