This should have been a story as big as the Jesus story.  There would have
been songs and many wonders.  It was really to make you aware that there is
life in space.  That we do have powers and can do many things.
All the way through we have told the story - written the songs - this was to
have been a story and songs that we should have shared.  Kindness and
friendship in a world we did not know or understand.
It was to have been a happy story - and in a way it could have been shared
for ever.  The songs we sing you can sing over and over and over.  Our world
is renewing and more beautiful by the moment.
It was to make you happy.  This being the only reason for our visit.

Take happiness into misery, and you get misery. Keep it where it belongs,
and allow individuals to gravitate.

THAT'S how it works.
