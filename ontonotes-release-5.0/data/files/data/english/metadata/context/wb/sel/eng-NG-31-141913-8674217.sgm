[Maybe if the US has to undergo a SUPER-SIZED &quot;Special Period in a
Time of Peace&quot; as Cuba did after the destruction of the Soviet Union
(except of course it would be a &quot;Special Period in a Time of War
of Terror), the unconscious and greedy self-obsessed Amerikkkan
consumer and profit-mad Big Biz would actually wake up and begin to
look around them. Of course, it would have to be a really SUPER
UN-ECONOMY SIZED &quot;Special Period.&quot;  But it looks like that might
actually be coming. And who knows? It might even end as a &quot;Special
Period in a Time of Peace&quot; (and Ruination) -- because the War on the
World might just collapse. -NYTr]

Retailers push reusable bags to save money, environment

By Michelle R. Smith, Associated Press

PROVIDENCE (AP) b When Katrina Gamble goes grocery shopping, she brings
her list and her bags b a pair of sturdy canvas bags she bought a few
months ago for $4.99 at her local grocery store.

&quot;It works just as well,&quot; said Gamble, 30, a political science professor
at Brown University, adding, &quot;It's better for the environment.&quot;

A growing number of stores are catering to customers like Gamble, who
see reusing shopping bags as an easy way to cut down on waste.

Several large retailers, including Stop &amp; Shop, New England's largest
food retailer, and housewares store Ikea, now sell reusable shopping
bags. Some groceries, including independent stores and natural foods
chain Whole Foods, go a step further, offering credits of a few cents
for each bag that's reused.

There's an upside for stores, too: Giving out fewer bags means the
store saves money.

The fashion world has also taken note, with designers like Stella
McCartney and Hermes selling reusable shopping bags for hundreds of
dollars. Whole Foods created a frenzy in New York recently when it
offered a limited number of designer shopping bags for $15.

The Sierra Club's Sierra magazine estimates that Americans throw away
almost 100 billion plastic bags each year and only 1% to 3% are
recycled. Environmentalists warn paper is not much better than plastic
because trees have to be cut down and energy expended to make them.

They also say cutting back a little could make a big difference. The
Sierra Club estimated that if every person in New York City used one
less grocery bag per year, it would reduce waste by 5 million pounds
and save $250,000 on disposal.

Several companies give incentives for customers to cut down on
disposable bags.

Eastside Marketplace, an independent grocer in Providence where Gamble
shops, gives customers a 3-cent-per-bag credit when they reuse a bag.
Even with the credit, the store saves a few pennies or breaks even
because it doesn't have to pay for a disposable shopping bag, said
spokeswoman Kim Moreau. About 7% to 10% of customers reuse bags, she
said.

&quot;I wouldn't even call it a trend anymore. It's more like a growing way
of life,&quot; Moreau said.

Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods gives 5 to 10 cents back for each
reused bag.

Even more traditional supermarkets like Stop &amp; Shop are introducing
reusable bags. The Quincy, Mass.-based company doesn't give a bag
credit. But it started selling sturdy reusable green bags with a Stop &amp;
Shop logo for 99 cents in November. Since then, the company said it has
sold or given away 1.3 million bags to shoppers.

&quot;Our biggest challenge is keeping them in stock because the customers
are really responding to them,&quot; spokesman Robert Keane said.

It's that green bag that prompted Allison Spooner, 37, of Providence,
to give up disposable bags. She said she had been thinking about
environmental issues but hadn't found a reusable bag she liked. Then
she saw Stop &amp; Shop's bag, which is more sturdy than a regular paper
grocery bag, holds more groceries and is made of recycled material. It
hasn't been hard to adjust, she said.

&quot;I take all my groceries out when I get home and put the bags next to
my purse so I don't forget them,&quot; she said.

Swedish retailer Ikea has perhaps taken the reusable bag idea further
than any other large chain. In March, Ikea, which sells everything from
furniture to dishes to Swedish meatballs, began charging a nickel for a
plastic shopping bag. A reusable bag costs 59 cents. The goal was to
reduce plastic bag usage by 50%, and the company has already exceeded
that, said spokeswoman Mona Astra Liss.

A similar policy at Ikea stores in Britain reduced plastic bag usage by
95% within nine months, she said.

Then there are large wholesale stores, which don't use bags at all.
BJ's Wholesale Club, based in Natick, Mass., Sam's Club, based in
Bentonville, Ark., and Costco Wholesale Corp., based in Issaquah,
Wash., instead reuse the boxes used to ship merchandise.

The reason? &quot;The cost of bags are a big cost of doing business in a
typical grocery store,&quot; said Dick DiCerchio, Costco's chief operating
officer of global operations.

But Costco is looking to cut back on boxes. It's been testing out sales
of reusable bags in Canadian stores, where they've been a big hit, and
recently started selling reusable bags in the San Francisco Bay area, a
two-pack for $1.79.

If the bags are a success, Costco could then ask suppliers to stop
packing products in boxes and put them on pallets instead, said Joe
Portera, chief operating officer of CostCo's eastern and Canadian
divisions.

&quot;It would save money not only for us but for manufacturers,&quot; he said.
&quot;It would ultimately reduce the amount of waste and recycling that's
necessary with cardboard.&quot;
