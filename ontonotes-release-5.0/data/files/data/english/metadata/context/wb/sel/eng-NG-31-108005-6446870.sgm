Hi, I have a problem I'm hoping some of you can put into perspective.
Or help me squash.

I have a lovely stash...not huge by any means, but mostly respectable.
I've collected pieces from various sources, but I typically don't have
much money to spend at a time and I tend to buy smaller pieces. I don't
have a lot of pieces over a yard and those that I do have of a larger
size are fairly specific fabrics, not blenders or easily blendable.

Now that's the details, and I've blamed the details for my problem. But
I suspect it's more something in my head than what's on my shelves.

I'm having a hard time working on anything lately. I just made a little
table runner, but I don't really like it. (I'll post pics later today
or tomorrow). Everytime I go to my sewing area to work, I can't find
anything that works. I look and look and find a pattern or project
--sometimes I think I will modify the pattern or project to make it
work for me -- but I can't find fabric for it. I gather a stack of
gorgeous fabric that works together, but I can't find a pattern
thatworks with the fabric. When I do start cutting something, as soon
as I start trying to assemble the first blocks, the colors look awful
together. The shapes are all wrong. Everything clashes.

To sum up, I just can't seem to go to my "sewing place."  I've made
some postcards and stitched some little things that I tell myself I'll
put into "something" later. But the truth is I can't really make
anything work. It's a lot like writer's block.

Anybody got suggestions? I've read through every magazine I've got --
some twice. I've gone through all my books. I've web surfed. I've read
about inspiring quilters and exciting quilters. It all just depresses
me, LOL.

Ok, I've asked for your wisdom and advice. I hope you folks will pitch
in with your best and help me find a bit of light at the end of this
not-even-dark-but-mostly-dreary-and-boring tunnel.

Hugs,
Sunny

Leave it.  Walk away.  Forget quilting.  For a couple days, couple weeks,
just forget.  Don't pick up a magazine, book, website, nothing (not us of
course!).  Read a trashy "bosom heaver" (ie romance novel), watch soppy
Julia Roberts DVDs, play with animals or children (or both), walk along the
beach or through a forest/national park.  Spoil yourself silly.

In a little while, ideas will start popping into your head.  Draw them
quickly onto paper (not too much effort - whatever you have to hand will do)
and put them on your sewing table.  Start to flick through a book/mag and
find the easiest pattern out (I've gone for plain squares with sashing).
Start to cut them and sew them up.  Don't cut all the pieces at once - only
about a quarter.  You will look at them and say "I don't know" and then
you'll get more ideas specific to that quilt (I have).  Sketch them quickly.
Leave it.  The urge will come.  Follow it but don't rush.

Pretty soon you'll be back to norman.  Promise.

Hugs

Hi Sunny
Taria had the same problem a few weeks ago. I don't know if she's got
her "groove" back yet or not..... sometimes it just takes a while. What
about just some dinner napkins or beverage coasters? Something easy and
mindless...... never fear - your creativity will return soon - with the
weather we're having here in Washington, maybe it went on a trip to the
Bahamas!

Sharon, what marvelous advice- "Pretty soon you'll be back to norman. "
Can you send Norman this way when you're finished with him?  ROFLOL

I tend to freeze up for another reason.  I'm a perfectionist (wish I
was NOT) I have all these wonderful ideas to make amazing quilts.  I
can't make them.  I don't have the artisitic ability, the color sense
or the stick-to-it-ness.  Yeah, I know.....   I make decent quilts, and
sometimes I make a really nice quilt, but I cannot make the amazing
quilts that I *want* to make.  It causes me to start a project, get
discouraged, and then try something else.  Sometimes I freeze up before
I even really get started.  That's when I leave my sewing for a while-
sometimes a LONG while.  When I feel ready then I go back to it.  Some
quilts take years..... but I do finish one every now and then.  VBG  Ya
just can't force it.  Let yourself have some time and space.  The Muse
*will* return and you can jump back in with both feet when you are
ready.

Norman is pretty special.  He doesn't occur very often down here.  Actually
I can't take credit for that wonderful saying - those of you with young kids
will know it comes from the Rugrats.  They have some amazing sayings (most
of which are true) and I still love sitting down to watch them.  Don't like
Rugrats grown Up but I adore the young ones.  I am a mix of mostly Chucky
with a bit of Phil and Lil thrown in.  I'm not brave like Tommy and I'm most
definitely not Angelica.

Thanks for the good words. Sharon, your suggestions are good and sound
and ultimately I know that's what will bring me back. Leslie, I share
those same frustrations with you. I know that's a huge part of my
problem. I get so discouraged. I look at the amazing work in the
quilting shows and magazines and in my head I can do work like that,
then I read the bios and always it's "using my engineeering background"
and "after my master's degree in art" and "as a graphic artist" and
that sort of thing. These people are artists, trained and experienced.
I have zero artistic training and not likely to get any. And I'm not a
natural talent. I can mix colors in really fun ways f rom time to time,
but design totally escapes me.

I go to a round robin of art quilters. Those women are amazing and they
inspire me. Three are really incredible "paint" artists, two
professional. Several others have extensive artistic training. One who
I don't think was trained in art school is perhaps the most amazing.
She goes to seminars and training sessions with the really big name
quilt artists and then incorporates what she learns into her work. Wow.
Her work is gorgeous. And she is so generous about bringing information
back from her seminars. I feel like a fake in the midst of these
talented women

I find myself at the age of 50 terribly contemplative. All my life I
put my family first. My husband's career before mine. My children's
needs before my work or even my intellectual needs. I never "made my
mark." I worked and I did some good work. I wrote some good articles,
sounded real smart a couple times. But I never did anythign that will
be remembered after I'm gone (except give birth, LOL). These years,
with my boys grown, was to be the time of my life to dig in, put my
work first. To study and write and create. Well, illness put a stop to
that. Now I hesitate to take classes because I know I'll never be able
to go enough to make it work. I find that I am terribly self-pitying. I
not only admire the amazing people around me creating incredible, prize
winning quilts, I envy them and covet their abilities. But at my point
in life, it's unlikely that I'll attain such a level. Especially
considering the dearth of energy I have and the frequent life
interruptions -- the days I spend in pain unable to read, watch, think.
The days when I am unbearably confused.

Oh I'm sorry. Apologies for letting my self-pity get to me and for
blurting way, way too much information. LOL.

I will get back to work at some point. I'm moving my quilting area from
the basement room into my very own room -- 11 x 12 with my stash sauna
acting as a closet. It's been the "computer" room and I've had to step
over people to get to the sauna, which has resulted in taking too much
out and now all is in pandemonium. I can't find anything. So I will
spend this week cleaning, straightening, finding forgotten things. And
next week for the very first time I'll have "my very own room". I just
hope I can recall my creativity from the Bahamas in time to make the
move worthwhile.

Thanks and hugs for the help,
Sunny

And yes, I think it's possible that my creativity has taken a hike to
the Bahamas.

(((((((((((((Sunny)))))))))))))

It sounds from your post that we are very much in the same frame of mind at
the mo.  That's why I have decided to make 2007 "The Year of Me".  Yep
that's what I've decided and so far I've taken little baby steps towards it.
For instance, and this may shock some of you, I am horribly, totally,
incomprehensibly addicted to Days of Our Lives and The Bold and the
Beautiful.  True.  During this forced break from work (ie schoolholidays) I
have made time to watch both shows, religiously, each day - well almost.
And I love it.  The kids know it and respect it.  Husband makes fun of it.
But it's "me" time.

I've also decided that the Year of Me is when I become fitter and learn to
love Me more.  On this resolution I'm at the Commando Crawl stage.  Haven't
quite managed to give myself the time but I'm getting there.

Let's do it together Sunny - baby steps and encouragement all the way

Sounds like the next time you go fabric shopping, you should get some
blenders!

To get out of a rut and practice with fabric selection, why not buy a small
kit, baby or twin size maybe, anything as long as you like it. Challenge
yourself to swap out one of the fabric selections in the kit, using either
something in your stash or buying a new piece.

Or -Find a friend who will play, and choose a simple design using a light, a
medium and a dark (double Irish chain maybe). The challenge is to swap a
piece of fabric, then use your friend's fabric to set the color scheme for
your quilt. Afterwards, you can enjoy seeing how different they look.

&gt; Hi, I have a problem I'm hoping some of you can put into perspective.
&gt; Or help me squash.

&gt; I have a lovely stash...not huge by any means, but mostly respectable.
&gt; I've collected pieces from various sources, but I typically don't have
&gt; much money to spend at a time and I tend to buy smaller pieces. I don't
&gt; have a lot of pieces over a yard and those that I do have of a larger
&gt; size are fairly specific fabrics, not blenders or easily blendable.

&gt; Now that's the details, and I've blamed the details for my problem. But
&gt; I suspect it's more something in my head than what's on my shelves.

&gt; I'm having a hard time working on anything lately. I just made a little
&gt; table runner, but I don't really like it. (I'll post pics later today
&gt; or tomorrow). Everytime I go to my sewing area to work, I can't find
&gt; anything that works. I look and look and find a pattern or project
&gt; --sometimes I think I will modify the pattern or project to make it
&gt; work for me -- but I can't find fabric for it. I gather a stack of
&gt; gorgeous fabric that works together, but I can't find a pattern
&gt; thatworks with the fabric. When I do start cutting something, as soon
&gt; as I start trying to assemble the first blocks, the colors look awful
&gt; together. The shapes are all wrong. Everything clashes.

&gt; To sum up, I just can't seem to go to my &quot;sewing place.&quot;  I've made
&gt; some postcards and stitched some little things that I tell myself I'll
&gt; put into &quot;something&quot; later. But the truth is I can't really make
&gt; anything work. It's a lot like writer's block.

&gt; Anybody got suggestions? I've read through every magazine I've got --
&gt; some twice. I've gone through all my books. I've web surfed. I've read
&gt; about inspiring quilters and exciting quilters. It all just depresses
&gt; me, LOL.

&gt; Ok, I've asked for your wisdom and advice. I hope you folks will pitch
&gt; in with your best and help me find a bit of light at the end of this
&gt; not-even-dark-but-mostly-dreary-and-boring tunnel.

You sound like you may have Fibro and those of us that do --you have our
empathy. Not our sympathy--that's Moms work--but empathy....knowing SOMEDAY
you will get back to it. Just give it TIME and give YOURSELF time.
I KNOW it's hard, BTDT, more than once. Some days you can't even turn a mag
page cause it hurts tooo much.

Once we get resettled, I'll have DS put our website back up and you can see
my 10 Minute Quilt...... I could only sit/stand/work for 10 min before I had
to go lie down again --soooooooooo I made a quilt--10 min and then go
rest--get up--do something else for 10 min and then rest. I NEVER would have
finished if it hadn't been for a few gals on this NG. Even made dinner 10
min  at a time...peeled taters-go lie down--get back up-- chop taters, go
lie down, get back up put taters on--go sit in the recliner whilst it
cooked...fortunately my guys helped make the rest of dinner.

Now I am waiting for my Butterfly Studio to be done and I SHOULD be able to
sew once again..short periods and working my way up. My goal is to obtain 20
FULL MINUTES without having to take a break...but I *WILL* do it. In the
meantime, I'm perusing mags, quilting books from the library, reading here,
and FINALLY have QNN to where it'll work quite well on my compie. Hard? I
never said it was easy and if I alluded to such then my writing isn't that
good this AM and I apologize.

My Studio will have a chair to rest in..a TV to watch Simply Quilts and
other quilting tapes...so I will be 'thinking' quilts even when I'm resting
:) This didn't happen overnight--talk about YEARS of trail and error of what
will or won't work. You have to figure out your own schedule and even GET A
TIMER and set it--I did and it really helped tremendously so I wouldn't
overdo. Frustrated-you betcha.....but I decided it would NOT get me down

And it did, so I came here and got the 'moral support' that I needed and I
went back and tried again. Oh, some of the RCTQ'ers don't know how much they
have helped--just by BEING HERE......and some do cause I've been 'hounding
them' for their ideas and help and they gave it to me:) And I'm grateful

Enuf for now. HTH a least a lil bit.

Cyberhugs and Butterfly Kisses

Butterfly and Jacqueline,
Thank you for those eloquent words and execellant advice. I don't have
fibro. I do have an autoimmune disease called Sjogren's Syndrome. If
anyone is interested in learning more about it, contact me privately
and I will explain. It's very like lupus with a few interesting twists
and very unknown. I'd never heard of it until somebody said I have it.

And I agree about the support groups -- incredible support and
information but it doesn't work to make my illness into my identity.

I usually keep a pretty good hold on things. But when I'm overwhelmed
then it all goes kersplat, LOL.

The angst over my lack of skills and talent is silly, but it's a thing
apart (usually) from being ill. I ache to make something amazing.
Polly, I got your message and yes, that is an amazing thing to make and
is the top of my list. Thank you for incredible perspective.

Right now, I am just a silly woman looking back up the road, the way
I've travelled, and farther down the road, the way I'm headed, and
thinking altogether too much of myself. I promise, I will get back to
work, even if it's not a prize winning epic of a quilt.

Hugs to all of you -- and special soft hugs to the fibro sisters :)
Sunny

Sunny, I realize you haven't been quilting very long, so everything looks
wonderful and you want to do it all. When I first started I thought I'd love
to make quilts with all those wonderful points, triangles, etc.  Over the
years I've realized it won't happen!  I've found I hate cutting
accurately,and don't like having to have everything match perfectly.  This
is why I'm cleaning out a lot of patterns and books--I realize I'll never do
this type of work.  As for the art quilts--I love them, especially
landscapes.  However, I doubt I'll ever piece my backgrounds or skies-use
fabric already the way I want it.  I was talking with a friend the other day
and she agrees, it takes some time to find your niche and what you really
want to do.  Maybe if you tried a different approach and tried something
very different for you, it would help with the block.  Or possibly, walking
away from the whole thing for a while might get you going again.  Tell your
head you refuse to think about quilting----eventually it'll rebel and decide
for you.

I fear this is going to sound like the teacher always within me (though
I haven't taught formally for many years!).

I have a feeling that you are trying to run before you have even been
taught how to walk!  You say that you see all the beautiful things in
shows and get frustrated because you can't do them.  You do have flashes
of inspiration and real skill - as you have shown us.  So, not being
able to consistently create what to you are masterpieces is frustrating.
I wonder if you are like a musician longing to play concerti, but who
has not let learnt to play scales properly?  If you don't master basics
to some extent, you won't be able to progress with a solid foundation.
There are geniuses out there, of course there are; but most of us
aren't!  Similarly with fabric:  unless you try out fabric, you won't
learn how to 'handle' it. You have to practise fabric choice and
placement.   I think I remember you picked a large-scale print to go
with other 'pretties' that you found. This is quite a difficult trick to
master - large-scale prints are not easy (for me, anyway!).  Roberta is
right - you have been picking focus fabrics, but are perhaps lacking
foundation fabrics and blenders.

I think you want to try to make jaw-droppingly gorgeous art quilts.  You
have certainly made a great start there - look at the reception that
'Red' had here when you showed us the partial pictures.

Before you can get to those quilts, perhaps you need to 'practise the
scales' - make some blocks first; get used to handling fabric and
putting different prints and colours together.  If all else fails,
remember the 'mantra' of light, medium and dark.  Learn how your fabrics
fit into the value scale.  Perhaps you have an inherent sense of the
rightness of value balance and because you haven't considered your
fabrics in those terms, you try and your eye sees they are not in
balance, so rejects them as 'unworthy'.

Use your computer, if you can, to help in the question of value:  put
fabrics together, scan them and then turn the resultant picture into
black and white.  Value is probably more important than colour in the
end.

Sorry if this is of no help whatsoever.  There may be a grain or two &gt;g&lt;

&gt; It sounds from your post that we are very much in the same frame of mind
&gt; at the mo.  That's why I have decided to make 2007 &quot;The Year of Me&quot;.  Yep
&gt; that's what I've decided and so far I've taken little baby steps towards
&gt; it. For instance, and this may shock some of you, I am horribly, totally,
&gt; incomprehensibly addicted to Days of Our Lives and The Bold and the
&gt; Beautiful.  True.  During this forced break from work (ie schoolholidays)
&gt; I have made time to watch both shows, religiously, each day - well almost.
&gt; And I love it.  The kids know it and respect it.  Husband makes fun of it.
&gt; But it's &quot;me&quot; time.

&gt; I've also decided that the Year of Me is when I become fitter and learn to
&gt; love Me more.  On this resolution I'm at the Commando Crawl stage.
&gt; Haven't quite managed to give myself the time but I'm getting there.

&gt; Let's do it together Sunny - baby steps and encouragement all the way

&gt;&gt; I will get back to work at some point. I'm moving my quilting area from
&gt;&gt; the basement room into my very own room -- 11 x 12 with my stash sauna
&gt;&gt; acting as a closet. It's been the &quot;computer&quot; room and I've had to step
&gt;&gt; over people to get to the sauna, which has resulted in taking too much
&gt;&gt; out and now all is in pandemonium. I can't find anything. So I will
&gt;&gt; spend this week cleaning, straightening, finding forgotten things. And
&gt;&gt; next week for the very first time I'll have &quot;my very own room&quot;. I just
&gt;&gt; hope I can recall my creativity from the Bahamas in time to make the
&gt;&gt; move worthwhile.

&gt;&gt; Thanks and hugs for the help,
&gt;&gt; Sunny

&gt;&gt; And yes, I think it's possible that my creativity has taken a hike to
&gt;&gt; the Bahamas.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Taria had the same problem a few weeks ago. I don't know if she's got

&gt;&gt;&gt; about just some dinner napkins or beverage coasters? Something easy and

Patti,
More than a grain or two. You are exactly right about my need to gain
experience with basics. I have a small mountain of half-square
triangles I'vebeen working on over the past couple weeks.  All sizes --
just to practice. maybe someday I'll put them together into some sort
of scrappy "Practice Quilt". Also I've been working on set-in seams.
Grrrrrrrrr. My bane.

I do find it hard to cut into my precious fabric without assurance that
the end result will be good. LOL. I use up my "uglies" for practice and
right now I have some of the ugliest, wonkiest, most off-kilter
eight-point stars you've ever seen. Why can't I master this "simple"
block?????? I am going to include an 8-point star in my next quilt,
somewhere or somehow, or be darned trying.

Anyway you're right. Frustration comes from lack of experience and
skill. And I need more work. I think what I need mostly to do is hunker
down and pay no attention to my whining stash and sewing machine for a
while. Maybe I'll crochet for a while.

Hugs,
Sunny

Don't do 'support groups' other than right here on RCTQ :) I just haven't
been able to sit long enuf at any given time to dedicate  myself to any of
them. I have read a bit on one of the artie groups but that didn't last very
long..lots of flaming going on. Not worth my time.
For the longest time, it was: do I wanna sew or do I wanna type. Now that
the swollen hand tendons have settled a bit (wear braces to bed every night)
the decision is easier to make-- lil of both--typing mainly in the AM when
my hands are in need of limbering up (thanks to spell check ;)  and then
sewing on/off during the day (not appropriate at present time) and back on

&gt; Butterfly,  You described my way of doing things to a T.  Fibro is not

ROFLOL - You should see one of mine.  Oh man!  I had a brilliant idea - cut
triangles from 7" square blocks and join to another triangle to make
diamond.  Join diamonds to make star.  Okay, I managed half a star alright,
but joining those two halves - eeewwwwwwww.  Got me a giant volcano
(inverted) in the middle.  Rippit, rippit, sew it back and still have one.
In the bin she went.

&gt;&gt; It sounds from your post that we are very much in the same frame of mind
&gt;&gt; at the mo.  That's why I have decided to make 2007 &quot;The Year of Me&quot;.  Yep
&gt;&gt; that's what I've decided and so far I've taken little baby steps towards
&gt;&gt; it. For instance, and this may shock some of you, I am horribly, totally,
&gt;&gt; incomprehensibly addicted to Days of Our Lives and The Bold and the
&gt;&gt; Beautiful.  True.  During this forced break from work (ie schoolholidays)
&gt;&gt; I have made time to watch both shows, religiously, each day - well
&gt;&gt; almost. And I love it.  The kids know it and respect it.  Husband makes
&gt;&gt; fun of it. But it's &quot;me&quot; time.

&gt;&gt; I've also decided that the Year of Me is when I become fitter and learn
&gt;&gt; to love Me more.  On this resolution I'm at the Commando Crawl stage.
&gt;&gt; Haven't quite managed to give myself the time but I'm getting there.

&gt;&gt; Let's do it together Sunny - baby steps and encouragement all the way

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for the good words. Sharon, your suggestions are good and sound
&gt;&gt;&gt; and ultimately I know that's what will bring me back. Leslie, I share
&gt;&gt;&gt; those same frustrations with you. I know that's a huge part of my
&gt;&gt;&gt; problem. I get so discouraged. I look at the amazing work in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; quilting shows and magazines and in my head I can do work like that,
&gt;&gt;&gt; then I read the bios and always it's &quot;using my engineeering background&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; and &quot;after my master's degree in art&quot; and &quot;as a graphic artist&quot; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; that sort of thing. These people are artists, trained and experienced.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have zero artistic training and not likely to get any. And I'm not a
&gt;&gt;&gt; natural talent. I can mix colors in really fun ways f rom time to time,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but design totally escapes me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I go to a round robin of art quilters. Those women are amazing and they
&gt;&gt;&gt; inspire me. Three are really incredible &quot;paint&quot; artists, two
&gt;&gt;&gt; professional. Several others have extensive artistic training. One who
&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think was trained in art school is perhaps the most amazing.
&gt;&gt;&gt; She goes to seminars and training sessions with the really big name
&gt;&gt;&gt; quilt artists and then incorporates what she learns into her work. Wow.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Her work is gorgeous. And she is so generous about bringing information
&gt;&gt;&gt; back from her seminars. I feel like a fake in the midst of these
&gt;&gt;&gt; talented women

&gt;&gt;&gt; I find myself at the age of 50 terribly contemplative. All my life I
&gt;&gt;&gt; put my family first. My husband's career before mine. My children's
&gt;&gt;&gt; needs before my work or even my intellectual needs. I never &quot;made my
&gt;&gt;&gt; mark.&quot; I worked and I did some good work. I wrote some good articles,
&gt;&gt;&gt; sounded real smart a couple times. But I never did anythign that will
&gt;&gt;&gt; be remembered after I'm gone (except give birth, LOL). These years,
&gt;&gt;&gt; with my boys grown, was to be the time of my life to dig in, put my
&gt;&gt;&gt; work first. To study and write and create. Well, illness put a stop to
&gt;&gt;&gt; that. Now I hesitate to take classes because I know I'll never be able
&gt;&gt;&gt; to go enough to make it work. I find that I am terribly self-pitying. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; not only admire the amazing people around me creating incredible, prize
&gt;&gt;&gt; winning quilts, I envy them and covet their abilities. But at my point
&gt;&gt;&gt; in life, it's unlikely that I'll attain such a level. Especially
&gt;&gt;&gt; considering the dearth of energy I have and the frequent life
&gt;&gt;&gt; interruptions -- the days I spend in pain unable to read, watch, think.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The days when I am unbearably confused.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh I'm sorry. Apologies for letting my self-pity get to me and for
&gt;&gt;&gt; blurting way, way too much information. LOL.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I will get back to work at some point. I'm moving my quilting area from
&gt;&gt;&gt; the basement room into my very own room -- 11 x 12 with my stash sauna

That is precisely my point!
An 8-pointed star is one of the most difficult things to attempt.  Even
half-square triangles are not always a cinch.
Really, you should spend some time with squares, rectangles and strips
for a while.  That way you get the experience of fabric judging and
putting together, a true quarter-inch seam, and a fairly painless,
though lovely, quilt at the end of it.

&gt; Hi, I have a problem I'm hoping some of you can put into perspective.
&gt; Or help me squash.

&gt; I have a lovely stash...not huge by any means, but mostly respectable.
&gt; I've collected pieces from various sources, but I typically don't have
&gt; much money to spend at a time and I tend to buy smaller pieces. I don't
&gt; have a lot of pieces over a yard and those that I do have of a larger
&gt; size are fairly specific fabrics, not blenders or easily blendable.

&gt; Now that's the details, and I've blamed the details for my problem. But
&gt; I suspect it's more something in my head than what's on my shelves.

&gt; I'm having a hard time working on anything lately. I just made a little
&gt; table runner, but I don't really like it. (I'll post pics later today
&gt; or tomorrow). Everytime I go to my sewing area to work, I can't find
&gt; anything that works. I look and look and find a pattern or project
&gt; --sometimes I think I will modify the pattern or project to make it
&gt; work for me -- but I can't find fabric for it. I gather a stack of
&gt; gorgeous fabric that works together, but I can't find a pattern
&gt; thatworks with the fabric. When I do start cutting something, as soon
&gt; as I start trying to assemble the first blocks, the colors look awful
&gt; together. The shapes are all wrong. Everything clashes.

&gt; To sum up, I just can't seem to go to my &quot;sewing place.&quot;  I've made
&gt; some postcards and stitched some little things that I tell myself I'll
&gt; put into &quot;something&quot; later. But the truth is I can't really make
&gt; anything work. It's a lot like writer's block.

&gt; Anybody got suggestions? I've read through every magazine I've got --
&gt; some twice. I've gone through all my books. I've web surfed. I've read
&gt; about inspiring quilters and exciting quilters. It all just depresses
&gt; me, LOL.

&gt; Ok, I've asked for your wisdom and advice. I hope you folks will pitch
&gt; in with your best and help me find a bit of light at the end of this
&gt; not-even-dark-but-mostly-dreary-and-boring tunnel.

&gt; Hugs,
&gt; Sunny

This is probably not the answer you want to hear (It wouldn't be the one I
want to hear), but I think you need some S.E.X.  Plan to spend some time on
this, maybe look at it as an afternoon.  Go to your LQS (good
friends/enablers are often good to have a long)  Browse through all the books
and patterns.  Spend time wandering around the shelves and find something
that makes your heart sing. Buy a nice chunk of it, have a nice lunch out,
and I bet your creative juices will start flowing again.

Hadnt thought that far ahead:)

Sunny,
You might just need some info/refreshing on basics.  Find a selection of
fabrics and a basic "learn to quilt" book ("Your First Quilting Book....
Or It Should Be" by Carol Doak is a good one, I think.) and start at the
beginning.  Yes, you may know how to do a 4 or 9 Patch block, but follow
the directions, see if you find any small tip that makes things
easier/faster/more accurate. Keep going.  You will probably make several
very simple blocks.  That is fine.  Make them as perfect as you can get
them.  Put them together into a quilt. That practices sashing and
borders. Doesn't have to be big quilt, maybe 2-3 smaller ones.  Then, if
you don't like them.....donate them. To a homeless shelter, DPS or where
ever you want to.  Someone will love to have that/those quilt(s).  You
will practice, make notes (on paper or mental) about what needs
improving and in the end it doesn't matter whether or not it is a
masterpiece. It is practice.  Sometimes we all need to practice the
basics.
I know, from practice, that I need to check the size of every single
unit I sew. I would rather have to trim a sliver off than be short so I
often cut a bit too large. But that is a lot easier to deal with than
being way too short. (Although that can be dealt with too..... I have a
couple of vintage/antique quilts that have pieced pieces and not
necessarily on grain. &lt;G&gt; )

BTW, inset seams are really, really easy to do by hand.  &lt;BG&gt;
IF they are "Y" seams, sew the "arms" of the Y first and the leg last.
the leg tends to be 2 of exactly the same size shape piece and is easier
to match. Most people stop 1/4" from the edge when machine sewing, I
like to leave a teeny bit (a stitch length or a bit less) room.  That
leaves a tiny bit more room for the seam allowances to turn back. And
the next stitch point still has the stitch in it.
Try it.

8 point star.... what kind?? made with diamonds/parallelograms or like a
sawtooth/variable/Ohio star?
Work on the individual units.  Work on half and quarter square triangle
units. For the diamond star, try starching your fabric, before cutting.
(I make "spray" starch in small batches in a spray bottle with liquid
starch. Lots cheaper than canned and can be made whatever heaviness you
need.) Press all the seams "in the same direction" around the center
intersection. You can "open" up the seam inside the seam allowance and
get a much flatter block.
Also..... make the 4 quarters of the star.... 2 points sewn together.
The center corner of this section should be an exact 90° angle. Check it
and make sure. You may need to trim a tiny bit if your seam is off or
you ironed the seam.  If all four of the center angles are correct you
are only sewing a 4 patch block together. &lt;G&gt; (you can also split the
setting squares and triangles so that you don't have set in seams. If
you use alternating shades for the background it makes even more sense
that way. &lt;G&gt; )
This is not a simple block to make. But once you work out the methods
and techniques that work for you, it can be fun/elegant/ and so much more.

&gt; Patti,
&gt; More than a grain or two. You are exactly right about my need to gain
&gt; experience with basics. I have a small mountain of half-square
&gt; triangles I'vebeen working on over the past couple weeks.  All sizes --
&gt; just to practice. maybe someday I'll put them together into some sort
&gt; of scrappy &quot;Practice Quilt&quot;. Also I've been working on set-in seams.
&gt; Grrrrrrrrr. My bane.

&gt; I do find it hard to cut into my precious fabric without assurance that
&gt; the end result will be good. LOL. I use up my &quot;uglies&quot; for practice and
&gt; right now I have some of the ugliest, wonkiest, most off-kilter
&gt; eight-point stars you've ever seen. Why can't I master this &quot;simple&quot;
&gt; block?????? I am going to include an 8-point star in my next quilt,
&gt; somewhere or somehow, or be darned trying.

&gt; Anyway you're right. Frustration comes from lack of experience and
&gt; skill. And I need more work. I think what I need mostly to do is hunker
&gt; down and pay no attention to my whining stash and sewing machine for a
&gt; while. Maybe I'll crochet for a while.

&gt; Hugs,

&gt;&gt;&gt; It sounds from your post that we are very much in the same frame of mind
&gt;&gt;&gt; at the mo.  That's why I have decided to make 2007 &quot;The Year of Me&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yep that's what I've decided and so far I've taken little baby steps
&gt;&gt;&gt; towards it. For instance, and this may shock some of you, I am horribly,
&gt;&gt;&gt; totally, incomprehensibly addicted to Days of Our Lives and The Bold and
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Beautiful.  True.  During this forced break from work (ie
&gt;&gt;&gt; schoolholidays) I have made time to watch both shows, religiously, each
&gt;&gt;&gt; day - well almost. And I love it.  The kids know it and respect it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Husband makes fun of it. But it's &quot;me&quot; time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've also decided that the Year of Me is when I become fitter and learn
&gt;&gt;&gt; to love Me more.  On this resolution I'm at the Commando Crawl stage.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Haven't quite managed to give myself the time but I'm getting there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's do it together Sunny - baby steps and encouragement all the way

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for the good words. Sharon, your suggestions are good and sound
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and ultimately I know that's what will bring me back. Leslie, I share
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those same frustrations with you. I know that's a huge part of my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem. I get so discouraged. I look at the amazing work in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quilting shows and magazines and in my head I can do work like that,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then I read the bios and always it's &quot;using my engineeering background&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and &quot;after my master's degree in art&quot; and &quot;as a graphic artist&quot; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that sort of thing. These people are artists, trained and experienced.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have zero artistic training and not likely to get any. And I'm not a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; natural talent. I can mix colors in really fun ways f rom time to time,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but design totally escapes me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I go to a round robin of art quilters. Those women are amazing and they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inspire me. Three are really incredible &quot;paint&quot; artists, two
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; professional. Several others have extensive artistic training. One who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think was trained in art school is perhaps the most amazing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; She goes to seminars and training sessions with the really big name
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quilt artists and then incorporates what she learns into her work. Wow.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Her work is gorgeous. And she is so generous about bringing information
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back from her seminars. I feel like a fake in the midst of these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; talented women

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I find myself at the age of 50 terribly contemplative. All my life I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; put my family first. My husband's career before mine. My children's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; needs before my work or even my intellectual needs. I never &quot;made my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mark.&quot; I worked and I did some good work. I wrote some good articles,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sounded real smart a couple times. But I never did anythign that will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be remembered after I'm gone (except give birth, LOL). These years,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with my boys grown, was to be the time of my life to dig in, put my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work first. To study and write and create. Well, illness put a stop to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that. Now I hesitate to take classes because I know I'll never be able
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to go enough to make it work. I find that I am terribly self-pitying. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not only admire the amazing people around me creating incredible, prize
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; winning quilts, I envy them and covet their abilities. But at my point
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in life, it's unlikely that I'll attain such a level. Especially
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; considering the dearth of energy I have and the frequent life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interruptions -- the days I spend in pain unable to read, watch, think.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The days when I am unbearably confused.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh I'm sorry. Apologies for letting my self-pity get to me and for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blurting way, way too much information. LOL.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I will get back to work at some point. I'm moving my quilting area from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the basement room into my very own room -- 11 x 12 with my stash sauna
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; acting as a closet. It's been the &quot;computer&quot; room and I've had to step
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over people to get to the sauna, which has resulted in taking too much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out and now all is in pandemonium. I can't find anything. So I will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spend this week cleaning, straightening, finding forgotten things. And
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; next week for the very first time I'll have &quot;my very own room&quot;. I just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hope I can recall my creativity from the Bahamas in time to make the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; move worthwhile.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks and hugs for the help,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sunny

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And yes, I think it's possible that my creativity has taken a hike to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Bahamas.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It sounds from your post that we are very much in the same frame of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mind at the mo.  That's why I have decided to make 2007 &quot;The Year of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Me&quot;. Yep that's what I've decided and so far I've taken little baby
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; steps towards it. For instance, and this may shock some of you, I am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; horribly, totally, incomprehensibly addicted to Days of Our Lives and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Bold and the Beautiful.  True.  During this forced break from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work (ie schoolholidays) I have made time to watch both shows,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; religiously, each day - well almost. And I love it.  The kids know it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and respect it. Husband makes fun of it. But it's &quot;me&quot; time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've also decided that the Year of Me is when I become fitter and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learn to love Me more.  On this resolution I'm at the Commando Crawl
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stage. Haven't quite managed to give myself the time but I'm getting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's do it together Sunny - baby steps and encouragement all the way

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for the good words. Sharon, your suggestions are good and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sound
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and ultimately I know that's what will bring me back. Leslie, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; share
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those same frustrations with you. I know that's a huge part of my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem. I get so discouraged. I look at the amazing work in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quilting shows and magazines and in my head I can do work like that,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then I read the bios and always it's &quot;using my engineeering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; background&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and &quot;after my master's degree in art&quot; and &quot;as a graphic artist&quot; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that sort of thing. These people are artists, trained and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experienced.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have zero artistic training and not likely to get any. And I'm not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; natural talent. I can mix colors in really fun ways f rom time to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but design totally escapes me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I go to a round robin of art quilters. Those women are amazing and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inspire me. Three are really incredible &quot;paint&quot; artists, two
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; professional. Several others have extensive artistic training. One
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think was trained in art school is perhaps the most amazing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; She goes to seminars and training sessions with the really big name
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quilt artists and then incorporates what she learns into her work.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Her work is gorgeous. And she is so generous about bringing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; information
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back from her seminars. I feel like a fake in the midst of these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; talented women

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I find myself at the age of 50 terribly contemplative. All my life I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; put my family first. My husband's career before mine. My children's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; needs before my work or even my intellectual needs. I never &quot;made my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mark.&quot; I worked and I did some good work. I wrote some good
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; articles,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sounded real smart a couple times. But I never did anythign that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be remembered after I'm gone (except give birth, LOL). These years,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with my boys grown, was to be the time of my life to dig in, put my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work first. To study and write and create. Well, illness put a stop
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that. Now I hesitate to take classes because I know I'll never be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; able
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to go enough to make it work. I find that I am terribly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; self-pitying. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not only admire the amazing people around me creating incredible,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prize
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; winning quilts, I envy them and covet their abilities. But at my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in life, it's unlikely that I'll attain such a level. Especially
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; considering the dearth of energy I have and the frequent life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interruptions -- the days I spend in pain unable to read, watch,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The days when I am unbearably confused.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh I'm sorry. Apologies for letting my self-pity get to me and for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blurting way, way too much information. LOL.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I will get back to work at some point. I'm moving my quilting area
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the basement room into my very own room -- 11 x 12 with my stash
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sauna
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; acting as a closet. It's been the &quot;computer&quot; room and I've had to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; step
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over people to get to the sauna, which has resulted in taking too
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out and now all is in pandemonium. I can't find anything. So I will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spend this week cleaning, straightening, finding forgotten things.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; next week for the very first time I'll have &quot;my very own room&quot;. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hope I can recall my creativity from the Bahamas in time to make the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; move worthwhile.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks and hugs for the help,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sunny

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And yes, I think it's possible that my creativity has taken a hike
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Bahamas.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; needs before my work or even my intellectual needs. I never &quot;made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mark.&quot; I worked and I did some good work. I wrote some good
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; articles,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sounded real smart a couple times. But I never did anythign that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be remembered after I'm gone (except give birth, LOL). These years,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with my boys grown, was to be the time of my life to dig in, put my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work first. To study and write and create. Well, illness put a stop
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that. Now I hesitate to take classes because I know I'll never be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; able
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to go enough to make it work. I find that I am terribly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; self-pitying. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not only admire the amazing people around me creating incredible,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prize
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; winning quilts, I envy them and covet their abilities. But at my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in life, it's unlikely that I'll attain such a level. Especially
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; considering the dearth of energy I have and the frequent life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interruptions -- the days I spend in pain unable to read, watch,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The days when I am unbearably confused.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh I'm sorry. Apologies for letting my self-pity get to me and for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blurting way, way too much information. LOL.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I will get back to work at some point. I'm moving my quilting area
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the basement room into my very own room -- 11 x 12 with my stash
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sauna
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; acting as a closet. It's been the &quot;computer&quot; room and I've had to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; step
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over people to get to the sauna, which has resulted in taking too
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out and now all is in pandemonium. I can't find anything. So I will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spend this week cleaning, straightening, finding forgotten things.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; next week for the very first time I'll have &quot;my very own room&quot;. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hope I can recall my creativity from the Bahamas in time to make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; move worthwhile.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks and hugs for the help,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sunny

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And yes, I think it's possible that my creativity has taken a hike
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Bahamas.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Sunny
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Taria had the same problem a few weeks ago. I don't know if she's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; got
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; her &quot;groove&quot; back yet or not..... sometimes it just takes a while.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about just some dinner napkins or beverage coasters? Something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easy and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mindless...... never fear - your creativity will return soon -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weather we're having here in Washington, maybe it went on a trip
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bahamas!

Aren't they?!  Alas I'm back at work today so will have to restrict my
viewing to 10 mins on Wednesdays and then one whole hour on Fridays.  I
can't, just CAN'T bring myself to tape it every day!!

Leaving tomorrow to visit Mom in Pensacola, Fl and to go to the Quilt Show
in Robertsdale, Al this weekend so probably won't get much Days watching
done this week. Mom keeps me pretty busy while I'm there. LOL
