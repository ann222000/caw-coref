The truth about why politicians cannot do without security-men

In the movie Corporate, a fat politician visits call-girls with his security men posted outside the room. They were there to prevent him from getting caught. This fairly sums up the situation in our country - misuse of every possible thing by politicians. Reflecting the people's disgust with this species, the Delhi High Court has asked politicians not to come out of their homes if they feel scared of the very people who have put them in power. A Bench comprising Justice T S Thakur and Justice Veena Birbal informed an aghast Central Government that the very existence of some of these self-declared high-security risk politicians is a threat to the common people. Express India further reports the heavy sarcasm with which the judges reminded the police to not treat politicians as national assets and to rather focus on the protection of the common citizen. All this is very well, but politicians being what they are one feels that all sarcasm is invariably lost on them. Instead, some might even be glad that the Courts could not be indifferent to them. Any opportunity to hear their own names mentioned in any context gladdens the hearts of these self-centred women and men.

There are two issues involved in politicians being surrounded by gun-totting impassive security-men. Firstly, politicians love to flaunt their status, importance and power to everyone. Also there is the subtle hint that if you or I oppose them, then we will be beaten to a pulp in no time. Politicians sometimes with little or no personalities thus are able to convey a sense of false courage and control over the masses. The second more hidden reason why politicians crave for security-men to surround them can only be understood if we contrast the physiques of the security men and most of our politicians. While the former are healthy and virile, the latter are mostly freakish in being either excessively obese, puny or in some other way, physically repulsive. As if the inner rotten-man is always struggling to come out. They subconsciously use the more acceptable physicality of the security-forces to lull this sense of repulsion in the public. Psychoanalysts call this process 'transference'. At a more basic and simple level, all over India politicians have been known to use their guards for manual services like carrying home their daily shopping or doing their laundries. We can now be sure that very soon politicians throughout the nation will roundly condemn the judges and whine why they cannot do without security-men in such violent times. They will also pompously declare that the judiciary has no business in talking of the legislature and the great men and women elected by the public. We must thank the Indian judiciary for at least trying very hard to rid the country of the different scourges that plague us. Our judiciary has been consistently proactive in belling the giant cats.
