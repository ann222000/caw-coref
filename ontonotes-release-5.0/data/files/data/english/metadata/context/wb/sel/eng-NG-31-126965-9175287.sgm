I'd say this was a weird one.  Someone in a not-HTML group (a browser
group it was) this morning asked for a way to have the user that clicks
on a link be sent to a URL in the anchor's title attribute rather than
to the hreffed URL.

Anyone ever heard of such?

Yes, I have the thread set for &quot;watch&quot;.  I just thought it might be an
interesting thing to look at here.

It's of course impossible in HTML. Playing with JavaScript, you could modify
the href attribute value when the link is clicked on, or you could directly
tell the browser to go to a specific address. User agents with JavaScript
disabled or not in use would naturally keep using the original href
attribute. Maybe this is the idea? Cheating indexing robots to think that
the page links to page X when it in fact &quot;links&quot; to Y when JavaScript is
enabled.

I'd classify this along with those.  Naturally my first knee-jerk

It might be intended to deceive search engines rather than users directly.
But such deception, too, is ultimately aimed at deceiving people.

I have to disagree with your note somewhat, though. The &quot;tooltip&quot; effect is
not ubiquous, it is not required by any specification, etc. Neither is the
&quot;status line&quot; effect (displaying the URL in the browser's status line on
mouseover), but it's something that _has_ been meant for showing the URL,
whereas the title attribute is not meant for that but for use as &quot;advisory
title&quot;.

The direct deception, whether intentional or not, arises from the fairly
natural user behavior of looking at the status line to see the URL.

Weird? Yes. To fake out search engines? Possibly.

But the way I see it, Jonathan, who posted the &quot;fiendish but creative code&quot;
just gave phishers, scammers, and malware senders ANOTHER way to get people
to go to sites where the sole purpose in life is to cheat the poor slobs who
don't see the cheat.

First thing I thought of when I read the above was something like the
following:

&quot;Use this link to change your Login info: Mobile Fun&quot; [underlying link:
http:// 219.70.221.5/]

which is one of the scam/malware emails that can be found at my page
http://www.orangefrogproductions.com/ofp2s_malware_email_example_009-... .

From my experience, those who try to hide to where a page links, are trying
to pass viruses, spyware, porn, phishing pages, etc., not cheat the search
engines. Yes, those of us &quot;in the know&quot; can rollover the link and see the
underlying one, and the title, so if a link appears in that attribute that
doesn't match, we can be forwarned. But &quot;Average Joe/Jane&quot; user don't
realize the implications. (One of the reasons for my Scams info.)

Please be careful the code you post. (This is one of the first times I've
seen this type of questions and full code posted.) - You might just be
giving the &quot;bad guys&quot; more ammo! (It's nice to know how its done, but why
show THEM?)

(Sorry if I come off like being on a &quot;high horse&quot;, but GEEZE!)

Not really. My code was not that unique, nor creative. Most of the link
scamming is found in emails. If you allow JavaScript to run in email
and are dumb enough to click on links within emails, especially from
unknown sources you deserve what you get!

Of course it also helps to have client software that shows the status
bar by default, has option to block JavaScript manipulation of the
status bar. Punycodes those spoofed URLs...and last but not least a
little common sense in Layer 8.

My point is that there are VERY many people who only know email and get to
the internet BY clicking on links in them. Few of them know to (or HOW to)
check each link, and many of them are scammed every day. Dumb doesn't enter
into it. &quot;Inexperienced&quot; and &quot;naive&quot; do NOT equate to &quot;dumb&quot;. SHOULD they
know better? Sure, but many don't, and don't know how to use search engines
to find out about it. Should they have internet access if they are that
naive? Of course. For some people, it's their only contact with the &quot;outside
world&quot;. For example, my late grandmother, 91yo - died this year, kept in
contact with her boys, her grandkids and great-grandkids via email and the
occassional IM. And she had our family to tell her what to watch out for.
But there are many who don't have that &quot;backup&quot; to help them. Why should
they have to suffer the losses imposed by the &quot;bad guys&quot;? According to your
statement, they deserve it. I disagree, wholeheartedly!

Whose common sense? Many people have tons of common sense, but don't know
that much about computers (see above). And again, why should those without
CCS (Computer Common Sense) be made to suffer?

My point there is - unique or not, unsophisticated or not - there are those
HS and younger buttheads who will try anything (no matter who it hurts) for
fun. Why should we TEACH them - give them complete code (as you did) to
screw up other people's lives and computers, and actually EXPLAIN to them
how to do it? Make them search harder, and possibly have to pull the pieces
together themselves. You can qualify it as &quot;pure discussion&quot; if you like,
but that means that someone could post full code for viruses, and get away
with it by saying the same thing. (And I'm sure there are sites and
newsgroups with ALL of that crap on them!) Why make it so easy to find?

(don't know you well enough! :-) ), just the posting of actual, full code to
do nasty things, again, no matter how &quot;pure&quot; the original poster (other

I can't speak for current versions (because I don't have one), but I
remember when Outlook Express (probably the most widely used email client on
the planet) allowed javascript to be executed in emails / newsgroup messages
out of the box. I found this out when some scrote posted a message to a
newsgroup that contained &quot;while(1==1) { window.open; }&quot; in it... After I
rebooted the PC I found out that OE uses the IE internet &quot;safety&quot; settings,
and by default used the Trusted setting. Altering that setting was the only
way to stop OE from executing Javascript - this option wasn't available in
any of OE's own settings.

So your comment that &quot;If you allow javascript to run in email ... you
deserve what you get&quot; is not really fair because many people may be allowing
javascript to run in emails without even knowing it.

Nige

I dumped that turkey back in the 90's! Maybe we should put up a banner,
hirer a pilot and sky write, don't use OE for your email. Just about
anything else would be better! I still have old Communicator 4.61 on for
test and it has the ability to disable JavaScript in mail and
newsgroups, although back in 99 it was a more naive time it was on by

Maybe they should learn. I love this new Public Service ad that they are
running in the US lately showing a scruffy guy trying to pull the old
fake check scam to a lady on a bus. In person it very obvious that it's
bogus.. the ad tries to show that in an email it still stinks.
