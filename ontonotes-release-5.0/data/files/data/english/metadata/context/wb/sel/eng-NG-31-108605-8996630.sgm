Just re-watched the Cruel Sea.  If you have the DVD about 1:40 into
the movie there is an obvious newsreel insert of an intense AA action,
probably filmed in the pacific.  The stern of a battleship, with what
appears to be two Kingfishers perched on it, briefly comes into view.
It appears to be a Maryland class BB.  Anyone confirm or refute?
