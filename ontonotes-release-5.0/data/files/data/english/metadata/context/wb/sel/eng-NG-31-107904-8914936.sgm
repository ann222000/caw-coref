Edwards tells Americans to give up SUVs

Associated Press - Wednesday August 29, 2007

Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards today said he would ask
Americans to give up their SUVs, as he set out his plans to curb carbon
emissions.

At a forum held by the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers in Florida, Mr Edwards said he believe Americans were
&quot;actually willing to sacrifice&quot;.

He said &quot;one of the things they should be asked to do is drive more fuel
efficient vehicles.&quot; When asked if this meant telling voters to give up
their SUVs the former senator said &quot;yes&quot;.

Mr Edwards was clearly popular with the group, several times drawing
standing ovations, including once when he said weapons and equipment
used by the US military needed to be made in the United States.

He said tanks and ammunition for M16 rifles are being made in other
countries.

&quot;If your tax dollars are being used to produce the products that keep
America safe, that provide defence for the American people, those jobs
should remain in the United States of America,&quot; he said. He also said as
president he would ask residents to conserve energy and said the US
needs to focus on being a leader in creating alternative energy.

He said he wants a national cap on carbon dioxide emissions that is
lowered each year.

&quot;We are the worst polluter on the planet. We are 4% of the world's
population, we're putting out 25% of the world's greenhouse gas,&quot; Mr
Edwards said. &quot;America's going to have to change.&quot;

Socialist, commie, neo-con... no difference. All want central control to

What's new is that more and more people buy into the BS
they base these things on and they become ever bolder and more dangerous

The carbon tax is based on the fraud of CO2 driven global warming, and
might as well just be a breathing tax for all effective purposes. Those
who believe CO2 is a problem should just stop breathing to help solve it.

Not sure what you are getting at. There are differing theories regarding
WTC 1,2,and 7 that are supported by different people in science and
engineering discplines. Some agree with the government theory others do
not.

I know the media paints a picture than anyone who doesn't believe in the
government story believes in space beams, alien attacks, and other
nonsense for the WTC buildings, but that isn't the universal case.

Or are you trying to say those who accept what government says about one
thing accept it about others? That's true in some respects, but in the
USA it generally breaks down along the lines the media defines as
'liberal' and 'conservative'. For instance, a media definition
conservative believes the government on 9-11 but considers it lying
that global warming is man made. The media definition liberal is the other
way around.

If that was some sort of dig at me, well, I think that government must
meet a very high standard of proof to be believed on anything. Especially
things that it uses to justify greater power. (ie, global warming, 9-11)
Hell, if government is using something to get greater power we can be
pretty damn sure it's lying in some form or fashion.

So we're told though i suspect he himself started that talk. He'd rather

How many Republicans are giving up their SUVs and jets?

Can you name one?

Whether you believe in global warming or pollution, peak oil is
something that is very real and is going to pound the shit out of the US
economy in the very near future and has already started.

I don't see one single Republican proposing one single realistic solution.

In fact, the only President who has ever done anything meaningful
regarding peak oil was Jimmy Carter, and you wingnuts still are pissed
about that one.

While you fuckwits are squealing &quot;hypocrite&quot; like a little schoolgirl,
the economy is going down the toilet.

By the time you dipshits figure out SUVs aren't such a brilliant idea,
you'll be sucking Saudi cock for your oil fix.

You're confusing reserves vs production capability.

Peak oil has almost nothing to do with reserves.

You can only pull out out of the ground so fast without destroying the
deposit, no matter how much is in the deposit.

All deposits eventually reach their peak at some point and start to
decline as far as how much you can produce from a given deposit.

The US deposits (still the largest single source) reached their peak
decades ago and have been declining ever since.

*Such* sacrifices they (whether North or South) shouldn't need to make
either, since oil is plentiful and can be extracted, in many regions

So you're saying big oil is lying to their share holders while promoting
peak oil?  Guess you do not know that crude oil production is constantly
tweaked by oil companies and nations to manipulate the market price.
Saddam Hussien fell into disfavor because he broke ranks with the cartel
and started pumping flat-out, balls-to-the-wall to pay off the iran-iraq
war debt. Fooling him into thinking the US wouldn't do anything if
invaded Kuwait was just classic... Guess old saddam there wasn't fully up

I've already posted about the massive reserves of less conventional oil
in the americas several times over. If you don't know about the oil in
the USA that has been blocked off for environmental reasons you live in a
cave and shouldn't be discussing the issue. Same if you don't understand
that Iraq's oil taps are effectively turned off as well as some in africa
due to war.

Where do you get your info?

Global oil discovery peaked in 1962 and has declined to virtually nothing in the
past few years. We now consume 6 barrels of oil for every barrel we find.
&lt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1233533,00.html &gt;

More from Life After the Oil Crash:

According to an October 2004 New York Times article entitled &quot;Top Oil Groups
Fail to Recoup Exploration Costs:&quot;

. . . the top-10 oil groups spent about $8bn combined on exploration last year,
but this only led to commercial discoveries with a net present value of
slightly less than $4bn. The previous two years show similar, though less
dramatic, shortfalls.

In other words, significant new oil discoveries are so scarce that looking for
them is a monetary loser. Consequently, many major oil companies now find
themselves unable to replace their rapidly depleting reserves. A June 2006
report indicated the world's biggest five oil companies are now &quot;focusing on
developing existing reserves.&quot; That's a nice way of saying &quot;there aren't enough
significant sized oil fields left to find to make it worth our time and money
to look for them.&quot;

Take a look at the above chart. During the 1960s, for instance, we consumed
about 6 billion barrels per year while finding about 30-60 billion per year.
Given those numbers, it is easy to understand why fears of &quot;running out&quot; were
so often dismissed as unfounded.

Unfortunately, those consumption/discovery ratios have nearly reversed
themselves in recent years. We now consume close to 30 billion barrels per year
but find less than 4 billion per year.

In light of these trends, it should come as little surprise that the energy
analysts at John C Herold Inc. - the firm that foretold Enron's demise -
recently confirmed industry rumors that we are on the verge of an unprecedented
crisis.

page 3:
&quot;Our Upstream business started up seven major

Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Norway, and Canada. These
projects are the culmination of many years of investment
and development. Each of these projects is delivering new
supplies of oil and natural gas to global markets and value
to resource owners and our shareholders. In addition, we
made significant progress in advancing our large portfolio
of projects currently in development and further enhanced
operations of our producing assets.&quot;

Page 5:
&quot;Proved reserves additions replaced 122 percent of production&quot;

Replaced reserves increased 22% more than what they pumped. SWIMMING IN
OIL. They have more oil at the end of 2006 than they had at the end of 2005.

So, why don't you put away the media lies, go to the horses mouth. Use
the information that the investment class uses. It will tell you the real
story instead of the sucker story. We are being told a sucker story that
increases their profits. It's about monopoly (or at least just a few
companies) and artifical scaricity. Production is controlled to maximize
profit.

Because free market forces have been effectively weakened/disabled in the
oil industry there is no fear someone else is going to come along and
start pumping oil and cause the price to be driven down. Especially when
the US military will kick the ass of any country that tries.

&gt;&gt; companies) and artifical scaricity. Production is controlled to maximize
&gt;&gt; profit.

&gt;&gt; Because free market forces have been effectively weakened/disabled in the
&gt;&gt; oil industry there is no fear someone else is going to come along and
&gt;&gt; start pumping oil and cause the price to be driven down. Especially when
&gt;&gt; the US military will kick the ass of any country that tries.

Your peak oil scaremongering is nothing but another excuse of many to
create a new version of a european middle ages economy.

You're missing the point.  I don't hear any SUV driving Republicans
telling everybody to give up their SUVs.

The market will determine the solution.  We don't need government to
fuck it up.  When oil gets too expensive, alternative energies will
overtake it by necessity.  Happens all the time with all sorts of
products and commodities.

&gt;Edwards tells Americans to give up SUVs

&gt;Associated Press - Wednesday August 29, 2007

&gt;Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards today said he would ask
&gt;Americans to give up their SUVs, as he set out his plans to curb carbon
&gt;emissions.

&gt;At a forum held by the International Association of Machinists and
&gt;Aerospace Workers in Florida, Mr Edwards said he believe Americans were
&gt;&quot;actually willing to sacrifice&quot;.

&gt;He said &quot;one of the things they should be asked to do is drive more fuel
&gt;efficient vehicles.&quot; When asked if this meant telling voters to give up
&gt;their SUVs the former senator said &quot;yes&quot;.

&gt;Mr Edwards was clearly popular with the group, several times drawing
&gt;standing ovations, including once when he said weapons and equipment
&gt;used by the US military needed to be made in the United States.

&gt;He said tanks and ammunition for M16 rifles are being made in other
&gt;countries.

&gt;&quot;If your tax dollars are being used to produce the products that keep
&gt;America safe, that provide defence for the American people, those jobs
&gt;should remain in the United States of America,&quot; he said. He also said as
&gt;president he would ask residents to conserve energy and said the US
&gt;needs to focus on being a leader in creating alternative energy.

&gt;He said he wants a national cap on carbon dioxide emissions that is
&gt;lowered each year.

&gt;&quot;We are the worst polluter on the planet. We are 4% of the world's
&gt;population, we're putting out 25% of the world's greenhouse gas,&quot; Mr
&gt;Edwards said. &quot;America's going to have to change.&quot;
">

So he thinks SUVs are a big problem? Well, let's do a little
math.
Automobiles are estimated by people who know what they're
talking about to represent about 10% to 11% of air pollution. That's
automobiles in total, the World over.
SUVs are what percentage of total automobiles?

So Edwards wants you to focus on SUVs and ignore industry,
which is responsible for the vast majority? And he knows that
industrialists would still be reaping huge profits even if they did
install more advanced pollution control equipment, contrary to their
lobbyist's ridiculous claims. Tells you something about him, doesn't
it?

No it isn't.  The automobile is responsible for a huge proportion of
the CO2 output of humanity.

Is there any pollution control equipment that will prevent the release

What is huge? And what percentage of that &quot;huge proportion&quot; is SUV's?
