&quot;Many in the US Military Think Bush and Cheney Are Out of Control&quot;
der Spiegel Interview with Gabriel Kolko
der Spiegel, Germany

Monday 15 October 2007

In an interview with SPIEGEL ONLINE, the Amsterdam-based military
historian Gabriel Kolko talks about the prospect of war with Iran and
argues that many in the US military now view the White House as being
&quot;out of control.&quot;

Spiegel Online: Mr. Kolko, editorials in US papers like the Wall
Street Journal, the Weekly Standard and the National Review are
pushing for military action against Iran. How does the leadership in
the US military view such a conflict?

Gabriel Kolko: The American military is stretched to the limit.
They are losing both wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Everything is being
sacrificed for these wars: money, equipment in Asia, American military
power globally, etc. Where and how can they fight yet another? The
Pentagon is short of money for procurement, and that is what so many
people in the military bureaucracy live for. The situation will be far
worse in the event of a war with Iran.

Many in the American military have learned the fundamental dilemma
of modern warfare: More money and better weapons don't mean that you
win. IEDs, which cost so little to make, are defeating a military
which spends billions of dollars per month. IEDS are so adaptable that
each new strategy developed by the United States to counter them is
answered by the Iraqi insurgents. The Israelis were also never quite
able to counter IEDs. One report quotes an Israeli military engineer
who said the Israeli answer to IEDs was frequently the use of armored
bulldozers to effectively rip away the top 18 inches of pavement and
earth where explosive devices might be hidden. This is fantastic, as
the cost of winning means destroying roads, which form the basis of a
modern economy.

Spiegel Online: Are people in the Pentagon getting nervous about
how influential voices in the White House continue to push for
conflict with Iran?

Kolko: Many in the US military think Bush and Cheney are out of
control. They are rebelling against Bush and Cheney. Washington Post
reporter Dana Priest recently said in an interview that she believed
the US military would revolt and refuse to fly missions against Iran
if the White House issued such orders.

CENTCOM [US Central Command, the military grouping whose
responsibilities include the Middle East] commander Admiral William
Fallon reportedly thwarted Cheney's wish to sent a third additional
aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf. One paper wrote that he &quot;vowed
privately there would be no war against Iran as long as he was chief
of CENTCOM.&quot;

Lt. Gen. Bruce Wright, in charge of US forces in Japan, told the
Associated Press last week that the Iraq war had weakened American
forces in the face of any potential conflict with China. He was quoted
as saying, &quot;Are we in trouble? It depends on the scenario. But you
have to be concerned about the small number of our forces and the age
of our forces.&quot;

Spiegel Online: Do you think that conflict with Iran is likely?

Kolko: All the significant economic journals (Financial Times,
Wall Street Journal, etc.) recognize that the American and European
economies are now in a crisis, and it may be protracted. The dollar is
falling; Gulf States and others may abandon it (as an investment
currency). A war with Iran would produce economic chaos because oil
would be scarce. There are states which the United States wishes to
isolate, like Russia and Venezuela, who can develop great influence
through their ability to sell oil in such a crisis. The balance of
world economic power is involved, and that is a great issue.

Spiegel Online: But aren't the Gulf States interested in seeing
Iran weakened through a conflict with the United States?

Kolko: The Gulf States do not like Shia Iran, but they export oil,
which makes them rich. They are dependent on peace, not war.

Spiegel Online: How would Iran react to a provocation by the
United States, say, on the border? Could the Iranian military in any
way be a match for the United States?

Kolko: Iran fought Iraq for about a decade and lost hundreds of
thousands of men. Perhaps they will roll over, but it is not likely.
There are a number of tiny islands in the gulf they have had years to
fortify. Can 90 percent of their weapons be knocked out? Even if this
United States could achieve this, the remainder would be sufficient to
sink many boats and tankers. The amount of oil exported through the
gulf would thereby be reduced, perhaps cease altogether. This would
only strengthen American rivals like Russia and Venezuela.

Spiegel Online: But what about the bunker-buster bombs? Wouldn't
that be a technology which Iran could not match?

Kolko: Bunker busters are only able to knock out so many bunkers,
but alas, not all. If bunker-buster bombs are nuclear they are very
useful, but they are also radioactive. In addition to killing
Iranians, they may also kill friends and nearby US soldiers.

Spiegel Online: What about the so-called 'Cheney plan' to let
Israel attack Iran? What role would Israel play in a conflict with
Iran? Isn't Israel also interested in seeing that the United States
weakens its greatest threat in the region?

Kolko: Israel may be a factor. They must cross Syrian and
Jordanian airspace, and the Iranians will be prepared if they are not
shot down over Syria. Their countermeasures may be effective, but
perhaps not ... War with Iran will lead to a rain of rockets and
Israel would be left with an inability to deal with local priorities.
Iran is likely to get nuclear bombs sooner or later. So will other
nations. Israel has hundreds already. Israeli strategists believe
deterrence will then exist. Why risk war?

Israel dislikes Iran and the prospect of Iranian nuclear weapons,
but they believe they can handle it with a deterrent relationship.
Israel needs its army, which is not large enough for potential nearby
problems - for Palestinians and its Arab neighbors, who it rightfully
fears and hates. That means Israel can be belligerent, but it is not
capable of playing the US role, except of course with nuclear weapons.

So I regard the Israelis as opponents of a war with Iran which
would involve them. They certainly noticed how during the war with
Lebanon the Palestinians in Gaza used the opportunity to increase
pressure on Israel from the south. Israelis opposed the Iraq war
because it would lead to Iranian domination of the region, which it
has.

Hence, the report that Cheney is trying to use Israel, if it is
true, shows that he's confused and quite mad - but also unusually
isolated.

Spiegel Online: But what about the Democratic Party? Isn't it in
the interest of the Democratic Party to do everything they can to end
the war?

Kolko: All three leading Democratic Party presidential hopefuls -
Clinton, Obama and Edwards - refused at a debate recently in New
Hampshire to promise to pull the US military out of Iraq by the
beginning of 2013. The American public is a small factor, as elections
have repeatedly shown, but may play some role also. As the last
election proved, anyone who thinks Democrats will stop wars is fooling
him- or herself. But war with Iran would require new authorizations.
Then the Congress would, potentially, be very important.

So weird.... a European &quot;expert&quot; who is negative about Bush and the US and
who uses specific like &quot;many think&quot;.   He'd qualify to be an American
left-winger, for sure, with all that hate for the US.

Anyone ever seen Hal with something positive to say about the US?

Why do people keep claiming our military cannot win &quot;a war&quot;?

WTF kind of war?  The kind where we fucking occupy a nation and
concern ourselves w/ navel-gazing and &quot;hearts and minds&quot;?

We could've conducted a war NOW by the rules we used 50 years ago and
our soldiers would be HOME right now.  There'd have been FAR less loss
of military AND civilian life too!

Do you mean 66 years ago? Fifty years ago the war was Korea and last time I
looked we still have substantial troops there and no peace treaty only an
armistice. I agree that we could have treated Iraq like Germany in 1945 and
kept peace and security in that country. However I think we had a few more
troops available to pacify Germany (counting the allies, USSR, Brittain
etc.) than we used for the same job in Iraq. Take care

I'll pick the nit.  We *already* won the war.  These idiots are confusing
a &quot;war&quot; with an &quot;occupation.&quot;  The two are not the same.  We won the war.
We kicked seat-meat and took over the frick'n nation.  End of war.
Period.  Just because there may be some comparatively minor &quot;insurgency&quot;
being waged, apparently funded, supported, and manned by neighboring
nations, doesn't mean that the war is still going on, to say nothing of
being &quot;lost.&quot;  That is simply absurd.  I wish I could say that it
surprises me that such idiocy to conflate &quot;war&quot; with &quot;occupation&quot; is taken
seriously by *anyone* (much less so many) but it doesn't.  I am resigned
to the stupidity of a large segment of the population which are well
represented by hal and Ted Kennedy.
