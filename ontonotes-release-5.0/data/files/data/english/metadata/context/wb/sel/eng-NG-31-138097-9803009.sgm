COVER STORY

Pakistan in turmoil

NIRUPAMA SUBRAMANIAN
in Islamabad

Hopes of a peaceful transition to democracy recede as Musharraf converts the emergency into virtual martial law.

KHALID TANVEER/AP

Police officers in uniform and plainclothes clash with lawyers in Multan on November 6.

Kafka would have loved this. After President Pervez Musharraf swore in a caretaker government headed by Muhammedmian Soomro on November 17, he offered some
words of wisdom to the outgoing Pakistan Muslim League government. &quot;Life continues and nobody is permanent. One comes, one serves, one tries to do one's
best in the interests of the nation, one leaves,&quot; he said.

Musharraf seemed not to realise the irony of these words. But then, the Pakistan ruler, who imposed emergency rule on November 3 ahead of a rumoured unfavourable
verdict from the Supreme Court against his candidacy in the October 6 presidential election, firmly believes that his actions saved the country and put
it back on the path to democracy.

Two weeks after he brought in the state of emergency and suspended the Constitution, thus virtually imposing martial law, Musharraf continued to defend
his decision as the only course available to him &quot;in the best interests of Pakistan&quot;. His first steps after imposing the emergency were to dismiss all
the judges of the higher judiciary; invite some to take the oath under a newly promulgated provisional constitutional order; lock up top lawyers, civil
rights activists and other political opponents; and ban private television channels, eventually shutting down two of them. But, according to him, all this
did not derail democracy. Instead, it helped prevent the Supreme Court from derailing democracy in Pakistan.

He had to take this action because the judges were threatening to frustrate his political push for democracy, with their &quot;confrontational&quot; attitude towards
him. Their judgments had left the government and law administration officials &quot;demoralised and paralysed&quot; in the &quot;war against terror&quot;, and the &quot;terrorists
encouraged&quot;. He held the judiciary responsible for worsening the law and order situation by ordering the release of terror suspects picked up by the intelligence
agencies and also during the Lal Masjid crisis in Islamabad. He blamed the media, which he had &quot;freed and liberated&quot;, for reporting &quot;untruths&quot; and &quot;distortions&quot;
and said they needed lessons in responsibility and that was why some channels had to be banned.

Now that the troublesome judges - &quot;the source of the problem&quot; - had been sacked and placed under house arrest, everything could go ahead as planned. He
would get sworn in as President for his new term as soon the new-look Supreme Court gave him the go-ahead, stepping down as the army chief before he takes
the oath of office. This he expects to happen by the end of November. The National Assembly finished its term on November 15 and elections are to be held,
on schedule, in the first week of January 2008. Meanwhile, the war on terror could continue uninterrupted by the judiciary.

For Musharraf, this neat political calendar proves that the emergency has &quot;put democracy back on the rails&quot;. The Pakistan ruler has often said that his
plan was to &quot;introduce&quot; democratic rule in Pakistan in three guided phases: the first phase was from October 1999, when he seized power after ousting Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif in a bloodless coup, up to 2002, &quot;when I was in absolute control&quot;. The second phase was from 2002, when a government came in after
elections and he took office as President, playing a &quot;supervisory&quot; role while remaining the Army chief. The third phase, which according to him will begin
when he takes oath as the civilian President, will mark the beginning of the transition to full democratic rule.

But as Pakistan braces for elections under emergency rule and a relentless crackdown on Musharraf's political opponents, there are few takers for this story
in the country or in the international community. The emergency is described as Musharraf's &quot;second coup&quot;, this time against the judiciary to pre-empt
a verdict against him. Even schoolchildren say that he imposed the emergency only to hang on to power and not, as he claimed, because the country was in
danger of being taken over by extremists owing to some Supreme Court judgments. People are demanding to know how, if deteriorating law and order situation
due to the terrorist threat was one of the reasons for the emergency, the Army could make a bargain to release militants in exchange for the release of
soldiers held hostage by pro-Taliban tribal people in the frontier areas even as they arrested moderate lawyers and civil rights activists. They ask why
the army had taken so long to launch an operation against Mullah Fazlullah, a radical preacher in Swat in the North West Frontier Province, until his private
army took control of large swathes of territory. They compare it to the six-month inaction in the case of Lal Masjid.

Musharraf has said that the emergency will help in conducting free and fair parliamentary elections, but no one is buying that. Prime Minister Muhammedmian
Soomro, who heads the caretaker government, is a member of the Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid), the ruling party since 2002, and is hardly seen as neutral.

Initially it looked as if Musharraf, despite his unpopularity in Pakistan, would still be able to come up trumps on his gamble of imposing the emergency.
The reaction from the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and its leader Benazir Bhutto was muted. Exiled to Jeddah, Nawaz Sharif could hardly be expected to
whip up a storm against Musharraf, especially as his party had shown its inability to collect a respectable enough crowd even for his September 10 aborted
return to Pakistan. The only resistance came from lawyers and civil society activists. But the police crackdown on protests meant fewer and fewer people
were coming out on the streets to protest. Those who could mobilise crowds had been jailed on day one of the emergency. Their list included prominent lawyers
such as Aitzaz Ahsan and office-bearers of bar associations countrywide. The government also placed Asma Jahangir, the prominent human rights activist,
under house arrest.

Musharraf also brought in an amendment to the Army Act empowering military courts to try civilians for a range of offences from sedition, terrorism and
the making of statements that could instigate &quot;public mischief&quot;. He denied that it was aimed at silencing critics and claimed that it was meant only to
strengthen the government's hands against terrorism. But it was condemned by the opposition parties and international human rights organisations as a reaffirmation
that the emergency was indeed martial law.

AFP

General Pervez Musharraf during a question and answer programme in Islamabad, on November 15. International pressure advanced on him in a pincer movement
with Benazir Bhutto's opposition.

However, sometime in the second week of the emergency, Musharraf's position began looking shaky. His first real setback came with an apparent turnaround
by Benazir. With the leader of the largest political party in Pakistan signalling that she had broken off all contacts with Musharraf for a possible power-sharing
deal and that was ready for battle along with other opposition political parties against Musharraf, the General looked to be in real trouble. Benazir and
Sharif, as well as leaders of other parties such as the Jamat-i-Islami, talked about the possibility of jointly boycotting elections. For the first time,
a rainbow coalition of the opposition began to look like a possibility.

International pressure too advanced on Musharraf in a pincer movement with Benazir's opposition. The Commonwealth, which expelled Pakistan for four years
in 1999 when Musharraf seized power from Sharif, threatened to do it again if the General did not roll back the emergency and restore the Constitution
and set him a 10-day deadline that is due to expire on November 23. But the country that really counts for Pakistan is the United States, which has the
power to squeeze Musharraf if it wants to by turning off the money tap, out of which $10 billion has already gushed out since 9/11.

In the days immediately after the coup, Washington gave out mixed signals, expressing disapproval of the emergency but making it clear that it was still
throwing its weight behind Musharraf, &quot;a trusted ally&quot; in the &quot;war on terror&quot;, as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other senior figures in the Bush
administration described him. But by the end of the second week of the emergency, very different signals were emerging from Musharraf's most important
international ally.

The George Bush administration backed a Benazir-Musharraf alliance as the best course for a stable Pakistan and, by extension, for its &quot;war on terror&quot;.
But with that idea looking shaky, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John D. Negroponte arrived in Islamabad with a &quot;strong message&quot; for President Musharraf
to lift the emergency immediately, step down as Army chief, remove the restrictions on the media and release all political prisoners. He was also expected
to convey that the U.S. was evaluating the aid to Pakistan in the light of the emergency, even as Benazir demanded that Washington must threaten Musharraf
with the suspension of financial assistance. It is not clear whether her new confrontationist position is a result of her reading of the tea leaves in
Washington and sensing that the Bush administration is now resigned to change, or whether the U.S. stills sets store by a Benazir-Musharraf power-sharing
deal and sent Negroponte to explore whether that is still in the realm of the possible.

Increasingly, the focus is on the role of the Pakistan Army and its likely reaction if the opposition joins hands to oust Musharraf. Will it continue to
stick with its chief?

Observers of the Pakistan military are divided on this. According to one school of thought, articulated in a recent editorial in The Friday Times, Musharraf
went to the extent of naming his successor as Army chief, and continues to insist that he will shed his uniform to become a civilian President, only because
he is confident that the army will never turn against him. If he suspected otherwise, he would not have done this. Nor would he have risked imposing a
virtual martial law, in defiance of opinion at home and abroad.

The Army's loyalty to him is said to spring from its deep apprehension that handing over power to politicians can only worsen the dangers that Pakistan
is facing to its integrity from Islamist, Al Qaeda-inspired militants who already control considerable territory inside Pakistan and a simmering insurgency
in Balochistan while the presence of U.S.-led coalition troops on the Afghan border constitutes a threat to the country's sovereignty. This school argues
that the military wants a civilian that it can trust, and Musharraf is their candidate for a powerful President. Musharraf himself said in an interview
that the Army had such faith in his leadership that it was impossible that it would move against him.

But another school of thought believes that if the Army begins to sense that its reputation as an institution is becoming damaged through Musharraf, it
may act to save itself. In this, the role of General Ashfaq Kayani, who is the new Vice-Chief of the Army Staff and the named successor to Musharraf when
he steps down as the Army chief, is said to be crucial.

Kayani owes his rise in the Army to Musharraf, but he is also believed to be close to Benazir, whom he served as military secretary during her first term
as Prime Minister. His rapport with Benazir is said to be one reason that Musharraf named him his successor, to prepare the ground for a power-sharing
deal with Benazir, and ensure a smooth working relationship between the troika of the President, the army chief and the Prime Minister. Kayani was also
one of the principal negotiators with Benazir - he was then heading the Inter-Services Intelligence - as the two sides hammered out the deal.

At a press conference, replying to a question about a possible withdrawal of support by the army to Musharraf, Benazir did not answer the question directly
but made an appeal to the army in her own garrulous way. She said she was sure that the army commanders, corps commanders, the vice-chief and the intelligence
chief understood the gravity of the situation.

&quot;I am sure they have loyalty to Gen. Musharraf. I am sure they respect him because he is the army chief, but it is a very difficult time for them when they
have to choose perhaps between loyalty to the country and loyalty to an individual.&quot;

BANARAS KHAN/AFP

In Quetta on November 14, self-chained Pakistani journalists protesting against the curbs on the media.

Expressing respect for Kayani, Benazir said she had not had the opportunity to meet him after her return to Pakistan. &quot;What I like to look at is the national
interest. I like to see on which road the national interest is propelling me, and I assume that for the military leadership that is also the issue. Where
is the national interest propelling them? Because it is the interests that need to coincide. I can't speak for him . but I can say from my interactions
with a lot of people there is an emotional tug going on. Not with Kayani but with many others I met because some do love Musharraf. They do understand
he has made some tough decisions when it was difficult to make those choices but there is time when you think of the nation. The time is now. Our army
commanders must think of the nation. I would appeal to them to think about the national interest.&quot;

In the last few months, beginning with Musharraf's misjudged attempt to remove Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary from the equation, through the lawyers'
agitation for Chaudhary's reinstatement, his triumphant comeback to the Supreme Court, and its subsequent confrontation with the executive, political debate
in Pakistan was divided between transformationists and transitionists.

The transitionists wanted compromise with Musharraf and the military as the best way towards a civilian democracy, while the transformationists wanted a
radical confrontation with the regime and the military for a democratic revolution. For the transitionists, confrontation would plunge Pakistan into a
bottomless abyss of militancy and extremism as Islamist radicals would rush into the turmoil and occupy all the political space. They applauded Benazir
for her political acumen in doing a deal with Musharraf, and warned that needling him would result in martial law or emergency rule. One sentence that
came up in conversations with transitionists as the Supreme Court issued one anti-government order after the other was: &quot;The judges are asking for it.&quot;

The transformationists, on the other hand, argued that confrontation was the only way Pakistan could be jolted out of a 60-year-old failure to build a democratic
nation. &quot;We have been transititioning to democracy forever. It's now or never,&quot; they said, dismissing the transitionists as stooges of the military, as
they egged on the judiciary to take on Musharraf and &quot;the Generals&quot;.

Hopes for the kind of transition envisaged by the Benazir-Musharraf deal are receding, and the chances of a political confrontation between Musharraf and
his political opponents are increasing. Pakistanis are praying that even if there is to be a transformation to democratic rule, it must be peaceful. .

They dared the General

NIRUPAMA SUBRAMANIAN

Some of the lawyers and politicians who were arrested for leading the anti-Musharraf campaign.

Judges

AP

Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammed Chaudhary: Sacked from the Supreme Court and under house arrest in Islamabad, as are 11 other judges of the court who did
not take the oath under the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO). The approach to his villa in Judges Enclave, a hillock with a scenic view of the Marghalla
hills, has been blocked with barricades and barbed wire. Chaudhary can still communicate with the outside world and has sporadically sent out messages
to the legal community to resist the emergency and boycott the judges who have taken the oath under the PCO.

Lawyers

AFP

Aitzaz Ahsan: In solitary confinement at Adiala jail, Rawalpindi. A Cambridge-educated lawyer, he headed the legal battle mounted by Iftikhar Chaudhary
against his March 9 &quot;suspension&quot;. He became Chaudhary's &quot;charioteer&quot; by driving him across the length and breadth of the country, from one bar association
to another, ostensibly to participate in some jubilee or other but actually to rally the legal community against President Pervez Musharraf.

A gifted speaker, in court he bullied the judges, massaged their egos and cajoled them by turn, referring to Musharraf as an &quot;usurper&quot; and asking them to
stand behind their Chief Justice. Outside, he held fiery press conferences at which he predicted that the President was running &quot;on empty&quot;.

He is a member of the Pakistan People's Party, but tensions between him and party leader Benazir Bhutto are well known. Ahsan opposed Benazir's &quot;deal&quot; with
Musharraf and the resulting National Reconciliation Ordinance, which swept out the corruption cases against her in return for the PPP's tacit support to
Musharraf in the presidential election. He was elected president of the Supreme Court Bar Association a week before the imposition of the emergency and
was among the first to be arrested.

Munir Malik: The president of the Supreme Court Bar Association during the lawyers' agitation for Chaudhary's reinstatement, which was achieved on July

20. Malik then declared that the legal fraternity would continue the struggle, this time to oust Musharraf. &quot;Bring back constitutionalism and the rule
of law&quot; was Malik's mantra as he mobilised bar associations between March and July.

Ali Ahmed Kurd: A lawyer from Balochistan, he is the only one to be taken into custody by military intelligence. His whereabouts are not known and some
reports say he is being held in a guest house outside Islamabad. A firebrand orator, he invited the wrath of the military when he attacked it and Musharraf
at a function held at the Supreme Court Bar Association auditorium in May. His Baloch identity did not help his case.

Tariq Mehmood: Now in jail. A retired judge and a former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, he was part of the team that mounted the legal
battle for Chief Justice Chaudhary. He was one of the pillars of the agitation, first for Chaudhary and later against Musharraf. He was associated, directly
or indirectly, with each one of the petitions against Musharraf contesting the presidential election.

Asma Jahangir: Has been freed from house arrest. chairperson of the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and a Supreme Court lawyer, she is known
internationally for her three-decades of struggle against injustices in Pakistan against women, children and members of minority communities.

AP

Jahangir's battle on behalf of the people who have disappeared since 2001, allegedly after being picked up by intelligence agencies as terror suspects,
has been a finger in the government's eye. She praised Musharraf for bringing changes to the draconian Hudood laws, which inflicted misery on thousands
of women, but said the changes were insufficient.

Politicians

Javed Hashmi: The acting president of Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (N), Hashmi seemed never too far away from arrest. In August, in one of his
first anti-Musharraf judgments after being reinstated, Iftikhar Chaudhary freed Hashmi, who had been behind bars since 2003, convicted of treason for trying
to incite a mutiny in the Pakistan Army.

AFP

His release gave the PML(N) some leadership in the absence of the exiled Nawaz Sharif. Jail did not mellow this parliamentarian. In his very first speech
on the floor of the National Assembly after his release, he lashed out at the military for being involved in politics.

In the months since then, Hashmi was in and out of jail as police cracked down on political activists.

Imran Khan: The former cricketer and leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf escaped house arrest in Lahore Robin Hood style, by scaling two - in his reckoning
- 10-foot-high walls. But he was captured by the police 10 days later when he emerged from hiding to lead a students' rally at the Punjab University campus.

AFP

Students of the Islami Jamiat-e-Taliba (IJT), the youth wing of Imran's apparent ally, the Jamaat-i-Islami, herded him into a building on campus, locked
him up, and handed him to the police.

It was an abrupt end to his attempt to mobilise students against the regime, but his arrest could actually help him gain a constituency among the youth
who are angry with the IJT for helping the regime.

Benazir's U-turn

NIRUPAMA SUBRAMANIAN

Benazir Bhutto goes at Musharraf hammer and tongs, but observers are still sceptical about the shift in her position.

MIAN KHURSHEED/REUTERS

A press conference at Benazir's residence in Lahore on November 16. She was freed from house arrest shortly before U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Negroponte
came to Pakistan.

Residents of Defence, Lahore's poshest housing colony, had never seen anything like it before. On November 13, outside their high-gated villas, where they
would normally walk their dogs or go for a jog, were an entire road blocked off with steel barricades; three lorries, brightly painted in the truck-art
style popular in Pakistan, standing back to back across the road and forming the second layer of the blockade; hundreds of policemen in uniform and plainclothes;
protesters who were swiftly thrown into police vans and driven away; and at least 100 journalists from all over the globe.

Behind the barricades was the home of Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Senator Latheef Khosa, where party leader Benazir Bhutto had only a few hours before
been served with a seven-day house-arrest order to prevent her from leading a march from Lahore through the Punjab province all the way to Islamabad. Benazir
had called the march to demand that President Pervez Musharraf lift the state of emergency, release all political workers who had been arrested since its
imposition, and roll back the curbs on the media.

Within a few hours of her house arrest, however, working the phones to Western journalists at the barricades, Benazir added to her list of demands one more
that she had never made before: Musharraf must stand down, not just as army chief but as President. She said that he had become part of the problem, that
he was siding with extremists, and that it was time for the international community to devise an &quot;exit strategy&quot; for him.

It was a 180° turn by Benazir. Less than a month before, on account of a deal with Musharraf, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's daughter returned to Pakistan after
eight years of self-exile in Dubai and London. Under the terms of the deal, her party gave tacit support to the General's October 6 re-election as President
in return for a presidential National Reconciliation Ordinance wiping the slate clean of all the corruption cases against her. Though thousands of party
workers from all corners of Pakistan turned out to greet her in Karachi, her political reputation, and that of the PPP's, was in tatters for having made
a deal with the military ruler.

After two bombs, apparently targeting Benazir, ripped through the welcome procession killing 140 people, many of them PPP workers, the former Prime Minister,
who escaped unhurt, blamed &quot;individuals&quot; in the government for conspiring to kill her. In a letter to Musharraf before her arrival in Pakistan, Benazir
had named them. Pakistani media later revealed that these individuals were Punjab Chief Minister Pervez Elahi, Intelligence Bureau chief Brigadier (retd.)
Ejaz Shah and former National Accountability Bureau (NAB) official Hassan Waseem Afzal (he was handling the corruption cases against her). In the same
letter, in another list of three people she wanted investigated in case of an attempt on her life, Benazir dropped Afzal's name and included former Inter-Services
Intelligence chief Lt. Gen. (retd.) Hamid Gul. But she said she would not blame Musharraf and defended her negotiations with him as a &quot;dialogue for a smooth
transition to democracy and civilian rule&quot;.

Those who stood for a Benazir-Musharraf alliance as the best antidote to tackle the rising extremism and militancy in Pakistan warned Benazir not to push
the General by attacking those close to him, as it could sour the deal and spoil the chances of a coalition of &quot;moderates&quot; taking charge of the country.
Her remarks triggered a war of words between the ruling faction of the Pakistan Muslim League and the PPP, placing Musharraf between his old band of supporters
and his new ally. Nonetheless, many were prepared to bet that the alliance would weather this storm.

Musharraf's November 3 imposition of a state of emergency changed the script completely. Benazir could no longer afford to be seen in contact with the regime.
A day earlier, she had left for Dubai, ostensibly to see her children, husband and mother who live there. But many said she had left the country on prior
information that Musharraf was about to take the extreme step of imposing emergency rule. A stinging editorial in Dawn on the morning of November 3 drew
attention to the uncertain times facing the country and the rumours of a state of emergency, and asked Benazir to return immediately putting Pakistan's
interests before her family's.

Benazir returned to Karachi hours after the declaration of emergency. Her credibility had sunk to such depths that even then it was thought that she had
returned only to take charge of a caretaker government under Musharraf's emergency. Some said Benazir stood to gain by the state of emergency - mainly,
a coup against the judiciary - as the National Reconciliation Ordinance could now be implemented unchallenged by the courts.

The question was why Benazir, the only political leader present in the country with demonstrated ability to bring people out on the streets, had not been
jailed, while those who could not gather more than a few dozens at best, such as former cricketer and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf leader Imran Khan or the
Pakistan Muslim League (N)'s Javed Hashmi, or civil society activists such as Asma Jahangir, had been arrested. Many doubted if she would actually take
on the regime.

The first sign of defiance in Benazir came on November 7, four days after the imposition of emergency rule, when she declared that the government must lift
&quot;martial law&quot; and reinstate the sacked Supreme Court judges. This was the first time she made a demand on behalf of the judiciary. She also demanded that
Musharraf, as army chief, fix a time frame for elections, release political prisoners and lift the restrictions on the media. Or else, Benazir said, she
would lead a long march from Lahore to Islamabad on November 13. She also threatened to turn a rally scheduled for November 9 at Rawalpindi into a mass
protest against the emergency.

Even on November 9, there were few takers for the apparent battle of nerves between Benazir and the police personnel who threw a ring around her Zardari
House in Islamabad and prevented her from going to Rawalpindi. The excuse the government gave was an intelligence report about the presence of &quot;seven or
eight&quot; suicide bombers in Rawalpindi, all targeting Benazir. The police cordoned off all roads leading to Rawalpindi, the twin city of the Pakistan capital,
and PPP workers who tried to break through the barricades were baton-charged and tear-gassed. Some were arrested.

Outside her home, more journalists than PPP activists had gathered as she tried to drive through the barricades before being blocked by an armoured car.
Confined to her home, she railed against the blockade and the security personnel. The government had issued an order for her house arrest but it was never
served. The U.S. demanded that the restrictions on her be lifted. Late at night, the government announced that it had withdrawn the detention orders.

The media's unanimous opinion was that the whole episode was a well-choreographed drama that allowed Benazir to regain her credibility and let Musharraf
save face. She had seemingly defied Musharraf by trying to break through the barriers instead of being seen as caving in to the regime's demand not to
hold a rally in Rawalpindi, but finally accepted her confinement.

But Benazir kept upping the ante. The next day, she made a surprise appearance outside the barricaded home of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary, demanding
she be allowed to meet him. When security personnel prevented her, she made a speech right there describing Chaudhary as the &quot;real Chief Justice&quot; and asking
for his immediate restoration. Her next stop was at the Islamabad offices of Aaj TV, banned since the imposition of emergency, where scores of journalists
were gathered in protest against two new ordinances curtailing editorial freedom of the electronic and print media. She expressed solidarity with the journalists
and declared she would go ahead with the &quot;long march&quot; against the emergency.

TARIQ MAHMOOD/AFP

Supporters of Nawaz Sharif at a rally in Peshawar on November 15. From his exile in Saudi Arabia, Sharif welcomed Benazir Bhutto's demand that a &quot;coalition
of interests&quot; take over the reins of Pakistan for the general elections.

When she arrived in Lahore on November 11 to prepare for the march two days later, it was quite certain that the government would not allow it to go ahead.
Meanwhile, Musharraf's attitude towards her also seemed to have hardened. At his first press conference after the imposition of emergency, he her popularity
as a figment of journalistic imagination. Musharraf also distanced himself from a power-sharing arrangement with her, saying that only the PPP's performance
in the next elections would determine whether she could become the next Prime Minister. He charged her with vitiating the atmosphere for reconciliation
by accusing members of the government of trying to kill her.

On the day before the planned march, there was a gradual build-up of security personnel outside Senator Khosa's home, where Benazir was camping in Lahore.
By evening, the barricades were in place and 200 policemen were deployed around the house. Early next day, hours before she was to set off on the march,
she was served house-arrest orders.

After that, for the first time, Benazir took on Musharraf directly. In a battery of interviews to the Western media, she explained her change in position
as the result of the imposition of emergency. &quot;I started negotiations with him on a road map to democracy, but he has gone back on his promises by imposing
martial law,&quot; she said. Claiming that &quot;thousands&quot; of PPP activists had been arrested in a countrywide crackdown, Benazir said that she had broken off all
contact with Musharraf and that he was not acceptable any more to her even as a civilian President.

She demanded that a &quot;coalition of interests&quot; take over the reins of Pakistan to conduct the general elections. From his exile in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan
Muslim League (N) leader Nawaz Sharif immediately welcomed her stand and expressed readiness to work with her. Conveying she was serious about working
with other opposition parties, she lost no time in making calls to all leaders, including Sharif, and even those with whom she did not want to share the
opposition platform earlier, such as Qazi Hussain Ahmed, leader of the right-wing religious Jamat-i-Islami.

&quot;I know that coalition-building is a difficult task. There will be many obstacles, but I am prepared to face them,&quot; she said, after being released from
house arrest three days ahead of schedule, a few hours before the arrival of U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John D. Negroponte.

Observers wonder whether the shift in her position is a genuine change of heart or brinkmanship to pile pressure on Musharraf to lift the emergency before
the elections. Another line of thinking is that her position may, in fact, indicate a shift in the U.S. thinking about Musharraf - that the George Bush
administration no longer wants to back him and is using Benazir to articulate its own changing policy.

But more and more sceptics say it is time to take her seriously. &quot;She wanted to work with Musharraf, she wanted the deal, but she has been overtaken by
events, and dragged kicking and screaming by the pressure within her own party, from her supporters outside, into the opposition camp,&quot; said Rashid Rehman,
executive editor of The Post.

Shafquat Mahmood, a former PPP Member of Parliament and one of Benazir's most scathing critics in the past few months for her deal with Musharraf wrote
in a recent article in The News: &quot;She has executed a huge U-turn and this is not without reason. She has finally fathomed the intensity of hatred within
the country and being an astute observer of the international scene, has concluded that his support abroad is rapidly eroding.&quot; Her turnaround, he said,
has the potential of pushing Musharraf out of power. .

Campus stirrings

ASIF HASSAN/AFP

Students at an anti-Musharraf rally in Islamabad on November 15.

HEAD half-covered with a fashionable magenta and black polka-dotted scarf matching her chiffon salwar kameez, Madeeha Sayed waited patiently with a group
of friends at the Faisal auditorium in Punjab University, Lahore. Imran Khan, the legendary cricket player and the leader of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf,
was expected on the campus to lead a students' rally against the imposition of emergency, and the girls were all set to be part of it. &quot;We want to convey
to the government that we are not happy with what they are doing, and we hope that we will have the opportunity today,&quot; said the second-year clinical psychology
student.

&quot;The judiciary has been paralysed, the media have been blocked, people have no rights. You can't speak your mind, you can't do what you want. We have to
speak up now for the sake of the country. Somehow, as students, I feel we are a neutral group, not like politicians, and we have an important role to play,&quot;
said the articulate Sayed.

Something strange is happening on the campuses in Pakistan. Four decades after the last students' protests against Ayub Khan, and three decades after another
military dictator, General Ziaul Haq, crushed students' politics altogether by banning unions in universities, there are stirrings of resentment.

Since November 3, there have been small protests in several campuses across the country. Even more strange, they started not in one of the rough-and-tumble
universities but at the elite Lahore University of Management Studies (LUMS), where students are said to be more bothered about the kind of salaries they
will get when they graduate than with what is going in the country.

At LUMS, often described as the Harvard of Pakistan, the state of emergency has been a crash course in real life political science for the girls and boys,
usually from privileged families, who study there.

&quot;Our faculty have always told us that we are studying theories, it's the application that counts. We study about human rights and the Constitution and law,
and now we are seeing how everything has been suspended,&quot; said one student. With the LUMS authorities wary of the media, the student said he did not want
to give his name.

Protesters at LUMS have held hunger strikes and rallies within the neatly laid-out red-brick campus. They have also started a blog called pakistanmartiallaw.blogspot.com,
which keeps students updated on emergency-related news from all parts of the country and about protests at other universities. A daily printout of the
blog, called Emergency Times, is hot property on the LUMS campus. &quot;Please photocopy and distribute&quot; is its tag-line.

&quot;Being part of an elite institution does not mean that we close our eyes to what's happening around us and move on from here to our high-paying jobs. It
is high time that we looked to the collective benefit of our country, beyond our narrow self-interests,&quot; said one of the students on hunger strike.

Rasul Baksh Rais, who teaches political science at LUMS, said the student protest dispelled the impression that the young generation was depoliticised.
&quot;The students have been shocked by the enormity of the legal and political manoeuvring by President Musharraf to stay on in power. They are really concerned
about how their country is seen in the outside world, what kind of label it is being given. It is they who have to live and deal with that label, which
may not be very charitable. They want their country to be civilised, in the tradition of modern civilisations, tolerant, pluralistic, democratic,&quot; Rais
said.

The other strange thing is that Imran, known for his dubious choices since he threw himself into political life and who is not yet considered a serious
enough politician, is the main inspiration for the campus stirrings.

Imran, who escaped house arrest, was always a cult figure for his feats on the 22-yard-mat and for his Greek god looks. But he is now acquiring a cult status
in Lahore's educational institutions for his daring escape from house arrest and his passionate appeals from his hiding place to the country's youth to
rise up against the General.

He was, coincidentally, on the LUMS campus to speak at a seminar the day the state of emergency was declared. The news of Musharraf's decision came as the
seminar was getting under way. Imran used the opportunity to send out a message to all students in Pakistan that they had to play ball. At LUMS, many students
said Imran was the politician they admired the most. At Punjab University, Madeeha Sayed, the clinical psychology student, said the students needed a leader.

&quot;Imran Khan,&quot; she replied, unhesitatingly, when asked who that leader could be. &quot;He's our hero.&quot;

Imran's dramatic capture at Punjab University on that day by students affiliated to the Islami-Jamiat-e-Taliba (IJT) - the youth wing of the Jamat-e-Islami,
an apparent political ally of his - who then handed him over to the police massed at the gates, has only added to his stature among students.

Imran had announced he would emerge from hiding to lead a rally on the campus. But the IJT, which has a stranglehold on the university, declared it would
not allow him to set foot inside Punjab University as there was no place for politicians in student life.

The IJT is not affected by the ban on students' unions. Successive regimes have treated it as a religious organisation and used it to keep the lid on campus
politics.

Jamat-i-Islami leader Qazi Hussain Ahmed and Imran are political partners. The IJT, however, seemed to be defying its parent organisation in order to protect
its own turf. While non-IJT students waited for Imran to show up, the IJT took out its own rally on the campus against the emergency, shouting slogans
against Musharraf and the United States. As it wound its way through the leafy campus, the former cricketer suddenly showed up, evading a posse of policemen
around the campus. His supporters among the students ran to pick him up on their shoulders, but it was all too brief.

The activists of the IJT, who were more numerous and better organised, took him inside a building and locked him up there before handing him over to the
police. Imran's capture led to two days of protests on the Punjab University campus by students opposed to the IJT.

For the first time, students who are opposed to the IJT but who have no other leadership felt emboldened to take on an organisation that has links within
the establishment and is so powerful that it even decides appointments in the university administration. The IJT has aggressively pushed an Islamist agenda
on the campus: it opposes music and intermingling of girls and boys, has laid down a dress code for women students, and is pushing for the hijab.

The awakening among students is not confined to universities. The demands for &quot;constitutionalism and the rule of law&quot; among Pakistan's professional classes
have caught the imagination of their school-going children as well. In Islamabad, a group of schoolboys and girls showed up at a busy intersection wearing
black tape on their mouths to symbolise the gag orders on television channels.

Taken by surprise, the police baton-charged them. Another time, schoolchildren decided to walk in a procession to dismissed Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary's
house, carrying flowers for him, to express their solidarity with him and the other judges who did not take the oath under the Provisional Constitution
Order (PCO). The police stopped them midway, promising to deliver the flowers to Chaudhary.

&quot;I am here to show my support for the judiciary of Pakistan. They have all been arrested just because they were going to give a judgment against General
Musharraf. Everybody knows that he imposed the emergency only because of that, to save his own position,&quot; said Murad, an O-level student in a posh school
in the capital. All of 14 years and dressed in his school uniform, clutching a rose that he wanted to give to Chaudhary, Murad wanted Musharraf to resign
&quot;immediately&quot;. He compressed all his civics lessons into one line: &quot;Anything that goes against the Constitution offends us. Musharraf has violated the
Constitution.&quot;

Coups and courts

V. VENKATESAN

The Pakistan Supreme Court's judgments on usurper regimes in the past have led to constitutional debates across the world.

AAMIR QURESHI/AFP

Pakistan Policemen outside the Supreme Court building in Islamabad on November 4, a day after Musharraf declared a state of emergency.

In the evolution of constitutional doctrines, the contribution of Pakistan's Supreme Court has been indelible, even though Pakistan, in the eyes of many,
is a failed state with its experiments in democracy proving always unsuccessful. Although it would seem India has much to offer to Pakistan in terms of
durability of the state and its institutions, the Supreme Court of India has at times acknowledged the contribution of the Pakistan Supreme Court to the
evolution of Indian constitutional jurisprudence.

The Indian Supreme Court's judgment in the Bommai case (1994) is an instance when it acknowledged the Pakistan Supreme Court's judgment while interpreting
the emergency powers of the President. In Federation of Pakistan v. Mohd. Saifullah Khan (1989), the Pakistan court held that the discretion conferred
on the President by the Constitution cannot be regarded to be an absolute one but is to be deemed to be a qualified one in the sense that it is circumscribed
by the object of the law that confers it. Although the Pakistan Supreme Court held so in a case where the President's power to dismiss a federal government
and the National Assembly was challenged, the Indian Supreme Court considered the relevance of the court's approach as significant in the context of the
President's power to dismiss State governments and dissolve Assemblies in India.

Today, in law schools across the world, the study of jurisprudence is deemed incomplete without a discussion of Hans Kelsen's Grundnorm,or the basic norm,
thesis. The Pakistan Supreme Court is credited with the first invocation of this thesis to uphold the validity of a coup headed by Iskandar Mirza, who
was President of Pakistan under its first Constitution (1956). Since then, the theory has been applied in similar situations in other countries. In his
main work, General Theory of Law and State (1946), Kelsen advances his case for a Grundnorm from which the entire legal system derives its validity. He
argued that a successful coup d'etat or revolution could create a new basic norm and, therefore, could be the supporting plank for a &quot;new legal order&quot;.
Once the revolution was shown to be efficacious in nullifying the old basic norm, it had to be regarded as a law-creating fact giving validity to a &quot;new
legal order&quot;.

The Pakistan Supreme Court's use of Kelsen's thesis in October 1958 in the cause celebre, State v. Dosso, has led to constitutional debates across the world
on the legitimacy of coups. The court, presided over by Chief Justice Muhammad Munir, held that there had been a successful revolution by Mirza and, applying
Kelsen, declared that the document issued by him, Laws (Continuance in Force) Order (LCFO), was the law.

This order purported to avert the drastic consequences of an abrogated Constitution by continuing to recognise the pre-existent laws as valid unless expressly
modified by the &quot;martial law&quot; government. The case came up for hearing on the sixth day after the coup. Ironically, the day after the judgment, General
Ayub Khan removed Mirza and exiled him.

Fifteen years later, in Asma Jilani v. Government of Punjab (1972), the Pakistan Supreme Court reversed its decision in State v. Dosso. It declared as illegal
the second round of &quot;martial law&quot; rule, which began under General Yahya Khan, after President Ayub Khan stepped down in March 1969. Yahya Khan's rule began
after the second Constitution of Pakistan (1962) was abrogated in an atmosphere of widespread unrest against Ayub Khan who called in the army to &quot;take
over&quot; the government.

Yayha Khan was the chief of the army in March 1969. The court found that there was no basis under the Constitution for the &quot;passing over&quot; of power to the
army. According to Articles 12 and 16 of the Constitution (1962), the Speaker of the National Assembly should have taken over from the outgoing President.
Before the Supreme Court pronounced its judgment in this case, Yahya Khan resigned and Z.A. Bhutto became President under an interim Constitution. Nevertheless,
the judgment created a huge sensation and it was widely hailed by the public.

Asma Jilani, a political leader and a newspaper editor, was detained under the Martial Law Regulation issued by Yahya Khan in 1971 in his capacity as the
Chief Martial Law Administrator. The Regulation enabled the military authorities to detain a person without trial for an indefinite period. None of the
safeguards available to such detainees under the previous Constitutions (1956 and 1962) was provided. The Lahore High Court applied State v. Dosso, and
held the decree to be binding and declined to interfere. On appeal, the Supreme Court overruled State v. Dosso and declared the regime illegal. It held
that unless the application of the decree in question could be justified on the grounds of public necessity, it had no validity of its own. The court found
that there was no such necessity to justify it and held the decree and the Regulation illegal.

Examining State v. Dosso in this case, the then Chief Justice, Hamoodur Rahman, asked what difference it made in Kelsen's terms that the man responsible
for the main coup d'etat was himself replaced (Mirza). State v. Dosso's reversal suggested the futility of employing any theory or doctrine to justify
so totally unconstitutional an act as a coup d'etat. According to the Supreme Court in the Jilani case, State v. Dosso had not judged the efficacy of the
initial coup properly. Was it possible to assess that efficacy in a matter of merely six days between the coup and the hearings in State v. Dosso when
the issue was put to test? Did the subsequent coup within the coup not prove the State v. Dosso court wrong?

In the Jilani case, the Supreme Court pointed out that Kelsen postulated Grundnorm as a norm of international law that successful coups d'etat were law-creating
facts. And it was the basic norm of recognition which supported the &quot;continuity of the identity of the State and national law&quot;. &quot;An individual does not
become the Head of State through the recognition of other States but through the municipal law of his own State,&quot; the court held. What followed was the
court's formulation that the criterion of &quot;recognition&quot; of a state in international law would be different from that applicable to determine the legality
of a domestic government.

In the Jilani case, the court stated that Kelsen could not have intended to lay down that &quot;every person who was successful in grabbing power&quot; could claim
to be the source of law and sovereignty. On the contrary, he meant to say that the state was not above the law and that might did not make right. Besides,
his theory required that an effective Constitution be in existence in order to give validity to any rule made under it. Therefore, the Kelsenian concept
that the efficacy of a law would ipso facto confer legality upon it was expressly repudiated.

The court almost emasculated the doctrine of necessity in the Jilani case. The court's pronouncement that the army regime was illegal could have meant invalidation
of a considerable number of actions that took place under its authority. The doctrine of necessity, therefore, came in handy in order to avoid damage and
inconvenience on so large a scale. This doctrine gave to de facto actions the same status as de jure ones. But the court limited the doctrine's application.

Pakistan's military rulers: (From top) Field Marshal Ayub Khan, General Yahya Khan, General Ziaul Haq and General Pervez Musharraf.

The 1973 Constitution elevated the status of the Prime Minister while reducing the status of the President and incorporated provisions presumed to deter
the army from interfering in politics. The army under General Mohammed Ziaul Haq took power on July 5, 1977. When Z.A. Bhutto and 10 other Pakistan People's
Party (PPP) leaders were re-imprisoned by Zia in September 1977 and threatened with trial before military tribunals, his wife filed a petition in the Supreme
Court challenging the validity and legality of the martial law regime and alleging that the purpose of the arrests was to prevent Bhutto's participation
in the elections (Begum Nusrat Bhutto v. Chief of Army Staff and Federation of Pakistan, 1977). On the fourth day of court hearings in this case, Zia promulgated
new curbs on political activities and postponed the national elections indefinitely. The Supreme Court's decision in this case supported the martial law
government on the basis of the necessity doctrine.

Newly appointed Chief Justice Anwar ul Haq issued an opinion giving the military government free rein to hold power and offering Zia warrant to retain that
power. The court agreed with the military that election corruption and political disruptions after the 1977 elections had so compromised the PPP government
that it could no longer represent the electorate. The Chief Justice anticipated unknown and immeasurable political disruption, seen through the eyes of
its instigators, to defend the army's right to usurp power.

The court took the government at its word that elections would soon be scheduled and imposed weak conditions on Zia's confirmation. Zia promised elections
in 90 days, but continued to rule for nine years without elections. The Chief Justice discarded the revolutionary legality argument of Dosso's case because
the Constitution was not formally abrogated and &quot;the breach of legal continuity was of a purely temporary nature and for a specified limited purpose&quot;.
The court declared military intervention to be necessary and validated all actions pursuant to military takeover.

On October 12, 1999, General Pervez Musharraf, Chief of the Army Staff, took over power and dismissed the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The
takeover was challenged directly in the Supreme Court of Pakistan under Article 184(3) of the Constitution (Syed Zafar Ali Shah v. Gen. Pervez Musharraf).
In this case, the Bench comprising 12 judges gave a unanimous judgment holding that the Nawaz Sharif government was an oligarchy and there was no democracy
prevailing in the country.

The court observed that the machinery of the government both at the Centre and in the Provinces had broken down completely and the Constitution had been
rendered unworkable. A situation had arisen for which the Constitution provided no solution, and therefore, the armed forces had to intervene to save the
state from further chaos, for maintenance of peace and order, for economic stability, and for justice and good governance.

The court disagreed with the view that the doctrine of necessity was no longer valid. In view of the peculiar circumstances, the court granted reasonable
time to enable the Chief Executive to hold new general elections.

As the political events in Pakistan take another tumultuous turn, we can expect the repacked Supreme Court of Pakistan to put another gloss on the doctrine
of necessity to validate the current rule of Musharraf. Time alone will tell whether the Pakistan Supreme Court can rediscover the spirit of its decision
in the Jilani case, and effectively invalidate a usurper regime while it is in office. .

Our dictator, their democracy

VIJAY PRASHAD

Washington has no option but to stay with the military and provide it with civilian cover.

SUSAN WALSH/AP

At Capitol Hill, Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte testifies at the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on democracy and terrorism in Pakistan,
on November 7

Chaos spawns rumours. Word travelled like wildfire across Pakistan in the early days of emergency that General Ashfaq Kiyani had taken General Pervez Musharraf
into custody and assumed power. And that the loyalist General, who was chosen as his successor, replaced Musharraf who had lost his way in political intrigue.
The rumour was not so misplaced. Similar stories travelled around Washington, D.C., from the State Department to journalists to embassies.

Washington's gambit, to allow Musharraf to remain in power with the civilian fig leaf of Benazir Bhutto, has unravelled. With few other choices, both the
White House and the State Department have turned, it is said, not to the civil society protesting in favour of democracy, but to the barracks, where the
most measured man is Kiyani. He appeals to Washington: a chain smoker who is also the president of the Pakistan Golf Association, Kiyani is the type of
&quot;chap like us&quot; favoured by the brass in Washington and on its embassy row.

President George W. Bush hastened to send one of his trusted people off to Islamabad to confer with his loyal ally, Musharraf. The man chosen for this mission
is an old Washington hand, Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte. For this task of being Washington's liaison with the Pakistani military brass, Negroponte
is very credible. As the U.S. Ambassador to Honduras in the early 1980s, Negroponte not only ensured the full support of the Reagan administration for
the Honduran military dictatorship but also shepherded the ruthless strategy pursued by the anti-Communist Contras from their Honduran bases into neighbouring
Nicaragua.

Negroponte's man in Tegucigalpa was General Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, who famously said that &quot;extralegal&quot; means were needed to take care of any dissidents
in his country and that he needed to pursue the &quot;Argentine method&quot; of torture to maintain control of the country.

Negroponte went from that assignment to Mexico City, where, as Ambassador, he pushed the Mexican government to take a more forceful approach against the
Zapatistas. Negroponte's current task is to mollify the brass, to show them that they remain key to U.S. strategy.

The Pakistani military is crucial to the &quot;war on terror&quot; if not in actual fact (Al Qaeda operatives remain at large) then certainly in a symbolic way. This
is particularly so for the U.S. elections of 2008, when the viability of a Republican candidacy will rise and fall on the merits of this &quot;war&quot;, in which
Pakistan's performance will be up for national review. Negroponte's mission is, therefore, weighty.

But this is not Negroponte's first trip to Islamabad during this crisis. He was there in June to counsel Musharraf about the standoff between the General
and the Supreme Court. At the close of that visit, one of the leading opposition figures (currently in jail), Aitzaz Ahsan, told the press, &quot;The Americans
have got their eggs in one basket and know only one phone number in Pakistan, and that is now a dud number because it does not communicate with any Pakistani
citizens.&quot;

Ahsan, who was an Interior Minister in Benazir Bhutto's Cabinet in the 1990s, pointed to the White House's reliance upon the military headquarters in Rawalpindi
for its information and its allegiance. But by then Washington was also on the phone with Benazir Bhutto, who was eager to return from exile in exchange
for amnesty from corruption charges.

The situation put the U.S. rhetoric into a spin. Its main ally Musharraf had come to power in 1999 to replace &quot;sham democracy&quot; with &quot;true democracy&quot;, and
now the U.S. wanted to broker a deal by which he would remain in power (preferably in a suit rather than in fatigues) and Benazir Bhutto would become his
Prime Minister and give the entire sham a democratic facade (hence the importance to Washington of the elections in January).

On a popular television talk show, Negroponte's boss, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, said that what was important was that &quot;elections are going to
be held and held very soon, and also that the President said he was going to take off his uniform. These have both been essential to getting Pakistan back
on a democratic path. Obviously, we are also encouraging that the state of emergency has got to be lifted and lifted as soon as possible.&quot;

When pushed on this point about the General now morphing into the President, Rice demurred, &quot;This is not a perfect situation. Pakistan is a country that
has come a long way from 1999 and the military coup. It has come a long way from 2001, when it pledged to try and root out extremism. But it is not a perfect
situation, and nobody would suggest that it is.&quot;

One of the intellectual scouts who is tasked with finding a way out of this imperfect situation is Daniel Markey, currently a Senior Fellow for South Asia
at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former senior planner at the U.S. State Department in the Bush administration. Markey's essay on Pakistan in
the summer issue of the Council's flagship journal Foreign Affairs (&quot;A False Choice for Pakistan&quot;, July/August 2007) suggested that the U.S. must closely
engage the Pakistani military.

The brass is Washington's closest ally, particularly if the Generals make their strategic shift from affiliating with political Islam towards a closer interconnection
with the Pentagon. Washington, Markey wrote, &quot;must win the trust and confidence of Pakistan's army&quot;. A month later, as events delegitimised army rule,
Markey returned to the journal for an update (&quot;The Summer of Pakistan's Discontent&quot;, September 2007), to urge Washington to applaud the Pakistani military's
moves against the Lal Masjid and in the border regions.

The Benazir Bhutto-Musharraf alliance provided Washington a glimmer of hope out of the darkness, which in this case mainly referred to the confrontation
with the judiciary (both Musharraf and Benazir Bhutto were happy to see the courts tethered, the former to remain in power, the latter to see that the
corruption charges remain squashed).

&quot;Given the paucity of other viable options,&quot; Markey wrote, &quot;Washington should support such a power-sharing agreement in order to facilitate freer and fairer
elections this fall. The United States should also continue to deliver robust military and diplomatic support to the Pakistani army.&quot;

Washington's concern

Washington's concern is mainly on the Pakistani-Afghan frontier, on the rise of political Islam within the country and on the concomitant problem of nuclear
weapons in the hands of anti-U.S. Islamic groups. The White House is mute when it comes to the democracy being demanded by lawyers, journalists, human
rights activists and students.

Their struggles provoke a consideration about chaos rather than hope for the creation of a new political dispensation. They evoke fears of Iran, even as
this is misplaced (there are no religious leaders in Pakistan with the stature of Ayatollah Khomeini, according to Pakistani journalist Beena Sarwar).

In an interview, Markey warned the liberals against moving too swiftly away from Musharraf and Benazir Bhutto. &quot;It was this kind of coalition [between the
liberals and the radical Islamists] in Iran that led to the overthrow of the Shah, and the subsequent purging of the liberals, leaving the radical Islamists
in power.&quot;

Washington, Markey said, is not wedded to either the military or Benazir Bhutto on idealist grounds but simply because &quot;there are not a lot of great options&quot;.
&quot;If there were an opposition leader in Pakistan, or a set of institutions in Pakistan that provided a ready, easy alternative to Musharraf, then I think
Washington would have moved in that direction some time ago.&quot; But short of that, Washington has to stay with the military and provide it with civilian
cover..

Changing tune

JOHN CHERIAN

India is careful not to be perceived as interfering in the internal affairs of Pakistan.

NARINDER NANU/AFP

Pakistani trucks filled with dry fruit cross the border at Wagah on October 3, for the first time since 1947, as part of measures to boost India-Pakistan
trade. Previously, goods were transported to the border post by porters and collected by trucks on the other side.

THE reaction to General Pervez Musharraf's &quot;self-coup&quot; has been generally muted in Western capitals. India's reaction has been similar to the West. The
Ministry of External Affairs' (MEA) official statement only expressed &quot;regret&quot; about the imposition of &quot;emergency rule&quot; in Pakistan. &quot;We regret the difficult
times that Pakistan is passing through. We trust that conditions of normalcy will soon return permitting Pakistan's transition to stability and democracy
to continue.&quot;

Pakistani civil right activists and media personalities have said that they would have preferred New Delhi to take a tougher stand. But the Indian government
seems to prefer a cautious approach and is careful not to be perceived as interfering in Pakistan's internal affairs. It is also of the view that for the
foreseeable future the Pakistan Army will remain the main player in the country's politics. A senior Indian official said that Washington would create
another &quot;democratic facade&quot; for the military to continue its rule in Pakistan. Washington has shown a preference for authoritarian rulers despite all the
talk of democracy. At the same time, intelligence communities, in the United States and India, seem to believe that the Pakistan Army has become more radicalised
since Musharraf staged his coup in 1999. The U.S. backed the coup because Musharraf was perceived as a &quot;moderniser&quot; who could stem the growth of Islamic
radicalism in the army. From the U.S. perspective, things have now gone from bad to worse in the Pakistan Army. There are regular reports of army units
surrendering to the Taliban without a fight in the tribal areas. Graham Fuller, the former Vice-Chairman of the National Intelligence Council of the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA), has described the current crisis as a manifestation of &quot;anti-American Islamic nationalism&quot;.

Indian officials claim that New Delhi has traditionally done business with whoever is in power in Islamabad. However, India was vociferous in its criticism
of the government in Pakistan after Musharraf seized power in 1999. At that time, New Delhi raised its voice in all major international fora against the
trampling of democracy. Now, both New Delhi and Islamabad are with the U.S. in the &quot;war on terror&quot;. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State for Defence John Negroponte
told Congress, before his recent trouble-shooting trip to Islamabad, that there &quot;was not a mission in the world more deserving of our persistence and considered
patience&quot; than Pakistan.

The military has been in overt control of Pakistan for most of the time since the country became independence. Washington has been blindly supporting military
dictatorship in Pakistan for most of the last 53 years. New Delhi is aware that Washington continues to consider Musharraf as the bulwark against Islamist
militancy in the region after the events of September 11, 2001. Since the nuclear deal between India and the U.S. was put on the table, New Delhi has generally
kowtowed to Washington's priorities in the region, whether it is Pakistan, Iran or Afghanistan.

Trade ties

Indeed, bilateral relations have never been better since the 1980s. Trade between the two countries has increased significantly. Since 2004, India and Pakistan
have been involved in substantive talks. Incidents of cross-border terrorist activities have come down substantially. In the last couple of years, Musharraf
has made many proposals to resolve the contentious issue of Kashmir. But once it became obvious that the General's powers and charisma were waning, the
Indian establishment began stonewalling Islamabad's initiative.

A favourable deal on Siachen was there for the taking. The attitude in the MEA from the beginning of the year was that more concessions could be extracted
from a politically weakened Musharraf.

The impending election of a new Commonwealth Secretary-General could be another reason for India's muted reaction. Islamabad was reportedly veering towards
supporting Kamalesh Sharma, India's candidate for the post. Now, however, India may not have to worry about Pakistan's vote.

The nine-member Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) has issued a warning that the country would be suspended from &quot;the councils of the Commonwealth&quot;
before the Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) summit scheduled to be held in Kampala on November 22. India is not part of the CMAG.

Many of the CMAG members had asked for full suspension of Pakistan, as was done in the case of Zimbabwe in 2003. Britain was mainly responsible for the
tough line against Zimbabwe. Now it is in the forefront of stalling moves for Pakistan's immediate suspension from the Commonwealth.

The CMAG has given Pakistan a deadline of November 22 to restore democracy. It has sought, among other things, the repeal of emergency provisions and full
restoration of the Constitution, including the independence of the judiciary. The CMAG has also demanded that Musharraf should step down as army chief
before November 22.

Terror apprehensions

India's National Security Adviser, M.K. Narayanan, told the media recently that there was a danger of increased infiltration of terrorist groups from Pakistan
if the political crisis continued. He also talked about the possibility of terrorist &quot;sleeper cells&quot; being activated in India. New Delhi has been accusing
Islamabad of complicity in the terrorist attacks that have rocked India this year. No clinching evidence has, however, been provided by the Indian authorities.
The Pakistan Army is now engaged in counter-insurgency activities of its own as it tries to stop the spread of the Taliban in the tribal areas bordering
Afghanistan.

Indian Foreign Secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said that India was concerned about the instability on its periphery but emphasised that it was for Pakistanis
to decide about their rulers.

New Delhi has left it to Washington to articulate the fears relating to Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. Musharraf has rejected the Bush administration's demands
that it be made privy to the location of the country's nuclear weapons. The Pakistan President insists that under no circumstances will he compromise with
Pakistan's sovereignty on this issue. Musharraf, even though he finds his back against the wall, has in recent times taken decisions that cannot have pleased
Washington. Pakistan went ahead and signed the gas pipeline agreement with Iran in early November. Last year, Islamabad, unlike New Delhi, refused to vote
against Iran in the International Atomic Energy Agency. Musharraf has strengthened ties with countries such as Russia.

Islamabad has taken more interest in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) than New Delhi in recent years. The Saudi Royal House has been deeply committed
to the Pakistan Army for a variety of reasons. It is unlikely to ditch Musharraf in a hurry. China remains an &quot;all-weather friend&quot; of Pakistan but has
remained circumspect on the internal politics of the country. New Delhi is no doubt aware that Musharraf has still many cards left to play.

The Left parties in India have been particularly critical of the imposition of emergency rule in Pakistan. The general secretary of the Communist Party
of India (Marxist), Prakash Karat, said that the events in Pakistan exemplified the dangers of getting embedded with the U.S. The Pakistani elite in the
1950s was elated when the country became part of the South East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) and the Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO), the military
alliances led by the U.S. By the 1980s, the Pakistan Army had virtually become a mercenary army, fighting America's war in Afghanistan. India's foreign
policy, on the other hand, was until the 1990s aimed at minimising the domination of neocolonial powers..

KARNATAKA'S 19th Chief Minister and the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) first in South India, 64-year-old B.S. Yeddyurappa, took his oath of office on November
12 on the steps of the Vidhana Soudha before a huge crowd of supporters and a phalanx of central leaders of the BJP who had come to Bangalore to witness
a moment of history for the party. The Chief Minister took his oath in the name of God and the farmers of the State. Four of his colleagues were sworn
in with him.

This was a special occasion for the saffron party, which has had it sights set on Karnataka ever since it became an electoral and political force in 1991.
Karnataka has been seen as a springboard for its expansion in the South. It ferried busloads of people from all over the State, particularly from Shimoga,
the Chief Minister's home district, to watch the event. The formal assumption of office by the BJP Chief Minister was thus a long-awaited moment, even
if the party's public image has been tarnished by the display of the naked opportunism of its leaders in the past few weeks.

If the swearing-in ceremony was an important event for the party, it was a red-letter day for Yeddyurappa, who has pursued the top gaddi quite openly and
unabashedly, seeking intervention and help from sources both divine and secular. The throne was almost his on October 3, when the Janata Dal (Secular)
Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy was to step down and make way for Yeddyurappa according to the terms of a power-transfer agreement worked out between the
coalition partners in February 2006.

Once President's Rule was imposed in the State on October 9, the vision of the gaddi faded away only to resurface briefly a day later when, on hearing of
a possible rapprochement with the JD(S), Yeddyurappa rushed to Bangalore from Tumkur where he had just inaugurated an anti-JD(S) &quot;Dharma Yatra&quot;. When,
on the night of October 26, Yeddyurappa was woken up by a late-night call from his arch-rival, Kumaraswamy, who asked for the hand of the BJP in a new
coalition, he was more than happy to extend it.

The BJP met Governor Rameshwar Thakur on October 27 and submitted a letter staking its claim to form the government with the support of the 39-member JD(S)
group. They sought revocation of President's Rule under which the Assembly had been kept in suspended animation. Once he was sure that the proposed coalition
would have the numbers, the Governor formally invited Yeddyurappa on November 9 to form the government.

Although Yeddyurappa has been exuding confidence that a BJP-led coalition will not only take office but complete its 19-month tenure, the ground is anything
but firm under his feet. On coming to power, the five-member BJP Ministry announced a series of decisions that irked its coalition partner. The JD(S) was
quick to announce that it would only join the new Ministry after the floor test was conducted on November 19 and that the new government could not take
any major decisions before that.

Populist decisions

In the first Cabinet meeting of the new government, Yeddyurappa took several populist decisions - to distribute 4.35 lakh cycles to Standard VIII students,
to issue 12.71 lakh ration cards before December 15, and so on. The Chief Minister reappointed as Advocate General Uday Holla, who had resigned from the
post when President's Rule was imposed. M. Shankar Bidri, Additional Director General of Police, Law and Order, was appointed Additional DGP (Intelligence).

V.P. Baligar, a senior civil servant, was appointed Principal Secretary and Siddaiah the Chief Minister's Secretary. The appointments drew criticism from
Yeddyurappa's political opponents, who accused him of displaying a casteist bias for his Lingayat community. No less criticised, and splashed all over
the media, was Yeddyurappa's entry into office with an elaborate &quot;Vedic&quot; ritual conducted by Brahmin priests in his official chamber in the Secretariat
building.

The JD(S) leadership watched with alarm the actions and statements of a government that had not even proven its majority in the Assembly. A section of the
JD(S) leadership floated the idea of giving outside support to the BJP Ministry, instead of joining it, as a way of distancing itself from the BJP's &quot;communal
agenda&quot;. If the BJP veered off course, the JD(S) could always withdraw support with justification, argued the proponents of this view.

However, the idea found few takers among JD(S) legislators, most of whom said they would have rather opted for fresh elections than give the BJP government
outside support. The JD(S) then once again brought to the table the &quot;conditions&quot; that its national president, H.D. Deve Gowda, had drawn up as a sort of
&quot;memorandum of understanding&quot; between the two parties.

In order to rein in the new government and prevent it from taking unilateral decisions before the JD(S) formally joined the Ministry, the party wrote to
the BJP asking for a formal, written understanding based on the original 12 conditions minus one (that the party's support to the BJP would cease if Lok
Sabha elections were announced). The letter specified that Kumaraswamy must be made chairman of the coordinating committee and that the new government
should not take decisions before the full complement of the Ministry was sworn in. The JD(S) sought the portfolios of Urban Development (including Bangalore
City Development, which is usually held by the Chief Minister), and Mining (in exchange for Excise). The JD(S) will have 18 Ministers and the BJP 16 in
the 34-member Cabinet.

Yeddyurappa quickly acquiesced to the demands, stating that his government would refrain from taking any decisions or making any major announcements. He
told reporters that he would spend his time &quot;visiting temples and mutts in the State&quot; until the November 19 floor test. He sought four days' time to discuss
the list of conditions with the central leadership of his party. In response, the JD(S) said it would be agreeable to a joint swearing-in ceremony once
the government proved its majority in the Assembly.

Although the differences between the parties appear to have been ironed out, there are several imponderables in the present situation. Deve Gowda, who deliberately
kept himself out of the action during the stitching together of the new alliance, is known to be averse to it and is looking for a handle that he can use
to break it. If Yeddyurappa does not commit himself to the 11-point written understanding, the JD(S) could use that to deny the BJP support during the
floor test.

The second issue that could dissolve the present government is a pending disqualification motion against the JD(S) bloc. The Speaker of the Legislative
Assembly, Krishna, was scheduled to hear on November 17 two petitions seeking the disqualification of 37 MLAs, including Kumaraswamy, under the anti-defection
law. He adjourned the hearing to November 24. However, if the Speaker, who was elected on the JD(S) ticket, chooses to disqualify the group, the Ministry
will collapse. Thus, it may well be Deve Gowda who decides the future of Karnataka's new BJP-led government..

Law and disorder

VENKITESH RAMAKRISHNAN

The Chief Ministers of Bihar and U.P. are forced to act against colleagues to prove their commitment to tackle criminals in politics.

RANJEET KUMAR

Nitish Kumar, Chief Minister of Bihar.

ONE of the major factors that propelled the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance in Bihar and the Mayawati-led Bahujan
Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh to power was the public's dissatisfaction with the law and order situation.

The popular feeling was that the governments in both the States at the time of the Assembly elections - the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party (S.P.)
Ministry in U.P. and the Rabri Devi-led Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) Ministry in Bihar - had failed to control crime and provide safety and security to ordinary
citizens.

The involvement of several leaders of the S.P. and the RJD - such as Amarmani Tripathi, a Minister in U.P., and Mohammed Shahabuddin, a member of the Lok
Sabha from Bihar - in incidents of crime created the impression that criminals had government patronage. The JD(U)-BJP alliance and the BSP played on this
sentiment in their political campaigns. When they came to power, Mayawati and Nitish Kumar vowed to change this negative state of affairs and initiated
administrative-legislative measures towards this.

RAJEEV BHATT

Mayawati, Chief Minister of U.P.

However, recent developments in U.P. and Bihar have put the two Chief Ministers and their governments at the receiving end of a hostile public debate. Central
to the debate is the involvement of BSP and JD(U) leaders in grave criminal cases, which have attracted considerable media and popular attention. Moreover,
there is a growing perception that the governments are not able to ensure the safety and security of ordinary citizens. In U.P., one of the most widely
debated issues now relates to the kidnapping charges against Anand Sen Yadav, a Minister of State in the Mayawati government. In Bihar, the assault on
mediapersons by JD(U) legislator Anant Singh when he was queried about the criminal cases against him forms the core point of the anti-government discourse.

The debate on the cases against Anand Sen Yadav and Anant Singh had an emotive appeal on account of a number of factors. Sexual exploitation and the probable
physical elimination of the victim had come up as part of the public discourse in the Anand Sen Yadav case. The principal allegation against Anand Sen
Yadav is that he was instrumental in kidnapping a Dalit girl named Sashi, who belonged to his home district of Faizabad. The allegation was first raised
by the girl's father, Yogendra Prasad. The girl has been missing from home since October 22, and her father suspected the involvement of the Minister,
who was once close to his family. Prasad complained that he had tried to get a first information report (FIR) registered with regard to the disappearance
of his daughter, but there was no action from the police machinery, ostensibly on account of the influence of Anand Sen Yadav. Later, Prasad's complaint
was taken up by Opposition leaders, including former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, who alleged that Anand Sen had physical relations with the girl
and got her pregnant. The S.P. leadership argued that Sashi's disappearance was essentially linked to her relationship with Anand Sen Yadav. In popular
perception, the case had great similarity with the Amarmani Tripathi-Madhumita case during S.P. rule. Madhumita was killed to cover up an unwanted pregnancy.
Both Amarmani Tripathi and his wife were convicted in that case. The allegations against Anand Sen Yadav gave the S.P. an opportunity to hit back.

The case had its echo in the State Assembly and Mayawati was compelled to seek, on November 6, Anand Sen Yadav's resignation and initiate an investigation
by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the allegations against him. The fact that there were several other cases against Anand Sen Yadav added
to the Chief Minister's discomfiture. Incidentally, Anand Sen Yadav was in jail on May 13, the day the Mayawati government was sworn in, in connection
with an assault case. He was sworn in later at a separate function.

PTI

Janata Dal (United) MLA Anant Singh after he was arrested in Patna.

Anant Singh, the Bihar legislator, and his supporters attacked journalists on two occasions on November 1. First, two journalists - NDTV correspondent Prakash
Singh and cameraman Habib Ali - were assaulted when they went to seek some clarifications from the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). Later, a whole
group of mediapersons were attacked when they went to Anant Singh's house to protest against the earlier assault. The legislator has over two dozen criminal
cases against him, including cases of murder, kidnapping, extortion and dacoity. Recently, there were allegations about his involvement in the rape of
a young woman, and the television crew had gone to seek his reaction to these. This girl has gone missing since the allegations were raised against Anant
Singh.

The assault on the mediapersons brought the sexual exploitation aspect of the charges against Anant Singh to the fore and this contributed to the intense
popular reaction. The MLA was considered to be close to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar by sections of the political class in Bihar. The Opposition RJD, led
by Union Railway Minister Lalu Prasad and former Chief Minister Rabri Devi, highlighted this aspect in their reactions. They demanded that the Minister
and his henchmen be arrested immediately. Nitish Kumar succumbed to the demand without much resistance and had the MLA and his henchmen arrested.

Ironically, the antagonistic public debate erupted when the two Chief Ministers were making proclamations about grand plans to counter criminal influence
in society. Hardly a week before Mayawati removed Anand Sen Yadav from her Ministry, she had unravelled a new piece of legislation to control organised
crime syndicates in the State. The Uttar Pradesh Control of Organised Crime Bill was presented as a comprehensive piece of legislation to act against land
mafia, contract killers, extortionists, kidnappers, hawala traders, money launderers, producers of spurious drugs and illicit liquor, and drug peddlers.
Those displaying firearms at public places would also be booked under the law.

SUBIR ROY

Bhavan in Lucknow. A file picture.

The Bill envisages stringent punishment, including death sentence and life imprisonment as well as fines in the range of Rs.10 lakh. It also has a provision
denying police security to those booked under criminal cases, which would affect Ministers and legislators such as Anand Sen Yadav. The Bill was passed
by the Lower House of the State legislature and is pending clearance from the Legislative Council, the Upper House.

Similarly, the Bihar Home Department and the police machinery have drawn up specific plans to move against politicians with criminal charges against them.
The plan is to be pushed ahead on the eve of the second anniversary of the Nitish Kumar government. According to a senior State government official, the
conviction of the RJD's &quot;Bahubali&quot; (muscleman) MP Mohammad Shahabuddin in the case relating to the abduction of a Communist Party of India (Marxist- Leninist)
activist was perceived as a major breakthrough, and this motivated the Home Department to draw up a list of politicians with criminal cases against them.
Those identified in the list apparently included 21 top politicians. The government also plans to set up special courts to conduct speedy trials in cases
involving high-profile people, including politicians.

It remains to be seen how far the Anant Singh case will influence the government move in this direction. One stream of opinion within the Bihar government,
especially the bureaucracy, is that the Chief Minister would impart greater speed to this initiative, especially because he would want to wash off the
negative publicity generated by the Anant Singh episode. But, at the political level, there is the view, especially among the RJD leadership, that all
these initiatives are eyewash. According to them, the Anant Singh episode has shown that ruling party leaders can take the law into their own hands. Speaking
to Frontline, RJD leader Ram Kripal Yadav said that the Anant Singh episode was preceded by incidents such as the one at Vaishali where 10 suspected thieves
were lynched by a crowd. &quot;All these point towards a sense of lawlessness,&quot; he said. Sections of the government, particularly officials considered close
to the Chief Minister, state that this misconception would be cleared by the last week of November or latest by early December when the government moves
forcefully against politicians with criminal records.

While officials in Bihar talk about imminent action to counter the negative publicity on the law and order front, no such promise is being held out in Uttar
Pradesh. The BSP leadership seems to be under the firm belief that it can overcome all the negative publicity on the strength of its political backing
at the grass roots - from the Dalit and Brahmin communities. In the meantime, the fact remains that the clout of criminals and criminal politicians is
still a major factor of life in both States.

According to the Lucknow-based political analyst Indra Bhushan Singh, this is a problem that cannot be wished away, especially on account of the dependence
of even mainstream political parties on money and muscle power. Until the political leadership of all parties decide to give up the pursuit of power using
money and muscle power, the problem will persist in one form or the other, he pointed out. .

ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS

One-horse race

DIONNE BUNSHA

Narendra Modi rides high in the absence of an effective Opposition in Gujarat.

PTI

Chief Minister Narendra Modi at the State BJP headquarters on November 15.

HOBSON'S choice. The phrase is said to have originated with Thomas Hobson, a livery stable owner at Cambridge, England, who, in order to rotate the use
of his horses, offered customers the choice of either taking the horse in the stall nearest the door or taking none at all.

In the Gujarat elections, it is not even a Hobson's choice. There seems to be only one horse. The Opposition is so fractured that it is still trying to
hobble into the stall. In a one-horse town, Narendra Modi, the &quot;Nero who fiddled while Gujarat burned&quot;, has the lead by default. In a State where there
is a political vacuum, he appears larger than life. So, despite a fractured party and a State in disarray, Modi is firmly in control a month before the
Assembly elections.

Of course, propaganda helps, too. All across the State, huge cutouts and billboards touting Modi's achievements and projecting him as the hero of Gujarat
dot the landscape. &quot;In the last six months, Modi has spent Rs.750 crore on propaganda - equivalent to the amount the government spends on social welfare
and nutrition,&quot; alleges Arjun Modhvadia, Leader of the Opposition in Gujarat.

Modi won the 2002 elections with a huge majority (126 of 182 seats) by creating communal hysteria after the Godhra tragedy. More than 1,000 people were
killed and 100,000 made homeless in the state-sponsored communal pogrom that followed. Five years later, in Modi's regime, Muslims (who comprise 9 per
cent of the population) have been totally marginalised. They are &quot;second class citizens&quot;.

In his 2002 campaign, Modi rebutted his &quot;mass murderer&quot; label by accusing his critics of maligning &quot;Gujarat's gaurav&quot; (pride). Even today, Modi continues
with his Gujarat Gaurav campaign in a new avatar - it is now a &quot;Vibrant Gujarat&quot; that he is boasting of. In the election of 2007, the Hindutva stance is
less aggressive. Communalism is not the overriding issue. Inequality in Gujarat has risen sharply. Now, Modi has to create an illusion of prosperity, even
if people are starving and farmers are killing themselves. Even death is &quot;vibrant&quot;.

&quot;Gujarat is India's number one State in all aspects of development,&quot; says Vijay Rupani, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson. &quot;We have attracted Rs.94,000
crore in investments. It's more than the combined investment in the four other States after us. We have 24-hour electricity in all 18,000 villages. The
Narmada waters have reached the drought areas of Kutch, Saurashtra and north Gujarat. Our government has worked.&quot;

However, the Congress has a barrage of statistics to refute the claims. &quot;Modi has always believed that if you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the
truth, and that is what he is trying to do again with this bogus 'Vibrant Gujarat' propaganda,&quot; says Modhvadia. &quot;Gujarat has ranked fifth in attracting
investments, which is not saying much for a State that has been the most prosperous for the last two decades. Gujarat is also the most indebted State in
India.&quot;

The BJP has alienated important sections of the electorate, including the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), its farmers' wing. Angered by the power crisis, the
BKS launched a State-wide protest against its own party. Most villages get only around six or eight hours of power in a day, compared with 14 hours a few
years ago.

The Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB) has registered cases against 156,000 farmers for electricity theft, which has led to frequent scuffles between farmers
and GEB staff. The BKS has also been highlighting cases of farmers' suicide in Saurashtra and central Gujarat. In the past two years, more than 400 farmers
have killed themselves. The number is likely to be an underestimation as the police sometimes fail to record suicides.

&quot;There are distortions in Gujarat's growth,&quot; says Indira Hirway, economist with the Centre for Development Alternatives. &quot;Poverty has declined by only 0.22
per cent a year, not in step with the 7 per cent economic growth rate. Inequality is increasing.&quot; While cities are expanding, tribal areas and water-starved
regions are lagging behind. Unemployment is rising as small-scale industries shut down and capital-intensive investments are not filling the gap. &quot;The
economic growth rate hides the widespread environmental degradation that is taking place. If the loss of environmental capital is included, the economic
growth rate would be much less,&quot; says Hirway.

State terror

Modi boasts of keeping Gujarat safe from terrorism, but who will protect people from the terror of the state? Here, there is planned lawlessness. Most of
the culprits of the communal pogrom roam the streets freely, while the victims go on living like refugees. Many of those who testified against BJP leaders
and their cadre have had criminal cases filed against them. Witnesses face constant intimidation and get no protection from the police. In fact, the Gujarat
police closed more than half of the 4,252 cases as &quot;true but undetected&quot; and deliberately concealed damning evidence. The police and the judicial machinery
are run by Sangh Parivar cadre, who are doing their best to make sure the guilty are let off the hook.

Even the Tehelka sting operation on the Gujarat pogrom has been ignored though it provides hard evidence of how top Sangh Parivar leaders, including Modi,
planned the communal massacre. The Tehelka tapes have several Sangh Parivar leaders on camera boasting about the gory killings: how they planned the pogrom
and later manipulated the judicial system to protect the culprits.

There is enough ground to arrest those captured on camera and call them in for questioning. But the police will not do it because they abetted the killings
and cannot anger their political bosses. The victims of the massacre and human rights groups have given up filing cases with the police. The only Opposition
force, the Congress, is afraid that any mention of the 2002 carnage will portray the party as &quot;anti-Hindu&quot; and increase Modi's popularity. Its leaders
dodge the issue even more than the BJP does. It is a conspiracy of silence.

Dissenting BJP Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) broke with the party over the Chief Minister's authoritarian style of functioning. Many are from
the Keshubhai Patel (former Chief Minister) faction and are from the powerful Patel community. Among them is former Home Minister Gordhan Zadaphia, who
was in charge during the pogrom. The Congress is unwilling to put him up as a candidate but gets his support from &quot;the outside&quot;. &quot;Eight sitting MLAs and
several new candidates from our faction will be contesting on the Congress ticket,&quot; says Suresh Mehta, a senior BJP leader now turned dissident. So, the
Congress may just well be the BJP's B Team, contesting an election with no clear candidate for Chief Minister.

Congress disarray

In the late 1970s, the Congress swept to power in Gujarat by forming a coalition of the underdogs. Using the &quot;KHAM formula&quot; (Kshatriya, Harijan, Adivasi
and Muslim), it mobilised support from those who previously had no political voice. Now, the party wants to distance itself from Muslims and has neglected
its Adivasi and Dalit support bases.

Yet, the Congress keeps trying to convince itself that the tide is turning against Modi though his popularity in Gujarat has remained unparalleled. &quot;In
the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress won 12 of 26 seats. The BJP won 14 seats. If these results were analysed in terms of the 182 Assembly constituencies
in Gujarat, both parties would have won 90 seats each,&quot; says Manish Tewari, All India Congress secretary, in an article in The Indian Express (October
20).

Moreover, in the 2002 State elections, the Congress lost by very narrow margins in several constituencies. In 20 constituencies, it would have won if Nationalist
Congress Party (NCP) or Samajwadi Party candidates had not stolen tiny but decisive shares of the vote (&quot;The spoiler in Gujarat&quot;, P. Sainath; Frontline,
January 31, 2003). The Congress has allied itself with the NCP this time in the hope of improving its chances in these constituencies. Until now, nothing
seems to have diminished Modi's power in the State.

Is it because there is no one to take him on? Are there no other horses that can make their way into Hobson's stable?.

Remote, not cut off

ANNIE ZAIDIE
in Kaza/Kalpa

The three remote, tribal constituencies in Himachal Pradesh are voting ahead of the rest of the State this time, contrary to tradition.

V.V. KRISHNAN

Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh after a meeting with the Election Commission in October

WHOEVER said that India's greatest achievement is in the political sphere was more than right. The country's greatest victory lies in the continuing, enthusiastic
and determined participation of the people in the democratic process. Nowhere is this truer than in the snowy heights of the Himalayas, where a greater
proportion of people turn up to vote despite the difficult terrain, bad weather and lack of transport options. High up in the cold deserts of Spiti, where
the very starkness and remoteness leads visitors into silence and awe, you can witness the fluttering fates of the major political parties in the shape
of colourful flags interwoven with the rows of Tibetan prayer flags. The stripes and &quot;hand&quot; of the Congress, the similar, blended colours of the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) with a pink lotus, and the blue elephant of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).

As some of the least accessible sections of the electorate cast their vote this week, they will decide the fate of the next Assembly in Himachal Pradesh.
The three tribal constituencies of Kinnaur, Bharmour and Lahaul-Spiti will go to the polls earlier than the rest, in a marked departure from tradition.
Until now, elections in these constituencies were held in the summer, after the snows had melted and after the rest of the State had finished voting and
the government had already been formed.

The major political parties seem to be have been caught off guard by the Election Commission's decision to conduct elections earlier in these constituencies.
They put on a brave face in their campaigns but did not bother to put together an election manifesto in time.

In fact, traditional methods of campaigning rarely work around here. Large parts of these constituencies do not get newspapers until they are two days old,
and some do not get them at all, especially in the winter. Spiti does not have any printing press, so there is no attempt at printing and distributing
propaganda material, and no pamphlets are handed out. A few posters are put up on walls, but for the most part, campaigning is a door-to-door activity.
Since the electorate is small and spread over a vast area, campaigning needs to be both intensive and extensive; links with the voters must be established
way ahead of the elections.

Frontline visited the regional offices of the Congress and the BJP, and it turned out that their manifestos were still awaiting the &quot;main&quot; election. Members
of both parties said that they did not feel there was a need for a manifesto since they would contest this election on &quot;local issues&quot;. When asked what
these issues were, a
