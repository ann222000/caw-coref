DAILY UPDATE, 09/26/07

Thanks to subscribing contributor LvS, whose $10 payment brings our running
total to $1,665! $1,335 to go.

With five days remaining in the quarter, it's time to up the premium ante.
Formerly, we were offering a $10 Laissez Faire Books gift certificate for
each $100 contribution, up to a total of 15 ... and one much-appreciated
supporter took two of those. Since I'm more interested in actually getting
the next $500 than in merely wishing for the next $1,000, I'm reducing the
number, but increasing the value, of these premiums: The next five $100
contributors (on or before September 30th) will each receive a $25 LFB gift
certificate. Let's break into $2,000+ territory today! - TLK

1)  Ahmadinejad slams &quot;arrogant&quot; powers in UN address
CNN

&quot;The nuclear issue in Iran is 'now closed,' Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad said in an address Tuesday loaded with broadsides against
'selfish and incompetent' powers that have 'obedience to Satan.' An
agreement reached last month between his country and the International
Atomic Energy Agency over its disputed nuclear program has, in the Iranian
view, settled the matter, he said.&quot; (09/25/07)

2)  NY: Anti-Bush protesters arrested near UN
Yahoo! News

&quot;About a dozen war protesters were arrested Tuesday morning during a
peaceful demonstration against President Bush's speech before the U.N.
General Assembly. They were among about 400 protesters opposing the Bush
administration's war in Iraq and its incarceration in Guantanamo Bay of more
than 300 men on suspicion of terrorism or links to al-Qaida or the Taliban.
Many in the crowd wore orange jumpsuits in solidarity with the Guantanamo
detainees. Police took the arrested demonstrators into custody ... after
they knelt on the sidewalk in an act of civil disobedience at the rally near
the United Nations. One of them, 58-year-old Bill Ofenloch, said they were
trying to serve an 'arrest warrant' on Bush for 'high crimes against
humanity.' Members of the anti-war group Code Pink performed a bit of street
theater where a person wearing a Bush mask was arrested.&quot; (09/25/07)

3)  Iraq: At least 24 killed in latest fighting
USA Today

&quot;A suicide truck bomber struck a Sunni tribal leader's house near the Syrian
border on Wednesday, killing at least five people in the latest attack by
suspected Sunni extremists on provincial officials and tribal figures. A
parked car bomb also exploded near a group of black market gasoline vendors
in a town elsewhere in northern Iraq, killing at least five people and
wounding seven, police said. Another bomb struck wounded victims as they
were being taken to the hospital. ... A series of other bombings have struck
police officers and Shiite and Sunni leaders who have joined forces with
U.S.-led forces against al-Qaeda in Iraq in recent days. On Tuesday, a
suicide car bomber attacked a police headquarters in the southern city of
Basra, killing at least three policemen, wounding 20 people. ... At least
eight people were killed and 10 wounded in scattered violence Wednesday in
Baqouba, while the bullet-riddled bodies of a Shiite man and three sons also
were found left on a street in an eastern section of the city. In other
towns northeast of Baghdad, a policeman was killed and two others injured in
Khan Bani Saad, and a civilian was killed and one wounded by random gunfire
in Khalis.&quot; (09/26/07)

&quot;Taliban militants and the U.S.-led coalition fought a daylong battle in
southern Afghanistan's poppy-growing belt Tuesday, killing more than 60
Taliban fighters and one coalition soldier, military officials said. Dozens
of insurgents attacked a joint coalition-Afghan patrol near the town of Musa
Qala in Helmand province with machine guns, mortars and rocket-propelled
grenades, the coalition said in a statement. Taliban reinforcements flowed
in from Musa Qala all day, it said.&quot; (09/25/07)

5)  Supreme Court to hear voter ID case
MSNBC

&quot;The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide whether voter identification
laws unfairly deter the poor and minorities from voting, stepping into a
contentious partisan issue in advance of the 2008 elections. The justices
will hear arguments early next year in a challenge to an Indiana law that
requires voters to present photo ID before casting their ballots. The state
has defended the law as a way to combat voter fraud.&quot; (09/25/07)

6)  GM, UAW reach tentative agreement
MarketWatch

&quot;The United Auto Workers reportedly reached a tentative contract agreement
Wednesday with General Motors Corp. that will end a two-day strike and allow
production to resume later in the day. The deal still needs to be ratified
by workers, which will begin this week, though UAW President Ron
Gettelfinger told an early morning press conference in Detroit that he's
confident the agreement will be ratified, according to news wire reports.
Around 73,000 UAW members walked out of GM plants nationwide on Monday after
a week of intense negotiations failed to produce a new labor contract.&quot;

Tuesday, with new cases confirmed in Baghdad, Basra and for the first time
three northern districts. The number of confirmed cases has now reached
2,116, WHO said. Just a day earlier a WHO official put the number of
confirmed cases at 1,652. Eleven people have died of the disease so far.&quot;

Cincinnati Enquirer

&quot;A Hamilton County Court judge ruled Tuesday that the owners of one of the
two remaining buildings on the proposed Rookwood Exchange site must repay
the developer, Rookwood Partners, $96,062 but are entitled to receive
compensation for any damages caused by the developer or Norwood. ... The
$96,062 had been withdrawn from money Rookwood Partners had set aside to buy
the property in order to pay the mortgage that Sanae Ichikawa-Burton and
Matthew Burton owed on their building on the 10-acre site at Edwards and
Edmondson roads in Norwood. ... The Burtons are one of three property owners
who successfully challenged Norwood's use of eminent domain to take their
properties in last year's landmark Ohio Supreme Court decision.&quot; (09/26/07)

9)  Swedish citizen appears on US terror charges

&quot;A Lebanese-born Swedish man arrived in the United States Tuesday to face
terrorism-related charges after being extradited by the Czech Republic, US
authorities confirmed. Oussama Kassir, 41, who had been held by the Czechs
since December 2005, was handed over Tuesday morning to US Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents in Prague to fly to New York, where he heard formal
charges later on Tuesday. ... Kassir had long been sought by US authorities
for allegedly having tried with others in 1999 to set up a camp in the
northwestern US state of Oregon to offer weapons training for Muslims
wanting to fight in Afghanistan. Stockholm refused to hand over the Swedish
national, and he was seized in Prague while making a connecting flight to
Beirut.&quot; (09/26/07)

10) Bush tightens sanctions on Burma
USA Today

&quot;The isolated Asian country that President Bush targeted for new sanctions
Tuesday could be headed for a showdown between its repressive military junta
and Buddhist monks who are leading a pro-democracy movement. At about the
same time that Bush told the United Nations General Assembly that 'Americans
are outraged by the situation in Burma,' the dictatorship there declared a
nighttime curfew and prohibited gatherings of more than five people in the
country's two largest cities for the next 60 days.&quot; (09/25/07)

14-year tenure, was found guilty of accepting nearly $9,000, a political
poll and the promise of a job from VECO Corp., an oil field services

San Francisco Chronicle

&quot;The International Association of Fire Fighters accused Republican Rudy
Giuliani of exploiting the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks because a supporter is
holding a $9.11-per-person fundraiser for the presidential candidate. The
union -- already a vocal critic of Giuliani's -- said Tuesday that the
fundraiser's '$9.11 for Rudy' theme is an abuse of the image and symbols of
the 2001 attacks. 'It is nothing short of disrespectful to the legacy of the
thousands of civilians and 343 brave firefighters who died at ground zero,'
IAFF president Harold Schaitberger said. The campaign of Democratic
presidential candidate Chris Dodd called the theme 'unconscionable,
shameless and sickening.' The firefighters' union has endorsed Dodd.&quot;

&quot;Embattled philanthropist Bob McLean was found dead this morning near a
church in Shelbyville, police confirmed. 'It has the appearance of a
suicide,' Shelbyville Police Chief Austin Swing said. The Murfreesboro
investor's brother, Tom McLean, identified the body. The former stockbroker
has been accused in civil lawsuits of fraudulently taking more than $20
million from investors. The 60-year-old philanthropist pledged millions to
MTSU, the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Schermerhorn Center, which
lists him as a donor of more than $1 million in its annual report, alongside
some of Nashville's largest donors including HCA Inc. and the Ingram
Charitable Fund.&quot; [editor's note: Apparently his &quot;philanthropy&quot; used &quot;OPM&quot;

19) NASA spacecraft set to probe two planet wannabes
Christian Science Monitor

&quot;Among all the objects in the solar system, tiny Vesta and Ceres don't
exactly turn heads. They orbit the sun in the asteroid belt, amid the solar
system's refuse. They lack rings, red spots, or other adornments. They're
just there. But what Vesta and Ceres lack in majesty they make up for in
clues to how planets form, astronomers say. Moreover, Ceres may host an
underground ocean suitable for simple forms of life. On Thursday, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration is set to launch Dawn, a
spacecraft designed to orbit Vesta, then Ceres, beginning in August 2011.
Armed with a camera and two other instruments, the craft will gather a
wealth of chemical, mineral, and other data on these two starkly contrasting
cases of planetary arrested development.&quot; (09/26/07)

20) Cosmic blast may have killed off megafauna
Boston Globe

&quot;Wooly mammoths, giant sloths, saber-toothed cats, and dozens of other
species of megafauna may have become extinct when a disintegrating comet or
asteroid exploded over North America with the force of millions of hydrogen
bombs, according to research by an international team of scientists. The
blast, which the researchers believe occurred 12,900 years ago, may have
also doomed a mysterious early human culture, known as Clovis people, while
triggering a planetwide cool-down that wiped out the plant species that
sustained many outsize Ice Age beasts, according to research published
online yesterday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Scientists have long speculated that an impact from a comet or asteroid may
have wiped out dinosaurs 65 million years ago. But the notion of an
extraterrestrial object wreaking such havoc during human times is a bit
unnerving even to researchers.&quot; (09/25/07)

&quot;Charges were dropped Monday morning against a Milwaukee pizza delivery man
accused of shooting two would-be robbers, and in a 10-page statement, the

it pertains to this case, was unconstitutional. Andres Vegas was delivering
pizza near 22nd and Locust streets Jan. 4 when a 16-year-old pulled out a
gun and demanded money, police said. Vegas was accused of pulling out his
own gun and shooting the teen three times. ... [Vegas's lawyer, Craig
Mastantuono] said two laws collide in this case. One constitutional
amendment allows people to bear arms for certain purposes, such as
self-defense, but another makes it illegal to carry a concealed and
dangerous weapon. 'So you have this gap between what the amendment allows
for in terms of protecting Wisconsin citizens and what the law bans. Right
now this gap is the problem,' Mastantuono said.&quot; (09/24/07)

26) Differences in the two parties
Liberty For All
by Paul Delacroix

&quot;Both parties favor a huge, overbearing, intrusive, and extremely expensive
Federal government. The difference is that Republicans prefer to put us
deeper into debt, rather than raise taxes. On the other hand, both parties
have no problem keeping the rate of income taxation as obscenely high as it
is, and keeping the tax code complex and ridiculous instead of changing to a
simpler, fairer system (and thereby eliminating the IRS). Both parties like
the taxation Status Quo, where the citizen fears a government agency in
charge of fleecing said citizen's money.&quot; (09/25/07)

Reason
by Jesse Walker

&quot;The First Amendment is not at issue here. But free speech is at issue,
because this tempest gets to the heart of a key argument for the open
marketplace of ideas: the idea that hearing what other people have to say
and confronting their ideas is good, and that doing so makes us not weaker
but stronger. 'This event has nothing whatsoever to do with any rights of
the speaker,' Bollinger said as he introduced his guest, 'but only with our
rights to listen and speak. We do it for ourselves.' That is why the petty
tyrant who spoke at Columbia emerged bruised instead of beaming.&quot; (09/25/07)

28) Trying to kill the Ron Paul Revolution ... years before it started
Freedom's Phoenix
by Ernie Hancock

&quot;The Ron Paul Revolution is very scary to everyone that seeks to control
individual effort. And the desire by individuals to not be controlled in one
of the most powerful demonstrations of the people's will in the history of
this country has produced at least as great a desire to control them. Those
fearful of the people's influence in the toppling of an oppressive and
unconstitutional government would not hesitate to cut off the head of this
phenomenon if they could only find it. Ron Paul is very smart to make it
clear that he is happy to be allowed to join the people's revolution. He
knows better than to become a 'head' that would simply be removed at the
whim of those he knows all too well wouldn't hesitate if they thought it in
their self interest to do so.&quot; (09/25/07)

29) Cui bono? -- and Bush's monstrous, deadly dare
The Power of Narrative
by Arthur Silber

&quot;In brief: the major actors in the Bush administration are achieving exactly
what they want. They may well be about to launch the start of World War III,
which will further enrich their corporate friends by many additional
billions of dollars. As the favored few continue to amass vast wealth, the
government continues to consolidate political power to an extent that makes
a future dictatorship fully realizable. They are well on the road to the
achievement of wealth and power on a scale rarely if ever equalled in the
history of civilization. To describe such an achievement as the result of
'Monumental Stupidity' is, well, stupid.&quot; (09/25/07)

30) Dress rehearsal for war
AntiWar.Com
by Justin Raimondo

&quot;Just when you thought the War Party was down, and nearly out, President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did them the favor of paying a visit to New York, the
town that trademarked rudeness. This gave the usual suspects an opportunity
to rehearse, so to speak, for the coming war with Iran. Every symphony has a
prelude, and this one -- Gotterdaämmerung II? -- has as its central theme
the villainous caricature of an Iranian president who denies the Holocaust
and threatens to 'wipe Israel off the map.' The opening act was
Ahmadinejad's Columbia University performance, preceded by a long, hectoring
introduction by university president Lee Bollinger, who took the opportunity
to assuage his critics by preparing what he doubtless thought would be an
ambush. Except it didn't turn out that way. Instead, Ahmadinejad came out
looking rather more sympathetic than he appeared going into that lion's
den.&quot; (09/26/07)

31) Gold standard
Independent Country
by James Leroy Wilson

&quot;Precious metals will always be the world's reserve currency. Even though
nations do not define their currency by their by their worth in, say, gold,
individuals will still buy gold to protect themselves from inflation. The
more money a nation's central bank pours into the economy, the less valuable
the dollar is, which means the price of everything else rises. Seeing that
the dollar is cheap, many individuals start to distrust the national economy
and instead of investing in dollar-making opportunities like business
expansion, they will buy gold. Unlike paper dollars, gold isn't that easy to
find or produce. When the central bank prints so many dollars as to be
nearly worthless, those who are able will start to use gold as their
currency.&quot; (09/24/07)

32) High school streaker faces jail and sex offenders list
Classically Liberal
by CLS

In Pleasant Grove, Utah the High School was holding a Homecoming Pageant.
One of the students decided to pull a prank. An old prank done for years at
sports events, parades, or any public gathering. He streaked. He ran across
the school stage in the nude for a few fleeting seconds. People no doubt
laughed. A few were shocked. And a few no doubt were horrified. So was the
student suspended? Expelled? Fined, even? No! He's facing serious charges of
lewdness in front of children. Since he did this at school many of the
audience members are under 18 years of ago. He could be jailed. And worse!&quot;

33) Iraq and roll over

&quot;It is time to face the blunt truth: This Congress, despite its nominal

is not defeatism on the home front nor is it a rant against the

inescapable conclusion is based on the coin of the realm on Capitol Hill --
the stark arithmetic of head counts.&quot; [editor's note: Run up the BS flag.
All of Shapiro's wailing about lack of GOP defections and the spectre of

end the war by preventing cloture on any future funding - TLK] (09/26/07)

34) What Would Jesus Drive?
National Review
by Jay W. Richards

&quot;Why is the mainstream media suddenly so interested in Evangelical views on
the environment? Before 2006, you would have looked hard to find stories on
the subject. This started to change in 2002, when an outfit called the
'Evangelical Environmental Network' launched a campaign that asked: 'What
would Jesus Drive?' The mainstream media gave the campaign positive
coverage. The big publicity started in February 2006, however, when several
major media outlets reported the Evangelical Climate Initiative (ECI). The
brief document was signed by 86 Evangelical leaders, who announced their
support for what The New York Times called 'a major initiative to fight
global warming.'&quot; (09/25/07)

information? In the mortgage market, are we making it too difficult or too
easy for first-time homebuyers to purchase homes? Would one have expected
that the cost of restoring order after an invasion of Afghanistan to be
relatively light compared to the cost of restoring order after an invasion
of Iraq? Most people approach these issues with hindsight bias. In
situations of uncertainty, hindsight bias causes a number of problems.&quot;

36) Six ways to beat Hillary Clinton
Slate
by John Dickerson

&quot;Clinton has consolidated her lead in the polls -- she's up by 17 points
nationally and has big leads in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, and
Florida. The new recognition that she's pulling away may make this debate
more interesting than the 384 that came before it, because the also-rans may
decide they have to direct their fire on the front-runner, as trailing
Democrats did when Howard Dean opened up a lead in the 2004 campaign. Of
course, attacking is risky: Rick Lazio torpedoed his 2000 Senate campaign
when he attacked Clinton and came off looking like a cheap thug. Iowa
voters, in particular, tend to frown on uppercut politics. And Clinton is a
tougher, more skilled, and more disciplined politician than any of her
opponents. But she is not invincible.&quot; (09/25/07)

37) Inconvenient truths
The Weekly Standard
by Irwin M. Stelzer

&quot;If you follow the media you must think that everyone agrees that the earth
is warming, and that it is our fault because we create greenhouse-gas
emissions by driving, flying, heating and cooling our homes, and making
other uses of fossil fuels. And you must think that everyone agrees that
unless something is done, and soon, the polar ice cap will melt, floods
around the world will become more frequent and more lethal, and hurricanes
will increase in intensity and frequency. If you don't believe this calamity
is upon us, go see Al Gore's movie, [An] Inconvenient Truth. Well, not
everyone thinks our future is so dire. There are responsible scientists who
attribute recent warming to the natural, long-run rhythms of the weather
cycle. Others concede that the earth is warming, but say that it is
important not to panic lest we rush to adopt excessively costly solutions.
Still others urge us to Cool It, the title of a wonderfully readable new
book by Bjorn Lomborg, an economist specializing in environmental matters.
No matter: enough people believe something must be done to propel
politicians into action -- not always a good thing.&quot; (09/25/07)

38) Abolish all copyright!

&quot;In an ideal world, one would be able to copyright writing or music that one
creates, and the copyright would expire with the death of the author. One
would be able to sue for copyright violation only when one can prove that
the copying had taken place and harmed the ability of the author to benefit
from his work, and the compensation would only be for the amount of lost
revenue plus a moderate extra amount as a deterrent. But we have moved far
away from this ideal. The copyright laws are now being used to plunder the
wealth of people who have not even copied the work. Copyright has become a
random tax on the population -- you can be attacked by the copyright tyrants

&quot;Yes, writers (especially writers, damnit), artists and inventors should be
encouraged to produce and enrich the world around them. But if you reach the
point where products of the mind can be reproduced at a whim -- or the click

understand it can be protected only by prosecution of the public-at-large,
sabotage and suppression of technology, then something has to give. And what
has to give is the artificial model of intellectual property that has served
us so far, but may no longer be relevant. What should replace that model?
I'm not sure -- but I think that replacement shouldn't be dictated; it
should evolve to meet new conditions.&quot; (09/25/07)

Intellectual Conservative
by Aaron Goldstein

&quot;I was a member in good standing with the NDP and was in solidarity with
gender parity on party executives and at party meetings. I believed in
affirmative action and testified in favor of it in front of legislative
committees at Queens Park in Toronto. I was no reactionary behemoth back
then. But when I would hear how women would govern by consensus and that
there would be no more war I drew the line. I would inevitably point out
that Margaret Thatcher led Great Britain into the Falklands Islands War
against Argentina in 1982. Almost to a woman, the response to that would be,
'Thatcher's more like a man.' As one might imagine, this would be said in
the most derisive way imaginable. Yet history demonstrates that women
leaders -- be they monarchs or presidents -- will just as surely go to war
as their male counterparts and very often for the same reasons.&quot; (09/24/07)

creating an ecological crisis by not taking care of our water supplies.
Surface waters are being polluted, and we are mining our groundwater at
unsustainable rates. At the very time when corporations are privatizing
everything, our governments are allowing corporations to move in and take
over the ownership of essential resources like water. So we have a double

then they are signing contracts with corporations to bring in clean-up

44) Easy out
The American Conservative
by Gregory Cochran

&quot;Politicians, for the most part, have accepted statements about withdrawal
requiring anywhere from one to two years. They want to be 'responsible' --
that'll be the day. Some may have calculated that slow withdrawal might
better disguise defeat and thus be more politically palatable, but I don't
think many are that Machiavellian. I think instead that, with a few
honorable exceptions, they're profoundly ignorant of war and thus have to
blindly accept anything the professional military says. That ignorance is,
of course, one of the reasons we got into this mess in the first place. That
goes double for columnists: in pundit-land, a military expert is someone who
thinks that the phalanx is cutting-edge technology. The bottom line is that
we can get troops and war-fighting equipment out of Iraq rapidly and
relatively safely, certainly in less than six months, probably in three.&quot;

45) Reduce traffic congestion, but keep out government
Independent Institute
by Gabriel Roth

&quot;If pricing is applied to the scarce resource 'road space,' and the revenues
are allowed to stimulate investment in additional lanes or new technologies
to speed traffic past bottlenecks, congestion could be reduced. This has
been happening since 1995 on parts of the express lanes of California's
State Route 91, on which charges vary from $1.20 to $9.50. Unfortunately,
some government officials and environmental activists embrace road pricing
only to restrain the demand for road use, not to increase road capacity.
London's Mayor Ken Livingstone, for example, introduced 'congestion pricing'
in London in 2003, but surplus revenues are being spent on mass transit. But
just as sensible people do not allow alcoholics to run liquor stores, the
insatiable thirst of governments for money should preclude them from
involvement with road-use funds.&quot; (09/24/07)

the passage of legislation is only the beginning. A strong, broad, and

51) A bipartisan way out of Iraq

&quot;There is a bipartisan 'way ahead' in Iraq if viewed in terms of progress
for America's security and not solely Iraq's, with a strategy that focuses
on our national interests in this conflict, not just the interests of
Iraqis. Our troops have served our country courageously and brilliantly, but
our engagement in Iraq has degraded our security, pushing our Army to the
breaking point so that it cannot confront other pressing security concerns
at home and abroad. My military service as a three-star vice admiral --
having led an aircraft carrier battle group in combat operations in
Afghanistan and Iraq and served as director of the Navy's anti-terrorism
unit -- convinces me that an inconclusive, open-ended involvement in Iraq is
not in our security interests. Ending this war is necessary. But how we end
it is of even greater importance for both our security and our troops'
safety. These two considerations are the dual catalysts for a bipartisan
discussion on this issue.&quot; (09/25/07)

* Weekly Symposium
********************

71) Class is in session

One of the reasons I started the &quot;symposium&quot; feature in RRND/FND was to get
your input and feedback on projects I'm interested in doing -- so I'd be
remiss if I didn't bring you in from the beginning of Tom Paine University:

http://tpu.rationalreview.com

TPU launches on October 1st with one pilot course, &quot;Letters to the Editor
101.&quot; This is sort of a shakedown/beta testing period, and I'm limiting the
class size to 10 students, first come, first served. Enrolment is open now,
and you'll need the code &quot;LTE101PILOT&quot; to get into the class.

In the meantime, whether you take the class or not, please register at the
site and weigh in with your opinions, suggestions, etc. -- for example, what
other classes would be interesting (&quot;nuts and bolts&quot; or &quot;ideological&quot; -- but
on the latter, expect a radical orientation)?
