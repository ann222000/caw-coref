Daily Reflections

REMOVING THREATS TO SOBRIETY
. . . . except when to do so would injure them or others. . . .
ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS , p. 59

Step Nine restores in me a feeling of belonging, not only to the
human race but also to the everyday world. First, the Step makes
me leave the safety of A.A., so that I may deal with non-A.A.
people &quot;out there,&quot; on their terms. It is a frightening but
necessary action if I am to get back into life. Second, Step Nine
allows me to remove threats to my sobriety by healing past
relationships. Step Nine points the way to a more serene sobriety
by letting me clear away past wreckage, lest it bring me down.

Twenty-Four Hours A Day

A.A. Thought For The Day

Another of the mottoes of A.A. is &quot;Live and Let Live.&quot; This, of
course, means tolerance of people who think differently than we do,
whether they are in A.A. or outside of A.A. We cannot afford the
luxury of being intolerant or critical of other people. We do not
try to impose our wills on those who differ from us. We are not
&quot;holier than thou.&quot; We do not have all the answers. We are not better
than other good people. We live the best way we can and we allow
others to do likewise. Am I willing to live and let live?

Meditation For The Day

&quot;And this is life eternal, that we may know Thee, the only true
God.&quot; Learning to know God as best you can draws the eternal life
nearer to you. Freed from some of the limitations of humanity, you
can grow in the things that are eternal. You can strive for what
is real and of eternal value. The more you try to live in the
consciousness of the unseen world, the gentler will be your passing
into it when the time comes for you to go. This life on earth should
be largely a preparation for the eternal life to come.

Prayer For The Day

I pray that I may live each day as though it were my last. I pray
that I may live my life as though it were everlasting.

As Bill Sees It

Growth By The Tenth Step, p. 65

In the years ahead A.A. will, of course, make mistakes. Experience
has taught us that we need have no fear of doing this, providing that
we always remain willing to admit our faults and to correct them
promptly. Our growth as individuals has depended upon this healthy
process of trial and error. So will our growth as a fellowship.

Let us always remember that any society of men and women that
cannot freely correct its own faults must surely fall into decay if not
into collapse. Such is the universe penalty for the failure to go on
growing. Just as each A.A. must continue to take his moral inventory
and act upon it, so must our whole Society if we are to survive and if
we are to serve usefully and well.

A.A. Comes Of Age, p. 231

Walk In Dry Places

/*Change is sometimes necessary
Improvement.*/*
Despite the fact that many of us live turbulent, chaotic lives, we may
find in sobriety that we don't like change. This causes us to seek
our security in familiar places, rather than reach out for the unknown
that lies ahead.
This may not be real security, however, because familiar places and
situations
also change. Our resistance to change may simply be the fear of trying
something new.
If we find that fear of change is causing us to put up with a situation
that's
become unsatisfactory, we need to adjust our attitude toward it.
While we view change as risky, it may be the necessary route for
improvement. Let's start by simply accepting the idea that change is
sometimes necessary. After that, we can expect our Higher Power to guide
us to the new situations that are right for us.
Today I may find myself fearing change. I'll remind myself that
nothing ever stays the same, and that only change can bring the true good
I'm always seeking. ** **

Keep It Simple

*** ** Addiction is answering the spiritual calling inside us by going
to the wrong address.
---Chris Ringer
Where can we go to feel better, to feel spiritually alive? Not to
alcohol or other drugs. Not to compulsive spending, gambling, or sex.
Not to overeating or overworking. When we turn to these things to feel
better, we're trading one addiction for another, we're going to the
&quot;wrong address.&quot;
What is the right address? Our inner needs. Our Higher Power. Our
recovery program. Our friends. Soon, we become part of a network of
&quot;safe addresses.&quot;
Prayer for the Day:  Higher Power, keep me on the right path. I don't
want to go to the wrong address anymore.
Action for the Day:  Today, I'll make sure I have at least three &quot;right
address&quot; in my wallet or purse. I'll list names and day and evening
phone numbers of people who will love and help.**

**Alcoholics Anonymous - Fourth Edition

SAFE HAVEN - This A.A. found that the process of discovering who he
really was began with knowing who he didn't want to be.

*The following day a newspaper honored our station with a nice article
about the professional job we did on weather coverage.  But what no one
new was that all of those &quot;professional&quot; storm reports were called in
from the safety of my back patio as I ad-libbed a little better with
each fresh glass of bourbon and cola.*

Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions

Tradition Six - &quot;An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the
A.A. name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems
of money, property, and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.&quot;

Soon they'd spotted their man, an A.A. with the necessary experience.
Straightway he appeared at New York's A.A. headquarters, asking, &quot;Is
there anything in our tradition that suggests I shouldn't take a job
like this one? The kind of education seems good to me, and is not too
controversial. Do you headquarters folks see any bugs in it?&quot;

pp. 157-158

***********************************************************

Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an
understanding of ourselves.
--Carl Jung

During his lifetime, an individual should devote his efforts to creating
happiness and enjoy it.
--Ch'enTu-hsiu

&quot;It takes less time to do things right than to explain why you did it
wrong.&quot;
--Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

&quot;Give to the world the best you have and the best will come back to
you.&quot;
--Madeline Bridges

Understanding a person does not mean condoning; it only means
that one does not accuse him as if one were God or a judge placed
above him.
--Erich Fromm

Father Leo's Daily Meditation

FEAR

&quot;The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself.&quot;
-- Franklin Delano Roosevelt

Fear is a killer. It is a killer because it drains us of life, energy and
creativity. Fear petrifies the human spirit.

I spent a lot of yesterdays afraid. Afraid of people finding out. Afraid
of the telephone. Afraid of where it would all end. Afraid of me! I did
not realize that I was feeding the fear with my behavior. I drank
myself into fear. The day I stopped drinking alcohol was the day I
stopped giving energy to my fear.

Today I live my life without abnormal or unrealistic fears. Today I
enjoy my life. I work through my problems. I am not afraid of my
shadow. Today I love me.

Lord may I always connect my unrealistic fears with my behavior
-- and begin the change.

***********************************************************

&quot;I will turn their mourning into joy, I will comfort them, and give
them gladness for sorrow.&quot;
Jeremiah 31:13

And we know that all things work together for good to them that love
God, to them who are the called according to His purpose.
Romans 8:28

Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy. He who goes out
weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying
sheaves with him.
Psalm 126:5-6

Daily Inspiration

In everything imitate God and you will come to know Him better and
better. Lord, I ask Your help to come close to You in my thoughts and
bring Your love to this earth.

If you are prepared to die, you will also be prepared to live. Lord, You
have given me life and made ready the Kingdom of Heaven. I dedicate
myself to You.

*Ask and you shall receive,*
*Seek and ye shall find, *
* Knock and it shall be opened unto you. *
* Matthew 7:7
