We walked around the seafront today, about 8 km towards Umupuia and
then back.  It was a lovely day, and quite a few visitors.

Past Magazine Bay toward Umupuia, the sea front is rocky and the road
runs above the sea.  People park at pull-off points and go down to the
beach.  It's usually possible to match the people on the beach with
their cars on the road above.

So, we came past a young couple sitting cuddling on a rock and
enjoying the sun.  A few yards further on, a car, presumably theirs,
on the edge of the road above.  And tumbling down the bank onto the
beach, from directly below the car, maybe 40 or 50 A4 pages of
laser-jet printed photos.  Of private parts belonging to two young
people, probably (judging by complexion) the same two young people
sitting on the rock.

My guess is that the photos escaped by mistake and the young folks
were soon to have a moment of pure embarrassment.

lol, gee you didnt hang around for the moment? I wouldve!

40-50 of the same or different angles? Sounds very peculiar. Maybe there was
a film crew watching you and your reaction.

Er - no.  Beach-combing instinct led me over to check what the photos
were, but when I realised, I didn't want to go much nearer.  It would
have been interesting, though, to see how they'd react to "I say, are
those your photos?"

Skip stopped for some casting practice 200m further along, and I must
admit I went back past the couple - checking out whether they were
likely to be the models.  Then I watched a bit more from down the
beach, and saw a young guy carrying a water bottle wander that way.  I
saw him spending some time examining the scene, but he didn't pick
anything up.

There was another case that someone posted here, recently: 16 year old
girl prosecuted for child pornography because she and her 17 year old
boyfriend took photos of each other's naughties and exchanged them by
MMS.  Maybe it's the latest craze.
