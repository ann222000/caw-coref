RIAA is getting its jollies pounding away on a single working mom who
doesn't know how to use a computer, much less download music. Her 14
yr. old daughter did it in ignorance, but RIAA's lawyer will not
relent:

I don't see how they are going to get any significant money from her.
She seems pretty much broke to me. I also suspect that her legal defense
costs will be paid by the taxpayers if this is a criminal case. Whoever
is running the RIAA's campaign hasn't a clue about public opinion and
how to manage a campaign.

I hardly buy any music anymore -- I still will buy Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers stuff (gosh I love that band), but thats about it any
more. I don't download songs illegally either, and never have. I am just
tired of the same crap the music industry serves up.

The RIAA's argument that the downturn in music sales is completely due
to illegal downloading is disingenuous at best, and an outright lie at
worst.

Stealing music is a crime, no argument from me, but it would be smarter
to promote and produce better music because in the long run the music
business will reap far more money that way as opposed to taking
'recreational' low scale downloaders to court. As far as locking all the
content down with DRM goes, the cost associated with that path is huge
as well, and the army of hackers has proven to be far better at picking
the locks than the rights-holders ever imagined. I am actually very
sympathetic to the hackers who use the new 'tools' to unlock content so
they can exercise their fair use rights.

Interesting to see organizations like the RIAA and companies like
DirecTV taking their customers to court. Wonder if it will buy them any
'friends?'

Although the copyright statutes have criminal provisions, any
criminal prosecution must be brought by the U.S. Attorney in
the jurisdiction.

That's BS. Fourteen year olds are pretty smart and have good knowledge of
right/wrong. If she truly was clueless, she should maybe be riding the
'short bus' to a different school. Did she think that Kazaa or whatever she
was using was created by a record company? Duh.

If nothing else, maybe it'll prompt the mother to be a little more

This brings up a bigger issue. We now have an entire generation that
seems to feel that music is &quot;supposed&quot; to be free. Draconian laws are
not gonna work any more than prohibition worked in the 1920s. Any
ideas on how this problem can be solved?

about computers than their children do. Many parents today grew up in homes
without computers and attended public schools without computers and have
somehow managed to survive in their chosen careers without computer skills.
Meanwhile, their kids are growing up with computers, and start using them in
pre-school. By the time they hit their teens, they are SO far ahead of the
computer learning curve that their parents could never hope to catch up.
Many of the kids have designed their own web site already, and the parents
can't even view it unless the child helps them! -Dave

many frivilous lawsuits are filed just to intimidate and harass others,
particularly when the corporation has the time and money to sue
people into bankruptcy regardless of merit.
A case in point: DirectTV is harassing anyone with certain security devices
because they MIGHT be used for bypassing their security,
regardless of other uses. Since satellite TV is passive,
they don't bother gathering ANY evidence that the person is receiving
their programming or even has a TV!

It's analogous to someone taking away your photocopier
because it could be used for copying money.

"/> Yes. A new business model. Record companies sell songs cheap (around
$.50, or maybe a monthly &quot;all you can eat&quot; subscription. Songs come
with a _brief_ ad. Part of the revenue comes from advertising, some
from subscriptions/direct sales. Also, downloaded songs are
watermarked, so illegal copies can be traced back to whoever put them
on the net, although there may not be a whole lot to be done without
pissing off your whole customer base.

Let's face it. It costs 10 cents to produce a CD or DVD. The sales
price is nearly $20. Say 40% goes to the store, and probably at
least 25% to the distributor. That leaves $7 for the record company,
to pay for:
. one-time costs: studio, mixing, etc.
. advertising
. the 10 cents for the CD
. 5 cents more for the jewelbox and &quot;covers&quot;
. royalties to the composer and/or lyricist
. royalties to the performers.
. profit! necessary, else the whole business goes away.
. &quot;risk&quot; costs: sometimes the record company doesn't get back the
money it spent on the above four items.

A 1:15:00 CD will hold between 10 and 20 songs, depending on length.
So that's somewhere between 35 and 70 cents per song. If they sell
music over the internet, they don't have to pay distributors or record
stores. (Oh, add a couple of cents to the above costs for
bandwidth...)

Suddenly the cost model doesn't look so bad. I'm guessing the profit
_per copy_ will go down, and maybe the royalties will be a little less
rich (which is bad for beginning songwriters &amp; performers). But at
that price, I bet even teenagers won't be so willing to risk getting
caught and having to pay damages.

And best of all, I'll also bet that:
1. Their sales would go way up, because people would be a lot more
willing to spend $.50 to see if they like a song than $18-20 on
a CD that might have 1 or 2 songs they really like.
2. They get feedback faster. That means they can direct their
efforts more toward those songs, groups, etc. that produce
sales _this month_.

The history of technology shows that people (and corporations) that
_adapt_ to the new technology end up making _more_ money than they did
before the change. All the way back to &quot;radio is going to ruin our
record sales&quot;. Then it was wire recorders. Then tape recorders.
Than portable CD recorders. Then VCRs. Tivos. Every time, those who
got on the horse and hung on for dear life made money hand over fist.
The only losers were the ones who insisted the horse had to be tied
up inside a corral.

settlement would be about right if the OP had stolen 240 BILLION from the
RIAA all by herself. In that case, the monetary losses would be roughly
equal and the scales would be perfectly balanced. -Dave

Hey Geoff, would you mind defending me against the evil RIAA because
they won't let me download copies of Neil Young with Crazyhorse's old
album? I bought it on LP, but the media got screwed up. Then I bought it
again on cassette, but we know what happens with cassettes. Then I
bought it again on CD, but the CD got CD rot.

I estimate I've paid at least three times over and above what the
industry thought that album was worth, but if I go to download it,
they'll sue me for thousands.

I mean, I could see their point if I was reselling the album after I
downloaded it. Then, I figure, I'd owe them some money. But since I
already paid for it and own it fair and square and I'm not making any
money off it, I should be able to get it from whatever source I please,
and they shouldn't be allowed to say &quot;BOO&quot; legally.

That's &quot;just&quot;. That's fair use. Right now, the only &quot;justice&quot; is that
which slants the field considerably in favor of the heavyweights who
want already legal owners of their material to be forced to pay again
and again and again and again and again.

Thanks a lot to all the Brooks Brothers suits wandering zombie-like
through the halls Congress who thought this would be a good idea. No,
no, really. Thanks, guys.

"/> Two very good and valid points, although I would argue that the damages
suffered by the copyright holder should certainly be tied to the gain of
the infringer, especially if the plaintiff cannot conclusively prove
that the infringer never paid for the rights to own that material.

Moreover, I think that simply making a work available without
remuneration, doesn't mean infringment and wrongdoing. The reasoning
I've heard is that the RIAA doesn't want people *stealing* its stuff.
Making stuff available to others you own isn't stealing, sorry. It's
generosity. Why don't they go after the guy who breaks into my house and
steals my CD (or whatever) collection? He's probably selling his loot at
a local flea market; whoever buys them doesn't have to buy a new one and
thus is stealing food from the mouths of Bob Seger's suffering children,
not to mention Tom Waits' and Leon Russell's.

In any case, still the whole thing reeks; copy protection concerns
combined with the courts (lop)siding with the industry on curtailing
individual speech (which easily overcomes protective schemes) and
everything gets worse and worse and the industry makes either slaves or
enemies out of their entire customer base, squelching creativity and
fair use in the process.

The industry &quot;Examples&quot; are only going to raise the bar on what's
acceptable in the names of both nihilistic revolt and formal retribution.

The Jan/Feb '03 Utne Reader magazine had an article about why people
love war. There was a sidebar noting the differences between peacetime
and war. One of the differences was that in war, &quot;there are no innocent
bystanders; there are only those for or those against us&quot;. That's what's
happening with the entertainment industry, personified by the RIAA and
its gofers in government. With the staggeringly intrusive powers granted
to them by their very own pocket politicians, they have--to one extent
or another--declared war on their own customers. The conflict escalates
each time they do something like sue single mothers and their kids.

I believe there will certainly be a backlash, and whatever form it
takes, I hope they sell tickets to it--I'll be the guy in the front row
rooting loudest for the industry's ragtag opponents.

plaintiff has to show that the infringement was willful, and the court
has to feel that that amount is reasonable and just. (The minimum if
the infringement is innocent is $200 per work, which can still be a lot
of money if somebody is &quot;sharing&quot; a thousand songs.)

The amount is used in the complaint simply to say that they want relief
up to the maximum if they can make their case. It is not an estimate
of the actual damages or the worth of every song.

And it is not based on every download. Limits for statutory damages
remain the same whether there is one download or a million, since it
is based on the number of works infringed.

&gt;&gt;to the default download directory (where files you download from the
&gt;&gt;other users are stored). Most p2p programs will allow you to turn OFF
&gt;&gt;sharing, share only files of certain types, NOT share files of specific
&gt;&gt;types, or change your default directories so that you are not sharing
&gt;&gt;files that you download. The problem is, most p2p users won't think to
&gt;&gt;change such options, even if they are aware that the options exist.
&gt;&gt;Thus, every file downloaded is shared with the whole world. If you are
&gt;&gt;stupid enough to download thousands of mp3s, you are sharing thousands
&gt;&gt;of mp3s with the whole world. And a half million will be extorted from
&gt;&gt;your mom for your ignorance. -Dave

&gt; Unfortunately for those who don't want to turn off sharing with others,
&gt; or don't know how, copyright infringement is a strict liability
&gt; offence. The only consequence of innocent infringement is that
&gt; statutory damages can be reduced to $200 per work, rather than the
&gt; normal minimum of $750 per work.

"/> Doubtless true. However, those who wrote the laws didn't anticipate p2p.
Here the ditributors are more often than not teenagers who have perhaps a
net worth of $10 and whose largest asset is maybe a pair of Nikes.

"/> Clearly the case, since the statutory damages provision is part of the
1976 revisions to the copyright laws, and before that the 1909 act.

The response of Congress to a copyright infringer not having assets
comparable to the damage done has been to strength the criminal
provisions of the copyright laws, including an alternative to the
past requirement that criminal infringement had to be done not only
willfully, but &quot;for purposes of commercial advantage or private
financial gain.&quot; (The NET Act, passed in 1997.)

There is legislation pending (H.R. 4077, for example) that would remove
the &quot;willful&quot; requirement for large public distributions.

Maybe they will get to wear those Nikes in federal prison ...

Note that criminal penalties for copyright infringement are not a
new thing, but have been part of United States copyright law for
over a hundred years. And even before that, one could be jailed
if one could not pay a debt or a judgement.

inextricably joined.

Of course, if you had any foresight, you'd have made a tape or

"/>&quot;Again and again...?&quot; Er, how many times do you think the typical
consumer purchases a copy of the same album? It happens, obviously,
but it's not the default.

And when they do, it's for one of two reasons: Either the original
copy was defective, in which case the replacement is free anyway;
or the original copy wore out or was lost. Since there's obviously
no rational expectation that a copy of a recording won't eventually
wear out, a consumer doesn't have a leg to stand on as far as
demanding a free replacement is concerned.

a specific section of the copyright statutes (17 USC 117) and is

it does not cover &quot;licensees&quot; and there is reason to believe that
is the case. It covers only computer programs and not computer

Any right to make an archive copy of other than a computer program

recordings, for the Audio Home Recording Act (17 USC 1001 et seq)
if the proper device or media is used.

Talk about chutzpah...

When you buy something, you pays your money and you takes your
choice. There's no implicit guarantee that you'll like what
you selected. And since people who purchase new CDs tend to
prefer virgin, sealed copies, no merchant in his right mind
is going to take back a CD once it's been opened and played
and offer a full refund.

The best you'll be able to do is sell it to a store that sells
used CDs. The monetary loss you'll take in that case will serve
as a reminder to be more careful about your selections. Big,
adult people keep such experiences in perspective as just part
of life in the big city.

Careful or not, we all buy CDs occas- ionally that turn out to
be duds. I submit that anyone who can't afford to absorb such
a loss once in awhile probably shouldn't be spending his money
on music in the first place.

As for expecting a replacement for a CD that's worn out, that's
absurd. Copies of recorded music, like most consumer items,
have finite lifetimes. CDs may have lifetimes that are longer
than earlier media, but the same principle applies. When
something that you like wears out, you buy a new one.

I have to say, I'm a little taken aback at having to explain
all this to people who are old enough to operate a computer.

hurting anyone, just a big, giant corporation! Nevermind the
thousands that work directly for them, the money the corporation
spends with other companies for their good and services... The chain
goes down quite a few links... the hiring of cleaning services to keep
their offices clean, to pick up their garbage, the cafeteria
workers... geez...

That said, the Recording Industry was quite slow to catch on to the
internet revolution. Doesn't mean they deserve to be stolen from, but
they do need to see reality. They can't stop all pirating, but they
needed to jump on the bandwagon sooner. How anyone can now complain
about a buck a song is beyond me. Now you don't have to buy the whole
CD for one or two songs; a common justification for those who download
music illegally.
