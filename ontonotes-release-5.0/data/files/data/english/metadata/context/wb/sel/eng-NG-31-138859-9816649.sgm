*WRINKLES*
**

Wrinkles are delicate creases caused by thin, sagging skin. These are
especially visible on the face, neck and hands. Wrinkles appear when the
collagen and elastin present in the connective tissue of the skin is
weakened or decrease in number. Skin that has suffered such damage appears
thinner, loses fat content, elasticity and smoothness.

Symptoms for wrinkled skin
*Some of the symptoms of wrinkled skin are -
*
Lined and creased skin
Sagging skin
Areas that are more affected include sensitive skin near the eyes, lips and
neck.

Though some creases are temporary, they may become deeper and more permanent
due to ageing.

Wrinkles occur due to ageing process
Though wrinkles are a part and parcel of the ageing process, premature
wrinkles are a cause of concern for many. Some of the common causes of
wrinkles on skin are -

Over exposure to sun - The damage caused by the ultraviolet rays of the sun
is known as photoageing.

Smoking - Smoking hastens the ageing process. The large amount of free
radicals produced by cigarette smoke is one of the biggest culprits for
premature wrinkles. Free radicals can play havoc with the skin, damaging it
to an alarming extent.

Pollution - Environmental factors such as exposure to air pollutants, dust,
chemicals and harsh lights can cause wrinkles on skin over a period of time.

Repeated motions such as squinting can cause wrinkles around the eyes. These
are referred to as &quot;crow's feet&quot;. Smiling and frowning can also cause laugh
lines around the mouth or frown lines on the forehead.

*Drug use*
*
Stress*

Weight Loss - Rapid weight loss can cause wrinkles as the volume of the fat
cells (which have a cushioning effect) are drastically reduced. This causes
the skin to sag and crease.

Loss of Vitamin E - Depletion of this important vitamin can cause the skin
quality to deteriorate.
