&lt;No not *that* kinda bone, ya sickos...&gt;

OK, this is against my better judgement, but I'm more interested in
peoples' answers to the root question.

So Ollie wants to have a Judoka school him in some throws so he can
then go and try to work on defending them with tie chee.  I'm thinking
he'd only need to learn 4 throws:

Seoi-nage
De-ashi-berai
O-soto-gari
Kata-guruma

to conceptually cover what he wants.  Y'all thoughts?

And, just for my personal satisfaction, Ollie yer still a poopyhead.

I'd add a good hip throw in there (probably Harai Goshi if you're wanting to
keep it to the shortest possible list), a &quot;pick up&quot; (te guruma or sukui nage
or, especially, morote gari), and a sacrifice throw (yoko otoshi would be my
choice).

Thanks dan (and david), but out of curiosity, I was under the
impression there were say, 16 extremely common judo throws, 20 if you
are a little loser, and 40 would be a semi complete number. I don't
know exactly how many throws (more than 65?) there are...

But, why these 4 (or 5) throws in particular? Are these &quot;classes&quot; of
throws, in the same way that &quot;punches&quot; and &quot;kicks&quot; are classes of
strikes?

Not to be nasty, but watch how Ollie immediately turns this into an

the 16, or 24, and he'll just drag it out for about, oh.... say 104
posts by him.

There are a number of ways Judo throws can be divided.  For example, they
can be divided by the primary kind of action that is involved (whether
mostly hand action, or hip action, or leg action, etc makes the throw
&quot;happen&quot;).  These aren't hard and fast divisions since sometimes a throw can
fall near the boundary between two and be rather hard to classify.  Likewise
different variations of the same throw can functionally fall into different
categories.  &quot;Tai Otoshi&quot; is classically a hand throw.  The right leg is
stuck out for balance and to prevent uke from stepping around to regain
balance.  However, a modern form of Tai Otoshi comes in a lot closer, and
will &quot;pop&quot; the leg back at the point of decision, using the leg to actively
drive uke's weight bearing leg back.  This makes it function more as a &quot;leg&quot;
throw.

I can't speak to why Dan chose his four, but I added the ones I did based on
what it takes to defend against them.

For example, Harai Goshi is a hip throw.  Thrown right handed, it involves
pulling your opponent in tight and turning to the left.  Your right hip
forms a fulcrum and lifts while your right leg sweeps back both preventing
uke from stepping around and sweeping his legs out from under him.  If you
can internalize an ability to defend against Harai goshi, you are in good
shape to defend against other hip throws:  o goshi and uki goshi (no leg
sweep, one more or less over the hip and the other more or less around it),
tsurikomi goshi (tori comes in extra low and drives the right arm upward for
lift--a good throw for shorter tori), koshi guruma, etc.

My read on Dan's message was not to learn the throws for their own sake but
to learn them so as to develop &quot;tai chi&quot; defenses against them (if he can).
Between Dan's four and the one's I added, I think we've mostly covered, the
basic principles against which Renli would have to defend.

Here's one better... why not go have those four placed on you, practice
them, and then, evaluate what the effects upon your ideas are.

As opposed to intellectualizing the whole thing first, start small,
practice them, see the effects, and then.... considerations are not
merely chatter.  For instance. When I started a bit of training after I
quit the chen classes in chinatown, I did get thrown by the instructor
using judo throws.  The first thing I wanted to feel was, the 'feel' of
this, and the effect of landing, correctly, poorly etc etc.

He wound up using me, rather than the guys 15 yrs my junior, because I
wanted to feel it, and I was larger so I make a bigger thud, I guess.
But getting a feel instead of just intellectualizing is a source of
greater learning, not lesser.  So, he gave you four, to make it
applicable. That's it. Then try it out, and compare, see if it can be a
help with sjia, chin a etc, your attention, your sensitivity, your
fighting skills etc.

Incidentally, appropo the 'politics' that interest me- I went abroad to
get first hand experience, and not just once or twice, but in depth...
that at least meant I wasn't merely 'talking'.

Now, if you can leave it at that, I will be quite surprised.

I've never disagreed. I think the problems are a bit more muddlied with
Ollie and his assertions here, Chas.  Remember the problems with Bill
Mahoney, when he was paid to go.... and it wasn't he that was the

Not  'believer' a doer, for whatever little I could apply that too in
the circumstance. Hands on is always best, then, discussion becomes
physical, visceral, and more real. More cogent.

But again, we're speaking of Oliver; and there are a whole host of
problems with that. As I mentioned in one reply- Oliver should have
discussed with someone like Tim Cartmell about issues of trainning
versus fighting via neijia versus bjj, but he wasn't interested. He
could have gone to their forums and engaged discussions that would have
been productive, for him, but that's not what he wanted. He wanted to
post a thread about 'ownage' and 'mind bending' and such....

The problem is that a lot of the &quot;chi-detractors&quot; _did_ &quot;go see&quot; and the
results were either something that could be explained by tricks of leverage
(interesting, perhaps even useful, but rarely do &quot;chi proponents&quot; accept
&quot;chi&quot; as simply a label for certain classes of leverage tricks) or fails
utterly to do what's claimed &lt;cough&gt;Yellow Bamboo&lt;/cough&gt;.

When that happens, we are told not _this_ one, go see that one over
there.  But when that one also fizzles, we are directed to yet another one.
And again.

After a while it's okay to say &quot;enough&quot; and to start asking for some
kind of evidence that the next &quot;master&quot; in the list will be any different
from all the ones that went before.

Mahoney was scared to death to meet Wang, and instantly unilaterally
escalated the goal of the meeting (as proposed by Sigman, it was a simple
demonstration- if $250 demonstrations are ever considered 'simple').
He and Trav immediately started selling wolf tickets like they were planning
on eating red meat.
Wang is an Englishman visiting the US, indemnified by the dear old things
that put up the money/insurance/liability, and *they* were the ones that
read the thread, got scared that Wang would break Mahoney's bones for him,
and declined to underwrite the event.
There's nothing reticent about the Chens, by all accounts, so I find the
proposal that he declined out of cowardice to be funny.

Immediately Mike made the offer, Mahoney and Trav started fat-mouthing about

Nobody told you that it would be easy- in fact, the quest for real skills is
a common dramatic thread in the history of martial arts.
I first started in tie chee in 1974 (Rita Williams out of Marshal Ho) (20
years into my practice, starting in 1953), and was very dissatisfied with
any fulfillment of the promise of the art. In that timeframe, I met a number
of the 'mystical/spiritual' practitioners in the local area as well- the
Boulder crowd.
I met Bing Lee, Mike Bingo and Tung Kai Ying (Tung Family system) in about
'75/6, and saw enough skill to pique my interest, but they were still just
good martial artists. They have always been fighters in that school, so my
first exposure to the combat art rather than the spiritual/health practice.
I met the de Thouars bros. in '77, and experienced the first actual
expression of the internal strength (some 24 years into my practice), and
through them I met Bill Chang- who could do anything I could expect and some
more- and later on, after a long flame-war, I met Sigman- who has
irrefutable skills in some specialties of taiji (although he maintains that
he doesn't teach taiji- I assume in deference to the vast body of material
expected in a good teacher).
I've never hesitated to 'out' charlatans- but one must actually show up and
meet with them to know, or must accept the reports of others' that are
credible.
Incidentally, Sigman isn't shy about outing poseurs- and he meets them by
the bucketload, doing seminars internationally.
And I still haven't heard a name of anyone who's ever met him (being so
accessible as he is), and remained unconvinced.
not one.

Bill Mahoney has had plenty of experience in waiting rooms waiting to

Chas... you were accused of being part of that, if I remember. And I
still thought it was nothing. Oh for crying out loud. All this baloney
about zero times nothing. Grown men, meeting and armpit hairs spring
into action.... what a joke.

Chas, you remember you saying that the boston guys were chickening out
and all or something like that, after it happened?  It was all about
nothing. Zero.

Mr Wang should have taken an interest, in someone who paid to get to see
him, and simply taken it from there. I have no idea why the others were
even allowed to bother him with their paranoia. There was nothing going on.

It wasn't like when 'Uncle Bill and the tribe of brats invaded Mike
Sigmans seminar with mouthy nothings, veiled threats, and  5 against 1
odds. Now that was a bullshit threat about, well, not much.

Here it was scrawny 160lb Bill, going to visit- having paid for the
time-  to see a 200 lb guy.
By appointment, mind you.

By appointment.

And you're telling me, Mr Wang couldn't step up for that??

Excuses are nice. But whoever laid down and played dead, it wasn't Bill
Mahoney, and he did nothing discourteous like Uncle Bill, and Mr push
hands champeeen, and his three buddies, with their vulgar braying
smiles, invading a seminar- in the middle of a seminar- invading.

Nothing happened with Bill. He came. They said no go.
He left.
Wang could've cared less. And that also is problematic, as Mike Sigman
pointed out; when does tai ji stand up and show what it does, can do.

Don't blame Bill, who showed up. They were not guilty except of showing
up, having paid, and having then been 'rejected'.

don't blame Peter who showed up with Fraser for the yellow drumstick
challenge. It simply an artifice, at this point, to claim that those
guys are running away and not going to see.
Bill Mahoney went, and the taiji guys clucks like hens, and it was
embarrassing.  There was no challenge, no threats- and If I was there,
ans some guy came in, and I was hosting say, Wang, I'd say- 'let me ask,
there's some kind of internet bs that you might be here to start a
fight... ? If that's so, I don't want him to bother, it's a teaching
seminar. If you want to start a fight, with him, I'm going to take this
chair and bash you over the head with it while your busy pasting him.
Otherwise, enjoy talk smirk, laugh, question, engage him and if you
think it's bullshit, you may say so, or whatever, but let's keep it
civil ok? And I'd know in two seconds if the guy was dangerous.

Those guys didn't try, or even want too. And there was no need for any
of that fear. None. I've introduced people, and trust me, a grown up
man, should have no trouble accomplishing this or preventing trouble.
Period.

See... I have a problem with this, Chas. I was there in Ren Guan Yi's
class when his student, a tough guy, a karate guy, and a duker, who was
the second in the corner of one of the early UFC fighters, Larry
something or other- tought guy, karate guy, but outgunned by Marco Ruas
and mma fighters- he wanted Ren Guan Yi to go sign up for the UFC. He
had the papers with him, and he so desperately wanted Ren Guan Yi, to
fight in the UFC. He felt he'd really do well. He told me, Ren could
really fight and he could best him easily, and he wasn't used to that at
all, and that's why he trained Taiji.

Which I believe, just as I believe Ren Guan Yi, who is about 42 now, and
over the hill for UFC, shouldn't have fought. And I remember Ren making
eye contact with me, as he was offered to sign those papers, and my head
nodded silently side to side- 'don't do it, my eyes said' and Ren said
coyly- 'When they pay me 60,000 a fight, then I'll sign.

I thought he'd get killed by the ape's dejour and the bjj guys. I might
have been wrong. I don't know. I know I didn't like the guy, nor the
teaching, and felt rather cheated by him. That aside.  There have been
hundreds of mma fighters and others who've stepped up to try their hands.

Funny thing is, I remember meeting Wm Chen, CMC's student, and he was an
open competition fighter in his youth. Not 'mind bending' but he fought.
And his kids fight, now. And do Taichi. I liked him. I think I missed
out and should have taken the time to study with him way back  when.
No, I don't think he was 'mind-bending' but he was a real person, and I
remember talking with some guy- a teacher, some chinese style, can't
remember which who told me he was at his school once and he wanted to
give a try pushing hands with Wm Chen who very friendly said, sure,
let's go, and he was constantly tossed back, by Wm Chen and quite
impressed by his skill. He would have been 20 yr's younger then, and
that impressed me.

Nice stuff. Stuff I can wonder about, even admire. But all this talk to
guys who have come of age in the open martial arts competitions is
silly.  If any of the new generation of taiji guys steps up to take and
or give a beating, then I will be a happy man.

It's not an mma style, but it is a self defense style. Hell, old man
Shang tung sheng, the sjia chio fighter was a man who asked no quarter,
and gave no quarter. An open competition fighting champion in 27' or so,
and he when he met the guy who taught him taiji, it was by bashing the
taiji guy but good, who also gave it back but good. That impressed old
Shang, and he then  was willing to exchange fighting skills and learn it
for himself.

But in this age of open martial competitions, those who don't compete,
but demand others come to them for demonstrations of skill, are not
taken seriously. And that is of course how it should be. It doesn't
matter how much I think they really do have.

That's just the way it is.
I used to talk with that baji guy about mma fighters and fights. He
loved that stuff. He was a networking engineer at Lucent. He would have
enjoyed meeting anyone, and he did in my presence present himself
easily, and I think he had some real skills. Someone who felt Mike's
internal strikes and his told me they were about equal. That's nice.

Both men were nice fellows too.  But all this hoo hah about how the mma
guys have to present themselves is an old tune, and no longer carries
much weight.  Those other styles have put themselves on the line, for
fighting, and now, they get to have others also present themselves.

But in the end. It's all smoke and mirrors. If that baji guy were
around- by the way- his class wasn't much- but that's okay-
circumstances didn't make for a great class, but I'd have no problem
whatsoever introducing anyone here, to that guy. There's no reason why
the internal guys can't introduce their mma friends for a friendly
meeting.   I'm an adult, and this is all under the heading of adult
stuff... getting things done.

Alone. Not like Uncle Bill, and the Pushhands champeeeeeeen™ and his

What the hell did Bill Mahoney do...? he showed up.
I imagine him sitting there, thinking... 'why am I waiting??

Of course it doesn't matter _who_ you actually gets looked at.  If one
isn't convinced that the &quot;chi&quot; in question isn't &quot;more&quot; than leverage,
momentum, timing, etc. (IOW, stuff that can be thoroughly explained within
conventional science) than it's always someone else you should be trying.  I
don't have any grief with &quot;internal strength&quot; in those terms (and, IIRC,
that's all Mr. Sigman has ever claimed for it--physical skill that comes
from things like alignment and leverage, not any mystical &quot;energy&quot;).  In
fact, you'd probably be hard pressed to find any scientifically minded
person with an interest in MA who does.  It's that &quot;something outside of
science&quot; view that I, and many others, stick on.  For one thing, the people
making claims along the lines of &quot;science can't measure XXX&quot; invariably have
very little idea of just what science _can_ measure.

Go watch some videos of Kyuzo Mifune tossing guys around like rag dolls.
That's as impressive as anything any &quot;chi master&quot; I've ever seen has ever
actually been able to pull off (against &quot;real&quot; opponents) and while Mifune
was truly exceptional my own instructor can do the same thing to me quite
handily--all without invoking any mystical &quot;chi.&quot;  Likewise, back when I
studied as striking arts, we had demo instructors who, to all appearances,
would just lightly brush their hand against your ribcage (frex) but being on
the receiving end felt very much like getting hit by a very large hammer.
Yet no &quot;chi&quot; involved except as leverage, timing, and angles.

However, once you get into things people claim to be able to do with
&quot;chi&quot; that cannot be fully explained by things like leverage, timing,
angles, momentum, reaction time, etc., the success rate of these
demonstrations starts falling way down.

I'm not not really all that interested in spending a lot of time on
somebody elses set of leverage/timing/et al tools.  I've got enough to do
just keeping up with the ones in my own art.  As for the other--I've done my
time there and been quite thoroughly disappointed.  It will take more than
just naming names to show that it's more worth my time than all the others
that proved to be complete wastes of time.

And, no doubt, would have- had he known about it at all.
The Chens, as I understand it, tell jokes amongst themselves that end with

He's not proficient in English, he's in a foreign country with a limited

Heh-
Don Miller was his usual dudself, but Bill took it dead seriously- the
exchange between Mike and Willem was as classic as 'High Noon'. Both of them
were loaded for bear, and both were conciliatory enough to walk away without
the battle.
Miller should kneel by his bed in his PoohBear jammies and thank Chthulu he
wasn't stupid enough to try Sigman out, like he'd been bragging to Willem.
Bill would not have gone to the event at all (he was very embarrassed), had
Miller not promised a denouement to all the fat-mouth crap he was spewing.
Miller and Bill parted company soon afterwards when Don wouldn't just gut-up

The appointment was with the Boston Tea Party, not with Wang- I doubt if he

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And you're telling me, Mr Wang couldn't step up for that??

No; Wang is supposed to be very powerful and prepared for challenges in his

I think he would have worked with Mahoney at any level of 'resistance' that
Bill cared to try out.

Yeah- but the only bad part was Miller crapping out when he saw Sigman- you
would have been able to see it in his eyes if they weren't so beady.
Willem has a long history of going to schools and challenging the master- he
used to have his Seniors go do it as well.
It's utterly rude, but martial art is all about doing rude things. At least
in confronting other martial artists, everybody signed up for it and should

&gt;.....when does tai ji stand up and show what it does, can do.
">

Being able to demonstrate fajing without hurting anyone, with a compliant
uke, is difficult; more difficult than just being able to generate it, and
that's hard enough in itself.
You either shoot people or you don't. There's no mitigating a .357, and if
you practice shooting a high-powered firearm, there's no way to 'almost
shoot' someone, or shoot them 'just a little bit'. The same with
taiji/internal strength- who wants to 'prove' something by shattering a bone
or damaging an organ?
If you're good enough to both do it at strength, and mitigate it enough to
demonstrate without hurting, you're pretty polished. If you could do it
within a fighting context for sporting purposes, you'd be a whizkid indeed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Don't blame Bill, who showed up. They were not guilty except of showing
&gt; up, having paid, and having then been 'rejected'.
">

They were already guilty of making threats on the newsgroup which
intimidated the people indemnifying the taiji club's liability.
It was all about insurance and litigation- against the club- in the case
that Wang maimed Mahoney for getting frisky.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; don't blame Peter who showed up with Fraser for the yellow drumstick
&gt; challenge. It simply an artifice, at this point, to claim that those guys
&gt; are running away and not going to see.

Nobody has contacted a legitimate taijizer- YB was a joke before the
challenge ever happened- at that, the YB guy wasn't going to touch anyone.
Wang touches people, if rumor be our guide.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Bill Mahoney went, and the taiji guys clucks like hens, and it was

Great post, David. I'm inclined to believe that what passes for &quot;I felt a jolt
like electricity&quot; is merely a misinterpretation of simple physical dynamics.

A couple of years ago I did a seminar with Royler Gracie and one of his black
belts, Bruno Panno. We were shooting the breeze after the seminar and we started
discussing variations on the guillotine choke and Bruno says &quot;Here, I'll show you
something really nasty&quot; so of course he has my immediate attention :)

Now I generally don't find the guillotine too tricky to escape, nor do I find it
as uncomfortable as many..it's a matter of knowing how to relieve the pressure,
staying relaxed etc.

So Bruno applies his variation of the guillotine to me and BAM!! it feels like,
yup, a jolt of electricty surging through my neck and I can't tap quickly enough
to stop the pain, it was excruciating.

We went through the intricacies and it was merely a different positioning of
hands etc but the difference between what he showed me and what I already knew
was, well, chalk and cheese in terms of pain etc. Ask any of the guys here who
I've subsequently shown it to and they will tell you how it feels.

It sure FELT like an electric shock....but was it? Of course not!

If we're inclined towards mysticism etc it's easy to find it, but Occam's Razor
should incline us towards the more mundane explanations, which almost invariably
prove to be correct.

&gt;&gt;Nothing.
&gt;&gt;And you said, something like...'word of this has gotten all the way back
&gt;&gt;to Chen village by now'

&gt; News travels fast.

Not fast enough. After all was said and done, if news traveled, and I
was Wang... on my next visit to Boston I would have had them call bill
Mahoney and said, 'hey, sorry about the mix up- if you'd like to stop by
and talk feel free, I'd like to see some of that mma stuff, and perhaps
I could show some of this chen tai ji fighting techniques'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Frankly it was a lot of nothing. Nothing at all.
&gt;&gt;Mr Wang could have said, 'hello my name is Wang, what can I do for you,

All the more sad.... what a waste

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Chens, as I understand it, tell jokes amongst themselves that end with

&gt; Chenjiazhou' (or however the hell you spell the village name).

Then all the more sad... that they prevented some friendly showcasing

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;But I blame Mr Wang. Because all he had to do, was say, 'What's the

&gt; The responders were the guys promoting the seminar; providing the seed

&gt; where to hide the body- it's in most contracts.

Ah mule muffins. I hosted Mike Sigman. If someone had come up to bother
him, I'm no fighter, but I would have been happy to put a chair over
their head. What the heck is the big deal. There was no challenge
contest. None. There were no challenges at all. It was all bs internet
monkey jabberings. That's all. Why should they have worried. It's not
like they got a phone call that said... mf'er, your done, were're coming
to put an end to this bs taiji shit.

There wasn't anything. Not even the show up without warning, without
paying, without invitation... like Uncle bill and his merry band of
bulldozers did, 5 to 1. Now that's a red flag... of sorts.

Annoying, rather insulting, but just a great big fart air of bulldozing.
Bill Mahoney didn't show up with his posse of merry mma'ers. He just
went there..... by appointment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Well, it was more like I didn't let any of their insults pass unanswered &lt;g&gt;
&gt; Wang would have wiped the floor with his little shattered body, Mark.

But we'll never get to even wonder about it... because all Bill got to
do, was waste a couple hours of his day, and watch some taiji'ers do the
chicken dance, as he wondered deep thoughts-
geez, where's the candy dish??-

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Fight? What fight? There wasn't any fight?

&gt; I'm sorry; I thought that 'ensuing' was, in general, in the future.

There wasn't even a brouh ha ha outside the school. Nothing. Nothing
happened. Nothing. It was all stupid paranoia about nothing at all.......

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;And Why...? Why was Wang unawares?

&gt; He's not proficient in English, he's in a foreign country with a limited
&gt; support system; he wasn't privy to the newsgroup discussion that was brought
&gt; to the attention of his hosts, and they found no reason to communicate it to
&gt; him- and they were liable for any injury to Mahoney on their property, with
&gt; their fighter.
">

And they were absurd, but what can I say. When you have someone and if
he gets attacked, I'd say that is sufficient witnesses to make the
attacker frightened of legal repercussions. What the hell were they
afraid of the 160 guy who had an appointment.

I can imagine me, being the greeter. Older, bluberrier, greyer, looking
at bill, and him looking thru me, like ... 'yeah, what do you want' with
that half cocky smile.

Do you really think it took any more than 'howdy neighbor' to get past
the cold zone?? I don't. I could get past that in a heartbeat.  Why
couldn't they....? It's really anyone's guess.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;It was his chance to show or try to show some of what he has.

&gt; Anybody that stands up in front of a group of people and says; 'Hi, my

&gt; I've never given a seminar to strangers that didn't have someone trying me
&gt; out.

And you guys don't play nice...at all. Those guys played nice, hell,
bill played way nicer than you ever did as a younger healthier fighter
when he was there. In fact, I bet he could give you cotillian lessons in
that regard :^)))

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Not by him. I think he has plenty of skills, and so... what was there to

Ahem, trav wasn't there. Nobody was there. Bill mahoney was there by
appointment.... staring at the walls, likely wondering why he was
bothering because, and I believe this to be true. He doesn't really have
time to screw around with want to be's except, in his gym. There, he was
asked to go... everyone asked him to go. Mike Sigman, paid him to go.

One guy, against five or so of Wang's handlers???

And meanwhile back at the ranch, a 160lb guy had an appointment to talk,

But as opposed to talking or heaven forbid being around this unctuous

strength, when meeting Mike, and discussing and playing around with a
guy like him.

And he would never try to sell that it's invincible or 'mind bending'
and all that.

Just that it's dammed interesting, useable, in a guy's hands, like
Mike's, an ex marine corp judo exhibition team guy,  and not likely that
you'd but come away fairly impressed, though most likely not interested
in changing your Judo learning or style.

If you're in Mike's neck of the woods, email him and see if you can
meet and work it out a bit. It would be fun, no problems, and I bet
you'd have a good time.

You asked so I'll answer, but you're opening a can of worms here;
consider yourself warned ;) No, you don't need chi to do push hands;
you don't even need chi to do push hands &quot;relatively well&quot;, and by
that I mean how *I* define &quot;well&quot;. However, you will get held back.
This speaks to the falsifiability of chi; no matter how good you think
you are at push hands, chi unlocks certain doors that lets you
progress faster.

It's not about over-compliance, willingness, or drinking travisgod's
&quot;kool aid&quot;. It's about what works and what doesn't. There are rules,
but the rules do not control you and it says nowhere that you have to
take a dive.

So you play the game, chi or not, you win, you lose, and you find your
level. Chi or not. But I daresay that if you play the game seriously
you will not have a choice over whether or not you will start feeling
chi. It's quite the insiduous method of biofeedback. Play it properly
and you can't help but to produce harmonies and melodies. Thats what
the rules are designed to produce.

You're starting to get into where mike sigman and I disagree wrt what
should be the core definition of internal strength. And it doesn't
speak to how &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;efficient&quot; either or of our training methods
are to learn, or how complex our theories are. The 100 days formula is
exactly what it says it is; 100 days. There is a very wide variety of
qigongs to choose from and many of them are public. There are places
you can go to get free DVDs of certain qi gongs (chi development
exercises).

">

&lt;grin&gt; But Mark, hitting is actually a very small portion of the
skill; in fact you could go as far as to say it's low percentage. To
receive is to issue; true; but even this isn't really the first gas
station on the road to internal strength, now is it? Mike himself
basicaly said that the teacher test was not intended to be a be all
end all test for IS anyways. So what would be? Groundpath? Of course
for this we're looking for something easily detectable, not
neccessarily the test of a master or the &quot;missing basic&quot;. Groundpath
as a &quot;static peng path&quot;, as the crow flies, likely isn't what we are
looking for then. Just an opinion. Store and release is a step up from
that, too - you could even call it a contrivance. Think about it, hit
someone with a lead pipe then hit them with a lead pipe shaped like a
U. What's the difference? you're still hitting them with a solid piece
of metal.

What's not a contrivance, is all I'm sayin'

If the requirement is proving a point, hitting is spectacular, I agree
- but it isn't everything, not by a long shot. I think this is a
little bit of a coke vs. pepsi argument. It IS worth discussing, Mark,
if you are interested in &quot;certain methods&quot;, &quot;certain qigongs&quot;, etc...
after all, there comes a time when a serious player needs to
specialize... Know what I mean?

After all, in the end, an error at the source of only a mm becomes a
deviation of 1000 miles at the destination... You'd think people who
were interested in IS would consider this the most important
discussion topic possible... eh? :)

&gt; It's not an mma style, but it is a self defense style.

No; it's a combative style, in it's essence.
The fact that the practices also seem to have some health benefits is
superfluous to it's basic utility. The Chen Family were bodyguards, caravan
guards- they imported medicinals from Indonesia, and had to guard them back
up into Mainland China when it was a series of unrelated warlord states. The
focus of the training isn't to learn to mitigate the skill, it's to express
it as violently as possible. People who learn to mitigate it for
demonstration are expressing even a higher level of capability.
The whole idea of an art being 'self defense' oriented is pretty much a
post-WWII concept. Our erstwhile enemies didn't want to seem aggressive, so
they painted martial skills as responsive rather than active.
One of the things I really appreciate from the Gracies is the return to the
concept of fucking hurting people aggressively.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But in this age of open martial competitions, those who don't compete, but
&gt; demand others come to them for demonstrations of skill, are not taken
&gt; seriously. And that is of course how it should be. It doesn't matter how
&gt; much I think they really do have.
">

If the art is taught as being for 'self-defense', then the 'challenged'
person is always in a permissible reactive mode when they fight.
Even Renzo Gracie, in response to Frank Shamrock's talking shit, was to
opine that Shamrock only had to 'tap me on the shoulder and challenge'-
Gracies have invited challengers to come to them, they didn't go out and
challenge people on their own ground (by and large- there are some
exceptions, but very few in light of the more common posture they take).
There are lots of people who issue 'challenges to the world'- but few that
go from system to system finding out what they do on their home turf.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ......But all this hoo hah about how the mma guys have to present

It's the same 'tune' that they sing- and have for many years.
The invitation is always for someone to drop by a bjj-school, or an mma-gym.
You don't hear much about mma'ers dropping by the taiji school.

Hell; Wang's in England- it's a significant investment just to host him here
in the US.

Sure-
they don't much actually go anywhere.

Why not?
Don't you, at least, think he showed quite nicely at the last one?
Perhaps he could try it without warning them in advance that they'd have to
deal with a 'resisting' opponent to the demonstration.
He could just show up and let fly- overcome the reticence of 'only used in
self-defense'.
He only lost a couple of hours and a half-tank of gas.

Oh cark-
Mahoney's satisfied the onus for the entire world?
On the basis of Wang having never known anything about it?
how droll.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     Go watch some videos of Kyuzo Mifune tossing guys around like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rag dolls. That's as impressive as anything any &quot;chi master&quot; I've

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opponents) and while Mifune was truly exceptional my own instructor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can do the same thing to me quite handily--all without invoking any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mystical &quot;chi.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; *shrug* that's not what chi is for, David.

&gt;&gt;     Is it, then, your contention that push hands has nothing to do
&gt;&gt; with chi?

&gt;&gt;     Anyway that's functionally the kind of thing that people bring
&gt;&gt; up in the &quot;go experience it for yourself&quot; arguments.  I can
&gt;&gt; experience the same kinds of things _without_ it being chi,
&gt;&gt; therefore going and being hit by Mike Sigman would only demonstrate
&gt;&gt; the same kind of momentum/leverage/timing/angles tricks that I've
&gt;&gt; seen elsewhere without invoking &quot;chi&quot; at all.  That would be fine if
&gt;&gt; one were simply saying that &quot;chi&quot; is a label to hose kinds of tricks
&gt;&gt; (no pejorative attached to this use of &quot;tricks&quot;).  But then if that
&gt;&gt; were all that were meant, there would be very little argument.

&gt; You're starting to get into where mike sigman and I disagree wrt what
&gt; should be the core definition of internal strength. And it doesn't
&gt; speak to how &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;efficient&quot; either or of our training methods
&gt; are to learn, or how complex our theories are. The 100 days formula is
&gt; exactly what it says it is; 100 days. There is a very wide variety of
&gt; qigongs to choose from and many of them are public. There are places
&gt; you can go to get free DVDs of certain qi gongs (chi development
&gt; exercises).
">

The big difference is Mike can actually demonstrate what he can do.  His
usage of &quot;internal strength&quot; translates into something real.

The others, definitions of &quot;internal strength&quot; which cannot be described
in physical terms, simply keep failing when the claims of what they can do
are actually examined.

So, Mr. Renli, perhaps you can name one thing, just one, that can be
accomplished by &quot;chi&quot; that cannot also be accomplished in exactly the same
way without appealing to &quot;chi&quot; as an explanation.  Push hands apparently
isn't it.  And now, by disagreeing with Sigman's approach, you have admited
that getting hit hard is not it.  And from comments you've made about
no-touch knock outs, it would seem that they are not either.

So what is?  Just one example.  Just one effect chi can have that cannot
be completely explained without any invokation of chi as an explanation.
Lay odds that any such thing you come up with is exactly the kind of thing
that consistently fails whenever non-believers look at it.
