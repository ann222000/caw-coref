&gt; Walgreens rolls over after EEOC suit

&gt; Sunday, March 18, 2007 | By Billy Roper At 9:32 AM

&gt; Walgreens offers jobs to black activists in exchange for support and
&gt; endorsement!

&gt; In a letter to Sonny Scroggins, the black activist who heads Kansas
&gt; City's anti-White &quot;Bias Busters&quot; organization, a Walgreen's spokesperson
&gt; stated:

&gt; Dear Mr. Scroggins:
&gt; I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you regarding the EEOC
&gt; lawsuit,  Please be assured that we have thoroughly examined the
&gt; issues raised in the EEOC's lawsuit, and we strongly believe these
&gt; allegations are without merit.

&gt; As a company with a history of commitment to fairness, diversity and
&gt; opportunity, we are saddened and disappointed by the EEOC's decision.

&gt; During our conversation, you inquired about employment opportunities
&gt; with Walgreens. As we discussed, we are committed to providing
&gt; opportunity to all employees -- not only because it is the right thing
&gt; to do but because our business was built on this principle.

&gt; We are also a drugstore industry leader when it comes to the employment
&gt; and promotion of African-American managers and pharmacists.

&gt; For example,  Walgreen store and district managers who are
&gt; African-American represent more than 17 percent of total employees in
&gt; those positions, compared to the industry average of 9 percent. When
&gt; looking at the employment of staff pharmacists at Walgreens,
&gt; African-Americans account for 15 percent of those positions compared to
&gt; the industry average of 10 percent.

&gt; I also had the opportunity to discuss your inquiry regarding career
&gt; opportunities in Topeka, Kansas with the local District Manager, Jeff
&gt; McKillop.  He would be happy to discuss this with you and Susan and
&gt; can be reached at 913-236-7271.

&gt; Again, it was nice talking to you. Please do not hesitate to contact me
&gt; with any additional questions or concerns.

&gt; Divisional Vice President
&gt; (847) 315-4299

&gt; &quot;It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate , tireless
&gt; minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men. &quot; --
&gt; Samuel Adams

&gt; &quot; George W. Bush is so pro-Mexico that if you hit him with a stick
&gt; prizes would fall out of him. &quot;

&gt; &quot;If you worship your enemy, you are defeated.
&gt; If you adopt your enemy's religion you are enslaved.
&gt; If you breed with your enemy you are destroyed.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice. It is not
&gt; a thing to be waited for - it is a thing to be achieved . &quot;
