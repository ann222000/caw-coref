Hello everyone,

This past tuesday we saw Dr Neighm's team for an evaluation. I had a
needle biopsy done on the swollen node under my R armpit and it came
back positive for MCC so no sentinel node biopsy will be necessary. I
am going back to Seattle for all day appts on next tuesday to be
followed with surgery on wed including a wide margin excision of the
original tumor location plus an axial node dissection of R arm and
chest. This will be followed by 5 or 6 weeks of radiotherapy.

I'm not excited about all of this but in retrospect I am glad I did
not have the planned Mohs surgery done as I am sure the node was
already involved and having the Mohs done would have been pointless.

I was very impressed by Dr Neighm and his entire team. I was a little
suprised that in a city as big as Seattle that they were not able to
get me a PET scan scheduled as promptly as I really needed but my
local oncologist stepped up and we had a head to toe PET done today in
Portland. If we had not been able to get this PET done promptly my
surgery would have been knocked back at least another week or more
because they want to make sure there is not additional involvement
before doing any extensive surgery. If there is additional involvement
I take it that my treatment plans could change again.

The needle biopsy was no big deal at all and that was a pleasant
surprise. Another pleasant surprise was that we also had the privilege
of briefly meeting Rick and Diedre from this list who were also there
for evaluations.

best to all,     Tom C.

Tom C.,

This very much reminds me of my trip to see Dr. Nghiem and the subsequent
treatment plan to my left arm.  That was two years ago this last week and I
am now fully recovered and going strong.

I know you will be in the very best of hands for your surgery and recovery
and before you know it you will be posting about radiation therapy.

Tom,
I remember those biopsy's.  Your right... they were no big deal.
Now listen... if your going to be up here for that long, I'm sure you will have some needs.
We never force ourselves on anyone, but please note that we can be your &quot;family&quot; up here
if you need anything.
We too had the pleasure of meeting Rick and Diedre when they were here.  We commented it would have been nice to have you with us when we met for lunch.
So please keep us in mind when your up here.  We would be happy to help if we can.
Best of everything to you.  As I think you and Rick discovered with your visit to Dr N... your in good hands with him.
If you want my contact info, write back and I will get it to you offline.

Hi Marty and Deb,

Thanks very much for the offer. One reason I did not contact you
earlier is that our situation is complicated by the fact that my wife
and I are 24/7 caretakers of my MIL who is 90+ and has had vascular
dementia for 15 years. She is relatively healthy and pleasant for 90+
but has zero memory, zero life coping skills and requires lots of
close supervision. Thankfully she does not ever wander and sleeps much
of the time so it is safe to leave her in a hotel (along with a half
dozen notes reminding her to our whereabouts) for 6 or 8 hrs or even
longer depending on time of day or night. If things get too
complicated with this situation we are planning on putting her on a
plane to Denver to stay with her son for a while. We've taken care of
her for a long time and now function as her complete memory and
support system so she is very dependent on us.

Marty and Deb,  with all this said, we would still very much enjoy
meeting you in person and going to dinner some night. I just wanted
you to know why I had not already contacted you about getting together
before now. You can send me your contact info privately to the
waterbored email and I'll give you my cell # and local contact info.

At this point in time I am not planning on staying in Seattle for the
five or six weeks of radiotherapy. It seems to me that axial node
radiotherapy would be a pretty straightforward radiation technique
that would be used for many types of cancer treatment. I live about a
mile from my oncologist office and am thinking about having the
radiotherapy done there. I have already discussed this with my
oncologist and he assures me that his radiation oncologist is top
notch and has treated MCC both in the past and recently. When I
mentioned to Dr P (the radiation oncologist in Seattle) that I might
want to have my radiotherapy done locally, he told me that in Seattle
they had the most MCC expertise and I agree with him but this is a
technical procedure and as long as he was not keeping trade secrets I
would imagine that any excellent radiation oncologist could follow his
protocols, especially if Dr P was seeing me often when I had follow-up
appts with Dr Neighm.  I am a home loving guy and really like the idea
of having the radiotherapy five minutes from my house. Living five
weeks in a motel for 30 minutes of daily radiotherapy would be very
mentally taxing, especially if I did not feel well.  I would
appreciate any comments as to why my thinking might be wrong or any
input on this subject that might be helpful to me.

Side note - We used our main credit card only to pay for our hotel
bill in Seattle and used either cash or a different credit cards for
small purchases like dinners, etc. A couple hours after we returned
home I got a call from the credit card Fraud division and someone -
apparently at the hotel - lifted my CC# and was using it in Malaysia
to purchase jewelry and various other items. We immediately canceled
the card and did not lose any money but we were shocked that a card we
had only used once would be stolen and abused so quickly. I guess I
was lucky I went straight home so the Fraud people could contact me so
quickly and get the card killed.  Be careful out there - it's a
jungle.

best to all,     Tom C.

Tom C,

You have a lot on your plate these days.  Not only being a survivor
and undergoing treatment, both past and upcoming.  Plus being
subjected to fraud.  Fortunate your bank caught this.  Hopefully they
are like my bank and back your account one hundred percent.  Then to
add being a caretaker at home and on the recent trip.

I returned from Boston for my radiation therapy at home.  It did make
a big difference to be right here after each treatment.  I made sure
that Dr. Ng in Boston (a separate radiologist that had treated merkel
cell cancer, not to be confused with Dr. Nghiem) talked with the local
radiologist experts to set up the treatment plan.

Tom,

I have to agree with you on the decision to do your radiation therapy at
home. If one of the doctors could give you a reason why one or the other
techniques, equipment or doctors and technicians would make a difference,
then I might consider Seattle. And even then, I'd think strongly about it.

I appreciated having friends being my backup for times I was too tired to
get to the appointments. I appreciated sleeping in my own bed, and having my
own &quot;in-home pharmacy&quot; at my fingertips.

The idea of spending the first couple of weeks in Seattle, as a tourist who
had to detour to get some radiation appeals to me, but after that I'd rather
be at home. Good luck in whichever location you finally pick.

Hi group,

After last weeks appt with Dr N. I had a PET scan last friday in
Portland and FedExd the data disc to Seattle for monday AM review by
radiologists at SCCA in preparation for this week's tuesday appt. with
Dr N. and tentative surgery on wed. Unfortunately, as happens with
several hospitals in Portland, the SCCA facility' s radiology dept
could not read the proprietary software used to burn the PET scan
disc. This meant another day of delay in getting the PET scan read. On
Tuesday (day of my appt. with Dr N and supposed pre-surgery appts) the
PET scan showed potential uptake in liver that suggested liver
involvement. Ultrasound done later that day showed this area of
concern was a false artifact and liver appeared ok. That was great
news. Unfortunately the surgeon had canceled my dedicated surgery time
slot for my wed. surgery which was then postponed until at least next
week.

I thought about this for a while, decided additional delay was not
working for me and decided to rally the troops and plead my case for a
sooner surgery date. Dr N favored early surgery and we carried the
day. My surgery for wide margin excision and axial node dissection
takes place tomorrow instead of sometime in the next couple of weeks.

It's been a long couple of days. For a while I was tenetatively moved
up towards stage 3 but after the ultrasound I am now back to stage
two. The stress of this and the surgery being put off was devastating.
Then the new surgery date meant today was another long day of
hyperactivity and appts. Anyways, tomorrow is the day of my surgery
and I may be offline for a week while I recover.

Talk to everyone soon.     Tom C.

Tom,

Great work on rallying the troops to your defense. This is what everyone of
us needs to be aware of - that sometimes this maneuver is necessary.
Sometimes you are just another patient to the docs, and you are the ONLY
patient to you and your family. Firm and polite! I guess this is just
another example of the saying, &quot;Where there's a will, there's a way.&quot; Well
done.

And I sure know about the stress you're talking about. It is difficult, and
that's why we need to share the work with friends and loved ones whenever we
can.

Hope the surgery goes well for you, both physically (medically) and
emotionally.

Rich

Tom C.

I had a similar case of move up the surgical dates anxiety two years ago.
Was scheduled for a mid-morning surgery in Boston at Brigham and Womans
Hospital.  I have to say that they had a great facility and hospital
complex.  There were so many of us waiting with family members in a very
up-to-date waiting area that they were passing out the blinking light
saucers often used in family style eateries.  Due to my anxiety at the time
the surgeon had prescribed something to make me relax.  The mid-morning time
soon became early afternoon.  Then another delay moved everything up to
early evening.  Through all this my wife suggested I calm down and take
another premed pill.  After another hour the buzzer and flashing lights went
off and with this I flew over to the surgical desk/counter and declared, &quot;Do
me, Do me Now&quot; in a slight Governator voice.  The staff nurse was laughing
and declared that in twenty years no one had said that to her in the
hospital.

Having setup the group just a couple of days after surgery I also had my
camera in my hand through all this and when they rolled me into surgery one
of the staff peeled the small digital cam out of my hand as I was taking the
last photo.  Somewhere around 11:00 p.m. as I was coming to I was giving the
camera back.
