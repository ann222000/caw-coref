The day started simply enough. Church followed by a Youth Program Fundraiser
and Webelo Scout meeting found us talking to our riding buddies at ~3pm
about the sunny spring day and how great it would be to go for a ride. After
talking through our schedules for the rest of the day, we decided that we
could at least slip in an hour or so ride on the Warren Ponderosa.

So...for the lineup...

The Home Team
Suzuki DR350 S - Dad - KW
Honda XR 100 - #1 Son - WW -12
Yamaha TTR 90 - #2 Son - TW - 10

The Guest Bunch
Honda XR200 - Dad - AK
Honda XR80 - #1 Son - 12 -BK
Honda XR70 #2 Son - 9 -DK

The Home Track
6.5 Acres of terrain split almost 50/50 between rolling grassy hillsides and
TST Woods.

The younguns all have ~ 1 years worth of riding under the belt at this time
so we start off with about a 1/2 hour worth of free riding in the wide open
section of the yard while everyone gets the hang of riding a more crowded
than normal "track".  At the first break, the 2 youngest guys lit into  the
*mine's bigger than yours* contest......

DK to TW "Yeah, your motorcycle is a 90, but I think my bike is bigger than
yours because my seat is wider. TW "Is not...here get on mine, it's taller
than yours cause my daddy put on a shock extender and it's faster too" DK
"Nope, see I'm flat-footed on yours." TW "Well I'm flat-footed AND my knees
are bent sitting on yours".....and so the competition really begins  :-)

We saddled back up and I took them through a series of twists and turns
through what is the remnants of an old Xmas tree farm that used to occupy
the backside of our property and ultimately into the thick twisty TST in the
more heavily wooded areas for the next 30 minutes or so. The boys skills at
avoiding trees were a little lacking at first, but they soon picked up the
pace and started pushing us ever faster until the word got out that they all
wanted to get back into the open area and race.

The heat races were soon on and the dad's got to watch while the mini-me's
played several rounds of chase-the-monkey. Since our lot is surrounded on 2
sides by the main road that curves almost 180 degrees around the place and
the house sits on the back 1/3.....most of where they were riding is our
front yard. As such, we try to keep the damage to a minimum so as to not
piss off the groundskeeper (yours truly), but on this occasion I made an
exception. The gang was getting tired of the little plywood ramp and wanted
something a little more challenging. As it turns out, I had an entire row of
Raspberry bushes that didn't make it through the summer last year so that
conveniently left me a dirt strip ~ 6 ft wide by ~75 ft long to play in,
so.......out comes the Track Maintenance Vehicle TMV (Description in sig)
and dad goes to work building the triple (OK...it was really just a
single....and only about 2.5 feet tall at that, but you would have thought I
hung the moon!) They absolutely wore out that mound of earth and over the
rest of the day, I had to re-surface it at least 3 more times and each time
it got a little taller at the urgings of the 2 youngest riders. By the end
of the day we had maxed out at about 4 feet tall with a significantly
steeper approach than it was when we started. It was at this point that I
grabbed the camera and killed a pixel or three for posterity (Selected pics
on a.b.p.m.)

All in all a pretty fun day, big smiles all around, nobody got hurt,
everyone had raccoon eyes from the dust and it was a great motivator for the
remainder of the riding season. Our 2 local USFS OHV riding areas open next
weekend....guess where we'll be?
