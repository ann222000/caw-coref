Beyer exits mayoral race

22.08.2007

BY MATTHEW STEWART

Georgina Beyer has pulled out of the Carterton mayoral race, saying it
is time to move on from politics.

In June, the Times-Age reported Ms Beyer's intention to stand for the
Carterton mayoralty but since then the high-profile politician has
changed tack.

&quot;It's been an angsting decision but I think it's time to let go and
stand aside.&quot;

Ms Beyer, a former Labour MP for Wairarapa, began a year of political
flip-flops when she resigned from Parliament in February, after having
earlier said she would leave and then changing her mind.

Before putting her hand up for Carterton's top civic job she had
indicated a strong desire for the Wellington mayoralty, only to
rescind that desire and pull out again in May this year.

Ms Beyer said one of the factors weighing in the decision not to run
in the Carterton mayoralty was the apathy of her former constituents.

After a period of personal reflection she had &quot;sounded out&quot; the
Carterton community who were largely disinterested in her bid for a
third term as the town's mayor, she said.

Financially it was not possible to mount a genuine campaign and
anything less would be an insult to the Carterton constituency, she
said.

&quot;It would smack of arrogance to just put your name forward and then do
nothing,&quot; she said.

However, Ms Beyer said she is satisfied with her contribution to the
region and it is now time to explore a new life and career outside
elected office.

&quot;I've got to move on and I've made the break-- there will be people
who'll be disappointed,&quot; she said.

&quot;I've had 14 years of high-level elected representative politics for
Carterton and Wairarapa. I've made a good contribution-- I'd like to
think-- but there are some fresh faces around now who are coming
through,&quot; she said.

Ms Beyer, who has twice been the town's &quot;number one citizen&quot;, reached
the decision not to stand for Carterton again after some rhetorical
self-examination.

&quot;It's scary, why am I stepping into the abyss? Why have I left
Parliament? Is my commitment as good as it was?&quot; she said.

She also expressed reservations about incumbent Carterton Mayor Gary
McPhee, who now faces only one other opponent, Kerry Leighton in his
re-election bid.

&quot;Gary is popular on one level but is not necessarily winning
confidence. I don't think he knows yet how to engage with the
political process in Wellington,&quot; she said.

She wants to move her focus from elected politics to human rights, a
cause she advocated for, both in her time as Carterton's mayor and as
MP for Wairarapa in the capital.

Ms Beyer is turning 50 this year and said the time is right for
different challenges and that she still has a lot to offer the region
outside elected government.

&quot;I've got another two or three careers in me,&quot; she said.

&quot;I've been nurtured by two fine recent mayors in Bob Francis and John
Read   the three of us were very effective at having our voice heard
in the Wellington region,&quot; she said.

Mr Francis and Mr Read served as Masterton mayor and South Wairarapa
mayor respectively when Ms Beyer held the Carterton seat from 1995 to
2000.

Mr Read died suddenly last Monday and Mr Francis is due to step down
after 21 years as Masterton's mayor   two events that have influenced
Ms Beyer's decision to opt out of local politics.

&quot;I had two very experienced men as colleagues on either side. We were
a good collegial group, we were united for Wairarapa when it was
necessary,&quot; she said.

Coming back home to Carterton after resigning from Parliament as a
Labour list MP in February has been &quot;grounding&quot;, she said.

&quot;I've had positive reflections on who I am and my background.&quot;

She heaped praise on Wairarapa's voters: &quot;They are salt-of-the-earth,
upfront, honest people who have a strong bond and a sense of reliance
on each other in times of hardship,&quot; she said.

Her internationally-reported foray into local body politics came &quot;out
of left field&quot;, she said

&quot;Who elected me? Conservative people, by and large, in a rural
electorate. I was upfront about who and what I was -- they like a bit
of chutzpah -- there was a reciprocation of loyalty,&quot; she said.

As the world's first transexual mayor, Ms Beyer said she &quot;certainly
broke the glass ceiling and from then on my conduct, politically, was
under immense scrutiny   I had to set a standard for conduct which
earned respect as opposed to being ridiculed or laughed at or having
people whisper behind my back.

&quot;I got elected legitimately, fairly, squarely and it was all properly
done,&quot; she said.

Ms Beyer said she would like to stay in Wairarapa but has to consider
future job options that could mean a shift to Wellington or Auckland.

Nominations for local body elections close at noon on Friday.
