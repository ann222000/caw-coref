In a previous post by CoolHandDuke TheBlueDevilMan, from 8/14/01 he
states that:

" Manufacturers typically install cameras free of charge in exchange
for a
percentage of fine revenues -- a very lucrative arrangement.  In
Arizona and
Oregon, camera manufacturers and bureaucrats went as far as decreasing
yellow
times on some traffic signals in order to increase violations. "

Anyone know where I can find documentation of this?

This thread caught my eye but I was disappointed that it wasn't about
red-light districts ;-)

I flew into San Diego last Thurs and my dad picked me up at the airport.
Leaving Pac Hiway he nosed into the left turn and stopped over the line and
the camera flashed. he says "I just got a ticket"!. I thought about it, and
it's a new car without plates. No ticket! I told him we needed to get some
Hillary masks and run every camera light in town.
