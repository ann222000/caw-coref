The Known World of Zines Now 1,000 Times Larger

CHICAGO - Feb. 12, 2007 - ZineWiki.com, a Web site devoted to zines,
independent publications and their publishers, reached 1,000 articles
in the first week of February, just seven months after the project
first launched.

ZineWiki was created by Alan Lastufka and Kate Sandler to document the
vibrant underground publishing world. The result has been an ever-
growing guide to fanzines, chapbooks, zines and small-press publishers
which The Portland Mercury said "could herald a new era of zines."
Karl Wenclas, co-founder of the Underground Literary Alliance, has
called ZineWiki "a sign of new life."

Like Wikipedia, ZineWiki is an open-source database welcoming
contributions from anyone, and striving for neutrality and accuracy.
There now are hundreds of contributers. "It's been great seeing so
many people stepping up and contributing. Each person has his or her
own area of focus, favorite genres or zinesters, to add or revise,"
Lastufka commented, "I've learned so much just from editing the
articles others have submitted."

Added Sandler, "ZineWiki is an online window into an offline world. It
offers people a glimpse at the undercurrent of print publications that
otherwise go undocumented."

In September 2006, the Chicago-based print magazine Punk Planet
partnered with ZineWiki.com to offer exclusive online content
including the article, "Unofficial Histories: Zine and Ephemeral Print
Archivists," by Anne Elizabeth Moore. Other media sponsors have
included Clamor Magazine and Broken Pencil magazine. SuperNaturale.com
said, "As it grows, it's conceivable that ZineWiki could even act as a
universal central catalog for zine librarians."

its writers, culture and publications, ZineWiki provides an overall
view of the underground publishing world. While hitting 1,000 articles
is a big step for ZineWiki, there is much more to come from this
growing and exciting Web site.
