Hard to believe this was on Al Jazeera, but it seems that it is, albeit not
for long......

What a power house of a woman!  A must hear !

WATCH THIS BEFORE IT'S TAKEN OFF THE WEB!!

One impressive woman

Here is a powerful and amazing statement on Al Jazeera television.

The woman is Wafa Sultan, an Arab-American psychologist from Los Angeles. I
would suggest watching it ASAP because I don't know how long the link will
be active. This film clip should be shown around the world repeatedly!

This woman appears to be a Secular Humanist and a progressive-minded
person and I agree with everything she says.
But I don't thing she represent your side, your side is really with
the hate-filled, intolerant and backward peoples of the Middle East.
Xenophobes and radical Islam are promoting the same kind of ideology
which is one of hate and intolerance for other cultures, races and
religions.

Do bear in mind the *Source* of this clip - MEMRI[1] which is hardly an
objective source of information.

*ALL* fundamentalists clinging to Middle Eastern Bronze Age religious
superstitions and desiring to kill or convert anyone who does not agree
with them.

Currently Islam is the worst of that bunch because of oil and the
trillions of dollars pumped into that part of the world the past 40 years.

[1]MEMRI = Middle East Media Research Institute, an Israeli propaganda
organ.

Do you realize how brave this woman is? Do you realize there are probably
THOUSANDS of muslims who would kill her for this without a SECOND thought?
Does anyone remember the bounty put on Salmon Rushie's head?

Great video icon. Thanks. I'm going to try to find out who this woman is.

Did you notice there's NO WAY to save a copy of this video? Usually when you
play
videos in Windows Media Player you have the option to save a copy, but not
with this
one.

A note about the source of that streaming (not savable via ordinary means)
video:

CastUP is a leading developer and service provider of global IP Video
streaming solutions. Founded in 1999 by a group of experienced IT
professionals with a goal to make IP based video accessible to all.
The company grew steadily and today holds 90% market share of the evolving
Israeli market. Supporting multiple video-streaming standards, CastUP
products and services are the first choice for many market leading
companies in various industries. We enable fast and responsive solutions
for almost every need related to streaming media.

CastUP R&amp;D and corporate headquarters are based in Tel Aviv.

And the very best propaganda is fact-based. :)

Why are you calling this video propaganda? Why is it
propaganda at all?

Of course, if you're a pro-muslim fanatic the truth is all
propaganda isn't it?

It's interesting that you invalidate the messenger instead
of the message.

If you can show me somewhere else I can get translations
of Arabic news programs I'd be willing to go there, if you
can't, or won't STFU.

You mean the purveyor of the message; I do believe Wafa Sultan was on

published / translated by someone who doesn't have any skin in the Middle
Eastern game.

Something that works in MEMRI's favor is that there aren't all that many
(percentage wise) Arabic/English speakers in the USA.
I wish I could find a Christian or non-religious Arab to check the
translation but I currently don't know any.
