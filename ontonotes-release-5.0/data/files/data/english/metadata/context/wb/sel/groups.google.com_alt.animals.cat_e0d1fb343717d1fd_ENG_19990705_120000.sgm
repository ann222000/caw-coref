Erica;

I use this recipe often, and it was approved of greatly by my veterin-
arian:
1 cup boiled chicken, beef or fish
1 tbsp. vegetable oil
2 vitamin-mineral tablets, crushed with food mallet (I use
'Favor,' which is a product of Smith Kline Beecham) and is
available in most pet provision stores.
OPTIONAL is 1 egg yolk to improve your cat's coat, if it is
not slick and shiny.

Blend all of the above together thoroughly.
It should be adequate for four servings.

My cats love this home-made recipe.
