Hi at all

I'ld like to make different values of the position and top property one per
browser.

I.e.

duv#fixed{

position:fixed !important; //firedfox

top:30%; //firefox

left:25%; //firefox

position:relative; /MSIE

top:-200px; //msie

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
}
">

How can I do to apply the top:-200; only to MSIE and the top:25% only to FF
or the left:30% only to FF?

Best regards

Then stop wanting that. It's a disgusting perversion and you should be
ashamed, not talking about it in public.

If you _think_ that you need it, because otherwise &quot;browsers show
things too differently&quot;, then you're addressing the wrong problem.

* If you do things right, they won't vary too much (for typical
requirements requested of typical browsers)

* If they do still vary, that's not a big deal. The user context
(screen size, user defaults, OS, even the browser) will all affect
things to some small extent. We have to work around this by being
&quot;fluid&quot; with our designs and producing pages that &quot;work&quot; in these
different contexts, not trying to slavishly maintain an unachievable
and fundamentally pointless narrow consistency.

If you still insist, then use IE conditional comments (JFGI). They're
the cleanest of the ugly hacks for achieving this.

It is very likely you are fixing the wrong problem by doing this. You
need to resolve the cause of the positioning difference instead.

Are you triggering quirks mode in IE, which causes it to use a broken
box model and mangle positioning? We can't know, or suggest a better
solution, without seeing the web page in question.

Post a URL. Do not post code.

That's like telling some browsers to sit in the back of the bus.

Are you talking about that sliding popup they use to get you to download
something? It done with JavaScript really. If you want to do it,
download their script.

Take care,

If you want to do what they do on that page, then do as Mr Little says
and download their script.

If you have made your own attempt at it, then post the URL for that page
and maybe we can help you with your code. If you can't do that, then we
can't help you.
