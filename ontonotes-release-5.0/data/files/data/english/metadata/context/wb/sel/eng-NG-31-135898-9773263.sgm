Here is the text of the latest AMD 8-K filing with the SEC:-

&quot;Item 2.06  Material Impairments

On December 6, 2007, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (theCompany)
concluded that the current carrying value of its goodwill which the
Company had recorded as a result of its October 2006 acquisition of
ATI Technologies Inc. was impaired. This conclusion was reached based
on the results of an updated long-term financial outlook for the
businesses of the former ATI Technologies Inc. as part of the
Company’s strategic planning cycle conducted annually during the
Company’s fourth quarter and based on the preliminary findings of the
Company’s annual goodwill impairment testing that commenced in the
beginning of October 2007.

The Company expects that the impairment charge will be material, but
the Company has determined that, as of the time of this filing, it is
unable in good faith to make a determination of an estimate of the
amount or range of amounts of the impairment charge. The Company will
file an amended report on Form 8-K/A under this Item 2.06 promptly and
in any event within 4 business days after it makes a determination of
such an estimate or range of estimates. &quot;

==================================
Finally AMD has publicly admitted its blunder in offering too much for
ATi... The offer for ATi shares was 20% premium over market - a share
price of $20 for a stock that had been hovering in the doldrums
between $12 and $16 for the previous year. The real blunder was buying
them at all on several $biillion borrowed money. It has
catastrophically diverted AMDs attention from its core business. Core
2 had started shipping and garnering rave reviews a month before the
stockholder's meeting to finally ratify the purchase, so AMD could see
the lion's gaping mouth and had the opportunity to back out of the
deal. Seems as if Hector's ego got the better of common-sense.

AMD stock price has slumped to $8.64 this morning.  AMD share price
at the time of the ATi acquisition was ~ $25.

Dave Orton must be giggling all the way to the bank.

2008 will be a very interesting make-or-break year for AMD.

And I just read that AMD promises to fix all the quad core
problems ?????????  They need some kid to just sit on
the net and read all the screaming and yelling that went
on with ATI warranties back in the good old days when
you had to psych out just what an ATI warranty meant
depending on who you bought the card from. It went
from 15 days to 1 year to 3 years to 5 years .. for the
exact same card. That was when nVidia took their market
away from them by simply doing good business with
the buyers. ATI , the company, was just plain arrogant.
And AMD bought THAT ?????  I was amazed when I
first read it. And now this is no surprise at all.

And it is exactly why all of my builds have been Intels
since that time. None of us &quot;low level&quot; employees are
buying AMD anymore .... and we run the world.

It was a calculated risk, which they are hoping to cash in on starting in
2008.  Intel was beating them in the multi-core race - even if AMD's
approach was technically better, it's usually fist to market wins.  So AMD
needed another avenue to pursue along with the CPU battle.  If and when they
can get a fully integrated CPU/GPU system put together, they could quickly
come to dominate many of the mobile applications out there, which was one of
the less talked about but major reason for the acquisition in the first
place.  Considering that the mobile market is one of the fastest growing
tech sectors, AMD basically put a whole bunch of eggs into one basket.  If
they can come through with the CPU and GPU on one die combination, the
increased optimization and massive power savings would throw them into a
leading position in the mobile computing business...

As you said, 2008 will definitely be a nail-biter for many...  I'm
personally hoping AMD pulls through, the competition keeps Intel on their
toes and off the &quot;jack up prices just cause we can&quot; parade.

Competition is needed within the industry, and I also want to see them
succeed, but they have to stand on their own by building a competitive
product. I just bought a Pentium 6850 and Asus motherboard. It's the
first non-AMD CPU I've purchased since the advent of the first
Athlon's.

If they build the product they should be building, they won't need

I'm sure they could do that right now. Trouble is, when you're already
dealing with cooling problems with just the CPU or GPU separately, the
only way to combine them is to power down, which pretty much defeats
the purpose in the first place.

If you ask me, the first company to make end-user-upgradeable CPU's
and GPU's mainstream on laptops will pretty much rule that market,
outside the business sector at least.

I remember when  (before Athlons) Intel was the standard CPU
and if you wanted to save some money you could buy the
cheaper (price and some thought quality) AMD CPU. I never
considered AMD as good as an Intel until the Athlon's came
out, then AMD seemed to have the upper hand on performance
and price. Maybe AMD will just have to be the cheaper CPU
for a while and hope that people will see them as the other
lower cost choice rather than useless and doomed.

Oh they were competitive long before that.
Dad had a Intel 386 DX 33, I had an AMD 386 DX 40, and mine was faster
(not the huge jumps that came later, but still faster.)

Move up to the pentium, and a friend of mine who was not terribly
computer literate bought (without asking for advice) a pentium 200,
while I bought an AMD K6-233.  For $100 less I got a processor that beat
his in all tests (the extra 33MHz canceled out Intel's better floating
point performance.)

Likewise, even if AMD comes out with a better processor, I won't buy
CPUs from AMD until they design and manufacture their own chipsets. I
know the situation has remarkably improved but I still find chipsets
for AMD lacking in stability when compared to Intel.

Yes. If you truly want to help in PC evolution, the best you can do is
to indiscriminately judge products by their performance/price and buy
whichever one fits the bill. We'll all be taking one big step
backwards if our purchases are biased by company loyalty or sympathy
businesses. As a large group, by making objective purchases, we can
make our demands heard and pressure tech companies to continue R&amp;D
more aggressively than ever.

I'll never ever forget my first experience with an AMD processor. I
bought a system that had an AMD K5 100 CPU in it. It had a PR (Pentium
Rating) of 133 so it was technically one of the fastest chip on offer
at the time. It was an AST Advantage Home Multimedia machine. Very
well made and nice and smooth with Windows 95 on it.

I was really looking forward to playing MDK2 at last. Imagine my
horror when the game wouldn't install because it recognised my CPU as
486 DX- architecture. It wouldn't even install because it needed a
&quot;Pentium Class CPU&quot; to run on.

Back then I think it was the FPU benchmarks that caused non Intel 5x86
class chips to be recognised as 4x86. I had the same problem with a
Cyrix 120 MHZ CPU.

I never did play MDK2 even though I did buy a Pentium based machine a
few months later.

This is when AMD really started giving Intel a run for their money if
I remember correctly. I had great service out of 1GHZ Thunderbird and
then an Athlon 2100+. I've had several Athlons since then too. I've
still got 3  working PC's in the house based on those chips.

It's Intel for me at the moment though. They seem to offer the best
performance to cost ratio. I've had an ATi graphics card for the last
3 years but at the moment it looks like Nvidia is going to supply my
first ever DX-10 card.

I really hope that AMD's acquisition of ATi doesn't turn out for the
worse. We need them to keep the market place competitive. I don't have
any have any allegiance to any vendor, I just want whatever delivers
the best performance for the kind of money that I can afford. The idea
of a competitive market place seems to be completely lost on the
&quot;fanboy&quot; types that enjoy gloating when a rival vendor runs into
trouble.

Mine was going from a P166 to a K6-2 300 for something like half the
price of an Intel 300 and it completely rocked in Unreal. I don't
think I ever had any negative experiences with my AMD based systems.
Have defected back to Intel with the C2D's though!

&gt;Cyrix 120 MHZ CPU.

&gt;I never did play MDK2 even though I did buy a Pentium based machine a
&gt;few months later.

&gt;&gt;Move up to the pentium, and a friend of mine who was not terribly
&gt;&gt;computer literate bought (without asking for advice) a pentium 200,
&gt;&gt;while I bought an AMD K6-233.  For $100 less I got a processor that beat
&gt;&gt;his in all tests (the extra 33MHz canceled out Intel's better floating
&gt;&gt;point performance.)

&gt;This is when AMD really started giving Intel a run for their money if
&gt;I remember correctly. I had great service out of 1GHZ Thunderbird and
&gt;then an Athlon 2100+. I've had several Athlons since then too. I've
&gt;still got 3  working PC's in the house based on those chips.

Dittoish; k6 to a .7GHz Duron, then to a 1.4GHZ athlon, then up to an
athlon 64 2800, which is where I'm at now.

Yeah all the benchmarking does seem to show Intel pretty solidly ahead
of AMD these days.

Some day soon I'll probably build another system, which is going to have
to be mostly new from the ground up since neither the ram nor the AGP

Then I'll have to find room for a 3rd machine on my desk.

Indeed, Intel's prices were pretty massive gouging until AMD got
competitive with them.
I don't fancy the price jump if Intel stays well ahead.

AMD's purchase of ATi is eerily familiar to 3DFX's purchase - I hope
they don't end up having the same fate.

You are indeed right. It was MDK and it needed a P90 minimum to run. I
never played it even though I still own the copy that I bought way
back when I learn that lesson the hard way.

It wasn't an overdrive chip though. It was a proper CPU in it's own
right. I do remember the Overdrive chips though and knew a few people
that bought them and regretted it.

I also remember lusting after a &quot;blisteringly fast&quot; P200 system and
not being able to afford it. I think my first Pentium beyond the
200mhz mark was a 233MHZ MMX system. That was actually rather good and
lasted me several years. I played POD on it until my eyes were red
raw.

The next major jump for me was a PII 400MHZ complete with a supposedly
breathtakingly fast 32MB RagePro AGP card complimented by 2 x Voodoo 2
cards utilising SLI.

I remember being all excited because one of the free games I got with
it was &quot;G-Police&quot; which was supposed to be a game optimised for AGP.
It also had &quot;Incoming&quot; which was heralded as being the same new
fangled thing. It was also the first PC that I owned that had a DVD
ROM drive with it.

Those were the days. Back then 400MHZ was way more power than anything
could utilise. For about a whole week anyway.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If ATI/AMD go under you
&gt;guys will get everything you asked for &amp; deserve.
">

Really, are you trying to heap a bunch of guilt on the innocent, when
AMDs present predicament is **ALL** AMD's management fault??

No customer asked for this situation with regard to AMD. My last
personal PC build was an AMD 4400+ ( and a nV 7800GTX, fyi), my very
first AMD processor-build and it has proven to be the most stable of
my home-built PCs. I was extremely pleased with my choice of AMD
**then**  (October 2005) - they were OBVIOUSLY **both** the price and
technology-leader at that time in both server and desktop CPUs.

However, my next desktop build will be either a quad-core Penryn or a
Q6600, since Phenom Quad ( even after their so-called B3 mask-fix for
the disastrous TLB problem) neither has the performance nor the
cache size that I require ( mucho video-processing and encoding ).

In my spare time I track (and invest in) technology stocks. About 3
months before the AMD merger was proposed, I speculatively bought some
ATi stock, because it was pretty obvious then that the company was not
going anywhere fast and they were likely to become an acquisition
target.They had broken even for the first time about a year earlier
but profitability was still marginal and meanwhile nVidia was rolling
in the cash. I also held AMD stock and AMD was still on the up and up.
Then the announcement came that AMD was proposing to acquire ATi...
and borrow substantial cash to do so.  I was instantly horrified...
ERROR..ERROR...ERROR...   Sure I was going to make an immediate 20%
premium on my ATi holdings, but I had the vision of AMD and two giant
millstones  -- poor-performing ATi and a huge debt-load . Compounding
my horror. Intel had just released the first Core2 chips to rave
reviews. So, I said to myself  &quot;AMD can still back out of this deal
since the stockholder's meeting that would finally ratify the deal is
in a couple of months time&quot;. Dutifully voted &quot;no&quot; on my tiny holdings.
Nope, didn't happen. So I promptly sold both my ATi stock and AMD
stock (~ $25) and short-sold a whole bunch more AMD stock.

At the time of the acquisition I posted to this newsgroup and/or the
&quot;action&quot; newsgroup,  and other forums my (horrified) opinions of this
marriage made in hell. Now that the marriage is  obviously
fully-consummated , Orton and other ex-ATi principals have exited the
AMD/ATi organization with bags of cash leaving Hector and Co, truly
holding the BAG. That sale (er, merger) was the best techno con-job of
2006, imho....

And the diversion of financial resources from AMDs CPU development to
finance their gigantic $2billion loan probably has a lot to do with
(a) the late introduction of Barcelona/Phenom (b) the shorting of QC
that probably resulted in the TLB problem being missed.

Also, please note that Intel's approach to their business over the
past year has been the exact opposite of AMD - Intel has been selling
off or closing down marginal businesses and excising a bunch of
personnel bloat in their core operations.... ~ 10,000 employees
world-wide when all the trimming is finished.

If you want to see how another company on your (emotional)  'no-buy
list' approaches their product development, read the paragraph headed
&quot;nVidia&quot; from the following article, coincidentally highly relevant to
the current AMD discussion:-

http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/12/14/update_who_wants_to_buy_amd_/

BTW, I suspect that the management of nV have no intention of buying
that debt-saddled mess called AMD/ATi anywhere in the immediate
future. Jen-Hsun Huang is far too wily for that. If I were he, I would
stand aside and let the AMD/ATi melt-down continue and cherry-pick the
embers, especially the best of the ATi graphics talent. nV are far too
focussed on their graphics and their rapidly-expanding
workstation-acceleration business.. They are re-investing pots of
money in next-gen GPU/GPGPU hardware. I doubt if they want to throw
any of that money into the AMD/ATi melting-pot.  If I were a bright
ATi graphics engineer, I sure would be putting out some feelers to nV
right now. I suspect that development budgets within AMD/ATi are very
tight indeed  - not much room for creativity, just try to milk as much
money as possible and as soon as possible out of variants of current
architectures.

Unfortunately all of the Barcelona and Phenom families of products are
based on the same architecture with little performance gain over
Opteron after ~3 more years of development. And compounding the pain,
process-partner IBM failed to come up with a competitive
silicon-process for high-volume-manufacturing of K10.  Where is IBMs
45nm process?? IBM has a VERY long and chronic history of problems
transitioning new silicon-processes into high-volume manufacturing.

I don't know if they can afford to.  AMD was competive for a long time
largely because Intel make a big mistake with Pentium 4.  AMD was able
to coast with only minor improvements to it's product, while Intel
stubornly stuck with the Pentium 4.  AMD is going to need to invest a
lot money of they're going come up with something better than Intel's
Core 2 processors.  The merger hurt ATI, they lost market share as
the result of delayed products.  ATI will probably survive one way or
another even if AMD as whole failed, but ATI has definately lost value
since being aquired.

&gt;I snipped most of it, but everyone should get a look at the parent post. It was
&gt;a good read. I think your instincts regarding the tech market are basically
&gt;sound, but I have a few possibilities to add.

&gt;I strongly suspect the &quot;consumer desktop&quot; market is in its death throes. The
&gt;future is mobile devices, laptops and smaller, and if AMD/ATi can serve up

&gt;slimlines for business, again lending itself to a unified/cheap platform,
&gt;rather than discrete/performance based markets. Maybe some MS Surfaces. Who
&gt;knows? I do know that the huge boxes are out. Even the server rooms have slim
&gt;rack-mounts.

&gt;To wit, none of the kids in my neighborhood (save my own) know what to do with
&gt;a desktop, nor want such a monolithic dinosaur. The enormous CRT display is no
&gt;longer marketable with TFT monitors the standard, and without a huge monitor to
&gt;weigh it down, the &quot;desktop&quot; has little reason to exist. Only bleeding edge
&gt;gamers who demand robust cooling need it, which leads to suspicion #2.

&gt;I think the expensive consoles are the future of the current &quot;computer gaming&quot;
&gt;market. The lighter-weight Wii is in the segment of what used to be the
&gt;&quot;console market.&quot; There is no room for the PC here. The 360 is a limited
&gt;success, that Microsoft wants to build on, because it will help them deliver
&gt;stable business products to the desktop, without the games mess.

&gt;Games is a cock-up for business software.

&gt;They tried to sell it with Vista, and it's graphics &quot;Wow.&quot; Vista is &quot;adequate,&quot;
&gt;and hardly recommends the mid to high-end platform as a result. The desktop is
&gt;in trouble. The laptop/slimline/thin client is all that's necessary to that
&gt;end. Display advances will only make it clear that we don't need to house the
&gt;main computer inside something the size of a step-stool.

&gt;Intel will do fine in the server markets, of course. Intel is in good shape
&gt;because they are the performance leader, and there will always be performance
&gt;needs. They build their own graphics chips. Enthusiasts also will build
&gt;high-end machines with Intel for the near future.

&gt;But where does that leave NVidia? The PS 3 looks (to me) like a market failure.
&gt;ATi makes the chips for the established consoles, and is therefore has *value*.
&gt;NVidia makes the best high end discrete graphics cards for a diminishing
&gt;market, and for a console that looks very much like 3rd place in a two-horse
&gt;race.

&gt;NVidia's future may lie with that Playstation 3.

&gt;Finally, the PC does not make enough sufficient money for the AAA players. They
&gt;are all hedging their bets towards consoles, or exiting the PC market entirely.
&gt;Burdensome protection schemes are also killing the market, when the console DRM
&gt;is automatic, assumed and &quot;easy&quot; for anyone who doesn't mod their box. When
&gt;large publishers have such control over a platform, why produce for one where
&gt;people can grab a torrent? Why bother at all with the lot of us?

&gt;Nvidia, despite superior technology and their vaunted &quot;The Way It's Meant To Be
&gt;Played&quot; tagline, looks very much like a niche market, buggy whip manufacturer.

&gt;The only question is will AMD/ATi pull itself together to produce future value?
&gt;It is a huge question, given AMD's processor troubles. If they can't, Intel
&gt;wins big and NVidia gets to renegotiate for better market position, as ATi gets
&gt;brought down in the ensuing meltdown. It's too early to call. If AMD succeeds
&gt;in capturing the mobile/thin markets, and continues to dominate future
&gt;consoles, and that is very much in question, NVidia is in trouble.

&gt;At that point, they'll have few people to sell to and will have to use that
&gt;capital to change biz strategy and find markets. I don't think they're being
&gt;&quot;clever,&quot; I think they're quaking in their boots and praying for that meltdown.

&gt;So currently, I find that NVidia is in a remarkably shaky position, despite
&gt;their superior technology and capital position.

&gt;My 2 cents. I'd love to know what you think. I don't invest.

&gt;But I strongly suspect that the consumer desktop, barring some unforseen killer
&gt;app require robust cooling of components, is a goner.

Gaming is nVidia's technological test-bed. Not their core focus,
which is much, much wider. You may have noticed that gaming is the
computer technology that has pushed bleeding-edge graphics for many,
many years. Support for gaming has given nVidia a broad base for
testing and advancing their technology. Of course they do sell a
million or so extreme high-end (8800-class) GPUs per year and several
million SLI-capable motherboard chip-sets. They are also heavily into
providing graphics engines for consumer-products besides PS3s.
However, they also have a rapidly-growing business in high-end
workstations supporting both state-of-the-art graphics and parallel
math-processing. This is a extremely  high-profit-margin business !!
And they own it. Of the workstation graphics business currently, nV
owns 86%, ATi 14% and Intel is nowhere to be seen.  Their CUDA toolset
is currently being used by academics and 3rd-party developers to
harness their GPUs to vastly accelerate complex math processing. And
there is an insatiable demand for faster and faster math-processing
directly in workstations and small servers. The need to queue big jobs
for a Cray is anathema to many researchers. nV intends to own that
market regardless of Intel's vaporware mouthing on multi-multicore
processors.  Being actively involved and helping solve real problems
right now  is x100 better than all the paper projections from Intel
and others.

Take note of the mnemonic 'GPGPU' (General Purpose GPU). In 2008,
you are likely to hear a lot from nVidia  with regard to new product
introductions seamlessly merging that technology with the traditional
GPU.

The problem for ATi in going after integrated lap-tops etc is that it
is a very low-margin business in direct competition with Intel. And
since ATi is now part of Intel's direct CPU competitor, I guarantee
that Intel will make life in that business as difficult as possible.
And nVidia also has the financial stability to deliberately make life
very difficult for them should they so choose to get involved as well.
AMD/ATi is caught in a nutcracker with &quot;Intel&quot; stamped on one jaw and
&quot;nVidia&quot; stamped on the other.

AMD/ATi's big problem these days is &quot;how do we recover our development
costs&quot;. Traditionally that is recovered by designing a unique
high-demand product at the head of a family with plenty of opportunity
for spin-offs (eg:  Core2, iPhone, nV8800 etc) that holds market sway
and a price-premium for a significant period of time. However, between
Intel and nVidia,  AMD/ATi has not been able to set any price premiums
ever since the double-whammy of the Core2 familiy of CPUs  and the
nV88xx familiy of GPUs.

There's nothing wrong with debt, so long as you don't over-capitalise.
Someone at AMD must have thought ATI worth the investment. Just because
things haven't gone to plan doesn't mean it was a bad decision at the

I'm not familiar with the wheelings &amp; dealings, but it made sense at the
time, given Intel's continued bedding with NVidia. The whole problem
from my reading of the news has been AMD not channeling enough resources
&amp; money into GPU chipsets on the ATI side after the takeover. Sure, they
were already slightly behind on cpus after the C2D range (mind you, I
think it's all hype mostly anyway, typical Intel); even stunts like
PS3.0, which is a complete wank imo, affected the buying sheep to
gravitate towards NVidia instead of ATI (biggest example of a consumer
marketing fuck-over I've seen in years!). Anyway, my emotion only comes
into it *after* I've examined the facts. And the facts of how Intel &amp;
NVidia have done 'business' over the last few years raises my hackles
enough to stick with the competition until they become utterly useless,
which we're not quite at that stage as yet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And the diversion of financial resources from AMDs CPU development to
&gt; finance their gigantic $2billion loan probably has a lot to do with
&gt; (a) the late introduction of Barcelona/Phenom (b) the shorting of QC

&gt; Also, please note that Intel's approach to their business over the
&gt; past year has been the exact opposite of AMD - Intel has been selling
&gt; off or closing down marginal businesses and excising a bunch of
&gt; personnel bloat in their core operations.... ~ 10,000 employees
&gt; world-wide when all the trimming is finished.

I bet those 10K human beings love to hear themselves called 'bloat'.
This isn't the public service you know. Companies who change their
agendas &amp; structures year to year with no regard for individuals, their

their cpu runs 10% faster than the competitor's who's trying to do the
right thing in spite of the bottom line. I guess you probably won't

&gt; I snipped most of it, but everyone should get a look at the parent post. It was
&gt; a good read. I think your instincts regarding the tech market are basically
&gt; sound, but I have a few possibilities to add.

&gt; I strongly suspect the &quot;consumer desktop&quot; market is in its death throes. The
&gt; future is mobile devices, laptops and smaller, and if AMD/ATi can serve up
&gt; unified products to meet the synergy hype, while Intel and NVidia lord their
&gt; leadership in what is becoming a dead platform. It is especially grave for
&gt; NVidia, because they sell an &quot;enthusiast&quot; product.
">

I'm pretty much inclined to agree with you on this point, more's the
pity. However, having seen my new sysdamin's $4K+ Macbook Pro running
stuff, from several OSs he virtualises to 3D games to whatnot, it's hard
to see the specialist market for desktops going on indefinitely. We'll
all just have to make do with 'previous-gen' vidcards for a generation
or so &amp; then we'll all be caught up! :) If only the battery lifetimes
were not so shitty. heh.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Don't count ATi out yet on the DX-10 front, particularly if you are looking
at low- to mid-range cards...  I've been hearing great things about their
new HD 3850, which comes with an HD decoder, Shader 4.1 and DX-10.1 support
(which the 8800GT lacks)...  And draws quite a bit less power than the HD
2900 (from what I understand, haven't seen the actual numbers on this yet).
Drawing less power is a trend I'd love to see, I'm tired of seeing cards
that are just throwing gobs of power to the GPU and basically requiring you
to rewire your house with heavier circuits just to be able to run the power
supplies needed to drive your new &quot;cutting edge&quot; gaming rig...  In these
days of smaller cheaper lighter faster with being &quot;green&quot; so important, it's
so funny watching the video card companies throw &quot;green&quot; out the window.

Anyhow, I've always been an nVidia user, and for serious bleeding-edge
graphics power, they still can't seem to be beat...  But it looks like ATi
is at least getting out of the starting gate, let's hope they keep improving
and keep nVidia on their toes.  AMD could use the revenue :-)

You obviously haven't been paying close attention to the laptop market these
days...  Dell has their XPS line of gaming notebooks, Alienware has thrived
on mobile gaming platforms, ASUS and a slew of other manufactures too
numerous to mention have serious mobile gaming rigs...  nVidia just released
their 8800 mobile series GPU for gaming on the go...

Hell, I can play all but the super bleeding-edge games on my
middle-of-the-line Dell Inspiron (but mainly because I went for the nVidia
GPU option), and have been playing MMOs like City of Heroes and the like for
years into the wee hours of the mornings while stuck on the road in hotels
(praise the pagan gods of wi-fi).

| If you want a decent gaming PC for an affordable price, a desktop is

|

And a superior gaming rig is less than $2000?  Well, maybe if you want to
build it yourself, but you obviously don't know much about the current
generation of gamers.

Been to a gaming convention or LAN party recently?  Used to be techno-geaks
would show up lugging their souped up &quot;luggable&quot; gaming rigs, drag their big
monitor in, spend a bit getting it all set up, and then sit down to some
serious fragging...  If you were a gaming freak, you pretty much had to
either know or become one of the techno-geaks to get your game on.  Now, you
walk into one of these little frag-fests, and at least half of the systems
in use are notebooks.  Sure, there are plenty of super Shuttle systems with
liquid cooling and dylithium crystal power matrices suspended in an
anti-matter chamber that is powered by a captive singularity, but the gaming
notebooks have brought simplicity and accessibility to the masses...  The
younger gaming audience of today is increasingly mobility oriented, and they
would rather just buy a screamin laptop to feed their frag frenzy than have
to learn how to do it all themselves...

The writing has been on the wall for years, just look at the sales figures
for PCs...  Mobility is in, desktop anchors are on the decline, and the
gaming industry will either follow along or just permanently switch over to
the simpler and more lucrative consoles.  I agree with Zag on this one, if
the AMD/ATi pairing can result in a great integrated CPU/GPU combination
that has some serious power (unlike the lame Intel integrated video options
out there now), they could come out smelling like a rose here...  Leave the
bleeding-edge desktop graphics to nVidia, try to beat them with a mobile
combination that will outclass the current nVidia mobile offerings, and AMD
may be able to carve their own highly profitable niche in the future that is
mobility.

That's part of where the AMD/ATi integrated system will shine...  If you can
integrate a CPU/GPU combination, you can eliminate alot of the surface area,
extra electronics, and associated cooling required to process decent
graphics in a mobile platform...  Optimization is where it's at in this
case:  compare performance of 2 identical notebooks, 1 with a lame
integrated Intel graphics set, and the other with the nVidia or ATi mobile
GPU option...  You'll see a hard hit on battery life and a big increase in
heat with the mobile GPU...  Hell, I was laughing when I recently saw a
system that has BOTH graphics sets in the unit - run the Intel stuff for
office work, then flip the switch if you need to get your game on with the
nVidia power (provided you are constantly plugged in)...  If AMD can get
Intel-like power savings and higher-end video performance in one tight
package, they could have a winner.

I get the impression that there are fewer reasons to own either a
desktop or a laptop which is basically what the dinosaur comments were

you invariably had a desktop to manipulate and play them.

Thing is mp3 players and portable music seem to be what people want ergo
the success of crap like the Ipod.

Likewise while the internet was and is great for finding like minded
individuals and keeping in touch, the cell phone and text messaging
seems to be the current hot ticket item.

There are core applications that the PC will continue to dominate at,
they make one hell of an electric typewriter, but the one machine and
one huge OS that does it all seems to be going from 'the' market to a niche.

Oh, believe me, I agree with most of that...  As I mentioned in another
post, these days it's all smaller faster cheaper better...  With killer
pieces of hardware like the iPhone hitting the mobile market, the &quot;old
fashioned&quot; computers are slowly moving towards obsolescence...  At least
with notebooks, you have the power of the PC when you need it, and serious
portability.  But there's actually apparently more reasons to own a laptop
than ever, because the mobile computing industry is growing instead of
shrinking with atrophy.  But, take a look at the ultra-mobile PCs like the
oQo and some of the Sony products, and you see where computing might be
headed...  The future is all about mobility and integration...  And making
the whole computing experience as pain-free and intuitive as possible (just
look at the iPhone's appeal for an example of what I mean there).

Just imagine, someday soon we'll have the power of a desktop in a package
the size of a Blackberry...  Somehow I picture our thumbs becoming smaller
and more pointed in our evolutionary future :-p

AMD conned themselves with big ideas about being another one-stop shop
for integrated CPU/corte-logic/graphics, when they were just turning
the corner of giving Intel a run for their money with CPUs. Gotta
learn to creawl before you can run. AMD should have fiendishly
concentrated on their core &quot;knitting&quot;,  -- getting both their CPU
design AND CPU process-technology in a position to continuously
challenge Intel before any such crazy adventures. No doubt Dave Orton
and Co. played up AMD/Hector's ambitions to the hilt -- as I said
earlier, the best (and smoothest) high-tech con-job of 2006 (imho, of
course).

Not at all. Cool logic and a pretty good understanding of the dynamics

Ah, yes. Again blaming everybody else except AMD's management. BTW,
the AMD stock that I sold at $25, I bought at ~ $9, over a year
earlier when it was so, so obvious that AMD had a winner with the

Huh ? What are you smoking?  I doubt if nV would be at all interested
in picking up anything other that a few of ATi 's bright personnel
that will be falling off the tattered bandwagon. I suspect that much
of ATi's high-end graphics business will be very quietly shelved over
the next year, ( with just minor variants of the existing technology
being cranked for cash ) and the remainder of the business (core
chip-sets, integrated graphics, consumer multimedia) rolled into the
AMD portfolio. The cash shortage and exceptionally high cost of
next-gen GPU development makes that process inevitable -- if AMD is to
financially survive at all, it MUST return to its CPU core-competency.
AMD cannot afford to finance advanced-GPU development as well as
advanced CPU design and process development. Any hint of AMD shorting
the CPU business in favor of graphics will have the banks and other
bail-out investors scrambling for their cash.

Remember that nV invested ~$400 million in the 8xxx-series design
through manufacturing. And are probably investing the same amount of
cash on the true next-gen --- stay tuned for mid-2008.  AMD does not
have that kind of money right now for any such adventures.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I suspect that development budgets within AMD/ATi are very
&gt;&gt; tight indeed  - not much room for creativity, just try to milk as much

&gt;All conjecture of course. I'd love to know if NV treats its employees

I have not noticed anything different in nV's attitude to the consumer
market from that of ATi. -- the only comparison that makes sense,
since there are no other real players in the  medium/high-end computer
graphics business. Pray be more specific with concrete facts, instead
of flailing about.

As far as treatment of nV employees are concerned, truly excellently.
They hire top talent and encourage individual creative-thinking. nV
runs internally like a small company -- a very flat management
structure, and not afraid to take technology risk.' Agile', 'flexible'
are good descriptions of nVidia approach to their business.
Bureaucratic management layers have no place at nVidia.

&gt;about. Just as a for instance, maybe 10 years ago if you were into mp3s,
&gt;you invariably had a desktop to manipulate and play them.

&gt;Thing is mp3 players and portable music seem to be what people want ergo

&gt;Likewise while the internet was and is great for finding like minded

it 10 years tops for more major western cities. Even now in Australia (you
know, that backward little 2nd-class test-bed for the US consumer market? ;)
you can get 7.2Mbit mobile connections on Telstra's NextG (850MHz) network,
available in most US/HKG/EU cities now as well with their GPRS global

&gt; Anyhow, I've always been an nVidia user, and for serious bleeding-edge

And, interestingly enough, my $1200 Dell notebook plays games nearly as well
as my $1000 &quot;decent&quot; gaming desktop...  Yet it's portable, and I can take it
on the road with me.  It has its limits, of course, and there are always
pros and cons to every decision when choosing a computer platform.  But, you
keep missing my point:  laptops and mobile computing platforms are an
ever-increasing percentage of total PC sales, while desktops are on a steady
decline...  If PC gaming is to avoid extinction, it has to be able to exist
on a mobile platform.  But you can't just write games to run on laptops, you
need laptops that can run all games.  Which is one of the goals of the
AMD/ATi integration strategy.  If you want to be different than the rest of
the world and completely ignore the mobile computing sector, go ahead and
stick your head in the sand, but don't be surprised when you finally peek
out and see a world nearly devoid of desktops.

Think they want a lame business version or something that can entertain them
as well?  The entire computing industry is moving towards laptops...
Something to consider:  laptops sales are booming, desktop sales are
declining...  Your Valve gaming survey shows the majority of gamers still on
desktops, and the PC gaming industry is steadily shrinking...  Hey, what a
coincidence!

of these processes.

Here's another interesting view on the issue that I stumbled upon while
reading about Linux (read down a bit on the article):

http://petervandyke.blogspot.com/2006/10/2007-year-of-linux-on-deskto...

Seriously, if Intel is hiring GPU engineers, and nVidia is hiring CPU
engineers, and everyone who's anyone seems to be racing to get a multicore
CPU/GPU combination, how is the AMD/ATi merger anything different?  Other
than the fact that they have come right out in the open and put their
intentions out for the world (and the stockholders) to see?  At least they
are being honest about what their path is, and yes it's a risk, but a
calculated one aimed at the future, which is mobile computing.

&lt;steps down from soapbox and wanders off aimlessly&gt;

The driving force behind it is to make a cheap bundled product to put

crappy GPUs they're now putting into their northbridges into their CPUs.
Pretty much by definition, any GPU put into the same package as CPU will
be using shared memory bus with the CPU.

Intel has been hiring GPU engineers for years, so I don't know what you
think that means, but as far their integrated solutions are concerned
the only difference is that Intel has a huge lead.  Intel is the number
one graphics chip manufacturer, leading in the both the desktop market
and the laptop markets for years.  Half all of laptop graphics chips
sold in the last quarter were made by Intel.  Both NVIDIA and AMD/ATI
are working hard to gain market share from Intel, but they're not doing
that by going after the gaming market they already own.  The future
of PC gaming lies with NVIDIA's and ATI's discrete graphics chips,
not their Intel-wannabe integrated graphics solutions.
