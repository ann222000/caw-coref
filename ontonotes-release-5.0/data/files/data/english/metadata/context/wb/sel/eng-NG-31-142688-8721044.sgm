US August new home sales down 8.3 pct to 795,000 units, lowest level
in 7 years

WASHINGTON (Thomson Financial) -

Sales of new homes in the US fell more sharply than expected to their
lowest level in more than seven years as the median sales price fell
by the sharpest amount in more than three decades to a level just
above where it was two and a half years ago, the Commerce Department
said today.

Sales of new homes in the US fell by 8.3 pct in August to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 795,000 units.

Economists had expected a pace of about 830,000 units.

That's lowest level since June 2000, when about the sales pace was at
just 793,000 units.

In some areas they're UP by nearly 20%.

By lowering prices, a lot more people are now ABLE
to contemplate owning their own home. If they're
actually ABLE to pay, banks are still giving loans.

I expect the new wave of buying to counteract the
losses from bad mortgages and lower property values.

In short, nothing is going &quot;belly up&quot;. The money is
just shifting around a little.

Don't expect a Nobel Prize for Economics nomination any time soon.

Studies by the Economics Policy Institute in late 2006 indicate that
&quot;the housing boom was a key contributor to the growth in both jobs and
GDP over this recovery.&quot;  They describe the housing market as a &quot;mid-
stream&quot; sector of the economy, meaning that it affects many other
industries, both upstream and downstream.  From their data they
conclude: &quot;Absent a considerable boost in demand from other sources
(personal consumption, a lower trade deficit, or accelerated business
investment), we can expect slower growth in coming quarters.&quot;  Those
things aren't going to happen any time soon.  The ultimate effect of
the housing market downturn remains to be seen, but it is certainly
more than money &quot;just shifting around a little.&quot;  In fact, when people
finally understand that the derivatives market is a scam with no
financial banking and that the Fed is a private banking system that
has usurped the US Constitution and has been printing money out of
thin air, the woes of the housing market will seem trivial.

For SOME it's a loss ... the ones who got into property
speculation too late in the game. For many however, even
the current 'depressed' values are substantially above
what THEY paid for their homes five, ten or twenty years
ago. They're not losing, simply not profiting *quite*
as much.

The banks, clearly, are going to have to make a few
adjustments to what levels of what kinds of equity
they equate with creditworthiness - for the short
term anyway. Not a biggie. You talk like their
current policies and interpretations are writ in
stone by the finger-o-gawd or something.

You're pretty fuckin stupid aren't you?

How does one &quot;profit&quot; from a home unless they sell it?  The only thing
happening to people who bought their homes 5 years ago (20-40% on
ARM's) is that their mortgage payment just shot up.  Guess what
happens when people enounter a mortgage payment that they can't
afford?  They liquidate or foreclose.  Wanna further guess what
happens when a lot of people liquidate or foreclose at any certain
time?  Cmon now dumbfuck, you can figure it out.  So, mortgage lenders
are going to tighten their credit thresholds at the very time the
market is being flooded with new listings and foreclosures.  Yeah,
sounds like a recipie for pure upside to me.  LMFAO.

Economists call it recession
November 26, 2001: 1:58 p.m. ET

Panel says downturn began in March, ending record 10-year span of growth.

NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - The world's largest economy sank into a recession in
March, ending 10 years of growth that was the longest expansion on record in
the United States, a group of economists that dates U.S. business cycles
said Monday.

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), composed of academic
economists from Harvard, Stanford and other universities, joined a chorus of
economists and investors who were saying that a recession had already begun.
The group posted its decision on its Web site.

It ruled that the long expansion ended in March and the nation's tenth
recession since the end of World War II began at the same time. The
declaration means the longest expansion lasted exactly 10 years. The
previous record for uninterrupted economic growth was set in the 1960s, a
period of eight years and 10 months lasting from February 1961 to December
1969.

&quot;AMERICA's elder statesman of finance, Alan Greenspan, has shaken the
White House by declaring that the prime motive for the war in Iraq was
oil.

In his long-awaited memoir, to be published tomorrow, Greenspan, a
Republican whose 18-year tenure as head of the US Federal Reserve was
widely admired, will also deliver a stinging critique of President
George W Bush's economic policies.

However, it is his view on the motive for the 2003 Iraq invasion that
is likely to provoke the most controversy. &quot;I am saddened that it is
politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows: the Iraq
war is largely about oil,&quot; he says.&quot;

Clarifying a controversial comment in his new memoir, former Federal

oil supplies, according to an interview published on Monday.

Greenspan, who wrote in his memoir that &quot;the Iraq War is largely about
oil,&quot; said in a Washington Post interview that while securing global oil
supplies was &quot;not the administration's motive,&quot; he had presented the
White House before the 2003 invasion with the case for why removing the
then-Iraqi leader was important for the global economy.

&quot;I was not saying that that's the administration's motive,&quot; Greenspan

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  It's not not what Conservatives are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; saying or have said. I think you just don't want to admit what is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Clinton's fault.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One thing that's clearly not Clinton's fault is a trillion dollar
&gt; &gt;&gt; fake
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; oil war based on bald faced lies.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The effort in Iraq isn't about oil, it's about trying to deal with
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; hopelessness of the region that brought us the events of September
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 11.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;      What did Iraq have to do with 9/11, again?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've explained this to you a hundred times.

&gt; &gt;&gt;      Oh, yes. Iraq was in the Middle East, the hijackers
&gt; &gt;&gt; came from the Middle East, therefore Iraq attacked America.

&gt; &gt;&gt;      Does that about cover it?

&gt; &gt; No, and you know it.

&gt; No WMDs, hijackers all from Saudi Arabia or Egypt, Saddam's fearsome army
&gt; defeated in a few weeks...Say, WTF ARE we doing in Eyerack, Blondie?
">

If you'll recall, it was your crowd that claimed that Saddam's army was
war-hardened and capable. They lost in a few weeks. Now you want to once
again ask why the US is fighting in Iraq. The answer, as I keep
explaining over and over again, is to try to deal with the hopelessness
of the Middle East region, which is what gives bin Laden his warm bodies
willing to blow themselves and innocent others to bloody bits.

Just the opposite. The left was saying that Saddam's
army was a pitiful shell of it's former self, thus a
threat to no one and thus no need to invade. Even Saddams
hated enemies Iran and Turkey said Saddam was impotent
and easily contained. Something even Colin Polin agreed with.

&quot;Saddam Hussein has not developed any significant
capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction.
He is unable to project conventional power against his
neighbours.&quot;

Nope - those are just the shifting excuses Bush

war that everyone knows is a mistake.

Bush has already said he will never withdraw

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  It's not not what Conservatives are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; saying or have said. I think you just don't want to admit
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what
&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Clinton's fault.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One thing that's clearly not Clinton's fault is a trillion
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; dollar
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; fake
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; oil war based on bald faced lies.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The effort in Iraq isn't about oil, it's about trying to deal
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; hopelessness of the region that brought us the events of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; September 11.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;      What did Iraq have to do with 9/11, again?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I've explained this to you a hundred times.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      Oh, yes. Iraq was in the Middle East, the hijackers
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; came from the Middle East, therefore Iraq attacked America.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      Does that about cover it?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; No, and you know it.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No WMDs, hijackers all from Saudi Arabia or Egypt, Saddam's fearsome
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; army defeated in a few weeks...Say, WTF ARE we doing in Eyerack,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Blondie?

&gt; &gt;&gt; First we had stay until the WMDs could be found
&gt; &gt;&gt; Then we had to stay until an interim government was in place
&gt; &gt;&gt; Then we had to stay until Saddam was captured
&gt; &gt;&gt; Then we had to stay until a government could be elected
&gt; &gt;&gt; Then we had to stay until a constitution could be voted on
&gt; &gt;&gt; Then we had to stay until parlimentary elections could be held
&gt; &gt;&gt; Then we had to stay until Iraqi units would &quot;stand up&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Then we had to stay to give Iraqs government &quot;breathing room&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; And now we are staying until.......?

&gt; &gt; The US didn't say that it would leave when any of those things happened.

&gt;     Nope - those are just the shifting excuses Bush
&gt; has used to justify keep US troop bogged down in a
&gt; war that everyone knows is a mistake.
">

Those aren't shifting and they aren't excuses. As the effort develops,
the specific actions will change. The fact that you've been told what is
going on is testament that things are on the up and up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;     Bush has already said he will never withdraw

He won't be president past 2009. A future president might bring them out
of Iraq, which is fine if the situation left behind is stable and
democratic.

&gt; They lost in a few weeks. Now you want to once

&gt; &gt;explaining over and over again, is to try to deal with the hopelessness

&gt; &gt;willing to blow themselves and innocent others to bloody bits.

&gt; And is fighting a lengthy guerilla war in Iraq for the next few

">

The process of mitigating hopelessness is going to take time and will
require looking beyond current events. For example, a functioning
democracy in Iraq could be a light to other nearby nations how to modify
their political systems in order to give people more of a say in their
daily lives and the direction of their respective countries.

When people feel involved in things, they are less hopeless because they
can act and their actions potentially can have positive benefit. If they
feel that they can't act, some are susceptible to extremist notions,
especially troublesome are notions based on actions in this life to get
rewards in the next when those notions are implanted by evildoers such
as bin Laden. People can usually resist such thing when they can see the
potential of building a future for themselves and especially for their
families. This community effort replaces striking out like a wild cat in
a corner.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If you'll recall, it was your crowd that claimed that Saddam's army was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;war-hardened and capable.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You know, I really don't recall that.

&gt;&gt; &gt;You don't recall your crowd?

&gt;&gt; Saying that Saddam's army was war-hardened and capable.

&gt;Do you remember saying it about the Taliban?

Ehn...not exactly.  In open battle they're nothing much.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; They lost in a few weeks. Now you want to once
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;again ask why the US is fighting in Iraq. The answer, as I keep
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;explaining over and over again, is to try to deal with the hopelessness
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;of the Middle East region, which is what gives bin Laden his warm bodies
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;willing to blow themselves and innocent others to bloody bits.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; And is fighting a lengthy guerilla war in Iraq for the next few
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; decades going to be an effective way to alleviate hopelessness?

&gt;&gt; &gt;The process of mitigating hopelessness is going to take time and will
&gt;&gt; &gt;require looking beyond current events.

&gt;&gt; I am looking beyond current events.  I'm looking at a decades-long
&gt;&gt; guerilla war.

&gt;The people we are fighting think they are continuing a generational war
&gt;that has lasted a thousand years. The terrorist threat is likely to be
&gt;&quot;decades-long&quot; but then it's already gone on for decades, hasn't it? Do
&gt;you really think that giving Iraq over to the terrorists will minimize
&gt;that threat in future?

I think being foreign occupying powers in the Middle East for year
after year makes things worse, not better because it lets them blame
everything that is wrong on us.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;     Just the opposite. The left was saying that Saddam's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; army was a pitiful shell of it's former self, thus a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; threat to no one and thus no need to invade.

&gt;&gt; &gt;In between saying that America would be bleached by the war-hardened
&gt;&gt; &gt;Iraqi veterans.

&gt;&gt; You say.  But you may not be the most authoritative source on what
&gt;&gt; leftwingers think.

&gt;I often discuss political issues with them so I do have some insight
&gt;into their views.

Internet loons are not the most reliable guides.
