Here's a tip for my faithful readership in sci.physics.

The best way to get information and news.
------------------------------------------

1. Sign up for &quot;My Yahoo Beta&quot;
2. Click on &quot;Add a page&quot;
3. Click on &quot;Add RSS Feed&quot;
4. Enter a search word for the what you want
5. Select the feeds that you like
6. &quot;Close&quot; that page
7. Click on the page name and rename the page
(News, physics, medicine, technology, games, travel, etc.)
8. Add another page and repeat the process.

-------

After you set up your &quot;My Yahoo&quot; page up,
you can click on the page names to list the feeds,
and as you scan down the list of feeds,
the first paragraph of the feed is displayed.

If you want to read the entire article
click on the specific feed.

-------

As you work with the system,
you can add new feeds,
and delete the feeds that you don't like.

-------

Now this will show you what happened,
and what's happening,

but if you want to know what WILL happen,
and how to &quot;accentuate the positive&quot;,
and how to &quot;eliminate the negative&quot;,
visit my BLOG.

I am disappointed to see
that no one commented on this,
as it is such a great way to
find and filter information.

Does anyone use  &quot;My Yahoo Beta&quot;,
and the RSS feed feature,

or do they depend upon &quot;Diggs&quot;
and random URL postings of posters
to provide them with information?

If you're reading RSS feeds, Mr. Potter,
chances are you have more time to kill than I do.

When I want to know something, I seach for it.
This screen shot shows the list of “ Search PlugIns ” I use:
“ www.Cotse.NET/users/jeffrelf/SearchPlugins.PNG ”
( DamnInteresting.COM, high-lighted in green, is one of them ).

The following links are from my list of Search PlugIns ( .XML files );
“ {searchTerms} ” gets replaced with what I'm searching for.

http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q= {searchTerms}
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search= {searchTerms}&amp;fulltext=fulltext
http://search.msdn.microsoft.com/search/default.aspx?Query= {searchTerms}&amp;brand=msdn&amp;locale=en-US
http://www.damninteresting.com/index.php?s= {searchTerms}
http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term= {searchTerms}&amp;r=f
http://groups.google.com/groups?q= {searchTerms}
http://news.google.com/news?q= {searchTerms}&amp;sa=G&amp;scoring=d
http://Google.COM/groups?selm= {searchTerms}

You can, for example, add a “ Message-ID lookup ”
by pasting the following JavaScript into FireFox's URL bar.
The JavaScript must be a single line, and you have to hit “ Go ” twice.

“ javascript: ( function() {
window.external.AddSearchProvider(
&quot; http://www.cotse.net/users/jeffrelf/MessID.XML &quot;); } )(); ”.

F.Y.I., MessID.XML is just:

“ &lt;OpenSearchDescription xmlns=&quot; http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/ &quot;&gt;
&lt;ShortName&gt;Message ID Lookup&lt;/ShortName&gt;
&lt;Image height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot;&gt;
http://www.cotse.net/users/jeffrelf/X.PNG &lt;/Image&gt;

&lt;Url type=&quot;text/html&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;
template=&quot; http://Google.COM/groups?selm= {searchTerms}&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/OpenSearchDescription&gt; ”.

Jeff, the reason I use the Yahoo &quot;Beta&quot; RSS feed feature
is because I like to use my time efficiently.

There are certain subjects that I like to regularity update
myself on, and I have found that the best way to do this
is to have some RSS feeds from reliable sources,
rather than to hunt and peck
trying to sort out what URLs to use after
an Internet search.

Periodically I do Google my regular subjects
to see if any good new sources have come on the net,
and if they have, I add their RSS (If it exists)
to my Yahoo menu, and if they don't have
an RSS feed, I save a bookmark.

The RSS feeds on Yahoo are far better than
bookmarks and searching for keeping up-to-date
on various subjects, as you can scan down the list,
pause your cursor on any interested headline,
and jump to the webpage if you are interested.

For example, scanning down a list of
reliable GPS sources and immediately
seeing what is new or interesting,
is much more effective than
clicking a batch of bookmarks,
or Googling &quot;GPS&quot;.

You're probably tracking your investments all the time, Tom,
I don't do anything like that.

My sole “ investments ” are people, e.g. associates of www.ABA.COM ,
my rooming-house, Sci.Physics, Microsoft.Public.VC.Language, etc.
