Flying Triangles

This weeks files cover: Cosmic Cockroaches, Starchild Skull Not Human,
and Nephilim Mated with Women

Unidentified Aerial Phenomena were spotted over: Alabama, Arizona,
California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine,
Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Texas Creature, and Washington.

UFOs were also seen in Belgium, Canada, Hong Kong, Mexico, and the UK.

These Files assume that extraterrestrial intelligent life not only
exists, but my hypothesis is that the over one hundred UFOs reported each
week represent technologically advanced spacecraft conducting surveillance
of Earth. I personally became interested in UFOs when I chased one over
England when flying for the US A-r Force. I've been investigating them ever
since.
The US Ai- Force under Project Blue Book investigated UFOs for more than
twenty years, we continue this research. It is my belief that G-d has
spread intelligent civilizations throughout the universe.

Cosmic Cockroaches

N-SA reports, Starved. Stomped. Radiated. Poisoned. It's all in a day's
work for the common household cockroach. The abuse these creatures can
withstand is amazing. But astronomers have found something even tougher
&quot;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,&quot; says Achim Tappe of the Harvard
Center for Astrophysics. &quot;They can survive a supernova.&quot; Polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's for short) are ring-shaped molecules made
of carbon and hydrogen. They're about as well loved as roaches: PAH's are
a widespread organic pollutant, appearing in auto exhaust, oil spills
and cigarette smoke. The EPA has classified seven PAH compounds as human
carcinogens.

A ball-and-stick model of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
naphthalene, commonly found in mothballs.

Ring-shaped molecules similar to PAHs are found in DNA, and there's a
growing consensus among biologists that PAHs were present on Earth 4.5
billion years ago when life began. By serving as building blocks for
larger molecules of life, PAH's may have played an essential role in the
chemical process of genesis.

The story begins 3000 years ago when a massive star in the Large
Magellanic Cloud exploded causing a typical supernova releasing in a
just few days the energy our sun produces in about 10 billion years.
Hot gas and deadly radiation blasted through nearby star systems.
The supernova's expanding shell, catalogued by astronomers as &quot;N132D&quot;,
remains visible from Earth and spans 80 light years. Tappe states,
Last year &quot;we scanned N132D using the infrared Spitzer Space Telescope,
with a spectrometer that revealed &quot;PAHs all around the supernova's
expanding shell. They appear to be swept up by a shock wave of 8
million degree gas, but many of the PAH's are surviving.&quot;
Thanks to NA-A.

Starchild Skull Not Human

Lloyd P-e sent me his interesting book, explaining that he had in his
possession a skull that extraordinary properties that are not entirely
human.  The story began when an American girl of Me-ican heritage
visited relatives in a rural village.  The teenager went exploring and
found a human skeleton in the back of a cave. She saw the hand of a
second skeleton holding the arm of the first and uncovered a smaller
malformed skeleton.
The girl kept both the skulls and kept them until she died. Five years
later Lloyd Pye obtained the skull and realized it was very special. The
Starchild skull has been tested and appears to be a human/alien hybrid.
It is much thinner and lighter than any human skull. Carbon 14 dating
has determined The Starchild is a 900 year old skull much harder than
any human skull.

Legends of star-beings that came from space and impregnated women in
remote villages are common throughout Central and South America. The
women have the babies and raise them to six or so when they are carried
away by the star-beings.

The Star-child skull has unprecedented fibers embedded in the matrix
of the bone. Additionally, there is reddish residue inside cancellous
holes.  Loydea book is essentially the story of the Starchild and his
efforts to discover the truth of its heritage.  The book is well written
worth reading.

Nephilim Mated with Women

Harold Ca-ver reports:  I am writing this letter to respond to Reverend
Barry Do-ning, Ph.D. author of &quot; The Bible and Flying Saucers .&quot; The
article seems to imply that the alien presence here on Earth and the
abduction are a good thing, perhaps even a Go-ly thing. It's strange that
this subject should come up because my research has finally brought me
to the prospects of Gen-sis 6 of the Bi-le. I won't restate it and people
can read the account themselves. As it was, after the fall of mankind,
man began to multiply on the Earth and daughters were born to the children
of men.

Nephilim came from space aboard winged disk Persepolis, Iran

Certain Angelic &quot;watchers&quot; lusted after the human women and left the
higher existence they had in order to assume flesh and to unite
biologically with them, and from them came the &quot;Nephilim&quot;. This was
an evil act to pollute the gene pool of humanity to prevent the birth
of the Christ. It failed as God destroyed them in the flood. However,
they did not give up. Having left their first abode they are held as
physical creatures here is this existence. They are capable of
manipulating humans and other creatures through genetic engineering.
They manipulate and cross breed over each generation to perfect a new
species to rule the Earth. What we see now in the increase of UFO
activity is a return of the Nephilim to reclaim the Earth and will
probably have their &quot;new&quot; species with them to mingle with us and be
able to function like us.  I believe that they were on Mars on the
moon, and elsewhere. They have had generations to rule among the stars,
and to build civilizations. After hybridizing, they could continue their
r-ces through natural means. Each species may be different from another,
thus you would have powers and dominions.

What is happening here on the Earth is a preparation for a great -ar
that is going on in the heavens and coming here to the Earth. We will
see more and more increased sightings and abductions until the se-ret
cannot be hid anymore. Then, they will openly show themselves and
force us to serve them.
It will end at Arm-geddon when Ch-ist comes.  (JW  I don't know that
I agree with that way of thinking.)

Don't ever think for a moment that aliens that hide themselves and work
in the night in the dark stealing people from their beds is a good
thing or G-dly in some way. Stealing human eggs and sperm and creating
hybrids can only be e-il. One abductee recalled that the intent was to
&quot;replace&quot; the human populace with a &quot;better&quot; one. This is not a good
thing.

I predict that in a very short time it will all be in the open, and
the l-e will be that they are our friends. But for a short time it will
be a literal he-l on the Earth as they do as they please to us. Je--s
said that &quot;..as in the days of Noah, so shall it be at the coming of
the Son of man (J--us).&quot;
At the time Go- sent the flood. The Nephilim ruled the world. They have
had generations to perfect not creating giants and prepare a people to
mingle with us and to rule a powerful one world order. First there will
be more provable sightings, then gov-rnment leaks, then open revelation.
Then it will be too late to resist before C-rist comes back. They are
not our friends.  (JW  I would say, &quot;It's not over till it's over&quot;.

California UFO Photos

SAUSALITO -- A friend of mine lives in the San Francisco Bay area.
While she slept, I knew she would miss the opportunity to see the
eclipse of the moon.
I live in Las Vegas and already saw it early yesterday morning. I
connect to many Bay Area and other webcams, so I thought I would
check some to see if any had a picture of the Bay Area skyline with
perhaps the eclipsed Moon.
What I saw was no moon. It was cigar shaped, and very bright. It
moved in each frame snap from right to left, then back to center,
close to the camera. The webcam refreshes every two minutes (the
date/time is super imposed on the screen at the cam source.)
difficult to see in the dark water, but shows the event from 3:06
AM PDT to 3:15 AM then the final frame shows nothing again.
http://www.rntl.net/images/sausalitocam.jpg
In daytime views of this cam, you can see no physical structure
reach that height.
I've enclosed a stitched together copy of each of the snaps in
sequence. I have done no other alteration to the images. Fortunately
they are of high resolution webcams. Thanks to MUFON CMS

LOS ANGELES -- A large dark triangle with small blinking lights
flew very low over my neighborhood on the east side of Los Angeles
at around 1:30 AM, on August 11, 2007. It appeared to be the size
of a jet plane, and the blinking lights (red and white) at the
&quot;corners&quot; resembled plane lights, but it was much lower and moved
much slower than a plane. It also made a very low rumbling sound
that did not sound like a plane. It moved in a west to east
direction, gliding very smoothly.

Subject: Your Friendly Sasquatch.  Part 3.                   Sept. 6, 2007.

Here Joan talks about some of her dealings with Dolphins.

...........................................................................
...........................................................................

It was interesting to me to learn that the Wise Ones can erase your mind
so that you forget you talked with them. They said you will not forget the
information they share with you, but you will probably forget the meeting
itself. You will think you have never seen them, but you have.
This morning I drew a picture of the face I saw in the dark last night.
I felt compelled to draw the gentleness of the eyes and the light shining
in them. I did my best. The only art supplies I had were a black indelible
marker and a piece of paper toweling. All I could see of the face were
the eyes, and I didn't know exactly what the rest of the face looked
like. I am pleased that I followed my instincts and drew this the morning
after the contact while the memory lingered so clearly within me.
Then later in the day, Medicine Woman came and telep-thically said to
Susan that she, Medicine Woman, was the one who contacted me and who I saw
last night from the cabin.
You can imagine how happy I felt to know that it was our friend,
Medicine Woman, who was the loving Wise One who chose to reveal her
presence to me.

Other Talents of the Sasquatch

This family of Sasquatch walk long distances from one part of
the country to another. It is easy for them. They can walk 10 to
20 miles an hour, depending on the pace. Fences, even those with
barbed wire, do not deter them, since they can step over them.
They consult with other Sasquatch for h-aling remedies. It
seems to be of great interest to them and they know the herbs of
the forest well. They will suggest the best berries and roots
to use to hea-l your illnesses if you ask.
Now Susan shows me a wall calendar that she uses to jot down her
appointments and schedules, etc. She took it off the wall at home
and brought it to the forest today. In addition to Susan's notes
written on the calendar, there are also notes by the Medicine
Woman. She writes when she will be at the Farm and when she will
be in the forest. She has written that she will be in the forest
when we are there, this weekend. She wrote: WE COME THIS DAY and
the next weekend, she wrote: WE COME 11 DAY. Susan explains that
the number is not number eleven, but number 2. They write numbers
by using strokes, one stroke for each number. 1 represents one
day.

Sounds in the Night
As the evening came, I began to hear soft clinking sounds as
though two crystal wands are being tapped together. It is very
subtle and could only be heard in concentrated listening. Once
you hear it, you can tune in to it very well. It certainly was
not a forest or animal sound.
These are the kinds of signals they give us to let us know they
are arriving.
As we sat around the fire, a small heavy stone came through
the trees into the fire. It was a &quot;Hello, we are here!&quot; sign.
Not threatening, not aimed at us, but precisely thrown so we
would see it fly into our midst. Since we cannot see any
Sasquatch around at times like this, are they teleporting the
rocks? I know they can teleport things because in the next few
days there in the woods, they demonstrated this.
Now off in the distance I hear a call that sounds like an
owl imitation. &quot;Hoo ... Hoo ... Hooooooo&quot; This is repeated over
and over and is comig from the west. Ten minutes of silence
then I hear it begin again, lasting longer, only now it is in
the extreme east. Could this be two Sasquatch families calling
to each other? Or did one Sasquatch quickly move from one
mountain to another? What they have shown me is their ability
to project their voices. On this night they demonstrate this
to me, until I am surrounded in a stereophonic circle of Hoots
from different directions. They play with this, first watching
me look to the right in response to a sound and then looking to
the left because the sound is now over there. I understand the
concept.
Again the dolphins have demonstrated the same thing. They
also can project different sounds simultaneously in each of our
ears while we are swimming together. It helps me to understand
the Sasquatch because of my experiences with the dolphins in
the ocean where sound moves more quickly than in air. Suddenly a
shrieking high C sound pierces the silence that causes me to
jump in my chair! It is very close to all of us. We were all
startled. A sound like that goes right through your body. There
is no night bird or animal that makes that sound. It repeats
again, but this time we are not startled and so we listen with
interest.
It is followed by silence and then the hooting sounds resume.
We also listened many nights to loud sounds that seemed to be a
rock being hit against a boulder - rock on rock. We also heard
what sounded like a stick on a scrub board, and one night we
heard sounds of extra loud growls like an injured lion.  (JW
As I read this, I recall the times I spent at my grandparent's
trimmings of logs covered house on a ranch near Dattle, New
Mexico.  I heard sounds like this but was told it was probably
a mountain lion.)
Never a dull moment! The nights were filled with mysterious
noises and activities in the darkness.
Sometimes it feels like we are subjects in a Sasquatch
research project. Perhaps a project to determine which sounds
create what reactions in humans. Or perhaps a communication
project called &quot;what does it take to make humans know we are
here and we are their friends?&quot;

Subject: Ancient Australian Pine.                             Sept. 7, 2007.

My number one son was listening to the TV show called American's
Heartland this week and they were talking about a pine tree that was
discovered over in Australia.  They thought it was a new plant but it
turned out that it had grown for millions of years.  There was only about
100 of these trees left and they are now trying to get people to plant
this pine tree throughout the world.  Here are the particulars about this
story that I found on google by typing in the words Ancient Australian
Tree.

An Ancient Tree Grows in Brooklyn: Brooklyn Botanic Garden Debuts the
Wollemi Pine.
&quot;Living Fossil&quot; Is Added to The Garden's Trail of Evo-ution Exhibit
&quot;Wollemi Pine&quot;.
A Wollemi pine in cultivation.
Students from Shuang Wen Academy (P.S. 184) in lower Manhattan are the
first to see the &quot;Living Fossil&quot; with BBG President Scot Medbury explaining
the rare tree that outlived the dinosaurs.
Brooklyn, NY January 19, 2007
As part of its mission to share with the public information on plant
conservation, Brooklyn Botanic Garden (BBG) announced it has secured a
specimen of the extremely rare Wollemi pine Wollemia nobilis, which will
be added to the Garden's permanent plant collections and featured on
public display beginning Friday, January 19, 2007.
Referred to as a &quot;major botanical find of the century,&quot; the Wollemi
pine was believed to be extinct for 2 million years. But in 1994 a
small grove of trees was discovered in Australia's Blue Mountains by
New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service Officer David Noble,
setting off worldwide excitement for a majestic plant that managed to
survive through 17 ice ages over the past millennia.
Since its rediscovery, scientists and horticulturists have studied
the Wollemi pine to learn how this ancient species was able to survive.
At the same time, because fewer than 100 trees exist in the wild, a
burgeoning plant-propagation and commercialization initiative has
been launched the cornerstone of the conservation strategy to preserve
these trees in their native habitat. Royalties from the sale of
cultivated Wollemi pines will go toward conservation efforts. Brooklyn
Botanic Garden is offering a limited number of the trees so that
visitors will be able to participate in the conservation effort by
purchasing this ancient and rare tree to take home. All trees sold in
the U.S. are sold under the National Geographic brand.
BBG's own Wollemi pine will be displayed in the Steinhardt
Conservatory's Trail of E-olution, which traces the development of
plant life from its origin four billion years ago to the present day.
The Wollemi pine belongs to the ancient coniferous family
Araucariaceae, whose fossil record dates back over 200 million years
to the time of the dinosaurs. The intrepretive information for the
Garden's Trail of Evolution presents data on the evo-ution of plants,
and one of the panels emphasizes the living-fossil characteristic of
the family. Visitors can see the beauty of the tree itself that, at
maturity, showcases bark that looks like bubbling chocolate and
multiple trunks with fernlike foliage.
&quot;The discovery of a plant long thought to be extinct and only known
through fossils is an exciting and remarkable story that fires the
imagination,&quot; said Scot Medbury, president of Brooklyn Botanic Garden.
&quot;Plants that have outlived the dinosaurs present a thrilling tale for
children and collectors alike, and Brooklyn Botanic Garden is
delighted to be able to showcase the Wollemi pine for our visitors. We
look forward to nurturing these young plants so that future generations
will be able to enjoy them,&quot; Medbury added.
&quot;The addition of the Wollemi pine to BBG's plant collections also
offers us an important opportunity to demonstrate the Garden's extensive
plant conservation efforts and the excellent environmental
stewardship initiatives that we have been working on with Botanic
Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) and the Center for Plant
Conservation (CPC),&quot; explained Medbury. &quot;Through this exhibit, the
Garden can communicate the alarming rate at which far too many plants
are facing extinction.&quot;
The Garden's Education Department will offer fun, instructional
activities for children and their families in order to spark the thrill
of discovery and offer a chance to be part of the living history of
the Wollemi and other ancient endangered plants, as well as to inspire
a plant conservation commitment. On weekends, there will be interactive
Wollemi pine Discovery Carts in the Steinhardt Conservatory. Children
can investigate modern-day plants that were part of the landscape
when dinosaurs roamed the earth and make a leaf rubbing from one of
these &quot;living fossils.&quot;
The Garden will provide comprehensive and informative material on the
award-winning BBG.org website, and the volunteer Garden Guides will
provide visitors with a compelling tour of the Trail of Evolut-on in
the Steinhardt Conservatory.
The Wollemi pine exhibit in the Steinhardt Conservatory will be on
display beginning January 19.
