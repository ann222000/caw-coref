The Peak District National Park is an area of outstanding natural
beauty, which offers a wide range of activities and adventures to it's
visitors. Twiggy's Bed and Breakfast at Hague Bar, New Mills offers
you accommodation in a traditional Victorian cottage built from local
stone. The accommodation has been upgraded to offer the modern
comforts you'll require for a stay in and around the Peak District.

'Twiggys' is situated on the Derbyshire-Cheshire border, and nestles
in the foothills of the Peak District. The house lies within reach of
Hayfield, Buxton, Castleton, Edale, Matlock, Bakewell and Holmfirth.
There are many stately homes/halls and country estates such as Lyme,
Chatsworth, Gawsworth, Capesthorne and Adlington. For those who enjoy
walking, climbing or exploring, Kinder Scout, Mam Tor, Stanage Edge,
the Goyt Valley, Blue John Mines, Treakcliffe and Speedwell Caverns
are just a few of your possible adventures.
