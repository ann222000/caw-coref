Let's face it, fake CVs are ruining IT !!!

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News_By_Industry/Infotech/So...

BANGALORE: The problem of fake CVs seems to be getting bigger and bigger in
the Indian IT industry. Hyderabad-based IT biggie Satyam Computers is learnt
to have terminated the services of atleast 500 people in the past one year
because they had fudged their documents.

When contacted, Satyam VP-HR Mukund Menon told ET, "it is true that we have
asked about 500 people to leave after finding fabricated documents in their
applications. However, this is not in one shot, but over a period of one
year or so."

n another instance recently, HSBC's BPO unit in Hyderabad reportedly sacked
a few employees for giving fake CVs. A bank spokesperson declined to comment
when contacted.

In the last couple of years, IT companies have been quietly terminating the
employment of people who have fabricated their backgrounds. These include IT
majors like IBM India , Infosys and TCS. However, in March last year, Wipro
Technologies not just fired some employees for faking their CVs but also
filed police complaints against several recruitment agencies in Andhra
Pradesh and Chennai for helping those employees falsify CV information.

Experts opine that manipulation of resumes, especially in collaboration with
recruitment firms and sometimes with HR-related employees of IT companies,
is assuming alarming proportions in the country. A KPMG study — India Fraud
Survey Report 2006 — which covered over a thousand organisations across
India, said that 15-24 % of CVs in India are fake and one out of three CVs
misrepresent facts. The study found that the IT, financial, entertainment
and telecom sectors face the highest risk.

BANGALORE: Fake CVs have been playing havoc in the recruitment market,
compelling companies to spend exorbitant amounts for pre and post-hiring
checks through third-party agencies. Mahendra Pratap, an alumni of
IIT-Kanpur, has created a portal that allows anybody to add comments about a
candidate whose resume is available on the site. In Mahendra Pratap's portal
mohanchoti.com, a company on the look out for candidates pays a one-time fee
to the portal and later pays for every reference concerning a particular
candidate. Pratap's concept is patent-pending, and barely three months since
its founding - the portal has a database of 40,000 CVs and over 15,000
referrals.
