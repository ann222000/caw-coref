Kudos to Rog for a great GP debut, especially after seeing the earlier
dogfight he was in with Herrin in the AMA Supersport race! How'd you
like how he squared off that last corner to keep from running wide and
getting repassed in the drag to the line? Classic stuff there. He may
yet eclipse his brother, but that damn Herrin is a comer, too. I like
the way Freddie smacked Sheheen down on raising a comparison to
&quot;...another #46 Yamaha on the other side of the fence...&quot;. Way too
early to make those sorts of comparisons, says Spencer...no shit?

I agree. That was early in a long race, no reason to do anything
high-risk at that point. I hate he got a DNF and 0 points but that's
the way it goes.
I'm trying to figure out whether Miguel showed more guts in quitting
than he would have in staying out there. I guess I can see his point
in stopping if he wasn't in the groove. He has nothing on the line in
that series and no future there, either. Unlike Roger Hayden or Davies
who might desire a full ride in GP one day and therefore desired to
impress, Miguel had nothing to gain and not much to lose either.

looked like hew as forced a bit out by stoner (unfortuantely donlt have

then, he would have run out of track. Hopper was as far (or more) out of

I think both of them (and Hopper especially) were really fired up with
adrenalin. It's the first lap, an early corner and these things happen.
It was a shame as I was looking forward to Hopper going for it.

All sorts of daftness this weekend.

- Guintoli getting the corkscrew hopelessly wrong. It must have been
something like his 4th attempt. Just very unfortunate that Hoffman was
in the way. Shades of Chandler and Yanagawa but a different reason.

- As Ryder says: &quot;Alex Hofmann being stranded on the outside of the
circuit for 20 minutes before an ambulance could get to him. Why was the
red flag delayed? How come GPs come to a track where there is no
ambulance access by service road?&quot;
http://www.superbikeplanet.com/2007/Jul/e/n070722p.htm
I mean, really. The Corkscrew. How many accidents have we seen there
over the years?

- Ryder again. &quot;It would never happen in Europe: Only two races on
Sunday! In the UK they wouldn't pay to get in and in Spain they'd burn
the place down.&quot;
Two races? You're kidding. Every other round of MotoGP manages 4 races
on the day, sometimes 5.

- I have to say I did enjoy the display of gratuitous Nationalism before
the race. The Flyby. The Marines band in dress uniform. The offkey
singing of the National anthem. The prominently displayed flags on the
video feed. All that was missing (or was it missing?) was the Christian
prayer for the racers. It would never happen in the EuroFag countries
where they can't even work out if they're one country (EU) or many.

- Kurtis slowing down, running wide, looking behind him when Melandri is
on a hot lap. Completely unnecessary.

- Checa slowing down, looking behind him when Hopper is on a hot lap. So
there were yellow flags, maybe. So? There were 3 minutes left of QP1.

- Rossi forgetting that this is Laguna and there's no astro turf between
the white line and the sand. There's a drainage gully. Err, why? Those
last corners before the corkscrew look narrower than they used to be,
although maybe it's that the bikes are faster. That used to be a
favourite passing place for crazy or stupid riders like Kocinski. It
really didn't look like it was possible for anyone to run into the
corkscrew on the inside.

- Pretty much nobody going faster on qualifiers than they went on worn
race tyres. What's that all about? I know we had new tarmac and it
proved abrasive, but how did Michelin get it so wrong? I think this was
another downside of the new tyre rules. Again. Like I said before, I
didn't like some riders getting special tyres flown in on Fri and Sat
night, but the current system isn't right either.

- Just like Sachsenring, we had new tarmac but with new bumps. Again,
why?

- What a waste of time Duhamel's ride proved to be. Though I suppose
Hopper got one point as a result.

- Let's hear it for Roger Hayden and Chaz Davies. Give them both a job.
And West as well. And De Puniet.

- After all the back and forth about Jordan and AMA SB rules, Yates gets
a podium. Perhaps there's nothing wrong with the Jordan Suzukis except
the riders?

- And I guess Hodgson showed that there's not too much wrong with the
Corona Hondas that firing James Ellison wouldn't sort out.

- Too many people hurt this year. A side effect of the 800cc?

And finally (really). When is Stoner going to hit some bad luck? Right
now he's got that Doohan thing going where not only is he on a roll but
he wants to rub everyone's nose in it. None of this controlling the race
from the front. If he can win by 10-15-20s, he will.

Well, when they ran the AMA SB race on Speed about 30 minutes after I
posted what I wrote, they had almost exactly the same take on it that
I had. He basically decided to save himself for the AMA race, which he
did a damn fine job of fighting for a podium position on, and managed
a close 4th out the deal. Unfortunately for him, Jordan's $$$ and name
recognition have enabled him to get Suzuki to sell them the right
parts to make Yates's Gixxer almost as good as the factory rides of
Spies and Mladin. The 3-way scramble for 3rd between Duhamel, Yates,
and Hodgsen was the highlight of the race, with all of them holding
the spot at some point and lapped traffic playing a role in the final
outcome.
And yeah, sometimes it takes more guts to quit than to hang in there,
especially in something being broadcast live on worldwide TV.

So Pablo blames Hayden, and Julian subtly blames overenthusiastic
Americans at home in general. Predictable enough. Hayden came in toward
the apex of the corner and found Stoner there, who was in too hot,
struggling to get it stopped and drifting wide. That might in part be
because Pedrosa had gotten in too fast and was himself running wide,
although he didn't physically force Casey wide at all, as he was way out
front going in. I was watching the race from the hill between turns one
and two, and took a photo of the guys coming through the first apex,
with the first four way wide, and then Capirossi and Vermeulen on a more
normal line. Hopkins was behind Hayden at that time, but cut up the
inside, which really left Hayden with nowhere to go, as they were both
so far out. Anyway, I just think it was a case of a slow corner right
after a start and a bunch of guys going for it. I do not think that
incident would have occurred had Pedrosa and certainly Stoner not gotten
in as hot as they did, creating a chain reaction sort of thing.

&gt;&gt; Kudos to Rog for a great GP debut, especially after seeing the earlier

&gt;&gt; like how he squared off that last corner to keep from running wide and
&gt;&gt; getting repassed in the drag to the line?

&gt; You just knew that was coming, but great stuff nonetheless. You gotta'

&gt; him at the top of the title chase..

&gt; Classic stuff there. He may

&gt;&gt; the way Freddie smacked Sheheen down on raising a comparison to
&gt;&gt; &quot;...another #46 Yamaha on the other side of the fence...&quot;. Way too
&gt;&gt; early to make those sorts of comparisons, says Spencer...no shit?

&gt; Really...

What was up with the quote earlier in the week where Rog said he would run
Geoff May off the track?
It turns out he ran Josh Hayes off the track.
Anyone know what brought that verbal explosion out to the public?

Hopkins had claimed the inside of Hayden, so I am not sure how he can then

up front, so he had nothing to do with this. Stoner and Hayden came in side
by side, both go a tad wide, but Hayden continues to do so. Hopkins makes it
to Hayden's inside, but Hayden clips him coming in from the outside. Whether
it's Hopkins fault for being there, or Hayden's for coming in from the
outside... well, Hayden remained upright, Hopkins didn't. Shame, since both
had shown some promise. Then again, it truly looked like Stoner reigned
supreme up front. Pedrosa just had half a lap of glory and then faded. The
Michelins had a horrible weekend, it looks like they are falling behind
bridgestone more and more.

From the from on shot it appears Hopkins stood the bike up again
*after* committing to his line through the corner.  My take is that
that was what triggered the collision.  It could well be they would
still have touched if Hopkins had stayed with his original line but
would not have gone down.

This is racing, that was a racing incident, unfair to blame either
rider.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; [snip]

&gt;&gt; I do not think that
&gt;&gt; incident would have occurred had Pedrosa and certainly Stoner not gotten
&gt;&gt; in as hot as they did, creating a chain reaction sort of thing.

&gt; And Mark N subtly blames the midget (and Casey).  What a surprise.
">

No, Mike, I was trying to provide a broader view of the whole incident,
and perhaps I was too subtle. Pedrosa had a huge lead going into that
corner, he was way out front cresting the hill (given the
circumstances), but he got in way too hot and ran well wide, totally
blowing the corner. Then Stoner did the same thing behind him, which may
have been in part because he was reacting to Pedrosa's braking point
instead of his own brake marker (Casey's mistake, of course). I think he
also may have seen Hayden to his right and slightly ahead of him and
didn't want to lose position to him. I think you can see pretty clearly
that when Stoner runs wide it forces Hayden wide, and he gets carried
out toward the edge of the track. Hopkins is behind him and to his
outside going in, and it's not entirely clear if he overheats some going
in or just gets carried wide as well (I think some of both, initially
too hot but then left with nowhere to go once slowed). So as Stoner
finally gets the bike slowed and turned and starts aiming for the inside
of Pedrosa going toward the 2nd apex, Pedrosa having totally blown the
corner and struggling to get back on the gas, Hayden and Hopkins are
left out toward the edge of the track still having to get their bikes
fully turned and moving slower than anyone on the circuit, a parking lot
maneuver. Hopkins gets inside Nicky, but Nick doesn't concede the
position because he's losing spots all the time, and may not have seen
John when he made his turn to get back in the action.

So then the contact at very slow speed and that's effectively the end
for both of them. But at that point they were already going to be
dropping down the order, probably outside the top ten, so it was already
a disaster. And one pretty clearly caused by Stoner, who ended up
shoving both of them way wide. Of the four guys in the lead group, it
appears Hayden may have been the only one who got his stuff stopped
enough and was going to get through that corner properly, so blaming the
whole incident on overenthusiastic Americans strikes me as absurd.

But maybe you see it differently. Or are just being a dick...

&gt; All sorts of daftness this weekend.
&gt; - As Ryder says: &quot;Alex Hofmann being stranded on the outside of the

&gt; http://www.superbikeplanet.com/2007/Jul/e/n070722p.htm
&gt; I mean, really. The Corkscrew. How many accidents have we seen there
&gt; over the years?
">

Ah, yes, Ryder, the guy who said after qualifying,&quot;The tyre war looks
like a draw so the form book says Rossi versus Stoner with the strong
possibility of Dani Pedrosa continuing his form from Germany.&quot; Now I
didn't see the tire war as a draw, it seemed pretty obvious that
Bridgestone had an edge, and it's interesting that he doesn't even
mention Americans Hopkins and Hayden, or Vermeulen for that matter -
hopelessly Euro-centric? So why doesn't he just say it, that GP
shouldn't race in America at all, just because they don't have a service
road all along the circuit (and there won't be one at Indy as well, of
course, since at minimum they use parts of the oval)?

On the red flag delay, which was very long, maybe the guys in race
control were the same ones who worked Philip Island last year? You know
the ones, who never saw Rossi pass under the waiving yellow and then
didn't figure it out until after the race, when it was &quot;too late&quot; to do
anything...

The real issue here is entirely the need to stop the action to deal with
a more significant injury if it occurs in certain sections of the
track. That stoppage was very brief once it actually happened. So is
that enough to take Laguna off the calendar? What about other tracks
with the same issue?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - Ryder again. &quot;It would never happen in Europe: Only two races on
&gt; Sunday! In the UK they wouldn't pay to get in and in Spain they'd burn

&gt; Two races? You're kidding. Every other round of MotoGP manages 4 races
&gt; on the day, sometimes 5.
">

So why is that? I don't know for sure, but I strongly suspect it's
Dorna, who may have been saying, &quot;You want more on-track activity? Buy
our support classes and you can have that&quot;. More likely the issue was
Dorna having no confidence in the repaving and the historical weather at
the track. You can see that in the SSport race being held on Saturday,
after MotoGP qualifying, SB practice being very limited and all in the
morning (on Saturday at 8:30am!), and the race after the MotoGP race on
Sunday. Hell, had Dorna had their way, they probably wouldn't have had
any other action on that track. So maybe they will have more next year,
those issues having been resolved.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Shit happens when some guys are going slowly and others aren't. It's not
like it hasn't happened elsewhere. Laguna's probably got more potential
for this, since it's tighter than most tracks and has more blind
corners. It's hard to say about the Roberts incident, we can't see
enough to lay total blame, but it's pretty clear that Checa wasn't doing
what he should have been, touring right on the racing line all the way
through that corner in the closing minutes of qualifying with someone at
speed behind him. And at least Hopkins, in a state of fury, managed to
stay out of Roger Lee's way while screaming at the fu... er, Chucker...

You mean like Edwards in '05? Yeah, he's a real crazy on the track. And
you can blame the Italians for that, they eliminated the &quot;skill&quot; part of
that corner by insisting on conventionalizing the entrance. The riders
used to the track have said they think they made it more dangerous than
it was in the process.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - Pretty much nobody going faster on qualifiers than they went on worn

&gt; another downside of the new tyre rules. Again. Like I said before, I
&gt; didn't like some riders getting special tyres flown in on Fri and Sat
&gt; night, but the current system isn't right either.
">

Nope, it isn't. Maybe Michelin is just behind now, or maybe they need to
learn how to make a more broadly-applicable tire than they're used to,
perhaps relying on lots of variety and Saturday Night Specials more than
Bridgestone. I've never liked the rule and it obviously needs a tweak at
minimum, perhaps more tires allowed or making selection on Friday
instead of Thursday. That still eliminates the still-warm specials but
gives the riders a chance to hone in some before making the choices.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - Just like Sachsenring, we had new tarmac but with new bumps. Again, why?

Hard to say. I can see why Laguna would have more problems with this,
given the verticality and the problems with getting all that perfectly
smooth. But it sounded like there were bumps in six and at the exit of
nine, which aren't quite so vertical, although they are spots where
Laguna has had bumps in the past. The only thing I saw that appeared to
be a surface irregularity was on the ext of four, but it's hard to see
some of that from trackside. Last year wasn't so tough in some spots.

De Puniet?? In 250, you mean? He's a factory team #1, with the top tire
manufacturer, on a bike that looks very good, and the most he's done is
do through a lot of bodywork. It was a Bridgestone weekend and
Capirossi, Hayden and Stoner DNF, and he finishes sixth, 38 seconds
back, and who did he beat? Barros, and Edwards on shitty Michelins?
C'mon. The best guys out there without factory rides were both in the SB
race, Mladin and Spies, without any doubt at all. With reduced practice
time, on Dunlops and without qualifiers Spies managed to qualify within
4/10ths of the MotoGP top ten, and within a tenth of Tamada on Dunlop GP
qualifiers.

Remember that Hodgson was hardly on the Corona bike, he was on a blend
of the Corona and American Honda chassis with a factory team motor. It
was a very nice ride by Neil, and I hope he'll be back, hopefully it's
part of an audition for the factory team next year. They really need a
shakeup, and I can't think of a better guy, team him with Hayes and see
if that works.

That's how it goes sometimes. But remember Doohan in '92, when he had
all the bases covered. Anything can happen, but I think he's going to
win it, and rather easily. Right now he's got a 44-point lead over
Rossi, which is only 7 shy of what Hayden had at this point last year,
and he's got a tire advantage going into a part of the season when
Bridgestone has traditionally had an advantage and where Capirossi has
had most of his wins. And his bike doesn't have any of the liabilities
that Hayden's did a year ago, while Rossi's Yamaha is about the same. So
maybe the best we can hope for is good racing at the front some of the
time, like at PI. Otherwise, more of the same, I fear...

I seriously doubt that Hayden would say that. What he said in the
official post-race release was, &quot;It's certainly been a tough season
and this is just the way things seem to be going - another Turn One
incident. I don't want to say too much about that because it isn't
going to make things any different so we'll leave the incident at
that.&quot; That doesn't sound like a guy who thinks he made a mistake to
me, it sounds like a guy who got done in (again) but doesn't want to
get into a war of words in the press. Of course I think he's more
focused on what Stoner did than what Hopkins did. As for Hopper, he
said, &quot;Somehow Nicky came wide and I went up the inside of him, but as
I did that I guess he didn't see me and as he cut back in we came
together.&quot; It's the &quot;somehow&quot; that's kind of interesting there, and
for a guy who apparently doesn't like Hayden at all, he's reasonably
generous.

Hopkins and Hayden seem to have some sort of UDA supremacy rivalry going on.
Why that's the case I have no idea, because thus far -and as much as I like
Hopkins- it's a no contest going on between the two. The track records don't
compare thus far, as spectacularly as Hopkins may try at times...

Further on, if you ruin your own race, it is a mistake. All racers would
wish they hadn't been in that spot given 20/20 vision.

I think it's one of those &quot;kid from the wrong side of the tracks
confronts the rich kid who has everything&quot; kind of deals. Hopper has
always impressed me as having a bit of a chip on his shoulder and maybe
some deep-seated insecurity, and I don't think he likes that Nicky had
those factory rides in the AMA while  he was on a support team, then
stuck on the crappy Yamaha 500 and crappy Suzuki while Nicky comes in on
the factory Honda. And then of course Nicky has that million-dollar
smile while Hopper is stuck with those absurd ears. He talks about
beating Hayden most of the time when they raced against each other in
the AMA, but that must have been in 600SS in 2000, Nicky had just moved
up to SB and clearly wasn't focused on SS, defending his championship
with a winless 11th, his worst result in any season in any class. And
Hopper really didn't do any better, I don't think, certainly not in
points. Anyway, he's got this thing about Nicky, but I get the
impression that Nicky is rather puzzled by it all and mostly goes about
his business apparently unaware of the &quot;rivalry&quot;...

The kid just turned what, 21? As far as 250GP goes, what did he do there?
Hopefully more than here so far and no, I'm not putting the &quot;lad&quot; down, I'm
just saying he needs to actually win something before he's dropped in the
deep in of the MGP pool and he's not going to be able to do that if he
doesn't stay put for a while. His FX effort aside, I can't think of a
better, or for that matter, tougher place to learn 4 stroke road racing than
AMA SSport. Let him win a few in that class and then I'll say maybe, until
then, I think letting Dorna use him for his passport is a mistake he'll
regret. If, as everyone around here likes to say, MGP is the best of the
best shouldn't a young guy be on his stride when he gets there? Maybe being
in a loooong drought as you guys have endured it makes sense to throw him in
ASAP, however, I don't see it and hope someone allows the kid to mature not
only himself, but his craft before being tossed in the do, or you're gone

It's not about maturity. It's about whether he can do the job.

What he probably should do is get a competitive ride in 250GP. But the
reason he's in the USA at all is because he couldn't get one. Not
because he can't ride but because there are only 4 or 5 seats woirth
having. It's the same reason Anthony West has been all over the place
this year. He's an extremely competent 250 rider who simply couldn't get
competitive 250 machinery.

Which is actually a big problem with the 125, 250, MotoGP route. There
are 2 Hondas and maybe 3 Aprilias which are worth riding in 250.
The rest of the field are hopeless. The one hope is that KTM can broaden
the field a bit.

Win something first.  You mean like Roger?  Oh wait, Rog hasn't
actually won anything yet, has he?  A small handful of supersport
races with no title doesn't count for much.  He hasn't been able to
top his brother over the past few years and he hasn't even come close
to matching the achievements of either brother at this point in his
life.  And yet your convinced that he's more ready for MGP insanity
than the kid who's already been there over three years?

I'm not so sure Chaz will develop into a top MGP rider, but he has the
more relevent background than Rog at this point, at least on paper as
far as the powers that be are concerned.  As for winning in SS first,
remember he is on a privateer bike and when's the last time one of
them won?

Personally I think there are probably better rider options out there
than either of those two at the moment and RLH getting a GP ride would
be quite unjustified at this point.

I actually do think he did well at Laguna though.

That's only half right, that team runs last year's Yamaha factory bikes,
and it's a pretty good team with what looks like some real resources. So
he's not exactly your average privateer.

Yes, he did a very respectable job, but I agree that he's not exactly
deserving, and I doubt he'll get that ride.

So who is, what are the better options? To me the guys who are in and
clearly deserve to be in GP, who can seriously race at that level if not
win championships, but could win races if the circumstances are right
(realistically) and can race with adequate consistency, are: Rossi,
Hayden, Stoner, Pedrosa, Melandri, Hopkins, Vermeulen, Nakano,
Capirossi, Roberts, Edwards. The guy who I have considered the baseline
for a MotoGP rider is Checa, and I'd rate Barros at about that level as
well. I think Tamada falls below that, and Elias is somewhere in that
range, sort of a young Checa - he could have top rides for the next
decade but I doubt he'd ever be in a championship fight. Capirossi,
Edwards, Roberts, Barros and Checa are near the end, but they all may be
back next year. Then there are the guys who I don't think really deserve
to be there, but have opportunities created by circumstances, passports,
sponsors, etc. - de Puniet, Hofmann, Guintoli, West, Kurtis R. MotoGP
always seems to have a handful of these guys. That's not to say that
West and Roberts couldn't prove to be worthy, or that de Puniet doesn't
deserve even a marginal ride (maybe with Tech3 on Dunlops?), but they
haven't exactly earned the seats they have.

Right now we have the following current guys contracted for next year:
Rossi at Fiat Yamaha, Hayden at Repsol Honda, Stoner and Melandri at
Marlboro Ducati, Hopkins at Kawasaki, Vermeulen at Suzuki, and I believe
Nakano at Konica-Minolta Honda. One has to assume Pedrosa will be back
at Repsol, and it's quite likely that Capirossi will end up at Suzuki,
or perhaps Kawasaki. Elias may get the seat Loris doesn't, or he'll
likely end up back at Gresini. So that's ten guys. Edwards is on the
bubble, probably dependent on the whims of Rossi as much as anything
else. If Team Roberts is back, one would assume one of the Robertses
will do the riding. The first new guy confirmed is Lorenzo, somewhere in
the Yamaha mix and apparently a new team sponsored by Fortuna.

So we're left with perhaps one factory seat (Kawasaki or Suzuki), plus
Gresini, D'Antin, Tech3, Cecchinello, possibly Aspar, maybe eight total
open rides. Those seats have traditionally been heavily influenced by
sponsors or Dorna's passport balancing. Regarding the former, Gresini
might lose Hannspree (his 3rd sponsor in as many years) and Tech3 is
tied to Dunlop now. Regarding that latter, Hofmann may get more life as
the designated German, de Puniet the designated Frenchman, and a Brit is
needed in the worst way. That Brit looks like Toseland, unless Honda
manages to get him to buy the line that Vermeulen didn't (to his
everlasting gratitude). The options beyond that are limited, and include
Laguna wildcards Davies and Hodgson, I suppose. But I think there will
be one.

So maybe five seats left, and you have to figure that some of the old
guys will be back. Now who do you look to? Everyone is in love with 250,
since these guys are already there and the current 800s seem to be
well-matched with their abilities and assets. But how good are these
guys? Lorenzo will be a two-time champion and hase certainly won a lot
of races, but what's his competition? If this wasn't a promotional step
to MotoGP, guys like Nakano, Jacque, Melandri, Pedrosa, Stoner, de
Puniet, Elias would all still be there, and that doesn't include any of
the guys from the '90s still racing - would Lorenzo be winning against
them? I really doubt it. Instead, as Julian said, 250 has maybe a half
dozen competitive bikes, those almost always go to JIS riders, and at
the moment none of them is over 25 years old (not to mention over 55kg)
- that's the top seven riders in the championship, who have all of the
podiums so far this year. So what makes them particularly deserving? The
championship record of 250 champions in the premier class is abysmal in
the longer run (one guy in 35 years), and it seems 250 guys rarely
improve markedly over their early impressions - by year two you know
what they'll be. But the bikes ARE right for them now.

Then there's WSB, and once you get past Toseland it's mostly older guys,
and pretty much guys who have had some kind of shot in GP in the past.
So that's pretty much bare. BSB hasn't really developed anyone who's
young, promising and adequately proven, I don't think. JSB has'nt
produced a young guy who's gone out into the world since Kiyonari, maybe
the best product of both those national series. But he'll only get in if
Honda makes it happen, as they did in 2003. Australia seems to only
produce young guys destined to work their way up elsewhere, and
otherwise the best guy appears to be Stauffer, who raced here in '03.

Which leaves the AMA, and the one guy who I think is clearly,
unquestionably deserving - Spies. He's won, heading toward his second SB
championship and now tied with Hayden for fourth on the all-time SB win
list, he's experienced and mature but still very young at 22, he's fast
and consistent, he's beaten most of the veterans who have been at the
front in the AMA for the last decade or more. His liabilities are that
he hasn't raced abroad and that he's (gasp!) a normal-sized human being.
He may not have raced 250s, but he also isn't a dirttracker recently
adopting to roadracing. Roger Lee is probably next, as DiSalvo has
proven to be a real disappointment the last couple years. The previously
most deserving guy to me, E-Boz, has gone off-track too much and will
turn 31 later this year. And Tommy Hayden is really struggling this
year.

So it doesn't really seem like there are a bunch of guys with obvious
talent, sufficient youth and also a winning record right now. Maybe that
means West deserves a very hard look, and that guys like RL and Davies
more than a glance. There might end up being spots for maybe 2 or 3 more
new guys, and I don't know how far down the list they'd be. Again, so
much depends on the whims of the lease team managers and their sponsors
and what Dorna wants to do with the mix. So RL may have a possible shot
at Kawasaki (if they don't want de Puniet, can't get any targeted
current MotoGP guys, and aren't all that impressed with what's in 250)
but nowhere else, and Davies might get a Dorna-supported ride with
someone like D'Antin or Poncharal.

&gt;than either of those two at the moment and RLH getting a GP ride would
&gt;be quite unjustified at this point.
">

What if Kawasaki manage to run 3 bikes for the rest of the season and
Hoffman doesn't recover from his horrendous injuries. Who should get
those two rides for all the remaining races? I figure Chaz could just
just jump ship. It would be hard on Celtic but the championship isn't at
stake. Could RLH do all the remaining races or are there some major date
clashes?

Hodgson has counted himself out. So is there anyone else?

Looking down the 250 field and next year's MotoGP rides
- De Angelis could probably put on a good show. He's certainly fast,
perhaps as fast as Lorenzo. But he doesn't seem to have the race craft.
Always 2nd, never the winner.
- Dovizioso is not Dani P but he's very similar. I get the impression he
doesn't have the killer instinct and doesn't quite make the most of use
of his Honda's strengths. But he is way above any other Honda rider. And
the Honda is *not* the bike to have in 250.
- Bautista is going to be a major talent. He needs to win the
championship next year. And I think he will, with Lorenzo like
dominance.
- Barbera is an idiot.
Of the rest, nobody really stands out and West is the only journeyman
left in the McWilliams mould. The KTM boys could surprise us but they
need to build on the last couple of races and do another year.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Really? See, we didn't get any of that, or at least I didn't notice it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;did, that said, I think it might be a little premature to throw Chas
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the MGP fray. I know you guys want a homey to pull for and God knows,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;waay past time, but give the kid a chance to &quot;age&quot; a little  before he's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tossed in the middle of all that insanity..

&gt;&gt;&gt; Err why? He's already done 2.5 years in 250GP and 1 in 125GP along with
&gt;&gt;&gt; riding in the Spanish and UK 125GP championships. So he's well used to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;all that insanity&quot;.

&gt;&gt; The kid just turned what, 21? As far as 250GP goes, what did he do there?
&gt;&gt;Hopefully more than here so far and no, I'm not putting the &quot;lad&quot; down,
&gt;&gt;I'm
&gt;&gt;just saying he needs to actually win something before he's dropped in the
&gt;&gt;deep in of the MGP pool

&gt; Win something first.  You mean like Roger?  Oh wait, Rog hasn't
&gt; actually won anything yet, has he?  A small handful of supersport
&gt; races with no title doesn't count for much.  He hasn't been able to
&gt; top his brother over the past few years and he hasn't even come close
&gt; to matching the achievements of either brother at this point in his
&gt; life.  And yet your convinced that he's more ready for MGP insanity
&gt; than the kid who's already been there over three years?
">

Where did I say I was &quot;convinced&quot; about anything other than SSport being a
good place for
Chas to hone his 4 stroke skillz? If you read the thread, my retort to Mr.
Bond's thought that is was the worst avenue to MGP was when I brought up the
series leader and contrary to what Mark thinks, I do believe Kaw is
seriously considering him for next year. You don't see OEM's flying guys to
Nipland to test just for fun, but if you'd like me to say RL's a better and
more deserving rider than Chas at this point, I will. The kid needs to do
something before jumping in the middle of MGP and he's never gonna do that
unless he stays a while in one place. Evidently, he thought coming here was
his best shot at a MGP career, but unless he actually does something first
I'd find it hard to fathom his MGP life will be anything other than short..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm not so sure Chaz will develop into a top MGP rider, but he has the

&gt; remember he is on a privateer bike and when's the last time one of
&gt; them won?

He's relevant because of his passport, not because of accomplishments and I
am &quot;convinced&quot; that dropping someone (especially an anglo) into MGP before
they're ready just to up they gate is not in the best long term interest's
of the rider.
Now, addressing your quip that Celtic racing is at a disadvantage in SSport,
bottom line, they are not! Celtic racing has been around for a while and
just by Chas's Qtimes show they're competent and that he's quick, his
problems really only become apparent when the green flag is dropped. I have
done my best to watch the kid both on and off the track this year and yes,
he's personable and a little outspoken like Hodgy, but when it comes
racetime he's been handled pretty easily, if not roughly. I believe it would
be in his long term best interest to have something, even if it's just a few
W's and not a title, in his pocket before attempting a MGP career, but
that's just me, I'm sure there are others that feel differently..

I think you have that a bit wrong there, I do think they're considering
him. But as for his test and wildcard race, they apparently wanted to do
the same thing with Tommy last year, and I think in large part as a
promotional opportunity in front to the fans in America. Testing the
bike before the race is more a function of having a guy already
employed, you can't do a wildcard tryout with someone already employed
by another factory, and having the guy acclimated increases the chances
he can be somewhat competitive in the race, and his presence there is
what's really unusual - how many true wildcards have we seen in MotoGP?
The test cost very little, but running a third bike in America much more.

Regarding next year, I think Kawi must be considering a number of guys.
They are making statements about getting truly serious about MotoGP next
year, and both Hopper moving there and Kawi's willingness to pay him $5M
backstops that. That might mean they're just as serious about the second
saddle, and may not want to commit to a guy needing a couple years to
learn the tracks and get up to speed. Or they may want a guy who can
help pay for it all, who can drag in a (Spanish?) sponsor. Maybe
consideration of Rog has to do with a Monster tie-in, which is likely to
be the only reason they'd go with two American riders.

but if you'd like me to say RL's a better and

Davies coming over here may not have anything to do with getting to
MotoGP, it may be just his decision about having a viable career in bike
racing, meaning making a real living. I really doubt that he thinks it's
the place to get noticed by the people in GP. Here's a conmment made by
Harold Bartol of KTM earlier this year, relative to the switch to
production four stroke motors in the support classes: &quot;I know that Honda
wants this, but they should show me one good 600 rider who is doing good
in MotoGP. Everybody who is doing good is comes from the small classes
where they learn their racing education&quot;. Now, aside from simply being
wrong about that (has he never heard of Hopkins or Vermeulen?), I think
that reveals a general European bias in GP, truly believing anyone
outside their world isn't worth consideration. How many times do you
think anyone from one of the lease teams or even the factory teams have
gotten on a plane to go scout an racer at an AMA race? Maybe never?

They do that all the time now. Was Pedrosa really ready last year, or
Stoner? How about Lorenzo next year? The feeling these days seems to be
you have to get guys in early, before they're &quot;polluted&quot; by riding other
classes of machinery. I think that's wrong and a bad trend, but there it
is.

AMA teams have nurtured lots of young guys, but the real step has been
letting them fly the coop and move to Europe. And that just hasn't
happened - look at Bostrom with Kawi, Hayden with Honda, we don't know
Spies is going anywhere, etc. Is the last guy actually Edwards with
Yamaha? I wouldn't overrate this wildcard ride. If Kawi is truly serious
about Rog we will see him do other wildcard rides this year, on the road
on tracks he doesn't know. Japan on the weekend after the Laguna final
looks like the most likely date (no need to ship equipment, tradition of
wildcards there, first non-conflict date), and there are three GPs after
that. Rog's only issue about those late races is that it forces him to
either wait to sign a contract with anyone for next year or sign with
Kawi in any case. But what if, say, American Honda offers him a deal and
won't wait?

And we keep trying to tell you that he's been racing in 250GP. And the
only reason he's in the AMA is because in 250GP the teams running 6th
position and down don't have competitive machinery. It's exactly the
same problem Anthony West had and has. They may well be very good GP
racers but there's no way to know because it's impossible for them to
get a ride with Repsol Honda, or the factory Aprilia rides. And without
that they'll always be 1,2,3 seconds off the pace.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Not at all. I don't think before last weekend Chaz had even thought of
racing in MotoGP. He came to AMA because it was the only way to
resurrect his career. The previous year he'd had to pack his bags half
way though because the 250GP team he was riding for ran out of money.
What do you do when you can't get a ride? Go back 2 months. Do you think
West went to WSS to try and get into MotoGP? I reckon he went because
he's a racer and he wanted to race.

Whatever. I do kind of agree with you that you have to show some
ability, some how. Maybe that's a national support championship. Maybe
it's to prove you can ride and fit in when the opportunity falls in your
lap. On that basis, Chaz and RHL proved they can ride a MotoGP bike and
fit in. RHL did it by being close to the other Kawa riders and coming in
10th. Chaz did it by coping with being dropped into a ludicrous
situation, getting a fastest lap within one second of Hopkins and
chopping 3seconds off his lap time between the end of FP2 and the end of
the race.

Grow up? He also took out his teammate and nearly ruined his
championship run, crashed in races a couple other times, and made some
very questionable moves a few other times. No doubt he's good, but is
anyone truly ready for MotoGP at 20? As for 250, yes, he wasn't really
going to learn much more there, because he was racing a bunch of kids
like himself. If it wasn't viewed just as an assembly line for EuroMed
MotoGP riders, good bikes went to more experienced guys and they
didn't ship the top guys up to MotoGP before they're old enough to
drink legally, then maybe guys who are only 19 or 20 could learn a bit
more before making the move. As I've said before, I think riders
should be required to be at least 21 before the start of the year in
order to be eligible for MotoGP. I think some of the problems on the
track (and off) in MotoGP arise out of riders who enter GP as
teenagers and move up to the top shortly thereafter, without enough
maturity but plenty of overinflated ego and adolescent bravado. I
don't equate not being ready with not capable of winning.

Just my opinion, of course...

&gt; then maybe guys who are only 19 or 20 could learn a bit
&gt;more before making the move. As I've said before, I think riders
&gt;should be required to be at least 21 before the start of the year in
&gt;order to be eligible for MotoGP. I think some of the problems on the
&gt;track (and off) in MotoGP arise out of riders who enter GP as
&gt;teenagers and move up to the top shortly thereafter, without enough
&gt;maturity but plenty of overinflated ego and adolescent bravado. I
&gt;don't equate not being ready with not capable of winning.

Was Freddie Spencer not ready?  He first went to GPs at 19, was full
time at 20 and won the championship when 21.
