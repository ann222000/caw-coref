Nostalgia machine going on in the ol' badbad homestead this weekend.

This weekend I was going through some old Supergirl and Brave and the
Bold.  (aside: I didn't know Tony De Zuniga drew a Supergirl - Adventure
Comics 424 to be exact).  I was struck with a bit of nostalgia.

Anyway, older comics had a different feel from the modern comics that
you buy in the comic store. I know that technology marches on and
besides the obvious paper and printing and coloring advances, there are
some things to be said in favour of the old three colors.

One thing I noticed was that when the pages don't directly continue, the
publisher put &quot;continued on 3d page following&quot; on the bottom right of
the panel.

That is something I miss now. There are other things I miss about old
comics that the new comics don't have but this struck me as a little
courtesy that was kind of cool.  I know when I see an advert that it
doesn't pertain to the story, but this little nicety takes the reader
outside of the panel and reminds them that there is paper medium they
are holding in their hands.

There are other things I miss about comics like I wish the comic
publisher would consistently put a letter page in the comic. Even though
not many people would take time and waste a stamp, it was nice to see
your letter printed in the comic.  You became a part of history as it were.

Is there anything that anyone misses about the older comics versus the
newer comics?

Of course without that blurb, the Great DC Contest wouldn't have
worked.

(whoops, should I have left some spoiler space for that?)

I actually enjoyed the old-style art more than the new, computerized,
photo-realism stuff, and the old newsprint paper more than the new,
glossy, acid-free stuff. Not just in a nostalgic way, either. I'm
having more problems with the printing of the newer books than the
older books (mostly in the form of smearing and peeling pages).

I miss all of those old ads (&quot;Hostess&quot; Comic Ad-ventures, Grit, Sea
Monkeys, the ads for the new seasons of Saturday morning cartoons,
etc.).

I miss the un-realism of the older stories.

Probably more stuff, as well.

With all of those ridiculous mini-comics ads in the middle of books
these days, I think I'd rather not see 'continued on 12th page following'.

The thing I miss most about those old comics?

Jim Aparo. Curt Swan. John Buscema. Kurt Schaffenberger. Prolific and
talented artists -- artists and =storytellers=, mind you! -- on whom you
could count to do great work, issue in and issue out, on two, three, maybe
even four books a month. And never. Ship. Late.

(OK, granted, they were cranking out seventeen-page books back then, but
they were also used extensively on annuals, specials, treasuries, adverts
[house and Hostess] and the like, so the two eras really are more
comparable than they might seem.)

There are, what, maybe three working pencillers in the business capable of
the kinds of work that were commonplace among an earlier generation, and at
least two of those (Ron Frenz, John Byrne) are woefully underemployed. And,
let's face it, neither is exactly considered a consummate draftsman...

I liked when they'd stick in little boxes that would mention other comic
issues as references. For example, when some character mentions some event
having taken place, they'd have a little box with the issue number where
it happened, so you could go look up the details if you wanted to.

I also liked it better when they made no phony pretensions about the
stories in the comics being &quot;realistic.&quot;

I would have to agree.  Reality is highly overrated.

PS:  does anyone know how to tell who drew the covers for Adventure
Comics?  I was looking at #424 (The aforementioned De Zuniga art) and
I'm wracking my imperfect memory.

Didn't Neal Adams do the covers for a lot of them?  Hmm. Inquiring minds
want to know.

The Grand Comics Database at www.comics.org is a good reference for
such things.  According to them, Adventure #424's cover was by Bob
Oksner (who also inked DeZuniga's story within).

I'm shocked tat no one mentioned the Write Right Now ads With the
cheap toys and gear, Like a comic classified section, And The Captain
O Olympic sales ads. I loved looking at all the cool stuff when I was
a kid. Knowing full well that I would never ever get those items. Also
the Editor's box and the Continued on 2nd/3rd page following blurbs.
Now that I think of it the letters pages WITH Next Issue Boxes. I
remember that the Batman and Superman books had 4 or at one time 5
boxes for all the books, Even the Giffen JLA/JLE/JLI books had several
because some charictars had their own book and minis.
