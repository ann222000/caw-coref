Is there any function in ruby which allows you to trim leading zeros (or
any specific character) from a string. Or if there is some reg
expression that i can use?

Hi,

for simple character replacement, you may do something like
&quot;####helloworld&quot;.gsub!(/^#+/,'')
the same can be written in String class if you use this too often,
class String
def trim_lead(n)
self.gsub!(/^#{n}+/,'')
end
end
puts &quot;00001234&quot;.trim_lead(&quot;0&quot;)

but when you use this to replace any special characters used
internally by regex (for e.g., $)
you have to do something like &quot;$$$1234&quot;.trim_lead(&quot;\\$&quot;)
Others may suggest better ways.

Hi
if you have string expressions like

s = 0{1,*}[1-9]* (some number with leading zeros)

perhaps the must obvious method is

s.to_i.to_s

:)

but this isn't genralizable to other kind of leading characters,
for them a regexp may be better

The simplest and fastest is probably

s.sub! /\A0+/, ''

Kind regards
