BOO!

Haha!  As you know, hypos don’t have enough energy to JUMP at that
little trick.

But, yes, it is that time of year again to DIG UP old posts and
reLIVE the good ol' times at a.s.t.  Of course, when I posdeT this
in the past, did I get any scripts?  NO!  I got even more suggestions
for other movies and TV shows (thanks, Mary, Diana, Simon and Lois).
&lt;Rolling eyes.....in green gobs of greasy grimy gopher gut gravy.&gt;
Come on.  People!  I want sCRYPTS on my desk by next Thursday!  Get
busy!  Why am I reposting (regifting?)?  Because this was the year of
the three-quel....gag....choke.  How bad was this year's crop of
movies?  Well, &quot;Wild Hogs&quot; didn't even have one pig in it at all,
and the hogs had rusdeT chrome.  Need I say more?  Sigh, well, at
least there was &quot;Spiderpig! Spiderpig! Does whatever a Spiderpig
does!&quot; from &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;.  Maybe, if you are all lucky, I
will give this up next year.  Time to write a play (I'm thinking
&quot;Pig-malion&quot;) or an opera (must star Placebo Domingo).

Last Halloween was bad for me.  I got real beat up.  I went to a
party dressed as a pinata.

And then I posdeT my annual tribute to the thyroid in the movies...

I thought I’d do something a bit different.  Instead of reviewing
existing movies that have a subliminal thyroid theme, I’d like to
invite everyone to help me script some new movies.  Basically, I
think we need to cover some other genres besides the horror flicks.
The Thyroidless Horseman?  Been done.  And, Frankenstein and
Vampires already show the power of the thyroid horrors.  You know,
as battery connector bolts on the side of the neck to jump start
a dead(!!) thyroid, or the source of thyroid juice, respectively.
Neck-rophilia.  And many others have been covered in past editions
of this post.   But where are the other genres?

Here are my pitches so far (updated for 2007):

Epic:
“Lord of the Glands”  - One gland to rule them all! – An
epic quest to Mt Doom.  (Not to be confused with
Michael Flatley’s dance version, cuz not only are
my arms not moving, neither are my legs!)

SciFi:
“Gland Wars” – a six part series
Part 1 – Phantom Menace – You’re sure you’ve got
something, but you just don’t know what it
is yet.
Part 2 – Supplement Wars – Try this supplement of
Qui-Gon, cuz it is way better than that old
Dong-Quai fellow.
Part 3 - Revenge of the Endo – A turn to the evil
side.
Part 4 – New Hope – You start the pills and things
seem better.
Part 5 – The Gland Strikes Back – Oops, you haven’t
got the right dose yet.
Part 6 – Return of the Bodi – Uplifting finale!

Comedy:
“Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Thyroid”  - Don’t Panic!  The
answer to Life, the Universe, Everything...I’m sorry,
I forgot what the question was...

Porn:
“Deep Throat” – a movie that is tough to swallow, but may
oddly also feature the line &quot;rectal exam revealed
a normal-sized thyroid&quot;

Family:
“Babe” – Gives up his thyroid that Maaa can live (and his
ribs go to the Master basted in a tangy sauce)

Animated:
“Snow White and the Seven Dwarves of Hypo”: Itchy, Bitchy,
Sweaty, Sleepy, Bloated, Forgetful and Psycho
“Pig Little” – The thyroid’s falling! The thyroid’s
falling!

Musical:
“Wizard of Thyroidland”
-“Toto, I don't think we're in Thyroid anymore.”
-“If I only had a thyroid...”
-“Ding, dong, the thyroid's dead...”  [Credit to BL
for this one!  Ask her for the rest of her lyrics.]

Suspense:
“Dial T for Thyroid”

Mystery:
“The Big Sleep” – Ok, so it is no big mystery who the
Bogieman (and Bacallwoman) are going to be here...

Western:
“How the Thyroid was Won”
“Gunfight at the Thyroid Corral” – Shooting pains in the ol’
gland.

Chick Flicks:
“Where the Thyroid is”
“Butterfly-Shaped Glands are Free” (or relatively inexpensive
when desiccated into little round pills)

Social Commentary/Satire:
“Animal Pharma” – the pigs become dotcommunists and take over
drug distribution, but become as corrupt.

Romantic Adventure:
&quot;Pigrates of the Caribbean - Dead Thyroid's Chest&quot; - A small box
contains the pulsating remnants of Davy Jones' thyroid.
(Does the line 'Jonesing for my pig bits' get your blood
levels up?)  And then there was this year's installment:
&quot;Pigrates of the Caribbean - At Wit's End&quot; - talk about three-quel
Arrrr, avast ye Thyroidies!

And, YES!, a true action adventure flick:
&quot;Snakes on a Thyroid&quot; - Haven't gotten a full sCRYPT yet, but it
*must* feature the line:  &quot;Get these Motherf---ing goiter
snakes off my Motherf---ing thyroid!&quot;

The Mash Up Movies of the year:
&quot;Charlotte's Web Meets Spiderman&quot; - Can't you see Spidey spinning
&quot;SOME PIG&quot; over the city skyline?
Bill Nighy, (Davey Jones from Pigrates), has a major role in
&quot;Snakes on a Thyroid&quot;

Have you tried the punch?  Over there in the cauldron.....
Eye of newt, wing of bat, toad food (whew, for a second there I
thought he said that most foul of things, tofu), thyroid of pig....
Say the magic word, and

PPPPPPP      OOOO     OOOO     FFFFFFF   !!!
PP    PP    OO  OO   OO  OO    FF        !!!
PP    PP    OO  OO   OO  OO    FFFFF     !!!
PPPPPPP     OO  OO   OO  OO    FF         !
PP          OO  OO   OO  OO    FF
PP           OOOO     OOOO     FF        !!!

MuAhHaHaHAHAHA! {maniacal laughter}

Everyone can file out now, but take a pill or two from the basket by
the door. Pumpkin orange = 25ug; grape purple = 75ug; lemon yellow =
100ug; cherry red = 112ug; and &quot;dirt&quot; brown = 125ug.

BOO!  [and/or hiss]

How about a few good books:

The Science behind the Legend:  Rumplestiltskin discoveres the reason for
his long snooze was related to high TSH.

Sleeping Beauty.  We'll concentrate on her pale skin and large lips.  The
handsome endocrinologist comes  (ok, I won't spoil the ending).

Or movies:

Heatwave: in which hypo patients finally start to feel warm.  Everyone else
is dying of heat stroke...

Or songs:

These boots are made for walking.  I'll just sit them in the corner until
I'm good and ready to move....

Do walk walk, yes do walk walk.....

It's Monday morning at six o'clock and the clock made the mistake of ringing
for the last time.....

If I had a hammer, I'd hammer in the morning, I'd take a good nap for the
rest of the day......

I am woman, hear me snore, my thyroid walked out the door, and I haven't got
the energy to move...

Yesterday, thyorid troubles seemed so far away. Now we know they are here
today, oh I believe in Yesterday.  Suddenly, the world isn't what it used to
be.  All the crowd is walking faster than me.  Oh, I believe  in
Yesterday....

The foggy foggy do.

Oh, it's spring time in the rockies, and my hands are turning blue.  My
brain is fog, and I am tired, flat out through and through....

I thought that was the BIGBAD-wolf, not the BEO-wolf....

Besides, everyone knows that the wolf was framed:

Everybody knows the story of The Three Little Pigs. Or at least they
think they do. But I'll tell you a little secret. NOBODY knows the
real story because nobody has ever heard MY side of the story. I am
the wolf.  Alexander T. Wolf.  You can call me Al.  I don't know how
this whole BIG BAD WOLF thing got started but, it's ALL WRONG!!!!
Maybe it's because of our diets. Hey, it's not my fault wolves eat
cute little animals like bunnies, sheep and pigs. That's just the
way we are. If cheeseburgers were cute, folks would probably think
you were BIG AND BAD too!  But, like I was saying this whole Big Bad
Wolf stuff is ALL WRONG.

The real story was just about a sneeze and a cup of sugar.

That's all, I PROMISE!

HERE IS THE REAL STORY:
Way back, ONCE UPON A TIME LIKE, I was being the kind soul that I am
and making a birthday cake for my dear old granny. I had a TERRIBLE
SNEEZING COLD. I was in the middle of making the cake and ran out of
sugar. Figures!!!! So here I am out the door and down the street to
ask my neighbor for a cup of sugar. Now it would figure, this neighbor
of mine was a pig. Darn luck of mine. And he really wasn't too bright
either. He had built his house out of straw. Can you believe it?  I
mean, who in his right mind would build a house of straw?  So of
course the minute I knocked on the door the thing fell right in.
Now being of sound mind and manners I didn't want to just walk in to
someone else's house.  So I called out, &quot;Little Pig, Little Pig, ARE
YOU IN?&quot;

No  answer.

I was just about to give up and go home without the cup of sugar for
my dear old granny's birthday cake. Then my nose started to run and
itch. I felt a sneeze coming on. Well I huffed, and I puffed and OH
if I didn't sneeze one heck of a sneeze. And you know what?  That whole
straw house fell down. And right in the middle of the pile of straw was
the First Little Pig----DEAD as a doornail. The little guy had been home
the whole time. You know it seemed like a shame to leave a perfectly
good ham dinner lying there in the straw. So I ate up. Just think of
it as a big cheeseburger lying there.

I was feeling a little better but I still didn't have my cup of sugar.
So I went to the next neighbor's house. Figures! This neighbor was the
First Little Pigs brother. He was a little smarter but, not much. He
had built his house of sticks. I rang the doorbell on the stick house.

MAN!  Nobody answered.

So I called out, &quot;Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig, ARE YOU IN?&quot;  And the He yelled back,
&quot;Go away wolf! You can't come in. I'm shaving the hairs on my chinny chin
chin!&quot;

I had just let go of the doorknob when I felt another sneeze coming on.
Darn COLD!  I huffed, I puffed and I tried to cover my mouth, but I
sneezed a great sneeze. And you are not going to believe this, but this
guy's house fell down just like his dumb brother's did. When the dust
cleared, there was the Second Little Pig---DEAD as a doornail.  ~WOLF'S
HONOR~  Now you know food will spoil if you just leave it out in the
open. So I did the only thing there was to do. I had dinner again.
Just think of it as a second helping.

I was getting pretty darn full. But my cold was feeling better, and I
still didn't have that cup of sugar for my dear old granny's birthday
cake. So I went to the next house.  SHEESH!!  This guy was the First
and Second Little Pigs' brother. He must have been the Harvard graduate.
He had built his house of bricks. I knocked on the door to the brick
house, BIG MOTHER OF A HOUSE TOO!!

--No answer.

I called out, &quot;Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig, ARE YOU IN?&quot;  And do you know what the
rude little porker answered?  &quot;Get out of here WOLF AND DON'T EVER
BOTHER ME AGAIN!&quot; TALK ABOUT IMPOLITE!!  He probably had a whole sack
full of sugar too, and wouldn't give me even one little cup for my dear
old sweet granny's birthday cake.

WHAT A PIG!!

I was just about to go home and maybe make a nice birthday card instead
of a cake, when I felt my cold coming on again.  SHEESH!!!  I huffed!!!
And I puffed!!! And I sneezed once again.

The the Third Little Pig yelled, &quot;And your dear old granny can kiss my
behind!&quot; Now I am usually a pretty calm dude. But when someone talks
about my dear old granny like that, I get a little NUTSO!  When the
cops drove up, of course I was trying to break down the pig's door.
The whole time I was huffing and puffing and sneezing and making a
real scene.  THE REST AS THEY SAY IS HISTORY.....

The news reporters found out about the two pigs I had for dinner. They
figured a sick guy going to borrow a cup of sugar didn't sound too
exciting. So they jazzed up the story with all of that stuff of &quot;HUFF
AND PUFF AND BLOW YOUR HOUSE DOWN&quot; and then made me THE BIG BAD mean
WOLF.

That's it. The real story. I WAS FRAMED!

Oh, sure!  Give me even more work to do!  Snort!

I tell ya, give people a simple task of having them sCRYPT some movies,
and all they do is come up with new pitches......     ;o)

Speaking of music, have you heard The Who's &quot;Talking 'Bout My
Medication&quot;?  Or, The Rolling Stones' &quot;You Can't Always Pee When You
Want&quot;?  Paul Simon's &quot;Fifty Ways to Lose Your Liver&quot;?

P.S.  Loved your contribution.  But don't tell anyone I said that.  ;@)

Okaaaaaaay -  here are some outlines for movie scripts in the works ... to
be on your desk by the end of the decade.

&quot;It's a Wonderful Thyroid Life&quot;
About a group of thyroid patients who form a Usenet Newsgroup to educate
medics.

I'll take two purple pills please ... yum yum ... I don't know if they'll
work but I like the colour anyway ;o)

Take care,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Haha!  As you know, hypos don’t have enough energy to JUMP at that
&gt; little trick.

&gt; But, yes, it is that time of year again to DIG UP old posts and
&gt; reLIVE the good ol' times at a.s.t.  Of course, when I posdeT this
&gt; in the past, did I get any scripts?  NO!  I got even more suggestions
&gt; for other movies and TV shows (thanks, Mary, Diana, Simon and Lois).
&gt;   &lt;Rolling eyes.....in green gobs of greasy grimy gopher gut gravy.&gt;
&gt; Come on.  People!  I want sCRYPTS on my desk by next Thursday!  Get
&gt; busy!  Why am I reposting (regifting?)?  Because this was the year of
&gt; the three-quel....gag....choke.  How bad was this year's crop of
&gt; movies?  Well, &quot;Wild Hogs&quot; didn't even have one pig in it at all,
&gt; and the hogs had rusdeT chrome.  Need I say more?  Sigh, well, at
&gt; least there was &quot;Spiderpig! Spiderpig! Does whatever a Spiderpig
&gt; does!&quot; from &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;.  Maybe, if you are all lucky, I
&gt; will give this up next year.  Time to write a play (I'm thinking
&gt; &quot;Pig-malion&quot;) or an opera (must star Placebo Domingo).

&gt; Last Halloween was bad for me.  I got real beat up.  I went to a
&gt; party dressed as a pinata.

&gt; And then I posdeT my annual tribute to the thyroid in the movies...

&gt; I thought I’d do something a bit different.  Instead of reviewing
&gt; existing movies that have a subliminal thyroid theme, I’d like to
&gt; invite everyone to help me script some new movies.  Basically, I
&gt; think we need to cover some other genres besides the horror flicks.
&gt; The Thyroidless Horseman?  Been done.  And, Frankenstein and
&gt; Vampires already show the power of the thyroid horrors.  You know,
&gt; as battery connector bolts on the side of the neck to jump start
&gt; a dead(!!) thyroid, or the source of thyroid juice, respectively.
&gt; Neck-rophilia.  And many others have been covered in past editions
&gt; of this post.   But where are the other genres?

&gt; Here are my pitches so far (updated for 2007):

&gt; Epic:
&gt; “Lord of the Glands”  - One gland to rule them all! – An
&gt; epic quest to Mt Doom.  (Not to be confused with
&gt; Michael Flatley’s dance version, cuz not only are
&gt; my arms not moving, neither are my legs!)

&gt; SciFi:
&gt; “Gland Wars” – a six part series
&gt; Part 1 – Phantom Menace – You’re sure you’ve got
&gt; something, but you just don’t know what it
&gt; is yet.
&gt; Part 2 – Supplement Wars – Try this supplement of
&gt; Qui-Gon, cuz it is way better than that old
&gt; Dong-Quai fellow.
&gt; Part 3 - Revenge of the Endo – A turn to the evil
&gt; side.
&gt; Part 4 – New Hope – You start the pills and things
&gt; seem better.
&gt; Part 5 – The Gland Strikes Back – Oops, you haven’t
&gt; got the right dose yet.
&gt; Part 6 – Return of the Bodi – Uplifting finale!

&gt; Comedy:
&gt; “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Thyroid”  - Don’t Panic!  The
&gt; answer to Life, the Universe, Everything...I’m sorry,
&gt; I forgot what the question was...

&gt; Porn:
&gt; “Deep Throat” – a movie that is tough to swallow, but may
&gt; oddly also feature the line &quot;rectal exam revealed
&gt; a normal-sized thyroid&quot;

&gt; Family:
&gt; “Babe” – Gives up his thyroid that Maaa can live (and his
&gt; ribs go to the Master basted in a tangy sauce)

&gt; Animated:
&gt; “Snow White and the Seven Dwarves of Hypo”: Itchy, Bitchy,
&gt; Sweaty, Sleepy, Bloated, Forgetful and Psycho
&gt; “Pig Little” – The thyroid’s falling! The thyroid’s
&gt; falling!

&gt; Musical:
&gt; “Wizard of Thyroidland”
&gt; -“Toto, I don't think we're in Thyroid anymore.”
&gt; -“If I only had a thyroid...”
&gt; -“Ding, dong, the thyroid's dead...”  [Credit to BL
&gt; for this one!  Ask her for the rest of her lyrics.]

&gt; Suspense:
&gt; “Dial T for Thyroid”

&gt; Mystery:
&gt; “The Big Sleep” – Ok, so it is no big mystery who the
&gt; Bogieman (and Bacallwoman) are going to be here...

&gt; Western:
&gt; “How the Thyroid was Won”
&gt; “Gunfight at the Thyroid Corral” – Shooting pains in the ol’
&gt; gland.

&gt; Chick Flicks:
&gt; “Where the Thyroid is”
&gt; “Butterfly-Shaped Glands are Free” (or relatively inexpensive
&gt; when desiccated into little round pills)

&gt; Social Commentary/Satire:
&gt; “Animal Pharma” – the pigs become dotcommunists and take over
&gt; drug distribution, but become as corrupt.

&gt; Romantic Adventure:
&gt; &quot;Pigrates of the Caribbean - Dead Thyroid's Chest&quot; - A small box
&gt; contains the pulsating remnants of Davy Jones' thyroid.
&gt; (Does the line 'Jonesing for my pig bits' get your blood
&gt; levels up?)  And then there was this year's installment:
&gt; &quot;Pigrates of the Caribbean - At Wit's End&quot; - talk about three-quel
&gt; Arrrr, avast ye Thyroidies!

&gt; And, YES!, a true action adventure flick:
&gt; &quot;Snakes on a Thyroid&quot; - Haven't gotten a full sCRYPT yet, but it
&gt; *must* feature the line:  &quot;Get these Motherf---ing goiter
&gt; snakes off my Motherf---ing thyroid!&quot;

&gt; The Mash Up Movies of the year:
&gt; &quot;Charlotte's Web Meets Spiderman&quot; - Can't you see Spidey spinning
&gt; &quot;SOME PIG&quot; over the city skyline?
&gt; Bill Nighy, (Davey Jones from Pigrates), has a major role in
&gt; &quot;Snakes on a Thyroid&quot;

&gt; Have you tried the punch?  Over there in the cauldron.....
&gt; Eye of newt, wing of bat, toad food (whew, for a second there I
&gt; thought he said that most foul of things, tofu), thyroid of pig....
&gt; Say the magic word, and

&gt; PPPPPPP      OOOO     OOOO     FFFFFFF   !!!
&gt; PP    PP    OO  OO   OO  OO    FF        !!!
&gt; PP    PP    OO  OO   OO  OO    FFFFF     !!!
&gt; PPPPPPP     OO  OO   OO  OO    FF         !
&gt; PP          OO  OO   OO  OO    FF
&gt; PP           OOOO     OOOO     FF        !!!

&gt; MuAhHaHaHAHAHA! {maniacal laughter}

&gt; Everyone can file out now, but take a pill or two from the basket by
&gt; the door. Pumpkin orange = 25ug; grape purple = 75ug; lemon yellow =
&gt; 100ug; cherry red = 112ug; and &quot;dirt&quot; brown = 125ug.

&gt; BOO!  [and/or hiss]
